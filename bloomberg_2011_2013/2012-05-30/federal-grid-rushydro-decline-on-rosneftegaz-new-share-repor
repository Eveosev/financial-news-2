Federal Grid Co. and OAO RusHydro
tumbled after Vedomosti reported state-owned Rosneftegaz may
spend as much as 130 billion rubles ($4 billion) buying new
shares of state energy companies.  RusHydro lost 3.2 percent to 78.89 kopeks by the close in
Moscow. Federal Grid fell 5.7 percent to 18.07 kopeks, the
weakest since April 2009.  Minority shareholders’ stakes may be diluted if new shares
are issued, according to Alfa Bank analyst Alexander Kornilov
and ING Groep NV’s Igor Goncharov.  “This is negative news for investors,” Kornilov said by
phone. “This adds dilution risk for minority shareholders.”  -- Editors: Alex Nicholson, Peter Branton  To contact the reporter on this story:
