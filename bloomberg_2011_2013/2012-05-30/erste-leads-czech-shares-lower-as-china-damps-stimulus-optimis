Erste Group Bank AG (EBS)  of Austria fell,
leading Czech shares lower, as investors dumped riskier assets
after  China  damped speculation that it will step up economic
stimulus for the worldâ€™s second-largest economy.  The stock dropped 1.6 percent to 372 koruna by 10:48 a.m.
in Prague, snapping a two-day gain. The  PX (PX)  index of 14 equities,
in which Erste has an 18 percent weighting, fell 0.6 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
