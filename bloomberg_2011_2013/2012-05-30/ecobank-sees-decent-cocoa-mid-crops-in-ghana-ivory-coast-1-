Ivory Coast and  Ghana , the world’s
largest cocoa producers, will have “decent” mid-crops, the
smaller of two annual harvests, helped by rains, according to
 Ecobank Transnational Inc. (ETI)   Farmers in top grower Ivory Coast this year will harvest
325,000 metric tons of cocoa during the mid-crop, which usually
starts in April, the Lome, Togo-based lender estimated in a
report e-mailed today. Output from April to September in second-
ranking Ghana will be 170,000 tons, the bank said.  “From mid-April, there were widespread rains across West
Africa, which were particularly strong in Ivory Coast’s southern
and eastern cocoa-growing regions,”  Edward George , a soft
commodities specialist at the bank, said in the report. “These
have improved prospects for a decent mid-crop.”  Total output will be 890,000 tons in Ghana, a 13 percent
drop from last season, the bank estimates. In Ivory Coast,
production is estimated at 1.36 million tons, 9.8 percent lower
than last year’s record, according to the report.  Cocoa delivered to ports for export from Ghana fell 8.1
percent to 756,000 tons by May 10 from the same period a year
earlier, the bank said. In Ivory Coast, bean deliveries totaled
1.13 million tons by May 20, up 2.1 percent from a year earlier,
the bank said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
