(Corrects intended size of asset sale stakes in sixth
paragraph.)  Solid Energy New Zealand Ltd., the
nation’s biggest coal miner, said its coal seam gas reserves
beneath the North Island province of Taranaki are four times
larger than previously estimated.  The state-owned company has 858 billion cubic feet of gas,
equivalent to about 900 petajoules of energy, Christchurch-based
Solid Energy said in an e-mailed statement, citing an assessment
by Netherland, Sewell & Associates Inc. Previously the reserves
were estimated at about 190 petajoules.  Solid Energy said the gas would be enough to run a 400
megawatt power plant for 45 years, once it was commercially
viable. The company recently completed a trial at its Huntly
demonstration plant south of Auckland that proved it can produce
gas and generate electricity.  “Given the soft short-to-medium gas price outlook and the
expected cost of gas production in Huntly, further commercial
scale-up of coal seam gas production is not justified at this
time,”  Steven Pearce, general manager of gas developments said
in the statement.  The company is applying for a five-year extension of its
permit in the Taranaki region to identify the best areas and
methods for extraction, it said. The Taranaki focus means Solid
Energy will surrender other exploration permits in the  South
Island , while continuing work at Huntly, it said.  Prime Minister John Key’s government is planning to sell
stakes of up to 49 percent in four state-owned energy companies,
including Solid Energy, over the next five years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
