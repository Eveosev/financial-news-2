U.K. stocks  fell for the first time
in five days as borrowing costs climbed at an auction of Italian
debt and Spain struggled to recapitalize its banks, adding to
concern the euro-area debt crisis is spreading.  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS)  and HSBC Holdings Plc
declined more then 2 percent as the cost of insuring against
default on Spanish sovereign bonds rose to a record.  Vedanta
Resources Plc (VED)  and  Xstrata Plc (XTA)  led mining shares lower as copper
retreated for a second day.  The benchmark  FTSE 100 Index (UKX)  sank 93.86 points, or 1.7
percent, to 5,297.28 at the close in London, halting its longest
streak of gains this month. The FTSE All-Share Index also
declined 1.7 percent as 32 of the gauge’s companies traded
without the right to their latest dividend. In Ireland, the ISEQ
Index slid 1.5 percent.  “Everything seems to be going out the window,” Chris Beauchamp, a market analyst at IG Index in  London , said in a
phone interview. “Yields have shot up once again; it really
looks as if Spain is teetering on the brink. It feels like we
are getting to a similar point before we saw the bailout of
Portugal and Ireland.”  Portugal, Ireland and Greece sought aid from the European
Union and  International Monetary Fund  after their bond yields
breached 7 percent in 2010 and 2011. The FTSE 100 has lost 11
percent from its 2012 high on March 16 as Greece failed to form
a government and Spain’s borrowing costs surged.  Spanish Bonds  The euro weakened to the lowest level in almost two years
against the dollar and the pound fell to a four-month low as
Spanish bond yields increased.  The decline in Spanish five-year notes drove the yield to
more than 6 percent for the first time this year. Credit-default
swaps linked to the  Spain ’s debt climbed 29 basis points to a
record 589.5, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Italian borrowing costs also climbed at a bond auction as
the country sold less than the maximum amount of debt. The
Treasury priced the 10-year debt to yield 6.03 percent, the
highest since Jan. 30.  Stocks also fell as economic confidence in the euro area
declined more than economists forecast in May to the lowest in 2
1/2 years and as a poll in Greece showed that anti-austerity
party Syriza had the support of 30 percent of voters, compared
with 26.5 percent for  New Democracy , which backs the terms of a
European Union bailout.  RBS Retreats  RBS tumbled 3 percent to 20 pence,  HSBC (HSBA) ,  Europe ’s largest
bank, lost 2.1 percent to 503.5 pence and  Lloyds Banking Group
Plc (LLOY)  dropped 2.3 percent to 25.3 pence.  A  gauge  of U.K. bank shares dropped 1.9 percent even as the
European Commission called for direct euro-area aid for troubled
lenders and touted common bond issuance as an antidote to the
debt crisis now threatening to overwhelm Spain.  The commission, the European Union’s central regulator,
sided with Spain in proposing that the euro’s permanent bailout
fund inject cash to banks instead of channeling the money via
national governments.  Elsewhere, mining stocks retreated as  copper  fell for a
second day in London trading. Vedanta Resources dropped 5.4
percent to 940.5 pence, Xstrata slid 1.9 percent to 939.4 pence
and Rio Tinto Group lost 4.1 percent to 2,801 pence.  BG Group Plc declined 4.6 percent to 1,224 pence as the
U.K.’s third-largest gas producer said Chief Executive Officer
 Frank Chapman  sold 368,185 shares yesterday at an average of
1,285 pence apiece.  Crude Drops  Energy shares fell as crude oil tumbled more than 3 percent
in  New York . Royal Dutch Shell Group Plc fell 1.3 percent to
1,988.5 pence and BP Plc slid 2.1 percent to 398.3 pence. Tullow
Oil Plc lost 3.3 percent to 1,427 pence.  National Grid Plc (NG/) , an operator of energy networks in the
U.K. and North America, slipped 4.5 percent as the shares traded
without the right to the latest  dividend , removing 4.2 points
from the FTSE 100. Adjusting for the payment, the stock declined
0.8 percent to 650 pence.  Essar Energy Ltd. paced advancing shares, soaring 22
percent to 141.8 pence after a group of Indian ministers
recommended that cabinet approve coal blocks alloted to Reliance
Power Ltd. and a venture of Essar Energy and Hindalco Industries
Ltd. The recommendation is a step toward ensuring coal supplies
for  power plants  being built by the companies.  Booker Group Plc (BOK)  jumped 10 percent to 87 pence after the
company agreed to buy the Makro U.K. unit of Metro AG to expand
the range of food products it wholesales to caterers, retailers
and businesses. That was the biggest gain since July.  To contact the reporter on this story:
