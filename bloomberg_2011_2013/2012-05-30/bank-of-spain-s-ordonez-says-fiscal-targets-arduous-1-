Bank of  Spain  Governor Miguel Angel Fernandez Ordonez says meeting deficit targets will be
“tremendously arduous” amid the recession in the  euro area ’s
fourth-largest economy.  “The task of consolidation implicit in these fiscal
targets is turning out to be tremendously arduous,” said
Ordonez during a hearing in Spain’s senate, referring to Spain’s
commitment with the European Union to reduce its budget
shortfall to 5.3 percent of gross domestic product this year and
3 percent next year.  The difference between Spanish and German sovereign
 borrowing costs  surged to a euro-era record today, 5.27
percentage points for 10-year bonds. The Spanish yield jumped 17
basis points to 6.62 percent.  “The uncertainty surrounding the macroeconomic situation
is very high,” Ordonez said, citing the risk that tax receipts
come in lower than forecast and that spending is higher than
planned.  More spending cuts and tax raises, including permanent
ones, may be necessary, Ordonez said.  “It is not exaggerated to say that Spain’s future is at
stake mainly in the fulfilling of fiscal targets and that the
failure of the consolidation process would postpone the
possibility of an economic recovery,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
