Egypt â€™s finance ministry said it had
given the oil ministry an additional $100 million to buy
petroleum products.  The cash infusion, announced late yesterday in a statement
from the ministry, comes at a time when fuel shortages have
stoked anger even as officials consider reducing subsidies on
petroleum products as a way of cutting costs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
