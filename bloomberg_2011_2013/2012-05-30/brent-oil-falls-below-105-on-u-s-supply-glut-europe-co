Oil tumbled to a seven-month low on
speculation that U.S. crude stockpiles climbed to the highest
level since 1990 and as the euro weakened on concern that the
debt crisis will overwhelm Spain.  New York  futures fell 3.2 percent and Brent oil traded in
London settled below $104 a barrel for the first time this year.
An Energy Department report tomorrow will show that U.S.
supplies rose 1 million barrels to 383.5 million last week,
according to analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. The euro fell
versus the dollar as Spain’s default risk increased.  “We’re looking at a build of another million barrels to a
22-year high,” said  Addison Armstrong , director of market
research at Tradition Energy in  Stamford ,  Connecticut . “Given
how high inventories are and how weak the economy looks, no
wonder we’re trading lower. We’re going to probably continue
seeing dollar strength, which will keep the pressure on oil.”  Oil for July delivery fell $2.94 to $87.82 a barrel on the
 New York Mercantile Exchange , the lowest settlement since Oct.
21. Prices have decreased 16 percent this month, heading for the
biggest drop since December 2008.  Prices touched a seven-month intraday low of $87.27 a
barrel after the settlement. They were little changed from that
level after the  American Petroleum Institute , a Washington-based
industry group, said U.S.  oil inventories  dropped 353,000
barrels to 385.9 million last week. July futures decreased
$3.37, or 3.7 percent, to $87.39 in electronic trading at 4:52
p.m.  Brent oil for July settlement declined $3.21, or 3 percent,
to end the session at $103.47 a barrel on the London-based ICE
Futures Europe exchange. It was the lowest close since Dec. 16.  Saudi Arabian Oil Minister  Ali al-Naimi  said on May 13 in
Adelaide, Australia, that he wanted to see the Brent crude
contract drop to $100 a barrel.  Price Floor  “Ali al-Naimi has said he wants Brent at $100 and we’re
rapidly approaching that level,” said  Tim Evans , an energy
analyst at Citi Futures Perspective in New York. “It’s not
necessarily a floor. We may overshoot to the downside, like we
did to the upside earlier.”  U.S. crude inventories climbed in the previous nine reports
from the Energy Department. Fuel supplies dropped and  demand 
slipped 1.7 percent in last week’s report.  Gasoline stockpiles probably fell 1 million barrels last
week, according to the median of 11 analyst estimates in the
Bloomberg survey. Supplies of distillate fuel, a category that
includes heating oil and diesel, are projected to be unchanged,
the survey shows.  The department is scheduled to release its report at 11
a.m. tomorrow.  Euro Decline  The euro touched $1.2362, the lowest level against the
dollar since July 1, 2010. A weaker euro and stronger dollar
curb commodities’ appeal as an alternate investment. The
Standard & Poor’s GSCI Index of 24 commodities decreased 2.3
percent to the lowest level since Oct. 5.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index dropped 1.4 percent and the
 Dow Jones Industrial Average  slipped 1.3 percent.  “We’re looking at the same financial factors that have
been moving the oil market,” said  Stephen Schork , president of
the Schork Group Inc. in Villanova,  Pennsylvania . “Equities are
getting killed, the euro is getting killed and the pessimism
about Europe only seems to deepen.”  Europe needs to take steps to help “debt sustainability,”
Spanish Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy  said today. Italy’s
borrowing costs rose as the government sold 5.73 billion euros
($7.1 billion) of five- and 10-year debt, falling short of the
maximum target of 6.25 billion euros.  Greek Vote  In Greece, a VPRC opinion poll for Epikaira magazine showed
that anti-austerity party Syriza had the support of 30 percent
of voters, compared with 26.5 percent for  New Democracy , which
backs the terms of a European Union bailout. Greece holds new
elections on June 17.  “The situation in Greece is bad and  Spain ’s position is
looking untenable,” said  Sarah Emerson , managing director of
Energy Security Analysis Inc. in Wakefield Massachusetts.
Fundamentals of the oil market also are terrible, she said.  Economic confidence in the euro area  declined in May to the
lowest level since October 2009. An index of executive and
consumer sentiment in the 17-nation euro area fell to 90.6 from
a revised 92.9 in April, the European Commission in Brussels
said today.  The drop in  oil prices  accelerated after a report showed
the number of Americans signing contracts to buy previously
owned homes fell in April by the most in a year. The index of
pending home resales dropped 5.5 percent from the prior month,
figures from the National Association of Realtors showed today
in  Washington .  Trade Flows  “We’re seeing a risk-off trade flow in all the markets
mostly motivated by events in  Europe ,” Evans said. “The oil
market has issues of its own including weak demand and ample
production from a number of sources.”  U.S.  crude output  rose 90,000 barrels a day to 6.24 million
in the week ended May 18, the highest level since February 1999,
last week’s Energy Department report showed. Oil production in
the  Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries  climbed
305,000 barrels to 31.405 million barrels a day in April, the
most since October 2008, according to a Bloomberg survey.  Electronic trading volume on the Nymex was 498,723
contracts as of 4:52 p.m. Volume totaled 452,296 contracts
yesterday, 19 percent below the three-month average. Open
interest was 1.44 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
