The European Commission opened a
probe into whether financial support granted by the Italian
government to bus operator Simet SpA is compatible with the 27-
nation bloc’s state-aid rules.  “On the basis of available information, the commission has
doubts that a public-service compensation is necessary to
retroactively finance services that were provided years ago and
for which it is not clear that there was a genuine public-
service obligation,” the regulator said today in an e-mailed
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
