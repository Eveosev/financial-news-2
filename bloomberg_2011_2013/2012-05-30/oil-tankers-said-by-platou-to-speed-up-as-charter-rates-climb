The fleet of the largest oil tankers
sped up in the last few months as charter rates for the vessels
climbed, according to Oslo-based RS Platou Markets AS.  Very large crude carriers increased speeds by 1.8 percent
to 12.8 knots on average in the period from Feb. 15 to May 17,
Oslo-based RS Platou Economic Research, an arm of  Norway â€™s
largest shipbroker, said in a report today. Still, that was down
more than 5 percent from May 17 of last year, Platou said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
