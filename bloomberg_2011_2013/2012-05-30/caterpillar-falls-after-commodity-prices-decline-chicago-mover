Caterpillar Inc. (CAT) , the world’s largest
maker of construction and mining equipment, dropped the most in
eight trading sessions after declines in commodity prices and
economic confidence in the euro area.  Caterpillar fell 2.5 percent to $90.18 at the close in New
York, the biggest intraday drop since May 17.  The company is a “bellwether for capital goods,” Larry De Maria, a New York-based analyst for William Blair & Co. who has
a buy rating on Caterpillar, said in a telephone interview
today. “The stock is being adversely affected by weaker
sentiment for the macro environment.”  An  index  of executive and consumer sentiment in the euro
area declined to 90.6 in May from a revised 92.9 in April, the
European Commission said today. That missed the 91.9 median of
28 economists’ estimates in a Bloomberg survey. Copper fell to a
20-week low in New York while aluminum and nickel dropped in
London. Lack of visibility on China’s plans for spending on
infrastructure also is hurting the shares, De Maria said.  Caterpillar bet on global economic growth, especially in
 emerging markets , by purchasing U.S. mining-equipment maker
Bucyrus International Inc. in July for $8.8 billion. Caterpillar
also plans to acquire Hong Kong-based  ERA Mining Machinery Ltd. (8043) ,
which makes equipment used in coal production.  To contact the reporter on this story:
