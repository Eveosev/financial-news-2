Ivi Inc. , the online company that
streamed television programs to subscribers without the
authorization of the broadcasters, argued in an appeals court
for a reversal of a ruling that shut its service.  Ivi, based in  Seattle , and its founder, Todd Weaver,
appealed a February 2011 decision by U.S. District Judge Naomi Buchwald in New York granting  CBS Corp. (CBS)  and  Walt Disney Co. (DIS) ’s
ABC a preliminary injunction that stopped Ivi from
retransmitting the broadcasts of their programs on the Internet.  Ivi’s lawyer  Lawrence Graham  told the appeals court in
Manhattan today that its broadcasts were similar to those of
cable TV systems, so the company should be eligible for a
license. Ivi “receives primary signals and passes them over as
a secondary transmission,” which defines a cable system, Graham
said.  “The Internet is not a cable system,” Robert Garrett, a
lawyer for the networks, told the judges. “Anyone with a
television set and an Internet connection could become a cable
system.”  In the lower-court ruling, Buchwald said the broadcasters
had “demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits of
their copyright claim.” The appeals judges are to rule later.  The appeal is WPIX v. Ivi, 11-788,  U.S. Court of Appeals 
for the Second Circuit (Manhattan). The lower-court case is WPIX
v. Ivi Inc., 10-07415, U.S. District Court, Southern District of
 New York  (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
