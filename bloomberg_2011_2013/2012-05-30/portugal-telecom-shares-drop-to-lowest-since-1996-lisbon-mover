Portugal Telecom SGPS SA (PTC) , the
country’s biggest telecommunications company, fell for a seventh
day in Lisbon trading to the lowest price in nearly 16 years as
investors flee from stocks in some euro countries.  “There are still foreign institutional investors that seem
to be selling their positions in the biggest market caps traded
in peripheral countries,” Joao Queiroz, a trader at Oporto-
based Go Bulling, said by telephone. “This is most visible in
companies like Portugal Telecom and EDP.”  Portugal Telecom  dropped  1.3 percent to 3.138 euros, the
lowest closing price since June 1996.  EDP-Energias de Portugal
SA , the country’s biggest utility, fell 0.9 percent to 1.659
euros.  The country’s  PSI-20 (PSI20)  benchmark index has fallen 18 percent
this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
