The  European Central Bank ’s best
contribution to  job creation  is to ensure prices in the 17-
country single currency area remain stable, governing council
member Erkki Liikanen said.  “The functioning of the labor market and monetary policy
are tightly intertwined,” Liikanen, who also heads the Bank of
Finland, said in a speech in Tartu,  Estonia , today. The central
bank’s “primary objective remains to maintain  price stability 
over the medium term. This is the best contribution of monetary
policy to fostering growth and job creation in the euro area.”  The debt crisis has caused unemployment to increase in the
euro area as waning demand prompts companies to cut jobs and
pare spending. The Frankfurt-based bank’s benchmark interest
rate is at a record-low 1 percent. The region’s economy will
contract 0.3 percent this year before growing 1 percent in 2013,
the European Commission forecasts.  The euro area has recovered about 1 million of the about 4
million jobs lost since 2008 and more than 20 percent of people
aged 16 to 24 are unemployed in the region, Liikanen said. Young
workers are the hardest hit as they are used as labor buffers
when employers adjust the workforce, he said.  “Given the magnitude of the youth unemployment problem,
European economies cannot afford to fail in relocating the
unemployed young workers to new jobs,” Liikanen said. “Failure
in this task would imply a lost generation and all the
individual and macroeconomic costs that follow.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
