Two Greek state-controlled lenders
will get another extension to the deadline for reporting their
2011 earnings,  Imerisia  reported, without saying how it got the
information.  Agricultural Bank of Greece SA  and  TT Hellenic Postbank SA (TT) 
had been granted an extension until May 31 because a plan had
not been decided on how to recapitalize them after they took
losses on their holdings of Greek government debt, the Athens-
based newspaper said.  Political paralysis after  Greece  held inconclusive election
on May 6, meaning another election will be held on June 17, has
meant that a recapitalization plan has yet to be  decided,
Imerisia said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
