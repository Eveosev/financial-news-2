Exploitation of shale resources in
the U.K. won’t provide enough natural gas to end the nation’s
reliance on imports from Norway and Qatar, according to Energy
Minister  Charles Hendry .  “We recognize that we’re now net importers of gas, and
even though we can stretch out the use of our own resources from
the U.K. continental shelf, we are going to remain net
importers,” he said today in London. “I don’t see shale gas
developments being able to happen in the United Kingdom on a
timescale that would turn that around.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
