Tyson Foods Inc. (TS) , the largest U.S.
meat processor, was sued by  Finland ’s Neste Oil Oyj for
infringing a patent on motor fuels made partly from chicken fat.  Neste contends  Dynamic Fuels LLC , a joint venture between
Springdale, Arkansas-based Tyson and Tulsa, Oklahoma-based
 Syntroleum Corp. , is making a product that violates a new patent
for  NExBTL diesel fuel .  “Defendants have no license or other authorization to use
the inventions” and owe damages, Neste said in a complaint
filed yesterday in federal court in Wilmington,  Delaware . The
Espoo, Finland-based company has invested 1.5 billion euros
($1.86 billion) in diesel production, according to a statement.  Amanda Burns, a spokeswoman for Syntroleum, wasn’t
immediately available to respond to a phone call and e-mail
seeking comment on the lawsuit. Gary Mickelson, a spokesman for
Tyson, wasn’t immediately able to comment.  The case is  Neste Oil Oyj (NES1V)  v. Dynamic Fuels LLC, 12-cv-662,
U.S. District Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington).  To see the patent, click: 8,187,344.  To contact the reporter on this story:
