Gold is seen gaining in  New York  as
concern that  Europe ’s debt crisis is deepening spurs demand for
the metal as a protection of wealth.  The euro fell to the lowest level since July 2010 versus
the dollar as Spanish bond yields climbed after central bank
Governor Miguel Angel Fernandez Ordonez resigned a month early
amid criticism over the nationalization of Bankia group. Egan-
Jones Ratings Co. downgraded  Spain  yesterday and the European
Commission called for direct euro-area aid for troubled banks.  “Ongoing concerns about the euro, the downgrading of Spain
and the risk of contagion is of course bullish for gold,”
analysts at brokerage GoldCore Ltd. in Dublin said in a report.  Gold for August delivery rose 0.3 percent to $1,555.20 an
ounce by 7:57 a.m. on the Comex in New York. Prices reached a
one-week low of $1,546.10 today and are 6.5 percent lower in May
for a fourth monthly decline, the longest losing run since 2000.
Bullion for immediate delivery was 0.1 percent lower at
$1,554.27 in  London .  The metal is down 0.7 percent this year after 11
consecutive annual increases. Holdings in the SPDR Gold Trust,
the biggest exchange-traded product backed by bullion, were
unchanged at 1,270.3 metric tons yesterday, according to figures
on the company’s website.  Spain backtracked on a plan to use government debt instead
of cash to bail out Bankia, the country’s third-largest lender,
while Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy  struggles to shore up the
nation’s lenders without overburdening public finances.  Silver for July delivery was little changed at $27.78 an
ounce and headed for a third monthly drop. Palladium for
September delivery was 0.4 percent lower at $603.70 an ounce.
Platinum for July delivery fell 1 percent to $1,414.50 an ounce.  To contact the reporters on this story:
