OAO Novatek,  Russia ’s second-biggest
natural gas producer, sank to the weakest level in a year and a
half as the Finance Minister indicated Russia may raise taxes on
oil and gas producers.  The shares retreated 3.1 percent to 288.91 rubles by the
close in Moscow, the lowest since December 2010. The benchmark
Micex Index dropped 1.4 percent to 1,308.30.  “Uncertainty just isn’t helpful, especially when the whole
market has been sold off so aggressively,” Julian Rimmer,
trader at CF Global Trading UK Ltd. in  London , said by e-mail.  The Finance Ministry plans to recapture about 80 percent of
the extra revenue natural-gas producers earn as the state
increases regulated domestic prices, including by canceling some
tax breaks, Anton Siluanov said today in Moscow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
