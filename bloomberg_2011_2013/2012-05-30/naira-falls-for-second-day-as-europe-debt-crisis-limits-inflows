Nigeria ’s naira depreciated against
the dollar as higher Spanish and Italian borrowing costs
suggested the euro region debt crisis is deepening, prompting
some foreign investors to sell riskier assets.  The currency of  Africa ’s biggest oil producer weakened 0.3
percent to 159.7250 per dollar as of 2:05 p.m. in Lagos, the
commercial capital, its biggest decline on a closing basis since
May 25, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “The market is still witnessing a sell-off of securities,
some motivated by the Eurozone crisis and some by inflation
concern,” Sewa Wusu, a currency analyst at Lagos-based Sterling
Capital Ltd., said by phone.  Emerging-market stocks fell for the first time in five days
as Spanish and Italian borrowing costs rose.  Greece  will hold an
election next month that may determine whether it meets bailout
conditions and remains in the euro. Nigerian inflation
accelerated to 12.9 percent in April, the fastest since October
2010, from 12.1 percent in March, the  National Bureau of
Statistics  said May 15.  The  Central Bank of Nigeria  sold $250 million at a foreign-
currency auction on May 28, the highest since Feb. 15 sales. The
regulator will hold the second of its twice-weekly foreign
currency auction today.  The central bank kept its  benchmark   interest rate  unchanged
at 12 percent for a fourth consecutive meeting on May 22 to
bolster the currency and curb inflation.  The yield on Nigeria’s domestic bonds due 2015 rose four
basis points to 15.27 percent, according to the May 28 data on
the Financial Markets Dealers Association  website . Yields on the
Eurobonds due 2021 were unchanged at 5.659 percent in  London .  Ghana’s cedi depreciated 0.5 percent to 1.9020 per dollar,
in Accra, the capital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
