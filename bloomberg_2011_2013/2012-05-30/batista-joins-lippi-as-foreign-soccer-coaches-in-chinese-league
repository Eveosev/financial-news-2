Sergio Batista , who guided
Argentina’s Olympic soccer team to the gold medal in Beijing
four years ago, was hired as head coach of Chinese Super League
team Shanghai Shenhua.  Batista, 49, will lead the team for the remaining matches
of this season, Shenhua said in a  statement  posted on its
website today, without giving contract or salary details.
Shenhua is owned by billionaire Zhu Jun, chairman of Chinese
online game operator and developer  The9 Ltd. (NCTY)   Shenhua offered Batista a six-month contract with a team
option to extend his contract for another two years, Modern
Express, a newspaper run by the official Xinhua News Agency,
 reported  today.  Batista, a member of Argentina’s 1986 World Cup-winning
squad, will take over from a five-man coaching panel headed by
former Chelsea striker Nicolas Anelka, who moved to the club as
a player in January.  China’s elite league is starting to attract top talent
following corruption scandals, match-fixing and mismanagement.
Guangzhou Evergrande, which won the 2011 title, hired Italy’s
2006 World Cup-winning coach Marcello Lippi on May 17 and also
paid German champion Borussia Dortmund 8.5 million euros ($10.6
million) to acquire Paraguayan striker  Lucas Barrios .  Takeshi Okada, who coached Japan to the round of 16 at the
2010  World Cup , was hired by Hangzhou Greentown in December.  Batista, who had a yearlong stint as Argentina coach after
replacing  Diego Maradona  in July 2010, will join a team that’s
ninth in the 16-team Chinese Super League standings with three
victories from 12 of 30 games.  To contact the reporter on this story:
