First City Monument Bank Plc (FCMB) , the
Nigerian lender that acquired Finbank Plc in 2011, had its
longest streak of losses in eight months.  The stock fell for a fifth day, losing 4.8 percent to close
at 3.97 naira in Lagos, the commercial capital, its longest
series of declines since September 2011.  Former shareholders of Finbank sold FCMB stock because they
were disappointed by the conversion of their holdings after the
acquisition, according to Raheem Mohammed, chief operating
officer of Lagos-based Kundila Finance Ltd.  “They are selling to limit their loses,” he said by phone
today.  First City recently distributed to former shareholders
of Finbank their new share certificates, Mohammed said. “They
are just selling on the floor of the exchange.”  The  Central Bank of Nigeria  fired the chief executive
officers of eight of the country’s 24 lenders, including
Finbank, following a debt crisis in 2008 and 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
