Turkey commissioned a “giant
mosque” to sit atop an Istanbul peak that will be visible from
everywhere in the city of 15 million, Prime Minister  Recep Tayyip Erdogan  said.  The Islamic house of worship is one of six new mosques
planned for the eastern half of the city that straddles Europe
and  Asia , Erdogan told supporters at a traditional handworks art
center in Istanbul yesterday, according to state-run Anatolia
news agency.  Work on the mosque on top of the Camlica hill on the
Bosphorus may start in two months, Erdogan said. The complex,
which will also include madrasas, or religious schools, will be
built on 15,000 square meters (50,000 square feet), according to
the premier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
