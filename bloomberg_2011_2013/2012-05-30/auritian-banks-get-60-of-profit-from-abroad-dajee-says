Mauritian lenders earn about 60
percent of their profit from cross-border trade, said Ravin Dajee, outgoing chairman of the Mauritius Bankersâ€™ Association.  Growth in the domestic banking industry will be lower than
last year, he said in a transcript of an interview published by
the Port Louis-based Business Magazine today.  Bad debts are less than 2 percent in the industry, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
