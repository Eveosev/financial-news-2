Hong Kong  stocks  fell, with the  Hang
Seng Index (HSI)  snapping a three-day advance, on a report  China  has
no plans to introduce large-scale stimulus as it did during the
global financial crisis and after  Spain ’s sovereign-credit
rating was cut.  Industrial & Commercial Bank of China Ltd. , the world’s
biggest lender by market value, slid 1.7 percent. Belle
International Holdings Ltd. sank 3.2 percent after the Standard
newspaper reported China’s largest retailer of women’s shoes
expects slower sales growth this year. Esprit Holdings Ltd., a
clothier that counts  Europe  as its biggest market, declined 2.7
percent. Cnooc Ltd., China’s No. 1 offshore oil producer, fell
1.9 percent as crude futures dropped.  “The Chinese authorities do see downside risk to growth
this year,” said Dwyfor Evans, a Hong Kong-based macro
strategist at State Street Global Markets, part of State Street
Corp., which has $1.9 trillion under management. “They will
continue addressing the slowdown, but it’s hard to assess if it
will be enough.”  The Hang Seng Index dropped 1.9 percent to 18,690.22 at the
close, with all but five shares declining in the 48-member
gauge. The equity benchmark is heading for a decline of about 11
percent this month, the most since September, on concern
Europe’s debt crisis will worsen and China’s economic slowdown
is deepening. The fall pared this year’s advance to 1.4 percent.  Trading volumes were about 13 percent higher than the 30-
day moving average, according to data compiled by Bloomberg
News. The  Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  of mainland stocks
decreased 1.7 percent to 9,690.67.  Agricultural Bank  Agricultural Bank of China Ltd., the country’s third-
biggest lender, sank 4 percent to HK$3.12 after the Caixin
magazine reported that Vice President Yang Kun is under
investigation by the Chinese Communist Party’s Central
Commission for Discipline Inspection.  Chinese banks also declined after Xinhua News Agency
reported yesterday that China is seeking to stabilize growth in
the world’s second-largest economy and has no plans to roll out
massive stimulus measures on the scale that it did to coutner
the effects of the global financial crisis in 2008.  Industrial & Commercial Bank of China (1398)  declined 1.7 percent
to HK$4.65. China Construction Bank Corp., the nation’s second-
largest lender, slipped 1.1 percent to HK$5.25.  Belle International (1880)  slipped 3.2 percent to HK$12.72. Same-
store sales in April and May were better than the first quarter
but still lagged last year’s growth, the Standard newspaper
reported, citing Chief Executive Officer Sheng Baijiao. The
company expects sales growth will slow to between 5 percent and
9 percent this year from 15 percent last year, according to the
report.  The benchmark Hang Seng Index has slumped about 14 percent
from this year’s peak, dragging the  value  of shares on the gauge
to 9.5 times estimated earnings on average as of yesterday. That
compares with 12.7 times for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and
10.1 times for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.  Spain Downgrade  Companies that do business in Europe dropped after Rating &
Investment Information Inc cut its sovereign-credit rating for
Spain to A from AA on concern the government will struggle to
reduce its fiscal deficit amid growing downside risks for the
economy.  Esprit sank 2.7 percent to HK$12.46.  Hutchison Whampoa
Ltd. (13) , which operates ports in Germany and Spain, slipped 2.1
percent to HK$65.05. HSBC Holdings Plc, Europe’s biggest lender
by market value, declined 2.8 percent to HK$61.25.  Raw-material producers fell after a gauge of metal prices
in  London  fell for the first time in four days yesterday. Copper
for three-month delivery and crude oil futures headed for a
second day of decline today.  Jiangxi Copper Co., China’s biggest producer of the metal,
slid 1.4 percent to HK$16.74.  Aluminum Corp. of China Ltd. , the
nation’s No. 1 supplier of the light metal, lost 0.3 percent to
HK$3.38. Cnooc fell 1.9 percent to HK$14.20.  Futures on the Hang Seng Index expiring this month dropped
1.4 percent to 18,695. The  HSI Volatility Index (VHSI)  advanced 6.3
percent to 28.12, indicating that traders expect a swing of
about 8.1 percent in the next 30 days.  To contact the reporters on this story:
