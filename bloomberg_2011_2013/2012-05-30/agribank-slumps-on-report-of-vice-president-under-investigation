Agricultural Bank of China Ltd. , the
nation’s third-largest lender by market value, fell the most in
six months on a report that Vice President Yang Kun is under
investigation.  Yang is assisting investigations by “relevant
authorities,” and this won’t affect operations, the bank said
in a statement to the Shanghai stock exchange today, after the
market closed. It didn’t elaborate. Yang’s conduct is being
examined by the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection,
Caixin magazine reported on its website earlier, citing people
it didn’t identify. The commission is responsible for curbing
corruption and other crimes by Communist Party members.  Yang didn’t answer a call to his office or respond to an e-
mail seeking comment. He was barred from leaving the country
about three weeks ago, Caixin said.  Shares of Agricultural Bank fell 4 percent, the most since
Nov. 23, to close at HK$3.12 in  Hong Kong . The benchmark  Hang
Seng Index  declined 1.9 percent.  China , where a leadership transition is set to begin this
year, has stepped up efforts to ensure party loyalty and clean
up corruption after Politburo member Bo Xilai was suspended on
accusations of “serious violations of discipline.” His wife,
Gu Kailai, was taken into custody for involvement in a murder.
Premier  Wen Jiabao  said the government may lose its grip on
power unless it fights harder against graft.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
