Eastern Platinum Ltd. (ELR) , a producer of
the metal in South Africa, stopped funding for the development
of its Mareesburg mine and Kennedy’s Vale processing plant after
prices fell and costs rose.  The Mareesburg/KV project is about 20 percent complete and
was on schedule to be commissioned in the first quarter,
Eastplats said today in a statement. The Vancouver-based company
said it will reassess the economics of the project, which is
northeast of Johannesburg, if it sees a sustained recovery in
the global economic environment and metals prices.  Platinum prices have declined 24 percent in  New York  in the
past 12 months. The company is also dealing with “unrelenting”
operating cost inflation, unfavorable currency exchange rates
and concerns about reliable power supply at its South African
operations, Eastplats said.  There is “little or no fundamental recovery or supply
reduction forecast in the near to medium term” for platinum-
group metals, the company said. “A near-term recovery in PGM
prices to sustainably appropriate levels is unlikely.”  Eastplats dropped 14 percent to 24 cents at the close in
Toronto.  The shares  have plunged 56 percent this year.  South Africa  is the world’s largest producer of platinum,
used in devices that cut vehicle emissions and to make jewelry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
