The 30-stock  Micex Index (INDEXCF)  fell for the
first time in three days, retreating 1.4 percent to 1,308.30 by
the close in Moscow.  The following were among the most active stocks in the
Russian market today. Stock symbols are in parenthesis.  Federal Grid Co. (FEES RX) lost 5.7 percent to 18.07
kopeks, the lowest level since April 2009. OAO RusHydro (HYDR
RX) declined 3.2 percent to 78.89 kopeks. The high-voltage
transmission monopoly and  Russia ’s biggest hydropower generator
tumbled after Vedomosti reported state-owned Rosneftegaz may
spend as much as 130 billion rubles ($4 billion) to buy new
shares of Russia’s state companies in the energy sector.
Issuance of new shares may lead to the dilution of minority
shareholders, according the Alfa Bank analyst Alexander Kornilov
and ING Groep NV’s Igor Goncharov.  OAO Novatek (NVTK RX) dropped 3.1 percent to 288.91 rubles,
the lowest level since December 2010. Russia’s second-biggest
natural gas producer fell as the Finance Minister Anton Siluanov
indicated Russia may raise taxes on oil and gas producers.  OAO Severstal (CHMF RX) declined 1.3 percent to 376.40
rubles. Bank of America Corp. cut Russia’s second-largest steel
producer to neutral from buy, reflecting “lower-than-expected
spot prices” and “lower pricing power” in the steel sector.  TNK-BP (TNBP RX) declined 2.6 percent to 81.8 rubles. BP
Plc’s Russian venture retreated after  Fitch Ratings  said the
company may face a “crisis” after the oil firm’s billionaire
shareholder  Mikhail Fridman  resigned as chief executive officer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
