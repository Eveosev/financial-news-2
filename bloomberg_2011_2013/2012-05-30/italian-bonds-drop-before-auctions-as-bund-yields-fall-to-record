Italy ’s bond yields surged to a four-
month high as the nation missed its maximum target for sales of
five- and 10-year securities, stoking concern that  Europe ’s
financial woes are denting investor appetite for the debt.  Germany ’s two-year yield reached zero for the first time.
Five-, 10- and 30-year German bond yields fell to records as
 economic confidence  in the euro area declined more than analysts
forecast in May to the lowest in 2 1/2 years. Spanish bonds
slumped, driving five-year yields to more than 6 percent for the
first time since November, after Bank of  Spain  Governor Miguel Angel Fernandez Ordonez quit before his term expired amid
criticism over the nationalization of Bankia group.  “Investors are becoming increasingly reticent to buy any
more debt from these countries,” said  John Wraith , a fixed-
income strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch in London.
“Italy just about got the supply away. It echoes what we’re
seeing in Spain and the ongoing worries about where this is
heading. Things aren’t going to get better on their own.”  The Italian 10-year yield advanced 17 basis points, or 0.17
percentage point, to 5.93 percent at 5 p.m. London time. The
rate reached 6.01 percent, the highest since Jan. 31. The 5
percent security due March 2022 tumbled 1.155, or 11.55 euros
per 1,000-euro ($1,242) face amount, to 93.755. The  five-year 
note yield jumped as much as 42 basis points to 5.68 percent,
before easing to 5.56 percent.  Italian Auction  Italy sold 5.73 billion euros of five- and 10-year debt,
falling short of the maximum target of 6.25 billion euros. The
average yield on the five-year security was 5.66 percent, up
from 4.86 percent at an auction of similar-maturity debt on
April 27. The 10-year yield was 6.03 percent, from 5.84 percent
last month.  “The auction results were not terribly satisfying,” said
Achilleas Georgolopoulos, a fixed-income strategist at Lloyds
Banking Group Plc in  London . “The market grasped that they only
raised 5.7 billion euros. Italian spreads are clearly
widening.”  German 10-year yields fell nine basis points to 1.27
percent after dropping to 1.261 percent, the least since
Bloomberg began tracking the data in 1989. German two-year
yields slipped to zero, five-year yields declined to 0.362
percent, while 30-year rates slid to 1.802 percent.  Finnish and Dutch 10-year rates also fell to all-time lows
as investors sought the euro-area’s safest assets.  Treasury 10-year note yields dropped to 1.6254 percent, the
lowest ever. The euro fell to the least in almost two years
against the dollar, declining as much as 0.9 percent to $1.2386.  Confidence Ebbs  An index of executive and consumer sentiment in the 17-
nation euro area fell to 90.6 in May from a revised 92.9 in
April, the European Commission in Brussels said today. That’s
the lowest since October 2009 and below the 91.9 median forecast
of 28 economists in a Bloomberg survey.  Ordonez met Spanish Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy  yesterday,
and the premier backed his decision to leave on June 10 instead
of July 12, the Madrid-based Bank of Spain said in an e-mailed
statement.  Spain’s 10-year yield climbed 21 basis points to 6.66
percent. It reached 6.70 percent, the most since Nov. 28. The
two-year rate surged as much as 50 basis points to 5.13 percent,
while five-year yields rose to an intraday high of 6.21 percent.  The yield difference, or spread, between Spanish 10-year
 government bonds  and similar-maturity German bunds widened to as
much as 5.41 percentage points, the most in the euro era.  It is “increasingly likely” that Spain will ask for
external assistance, according to David Mackie, chief European
economist at JPMorgan Chase & Co. in London.  Bailout Cost  A bailout package from the European Union and the
 International Monetary Fund  that covers the government’s funding
needs through the end of 2014 and includes cash for a bank
recapitalization would amount to around 350 billion euros, he
wrote in an e-mailed report to investors today.  The European Commission, the European Union’s central
regulator, called for direct euro-area aid for troubled banks in
policy recommendations released today.  Volatility on Spanish government bonds was the highest in
euro-area markets today followed by Italy, according to measures
of 10-year bonds, two- and 10-year yield spreads and credit-
default swaps.  The cost of insuring against default on Spanish sovereign
bonds rose to a record. Credit-default swaps linked to Spain’s
debt climbed 25 basis points to a 585, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  German bonds maturing in more than a year returned 2.2
percent this month, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg
and the European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies.
That’s the most since they gained 3.1 percent in December.
Spanish debt dropped 3.7 percent, while Italian securities lost
1.7 percent, the indexes show.  -- Editors:  Paul Dobson , Nicholas Reynolds  To contact the reporters on this story:
