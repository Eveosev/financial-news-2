Slovakia will introduce a 4.2 percent
surcharge on the income-tax rate for regulated companies such as
in the energy and telecommunication sectors, Sme reported citing
Prime Minister  Robert Fico .  All companies with a profit of at least 3 million euros
($3.74 million) and whose main activities are regulated by the
state will be subject of the additional tax, Sme said. The
surcharge will be levied on top of a regular income tax, which
the government plans to raise to 23 percent from 19 percent, the
newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
