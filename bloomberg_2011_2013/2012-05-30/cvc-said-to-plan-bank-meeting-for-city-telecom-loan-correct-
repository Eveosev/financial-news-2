CVC Capital Partners Ltd. is holding
a bank meeting in  Hong Kong  June 1 to discuss terms of a HK$2.5
billion loan backing the acquisition of the telecommunications
assets from City Telecom (HK) Ltd., according to three people
familiar with the matter.  JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Standard Chartered Plc have been
hired by CVC to underwrite and arrange the five-year facility,
said the people, who asked not to be identified because the
details are private. Some banks have been asked to commit the
equivalent of about $40 million to $50 million to the loan,
another person familiar with the matter said on April 18.  Edward Moore, an external spokesman for CVC at public
relations firm Brunswick Group LLP in  London  didnâ€™t immediately
respond to an e-mail seeking comment on the bank meeting.  To contact the reporter on this story:
