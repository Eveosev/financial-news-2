France may need to take
“significant” steps to bring its  budget deficit  under European
limits next year, the European Commission said, curbing new
President  Francois Hollande ’s room to spur the economy.  The commission, the enforcer of euro fiscal rules, said the
pressure is for savings in 2013 since the 2012 budget Hollande
inherited from predecessor  Nicolas Sarkozy  is on the right path.  France is under a European Union order to narrow the budget
shortfall to 3 percent of gross domestic product next year or
potentially face sanctions as part of a crisis-driven crackdown
on deficits. The deficit was 5.2 percent of GDP in 2011.  “Although this year’s target of 4.4 percent of GDP appears
achievable, the distance to the 3 percent of GDP threshold
remains significant,” the commission said in policy
recommendations released today in Brussels. “The consolidation
strategy remains to be further specified and correcting the
excessive deficit by 2013 may require additional efforts.”  France ’s economy was stagnant in the first quarter, giving
weight to Hollande’s campaign pledges to stimulate growth while
leaving him with little fiscal leeway to make good on those
promises.  To contact the reporter on this story:
