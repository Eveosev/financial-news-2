South Africa ’s Public Investment
Corp., which manages state pensions, is “comfortable” with its
investment in debt issued by the state-owned roads agency, Chief
Executive Officer Elias Masilela said.  “From the input we have gotten, we are comfortable with
our investment,” Masilela said today in an interview in Arusha,
Tanzania. “To the best of our knowledge, the position of the
government and Sanral is that they have to meet their
obligation.”  The South African National Road Agency SOC Ltd. is using
funds meant to back the debt to pay for operating expenses
because the government delayed charging tolls on roads around
Johannesburg after protests from unions and a court order,
Finance Minister  Pravin Gordhan  said last week. The government
will decide later how much money is needed to back the company’s
debt, he said.  PIC owns 17.7 billion rand ($2.1 billion) of Sanral debt,
the company said March 19 in an e-mailed statement.  The government lent Sanral 5.7 billion rand to reduce the
37 billion rand in debt the company has because of the court
order blocking the tolls, Gordhan said.  -- With assistance by Sikonathi Mantshantsha in Johannesburg.
