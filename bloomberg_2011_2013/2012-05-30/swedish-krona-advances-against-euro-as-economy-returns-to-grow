The Swedish krona strengthened
against the euro, paring a third monthly decline, after a
government report showing the economy returned to growth in the
first quarter boosted demand for the country’s currency.  The krona trimmed losses versus the dollar after  Statistics
Sweden  said gross domestic product grew by 0.8 percent in the
three months through March after contracting a revised 1 percent
the previous quarter. Growth was estimated at 0.2 percent in the
quarter in a Bloomberg  survey  of 15 economists.  “The Swedish economy is doing considerably better than
feared,” Kjersti Haugland, senior economist at  DNB ASA (DNB)  in Oslo,
wrote in an e-mailed note to clients. “Today’s numbers reduce
the risk of more rate cuts from the Riksbank.”  The krona rose 0.2 percent to 8.9814 per euro at 11:02 a.m.
in  Stockholm , reducing this month’s decline to 0.9 percent. The
currency was 0.3 percent lower at 7.2231 per dollar after
weakening as much as 0.6 percent before the report was released.  To contact the reporter on this story:
