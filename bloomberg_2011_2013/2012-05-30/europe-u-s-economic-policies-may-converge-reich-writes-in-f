European political realities may be
pushing the continent closer to the U.S. model, where a
declining share of total income is going to workers and an
increasing amount to profits,  Robert Reich , secretary of labor
under President  Bill Clinton , wrote in the Financial Times.  While German Chancellor Angela Merkel has begun to speak
about spurring growth, she remains opposed to fostering it
through more spending and wants to accomplish it through
structural reforms, which could involve things like “giving
companies more freedom to hire and fire,” and to outsource jobs
and be less restricted by regulation, Reich wrote.  “This is of course the American model -- which has been
fueling corporate profits at the same time as it depresses
wages,” the professor of public policy at the  University of
California  at Berkeley wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
