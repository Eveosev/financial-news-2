President  Barack Obama ’s deputy
national security adviser called Syrian claims that a weekend
massacre in the Houla region was carried out by foreign-backed
groups “a lie.”  Denis McDonough  told the U.S.-Islamic World Forum in Doha,
Qatar, today that the U.S. is working with “urgency” to
increase pressure on the Syrian government. He rejected the
government’s attempt to blame outsiders for the killings and
repeated the U.S. stance that the regime of Bashar al-Assad has
lost legitimacy.  “This is a lie,” McDonough said. “We know that the
regime controls the actions” of vigilante groups.  According to United Nations estimates, the killings in the
Houla region, in western  Syria , left 108 people dead including
49 children.  “The longer this goes on, the more extreme it’s going to
get and the greater negative impact it will have on the region
and on our interests,” McDonough said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
