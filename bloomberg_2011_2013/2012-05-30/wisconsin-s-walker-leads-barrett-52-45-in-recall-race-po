Wisconsin Republican Governor  Scott Walker  leads Democratic  Milwaukee  Mayor Tom Barrett by 7
percentage points in the state’s June 5 recall election.  Walker widened his edge over Barrett, 52 percent to 45
percent, in a replay of the 2010 governor’s race, according to
the poll released today by Milwaukee’s Marquette Law School. The
school’s May 16 survey had Walker up 50 percent to 44 percent.  “Very little has changed,” said poll director  Charles Franklin .  Walker, whose curbs on public-employee collective
bargaining last year provoked the recall campaign, received a 51
percent approval rating while 46 percent disapproved. Next
week’s vote is only the third ouster election of a state chief
executive in U.S. history.  The poll of 600 likely voters was conducted May 23 through
26 with a margin of error of plus or minus 4.1 percentage
points.  Walker, 44, has raised about $30 million for the recall,
including more than $5 million in the past month, according to
fundraising reports. Barrett, 58, has reported receiving $3.9
million since entering the race Mar. 30. The combined total of
contributions, much from out-of-state interests, has already
exceeded the $37.4 million spent in the 2010 governor’s race.  To contact the reporter on this story:
