 The number of Internet connections
will reach 18.9 billion by 2016, up from 10.3 billion in 2011,
driven by a proliferation of smartphones, tablets and other
handheld devices, according to an annual survey by Cisco Systems
Inc.  The number of connections works out to almost 2.5 for each
person on Earth in 2016.  India  is expected to have the fastest
rate of Internet traffic growth, followed by  Brazil  and  South
Africa , the survey found.  “More and more mobile devices are coming on the network
that are causing this growth,” said Doug Webster, a vice-
president for San Jose-based Cisco who discussed the report at a
news briefing today in  Washington .  In 2016, the volume of Internet traffic is expected to be
measured for the first time in zettabytes -- or 1 trillion
gigabytes, Webster said.  Traffic that year is expected to reach 1.3 zettabytes, or
110 exabytes per month, almost a fourfold increase from about 31
exabytes per month in 2011, the survey found.  That volume will result from the use of more devices, more
users, more bandwidth available for transmission and greater use
of video for entertainment and business, Webster said.  The  Cisco (CSCO)  study measures traffic expected to travel over
public and private networks, including the Internet, managed IP
and mobile data traffic from consumers and business users.  To contact the reporter on this story:
