A Russian partnership has agreed to
buy a controlling stake in the St. Petersburg stock exchange to
create a rival for the Moscow-based  Micex-RTS exchange .  The acquisition is expected to be completed next year,
according to Sergey Vasilyev, a member of the board of directors
of NP RTS, the non-commercial partnership that is executing the
deal, and president of the Russian Funds investment group. NP
RTS already owns 20 percent of the exchange, Vasilyev said.  “We realize that it doesn’t make sense to compete with the
Micex-RTS for liquidity and products the exchange has a monopoly
in,” Vasilyev said by phone. “We plan to focus on developing
those products and technologies that are absent or poorly
represented on the exchange.”  The Micex-RTS currently settles trades on the day of the
transaction, so-called T+0, and wants to move to either allowing
two days for settlement of transactions, like Deutsche Boerse AG
or to three days, like U.S. exchanges, the Micex-RTS President
Ruben Aganbegyan said in an April 17 interview.  The Micex-RTS exchange, which plans to debut a central
securities depositary in July, is expected to remain the main
clearing and deposit center, Vasilyev said by phone. The
majority of the St. Petersburg exchange staff will be in Moscow,
Vasilyev said.  Lev Bystrov, a press representative at the Micex-RTS,
declined to comment when reached by phone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
