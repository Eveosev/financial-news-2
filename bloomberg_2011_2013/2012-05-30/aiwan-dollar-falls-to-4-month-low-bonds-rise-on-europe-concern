Taiwan ’s dollar fell to a four-month
low and government bonds gained as investors cut holdings of the
island’s stocks on concern Europe’s debt crisis will worsen and
damp Asian growth.  The local dollar weakened 1.8 percent this month as foreign
investors sold $3.7 billion more local stocks than they bought,
according to exchange data. Official reports last week showed
industrial production dropped for a second month in April and
the jobless rate increased.  Stock indexes  declined across  Asia 
today after the Bank of  Spain  said yesterday the country’s
economy will sink further into recession.  “Taiwan’s fundamentals aren’t looking good,” said Eric Hsing, a bond trader at First Securities Inc. in Taipei.
“Pessimism from  Europe  could drive down yields further.”  Taiwan’s dollar weakened 0.4 percent to NT$29.762 against
its U.S. counterpart, according to Taipei Forex Inc. That’s the
lowest level since Jan. 31. The currency’s one-month implied
volatility, a measure of exchange-rate swings traders use to
price options, gained 11 basis points to 5.75 percent.  The yield on the government’s 1.25 percent bonds due March
2022 fell two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 1.24
percent, according to Gretai Securities Market. The  overnight
interbank lending rate  was little changed at 0.514 percent,
according to a weighted average compiled by the Taiwan Interbank
Money Center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
