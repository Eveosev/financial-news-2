Cocoa demand will rise by a
“moderate” 2 percent to 3 percent this season, according to
Credit Suisse Group AG’s private banking unit.  “Demand from emerging countries should offset weakness in
Western markets somewhat,”  Tobias Merath , head of commodity
research at the bank, wrote in a report e-mailed today.  Global cocoa production will fall this year because of dry
weather in West Africa, the top growing region, the bank said.
Carryover stockpiles from the 2010-11 season will be “more than
sufficient to keep the market well supplied.” Cocoa production
was 343,000 metric tons higher than consumption last year,
according to a statement e-mailed from the  International Cocoa
Organization  in  London  today.  “Overall neither supply nor demand should put significant
pressure on the global cocoa market balance, and we see limited
upside and downside risks in the medium term,” Merath said.  Cocoa traded on ICE Futures U.S. in  New York  will be at
$2,250 a metric ton in three months and at $2,300 a ton in 12
months, according to the bank’s forecast. The commodity was down
2.3 percent to $2,062 a ton by 10:12 a.m. in New York.  Arabica coffee prices, which have dropped 28 percent this
year, are likely to fall further as roasters don’t need to buy
until the end of summer, the bank said.  “Physical market tightness should now start to ease,” the
bank said, forecasting prices in New York at $1.70 a pound in
three months and $1.60 a pound in 12 months. Coffee was down 1.4
percent to $1.631 a pound in New York.  The development of an El Nino could result in lower sugar
production in  Thailand , the second-biggest exporter, and  India ,
the second-largest producer, according to the report.  “This season’s surplus could be drawn down fairly quickly
if Asian sugar production was to disappoint,” Merath said.  Sugar will be at 19 cents a pound in New York in three
months and at 18 cents a pound in 12 months, the bank forecast,
adding that the “price adjustment is probably over.” The
sweetener was up 0.4 percent at 19.57 cents a pound in New York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
