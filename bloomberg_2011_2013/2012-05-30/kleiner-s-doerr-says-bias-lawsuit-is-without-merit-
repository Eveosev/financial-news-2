John Doerr , the lead partner at
Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, said a lawsuit accusing the
venture capital firm of sexual discrimination is “without
merit,” based on the results of an independent investigation.  Kleiner Perkins was sued on May 10 by Ellen Pao, a partner
at the firm and employee there since 2005, claiming unfair
treatment of female employees. In the complaint, Pao said she
was denied promotion and suffered the loss of compensation and
other employment benefits because of the firm’s actions.  “We have taken great care to treat this situation
seriously, swiftly and with integrity,” Doerr said today in a
 statement . “The investigator’s report concluded that the
allegations are without merit and that our firm does not
discriminate on the basis of gender.”  Doerr pointed to a number of women-led startups that  Menlo
Park , California-based Kleiner Perkins has backed, including e-
commerce sites  One King’s Lane Inc.  and Rent the Runway Inc. and
online-education company Coursera Inc. He also said the firm has
a dozen female partners.  The case is Ellen Pao v. Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers
LLC And Does 1-20, CGC-12-520719, Superior Court of the State of
 California  ( San Francisco ).  To contact the reporter on this story:
