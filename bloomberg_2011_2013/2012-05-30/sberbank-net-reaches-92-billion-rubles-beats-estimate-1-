OAO Sberbank,  Russia ’s largest
lender, said net income in the first quarter rose 6 percent,
beating analysts’ estimates on increased fee revenue and growth
in lending.  Net income climbed for the first three months to 92.2
billion rubles ($2.84 billion) from 86.8 billion rubles in the
same period last year, the Moscow-based company said in a
statement on its website. Profit beat the 87 billion-ruble
consensus of 15 analysts polled by Bloomberg.  Sberbank said net interest income and net fee and
commission income accounted for 92.5 percent of total operating
income before provisions for loan impairment. Net interest
income, the difference between what a bank earns from lending
and what it pays on deposits, jumped 20.5 percent to 156.3
billion rubles in the first quarter. The share of non-performing
loans fell to 4.8 percent of total lending by March 31, compared
with 4.9 percent at the beginning of the year.  Russia plans to sell 7.6 percent of Sberbank by as early as
September as Prime Minister  Dmitry Medvedev  expedites the
government’s privatization program, a person with knowledge of
the matter said yesterday. Dexia SA, the Franco-Belgian owner of
 Turkey ’s  Denizbank AS (DENIZ) , said on May 24 that it has entered into
exclusive negotiations with Sberbank to sell the unit.  Sberbank is seeking growth outside the former  Soviet Union 
as some western European lenders sell their subsidiaries in
eastern  Europe  and Turkey to comply with capital rules or state
aid conditions. It acquired most of Oesterreichische
Volksbanken’s eastern European business for 505 million euros
($635 million) in February to expand in the region.  Sberbank’s  shares  in Moscow slumped 1.3 percent to 83
rubles by 10:50 a.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
