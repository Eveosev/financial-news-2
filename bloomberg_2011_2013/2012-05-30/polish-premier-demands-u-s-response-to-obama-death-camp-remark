Poland  demanded a “strong and clear
response” from the U.S. after President  Barack Obama ’s mention
of a “Polish death camp” while honoring a Pole who told the
world about the Holocaust.  “We can’t accept such words in Poland, even if they are
spoken by a leader of an allied country,” Prime Minister Donald Tusk told journalists in Warsaw today. “Saying Polish
concentration camps is as if there was no German responsibility,
no Hitler.”  Since, 2004 Poland has sought clarifications from several
news outlets for the use of a phrase “Polish concentration
camps” that were run by the Nazis during the country’s
occupation in the World War II, according to the Foreign
Ministry’s website. The government has convinced publications
including the Wall Street Journal, the  New York  Times and the
San Francisco Chronicle to stop using the phrase.  “The president misspoke -- he was referring to Nazi death
camps in German occupied Poland,” Tommy Vietor, a spokesman for
the White House National Security Council, said in a statement.
“We regret this misstatement.”  The  text  of Obama’s remarks on the White House website
hasn’t been corrected as of today.  “The White House will apologize for this outrageous
mistake,” Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski wrote on his
Twitter Inc. account. “It’s a shame that such a momentous
ceremony has been overshadowed by ignorance and incompetence.”  Medal of Freedom  Obama posthumously awarded Jan Karski the Medal of Freedom,
the nation’s highest civilian honor, at a ceremony in  Washington 
yesterday, saying the Polish officer “illuminated one of the
darkest chapters of history” as he “repeatedly crossed enemy
line to document the face of genocide, and courageously voiced
tragic truths all the way to President Roosevelt.”  Obama’s error “should not detract from the clear intention
to honor Mr. Karski and those brave Polish citizens who stood on
the side of human dignity in the face of tyranny,” Vietor said
in his statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
