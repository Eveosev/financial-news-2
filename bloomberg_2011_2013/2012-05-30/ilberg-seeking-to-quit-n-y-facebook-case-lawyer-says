Milberg LLP is seeking to withdraw
from  Paul Ceglia ’s lawsuit claiming half the  Facebook Inc. (FB) 
holdings of Chief Executive Officer  Mark Zuckerberg , according
to Dean Boland, another of Ceglia’s lawyers.  The move, which needs approval by the judge overseeing the
case, comes less than three months after Milberg took up
Ceglia’s cause. At least four other law firms have already
departed Ceglia’s team. In June 2011, DLA Piper LLP and Lippes
Mathias Wexler Friedman LLP withdrew from representing him after
less than three months on the job.  Boland, a Lakewood, Ohio, attorney, said Milberg’s proposed
departure stems from differences over strategy among Ceglia’s
lawyers.  Sanford Dumain, the chairman of Milberg’s executive
committee and the lead lawyer on the team representing Ceglia,
didn’t immediately respond to e-mails and a phone message
seeking comment.  In his lawsuit, pending in federal court in Buffalo,  New
York , Ceglia claims that a 2003 contract he signed with
Zuckerberg made them partners in the start of Facebook, now the
world’s biggest social network. Menlo Park, California-based
Facebook has called Ceglia’s claim a fraud.  Orin Snyder, who represents Facebook in the suit, didn’t
immediately return a phone message seeking comment on Milberg’s
decision to withdraw.  The case is Ceglia v. Zuckerberg, 10-cv-00569, U.S.
District Court, Western District of New York (Buffalo).  To contact the reporter on this story:
