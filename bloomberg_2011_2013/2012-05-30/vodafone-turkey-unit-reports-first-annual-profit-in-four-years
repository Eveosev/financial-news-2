Vodafone Group Plc (VOD) ’s Turkish unit
recorded its first annual operating profit in four years, Serpil Timuray, chief executive of Turkish operations, said.  Vodafone Turkey had an operating profit of 3.5 million
liras ($1.9 million) in the fiscal year that ended March 31,
compared with a loss of 174 million liras in the previous year,
Timuray said at a news conference in Istanbul today.  Europe’s biggest telephone company, which bought the
Turkish unit for $4.55 billion in 2005, didn’t break down the
profit figure for Turkey operations when it announced full
fiscal year results May 22.  Vodafone Turkey competes with  Turkcell Iletisim Hizmetleri
AS (TCELL) , the country’s biggest mobile-phone operator, and Avea
Iletisim Hizmetleri AS, a unit of  Turk Telekomunikasyon AS. (TTKOM)   To contact the reporter on this story:
