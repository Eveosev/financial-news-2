Viswanathan Anand of  India  topped
Boris Gelfand of Israel in a series of rapid games in Moscow
today to retain the World Chess Federation championship.  Anand won one game and three were drawn, after the players
had broken even in recent days with one victory each in a dozen
games with slower time controls.  In the last rapid game, Gelfand needed to win with the
black pieces to even the match and keep it going. Anand held the
draw, ending the contest.  “I simply held on for dear life,” Anand said at a press
conference on the Internet. The match was seen on the Internet
through  The Week in Chess website  live-games service.  To contact the writer on this story:
