Longhorn  Kenya  Ltd., the educational-
materials publisher, jumped 14 percent after its debut on the
Nairobi Securities Exchange.  The stock rose 15 percent to 16.15 shillings by the close
of trading. The company listed 58.5 million shares today at a
price of 14 shillings.  “It was optimally priced at 14 shillings because it has
been trading over the counter at 100 shillings; it was split
into five which means the listing price should actually have
been 20 shillings,” Irungu Nyakera, managing director of
Nairobi-based NIC Capital Ltd., said in a phone interview today.  Full-year profit surged more than fivefold to 136.3 million
shillings ($1.59 million), the company said May 28. Sales jumped
to 1.1 billion shillings in the 12 months through June 2011 from
526.9 million shillings a year earlier.  Longhorn Kenya, which has operations in Tanzania and
 Uganda , began selling educational books to Malawi earlier this
year, Chairman Francis Nyammo said during the listing, the first
on the Kenyan market this year.  “The company’s growth will be driven by diversification of
product and market,” Nyammo said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
