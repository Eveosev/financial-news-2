National Mining Corp., a closely held
company majority-owned by Saudi billionaire Mohammed al-Amoudi,
said it has 128 tons of gold ready to be mined at its Okote
project in south  Ethiopia .  “With very little exploration work and by undertaking a
definitive feasibility study the reserve could be turned into a
big mine,” the Addis Ababa-based company said in a statement e-
mailed today.  Okote, which is in the Oromia region, could contain a total
of 454 tons, it said. The site may produce around 10 tons a year,
almost doubling Ethiopia’s output of the precious metal, NMC
said in March.  Extraction will require investment of $121.5 million and
the mine may generate profits of $4.3 billion for the company
over 20 years, NMC said. It said the government will receive $2
billion over two decades in tax and royalty payments.  Ethiopia, the world’s  third-biggest coffee grower , is
diversifying its economy to reduce its reliance on agriculture,
which accounts for 43 percent of gross domestic product
according to African Development Bank data.  Gold exports surged 40 percent to $405.3 million in the
first nine months of the fiscal year that ends July 7.  To contact the reporter on this story:
