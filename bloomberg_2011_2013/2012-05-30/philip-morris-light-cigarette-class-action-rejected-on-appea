A class action against  Altria Group
Inc. (MO) ’s Philip Morris over “light” cigarettes was thrown out on
appeal by the Minnesota Supreme Court, which said the claims in
the lawsuit were barred by a 1998 settlement.  The court ruled today that the settlement, in a separate
case filed by the state’s attorney general in 1994, barred
claims by smokers under Minnesota’s consumer protection law. The
dismissed suit was filed in 2001 by Gregory Curtis on behalf of
all smokers who had bought Philip Morris’s Marlboro Lights in
Minnesota since 1971.  “We conclude that the 1998 settlement agreement entered
into by the state AG and Philip Morris expressly released and
barred respondents’ consumer protection claims,” Justice
Christopher Dietzen wrote in an opinion today.  Curtis claimed Philip Morris misled consumers into
believing that “light” cigarettes were less harmful than
regular cigarettes. Altria, based in Richmond,  Virginia , is the
biggest U.S. cigarette maker.  The case is Curtis v. Altria Group Inc., A10-215, Minnesota
Supreme Court ( St. Paul ).  To contact the reporter on this story:
