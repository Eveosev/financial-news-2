Gold’s backing for the dollar fell as
the precious metal’s price slumped this year and more declines
may be in store, according to Richard X. Bove, an analyst at
Rochdale Securities LLC.  The CHART OF THE DAY compares the market value of the U.S.
Treasury’s gold holdings with the M2 gauge of  money supply  for
each year since 1959, as Bove did in a report yesterday.  The Treasury owned metal valued at 4.12 cents for every
dollar of M2 as of yesterday, down from 4.25 cents at the end of
last year. M2 consists of cash,  bank deposits  and money-market
fund assets. The ratio surpassed an average of 3.4 cents for the
53-year period, as cited in the report.  “These numbers would tend to suggest that the price is
closer to a top, in dollar terms, than a bottom,” wrote Bove,
who is based in Lutz, Florida. Gold for immediate delivery was
0.6 percent lower for the year after erasing a 14 percent gain
through Feb. 28. It’s headed for a fourth consecutive monthly
loss, the longest streak since 1999.  Treasury holdings of gold have climbed from a 2001 low of
1.3 cents for each dollar, according to year-end data based on
market prices. The precious metal rose each year, producing a
more than fivefold gain. The advance exceeded M2’s 82 percent
growth for the period, as compiled by the  Federal Reserve .  The government owns 261.5 million ounces of the metal,
including 13.4 million that are stored at the Fed’s  New York 
branch, according to the  Treasury . The rest is held mainly at
Fort Knox, Kentucky;  West Point , New York; and Denver. These
holdings are valued at $42.2222 an ounce by law.  To contact the reporter on this story:
