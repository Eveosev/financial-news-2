Farmers in  Russia ’s southern
Stavropol region completed sowing winter and spring crops on 2.8
million hectares (6.9 million acres), the governor’s press
service  said .  Grains cover two-thirds of the seeded area, according to a
statement on the region’s website. Locusts infested about
340,000 hectares of local fields and farmers have spread
pesticides over 240,000 hectares, it showed.  Stavropol is one of Russia’s main grain-growing areas and
last year reaped 8.2 million metric tons, or 8.7 percent of the
total national crop, according to figures from the state
statistics service.  To contact the reporter on this story:
