The yen gained against most of its
major peers as turmoil in  Spain ’s banking sector added to signs
 Europe ’s debt crisis is spreading, boosting investor demand for
safer assets.  Japan’s currency reached the strongest level in more than
three months versus the dollar as the country’s  benchmark bond
yield  fell to the lowest since 2003 and U.S. rates plunged to
record lows as shares retreated globally. The euro slid for an
eighth-straight day against the yen, the longest losing streak
in almost two years, before data tomorrow forecast to show
European manufacturing shrank and the jobless rate in the common
currency area increased.  “Fear is moving the market,” said  Masafumi Yamamoto ,
chief currency strategist in Tokyo at  Barclays Capital . “It
started from worries over  Greece  and then Spain. Investors have
no choice other than to buy the yen and the dollar as they sell
off other currencies.”  The yen rose 0.1 percent to 97.69 per euro as of 7:07 a.m.
in  London , poised for its longest stretch of daily gains since
June 2010. The Japanese currency climbed 0.3 percent to 78.81
per dollar, after earlier touching 78.71, the strongest since
Feb. 16. The euro dropped to $1.2358, its weakest since July
2010, before rising 0.2 percent to $1.2394.  The shared currency reached $1.1877 in June of 2010, which
was the lowest level in four years, after escalating concern
Greece was unable to pay its debts led to the bloc’s first
bailout. Since its inception in 1999, the euro has traded as low
as 82.30 U.S. cents, in 2000, and as high as $1.6038 in July
2008.  ECB Denial  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  of stocks fell 0.6 percent
today. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index of U.S. stocks lost 1.4
percent yesterday, while the  MSCI World Index (MXWO)  sank 1.7 percent.  Yields on Japan’s 10-year government notes declined to as
low as 0.81 percent today, the least since July 2003. U.S. 10-
year yields slid to a record low of 1.5933 percent.  The  European Central Bank  denied it has rejected a plan
floated by Spain’s government to recapitalize Bankia group, the
nation’s third-largest lender, saying it hasn’t been approached.
The Spanish government itself has backtracked on an idea to
recapitalize Bankia by injecting sovereign debt into its parent
company that, according to the Financial Times, could then be
used as collateral to borrow from the ECB.  Spanish Yields  Spain’s 10-year bond yield rose as high as 6.70 percent
yesterday, approaching the 7 percent level that led to bailouts
in Greece, Ireland and  Portugal .  A measure of euro-area manufacturing probably decreased to
45 in May from 45.9 in April, the lowest in 35 months, according
to a Bloomberg News survey of economists before London-based
Markit Economics releases its final reading of the gauge
tomorrow. The  unemployment rate  probably climbed to 11 percent
last month, the highest in data compiled by Bloomberg going back
to 1990, a separate poll showed before labor market figures are
released tomorrow.  Losses in the euro were limited as the common currency’s
14-day relative strength index against the dollar fell to 20
yesterday, below the 30 level some traders see as signaling an
asset may reverse declines.  “I think the risk for the euro is still to the downside,
but I’m not sure if it’s going to continue to fall quite as
rapidly as it has,” said Kikuko Takeda, senior currency
economist at Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd. in London. “It’s
possible some news may trigger a bounce in the euro.”  The euro has declined 1.6 percent in the past month
according to Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes, a gauge of
10 developed-market currencies. The yen climbed 7.4 percent, the
best performer, while the dollar strengthened 5.9 percent.  ‘A Bigger Issue’  “What’s going on in Europe is bigger than what’s happening
in one mid-sized investment bank having solvency problems,”
Richard Yetsenga, head of global markets research at  Australia &
New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. (ANZ) , said in an interview on
Bloomberg Television. “It’s a bigger issue about the structure
of the  euro zone . I think the yen should be stronger than many
think and the risk environment is adding to that case.”  The  Dollar Index , which Intercontinental Exchange Inc. uses
to track the greenback against the currencies of six major U.S.
trading partners, rose to as high as 83.11 today, the most since
September 2010, before trading at 82.91 from 83.05 yesterday.  The  index  may advance toward 83.56 after it rose above
82.59 on May 29, the 61.8 percent retracement from its high in
June 2010 to the low on May 2011, according to JPMorgan Chase &
Co., citing a Fibonacci chart.  Fibonacci analysis is based on the theory that prices rise
or fall by certain percentages after reaching a new high or low.  “The short-term upside risks remain intact,”  Niall O’Connor , a technical analyst at JPMorgan, wrote in a research
note yesterday.  -- With reporting by Hiroko Komiya in  Tokyo , Mika Otsuka in  New
