Brent oil declined to its lowest in
five months before a report that may show U.S. stockpiles
climbed to the highest level since 1990 and after economic
confidence in the euro area fell more than forecast.  Brent futures dropped below $105 a barrel in  London  for the
first time since Dec. 20. In the U.S., prices are heading for
the biggest monthly drop in more than three years. American
crude inventories rose 800,000 barrels to 383.3 million last
week, according to the median estimate of eight analysts in a
Bloomberg News survey before the Energy Department report
tomorrow. Economic confidence in the  euro area  fell to its
lowest since 2009, a European Commission report today showed.  “Investors are pulling out with increasing problems in the
 euro zone ,” said Thina Margethe Saltvedt, an analyst at  Nordea
Bank AB (NDA)  in Oslo. “That’s pulling the market lower. The U.S.
market seems to be more-than-well-supplied.”  Brent oil for July settlement fell as much as $2.14, or 2
percent, to $104.54 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures
Europe exchange. It was at $104.96 at 1:17 p.m. London time. The
European benchmark contract’s  premium  to West Texas Intermediate
narrowed to $15.59 from $15.92 yesterday.  WTI crude for July delivery on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  was down $1.39, or 1.5 percent, at $89.37. The contract
yesterday slid 10 cents to $90.76, the lowest close since May
24. Prices are down 15 percent this month, the biggest drop
since December 2008.  Fuel Supplies  Oil in  New York  has long-term technical support at $89.83 a
barrel, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. On the weekly
chart, that’s the 50 percent Fibonacci retracement of the drop
to $32.40 in December 2008 from an intraday record high of
$147.27 in July that year. Buy orders tend to be clustered near
chart-support levels.  “Demand out of the U.S. and the euro zone has been very
soft,”  David Lennox , an analyst at Fat Prophets in Sydney, said
in a telephone interview. “For the foreseeable future, barring
any supply-side shocks, oil will stay around $90 a barrel. If
there’s going to be any movement, it’s not likely to be up.”  U.S. gasoline stockpiles probably fell 250,000 barrels last
week, according to the Bloomberg survey before tomorrow’s Energy
Department report. Distillate supplies, a category that includes
heating oil and diesel, will likely remain unchanged at 119.5
million barrels, the survey shows.  Gasoline Pump Prices  The  American Petroleum Institute  will release separate
inventory data today. The API collects stockpile information on
a voluntary basis from operators of refineries, bulk terminals
and pipelines. The government requires that reports be filed
with the Energy Department for its weekly survey.  U.S. gasoline at the pump fell below year-earlier levels
for the sixth straight week, the Energy Department said in a
weekly retail report yesterday. The national average price for
regular gasoline dropped 4.5 cents to $3.669 a gallon from a
week earlier, it said.  BNP Paribas cut its 2012 price forecast for New York crude
by $7 to $100 a barrel, and its estimates for Brent by $4 to
$115 a barrel, as  Europe ’s debt crisis worsened, according to an
e-mailed report. Prices will still advance in the third quarter
because of sanctions against  Iran  and shrinking spare production
capacity in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries,
the bank said.  Economic confidence in the euro area  declined in May to the
lowest since October 2009. An index of executive and consumer
sentiment in the 17-nation euro area fell to 90.6 from a revised
92.9 in April, the European Commission in Brussels said today.
That’s below the 91.9 forecast by economists, according to the
median of 28 estimates in a Bloomberg News survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
