Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) , the biggest online
retailer, will begin collecting sales tax from New Jersey
residents next year under an agreement with Governor  Chris Christie ’s administration, a state lawmaker said.  Christie, a first-term Republican, will announce the deal
at a 3 p.m. press conference in Trenton, according to Senator
Raymond Lesniak, a Democrat from Elizabeth who said he was
notified of the accord by members of Christie’s staff.  Kevin
Roberts , a spokesman for the governor, declined to comment.  Lesniak sponsored legislation that would have suspended
sales-tax collections through June 2013 as long as Amazon made a
capital investment of at least $130 million and hired no fewer
than 1,500 full-time workers. That bill failed to pass the
Democratic-controlled Legislature after some lawmakers raised
concerns about giving Amazon the tax breaks.  Under the deal with Christie, Seattle-based Amazon will
start collecting  sales tax  as of July 1, 2013, on orders placed
by New Jersey residents through its website, and will seek state
financial help if it chooses to open a warehouse in the state,
Lesniak said.  “It’s certainly helpful to all of our retailers to have a
date certain for Amazon to collect sales tax,” Lesniak said in
a telephone interview. “Certainly it will also help lead to
Amazon creating some jobs and building a facility here.”  Mary Osako, a spokeswoman for Amazon, didn’t immediately
return an e-mail seeking comment on the deal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
