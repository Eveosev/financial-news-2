SolarBridge Technologies Inc., a
closely held supplier of electronics for solar panels, received
$25 million in  venture capital  and will use the funding to
expand to  Europe  this year.  The Series D financing was led by new investor Shea
Ventures LLC and included existing backers Battery Ventures, Rho
Ventures LLC and Osage University Partners, SolarBridge said
today in a statement.  The company, based in Austin, Texas, makes microinverters
that convert direct-current electricity into alternating
current, eliminating the need for bigger inverters and lowering
installation costs, Chief Executive Officer Ron Van Dell said.  “There’s a general shift under way to go from the DC-based
systems to AC-based systems because you get some energy harvest
advantage in doing that,” Van Dell said in a phone interview
yesterday.  The company’s microinverters are packaged with solar panels
made by  SunPower Corp. (SPWR)  and Taiwanese manufacturer  AU Optronics
Corp. (2409)  in the North American market, and it’s developing products
for the European grid, Van Dell said. Sales in Europe will begin
during the second half of this year, though revenue “won’t
become material until 2013,” he said.  SolarBridge also will use the funding to improve its Web-
based software, which enables homeowners to monitor the
performance of systems remotely, Van Dell said. The company
employs 80 people and hiring will increase “modestly” during
the next 18 months, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
