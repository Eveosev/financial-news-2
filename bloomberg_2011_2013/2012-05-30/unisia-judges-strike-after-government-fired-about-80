Tunisian judges are on strike to
protest the Justice Ministry’s decision to fire about 80 of
their colleagues.  The Association of Tunisian Judges said in an e-mailed
statement late yesterday that the strike will begin immediately.
The strike won’t end until the ministry reverses course and
gives the judges the right to challenge their dismissals, the
group said in the statement.  The ministry has defended its move as part of an effort to
curb corruption in the court system.  To contact the reporter on this story: Jihen Laghmari in Tunisia
