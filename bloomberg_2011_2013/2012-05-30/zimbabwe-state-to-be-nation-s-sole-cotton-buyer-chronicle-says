Zimbabwe ’s government will be the
sole buyer of cotton from farmers this year after growers
protested the price offered by merchants, the state-controlled
 Chronicle  reported, citing Agriculture Minister Joseph Made.  The agriculture department and the indigenization ministry
will allocate funds to buy the cotton, Made told the Bulawayo-
based Chronicle. The ministries haven’t yet set a price for the
crop, the newspaper reported.  Cotton merchants were offering between $0.35 and $0.50 a
kilogram (2.2 pounds), while farmers were demanding $0.85 to
$1.20, the Chronicle said. Merchant prices were comparable with
prices in the southern African region, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
