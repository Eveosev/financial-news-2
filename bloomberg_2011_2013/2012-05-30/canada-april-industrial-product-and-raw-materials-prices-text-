The following is the text of the
industrial product and raw material prices report as reported
by  Statistics Canada .  Relative to March, the Industrial Product Price Index
(IPPI) was unchanged in April. Increases in chemical products
(+1.7%) and petroleum and coal products (+0.4%) were offset by a
decline in primary metal products (-2.1%). The Raw Materials
Price Index (RMPI) fell 2.0%, largely because of mineral fuels.  Industrial Product Price Index, monthly change  After three consecutive advances, the IPPI was steady in
April. Of the major commodity groups, eight were up, nine were
down and four were unchanged.  Among the commodities that rose, chemical products (+1.7%)
and petroleum and coal products (+0.4%) were the most
influential.  The increase in chemical products was mainly attributable
to fertilizers (+12.2%), specifically urea (+30.5%). Higher urea
prices were partly a result of strong demand in the  United
States .  Petroleum and coal products were pushed upward mainly by
gasoline prices (+2.7%), which posted their fourth consecutive
gain.  In contrast, declines in prices of primary metal products
(-2.1%), especially aluminum products (-3.7%), copper and copper
alloy products (-4.5%), nickel products (-4.4%) and other non-
ferrous metal products (-1.9%), partly offset the increases in
chemicals and in petroleum and coal products.  Decreases were also observed in meat, fish and dairy
products (-0.5%) and motor vehicles and other transportation
equipment (-0.1%).  Some Canadian producers who export their products are
generally paid on the basis of prices set in US dollars.
Consequently, the 0.1% increase in the value the Canadian dollar
relative to the US dollar in April had the effect of slightly
reducing the corresponding prices in Canadian dollars. However,
the exchange rate had a negligible impact on the index as a
whole.  In April, the IPPI excluding petroleum and coal products
edged down 0.1% for the second consecutive month.  12-month change in the Industrial Product Price Index  Compared with the same month a year earlier, the IPPI rose
0.4% in April. The slowdown of the growth of the index has
continued since September 2011.  The increase in the IPPI was led by higher prices for motor
vehicles and other transportation equipment (+2.7%).  More modest advances were observed in chemical products
(+2.5%) and in fruit, vegetables, feeds and other food products
(+2.2%).  The growth of the IPPI was moderated largely by a decrease
in primary metal products (-9.4%), which posted a sixth
consecutive decline. The largest contributors to the decrease
were other non-ferrous metal products (-13.0%), nickel products
(-29.3%), aluminum products (-11.1%) and copper and copper alloy
products (-10.1%).  The 3.5% decline in the value of the Canadian dollar
against the US dollar contributed to the growth of the index in
April. Without the impact of the exchange rate, the IPPI would
have fallen 0.4% instead of increasing 0.4%.  The IPPI excluding petroleum and coal products was up 0.5%
relative to April 2011.  Raw Materials Price Index, monthly change  The RMPI declined 2.0% in April, the third consecutive
monthly decrease. The downward trend of the index was slightly
more pronounced in April, following declines of 0.6% in February
and 1.7% in March.  In April, the decrease of the index was mostly the result
of mineral fuels (-2.8%), particularly crude petroleum (-2.6%).  The decline of the RMPI was moderated primarily by
vegetable products (+1.4%), especially oilseeds (+6.5%) and
grains (+1.3%).  In the oilseeds group, higher prices were observed for
canola (+6.2%) and soybeans (+6.3%). The increase in soybean and
canola prices was partly attributable to a decline in global
supply, especially in  South America , where drought disrupted
normal production.  The main contributors to the rise in grain prices were oats
(+4.0%), wheat (+2.7%) and barley (+2.0%).  The RMPI excluding mineral fuels posted a 1.3% decrease in
April, ending a string of three consecutive monthly advances.  12-month change in the Raw Materials Price Index  Compared with the same month a year earlier, the RMPI was
down 13.6%, its second consecutive decrease. The decline of the
index was more pronounced in April, partly because it had
reached an exceptionally high level a year earlier.  The index was pushed downward mainly by mineral fuels
prices (-21.3%) and, to a lesser extent, non-ferrous metals
(-12.2%).  Crude petroleum (-21.8%) was primarily responsible for the
decline in mineral fuels, posting its second consecutive
decrease.  All major non-ferrous metal product groups except precious
metals were down. Among the main contributors to the decline
were copper concentrates (-12.8%), other non-ferrous base metals
(-21.1%), non-ferrous metal scrap (-10.6%) and zinc concentrates
(-15.3%).  Year over year, the RMPI excluding mineral fuels declined
5.6% in April.  Note to readers  All data in this release are seasonally unadjusted and
usually subject to revision for a period of six months (for
example, when the July index is released, the index for the
previous January becomes final).  The Industrial Product  Price Index  (IPPI) reflects the
prices that producers in  Canada  receive as the goods leave the
plant gate. It does not reflect what the consumer pays. Unlike
the  Consumer Price Index , the IPPI excludes indirect taxes and
all the costs that occur between the time a good leaves the
plant and the time the final user takes possession of it,
including transportation, wholesale and retail costs.  Canadian producers export many goods. They often indicate
their prices in foreign currencies, especially in US dollars,
which are then converted into Canadian dollars. In particular,
this is the case for motor vehicles, pulp, paper and wood
products. Therefore, a rise or fall in the value of the Canadian
dollar against its US counterpart affects the IPPI. But the
conversion into Canadian dollars only reflects how respondents
provide their prices. Moreover, this is not a measure that takes
into account the full effect of exchange rates, since that is a
more difficult analytical task.  The conversion of prices received in US dollars is based on
the average monthly exchange rate (noon spot rate) established
by the  Bank of Canada  and is available on CANSIM in table
176-0064 (series v37426). Monthly and annual variations in the
exchange rate, as described in the text, are calculated
according to the indirect quotation of the exchange rate (for
example, CAN$1 = US$X).  The Raw Materials Price Index (RMPI) reflects the prices
paid by Canadian manufacturers for key raw materials. Many of
those prices are set on the world market. However, as few prices
are denominated in foreign currencies, their conversion into
Canadian dollars has only a minor effect on the calculation of
the RMPI.  To contact the reporter on this story:
