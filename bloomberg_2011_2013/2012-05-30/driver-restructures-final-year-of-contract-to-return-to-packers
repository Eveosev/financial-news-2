Donald Driver will return to the
 Green Bay Packers  for the 14th consecutive National Football
League season, according to his agent.  The 37-year-old wide receiver signed a restructured
contract today that will keep him with the team that selected
him in the seventh round of the 1999 NFL Draft, his agent,
Jordan Woy, said in an e-mail.  Driver had one year remaining on his contract, but the team
wasn’t expected to bring him back for the 2012 season unless he
reworked his deal, NFL Network said today. Woy didn’t release
financial terms of the new contract.  “When I said I will be a Packer for life, it is now
true,” Driver said yesterday on his Twitter account. “Packer
for life.”  Packers spokesman Jason Wahlers said today in an e-mail
that the team doesn’t comment on players already under contract.  In 13 seasons in Green Bay, Driver has 735 receptions for
10,060 yards and 59 touchdowns. He won a  Super Bowl  with the
team following the 2010 season and was named to the  Pro Bowl  in
2002, 2006 and 2007.  Driver ranks in the top 10 among active receivers in
receptions, yards and receiving touchdowns.  To contact the reporter on this story:
