United Spirits Ltd. (UNSP) ,  India ’s second-
largest maker of alcoholic beverages by market value, said
fourth-quarter profit fell 83 percent, missing analysts’
estimates, because of foreign-exchange losses and higher finance
costs.  Net income  declined to 100 million rupees ($1.8 million) in 
the three months through March, from 599 million rupees a year 
earlier, the Bangalore, India-based company said in a statement. 
That trailed the 656 million-rupee median of 13 analysts’ 
 estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  Profit for the quarter declined due to higher foreign
exchange losses and higher interest costs, the company said in
the statement. The loss from foreign exchange widened to 205
million rupees from 2.7 million rupees a year earlier, while
interest cost rose 43 percent to 1.66 million rupees.  The company’s  shares  rose 1.3 percent to 652.65 rupees in
Mumbai trading yesterday.  Net  sales  for the maker of McDowell’s No. 1 whisky and
Romanov vodka increased 17 percent to 18.6 billion rupees in the
quarter. This fell short of the 18.4 billion rupees median of 13
analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
