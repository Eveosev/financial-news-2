The  Arab Bank for Economic
Development in Africa  plans to grow lending on the continent by
10 percent annually over five years, Director-General Abdelaziz
Khelef said.  The lender, known as Badea, currently has a loan portfolio
in  Africa  totaling $2.5 billion, Khelef said in an interview
today at the  African Development Bank ’s annual meeting in
Arusha, Tanzania. The European debt crisis is unlikely to have
any impact on the bank’s commitment to the continent, he said.  “We and other Arab funds are going to keep our commitments
to Africa despite the European crisis,” Khelef said. Arab
sovereign wealth funds have a combined portfolio of about $15
billion in Africa, he said.  Badea and Tanzania signed a $10 million loan to support a
$23 million road project linking the southern and northern parts
of Pemba Island, off the coast of Tanzania, Finance Minister
William Mgimwa told reporters today in Arusha.  The Saudi Fund for Development matched the $10 million, and
Tanzania’s government will provide $3 million, Mgimwa said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
