New Jersey  community colleges padded
their presidents’ compensation with perks, including housing
allowances, country-club memberships and airfare for spouses to
travel to conventions, Comptroller Matthew Boxer said.  Three of the 19 community colleges paid their presidents
more than $300,000 a year, and 12 covered housing costs as high
as $3,500 a month, according to a report from Boxer’s office.
Brookdale Community College reimbursed its president more than
$41,000 in 2010 for the cost to send his children to four
universities, while Bergen County College’s boss charged the
school credit card $16,600 that year for meals, liquor and
entertainment.  Boxer began reviewing executive pay at the schools last
year after newspaper reports about such arrangements led to the
resignations of presidents at Brookdale and Gloucester County
College. New Jersey’s two-year colleges, which serve all 21
counties, market themselves as affordable gateways, allowing
260,000 students to fulfill core requirements and transfer
credits to four-year universities.  “There are huge disparities in not only the salaries of
community-college presidents, but other forms of their
compensation as well,” Boxer said in a statement. “We’re not
suggesting a one-size-fits-all approach, but it’s appropriate to
set boundaries when schools are spending taxpayer dollars.”  State Aid  New Jersey community colleges received $1.4 billion in
revenue in 2010, with tuition and student fees accounting for 31
percent. State, county and local grants and appropriations made
up 37 percent, according to the report.  The state government’s revenue may trail Governor  Chris Christie ’s projections by as much as $1.3 billion through June
2013,  David Rosen , the Legislature’s chief budget analyst, said
May 23. Treasurer Andrew Sidamon-Eristoff said the two-year
shortfall is $676 million.  The numbers prompted Christie, a 49-year-old Republican
midway through his first term, to reverse a “pay-as-you-go”
plan for funding $1.6 billion in transportation spending for the
fiscal year that begins July 1. The state instead will remove
$260 million in cash funding from that budget and apply it to
operations, then issue bonds for that amount for road work.  “When we’re fighting to try and justify to the public a
greater investment in higher education, you have peoples’
country club memberships being paid for by tuition or tax
dollars at county colleges,” Christie said at a news conference
today in Trenton. “That’s disturbing.”  Scholarships Cut  Every year, the schools’ lobbyists appeal to legislators
not to cut funding, particularly a state-paid scholarship for
top high-school graduates that pays tuition for as many as five
semesters. Christie signed legislation May 3 that preserves the
program, called NJ STARS, with $13.8 million, a 16 percent
decrease from current funding.  The average total payments to New Jersey’s community-
college presidents exceeded $250,000 in 2010, Boxer’s audit
found. The largest amount, $441,000, went to the then-president
of Union County College, who was on sabbatical that year. While
he received full pay and benefits, the college concurrently paid
another person to perform his duties, Boxer said.  Brookdale, in Lincroft, paid $27,382 for tuition for the
president’s children in 2010, and an additional $13,375 to cover
the income-tax liability related to those reimbursements,
Boxer’s office found.  Luxury Car  The president of Essex County College in  Newark  had the
largest base salary, $245,250, plus a $3,500 monthly housing
allowance and unlimited use of a Lincoln MKZ luxury sedan. The
school, with the sixth-largest enrollment among the community
colleges, also paid more than $20,000 for her to move from
 Florida , and covered more than $20,000 in other expenses,
including $3,500 in mobile phone bills.  Avis McMillon, a spokeswoman for Brookdale, didn’t return
telephone calls for comment, and Marsha McCarthy, a spokeswoman
for Essex, said in an e-mail that the president wasn’t available
to comment. Lawrence Nespoli, president of the Council of County
Colleges, a Trenton-based lobbying group, didn’t immediately
return a message.  Brookdale President Peter Burnham resigned in March 2011
after county officials questioned his perks, including the money
for his kids’ college. Burnham was paid a $216,000 salary, and
his total compensation was more than $300,000, according to
Boxer’s report.  Boxer found that Brookdale paid more than $11,000 in dues
and other fees for its president’s membership to a local country
club in 2010. That school also paid $10,574 for his lodging
expenses, including $900 for five stays at a hotel that was
about 90 minutes from the Brookdale campus. College officials
were unable to explain why the president needed to stay at this
hotel, according to Boxer’s report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
