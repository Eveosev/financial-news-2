Sri Lanka ’s exports declined the most
in 30 months in March as demand for textiles, tea and rubber
moderated.  Overseas sales  fell 10.2 percent from a year earlier to
$835.7 million, after rising 7.6 percent in February, the
 Central Bank of Sri Lanka  said in a statement today. Imports
rose 3.9 percent to $1.69 billion, for a trade deficit of $861.3
million.  Sri Lanka has sought to pare demand for imports such as oil
to fight a trade shortfall exacerbated by a moderation in
overseas sales as  Europe ’s debt crisis curbs Asian shipments.
Officials have raised  interest rates  this year to damp credit
growth, increased fuel prices and moved toward a more freely
floating  exchange rate , seeking to shield foreign reserves.  Expenditure on imports of refined petroleum products
increased by about 18 percent as a result of higher prices, the
central bank said in the statement today. Gross official foreign
reserves were $5.73 billion by the end of March, equivalent to
3.3 months of imports, it said.  Textiles and garment exports in March fell 11.7 percent to
$319.4 million, the central bank said. Agricultural shipments
declined 10.1 percent to $203.2 million, while the value of
industrial exports fell 10.9 percent to $624.2 million.  The nation has targeted exports of $11.7 billion in 2012
and expects imports of $20.9 billion, central bank Governor
Ajith Nivard Cabraal said May 8.  The rupee fell 0.3 percent to 132.40 per dollar as of 4:36
p.m. local time. The currency has tumbled about 16.2 percent so
far in 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
