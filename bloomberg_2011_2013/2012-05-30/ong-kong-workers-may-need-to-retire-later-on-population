Hong Kong  workers may need to retire
later and universities should admit more overseas students as
the city’s workforce contracts after 2020, the government said
in a report.  The government should review whether facilities for
expatriate workers such as international school places are
sufficient,  according to the report  released by the Steering
Committee on Population Policy yesterday. Local women should be
encouraged to give birth, the task force said.  A failure to reverse the potential decline in the size of
the workforce will limit future economic growth, according to
the report. Hong Kong, a special administrative region of  China 
that runs its own domestic policy, faces competition from Asian
cities including Tokyo and  Singapore  in attracting skilled
workers and executives.  The possible decline in the working population may “reduce
the standard of living, weaken competitiveness and undermine the
economic vitality of Hong Kong society,” the working group said
in the report.  Hong Kong’s workforce will shrink to 3.49 million in 2029
from a projected 3.58 million in 2020, according to the report.
The aging population will exert an increasing burden on workers,
the committee said.  In a survey of American Chamber of Commerce members in May
2011, 63 percent said some executives are driven away by the
lack of student places.  To contact the reporter on this story:
