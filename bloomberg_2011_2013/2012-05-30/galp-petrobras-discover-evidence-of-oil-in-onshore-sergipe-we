Galp Energia SGPS SA (GALP) , Portugal’s
biggest oil company, and  Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4)  found evidence
of oil in an onshore well in Brazil’s Sergipe basin.  The discovery was made at well 3GALP43SE in the SEAL-T-429
block, the National Petroleum Agency said on its website. The
companies haven’t determined whether the find can be developed
commercially. Lisbon-based Galp and Petrobras, based in Rio de
Janeiro, each own 50 percent of the concession.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
