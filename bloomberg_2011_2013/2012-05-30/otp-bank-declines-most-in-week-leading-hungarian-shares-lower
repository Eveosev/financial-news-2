OTP Bank Nyrt. (OTP) , Hungary’s largest
lender, fell the most in a week, leading losses in the country’s
shares, on concern the European debt and banking crisis is
escalating.  The shares dropped 3.9 percent to 3,445 forint by 12:34
p.m. in Budapest. The benchmark BUX stock index slumped 2.1
percent to 16,144.64.  European stocks slid, set for the lowest level since May
23, as  Spain  struggled to bolster its banking system and
borrowing costs rose at Italy’s debt auctions. Hungary, the
European Union’s most indebted eastern member, has failed to
start talks on a bailout of its own for six months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
