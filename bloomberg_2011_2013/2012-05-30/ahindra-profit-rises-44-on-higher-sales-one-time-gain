Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd. (MM) ,  India ’s
largest maker of  sport utility vehicles  and tractors, reported
fourth-quarter profit increased 44 percent on higher sales and a
one-time gain.  Net income , excluding subsidiaries, rose to 8.74 billion
rupees ($156 million) in the three months ended March 31 from
6.07 billion rupees, the Mumbai-based company said today. This
beat the 6.17 billion-rupee median of 38 analysts’  estimates 
compiled by Bloomberg. It reported a one-time gain of 1.08
billion rupees, according to the statement.  Sales climbed 39 percent to 92.4 billion rupees. The maker
of Xylo and Scorpio vehicles sold more of its vehicles, the bulk
of which are diesel powered, after rising gasoline prices
prompted car buyers to opt for subsidized diesel.  “The growth in the profits of the company, despite the
relentless increase in material costs, is due to a good volume
performance by both vehicles and tractors and tight control on
expenses,” Mahindra said in a statement today. “The company
expects growth to pick up in the second half of 2012-13.”  Shares of the automaker rose 0.6 percent to 659 rupees as
of 2:35 p.m. in Mumbai trading. The benchmark Sensitive Index
declined 0.2 percent.  The utility-vehicle maker, which introduced the XUV500
sport-utility vehicle last year to compete in the premium SUV
market, said on May 28 that it had raised capacity to 4,000
units a month, and would begin taking orders from across the
country from June 8. Priced between 1.15 million rupees and 1.4
million rupees, the XUV500 initially received 8,000 orders in 10
days.  A second round of bookings resulted in over 25,000
bookings, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
