Bakken oil weakened to the widest
discount in more than six weeks versus U.S. benchmark West Texas
Intermediate prior to a planned shutdown at  Tesoro Corp. (TSO) ’s
refinery in Mandan,  North Dakota .  The 58,000-barrel-a-day refinery will halt the crude unit
in early June for about two weeks of work, two people with
knowledge of the situation said in December. A shutdown to tie
in equipment that will boost the plant’s capacity by 10,000
barrels a day is scheduled for late in the second quarter, Chief
Operating Officer Daniel Romasko said during a Feb. 2 conference
call.  Bakken oil’s discount to WTI widened $2.50 to $7.50 a
barrel at 1:54 p.m. in  New York , according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. That’s the widest discount for the grade since April
13.  Western Canada Select’s discount to WTI widened $1.50 to
$20.25 a barrel, the most since April 10. Syncrude’s discount
weakened 55 cents to $4.25 below the U.S. benchmark. That’s the
largest discount for the grade since March 30.  U.S. Gulf Coast crude grades strengthened. Light Louisiana
Sweet’s  premium  to WTI added 10 cents to $11.95 a barrel. Heavy
Louisiana Sweet’s premium increased 85 cents to $14.85 a barrel.  Mars Blend’s added 40 cents to $10 a barrel and Poseidon’s
increased 50 cents to $8.90. Southern Green Canyon’s premium
added 10 cents to $8.60.  The premium for  Thunder Horse , a sour crude with lower
sulfur content than Mars, Poseidon and Southern Green Canyon,
was unchanged at $11 a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
