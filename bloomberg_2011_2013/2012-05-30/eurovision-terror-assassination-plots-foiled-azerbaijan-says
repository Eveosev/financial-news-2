Azerbaijan said its agents foiled
plots by Islamic rebels to kill foreigners at the Eurovision
song contest in Baku and assassinate President  Ilham Aliyev .  Azeri law-enforcement officials killed two members of the
armed group, including its leader, and arrested 40 more, the
National Security Ministry said in an e-mailed statement today.
The rebels have links to insurgents in the Dagestan region of
neighboring  Russia , according to the ministry.  The group planned to detonate explosives at Crystal Hall in
Baku during this month’s Eurovision contest, the world’s most-
watched singing competition, the ministry said. It also plotted
to kill Aliyev during his trip to the northwest region of the
country last month.  Azerbaijan, a mostly Shiite Muslim nation of 9 million,
borders Russia’s North Caucasus region, where the government has
been battling with Islamic rebels for two decades. The Caspian
Sea nation is the third-largest oil producer in the former
 Soviet Union , after Russia and Kazakhstan.  The ministry in February said it had uncovered a terrorist
group with ties to  Iran ’s Revolutionary Guards Corps, or Sepah,
and Lebanon’s Hezbollah.  To contact the reporter on this story:
