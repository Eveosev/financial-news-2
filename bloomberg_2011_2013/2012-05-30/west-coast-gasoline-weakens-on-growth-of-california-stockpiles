California-blend gasoline fell as
stockpiles of the fuel grew in  California  and  BP Plc (BP/) ’s Cherry
Point refinery in Washington increased production to normal
rates.  California-blend, or Carbob, gasoline in San Francisco
weakened 10 cents to a premium of 24 cents a gallon versus
gasoline futures traded on the  New York  Mercantile Exchange,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Los Angeles  Carbob fell 9 cents to a premium of 18 cents a
gallon above futures. Both premiums are the smallest since May
22.  The California Energy Commission released a report today
showing that stocks of Carbob increased 12 percent last week
from the previous week to 5.13 million barrels.  BP also returned to normal rates yesterday at its 266,000-
barrel-a-day plant at Cherry Point, Washington’s largest
refinery, according to a person familiar with operations at the
plant. BP shut the refinery after a Feb. 17 fire at the crude
unit and moved up a maintenance turnaround to coincide with
repairs.  Conventional, 87-octane gasoline in  Portland ,  Oregon , fell
1.5 cents to a premium of 84.5 cents a gallon versus New York
futures. The fuel rose to its highest-ever level of 91 cents
above futures May 23.  Low-sulfur diesel in Portland weakened 6 cents to an 18.5-
cent-a-gallon premium to New York heating oil futures.  California-blend, or CARB, diesel weakened 0.87 cent in Los
Angeles to 5.88 cents above futures. In  San Francisco  it
weakened 0.25 cent to a premium of 7 cents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
