Southern Copper Corp. (SCCO) , the largest
copper producer in Peru and  Mexico , is in talks with Ecuadorean
investors to finance an expansion into the South American
country, said Luis Echevarria, the company’s legal subdirector.  Southern, based in Phoenix, wants to begin exploration in
 Ecuador  “in the near future,” and is interested in bidding in
Ecuador’s next round of mining concessions, Echevarria said
today in an interview in Quito. The company is seeking a
minority stakeholder to invest in the project and expects to
close a deal in “a couple of months,” he said.  Ecuador’s government will open bidding for new mining
concessions in a “few weeks,” the first since a law was passed
in 2009 giving the state greater control over the Andean
country’s mineral resources, Vice Minister of Mining Federico
Auquilla said today at a conference in  Quito .  “We are working in Chile, Argentina and Peru, and due to
our vicinity to Ecuador, it’s a good idea,” Echevarria said.
“Ecuador has recently opened its mining activities to foreign
investors, so we can take a chance on that.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
