Chie’s peso fell to its lowest level
since the start of the year as rising bond yields in  Spain  and
Italy fueled bets  Europe ’s debt crisis is worsening, pushing
down prices for the South American country’s copper exports.  The peso tumbled 1.1 percent to 518.26 per dollar as of 11
a.m. in Santiago, and earlier dropped to 518.67, the lowest
since Jan. 2. The Bloomberg JPMorgan Latin American Currency
Index fell 1 percent. The Chilean peso’s 6.4 percent decline
this month is the second-worst among major regional currencies
tracked by Bloomberg, outperforming only the Mexican peso.  Yields on Spain’s 10-year bonds rose to 6.59 percent,
approaching the 7 percent mark that preceded bailouts in Greece,
Ireland and Portugal. Stocks fell and the euro reached a two-
year low against the dollar while copper, Chile’s main export
and a key driver of its currency, fell as much as 2.5 percent to
$3.3765 a pound on the Comex in  New York .  “The currency is basically following what is going on
outside,” said  Alejandro Cuadrado , a Latin American currency
strategist at  Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA (BBVA)  in New York.
“As the market gets weaker we could go all the way to 525 per
dollar.”  Currencies of other commodity exporters also sank today.
South Africa’s rand fell 2.2 percent and the Australian dollar
slid 1.2 percent. The peso is on course for its steepest monthly
decline since September.  Offshore investors trimmed bets against the peso for a
second day on May 28 to $9.6 billion after they reached $10.2
billion, the highest on record, on May 25.  To contact the reporter on this story:
