The Czech central bank switched part
of its foreign-currency reserves from the euro to Australian
dollars in December 2011, the bank said today.  Czech reserves held in the so-called Aussie accounted for
5.3 percent of the central bankâ€™s portfolio at the end of last
year, the Prague-based Ceska Narodni Banka said in its annual
report published on its website. Reserves held in the euro
remained the largest part of its holdings, accounting for 56.4
percent, the bank said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
