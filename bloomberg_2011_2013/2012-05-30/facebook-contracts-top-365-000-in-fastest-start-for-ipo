Investors flocked to the options
market to protect shares of  Facebook Inc. (FB)  from more losses,
making contracts on the social network website the most popular
among the biggest initial public offerings in the last decade.  A total of 202,938  puts  to sell the  Menlo Park , California-
based company and 162,482 calls to buy changed hands yesterday
as the contracts traded for the first time, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The total of 365,420 compares with 65,213
traded after  General Motors Co. (GM) ’s IPO and 22,736 for Google Inc.
in 2004, then the biggest Internet offering ever.  Facebook shares  lost  $9.16 since the May 18 IPO to close at
$28.84 yesterday. The company, its underwriters and  Nasdaq OMX
Group Inc. (NDAQ)  were sued last week by investors who say they lost
money in the offering, sold during the biggest retreat in global
equity markets since September.  “The option market is implying the volatility Facebook
investors have experienced isn’t going away,” Nelson Saiers,
who oversees $639 million at Alphabet Management LLC in New
York, said by phone yesterday. “It will be a significantly more
turbulent investment than other companies of comparable market
capitalizations.”  Facebook rose 0.3 percent to $28.92 at 11:50 a.m. in New
York today.  Implied volatility , the key gauge of options prices, for
three-month contracts closest to Facebook’s stock price was
63.50 yesterday, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Only seven
stocks in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index have higher levels
than that. The bets on price swings in Facebook compare with
30.65 for  Google (GOOG)  and 36.39 for GM, which had the largest
offering of common stock in history.  GM, Google Options  When GM contracts started trading on Nov. 29, 2010, 50,838
calls and 14,375 puts changed hands, the highest  volume  among
the biggest U.S. IPOs on a first day of options trading
excluding Facebook, data compiled by Bloomberg show. For Google,
7,389 calls and 15,347 puts were exchanged on Aug. 30, 2004.
 LinkedIn Corp. (LNKD) , the biggest professional-networking website, had
call volume of 10,390 versus 12,404 puts on May 27, 2011.  Facebook’s  implied volatility  on three-month contracts for
puts 10 percent below the shares was 65.77, while calls 10
percent above were trading at 61.40, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  Ashley Zandy, a Facebook spokeswoman, declined to comment
on the options trading.  Facebook raised $16 billion on May 17 in the biggest
technology IPO in history. The stock climbed as high as $45 on
May 18, when the shares ended the day with a price-earnings
ratio of 83.1, making Facebook more expensive than 99 percent of
S&P 500 companies.  IPO Returns  The eight-year-old social-networking site produced the
worst five-day return among the largest U.S. deals of the past
decade. The 13 percent plunge through May 24 exceeded the 10
percent drop by MF Global Holdings Inc. in its first five
sessions, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Criticism of the  Facebook IPO  is mounting after the stock
slipped below $30 yesterday for the first time. The company and
Morgan Stanley increased the number of shares to sell by 25
percent to 421.2 million days before the offering and pushed the
asking price to $34 to $38 from $28 to $35.  The first day of trading for the stock was disrupted by the
“poor design” of Nasdaq OMX’s software for IPO auctions,
 Robert Greifeld , the chief executive officer of the exchange
operator, said on May 20. The malfunction also prevented Nasdaq
OMX from sending messages to brokerages confirming that clients’
orders went through. Bearish options wagers on Nasdaq OMX jumped
last week to the highest level in more than two years. The stock
has lost 3.4 percent since May 17.  $30 Puts  June $30 puts were the most active among all Facebook
contracts yesterday, changing hands 23,835 times and
representing 6.5 percent of the total options volume for the
day. June $34 calls and June $32 calls followed with volumes of
15,286 and 15,178, respectively, data compiled by Bloomberg
show. Yesterday’s volume of contracts in Facebook was the
second-biggest in the U.S. stock options market after  Apple
Inc. (AAPL) ’s, data compiled by Chicago-based OCC show.  “A bearish bias that was seen in the first hour of trading
carried through the entire day,” Joe Kunkle, founder of
OptionsHawk.com, a Boston-based provider of options-market
analytics, said in an e-mail yesterday. “The amount of volume
for the first day of trading in the options was incredible.”  The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, known
as the  VIX (VIX) , climbed 12 percent to 23.47 today. Its European
counterpart, the VStoxx Index, a measure of Euro Stoxx 50 Index
option prices, advanced 9.9 percent to 34.51.  Oversupply of Shares  Facebook’s decline resulted from too many shares being sold
in the IPO rather than a fundamental issue with the company’s
business model, according to Wedbush Securities Inc.’s  Michael Pachter , who says the stock will rally to $44 over the next 12
months.  “The plummet has nothing at all to do with the company’s
fundamentals, it is solely a function of the misjudging of
demand,” Pachter, who rates Facebook outperform, said last week
in an interview with  Tom Keene  on Bloomberg Radio. “It’s still
a company with 900 million users that are engaged to the tune of
about 4,000 minutes a year, and that’s a lot of page views and a
lot of advertising opportunities.”  The rating means the Los Angeles-based analyst expects the
stock to perform better than the median total return of the
companies he covers over the next six to 12 months.  Short Bets  Short-selling  bets  against Facebook amounted to 9.9 percent
of the shares sold in the company’s offering, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg and Data Explorers Ltd., a New York-based
research firm. That compares with an average of 2.9 percent for
companies in the  S&P 500 , data compiled by Bloomberg show. Short
sellers borrow shares and sell them, hoping to profit from a
decline in the stock’s price.  In  Europe , the most actively traded structured products
tied to Facebook since its IPO were so-called put warrants,
whose buyers profit if the shares drop below a pre-defined
level, in some cases as low as $19.50, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. There were as many as 1,642  warrants  and
certificates listed on European exchanges yesterday.  “Given the fact that the stock is already trading $9 below
IPO price, some investors might prefer to own options rather
than stock in order to limit their risk to the premium paid,”
Alex Panagiotidis, managing director for equity derivatives at
Sterne Agee & Leach Inc. in  New York , said in an interview
yesterday, referring to the cost of the contracts. “It’s an
alternative investors didn’t have the first days of trading.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
