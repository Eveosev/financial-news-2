Qatar’s public prosecutor ordered the
detention of the owner and senior managers of a mall where a
fire killed 19 people on May 28, state-run Qatar News Agency
reported.  Those detained included the mall’s manager, deputy manager
and the assistant manager for security, QNA said late yesterday.
Also held were the owner of a daycare center in the mall where
13 children perished during the blaze, QNA said. The names of
those detained weren’t given.  The Villaggio mall, the Persian Gulf country’s largest,
opened in 2006 near to the Aspire Zone, the country’s main
sporting center.  At least three memorial services were held across the
capital Doha yesterday to remember to deceased, which included
two firefighters and four teachers at the daycare facility. The
victims were all expatriates from countries including  Spain ,  New
Zealand ,  Japan  and the Philippines.  To contact the reporter on this story:
