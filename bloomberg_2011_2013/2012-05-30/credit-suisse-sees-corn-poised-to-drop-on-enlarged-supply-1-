Corn prices are set for a “sharp
drop” because of prospects for rising world supplies in the
next year, Credit Suisse Group AG said.  Corn may fall to $5.50 a bushel in three months and $5 in
12 months, Credit Suisse analysts led by Tobias Merath said
today in an e-mailed report. Farmers in  Europe  have replanted
damaged winter-wheat fields with corn, and yields in the U.S.
may increase because this year’s rapid planting pace will allow
for an earlier harvest, the bank said. July-delivery corn traded
at $5.5675 a bushel on the  Chicago  Board of Trade by 9:11 a.m.
local time today.  “Prices would need to fall below $5 to no longer look
expensive,” Credit Suisse said. “We think there is a fair
likelihood that the market will settle around these levels in
one year’s time.”  Soybeans may climb to $14.25 a bushel in three months and
$15 in a year, Credit Suisse said. The oilseed traded at $13.675
today in Chicago. Demand is stronger for U.S. supplies after dry
weather hurt crops in  South America , while current prices are
too low to curb Chinese consumption, the bank said.  Wheat may trade at $6.50 a bushel in three months and 12
months, Credit Suisse said. Futures were at $6.48 today. While
dry weather has threatened crops in Ukraine,  Russia  and the
U.S., inventories left over from previous harvests “remain
sufficient to keep the market well supplied,” the bank said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
