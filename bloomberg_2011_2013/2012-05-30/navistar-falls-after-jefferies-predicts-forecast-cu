Navistar International Corp. (NAV) , the
maker of International brand trucks, fell as much as 5.2 percent
after Jefferies Group Inc. said the company may lower its annual
profit forecast when it reports second-quarter earnings.  Navistar slid 3.6 percent to $28.18 at 2:46 p.m.  New York 
time after reaching $27.72. Before today, the shares fell 23
percent this year after falling 35 percent in 2011.  The company may lower its annual profit forecast by $1 a
share or more because of market share losses, narrowing margins,
reduced demand in Brazil and a lack of U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency certification for its 13-liter engine at 0.2
gram of nitrogen oxides,  Stephen Volkmann , an analyst with
Jefferies, said in a research note. Navistar will report second-
quarter results in early June.  Navistar, based in Lisle,  Illinois , lowered its annual
profit forecast on March 8 to $4.25 a share to $5.25, from a
Feb. 1 forecast of as much as $5.75 a share. Analysts estimate
annual profit of $3.99, the average of 17 estimates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
