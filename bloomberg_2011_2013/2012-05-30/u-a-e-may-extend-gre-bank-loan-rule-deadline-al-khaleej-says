The central bank of the  United Arab
Emirates  may extend the deadline for some banks to comply with
rules curtailing their exposure to government-linked companies,
Al-Khaleej reported, citing Chairman Khalil Foulathi.  Changes to the deadline will depend “on each bank, its
exposure and the time remaining in the loans” given to local
governments or government-related enterprises, Foulathi said,
according to the newspaper. The Abu Dhabi-based central bank
will not cancel or amend the rules, he said in the report.  Banks in the United Arab Emirates can lend no more than 100
percent of their capital to local governments and the same to
government-related entities known as GREs, the central bank said
April 4. There was no limit under previous rules. Banks have
until Sept. 30 to comply with the rules, the central bank said
at the time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
