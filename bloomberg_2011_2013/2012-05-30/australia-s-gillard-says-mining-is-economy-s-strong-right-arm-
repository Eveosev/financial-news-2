Australia ’s mining industry is the
“strong right arm” of the economy, supporting hundreds of
thousands of jobs, Prime Minister  Julia Gillard  said.  “Few nations turn natural resources into national wealth
as well as Australia does,” Gillard told a mining industry
gathering in Canberra, according to an e-mailed copy of her
speech. “In reality, so many countries manage their mineral
wealth badly that in the developing world they call it ‘the
resource curse’ and in the advanced world they call it ‘the
Dutch disease.’”  Australia’s Treasury predicts resource industries will
expand at an annual pace of 9 percent, compared with 2 percent
for the rest of the economy over the next two years. Energy and
mining companies will invest a record A$120 billion in the
fiscal year starting July 1, a 150 percent increase from two
years earlier, as part of a A$450 billion resource investment
pipeline, the budget, released earlier this month, showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
