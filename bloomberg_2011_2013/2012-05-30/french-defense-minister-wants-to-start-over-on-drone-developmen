France’s new defense minister said
he’ll “go back to square one” on plans to build military
drones.  “I want to start afresh,” Defense Minister Jean-Yves Le
Drian said in Paris at his first press conference since being
sworn in May 17. “I want to move fast, but without passion and
with pragmatism.”  In February, ex-President  Nicolas Sarkozy  and the British
government asked  BAE Systems Plc (BA/)  and  Dassault Aviation SA (AM)  to
start work on a medium-altitude long-endurance drone for
reconnaissance that would be available for flights from 2020, as
well as to explore development of a UCAV, or unmanned combat
aerial vehicle, by 2030.  In March,  European Aeronautic Defence & Space Co. (EAD) , the
parent of Airbus SAS, said it wasn’t continuing with its own
drone, called Talarion, after failing to win government funding.
The previous French defense minister, Gerard Longuet, had
criticized Dassault and EADS for not working more closely
together on drones.  Le Drian said hasn’t yet had time to look into whether to
go ahead with a Sarkozy-era contract to sell the Mistral-class
command-and-control ship to  Russia .  Le Drian said a study on French military spending will be
ready by the end of the year, with a multi-year budget agreed by
mid-2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
