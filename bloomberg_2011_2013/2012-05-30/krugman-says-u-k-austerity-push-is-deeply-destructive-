Nobel laureate  Paul Krugman  said the
U.K. government’s austerity plan is “deeply destructive” and
it should instead step up spending to boost the economy.  The push for austerity “is failing dismally here,” he
said in an interview on the BBC Radio 4’s Today program today.
“The whole intellectual framework has been tested to
destruction,” he said “and yet the government is insisting
that it will not revise” its austerity plan.  “Britain should be spending a couple of percent of GDP
more,” Krugman said. “By all means have a plan for cutting the
deficit, for reining in long-run spending, but not now.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
