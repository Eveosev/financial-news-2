  Michael McFaul , the U.S. Ambassador
to Russia, “won’t have any influence in Moscow,” a Russian
lawmaker said.  “It’s the  United States  that has decide whether they need
an ambassador who won’t have any influence in Moscow,” Aleksey
Pushkov, a representative of the Russian parliament’s foreign
affairs committee, said in a Twitter Inc.  message .  McFaul apologized in an e-mailed statement today for
comments during a speech to students in which he accused Russia
of bribing Kyrgyzstan to close a U.S. air base used for Afghan
operations.  Russia’s Foreign Ministry chastised McFaul, a former
Stanford University professor in his first diplomatic posting,
for breaching protocol and “unprofessional” behavior by
spreading “blatant falsehoods through the media.”  McFaul’s comments had been “misunderstood,”   Victoria
Nuland , a State Department spokeswoman, said on May 29.  To contact the reporter on this story:
