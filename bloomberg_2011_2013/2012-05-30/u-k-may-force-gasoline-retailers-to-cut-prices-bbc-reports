Transport Secretary Justine Greening
said the British government is considering legislation to force
retailers of gasoline to pass on lower fuel costs to motorists,
the  BBC  reported.  Greening said she wants gas stations to cut prices
voluntarily “but if that doesn’t work we will look at some of
the things other countries have done like Germany, Austria and
 Denmark , who have taken more mandatory action in this area,”
the BBC  reported on its website  today. “I’m really determined
that motorists get a better deal,” it cited her as saying.  The broadcaster, quoting an unnamed official in Greening’s
department, said retailers have a matter of weeks to agree on a
voluntary code of conduct or face legislation to force prices
lower.  To contact the reporter on this story:
