Former  UBS AG (UBS)  client Wolfgang Roessel
pleaded guilty to failing to report more than $11 million in
Swiss accounts to the U.S. Internal Revenue Service.  Roessel, 72, admitted today in federal court in  Fort
Lauderdale , Florida, that he filed a false  tax return  for 2007
and failed to file Reports of Foreign Bank and Financial
Accounts, or FBARs, from 2002 to 2007. He agreed to pay a civil
FBAR penalty of $5.75 million as well as taxes due of $312,803.  He is helping prosecutors in a crackdown on offshore  tax
evasion . U.S. prosecutors have charged almost 50 U.S. taxpayers
with tax crimes since 2009, when UBS avoided prosecution by
paying $780 million, admitting it helped thousands of Americans
evade taxes and turning over the names of 250 American clients
to U.S. authorities. UBS later revealed another 4,450 accounts.  Roessel, who is retired, ran a company that made cameras,
and he holds several patents, said his lawyer, Lee Stapleton,
after he appeared in court on April 10. Roessel, a naturalized
U.S. citizen born in  Germany , was charged April 3. Stapleton
declined to comment today after the hearing.  Roessel deposited foreign proceeds from his business into
accounts he held accounts at Wegelin & Co. and another Swiss
bank not identified in statement today by the U.S. Justice
Department. Wegelin, the 270-year-old bank, was indicted in New
York on Feb. 2 and became the first Swiss lender charged in the
offshore crackdown.  The case is U.S. v. Roessel, 12-cr-60074, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of Florida (Fort Lauderdale).  To contact the reporters on this story:
