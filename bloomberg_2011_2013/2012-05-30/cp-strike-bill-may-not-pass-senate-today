Canadian opposition lawmakers in the
Senate may hold up passage of a bill ending a strike by workers
at  Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd. (CP)  by at least one day, meaning
freight service may not resume tomorrow.  The governing Conservatives need unanimous agreement to
waive the two-day waiting period required for legislation that
goes to the Senate. Conservative Senate Leader Marjory LeBreton
told reporters today that “it appears” lawmakers from the
opposition  Liberal Party  don’t  “want to deal with it today.”  The  legislation  calls for service to begin again no later
than 12 hours after the bill clears the final legislative step,
known as Royal Assent, which usually takes place shortly after
Senate approval.  Marc Roy, a Liberal spokesman, said the Senate won’t be
debating the bill today.  Lawmakers from the House of Commons passed the legislation
at around 1:30 this morning to expedite the end to the CP
strike.  To contact the reporter on this story:
