(Corrects spelling of Touareg in second paragraph.)  Volkswagen AG (VOW) , Europe’s largest
carmaker, plans to add a midsize sport-utility vehicle to its
U.S. lineup, the chief executive officer of its unit in the
country said.  “There’s a great opportunity for us for a midsize SUV in
the U.S.” that would be positioned between the smaller Tiguan
and larger Touareg SUVs, Volkswagen of America CEO Jonathan
Browning told reporters at an Automotive Press Association event
in  Detroit . He declined to say when the company may introduce
the model.  To contact the reporter on this story:
