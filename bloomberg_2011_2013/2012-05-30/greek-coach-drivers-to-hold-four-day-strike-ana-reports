Tourist coach drivers in  Greece  will
hold a four-day strike from 1 p.m. on June 4 after talks with
employers on a collective labor agreement collapsed, the  Athens
News Agency  said.  Tourist companies in Greece are no longer able to give
drivers the same benefits given an irreversible change to
Greece’s economy, the state-run news agency said, citing
Greece’s General National Federation of Tourism Enterprises.  To contact the reporter on this story:
