Lithuania’s central government budget
deficit totaled 1.5 percent of  gross domestic product  in the
first four months of the year, the  Finance Ministry  said.  The shortfall, calculated on a cash basis, narrowed from
1.9 percent of GDP in the same four-month period of last year,
the ministry, based in the capital, Vilnius, said today on its
website. The measure includes all public finances except
municipal budgets.  Prime Minister Andrius Kubilius’s government is seeking to
narrow the fiscal deficit to 3 percent of GDP this year from 5.5
percent in 2011.  Government debt rose to 40.5 percent of GDP at the end of
April from 39.1 percent in March, the ministry said in a
separate statement. Debt widened after the government sold 400
million euros ($496.6 million) in bonds in April, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
