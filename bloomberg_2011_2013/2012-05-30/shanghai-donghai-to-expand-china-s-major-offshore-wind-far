Shanghai  Donghai Wind Power Co.,
which developed the nation’s first large-scale offshore wind
farm in the city, will invest about 1.9 billion yuan ($300
million) in a 100-megawatt offshore facility next year.  The project is the second phase of the East China Sea
Bridge facility and will use turbines from  Shanghai Electric
Group Co. (601727) , said Vice General Manager Zhang Kaihua.  “We’re waiting for governmental approval and expect to
start construction in the first quarter,” Zhang said today in
an interview in Shanghai.  China aims to develop 5 gigawatts of offshore wind farms by
2015, spurring proposals from developers from  China Longyuan
Power Group Corp. (916)  to China Datang Corp. Renewable Power Co.  Shanghai Electric will provide 26 wind turbines, each with
3.6 megawatts of capacity. They will cost 4,790  yuan  a kilowatt
to the project, Zhang Bo, senior commercial manager of unit
Shanghai Electric Windpower Equipment Co., said in September.  Shanghai Donghai started operating a 102-megawatt project
near the East China Sea Bridge in 2010.  Longyuan plans to build 1 gigawatt of offshore wind farms
by 2015, President Xie Changjun said last year.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
