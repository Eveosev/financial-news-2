Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN)  named John
Cogan and Ahmad Masud as co-heads of the Americas power and
utilities investment-banking group after three energy bankers
left for  Bank of America Corp .  Masud joined Credit Suisse in 1994 and Cogan started with
the Zurich-based bank in 2000, according to an internal
memorandum obtained by Bloomberg News. Both bankers are based in
New York and report to Osmar Abib and Jamie Welch, co-heads of
the global energy group, the memo shows.  Cogan and Masud will replace Ray Wood, who was hired by
Bank of America earlier this month as head of U.S. power and
renewables. Gavin Wolfe and Jason Satsky also left to join the
 Charlotte , North Carolina-based bank as managing directors
reporting to Wood.  Tim Perry will continue to run the Americas oil and gas
group, according to the memo. Jack Grone, a spokesman at Credit
Suisse, confirmed its contents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
