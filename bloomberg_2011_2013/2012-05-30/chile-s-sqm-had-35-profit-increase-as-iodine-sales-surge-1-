Soc. Quimica & Minera de Chile SA ,
the country’s biggest fertilizer producer, said first-quarter
profit rose 35 percent as rising iodine prices boosted revenue.  Net income climbed to $150 million from $111 million a year
ago, according to data posted today on the website of  Chile ’s
securities regulator. Sales from iodine operations jumped 53
percent to $144 million while potash sales rose 6.6 percent.  Prices of iodine rose 10 percent in the first quarter from
the previous three months on growing demand for its use in X-ray
equipment and pharmaceutical products, SQM said in an
accompanying statement. The company controlled by billionaire
Julio Ponce produces iodine, lithium and potash from salt flats
in Chile’s Atacama Desert.  “Iodine and lithium markets continue to be strong and in
line with expectations in both demand and pricing,” Chief
Executive Officer Patricio Contesse said in an e-mailed
statement. “Fertilizer market volumes followed the trend we saw
during the fourth quarter of 2011 and in recent weeks we have
started seeing positive indications.”  Sales at SQM’s lithium unit rose 12 percent to $47.5
million from a year earlier as prices rose 16 percent during the
quarter, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
