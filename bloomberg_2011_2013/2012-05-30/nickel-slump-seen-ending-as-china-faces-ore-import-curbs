After slumping more than any other
industrial metal, analysts and traders say the worst may be over
for nickel as restrictions on shipments from  Indonesia , the
biggest producer, diminish a worldwide glut.  Indonesia banned some ore exports from May 6 and imposed a
20 percent tax on the remainder to spur the development of its
refining industry. The nation’s output will drop for the first
time in four years in 2013, slashing global supply growth to 0.2
percent, from 4.9 percent in 2012, Morgan Stanley estimates.
Prices will average $20,000 a metric ton in the fourth quarter,
an increase of 23 percent, the median of 16 analyst estimates
compiled by Bloomberg shows.  The metal fell 13 percent this year on prospects for the
biggest surplus since 2009. Morgan Stanley now predicts the glut
will peak in 2012 and Barclays Plc says prices should rally
toward the end of the year on strengthening demand from
stainless-steel makers, the biggest consumers. The rebound may
not happen until then as China runs down record ore stockpiles
accumulated in anticipation of the Indonesian ban.  “The most bullish thing for nickel short-term is the
impact of the ban on exports,” said  David Wilson , an analyst at
Citigroup Inc. in London and a former economist for OAO GMK
 Norilsk Nickel , the biggest producer of the metal. “We estimate
China has enough stockpiles for about two-to-three months of
consumption. There is a double-whammy impact there. There is
less ore and it’s going to be more expensive.”  Industrial Metals  Nickel extended its drop this week and was 13 percent lower
for the year at $16,305 on the London Metal Exchange by 1:43 p.m.
Tokyo time. The LMEX  index  of six industrial metals was down 2.1
percent and the Standard & Poor’s GSCI gauge of 24 commodities
fell 6.6 percent. The MSCI All-Country World Index of equities
declined 0.5 percent and Treasuries returned 1.8 percent, a Bank
of America Corp.  index (MXWD)  shows.  The glut will contract to 36,900 tons next year, equal to a
week of demand, from 46,600 tons in 2012, Morgan Stanley said in
a March report. Prices rallied 58 percent in 2009 as the surplus
declined to 98,200 tons from 100,300 tons.  The bank’s analysts also expect record consumption every
year until at least 2017. Output of stainless steel, accounting
for 69 percent of nickel usage, will expand to an all-time high
in 2012, according to MEPS (International) Ltd., a consultant to
the industry.  Onca Puma  Indonesia banned exports of 21 unprocessed minerals, except
for companies planning to build local refineries. Those
shipments are subject to a 20 percent tax. National exports of
nickel ore may drop as much as 20 percent in the second half,
Sukristiyawan, the senior marketing manager of PT Aneka Tambang,
the country’s second-largest producer, said in an interview this
month.  That may be offset by additional supply from elsewhere in
the world.  Anglo American Plc (AAL) ’s Barro Alto mine and  Vale SA (VALE3) ’s
Onca Puma, both in  Brazil , will add a combined 45,000 tons this
year, Morgan Stanley estimates. Another 72,000 tons will come
from projects in  Australia ,  New Caledonia , Madagascar and the
 Philippines , according to the bank.  “Prices have to stay at these levels for a while longer to
induce people to cut production,” said  Jim Lennon , an analyst
at Macquarie Group Ltd. in London, who has been following the
market for three decades. “We’re just hearing of some cuts but
not very much. There’s more stuff coming on.”  Stockpiles in warehouses monitored by the LME advanced 28
percent to 106,752 tons since early November, according to
bourse data. They make keep rising as economic expansion slows.  China Growth  China  grew 8.1 percent in the first quarter, the slowest
pace in almost three years, and the 17-nation euro region
stagnated, government data show. Nickel consumption contracted
for three consecutive years before rebounding in 2010 as nations
emerged from recession, Morgan Stanley said.  The predicted gain in prices to $20,000 would still be
short of the record $51,800 reached in 2007. Norilsk Nickel will
report net income of 133.7 billion rubles ($4.15 billion) this
year, from 143.1 billion rubles in 2011, the mean of seven
analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg shows. While shares of
the Moscow-based company fell 2.8 percent to $14.90 this year,
they will rally to $20.60 in 12 months, according to the average
of 10 forecasts.  New technology adopted by China’s makers of nickel pig iron,
a substitute made from lower-grade ores, is driving down output
costs, decreasing the likelihood of production cuts as prices
slump. Average NPI overheads are now $16,500 a ton, from $17,300
last year, according to Barclays, which cites data from Brook
Hunt, a research unit of Wood Mackenzie Ltd.  Stainless Steel  That trend may be reversed by Indonesia’s tax on ore
exports, boosting average NPI costs to $17,400 by the end of the
year, Nicholas Snowdon, a Barclays analyst in  New York , wrote in
a report May 29. Combined with strengthening Chinese stainless-
steel demand in the second half of 2012, that would justify
prices moving back toward $20,000, he said.  China’s imports of nickel ore from Indonesia climbed 15
percent to a record 3.34 million tons in April, according to
customs data. Stockpiles at Chinese ports stand at almost 12
million tons, Barclays estimates.  They will be run down amid signs that demand for nickel is
strengthening. Orders to withdraw metal from LME-monitored
warehouses, or  canceled warrants , averaged 5,819 tons this month,
the most since October, bourse data show.  Global stainless-steel production will rise by almost 6
percent to 34 million tons this year, MEPS said in a report May
8. That compares with 3.3 percent in 2011, the Sheffield,
England-based consultant said. Growth will be weighted toward
the end of the year, with Macquarie forecasting a fourth-quarter
gain of 13 percent, from a 0.1 percent contraction in the first
three months of the year.  “Everyone who’s in their right mind should hate nickel
fundamentally,” said  Nikos Kavalis , an analyst at Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc in  London . “But it’s so cheap now. In the
long-run these prices are not sustainable.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
