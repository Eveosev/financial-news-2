Luke Spajic, the head of European
credit portfolio management at Pacific Investment Management
Co., said the  European Central Bank  is “the only game in town”
to help the continent.  “The ECB has to step in,” Spajic said on Bloomberg
Television’s “The Pulse” with Caroline Hyde. The Frankfurt-
based bank’s second Longer-Term Refinancing Operation “really
took the market by surprise” and helped banks, he said.  Spajic said he would “love” to see closer fiscal
integration in the euro area. A bank deposit guarantee program
would be difficult because “it may take a legislative change”
involving the agreement of all 17 euro-area members, he said.  Credit investors should avoid risky euro-region corporate
bonds, Spajic said.  Emerging markets  are “the future,” though
they’ll also be contaminated by the European crisis, he said.
U.S. Treasuries remain the “true safe haven,” according to
Spajic.  To contact the reporter on this story:
