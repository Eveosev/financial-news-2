Conergy AG (CGYK) , a Hamburg-based solar
panel maker, is building a 1.5-megawatt solar plant at a prison
at Brandenburg an der Havel outside Berlin.  Conergy and BATEG Energy GmbH, the park’s contractor, will
connect the plant that uses 6,700 Conergy modules to the local
grid on June 1, the companies said today in an e-mailed
statement. BATEG invested about 3 million euros ($3.7 million)
in the project, said Hasan Kaygusuz, the contractor’s managing
partner.  To contact the reporter on this story:
