Deutsche Lufthansa AG (LHA)  said it may cut
as many as 1,000 jobs at LSG Sky Chefs, the world’s biggest
inflight caterer, as part of a plan to shave 1.5 billion euros
($1.9 billion) from group-wide expenses through 2014.  The number of posts to be scrapped has yet to be determined
and Lufthansa will initially seek to eliminate headcount by not
replacing people who leave, spokeswoman Josefine Corsten said by
telephone from  Frankfurt , where the company has its main hub.  Europe ’s second-biggest airline, which had a 381 million-
euro operating losses in the first quarter, is already cutting
3,500 administrative positions, or 20 percent of the total,
while exploring plans to combine short-haul operations outside
of Frankfurt and Munich with its low-cost division Germanwings.  The timing of the cuts at LSG Sky Chefs, which had 29,600
employees globally at the end of last year, according to
Lufthansa’s annual report, depends on how capacity and customer
demand develops, Corsten said. The unit has around 200 kitchens
worldwide, ranking it No. 1 ahead of  Gategroup Holding AG. (GATE)   Shares of Lufthansa  fell as much as 1 percent and were
trading 0.3 percent lower at 8.65 euros as of 10:38 a.m. in
Frankfurt. The stock has declined 5.8 percent this year, valuing
the Cologne-based carrier at 3.96 billion euros.  Global Reach  Assuming its current name after Lufthansa completed the
takeover of U.S.-based Sky Chefs in 2001, the catering unit
provides more than 400 million meals each year for 300 airlines
around the world, and has a market share as high as 40 percent
in the U.S. and Europe, according to its website.  About three-quarters of its 2.3 billion euros in annual
 revenue  comes from outside the Lufthansa group, with growth
slowing to 2.2 percent in 2011 from 7 percent the year before as
network carriers in  North America  and Europe cut spending.  Still, operating profit grew 12 percent in 2011 to 85
million euros and growth opportunities are being created as
airlines in  Asia , the Middle East and  Africa  look to outsource
food provision, the annual report says, predicting that the unit
will boost revenue and earnings this year and next.  Lufthansa, which employs 120,000 people worldwide, has
begun a savings program dubbed SCORE -- from Synergies, Costs,
Organization, Revenues, Execution -- after completing a package
that shaved 1 billion euros from expenses through 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
