Broadwind Energy Inc. (BWEN) , a U.S.
provider of steel towers for wind turbines, fell after the U.S.
Commerce Department proposed duties of as much as 26 percent on
competing products imported from China.  Shares of Naperville, Illinois-based Broadwind were little-
changed at 29 cents at the close in New York. They gained as
much as 9.5 percent intraday, the most since May 22.  The Commerce Department released preliminary results today
of its investigation into a complaint from the Wind Tower Trade
Coalition, which claims its members are being harmed by
subsidies from China. The group was formed to pursue the trade
complaint and includes Broadwind,  Otter Tail Corp. (OTTR) â€™s DMI
Industries, Katana Summit LLC and a unit of  Trinity Industries
Inc. (TRN)   Broadwind shares have declined 57 percent this year on
concerns that a renewable-energy tax credit due to expire at the
end of the year will slow U.S. sales of wind turbines.  To contact the reporter on this story:
