Valovis Bank, owned by the employee
trust of retailer KarstadtQuelle, was bailed out by a German
guarantee fund after writedowns on its Greek debt holdings
erased its equity,  Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung  reported
today, without saying where it got the information.  Valovis Bank got 100 million euros ($125 million) in
guarantees from the deposit guarantee fund after writedowns of
120 million euros on Greek debt left the bank with too little
equity endangering the survival of the lender, FAZ said.  Press officers at Valovis werenâ€™t immediately available to
comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
