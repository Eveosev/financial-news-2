Australia ’s dollar fell by the most
this year as concern about Spain’s banking crisis escalated,
reducing demand for higher-yielding assets.  New Zealand’s dollar declined as Spanish officials debated
how to rescue BFA-Bankia, the nation’s third-biggest lender. The
South Pacific nations’ currencies dropped as stocks and
commodities slumped, reducing investor appetite for assets
linked to growth.  The Aussie, as Australia’s currency is known, slid 1.5
percent to 97.04 U.S. cents yesterday in New York. The decline
was the biggest since December. The currency dropped 2 percent
to 76.74 yen.  New Zealand’s kiwi dollar fell 1.3 percent to 75.31 U.S.
cents and lost 1.8 percent to 59.55 yen.  The  MSCI World Index (MXWO)  of equities and the Thomson
Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of raw materials each slid 1.7
percent.  Bankia group was nationalized on May 9, and the new
management of the Spanish lender has asked for 19 billion euros
($23.5 billion) of public money to clean up its balance sheet.
The  European Central Bank  denied yesterday that it had rejected
a plan floated by the Spanish government to recapitalize Bankia,
saying it hadn’t been approached.  To contact the reporter on this story:
