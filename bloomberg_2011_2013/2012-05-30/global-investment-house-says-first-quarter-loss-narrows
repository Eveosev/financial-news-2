Global Investment House KSCC said its
first-quarter loss narrowed after the Kuwaiti investment bank
gained from asset sales and reduced losses at its associates.  The bank had a loss of 11 million dinars ($39.2 million)
compared with 22 million dinars a year earlier, Global said in a
statement on the Dubai bourse today. The bank gained 2 million
dinars from the sale of financial assets, and losses at
affiliates fell to 2.5 million dinars from 6.8 million dinars.  Global Investment, which reorganized $1.73 billion of  debt 
in 2009, said yesterday it will hold meetings with bondholders
on June 7 as part of the restructuring process. The company said
May 14 it continued to make progress in talks with lenders, who
were requested to “extend existing waivers/deferrals expiring
on June 10 and to grant other necessary waivers/deferrals.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
