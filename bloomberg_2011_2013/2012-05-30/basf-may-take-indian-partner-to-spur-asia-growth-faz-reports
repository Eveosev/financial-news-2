BASF SE (BAS)  isn’t seeing the dynamism it
expected in Asia and is considering a partnership in India,
 Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung  reported, citing an interview
with deputy chief executive officer Martin Brudermueller.  While India is growing, it is held back by a backlog of
reforms  and “questionable” legislature, Brudermueller said,
according to the German newspaper. BASF is looking at options
and holding discussions to decide whether it will work with a
partner in the country, FAZ said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
