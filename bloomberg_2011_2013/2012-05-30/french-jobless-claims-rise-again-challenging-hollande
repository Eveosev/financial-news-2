French jobless claims rose for a 12th
month in April as companies trimmed payrolls, posing a challenge
to newly elected President  Francois Hollande .  The number of people actively looking for work rose by
4,300, or 0.1 percent, to 2,888,800, the Labor Ministry said
today in an e-mailed statement from Paris. Three economists
surveyed by Bloomberg News expected claims of between 2.89
million and 2.91 million.  With companies such as Air France-KLM, PSA Peugeot Citroen
and  Carrefour SA (CA)  looking to reduce costs, unions are pressing
Hollande to make good on a campaign promise to prevent a wave of
firings.  Bernard Thibault , leader of France’s CGT union,
estimated yesterday that 45,000 French jobs are at risk in
coming months.  “Decisions need to be taken on certain situations
urgently,” Thibault said after meeting with Prime Minister
Jean-Marc Ayrault.  France ’s economy didn’t expand in the first quarter and the
Bank of France estimates that it may fail to grow in the second
quarter as well. The nation’s unemployment rate stood at 9.8
percent at the end of last year.  Jobless claims were last above 2.9 million in September
1999.  To contact the reporters on this story:
