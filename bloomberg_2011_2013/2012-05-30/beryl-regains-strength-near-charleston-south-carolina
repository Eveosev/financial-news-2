Beryl gained strength today near the
Charleston,  South Carolina , area and may be reclassified a
tropical storm later today as the system moves along the
Carolinas coast, the National Hurricane Center  said .  Thereâ€™s a 45 percent probability that the rain-filled
system becomes a tropical storm again today, 49 percent tomorrow
and 59 percent on June 1, the Miami-based center said today in a
5 a.m. EDT website advisory.  Beryl, bearing 35 miles per hour (55 kilometers per hour)
winds, is moving east-northeast at 14 mph and will maintain that
course moving along or just off the coast of the Carolinas today,
the NHC said. Dangerous surf and heavy rain is accompanying the
storm, it said.  Forecasts call for Beryl to be well off  North Carolina  by
early tomorrow as a tropical storm and continue eastward across
cooler Atlantic waters far north of  Bermuda  into the weekend.  To contact the reporter on this story:
