The global cocoa shortage for the
2011-12 season started in October will be 39 percent smaller
than initially estimated, according to the London-based
 International Cocoa Organization .  Cocoa demand will outpace supplies by 43,000 metric tons
from a February forecast of 71,000 tons, the ICCO said in a
report e-mailed today. This season’s shortage follows a surplus
of 343,000 tons in 2010-11, according to the group.  “Although a recurrence of the ideal weather conditions
experienced in  Africa  is not envisaged, the start of the rainy
season would help to boost crop development after the dry
weather conditions which prevailed from December through
January,” the ICCO said in the report.  Global production will reach 3.99 million tons, up from a
previous forecast of 3.96 million tons, and down from last
year’s 4.31 million tons, the ICCO estimated. Bean processing
will be 3.99 million tons, little changed from the previous
estimate and up from 3.92 million tons last season.  “After growing by over five per cent in the previous
season, world grindings of  cocoa beans  are still projected to
rise during the 2011-2012 crop year, but at a much slower
pace,” the organization said. “ Ivory Coast  and  Indonesia  are
expected to be the main contributors to the higher than
previously expected estimate for grindings.”  Ghana, Ivory Coast  Cocoa output in Ivory Coast will be 1.41 million tons this
season, up from a previous forecast of 1.35 million and down
from last year’s record of 1.51 million tons, the ICCO said.
Output for the mid-crop, the smaller of two annual harvests that
usually starts in April, will reach 370,000 tons.  “The latest information on crop development and trade
figures indicate that Ivory Coast’s output will be higher than
previously expected, mainly due to the revision of cumulative
cocoa arrivals to ports as at the end of February,” it said.  Rains in growing regions “bode well” for the mid-crop,
according to the report. Dry weather earlier this year delayed
the start of the mid crop harvest, the ICCO said.  Farmers in  Ghana , the second-biggest grower, will harvest
890,000 tons, 8.2 percent less than previously forecast, the
organization said, adding that there is still uncertainty over
output for the light crop, which usually starts in June.  “Ghana’s cocoa regulator, Cocobod, was investigating a
difference of around 70,000 tons of beans between purchases
declared by licensed buying companies and its own inventory,”
the ICCO said. “The season is still on and the gap will
probably close before it ends.”  Nigerian Output  Production in  Nigeria  will be 10,000 tons higher than
initially estimated at 220,000 tons, while Cameroon’s output
will also be 10,000 tons higher than anticipated at 210,000
tons, according to the report.  Brazil ,  Latin America ’s biggest grower, will produce
190,000 tons, up from a previous forecast of 180,000 tons, while
output in  Ecuador  will be 175,000 tons, 17 percent higher than
initially estimated. Farmers in Indonesia, the world’s third-
largest producer, will harvest 500,000 tons, unchanged from the
previous estimate, the ICCO said.  Cocoa bean processing will rise by 11 percent in Africa to
732,000 tons from a year earlier, the organization forecasts.
Grindings will decline by 15,000 tons in  Europe  and 8,000 in the
Americas because of low processing margins and concerns economic
growth will slow, according to the report.  “Demand for cocoa powder is likely to remain strong in the
Asian markets,” the ICCO said. “Although chocolate is still
regarded as an ‘affordable luxury’, even in the face of economic
hardship, demand for its key ingredient, cocoa butter, is rather
low as the industry’s attention is focused on the euro zone
crisis and its impact on consumption.”  Cocoa butter can account for as much as 20 percent of a
chocolate bar, while cocoa powder is found in products such as
soft drinks, cookies and ice-cream.  To contact the reporter on this story:
