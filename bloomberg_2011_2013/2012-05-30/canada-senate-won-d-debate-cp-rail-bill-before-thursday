Canadian lawmakers in the Senate have
opted not to begin debating the legislation that would end the
strike at Canadian Pacific Railway until May 31, which means the
earliest service could resume is June 1.  The bill will be debated at second reading tomorrow, and
could still pass the legislature at all remaining stages in one
day. The bill requires striking employees to return to work 12
hours after the bill is completed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
