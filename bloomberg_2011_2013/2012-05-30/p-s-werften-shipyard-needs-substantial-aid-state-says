P&S Werften GmbH , a builder of
ferries,  container ships  and offshore service vessels, needs
“substantial” aid to survive, and  Germany ’s federal government
must help, the state of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania said.  “The yards in Stralsund and Wolgast are in a very
difficult situation,” state Prime Minister Erwin Sellering said
in a  statement  on the Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania government’s
website.  The two German shipyards need “a double-digit” million-
euro loan this week and “substantial financial means” after
that to reorganize, Sellering said. While the state is ready to
give aid, a rescue package is only possible if the federal
government, banks and the shipyards’ owners, management and
suppliers also contribute, he said. The European Union must
approve any financial aid to P&S Werften, said Sellering.  Calls to P&S Werften’s offices in Stralsund and Wolgast
seeking comment weren’t answered.  To contact the reporter on this story:
