International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) 
had its corporate  credit rating  upgraded to AA- from A+ by
Standard & Poor’s Rating Services, which cited the company’s
lucrative shift to software and services.  S&P also boosted its short-term rating on IBM to A-1+ from
A-1, according to a report today. The outlook is stable.  IBM, the world’s largest computer-services provider,
expects software to deliver half of its  earnings  in 2015. The
Armonk, New York-based company is relatively low risk and its
effort to get more revenue from software and services is
improving profit margins, Martha Toll-Reed, an S&P analyst in
New York, said in the report.  “IBM’s good market position and broad product and revenue
base provide  cash flow  and ratings stability,” she said.
“Highly competitive industry conditions, a moderately
acquisitive growth strategy, and significant share repurchases
currently constrain the potential for a higher rating.”  IBM shares fell less than 1 percent to $194.53 at the close
in New York. The stock has climbed 5.8 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
