The U.S. East Coast’s late-May blast
of heat may give way to cooler weather through mid-June,
potentially keeping air conditioners off and electricity
consumption low.  Temperatures from the Canadian Maritimes to the North
Carolina-Virginia line may be 3 to 4 degrees Fahrenheit (1.7 to
2.2 Celsius) below normal from June 4 to June 8, said  MDA
EarthSat Weather  in Gaithersburg, Maryland. Seasonal weather may
follow from June 9 to June 13.  New York City  had a high yesterday of 89 Fahrenheit (32
Celsius), 15 degrees above normal, while  Washington  had 91, 12
above normal, according to National Weather Service data.  “After yesterday’s impressive first-of-the-year 90s surge
on the East Coast, our current forecast shows no more 90s
repeats over the next two weeks,” said  Matt Rogers , president
of Commodity Weather Group LLC in Bethesda, Maryland.  Temperatures in the 80s and 90s or periods of high humidity
send people to their air conditioners for comfort, creating
extra demand for electricity. The low price of natural gas has
prompted many utilities to burn that fuel to produce power
instead of coal.  Natural gas declined today on the  New York  Mercantile
Exchange on forecasts for cooler Northeast weather.  The normal average temperature in New York for June 7 is
about 70 degrees, according to MDA. It’s 65 in Boston, 73 in
Washington, 76 in Atlanta, 82 in Houston, 80 in Dallas, 60 in
Seattle and 68 in Burbank,  California .  To contact the reporter on this story:
