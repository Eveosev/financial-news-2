Credit derivatives traders settling
contracts that protected against a default by  Houghton Mifflin 
Harcourt Publishing Co. set a value of 55.5 cents on the dollar
for the publisher that filed for bankruptcy this month.  The price, the result of a final round of bidding by 12
dealers including JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Barclays Plc, means
sellers of the swaps would pay 44.5 cents on the dollar to
buyers of protection to settle the contracts, according to data
on an auction  website  from Markit Group Ltd. and broker Creditex
Group Inc. A net demand to sell $16.165 million of the bonds,
entirely from Goldman Sachs Group Inc., was matched with orders
from the dealers and their clients, Markit and Creditex said.  The Boston-based publisher sought  bankruptcy protection  to
eliminate $3.1 billion of debt through a debt-for-equity
transaction in a plan backed by a majority of its “key
financial stakeholders,” according to a May 21  statement  from
the company. Houghton Mifflin expects to complete its financial
restructuring by the end of June, it said.  Sellers of credit-default swaps, used to hedge against
losses or to speculate on creditworthiness, pay the buyer face
value, less the value of the underlying debt. The  International
Swaps and Derivatives Association ’s determinations committee
 ruled  on May 22 that a so-called bankruptcy credit event
occurred.  To contact the reporter on this story:
