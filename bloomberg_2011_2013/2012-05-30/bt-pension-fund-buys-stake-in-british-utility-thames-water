(Corrects to remove reference to Macquarie disposal in
final paragraph of story published June 30.)  BT Group Plc (BT/A) ’s pension fund said it
acquired a minority percent stake in Thames Water, Britain’s
largest water and sewage company, from funds managed by
 Macquarie Group Ltd. (MQG)   BT’s pension fund bought 13 percent of Thames Water’s
holding company Kemble Water Holdings Ltd. for an undisclosed
amount, Macquarie said in a statement today.  The  pension plan  is making the acquisition after BT said it
planned to halve its 3.9 billion-pound ($6 billion) pension
deficit. The phone company has sought to move away from past
criticism of its pension funding, with a regulator saying in
2010 it had “substantial concerns” over the payment of the
shortfall.  China ’s largest sovereign wealth fund, China Investment
Corp., bought an 8.76 percent stake in Thames Water in January.  To contact the reporter on this story:
