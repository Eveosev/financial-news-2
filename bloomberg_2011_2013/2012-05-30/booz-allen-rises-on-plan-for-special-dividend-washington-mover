Booz Allen Hamilton Holding Corp. (BAH) 
gained the most since 2010 after the government-consulting
company declared a special dividend of $1.50 a share.  The company advanced 13 percent to $16.86 at the close in
 New York , for the biggest jump since Nov. 17, 2010. The McLean,
Virginia-based company, which is 71 percent-owned by Carlyle
Group LP, has fallen 2.3 percent this year. The dividend is
payable June 29 to holders of record June 11.  Booz Allen, which in July spun off its consulting
operations for state and local governments and transportation,
said it expanded its commercial and international business this
year after the expiration of a non-compete agreement.  “The special dividend is driving the stock up,” said
William Loomis, an analyst with Stifel Nicolaus & Co., who
called the payout a surprise.  The company’s fiscal fourth-quarter results were generally
in line with “revenue outlook reduced and contract awards
weaker leading to greater uncertainty,” Loomis said via e-mail.  Booz Allen , in a preliminary report for the quarter ended
March 31, posted profit excluding certain items of $62.2
million, or 44 cents a share. Analysts on average had estimated
40 cents, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Revenue was $1.54 billion, the company said. That trailed
the average estimate of $1.55 billion, according to Bloomberg’s
compilation.  Booz Allen also declared its second regular quarterly cash
dividend of 9 cents a share, with the same payable and record
dates as for the special dividend.  To contact the reporter on this story:
