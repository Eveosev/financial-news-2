Japanese and Australian  stock   futures 
fell as concern mounted about Greece’s future in the euro and
U.S. home sales fell, dimming the outlook for Asian exporters.  American depositary receipts of  Sony Corp. (6758) ,  Japan ’s No. 1
exporter of consumer electronics that gets 38 percent of its
sales in Europe and the U.S., lost 2 percent from the closing
share price in Tokyo. Those of  Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group
Inc. (8306) , Japan’s biggest lender, fell 2.4 percent. ADRs of  Woodside
Petroleum Ltd. (WPL) , Australia’s No. 2 oil and gas producer, slid 1.5
percent after oil declined.  Futures on Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  expiring in
June closed at 8,500 in Chicago yesterday, down from 8,610 in
 Osaka , Japan. They were bid in the pre-market at 8,500 in Osaka
at 8:05 a.m. local time. Futures on Australia’s S&P/ASX 200
Index dropped 1.1 percent today. New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index lost
0.4 percent in Wellington.  “The market is genuinely worried about the potential
disorderly default and exit by Greece and what that means in
terms of contagion risks,” said Prasad Patkar, who helps manage
about $1 billion at Platypus Asset Management Ltd. in Sydney.
“It will have to be a response by governments and the central
bank to stem the panic in the market.”  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPXL1)  were little
changed today. The index fell 1.4 percent in New York yesterday
after a report showed the number of Americans signing contracts
to buy previously owned homes fell in April by the most in a
year.  Greece, Spain  Stocks fell as an opinion poll showed most Greeks want to
see the terms of a financial rescue revised, stoking fears the
nation may default and be forced to exit the euro. Separately,
the  European Central Bank  denied it has rejected a plan floated
by the Spanish government to recapitalize Bankia group.  New York oil futures fell 3.2 percent and Brent oil traded
in London settled below $104 a barrel for the first time this
year.  Shares of major Japanese exporters such as Toyota Motor
Corp. may be active after the yen rose against all of its 16
counterparts yesterday, reaching a three-month high against the
dollar. A stronger yen cuts the competitiveness of the exporters
abroad.  A government report today is forecast to show Japan’s
industrial production rose 0.5 percent in April after gaining
1.3 percent in March. The report is due at 8:50 a.m. Tokyo time.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  declined 0.8 percent this year
through yesterday, compared with a 4.4 percent gain by the  S&P
500  and a 1.6 percent loss by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. Stocks
in the Asian benchmark are valued at 11.6 times estimated
earnings on average, compared with 12.5 times for the S&P 500
and 10 times for the Stoxx 600.  Chinese equities traded in New York fell, extending the
benchmark index’s loss this month to the largest since
September, on speculation a manufacturing report tomorrow will
signal Asia’s largest economy is slowing. The Bloomberg China-US
Equity Index fell 2.7 percent to 90.95 yesterday in New York,
taking its in May to 12 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
