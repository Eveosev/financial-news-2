The two main characters in Turkish
television series “One Man, One Woman” will get married in an
upcoming episode after the broadcasting watchdog complained
their cohabitation was inappropriate,  Milliyet reported .  The marriage follows a wedding in the police drama “Behzat
C.” after similar complaints from the Radio and Television
Supreme Council, which said that two of that program’s leading
characters were legitimizing relationships outside marriage, the
Istanbul-based paper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
