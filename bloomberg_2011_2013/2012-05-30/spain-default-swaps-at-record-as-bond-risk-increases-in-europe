The cost of insuring against default
on Spanish sovereign bonds rose to a record as the nation’s debt
crisis deepened amid concern over bank bailouts.  Credit-default swaps linked to the nation’s debt climbed 23
basis points to 583 at 11:44 a.m. in London, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The Markit iTraxx SovX Western Europe
Index of swaps on 15 governments rose seven basis points to
320.5. An increase signals worsening perceptions of  credit
quality .  Bank of  Spain  Governor Miguel Angel Fernandez Ordonez
resigned a month early, handing over the task of convincing
investors that Spanish banks won’t need an international rescue.
Bankia group, the nation’s third-biggest lender which received
4.5 billion euros ($5.6 billion) of public funds in 2010, asked
for another 19 billion euros on May 25.  “The pressure remains on Spain,”  Elisabeth Afseth , an
analyst at Investec Bank Plc in London, wrote in a note. “The
focus remains on how the government is going to deal with the
banking crisis.”  The cost of insuring bank debt also increased with the
Markit iTraxx Financial Index linked to senior debt of 25 banks
and insurers rising eight basis points to 299 and the
subordinated index jumping 12.5 to 497.5.  Swaps on Banco Santander SA, the biggest Spanish lender,
jumped 15.5 basis points to 421 while contracts on Banco Bilbao
Vizcaya Argentaria SA added 15 to 461.  Italian Swaps  Italy’s bond yields surged to a four-month high as the
nation missed its maximum target for sales of five- and 10-year
securities, stoking concern that  Europe ’s financial woes are
crimping investor appetite for the debt. Swaps on the nation’s
debt jumped 20 basis points to 542, the highest since Dec. 16.  The Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of swaps linked to 50
companies with mostly high-yield credit ratings increased 16
basis points to 716. The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125
companies with investment-grade ratings advanced five basis
points to 175.5 basis points.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros of debt from default for five years is equivalent
to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer face value in
exchange for the underlying securities or the cash equivalent
should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
