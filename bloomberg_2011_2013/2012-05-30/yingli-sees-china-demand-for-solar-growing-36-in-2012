Yingli Green Energy Holding Co. (YGE) ,
 China ’s second-biggest solar-panel maker, expects domestic sales
to increase by 36 percent this year as the country’s subsidy
program accelerates.  Yingli forecast 30 percent of its 2012 revenue coming from
China, up from 22 percent last year, the company said today in a
statement.  China approved 1.7 gigawatts of solar projects May 3 under
its Golden Sun subsidy program, which will spur sales this year,
according to Yingli Chairman Miao Liansheng. The program was
introduced in 2009 and subsidized 689 megawatts of projects in
2011.  Shipments in China “will gradually pick up in the second
quarter and the third quarter,” driven by the Golden Sun
program and “the acceleration of utility-scale projects in
western China,” Miao said in the statement.  Total shipments of solar panels increased by 44 percent in
the first three months of this year from the prior quarter.  First-quarter revenue was $500 million, down 5.2 percent
from a year earlier. The net loss was $45 million, or 29 cents a
share, 7 cents less than the average of 14  estimates  compiled by
Bloomberg.  Suntech Power Holdings Co. is the biggest solar
manufacturer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
