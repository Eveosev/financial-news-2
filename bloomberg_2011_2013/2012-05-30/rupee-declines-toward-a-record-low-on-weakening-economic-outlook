India ’s rupee fell for a second day,
approaching a record low, before a government report that
economists predict will show gross domestic product rose at the
slowest pace since 2009.  Asia ’s third-largest  economy  probably expanded 6.1 percent
in the first three months of this year, matching the preceding
period’s pace that was the slowest in 11 quarters, according to
the median of 31 estimates in a Bloomberg News survey. The data
are due tomorrow. The rupee also weakened after the Bank of
 Spain  said the nation’s economy will sink deeper into a
recession, fueling concern  Europe ’s debt crisis will worsen.  “The expectation for the fiscal year through March 2013 is
bearish with risk of slippage in GDP growth” in India, J. Moses
Harding, executive vice president at  IndusInd Bank Ltd. (IIB)  in
Mumbai, wrote in a report today. The rupee’s may drop “much
faster” than other emerging-market currencies, he wrote.  The rupee lost 1 percent to 56.2325 per dollar in Mumbai,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It touched a record low
of 56.3875 on May 24 and has lost 6.2 percent this month in
Asia’s worst currency performance.  The rupee’s one-month implied volatility, a measure of
exchange-rate swings used to price options, rose 15 basis
points, or 0.15 percentage point, to 13.5 percent.  Three-month onshore currency forwards traded at 57.13 a
dollar, compared with 56.77 yesterday, and offshore non-
deliverable contracts were at 57.42 from 56.95. Forwards are
agreements to buy or sell assets at a set price and date. Non-
deliverable contracts are settled in dollars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
