Transporting wind power from the
 North Sea  to German consumers will cost about 12 billion euros
($15 billion), grid operator TenneT TSO GmbH said.  TenneT has earmarked 6 billion euros to build grid
connection projects and is in talks with the German government
to make sure that another 6 billion euros can be raised, Martin Fuchs, the head of the operator, said today in Berlin.  “We are in promising talks with the government to
especially clear up the liability question, which would then
enable us to find investors,” Fuchs told reporters. “I’m
convinced this will be solved.”  Germany  aims to install 25 gigawatts of sea-based wind-
turbines in its waters by 2030. Utilities EON AG and  RWE AG (RWE)  have
called on the government to eradicate delays in connecting their
wind farms to the grid. They’re also concerned about who will
compensate them for the delays, which they blame on a lack of
capital at grid operators and issues with acquiring cables and
transformer stations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
