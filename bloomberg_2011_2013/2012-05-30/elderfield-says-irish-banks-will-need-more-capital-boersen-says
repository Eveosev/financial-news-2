Irish Central Bank Deputy Governor
Matthew Elderfield said the country’s banks may need to raise up
to 4 billion euros ($5 billion) in additional capital in the
next six years,  Germany ’s Boersen-Zeitung reported, citing an
interview.  “In the medium term they will certainly need more capital,
simply because of stricter international capital requirements,”
Elderfield is quoted as saying. “In the next five to six years,
Irish banks may need a further 3 to 4 billion euros.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
