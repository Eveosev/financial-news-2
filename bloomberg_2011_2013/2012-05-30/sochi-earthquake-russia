A 4.2-magnitude earthquake rattled
Sochi, the Russian  Black Sea  resort that will host the Winter
Olympics in less than two years, the Emergency Ministry said.  “People in Sochi felt it,” Irina Andrianova, a
spokeswoman for the ministry, said by phone today. “Aftershocks
are possible.”  The epicenter was under the Black Sea about 30 kilometers
from Sochi’s coast, Andrianova said. No injuries were reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
