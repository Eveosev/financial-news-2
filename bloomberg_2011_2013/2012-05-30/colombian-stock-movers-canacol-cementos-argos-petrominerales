The following companies had unusual
price changes in Bogota trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses, and prices are as of the market close.  The  IGBC Index (IGBC)  dropped 1.7 percent to 14,395.27, while the
 Colcap Index (COLCAP)  decreased 1.1 percent to 1,693.06.  Cementos Argos SA (CEMARGOS)  , the country’s biggest
cement maker, dropped 1.8 percent to 11,200 pesos, the lowest
since April 13. The company will suspend trading of its shares
for six trading days beginning tomorrow as part of a plan
announced last year to transfer assets to Inversiones Argos SA,
according to a regulatory filing on May 16. Today’s decline
“reflects the effect from some investors looking to leave their
positions ahead of the stock’s suspension,” said Santiago Avila, an analyst at Asesores en Valores SA, in a phone
interview.  Other oil producers fell as crude tumbled to a seven-month
