What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets, which open at 5 p.m. on the
 Chicago  Board of Trade.  -- Corn futures may open 1 cent to 2 cents a bushel higher on
the Chicago Board of Trade because of dry weather in parts of
the U.S. Midwest including Iowa and Illinois, the biggest
growers of the grain, in the past week,  Jason Britt , the
president of brokerage Central States Commodities Inc. in  Kansas
City , Missouri, said by telephone.  -- Soybean futures may open up 1 cent to 2 cents a bushel in
Chicago on the lack of rain during the past week in the U.S.,
Britt said. Soybean-oil futures are expected to open steady to
0.1 cent higher, and soybean-meal futures may open $1 to $2
higher per 2,000 pounds.  -- Wheat futures may open 2 cents to 3 cents a bushel higher on
the CBOT, the Kansas City Board of Trade and the  Minneapolis
Grain Exchange  on speculation that the price, which has dropped
3.9 percent on the CBOT in the past two days, will make the
grain more attractive to users and speculative investors, Britt
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
