Turk Hava Yollari (THYAO)  AO, the carrier
known as  Turkish Airlines , canceled 68 flights from Istanbul’s
Ataturk airport today, citing “operational reasons,” the
state-run Anatolia news agency said today.  Turkish Airlines canceled more than 100 flights yesterday
due to industrial action amid an ongoing pay dispute, Transport
Minister Binali Yildirim said. Employees at Turkish Airlines
went on a go-slow action to protest a proposal in parliament to
ban strikes in civil aviation, labor union Hava-Is said on its
website yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
