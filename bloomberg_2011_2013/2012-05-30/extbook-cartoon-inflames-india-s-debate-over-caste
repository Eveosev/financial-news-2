A widely praised Indian  political science textbook  for high-school students became the object of controversy and -- regrettably, but unsurprisingly -- violence earlier this month after a member of Parliament claimed that it contained a  cartoon  offensive to  BR Ambedkar , the Dalit (or low-caste) intellectual considered the architect of the Indian constitution, and to Dalits in general. To be sure, the matter wasn't a free-speech issue, like the  Rushdie affair  at the Jaipur Literary Festival in January, and it wasn't an example of crude political paranoia over cartoons, like the case of  West Bengal's Chief Minister  Mamata Banerjee  in April. Even so, Education Minister  Kapil Sibal  certainly struck a blow both against the ideal of teaching reasoned debate and against due process in the adjudication of disputes among adults, when  he apologized  for hurting the sentiments of the Dalit community and promised that the cartoon  would be removed  from future editions of the textbook. The cartoon  -- by the famous Indian cartoonist  Keshav Shankar Pilllai  -- was first published in 1948. It shows the first prime minister of India,  Jawaharlal Nehru , standing with a whip raised behind a large snail marked "Constitution," atop which rests the portly, bespectacled figure of Ambedkar, who holds the reins of the snail in one hand and a whip in the other. The scene is watched by a gaggle of Indian people. The cartoon transforms into a comic vignette the impatience felt by Nehru at the laborious progress of  India's Constituent Assembly  in the years following independence, when a  Drafting Committee  chaired by Ambedkar took almost three years to produce the draft of the constitution. The wait was actually worth every minute: it has turned out to be  a very serviceable constitution . Uncontroversial in its own time and its original context, the cartoon, once flagged as incendiary, was seized upon by many lower-caste politicians in Parliament, such as  Mayawati , and outside as derogatory to the millions of  Indians from the lower castes  who have in the last six decades made a difficult and often painful journey toward political empowerment and social mobility, helped in part by  affirmative-action policies  in education and employment. What gave such  protests and threats  a semblance of legitimacy is the  politics of competitive intolerance  that has now become ubiquitous in Indian public debate, whereby almost any strand of opinion can, by the application of a little real or concocted outrage, be branded guilty until proven innocent. In the wake of the controversy,  Suhas Palshikar and Yogendra Yadav , two political scientists serving as advisers to the  NCERT , the government body that had prepared the textbook in 2005, resigned. Palshikar's office was subsequently  ransacked by members of a Dalit political party , who thereby showed the same violence toward a different point of view that Dalit activists had themselves suffered recently at a " beef festival " promoted by them in Hyderabad to question the sanctity of high-caste taboos against the eating of beef. Palshikar graciously desisted from filing charges against the miscreants. The government's reaction to the cartoon controversy had two aspects: the concession in the first place that the cartoon did give offense, and the move thereafter to decide unilaterally that it would be removed from the textbook, which was prepared by a team of historians and was passed by an NCERT committee that should have been the body to which the matter was referred back. Yogendra Yadav usefully pointed out the faults with both interpretation and excision in an essay in the  Indian Express : And an ingenious reading of the cartoon was supplied in the same paper by Dharminder Kumar,  who wrote : The case for the defense was made most impressively by an editorial in the  Economic and Political Weekly : The best case for the prosecution was made in  Outlook by the journalist S. Anand , who also runs Navayana, a publishing house devoted exclusively to books on caste issues, including several titles  by or on Ambedkar . Although Anand agreed that the textbook itself was very impressive, he was less sanguine than Kumar about the process of interpretation of the cartoon. Given the history of caste prejudice in  India  and the persistence of such ideas among many upper castes, the cartoon, he thought, could be framed in damaging ways by upper-caste teachers or schools where upper-caste ways of thinking were invisibly normative. Nor did Anand view the cartoon as being without prejudice -- even if it was unconscious prejudice. He wrote: These are certainly arguments worth considering, though the abuse heaped on Anand by readers in the comments section -- "Hindu hating," "pseudo-secular" and "fascist" -- is worth reading as a reliable guide to the violent language, miniscule lexicon and depressingly predictable rhetorical memes of a sizeable percentage of responses to arguments in periodicals about Indian issues. One wonders what pan-Indian training school produces such a mass of respondents undistinguished in themselves and undistinguishable from one another. I don't agree with Anand though when he says the cartoon could be excised because it might be used by upper-caste teachers or students to stereotype Dalit students as "slow" or inferior. If this is the case, then clearly a lot more needs to be worked on urgently than just one cartoon. Moreover, in an atmosphere of (depending on the situation) residual or entrenched caste prejudice, could one protect Dalit students enough from the reality of some of it filtering through? Removing the cartoon now might actually provoke more cruel jeers in classrooms than letting it stay. Given the enormous time-span over which caste prejudice has existed in India and disabled and dehumanized immense numbers of people, it is inevitable that the struggle of Dalits for respect, equality, and empowerment -- helped by the very constitution that for the first time made them, in spirit if not yet in practice, citizens with the same rights as all others -- will not be without all kinds of impediments. When, in the  Indian novelist UR Ananthamurthy 's fine image, the wheels of history are made to turn after centuries of stasis, the old elites can't be expected to cede power easily. While Ambedkar's constitution provided a road down which those wheels could travel, the actual work of keeping those wheels moving had to be done -- is being done -- by generations of Dalits after him (some inspired by the  American civil-rights movement) . By trying to censor a textbook by force, Dalit politicians actually do their cause a disservice by bringing their acts of resistance down to the same level as  other forces in India  that are happy to use the power of an appeal to emotions and the threat of violence to suffocate debate. As Ambedkar himself might have suggested -- and in this sense the cartoon is a helpful guide even to those who oppose its presence in the textbook -- it is better to try to work the reins before one looks to crack the whip.
