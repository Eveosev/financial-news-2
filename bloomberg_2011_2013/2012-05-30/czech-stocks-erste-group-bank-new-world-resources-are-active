The Czech Republic’s  PX (PX)  stock index
slid 0.2 percent to 876.70 at the end of trading in Prague.  The following were among the most active  equities  in the
Czech market today. Stock symbols follow company names.  Erste Group Bank AG (RBAG)   of Austria lost 2.1 percent
to 369.9 koruna, snapping a two-day gain. Lenders were among the
biggest stock decliners in  Europe  as  Spain  struggled to bolster
its banking industry and Italy’s funding costs rose in an
auction.  New World Resources Plc (NWR)  , the biggest Czech coking-
coal producer, fell 5.8 percent to 97 koruna, its lowest close
in almost three years. Commodities tumbled, sending Europe’s
