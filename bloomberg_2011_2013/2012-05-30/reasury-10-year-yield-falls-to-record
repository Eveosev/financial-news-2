Treasury 10-year note yields fell to
a record low as investors sought refuge from the deteriorating
credit conditions of European sovereign borrowers.  The benchmark yield  reached  1.6085 percent, less than its
previous all-time low of 1.6714 percent on Sept. 23, as Spain
struggled to recapitalize its banks and Italian bonds fell as
the country sold less than its target at a debt auction. The
 Federal Reserve  announced Sept. 21 that it would buy $400
billion of longer-term Treasuries, funding the purchases with
sales of shorter-term notes, in an effort to bolster the  U.S.
economy  and spur jobs growth.  “The continued rally is evidence by flight to quality that
is being exacerbated by the lack of other safe assets,” said
Michael Pond, co-head of interest-rate strategy in New York at
Barclays Plc, one of 21 primary dealers that trade with the Fed.
“The lack of progress in Europe is causing increased angst in
the Treasury market.  Benchmark 10-year note yields fell 12 basis points to 1.62
percent at 5:02 p.m. New York time after touching the lowest in
 Fed figures  beginning in 1953. The 1.75 percent note due May
2022 added 1 1/8, or $11.25 per $1,000 face amount, to 101 5/32,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The yield drop was
the biggest for the benchmark note since April.  Lower Yields  Thirty-year bond yields declined 13 basis points, the most
since November, to 2.71 percent, the least since October. Five-
and seven-year note yields reached set all-time lows.  Benchmark government bond markets around the world are
setting records on haven demand while yielding less than
Treasuries, boosting the appeal of the U.S. securities.  Yields on the 10-year note are 21 basis points  higher  than
the average for top-rate sovereign debt of nations from Germany
to Australia, above the average of 12 basis points in the past
year, data compiled by Bloomberg show. German  two-year  debt
yields fell as low zero today, compared with 0.27 for U.S. two-
year notes.  ‘‘People want to invest in the safe haven assets,’’ said
 Peter Fisher , head of fixed income at  BlackRock Inc. (BLK) , on
Bloomberg Television’s ‘‘InsideTrack’’ with  Erik Schatzker , Sara
Eisen,  Stephanie Ruhle  and Scarlet Fu. ‘‘You don’t buy
Treasuries or bunds, either one, as a return play.’’  Previous Levels  U.S. 10-year yields are down from 5.3 percent in June 2007,
before the financial crisis intensified, and below the average
of 4.96 percent during the past 20 years. Treasuries have
returned 2.6 percent since the end of March, according to Bank
of America Merrill Lynch indexes, after returning 9.8 percent
last year, including reinvested interest, the most since 2008.  The 10-year yield may decline to 1.5 percent, said FTN
Financial Chief Economist Christopher Low, the most accurate
forecaster of Treasury note yields in 2011. Low was the only one
among 70 analysts in a Bloomberg News survey who predicted the
yield would fall to 2 percent by the end of last year.  ‘‘Today’s move is huge and it’s driven almost entirely by
fear,” Low said. “The pace of events in  Europe  has accelerated
and it’s accelerating at the same time European leaders seem to
be reaching an impasse on solutions.”  The difference in yields between 10-year notes and Treasury
Inflation Protected Securities, or TIPS, which represents
traders’ expectations for the rate of inflation over the life of
the bonds, fell to 2.01 percentage points, the lowest since Jan.
17. It touched a 2012 low of 1.9 percentage points on Jan. 3 and
a high of 2.45 percentage points on March 20.  Inflation Watch  “I don’t think there’s any inflation in the cards, not
with the slack in the labor markets and the headwinds being
presented by the European crisis,” said  David Coard , head of
fixed-income trading in  New York  at Williams Capital Group, a
brokerage for institutional investors.  A  measure  of price-increase predictions used by the Fed to
set policy, the five-year, five-year forward break-even rate,
which gauges the average inflation rate between 2017 and 2022,
was 2.53 percent on May 25, down from a 2012 high of 2.78
percent on March 19. The rate slid nine basis points in April,
the biggest monthly decline since December.  The difference between yields on Treasuries maturing in two
and 30 years, known as the yield curve, narrowed to 2.45
percentage points, the lowest since January 2009.  “Investors are creeping out the curve looking for yield,”
Barclays’ Pond said. “If it were a normal flight to quality,
investors would just flock into the short end.”  Benchmark Securities  Yields on U.S. 10-year notes, which are benchmarks for
everything from mortgages to corporate bonds, fell in each of
the nine weeks through May 18, the longest stretch since 1998.
Treasuries gained for nine weeks through the period ended Oct.
2, 1998, when investors sought safety amid declines in Asian
currencies, a default by Russia on its sovereign debt and the
collapse of hedge fund Long-Term Capital Management LP.  While the amount of Treasuries  outstanding  has more than
doubled to $10.4 trillion since 2007, a decline in securities
globally deemed safe enough to meet tougher  bank regulations  has
made the debt seem scarce. Citigroup Inc. says the pool of
“high-quality” debt from the U.S., U.K.,  Germany  and nine
other European countries is 72 percent of what it was in 2007.  “There is no interest-rate bogey man lurking ahead,” said
 Kevin Flanagan , a Purchase, New York-based fixed-income
strategist for Morgan Stanley Smith Barney. “I can’t make the
argument for rates to move up visibly higher from here because
you still have all of these forces weighing on the whole U.S.
rate structure.”  Bank Demand  Banks have increased Treasury holdings 5.2 percent since
December to $475.8 billion while boosting their stake in
mortgage debt sold by government sponsored enterprises  Fannie
Mae  and Freddie Mac 7.4 percent to $1.3 trillion, Fed data show.
The combined amount is up from $1.25 trillion in 2008.  Primary dealer holdings of  U.S. government debt  rose to
$108 billion, the highest ever, as of May 16, from a net bet
against the securities of $11.9 billion in September, according
to the Fed. Banks have added Treasuries to meet revised reserve
rules from the Dodd-Frank financial-overhaul law and Basel III
regulations set by the  Bank for International Settlements  in
Basel, Switzerland.  Central banks, led by the Fed, have also taken Treasuries
out of the market. The Fed has increased its position in U.S.
government debt to $1.67 trillion from $475 billion in March
2009 as it undertook two rounds of asset purchases to bolster
the economy. Foreign central banks hold $2.78 trillion of U.S.
government debt in custody at the Fed, a $90.6 billion or 3.4
percent increase from the end of 2011, central bank data shows.  Fed Buys  The Fed bought $4.74 billion of Treasuries maturing from
August 2020 to February 2022 today as part of its program to
replace $400 billion of short-term debt in its portfolio with
longer-term Treasuries.  Even at historically low yields, investors are showing a
greater reluctance to sell the debt. Average weekly trading
volume in April among the 21 primary dealers was $495.7 billion,
or 4.8 percent of the amount outstanding. That’s down from $649
billion in June 2007, or 15 percent of the $4.3 trillion
outstanding. Back then, the 10-year note yield reached 5.32
percent.  Valuation measures show Treasuries are near the most
expensive levels ever. The term premium, a model created by
economists at the Fed, touched negative 0.86 percent, the most
expensive level ever. A negative reading indicates investors are
willing to accept yields below what’s considered fair value.  Auction Detail  Investors have bid $3.19 for each of the $903 billion of
notes and bonds sold by the U.S. so far this year, a faster pace
than the record $3.04 bid for each of the $2.1 trillion
auctioned by the Treasury in 2011.  Top-rated assets are in short supply worldwide. The U.S.,
Germany, Switzerland, Sweden and the U.K. are the only Group-
of-10 nations with credit-default swaps trading at less than 100
basis points, the cheapest to insure against default, down from
eight a year ago, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s AAA Rated Global Fixed
Income Index contained 3,597 securities with the highest ratings
as of April 30, down from a high of 5,331 in December 2007 and
the fewest since November 2005. AAA debt assets have returned
about 2.18 percent, including reinvested interest, according to
the index. Ten-year Treasuries have gained 2.53 percent.  The  average rate  on a typical 30-year fixed-rate mortgage
reached a record-low 3.78 percent on May 24, down from 4.08
percent on March 22, according to Freddie Mac surveys.  Corporate Debt  Company bond offerings worldwide have fallen behind the
pace set in 2011 after a record first quarter fizzled out amid
Europe’s escalating debt crisis and a U.S. slowdown. Sales of
$1.63 trillion this year compare with the $1.73 trillion for the
same period of 2011. As recently as the end of April, offerings
were ahead of last year.  The 10-year Treasury yield has plunged since reaching 2.40
percent on March 20, the highest since October, on speculation
that the pace of gains in the U.S. labor market was increasing
and as investors in Greece’s sovereign debt agreed to
restructure the loans at a discount to their original face
value.  “There’s this flight to quality around the globe,” said
 Thomas Tucci , head of U.S. government-bond trading at  CIBC World
Markets  in New York. “A lot of people have been caught off
guard.”  Economic Outcomes  The economic outlook is for faster growth in the U.S. than
in Europe. America’s gross domestic product will expand 2.3
percent this year, according to the median forecast of 74
economists, while Europe’s economic output shrinks 0.35 percent,
the median estimate of 32 economists in separate Bloomberg
surveys show.  The European Commission called for direct euro-area aid for
troubled banks, and touted a Europe-wide deposit-guarantee
system and common bond issuance as antidotes to the debt crisis
threatening to overwhelm  Spain .  Italy sold 5.73 billion euros of five- and 10-year debt,
falling short of the maximum target of 6.25 billion euros ($7.1
billion). The average yield on the five-year security was 5.66
percent, up from 4.86 percent at an auction of similar-maturity
debt on April 27. The 10-year yield was 6.03 percent, from 5.84
percent in April.  “Bunds and Treasuries will remain fairly well bid until we
have a political solution,” said  Christopher Sullivan , who
oversees $1.9 billion as chief investment officer at United
Nations Federal Credit Union in New York. “At the present time,
a solution seems well off. We don’t see any catalysts to reverse
the progression to lower yields.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
