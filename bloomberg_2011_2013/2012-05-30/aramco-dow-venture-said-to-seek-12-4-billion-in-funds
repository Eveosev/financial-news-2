Saudi Arabian Oil Co. and  Dow
Chemical Co. (DOW)  sent requests to banks for $12.4 billion in
financing for Sadara Chemical Co., their $20 billion joint
venture, two bankers with knowledge of the situation said.  The Saudi company, also known as  Saudi Aramco , and Dow
Chemical plan to raise $2.66 billion in bank loans, $1.4 billion
from the sale of Islamic bonds, $6.5 billion from export credit
agency financing, $1.3 billion from Saudi’s Public Investment
Fund, and $530 million from the Saudi Industrial Development
Fund, the people said, declining to be identified because the
information is private. The requests were sent out this week,
they said.  The banks have until July 23 to express interest, and the
financing may be completed by December, they said. Saudi Aramco
and Dow Chemical have hired  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS)  and
 Riyad Bank (RIBL)  as financial advisers, they said.  Nicole Hayde, a spokeswoman for RBS in Dubai, declined to
comment. Riyad Bank’s public relations department didn’t return
calls from Bloomberg. Saudi Aramco declined to comment. Rebecca
Bentley, a spokeswoman for Midland, Michigan-based Dow, said she
couldn’t immediately comment.  Sadara may begin production in 2015, with 40 percent of its
output being exported to Asia and as much as 35 percent to the
 Middle East  and Africa, Dow Chemical Chief Executive Officer
Andrew Liveris said May 3.  To contact the reporters on this story:
