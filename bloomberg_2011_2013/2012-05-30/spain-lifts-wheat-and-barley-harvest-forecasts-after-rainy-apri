Spain  raised the outlook for this
year’s wheat and barley harvests after April was wetter than
normal and now expects the soft-wheat crop to slide 22 percent,
less than the drop expected a month ago.  Soft-wheat production this year will fall to 4.63 million
metric tons from 5.96 million tons in 2011, based on conditions
at the end of March, the  Agriculture Ministry  wrote in an online
 report  dated yesterday. It predicted a 4.28 million ton harvest
of the grain last month.  Spain on average had 85 millimeters (3.35 inches) of rain
in April, 20 millimeters above normal for the month, following
the driest December-to-February period since at least 1947 and
the least rain in March since 1997, the ministry reported May 4.
The rain mitigated dry winter conditions, the European Union’s
crop-forecasting unit reported yesterday.  “Precipitation had arrived just in time to mitigate the
potential negative effects that the long dry period from
December could have caused in northern and central Spain,” the
EU’s Monitoring Agricultural Resources unit wrote. “Soft wheat
and barley in Castilla La Mancha and Castilla y Leon have
benefited substantially from this rainfall.”  Harvesting of durum wheat, the hard variety used to make
pasta and couscous, is forecast to slide 42 percent to 545,200
tons, compared with a previous outlook for a crop of 597,900
tons, the ministry wrote.  Rainfall in the south of Spain arrived too late because
winter grains were already in their grain-filling stage, cutting
yields for durum wheat, according to the EU’s crop unit.  Spain’s total wheat output is forecast to fall 25 percent
to 5.18 million tons, compared with the 4.97 million tons
expected a month ago and down from 6.9 million tons in 2011.  Spanish farmers may harvest 5.88 million tons of barley
this year, slumping 29 percent from 2011 and up from the
previous outlook of 5.65 million tons, the ministry wrote.  Corn planting is expected to slip 3.8 percent to 355,400
hectares (878,193 acres), based on the situation at the end of
April, according to the ministry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
