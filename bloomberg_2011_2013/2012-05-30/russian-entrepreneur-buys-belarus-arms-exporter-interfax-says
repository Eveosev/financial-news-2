Russian businessman Dmitry Gurinovich
acquired control of Beltech Holding, a group of Belarusian arms
producers and traders, Interfax  reported , citing an unidentified
official at the holding’s export unit, Beltechexport.  Vladimir Peftiev, who previously headed the weapons
exporter, fully ceded his stake in the group to Gurinovich, the
Russian news service reported. The European Union last year
froze the assets of Peftiev and three companies controlled by
him while also barring the businessman from entering the bloc.  Beltech Holding’s press service in Minsk declined to
comment. Gurinovich couldn’t be reached for comment.  The deal gives Beltechexport a stronger foothold on the
international weapons market, according to Interfax. Beltech is
the largest association of arms companies in Belarus, the
country’s State Military Industrial Committee  said  on its
website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
