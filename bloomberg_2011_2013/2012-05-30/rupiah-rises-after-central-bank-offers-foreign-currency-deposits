Indonesia ’s rupiah climbed the most
in more than three years and bonds gained after the central bank
said it will offer to take foreign-currency term deposits from
lenders to boost the supply of dollars.  Bank Indonesia  will accept seven-, 14-day and one-month
deposits at weekly auctions, allowing local lenders to bring
back about $2 billion per day from offshore banks, Deputy
Governor Halim Alamsyah said yesterday. The rupiah has slumped
2.7 percent in May after global funds cut holdings of local
stocks by $720 million, exchange data show.  The central bank’s “measure would help in mitigating the
de-risking in the region,” said  Philip Wee , a Singapore-based
senior currency economist at DBS Group Holdings Ltd. “The
rupiah’s trend is part of a broader  risk aversion .”  The rupiah surged 1.9 percent, the most since April 2009,
to 9,435 per dollar as of 4:34 p.m. in Jakarta, according to
prices from local banks compiled by Bloomberg. The currency
closed at 9,616 yesterday, the weakest level since November
2009.  One-month implied volatility, which measures exchange-rate
swings used to price options, rose 50 basis points, or 0.5
percentage point, to 17.5 percent.  “Bank Indonesia’s initiative to offer dollar deposits is
structurally positive but may do little to address the
structural dislocation in the onshore market,” analysts at
Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp. led by  Selena Ling  wrote in a
report today.  The yield on the government’s 7 percent bonds due May 2022
dropped three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 6.52
percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The notes are
headed for the biggest monthly since in November after yields
rose 58 basis points in May.  To contact the reporter on this story:
