German 10-year government bond yields
were within three basis points of a record low as Italy
prepared to sell as much as 6.25 billion euros ($7.8 billion) of
five- and 10-year debt.  Thirty-year German securities held a five-day advance.
Bunds headed for their biggest monthly gain this year before a
report that economists said will show economic confidence in the
euro region fell to the least since 2009.  German 10-year yields rose one basis point, or 0.01
percentage point, to 1.37 percent at 7:30 a.m. London time,
after falling to 1.345 percent yesterday, the least on record.
The 1.75 percent security due in July 2022 slipped 0.07, or 70
euro cents per 1,000-euro face amount, to 103.58.  The 30-year yield was at 1.92 percent.  German bonds maturing in more than a year returned 2.2
percent this month, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg
and the European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies.
Thatâ€™s the most since they gained 3.1 percent in December.
Italian securities lost 1.7 percent, the indexes show.  -- Editor:  Paul Dobson   To contact the reporters on this story:
