State-owned Rosneftegaz may spend as
much as 130 billion rubles ($4 billion) to buy new shares of
 Russia ’s state companies in the energy sector,  Vedomosti 
reported today, citing government officials it didn’t name.  The deal is proposed as a part of Russia’s privatization
plan approved by the President Vladimir Putin May 22, the
newspaper said. It is not clear yet in which state companies
Rosneftegaz may invest, Vedomosti said.  Rosneftegaz already holds stakes in  OAO Gazprom (GAZP)  and  OAO
Rosneft. (ROSN)   To contact the reporter on this story:
