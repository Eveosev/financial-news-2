Turk Hava Yollari AO (THYAO) , the national
carrier known as  Turkish Airlines , fell to the lowest in more
than two months after canceling flights for a second day amid a
pay dispute.  The stock dropped 1.6 percent to 2.52 liras at the close in
Istanbul, the lowest since March 13.  The airline canceled 68 flights from Istanbul’s Ataturk
airport today, citing “operational reasons,” the state-run
Anatolia news agency reported today.  The carrier canceled more than 100 flights yesterday as
employees resorted to work slow-down and after its website was
hacked, Transport Minister Binali Yildirim said.  Employees are protesting a proposal in the Turkish
parliament banning strikes in civil aviation, labor union Hava-
Is said yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
