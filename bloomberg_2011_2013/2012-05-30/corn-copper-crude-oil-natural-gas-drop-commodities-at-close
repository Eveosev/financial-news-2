The Standard & Poor’s GSCI  gauge  of
24 commodities fell 1 percent to 611.56 at 5:18 p.m. Singapore
time. The UBS Bloomberg CMCI  index  of 26 raw materials decreased
1.1 percent to 1,455.874.  CRUDE OIL  Oil fell for a second day, heading for the biggest monthly
drop in more than three years, before a report that may show
stockpiles climbed to the highest level since 1990 in the U.S.,
the world’s biggest crude user.  Crude for July delivery decreased as much as $1.01 to
$89.75 a barrel in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  and was at $89.96 at 8:58 a.m.  London  time. The
contract yesterday slid 10 cents to $90.76, the lowest close
since May 24. Prices are down 14.2 percent this month, the
biggest drop since December 2008.  NATURAL GAS  Natural gas futures fell, sliding as much as 12 percent in
four days, on forecasts for cooler weather in the U.S. Northeast
that may cut power-plant demand.  Gas for July delivery declined as much as 3.3 cents, or 1.3
percent, to $2.452 per million British thermal units in
electronic trading today on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
That followed yesterday’s decline of 5.4 percent, the biggest
drop since March 1, as Commodity Weather Group LLC in Bethesda,
 Maryland , predicted normal or below-normal temperatures in the
Northeast from June 3 through June 12 as a heat wave dissipates.
The June contract expired yesterday.  OIL PRODUCTS  Singapore fuel oil’s discount to Dubai crude, a measure of
refining losses from making the fuel, widened to $1.86 a metric
ton from $1.47 yesterday, PVM data showed. The spread is at the
widest since May 16.  High-sulfur fuel-oil swaps for June fell $6.25, or 1
percent, to $645 a metric ton at 10:21 a.m. Singapore time,
according to data from PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a broker.  Singapore gasoil swaps for June fell 55 cents, or 0.5
percent, to $118.30 a barrel, PVM data showed. The premium of
gasoil to Dubai crude was at $14.87 a barrel, up 5 cents from
yesterday.  PRECIOUS METALS  Gold declined for a second day in London as concern about
 Europe ’s debt crisis strengthened the dollar and curbed the
metal’s appeal as an alternative asset.  Bullion for immediate delivery fell 0.5 percent to
$1,548.22 an ounce by 9:29 a.m. in London. Prices reached a one-
week low of $1,545.88 today and are 7 percent lower in May for a
fourth monthly decline, the longest losing run since 1999.
August-delivery futures were little changed at $1,549.30 on the
Comex in  New York .  BASE METALS  Copper, poised for the biggest monthly drop since
September, fell for a second day in London as a reduction of
 Spain ’s credit rating revived concern the euro-region debt
crisis may threaten demand.  Copper for three-month delivery declined 1.2 percent to
$7,577 a metric ton by 9:40 a.m. on the London Metal Exchange.
Prices are down 9.8 percent this month. July-delivery copper
fell 1.2 percent to $3.422 a pound on the Comex in New York.  GRAINS, SOFT COMMODITIES  Corn traded near a 17-month low and wheat declined for a
second day as investors shunned riskier assets on concern that
the  European debt crisis  is deepening and as  China  damped
speculation of a large-scale stimulus.  Corn for July delivery slipped as much as 0.7 percent to
$5.5875 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade. Futures
yesterday declined as much as 3.7 percent to $5.57, the lowest
level since December 2010. They traded at $5.5925 a bushel at
3:35 p.m. Singapore time, set for an 11.9 percent decline this
month, and a 13.5 percent loss this year.  July-delivery wheat fell as much as 1.5 percent to $6.4675
a bushel, the lowest for the most-active contract since May 17.
Prices are down 1.1 percent this month and 0.8 percent lower
this year as crop conditions improved in the U.S.  Rubber declined, snapping a three-day advance, amid
expectations that production in  Thailand  will increase
seasonally, adding to a supply glut in China.  November-delivery rubber lost as much as 2.2 percent to
265.8 yen a kilogram ($3,350 a metric ton) before settling at
271.7 yen on the Tokyo Commodity Exchange. The most-active
contract has lost 13.2 percent this month, the largest drop
since September, paring this year’s advance to 3.2 percent.  Palm oil  fell for the first time in five days, heading for
the biggest monthly loss since September 2009, on concern that
demand for cooking oil in China, the biggest buyer, may weaken
in the absence of stimulus measures.  To contact the reporter on this story:
