Italy  sold less than the maximum
amount of debt and borrowing costs rose at an auction as
concern deepened the debt crisis is spreading, driving the
10-year yield to 6 percent for the first time in two weeks.  Italy auctioned 5.73 billion euros ($7.1 billion) of five-
and 10-year bonds, less than the 6.25 billion-euro maximum
target for the sale. The Treasury priced the 10-year debt to
yield 6.03 percent, the highest since Jan. 30 and up from 5.84
percent at the previous auction on April 27.  “While things are going from bad to worse in  Spain , the
uncertainty surrounding Greece’s membership of the  euro zone  is
weighing heavily on sentiment,” Nicholas Spiro, managing
director at Spiro Sovereign Strategy in London, said in a note
after the sale. “Italy is currently experiencing an externally
driven deterioration in its perceived creditworthiness.”  European leaders remain divided on solutions to prevent a
breakup of the 17-nation currency bloc. As they put pressure on
 Greece  to meet bailout terms before elections next month,
concern is growing that Spanish lenders will need more financial
support to weather the crisis.  Spread Widens  The yield on Italy’s 10-year bond rose 17 basis points to
5.933 at 1:35 p.m. in Rome, after reaching 6.01 percent earlier.
The jump in yield pushed the difference with similar maturity
German debt to 461 basis points, the most since Jan. 19.  Greeks vote June 17 after an inconclusive May 6 ballot led
to a political impasse and raised speculation that the country
may leave the single currency. Spanish borrowing costs are
rising as its government tries to find a way to shore up the
Bankia group without overburdening the public finances.
The five year debt was sold to yield 5.66 percent, compared with
4.86 percent for a similar-maturity bond sold last month.  “Market dealers remain extremely cautious as the next
three weeks are crucial to see the future of the monetary
union,” Annalisa Piazza, a strategist at Newedge Group in
 London , wrote in a note to investors. “Despite the attractive
yield pickup for Italian bonds, dealers seem to be willing to
remain on a wait-and-see mode.  The Italian Treasury sold 2.34 billion euros of the 10-year
bond, less than the 3.5 billion euro maximum target. Investors
bid for 1.4 times the amount of deft offered, down from 1.48
times last month.  The Treasury also sold 3.4 billion euros of a new five-year
security to yield 5.66 percent, compared with 4.86 percent for a
similar-maturity bond sold last month. Investors bid for 1.35
times the five-year debt on offer, little changed from the 1.34
times on April 27.  To contact the reporter on this story:
