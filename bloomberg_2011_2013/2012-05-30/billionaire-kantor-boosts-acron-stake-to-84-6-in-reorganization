OAO Acron, a Russian fertilizer
maker, said it completed a merger with its subsidiary ZAO Granit
which held treasury shares in the company, according to an e-
mailed statement.  The reorganization reduced the number of Acron’s
outstanding shares to 40.5 million from 47.7 million, it said in
the statement. Billionaire owner Viatcheslav Kantor’s stake in
Acron rose to 84.6 percent as a result, the company’s press
office said in response to a query.  To contact the reporter on this story:
