the merchandising unit of Turkish sports club Besiktas, plunged
to the lowest level in almost two years, falling 8.8 percent to
4.33 liras, after saying in a statement to the Istanbul Stock
Exchange its soccer team has been banned from the Union of
European Football Associations, or UEFA, competitions for a year
and fined 200,000 euros ($248,000) for erroneous financial
statements.  Turk Hava Yollari (THYAO)  AO, the carrier known as
 Turkish Airlines , fell 1.6 percent to 2.52 liras, the lowest
