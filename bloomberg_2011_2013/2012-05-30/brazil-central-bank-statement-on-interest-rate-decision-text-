Following is a translation of the
statement by  Brazil ’s central bank on its interest rate decision
today.  “The Copom considers that, at the moment, the risks to the
inflation trajectory are limited. The committee also notes that,
until now, given the fragility of the global economy, the
contribution of the external sector has been disinflationary.  Given this, and giving continuity to the adjustment process
of monetary conditions, the Copom decided to reduce the Selic
rate to 8.5 percent per year without a bias.  Voting in favor of the reduction in the Selic rate to 8.5
percent are the following board members: President Alexandre
Antonio Tombini, Aldo Luiz Mendes,  Altamir Lopes , Anthero de
Moraes Meirelles, Carlos Hamilton Vasconcelos Araújo, Luiz Awazu
Pereira da Silva and Sidnei Corrêa Marques.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
