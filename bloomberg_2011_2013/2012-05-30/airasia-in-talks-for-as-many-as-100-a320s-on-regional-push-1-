AirAsia Bhd. (AIRA) , already sitting on the
biggest Airbus SAS A320 order backlog, said it was in talks for
as many as 100 more planes as it expands operations across the
region.  The airline has held discussions with Airbus on an order
for about 50 planes with 50 options, Chief Executive Officer
 Tony Fernandes  said in a Bloomberg TV interview from  Tokyo 
today. The board still needs to approve the plan and decide
whether the aircraft will be bought or leased, he said.  “We’re definitely short of capacity,” he said. “We’re in
a wonderful part of the world in Asia, where there is still a
tremendous amount of growth, and we want to get as much of that
growth as possible.”  Asia ’s largest budget operator may also accelerate fleet
plans for its new venture in  Japan , Fernandes said, as low-cost
carriers win a greater share of the region’s travel market. The
airline, based in Sepang, outside Kuala Lumpur, has about 275
A320s on order, including the planned neo variant, which will
feature new fuel-efficient engines.  The new Japanese venture, which is part-owned by  All Nippon
Airways Co. (9202) , is due to start flights from Tokyo’s Narita airport
in August. The unit may have 25 planes by the end of third year,
Fernandes said. The carrier previously said the fleet may total
about 30 by 2016.  100th A320  AirAsia, which also has operations in Thailand and
 Indonesia , took delivery of its 100th A320 planes last week. The
carrier signed a deal for 200 A320neo planes last year. Airbus,
based in Toulouse, France, plans to begin delivering A320neos in
late 2015.  The  carrier  fell 0.9 percent to 3.51 ringgit at close of
trading in Kuala Lumpur. Thai affiliate, Asia Aviation Pcl, is
set to begin trading in Bangkok tomorrow after its initial
public offering. The Indonesian unit’s planned share offering
may slip to the first quarter of next year, Fernandes said.  AirAsia Japan is one of three budget operators starting
flights in the country this year. Peach Aviation Ltd., also
part-owned by ANA, began services in March. Jetstar Japan, whose
shareholders include Qantas Airways Ltd. and Japan Airlines Co.,
is due to start flights in July. The new airlines are
challenging  Skymark Airlines Inc. (9204) , the country’s biggest budget
carrier.  AirAsia Japan will offer 10,000 tickets from Tokyo to
Sapporo, Fukuoka and Okinawa for 5 yen each as part of a
promotion for its debut, Chief Executive Officer Kazuyuki Iwakata told reporters in Tokyo today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
