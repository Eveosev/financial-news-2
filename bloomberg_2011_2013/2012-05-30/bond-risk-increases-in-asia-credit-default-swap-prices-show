The cost of insuring corporate and
sovereign bonds from default rose in Asia, according to traders
of credit-default swaps.  The  Markit iTraxx Asia  index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  advanced 1 basis point to 193 basis
points as of 8:27 a.m. in Hong Kong, according to  Credit
Agricole SA. (ACA)  The gauge is set for an increase of 28 basis points
since April 30, the biggest monthly gain since September,
according to data provider CMA.  The  Markit iTraxx Japan  index climbed 2 basis points to 189
as of 9:38 a.m. in  Tokyo , Citigroup Inc. prices show. The
benchmark reached 217.3 basis points on May 18, the highest
since Oct. 5, according to CMA, which is owned by CME Group Inc.
and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the privately
negotiated market.  The  Markit iTraxx Australia  index was little changed at 192
basis points as of 10:27 a.m. in Sydney, Credit Agricole prices
show. The measure is on track to rise 37 basis points this
month, its biggest same-period rise since September.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
