RWE AG (RWE)  reduced the number of turbines
by a third at a wind project it’s planning offshore the U.K. to
curb its visual and environmental impact.  RWE Npower Renewables Ltd., the company’s clean energy unit
in Britain, will apply for permission to build a maximum of 278
turbines at the Atlantic Array project instead of 417, according
to a statement e-mailed today.  The decision follows environmental and engineering studies
as well as public feedback on the project in the Bristol
Channel, according to the statement. It also altered boundary of
the project.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
