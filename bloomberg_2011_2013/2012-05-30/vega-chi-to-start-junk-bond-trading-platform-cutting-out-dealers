Vega-Chi Ltd., the operator of a
trading platform in Europe for convertible and high-yield debt,
plans to offer a service in the U.S. for  junk bonds  as soon as
July.  Vega-Chi received regulatory approval as a broker-dealer
from the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority in April and
began marketing this month, said Constantinos Antoniades, the
former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. trader who founded the London-
based firm.  The company matches buyers’ and sellers’ orders, bypassing
traditional market makers. Its effort comes as Wall Street’s
biggest banks are paring their balance sheets, cutting
inventories of corporate bonds before the so-called Volcker rule
and amid increased volatility stemming from Europe’s sovereign-
debt crisis.  “The world is changing, and we’re positioned to take
advantage,” Antoniades said today in an interview in  New York .  Speculative-grade bonds are rated below Baa3 by Moody’s
Investors Service and lower than BBB- at  Standard & Poor’s .  To contact the reporter on this story:
