Banco  Caja de Ahorros del
Mediterraneo , a failed Spanish savings bank being taken over by
 Banco Sabadell SA (SAB) , won European Union approval to receive
restructuring aid.  The European Commission today approved a capital injection
of 2.4 billion euros ($3 billion) from  Spain ’s bank-bailout
facility and a 10-year government guarantee to cover the bank’s
losses. The Brussels-based regulator said the guarantee was a
state subsidy for the lender worth as much as 8.2 billion euros.  Sabadell agreed to buy Alicante-based CAM for one euro in
December. CAM was  seized  by the Bank of Spain in July after
souring property loans wrecked its business. Spain is trying to
bolster its banks and help cash-strapped regions at a time of
surging borrowing costs.  “The disappearance of Banco CAM from the market as an
independent entity, the sale of its banking business to Banco
Sabadell and the deep restructuring foreseen should ensure long-
term viability without continued state support” the commission
said in an e-mailed statement.  CAM will cancel a 3 billion-euro liquidity line that it
received from the bailout facility before its sale to Sabadell
becomes effective, the EU said. CAM also obtained EU permission
to get as much as 700 million euros if it can’t benefit from
deferred tax assets after the takeover.  Sabadell and CAM didn’t immediately respond to e-mails
seeking comment on the EU decision. EU regulators must approve
large state subsidies for banks and can impose conditions on the
aid.  To contact the reporter on this story:
