Non-financial companies and
households withdrew 31.5 billion euros ($39 billion) from
Spanish banks in April, as the government tried to restore
confidence in the country’s banking system.  Private-sector deposits fell by 1.9 percent to 1.63
trillion euros in April, reversing a rise of 3.1 billion euros
in the previous month, according to European Central Bank data
released today. Deposits by companies and households in Spanish
banks were down 103.8 billion euros from a year earlier.  Spain , the euro area’s fourth-largest economy, is trying to
clean up its banks, plug holes in regional budgets and lift the
economy out of a recession. While Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy 
ruled out a European rescue of Spain’s banks on May 28, the
European Commission called today for direct euro-area aid for
troubled lenders, a Europe-wide deposit-guarantee system and
common bond issuance.  ECB data also showed that there was no sign of deposit
flight in  Greece . Private-sector deposits in Greek banks rose by
400 million euros to 171.5 billion euros in April.  To contact the reporter on this story:
