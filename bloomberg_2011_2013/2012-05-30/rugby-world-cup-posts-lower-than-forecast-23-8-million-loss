Organizers of last year’s  Rugby World
Cup  in New Zealand said they made a lower-than-forecast loss of
NZ$31.3 million ($23.8 million) from staging the 20-team event.  The loss from hosting the seventh edition of rugby’s four-
yearly championship was NZ$8 million less then previously
forecast, Rugby New Zealand 2011 Ltd., the joint venture between
the New Zealand Government and its national rugby union, said
today in an e-mailed statement.  “Very few global sporting events ever come in on budget,”
RNZ 2011 Chairman Brian Roche said. “RWC 2011 was an extremely
challenging event to deliver, of a scale and complexity never
staged in this country so to deliver a significantly better than
expected result is an extraordinary achievement.”  The six-week tournament, which culminated in a victory for
the All Blacks, attracted about 133,000 visitors from more than
100 countries to  New Zealand  and a cumulative global television
audience of 3.9 billion, RNZ 2011 said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
