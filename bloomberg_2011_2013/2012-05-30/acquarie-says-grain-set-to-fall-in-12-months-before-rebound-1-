Macquarie Group Ltd. said it’s
bearish on grains and oilseeds for the next 12 months as farmers
globally boost output, while prices are likely to rally in
coming years.  World corn production may climb to a record 925.95 million
metric tons in the 2012-13 marketing year, as yields and acres
rise, analyst Chris Gadd said today in an e-mailed report.
That’s below the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s projection of
945.78 million tons. Macquarie, which also expects lower world
corn consumption than the USDA, forecast inventories of 152.34
million tons by the end of the crop year, in line with U.S.
government estimates.  Corn prices may be $5.87 a bushel in 2012 and $4.65 in
2013, before rebounding to $6.72 by 2017, Gadd wrote. The grain
for July delivery traded at $5.6475 a bushel on the  Chicago 
Board of Trade, by 12:39 p.m. London time.  “Bearishness in the 12/13 season comes purely because we
expect the increase in supply to substantially outweigh stronger
demand,” London-based Gadd said. “In the following seasons,
price rallies will be likely, and necessary, as we see prices
falling below the marginal cost of production for the core
agricultural commodities.”  Population growth  and rising meat consumption in  emerging
markets  will support grain demand long term, Gadd wrote.
Infrastructure issues in  Brazil  and production inefficiencies in
former Soviet Union countries may limit the world’s ability to
expand fast enough to meet demand, according to the report.  Wheat prices may average $6.16 a bushel in 2012 and $5.56
in 2013, Gadd wrote. Soybeans may be $13.68 a bushel this year
and $12 next year, before rebounding to $13.44 in 2017, he said.
July-delivery wheat traded at $6.5175 a bushel in Chicago today,
while soybeans for the same delivery month were at $13.75.  To contact the reporter on this story:
