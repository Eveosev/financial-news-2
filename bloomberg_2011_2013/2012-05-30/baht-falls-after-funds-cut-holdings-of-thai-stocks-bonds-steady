Thailand’s baht fell to a four-month
low after international investors cut holdings of the nation’s
equities on concern  Europe ’s debt crisis will hurt global growth.
 Government bonds  were steady.  Global funds sold $32 million more Thai shares than they
bought in the first two days of this week, taking net sales this
month to $505 million, exchange data show. The baht has declined
3.4 percent in May, headed for its biggest drop since September,
as  Spain ’s 10-year bond yields approached the 7 percent
threshold that heralded bailouts in  Greece , Ireland and Portugal.  “Investors are worried about Spain now, which is reducing
risk appetite and weighing on regional currencies,” said
Amonthep Chawla, a Bangkok-based analyst at Kasikornbank Pcl.  The baht slid 0.4 percent to 31.84 per dollar as of 3:18
p.m. in Bangkok and touched 31.89 earlier, the weakest level
since Jan. 17, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. One-
month implied volatility, a measure of exchange-rate swings used
to price options, was little changed at 4.52 percent.  Thailand’s current-account deficit widened to $1.98 billion
in April from $1.52 billion in March, according to the median
estimate of economists in a Bloomberg News survey before a
central bank report tomorrow.  The yield on the government’s 3.25 percent bonds due June
2017 was little changed at 3.62 percent, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
