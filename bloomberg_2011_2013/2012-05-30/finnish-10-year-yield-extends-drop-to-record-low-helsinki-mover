Finnish  government bond yields  fell
to a record low, underscoring the divergence within the euro
area as investors speculate on the unity of the bloc.  The yield on the 10-year securities slid to 1.57 percent,
the lowest since at least 1996. The yield has dropped nine basis
points this week and is poised for a sixth week of declines.
 Spain ’s similar-maturity yield was at 6.615 percent today and
 Italy ’s bond yielded 5.926 percent.  Finland’s 10-year benchmark spread to similar-maturity
German notes narrowed to 29 basis points, the lowest among the
17 euro members. It costs less to insure against a Finnish
default than it does for any other member in the single currency
bloc, including  Germany , credit derivatives show.  Finland’s top credit rating and stable outlook reflect the
resilience of the economy, Moody’s Investors Service said in a
statement today. Finland is the only Nordic country using the
euro and has earned its AAA rating through fiscal prudence.  It hasn’t breached the European Union’s budget deficit rule
since 1997 even as its economy suffered a drop of 8.4 percent in
2009, the biggest contraction since the 1918 civil war. Domestic
demand is underpinning growth, estimated at 0.8 percent this
year, the European Commission said today, reiterating a
forecast.  To contact the reporter on this story:
