Banco Santander Brasil SA (BSBR)  fell after
a newspaper report discouraged speculation that a significant
stake in the company may be sold.  Santander retreated 1.1 percent to 15.87 reais at the close
in Sao Paulo after earlier dropping as much as 3 percent. The
benchmark Bovespa index fell 1.5 percent.  Madrid-based  Banco Santander SA (SAN)  is seeking to sell a stake
of 1 percent to about 2 percent in its Brazilian unit to meet
local free float requirements,  Valor Economico  reported, citing
an interview with the subsidiary’s chief executive officer,
Marcial Portela.  The bank also said there are no negotiations under way to
sell Banco Santander Brasil SA or a relevant minority stake in
the unit, according to the Sao Paulo-based newspaper.  Banco Santander SA has agreed to sell its Colombian
business to Chile’s Corpbanca for $1.16 billion as part of a
plan to plug a capital shortfall in the wake of Spain’s property
crash. The transaction is expected to be completed next month,
according to  data  compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
