TiVo Inc. (TIVO)  fell the most since May 4
after reporting a first-quarter loss as hardware costs rose and
saying legal expenses in the current period would lead to a
wider loss than analysts expected.  TiVo dropped 4.7 percent to $8.54 at the close in New York.
Shares of the digital-video-recorder pioneer have declined 4.8
percent this year.  Litigation and marketing costs will rise in the quarter
ending July 31, Alviso, California-based TiVo said yesterday in
a statement. The company forecast a second-quarter net loss of
$28 million to $30 million almost double the average estimate
for a $15.8 million loss, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  The company has made progress expanding its DVR presence on
 Comcast Corp. (CMCSA)  cable-television systems, adding Boston after
success in San Francisco, analyst Rich Tullo with Albert Fried &
Co. wrote in a May 18 report. That has helped offset a delay
across  Charter Communications Inc. (CHTR)  circuits, he said.  The first-quarter loss was $20.8 million, or 17 cents a
share, wider than the 15-cent average loss estimated by 11
analysts. A year earlier, profit of $139 million was lifted by
litigation proceeds. Sales rose 48 percent to $67.8 million,
beating the $64.5 million average estimate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
