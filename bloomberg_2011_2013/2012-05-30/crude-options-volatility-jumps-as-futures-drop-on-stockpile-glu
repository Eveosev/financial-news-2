Crude-oil options volatility jumped
as the underlying futures tumbled to a seven-month low on
speculation U.S. crude stockpiles climbed to the highest level
since 1990.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
July, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge
of options prices, was 30.34 percent at 4:55 p.m. on the  New
York Mercantile Exchange , up from 27.13 percent yesterday.  Crude oil for July delivery slipped $2.94, or 3.2 percent,
to $87.82 a barrel on the Nymex, the lowest settlement since
Oct. 21. Prices are down 16 percent this month, heading for the
biggest drop since December 2008.  Futures fell as an Energy Department report tomorrow is
projected to show U.S. supplies rose 1 million barrels to 383.5
million last week, according to analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.
Crude inventories climbed in the previous nine reports from the
Energy Department.  The most active oil options in electronic trading today

second-most active options, with 3,656 lots changing hands as
they rose 83 cents to $1.35.  Puts accounted for 54 percent of electronic trading volume.
One contract covers 1,000 barrels of crude.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on floor
