Greenlight Capital Inc., the $7.8
billion hedge fund run by  David Einhorn , opened to investors
last quarter for the first time since 2008 after posting a 6.8
percent gain, according to a letter to investors.  Greenlight increased assets by 6 percent last quarter and a
“high percentage” of the capital raised was invested in the
dollar-denominated class of the Greenlight Capital Gold funds,
the firm said in the May 29 letter, which was obtained by
Bloomberg News.  Einhorn’s New York-based hedge fund advanced in the first
three months of the year as stocks climbed and the firm profited
from its long positions, or bets that equities would rise,
including wagers on  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  and  Seagate Technology Plc (STX) , the
firm said. Hedge funds on average rose 1.9 percent during the
first quarter, according to Bloomberg data.  Among Greenlight’s short positions, or bets that securities
will fall, the hedge fund gained on a falling Japanese yen, the
firm said. It also took “a brief and successful short
position” in Diamond Foods Inc., the letter said.  Einhorn, whose fund can bet on rising and falling prices,
is best known for shorting Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. before
it collapsed in September 2008.  Jonathan Gasthalter, a spokesman for Greenlight, declined
to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
