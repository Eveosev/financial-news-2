An Egyptian criminal court sentenced
a policeman to five years in prison for participating in the
killing of protesters during last year’s uprising against  Hosni Mubarak , the state-run Middle East News Agency said.  The verdict against Mohamed el-Sunni replaces an earlier
death sentence for the same offense, when the defendant was
tried in absentia, MENA said. He then turned himself in for a
retrial.  Earlier this month, a court sentenced five policemen to 10
years in prison for the killing of protesters during the
uprising, which left at least 846 people dead. That ruling
followed a series of acquittals of police officers accused of
involvement in the deaths.  A ruling in the case of Mubarak, charged with complicity in
the killings, is due on June 2.  To contact the reporter on this story:
