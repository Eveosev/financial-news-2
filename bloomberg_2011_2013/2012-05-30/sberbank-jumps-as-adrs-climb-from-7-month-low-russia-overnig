OAO Sberbank (SBRCY)  and  OAO Lukoil (LUKOY) ’s
American depositary receipts led a rebound in Russian shares
traded in  New York  on prospects the companies, two of the
nation’s largest, are planning to expand their investor base.  State-run Sberbank, Russia’s biggest lender, rose 4.5
percent after a person with knowledge of the matter said the
government plans to sell a 7.6 percent stake. Lukoil, its
largest non-state oil producer, advanced the most in three
months as the company said it plans to list $1 billion of
existing shares in  Hong Kong  within a year. The  Bloomberg
Russia-US Equity Index (RUS14BN)  surged from the lowest level since Oct.
5, while  futures  on Russia’s dollar-denominated  RTS Index (RTSI$)  fell
0.2 percent.  U.S.-traded shares advanced after the ruble-denominated
 Micex (INDEXCF)  Index posted its biggest gain since Feb. 24 in Moscow as a
person with knowledge of the matter said Prime Minister  Dmitry Medvedev  is speeding up the government’s state asset sale
program. The government owns 57.6 percent of Moscow-based
Sberbank through the central bank, or Bank Rossii, and has
postponed selling part of that stake several times since the
original September 2011 target date, citing market turmoil.  “These moves signal an increased willingness on the part
of Russia’s government shareholders to heighten corporate
transparency and broaden shareholder bases,”  Alec Young , a
global equity strategist at S&P Capital IQ in New York, said by
phone yesterday. “Those are two trends that Western investors
would like to see more of.”  The  Market Vectors Russia ETF (RSX) , a U.S.-traded fund that
holds Russian shares, advanced for the first time in five days,
with a 3.3 percent jump to $24.90. The RTS Volatility Index,
which measures expected swings in the index futures, rose 1.9
percent to 42.55 points.  Relief on Greece  The  Standard & Poor’s 500 (SPX)  Index advanced to a two-week high
after data signaled stabilization in the U.S. housing market and
as Greek opinion polls eased concern the country will leave the
euro. The index added 1.1 percent to 1,332.42 while the  Dow
Jones Industrial Average (INDU)  gained 1 percent to 12,580.69.  “The latest poll data out of Greece is giving investors
reassurance that the Greek people will vote for their self-
interest and remain in the euro, which is boosting shares
globally,” Young said.  United Co. Rusal (486) , the world’s largest aluminum producer,
dropped 2.3 percent to HK$4.62 in Hong Kong trading as of
10:22a.m. local time. The MSCI Asia Pacific Index fell 1.3
percent today as  China  damped speculation that it will introduce
large-scale stimulus to bolster its economy.  Sberbank ADRs climbed to $10.47 after shares in Moscow
gained 4.7 percent to 84.11 rubles, or the equivalent of $2.60.
One ADR equals four shares.  Lukoil Selloff  American depositary receipts of Moscow-based Lukoil surged
4.5 percent to $53.50, a two-week high, after  shares  on the
Micex Index rose 3.6 percent to 1,728.60 rubles, or $53.41.  Lukoil may buy back an additional $2 billion to $3 billion
of its own shares to support the stock, Deputy Chief Executive
Officer  Leonid Fedun  told reporters yesterday in Hong Kong after
a presentation to investors. The company may use part of the
shares for the listing and some for a management bonus program,
and may cancel some, he said.  Lukoil’s advance yesterday follows a 17 percent decline
this month through May 25 that paralleled the drop in crude,
said Ilya Kravets, a research analyst ED Capital in New York,
which manages almost $100 million in assets, said by phone.  “When crude goes down significantly, anything that has the
word oil in it gets hammered,” said Kravets, whose firm owns
shares in Lukoil.  VimpelCom Rebounds  Crude traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  fell 0.1
percent yesterday to $90.76 a barrel to extend its decline since
this month to 13 percent. Brent oil for July settlement dropped
0.4 percent to $106.68 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures
Europe exchange while Urals crude, Russia’s chief export blend,
lost 1 percent to $104.24.  VimpelCom Ltd. (VIP) , a mobile operator with more than 200
million subscribers worldwide, climbed the most on record after
posting on May 25 its largest decline since its public offering
in April 2010. Amsterdam-based VimpelCom, the world’s sixth-
largest wireless operator, advanced 11 percent in New York to
$8.11.  Investors “overreacted” to a May 25 ruling by a Moscow
court that said VimpelCom was banned from paying dividends for
its 2011 earnings, said Tibor Bokor, an analyst at ING Bank NV
in  London .  “We had no trading on Monday so people calmed down and
realized that the dividend will eventually be paid, and that
there are ways to get the issue resolved as more cash is being
generated,” Bokor, who has a buy rating on the shares, said in
a phone interview.  MTS Jumps  OAO Mobile TeleSystems (MBT) , Russia’s largest mobile-phone
operator, jumped the most in six months after Troika Dialog said
in an e-mailed note to investors that  MSCI Inc. (MSCI)  will boost the
stock’s weighting in its Russia 10/40 index.  MTS, as the company is known, surged 6.2 percent, the most
since Nov. 22, to $17.59 after  shares  in Moscow gained 2.5
percent to 234.50 rubles, or $7.27.  The Bloomberg Russia-US Index climbed 3.7 percent to 84.90.
The RTS Index in Moscow rose 1.7 percent to 1,299.20 while the
30-stock Micex Index gained the most since February, surging 2.8
percent to 1,327.08. RTS Index futures expiring in June fell to
130,115.  The Micex has declined 5.4 percent in 2012 and trades at
4.6 times analysts’ earnings estimates for member companies.
That compares with a 3.7 percent retreat for Brazil’s  Bovespa (IBOV) 
index, which trades at 9.2 times estimated earnings, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP) 
trades at 10.3 times estimated earnings, and the  BSE India
Sensitive Index (SENSEX)  has a ratio of 12.8.  To contact the reporters on this story:
