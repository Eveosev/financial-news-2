Gulf Coast gasoline strengthened as
 Phillips 66 (PSX)  expects to conduct maintenance on its Borger
refinery in Texas.  The plant plans to flare gases starting today on equipment
associated with a fluid catalytic cracker, according to a filing
with state regulators. The work may last through June 11, the
filing showed.  The premium for reformulated, 87-octane gasoline, or RBOB,
in the Gulf Coast versus futures traded on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange  rose 0.37 cent to 3.5 cents a gallon at 4:18
p.m., according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Prompt delivery
fell 5.59 cents to $2.8089 a gallon.  Gasoline inventories in the U.S. probably declined 1
million barrels last week, the median of 11 analyst estimates
compiled by Bloomberg News. Stockpiles of heating oil and diesel
were unchanged, according to the survey.  The Energy Department is scheduled to report last weekâ€™s
inventories at 11 a.m. tomorrow in  Washington , one day later
than usual because of the May 28 U.S. Memorial Day holiday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
