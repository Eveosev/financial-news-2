Islandsbanki hf , the state-created
successor to failed Icelandic lender Glitnir Bank hf, said
first-quarter profit rose 56 percent as interest income jumped.  Net income rose to 5.61 billion kronur ($42.8 million) from
3.59 billion kronur a year earlier, the Reykjavik-based bank
said in a statement posted on its  website . Net interest income
rose 7.8 percent to 8.69 billion kronur.  Glitnir collapsed in October 2008 after it was unable to
secure short-term funding. The Icelandic government established
Islandsbanki and siphoned Glitnir’s domestic assets into the new
unit. A year later, 95 percent of Islandsbanki’s shares were
taken over by a resolution committee representing Glitnir’s
creditors. The Icelandic government holds 5 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
