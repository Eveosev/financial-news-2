The  Federal Reserve  adopted a final
rule stipulating the criteria under which a U.S. broker-dealer
may choose the Fed Board of Governors as its supervisor if
government oversight is required under laws outside the U.S.  The rule, required by section 618 of the Dodd-Frank Act,
says a U.S. securities holding company that is required by a
foreign regulator to be subject to comprehensive supervision may
register with the U.S. central bank.  The Fed lists nine types of information a securities
holding company must submit to receive consideration for
supervision, including an organizational chart, biographical
information on senior executives, and copies of the most recent
quarterly and annual reports, the Fed said in a press release.  To contact the reporters on this story:
