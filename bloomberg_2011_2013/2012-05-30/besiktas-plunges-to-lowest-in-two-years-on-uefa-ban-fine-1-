Besiktas Futbol Yatirimlari Sanayi &
Ticaret AS (BJKAS) , the merchandising unit of Turkish sports club
Besiktas, plunged to the lowest in almost two years after saying
its soccer team was banned from European competitions for a
year.  Besiktas fell 8.8 percent to 4.33 liras at the close in
Istanbul, the lowest level since July 2010.  The Union of European Football Associations, or UEFA,
imposed a one-year ban and a 200,000 euro ($248,000) fine on
Besiktas for erroneous financial statements, the club said in a
statement to the  Istanbul Stock Exchange  today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
