Centrais Eletricas Brasileiras SA (ELET6) ,
South America’s largest power generator, rose the most in a
month after reporting a first-quarter profit that exceeded
analysts’ estimates.  Shares of Eletrobras, as the company is known, gained 2.5
percent to 17.90 reais at the close in Sao Paulo. The benchmark
Bovespa index slid 1.5 percent.  Net income dropped to 1.27 billion reais ($632 million)
from 1.28 billion reais a year earlier, the Rio de Janeiro-based
utility said yesterday in a regulatory filing after the markets
closed. The result was above the 856 million reais adjusted
earnings estimated by analysts in a  Bloomberg survey .  The stronger real boosted the value of dollar-denominated
receivables from Itaipu, the world’s second-largest
hydroelectric station.  Brazil ’s real gained 2.2 percent in the
first quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
