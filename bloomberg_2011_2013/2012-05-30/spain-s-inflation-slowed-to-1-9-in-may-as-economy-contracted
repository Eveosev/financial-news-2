Spanish inflation slowed in May as
the euro area’s fourth-largest economy suffered its second
recession since 2009.  Consumer prices , based on European Union calculations, rose
1.9 percent from a year earlier, compared with a 2 percent gain
in April, the  National Statistics Institute  in Madrid said
today. Economists had forecast a 2 percent increase in May,
according to the median of seven predictions in a Bloomberg News
survey.  Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy , in power since December, is
cutting spending and raising taxes as he seeks to shave the
 budget deficit  by 3.6 percent of gross domestic product.  Spain ’s
unemployment is the highest in the 17-nation euro area at more
than 24 percent and the Bank of Spain said yesterday that the
economy continued to shrink in the second quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
