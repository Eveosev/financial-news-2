General Motors Co. (GM)  Vice Chairman
Steve Girsky today met the prime ministers of the four German
states in which Opel operates factories, WAZ newspaper group
reported, without saying where it got the information.  The meeting with leaders of North Rhine-Westphalia, Hesse,
Rhineland Palatinate and Thuringia is the first since
speculation about potential plant closures erupted, WAZ said in
a pre-release of an article to be published tomorrow. The
states’ economy ministers met with Opel’s works council head
Wolfgang Schaefer-Klug today, WAZ said, adding that it hasn’t
received any information about the content of the talks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
