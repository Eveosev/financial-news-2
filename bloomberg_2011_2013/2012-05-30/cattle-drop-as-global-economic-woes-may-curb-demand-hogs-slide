Cattle futures fell to the lowest in
two weeks on speculation that a sluggish global economy will
curb demand for commodities. Hog prices dropped for the first
time in a week.  The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot Index of 24  raw materials 
tumbled to the lowest since October on signs that the  European
debt crisis  is escalating.  China , the biggest consumer of
everything from pork to soybeans, has no plans to introduce
stimulus measures to support growth on the scale similar to
2008, the state-run Xinhua News Agency said yesterday.  “A weak tone with these outside markets” drove cattle
lower,  Don Roose , the president of U.S. Commodities Inc. in  West
Des Moines , Iowa, said in a telephone interview. “That’s a
limiting factor here.”  Cattle futures for August delivery fell 0.9 percent to
$1.18575 a pound at 10:26 a.m. on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange. Earlier, the price touched $1.177, the lowest for a
most-active contract since May 14. Before today, the commodity
rose 4.8 percent this month.  Feeder-cattle futures for August settlement dropped 0.9
percent to $1.562 a pound.  China’s economy  is forecast to expand 8.2 percent this
year, based on the median estimate of analysts surveyed this
month by Bloomberg News. That would be the slowest since 1999.  Hog futures for July settlement declined 0.7 percent to
87.05 cents a pound in Chicago, heading for the first drop since
May 23. Before today, the commodity climbed 2 percent this
month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
