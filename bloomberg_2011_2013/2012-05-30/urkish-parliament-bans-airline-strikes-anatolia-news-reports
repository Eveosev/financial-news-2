Turkey ’s parliament approved a
measure banning airline workers from going on strike, Anatolia
news agency reported.  The measure was passed as part of a package of laws being
debated today at the National Assembly in Ankara, the state-run
news service said.  Employees at  Turk Hava Yollari (THYAO)  AO, or Turkish Airlines,
initiated a go-slow action yesterday to protest the measure,
causing the cancellation of more than 100 flights,
Transportation Minister Binali Yildirim said yesterday. Another
68 flights were canceled today, Anatolia reported.  The airline workers’ union Hava-Is is continuing talks on
pay for 2011 and 2012 and the union was considering broader
industrial action, the union said in a statement on its website
yesterday.  Turkish Airlines  shares fell 1.6 percent to 2.52 liras at
the close in Istanbul.  To contact the reporter on this story:
