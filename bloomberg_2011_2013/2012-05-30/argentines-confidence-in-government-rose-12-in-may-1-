Argentines’ confidence in their
government rose 12 percent in May from April, when President
 Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner  seized the nation’s largest
energy company, YPF SA.  The index pared its 16 percent drop the month before, a
survey commissioned by Torcuato Di Tella University in Buenos
Aires showed. From the year-earlier, the index fell 8 percent,
according to the poll that was released by e-mail today.  The index rose to 2.14 on a scale of zero to five, the
survey of 1,200 people showed. About 54 percent of those
surveyed said that Fernandez’s government is able to “resolve
the country’s problems,” four basis points more than a month
earlier. About 40 percent said they have a good opinion of the
government, nine percentage points more than in the previous
poll.  Fernandez announced the seizure of YPF on April 16, ousting
Spanish owners Repsol YPF SA after a dispute over slumping oil
output and investments.  The survey, conducted by  Poliarquia Consultores  on behalf
of the Buenos Aires-based University from May 2 to May 15, had a
margin of error of 3.2 percentage points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
