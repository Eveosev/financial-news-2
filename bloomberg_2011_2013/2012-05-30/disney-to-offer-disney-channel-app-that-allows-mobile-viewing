Walt Disney Co. (DIS) ’s Disney Channel is
releasing an application that will enable the children’s network
to be watched on Internet-connected mobile devices.  The app may become available next week, Disney Chief
Executive Officer  Robert Iger  said today at a Sanford C.
Bernstein investor conference in New York.  Comcast Corp. (CMCSA)  has
agreed to pay for the service, he said.  Disney is adding outlets for its films and television shows
to boost revenue, Iger said. Disney Channel is drawing some of
its highest ratings ever after making some shows available
online, including on Netflix Inc.’s streaming service, he said.  “Anytime there’s a new platform or window, the goal is to
increase incremental revenue,” Iger said.  Disney, based in Burbank, California, fell 0.6 percent to
$45.22 at 11:12 a.m. in New York. The shares had climbed 21
percent this year before today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
