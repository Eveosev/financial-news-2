Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  will buy  Hess
Corp.’s (HES)  15.67 percent stake in the Schiehallion oil field and
associated equipment, making it the largest holder of the
project off the Scottish coast.  The deal is expected to close this year after it gets
regulatory approval, New York-based Hess said in a statement
today. Terms of the sale, which includes a stake in a floating
production, storage and offloading vessel and the West of
Shetland pipeline system, weren’t disclosed.  “Selling these non-operated, non-core assets will help us
sustain the profitable growth of our production and reserves,”
Greg Hill, president of Hess worldwide exploration and
production, said in the statement.  After the sale, The Hague-based Shell will own 49.1 percent
of the project 175 kilometers (109 miles) west of the Scottish
coast, according to Jon Pepper, a spokesman for Hess.  BP Plc (BP/) 
owns 36.3 percent of Schiehallion and operates it.  Statoil ASA (STL) ,
 OMV AG (OMV)  and  Murphy Oil Corp. (MUR)  are also partners in the project.  Hess  fell  4.3 percent to $45.38 at the close in New York.
The shares have declined 20 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
