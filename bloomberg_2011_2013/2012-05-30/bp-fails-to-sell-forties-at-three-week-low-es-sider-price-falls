BP Plc failed to sell North Sea
Forties crude even after reducing its offer to the lowest in
three weeks. Gunvor Group Ltd. bought Russian Urals Blend at a
higher price than the last trade.  Libya ’s state-run National Oil Corp. cut the official
selling price of its benchmark Es Sider crude for July loading
by 55 cents to a premium of 30 cents a barrel to Dated Brent,
the least in seven months, according to a price list obtained by
Bloomberg News.  OAO Rosneft,  Russia ’s largest oil producer, sold seven
cargoes of Urals via a tender to Vitol Group and Gunvor for June
13 to June 22 loading from the Baltic Sea port of Primorsk, said
four traders who participate in the market.  North Sea  BP failed to sell the Forties cargo for shipment on June 13
to June 15 at 15 cents a barrel less than Dated Brent, the
lowest since May 9, according to a Bloomberg survey of traders
and brokers monitoring the Platts trading window. This compares
with its offer at a 10-cent premium yesterday.  Royal Dutch Shell Plc didn’t manage to sell the grade for
June 11 to June 13 at 10 cents more than Dated Brent, while

cents a barrel more than Dated Brent for June 23 to June 26,
according to the survey.  Reported  North Sea  crude trading typically occurs during
the Platts window, which ends at 4:30 p.m. London time. Before
the session, Forties loading in 10 to 25 days was 6 cents a
barrel more than Dated Brent, compared with a premium of 10
cents yesterday, data compiled by Bloomberg showed.  Brent for July settlement traded at $103.42 a barrel on the
ICE Futures Europe exchange in London at the close of the
window, down from $107.23 yesterday. The August contract was at
$103.03, a discount of 39 cents to July.  Mediterranean/Urals  Gunvor bought 100,000 metric tons of Urals for delivery on
June 9 to June 13 to Rotterdam from Shell at $1.95 a barrel less
than Dated Brent, compared with a discount of $2.40 for the last
trade on May 24, the survey showed.  No bids or offers were made for the grade in the
Mediterranean. The  blend  was at $1.52 a barrel less than Dated
Brent in the region, down 2 cents from yesterday, the Bloomberg
data showed.  Trafigura failed to sell 85,000 tons of CPC blend for
loading on June 11 to June 15 for the third day at $2.75 a
