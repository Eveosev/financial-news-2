New Jersey  stands to see as much as
$40 million a year in  sales-tax  revenue from  Amazon (AMZN) .com Inc.,
the biggest online retailer, Governor  Chris Christie  said.  A deal the Republican governor disclosed today will bring
to New Jersey $130 million in investments and 1,500 full-time
jobs. Amazon will start collecting the 7 percent tax July 1,
2013, Christie said at a Trenton news briefing. Work on two new
warehouses in the state may begin next year, he said.  “Today’s announcement marks a first step toward a long-
term relationship with Amazon,” Christie, 49, told reporters.
“With this agreement, Amazon is stepping up and making a real
commitment to our state and to our people.”  The accord is the latest example of Amazon reaching sales
tax deals with states: This month a similar arrangement was
announced with Nevada and last month the company agreed to begin
collecting sales tax in Texas. Agreements with the states may
presage federal legislation that would simplify the taxation of
online sales, said Christie and  Paul Misener , vice president of
global public policy for the Seattle-based company.  In New Jersey, the two “fulfillment centers” each will be
more than 1 million square feet (92,900 square meters), big
enough to fit three aircraft carriers, and will require workers
with basic computer skills, Misener said. He said Amazon has a
“history of growing in states that welcome us.”  The Arlington, Virginia-based Retail Industry Leaders
Association said in a statement that the tax deal will be fairer
for traditional stores.  To contact the reporter on this story:
