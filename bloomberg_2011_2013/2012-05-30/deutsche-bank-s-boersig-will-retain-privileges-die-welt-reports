Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  supervisory board
chairman  Clemens Boersig  will retain privileges after stepping
down at the end of the month, Die Welt reported, citing
unidentified people close to the German bank.  Boersig will have an office in one of the company’s towers
in Frankfurt and help his designated successor, Paul Achleitner,
become acquainted with the post, the Berlin-based newspaper
said. Boersig will be entitled to a driver and a secretary,
according to the report.  Boersig will probably also lead the Deutsche Bank
Foundation, which sponsors education, culture and other causes,
pending approval of the move by the company’s management board,
Welt reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
