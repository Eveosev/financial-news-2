OAO Gazprom Neft, the oil arm of
 Russia ’s natural-gas producer and exporter, opened a catalytic
cracking and hydrotreating unit today with capacity of 1.2
million metric tons a year at its Omsk refinery.  Gazprom Neft plans for all the gasoline produced at Omsk to
meet Euro-5 quality standards from 2013, the St. Petersburg-
based company said in a statement distributed at the opening
ceremony. Euro-5 grade motor fuel contains no more than 10 parts
per million of sulfur.  Omsk, Russia’s biggest refinery, has capacity to process 20
million tons of crude a year, or 402,000 barrels a day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
