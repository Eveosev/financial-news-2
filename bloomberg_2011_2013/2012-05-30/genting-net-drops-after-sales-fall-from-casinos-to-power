Genting Bhd. (GENT) , which controls Asia’s
second-biggest casino operator by market value, said first-
quarter profit fell 16 percent after takings from premium
customers dropped at its Singapore gaming resort.  Brokerages including  OSK Holdings Bhd. (OSK) ,  Hong Leong
Financial Group Bhd. (HLFG)  and  K&N Kenanga Holdings Bhd. (KNK)  reduced their
price estimates for Genting to reflect lower earnings forecasts,
according to separate reports today.  “We have toned down our earnings forecast,” Keith Wee, an
analyst at OSK, wrote in a report today. “The group reported
earnings which were below consensus.”  Net income  for the three months ended March 31 declined to
693.6 million ringgit ($219 million), or 18.8 sen a share, from
824.2 million ringgit, or 22.3 sen, a year earlier, Genting said
in an exchange filing yesterday. Revenue fell 9.6 percent to 4.4
billion ringgit.  The Kuala Lumpur-based company is the parent of Asia’s
second-biggest casino operator  Genting Singapore Plc (GENS) , which
earlier this month reported a 33 percent decline in first-
quarter profit to S$205.5 million ($160 million). Profit from
the group’s plantations division dropped on lower palm oil
prices, while earnings from power generation fell on lower plant
output in China.  “Lower revenue was recorded from all the business segments
except for the property division,” Genting, owner of Malaysia’s
only gaming resort, said in the statement.  The group’s  plantation  division’s profit dropped 28 percent
to 98.5 million ringgit. Earnings from power declined 40 percent
to 125 million ringgit, the company said.  OSK’s Wee cut his so-called  fair value  to 11.62 ringgit
from 12.30 ringgit, while keeping a buy call. Hong Leong
Investment reduced its price estimate to 11.14 ringgit from
11.50 ringgit, while K&N Kenanga trimmed its to 11.69 ringgit
from 12.57 ringgit.  Genting was unchanged at 9.99 ringgit at the 12:30 p.m.
local-time trading break in Kuala Lumpur, while the benchmark
 FTSE Bursa Malaysia KLCI Index (FBMKLCI)  fell 0.1 percent.  Genting Malaysia Bhd. (GENM) , a gaming unit, slid 3.7 percent to
3.70 ringgit, poised for its largest loss since Feb. 8, after
its first-quarter profit slipped 35 percent from a year earlier
to 270.7 million ringgit.  Genting Malaysia on Oct. 28 opened a casino at the Aqueduct
Racetrack in New York. The unit plans to build the biggest
convention center in the U.S., and has also pitched proposals
for a $3.8 billion casino-and-hotel project in Miami. It’s
already the U.K.’s biggest casino operator and owns Resorts
World Sentosa, one of Singapore’s two gaming resorts.  To contact the reporters on this story:
