Bancaja, one of the seven Spanish
lenders that formed  BFA-Bankia (BKIA) , said it will revise the pension
rights of Finance Director Aurelio Izquierdo after the merged
lender was nationalized this month.  Bancaja, based in Valencia, didn’t give details of the
pension agreement in an e-mailed statement on the board’s
decision today. The  annual report  of the bank’s parent company
published this week showed Bancaja had 13.9 million euros ($17.2
million) in commitments for the pension of a former member of
senior management and an associated insurance policy to cover
early retirement.  Economy Minister Luis de Guindos told reporters in
Parliament today the pension was “unacceptable.” Bankia group
was nationalized on May 9, and the new management of  Spain ’s
third-largest lender has asked for 19 billion euros of public
money to clean up its balance sheet.  To contact the reporter on this story:
