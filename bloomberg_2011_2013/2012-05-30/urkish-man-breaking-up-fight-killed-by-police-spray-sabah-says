A Turkish man was killed by police
pepper spray as he sought to break up a fight between two groups,
Sabah  reported .  Cayan Birben told policemen that he has asthma and warned
them against using pepper spray to halt the clash, according to
the Istanbul-based newspaper, which cited witnesses to the
incident. The 31-year-old man rushed to a nearby cafe to wash
his face after police pepper-sprayed the crowd, and then was
taken by ambulance to a hospital in Yalova, Sabah reported.
Birben died in intensive care, the newspaper said.  Turkish police frequently resort to pepper spray to
disperse demonstrators and suppress unrest. Last year, a retired
teacher protesting against Prime Minister  Recep Tayyip Erdogan 
before an election rally had a heart attack after police pepper-
sprayed demonstrators.  To contact the reporter on this story:
