(Corrects spelling of company name in headline.)  Siemens AG (SIE)  has appealed a decision by
the northern French town of Lille to award an automated metro
contract to rival  Alstom SA (ALO) , Christophe de Maistre, head of
Siemens France, said in an interview with Le Figaro.  The bid from the German engineering group was cheaper and
more technologically advanced than that of its French rival, de
Maistre said in the interview with the French newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
