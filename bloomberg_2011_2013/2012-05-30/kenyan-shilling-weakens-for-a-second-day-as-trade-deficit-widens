Kenya ’s shilling fell for a second
day, retreating to its lowest in more than four months, as the
nation’s trade deficit widened due to higher imports.  The currency of  East Africa ’s biggest economy depreciated
as much as 0.8 percent and traded down 0.5 percent to 86.35 by
2:24 p.m. in Nairobi, the weakest since Jan. 16 on a closing
basis, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Kenya’s trade deficit increased in March as fuel imports
rose to the highest in seven months, the  Kenya National Bureau
of Statistics  said today on its website. The gap increased 22
percent from a year earlier to 80.3 billion shillings ($930
million).  “The shilling is under pressure from the widening of the
trade deficit through increased imports at a time earnings are
not strong enough to meet demand for dollars,” Duncan Kinuthia,
a dealer at Nairobi-based Commercial Bank of Africa Ltd., said
in a phone interview today. “On a daily basis we are seeing
panic buying as businesses accumulate dollars in anticipation of
further weakening,” he said.  Imports rose 14 percent to 124.6 billion shillings, with
fuel shipments accounting for about a third of the total.
Exports increased 1.1 percent to 44.4 billion shillings. The
three-month  trade gap  was 197.5 billion shillings, up 18 percent
from a year earlier.  Kenya, the world’s largest exporter of black tea, sold
31,280 metric tons of the leaves in March, down 13 percent from
a year earlier, earning 7.8 billion shillings. Coffee sales rose
21 percent to 5,069 metric tons.  Ugandan shilling was little changed at 2,479.5 per dollar
while Tanzania’s shilling appreciated 0.2 percent to 1,586.33
per dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
