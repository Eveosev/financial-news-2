The Finnish Justice Ministry’s
proposal to cap  interest rates  on loans requested via text
message will be sent to parliament in September.  The Helsinki-based ministry will review its proposal for
possible changes after it finished consultations with those
affected by the legislation, according to a statement today. The
legislature will receive the motion “as soon as possible”
after reconvening on Sept. 5, the ministry said.  The ministry on April 11 proposed to limit interest rates
on loans of less than 1,000 euros ($1,243) at 50 percent to curb
debt growth and an increase in unserviced loans.  The average SMS loan is for 243 euros and its current
annual percentage rate is almost 900 percent, the ministry said.
The number of court verdicts related to small loans rose to
82,000 last year from about 3,000 in 2005, the ministry said
last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
