Russian lawmakers introduced a bill
to add television, radio channels and websites to the list of
state strategic assets, according to a  statement  on parliament’s
website.  The lawmakers proposed adding all broadcast media channels
and internet websites with more than 20 million users to the
list of strategic state assets that may prevent them from
selling their shares.  Yandex NV (YNDX) , the owner of Russia’s most-used
search engine, and Mail.ru, the largest Russian-language
 Internet company , both have more than 20 million users,
according to data from media researcher TNS Global.  Russia added OAO RusHydro, OAO Rosneft, Federal Grid Co.
and OAO MRSK Holding to its list of strategic assets, a move
that may preclude the government from privatizing them, Interfax
reported, citing a decree by President  Vladimir Putin  signed May
21.  To contact the reporter on this story:
