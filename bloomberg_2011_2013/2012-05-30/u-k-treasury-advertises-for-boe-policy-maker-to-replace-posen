The U.K. Treasury  advertised  for
applicants for the  Bank of England ’s Monetary Policy Committee
to replace  Adam Posen , who will step down when his term ends in
August.  “This is a high profile and influential role,” the
Treasury in London said in a statement on its website today.
“Candidates must have the technical expertise and experience
necessary to make independent monetary policy decisions.”  The Bank of England said earlier this month that Posen, an
external member of the MPC, will leave to become president of
the Peter G. Peterson Institute for International Economics.  The closing date for  applications  is June 15, according to
the advertisement, which said the post pays 131,771 pounds
($205,200) plus healthcare benefits. The Treasury said external
MPC members are not required to hold U.K. nationality, but are
“expected to be resident in the U.K.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
