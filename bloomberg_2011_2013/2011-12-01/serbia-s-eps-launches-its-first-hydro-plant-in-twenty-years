Elektroprivreda Srbije,  Serbia ’s
state-owned power monopoly, started production at Prvonek, its
first new hydroplant in more than 20 years.  With 910 kilowatts of installed capacity, Prvonek cost 1.55
million euros ($2.1 million) to build with expected annual
output of 2.5 million kilowatt hours to 3 million kilowatt
hours, the Belgrade-based company, also known as EPS, said in an
e-mailed statement. France-based Andino Hydropower Engineering
and local  ATB Sever AD (ATBS) , part of  ATB Austria Antriebstechnik (ATB) 
supplied turbines and related equipment.  Financed solely by EPS, Prvonek on the Banjska River in
southern Serbia, is the first in a series of new hydroplants the
company is developing to increase production from renewable
sources. Hydro facilities account for a third of EPS’s total
installed capacity of 8.36 gigawatts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
