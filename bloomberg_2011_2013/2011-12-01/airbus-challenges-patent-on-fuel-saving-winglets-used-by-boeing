Airbus SAS , the largest aircraft
maker, sued a partner of  Boeing Co. (BA)  to avoid paying patent
royalties for wing tips that make airplanes more fuel-efficient.  The lawsuit filed today in Austin,  Texas , asks the federal
court to declare that the  Aviation Partners Inc.  patent is
invalid and that Airbus doesn’t infringe. Closely held Aviation
Partners, which has a joint venture with Boeing to make winglets
that reduce drag on an airplane, has “stated repeatedly” that
Airbus must pay royalties, according to the complaint.  Airbus is adding “Sharklets” to some of its newer planes
to reduce fuel burned by 3.5 percent. The Toulouse, France-based
company said yesterday that a new A320 narrowbody airplane model
with the Sharklet devices completed its first flight. Aviation
Partners owns a patent issued in 1994 for a “blended winglet,”
and Chicago-based Boeing formed a venture with the company in
1999 to expand use of the devices on Boeing jets.  “API’s threats are a significant hindrance to Airbus and,
without an early resolution, place Airbus at a competitive
disadvantage,” Airbus, a unit of  European Aeronautic Defence &
Space Co. (EAD) , said in the complaint.  A representative for Boeing, which wasn’t named in the
lawsuit, couldn’t immediately be reached to comment. An
unidentified person who answered the phone at the Seattle office
of Aviation Partners said the company had no comment.  The case is Airbus SAS v. Aviation Parnters Inc., 11cv1030,
U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas (Austin).  To contact the reporters on this story:
