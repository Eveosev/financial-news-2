Czech manufacturing declined for the
first time in two years in November as both domestic and export
orders weakened, an industry gauge showed.  The HSBC Czech Republic Manufacturing PMI was 48.6,
compared with 51.7 in October, the first reading below the 50
mark since October 2009, the bank said today in an e-mailed
report. A result greater than 50 signals expansion. New orders
received by manufacturers decreased for the first time since
July 2009.  “Data suggested that both domestic and export markets
weakened as new export contracts declined for the first time
since August 2009,” the bank said in the Purchasing Managers
Index report, compiled by Markit, a financial information
services company. “Mainly as a result of declining new orders,
Czech manufacturers cut production in November, the first month-
on-month decline registered in 28 months.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
