Daimler AG (DAI) ’s Mercedes-Benz topped
 Bayerische Motoren Werke AG ’s BMW by more than 5,000 vehicle
sales in the U.S. last month, coming within 1,600 of the lead in
deliveries of luxury automobiles.  Mercedes deliveries, helped by a refreshed C-Class car and
redesigned M-Class sport-utility vehicle, rose 47 percent to
26,796 in November, the Stuttgart, Germany-based automaker said
yesterday in a statement, topping BMW for a second straight
month. BMW’s U.S. sales rose 7 percent in November to 21,521,
the Munich-based automaker said.  With November’s results, BMW’s lead for the year narrowed
to 1,582 units over Mercedes. BMW sales have risen 12 percent to
221,073. Deliveries of Mercedes vehicles through November rose
12 percent to 219,491 in the U.S., the company said. The two are
vying to replace  Toyota Motor Corp. (TM) ’s  Lexus , which has been the
annual U.S. luxury sales leader for the past 11 years.  “It’s going to be a very close race,” said  Jesse Toprak ,
an industry analyst with TrueCar.com, a  Santa Monica ,
California-based website that tracks auto sales. “Based on the
current momentum, I think that Benz has a good chance of winning
the race this year.”  A March earthquake and tsunami in  Japan  restricted supplies
of Lexus cars and SUVs, and the brand’s year-to-date sales fell
14 percent to 173,197. Toyota City, Japan-based Lexus increased
U.S. deliveries in November by 6.7 percent to 19,458.  BMW Looked ‘Unreachable’  Mercedes surge “is somewhat surprising,” Toprak said. “I
thought BMW had a strong hold based upon earlier this year. They
seemed unreachable.”  The results exclude Daimler’s Sprinter vans and Smart cars
and BMW’s Mini brand, which aren’t  luxury vehicles .  Mercedes’s product lineup got a boost in September when it
began selling a new M-Class SUV and refreshed C-Class sedan. The
automaker also began offering a two-door version of the C-Class
to compete against BMW’s 3-Series lineup. C-Class sales in
November more than doubled to 8,358 from 3,930, the company
said. M-Class deliveries rose 38 percent to 4,796.  “By good fortune we have strong availability of brand-new
product at a time when the wind shifted slightly in the
marketplace,” Steve Cannon, Mercedes vice president of U.S.
marketing, said yesterday in an interview in  Detroit . November’s
13.6 million seasonally adjusted annualized selling rate was the
highest in more than two years.  Mercedes is pushing the C-Class with lease deals, Toprak
said.  “They’re creating a lot of volume play with the cheap
leases they are putting out there,” he said.  ‘Close’ Race  While December is traditionally Mercedes best-selling
month, Cannon wouldn’t say that Mercedes will beat BMW for the
year.  “December will look like November,” he said. “It’s going
to be close.  “We have no mandate from Stuttgart that says beat BMW,”
Cannon said. “If BMW wants to throw everything but the kitchen
sink to hold onto a sales crown, we’re not going to duke it out
with them,” he added.  General Motors Co. (GM) ’s Cadillac luxury brand sales fell 5.6
percent last month to 11,145, according to the Detroit-based
automaker.  U.S. deliveries of Audi, the premium brand of Wolfsburg,
Germany-based  Volkswagen AG , rose 3.6 percent to 9,700 vehicles
last month, the company said in a statement. With 104,906 sales
through November, the brand exceeded 100,000 U.S. deliveries for
the second-straight year.  Porsche AG, the Stuttgart-based automaker, sold 2,255
vehicles in the U.S., a 6.7 percent decrease, the company said
in an e-mailed statement.  Nissan Motor Co. ’s Infiniti sold 8,428 vehicles, 3 percent
more than a year earlier, the Yokohama, Japan-based company,
said in a statement.  Honda Motor Co. (7267) , based in  Tokyo , said in a statement that
sales for its Acura brand fell 7.5 percent to 9,909 last month.  Ford Motor Co. (F)  sold 6,305 Lincolns in November, an 18
percent decrease from a year earlier, according to a statement
from the Dearborn, Michigan-based automaker.  Land Rover deliveries rose 31 percent to 3,820, while
Jaguar sales dropped 18 percent to 915, said Autodata Corp., an
industry researcher. The brands are owned by Mumbai-based Tata
Motors Ltd.  To contact the reporter on this story:
