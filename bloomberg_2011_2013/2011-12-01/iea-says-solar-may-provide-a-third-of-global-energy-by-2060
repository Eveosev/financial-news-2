Solar technologies such as
photovoltaic panels, water heaters and power stations built with
mirrors could provide a third of the world’s energy by 2060 if
politicians commit to limiting  climate change , the  International
Energy Agency  said.  Energy from the sun could play a key role in de-carbonizing
the global economy alongside improvements in efficiency and
imposing costs on greenhouse-gas emitters, the agency said in a
report today.  “The strength of solar is the incredible variety and
flexibility of applications, from small scale to big scale,”
Paolo Frankl, the agency’s head of renewable energy, said in a
telephone interview yesterday.  Economic activity will shift toward the sunnier zones
around the equator by 2050, making solar energy a viable  power
source  for most of the global economy, the report said. Those
regions will be home to almost 80 percent of the human race by
the middle of the century, compared with about 70 percent today,
and their energy needs will be higher as living standards in
countries such as Brazil and  India  approach those of the U.S.
and  Europe .  To realize the potential of solar power, officials should
move away from a strategy of subsidizing individual technologies
such as solar panels or solar-thermal generators toward measures
such as a carbon price that encourages a broader view of the
energy transition, Frankl said.  Government policy needs to take an “integrated approach
combining solar with  energy efficiency  and having as its main
objective an increase in total system efficiency and the
reduction of total costs,” he added. “Every good renewable
 energy policy  starts with energy efficiency.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
