Comverge Inc. rose the most in three
years after Aspire Capital Fund LLC agreed to buy as much as $10
million in shares of the smart-meter provider over two years.  Comverge  climbed (COMV)  as much as 35 percent, the biggest gain
since Nov. 24, 2008, to $1.83 a share and was 18 percent higher
at 10:33 a.m. in New York trading. Before today, the shares had
declined 80 percent this year.  Comverge, which provides remote meter-reading and demand
response programs for utilities, plans to use proceeds from the
sale of the common stock to fund working capital needs, the
Norcross, Georgia-based company said today in a statement.  “This agreement provides us with flexibility to raise
capital in modest increments,” Chief Executive Officer R. Blake
Young said in the statement.  Comverge issued 144,927 shares to Aspire as a commitment
fee. Chicago-based Aspire agreed to purchase the shares at
market prices when needed by Comverge. Comverge’s market value
is about $41 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
