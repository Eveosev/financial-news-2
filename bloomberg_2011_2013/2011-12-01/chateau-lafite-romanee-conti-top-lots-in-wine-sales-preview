A collection of  Chateau Lafite
Rothschild  valued at 850,000 pounds ($1.3 million) and a
“super-lot” of  Romanee-Conti  estimated at as much as
$800,000 are among the December highlights as another record
year of international wine auctions draws to a close.  Global wine sales by the leading five international
auction houses -- Acker Merrall & Condit, Christie’s
International, Sotheby’s, Zachys and Hart Davis Hart Wine Co.
-- have reached at least $367 million so far this year,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg News. The figure is
about four percent ahead of the total for the whole of 2010.
Hong Kong events account for close to half the volume.  Demand for  France ’s most prestigious chateaux has cooled
in recent months. Distribution problems in  China , the European
debt crisis, a slowdown in the  U.S. economy  and the fallout
from Bordeaux’s ambitiously priced 2010 “en primeur”
campaign have contributed to an 8.4 percent drop in the Liv-ex
100 Fine Wine Index this year.  “The really tough months were September and October,”
Joe Marchant, head of investment at the London-based brokers
 Bordeaux Index Ltd. , said in an interview. “There was a big
fall-off in demand from Asia. Volumes are beginning to recover
in the run-up to Chinese New Year in January, though it will
take a while for prices to rise again.”  The global trade in fine wine -- of which auctions
represent just a part -- is worth about $4 billion, according
to the London-based Liv-ex wine exchange. Prices for top
investment-grade Bordeaux such as Chateau Lafite declined by
as much as 20 percent from August to October, said Marchant.  Asian Demand  “Now the price has come down, we’re seeing more demand
from  Asia ,” he said. “A lot of Lafite has been drunk and it
maintains its position as Bordeaux’s No. 1 First Growth.”  Christie’s will be hoping for a bounce-back of Asian
demand today when they offer more than 800 bottles of Lafite
owned by Evelyn de Rothschild, a U.K. member of the family
that owns the Pauillac vineyard.  Vintages range from 1998 to 2008. Three 12-bottle cases
of Lafite’s highly rated 2000 are estimated at 14,000 pounds
to 18,000 pounds each. The same wine was selling for
HK$372,000 ($47,900) a case at Christie’s, Hong Kong, in
April.  Christie’s two-day sale in  London  carries an overall
estimate of 2.7 million pounds to 3.4 million pounds for its
auction of more than 960 lots.  Rising Burgundies  Burgundy’s premier wine, Romanee-Conti, headlines at both
 Sotheby’s (BID)  in London on Dec. 7 and at Acker Merrall in Hong
Kong on Dec. 8 and 10.  The rise of Bordeaux prices has prompted Asian buyers
to look further afield, pushing up values of top-name
Burgundies, particularly those made by the Domaine de la
Romanee-Conti.  DRC’s signature Romanee-Conti wine, made out of grapes
from a tiny, sole-owned 4.3 acre vineyard, has been upwardly
mobile in 2011. A case of the 1988 vintage fetched 52,900
pounds at Sotheby’s, London, in April 2010. The price rose to
86,250 pounds at Christie’s on June 9 this year.  Sotheby’s has placed an estimate of 60,000 pounds to
80,000 pounds on a 12-bottle case of the 1988 vintage in its
London sale. A case of DRC’s less tannic and smoother 1990 is
valued at 72,000 pounds to 110,000 pounds. Eleven bottles of
Chateau Lafite’s equivalent vintage, produced from a 222 acre
vineyard, is included in the same catalog, priced at 4,800
pounds to 5,500 pounds.  The 819-lot sale carries an overall estimate of 1.75
million pounds to 2.2 million pounds.  Luxury Thirst  “It’s not just DRC,”  Simon Davies , head of marketing at
the London-based wine brokers  Fine + Rare Wines Ltd. , said in
an interview. “Domaines like Latour say they could sell all
their Grand Cru production to Asia if they wanted to. The
Chinese demand for wine is part of the luxury-goods market.
And Romanee-Conti is the best of the best.”  New York-based Acker Merrall, which last year topped the
league of auctioneers with $98.5 million of sales, has billed
a “vertical” run of DRC Romanee-Conti bottles from 1952
through 2007 as the “most important wine lot to be sold in
2011 anywhere in the world.” From a European cellar, it will
be offered in the company’s  Hong Kong  auction with an estimate
of HK$4.8 million to HK$6.4 million.  Twelve bottles of 1962 Romanee-Conti in their original
wooden case are priced at HK$1.6 million to HK$2.4 million.  Acker Merrall’s 825-lot event will be December’s most
significant test of Asia’s continuing thirst for rare Burgundy
and Bordeaux. The presale estimate is HK$70 million.  To contact the writers on the story:
