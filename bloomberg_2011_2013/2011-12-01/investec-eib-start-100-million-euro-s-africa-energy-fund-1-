Investec Ltd. and the  European
Investment Bank  agreed to start a 100 million-euro ($135
million) renewable energy funding facility in South Africa to
benefit from a power shortage in Africa’s largest economy.  The facility “allows us to treat smaller projects with the
same project management finance methodology that is usually used
for large projects,” Investec Project and Infrastructure
Finance Manager Fazel Moosa said today in an interview in
Durban, on South Africa’s east coast. It will fund proven
technologies such as wind, wave, gas and biofuels, he said.  Loans smaller than 250 million rand ($31 million) will be
issued with a ceiling of 500 million rand, he said. Interest
rates charged on loans depend on risk and the type of technology
used in the projects, Moosa said. Investec, which owns banks and
money managers in  South Africa , the U.K. and  Australia , and EIB
will contribute equally to the fund, the two lenders said in a
joint statement, e-mailed today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
