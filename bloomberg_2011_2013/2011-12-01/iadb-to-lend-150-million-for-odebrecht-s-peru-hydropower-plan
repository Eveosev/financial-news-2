The  Inter-American Development Bank 
approved a $150 million loan for the construction of what will
be  Peru ’s second-biggest hydroelectric plant.  A unit of  Brazil ’s Odebrecht SA is building the $1.2
billion plant, which will produce 406 megawatts, the Washington-
based lender said in a statement on its  website  today. The
plant’s output will represent 13 percent of Peru’s hydropower
capacity once it is completed in 2016, the bank said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
