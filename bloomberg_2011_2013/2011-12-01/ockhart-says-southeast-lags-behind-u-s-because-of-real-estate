President  Dennis Lockhart  said the economy in the southeastern
U.S. has lagged behind the U.S. recovery over the past two years
because of a more severe real estate slump.  “We have witnessed some pretty severe stress in both
residential and commercial real estate markets” in Georgia,
Florida and  Alabama , Lockhart said in a speech in Atlanta. “The
Southeast is lagging the national economy a little bit. The
 unemployment rate  is higher. The speed of recovery is a little
bit slower and a lot of that is connected to the recovery in
real estate markets and the overbuilding that took place in the
Southeast.”  Lockhart, speaking at a real estate conference hosted by
the bank, said the meeting was being held to recognize “ how
important real estate and the real estate markets are to the
overall economic recovery.” U.S. home prices have dropped by
about a third since June 2006, according to the Standard &
Poor’s/Case-Shiller Home Price Indices. Atlanta,  Las Vegas  and
Phoenix posted new post peak lows in September.  The  S&P/Case-Shiller  index of home values in 20 cities slid
3.6 percent in September from a year earlier, capping 12
straight months of declines, the group said this week.
Nationally, prices decreased 3.9 percent in the third quarter
from the same time in 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
