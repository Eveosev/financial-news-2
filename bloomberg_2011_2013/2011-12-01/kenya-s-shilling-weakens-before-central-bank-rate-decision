Kenya ’s shilling, the world’s best-
performing currency last month, weakened against the dollar
ahead of a meeting by the central bank’s Monetary Policy
Committee that is expected to leave  interest rates  unchanged.  The currency of  East Africa ’s biggest economy fell 0.2
percent to 89.65 per dollar at 9:31 a.m. in Nairobi, the
capital. It closed at 89.48 yesterday.  Uganda ’s shilling
advanced for a fourth day, gaining 0.4 percent to 2,554, while
Tanzania’s currency weakened 0.1 percent to 1,687.35.  Kenya’s MPC will leave the  policy rate  at 16.5 percent,
according to seven of the 10 economists surveyed by Bloomberg.
The rest expect a rate increase of between a quarter and 1
percentage point.  Policy makers in Kenya may have room to halt rate increases
after the shilling gained 12 percent against the dollar since
Oct. 1, partly reversing its 19 percent slump in the first nine
months of the year. That may ease price pressures in the economy
in the months ahead after drought boosted food costs this year.  Inflation  accelerated to 19.7 percent in November from 18.9
percent in the previous month, the statistics agency said
yesterday. That’s more than double the 9 percent target set by
the government for the fiscal year through June 2012.  Central Bank of Kenya Governor Njuguna Ndung’u said on Nov.
25 the bank will keep a “tight” monetary policy stance until
price pressures ease. The bank’s main priority is to “bring
inflation and inflationary expectations under control,” while
trying at the same time to bolster economic growth, the governor
said.  Higher interest rates have boosted government borrowing
costs. The average  yield  on the 91-day Treasury bill climbed to
16.6 percent at the last sale on Nov. 24, the highest level in
more than 11 years, compared with 9 percent in July, according
to central bank data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
