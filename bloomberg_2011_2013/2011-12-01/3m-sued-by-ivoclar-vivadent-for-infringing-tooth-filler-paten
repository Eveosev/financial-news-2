3M Co. (MMM) , the maker of Scotch Tape and
Post-It Notes, was sued by Ivoclar Vivadent AG in federal court
in Delaware for infringing a 1999 U.S. patent for material used
to fill and restore teeth.  Today’s lawsuit came in the wake of an action 3M filed in
Minneapolis yesterday against Ivoclar, asking a judge to declare
it doesn’t infringe the Ivoclar patent.  In the Delaware complaint, Schaan, Liechtenstein-based
Ivoclar contends 3M is violating the patent through sale of its
“Filtek” line of dental-repair materials.  “3M had constructive and actual knowledge of the patent
and the inventions embodied therein” before marketing the
products, plaintiffs’ lawyers said in court papers, which seek a
 jury trial , royalties and triple damages, as well as an
injunction to stop the infringement.  In the Minneapolis suit,  St. Paul , Minnesota-based 3M seeks
a jury trial and contends the patent isn’t valid.  “We’re looking forward to a speedy resolution by the
Minnesota court,” Donna Fleming Runyon, a 3M spokeswoman, said
in a phone interview.  The Delaware case is Ivoclar Vivadent AG v. 3M Co., 11-
cv-1183, U.S. District Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington).
The Minnesota case is 3M Co. v. Ivoclar Vivadent AG, 11-cv-3488,
U.S. District Court, District of Minnesota (Minneapolis).  To see the patent, click: 5,936,006.  To contact the reporter on this story:
