The following companies are having
unusual price changes in Bogota trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of 11:28 a.m. local time.  The  IGBC Index (IGBC)  fell 0.3 percent to 12,886.16, while the
Colcap Index rose 0.1 percent to 1,562.90.  Ecopetrol SA (ECOPETL)  ,  Colombia ’s largest oil company,
fell 0.5 percent to 4,080 pesos.  The company said it is challenging a penalty of 5.1 billion
pesos ($2.6 million) imposed by Cormacarena, a regional
conservation agency, for failing to observe environmental norms
in the Castilla production field, according to a regulatory
filing.  Ecopetrol said it is requesting the penalty be revoked
after the company adjusted its activities to meet the agency’s
norms, without giving further details.  Pacific Rubiales Energy Corp. (PRE)  , the Toronto-based
oil producer that operates fields in Colombia, fell 1.3 percent
to 40,820 pesos.  Holders of the company’s convertible debentures converted
98.9 percent of the securities into 20.5 million ordinary shares
under a temporary incentive conversion rate increase that
expired Nov. 29, according to a regulatory filing. The temporary
incentive, which was aimed at reducing the company’s debt, may
be diluting the shares, said Juan David Pineros, an analyst at
Interbolsa SA.  To contact the reporter on this story:
