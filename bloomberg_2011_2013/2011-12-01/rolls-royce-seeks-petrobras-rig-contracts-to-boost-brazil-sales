Rolls-Royce Holdings Plc  will bid to
sell 16 more oil-platform power turbines to  Petroleo Brasileiro
SA (PETR4)  after a $650 million contract with the state-run company
almost doubled its market share in Brazil.  The drive to supply Petrobras with power-generation
equipment for offshore platforms is part of efforts to double
sales in  South America  in 10 years, Francisco Itzaina, head of
Rolls-Royce for the region, said today in an telephone interview
from  Rio de Janeiro . The London-based company’s South America
unit currently has annual sales of about $700 million, he said.  Brazilian offshore platforms will require about 200 energy
turbines in 10 years as Petrobras and other oil producers tap
deep-water reserves including the largest discoveries in the
Americas in more than three decades, according to Itzaina.
Petrobras plans $224.7 billion of investments through 2015 to
develop the so-called pre-salt deposits sitting miles below the
floor of the Atlantic trapped under layers of rock and salt.  Petrobras last month awarded Rolls-Royce a contract to
supply 32 natural-gas turbines for eight offshore platforms. The
sale boosted Rolls-Royce’s market share in the Brazilian market
for platform turbines to about 70 percent from 40 percent,
Itzaina said.  Rolls-Royce  rose  1.7 percent to 741 pence at 1:28 p.m. in
 London , extending this year’s gain to 17 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
