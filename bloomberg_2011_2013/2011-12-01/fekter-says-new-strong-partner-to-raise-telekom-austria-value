Austria ’s Finance Minister Maria Fekter hopes that partly state-owned  Telekom Austria AG (TKA) ’s value
will increase because of its “new strong partner.”  Investor Ronny Pecik’s RPR Privatstiftung last week
acquired a 15 percent stake in the former telephone monopoly,
making him the second-biggest owner after the government, which
holds a 28 percent stake.  “We have a new strong partner who will bring in management
know-how and I hope when we” rethink selling the government’s
stake, it will be more valuable, Fekter said in a Bloomberg
Television interview in Brussels yesterday, without identifying
Pecik by name.  The Finance Minister is "very positive on privatization
issues" and called Telekom Austria one of Austria’s "special
things" that require shareholders to consider the country’s
long-term interests. Austria has to prepare for future
privatizations to ensure the country gets the best price for its
assets, Fekter said.  Telekom Austria ’s shares have declined 18 percent this
year, valuing the company at 3.81 billion euros ($5.1 billion).
Austria stake is “not such a huge amount that our debt will
come down” should the government decide to sell, Fekter said.  OeIAG, Austria’s state assets agency which manages the
government’s stake in Telekom Austria, said on Nov. 26 that it
was a “stable core shareholder” in Telekom Austria.  To contact the reporter on this story:
