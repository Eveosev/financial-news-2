The  Green Bay Packers  will be seeking
$62.5 million when they make stock available to the public at
$250 a share starting next week.  It will be the fifth stock sale and the first in 14 years
for the Packers, the only publicly owned franchise in U.S.
sports, according to a statement e-mailed yesterday by the team.  The Packers, at 11-0 the only undefeated team in the
 National Football League  this season, will start the sale on
Dec. 6 at 9 a.m. New York time, according to the statement.
Shares will be available on the Packers’ website or via mail
and sold to individuals in the 50 U.S. states, as well as  Guam ,
 Puerto Rico  and the  U.S. Virgin Islands .  “We appreciate the interest that fans have expressed in
our fifth stock offering,” club President  Mark Murphy  said in
the statement. “We look forward to formally launching the
offering next week.”  The team declined to comment further on the sale due to
legal considerations, spokesman Aaron Popkey said in an e-mail.  The team last sold stock in 1997, when it raised $24
million at $200 a share to update  Lambeau Field . On Aug. 25, six
months after the team won its fourth Super Bowl title, Murphy
announced that the Packers were considering another stock sale
as part of a $140 million renovation to the 54-year-old stadium.  The team will initially offer 250,000 shares, which would
raise $62.5 million. No one will be allowed to purchase more
than 200 shares -- including ownership from previous sales --
and the sale will run until Feb. 29, according to the statement.
The team said it may extend that deadline.  The Packers have about 112,000 shareholders owning 4.75
million shares. The team has sold shares four times in its 93-
year history, first in 1923, when 1,000 people bought $5 shares.  Pre-Holiday Sale  The Packers’ goal was to hold the stock sale before the
December holidays, Vice President of Administration  Jason Wied 
said in an interview three months ago. NFL Commissioner  Roger Goodell  approved the team’s plan on Oct. 8.  The $140 million renovation, which will add two gates and
about 6,600 seats, will be funded mostly through the stock sale
and debt, Wied said in September.  Green Bay  has a population of 104,057, according to the
 U.S. Census Bureau , making it the smallest market in the NFL.
The Packers are valued at $1.08 billion, ninth highest in the
league, according to Forbes magazine.  The Packers are the third most-popular team in the NFL
behind the Dallas Cowboys and Pittsburgh Steelers, according to
a 2011 Harris Poll.  Quarterback  Aaron Rodgers , who is No. 1 in the league with
a 127.7 passer rating and 71.8 completion percentage, leads all
players in 2012 Pro Bowl balloting, the NFL announced today on
its website. The Packers have the lead vote-getter in 10 of the
19 National Football Conference positions.  To contact the reporters on this story:
