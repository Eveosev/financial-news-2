New York City  started the initial
phase of infrastructure work at Willets Point in Queens,
including construction of a sanitary sewer main, with the goal
of creating a new mixed-use neighborhood in Queens.  The work represents a first step in the environmental
remediation of the long-contaminated site, according to a
statement issued by the city.  “This major investment in infrastructure will create jobs,
catalyze private sector investment, and lay the groundwork for
New York City’s next great neighborhood,” said Mayor Michael
