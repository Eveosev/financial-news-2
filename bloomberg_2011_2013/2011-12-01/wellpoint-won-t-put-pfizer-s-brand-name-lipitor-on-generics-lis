WellPoint Inc. (WLP) , the largest U.S.
health insurer by enrollment, won’t put  Pfizer Inc. (PFE) ’s brand-name
Lipitor drug on its generics list and will instead favor a copy
made by  Watson Pharmaceuticals Inc. (WPI) , Kristin Binns, a
spokeswoman for the insurer, said in an e-mail.  Lipitor, the cholesterol medication that is Pfizer’s
biggest product, began facing generic competition as of
yesterday. The drugmaker has been making agreements with
insurers and pharmacy benefit managers to favor its brand
version and block generic competitors in return for price cuts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
