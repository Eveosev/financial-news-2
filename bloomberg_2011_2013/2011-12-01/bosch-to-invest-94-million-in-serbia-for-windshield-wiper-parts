Robert Bosch GmbH , the worldâ€™s
largest automotive supplier, will invest as much as 70 million
euros ($94 million) to build a factory to produce windshield
wiper parts and systems.  The Stuttgart, Germany-based company said construction of
the new 22,000 square-meter (236,800 square-feet) plant will
begin in 2012 with manufacturing to begin a year later and
create 60 jobs. Employment at the factory could rise to as much
as 620 by 2019, the company said in a statement today before a
news conference in Belgrade.  The factory operated by Bosch Electrical Drives will be
located in the town of Pecinci about 25 kilometers (15 miles)
from the capital Belgrade, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
