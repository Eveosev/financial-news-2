U.S. stocks were little changed as
gains in retail, technology and health-care companies helped the
market recover from an early slump led by banks.  The Standard & Poorâ€™s 500 Index was down less than 0.1
percent at 1,246.86 at 1:51 p.m. in  New York  after earlier
losing as much as 0.6 percent.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
