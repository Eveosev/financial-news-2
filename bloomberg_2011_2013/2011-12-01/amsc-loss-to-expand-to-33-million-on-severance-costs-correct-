(Corrects to say wider loss is from job cuts in headline,
and first and third paragraphs of story published Nov. 30)  American Superconductor Corp. (AMSC) â€™s
severance costs will increase its loss in the current quarter.  The company expects a net loss of less than $33 million
this quarter, Chief Executive Officer Dan McGahn said today.
AMSC, based in Devens,  Massachusetts , forecast a net loss of
less than $30 million when it reported quarterly results Nov. 9.  McGahn said AMSC will incur less than $3 million in costs
related to job cuts as it recovers from losing its largest
customer, Sinovel Wind Group Co., widening its anticipated loss.
McGahn spoke in a presentation at the Baird Clean Technology
Conference in  San Francisco .  To contact the reporter on this story:
