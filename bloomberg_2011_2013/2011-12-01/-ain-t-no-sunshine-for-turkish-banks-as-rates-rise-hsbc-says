Tighter monetary policy, quickening
inflation, a wider current-account deficit and greater  risk
aversion  due to European debt problems mean a year of lower
earnings for Turkish banks, HSBC Holdings Plc said in a report.  The U.K. bank lowered its target prices for all banks it
covers, while downgrading  Yapi & Kredit Bankasi AS (YKBNK) , Turkiye
Vakiflar Bankasi AS and  Turkiye Is Bankasi AS (ISATR)  to “neutral”
from “overweight.”  Domestic risks are already reflected in prices for Turkish
banks, which have underperformed emerging-market banking stocks
by about 20 percent since the end of September, according to the
report by analyst Tamer Sengun.  Global uncertainties, however, “could have a dramatic
impact on the stock prices, either for the better or for the
worse,” according to the report. “We would expect to become
more positive on Turkish banks when the policy makers find a way
to contain the sovereign debt crisis in the  euro zone .”  The report is titled “Ain’t no sunshine: rates have gone
higher,” following a survey issued in September titled
“Sunshine through the clouds.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
