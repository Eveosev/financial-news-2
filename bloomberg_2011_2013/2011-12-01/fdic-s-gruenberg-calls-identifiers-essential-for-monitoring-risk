U.S. regulators preparing to monitor
markets for systemic risk must establish unique identifiers to
help track complex financial transactions, the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp.’s acting chairman said in a Washington speech.  Such a system would enable government overseers “to trace
counterparty relationships, which still today are central to the
systemic risk we’re dealing with nationally and
internationally,”  Martin Gruenberg  said today at a conference
held by the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Financial
Research and the Financial Stability Oversight Council.  The research office, created by the Dodd-Frank Act as part
of an effort to prevent a repeat of the tumult that followed the
collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. in 2008, is charged
with creating a database of financial firms and products. The
office is planning to create common Legal Entity Identifiers,
unique numbers assigned to each entity.  Gruenberg, whose agency is part of the oversight council
and would be responsible for unwinding systemically important
firms in the event of a collapse, said there is “an absolutely
essential need for improved data” among regulators responsible
for monitoring systemic risk.  To contact the reporter on this story:
