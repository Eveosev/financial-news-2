Buffalo Bills receiver Steve Johnson
has been fined $10,000 for a touchdown dance that mocked the  New
York Jets ’ Plaxico Burress shooting himself, the  Associated
Press  reported, citing a person familiar with the  National
Football League ’s decision who requested anonymity.  After catching a 5-yard pass that put the Bills ahead 14-7
in the second quarter four days ago, Johnson pretended to shoot
himself in the thigh, AP said. Burress spent 20 months in prison
for carrying a weapon that led to a self-inflicted gunshot wound
in a Manhattan nightclub in 2008.  The Bills’ 25-year-old receiver then imitated a jet in
flight before crashing to the turf, for which he was penalized
15 yards, AP said. He later apologized for the celebrations
after the Bills lost 28-24 to the Jets.  Last season, the NFL fined Johnson a total of $15,000 for
two on-field displays, AP said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
