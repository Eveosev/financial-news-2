Italy  is experiencing a “difficult”
moment and a recession is likely, Development Minister Corrado Passera said.  The country can still regain credibility and “positively
surprise” the world, said Passera, a former chief executive
officer of Intesa Sanpaolo SpA, Italy’s second-largest bank.  He declined to offer details of budget measures that will
be presented by Prime Minister  Mario Monti  on Dec. 5. Passera
made his comments in a speech in Rome today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
