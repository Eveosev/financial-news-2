Turkey  extended a contract to buy
Russian natural gas through a western pipeline to June 5,
according to a cabinet decision published today in the Official
Gazette in Ankara.  Turkey is encouraging non-government companies to agree
with  OAO Gazprom (GAZP)  to import gas through the pipeline, replacing
the state gas distributor, Botas Boru Hatlari ile Petrol Tasima
AS. The energy market regulator on Nov. 23 gave 26 Turkish and
international companies 10 days to make contracts with Gazprom
in order to win import licenses.  Botas didnâ€™t renew its 25-year contract with Gazprom to
import 6 billion cubic meters of gas a year after failing to
secure a price cut earlier this year. The pipeline runs via
Ukraine, Moldova, Romania and  Bulgaria .  Turkish Energy Minister Taner Yildiz is visiting officials
in Russia today, according to state news agency Anatolia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
