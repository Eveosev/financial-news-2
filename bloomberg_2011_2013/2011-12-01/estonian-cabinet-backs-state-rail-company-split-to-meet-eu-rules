Estonia’s government authorized
Economy Minister Juhan Parts to split AS Eesti Raudtee, the rail
company renationalized in 2007, to meet European Union rules.  The separation of the company into AS EVR Infra and AS EVR
Cargo is in line with the European Commission’s requirement to
ensure the transparency and independence of rail companies by
splitting the management of infrastructure and freight
businesses, the Cabinet said in an e-mailed statement in Tallinn
today. EVR Infra will later assume the business name AS Eesti
Raudtee, it added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
