Vodafone Group Plc (VOD) ’s Italian unit is
interested in buying a stake of at least 10 percent in local
fiber-optic company Metroweb SpA.  The British phone operator has already contacted Metroweb
and some shareholders, Vodafone’s Italian Chief Excecutive
Officer Paolo Bertoluzzo told  Corriere della Sera . A Vodafone
spokeswoman confirmed his comments.  Metroweb , the owner of Milan’s largest fiber-optic network,
said in October it plans to roll out fiber in Italian cities
with a focus on the north of the country. Customers using
Metroweb’s network include  Telecom Italia SpA (TIT) ,  Fastweb SpA (FWB) ,
Vodafone and Wind Telecomunicazioni SpA. Fastweb, controlled by
 Swisscom AG (SCMN) , last month agreed to buy 11 percent of Metroweb.  Intesa Sanpaolo SpA (ISP) ’s IMI Investimenti unit and
infrastructure fund F2i SpA in May agreed to buy Metroweb from
London-based private-equity firm  Stirling Square  Capital
Partners and  A2A SpA (A2A)  in a deal valuing it at 436 million euros
($587 million)  Metroweb, whose network is the biggest in the northern
Italian city of Milan and the surrounding region of Lombardy,
has more than 7,200 kilometers (4,474 miles) of cables in an
area with potential users in 800,000 households.  To contact the reporter on this story:
