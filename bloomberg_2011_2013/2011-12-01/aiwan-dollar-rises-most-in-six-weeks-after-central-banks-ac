Taiwan ’s dollar strengthened the most
in six weeks as regional stocks jumped after central banks took
steps to boost economic growth.  Government bonds  fell.  The local dollar rose for a fourth day as foreign funds
bought $547 million more of the island’s stocks than they sold
today, according to exchange data.  China  lowered reserve
requirements for banks yesterday for the first time since 2008.
Six central banks led by the Federal Reserve yesterday made it
cheaper for lenders to borrow dollars in emergencies in a global
effort to ease Europe’s sovereign-debt crisis.  “It was a huge sentiment boost last night when central
banks around the world acted to stop things getting worse,”
said  Henry Lin , a Taipei-based foreign-exchange trader at Taiwan
Shin Kong Commercial Bank. “But I’m not sure if it’ll have more
effect than just a few days of gains in markets.”  The  Taiwan dollar  strengthened 0.7 percent to NT$30.146
against its U.S. counterpart, according to Taipei Forex Inc. It
reached NT$30.060 earlier, the strongest level since Nov. 9.  The People’s Bank of China cut the amount of cash banks
must set aside as reserves to 21 percent from a record 21.5
percent effective Dec. 5. The MSCI Asia-Pacific Index of stocks
jumped 3 percent, the most since Oct. 27.  The yield on the 1.25 percent bonds due September 2021 rose
one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 1.324 percent,
prices from Gretai Securities Market show. The central bank is
scheduled to review borrowing costs on Dec. 29.  The  overnight money-market rate , which measures interbank
funding availability, was steady at 0.398 percent, according to
a weighted average compiled by the Taiwan Interbank Money Center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
