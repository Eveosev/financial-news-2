Good morning, and welcome back to the Griddle, a morning news menu of fast food for your mind that's also healthy. We stipulate this today because a movement is afoot, particularly in  San Francisco , to encourage healthy fast food for the smallest among us. A city ordinance aimed at  childhood obesity  prohibits restaurants from giving away toys in kids' meals if they pack more than 600 calories, come with an excessively sugary beverage and have no fruits and vegetables. Prompted by the San Francisco law, McDonald's will begin today charging ten cents extra for guests who'd like a toy in their Happy Meals. Hello Kitty,  goodbye .
