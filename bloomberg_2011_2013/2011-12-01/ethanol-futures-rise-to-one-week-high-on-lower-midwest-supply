Ethanol futures in  Chicago  rose to
the highest price in more than a week amid tighter supply of the
biofuel.  Futures gained a day after an Energy Department report
showed ethanol stockpiles declined 2.3 percent to 17 million
barrels last week, the steepest decline and lowest level since
the week ended Nov. 4. Supply in the Midwest is 6 percent lower
than a year earlier.  “The December contract is coming up to delivery,” said
Justin Dirico, senior ethanol trader at SCB & Associates in
Chicago. “There’s been some barges headed to the East Coast,
but in the Midwest there’s still a need for prompt barrels.
People are scrambling.”  Denatured ethanol for December delivery rose 4.3 cents, or
1.7 percent, to $2.527 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade,
the highest price since Nov. 22. The futures fell 9.9 percent in
November and have climbed 6.3 percent this year.  In cash market trading, ethanol in the U.S. Gulf sank 10.5
cents, or 3.6 percent, to $2.82 a gallon and on the West Coast
the biofuel plunged 9 cents, or 3.1 percent, to $2.795,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol in Chicago decreased 6.5 cents, or 2.3 percent, to
$2.71 a gallon and in  New York  the additive slipped 0.5 cent to
$2.82.  To contact the reporter on this story:
