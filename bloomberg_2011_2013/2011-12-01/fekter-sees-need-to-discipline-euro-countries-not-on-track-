Austria ’s Finance Minister Maria Fekter said that euro-zone countries that aren’t “on track”
regarding  deficit reduction  will need to be “disciplined.”  “All the countries have to do their homework on deficits
spending and debt reduction” to make the euro area “more
stable,” Fekter said in a Bloomberg Television interview in
Brussels yesterday. “We have to discipline those who are not
really on track” and don’t comply with “the rules on which we
have decided,” she said.  “All those who have deficit of about 80 percent of gross
domestic product have to do their homework and even those who
have no structural GDP growth” have to make an effort, said
Fekter, who has been Austria’s finance minister since April.
“Growth and debt reduction” are the “key of stabilization,”
she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
