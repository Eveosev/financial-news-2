The  Food and Drug Administration 
hasn’t approved  Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd. (RBXY) ’s generic version of
 Pfizer Inc. (PFE) ’s $10.7 billion Lipitor cholesterol pill,  Sandy
Walsh , a spokeswoman for the agency, said.  An FDA vendor made a mistake and a statement from the
agency announcing the approval of Ranbaxy’s generic drug was
distributed in error, Walsh said in an e-mail.  To contact the reporter on this story:
