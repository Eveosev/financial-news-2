Midwest diesel weakened to the lowest
level in 21 months as  Enterprise Products Partners LP (EPD)  lifted
transit time restrictions on its pipeline system because of high
supplies of the product.  “System supply of ultra-low-sulfur diesel has risen to
approximately 1.8 million barrels for a 14-day supply,” the
Houston-based company said in a bulletin to shippers today.
“Shippers are still required to nominate all deliveries,
however they will have the ability to satisfy those nominations
without regard to transit time.”  The discount for ultra-low-sulfur diesel in the  Midwest , or
Group 3, widened 1.5 cents to 5.25 cents a gallon versus heating
oil futures traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 2:43
p.m. in  New York , according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It’s
the lowest level since Feb. 16, 2010. Prompt delivery fell 6.3
cents to $2.9209 a gallon.  The discount for the same fuel in  Chicago  widened 2.5 cents
to 13 cents a gallon.  The Enterprise TE Products pipeline stretches 4,600 miles
from Texas through the Midwest to the U.S. Northeast, according
to the company’s website. It can carry 340,000 barrels a day of
refined products, petrochemicals and liquefied petroleum gas.  To contact the reporter on this story:
