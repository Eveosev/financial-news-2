Mark Zandi , chief economist of
Moody’s Analytics Inc., said today that the  European Central
Bank  is “fully engaged” in coping with the debt crisis in
Europe.  “The fact that the central banks have stepped up is a
strong statement,” Zandi said in New York at the Bloomberg
Hedge Fund Conference hosted by Bloomberg Link. “I think they
will buy more bonds once they get more clarity.”  While the ECB is buying the bonds of debt-strapped
governments such as Italy and Spain, it says the purchases are
limited, temporary, and aimed solely at restoring the
effectiveness of its interest rates on financial markets.
European finance ministers discussed the issue of the Frankfurt-
based bank’s ability to buy bonds at the “margins” of a
meeting in Brussels yesterday.  “There is a discussion on how the ECB can be better
enabled to buy bonds,” said Austrian Finance Minister Maria Fekter, whose country along with  Germany  has been one of the
main opponents of a greater role for the ECB.  The ECB has resisted calls to become a lender of last
resort, saying its mandate prevents the bank from propping up
irresponsible  government spending .  “The ECB does not have the powers to support
governments,” ECB Executive Board member Juergen Stark said at
a speech in Dallas yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
