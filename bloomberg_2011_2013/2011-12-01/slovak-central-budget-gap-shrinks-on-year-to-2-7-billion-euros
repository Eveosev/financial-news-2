Slovakia’s 11-month central budget
 deficit  shrank to 2.7 billion euros ($3.6 billion) from 3.5
billion euros in the same period last year, the  Finance Ministry 
said.  The gap represents 70 percent of the full-year target of
3.81 billion euros and compares with a deficit of 2.34 billion
euros at the end of October, according to Finance Ministry’s
web site .  The Slovak government targets reducing the deficit of the
entire public sector, which on top of the central budget
includes balances of welfare funds and other state entities, to
4.9 percent of the gross domestic product from 7.7 percent of
GDP in 2010.  The central government’s expenditures fell to 12.9 billion
euros from 13 billion euros in January-November 2010, while
revenue rose to 10.2 billion euros from 9.53 billion euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
