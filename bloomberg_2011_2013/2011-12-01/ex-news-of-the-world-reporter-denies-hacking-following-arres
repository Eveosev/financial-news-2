The former News of the World reporter
arrested yesterday as part of a U.K. police investigation into
phone hacking said she didn’t intercept calls or break reporting
rules.  Bethany Usher, who worked for newspapers including the
tabloid between 2005 and 2008, said in an e-mailed statement
today that she didn’t work at its headquarters, spending most of
her time on the road reporting in the northern part of  England .  “I have never been involved in the interception of
telecommunications in any way and strictly adhered to the Press
Complaints Commission code of practice,” said Usher, who now
teaches journalism classes at  Teesside University . “I became
disillusioned through working with some who saw human suffering
simply as fodder to fill pages. As such, I made the decision to
find an alternative career.”  Usher was at least the 19th person arrested this year by
police investigating allegations reporters illegally accessed
voice mails and computers and paid officers for stories. Usher
said she was “disgusted by revelations in recent months.” The
U.K. government is pursuing information from people involved in
the case through special hearings in Parliament and an inquiry
being conducted by Judge Brian Leveson.  To contact the reporter on this story:
