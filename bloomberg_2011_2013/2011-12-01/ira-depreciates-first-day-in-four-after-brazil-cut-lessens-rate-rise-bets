The lira weakened for the first day
in four after  Brazil ’s interest rate cut lessened expectations
for interest rate increases in  Turkey .  The lira declined 0.2 percent to 1.8310 per dollar at 9:46
a.m. in Istanbul, falling from its two-week high yesterday. The
currency lost 18.7 percent over the last 12 months, making it
the worst performer among more than 20 emerging market
currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  Brazil’s central bank yesterday reduced the benchmark rate
50 basis points for a third straight meeting, to 11 percent and
signaled it will keep cutting rates. Turkey’s two-year cross
currencyswaps fell yesterday to the lowest level since Oct 25,
falling 34 basis points to 7.82 percent. Swaps measure the cost
to exchange lira payments for dollar payments in the next two
years.  “Such interest rate cuts of course lessen rate hike
probability and it appears our central bank does not want to
hike anyway,” Burcin Metin, chief currency strategist at ING
Bank AS, said in e-mailed comments.  The lira currency may move back to 1.84 as concern over the
 current-account deficit  lingers, Metin said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
