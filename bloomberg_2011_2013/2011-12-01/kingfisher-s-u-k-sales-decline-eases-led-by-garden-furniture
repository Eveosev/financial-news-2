Kingfisher Plc (KGF) ,  Europe ’s largest
home-improvement retailer, said a sales decline eased in the
U.K. as warm weather boosted sales of outdoor furniture, and
reported third-quarter earnings that beat analysts’ estimates.  Sales at U.K. and Irish stores open at least a year fell
0.7 percent in the 13 weeks ended Oct. 29, from the same period
a year earlier, the London-based company said today. That was
better than the first-half’s 1.5 percent drop. So-called retail
profit rose 14 percent to 273 million pounds ($428 million),
beating the 263 million-pound average of seven estimates
compiled by Bloomberg.  The owner of the B&Q and Screwfix brands said sales of
outdoor seasonal products rose 12 percent, helped by warm late-
summer weather. Kingfisher also benefited from the collapse of
competitor Focus DIY. The retailer acquired 29 former Focus
stores and converted 27 to the B&Q format in the quarter.  “The short-term outlook in our major markets remains
challenging, but Kingfisher is in good shape, and we are more
able to drive market share gains, profit growth and higher cash
returns,” Chief Executive Officer Ian Cheshire said in the
statement.  Same-store sales growth in  France  slowed to 1.9 percent,
from 4.5 percent in the first half. The retailer is modernizing
its Castorama stores, adding new ranges and rolling out a ‘Do It
Smart’ campaign to make home improvement easier for customers.  Kingfisher rose 2.2 percent to 255.6 pence in  London 
trading yesterday, paring this year’s decline to 3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
