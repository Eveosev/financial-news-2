OAO Novatek ,  Russia ’s second-largest
natural gas producer, gained control of supplies to the
Chelyabinsk region, a steel and pipe-making hub, after buying
the regional distributor.  Notavek paid 1.55 billion rubles ($50 million) to boost its
stake in OOO Gazprom Mezhregiongas Chelyabinsk to 100 percent,
Novatek said today in an e-mailed statement.  The gas producer, controlled by billionaires Leonid
Mikhelson and  Gennady Timchenko , focuses on supplies to domestic
markets because OAO Gazprom, Russia’s biggest company, has a
monopoly on exports. Steelmakers OAO Magnitogorsk Iron & Steel
and OAO Mechel have plants in the Chelyabinsk region, as does
steel-pipe maker ChelPipe.  Novatek, which previously supplied 30 percent of the
region’s gas, will now meet its demand for more than 15 billion
cubic meters a year in full, according to the statement.  “This is important because Novatek takes a 100 percent
share in a very strong industrial region,” Oleg Maximov, an oil
and gas analyst at Troika Dialog, said by e-mail. Novatek will
be able to decrease sales to Gazprom from the well head
correspondingly, he said.  France ’s  Total SA (FP)  holds a 12 percent stake in Novatek and
Gazprom owns about 10 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
