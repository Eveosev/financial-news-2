European stock-index futures rose,
indicating the benchmark Stoxx Europe 600 Index may extend its
biggest four-day rally since November 2008, before Spain and
 France  sell debt amid surging borrowing costs.  Norsk Hydro ASA, the Norwegian aluminum maker, may be
active after Goldman Sachs Group Inc. advised selling the
shares. Zurich Financial Services AG, Switzerland’s biggest
insurer, may move after confirming its target for return on
equity.  Futures on the Euro Stoxx 50 Index expiring in December
gained 0.7 percent to 2,342 at 7:02 a.m. in  London . FTSE 100
Index futures advanced 0.8 percent. The December contract on the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slipped 0.2 percent. The MSCI Asia
Pacific Index jumped 3.1 percent.  Spain and France auction 8.25 billion euros ($11 billion)
of bonds today as European efforts to strengthen the region’s
firewalls against contagion failed to rein in surging borrowing
costs.  Spain  is selling as much as 3.75 billion euros of notes as
the extra yield on its 10-year bonds compared with benchmark
German bunds was 395 basis points yesterday. France, rated AAA,
is auctioning as much as 4.5 billion euros of debt as its 10-
year securities yielded 111 basis points more than comparable
German debt.  European stocks yesterday rose 3.6 percent to post their
biggest 4-day rally since November 2008 as the  Federal Reserve 
and five other central banks lowered the cost of dollar funding
and  China  cut its reserve rates for banks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
