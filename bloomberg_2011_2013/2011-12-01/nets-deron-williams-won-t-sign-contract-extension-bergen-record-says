New Jersey  Nets All-Star guard  Deron Williams  won’t sign a contract extension and likely will become
a free agent after the 2011-12 season, the Record of Bergen
County, New Jersey, said on its website.  “Based on the new rules it doesn’t make any sense for him
to sign the extension,” Jeff Schwartz, Williams’s agent,  told
the newspaper . “It has nothing to do with how much he likes New
Jersey. Because of the rules, he’s going to play the season out
and probably opt out of his deal.”  Williams could get a two-year extension from the Nets worth
about $39 million, added to the two years and $31 million still
on his contract, the newspaper said, citing rules established in
the NBA labor deal that’s been approved in principle. By opting
out, Williams could re-sign for five years and about $101
million or join another team for four years and $73 million.  “Jeff and I had spoken about Deron’s contract situation
and I am very comfortable with their decision,” Nets General
Manager Billy King said in an e-mailed statement.  Williams played in  Turkey  during the NBA work stoppage that
is now nearing a conclusion, with the league planning a 66-game
season beginning Dec. 25. The 27-year-old guard has career
averages of 17.2 points and 9.2 assists per game in six seasons
with the Nets and  Utah Jazz .  To contact the reporter on this story:
