The European Union barred exports of
surveillance technology to  Syria  following reports the regime
was procuring and using such gear.  “Exports of equipment and software intended for use in the
monitoring of internet and telephone communications by the
Syrian regime,” are banned, the 27-nation bloc said today in a
statement that included other restrictive measures.  Bloomberg News reported Nov. 4 that an Italian company,
Area SpA, was building a surveillance system that would have
given Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s regime the power to
intercept, scan and catalog virtually every e-mail that flows
through the country.  This week, a lawyer for the company, Fabio Ambrosetti,
confirmed the company is exiting the deal and the project won’t
be completed. He declined to comment further.  Earlier this year, Telecomix, a group of online activists,
discovered that technology from a U.S. company, Blue Coat
Systems Inc., was filtering web sites inside of Syria.  The  United Nations  said today it estimates the death toll
from Assad’s crackdown on dissenters this year exceeds 4,000.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
