Treasury 10-year notes fell for a
fifth day before a report that is forecast to show the  U.S.
economy  added the most jobs last month since April, reducing
pressure on the  Federal Reserve  at add economic stimulus.  U.S. 30-year yields reached the highest level in two weeks
as the nation’s manufacturing increased at the fastest pace in
five months in November. Bond yields fell in France and  Italy ,
and the  International Monetary Fund  said it may receive more
funding to combat  Europe ’s debt crisis, damping demand for the
safest assets.  “Data in the U.S. has been beating expectations,” said
 Christopher Sullivan , who oversees $1.9 billion as chief
investment officer at United Nations Federal Credit Union in New
York. “We’re tracking sub-trend growth, but growth
nonetheless.”  The benchmark 10-year  yield  rose two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 2.09 percent at 5 p.m.  New York  time,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The 2 percent note
due November 2021 dropped 5/32, or $1.56 per $1,000 face amount,
to 99 7/32. The yield reached 2.14 percent, the highest since
Nov. 14.  Thirty-year yields climbed four basis points to 3.09
percent, after reaching 3.15 percent, the most since Nov. 14.
The two-year yield was little changed at 0.25 percent.  Debt Returns  Treasuries are up 8.8 percent in 2011, set for the best
annual return since a 14 percent gain in 2008, Bank of America
Merrill Lynch index data show. Investors bought the U.S.
securities as a haven as Europe’s debt crisis threatened to
infect the region’s larger economies.  The U.S. 10-year yield has traded in a 28-basis-point range
since Oct. 31, with a high of 2.15 percent and a low of 1.87
percent.  Treasuries fell yesterday after the Fed said in a statement
that the premium banks pay to borrow dollars overnight from
central banks will decline by half a percentage point to 50
basis points. The Fed coordinated the move with the  European
Central Bank  and the central banks of Canada, Switzerland, Japan
and the U.K.  The three-month cross-currency basis swap, the rate banks
pay to convert euro payments into dollars, was 1.22 percentage
points below the euro interbank offered rate yesterday after
reaching negative 1.63 percentage points, the most expensive
level since credit markets froze in October 2008.  Stress Measures  “It’s another band-aid,” said Brett Rose, an interest-
rate strategist in New York at Citigroup Global Markets, one of
21 primary dealers that trade with the Fed. “It seems to be
working for now.”  The  two-year swap spread , the difference between two-year
swap rates and comparable maturity Treasury yields, narrowed to
as low as 39 basis points yesterday, the least since Nov. 10. It
widened today by 1.5 basis points to 43 basis points.  The  TED spread , which measures the difference between
three-month Treasury bill yields and the London interbank
offered rate, rose to 53 basis points, the most since June 2009,
indicating rising demand for dollar loans.  German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  reiterated her opposition
to joint euro-area bonds today, Economy Minister Philipp Roesler
said in a speech in Berlin today. ECB President  Mario Draghi , in
an address to the European Parliament in Brussels today, said
the bank’s bond-purchase program “can only be limited” and
that “a new fiscal compact” in Europe will be a better way to
stop the debt crisis.  Central Banking  Christine Lagarde , head of the International Monetary Fund,
said Group of 20 nations are prepared to boost the fund’s
resources as the European debt crisis threatens the global
recovery. “If circumstances require, the G-20 will commit the
resources that are necessary for the IMF to play its systemic
role,” she said during a joint press conference with Brazilian
Finance Minister  Guido Mantega  in Brasilia today.  Spain  sold 3.75 billion euros ($5.1 billion) of securities,
the Bank of Spain said, meeting the Treasury’s maximum target.
While Spain paid the most since at least 2005 to borrow for five
years, investors ordered more than twice the amount of
securities on offer today.  The  premium   France  pays to borrow for 10 years relative to
 Germany  has more than halved since surging to a two-decade high
of more than 200 basis points last month. Italy’s 10-year
government debt yield fell to 6.81 percent, dropping below 7
percent on a closing basis for the first time since Nov. 23.  Jobs Data  The  Institute for Supply Management ’s factory index
increased to 52.7 last month from 50.8 in October, the Tempe,
Arizona-based group’s data showed today. Readings above 50
indicate expansion, and economists surveyed by Bloomberg News
projected a gain to 51.8. Orders and production grew at the
fastest pace since April.  More Americans than forecast filed applications for
 unemployment benefits  during the holiday-shortened week,
signaling limited recovery in the labor market.  Jobless claims climbed by 6,000 to 402,000 in the week
ended Nov. 26 that included the Thanksgiving holiday, Labor
Department figures showed today in  Washington . The median
forecast of 43 economists in a Bloomberg News survey called for
a drop to 390,000.  U.S. payrolls gained by 125,000 during November, compared
with an increase of 80,000 in October, according to the median
forecast in a Bloomberg News survey of 90 economists. Companies
added more workers to payrolls than economists predicted last
month, data from New Jersey-based ADP Employer Services showed
yesterday.  U.S. 10-year yields will end the year at 2.2 percent,
according to the weighted average of a Bloomberg News survey of
66 economists and strategists. The yield will reach 2.46 percent
by the end of June 2012, the survey shows.  To contact the reporter on this story:
