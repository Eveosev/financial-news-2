OAO Rosneft ,  Russia ’s largest oil
producer, may pay $1.2 billion and provide a $1 billion loan to
enter Petroleos de Venezuela SA’s Carabobo-2 project, Interfax
said, citing Rosneft Chief Executive Officer Eduard Khudainatov
speaking in southern Russia.  Khudainatov was confirming comments made this week by
Venezuelan Oil Minister Rafael Ramirez, the news service said.  Rosneft’s interest in the Venezuelan field relates to its
size, potentially 5 billion metric tons of oil, and proximity to
the U.S. market, Interfax said, citing Khudainatov.  Rosneft isn’t looking for additional projects in Venezuela
now, the news service said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
