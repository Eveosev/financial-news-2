U.S. Treasury Secretary  Timothy F.
Geithner  said yesterday’s action by the  Federal Reserve  and five
other central banks to cut the cost of borrowing dollars in
emergencies is a “responsible, sensible” way to diminish
pressure on  Europe .  “This was a responsible, sensible way for the Federal
Reserve and other central banks to try to diminish some of the
pressures you’re seeing on European financial institutions,”
Geithner told reporters today. His remarks came at the offices
of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, where he called on
Congress to quickly confirm a director of the new bureau.  The six central banks cut the cost for borrowing dollars in
an effort to ease Europe’s sovereign-debt crisis. The central
banks also agreed to create temporary bilateral swap programs so
funding can be provided in any of the currencies “should market
conditions so warrant.”  That action is “in our interest to do because we can be
successful in reducing the need those institutions face to
delever -- that’s the phrase in financial markets -- and will
reduce the pressure on growth in  emerging markets  elsewhere that
comes from that and there’s a very compelling case for that type
of action,” Geithner said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
