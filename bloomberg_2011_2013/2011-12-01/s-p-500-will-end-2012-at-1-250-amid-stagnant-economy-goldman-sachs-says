The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index will
end next year at 1,250 as a stagnating  U.S. economy  damps
valuation increases for equities,  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) ’s
 David Kostin  said.  Kostin, the New York-based strategist at the firm, lifted
his estimate for earnings by companies in the benchmark stock
measure to $100 a share in 2012 from $98, according to a note
dated yesterday. He boosted his projection for combined profit
this year by $1 to $97.  The S&P 500 declined 0.9 percent this year through
yesterday amid concern European officials will fail to tame the
region’s debt crisis, triggering a global recession. The gauge’s
price-earnings multiple based on estimated profit for the next
year has averaged 12.9 times this year and fell as low as 11
times on Oct. 3, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “The U.S. economy remains in stagnation,” Kostin said.
“This fact will limit any significant rally or sustained P/E
expansion in the  S&P 500 (SPX)  in 2012. The high degree of political
uncertainty coupled with downside policy tail risk drives our
view that equity investors should focus on the underlying
fundamentals and position portfolios for the worst while hoping
for the best.”  The S&P 500 fell 0.2 percent to 1,244.58 at 4 p.m. New York
time.  Lowest Estimate  Kostin’s projection for the S&P 500 in 2012 is 0.4 percent
higher than the index’s closing level today. His estimate is the
lowest out of six strategists’ forecasts compiled by Bloomberg.
The average estimate is for the benchmark equity measure to
climb to 1,398, according to the survey.  Goldman Sachs predicts the U.S. economy will post its fifth
straight year of economic stagnation in 2012 with growth at 1.5
percent. Kostin’s team examined 17 periods of prolonged low
economic growth in countries since 1980 and found P/E multiples
“tend to stay flat” during these times.  The collapse of the euro could wipe 25 percent in value
from stocks, driving the S&P 500 to 900, Kostin said in the
note.  “The European sovereign debt and banking crises likely
will be resolved during the next six months,” he wrote in the
note. “The euro situation must be resolved in order for tail
risk to recede and allow the possibility for share prices to
advance.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
