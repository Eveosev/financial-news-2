Rolls-Royce Group Plc , the world’s
second-largest aircraft-engine maker, can further increase
margins on “significant” potential for cost reduction,
according to  David Perry , an analyst at Goldman Sachs Group Inc.  Rolls-Royce could improve profitability at its marine
business by cutting costs in  Scandinavia , Perry wrote, following
a presentation the London-based company made to investors
yesterday. The company also can improve margins at its civil
aerospace and energy units, he said.  “Sales should double organically over the next decade and
its high levels of research and development create significant
barriers to entry,” Perry wrote. He has Rolls-Royce on
Goldman’s “conviction buy list.”  Rolls-Royce Chief Executive Officer John Rishton told
investors the company has “extraordinary visibility on
growth,” according to Perry.  Separately, Citigroup’s Jeremy Bragg maintained his “buy”
rating on the stock following the investor day.  “We continue to believe Rolls offers the attractive
combination of resilient earnings, strong balance sheet and
margin expansion potential despite current macro issues,”
Rupinder Vig, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, wrote in a note
today. He has an “overweight” rating on the stock.  Rolls-Royce rose 0.8 percent to 735 pence at 10:01 a.m. in
 London , extending yesterday’s 3.4 percent gain.  To contact the reporter on this story:
