Croatia  cleared the last European
Union hurdle to membership when EU parliamentarians approved the
country’s entry, which is due to take place in mid-2013.  The European Parliament’s green light today in Brussels
keeps Croatia on course to become the second ex-Yugoslav
republic to join the EU and the 28th member of the bloc. The EU
Parliament endorsed the accession bid by a vote of 564 to 38.  “We have given a clear sign of the extent to which the EU
wants Croatia,” Jerzy Buzek, president of the 27-nation
assembly, said in an e-mailed statement. The next step is the
signing of the accession treaty at a European summit on Dec. 9,
followed by a referendum in Croatia and ratification by all EU
countries. A single veto would derail membership.  Croatia, which broke away from Yugoslavia two decades ago
at the outbreak of Balkan civil wars, completed membership
negotiations in June. The country of 4.2 million would be
eligible for hundreds of millions of euros in EU regional-
development subsidies after joining on July 1, 2013. Smaller
Slovenia is the only ex-Yugoslav republic in the EU.  To contact the reporter on this story:
