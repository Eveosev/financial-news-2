Subaru, a unit of  Fuji Heavy
Industries Ltd. , is halting sales of three of its four 2012
models in the U.S. as it recalls the cars for a brake defect.  About 3,000 Impreza, Legacy and Outback vehicles are
affected, Michael McHale, a U.S.-based spokesman for the
company, said by telephone today. Subaru cars sold in other
countries contain the same types of brakes, he said, without
specifying if they would also be recalled.  “It’s excessive brake travel, so when you press the
brakes, it just feels a little off,” McHale said. “The brakes
still work fine.” The Forester sport-utility vehicle, which has
different parts, isn’t included.  Employees of the Tokyo-based company noticed the defect
when moving the cars around lots, he said.  The recall is being done to replace master cylinders,
McHale said. The repair can be done in about an hour. McHale
said he doesn’t know which company supplied the defective parts.  Autoweek magazine reported the recall earlier today on its
website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
