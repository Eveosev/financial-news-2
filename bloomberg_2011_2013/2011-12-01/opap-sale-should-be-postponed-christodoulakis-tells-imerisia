The sale of a Greek government stake
in  Opap SA (OPAP)  should be delayed until the first half of 2013, the
head of state asset sales at  Greeceâ€™s finance ministry  told
 Imerisia .  The company needs time to set up a network of video lottery
terminals to boost its valuation before the stake is sold, the
Athens-based newspaper cited George Christodoulakis as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
