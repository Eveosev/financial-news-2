The Netherlands is leading a group of
smaller northern euro-area states seeking to ensure that Jose Manuel Gonzalez-Paramo isn’t replaced by another Spaniard on the
European Central Bank’s Executive Board next year,  Financial
Times Deutschland  reported.  The northern European states want one of their own to
succeed Gonzalez-Paramo, a move that would redress what they see
as an over-proportion on the ECB’s central committee of central
bankers from indebted states, the FTD reported.  The group also feels that a northerner would more strictly
police price stability, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
