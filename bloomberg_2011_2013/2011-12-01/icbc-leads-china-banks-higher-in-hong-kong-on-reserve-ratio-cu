Industrial & Commercial Bank of China
Ltd. (1398)  led local rivals higher in Hong Kong trading after  China ’s
central bank yesterday said it will cut the  reserve requirement 
for the first time in almost three years.  Shares of ICBC rose 7.7 percent to HK$4.64 as of 9:57 a.m.
local time, heading for its biggest one-day gain in a month.
 China Construction Bank Corp. (939)  advanced 4.6 percent and  Bank of
China Ltd. (3988)  climbed 7.5 percent. Reserve requirements for banks
will decline by 50 basis points effective Dec. 5, the central
bank said on its website yesterday.  The cut, the first since 2008, may increase the likelihood
of a “soft landing” as the world’s second-biggest economy
slows, May Yan, an analyst at Barclays Plc, said in a note to
clients. The move may free up 396 billion yuan ($62 billion) in
the financial system, she estimated.  “The move should help improve the liquidity of the banking
system,” Stanley Li, an analyst in  Hong Kong  at Mirae Asset
Securities (HK) Ltd., wrote in a research report today. “We see
this RRR cut as a short-term positive for banks, particularly
smaller banks.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
