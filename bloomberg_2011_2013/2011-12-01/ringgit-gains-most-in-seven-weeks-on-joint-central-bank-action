Malaysia’s ringgit climbed the most
in seven weeks after six central banks led by the  Federal
Reserve  made it cheaper for lenders to borrow dollars, spurring
demand for higher-yielding assets.  The MSCI Asia-Pacific Index of shares rose for a fourth day
after the monetary authorities agreed to reduce the  interest
rate  on dollar-liquidity swap lines by 50 basis points. The
ringgit reached the strongest level in two weeks after Bank
Negara Malaysia data showed that global funds raised  holdings  of
local-currency debt by 2.6 percent in October, the first
increase since July.  “Risk appetite has improved, tracking developments in
Europe and the U.S.,” said Zulkiflee Nidzam, head of foreign-
exchange trading at Asian Finance Bank Bhd. in Kuala Lumpur.
“The ringgit’s gain may be limited as the debt crisis in  Europe 
isn’t resolved yet.”  The ringgit surged 1.1 percent, the most since Oct. 10, to
3.1410 per dollar as of 4.06 p.m. in Kuala Lumpur, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. It touched 3.1360, the currency’s
strongest level since Nov. 15.  The value of ringgit-denominated debt  held  by global funds
rose to 171.6 billion ringgit ($55 billion) from 167.3 billion
ringgit in September, Bank Negara Malaysia said on its website.
Their holdings of  government bonds  climbed 2.2 percent to 94.7
billion ringgit, the figures showed.  Five-year government notes advanced. The yield on the 4.262
percent securities due September 2016 decreased two basis points,
or 0.02 percentage point, to 3.27 percent, according to Bursa
Malaysia.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
