Singapore ’s  Straits Times Index 
climbed 2.2 percent to 2,761.88 at the close, the biggest
advance since Oct. 27. Just two stocks fell in the benchmark
gauge of 30 companies.  The following shares were among the most active in the
market. Stock symbols are in parentheses after the company names.  China developers: Homebuilders in China advanced after the
central bank cut the amount of cash that banks must set aside as
reserves, the first reduction since 2008, as Europe’s debt
crisis dims the outlook for exports and growth.  CapitaLand Ltd. (CAPL)  , a developer that gets about 21
percent of sales from China, rose 2.4 percent to S$2.58. Yanlord
Land Group Ltd. (YLLG SP), a China-based real estate company,
increased 1.5 percent to S$1.035.  Palm-oil producers: Crude palm-oil futures for February
delivery rose as much as 2 percent in  Kuala Lumpur  today,
snapping two days of losses.  Golden Agri-Resources Ltd. (GGR)  , the world’s second-
biggest palm-oil producer by sales, gained 2.1 percent to 71.5
Singapore cents.  Wilmar International Ltd. (WIL)  , the world’s
largest processor of the commodity, added 2 percent to S$5.16.  Biosensors International Group Ltd. (BIG)  , a maker of
drug-coated stents used to treat blocked arteries, advanced 2.2
percent to S$1.40. Nomura Holdings Inc. reiterated its “buy”
rating on the stock, saying the increase in Shandong Weigao
Group Medical Polymer Co.’s stake in the company will boost
Biosensors’ balance sheet and improve its cashflow. Shandong
Weigao raised its stake to 21.6 percent from 16.2 percent after
converting $120 million of notes into shares, Biosensors said
yesterday.  Noble Group Ltd. (NOBL)  , a Hong Kong-based commodities
supplier, jumped 5.3 percent to S$1.20. Credit Suisse Group AG
raised its rating on the stock to “outperform” from
“neutral,” saying it doesn’t expect third-quarter losses to
recur as earnings will be supported by stronger demand and
increased utilization of its sugar mills.  To contact the reporter on this story:
