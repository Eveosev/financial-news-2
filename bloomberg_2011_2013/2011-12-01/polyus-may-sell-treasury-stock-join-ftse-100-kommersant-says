Polyus Gold International Ltd. may
sell treasury stock to increase its free float and qualify for a
 London  primary listing,  Kommersant  reported, citing Dmitri Razumov, chief executive officer of Onexim Holding, which
controls about 36 percent of the Russian gold miner.  A primary listing may open the way for Polyus to be
included in the FTSE 100 Index, the Moscow-based newspaper said
today. Polyus may sell the shares as soon as it gets approval
from the government to change its domicile from  Jersey  to
London.  Polyus Gold Internationalâ€™s unit Jenington holds about 8
percent of the parent company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
