NuStar Energy LP (NS)  plans to start its
refinery in  San Antonio  tomorrow after a fire yesterday that
didn’t cause significant damage.  The blaze’s effect on output was minor, Mary Rose Brown, a
spokeswoman at the plant, said in an e-mail. San Antonio-based
NuStar has petroleum products available from inventories while
the refinery is being restarted, she said.  The fire started when a contractor at the 14,500-barrel-a-
day plant dislodged a valve in the crude unit, which allowed
kerosene to spray, Brown said. The kerosene vaporized and
ignited after the crude unit was shut down.  NuStar purchased the refinery and other assets from AGE
Refining in April for $41 million. The plant processes crude oil
from local sources including from the Eagle Ford shale
formation.  The refinery has consumed an average of about 11,500
barrels a day this year, according to a September analyst
presentation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
