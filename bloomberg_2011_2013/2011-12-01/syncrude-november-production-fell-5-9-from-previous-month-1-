Syncrude Canada Ltd. November
production fell 5.9 percent from October because of maintenance
on a hydrogen unit and a malfunction in a coker.  Production of synthetic oil averaged 229,400 barrels a day
last month, according to information on the  website  of Canadian
Oil Sands Ltd. October output was 243,800 barrels a day.  November production was affected by work on the hydrogen
unit and an upset on Coker 8-1, Canadian Oil Sands said. The
Calgary-based company said it would provide more detail on the
coker upset when it’s available.  Syncrude’s oil-sands mine and upgrader in northeastern
 Alberta  is capable of producing up to 350,000 barrels daily.
 Canadian Oil Sands  is the biggest holder in the Syncrude
venture, which includes the Canadian unit of Exxon Mobil Corp.
and China Petroleum & Chemical Corp.  To contact the reporter on this story:
