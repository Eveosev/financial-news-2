Asian stocks jumped, with the
regional index set for its biggest gain in more than two months,
after six central banks cut the cost of emergency dollar funding
for European banks and  China  reduced curbs on lending.  Developers  Agile Property Holdings Ltd. (3383)  and  Evergrande Real
Estate Group Ltd. (3333)  gained at least 15 percent, leading a gauge of
Chinese companies listed in Hong Kong to its largest jump since
2008.  Hitachi Construction Machinery Co. , a Japanese
manufacturer that depends on China for about a quarter of sales,
jumped 7.3 percent.  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , the world’s biggest
mining company, gained 4.1 percent in Sydney after commodity
prices rose.  “The coordinated dollar funding by six central banks helps
to ease concerns about a market collapse,” said Ryota Sakagami,
Tokyo-based chief strategist at SMBC Nikko Securities. “The
reduction of  reserve requirements  in China will lead to an
increase in  money supply  and that’ll push up the stock market in
China. It also enhances the expectation that China will turn its
policy stance toward monetary easing from now on.”  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index rose 3.2 percent to 117.19 as
of 7:50 p.m. in  Tokyo , headed for its largest gain since Sept.
27. All but one 10 industry groups on the measure advanced, with
about six  stocks (MXAP)  gaining for each that declined.  The index, priced in dollars, fell during normal trading
yesterday before turning positive overnight as the joint action
by central banks spurred gains in the Japanese yen and the
Australian dollar, inflating the value of stocks denominated in
those currencies.  Hang Seng Jumps  Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index jumped 5.6 percent, its second-
biggest gain since April 2009, while China’s Shanghai Stock
Exchange Composite Index increased 2.3 percent. Japan’s  Nikkei
225 Stock Average (NKY)  rose 1.9 percent. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200
index gained 2.6 percent. South Korea’s Kospi Index advanced 3.7
percent.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index sank 6.7 percent last month,
compared with a 0.5 percent drop by the S&P 500 and a 1.4
percent slump by the Stoxx  Europe  600 Index. Stocks in the Asian
benchmark are valued at 12.6 times estimated earnings on
average, compared with 12.6 times for the S&P 500 and 10.5 times
for the Stoxx 600.  The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPXL1)  jumped 4.3 percent in  New
York  yesterday, its biggest gain since Aug. 11, after the
 Federal Reserve  and five other central banks took action on
Europe’s debt crisis by making it cheaper for lenders to borrow
in dollars. Futures on the S&P slipped 0.2 percent today.  Clear Easing Signals  “There’s optimism European leaders will this time come up
with a decent and specific solution to the debt crisis,” said
Yoshinori Nagano, a senior strategist in Tokyo at Daiwa Asset
Management Co. “There’s clear signals that China and other
central banks are shifting from tightening to easing policies,
and the market’s taking that favorably.”  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index surged 16 percent between Oct.
5 and Oct. 28, as news suggesting European leaders are moving
closer to containing the region’s debt crisis spurred optimism
after the market fell to its lowest since 2009. During the
period, European leaders agreed to expand a bailout fund to $1.4
trillion and carved out a second aid package for  Greece .  Shares then fell back down by 13 percent through Nov. 25 as
Greece proposed a referendum on the aid package, its Prime
Minister George Papandreou and Italian counterpart Silvio
Berlusconi both stepped down, and German Chancellor Angela
Merkel ruled out common euro-area bonds after selling a fraction
of the bonds it auctioned.  Reserve Ratio Cut  China lowered reserve requirements for banks, allowing more
lending, for the first time since 2008. The central bank’s
decision to cut reserve ratios by 50 basis points may add 350
billion yuan ($55 billion) to the financial system, according to
UBS AG.  Chinese developers and banks accounted for half of the top
10 gains in the MSCI Asia Pacific Index. Agile Property soared
15 percent to HK$6.79, while Evergrande gained 16 percent to
HK$3.50 in Hong Kong. China Merchants Bank Co., a Shenzhen-based
provider of commercial banking services, increased 14 percent to
HK$15.84.  China National Building Material Co. (3323) , a maker of the
building materials, jumped 16 percent to HK$10.18. Hitachi
Construction rose 7.3 percent to 1,423 yen in Tokyo.  Measures of energy and material companies had the biggest
gains among the 10 industries in the Asia-Pacific gauge. BHP
rose 4.1 percent to A$36.35 in Sydney. Jiangxi Copper Co.,
China’s biggest producer of the metal, jumped 13 percent to
HK$19.30 in Hong Kong. Mitsubishi Corp., Japan’s biggest trading
company by market value, increased 4.7 percent to 1,624 yen in
Tokyo.  Crude oil for January delivery rose 0.6 percent to $100.36
a barrel in New York yesterday. The London Metal Exchange Index
of prices for six industrial metals soared 5 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
