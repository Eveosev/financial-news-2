Annie’s Inc., the Berkeley,
California-based maker of organic and natural packaged foods,
filed to raise $100 million in an initial public offering.  The company, which  makes  more than 125 products such as
macaroni and cheese and bunny-shaped graham crackers, didn’t
specify the number of shares it will offer or a  price range . The
$100 million amount is typically used as a placeholder to
calculate fees and may be subject to change.  Sales in the fiscal year ended March 31 increased 22
percent to $117.6 million, according to a filing with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission. Net income more than tripled
in the period, to $20.2 million from $6 million a year earlier.  Annie’s plans to use net proceeds from the offering for
general corporate purposes. The company was founded more than 20
years ago by Annie Withey and Andrew Martin. Solera Capital LLC,
a private-equity firm based in  New York , owns more than 90
percent of the company.  The stock will be listed on the New York Stock Exchange
under the symbol BNNY. Credit Suisse Group AG and  JPMorgan Chase
& Co. (JPM)  are managing the IPO.  To contact the reporter on this story:
