     Dec. 1 (Bloomberg) --Michael Balboa, a former portfolio
manager at Millennium Global Investments Ltd., was sued by the
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission over claims he engaged
in a fraud scheme involving Nigerian sovereign debt.  Balboa and Gilles De Charsonville, described by regulators
as an independent broker based in Madrid, allegedly over-valued
two illiquid and sizeable securities positions and were able to
“generate millions of dollars in illegitimate management and
performance fees,” according to the complaint filed today in
federal court in  New York ,  Balboa’s portfolio suffered almost $1 billion in losses and
was forced to close in October 2008 in the wake of the credit
crisis, the  SEC  said in court papers.  Federal prosecutors in New York filed a related criminal
complaint against Balboa today, charging him with conspiracy to
commit securities and wire fraud and separate counts of wire and
securities fraud. De Charsonville wasn’t named in the criminal
complaint.  The criminal case is U.S. v. Balboa, 11-mag-3038, and the
civil case is SEC v. Balboa, 11-cv-8731, U.S. District Court,
Southern District of New York ( Manhattan ).  To contact the reporter on this story:
