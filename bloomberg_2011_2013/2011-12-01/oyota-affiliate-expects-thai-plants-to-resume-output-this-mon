Toyota Boshoku Corp. , an auto parts
affiliate of  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) , expects its factories in
Thailand to resume normal output this month.  “We expect Thailand production will be fully restored by
the end of the year,” Shuhei Toyoda, president of Toyota
Boshoku, told reporters today at the Tokyo Motor Show. The car
interior parts maker gets 95 percent of its  sales (3116)  from Toyota.  Toyota last month followed Honda Motor Co. in scrapping its
profit forecast after Thailand’s worst floods in almost 70 years
brought factories in the Southeast Asian nation to a halt,
disrupting output as far away as  North America . Toyota said Nov.
9 it would resume production in Thailand on Nov. 21.  “We expect the problem to be solved by the end of the
year,” Takeshi Uchiyamada, executive vice president at Toyota,
said in an interview this week. “We don’t expect there will be
any effects on production next year.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
