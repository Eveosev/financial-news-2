Moody’s Investors Service has
proposed changes in rating criteria that may trigger cuts on
commercial-mortgage bonds, according to  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  and
Credit Suisse Group AG analysts.  The rating company has requested comments on altering the
way it treats so-called interest-only classes of securitized
debt, which could affect bonds from $600 billion of deals backed
by commercial property loans, Deutsche Bank analysts led by
Harris Trifon in New York said in a report yesterday.  Moody’s expects the ratings criteria to be implemented in
the first weeks of 2012. This could force some investors to sell
their holdings as these securities, composed of interest
payments on the underlying loans, typically carry top grades,
the analysts wrote.  The “most striking example” is an interest-only portion
of a deal by JPMorgan Chase & Co., sold just two months ago,
which could lose its AAA grade, Credit Suisse analyst Roger Lehman, said in a report yesterday.  Many interest-only securities are held by investors that
aren’t sensitive to ratings, and wouldn’t likely be traded in
the wake of downgrades, Credit Suisse said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
