New Zealand ’s commodity export prices
fell for a sixth month in November, the longest stretch of
declines since the economy contracted in 2008 and early 2009.  Prices fell 1 percent from October, according to an ANZ
National Bank Ltd.  index  released in Wellington today. In New
Zealand dollar terms, prices rose 1.2 percent.  New Zealand’s currency has slumped about 8.5 percent
against the  U.S. dollar  in the past three months as Europe’s
debt crisis threatens a global slowdown. The slide helps counter
lower commodity prices and cushions any decline in export
incomes, Finance Minister  Bill English  said this week.  The commodity-price index in New Zealand dollar terms
“remains elevated at 27 percent above the 10-year average
recorded from 2000-2009,” ANZ said in the e-mailed report.
Prices are 6.2 percent higher than a year earlier in those terms,
it said.  Twelve commodities recorded falls in the month, one rose
and four were unchanged, ANZ said. The decline was led by butter,
cheese, aluminum and wool, it said.  New Zealand’s  terms of trade index , which measures the
price of exports relative to imports, fell for the first time in
two years in the third quarter, according to a government report
earlier today. It reached a 37-year high in the second quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
