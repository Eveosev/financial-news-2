Centrica Plc (CNA) , the U.K.â€™s biggest
residential oil and gas supplier, plans to boost production to
75 million barrels of oil equivalent per year within the next
five years.  The company, which agreed to pay  Statoil ASA (STL)  $1.6 billion
for fields in the Norwegian  North Sea  last month, wants to
increase output from 50 million barrels excluding the Statoil
acquisition, Managing Director Mark Hanafin said at an investor
day today. The company will spend about 100 million pounds ($157
million) a year on exploration, he said.  Adding gas-production assets will give Windsor, England-
based Centrica more security in gas supply and offer a hedge
against volatile gas prices. The utility also wants to increase
its offshore wind-farm capacity by 300 percent to 560 megawatts
by 2016, the executive said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
