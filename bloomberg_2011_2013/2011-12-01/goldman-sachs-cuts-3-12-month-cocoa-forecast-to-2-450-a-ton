Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  cut its
three, six and 12-month price forecasts by 9.3 percent on the
growing potential for supplies to outpace demand in the 2011-12
season started last month.  Cocoa will be at $2,450 a ton on ICE Futures U.S. in New
York in three, six and 12 months, down from a previous estimate
of $2,700 a ton, Goldman said in a report dated today.  In November, cocoa prices fell to their lowest levels since
March 2009.  “The growing likelihood that global cocoa production
exceeds demand for a second year in the 2011-12 season that
started last month is leading us to lower our three- to 12-month
forecasts,” said Damien Courvalin, an analyst at the bank.  The implementation of the Ivorian reform of the cocoa and
coffee sectors, which includes a price guarantee to farmers of
as much as 60 percent of the international price, may support
investment in cocoa, he said.  Cocoa has fallen 11 percent in  New York  over the past
month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
