Colombia ’s peso bonds gained the most
in seven weeks as investors bet food producers are selling off
crops at low prices to cut losses from heavy rains, driving down
short-term food prices and inflation expectations.  The yield on the 10 percent bonds due in July 2024 fell
eight basis points, or 0.08 percentage point, to 7.56 percent,
according to the stock exchange. The decline is the biggest
since Oct. 10. The bond’s price rose 0.718 centavo to 119.348
centavos per peso.  “Many producers are selling the little amount they’ve been
able to produce at low prices to salvage something from their
harvest,” said Camilo Contreras, an analyst at Ultrabursatiles
SA. “That means an increase in the market of low quality foods
and it also means that if inflation is low this month, it may
increase shortly thereafter.”  It will be “very hard” to increase the coffee crop next
year in Colombia, the world’s second-largest producer of Arabica
coffee beans, if adverse weather persists, Colombia’s National
Federation of Coffee Growers Chief Executive Officer Luis Munoz
said at a news conference yesterday in Bogota. Above average
rainfall has caused a drop in production this year, he said.  The central bank raised the  overnight lending rate  by 25
basis points to 4.75 percent on Nov. 25, making Colombia the
only country in  Latin America  to raise rates in the past four
months.  The peso rose 0.2 percent to 1,946.30 per  U.S. dollar , from
1,950.56 yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
