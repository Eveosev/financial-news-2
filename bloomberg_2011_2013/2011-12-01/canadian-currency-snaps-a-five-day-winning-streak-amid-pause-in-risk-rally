Canada ’s dollar ended five days of
gains against its U.S. counterpart as traders trimmed positions
on higher-yielding assets before key employment reports tomorrow
in the U.S. and Canada.  The Canadian currency fluctuated as U.S. stock-index
futures and crude oil were little changed. The loonie, as
Canada’s dollar is known, was headed for a 2.8 percent gain this
week after coordinated central-bank measures relieved some
concern  Europe ’s sovereign-debt crisis is worsening. Economists
forecast a Statistics Canada report tomorrow will show job
growth resumed.  “I expect some consolidation today ahead of the employment
data tomorrow; the market has already had a lot to digest,”
Steve Butler, managing director of foreign-exchange trading in
Toronto at Bank of  Nova Scotia ’s Scotia Capital unit, said in an
e-mail message. “The patient has had another round of
surgery,” he said of countries of the euro region, “but the
bottom line is they are still on life support.”  Canada’s currency declined as much as 0.5 percent to
C$1.0223 per  U.S. dollar  before trading at C$1.0177 at 8:15 a.m.
in Toronto. One Canadian dollar buys 98.26 U.S. cents.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slipped 0.1
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
