Peru ’s central bank bought the most
dollars since July 2010 to slow gains in the sol as the local
currency rose to its strongest level in three years.  The central bank bought $326 million, its biggest daily
purchase since  buying a record $494 million  on July 14, 2010.  The sol rose 0.1 percent to 2.6990 at today’s close, from
2.7005 yesterday, according to Deutsche Bank AG’s local unit. It
earlier rose to 2.6970, its strongest level since April 2008.  Dollar sales increased in the local market as investors let
forward contracts expire after central banks acted to lower the
cost of dollar funding in an effort to ease  Europe ’s debt
crisis.  Investors won’t wind up their dollar holdings entirely “as
long as the crisis remains latent and until there are clearer
signs of a stronger sol,” said Gonzalo Navarro, head trader at
 Banco Santander  in  Lima .  The yield on the nation’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol-
denominated bond due August 2020 fell two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 5.67 percent, according to prices compiled
by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
