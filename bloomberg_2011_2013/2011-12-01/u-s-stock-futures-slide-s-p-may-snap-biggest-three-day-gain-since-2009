U.S. stocks declined as better-than-
forecast manufacturing growth and a rally in French and Spanish
bonds were not enough to extend the biggest three-day gain in
the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index since March 2009.  Financial stocks (S5FINL)  fell the most in the  S&P 500  among 10
industries, dropping 1 percent, as Massachusetts sued some of
the largest lenders over foreclosure practices.  Alcoa (AA)  Inc. lost
2.1 percent as commodities retreated. Kohl’s Corp. slumped 6.4
percent after November sales missed estimates.  Yahoo! Inc. 
advanced 3.3 percent as a group including Alibaba Group Holding
Ltd. was said to prepare a bid for the company.  The S&P 500 slid 0.2 percent to 1,244.58 at 4 p.m.  New York 
time. The index rallied 4.3 percent yesterday as six central
banks took action on  Europe ’s debt crisis by making it cheaper
for lenders to borrow in dollars. The  Dow Jones Industrial
Average  decreased 25.65 points, or 0.2 percent, to 12,020.03.
Trading volume on U.S. exchanges dropped to about  6.8 billion 
shares, or 16 percent below the three-month average.  “Pressures on the financials are still out there,”
 Timothy Ghriskey , who oversees $2 billion as chief investment
officer of Solaris Group LLC in Bedford Hills, New York, said in
a telephone interview. “The economic data was positive, but
Europe is still a concern. The coordinated central bank action
is not a solution. It buys them some time.”  Stocks rose earlier today as Spain and France sold 8.1
billion euros ($10.9 billion) of bonds, sending yields lower
across Europe. In the U.S., manufacturing expanded in November
at the fastest pace in five months.  Financial Shares  Equities reversed gains as  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) ,  Bank of
America Corp. (BAC)  and  Citigroup Inc. (C)  were among five banks sued by
Massachusetts for allegedly conducting unlawful foreclosures and
deceiving homeowners.  The  KBW Bank Index (BKX)  lost 0.8 percent after yesterday’s 7.2
percent jump. JPMorgan decreased 1.7 percent to $30.46.
Citigroup slipped 1.8 percent to $26.99. Bank of America added
1.7 percent to $5.53, reversing an earlier decline.  Gauges of commodity shares in the S&P 500 fell at least 0.6
percent after a contraction in  China ’s manufacturing fueled
concern Europe’s crisis is damaging the global economy as
yesterday’s moves by central banks were viewed as only a
temporary fix. Alcoa, the largest U.S. aluminum producer,
dropped 2.1 percent to $9.81.  Kohl’s (KSS)  fell the most in the S&P 500, erasing 6.4 percent to
$50.37. The department-store chain said sales at stores open at
least one year decreased 6.2 percent in November. Analysts on
average estimated an increase of 2.1 percent.  Most Since August  Barnes & Noble Inc. (BKS)  plunged 16 percent, the most since Aug.
19, to $14.59. The largest U.S. bookstore chain reported second-
quarter sales that missed the average analyst estimate by 4.3
percent, according to Bloomberg data.  Stocks pared declines in the afternoon as investors awaited
tomorrow’s jobs report. Payrolls may have climbed by 125,000
workers in November, after rising 80,000 the prior month,
economists surveyed by Bloomberg projected ahead of the Labor
Department report.  “People are looking for catalysts,”  Peter Jankovskis , who
helps manage about $2.4 billion at Oakbrook Investments in
Lisle, Illinois, said in a telephone interview. “One catalyst
may be additional signs of strength in the U.S. You may have
some people wanting to make sure that they are in because they
are expecting a big number on the jobs front.”  Yahoo rallied 3.3 percent to $16.23.  Alibaba Group  and
 Softbank Corp. (9984)  are in advanced talks with  Blackstone Group LP (BX) 
and Bain Capital LLC about making a bid for all of  Yahoo , said
three people with knowledge of the matter.  Above $20  A bid may value Yahoo at more than $20 a share because of
tax savings tied to the Internet company’s stakes in Alibaba and
Yahoo Japan, said two of the people, who declined to be
identified.  Clearwire Corp. (CLWR)  rallied 14 percent to $2.03. The money-
losing wireless carrier paid creditors $237 million in interest
after striking a new network-sharing agreement with partner
 Sprint Nextel Corp. (S)   The S&P 500 will end next year at 1,250 as a stagnating
 U.S. economy  damps valuation increases for equities, Goldman
Sachs Group Inc.’s  David Kostin  said.  The strategist lifted his estimate for earnings by
companies in the benchmark measure to $100 a share in 2012 from
$98, according to a note dated yesterday. He boosted his
projection for combined profit this year by $1 to $97.  Price-Earnings  The  S&P 500 (SPX)  declined 0.9 percent this year through
yesterday amid concern European officials will fail to tame the
region’s debt crisis, triggering a global recession. The gauge’s
price-earnings multiple based on estimated profit for the next
year has averaged 12.9 times this year and fell as low as 11
times on Oct. 3, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “The U.S. economy remains in stagnation,” Kostin said.
“This fact will limit any significant rally or sustained P/E
expansion in the S&P 500 in 2012. The high degree of political
uncertainty coupled with downside policy tail risk drives our
view that equity investors should focus on the underlying
fundamentals and position portfolios for the worst while hoping
for the best.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
