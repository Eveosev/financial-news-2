Spanish state-owned radio and
television station RTVE is in talks with lenders for fresh
credit as it faces a potential lack of liquidity in 2012,  Cinco
Dias  reported, citing unidentified board members.  RTVE may face a shortage of liquidity next year because of
delays caused with a new governmentâ€™s budget plans and from
telecommunications companies and commercial television stations
not paying fees, the newspaper said. The credit being sought by
RTVE will be for no longer than three months and could total 60
million euros ($81 million).  To contact the reporter on this story:
