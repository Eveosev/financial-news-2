Ceske Aerolinie AS, the Czech state
carrier known as CSA, canceled 19 flights as some pilots didn’t
show up for work to protest continuing restructuring of the
company, CSA said.  The situation will have a “negative” economic impact on
the carrier, CSA said in an e-mailed statement today. The
company can’t afford to abandon planned changes to its airline
because of such illegal protests, it said. The walkout may
continue into tomorrow, CTK newswire said, citing CSA officials.  To contact the reporter on this story: Lenka Ponikelska in
