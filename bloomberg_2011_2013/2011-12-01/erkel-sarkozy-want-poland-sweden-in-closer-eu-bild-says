German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  and
French President Nicolas Sarkozy want  Poland  and Sweden to be
part of a group of European Union states that seek closer
integration,  Bild-Zeitung  reported, without saying where it got
the information.  Merkel and Sarkozy are preparing a treaty that’s open to
any EU member state that’s willing to adhere to certain
standards in the areas of pensions, taxation, deficit reduction,
debt brakes and mutual oversight, the newspaper said today. The
two leaders take little consideration of the U.K. and the
European Commission in their approach, it said. Poland, Sweden
and the U.K. aren’t members of the euro region.  “Merkozy is without doubt a strong engine to overcome the
crisis,” the newspaper quoted EU Commission Vice President
 Viviane Reding  as saying. “But a strong engine alone is no
guarantee that the airplane will fly in the right direction,”
Reding said, calling for a strong role for the commission,
according to the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
