Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  forecast
that commodities may rally 15 percent in the next 12 months,
sticking with an “overweight” recommendation on  raw materials 
and predicting  Brent crude  may surge to highest level since 2008.  Commodities may gain as the global economy avoids recession
next year and in 2013, analysts led by London-based  Jeffrey Currie  said in a report today. Brent, the benchmark used to
price two-thirds of global oil supplies, may jump to $127.50 a
barrel at the end of next year and $135 in 2013, it said.  Goldman’s bullishness contrasts with the view from JPMorgan
Chase & Co., which cut commodities to “underweight” on Nov. 22
citing policy failures in the U.S. and crisis-hit  Europe . Data
today showed manufacturing in China, the largest user of energy
and base metals,  shrank  for the first time since February 2009.  “The European debt crisis remains a significant downside
risk in 2012,” Goldman said. “However, as long as the risks
manifest themselves in economic weakness and not in financial
stress that would likely precipitate a global recession, it is
unlikely to severely impact commodity markets.”  Commodities as measured by the S&P GSCI Spot Index are
beating equities for a fifth consecutive year, signaling that
demand from developing economies is sustaining global growth.
The gauge rallied 9.6 percent in October and  1.6 percent  last
month even as the euro-zone debt crisis intensified.  ‘Large Driver’  “The risks to this view are skewed to the upside,
particularly given the return of significant backwardation to
the oil market that could become a very large driver of
returns,” Goldman said, referring to a pattern where near-term
prices are higher than those further out.  Brent for January delivery, the most-active contract,
traded at $110.95 at 2:19 p.m. in Singapore as the December 2012
contract was at $105.73. Brent peaked this year at $127.02 in
April, and hasn’t traded at more than $127.50 since August 2008.  Goldman correctly advised investors to sell oil and copper
in April and turned more bullish the next month before prices
rebounded. The New York-based bank lowered its commodity gain
forecast from 20 percent for the  S&P GSCI Enhanced Commodity 
Index earlier this month.  JPMorgan Chase cut its commodity outlook citing Europe’s
worsening debt crisis and slowing growth across  emerging markets ,
according to the report last month. Raw materials show limited
potential for gains in 2012 as the global economy slows and  risk
aversion  boosts the dollar, Morgan Stanley analysts led by New
York-based Hussein Allidina said in a report yesterday.  ‘Potential Shortages’  Goldman economists reduced their forecast for global
economic growth next year to 3.2 percent from 3.4 percent, the
report said. “This reduced outlook, but avoidance of global
recession, makes it more likely that commodity markets can
maintain a central course between the whirlpool of a world
economic recession and the rocks of potential shortages.”  The 12-month target for copper was retained at $9,500 per
metric ton on  China ’s demand growth, the Goldman report said.
The metal for three-month delivery fell as much as 1.3 percent
to $7,781.50 on the London Metal Exchange today.  The forecast for Comex gold was held at $1,940 an ounce in
12 months, the report said. Futures traded at $1,746.90 at 2:15
p.m. Chicago-traded corn may rise to $6.85 per bushel in three
months, before sliding to $5.50 in 12 months, the bank said,
expecting “large” supplies from non-U.S. countries.  In China, the  Purchasing Managers ’ Index fell to 49 in
November from 50.4 in October, the China Federation of Logistics
and Purchasing said. That was below the median estimate of 49.8
in a Bloomberg survey of 18 economists. A level above 50
indicates expansion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
