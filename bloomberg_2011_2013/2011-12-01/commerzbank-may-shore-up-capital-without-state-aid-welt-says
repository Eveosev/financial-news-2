Commerzbank AG (CBK)  plans to introduce a
plan that will shore up its capital without state aid, Die Welt
newspaper said, citing banking officials.  Frankfurt-based Commerzbank could generate about 1 billion
euros ($1.4 billion) by retaining profit through June 30 and
boost its core capital by 3 billion euros by offloading some 30
billion euros in risk-weighted assets, the newspaper said,
citing options that will be presented to the supervisory board
tomorrow.  The lender could also generate as much as 6 billion euros
by converting hybrid capital, according to Die Welt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
