Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd.,
the world’s biggest maker of generic drugs, lost an appeals
court bid to revive a patent it claimed  AstraZeneca Plc (AZN) ’s
cholesterol drug Crestor was infringing.  Teva’s patent is invalid because AstraZeneca came up with
the formulation of rosuvastatin calcium, the active ingredient
in Crestor, first, the  U.S. Court of Appeals  for the Federal
Circuit in  Washington  said in  ruling  today on its website.  Crestor is London-based AstraZeneca’s top-selling drug,
with $4.85 billion in the first nine months of the year. A
federal judge upheld the validity of AstraZeneca’s patent on the
medicine which would block generic-drug competition until 2016.
An appeals court ruling on that case is still pending.  Teva’s patent, covering a discovery made in December 1999,
is for a way to stabilize a class of drugs known as statins
using a different compound. AstraZeneca said it came up with a
batch of rosuvastatin calcium months earlier than that. The
batch had the compound that Teva later claimed could be used as
a stabilizer, according to the ruling.  Denise Bradley, a spokeswoman for Petah Tikva, Israel-based
Teva, said the company had no comment on today’s ruling.  The case is  Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (TEVA)  v.
AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals LP, 2011-1091, U.S. Court of Appeals
for the Federal Circuit (Washington). The lower court case is
Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. v. AstraZeneca
Pharmaceuticals LP, 08-4786, U.S. District Court for the Eastern
District of  Pennsylvania  (Philadelphia).  To contact the reporters on this story:
