The cost for European banks to borrow
in dollars fell for a second day after central banks led by the
 Federal Reserve  cut the cost of emergency dollar loans.  The three-month cross-currency  basis swap , the rate banks
pay to convert euro payments into dollars, was 121 basis points
below the euro interbank offered rate at 9:02 a.m. in  London ,
from minus 131 basis points yesterday. The gap had widened to
162.5 below Euribor yesterday, the most in three years, before
the Fed move.  The premium banks pay to borrow dollars overnight will fall
by half a percentage point to 50 basis points, the Fed said
yesterday. The so-called dollar swap lines will be extended by
six months to Feb. 1, 2013.  The one-year basis swap was 70 basis points under Euribor,
from minus 79 basis points yesterday, data compiled by Bloomberg
show. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  Lenders increased  overnight deposits  at the  European Central
Bank , placing 304 billion euros ($408 billion) with the
Frankfurt-based ECB yesterday, up from 297 billion euros on Nov.
29. That compares with a year-to-date average of 81 billion
euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
