Richard Clarida , global strategic
adviser at Pacific Investment Management Co., comments on
 Europe ’s sovereign-debt crisis and what role the  European
Central Bank  may play. He spoke today with Sara Eisen on
Bloomberg Television’s “InsideTrack.”  On worst- and best-case scenarios for Europe:  “The worst-case scenario for Europe is a run of  bank
failures , collapsing confidence in sovereigns, the inability of
Italians to roll over their debt and potentially the end of the
euro -- which, if it were to happen, would make Lehman Brothers
look like a picnic.”  “The best-case scenario is a big agreement in substance
that gets the ECB engaged and restores confidence to the
markets.”  On possible ECB role:  “A credible move by a central bank that is willing to
backstop it with its balance sheet can have a big impact.”  The  International Monetary Fund  “doesn’t have a big enough
balance sheet. The IMF could maybe lend $300 or $400 billion.
But we are talking about a number over a trillion.”  “The challenge with fiscal union is that it will take two
to three years. They have to change treaties. They have to get
27 parliaments to ratify this. The near-term problem is both
liquidity of sovereigns as well as solvency, and now it’s in the
banking system. So that’s why people are looking at the ECB.
They have the one balance sheet that could be deployed in size,
like the Fed did.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
