Swiss stocks (SMI)  advanced for a fifth day
as demand exceeded supply at an auction of Spanish debt and
investors speculated that a report tomorrow may show U.S.
payrolls expanded last month.  Zurich Financial (ZURN)  Services AG, Switzerland’s biggest
insurer, and  SGS SA (SGSN) , which provides industrial inspection and
testing, added more than 1 percent.  Novartis AG (NOVN)  led gains in
health-care shares.  The Swiss Market Index, a measure of the biggest and most
actively traded companies, rose 0.5 percent to 5,681.57 at the
close in Zurich. The gauge has rebounded 19 percent from this
year’s low on Aug. 10 as the euro area’s policy makers
intensified their efforts to resolve the region’s debt crisis.
The broader Swiss Performance Index climbed 0.4 percent today.  “The French and Spanish bond auctions were well received
and priced,” Matthias Fankhauser, a  fund manager  at Clariden
Leu in Zurich, said in an interview. “Until now, we just had
disasters on that front. Professional investors are in the
market trying to buy; they all know that if we get solutions,
there is more upside.”  Spain  sold 3.75 billion euros ($5.1 billion) of notes and
had to pay the most since at least 2005 to borrow for five
years. Investors ordered more than twice the amount sold.  France 
auctioned 4.3 billion euros of debt and managed to sell a 10-
year bond at 3.18 percent, less than at a previous auction on
Nov. 3.  U.S. Payrolls  A report in the U.S. tomorrow may show payrolls climbed by
125,000 workers after rising by 80,000 in October, according to
the median forecast of 88 economists in a Bloomberg News survey.
The  jobless rate  probably held at 9 percent.  “Excepting any surprises, it’s going to be tomorrow’s non-
farm payrolls that stand to provide the next key direction for
markets,” Terry Pratt, an institutional trader at IG Markets in
Melbourne, wrote in a note today.  Switzerland ’s economy weakened in the third quarter as
companies cut spending and exports slumped.  Gross domestic
product  rose 0.2 percent from the second quarter, when it
increased a revised 0.5 percent, the State Secretariat for
Economic Affairs in Bern said today. Exports of goods and
services fell 1.2 percent from the second quarter and investment
including construction slipped 1 percent.  Zurich Financial climbed 1.4 percent to 202.80 Swiss francs
after saying solvency test ratios “remain resilient.”  SGS added 1.2 percent to 1,557 francs. Natixis included the
shares in its basket of “protection” stocks that are least
exposed to contagion from the debt crisis.  Novartis added 1.2 percent to 49.80 francs and  Actelion
Ltd. (ATLN)  added 2.2 percent to 32.49 francs.  Roche Holding AG (ROG) 
increased 1.6 percent to 147.30 francs.  Nestle SA gained 0.7 percent to 51.50 francs for the third-
biggest contribution to the increase in the SMI.  To contact the reporter on this story:
