What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets.  -- Soybean futures may open 7 cents to 9 cents a bushel higher
on the  Chicago  Board of Trade on speculation that the 7.1
percent drop in prices last month will boost demand as slow
farmer sales limit supplies,  Mark Schultz , the chief analyst for
Northstar Commodity Investment Co., said in a telephone
interview from Minneapolis. Soybean-oil futures are expected to
open 0.2 cent to 0.3 cent a pound higher, and soybean-meal
futures may open steady to 50 cents higher per 2,000 pounds.  -- Wheat futures may open 5 cents to 7 cents a bushel higher on
the CBOT, the Kansas City Board of Trade and the Minneapolis
Grain Exchange as demand improves for U.S. supplies after prices
fell to a 15-month low last month and rain damages crops in
Australia, Schultz said.  -- Corn futures are called to open 1 cent to 3 cents a bushel
higher in Chicago as demand from ethanol producers increases.  To contact the reporter on this story:
