  Assured Guaranty Ltd. (AGO) ’s bond
insurance units were cut two steps by  Standard & Poor’s  after
the ratings company overhauled the way it grades guarantors.  Assured Guaranty Municipal Corp. and Assured Guaranty Corp.
were lowered to AA- from AA+, S&P said in a statement today. The
insurers don’t hold enough capital under new restrictions to
mitigate so-called largest obligor concentrations, S&P said.  Those “could add volatility to the companies’ capital and
operating performance, and hence limit the rating without
additional capital to mitigate this risk,” S&P said.  The change “is solely based on S&P’s new criteria for
rating financial guaranty companies, as to which we have
previously registered our concerns,” Assured said in a
statement. “Despite the higher capital standards,  Assured
Guaranty  has maintained its ratings in the AA category by
continuing to execute its capital enhancement strategies.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
