Nordea Bank AB lowered its forecast
for economic growth in  Norway  next year and predicted interest
rate cuts this month and in March as consumer spending and
investments slow.  Norwayâ€™s mainland gross domestic product, which excludes
oil and shipping, will grow 2.1 percent next year, down from an
earlier forecast of 2.5 percent, the largest Nordic lender said
today in a report. It will expand 2.9 percent in 2013.  The central bank will cut rates by 0.5 percentage point
this month and by 0.25 percentage point in March, from the
current 2.25 percent, Nordea said. Unemployment will rise to an
average 3.6 percent next year from an average of 3.3 percent
this year, the bank forecast.  Policy makers in Oslo in October shelved planned rate
increases to the second half of next year because of the
turmoil. Governor Oeystein Olsen has said he is ready to cut the
benchmark if global growth prospects worsen.
