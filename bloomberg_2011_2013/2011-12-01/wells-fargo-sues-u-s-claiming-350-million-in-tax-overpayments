Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC)  sued the U.S.
government claiming it’s owed more than $350 million in refunds
for tax overpayments.  Some excess payments were caused by “computational and
data entry errors” by the  Internal Revenue Service , and the
government hasn’t acted on its claim for a refund, Wells Fargo
said today in a lawsuit filed in the U.S. Court of Federal
Claims in Washington.  Wells Fargo, based in  San Francisco , says the overpayments
involve the interest rates on taxes paid and stem from
acquisitions by the bank from 1996 through 2008.  “Wells Fargo, on its own behalf and on behalf of its
predecessors whose assets and liabilities were assumed by Wells
Fargo” filed claims for refunds “based on application of a net
zero rate of interest,” according to the complaint.  Ancel Martinez, a Wells Fargo spokesman, declined to
comment immediately on the lawsuit. Sara Eguren, an IRS
spokeswoman, said the agency doesn’t generally comment on
litigation.  The case is Wells Fargo & Co. v. U.S., 11-808, U.S. Court
of Federal Claims ( Washington ).  To contact the reporter on this story:
