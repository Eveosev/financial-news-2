Indonesia , the largest  palm oil 
grower, said it will start in January assessment of producers
seeking sustainability certification and plans to certify most
of the nation’s output under its own standards by 2014.  “There are 20 companies ready for the assessment,” said
Rosediana Suharto, chairwoman of the Indonesia Palm Oil
Commission. “The Indonesia Sustainable Palm Oil certification
will be very important for all Indonesian producers as buyers
have demanded all production to be sustainable by 2015.”  The Indonesian Palm Oil Association, a Jakarta-based
industry group, officially withdrew its membership from the
Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil on Sept. 29. The roundtable
comprises of growers, processors, traders, consumer-goods
manufacturers, retailers, banks and investors, and environmental
and non-governmental organizations involved in setting global
standards for the tropical oil.  Demand for palm oil from sustainable sources has doubled in
the past year as more consumers chose products made in an
environmentally and socially responsible way, Darrel Webber,
Secretary-General of the roundtable, said in June.  To contact the reporter on this story:
