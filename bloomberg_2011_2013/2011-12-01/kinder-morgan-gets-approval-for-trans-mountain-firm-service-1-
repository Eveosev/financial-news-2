Kinder Morgan Energy Partners LP (KMP)  will
be able to offer shippers firm service to a marine transport
facility in British Columbia from the oil sands of Alberta,
Canada’s energy regulator said.  Kinder Morgan’s Trans Mountain pipeline will be able to
offer 54,000 barrels a day of capacity on a fixed basis for
export through the Westridge Marine Terminal, the  National
Energy Board   ruled  today. The decision leaves 25,000 barrels a
day of capacity for uncommitted shippers.  Expansion Right and Step-up Right provisions that Trans
Mountain sought weren’t approved, the Calgary-based board said
in a statement. The regulator didn’t approve those provisions or
a tariff amendment, saying it didn’t consider them appropriate.  The 715-mile (1,150-kilometer) Trans Mountain system runs
from  Edmonton , Alberta, to marketing terminals and refineries in
central British Columbia, the Vancouver area and the Puget Sound
region in Washington state.  Products also are moved to California, the U.S. Gulf Coast
and overseas through the Westridge marine terminal in Burnaby,
British Columbia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
