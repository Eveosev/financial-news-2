A federal judge ordered a freeze on
the assets of funds in the case of a South Florida man accused
of running an $11 million scam.  U.S. District Judge P. Kevin Castel ordered the preliminary
injunction against Praetorian Global Fund Ltd. and its agents,
according to a filing in federal court in  Manhattan  today.  John Mattera, the operator of the funds, was charged by
federal prosecutors and sued by the Securities and Exchange
Commission for allegedly luring investors into paying for non-
existent shares in closely held companies including Facebook
Inc. and Groupon Inc.  The U.S. said that Mattera used most of the money to buy
cars and other items for himself, according to court records.  The cases are SEC v. Mattera, 11-cv-8323, and U.S. v.
Mattera, 11-cr-2947, U.S. District Court, Southern District of
 New York  (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
