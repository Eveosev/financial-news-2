The  European Central Bank  remains the
most likely institution to come to the aid of heavily indebted
euro-area nations, said  David Riley , the head of Fitch Ratings’
sovereign-debt unit.  Many shareholders in the  International Monetary Fund  “will
look at what’s going on in Europe and say that these are pretty
wealthy countries and they should be able to sort this out
themselves,” Riley said in an interview today with Bloomberg
Television’s Maryam Nemazee. “The ECB is the only pan-European
institution that can provide the bridge financing to the new
euro zone.”  The ECB has so far mostly taken the view that the euro
region’s problems are fiscal, not monetary, Riley said. European
leaders may take steps at a Brussels summit next week toward a
closer fiscal union to persuade the ECB to play a more activist
role in the crisis, he said.  “At the December 9 summit they will be looking less to
impress the markets than to impress the ECB,” Riley said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
