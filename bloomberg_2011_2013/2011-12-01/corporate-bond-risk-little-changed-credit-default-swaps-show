The cost of insuring against default
on European corporate debt was little changed, according to
traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx SovX Western Europe Index of swaps on 15
governments fell three basis points to 364 at 4:30 p.m. in
London. A decline signals improvement in perceptions of  credit
quality .  Contracts on the Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 50
companies with mostly high-yield credit ratings increased one
basis point to 756.5, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.  The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125 companies with
investment-grade ratings fell 1.25 basis points to 183.25. The
Markit iTraxx Financial Index linked to senior debt of 25 banks
and insurers decreased 1.5 basis points to 296.5 and the
subordinated index dropped seven to 520.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($13.5 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer
face value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
