Greece ’s telecommunications
regulator reached a decision on the wholesale price  Hellenic
Telecommunications Organization SA (HTO)  can charge for smaller
competitors to use its VDSL network.  Hellenic Telecom, the country’s largest phone company, will
be able to provide retail offerings through its broadband
network in six months provided it’s technically ready to provide
wholesale services for competitors, the  Hellenic
Telecommunications & Post Commission  said in an e-mailed
statement today.  The regulator decided in March to restrict OTE, as the
company is known, from introducing retail broadband services on
its VDSL network, saying it must offer it on a wholesale basis
to others.  Europe ’s former phone monopolies are upgrading their
traditional networks into Internet-based systems, including
VDSL, or very-high-bit-rate digital subscriber line, which allow
faster transmission and services such as television.  To contact the reporter on this story:
