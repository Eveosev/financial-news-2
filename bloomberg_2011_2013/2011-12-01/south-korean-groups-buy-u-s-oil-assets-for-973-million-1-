Korea National Oil Corp.  and three
South Korean companies have acquired oil assets in the U.S. for
$973 million this week, the energy explorer said.  State-owned KNOC will pay $190 million for its share of the
assets purchased with  Samsung C&T Corp. (000830) , STX Energy Co. and an
unidentified company, it said in a statement in  Seoul  today. The
assets hold reserves equivalent to 80 million barrels of oil.  Samsung C&T and KNOC agreed to pay $771.5 million to
acquire Parallel Petroleum Corp., a Midland, Texas-based oil and
gas producer, according to the statement. The deal was first
announced yesterday by Samsung C&T, which will own a 90 percent
share, and didn’t give the price. KNOC will hold 10 percent.  KNOC, STX Energy and the unidentified company agreed to buy
assets in the  Gulf of Mexico  from Northstar Offshore Energy
Partners LLC for $201 million, according to today’s statement.
The state explorer will own 67 percent of the assets, which
produce 4,700 barrels of oil a day and hold 10.8 million barrels
of reserves, it said.  KNOC said it will own 80 percent of an exploration area
purchased for $650,000 with Samsung C&T, the trading arm of
 Samsung Group , from privately-held Houston Energy. The area is
estimated to hold 1.8 million barrels of oil reserves.  To contact the reporter on this story:
