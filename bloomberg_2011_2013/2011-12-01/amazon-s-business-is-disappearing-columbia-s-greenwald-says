Amazon.com Inc. shares are  overvalued (AMZN) 
because its core business of selling books and music online is
“disappearing” and it’s competing with larger rival Apple Inc.
in tablet devices, according to  Columbia University ’s Bruce C. Greenwald.  “Amazon trading at 100 times earnings is almost a joke,”
Greenwald, a professor of management and asset management at the
New York-based university, said today at the Bloomberg Hedge
Fund Conference hosted by Bloomberg Link. “If Amazon doesn’t
deliver profitability in the long run, it’s not going to stay at
100 times earnings.”  Amazon, based in  Seattle , trades at 103 times reported
earnings for the past year, down from this year’s peak of 129.8
in October, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
company’s shares gained 2.5 percent to $197.16 in New York
trading, and have climbed 9.4 percent this year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
