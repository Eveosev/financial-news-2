OHL Mexico SAB (OHLMEX*) , a builder of roads,
cut two fiber-optic lines owned by  America Movil (AMXL)  SAB in Mexico
City yesterday, interrupting  service  for wireless customers, the
phone carrier’s Telefonos de Mexico unit said.  Telmex, as the unit is known, filed a complaint with
authorities against OHL and Constructora GAM, according to an
e-mailed statement today. Telmex said OHL, a unit of Madrid-
based Obrascon Huarte Lain SA, failed to notify it that the
lines had been cut.  America Movil’s Mexican wireless unit, Telcel, is
determining how to compensate customers affected by the loss of
service in the western part of the city, Arturo Elias, a company
spokesman,  told  Mexico City’s Radio Formula yesterday. The
failure lasted almost six hours, Telcel said.  An outside representative for OHL didn’t immediately
respond to phone messages seeking a comment.  To contact the reporters on this story:
