Corporate bond issuers in Russia and
 Turkey  have insufficient cash cushions to weather a financial
crisis lasting through 2013, according to  Fitch Ratings .  Russian companies tracked by Fitch have $35 billion of
bonds and loans due annually and cash of 0.7 times that amount
by 2013. Turkish borrowers owe $2 billion to $3 billion a year
with 0.8 times cash cover, Fitch said in a report based on a
survey of issuers it rates in 10 European countries. The most
liquid issuers in the Netherlands would have cash cover of 6.7
times by 2013, Fitch said.  Emerging-market companies have less access to committed
bank financing, Fitch said in a report today. European banks,
which had in the past provided long-term funding, are cutting
emerging-market lending as they raise cash to meet losses on
sovereign debt.  “Compared to banks in the developed market, emerging-
market banks typically have less mature retail deposit bases
and have not been such long-term lenders,” Raymond Hill, head
of EMEA emerging markets at Fitch, said in an interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
