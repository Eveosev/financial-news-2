Caterpillar Inc. (CAT) , which is studying
where to build a factory in North America, is disappointed with
the Illinois legislature’s failure this week to pass a research
and development tax credit.  “The failure in Springfield to pass that R&D tax credit
and other provisions is a disappointment to us,”  Jim Dugan ,
spokesman for the Peoria, Illinois-based company, said in an
interview today. It’s an “example of what’s wrong in this
state,” he said.  Caterpillar, the world’s largest construction and mining-
equipment maker, is studying where to construct a factory for
small tractors and mini-hydraulic excavators. The company has
been courted by more than a dozen U.S. states, including
Illinois, along with Canada and  Mexico , about the factory, Dugan
said.  “The tax credit is not tied to the decision-making process
for the factory coming to North America,” said Dugan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
