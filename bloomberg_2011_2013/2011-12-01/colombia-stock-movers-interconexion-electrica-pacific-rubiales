The following companies had unusual
price changes in Bogota trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of 4 p.m. local time.  The  IGBC Index (IGBC)  was little changed at 12,924.52, while the
Colcap Index rose 0.9 percent to 1,575.56.  Interconexion Electrica SA (ISA)  ,  Latin America ’s
biggest power line operator known as ISA, rose 2.7 percent to
10,800 pesos.  The company sold 300 billion pesos ($154.1 million) of
inflation-linked bonds in Colombia, the stock exchange said in a
statement today. Investor demand for the securities totaled 777
billion pesos.  Pacific Rubiales Energy Corp. (PRE)  , the Toronto-based
oil producer that operates fields in Colombia, fell 1.8 percent
to 40,600 pesos.  Holders of the company’s convertible debentures converted
98.9 percent of the securities into 20.5 million ordinary shares
under a temporary incentive conversion rate increase that
expired Nov. 29, according to a regulatory filing. The temporary
incentive, which was aimed at reducing the company’s debt, may
be diluting the shares, said Juan David Pineros, an analyst at
Interbolsa SA.  To contact the reporter on this story:
