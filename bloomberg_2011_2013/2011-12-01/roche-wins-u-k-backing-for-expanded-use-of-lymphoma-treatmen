Roche Holding AG (ROG) ’s MabThera medicine
won the backing of the U.K.’s National Institute for Health and
Clinical Excellence in new draft guidance on the treatment of
people with advanced follicular lymphoma.  Research shows that adding the drug to a greater number of
chemotherapy regimens, including chlorambucil, helps patients
live longer and improves quality of life, the institute, known
as NICE, said in an e-mailed statement today.  NICE  advises the
state-run  National Health Service  on which therapies represent
value for money. The agency will publish final guidance on
MabThera next month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
