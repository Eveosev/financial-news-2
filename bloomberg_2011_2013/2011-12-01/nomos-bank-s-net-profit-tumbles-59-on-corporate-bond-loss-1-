Nomos Bank , a Russian lender whose
shares are trading in  London , said third-quarter profit fell 59
percent because of a trading loss on corporate bonds.  Net income dropped to 713 million rubles ($23 million) from
1.74 billion rubles in the year-earlier period, according to a
statement on the lender’s website today. Trading losses of 2.9
billion rubles were mostly attributable to a “negative
revaluation” of fixed-income securities caused by market
volatility, the bank said. Losses partially recovered by mid-
November, it added.  “The weakness was mainly the result of trading and forex
losses incurred by the investment banking segment,” Leonid Slipchenko, a banking analyst at UralSib Financial Corp., wrote
in a report e-mailed today.  Nomos’s shares in Moscow fell 0.1 percent to 615 rubles by
the close, erasing an earlier gain of as much as 5.6 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
