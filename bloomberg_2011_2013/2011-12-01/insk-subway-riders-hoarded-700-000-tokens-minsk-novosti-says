Subway commuters in Minsk, the
capital of Belarus, have hoarded more than half the total amount
of ride tokens in circulation, the Minsk-Novosti news agency
 said  citing Rostislav Yurenya, the subway director.  About 700,000 of the city’s 1.3 million subway tokens are
being retained, Yurenya said, according to the report. “This
situation became obvious in the end of October when the reserves
of tokens at subway ticket offices dried up.”  Transport fares were increased on Nov. 1, when the price of
a one-way trip on the Minsk subway rose 37 percent to 1,300
rubles (15 U.S. cents). As it would take at least four months to
coin an additional 500,000 tokens, paper tickets may be
introduced in the interim, Minsk-Novosti cited Yurenya as
saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
