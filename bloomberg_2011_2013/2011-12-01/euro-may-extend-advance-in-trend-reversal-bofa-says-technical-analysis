The euro may extend its advance
against the dollar after the 17-nation currency closed above
$1.3382, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch.  That level, about where the euro ended 2010, confirms a
“near-term base” and a turn in trend, targeting $1.3678-1.3653
and beyond, saidMacNeil Curry, head of foreign-exchange and
interest-rates technical strategy at the unit of Bank America
Corp. in  New York .  A daily close above $1.3678 would open up the euro to reach
$1.4248, a level last reached in October, Curry wrote in a
research note published today. Falling below $1.3382 would
indicate a false move, according to Curry.  The euro appreciated 0.1 percent to $1.3460 at 11:22 a.m.
New York time. It rallied 1 percent yesterday after central
banks led by the  Federal Reserve  made it cheaper for lenders to
borrow in dollars.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
