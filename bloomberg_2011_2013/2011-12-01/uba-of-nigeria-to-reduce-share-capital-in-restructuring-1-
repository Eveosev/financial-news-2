United Bank for Africa Plc (UBA) , a
Nigerian lender with operations in 19 countries, plans to reduce
its share capital to 6.5 billion naira ($40.3 million) from 16.2
billion naira in a restructuring.  The share capital will be increased subsequently to 16.2
billion naira by creating 19.4 billion new shares of 50 kobo
each, the Lagos-based lender said in a statement published today
in Nigerian Thisday newspaper.  Shareholders will vote on the plan at a meeting on Dec. 29,
it said.  UBA shares lost 1 percent to 2.53 naira by the 2:30 p.m.
close in Lagos. The stock has declined 66 percent this year,
compared with a 20 percent decline in the Nigerian Stock
Exchange  All-Share Index. (NGSEINDX)   To contact the reporter on this story:
