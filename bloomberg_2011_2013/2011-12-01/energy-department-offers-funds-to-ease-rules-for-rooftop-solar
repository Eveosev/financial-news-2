The U.S. Department of Energy will
distribute $12 million to local governments, universities and
others to help simplify rooftop solar regulations.  The money is intended to ease permitting for solar panels
installed on roofs by creating online systems and changing local
ordinances, Energy Secretary Steven Chu said today.  The program is intended to make it less costly for
homeowners and businesses to install solar panels, Chu said.
It’s part of the  SunShot Initiative , which aims to make the cost
of solar energy competitive with the cost of power from
traditional sources.  “Today we’re making it quicker, easier and cheaper for
Americans to go solar,” Chu said on a conference call with
reporters. The program will “break down the barriers that make
it more costly and cumbersome for families and businesses to
install rooftop solar systems.”  Local permitting and inspection requirements, which can
vary significantly in each municipality, add $2,500 to the cost
of a residential solar installation, according to a statement
today from the Energy Department which cited a study by solar
leasing company SunRun Inc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
