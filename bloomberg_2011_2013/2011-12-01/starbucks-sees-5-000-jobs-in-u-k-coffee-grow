Starbucks Corp. (SBUX) , the world’s largest
coffee-shop operator, plans to add 200 more drive-through stores
across the U.K. in an expansion that will create 5,000 jobs.  The new stores will be opened over the next five years,
said Starbucks, which already operates nine stores in the U.K.
where drivers can purchase drinks including “Frappuccino” iced
coffees and gingerbread lattes from their cars.  “Customers want the best coffee wherever they are, rather
than just as a high street treat,” the Seattle-based company
said today in a statement. The plan will establish Starbucks as
market leader in the U.K. drive-through coffee market, it said.  Starbucks gets more than 20 percent of sales from outside
the U.S. and has more than 6,000 international locations in
addition to 10,900 cafes in its home country. The coffee brewer
said earlier this year that it plans to more than triple its
store count in mainland  China  to 1,500 locations by 2015.  Starbucks, which last year opened 35 outlets at Welcome
Break roadside locations in the U.K., said gas-station owner
Euro Garages Ltd. will operate about half the new drive-through
stores under licence, many in central and northern  England .  The company, which has more than 700 U.K. outlets, said it
also plans to add more conventional stores in the country over
the next five years.  Starbucks said last month that fourth-quarter sales at
stores open at least 13 months rose 9 percent, with 10 percent
growth in the U.S. and 6 percent internationally.  To contact the reporter on this story:
