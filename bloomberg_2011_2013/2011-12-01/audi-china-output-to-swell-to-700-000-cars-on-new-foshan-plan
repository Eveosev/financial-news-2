Audi,  Volkswagen AG ’s luxury-car
unit, will increase capacity in  China  to as many as 700,000
vehicles a year, backed by a second assembly plant.  A new factory in Foshan, in the southern province of
Guangdong, will have a capacity to build about 150,000 to
200,000 cars from 2013, adding to output of a plant in Changchun
which will be raised to as many as 550,000 cars, Audi said today
in a statement. The Foshan plant is being built by VW and its
Chinese partner FAW Volkswagen Automotive Co.  “We want to clearly expand our presence in China and
further strengthen our strategic partnership” with FAW, Audi
Chief Executive Officer Rupert Stadler said. “The new factory
is a milestone in our long-term growth strategy in China.”  China has surpassed  Germany  as Audi’s biggest market this
year though the Ingolstadt, Germany-based carmaker’s share of
Chinese luxury-auto sales shrank in the first six months while
German rivals  Bayerische Motoren Werke AG  and  Daimler AG ’s
Mercdes-Benz boosted their portions, according to industry
researcher J.D. Power & Associates.  Audi said the factory in Foshan will employ about 4,000
workers and produce a “new member” of the A3 compact line, the
carmaker’s third-best selling model. The VW unit currently makes
extended versions of the A4 and A6, its two best-selling
vehicles, and the Q5 sport-utility vehicle in Changchun.  Audi, the luxury-market leader in China, increased sales of
cars and SUVs in the world’s biggest auto market by 32 percent
between January and October to 253,739 units. The carmaker aims
for record sales of more than 300,000 in the Asian country this
year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
