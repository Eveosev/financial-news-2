Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce ,
the country’s fifth-biggest bank, said quarterly profit rose 59
percent, led by  investment banking  and consumer lending.  Net income for the fourth-quarter ended Oct. 31 climbed to
C$794 million ($780 million), or C$1.89 a share, from C$500
million, or C$1.17, a year earlier, the Toronto-based bank said
today in a statement. Revenue fell 1.6 percent to C$3.2 billion.  CIBC is the first Canadian lender to report fourth-quarter
results. The Toronto-based bank’s profit was higher than a year
ago, when earnings were pared by C$239 million in capital
repatriation costs and losses in a structured credit business.  CIBC said it had adjusted earnings of C$1.87 a share,
topping the C$1.80 a share average estimate of 16 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg News.  Canada ’s eight-biggest banks will probably report average
profit growth of 12 percent from a year earlier, Scotia Capital
analyst Kevin Choquette said in a Nov. 18 note.  Toronto-Dominion
Bank (TD) , the country’s second-largest lender, also reports today.  “The Canadian banks continue to do pretty much the right
stuff,” David Baskin, president of Baskin Financial Services in
Toronto, which oversees about C$400 million including bank
shares, said in an interview before earnings. “Everybody should
be buying them, they’re really cheap.”  Canadian Imperial rose 4.4 percent yesterday to C$72.91 in
Toronto trading. The stock has fallen 6.9 percent this year,
compared with the 5.4 percent decline of the eight-company
S&P/TSX Commercial Banks Index.  Loan Provisions  Canadian Imperial said it set aside C$243 million for bad
loans, up from C$150 million a year earlier.  The CIBC World Markets investment-banking business earned
C$172 million, compared with a loss of C$56 million a year ago
when the unit posted losses from structured credit trading and
corporate loan hedges.  Canadian  consumer lending  and business banking profit rose
15 percent to C$580 million, from C$505 million in the year-
earlier period.  Wealth management  profit, which includes mutual fund sales,
rose 20 percent to C$65 million after adding earnings from its
purchase of a 41 percent stake in American Century Investments
from JPMorgan Chase & Co. in August.  “CIBC has lacked a real strategic growth focus and I think
that wealth management is an area where they might be able to
excel,”  Craig Fehr , an analyst with Edward Jones & Co., said in
an interview before earnings. “American Century, while not a
cannonball by any stretch, is at least a seed of growth for them
in a compelling area.”  Its corporate unit, which includes Caribbean banking, had a
C$23 million loss, compared with a C$3 million loss a year
earlier, the bank said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
