Arco Vara AS (ARC1T) , the only listed Baltic
property developer, said its third-quarter loss widened as
rising input costs cut profitability at its construction unit.  The net loss increased to 1.7 million euros ($2.3 million)
from 133,000 euros a year earlier, the company said in a
regulatory statement yesterday.  Revenue rose 34 percent to 7.8 million euros. The
construction unit had a loss of 1.4 million euros after an
operating profit of 50,000 euros a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
