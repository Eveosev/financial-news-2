TCW Group Inc., the Los Angeles-based
investment unit of  Societe Generale  SA, opened TCW Global Bond
Fund, its first mutual fund to buy U.S. and international fixed-
income securities.  The fund will invest in government and corporate debt
“across all major currencies and regions of the world,” the
company said today in a statement. Chief Investment Officer  Tad
Rivelle , along with Stephen Kane and David Robbins, will co-
manage the fund.  Societe Generale, France’s second-largest bank, is
considering the sale of TCW, possibly through a management-led
buyout, two people familiar with the situation have said. TCW’s
mutual-fund assets have increased almost 30 percent this year
and more than tripled in less than two years to $33 billion,
according to company.  TCW, which saw the defection of star manager  Jeffrey
Gundlach  in December 2009, has about $118 billion in assets
under management, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
