The city of Koblenz is preparing to
move 45,000 people from their homes on Dec. 4 in the biggest
evacuation undertaken in  Germany  to disarm a World War II bomb,
Deutsche Presse Agentur reported, citing a spokesman for the
German Red Cross.  The town, situated on the River Rhine, began transporting
the first patients from hospitals yesterday, DPA said. About
2,500 rescue and security forces will be on hand to manage the
evacuation as authorities prepare to deactivate the 1.8-ton bomb
discovered in the Rhine, the news service said.  The forces have begun constructing a provisional dam to
drain the water around the bomb as well as a smaller U.S. device
and a smoke bomb, DPA said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
