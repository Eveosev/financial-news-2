OAO Surgutneftegas, a Russian oil
producer, sold Urals crude to Total SA and Talmay Trading for
loading from the Baltic Sea port of Primorsk this month, two
traders who participate in the market said.  Surgutneftegas issued a tender this week to sell 300,000
metric tons of Urals, with shipments due to load on Dec. 11-12,
Dec. 14-15 and Dec. 15-16. Total and Talmay were jointly awarded
the first cargo, while the remaining two were sold to Talmay,
said the traders, who declined to be identified because they
arenâ€™t authorized to speak on the matter.  To contact the reporters on this story:
