Spanish billionaire Enrique Banuelos’s Veremonte Participacoes SA failed to reach an accord
with its partners in Brazilian grain producer  Vanguarda Agro SA 
on how the joint venture will pay $600 million of debt, Valor
Economico said.  Otaviano Pivetta, Vanguarda’s largest shareholder, rejected
Veremonte’s proposal to sell farmland owned by Vanguarda to
raise about 400 million reais ($221 million) for debt payments,
the Sao Paulo-based newspaper said, citing Veremonte Chief
Executive Officer Marcelo Paracchini.  Pivetta rejected the proposal because it would dilute his
holdings in Vanguarda, Valor said, citing Pivetta in an
interview. Pivetta holds about 27 percent of Vanguarda and
Veremonte owns 22 percent, Valor said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
