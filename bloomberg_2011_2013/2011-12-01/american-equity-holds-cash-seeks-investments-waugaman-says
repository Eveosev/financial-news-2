American Equity Investment Life
Holding Co., the insurer that acquired municipal and corporate
debt this year, is keeping cash longer as it searches for
investments.  “We were holding several hundred million dollars average
cash balances” in the third quarter, Chief Executive Officer
Wendy Waugaman said yesterday in an interview at Bloomberg’s  New
York  headquarters. “That’s an expensive decision because when
we’re holding those assets in cash clearly we aren’t earning the
yield that we need to be able to operate our business.”  American Equity reported at least $572 million in cash
every quarter during 2011, according to filings. Investments in
corporate debt increased from $7.1 billion at the end of 2010 to
$8.8 billion on Sept. 30, a  filing (AEL)  shows. The  West Des Moines ,
Iowa-based company boosted municipal-bond holdings 17 percent to
$2.8 billion in the same period.  “We had held agency bonds and they represented a very
large percentage of our portfolio for a long time,” Waugaman
said. “Opportunities don’t exist anymore in the agency market,
or only on a limited basis, and so we’ve turned our focus
instead to principally high-grade corporates.”  American Equity rose 6.4 percent to $11.06 yesterday in New
York. It has fallen 12 percent this year compared with a 5.9
percent decline of the  Russell 2000 Index. (RTY)   To contact the reporter on this story:
