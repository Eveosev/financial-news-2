Coal prices in  China  may rise 5
percent in 2012 and 2013 and imports may increase 15 percent a
year because of supply tightness, “strong” industrial demand
and reliance on thermal power, according to UOB-Kay Hian Ltd.  Imports of coal for power stations and steelmakers may
climb to 300 million metric tons in 2015 from an estimated 165
million this year, said  Helen Lau , a Hong Kong-based analyst at
UOB-Kay Hian, in a report e-mailed today. China’s thermal power
generation rose more than 15 percent in the first 10 months of
this year, outpacing a 12 percent increase in electricity
consumption and countering an 8 percent decline in hydropower
output, she said.  “Barring possible short-term weakness in 4Q11 and 1Q12,
strong demand and supply tightness should continue to support
coal price uptrend in 2012,” Lau said in the report.  China, the world’s biggest user and producer of coal, will
cap spot prices of the power-station fuel and limit increases in
contract prices next year, the National Development and Reform
Commission, the nation’s top economic planner, said yesterday.
The NDRC also increased electricity tariffs for the first time
in six months, effective today. Thermal power generation
accounted for about 82 percent of China’s electricity output
this year, according to Lau.  Total coal imports in 2011 will be similar to last year’s
level at about 165 million tons, Lau said. Demand in the first
quarter of 2012 “should remain resilient” because of the
widening gap between domestic and international prices, she
said.  Coal Prices  Benchmark  prices  of coal with a heating value of 5,500
kilocalories per kilogram at Qinhuangdao, China’s largest port
for the fuel, rose to as much as 860 yuan ($135) a ton on Oct.
23, the highest level since 2008, as utilities built up stocks
to meet winter demand, according to the China Coal Transport and
Distribution Association. The price was at 840 yuan to 850 yuan
on Nov. 27.  Coal with a heating value of 6,700 kilocalories per
kilogram at  Australia ’s Newcastle port, an Asian benchmark
grade, were at $110.85 a ton on Nov. 25.  China’s imports of thermal and coking coal fell 18 percent
in October from a month earlier to 15.7 million tons, according
to customs data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
