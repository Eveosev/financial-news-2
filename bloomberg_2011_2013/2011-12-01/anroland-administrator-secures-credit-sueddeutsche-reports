The administrator of  Manroland AG ,
the German printing-press maker that filed for insolvency last
week, secured verbal agreements from creditor banks for a 10
million-euro credit,  Sueddeutsche Zeitung  reported.  The funds provided by the 15 creditors will keep Manroland
afloat while insolvency administrator Werner Schneider finds
buyers for the assets, the newspaper said, citing unidentified
company officials. The agreement could be completed by tomorrow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
