European Union Financial Services
Commissioner  Michel Barnier  said his proposal for a tax on
financial transactions is “economically bearable” and a small
price for banks to pay given the government support they have
received.  The plans for the so-called  Tobin tax  are “technically easy
to implement, economically bearable, financially productive and
politically just,” he said today in Valletta, Malta, where he
met with Finance Minister Tonio Fenech. Malta, like the U.K.,
opposes the tax because the government believes it would put the
country’s growing financial services at a competitive
disadvantage.  The financial industry should be prepared to “give back”
something to  Europe , after so much had been done to protect
financial services companies, Barnier said.  He also defended the euro and rejected what he called “a
catastrophic and fatalistic” view of the euro-region crisis. The
euro was a solid currency and not at risk, he said.  “It is a question of determination to implement what heads
of government agreed upon in October, and each country must work
at home to manage its budget properly and reduce sovereign
debt,” Barnier said. “One for all and all for one” should be the
philosophy of every EU and euro-zone member state, Barnier said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
