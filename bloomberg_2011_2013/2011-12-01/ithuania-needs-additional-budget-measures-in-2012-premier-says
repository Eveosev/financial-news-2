Lithuania needs additional budget
measures of 800 million litai ($312 million) in 2012 to keep the
deficit within the government’s target of 2.8 percent of gross
domestic product, Prime Minister Andrius Kubilius said.  International markets may “punish” Lithuania if the
government fails to agree on additional budget measures, the
prime minister said in a radio interview with  Ziniu Radijas 
today.  The Finance Ministry yesterday cut its 2012 economic growth
forecast to 2.5 percent from a previous estimate of 4.7 percent,
which will force the government to look for additional austerity
measures such as tax increases or spending cuts next year.
Finance Minister  Ingrida Simonyte  said yesterday she saw no
other “realistic alternatives” to an increase of the valued-
added tax by 2 percentage points to 23 percent to plug the gap.  To contact the reporter on this story:
