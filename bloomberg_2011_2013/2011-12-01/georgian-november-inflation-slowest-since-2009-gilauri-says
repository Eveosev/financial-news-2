Georgia â€™s inflation rate was the
lowest since 2009 in November, said Prime Minister Nika Gilauri.  Consumer prices advanced 1.9 percent in November from the
previous year, compared with 2.3 percent in October, Gilauri
said at the government session in the capital Tbilisi today.  Foreign investment reached $256 million in the third
quarter, he said.  Inflation, which peaked at 14.3 percent in May, will
continue to slow this month, Zaza Chelidze, head of the
Statistics Office, said this month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
