Barclays Plc (BARC) ’s wealth management unit
plans to increase its banking staff in  Asia  by about 50 percent
by the end of next year as it targets the growing population of
millionaires in the region.  “In our wealth management business, Asia’s growing the
fastest and should continue to grow the fastest,” Thomas Kalaris, chief executive officer of Barclays Wealth, told
reporters in  Hong Kong  today. “It’s the fastest growing region
for any private bank in the world.”  The London-based unit, which has now more than 100 bankers
in Hong Kong, Singapore and India, also aims to increase revenue
in Asia by more than 30 percent annually in the next three
years, Kalaris said.  Barclays Wealth and rivals including  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) 
are competing to hire bankers in Asia, where over the next five
years, wealth outside Japan may rise almost twice as fast as the
global rate of almost 6 percent, the Boston Consulting Group
predicted in May. Asia-Pacific millionaires outnumbered those in
Europe for the first time last year, according to a survey by
CapGemini SA and Bank of America Corp.  JPMorgan, based in New York, is hiring 100 advisers to
wealthy Asians this year and next, adding to the 140 employed at
the end of 2010, Andrew Cohen, the Hong Kong-based head of
private banking for ultra-high net worth individuals in Asia,
said in June.  Barclays Wealth seeks to hire senior bankers who have at
least 10 years of experience offering private banking services
in the region, particularly in China,  India  and Indonesia, where
the bank is putting the most resources, Kalaris said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
