Samson Tu, who helps oversee $1.6
billion of fixed-income securities as a  fund manager  at Uni-
President Assets Management Corp. in Taipei, comments on
 Taiwan ’s bond market in a phone interview today.  “Some people are now thinking Taiwan’s central bank may
follow  China  in easing monetary policy. Keeping borrowing costs
stable is Governor Perng Fain-nan’s style and I don’t think
Taiwan will lower rates until the end of June 2012. The  amount 
of outstanding central bank bills is still very high. The
government will continue to use open-market operations to
control liquidity in the financial system.”  The yield on the 1.25 percent securities due September 2021
gained one basis point to 1.325 percent as of 11:38 a.m. local
time, prices from Gretai Securities Market show. The yield on
the 2 percent bonds due July 2016 fell one basis point to 1.026
percent.  “ Government bonds  will remain stable and movements are
still highly correlated to the performance of stocks. During
this time there’s not much money to be made out of government
bonds. Bank debt is getting more attention, and investors are
demanding lower yields. Issuers with good credit ratings, such
as Taiwan Power Co., are seeing more demand.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
