Societe Generale  SA maintained a
“buy” recommendation on  OAO Sberbank , Russia’s biggest lender,
while cutting its price target because of a change in
methodology, analyst Alan Webborn said in a report today.  Societe Generale lowered the price target on the stock to
165 rubles from 167 rubles.  “Sberbank is immensely strong,” Webborn said by phone
from  London . “On the national scale, the only competition is
VTB. You got too many small banks in Russia and Sberbank is
massively dominant in that market.”  Sberbank rose 0.2 percent on the Micex to 87.71 rubles.
 American depositary receipts  of the bank fell 3.3 percent to
$11.46 in New York. The Moscow-based bank reported profit that
exceeded analysts’ estimates and raised its forecast for the
year yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
