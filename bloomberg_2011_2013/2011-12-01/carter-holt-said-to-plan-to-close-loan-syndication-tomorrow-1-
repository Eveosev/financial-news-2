Carter Holt Harvey Ltd .,  New Zealand 
billionaire Graeme Hartâ€™s wood-products firm, plans to close
syndication for its NZ$1.45 billion ($1.13 billion) loan
tomorrow, according to a person familiar with the matter.  The company expects another two banks to join the group for
the five-year facility, which was fully underwritten by 10
lenders earlier this year, the person said, asking not to be
identified as the details are private.  Credit Suisse Group AG, hired to arrange the loan in
August, was joined by  Australia  & New Zealand Banking Group
Ltd., Bank of New Zealand, Bank of Scotland Plc,  Commonwealth
Bank of Australia , HSBC Holdings Plc, Rabobank International,
National Australia Bank Ltd., Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp. and
Westpac Banking Corp., with each committing about NZ$150
million.  All the banks plan to sell about NZ$25 million of their so-
called hold to other lenders in general syndication, another
person familiar with the matter said on Nov. 4. The final group
will be larger than 12, the person said today.  The facility, which can be drawn in either U.S., New
Zealand or Australian dollars, comprises a NZ$1.35 billion
equivalent term portion and a NZ$100 million equivalent
revolving credit facility. The  term loan  is split again between
a bullet loan worth NZ$945 million, and an amortizing loan worth
NZ$405 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
