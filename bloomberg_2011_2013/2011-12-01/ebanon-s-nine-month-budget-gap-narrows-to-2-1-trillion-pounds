Lebanon’s budget deficit narrowed in
the first nine months of the year because of increased revenue
from a telecommunications tariff.  The deficit narrowed to 2.1 trillion Lebanese pounds ($1.39
billion) from 3 trillion pounds a year earlier, the Ministry of
Finance said today in an e-mailed statement from  Beirut .  The ministry included estimated revenue of 1.6 trillion
pounds from the Telecommunications Ministry in its calculations,
up from 331 billion pounds in the first nine months of 2010. The
funds haven’t yet been transferred to the Treasury.  To contact the reporter on this story:
