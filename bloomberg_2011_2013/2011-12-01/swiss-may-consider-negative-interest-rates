Switzerland ’s government said it may
consider additional measures including negative  interest rates 
to aid the country’s central bank in its fight against the
appreciation of the Swiss franc.  The government is willing to “examine the feasibility of
supporting measures within the context of an overall
consideration,” it said yesterday in response to a
parliamentary inquiry by Green Party member Louis Schelbert.
Part of the supporting measures would be the introduction of
negative interest rates, it said.  The franc fell the most in almost a week against the euro
today after publication of the government’s comments. Finance
Minister Eveline Widmer-Schlumpf said in August that the
government would support “any” measure deemed appropriate by
the  Swiss National Bank  to counter gains in the franc. The
central bank introduced a cap on the franc in September.  The currency traded at 1.23281 per euro as of 5:22 p.m.
today in  New York . The franc had earlier fallen as much as 0.7
percent, the most since Nov. 25, before erasing some losses.  The most effective tools to fight excessive exchange rate
fluctuations remain in the areas of foreign exchange and
monetary policy that are the Swiss National Bank’s
responsibility, the government said in its statement yesterday.  Widmer-Schlumpf told Reuters in an interview in October
that “at the moment,  capital controls  and negative interest
rates are not a topic but they are being examined. One needs to
get ready for certain steps, hoping one will never have to take
them,” she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
