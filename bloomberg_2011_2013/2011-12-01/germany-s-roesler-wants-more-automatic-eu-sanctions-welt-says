German Economy Minister Philipp Roesler has drafted a proposal to increase fiscal discipline in
the European Union including more automatic sanctions against
deficit offenders,  Die Welt  newspaper reported.  The proposal would require EU treaty changes in four areas,
the newspaper said, citing a copy of the draft it obtained.
Roesler also wants to limit budget deficits to 2 percent of
gross domestic product, compared with 3 percent of GDP under
current rules, the Berlin-based newspaper said.  A stability group of independent experts should make
recommendations on ways to improve competitiveness in EU states
and monitor national budget plans, the newspaper cited the
proposal, which has been sent to the Chancellery, as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
