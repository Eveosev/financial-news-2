Donovan McNabb  was released today by
the  Minnesota Vikings , six weeks after the former Pro Bowl
quarterback was demoted to a backup role.  McNabb, 35, was traded to the Vikings on July 30 from the
Washington Redskins to be the National Football League teamâ€™s
starter. He was benched in October by Vikings coach  Leslie Frazier  in favor of rookie Christian Ponder.  The release of the six-time Pro Bowl pick and 2004  Super
Bowl  starter was announced as a one-line roster move from the
Vikings, listing his name, position, years of NFL experience (13)
and college (Syracuse).  McNabb may sign with another team. The Chicago Bears,
Kansas City Chiefs and Houston Texans are among clubs that have
lost starting quarterbacks to injuries in recent weeks.  The Vikings fell to 2-9 this season and into last place in
the National Football Conference North division with a 24-14
loss to Atlanta on Nov. 28. In six games with the Vikings,
McNabb completed 94 of 156 passes for 1,026 yards. He threw four
touchdowns passes and two interceptions, and ran for another
score.  McNabb was selected by the  Philadelphia Eagles  with the
second pick in the 1999 draft. In 11 years with the Eagles, he
was 92-49-1 as a starter, leading the team to the playoffs eight
times and the Super Bowl after the 2004 season. Last season with
the Redskins, he was 5-8 in 13 starts before being benched for
the final three games.  To contact the reporter on this story:
