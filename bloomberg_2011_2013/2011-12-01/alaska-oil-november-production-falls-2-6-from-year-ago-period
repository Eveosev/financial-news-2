Alaskan crude-oil production fell 2.6
percent in November from a year earlier, according to the  Alaska
Tax Division .  Production in November averaged 624,687 barrels a day, a
decrease from 641,463 a year earlier and an increase from
598,929 in the previous month.  Alaska production has declined every year since 2002, U.S.
Energy Department figures show, as falling output from existing
wells hasn’t been matched by new additions. The bulk of the
state’s oil is produced in the Prudhoe Bay area.  Oil inventories in the state averaged 3.56 million barrels
for the month, ranging from 1.84 million on Nov. 12 to 5.21
million on Nov. 18.  Alaskan oil is shipped along the 800-mile (1,290-kilometer)
Trans Alaska pipeline from Prudhoe Bay on the North Slope to
Valdez, the northernmost ice-free port in the U.S.  To contact the reporter on this story:
