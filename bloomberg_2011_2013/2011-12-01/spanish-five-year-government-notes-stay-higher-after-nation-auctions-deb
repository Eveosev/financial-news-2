Spanish five-year notes stayed higher
after the nation sold the maximum amount of bonds available at a
debt auction today.  The yield on five-year notes fell 15 basis points to 5.71
percent at 9:50 a.m. London time. That’s the  lowest rate  since
Nov. 16.  Spain  sold 3.75 billion euros of bonds at an auction, the
Bank of Spain said, meeting the Treasury’s maximum target.  To contact the reporter on this story:
