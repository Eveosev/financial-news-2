Nordea Bank AB cut its forecast for
economic growth in  Sweden  and in Norway next year and predicted
central banks in the Nordic nations will slash  interest rates  as
the debt crisis in Europe weighs on output and exports.  Scandinavia’s largest economy will stagnate in 2012 after
expanding 4.5 percent this year, the Stockholm-based bank said
in a  report  today. Nordea had forecast a 0.8 percent Swedish
expansion. The  Riksbank will cut its benchmark rate  to 0.75
percent by the second half of next year from the current 2
percent, the bank said.  Expansion in Norway’s mainland economy, which excludes oil,
gas, and shipping, will slow to 2.1 percent from 2.5 percent
this year on lower consumption and investments, Nordea said. It
had previously expected the economy to grow 2.5 percent next
year. Norges Bank will cut  its benchmark  by 0.5 percentage point
this month and by 0.25 percentage point in March, from the
current 2.25 percent, the largest Nordic lender estimates.  “The European debt crisis will affect  Norway  through
several channels,” Nordea’s Oslo-based economists wrote in a
report. “Developments in key export markets will be weaker.”  Norwegian exports will grow 0.2 percent next year while
exports from Sweden, home to Ericsson AB, the world’s largest
maker of wireless networks, will rise 0.3 percent.  Sweden’s krona lost 0.4 percent against the euro to 9.1300
by 12:19 a.m., while the Norwegian krone weakened 0.3 percent to
7.7845.  The failure of European leaders to end the debt crisis in
the euro area is sapping growth in both Nordic nations, which
rely on sales to the region for more than half of their exports.
A slump in Nordic manufacturing deepened last month as Norwegian
industry contracted for the first time since March last year and
Sweden shrank at the fastest pace in 30 months, purchasing
managers’ surveys showed today.  Unemployment in both countries will rise, Nordea said.
Sweden’s jobless rate will rise to 8 percent next year from 7.5
percent this year, while Norway’s unemployment rate will 3.6
percent in 2012 from 3.3 percent in 2011, the bank forecast.  Riksbank Governor Stefan Ingves said last month the bank is
ready to do what’s necessary to ensure stability as Sweden’s
economy is “highly affected” by the turmoil in  Europe . Norges
Bank Governor Oeystein Olsen said he is ready to cut the
benchmark if global growth prospects worsen. Both central banks
shelved planned rate increases this year because of Europe’s
debt crisis and its implications on global growth.  In 2013, the Swedish and Norwegian economies will grow 1.5
percent and 2.9 percent, respectively, Nordea forecasts.  Riksbank policy makers will announce their next decision on
Dec. 20, while Norges Bank policy makers meet on Dec. 14.
