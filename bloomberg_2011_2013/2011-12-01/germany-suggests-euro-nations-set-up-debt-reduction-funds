Germany  proposed that each euro-area
country set up a national fund to pay down its debt as a
possible way to boost market confidence in the joint currency.  “That way, it would be verifiable year by year that member
countries of the euro zone actually reduce their debt to 60
percent of gross domestic product over a span of 20 years,”
Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  told reporters in Berlin
today. Channeling government revenue into such a “special
fund” would be “confidence-building” amid the debt crisis.  Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s government is considering
presenting the proposal to its euro-area partners at the Dec. 9
meeting of European leaders in Brussels, Schaeuble said.  Euro-area rules set a debt limit of 60 percent of GDP for
member countries.  To contact the reporter on this story:
