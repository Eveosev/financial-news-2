The cost of insuring Japanese
corporate bonds against non-payment declined, according to
credit-default swap traders.  The Markit iTraxx  Japan  index dropped 10 basis points to
195 basis points as of 9:10 a.m. in  Tokyo , Deutsche Bank AG
prices show. Thatâ€™s on course for its biggest daily decline
since Oct. 28, according to data provider CMA, which is owned by
CME Group Inc., and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the
privately negotiated market.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index rose 3 basis points in
the Asian trading hours to 197 as of 12:10 p.m. in Sydney,
according to Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc. The Australian
benchmark declined 17 basis points to 194.5 yesterday, CMA
prices in  New York  show.  The  Markit iTraxx Asia  index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan increased 2 basis points in the Asian
trading hours to 208 as of 9:10 a.m. in  Singapore , RBS prices
show. The Asian gauge fell 16.5 basis points to 207 yesterday,
according to CMA prices in New York.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default, and traders use them to speculate on
credit quality. A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
