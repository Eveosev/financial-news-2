Dutch manufacturing output fell in
November at the quickest rate since May 2009 while orders
dropped the most in two and a half years.  The measure of manufacturing in the fifth-largest economy
in the euro region slipped to 46 from 48 in October when
adjusted for seasonal swings, the Zoetermeer-based Dutch
institute for purchasing and supply management  NEVI  said on its
website today. In September, it dropped below the 50 mark for
the first time since July 2009, indicating a contraction.  The Dutch economy may shrink in the second half of the year
as a result of decelerating world trade, fiscal consolidation
and subdued household income growth, the Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development said on Nov. 28.  The index is based on a survey of about 350 purchasing
managers by Markit Economics.  To contact the reporter on this story:
