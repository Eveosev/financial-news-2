Croatia â€™s Alliance for Change, a
four-party group led by the  Social Democrats , are leading before
Dec. 4 elections as Croats appear ready to reject the ruling
party amid a corruption probe and the weak economy.  The opposition coalition has 42 percent support, while the
ruling  Croatian Democratic Union  had 23 percent, according to
the  IPSOS Puls  survey of 4,171 people released today by  Vecernji
List  newspaper and  Nova TV . No margin of error was listed.  Based on the poll result, the Alliance would win 79 seats
for a majority in the 153-seat  Parliament , according to
allocation methodology. The  Croatian Democratic Union  and its
coalition partners would get 46 seats.  To contact the reporter responsible for the story: Jasmina
