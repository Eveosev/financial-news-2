PKN Orlen SA, Poland’s largest oil
refiner and retailer, will next year import 7 to 8 percent of
the natural gas it uses from  Germany  via an expanded link, the
company said.  Orlen, which is also Poland’s largest gas consumer, will
buy 90 million cubic meters of gas from RWE Supply & Trading
GmbH, a unit of  Germany’s largest energy producer (RWE) , and Polish
gas trader Entrade Grupa Sp z o.o., the Plock-based company said
in an e-mail. The contracts can be extended, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
