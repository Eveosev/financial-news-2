Mexico ’s peso bonds declined as a
pickup in U.S. manufacturing fueled speculation the Latin
American country’s exports will rise, sparking growth and
limiting the room that policy makers have to cut  interest rates .  The yield on peso-denominated bonds due in 2013 rose two
basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 4.68 percent at 1:51
p.m. in Mexico City. The price on the securities fell 0.07
centavo to 106.48 centavos per peso. The yield on benchmark note
due in 2024 rose six basis points to 6.54 percent.  The  Institute for Supply Management ’s U.S. factory index
increased to 52.7 in November, the highest in five months, the
Tempe, Arizona-based group said today. The U.S. is the
destination for about 80 percent of Mexico’s exports.  “U.S. data has been surprising on the upside, and so has
Mexico,”  Eduardo Suarez , a  Latin America  currency strategist at
Scotia Capital Inc., said in a telephone interview.  Mexico’s central bank is scheduled to make an announcement
on rates tomorrow after concluding a policy meeting. Twenty-one
of 22 economists surveyed by Bloomberg predict the bank will
hold the rate at a record low 4.5 percent.  Latin America’s second-biggest economy expanded 4.5
percent in the third quarter from a year earlier, topping the
median estimate of 3.9 percent from 16 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg. The  unemployment rate  fell to a four-month-low of 5
percent in October, while consumer prices rose 0.97 percent in
the first half of November, more than the 0.74 percent increase
predicted by 16 economists in a Bloomberg survey.  Dollar Auctions  The peso was little changed, gaining 0.1 percent to 13.6070
per dollar, from 13.6251 yesterday. It’s surged 4.6 percent this
week. Mexico’s currency-exchange commission said Nov. 29 that
the central bank will auction $400 million daily at a peso
 exchange rate  at least 2 percent weaker than the previous day’s
level, providing support for the currency when it tumbles.  Policy makers dusted off a mechanism they last used 19
months ago to stem declines in the peso following the collapse
of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. The peso’s rally this week
trimmed its decline in 2011 to 9.2 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
