Greece’s Prime Minister  Lucas Papademos  sent a letter to European Union officials and the
 International Monetary Fund  pledging the government’s
commitment to economic and financial changes, including a debt
swap.  “The government is determined to continue the process of
fiscal consolidation and structural reform in order to secure
sound public finances and improve the country’s international
competitiveness,” Papademos wrote, according to a copy of the
letter e-mailed from his Athens office late yesterday.  The letter was addressed to EU President Herman van Rompuy,
European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso, Luxembourg
Prime Minister and head of euro-area finance ministers Jean- Claude Juncker, European Central Bank President Mario Draghi and
IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde.  Papademos said participation in the euro area “ensures the
preservation of  price stability , promotes financial and economic
stability and facilitates the implementation of the deep and
broad reforms required for the revival of the economy.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
