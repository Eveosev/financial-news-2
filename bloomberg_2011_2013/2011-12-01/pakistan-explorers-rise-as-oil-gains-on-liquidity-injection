Pakistan’s energy explorers led by
 Oil & Gas Development Co. (OGDC)  were poised for their biggest gain in
a week as steps taken by central banks to ease the European debt
crisis boosted oil for a fifth day.  OGDC, Pakistan’s biggest explorer, climbed 1.2 percent to
155 rupees as of 1:13 p.m., the most since Nov. 24.  Pakistan
Petroleum Ltd. (PPL) , the second-biggest explorer, gained 0.7 percent
while  Pakistan Oilfields Ltd. (POL)  rose 0.4 percent.  The U.S. Federal Reserve, the  European Central Bank  and the
central banks of Canada, Switzerland, Japan and the U.K.
yesterday cut the cost of borrowing dollars for emergency
funding by European banks. Oil futures climbed as much as 0.5
percent after gaining 0.6 percent yesterday to cap a second
monthly increase, countering speculation that a bigger-than-
expected rise in U.S. crude supplies signals weakening demand.  “The stocks are responding to the liquidity injection by
the six central banks,” said Burhan Moosa, a trader at IGI
Finex Securities Ltd.  U.S. oil supplies rose by 3.9 million barrels last week,
compared with a forecast for a 50,000 barrel increase in a
Bloomberg News survey.  Crude for January delivery rose as much as 54 cents to
$100.90 a barrel and was at $100.81 in electronic trading on the
New York Mercantile at 3:49 p.m. Singapore time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
