Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD) , Canada’s
second-largest lender, said profit increased for the fourth
straight quarter as consumer banking earnings climbed in Canada
and the U.S.  Net income for the fourth-quarter ended Oct. 31 rose 58
percent to C$1.57 billion ($1.54 billion), or C$1.69 a share,
from C$994 million, or C$1.07, a year earlier, the Toronto-based
bank said today in a statement.  Toronto-Dominion said consumer banking profit in Canada
climbed 17 percent, and 19 percent in the U.S.  “They continue to execute on that growth strategy that
they’ve put in place,” said  Craig Fehr , an analyst at Edward
Jones & Co. in  St. Louis . “We’ve seen them really branch out in
more recent quarters into other areas outside of just the in-
branch banking. So now they’re into auto lending in a really big
way.”  Excluding one-time items, Toronto-Dominion earned C$1.77 a
share. That exceeded the C$1.54-a-share average estimate of 15
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News.  Toronto-Dominion rose 5.6 percent to C$73.50 in trading
yesterday on the Toronto Stock Exchange. The shares have fallen
1 percent this year.  (Toronto-Dominion will hold a conference call at 3 p.m. Toronto
