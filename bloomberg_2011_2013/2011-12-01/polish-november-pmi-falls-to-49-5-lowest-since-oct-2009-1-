Polish manufacturing measured in the
 Markit Economics  survey dropped below 50, the lowest level in 25
months, indicating a contraction, HSBC Holdings Plc reported.  The purchasing managers’ index, a gauge of manufacturing,
fell to 49.5 from 51.7 in the previous month, HSBC Holdings said
in an e-mailed statement summarizing the results of a survey by
Markit Economics. The median estimate of 16 economists in a
Bloomberg survey was for 50.7. A reading above 50 indicates
expansion.  “The data, with the PMI back in contraction territory for
the first time since October 2009, is very important and a
reminder that Poland will not stay isolated from the European
growth slowdown,” Agata Urbanska, an economist on Central and
Eastern Europe at HSBC, said in an e-mailed comment.  Poland ’s economy grew 4.2 percent in the third quarter from
the year before, faster than economists forecast, boosting the
probability that full-year growth will be more than 3.9 percent
last year, Deputy Finance Minister  Ludwik Kotecki  said in an e-
mail note yesterday.  He also said the economic outlook for the next year appears
“less favorable, mainly due to an evident deterioration in
conditions on Poland’s main export markets.”  In the Markit survey, new export orders fell for the sixth
month in a row, the level of outstanding business also fell and
the volume of inputs ordered fell at the fastest pace since July
2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
