India ’s coal production fell by 9
percent in October from a year earlier and the country may miss
output targets for a second year,  India Coal Market Watch  said,
without saying where it got the information.  Output totaled 39.59 million metric tons in October from
43.51 million a year earlier and a state-set target of 47.1
million, the coal newsletter said. Production rose 33.5 percent
from September when rains disrupted output.  Production during the first seven months of the year ending
March 2012 was about 11 percent lower than a state-set target of
259.37 million tons, and 5.5 percent lower than a year earlier,
according to the note. The target for the 2012 fiscal year is
554 million tons. Last year, India’s coal production was 533
million tons compared with a targeted 573 million, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
