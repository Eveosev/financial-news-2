Cocoa exports from  Cameroon ,  Africa ’s
fourth largest producer of the crop, declined 19 percent in
October, the third month of the new season, according to the
country’s Cocoa and Coffee Board and the Cocoa and Coffee Inter-
profession Council.  Exports for the period fell to 27,524 metric tons from
33,930 tons during the same period a year earlier, the two
institutions said in a report e-mailed from the port city of
Douala today.  The country has exported 64,937 tons of cocoa since the
season started compared with 71,702 tons the previous year,
according to the report. The season in the West African nation
