The lira may weaken to 1.95 per
dollar in three months,  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  said, revising
its forecast from a previous 1.90 per dollar due to “the
deterioration in the outlook for  Europe .”  The lira is expected to decline to 1.90 per dollar in six
months compared with a previous estimate of 1.70, Goldman said
in an e-mailed report today. The forecast for the lira in 12
months time was changed to 1.75 from 1.65, it said.  The currency fell 0.2 percent to 1.8328 per dollar at 9:43
a.m. in Istanbul.  To contact the reporter on this story:
