Cie. Financiere Richemont SA (CFR) , the
parent of Cartier jewelery and Jaeger-LeCoultre timepieces,
plans to spend 70 million euros ($94 million) to open the
worldâ€™s biggest luxury watch store in central Paris, La Tribune
reported without naming its sources.  Richemont is prepared to pay as much as 15 million euros to
facilitate the departure of Old England, an apparel and
accessories shop near the Printemps and Galeries Lafayette
department stores, and take over the space, the newspaper said.  The goal is to lure Chinese tourists who now spend more
than 600 million euros annually in  France , including at Galeries
Lafayette and Printemps, according to La Tribune.  To contact the reporter on this story:
