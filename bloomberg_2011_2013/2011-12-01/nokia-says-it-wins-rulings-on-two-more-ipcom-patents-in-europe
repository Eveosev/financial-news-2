(Corrects to say patents were ruled invalid as granted,
rather than simply invalid in story published Nov. 30.)  Nokia Oyj (NOK1V)  said it won rulings from
the  European Patent Office  that two more patents held by IPCom
GmbH & Co. were invalid as granted.  The rulings bring the total number of IPCom patents found
invalid as granted or conceded as invalid by IPCom to 56, Nokia
spokesman Mark Durrant said in e-mailed comments on the
companyâ€™s patent disputes.  IPCom said the EPO has decided on 24 patents, nine of which
were ruled valid, and nine invalid, IPCom spokesman Thomas Empt
said by e-mail. Six patents are still awaiting a decision, he
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
