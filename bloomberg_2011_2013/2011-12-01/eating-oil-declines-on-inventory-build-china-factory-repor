Heating oil declined after U.S.
stockpiles rose the most since January 2009 last week and
Chinese manufacturing in November weakened, indicating lower
fuel demand.  Prices dropped after the Energy Department reported
yesterday that U.S. supplies of heating oil and diesel  surged 
5.53 million barrels and  demand  slid 20 percent to the lowest
since August 2009. A  purchasing managers ’ index compiled by the
 China  Federation of Logistics and Purchasing slid to 49 in
November from 50.4 the prior month.  “Heating oil is leading the way lower,” said  Tim Evans ,
an energy analyst at Citi Futures Perspective in  New York . “We
had a bearish inventory report yesterday. In theory, the entire
market should be concerned about slowing economic performance
around the globe.”  January-delivery heating oil fell 5.56 cents, or 1.8
percent, to settle at $2.9695 a gallon on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange . Prices declined 0.7 percent last month and
are up 17 percent this year. Heating oil peaked at $3.3197 on
April 8.  The January contract’s premium to gasoline narrowed 5.51
cents to 41.16 cents a gallon.  “People were heavily long on heating oil and they got
blindsided by the build yesterday,” said  Phil Flynn , vice
president of research at PFGBest in Chicago. “You’re seeing the
unwinding of that spread. And the numbers were a little weak on
the demand side.”  Gasoline for January delivery fell 0.05 cent to settle at
$2.5579 a gallon on the exchange. Prices declined 2.8 percent in
November and have risen 4.3 percent this year. Gasoline peaked
at $3.4648 on April 29.  Jobless Claims  Labor Department figures showed that jobless claims climbed
by 6,000 to 402,000 in the week ended Nov. 26 that included the
Thanksgiving holiday. The number of people on unemployment
benefit rolls and those getting extended payments increased.  “The Chinese PMI and jobless claims seem to have limited
the market’s upward momentum,” said  Gene McGillian , an analyst
and broker at Tradition Energy in  Stamford , Connecticut.  Futures fell as global growth, particularly manufacturing,
has weakened from China to  Europe  while in the U.S., the
Institute for Supply Management’s factory index rose to 52.7 in
November from 50.8 a month earlier. A  manufacturing gauge  based
on a survey of euro-region purchasing managers fell to 46.4, the
lowest since July 2009, according to Markit Economics.  “The U.S. at the moment is the global engine of growth,”
Evans said. “We’re not really seeing economic acceleration
anywhere else. What is there to be bullish about?”  U.S.  gasoline inventories  increased to an eight-week high
last week, increasing 213,000 barrels to 209.8 million barrels.  Demand  for the motor fuel rose 2.1 percent to 8.77 million
barrels a day, the highest level since the week ended Oct. 7. On
a four-week average, gasoline consumption was 2.5 percent below
a year earlier.  Regular gasoline  at the pump, averaged nationwide, fell 0.3
cent to $3.292 a gallon yesterday, according to AAA data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
