Japan  bought 104,963 metric tons of
U.S. milling wheat in a regular tender today, the largest volume
in three weeks, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and
Fisheries said.  Shipment is set from Jan. 16 to Feb. 15, Toshiki Tojo at
the ministry’s grain-trade division said by phone. It was the
biggest purchase since Nov. 10, when the government bought
142,032 tons.  The ministry, which controls overseas purchases and
domestic sales of wheat to stabilize supply, is  Asia ’s largest
buyer as a single entity. It has bought 3.25 million tons
through regular tenders this fiscal year, compared with 5.16
million tons in the year ended March 31.  Details of this week’s tender are listed below:  To contact the reporter on this story:
