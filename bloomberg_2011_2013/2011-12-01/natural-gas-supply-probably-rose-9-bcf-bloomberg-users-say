The U.S. Energy Department’s natural-
gas inventory report, scheduled for release at 10:30 a.m. in
 Washington , will show that supplies rose 0.2 percent last week,
according to a survey of Bloomberg users.  The government’s Natural Gas Storage Report will show that
inventories gained 9 billion cubic feet in the week ended Nov.
25 to 3.861 trillion cubic feet, according to the survey.  Natural gas for January delivery rose 0.1 cent to $3.551
per million British thermal units on the New York Mercantile
Exchange at 10:25 a.m.  Bloomberg compiles the anonymous survey based on estimates
by at least 100 users each week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
