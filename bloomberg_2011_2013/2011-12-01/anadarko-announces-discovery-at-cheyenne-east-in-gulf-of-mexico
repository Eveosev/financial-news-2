Anadarko Petroleum Corp. (APC) , the largest
U.S. independent oil and natural-gas producer by market value,
found more gas than expected at its Cheyenne East project in the
Gulf of Mexico.  The company found more than 50 feet of gas-bearing rock at
the prospect, topping expectations, Chuck Meloy, senior vice
president of worldwide operations, said at a Jefferies & Co.
conference in Houston today.  The find is the first announced by Anadarko in the Gulf since
then end of a drilling moratorium that followed last year’s record
offshore U.S. oil spill at BP Plc’s Macondo well in the Gulf.
Anadarko had a stake in Macondo.  Anadarko is completing Cheyenne East and plans to tie it to
Independence Hub, a platform that handles flow from several Gulf
fields, Meloy said, with production expected next year. Anadarko
is also drilling at the Heidelberg and Nansen projects, Meloy said.
The company plans an extensive program next year, assuming it can
get U.S. permits, he said.  The company owns 100 percent of Cheyenne East,  John Christiansen , an Anadarko spokesman, said in a telephone interview
today.  Anadarko fell 1.1 percent to $80.38 at the close in  New York .  Independent  oil companies  don’t own refining, chemical or
retail fuel businesses.  To contact the reporter on this story:
