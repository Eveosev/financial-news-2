Asian bank stocks climbed paced by
 Nomura Holdings Inc. (8604)  and  DBS Group Holdings Ltd. (DBS) , after six
central banks moved to ease  Europe ’s debt crisis by making it
cheaper for lenders to borrow dollars.  The  MSCI AC Asia Pacific Financials Index (MXAP0FN)  climbed 3.9
percent as of 3:14 p.m. in Hong Kong. Nomura and  Mitsubishi UFJ
Financial Group  Inc. closed 2.8 percent and 3.1 percent higher
respectively in  Tokyo . DBS gained 3.2 percent in Singapore,
Taiwan’s  Cathay Financial Holding Co. (2882)  jumped 6.9 percent.
 KB Financial Group Inc. (105560)  jumped 5.7 percent to close at 39,900
won in Seoul.  “The joint action by the central banks signals that they
won’t let the problems exacerbate, they will do something,”
Ivan Li, deputy head of research at Kim Eng Securities Hong Kong
Ltd., said by telephone today. “This has increased the market
confidence.”  Six central banks led by the  Federal Reserve  agreed to cut
the cost of providing dollar funding via swap agreements and to
make other currencies available as needed. The People’s Bank of
 China  yesterday lowered reserve requirements for banks for the
first time since 2008, while Brazil cut borrowing costs for a
third straight meeting, joining Israel and Thailand in lowering
rates this week.  ICICI Bank Ltd. (ICICIBC) ,  India ’s second largest lender, jumped 6
percent to 755.4 rupees, leading gains among the country’s
lenders as China’s move strengthened expectations of a cut in
 cash reserve requirements  by the  Reserve Bank  of India.  The  Bankex Index (BANKEX) , which tracks 14 Indian lenders, rose 4
percent, heading for the biggest gain in three months.  State
Bank of India (SBIN) , the country’s largest lender, rose 3.6 percent to
1,823 rupees.  Shares of Australia’s four largest banks also advanced, led
by  National Australia Bank Ltd. (NAB) , which gained 3.3 percent.
 Macquarie Group Ltd. (MQG) , the nation’s biggest investment bank,
added 5.2 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
