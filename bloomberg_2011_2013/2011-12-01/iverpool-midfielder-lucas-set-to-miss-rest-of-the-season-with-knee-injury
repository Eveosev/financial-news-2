Liverpool midfielder Lucas Leiva is
set to miss the rest of the season after a scan confirmed an
injury to the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee.  “The Brazil international will undergo surgery and
unfortunately be ruled out for the remainder of the current
campaign,” the Premier League soccer club  said in a statement 
today.  Lucas, 24, who has made 15 appearances for the Reds this
season, suffered the injury in Liverpool’s 2-0 win at Chelsea in
the quarterfinals of the Carling Cup two days ago.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
