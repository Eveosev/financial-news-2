Killings related to drug violence in
 Mexico  dropped to 756 in November, the lowest monthly tally in
two years, the newspaper  Milenio  reported.  The figure, updated every month by the Mexico City-based
daily, pushed the number of killings so far this year to 11,379.
The death toll declined from 900 in October and was about half
the peak of 1,402 in April, Milenio said today.  Drug-related violence had accelerated this year as
President Felipe Calderon pressed ahead with a crackdown on
traffickers. Since he took office in December 2006, the death
toll related to organized crime has reached almost 43,000,
according to an Oct. 4 report by the U.S. Drug Enforcement
Administration.  Of last monthâ€™s deaths, 60 percent took place in the states
of Chihuahua, Sinaloa and Mexico, Milenio said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
