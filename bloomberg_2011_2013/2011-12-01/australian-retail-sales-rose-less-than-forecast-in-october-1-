Australian retail sales advanced less
than economists forecast in October as consumers reduced
spending at department stores.  Sales  climbed 0.2 percent from a month earlier, when they
rose 0.4 percent, the Bureau of Statistics said in Sydney today.
The result was less than the median  estimate  in a Bloomberg News
survey of 23 economists for a 0.4 percent gain.  Sales may accelerate into the holiday season after Reserve
Bank Governor  Glenn Stevens  on Nov. 1 lowered the nation’s
benchmark interest rate for the first time in 31 months,
reflecting slower inflation in the economy. Australian consumer
sentiment rose in October and the jobless rate fell in the month
for the first time since March.  “Although consumer sentiment has posted something of a
recovery in recent months, we expect a flat result for retail
sales given mixed anecdotes from retailers,” Felicity Emmett, a
senior economist at RBS Group Australia Ltd. in Sydney, said in
a research report before the release.  Spending on clothing and footwear rose 1.2 percent, and
consumers spent 0.5 percent more on food retailing, today’s
report showed. They spent 0.7 percent less at department stores,
it showed.  To contact the reporter for this story:
