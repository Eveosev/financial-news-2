Embraer SA (EMBR3)  and  Bombardier Inc. (BBD/B) , the
world’s fourth- and third-biggest airplane makers respectively,
see little effect from possible jet returns by  AMR Corp. (AMR) , which
sought court protection from creditors this week, top executives
from the planemakers said.  Embraer, based in Sao Jose dos Campos, Brazil, sees AMR
returning “a fraction of a fraction” of the 216 planes made by
the Brazilian company that it operates, Chief Financial Officer
Paulo Penido at a Credit Suisse conference today in New York.  Embraer has a financial guarantee for part of the risk on
the aircraft, financed by Brazil’s national bank. As for the
number of planes that might be returned, “It’s not very much;
it’s something we can easily afford,” he said.  Bombardier  has 47 of its CRJ700 models in operation in the
American Eagle fleet. The company, based in  Montreal , expects
smaller, less-efficient aircraft from other makers to be
scrutinized more closely and doesn’t have a backlog of orders at
the airline, Pierre Beaudoin, chief executive officer of
Bombardier, said on a call with analysts today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
