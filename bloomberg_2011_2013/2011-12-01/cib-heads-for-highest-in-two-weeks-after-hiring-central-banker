Commercial International Bank Egypt
SAE (COMI) , the Arab country’s biggest publicly traded lender, headed
for the highest close in two weeks after hiring a former central
banker as vice chairman and managing director.  Shares of the Cairo-based bank, also known as CIB, rose 3.4
percent to 24.05 Egyptian pounds, their highest since the Nov.
16 close. That brought the stock’s advance this week to 12
percent. The benchmark  EGX 30 Index (EGX30)  climbed 0.9 percent.  Hisham Ramez, who ended his term this month as deputy
governor of  Egypt ’s central bank, will head the institutional
and consumer businesses at CIB, the lender said today. Hisham Ezz Al-Arab, chairman and managing director, will oversee the
regulatory departments with special focus on strategic issues,
CIB said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
