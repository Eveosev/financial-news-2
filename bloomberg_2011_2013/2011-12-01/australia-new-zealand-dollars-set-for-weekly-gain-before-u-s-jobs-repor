The Australian and  New Zealand 
dollars rose for the first week in a month versus their U.S.
counterpart as the U.S. jobless rate unexpectedly dropped to the
lowest since 2009, boosting demand for higher-yielding assets.  New Zealand’s currency gained the most in a week since May
2009. Both South Pacific currencies fluctuated today after
stocks pared gains on concern European leaders won’t agree at a
summit next week on how to handle their sovereign-debt crisis.
The Aussie’s performance was also tempered before the  Reserve
Bank  of Australia holds a policy meeting on Dec. 6.  “The Aussie will be stable to higher with recent data
coming out of the U.S. relatively strong,” said Derek Mumford,
a Sydney-based director at Rochford Capital, a currency-risk
management firm. “We could see a rally over the next few weeks,
but the reality is that things aren’t that good.”  Australia ’s dollar appreciated 5.3 percent this week to
$1.0223 at 1:33 p.m. New York time. It ended the day down 0.2
percent. The Aussie gained 5.5 percent to 79.68 yen on the week
and rose 0.1 percent today.  New Zealand’s dollar, nicknamed the kiwi, strengthened 5
percent this week to 77.76 U.S. cents after slipping 0.2 percent
today. It was little changed today at 60.61 yen and climbed 5.5
percent on the week.  U.S. Jobless Rate  The U.S. unemployment rate sank to 8.6 percent in November,
the lowest level since March 2009, from 9 percent, the Labor
Department reported today. The median estimate in a Bloomberg
News survey had been for the rate to remain unchanged. Payrolls
rose by 120,000 after a revised 100,000 gain the previous month.  The  MSCI World Index (MXWO)  of stocks was up 0.4 percent after
gaining as much as 1.1 percent. For the week, it climbed 8.3
percent. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 0.4 percent for
the day and 7.8 percent for the week.  Investors are betting the slowing outlook for global growth
will prompt the RBA to lower its key  interest rate . Policy
makers will drop the benchmark by a quarter percentage point to
4.25 percent next week, according to the median forecast in a
Bloomberg  survey  of 25 economists.  German  Chancellor Angela Merkel  likened solving  Europe ’s
debt crisis to a marathon, shunning investor calls for quick
action while pushing for stricter budget enforcement and
overhauling the region’s governance.  Addressing lawmakers in Berlin today before a Dec. 9 summit
of European leaders, Merkel rejected joint euro-area bonds or
trying to make the European Central Bank the lender of last
resort as quick fixes.  To contact the reporters on this story:
