U.S. Treasury Secretary  Timothy F. Geithner  said weakening the Dodd-Frank financial overhaul law
would hurt the nation’s consumers, and he vowed to fight to
preserve the reforms.  “Even with all the damage caused by this crisis, with
millions of Americans still struggling to find work or stay in
their homes, and even in the face of the European crisis, we are
seeing a determined effort to slow and weaken reforms that are
critical to our ability to protect Americans from another
crisis,” Geithner said in Washington today.  House Republicans , swept into power in the November 2010
elections, are pushing bills to revise, delay or repeal parts of
the law affecting areas including the Consumer Financial
Protection Bureau, derivatives rules and restrictions on
proprietary trading. Regulators are writing hundreds of rules
mandated by the law.  “The forces working against reform are trying a range of
different strategies,” including blocking presidential
appointments and cutting funding, Geithner told a conference on
the “macroprudential toolkit.”  The reforms are “sensible and essential,” he said. “We
are going to fight to preserve them.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
