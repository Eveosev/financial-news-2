Two regional Federal Reserve bank
presidents said the central bank doesn’t need to lower the
discount rate, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing
interviews with the officials.  Dallas Fed President  Richard Fisher  said he “wouldn’t make
that assumption at all” that the Fed would lower the  interest
rate  on direct loans to U.S. banks after yesterday’s reduction
of the rate on overseas dollar loans, the newspaper said today
on its website. America’s biggest banks don’t need emergency
funding, Fisher said, according to the Journal.  St. Louis Fed President  James Bullard  said in an interview
that the Fed need not take action and that demand for funds from
the discount window is low, the publication said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
