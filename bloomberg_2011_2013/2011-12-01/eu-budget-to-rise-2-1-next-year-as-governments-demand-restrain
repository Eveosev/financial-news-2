The European Union approved a 2.1
percent increase in spending next year, a smaller rise than in
2011 as national governments insisted on EU budget restraint to
match domestic austerity aimed at tackling the debt crisis.  The  European Parliament  endorsed a 129.1 billion-euro
($174.1 billion) budget for 2012 compared with 126.5 billion
euros this year, when spending is growing 2.9 percent. EU
governments gave their backing yesterday to the 2.6 billion-euro
boost next year in total expenditure, almost half of which goes
to agriculture.  “If everyone is tightening their belts in  Europe , the
European institutions must do the same,”  Alexander Alvaro , a
German member of the 27-nation EU Parliament, said in an e-
mailed statement today in Brussels.  The 2012 budget is the sixth under a multi-year EU spending
program that locked in farm spending through 2013. The program
fixed total expenditure in 2007-2013 at 864 billion euros, or
1.05 percent of the region’s gross domestic product. The
expenditure next year amounts to 1 percent of the EU’s GDP. By
comparison, national spending in the EU averaged 51 percent of
domestic GDP in 2009.  The other main part of the EU budget goes to foster
development in poorer European regions, leading this policy area
and agriculture together to soak up around four-fifths of the
total. Next year’s spending plan earmarks 57 billion euros in
farm expenditure and 43.8 billion euros in regional aid.  To contact the reporter on this story:
