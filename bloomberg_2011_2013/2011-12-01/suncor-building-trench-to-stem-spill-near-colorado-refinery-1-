  Suncor Energy Inc. (SU)  has started work
on a trench to contain a “gasoline-type” substance that is
seeping near its Commerce City, Colorado, refinery.  “It’s a more long-term system to capture and contain the
seepage,” Karen Edson, a spokeswoman for the Environmental
Protection Agency, said in a telephone interview from the site
near Denver. “They’ve virtually contained all the material.”  A substance had been seeping from land near the refinery
into Sand Creek, which flows into the South Platte River. Crews
began digging the trench last night, Edson said.  The EPA has sent out samples of the material for
identification, Edson said. The agency hasn’t released an
estimate of the volume that leaked.  Suncor built dams yesterday on the creek and started
skimming off the substance. An employee of the Calgary-based
company noticed a sheen on the creek and reported it Nov. 28.  Sneh Seetal, a Suncor spokeswoman, didn’t immediately
return call seeking comment.  Suncor, the world’s second-biggest oil sands miner, bought
the Denver-area refinery from ConocoPhillips in 2003. The
refinery has a capacity of 36,000 barrels a day, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
