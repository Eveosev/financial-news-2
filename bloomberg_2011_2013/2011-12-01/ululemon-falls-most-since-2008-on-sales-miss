Lululemon Athletica Inc. (LULU) , the
Canadian yoga-wear retailer, fell the most in almost three years
after third-quarter sales trailed analysts’ estimates.  Lululemon declined 11 percent to $44.01 at 11:23 a.m. in
New York after touching $41.70 for the biggest intraday decline
since Dec. 11, 2008. The shares had risen 45 percent this year
before today.  Revenue increased 31 percent to $230.2 million, the
Vancouver-based company said in a statement today. Analysts had
predicted $235.3 million, according to the average of estimates
compiled by Bloomberg.  Lululemon has struggled to maintain consistent inventories,
leaving customers wanting for some of the company’s most popular
brands this quarter, Liz Dunn, a senior analyst for Macquarie
Group Ltd. in  New York , said today in an interview. The retailer
also was renovating some major stores, which depressed sales
below some analysts’ expectations.  “Investors in Lululemon have been conditioned to see
significant sales upside and we didn’t see that today,” said
Dunn, whose sales estimate was slightly below the company’s
result. She rates the shares neutral.  Net income for the quarter that ended Oct. 30 rose to $38.8
million, or 27 cents a share, from $25.7 million, or 18 cents, a
year earlier, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
