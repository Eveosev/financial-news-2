Russia’s ranking among the world’s
most corrupt nations fell to the lowest level since 2007, the
year before President  Dmitry Medvedev  came to office, according
to  Transparency International .  Russia was classified as the 143rd most-corrupt country out
of 182 surveyed in Transparency International’s 2011 Corruption
Perceptions Index, an improvement on its 154th place the
previous year. Even with the improved ranking, Russia remains
the world’s most corrupt major economy, with higher levels of
graft than in Pakistan, Cameroon and Niger.  New Zealand  is the
least corrupt country and Somalia the most, according to the
Berlin-based anti-corruption watchdog.  Medvedev, 46, a former corporate lawyer, repeatedly
promised to fight corruption and improve the rule of law. He
agreed in September to step aside next May to make way for the
return of Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin  to the presidency.
Putin, 59, a former KGB officer, has been in power since 2000
and may serve as president for another 12 years.  Russians paid at least 164 billion rubles ($5.35 billion)
in bribes last year to buy off teachers, traffic policemen and
others in “everyday” situations, almost double the level in
2001, the  Economy Ministry  said in June.  To contact the reporter on this story:
