Oil rose, heading for its first
weekly gain in three, as tension between  Iran  and the West
heightened speculation  Middle East  supply may be threatened.  Futures gained as much as 0.8 percent and were up 4.1
percent for the week. European governments tightened sanctions
on Iran, the second-biggest oil producer in the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries, in a clampdown over the Persian
Gulf nation’s nuclear program. The U.K. yesterday ordered Iran
to close its embassy in London after a mob attack on the British
legation in Tehran bought international condemnation.  “We have a dangerous possibility of a war, at the worst,
so we always have to put some premium in this market,” said  Ken Hasegawa , a commodity sales manager at broker Newedge Group in
 Tokyo , who sees New York oil futures trading between $98.50 and
$101.50. “Even though the economic situation is worse than at
the beginning of the year, the oil price will be staying at this
high level.”  Crude for January delivery was up 60 cents at $100.80 a
barrel in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile Exchange 
at 4:12 p.m. in Singapore today. It earlier declined as much as
31 cents to $99.89 a barrel.  Brent oil for January settlement was at $109.85 a barrel,
up 86 cents, on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange.
The contract slid $1.53, or 1.4 percent, to $108.99 yesterday.  The European contract’s premium to West Texas Intermediate
crude traded in  New York  declined 16 cents to $9.05 a barrel.
The spread surged to a record $27.88 on Oct. 14.  Jobless Rate  Oil also rose before a U.S. Labor Department report today
that may show 125,000 workers were added last month, according
to the median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey of economists.
The jobless rate probably held at 9 percent, the survey showed.  Oil futures may fall next week as unemployment stays near
that level, a separate Bloomberg News survey showed. Eleven of
24 analysts, or 46 percent, forecast oil will fall through Dec.
9. Nine, or 38 percent, predicted a gain, and four said there
will be little change. Last week, 57 percent of those surveyed
projected a drop.  To contact the reporter on this story:
