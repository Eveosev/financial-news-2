America Movil SAB (AMXL) , the largest
mobile-phone carrier in the Americas, said it’s discussing
alternatives for its planned acquisition of Digicel Group Ltd.’s
El Salvador unit because of regulatory restrictions on the deal.  The company in an e-mail today cited the failure to receive
“satisfactory” government approval. Regulators approved the
transaction on the condition that  America Movil ’s unit in the
Central American nation shed 20 megahertz of wireless airwaves
that could be granted to a competitor, El Mundo reported in
September. America Movil also would have to maintain Digicel’s
business strategy in El Salvador for five years, the newspaper
 said .  America Movil, based in Mexico City, is seeking to boost
its market position in Central America to compete against
 Millicom International Cellular SA . The company said earlier
today it completed the acquisition of Digicel’s Honduras unit
and the sale of its own Jamaica unit to Digicel.  The companies announced the three transactions in March
without disclosing financial terms.  At the end of 2010, Millicom led  El Salvador ’s mobile-phone
market with about 36 percent of the nation’s almost 8 million
subscribers, Pyramid Research said in a June report. A Digicel
and America Movil combination in the country would control about
48 percent of the market, the Cambridge, Massachusetts-based
research firm said.  America Movil, controlled by billionaire  Carlos Slim , was
little changed today in Mexico City trading. Kingston, Jamaica-
based Digicel is closely held.  To contact the reporter on this story:
