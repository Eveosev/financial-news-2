Oslo Boers VPS Holding ASA, the
city’s stock exchange, said the Norwegian Financial Supervisory
Authority advised the  Finance Ministry  to reject the bourse’s
plans to list its shares.  “The rationale for the recommendation is, in part, that a
listing of the parent company of Oslo Boers on a regulated
market that is operated by Oslo Boers could lead to conflicts of
interest,” the exchange said.  A decision on a listing was to be submitted to shareholders
at an extraordinary general meeting before the end of 2011. The
issue of a notice calling such a general meeting has been
postponed until a final decision on the application is received
from the Finance Ministry, the exchange said.    To contact the editor responsible for this story:
