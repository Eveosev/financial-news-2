Saab AB (SAABB) , which won a 3.1 billion
Swiss-franc ($3.41 billion) order for 22 Gripen fighter jets
this week, will keep competing on price to lure buyers as
governments adapt to shrinking budgets, its chief executive
officer said.  “There are many countries that have a need for fighter
aircraft but they also want money to invest in other things,
such as health-care,” Hakan Buskhe said in a telephone
interview today.  Saab, based in Linkoeping south of Stockholm, edged out
Dassault Aviation’s Rafale jet and the Eurofighter model to
clinch the deal this week. The 1,320 mile-per-hour Gripen, which
entered service in 1993, will replace Switzerland’s fleet of
ageing Northrop F-5 Tigers. The Swedish manufacturer is
competing for further orders in  Croatia , Bulgaria, Brazil,
Denmark and the Netherlands.  The Gripen is “a sensible solution, and with a budget that
will remain under pressure over the coming years, we can’t
always go for the top of the top,” Swiss Defense Minister Ueli Maurer said yesterday. “The Gripen is technically excellent.”  The purchase will cost about 3.1 billion Swiss francs,
according to the Swiss government. Buskhe declined to disclose
the price tag for the aircraft.  The Swiss success follows setbacks for the Gripen in recent
years, after the jet was ejected from a competition in  India ,
and Norway snubbed Saab for  Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT) ’s Joint Strike
Fighter.  Saab fell 4.7 percent, to 114.9 kronor at 1:54 p.m. in
 Stockholm  trading. The stock rose 11 percent yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
