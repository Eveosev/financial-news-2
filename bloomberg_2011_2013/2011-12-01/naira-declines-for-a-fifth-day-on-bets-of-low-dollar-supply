Nigeria ’s naira slipped for a fifth
day on speculation the central bank won’t sell enough dollars
after  oil companies  finished sales of the U.S. currency.  The currency of  Africa ’s biggest oil producer depreciated
0.2 percent to 161.65 per dollar by midday in Lagos, erasing an
earlier gain.  Nigeria sold $200 million at a foreign-currency auction
yesterday, the same amount  demanded  by lenders, according to an
e-mailed statement from the  Central Bank of Nigeria . The last
time lenders’ demand was met was Nov. 16. The  marginal rate ,
which is also used as the prevailing exchange rate, strengthened
0.6 percent to 156.31 per dollar.  “Most of the oil companies have finished their month-end
dollar sales and traders bet the central bank won’t supply
enough to meet high demand for imports expected towards the
year-end,” Tunde Ladipo, chief executive officer of Lagos-based
Valuechain Investment Ltd., which trades currencies, said by
phone today. “The naira will likely face intense pressure this
month.”  The central bank on Nov. 21 lowered the midpoint of its
exchange-rate band at its twice-weekly auctions to 155 naira per
dollar from 150 naira, amid pressure from rising imports and
concern about weakening  oil prices , the source of more than 95
percent of Nigeria’s foreign-exchange income.  Ghana’s cedi appreciated for the second day, adding 1.2
percent to 1.6465 per dollar by 11:14 a.m. in Accra, the
nation’s capital, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
