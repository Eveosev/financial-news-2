Tunisia agreed to buy 75,000 metric
tons of durum wheat in a tender yesterday, according to the
state-run grain agency.  The Office des Cereales bought 25,000 tons of the grain at
$407.99 a ton from Glencore International Plc, Assia Boussena,
director of procurement at the agency, said by telephone from
Tunis. It also made two further purchases of equal size, one at
$399.89 a ton from Eurograni and the other at $414.89 a ton from
Glencore, Boussena said.  All prices include the cost of freight, and the cargoes are
for delivery between Jan. 1 and Jan. 20, Boussena said. Durum
wheat is the hard variety of the grain used to make pasta and
couscous, a staple dish in western North Africa.  To contact the reporter on this story:
