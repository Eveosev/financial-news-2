The ruble slid against the euro for
the first day in three amid speculation the best gain in a
month, spurred by central banks’ steps to curb the European debt
crisis yesterday, was overdone.  The ruble lost 0.2 percent to 41.4875 per euro at the 7
p.m. close in Moscow after advancing 0.9 percent yesterday, the
strongest appreciation since Oct. 24. The Russian currency was
little changed at 30.745 per dollar, leaving it steady at
35.5791 against the central bank’s target dollar-euro basket.  The U.S. Federal Reserve and five other central banks cut
the costs of borrowing dollars for emergency funding by European
banks yesterday, spurring rallies in equities and currencies
globally.  “Yesterday’s decision is not the end of the story or
resolution of the puzzle,”  Julia Tsepliaeva , head of research
at BNP Paribas SA in Moscow, said by e-mail. “I expect
volatility to remain very high, with news across the spectrum
from gloom to optimism.”  Investors increased bets the ruble would weaken further,
with non-deliverable forwards showing the currency at 31.1703
per dollar in three months, compared with expectations of 31.139
per dollar yesterday. The yield on  Russia ’s dollar Eurobonds due
in 2020 fell 17 basis points, or 0.17 percentage point, to 4.417
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
