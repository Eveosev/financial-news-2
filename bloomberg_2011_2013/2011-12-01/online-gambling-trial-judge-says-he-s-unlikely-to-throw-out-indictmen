A federal judge said he’s unlikely to
dismiss an illegal gambling case involving the three largest
Internet poker companies doing business in the U.S.  “I think it extraordinarily unlikely the entire indictment
will be dismissed,” U.S. District Judge  Lewis Kaplan  in
Manhattan said at the end of a hearing today on a request to
dismiss the case. He said he would rule later on the motion and
that a trial, if held, would begin March 12.  Eleven defendants were accused in April of bank fraud,
 money laundering  and illegal gambling through the online
companies PokerStars, Full Tilt Poker and Absolute Poker.  Lawyers for two of the defendants, Chad Elie and John
Campos, argued in court today that the U.S. law making it a
crime for businesses to accept payment in connection with
unlawful Internet gambling doesn’t apply to poker.  The case is U.S. v. Scheinberg, 10-cr-00336, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of  New York  (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
