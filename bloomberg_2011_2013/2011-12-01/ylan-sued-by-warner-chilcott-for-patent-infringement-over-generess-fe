Mylan Inc.  was sued by a unit of
 Warner Chilcott Plc (WCRX)  for infringing a U.S. patent with plans to
market low-cost copies of the oral contraceptive Generess FE.  Warner Chilcott Co. of Fajardo, Puerto Rico, alleges that
Canonsburg, Pennsylvania-based Mylan violated the 2003 patent by
applying to the U.S.  Food and Drug Administration  for approval
of generic Generess Fe in chewable tablet form.  Mylan has claimed that the patent “is purportedly invalid,
unenforceable, and or will not be infringed” by the generic
product, Warner Chilcott said in a complaint filed Nov. 22 in
federal court in Trenton, New Jersey. Warner Chilcott denies
this claim.  Warner Chilcott seeks a judgment of infringement and a
permanent injunction against Mylan’s sale of the drug in the
U.S. until the patent expires in 2019.  Generess Fe logged $4.5 million in sales from its
introduction in April to Sept. 30, Mylan said in a statement
citing IMS Health data.  The case is Warner Chilcott Co. v.  Mylan Inc. (MYL) , 11-cv-6844,
U.S. District Court, District of  New Jersey  (Trenton).  To see the patent, click: 6,667,050.  To contact the reporter on this story:
