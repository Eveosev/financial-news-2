Syncrude’s premium to U.S. West Texas
Intermediate oil weakened on speculation that supplies will rise
as maintenance that has limited production ends.  Work on a hydrogen plant at the Syncrude Canada Ltd. oil
sands upgrader will be completed in December, according to
Canadian Oil Sands Ltd., the biggest holder in the venture.
Syncrude has been stockpiling bitumen, which is processed into a
light, low-sulfur synthetic oil, at its northeastern Alberta
facility in anticipation of the restart.  Syncrude ’s premium weakened 75 cents to $4.25 a barrel at
4:02 p.m. in  New York , according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The discount for  Western Canada Select  widened 60 cents to $11 a
barrel.  Light Louisiana Sweet ’s premium to WTI decreased 75 cents
to $10.85 a barrel.  Heavy Louisiana Sweet’s  premium narrowed 90
cents to $11.20.  Thunder Horse’s premium to WTI narrowed $1.10 to $8.80. The
premium for Mars Blend lost 90 cents to $6.85 a barrel.
 Poseidon ’s premium narrowed $1.80 to $6.20 a barrel over WTI.  Southern Green Canyon ’s premium decreased 50 cents to $6.50
a barrel and  West Texas Sour ’s discount narrowed 5 cents to 85
cents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
