OAO Gazprom ,  Russia ’s natural-gas
export monopoly, jumped to the highest level in two weeks on a
report it may set aside as much as 200 billion rubles ($6.5
billion) a year for dividends through 2014.  Gazprom climbed as much as 5.1 percent in Moscow and traded
up 4 percent at 182.44 rubles at 5:40 p.m., heading for the
 biggest gain  in a month.  The gas producer is budgeting about 200 billion rubles a
year for dividends in 2012 through 2014, Interfax reported,
citing an unidentified person familiar with the plan. The
Moscow-based company also may trim planned investments next year
by 33 percent to 800 billion rubles, the news service said.  Gazprom spokesman  Sergei Kupriyanov  wasn’t immediately
available to comment.  “It’s very good, positive news for Gazprom shareholders,”
Lev Snykov, a partner at Greenwich Capital in Moscow, said by
phone. “That means a nearly 5 percent yield, which puts them on
par with the best global companies.”  Gazprom paid a record dividend of 3.85 rubles a share for
2010. The company’s dividend  yield  was about 2.1 percent,
compared with an average of 4.4 percent for the industry,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
