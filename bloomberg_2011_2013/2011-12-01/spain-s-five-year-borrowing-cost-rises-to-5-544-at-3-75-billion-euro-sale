Spain  sold 3.75 billion euros ($5.1
billion) of bonds, meeting its maximum target, and it paid the
most in at least six years to borrow for five years as European
efforts to stem the region’s debt crisis fall short.  Spain auctioned five-year bonds today at an average yield
of 5.544 percent, compared with 4.848 percent when notes of a
similar maturity were offered on Nov. 3, the Treasury said. That
was the highest since at least 2005, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. It paid 5.276 percent on bonds due in 2016, and an
average 5.187 percent to sell notes maturing in April 2015,
compared with 3.639 percent in October.  Spanish debt gained after the sale. The yield on the 10-
year benchmark bond declined to 6.045 percent as of 11:27 a.m.
Madrid time, down 18 basis points from yesterday.  Demand for Spain’s five-year bonds was 2.69 times the
amount sold, compared with 1.62 last month and the bid-to-cover
for the April 2015 notes was 2.7 compared with 2.07 in October.
 France  also sold 4.346 billion euros of debt today, compared
with the maximum 4.5 billion euros on offer.  As the crisis that began in  Greece  two years ago moves to
the euro-area’s core, leaders are struggling to convince
investors they can ensure the  euro’s  survival. European Central
Bank President  Mario Draghi  said today that the bank’s program
of buying  government bonds , which has included Spain since
August, “can only be limited” and called on governments to
“restore their credibility.”  Yields Fall  The extra yield investors demand to hold Spain’s 10-year
bond over equivalent German securities fell to 376 basis points
from 396 basis points yesterday. That spread reached a euro-era
high of 503 basis points on Nov. 18, compared with an average of
15 basis points in the first decade of monetary union. Spain is
rated AA- by  Standard & Poor’s , having lost in January 2009 the
AAA rating that  Germany  still has.  Investors are still waiting to see what policies Prime
Minister-elect  Mariano Rajoy  will implement to meet a campaign
pledge of trying to restore Spain’s AAA rating. Rajoy, who met
union leaders yesterday to discuss labor-market rules, doesn’t
take over until Dec. 22, a month after his election. The
People’s Party leader meets the regional presidents who belong
to his party today as he prepares spending cuts to avoid overlap
between regional, local and central administrations.  The Treasury changed the securities it planned to sell at
today’s auction, opting for longer-dated notes that already
trade instead of a new benchmark three-year bond, citing market
conditions. Spain’s  short-term  borrowing costs are approaching
the levels of longer-term yields as the gap between two-year and
10-year rates narrowed last week to the least in three years.  The Treasury had already issued more than 16 billion euros
each of the 2015 and 2016 bonds and more than 14 billion euros
of the 2017 securities, according to data compiled by Bloomberg,
making them more liquid than a new bond.  To contact the reporters on this story:
