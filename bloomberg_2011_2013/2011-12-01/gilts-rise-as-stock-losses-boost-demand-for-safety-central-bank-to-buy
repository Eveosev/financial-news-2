Gilts rose, pushing two-year yields
to a record low, as a decline in stocks and speculation economic
growth is slowing boosted demand for safer investments.  Shorter-maturity notes led gains as the  Bank of England 
said it will buy securities due between three and 10 years at
its first debt-purchase operation next year. An industry report
today showed U.K. manufacturing shrank in November at the
fastest pace since June 2009 and new orders dropped for a fifth
month. The pound dropped against the euro and the dollar.  “Market sentiment remains fragile as there’s still a lot
of uncertainty, and that’s supportive for short-dated gilts,”
said Mohit Kumar, head of European fixed-income strategy at
Deutsche Bank AG in London. “Price moves were exacerbated
somewhat by poor year-end liquidity.”  The two-year  yield  fell nine basis points, or 0.09
percentage point, to 0.375 percent at the 5:33 p.m. in  London ,
after dropping to 0.36 percent, the lowest since Bloomberg began
tracking the data in 1992. The 4.5 percent note due in March
2013 gained 0.1, or 1 pound per 1,000 pound ($1,569) face value,
to 105.195.  Ten-year yields fell five basis points to 2.26 percent
after rising as much as 12 basis points.  The FTSE 100 Index of stocks fell 0.3 percent and the
 Standard & Poor’s  500 index slipped 0.2 percent.  Gilts rose as a report showed U.K. manufacturing shrank in
November at the fastest pace since June 2009. The industry is
suffering as the euro-region sovereign debt crisis jeopardizes
the outlook for exports to  Europe , Britain’s biggest trading
partner, and as the global economy cools.  Manufacturing Shrinks  Markit Economics and the  Chartered Institute of Purchasing
and Supply  said their factory  index (UKX)  dropped to 47.6 last month
from a revised 47.8 in October.  Bank of England Governor Mervyn King today urged banks to
enhance efforts to bolster their defenses against the euro
area’s debt turmoil, which he said now looks like a “systemic
crisis.”  U.K. government bonds have returned 15 percent this year,
while German debt gained 6.5 percent and  U.S. Treasuries  rose 9
percent, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the
European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies.  The central bank announced today that it will buy gilts
with maturities ranging from three-to-10 years at on Jan. 3, its
first purchase for 2012 under the quantitative easing program.  Gilts fell and the pound rose against the dollar earlier
after six central banks led by the Federal Reserve yesterday
agreed to cut the cost of providing dollar funding via swaps
agreement and to make other currencies available as needed.  The pound dropped 0.1 percent to $1.5689 and weakened 0.3
percent to 85.83 pence per euro.  “The optimism that helped the pound to perform well is
unlikely to prove sustainable in the current wider conditions,
as shown by the manufacturing figures today,” said  Lee Hardman ,
a currency strategist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd. in
London.  To contact the reporters on this story:
