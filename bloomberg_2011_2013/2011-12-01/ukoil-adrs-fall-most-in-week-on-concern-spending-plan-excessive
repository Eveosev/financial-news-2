OAO Lukoil (LUKOY)  dropped the most in a week
in  New York  on concern Russia’s second-largest oil company will
spend too much as it seeks to revive output growth.  Lukoil (LKOH) ’s American depositary receipts declined 2.5 percent
to $54.80 at the close of trading in New York, its biggest
intraday slide since Nov. 21.  The Moscow-based company plans to invest $48 billion in
2012-2014 and aims to spend more than 70 percent of the $13.9
billion earmarked for next year to halt declines at West
Siberian units and ramp up the West Qurna-2 project in  Iraq ,
Vagit Alekperov, Lukoil’s billionaire chief executive officer,
told reporters today in Moscow. Lukoil also aims to start
projects in the Caspian Sea and Uzbekistan, Alekperov said.  “Investors are concerned that as capital expenditure will
rise to gigantic levels, there will be less money left for
dividends,” Sergey Vakhrameev, a senior analyst at IFC
Metropol, said by phone from Moscow. “Investment of $48 billion
over three years is very high for Lukoil, and foreign projects
bring much lower profits compared to the Russian ones.”  Oil and gas output will rise at an average of 3.5 percent
annually over the next 10 years, Lukoil said today in a
statement after the board approved its strategy through 2021.  Lukoil retreated 1.1 percent to close at 1,704.50 rubles on
 Russia ’s Micex index. One Lukoil ADR is equal to one ordinary
share.  To contact the reporter on this story:
