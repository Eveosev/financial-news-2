The Philippine peso climbed the most
in two months as regional stocks jumped after the  Federal
Reserve  and five other central banks made it cheaper for lenders
to borrow dollars. Ten-year bonds rose.  The country’s benchmark stock index gained 1.9 percent, the
most since Oct. 7, after global monetary authorities agreed to
reduce the  interest rate  on dollar-liquidity swap lines by 50
basis points. Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas left its benchmark
interest rate at 4.50 percent today, as predicted by 14 of 17
economists surveyed by Bloomberg. Three forecast a cut to 4.25
percent.  “The good news overnight boosted risk-appetite and spurred
a rally in Asian markets today,” said Rafael Algarra, executive
vice president at Security Bank Corp. in Manila.  The peso strengthened 0.8 percent to 43.283 per dollar as
of 4:20 p.m. in  Manila , its biggest gain since Sept. 28,
according to Tullett Prebon Plc. The peso will probably advance
to 43 before year-end, Algarra said.  The Philippines, along with  India ,  China  and Mexico will be
the largest recipients of overseas remittances this year, which
will rise 8.5 percent to $406 billion, according to a World Bank
report. Philippine  remittances  climbed 8.4 percent to $1.7
billion in September from a year earlier, the central bank said
Nov. 15.  ”Inflows from remittances are typically strong this time
of the year,” Algarra said.  The yield on the 6.375 percent January 2022 bond fell six
basis points, or 0.06 percentage point, to 5.60 percent, the
lowest level in more than two months, according to Tradition
Financial Services.  The central bank will mainly consider the nation’s growth
and inflation dynamics in deciding monetary policy, Deputy
Governor Diwa Guinigundo said yesterday after  Thailand  cut its
benchmark rate and China reduced lenders’ reserve-requirement
ratio.  Bangko Sentral will probably start cutting borrowing costs
by the first quarter of 2012, Algarra said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
