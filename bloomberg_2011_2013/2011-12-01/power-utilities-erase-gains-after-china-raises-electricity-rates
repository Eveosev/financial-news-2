Chinese power producers led by
 Huaneng Power International Inc. (902)  fell in Hong Kong after some
investors deemed an early rally triggered by an increase in
electricity prices and a cap on coal costs as excessive.  The unit of  China ’s largest power producer closed 2.5
percent lower at HK$3.85, after climbing as much as 4.8 percent.
 Datang International Power Generation Co. (991)  fell 1.2 percent to
HK$2.54 after gaining as much as 7.8 percent.  Huadian Power
International Co. (1071)  dropped 0.7 percent to HK$1.40. The benchmark
 Hang Seng Index (HSI)  gained 5.6 percent.  China raised prices charged by coal-fired power plants to
distributors, known as on-grid tariffs, by 0.026 yuan (0.41
cent) per kilowatt-hour effective today, and capped the cost of
coal in the  spot market  at 800 yuan a ton, below current prices.
Huaneng and Datang posted declines in third-quarter profit while
Huadian reported a loss, following increases in fuel prices.  “The tariff hike announcement might trigger some profit-
taking,” Citigroup analysts Pierre Lau, Charles Wang and  Cathy Chan  wrote in a report. “But we maintain our positive view on
them in the first half for margin improvement from the hike and
easing of spot coal prices.”  The government also raised retail power prices by an
average 0.03 yuan per kilowatt-hour. Inflation slowed the most
in almost three years in October, giving China room to increase
tariffs. The government last raised power prices June 1.  China will also limit price gains for thermal-coal supply
contracts next year to less than 5 percent, the National
Development and Reform Commission, the country’s top economic
planner, said yesterday. The government froze this year’s
contract prices at 2010 levels to tame inflation.  Coal Producers  China Shenhua Energy Co. (1088) , the nation’s biggest coal
producer, gained 6.1 percent to HK$34.65, the most since Oct. 7.
China Coal Energy Co., a unit of the second-largest producer of
the fuel, climbed 8.7 percent to HK$9.51.  Yanzhou Coal Mining
Co. (1171)  rose 9.3 percent to HK$19.  “Raising the contract price will provide major coal
producers an immediate boost in terms of guaranteed profit
margins,” said Helen Lau, a Hong Kong-based analyst at UOB-Kay
Hian Ltd. “The overall optimistic sentiment in the market today
certainly also helps the performance of coal stocks.”  Shenhua sold 45 percent of its coal under contracts in the
first nine months, and with a 5 percent increase in prices,
profit may increase an additional 3.5 percent for 2012 on top of
estimates, Lau said. China Coal, which sold 56 percent of its
coal under contracts, may get an extra 8.3 percent boost to its
net income, she said.  The government capped contract prices at 570 yuan a ton
this year, according to Lau.  Benchmark spot prices at Qinhuangdao, the nation’s largest
coal port, rose to 860 yuan a ton Oct. 23, the highest since
2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
