New South Wales,  Australia ’s second-
biggest state borrower, can pay out a A$6 billion ($6.2 billion)
security maturing in May from current resources and is able to
avoid returning to the  bond market  for as long as six months,
Treasurer Mike Baird said.  The recent increase in state government bond yields
relative to federal government debt is not specific to New South
Wales and reflects “an inability for the financial markets
intermediaries to warehouse risk as they normally would,” Baird
said in an e-mailed response to questions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
