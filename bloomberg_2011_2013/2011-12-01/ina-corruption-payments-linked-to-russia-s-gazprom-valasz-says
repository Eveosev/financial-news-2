Croatia ’s corruption charges against
Hungarian refiner MOL Nyrt. are erroneous as the two Cyprus-
based companies through which  Mol Nyrt.  allegedly paid a bribe
to obtain a majority in Croatian refiner  INA (INARA)  Industrija Nafte
d.d. belong to OAO Gazprom,  Heti Valasz  said, citing documents
it obtained.  Croatia is accusing Mol Chief Executive Officer Zsolt Hernadi of paying a 10 million-euro ($13.5 million) bribe to
former Croatian Premier Ivo Sanader through two Cyprus-based
companies, which are Mol affiliates, the Hungarian weekly said.  The two companies, Hangarn Oil Products Trading Ltd. and
Ceroma Holdings Ltd.,  are controlled by Russian energy giant
Gazprom through Atlas Alpha Services Ltd. and Potassa Holdings
Ltd., the paper reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
