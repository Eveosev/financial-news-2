OAO Gazprom (OGZPY)  rose to a two-week high
in  New York  after Interfax said that Russia’s gas export
monopoly plans to set aside about 200 billion rubles ($6.5
billion) a year in 2012 through 2014 to pay dividends.  Gazprom’s American depositary receipts climbed 2.7 percent
to $11.81 at the close of trading in New York, the highest level
since Nov. 16.  Interfax cited an unidentified person familiar with the
Russian gas producer’s budget plans.  “Investors hope that Gazprom is finally turning its face
to them and starts paying more substantial dividends,” Sergey Vakhrameev, senior analyst at IFC Metropol, said by phone from
Moscow. “Gazprom doesn’t usually pay large dividends. Their
dividend yields are historically very low.”  Gazprom  added 3.4 percent to close at 181.40 rubles on
 Russia ’s Micex index. One Gazprom ADR is equal to two ordinary
shares.  To contact the reporter on this story:
