Investment in  Bolivia ’s hydrocarbons
industry reached record levels in 2011, according to state-owned
oil and natural-gas company Yacimientos Petroliferos Fiscales
Bolivianos.  Investment reached $1.05 billion for the year through
November, the company, known as YPFB, said in an e-mailed
statement today. YPFB and its subsidiaries invested $647 million
while companies holding operating contracts with the state spent
$400 million, according to the statement.  Investment in the sector has more than quadrupled since
2005, when it was $247 million, according to YPFB. The tally
includes money spent on refineries as well as exploration and
development of oil and gas fields.  Bolivia ’s proven gas reserves fell to 9.94 trillion cubic
feet, YPFB said in an April 8 statement. That’s a 60 percent
decline from the 25.1 trillion cubic feet estimate of BP Plc’s
statistical review. Bolivia has proven oil reserves of 465
million barrels, according to the U.S. Energy Information
Administration.  YPFB Chief Executive Officer Carlos Villegas said in May
that Bolivia plans to award oil and gas exploration contracts
this year in a bid to lure back foreign investments five years
after President  Evo Morales  seized fields and refineries.  To contact the reporter on this story:
