Morgans Hotel Group Co. (MHGC)  agreed to
operate a 360-room London hotel that will be the first Mondrian
location in Europe as the company expands its management
business.  The hotel will be at Sea Containers on the South Bank near
the  River Thames , New York-based Morgans said in a statement
today. The 412,000-square-foot (38,000-square-meter) office
building is being converted into a mixed-use development, with
the hotel scheduled to open in early 2014.  Morgans, operator of Delano South Beach in  Miami Beach ,
Florida, and Royalton New York, has been selling some properties
and using proceeds to expand its management business. The
company last month acquired control of Light Group, an operator
of restaurants and nightclub bars, for about $46.5 million to
enhance its hotel-management business.  “Sea Containers is an exceptional property in a key
gateway city,” Chief Executive Officer  Michael Gross  said in
the statement. “We believe the Mondrian brand has unique appeal
and significant potential for global expansion."    Morgans plans to invest about $15 million in the London
development, which will be the sixth Mondrian. The hotelier has
a 25-year management agreement and two 10-year extension options
for the property.  To contact the reporter on this story:
