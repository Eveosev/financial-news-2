The world shipping industry may face
the “most dangerous scenario of all” if European banks limit
access to trade finance, restricting commodity traders from
opening letters of credit, ICAP Plc’s shipbroking arm said.  Further curbs on lending so banks can meet capital-ratio
requirements would hurt small and medium-sized companies,
affecting shipping and physical-commodities markets, ICAP
Shipping International Ltd. said in a monthly report e-mailed
today.  “We are concerned that a significant reduction of short-
term credit to the real economy could be the next major step
taken by many banks,” the shipbroker said. “While a short-term
lending crisis may not seem imminent, it is not altogether
impossible.”  ICAP Shipping’s parent company is the biggest broker of
transactions between banks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
