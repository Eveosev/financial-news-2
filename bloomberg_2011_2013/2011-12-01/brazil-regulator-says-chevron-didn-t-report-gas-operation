Chevron Corp. (CVX)  didn’t report to
Brazil’s oil regulator that hydrogen sulfide was mixed with the
crude it was producing at a well in the Frade field off the
coast of Rio de Janeiro, said Magda Chambriard, a director at
the regulator.  The gas was discovered when ANP, as the regulator is known,
started investigating an oil spill at the well last month,
Chambriard said at an event in Rio de Janeiro today, according
to the regulator’s press office.  Chevron said ANP ordered it to close down one of its 11
production wells and four water injection wells at the offshore
field, according to a statement distributed by Business Wire.  “The production well cited by the ANP accounts for less
than 10 percent of Frade’s total production of about 79,000
barrels per day,” Chevron said in the statement.  Chevron was fined 50 million reais ($27.8 million) by
Brazilian environmental authorities for the spill, which
occurred Nov. 7 about 230 miles (370 kilometers) northeast of
 Rio de Janeiro . An estimated 3,000 barrels leaked,  Haroldo Lima ,
head of Brazil’s oil regulator, Agencia Nacional do Petroleo,
said Nov. 22.  The company said in today’s statement that it’s working
with Brazilian government agencies to address issues related to
its operations in the country.  To contact the reporter on this story:
