India ’s rupee strengthened the most
in more than a month after global central banks took steps to
prop up economic growth.  The currency rebounded, following its biggest monthly loss
in almost two decades, as six monetary authorities led by the
U.S. Federal Reserve yesterday made it cheaper to borrow dollars
in emergencies. Two hours before the Fed announcement,  China  cut
the amount of cash that banks must set aside as reserves for the
first time since 2008.  “Sentiment has changed after the central banks acted
yesterday,” said Ravi Ranjit, Mumbai-based chief manager at
Federal Bank Ltd. “The action was just a stop-gap measure and
the underlying issues are far from being resolved.”  The rupee advanced 1.4 percent to 51.4675 per dollar in
Mumbai, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That was the
biggest increase since Oct. 28. The rupee weakened 6.7 percent
last month, the most since March 1992.  The slide in the currency to a record low of 52.73 on Nov.
22 prompted Indian policy makers to take measures to boost the
supply of dollars in the local financial system. The  Reserve
Bank  of India on Nov. 23 eased rules for companies to borrow
abroad and sell foreign currencies through swaps, and raised
 interest rates  on  bank deposits  for Indians living abroad.  Three-month offshore forwards traded at 52.29 to the
dollar, compared with 53.31 yesterday. Forwards are agreements
to buy or sell assets at a set price and date. Non-deliverable
contracts are settled in dollars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
