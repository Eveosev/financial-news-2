Slovnaft AS (SLOVN) , a Slovak refiner
controlled by Hungary’s  Mol Nyrt. (MOL) , will complete a 300 million-
euro ($405 million) petrochemical plant by 2015, boosting its
output of polyethylene.  The plant will enable the sole Slovak refiner to raise the
annual production of polyethylene to 220,000 tons from 178,000
tons now, Chief Executive Officer Oszkar Vilagi said at a press
conference in Bratislava, Slovakia today.  The project is part of the company’s push to increase
output of non-fuel products to lessen its dependency on economic
swings. The new plant will replace the old technology and will
produce 30 kinds of the polymere, enabling the company to lure
new clients.  The refiner, in which Mol holds more than 98 percent,
posted a 30 million-euro loss in the third quarter, compared
with an after-tax profit of 38 million euros a year earlier, as
higher  oil prices  and lower petrochemical margins eroded gains
from an increase in sales. The nine-month after-tax profit
declined to 25 million euros from 26 million euros in the same
period 2011.  Mol fell 255 forint, or 1.4 percent, to 18,465 forint in
Budapest, after gaining 5.2 percent yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
