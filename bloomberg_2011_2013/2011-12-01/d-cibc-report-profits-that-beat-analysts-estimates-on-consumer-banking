Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD)  and  Canadian
Imperial Bank of Commerce (CM) , the first Canadian banks to report
quarterly results, posted profits that beat analysts’ estimates
on higher consumer lending.  Toronto-Dominion,  Canada ’s second-biggest bank, said
fourth-quarter profit rose 58 percent to C$1.57 billion ($1.54
billion), or C$1.69 a share.  Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce ,
the fifth-biggest bank, said profit for the period ended Oct. 31
rose 59 percent to C$794 million, or C$1.89 a share.  The Toronto-based banks boosted earnings on higher revenue
from consumer lending and investment banking, as Canada’s
economy rebounded and home buying surged. Canada’s eight biggest
banks will probably report average profit growth of 12 percent
from a year earlier, Scotia Capital analyst Kevin Choquette said
in a Nov. 18 note.  “The Canadian banks continue to do pretty much the right
stuff,” David Baskin, president of Baskin Financial Services in
Toronto, which oversees about C$400 million including bank
shares, said in an interview before earnings. “Everybody should
be buying them, they’re really cheap.”  A rebound in the Canadian economy is boosting demand for
mortgage and consumer loans at the country’s banks, ranked the
soundest by the  World Economic Forum . Canada’s economy grew at a
3.5 percent annualized pace in the third quarter, led by the
biggest jump in exports since 2004,  Statistics Canada  said
yesterday. The  U.S. economy , in comparison, grew at a 2 percent
annual rate in the period. Canadian spending on housing rose 2.6
percent, the fastest since the start of last year.  Tops Estimates  Toronto-Dominion rose 12 cents to C$73.62 at 9:34 a.m.
trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange, after posting its biggest
gain in 30 months yesterday. CIBC climbed 19 cents to C$73.10.  The earnings growth at Canadian lenders contrasts with
their global peers, which have cut more than 200,000 jobs this
year, eclipsing the 174,000 in 2009, data compiled by Bloomberg
show. Six central banks, including the  Bank of Canada , yesterday
lowered dollar swap rates to ease lending for European banks
suffering from the sovereign debt crisis.  “If you look at the European situation, clearly that’s
something that everyone worries about, in terms of the stability
to financial markets, ultimately to the economies around the
world,” Toronto-Dominion Chief Financial Officer Colleen Johnston said today in a telephone interview. “We’re optimistic
when we look at our model and the strength of our model.”  Excluding one-time items, Toronto-Dominion earned C$1.77 a
share. That exceeded the C$1.54-a-share average estimate of 15
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News. CIBC said it had adjusted
earnings of C$1.87 a share, topping the C$1.80-a-share average
estimate of 16 analysts.  Consumer Lending  Toronto-Dominion’s Canadian consumer profit rose 17 percent
to C$905 million because of higher revenue from personal banking
and auto lending. U.S. consumer lending earnings jumped 16
percent to C$328 million.  The TD Securities  investment-banking  unit profit rose 33
percent to C$288 million while wealth management earnings, which
include TD Ameritrade, rose 28 percent to C$193 million. Profit
for the year was a record C$5.89 billion.  “The market may not give TD full credit, as a couple of
items may cause investors to question the quality of the
earnings,” said  John Aiken , an analyst at  Barclays Capital  in
Toronto.  The bank, which has more branches in the U.S. than it does
in Canada, will have to “work very hard” to meet its “medium-
term” profit growth of 7 percent to 10 percent a year, Johnston
said today.  2012 Outlook  Toronto-Dominion expects “high single-digit” growth in its
Canadian consumer bank and asset-management units next year,
Johnston said. Profit from the U.S. consumer bank and wholesale
businesses may be slower, she said.  CIBC also said that external headwinds are “likely to
continue to be with us in 2012,” Chief Executive Officer Gerald McCaughey said on a conference call today. “The external
environment remains very uncertain.”  CIBC’s profit was higher than a year ago, when earnings
were pared by C$239 million in capital repatriation costs and
losses in a structured credit business. Revenue fell 1.6 percent
to C$3.2 billion.  For the year, CIBC said it earned C$3.1 billion, or C$7.31
a share, up from C$2.5 billion, or C$5.87 in fiscal 2010.  Higher Provisions  Canadian Imperial said it set aside C$243 million for bad
loans, up from C$150 million a year earlier on higher provisions
for its CIBC FirstCaribbean bank and its leverage finance
business in  Europe .  The CIBC World Markets unit earned C$172 million, compared
with a loss of C$56 million a year ago when the unit posted
losses from structured credit trading and corporate loan hedges.
Revenue from corporate and investment-banking businesses more
than doubled.  Canadian consumer lending and business banking profit rose
15 percent to C$580 million on higher revenue in personal
banking and business banking, and lower loan losses.  “We view this as a workman-like result from Commerce in
what was a difficult operating backdrop,” Macquarie Capital
Markets analyst Sumit Malhotra said in a note.  Wealth management profit, which includes mutual fund sales,
rose 20 percent to C$65 million after adding earnings from its
purchase of a 41 percent stake in American Century Investments
from JPMorgan Chase & Co. in August. Its corporate unit, which
includes Caribbean banking, had a C$23 million loss, compared
with a C$3 million loss a year earlier, the bank said.  (Toronto-Dominion will hold a conference call at 3 p.m. Toronto
