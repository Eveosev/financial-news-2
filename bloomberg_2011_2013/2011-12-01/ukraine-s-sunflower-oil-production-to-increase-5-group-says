Ukrainian sunflower-oil production
will rise 5 percent to 3.25 million metric tons in the current
marketing year from the prior period, according to Ukroliyaprom,
which represents local oil processors.  The sunflower-seed harvest will increase 18 percent to
about 8.5 million tons, Stepan Kapshuk, the group’s president,
said in a statement on the website of the Ukrainian Agrarian
Confederation today. The marketing year began Sept. 1.  Sunflower-seed exports probably will come to 500,000 tons
for the year, the statement showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
