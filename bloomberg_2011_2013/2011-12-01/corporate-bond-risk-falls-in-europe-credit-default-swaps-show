The cost of insuring against default
on European sovereign debt fell for a third day after  Spain  and
 France  sold 8.1 billion euros ($10.9 billion) of bonds.  The Markit iTraxx SovX Western Europe Index of credit-
default swaps on 15 governments dropped seven basis points to
361 at 1:30 p.m. in London. Contracts on Spain decreased 26
basis points to 381 and France declined 10 to 190, according to
CMA.  The debt sales added to a rally fueled by a coordinated
effort yesterday by the  Federal Reserve , the  European Central
Bank  and four other central banks to cut the cost of emergency
dollar funding. Spain sold 3.75 billion euros ($5.1 billion) of
bonds, the maximum amount planned, and French borrowing costs
declined in its auction of 10-year notes.  “The auctions helped,” said Harpreet Parhar, a strategist
at Credit Agricole SA in  London . “After yesterday’s
announcement, risk appetite was back on and the auctions were
never going to struggle.”  Swaps on Belgium tumbled 13 basis points to 292, Germany
was 2.5 lower at 95.5 and Ireland fell 27 to 691, while Italy
was 21 lower at 459 and Portugal was down 34 at 1,032. An
increase signals deterioration in perceptions of  credit quality ;
a decline, the opposite.  Corporate Debt  The cost of insuring debt sold by financial companies fell
on speculation the European Union will ease bank funding costs.
The EU may exempt bank debt issued before 2013 from proposals
forcing investors to take losses at failing lenders, said a
person familiar with the plan.  The  Markit iTraxx Financial Index  linked to senior debt of
25 banks and insurers declined 12.5 basis points to 285.5 and
the subordinated gauge was 20 lower at 507. The benchmarks are
down for a fourth day after falling yesterday by the most in
five weeks.  The cost of insuring corporate debt fell for a sixth day.
Contracts on the Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 50 companies
with mostly high-yield credit ratings dropped 14 basis points to
741.5, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. The Markit iTraxx
Europe Index of 125 companies with investment-grade ratings fell
6.25 basis points to 178.25.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($13.5 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer
face value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
