Most U.S.-listed Chinese equities
fell after the nation’s manufacturing contracted for the first
time since February 2009, prompting speculation that the
government needs to take further measures to boost growth.  The Bloomberg China-US 55 Index (CH55BN)  was little changed at
101.09 at the close of trading in New York, with 30 stocks in
the benchmark falling and 23 rising.  Huaneng Power International
Inc. (HNP)  sank on concern over rising costs at electricity producers.
 PetroChina Co. (PTR)  and  China Petroleum and Chemical Corp . declined
as crude retreated.  Focus Media Holdings Ltd. (FMCN)  climbed for a
third day after its third statement denying allegations by short
seller Muddy Waters LLC.  The  Purchasing Managers ’ Index fell to 49.0 in November
from 50.4 in October, the  China  Federation of Logistics and
Purchasing said yesterday. A level below 50 shows contraction.
The figure, the weakest since 2009, backs China’s move to cut
banks’ reserve requirements a day earlier to encourage lending,
HSBC Holdings Plc economist  Frederic Neumann  said.  “The focus is now shifting from inflation to growth in
China,” said Neumann, Hong Kong-based co-head of Asian economic
research at HSBC, in an interview with Bloomberg Television.
“That is where the reserve ratio cut is coming in now. There
might be more following here.”  After the half-percentage-point cut announced Nov. 30., the
Chinese central bank may reduce the reserve ratio for lenders by
another 1.5 percentage points until summer next year, followed
by an interest-rate cut should inflation slow below 3 percent,
Neumann said.  Slower Growth  China, the world’s second-largest economy,  expanded  9.1
percent in the third quarter from a year ago, the least in two
years. The growth will slow to 8.5 percent next year, the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development said in a
Nov. 29 report, down from its May forecast of 9.2 percent.
 Consumer price  increases slowed to 5.5 percent in October from a
three-year high of 6.5 percent in July.  The Standard & Poor’s 500  Index (SPX)  retreated 0.2 percent to
1,244.58 after completing the biggest three-day rally since
March 2009 on Nov. 30. The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  gained 2.3
percent to 2,386.86 while the Hang Seng China Enterprises Index
rallied 8.1 percent yesterday.  Huaneng, the listed unit of China’s largest power producer,
slid 5.7 percent to a one-week low of $20.07 in New York
trading. The shares fell even after the government raised
electricity prices for the first time in six months and said it
will cap the cost of power-station coal in an attempt to reduce
outages in coming months.  Power, Coal Prices  Wholesale rates charged by  power plants  to distributors,
called on-grid tariffs, and retail power prices both increased
from Dec. 1, China’s top planning agency announced a day
earlier. Price gains for contract thermal coal next year will be
limited to less than 5 percent, it said.  The scope of the on-grid prices increase is about 6.8
percent, Lu Rumin, an utilities analyst at China’s Hongyuan
Securities Co. estimated in a report dated Nov. 30.  “Power producers are still facing big challenges in
controlling their costs,” he wrote. “Coal-fired plants are not
very attractive in terms of their relatively high price-to-
earnings ratio.”  Huaneng’s American depositary receipts are  trading  at 21.1
times estimated 2011 profit, compared with 13.2 for the
Bloomberg  index (HSCEI)  for the most-traded Chinese stocks in the U.S.
and 11.3 for the Shanghai benchmark gauge.  PetroChina, Sinopec  The ADRs of PetroChina, the nation’s biggest oil producer,
retreated 0.9 percent to $129.58, after surging 5.6 percent a
day earlier, the most since May 2010. China Petroleum, the
second-largest producer in the country known as Sinopec, lost
0.8 percent to $105.48.  Oil declined for the first day in a week after the Labor
Department said U.S. unemployment claims rose by 6,000 to
402,000 last week and as manufacturing slowed in Europe and
China. Crude futures for January delivery slipped 0.2 percent to
$100.20 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange .  The  ishares FTSE China 25 Index Fund , the biggest Chinese
exchange-traded fund in the U.S., climbed 1.1 percent to a two-
week high of $36.62 yesterday. The Chinese  yuan  strengthened 0.2
percent to 6.3635 a dollar, after falling 0.4 percent in
November, according to the China Foreign Exchange Trade System.  The Shanghai benchmark stock measure is trading at 11.3
times estimated earnings, compared with 14.2 for Indian stocks,
10.5 for Brazilian shares and 5.3 for Russian equities.  Focus Rallies  Focus Media , the Shanghai-based digital advertising
company, climbed 6.4 percent to $19.71. The company has
rebounded 28 percent since Nov. 21, when the shares sank 39
percent after  Muddy Waters  said in a report that Focus
overstated the size of its advertising network and may have
deliberately overpaid for takeovers to mask losses. Focus issued
its third statement denying the allegations on Nov. 30.  Almost 22,000  calls  to buy the Focus’s shares changed hands
yesterday on U.S. options exchanges, 1.9 times the four-week
average and 2.3 times the number of puts to sell.  Investors use options to guard against fluctuations in the
price of securities they own, speculate on share-price moves or
bet that volatility, or stock swings, will increase or decrease.  The short seller’s assertions that Sino-Forest Corp. and
Focus Media lied about their businesses have yet to be proved,
Daniel Arbess, manager of Perella Weinberg Partners LP’s Xerion
funds, said at the Bloomberg Hedge Funds Summit in  New York 
yesterday.  Shanda Interactive Entertainment Ltd, owner of China’s
third-biggest provider of online games, will report financial
results for the third quarter at 10 a.m. Hong Kong time today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
