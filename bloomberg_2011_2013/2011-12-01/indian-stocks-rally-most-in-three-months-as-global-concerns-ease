Indian stocks jumped to a two-week
high, tracking global equities, after measures by six central
banks to boost economic growth stoked speculation the Asian
nation’s monetary authority may pause interest rate increases.  Reliance Industries Ltd. (RIL) , the country’s biggest company,
advanced 2.7 percent.  Sterlite Industries (India) Ltd. (STLT) , the
biggest copper and zinc maker, soared the most in a month.
 Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd. (RBXY) , the biggest drugmaker, climbed after
its copy of the $10.7 billion Lipitor cholesterol pill was
approved for sale in the U.S.  Global equities rallied, with the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index rising 4.3 percent, after the central banks of the U.S.,
Euro region,  Canada , Britain,  Japan  and Switzerland made it
cheaper to borrow dollars in emergencies.  China  cut the amount
of cash that lenders must set aside as reserves for the first
time since 2008, sparking speculation the Reserve Bank of  India 
may not raise rates for an eighth time this year on Dec. 16 as
Asia’s third-biggest economy slows.  “India’s GDP growth is slowing and many investors are
expecting a pause in rate hikes and a cut in credit reserve
ratio to release liquidity,” Nirmal Jain, chairman of India
Infoline Ltd., told Bloomberg UTV in Mumbai.  The BSE India  Sensitive Index (SENSEX) , or Sensex, rose 359.99, or
2.2 percent, to 16,483.45 at 3:30 p.m. in Mumbai, its highest
level since Nov. 16. The gauge has slumped 20 percent this year,
the third-biggest loser among major Asian benchmark indexes, on
a concern a weak rupee, rising borrowing costs and  Europe ’s
crisis will combine to hurt profits.  ‘No Nasty Surprise’  India’s economy  expanded 6.9 percent in the quarter ended
September, matching the median estimate of 24 economists polled
by Bloomberg. Still, that’s the smallest gain since 2009. The
European Union is the nation’s biggest trading partner. One of
the 24 analyst estimated economic growth of 5.6 percent.  “There was no nasty surprise in the GDP number yesterday,
whereas there was a lurking fear that it might come in at 6.5
percent, which most of the gloom and doom prophets were talking
about,”Sanju Verma, chief executive officer of Violet Arch
Capital Advisors, told Bloomberg UTV today. “How things have
changed between yesterday afternoon and now. There’s a Eureka
moment, a sense of relief.”  The  Reserve Bank  of India, which cut its growth forecast on
Oct. 25 to 7.6 percent from 8 percent, has been constrained in
supporting the economy as it struggles with inflation that’s
almost twice the rate in China and higher than in Brazil and
Russia. The rupee slid 6.7 percent last month, the most since
March 1992, fueling inflation and reducing the central bank’s
scope to avoid further rate increases.  ‘Important Role’  “Liquidity plays a more important role than earnings in
India,” Sam Mahtani, a director of  emerging markets  at F&C
Asset Management Plc., said by phone from  London  yesterday. “If
tomorrow the RBI loosens monetary policy, markets would rally
very strongly even though earnings are weak this year.” U.K.-
based F&C manages $5 billion in emerging-markets stocks.  Profits for the 30 Sensex companies may grow 11 percent to
12 percent in the year to March 2013, less than the 17 percent
forecast by analysts, as a weak currency increases the cost of
repaying foreign debt, according to Tata Asset Management Ltd.
Forty percent of Sensex firms reported earnings that missed
estimates in the September quarter, on top of a 47 percent lag
in the three months ended June, according to Bloomberg data.  “The rupee’s slide will contribute as much as 45 percent
to 50 percent to the decline in profits of companies” in the
S&P CNX  Nifty (NIFTY)  Index over the next two quarters, T.S. Harihar,
co-head of institutional derivatives at ICICI Securities Ltd.,
said in a phone interview yesterday.  Rupee Rebounds  The currency rose 1.4 percent to 51.4675 per dollar at the
5 p.m. close in Mumbai, the most in month.  The Nifty advanced 2.2 percent to 4,936.85. The  BSE 200
Index (BSE200)  increased 1.9 percent to 1,989.55.  Reliance surged 2.7 percent to 799 rupees.  Tata Motors
Ltd. (TTMT) , the biggest truckmaker and owner of Jaguar Land Rover,
rallied 5.9 percent to 183 rupees after selling 41 percent more
vehicles in November.  State Bank of India (SBIN) , the nation’s biggest lender, rose 3.5
percent to 1,824.15 rupees. Its nearest rival  ICICI Bank Ltd. (ICICIBC) 
surged 7 percent to 762.15 rupees.  Sterlite added 6.4 percent to 105.65 rupees, its steepest
rally since Oct. 28.  Hindalco Industries Ltd. (HNDL) , the biggest
aluminum producer, surged 6.8 percent to 131.25 rupees, paring
this year’s loss to 47 percent. The London Metal Exchange Index
of prices for six industrial metals soared 5 percent yesterday,
the most since Oct. 24.  Copy-Cat Pill  Ranbaxy rose 2 percent to 443.15 rupees, paring an earlier
gain of as much as 11 percent. The company will make its generic
version of Lipitor, the world’s top-selling drug, in New Jersey,
the Food and Drug Administration said. The pill may generate as
much as $650 million for Ranbaxy in its first 180 days of sale,
according to the median estimate of five Mumbai-based analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg.  Overseas  investors  sold a net  1.82 billion rupees  ($35
million) of Indian stocks on Nov. 29, taking their withdrawals
this year to 28.1 billion rupees, according to the  regulator .
Foreign funds have cut holdings of local shares by $2.4 billion
from a record $104.4 billion in July, contributing to the slide
in equities and the rupee, as investors sold riskier assets on
concern the U.S. and Europe may struggle to curb deficits.  Sensex companies trade at 14.2 times future profits, near
the lowest level since May 2009, according to Bloomberg data.
The  MSCI Emerging Markets Index (MXEF)  trades at 10.3 times.  “Long-term investors will find valuations attractive,”
India Infoline’s Jain said. Still, “the fundamental issues
remain. Investors need to be cautious because we live in a world
where all these tumultuous situations are not going to resolve
in a hurry.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
