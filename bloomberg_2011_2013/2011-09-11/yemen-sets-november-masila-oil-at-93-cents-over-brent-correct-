Yemen raised the price for November
sales of Masila Blend oil to a premium of 93 cents a barrel to
European-benchmark Dated Brent crude, the country’s state oil
committee said.  Masila crude for October sales had been priced at a
discount of 93 cents to Brent, so the November pricing marks an
increase of $1.86 a barrel in the grade.  Yemen priced November shipments of Marib Light grade at
parity with Brent, according to an e-mailed statement today from
the Technical Committee for Crude Oil Marketing. The price
differential for Marib Light hasn’t changed since July 2010.  The Arab Peninsula nation will sell all 2.5 million barrels
of Masila Blend available for November to Unipec U.K., the state
committee said in the e-mail. Aden Oil Refinery Co. will buy all
2.1 million barrels of Marib Light production planned for the
same month.  Yemen has the eight-biggest crude reserves in the  Middle
East , according to data from BP Plc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
