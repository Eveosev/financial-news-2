Citadel Capital SAE, an Egyptian
private equity firm, headed for the highest close in a month
after its unit African Railways Ltd. completed a $70 million
capital increase.  Shares of the Cairo-based company gained 1.9 percent to
4.27 Egyptian pounds at 12:03 p.m. in Cairo, heading for the
highest close since Sept. 10. That gave the company a market
value of 3.5 billion pounds ($585 million). The benchmark  EGX 30
Index (EGX30)  lost 1.1 percent.  The amount raised brings African Railwaysâ€™ paid-in capital
to $110 million, Cairo-based Citadel said in a filing to the
Egyptian bourse. The funds will be used to finance Rift Valley
Railways, a company operating a line in Kenya and  Uganda , it
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
