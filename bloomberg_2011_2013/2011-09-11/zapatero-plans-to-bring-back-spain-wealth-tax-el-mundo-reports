Spanish Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero plans to bring back a tax on wealth ahead of
elections slated for Nov. 20, El Mundo reported without saying
where it got the information.  Under the plan,  Spain  would tax fortunes at 1 percent to 2
percent with the first 600,000 euros ($819,000) being exempt,
the  newspaper said .  Zapatero suppressed a previous version of the wealth tax
three years ago, the newspaper said. The cabinet may approve the
plan at its Sept. 16 meeting, El Mundo said.  A spokeswoman for Zapateroâ€™s office, who asked not to be
identified by name in line with government policy, declined to
comment on the report. She said Jose Blanco, the government
spokesman, said at a news conference last week that the
government had not studied imposing a wealth tax and also had
not ruled it out.  To contact the reporter on this story:
