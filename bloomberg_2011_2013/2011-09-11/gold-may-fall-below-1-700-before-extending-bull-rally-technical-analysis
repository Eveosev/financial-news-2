Gold may decline to below $1,700 an
ounce this month before climbing to an all-time high of $2,000
in October as the metal extends its longest rally in at least
nine decades, according to technical analysts.  Gold’s jump to a record $1,921.15 an ounce on Sept. 6
pushed it to “overbought” levels and the metal may slide to
$1,670 before October, said Ron William, a technical strategist
at MIG Bank. Any slump may halt at $1,650 and the metal may
touch $2,000 next month, Commerzbank AG said, while independent
analyst Jim Stellakis sees prices staying between $1,725 and the
all-time high in the coming weeks.  Bullion is set for an 11th straight annual gain, the
longest winning streak since at least 1920 in  London , as concern
about slowing economic growth spurred investors to diversify
away from equities and some currencies. Gold’s swings in the
past month prompted CME Group Inc. to raise margins on Comex
futures contracts, while the metal’s 10-day historical
volatility is more than double the average so far this year,
Bloomberg data show.  “Gold is an overcrowded trade at the moment going into the
$2,000 psychological barrier,” MIG’s William said by phone from
Neuchatel,  Switzerland . “Such a decline would be consistent
with gold’s long-term bullish cycle and provide a fantastic
buying opportunity into 2012.”  Immediate-delivery gold traded at $1,845 an ounce by 3:45
p.m. in London on Sept. 9, and is up 30 percent this year,
outperforming global stocks, commodities and Treasuries.  Exhausted Momentum  Prices slumped as much as 11 percent in three days after
touching a then-record $1,913.50 on Aug. 23 after Tom DeMark’s
TD Sequential indicator suggested price momentum had been
exhausted, said William. The metal may drop as far as $1,670,
which would be the ceiling of a long-term logarithmic chart, he
said. Still, a sustained close above $1,934 would reduce the
bullish signal, he said, referring to the DeMark strategy.  Gold has dropped on average as much as 28 percent in
“large” setbacks over the past decade or so, and continued its
bull run, said William. A drop of that much from its record
would be about $1,383.  DeMark indicators, named after Tom DeMark who came up with
the concept, are designed to identify market tops and bottoms
and anticipate reversals. In  technical analysis , investors and
analysts study charts of trading patterns and prices to predict
changes in a security, commodity, currency or index. More people
may be turning to charts to help them trade. The Society of
Technical Analysts in July said its membership jumped 60 percent
since June 2002.  Overbought  Gold may be overbought according to tools including moving
average convergence/divergence and stochastic oscillator
indicators, said Stellakis, founder of Technical Alpha, a New
York-based research company. While any extended drop may push
prices to $1,615, which would be about half of the dollar-
measured move from January through the Aug. 23 peak, projected
down from the record, that wouldn’t mean the bull run is over,
he said.  “Over the last couple of months this uptrend has
accelerated,” Stellakis said. Based on performance since 2009,
prices need to stay above $1,500 for that trend to stay intact,
while the metal needs to trade above $1,620 for the accelerated
uptrend since July 2010 to continue, he said.  Gold may climb to the “psychological” level of $2,000
next month, said  Axel Rudolph , a technical strategist at
Commerzbank in London. Any decline would be supported near the
Aug. 25 low of about $1,704 and then $1,650, which may be where
the 55-day moving average would be, he said. Gold will continue
its bull run as long as prices stay above the July low of about
$1,478, he said.  “We’ll have another crisis,” Rudolph said. “I believe
gold will still be a very heavily demanded safe-haven trade.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
