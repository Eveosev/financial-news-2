Oceanic Bank International Plc (OCEANIC)  will
give a stake to state-run Asset Management Corp. of  Nigeria  in
exchange for taking some of the lender’s nonperforming loans.  The Asset Management Corp., known as Amcon, will receive
equity in Oceanic, which signed a deal to be acquired by  Ecobank
Transnational Inc. (ETI) , for taking the bad debt, Nonye Mpho, a
spokeswoman for Oceanic, said in a phone interview from Lagos
today. Amcon will take enough of Oceanic’s nonperforming assets
to “bring the net asset value to zero,” she said.  “This is not a loan write off,” Nonye said, denying a
report in the Lagos-based ThisDay newspaper that Amcon had
written off 290 billion naira ($1.9 billion) non-performing
loans of Oceanic Bank to enable Ecobank to recapitalize it.  Details of the Amcon investments and equity allotments will
be made public soon, she said. Amcon will transfer its holding
in Oceanic to Togo-based Ecobank once the lender’s purchase is
complete, Nonye said.  Oceanic Bank, which was bailed out by the  Central Bank of
Nigeria  in 2009, was among eight lenders whose chief executives
were fired by policy makers after a lending crisis threatened to
collapse some of the country’s financial institutions.  The central bank rescued the lenders with 620 billion naira
and created Amcon to buy nonperforming loans to enable banks to
rebuild balance sheets and resume lending. It gave the banks a
Sept. 30 deadline this year to recapitalize or face liquidation
or nationalization.  To contact the reporter on this story:
