Origin Enterprises Plc , a Dublin-
based agricultural products supplier, received a 400 million
pound ($635 million) takeover offer from an unknown private
equity firm, the Daily Mail reported.  The company, listed in Dublin and  London , is studying the
offer, the paper said, without saying where it obtained the
information. Any deal needs the approval of its major
shareholder Aryzta AG, which holds 71 of Origin, it said.  Origin supplies more than 10,000 farms with agricultural
products, according to its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
