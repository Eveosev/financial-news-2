Yahoo! Inc.’s former Chief
Executive Officer  Carol Bartz  has resigned from the board,
severing the last ties with the  Internet company  after a
tumultuous ouster.  Bartz stepped down as a director on Sept. 9, said Charles
Sipkins, a spokesman for Sunnyvale, California-based Yahoo’s
board. She was fired by telephone three days earlier by Chairman
Roy Bostock, leading Bartz to accuse the board of mistreatment
in a Fortune magazine interview.  Bartz had said to Fortune that she planned to remain on as
a director following her firing as CEO, prompting the board to
issue a statement last week saying she was obligated to resign.
In the same interview, she called her fellow directors
“doofuses” and said they “f---ed me over.”  Bartz, who took over as CEO in January 2009, failed to keep
 Google Inc. (GOOG)  and Facebook Inc. from gaining users and advertising
revenue. Bartz, 63, also rankled investors with her handling of
assets in  Asia , including a stake in Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.
and Yahoo Japan Corp. She feuded publicly with Alibaba Group CEO
Jack Ma, who spun off one of his company’s most valuable assets,
the Alipay payment business, without compensating Yahoo
shareholders until later.  Under Bartz, Yahoo’s stock gained 6.7 percent, compared
with a 34 percent increase for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.
Since Bartz was fired, the shares have climbed more than 10
percent. Yahoo fell 22 cents, or 1.5 percent, to $14.26 at
4 p.m. New York time on the Nasdaq Stock Market.  To contact the reporter on this story:
