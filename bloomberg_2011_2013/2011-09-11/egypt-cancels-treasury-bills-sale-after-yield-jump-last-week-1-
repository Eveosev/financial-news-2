Egypt  canceled an auction of three-
month and nine-month treasury bills today, the second time in
less than three months, after yields surged at local debt
auctions last week.  The government scrapped the sale of treasury bills valued
at 6 billion Egyptian pounds ($1 billion), according to data
posted on the  Finance Ministry ’s  website . Yields on one-year
securities surged 62 basis points, or 0.62 percentage point, to
13.6 percent last week.  The Arab country’s central bank, which holds the auctions
on behalf of the Finance Ministry, cancelled a sale of six-month
and one-year notes in June because investors demanded yields
that were too high, two government officials with knowledge of
the sale said at the time. Officials at the ministry were not
available to comment today.  Egypt’s 5.75 percent 10-year dollar bond due April 2020
advanced, pushing the yield two basis points lower to 5.39
percent on Sept. 9. The pound was unchanged at 5.979 per dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
