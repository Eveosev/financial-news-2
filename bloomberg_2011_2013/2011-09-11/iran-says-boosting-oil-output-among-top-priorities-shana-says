Boosting  Iran ’s crude production is
one of the Oil Ministry’s top priorities, the ministry’s  Shana 
news website reported, citing Oil Minister Rostam Qasemi.  Crude output must increase by 1 million barrels a day by
2013, Qasemi said at a meeting with officials in the southern
city of Ahwaz, according to Shana. Iran, the second-biggest
producer in OPEC, pumped 3.6 million barrels of oil a day in
August, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Steps planned for boosting production include developing
new  oil fields  and deposits that Iran shares with its neighbors,
using secondary methods of recovery such as gas injection and
installing desalination units and other processing facilities,
Qasemi said.  He reiterated his ministry’s plans to sell bonds worth 1
trillion Iranian rials ($94 million) in the current Iranian
calendar year, which started on March 21, to pay for oil
projects, according to the report published yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
