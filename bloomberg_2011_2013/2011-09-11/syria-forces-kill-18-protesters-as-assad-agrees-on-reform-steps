Syrian security forces killed 18
people yesterday, even as Arab League Secretary-General Nabil el-Arabi said President Bashar al-Assad agreed on measures to
implement political changes.  Twelve protesters died in the central region of Homs, three
were killed in and around Damascus, the capital, and three
others were killed in the northern province of Idlib and the
southern area of Daraa, Mahmoud Merhi, head of the Arab
Organization for Human Rights, said today by telephone from
Damascus.  More than 3,100 civilians have been killed in  Syria  since
anti-government protests began in March, according to Merhi and
Ammar Qurabi of the National Organization for Human Rights in
Syria. About 30,000 people have been detained and 13,000 of them
are still being held, the activists estimate.  A political initiative will be presented at a Sept. 13
meeting of Arab foreign ministers in Cairo, Al Arabiya
television cited el-Arabi as saying yesterday, without giving
further details. Assad has blamed the protests on foreign-
inspired plots, while conceding that some demonstrators have
legitimate demands and pledging political changes.  Syrian activists plan to demonstrate again today as they
bury a protester killed at a roadblock in Damascus yesterday,
Merhi said.  The funerals of eight Syrian security and army personnel
were held yesterday after they were killed by “armed terrorist
groups” in Homs and the outskirts of Damascus, state-run  Syrian
Arab News Agency  reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
