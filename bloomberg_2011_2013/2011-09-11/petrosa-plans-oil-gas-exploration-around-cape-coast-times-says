PetroSA Ltd. has applied for a
license to explore for oil and gas around the Cape coast, the
Johannesburg-based  Sunday Times  said, without saying where it
got the information.  The company will submit its environmental management plan
in the next month and could start early exploration work by
February in the 80,000 square-kilometer (34,000 square-mile)
area stretching from Cape Point to Saldanha on the West Coast,
the paper said. It would take five or six years to start test
drilling if seismic tests are promising, it quoted PetroSA
spokesman Thabo Mabaso as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
