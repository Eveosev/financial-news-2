South Africa ’s National
Intelligence Agency Director-General Gibson Njenje has resigned
after months of tense relations with President  Jacob Zuma  and
State Security Minister Siyabonga Cwele, Johannesburg’s  Sunday

surveillance of ministers and other people involved in the

conference next year.  Brian Dube, a spokesman for Cwele, confirmed Njenje’s
resignation, saying he will pursue other interests, the
newspaper reported. Njenje was quoted by the Independent as
saying that he didn’t resign and plans to work tomorrow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
