More than 50 civilians were killed
by the Sudanese army in the Nuba Mountains in the state of
Southern Kordofan, said a spokesman for the  Sudan  People’s
Liberation Movement, an opposition group.  Spokesman Qamar Delman, speaking by telephone from the
regional capital of Juba, said members of Sudan’s armed forces
bombed Abu Gabeiha, a civilian area. The Sudan People’s
Liberation Movement is allied with the government of South
Sudan, which gained independence July 9.  Sudanese army spokesman Al-Sawarmi Khaled didn’t answer
calls to his mobile phone seeking comment.  Southern Kordofan is Sudan’s main oil-producing state, and
Sudan’s government has been trying to disarm fighters there and
in Blue Nile state who fought alongside South Sudan’s forces
during the two-decade civil war.  After South Sudan gained independence, clashes erupted on
June 5 in Southern Kordofan, forcing more than 150,000 people to
flee their homes, according to  Amnesty International  and  Human
Rights Watch .  Southern Kordofan accounts for 115,000 barrels of oil a
day, according to the energy ministry. South Sudan assumed
control of 75 percent of the country’s former daily crude output
of 490,000 barrels a day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
