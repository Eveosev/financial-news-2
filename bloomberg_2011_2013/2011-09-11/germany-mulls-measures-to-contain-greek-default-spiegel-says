The German Finance Ministry is
considering measures to contain the impact from a potential
Greek default on indebted euro-area countries and banks,  Der
Spiegel  reported, without saying where it got the information.  Under the plan, the European rescue fund would provide
bridge loans to indebted countries as well as give financing to
banks affected by a possible restructuring of Greek debt, the
magazine said in an article published in today’s edition.  The ministry is considering two scenarios under which
 Greece  could default, with one involving the country’s exit from
monetary union, the magazine said. Both scenarios would involve
a so-called haircut on Greek debt of 50 percent, according to
 Der Spiegel .  To contact the reporter on this story:
