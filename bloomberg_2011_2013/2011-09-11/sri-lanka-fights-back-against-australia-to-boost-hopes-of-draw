Sri Lanka  reached 223-2 at stumps
on day four of the second cricket Test against Australia,
trailing by 14 runs, as it battles to keep the series alive.  Tharanga Paranavitana and Kumar Sangakkara scored half-
centuries in Pallekele for the hosts, who started the day 237
runs behind after Australia declared overnight in its first
innings on 411-7.  Australia claimed the opener in the three-match contest by
125 runs. It can move above Sri Lanka to fourth in the
International Cricket Council Test rankings by winning the
series.  Paranavitana and captain Tillakaratne Dilshan shared an 81-
run opening partnership before Dilshan slashed the ball to Shane Watson at first slip off the bowling of  Ryan Harris .  Paranavitana was on 55 when wicketkeeper Brad Haddin
appealed for a catch. Umpire Tony Hill turned down the appeal,
but Australia successfully reviewed the decision giving Mike Hussey a wicket.  Sangakkara, 69 runs, and Mahela Jayawardene, 38 runs, were
unbeaten at the close.  To contact the reporter on this story:
