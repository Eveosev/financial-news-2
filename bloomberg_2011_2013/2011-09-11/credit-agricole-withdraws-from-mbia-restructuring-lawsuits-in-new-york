Credit Agricole SA (ACA)  agreed to
withdraw from lawsuits against  MBIA Inc. (MBI)  challenging the bond
insurer’s restructuring.  The French bank discontinued proceedings, according to
stipulations filed Sept. 9 in New York State Supreme Court in
Manhattan. Other banks, including  UBS AG (UBSN) , will continue legal
action against MBIA, according to the documents. No explanation
for the withdrawal was given.  The banks claim the bond insurer’s restructuring, which was
approved by New York’s insurance department, left MBIA
undercapitalized and possibly unable to pay future claims.  Stephanie Ozenne, a spokeswoman for Credit Agricole, didn’t
immediately respond to an e-mail seeking comment after regular
business hours.  The cases are ABN Amro Bank NV v. MBIA Inc., 601475-2009,
and ABN Amro Bank NV v.  Eric Dinallo , 09-601846, New York state
Supreme Court (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
