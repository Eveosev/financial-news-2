The European single currency will
fail unless governments harmonize economic and fiscal policies,
 Bild am Sonntag  reported, citing former German Foreign Minister
 Joschka Fischer .  “The situation in  Europe  really is as serious as never
before,” the newspaper quoted Fischer as saying in an interview
published today. The political, economic and financial
consequences of a failure of the single currency “wouldn’t be
controllable,” the newspaper quoted Fischer as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
