The  Los Angeles Angels  handed the
 New York Yankees  their fourth straight loss and deprived pitcher
CC Sabathia of his 20th win of the season.  Dan Haren held the Yankees to four hits as the Angels shut
out the American League East leader 6-0 last night at Angel
Stadium of Anaheim in Anaheim,  California . Haren (15-8) struck
out seven in his complete game.  Sabathia (19-8) allowed eight hits, one run and four walks
in six innings.  Maicer Izturis hit a run-scoring double in the second
inning, and the Angels added four runs, including a two-run
homer by Jeff Mathis, in the seventh. Torii Hunter had his 20th
home run of the season in the eighth.  Alex Rodriguez , whose performance has been hampered by a
sprained left thumb, was absent from the roster last night.
Yankees manager Joe Girardi told reporters that Rodriguez would
probably miss three to four more days.  Since returning from knee surgery Aug. 21, Rodriguez has
hit .194 as he struggles to grip the bat with his injured thumb.  The Yankees (87-57) retained their 2 1/2 game lead over the
Boston Red Sox (85-60), who also lost their fourth in a row, 6-5
to the Tampa Bay Rays.  To contact the reporter on this story:
