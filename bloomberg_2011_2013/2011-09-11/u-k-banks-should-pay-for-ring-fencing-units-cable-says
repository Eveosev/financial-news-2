U.K. Business Secretary Vince Cable
said British banks should be prepared to pay for the costs
associated with ring-fencing their units against collapse and
shouldn’t delay the reforms.  Writing in the Mail on Sunday, Cable said banks should pay
for the proposed reforms suggested by the Independent Commission
on Banking by cutting remuneration packages and payments to
shareholders.  Banks shouldn’t delay implementing the proposed changes,
Cable said. “The recession is not an excuse for postponing
banking reform,” he said. The proposals could also encourage
banks to lend more to businesses, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
