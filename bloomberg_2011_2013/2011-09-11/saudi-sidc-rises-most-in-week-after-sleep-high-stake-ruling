Saudi Company for Industrial
Development advanced the most in more than a week after the
investor in Jeddah-area manufacturers said it will take over
stakes in mattress maker Sleep High and companies in  Egypt .  The shares rose as much as 3 percent, the biggest intraday
gain since Sept. 3, and traded 1.1 percent higher at 13.50
riyals by 11:38 a.m. in Riyadh.  The Court of Grievances ruled in the company’s favor in a
dispute with a former partner,  SIDC (SIDC)  said yesterday. The partner,
which SIDC didn’t name, has received a letter from the executive
judge of the State Court in Jeddah upholding the ruling and
telling it to hand over the stakes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
