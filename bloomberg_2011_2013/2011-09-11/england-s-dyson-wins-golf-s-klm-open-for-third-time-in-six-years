England ’s Simon Dyson won the KLM
Open for a third time in six years after a final-round 4-under-
par 66 today at Hilversumsche Golf Club in the Netherlands.  The 33-year-old finished on 12-under for the tournament,
one shot ahead of countryman David Lynn, with U.S. Open champion
Rory McIlroy of Northern Ireland on 10-under.  Dyson, who also won the Irish Open this year, has now
recorded  half of his European Tour victories  at this tournament.
The 2006 and 2009 champion collects a check for 300,000 euros
($410,000).  He birdied four of the last seven holes today, while 2004
winner Lynn had an eagle at the 12th in his 2-under round.
Germany’s  Martin Kaymer  failed to make the halfway cut in the
defense of his title.  To contact the reporter on this story:
