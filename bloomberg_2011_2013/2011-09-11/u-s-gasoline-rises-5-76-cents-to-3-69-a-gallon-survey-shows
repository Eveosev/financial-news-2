The average price for regular
gasoline at U.S. filling stations rose 5.76 cents to $3.6669 a
gallon.  The price covers the period from Aug. 26 to Sept. 9 and is
derived from a survey of about 2,500 filling stations nationwide
by Camarillo, California-based  Trilby Lundberg . The average
price is about 36 percent above a year earlier when the average
was $2.6899.  “Gasoline closely followed what crude oil did,” Lundberg
said in a telephone interview today. “WTI crude rose the
equivalent of 4.3 cents per gallon during the period.”  Most of the rise came from higher prices in the Western
states because of refinery glitches in  California , she said.
Demand was down compared with a year ago because of deep
underemployment, she said.  “Demand for gasoline is shrinking aggressively during bad
economic conditions, and, because the current price is nearly 98
cents above the year-ago level, this does add some pain to
gasoline consumers already hurting from reduced employment.”  Gasoline for October delivery on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  dropped to a one-month low of $2.771 on Sept. 9 amid
concern that the U.S. economic recovery is at a standstill and
fuel demand may shrink.  Last week, Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said
policy makers this month will discuss tools they may use to help
the recovery, and President  Barack Obama  proposed a $447 billion
plan to spur job growth.  To contact the reporter on this story:
