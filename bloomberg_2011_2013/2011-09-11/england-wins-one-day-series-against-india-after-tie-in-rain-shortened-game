England  and India tied in their
fourth one-day cricket match yesterday after rain at Lord’s in
London, giving the hosts the victory in the five-match series.  The result means the visitors still haven’t beaten England
on the current tour, which ends in four days in Cardiff.  England was on 270-8 when play was halted, leaving the
hosts a run short of victory by the Duckworth-Lewis scoring
rules, which are used to decide rain-shortened matches. India
reached 280-5 in its 50 overs.  “It was touch and go there at the end,” England captain
Alastair Cook said after the match. “We ended up batting for
the Duckworth-Lewis” total.  England’s  Ravi Bopara  and Graeme Swann were out on
consecutive balls just before play was stopped. Bopara hit a
personal best 96 runs, while Swann was run out on 31.  The hosts had won the toss and put India into bat. Captain
MS Dhoni and  Suresh Raina  combined for a 169-run partnership to
set England a target of 281 runs.  Raina was caught on 84 off the bowling of Steven Finn in
the final over. Dhoni finished unbeaten on 78. Dhoni and Raina’s
partnership was a record for the fifth wicket against England.  Stuart Broad  and Swann each took two wickets for England.
Broad left the field during the last over after appearing to
injure his bowling arm.  The hosts won two straight weather-shortened one-day games
after the series opener was rained out. The series ends on Sept.
16 in Cardiff. England swept a four-match Test series and the
sole Twenty20 match.  To contact the reporter on this story:
