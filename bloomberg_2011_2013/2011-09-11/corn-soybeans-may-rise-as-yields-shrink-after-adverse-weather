Corn and soybeans may rise this
week on speculation that a government report today will show
that hot, dry weather in the past two months reduced U.S.
yields.  Sixteen of 29 traders and analysts surveyed from  Tokyo  to
 Chicago  on Sept. 9 forecast that corn will advance, and 16 of 30
respondents said soybeans will gain.  On the Chicago Board of Trade last week, corn futures for
December delivery fell 3.1 percent to $7.365 a bushel, and
soybean futures for November delivery declined 1.3 percent to
$14.2675 a bushel.  Last weekâ€™s declines were a surprise to the majority of
analysts and traders surveyed on Sept. 2.  Bullish on corn: 16    Bullish on soybeans: 16
Bearish on corn: 13    Bearish on soybeans: 14  To contact the reporter on this story:
