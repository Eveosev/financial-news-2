Bank of America Corp. (BAC)  asked a judge
to dismiss a lawsuit against it and Countrywide Home Loans Inc.
filed by defunct Thornburg Mortgage, now called TMST
Inc., saying the trustee liquidating the firm failed “to state
a claim,” according to a court filing.  Trustee Joel Sher filed eight lawsuits in  bankruptcy court 
in Baltimore in April, seeking money from JPMorgan Chase & Co.
and other banks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
