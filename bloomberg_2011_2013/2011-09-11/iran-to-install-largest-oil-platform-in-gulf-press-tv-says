Iran  plans to next week install a
crude platform in the  Persian Gulf  that will allow the country
to increase its oil production by 75,000 barrels per day, Press
TV reported, citing Amir Panahi, managing director of Tasdid, an
Iranian company involved in the project.  The platform, referred to as P4, will be the largest in the
Persian Gulf, Panahi said without giving details about the
costs. It will be installed in the Reshadat oilfield located 110
kilometers (68 miles) southwest of Lavan Island, according to
the state-run report published yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
