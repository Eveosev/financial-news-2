Hungarian Prime Minister  Viktor Orban  may present some details of a plan to help foreign-
currency mortgage holders in parliament tomorrow, MTI reported,
citing Orban’s spokesman  Peter Szijjarto .  Asked if the government supported the ruling Fidesz party’s
recommendation to allow one-time repayments at fixed exchange
rates, Szijjarto said the party’s lawmakers had made a decision
and the Cabinet must now make its own proposal in accordance
with that, the state-run news service reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
