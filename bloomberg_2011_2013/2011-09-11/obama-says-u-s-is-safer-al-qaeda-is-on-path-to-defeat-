President  Barack Obama  said the
U.S. is safer 10 years after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks and
that al-Qaeda is “on the path to defeat.”  “There are still people out there who would try to hurt
Americans, who would try to strike at us,” Obama told NBC News.
“We have to be constantly vigilant.”  Obama said security agencies have been preparing for months
for the 10th anniversary of the attacks.  “Obviously, each 9/11 we start seeing threat streams
coming up,” Obama said in a taped interview on NBC broadcast
today. “The fact that this is the 10th anniversary means that
we’re seeing more of these.”  One threat was “specific enough and credible enough” that
federal officials determined it was necessary to inform state
and local authorities, Obama said.  Obama’s counterterrorism adviser  John Brennan , speaking
today on the CBS “Face the Nation” program, said “there are
important leads that we need to run to ground,” including
travel data. The threat is specific to  New York  and  Washington 
and “credible” though “not confirmed,” Brennan said today on
“Fox News Sunday.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
