An “orderly insolvency” for
 Greece  must not be ruled out for the sake of stabilizing the
euro,  Die Welt  reported, citing German Economy Minister Philipp
Roesler.  “To stabilize the euro there must be no taboos,” the
newspaper quoted Roesler as saying in an article to be published
in tomorrow’s edition. “If need be, that also includes an
orderly insolvency of Greece, provided the instruments needed
for that are available.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
