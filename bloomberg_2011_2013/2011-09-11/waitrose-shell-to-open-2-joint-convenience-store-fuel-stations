Waitrose Ltd., a U.K. supermarket
chain owned by John Lewis Partnership Plc, will open two trial
Little Waitrose convenience shops inside Royal Dutch Shell Plc
petrol stations in the U.K. this month.  Waitrose will operate the sites and act as an agent for the
sale of fuels in Watford and Bayswater, which will continue to
be owned by Shell, the two companies said in joint statement e-
mailed today. There will be about 30 workers employed at each
site, they said.  Waitrose currently has 23 convenience stores, according to
the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
