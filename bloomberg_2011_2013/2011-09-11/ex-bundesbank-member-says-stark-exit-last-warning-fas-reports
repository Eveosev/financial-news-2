Juergen Stark’s resignation from
the  European Central Bank ’s executive board is the “last
warning” to euro-area governments to stop abusing the ECB as
financier for indebted member states,  Frankfurter Allgemeine
Sonntagszeitung  reported, citing an interview with former
Bundesbank board member Edgar Meister.  “His resignation is a wake-up call, perhaps the last
warning,” the newspaper quoted Meister as saying in an
interview published today. “Politicians must not abuse the
central bank as state financier, otherwise there will be danger
ahead for the ECB itself and for the euro.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
