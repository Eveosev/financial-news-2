The Saudi unit of  ArcelorMittal (MT) ,
the world’s largest steelmaker, expects to start producing in
the first half of 2012 at its new mill at Jubail in eastern
 Saudi Arabia , al-Watan reported.  The $700-million plant will produce 600,000 metric tons of
pipes a year for the oil and petrochemical industry, the Abha-
based newspaper  reported , citing Mohammed al-Jabr,
ArcelorMittal’s managing director in Saudi Arabia. Al-Jabr was
formerly the vice president of Saudi Basic Industries Corp.’s
steel unit, according to the report.  The company plans to invest up to $3 billion in Saudi steel
projects over the next five years and is conducting studies to
build a factory north of Jubail at Ras al-Khair, where the
government is forming a mining hub, al-Jabr told the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
