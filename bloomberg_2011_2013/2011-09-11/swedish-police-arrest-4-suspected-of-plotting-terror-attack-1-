Swedish police arrested four people
suspected of planning a terror attack and evacuated an arts
center in the western city of Gothenberg.  Security services made the arrests yesterday with the help
of local police, Sara Kvarnstroem, spokeswoman at the Swedish
Security Service, said today by telephone. An investigation is
underway, she said, declining to give details. She didn’t say
whether the arrests are linked to the anniversary of the Sept.
11 attacks.  Police cordoned off the Roeda Sten arts center, citing “a
potential threat that entailed danger to life, health or
significant damage to property,” according to a statement on
the police website.  In December, suicide bomber Taimour Abdulwahab, a 28-year-
old Iraqi-born Swede, killed himself and injured two people when
his explosives detonated by mistake in a side alley to a busy
shopping street in central  Stockholm .  To contact the reporter on this story:
