Labour Party leader  Ed Miliband 
said bankers who take unnecessary risks or misrepresent products
to clients should be barred from working in the industry, The
Sunday Times reported, citing an interview.  “Bankers say the era of remorse is over, but that’s not
good enough,” Miliband said, according to the newspaper. “I
think the industry should take some responsibility and strike
off people who do the wrong thing,” Miliband was quoted as
saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
