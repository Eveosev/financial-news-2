South Rub Al Khali Co., a joint
venture between  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  and Saudi Arabian Oil Co.,
named a chief executive to run the company that explores for
natural gas in  Saudi Arabia .  SRAK, a 50-50 venture, appointed Saleh Al-Dawas as CEO, a
company spokesman said in an e-mail. Al-Dawas replaces Kamal al- Yahya, who retired in July.  SRAK is one of four ventures exploring for gas in the Rub
Al Khali desert in Saudi Arabia, which holds the fifth-largest
gas reserves in the world. The venture is the only one of the
four to announce a “promising” discovery.  The venture is expected to complete its second exploration
for natural gas in Saudi Arabia’s southern Rub Al Khali desert
in 2015. It’s currently drilling in the greater Kidan area near
the Saudi border with the  United Arab Emirates .  Before taking his new role at SRAK last month, al-Dawas was
manager of the Production and Facilities Development Department
at Saudi Aramco since May 2006. SRAK said today in an e-mail
that he has 33 years of industry experience working in various
areas of the Saudi Aramco upstream organization.  Al-Dawas graduated from the King Fahad University of
Petroleum and Minerals in 1979 with a degree in petroleum
engineering and was a board member of EniRepsa Gas Ltd., one of
four gas exploration ventures in Saudi Arabia. The venture is
owned by Italy’s  Eni SpA (ENI) ,  Repsol YPF SA (REP)  and Saudi Aramco.  To contact the reporter on this story:
