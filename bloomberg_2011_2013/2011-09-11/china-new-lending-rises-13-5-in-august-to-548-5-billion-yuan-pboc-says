China ’s new lending rose to 548.5
billion yuan ($85.9 billion) in August and  money supply  growth
expanded at the slowest pace in at least six years.  New local-currency lending compared with the 500 billion
yuan median estimate in a Bloomberg News Survey of 26 economists
and 492.6 billion yuan in July. M2, the broadest measure of
money supply, rose 13.5 percent, the People’s Bank of China said
in a statement on its website today. That compared with the 14.2
percent median estimate in the survey and a 14.7 percent gain in
July. It’s the slowest pace since at least January 2005,
according to Bloomberg data.  China may pause on monetary policy tightening as its
economy moderates amid Premier Wen Jiabao’s campaign to cool
inflation and the  property market , and as the outlook for global
growth weakens. China faces a “very complicated, unstable and
uncertain environment both at home and abroad,” and the
government needs to be aware of the risks, Wen said last week.  “There should be no more interest rate hikes this year
given the slowing domestic economy, easing inflation and
deteriorating external growth outlook,” Chang Jian, an
economist at  Barclays Capital  in Hong Kong who formerly worked
for the Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the World Bank, said
before the release. “Yet some selective or targeted easing is
expected in the months ahead.”  The central bank started on Sept. 5 to widen its  reserve
requirements  to include lenders’ margin deposits, a move that
will be phased-in over the next six months and is estimated by
some banks to withdraw 900 billion yuan from the bank system.  The central bank, which has raised  interest rates  five
times since mid-October has increased bank’s reserve requirement
ratio nine times, boosting it to a record 21.5 percent for
China’s biggest banks.  ----Zheng Lifei. Editors: Jim McDonald  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
