Eastern Co. (EAST) , Egypt’s monopoly
cigarettes producer, has delayed a plan to build a factory in
Libya,  Al Mal  reported, citing an unidentified company official.  The company’s profits will decline this year because of tax
increases and sales of smuggled cigarettes, the Cairo-based
newspaper cited the official as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
