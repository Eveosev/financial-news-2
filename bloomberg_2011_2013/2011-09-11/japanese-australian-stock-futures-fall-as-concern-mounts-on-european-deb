Japanese stocks fell for a second
day, with the  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average dropping to its lowest in
almost two and a half years, as exporters and banks tumbled amid
speculation Greece may be nearing default.  Sony Corp. (6758) , which gets 21 percent of its sales in  Europe ,
fell 3.4 percent as the yen’s advance to a 10-year high against
the euro dimmed the earnings outlook.  Mitsubishi UFJ Financial
Group Inc. (8306) ,  Japan ’s biggest lender by market value, declined 2.7
percent on concern Europe’s debt crisis will hurt the global
financial system. Sharp Corp. plunged 5 percent after Mizuho
Securities Co. cut its target price on the maker of flat screens.  The Nikkei 225 fell 2.3 percent to 8,535.67 in Tokyo, the
lowest close since April 2009. The broader Topix slid 1.9
percent to 741.26 as speculation  Germany  is preparing for a
Greek default spurred turmoil in equity markets worldwide.  “Rising default risks in  Greece  are stoking concerns about
the financial system, which makes you think about the Lehman
shock,” said  Mitsuo Shimizu , an analyst at Cosmo Securities Co.
in Tokyo.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index dropped 1.3
percent today. The index fell 2.7 percent on Sept. 9 in  New York 
after three German officials said Chancellor Angela Merkel’s
government is making plans to shore up banks if Greece defaults.
The  European Central Bank  said  Juergen Stark  resigned from the
executive board, suggesting policy makers are divided over how
to fight the debt crisis.  ‘Default Risks’  “As long as Europe is divided, we won’t see a clear
direction about whether Greece will default or be rescued,”
said  Yoshinori Nagano , a senior strategist in  Tokyo  at Daiwa
Asset Management Co., which oversees about $104 billion. “The
Nikkei could extend losses to 8,300 or 8,400. If the U.S. slips
into a recession, the index could fall even further.”  Group of Seven finance chiefs meeting in Marseille, France,
over the weekend vowed to support banks amid growing concern
that Europe’s debt crisis is morphing into a banking crisis.  The Topix has lost about 18 percent this year amid concern
U.S. growth is sputtering and Europe’s debt crisis will damage
the banking system, damping demand in two of Japan’s biggest
export markets. The decline has cut the price of shares on the
index to 0.89 times book value, the lowest since March 2009.  Exporters fell as the yen touched 104.10 per euro today,
the strongest level since 2001. A stronger yen hurts Japanese
exporters because it reduces the value of overseas income.  Exporters, Banks Drop  Sony fell 3.4 percent to 1,504 yen.  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) , the
world’s biggest carmaker, slid 2.1 percent to 2,625 yen. Honda
Motor Co. lost 3.8 percent to 2,259 yen after the carmaker said
it is recalling 310,773 Pilot SUVs to fix seat-belt stitching
that can unravel during a crash.  Japanese banks dropped amid speculation Europe’s sovereign
debt crisis will spread to the financial sector. Mitsubishi UFJ
dropped 2.7 percent to 323 yen.  Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group
Inc. (8316) , the country’s second-largest publicly traded lender, slid
2.4 percent to 2,080 yen.  Mizuho Financial Group Inc. (8411) , the third
biggest, dropped 1.8 percent to 111 yen.  Sharp, Japan’s No. 1 maker of liquid-crystal displays, sank
5 percent to 585 yen after Mizuho Securities cut the company’s
target price to 630 yen from 750 yen. Sharp may have to book an
impairment loss on its Sakai factory, the brokerage said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
