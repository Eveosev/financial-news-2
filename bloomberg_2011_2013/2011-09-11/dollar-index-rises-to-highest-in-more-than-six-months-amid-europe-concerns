The dollar index rose to its
highest level in more than six months on renewed fears that
European policy makers are failing to contain the euro-areaâ€™s
debt problems.  The index climbed to 77.546 at 6:56 a.m. in  Tokyo  from
77.192 in  New York  on Sept. 9. It increased as high as 77.551,
its highest level since Feb. 23. The index tracks the greenback
versus the currencies of six U.S. trading partners.  To contact the reporter on this story:
