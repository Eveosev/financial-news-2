Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS) ,
Britainâ€™s biggest government-controlled bank, is planning to
break up its 37 billion pound ($59 billion) commercial real
estate portfolio, the  Daily Mail  reported.  The assets, ranging from supermarkets to hotels, will be
split into 15 funds as RBS seeks to attract more investors, the
newspaper said, citing an unnamed source. The bank is seeking
partners to take a 50 percent stake in the funds and may receive
interest from private-equity firms, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
