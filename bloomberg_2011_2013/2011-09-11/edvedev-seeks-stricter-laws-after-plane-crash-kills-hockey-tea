Russian President  Dmitry Medvedev 
asked the government to pass laws that would allow authorities
to close down airlines unable to ensure flight safety.  Medvedev requested legislative proposals to strengthen
state supervision of airlines, increase fines and allow for the
closure of carriers without relying on courts to punish any that
violate aviation laws, according to the Kremlin  website . A plane
carrying the Russian hockey club Lokomotiv crashed shortly after
takeoff en route to a game in Minsk, Belarus, on Sept. 7,
killing 43 of the 45 people on board.  To contact the reporter on this story:
