The Australian dollar dropped to
the lowest in almost three weeks against its U.S. counterpart as
concern  Greece  may default prompted investors to sell higher-
yielding assets.  The  New Zealand dollar  declined to a three-week low before
German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  holds talks on the debt crisis
with European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso today in
Berlin. The so-called Aussie and kiwi fell for a third day on
the prospect Asian stocks will extend a global slump in
equities. Demand for  Australia ’s currency was also curbed before
a report that may show the nation’s trade surplus narrowed to
the least in three months in July.  “Unless there’s some major statements from the European
authorities about resolving the debt situation, I think the
euro, Aussie and kiwi will all fall this week,” said  Joseph Capurso , a currency strategist in Sydney at  Commonwealth Bank of
Australia , the nation’s biggest lender.  Australia’s dollar touched $1.0408, the lowest since Aug.
23, before trading at $1.0436 at 9:05 a.m. in Sydney from
$1.0470 in  New York  on Sept. 9. It dropped 0.5 percent to 80.87
yen. The kiwi weakened to 81.96 U.S. cents from 82.21, after
earlier falling to 81.84, the least since Aug. 22. The currency
depreciated 0.5 percent to 63.51 yen.  The Australian and New Zealand dollars may drop as much as
4 percent this week should the European situation deteriorate,
Capurso said.  The MSCI World Index sank 3 percent on Sept. 9 while the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index of U.S. stocks lost 2.7 percent.  Greek Default Risk  Officials in  Germany ’s government are debating how to shore
up the country’s banks in the event that Greece fails to meet
the budget-cutting terms of its aid package and is unable to get
a bailout-loan payment, three coalition officials said Sept. 9.
The move capped a week of escalating German threats that Greece
won’t get the money unless it meets fiscal targets and investors
raising bets on a default.  Australia’s exports exceeded imports by A$1.9 billion
($1.98 billion) in July, compared with a A$2.05 billion surplus
in June, according to the median estimate of economists surveyed
by Bloomberg News ahead of today’s data release. That is the
least since April.  To contact the reporters on this story:
