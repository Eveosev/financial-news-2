The ferry that sank off  Tanzania ’s
coast, leaving 240 people dead, was probably overloaded,
Zanzibar Police Commissioner Musa Ali Musa said.  The MV Spice Islander sank at about midnight on Sept. 9
while en route to Pemba Island, 50 kilometers (31 miles) north
of Zanzibar’s main island of Unguja, Musa said in a phone
interview today from Zanzibar City. At least 607 people survived
the incident, he said.  “The capacity of the ferry was 500 people,” Musa said.
“Early investigations show that the ship was overloaded, which
may have been the cause of the accident.”  A team of rescue workers that includes the Tanzanian army
is continuing to search for victims, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
