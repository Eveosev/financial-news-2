Brazil â€™s government may retake
control of almost 1,700 kilometers (1,060 miles) of railways as
other rail lines undergo renovation, O Estado de S. Paulo
reported.  The National Transportation Agency, known as ANTT, received
proposals from rail operators to renovate 5,500 kilometers of
abandoned tracks, the newspaper said. Companies said six
stretches are no longer economically viable, Estado reported.  In some cases, the ANTT may hold new auctions to award the
concessions for the areas, Estado said. The projects would boost
capacity along railroads in Brazil, where only 10 percent of the
network is fully utilized, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
