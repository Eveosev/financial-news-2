A French yachtsman was killed by
Somali pirates last week, while his wife was rescued by the
Spanish Navy.  Spanish warship SPS Galicia yesterday intercepted a skiff
carrying Evelyne  Colombo  toward the Somali coast, freeing her
and capturing seven suspected pirates, the European Union’s
anti-piracy fleet said in a statement today. The European
mission said previously that a yacht owned by the French couple
was found empty off the coast of Yemen on Sept. 8 by German
frigate FGS Bayern.  Christian Colombo was killed during the pirates’ assault
and his body dumped overboard, Agence France-Presse reported
today citing family members who’d been informed by French
officials. The French foreign ministry didn’t respond
immediately to messages seeking comment, and the EU fleet said
it would put out a statement later today.  Last week a Danish family of five, including three
children, plus two crew members were released by Somali pirates
who had held them seven months for ransom.  Somali pirates are holding 50 ships and 528 hostages,
according to environmental group Ecoterra.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
