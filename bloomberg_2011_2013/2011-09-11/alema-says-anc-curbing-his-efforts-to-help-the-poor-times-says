South Africa â€™s ruling  African
National Congress  postponed disciplinary hearings against  Julius Malema , the leader of its youth wing, until Sept. 13, the party
said in an e-mailed statement.  The delay was granted to accommodate the Equality Court,
which is expected to rule on a speech case involving Malema in
Johannesburg tomorrow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
