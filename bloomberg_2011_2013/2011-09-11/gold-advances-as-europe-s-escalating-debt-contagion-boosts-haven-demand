Gold futures fell for the first
time in three sessions as some investors sold the metal to cover
losses in equities that dropped on concerns that the European
debt crisis is escalating.  Stocks slumped globally on speculation that German
Chancellor Angela Merkel is preparing for a Greek default,
leaving a gauge of global equities poised for a  bear market . The
dollar climbed to the highest level in more than six months
against six major currencies. Gold touched an all-time high of
$1,923.70 an ounce on Sept. 6 and today set records priced in
euros and Swiss francs.  “The margin clerks will be sharpening their knives today
and will take dead aim even upon gold if that is where they
think they can find liquidity,”  Dennis Gartman , an economist
and the editor of the Suffolk, Virginia-based Gartman Letter,
said in his daily report. Some investors “will argue that gold
will prove valuable and will hold its value even as stock prices
plunge, and in the long run they may well be right.”  Gold futures for December delivery fell $46.20, or 2.5
percent, to settle at $1,813.30 at 1:30 p.m. on the Comex in  New
York . The price rose 2.3 percent in the previous two sessions.  The metal is in the 11th year of a  bull market , the longest
winning streak since at least 1920 in  London , as investors seek
to diversify away from equities and some currencies. Gold is up
28 percent this year, beating global stocks, commodities and
Treasuries. The MSCI All-Country World Index of shares fell as
much as 2.5 percent today, extending its drop from its 2011 high
to 21 percent.  Germany’s Banks  Merkel’s government is debating how to shore up German
banks in the event that  Greece  fails to meet the budget-cutting
terms of its aid package and is unable to get a bailout-loan
payment, three officials in Merkel’s coalition said on Sept. 9.  BNP Paribas SA, Societe Generale SA and Credit Agricole SA,
 France ’s largest banks by market value, may have their credit
ratings cut by Moody’s Investors Service as soon as this week
because of their Greek holdings, two people with knowledge of
the matter said.  “While gold is capable of rallying in the face of a strong
dollar, an extended upward move in the dollar does put some
obstacles in its path,”  Edel Tully , a London-based analyst at
UBS AG, wrote in a report. Still, “gold should benefit from the
scaling back of risk appetite on what appear to be rising fears
of a Greek default, contagion to the rest of the periphery, and
the impact on banks.”  Gold exchange-traded-product holdings rose on Sept. 9 for
the first time since Aug. 30, gaining 11.8 metric tons to
2,149.8 tons, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Assets reached a
record 2,216.8 tons on Aug. 8.  Silver futures for December delivery slipped $1.407, or 3.4
percent, to $40.217 an ounce on the Comex.  Platinum futures for October delivery dropped $28.50, or
1.6 percent, to $1,809.40 an ounce on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . Palladium futures for December delivery lost $27.25,
or 3.7 percent, to $711.35 an ounce.  Spot gold at $1,815.30 was $7.30 an ounce above spot
platinum at 5 p.m. The 2010 average price for platinum was $386
above gold.  To contact the reporters on this story:
