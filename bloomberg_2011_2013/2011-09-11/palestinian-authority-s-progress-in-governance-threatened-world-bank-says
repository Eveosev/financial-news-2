The Palestinian Authority’s
“substantial progress” in a two-year campaign to build
institutions of statehood is threatened by delays in foreign aid
and Israeli security restrictions, the  World Bank  said.  Palestinian governing mechanisms “compare favorably to
other countries in the region and beyond,” the Washington-based
World Bank said in a report released today. Still, economic
growth has been “primarily donor-driven” and the private
sector “remains stifled due to Israeli restrictions on access
to natural resources and markets,” the bank said.  The report will be presented to a Sept. 18 meeting of donor
nations, which is scheduled to be held in New York days before
Palestinian leaders ask to be recognized as a state by the
United Nations.  Economic growth in the  West Bank  and  Gaza Strip  is slowing,
forcing the  International Monetary Fund  to revise its 2011
forecast for real growth in gross domestic product to 7 percent
from 9 percent, the World Bank report said.  The authority has borrowed more than $1.1 billion from
Palestinian banks, about 13 percent of their total assets,
according to the report.  Prime Minister Salam Fayyad said in July that the
authority had entered a financial crisis and could not pay full
salaries to civil service employees because banks would not lend
it more money and donor states hadn’t fulfilled their pledges.  The authority plans to pay August salaries a week late on
Sept. 15 after two months of erratic paychecks, spokesman
 Ghassan Khatib  said Sept. 10.  To contact the reporter on this story:
