Rolls-Royce Motor Cars is aiming
for record deliveries this year and may sell more vehicles than
the 2,711 that were sold in 2010,  Euro am Sonntag  reported,
citing Chief Executive Officer Torsten Mueller-Oetvoes.  The luxury-car maker, a unit of  Bayerische Motoren Werke
AG (BMW) , remains unconcerned about the effects from a possible
slowdown of the world economy and continues to see “large
additional potential” in  Russia , the newspaper quoted the CEO
as saying in an interview published today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
