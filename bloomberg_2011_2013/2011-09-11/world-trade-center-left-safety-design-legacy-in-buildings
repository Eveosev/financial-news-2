The shock of the Sept. 11, 2001,
attacks pushed security and safety to the forefront in designs
of high-rise and civic buildings from  Manhattan  to Beijing.  Architects added wider stairwells for emergency evacuation
and shatter-resistant glass to the face of office blocks.
Sidewalks became collapsible, and closed-circuit TV and stricter
access control are now common at many new, secured buildings.  The  National Institute of Standards and Technology  spent
six years investigating the structural causes of the collapse of
the World Trade Center and nearby Building 7, resulting in 40
changes to International Code Council guidelines that are the
foundation for building codes in the U.S.  Setbacks from the street, “hardened” perimeters, bollards
and low-rise obstacles and ventilation and water improvements
are among the post-9/11 advances in building safety and design.
The costs of security enhancements increase according to the
value of the interior contents.  Designing a building from scratch can incorporate the
latest practices and is generally “more clever” than
retrofits, says Rob Rogers, principal at Rogers Marvel
Architects.  “There can be a fairly significant cost increase if you
need more land, distance things from the curb and traffic or
make greater use of cameras and technology,” says Paul Danna,
architecture principal at Los Angeles-based AECOM Technology
Corp., which managed the Pentagon’s $1.3 billion renovation and
upgrade. “Now a lot of thinking is going into how to
accommodate these measures without giving a civic project the
feeling of a fortress.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
