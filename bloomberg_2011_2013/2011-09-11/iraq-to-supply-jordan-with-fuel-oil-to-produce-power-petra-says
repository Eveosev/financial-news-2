Iraq agreed to provide Jordan with
30,000 metric tons of  fuel oil  each month for the generation of
electricity, the state-run Petra news agency reported, citing
Jordanian and Iraqi officials.  Supplies will begin after the Jordan Petroleum Refinery Co.
signs the required contracts, Petra said today, citing Iraqi Oil
Minister Abdul Karim al-Luaibi. Jordan, which imports almost all
of its energy needs, has been forced to switch its  power plants 
to burning more expensive heavy fuels such as gasoil and diesel
because of interruptions in Egyptian gas shipments this year due
to sabotage.  To contact the reporter on this story:
