Nate weakened as the storm moved
over  Mexico  with heavy rains and has been downgraded to a post-
tropical system, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said.  Seven oil rig workers were found alive in a lifeboat in the
 Gulf of Mexico  while two died and one remains missing,  Petroleos
Mexicanos  said.  The remnants of Nate were about 75 miles (120 kilometers)
west-southwest of Tuxpan, Mexico, with maximum winds of 30 mph,
the NHC said in its final advisory for the storm.  The Mexican Navy found seven of the 10 missing oil rig
workers and transferred them by helicopter to Carmen City, Pemex
said in a statement. In a conflicting report, Heliservicio De
Campeche, an airlifting contractor, said 10 workers were found
alive.  Tropical Storm Maria moved further from the northeastern
Caribbean with 60 mph winds and was 165 miles north of  Puerto
Rico , the center said today in a separate  advisory . The storm
was headed northwest at 9 mph.  A gradual turn toward the north is expected the next couple
days, the NHC said. “The center of Maria will continue moving
away from the islands of the northeastern Caribbean and pass
well east of the southeastern Bahamas.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
