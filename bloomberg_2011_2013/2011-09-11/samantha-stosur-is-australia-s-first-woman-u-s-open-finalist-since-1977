Samantha Stosur joined Australian
women’s tennis champions such as Margaret Court and Evonne Goolagong Cawley by reaching the  U.S. Open  final.  Stosur, 27, seeded ninth, advanced to tonight’s
championship match against  Serena Williams  of the U.S. by
winning 6-3, 2-6, 6-2 yesterday in the semifinals against
unseeded German Angelique Kerber.  Williams, a three-time U.S. Open champion seeded 28th this
year after two injury-marred seasons, reached the final with a 
6-2, 6-4 win against top-seeded  Caroline Wozniacki  of  Denmark .  Stosur, a native of Brisbane in Queensland State, will be
the first Australian woman to play in the final in New York
since Wendy Turnbull in 1977, a year before the U.S. Open moved
to the National Tennis Center.  “To now be in that same round as those guys who were able
to win and make Grand Slam finals, I can’t even describe it,”
Stosur said in a news conference. “To have my name up against
those women is quite amazing.”  Goolagong, a seven-time Grand Slam singles champion, lost
in the U.S. Open final every year from 1973-1976. The last
Australian woman to win a U.S. Open title was Court in 1973, who
claimed the last of her record 24 women’s major singles titles
when the tournament was held on grass at the West Side Tennis
Club in Forest Hills,  New York .  At least one Australian woman was in the U.S. Open final in
eight of the nine years from 1969 to 1977 -- Court in 1969 and
1970, Kerry Reid in 1972, Court and Goolagong in 1973, Goolagong
in 1974-1976 and Turnbull in 1977.  French Open  Stosur will be playing in her second Grand Slam final,
having finished as runner-up to Francesca Schiavone of  Italy  at
the 2010 French Open. She knew during the final at  Roland Garros 
that she was trying to end a long streak without an Australian
women’s title in a major tournament.  Goolagong is the last Australian woman to capture a Grand
Slam title, in 1980 at Wimbledon.  “Obviously, I went through those records when the  French
Open  happened,” Stosur said. “Now it’s kind of that same thing
all over again. So it would be fantastic if I could do that and
break that drought and set a new record, I guess.”  Stosur, who reached the WTA tour’s No. 1 ranking in doubles
in February 2006, was sidelined for 10 months after getting Lyme
disease in July 2007 and didn’t return to the women’s circuit
until June 2008.  Career Record  Williams, a 13-time Grand Slam champion, has a 4-2 career
record against Stosur, including a 6-4, 6-2 win in mid-August in
Toronto. They’ve split two meetings at Grand Slams, with
Williams winning in the fourth round at the 2010 Australian Open
and Stosur winning 6-2, 6-7 (2-7), 8-6 in the 2010 French Open
quarterfinals.  “The one good thing is that one of the matches I beat
Serena was actually in a Grand Slam,” Stosur said. “So I think
that’s obviously a big confidence booster to know that I have
been able to do it in a major tournament.”  Stosur is “underrated as a fighter because she always
comes back when she’s down,” Williams said at a news conference
yesterday. “She’s playing great. She’s such a great player and
a great athlete and a nice girl.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
