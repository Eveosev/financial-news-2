The dollar fell against the yen and
euro after U.S. employers added fewer jobs than forecast in
March, reviving bets the  Federal Reserve  will increase stimulus,
or quantitative easing, which may debase the currency.  The 17-nation euro posted its biggest weekly drop in 11
months against the yen as Spain’s rising borrowing costs fueled
concern that the region is failing to contain its debt crisis.
Currencies of commodity-exporting countries fell as speculation
the U.S. economic recovery is faltering overshadowed the
prospect of further Fed easing. The currencies of Mexico and
Canada, whose biggest trade partner is the U.S., weakened.  “Dollar-yen is trying its best to do a nose dive,” said
 Sebastien Galy , a senior foreign-exchange strategist at Societe
Generale SA in New York. “The payrolls number will reinforce
people looking for the quantitative-easing argument.”  The dollar weakened 1 percent to 81.57 yen at 12:14 p.m. in
 New York , touching the lowest level since March 8. It fell 0.2
percent to $1.3089 per euro. The shared currency lost 0.8
percent to 106.77 yen, extending its weekly decline to 3.4
percent, the most since May.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell 1.1
percent. Australia’s dollar rose 0.1 percent to $1.0312 and
South Africa’s rand fell 0.6 percent to 7.8848 per dollar.  Jobs Data  Nonfarm payrolls increased by 120,000 last month, the
smallest increase in five months, the Labor Department reported
today. Economists had forecast an addition of 205,000, according
to the median of 75 estimates in a Bloomberg News survey. The
 unemployment rate  fell to 8.2 percent, the lowest since January
2009.  The  Dollar Index (DXY) , which Intercontinental Exchange Inc. uses
to track the greenback against the currencies of six U.S. major
trading partners, lost 0.3 percent to 79.866.  Mexico’s peso fell the most against the dollar among the 16
major currencies tracked by Bloomberg, dropping 0.9 percent to
12.9899. Canada’s dollar weakened 0.4 percent to 99.72 cents per
 U.S. dollar .  While the Federal Open Market Committee, led by Chairman
Ben S. Bernanke, has pledged to keep its  interest rate  at a
record low of zero to 0.25 percent through 2014, it’s holding
off on increasing monetary accommodations unless the U.S.
economic expansion falters or prices rise at a rate slower than
its 2 percent target, according to minutes of the central bank’s
March 13 meeting released April 3.  Fed View  “It’s not a green light for Mr. Bernanke to announce QE3
tomorrow, but it certainly says that the conditions under which
some FOMC members will be pushing the case for further easing
measures are falling into place,” said Ray Attrill, a senior
currency strategist at BNP Paribas SA in New York.  The Fed bought $2.3 trillion of securities in two rounds of
quantitative easing from December 2008 to June 2011.  Spain , the euro-region’s fourth-largest economy, is in
“extreme difficulty,” Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy said April
4, raising the possibility of a bailout for the second time this
week. Spanish bonds fell yesterday, pushing the yield on the  10-
year benchmark bond  to as high as 5.84 percent today, the most
since December, and widening the spread with similar-maturity
German bunds to more than 4 percentage points.  The yield on Spain’s 10-year benchmark bond has jumped
nearly one percentage point since March 2, when Rajoy announced
the government would miss its budget-deficit target this year.
He warned that public debt will surge to a record 79.8 percent
of GDP this year as it imposes the deepest austerity in at least
three decades.  European Conditions  German exports probably decreased 1.2 percent in February
from January, when they rose 2.4 percent, according to the
median estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg News before
the report due on April 10. In  France , output increased 0.2
percent in February, after gaining 0.3 percent the prior month,
another poll showed before the nation’s statistics office
releases data the same day.  The euro has declined 1.2 percent in the past week, the
worst performance among the 10 developed-nation currencies
tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The yen has
gained 2.7 percent and the dollar has appreciated 1 percent.  Markets in  Hong Kong ,  Australia ,  New Zealand ,  Singapore  and
 India  are closed today for a public holiday.  To contact the reporters on this story:
