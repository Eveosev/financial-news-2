Asian  stocks  fell, with the regional
benchmark index extending a weekly drop and falling to its
lowest level in a month, as slowing German factory output fueled
concern  Europe ’s economy is contracting.  Sony Corp. (6758) , which depends on Europe for a fifth of sales,
lost 2 percent in Tokyo as the euro weakened, damping the
earnings outlook for the exporter. Hynix Semiconductor Inc. fell
2 percent in Seoul after a report it may bid for bankrupt
chipmaker Elpida Memory Inc. Astellas Pharma Inc. rose 3.2
percent on speculation the Japanese drugmaker’s new treatment
for overactive bladders will be approved by U.S. regulators.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index fell 0.3 percent to 124.90 as
of 3:56 p.m. in Tokyo. For the week, the measure is down 1.4
percent, the biggest weekly decline since the period ended Dec.
16.  Japan ,  South Korea  and Taiwan were the only major markets
open in the region. Volume on Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average
was about a quarter percent below the 30-day intraday average
ahead of a jobs report in the U.S. today.  “Europe’s economy isn’t looking good,” said Kazuyuki Terao, chief investment officer of RCM Japan Co. “Europe’s
economy faces a downside risk, and it remains to be seen whether
it will spread across the world.”  Nikkei, Kospi  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index rose 10 percent this year
through yesterday amid signs the  U.S. economy  is recovering.
Gains slowed after  China  last month cut its target for economic
growth, seeking to cool its  property market  and become less
reliant on exports. The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPXL1)  advanced 11
percent since Dec. 30. The Stoxx Europe 600 Index gained 5.9
percent.  Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average fell 0.8 percent after the
euro dropped to a four-week low against the yen yesterday,
cutting the value of some overseas earnings for some Japanese
companies. A gauge of volatility on the measure rose 0.5 percent
to 19.95, indicating traders expect a swing of about 5.7 percent
over the next 30 days.  South Korea’s Kospi Index was little changed, with an index
tracking volatility on the gauge’s core stocks falling 2.6
percent to its lowest level since April 1.  The Shanghai Composite Index, which tracks the bigger of
China’s two main stock exchanges, slipped less than 0.1 percent.
The  Taiwan  Taiex Index rose 0.9 percent. Markets in  Hong Kong ,
 Singapore ,  Australia  and  India  were closed today for public
holidays.  Futures on the  S&P 500 Index  added 0.2 percent today before
a report expected to show the U.S. economy added more than
200,000 jobs in March for a fourth consecutive month, the
longest streak of similar increases since 2000. The gauge
slipped 0.1 percent yesterday.  Europe Concern  Asian stocks fell today after German industrial  production 
fell 1.3 percent in February, more than twice as much as
economists’ estimates. Shares also dropped after Spanish bond
yields rose to their highest compared with German debt, and
French borrowing costs rose at a bond auction, adding to concern
the debt crisis is spreading.  Exporters to Europe declined, with Sony sliding 2 percent
to 1,634 yen.  Nintendo Co. (7974) , a Japanese maker of game players
that gets a third of its sales in Europe, dropped 2.1 percent to
12,100 yen.  “Investors are getting cautious again about European debt
issues,” said  Kiyoshi Ishigane , a Tokyo-based strategist at
Mitsubishi UFJ Asset Management Co., which oversees the
equivalent of $70 billion. “The debt problem is weakening the
euro against the yen.”  North Korea  Defense contractors retreated in  Seoul  after surging
earlier this week amid heightened tension on the Korean
peninsula.  North Korea  said last month it would test a long-
range rocket between April 12 and 16 to carry a satellite into
orbit. The Chosun Ilbo newspaper reported North Korea appears
ready to put a rocket on a launchpad today or tomorrow.  Speco Co., which makes fin stabilizers for naval ships,
plunged 14 percent to 3,390 won after gaining 37 percent in the
previous three days. Huneed Technologies, a maker of radio
frequency walkie-talkies, fell 5.9 percent to 4,000 won,
trimming its advance this week to about 7 percent.  Stocks in the MSCI Asian Pacific benchmark are  valued  at
1.4 times book value, compared with 2.3 times for the S&P 500
and 1.4 times for the Stoxx Europe 600, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Steelmakers Drop  Japanese steelmakers fell after Kobe Steel Ltd. posting a
20 billion yen ($243 million) loss for the year through March
that was twice as big as forecast. Japan’s fourth-biggest maker
of the alloy lost 3.1 percent to 127 yen. Nippon Steel Corp.,
the No. 1 producer, declined 2.8 percent to 212 yen.  Hynix Semiconductor dropped 2 percent to 29,250 won after
the Nikkei newspaper reported the South Korean chipmaker may
make a joint bid with Toshiba Corp. for bankrupt Elpida Memory.
Toshiba slipped 1.1 percent to 349 yen.  Among shares that rose, Astellas Pharma rose 3.2 percent to
3,360 yen after the drugmaker’s mirabegron treatment for
overactive bladders won the backing of advisers to U.S.
regulators. The drug is the first in a class of treatments for
sudden urination-urge conditions that affect 42 million people
in the U.S., Tokyo-based Astellas said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
