Isiah Thomas  was fired as the men’s
basketball coach at  Florida International University  after his
team went 8-21 last season.  Thomas, who went 26-65 in three seasons at Miami-based FIU,
won’t return because the school has “decided to take the
program in a different direction,” Pete Garcia, FIU’s executive
director of sports and entertainment, said yesterday in an e-
mailed statement.  The Panthers went 7-25 in their first season with Thomas as
coach, followed by an 11-19 campaign in 2010-11.  “This is the most surprising thing that has happened to me
in basketball,” Thomas told ESPN. “I’m just stunned.”  Thomas, 50, a National Basketball Association Hall of
Famer, was fired as president and coach of the  New York  Knicks
in 2008.  In August 2010 he was re-hired as a consultant to the
Knicks before saying a week later that he wouldn’t take the job
amid questions about whether his appointment would violate NBA
rules because he was still a college coach.  New York never had a winning season in the four years
Thomas was in control of the team, including the final two in
which he was also its coach. He was relieved of his duties as
team president in April 2008 and fired as coach later that month
after the team went 23-59 to tie a franchise mark for losses in
a season.  The Knicks are currently playing under interim coach  Mike Woodson  following the March 14 resignation of  Mike D’Antoni , who
replaced Thomas in 2008.  Thomas, a point guard, played 13 years for the  Detroit
Pistons , averaging 19.2 points and 9.3 assists for his career. A
12-time All-Star, his 9,061 career assists are the seventh most
in NBA history.  To contact the reporter on this story:
