Portugal will maintain its austerity
program after the  International Monetary Fund  said the country
should relax the measures if its recession worsens,  Die Welt 
reported, citing an interview with Prime Minister  Pedro Passos Coelho .  “Saving is no vicious cycle,” he was cited as saying.
“Our measures are just a consequence of the imbalance that
we’ve built up since 1995. The current contraction of the
economy proves that we have brought on this disease ourselves.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
