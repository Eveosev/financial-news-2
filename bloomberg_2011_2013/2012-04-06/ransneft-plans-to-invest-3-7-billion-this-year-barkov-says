OAO Transneft (TRFP) ,  Russia ’s oil pipeline
operator, plans to invest 107.8 billion rubles ($3.7 billion)
this year, company Vice President Mikhail Barkov said.  Investment plans will be negatively affected if the
government passes an Economy Ministry proposal that would
require state-controlled companies to pay out at least 25
percent of profit as dividends, Barkov told reporters today at a
Moscow conference.  “It would lower the investment program,” Barkov said,
referring to the ministry proposal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
