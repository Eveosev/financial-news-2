Azeri security forces clashed with
gunmen today, leaving two dead and four injured, the government
said, adding that the armed group planned terrorist attacks.  A law-enforcement officer and a gunman were killed in the
fighting in Ganca, about 400 kilometers (249 miles) west of the
capital, Baku, the National Security Ministry said in an e-
mailed statement today, confirming an earlier report by the APA
news service. Seventeen people were detained across the country,
it said.  The militants were members of a radical Islamic group, the
independent Turan news service reported today. Officers
confiscated guns, ammunition and books promoting terrorism
during raids, according to the ministry’s statement.  Azerbaijan, a Muslim country that’s the third-largest oil
producer in the former  Soviet Union , borders  Russia ’s volatile
North Caucasus region, where the government has been battling an
Islamic insurgency for the past 20 years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
