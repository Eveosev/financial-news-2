A Tunisian court sentenced two men
to seven and a half years in prison for publishing caricatures
of Islam’s  Prophet Muhammad  on Facebook that were deemed
offensive.  Jabeur Mejri and Ghazi Beji were convicted of
“transgressing morality, defamation and disrupting public
order,” the Justice Ministry said in a faxed statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
