OAO Magnitogorsk Iron & Steel (MAGN) ,
Russian billionaire Victor Rashnikov’s steelmaker, asked a
regional court to lift restrictions on its right to buy  Flinders
Mines Ltd. (FMS) , according to a filing with the court.  The Russian steelmaker’s acquisition of the Australian iron
ore miner for A$554 million ($570 million) was blocked by the
Chelyabinsk arbitration court on March 30 at the request of
Elena Egorova, who holds less than 0.001 percent of MMK, as the
Magnitogorsk-based company is called. Egorova claimed the deal
infringes on her interests as a shareholder, the company said
April 3.  Kirill Golubkov, a spokesman for MMK, confirmed the
company’s filing.  The deal was scheduled to close by April 18 after gaining
approvals from an Adelaide court. The Australian has delayed its
decision because of Egorova’s claim.  MMK’s board postponed a decision on taking a loan from OAO
Gazprombank to pay for Flinders, according to a regulatory
filing today from the steelmaker.  To contact the reporter on this story:
