China’s stocks  rose, capping the
benchmark index’s first weekly gain in a month, on speculation
the central bank will ease monetary policy to bolster economic
growth and foreign investors may buy more equities.  Citic Securities Co. rallied for a second day, leading a
gauge of financial companies to the biggest gain among industry
groups over the past five days, after the government said it
will more than double the amount qualified foreign institutional
investors can invest in equities, bonds and  bank deposits .
Liquor maker  JiuGuiJiu Co. (000799)  surged 3.6 percent after forecasting
a fivefold jump in profit.  Industrial & Commercial Bank of China (601398) 
Ltd. extended losses after Premier  Wen Jiabao  said China needs
to break a banking “monopoly” of a few big lenders.  “Liquidity and corporate earnings are not likely to worsen
in the second quarter,” Chen Li, head of China equity strategy
at UBS AG, said in an interview in  Shanghai  today. “Low-
valuation ‘blue-chip’ stocks will benefit from the government’s
announcement” on the QFII increase, he said.  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  advanced 4.31 points, or 0.2
percent, to 2,306.55 at the close. About two stocks gained for
each one that fell. The  CSI 300 Index (SHSZ300)  added 0.3 percent to
2,519.83. The  Bloomberg China-US 55 Index (CH55BN) , the measure of the
most-traded U.S.-listed Chinese companies, rose 1.2 percent in
 New York  yesterday.  The Shanghai index climbed 1.9 percent this week after the
China Securities Regulatory Commission increased quotas for QFII
investors to $80 billion from $30 billion. For the year, it’s up
4.9 percent on expectations the central bank will lower lenders’
reserve requirements and reduce borrowing costs after tightening
monetary policy in the previous two years to tame inflation.  Brokerages Jump  Stocks in the measure trade at 9.7 times estimated
earnings, compared with a record low of 8.9 times on Jan. 6,
according to weekly  data  compiled by Bloomberg. Thirty-day
 volatility  was at 17.9 today, near the highest in a month. About
8 billion shares changed hands yesterday, or 9 percent lower
than the daily average this year.  Citic Securities, China’s biggest listed brokerage, rose
1.3 percent to 12.42 yuan, extending yesterday’s 5.8 percent
jump.  GF Securities Co. (000776) , the second largest, added 1.2 percent
to 29.96 yuan after surging 8.9 percent yesterday.  “The government believes that valuations of blue-chip
stocks have come to a level that can bring investors relatively
good returns over the long run and is encouraging them to get
in,” Hong Jinping, a Shenzhen-based analyst at China Merchants
Securities, said by phone yesterday. “The brokerage industry is
the first to reflect an improvement in the market.”  Rate Outlook  China’s one-year central-bank bill yield dropped to the
lowest level in 11 months on speculation Premier Wen will ease
monetary policy to revive growth. The yield declined 17 basis
points last month to 3.31 percent, the fastest slide since
October, compared with similar-maturity  U.S. Treasuries  that
rose 1 basis point to 0.16 percent.  Speculation that Wen will reduce banks’ reserve
requirements or  interest rates  has increased since he said
policy should be fine-tuned “as soon as possible” in comments
reported April 3 by state media.  A gauge of  consumer staples stocks  in the CSI 300 advanced
1.4 percent, the most among 10 industry groups. Jiuguijiu
climbed 3.6 percent to 32 yuan after saying first-quarter profit
probably jumped as much as 470 percent from a year ago.  Sichuan
Tuopai Shede Wine Co. (600702)  added 3.2 percent to 30.57 yuan. Shanxi
Xinghuacun Fen Wine Factory Co. advanced 2.4 percent to 66.60
yuan.  Buying Stocks  Credence Oriental Trade Enterprise Ltd. (CRDOTPL) , a China hedge fund
that has beaten 98 percent of its rivals, will boost its Chinese
stock holdings on the prospect of economic expansion and
increased equity purchases by foreigners.  Credence is increasing the percentage of yuan-denominated A
shares and Hong Kong-listed H shares it holds in its portfolio
to 70 percent from 50 percent, while reducing bets on
commodities, Tom Tang, co-manager of the China-domiciled fund,
said in a phone interview from  Hong Kong  on April 4. Credence,
which has 211 million yuan ($33.6 million) in assets, has
 returned  29 percent in the past three years, outperforming 1,203
China-focused funds, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “Equities will be our major investment in the future,”
said Tang, 39, who is based in Shenzhen. “There’s less variety
in commodities and we want a more diversified portfolio.”  China  will start to release first-quarter economic data
next week. The Chinese  economy  probably expanded 8.4 percent in
the first three months of the year, according to the median
estimate of 38 economists surveyed by Bloomberg. The figure is
due April 13.  The economy grew 8.9 percent in the fourth quarter of 2011,
the slowest pace for 10 quarters. The government last month
lowered this year’s economic growth target to 7.5 percent, after
keeping the goal at 8 percent over the past seven years.  Inflation Data  Consumer prices  in March, due to be released on April 9,
probably rose 3.4 percent, from 3.2 percent in February,
according to the median of 33 analysts’ forecasts compiled by
Bloomberg. New bank loans in March gained the most in 14 months,
a report due next week will show, according to the median of 28
analysts. New lending may have exceeded 800 billion yuan last
month, surpassing the amount in January and February, the 21st
Century Business Herald reported today.  China needs to break a banking “monopoly” of a few big
lenders that make easy profits because it’s hard to borrow money
elsewhere, Wen said. Earnings at China’s biggest banks are
growing even as a cooling economy triggers loan defaults.  ICBC, the biggest lender, slipped 0.2 percent to 4.29 yuan,
while largest rival  China Construction Bank Corp. (939)  declined 1.3
percent to 4.73 yuan.  --Zhang Shidong. Editors: Allen Wan, Chan Tien Hin  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
