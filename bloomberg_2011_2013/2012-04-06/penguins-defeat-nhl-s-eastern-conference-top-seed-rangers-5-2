The  Pittsburgh Penguins  defeated the
Eastern Conference-leading  New York  Rangers 5-2.  The Penguins (50-25-6) have 106 points, three fewer than
the No. 1 Rangers (51-23-7) in the Atlantic Division. The
Rangers share the National Hockey League lead with the Vancouver
Canucks, who hold the advantage with fewer non-shootout losses.
In the conference, top-seeded New York is nine points ahead of
the second-seeded  Boston Bruins  of the Northeast Division.  Chris Kunitz gave the Penguins a 1-0 lead 71 seconds into
the first period last night at Consol Energy Center in
Pittsburgh. Three minutes later, Brandon Dubinsky tied the game
before Tyler Kennedy put Pittsburgh ahead 2-1 midway through the
period.  Richard Park gave the home team a two-goal advantage five
minutes after the start of the second period and Evgeni Malkin
made it 4-1 midway through the final period. Artem Anisimov
scored a power-play goal for the Rangers with two minutes left
in the game before Kris Letang completed the scoring for the
Penguins with 49 seconds remaining.  The win assures the Penguins of home-ice advantage in their
first-round playoff series against the  Philadelphia Flyers .  To contact the reporter on this story:
