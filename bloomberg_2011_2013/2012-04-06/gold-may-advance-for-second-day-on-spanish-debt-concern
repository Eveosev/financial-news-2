Gold may decline in  London  on
speculation the the U.S. jobs report will add to signs of
economic growth, curbing demand for the metal as a hedge against
declines in other assets.  American employers probably added 205,000 workers in March
on top of 227,000 in February, economists in a Bloomberg News
survey forecast before the Labor Department report at 8:30 a.m.
in  Washington . Futures on Standard & Poor’s 500 Stock Index were
0.2 percent higher today.  “The Street has been looking for non-farm payrolls to rise
just over 200,000 and we think it shall instead be by 245,000,”
 Dennis Gartman , an economist at the Gartman Letter in Suffolk,
Virginia, said in his daily report today. “If we are wrong, we
are low.”  Bullion for immediate delivery was little changed at
$1,631.50 an ounce by 7:02 a.m.  New York  time. Trading on the
Comex in New York is closed today for Good Friday.  Silver for immediate delivery rose 0.2 percent to $31.75 an
ounce, and platinum dropped 0.1 percent to $1,604.25 an ounce.  To contact the reporters on this story:
