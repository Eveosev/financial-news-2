Aksa Enerji Uretim AS (AKSEN) , a Turkish
utility, rose in Istanbul after  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  agreed
to buy as much as 13.3 percent of the company for $240 million.  Aksa added 0.8 percent to 3.92 liras by the close in
Istanbul, while the overall Istanbul Stock Exchange  National 100
Index (XU100)  fell a third day, retreating 1.8 percent to 60,939.55.  The sale revises down an earlier agreement in which Goldman
was to receive a 15.1 percent stake for $268 million, according
to a statement to the exchange today from Aksa’s owner, Kazanci
Holding AS.  The new agreement is positive for Aksa as it implies a
higher valuation for the company, Zeynep Karaman, an analyst at
Istanbul-based brokerage  BGC Partners (BGCP) , said in an e-mailed
report today.  The implied valuation of $1.8 billion for the company is
more than 40 percent higher than the valuation based on
yesterday’s closing price, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
