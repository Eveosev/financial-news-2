Petrol Group d.d.  said profit last
year surged as Slovenia’s biggest energy company sold more oil
products after it consolidated its units in the Balkans.  Net income advanced 48 percent to 52.3 million euros ($68
million) while revenue gained 17 percent to 3.3 billion euros,
the Ljubljana-based company said in a regulatory  statement 
today.  “The main driver was the rise of sales of gasoline and
other products,” Aleksander Salkic, who is  Petrol (PETG)  spokesman,
said in a phone interview today. “We have also consolidated our
units in  Montenegro , Croatia and bought some new companies in
Slovenia.”  Petrol, which plans to increase the number of gasoline
stations to 527 by 2016, is benefiting from the acquisitions in
the Balkans, where it has been expanding in the last decade.
Slovenia’s biggest publicly traded company by revenue in March
last year signed a memorandum of understanding with  Russia ’s  OAO
Gazprom Neft (SIBN)  to cooperate in the supply and distribution of oil
products in the Balkan region.  The Slovenian company said today revenue will advance to
4.6 billion euros by 2016, with net income targeted at 91
million euros in four years.  Petrol shares have jumped 19 percent this year, becoming
the second best-performing stock in Slovenia’s benchmark SBITOP
Index after insurer Zavarovalnica Triglav d.d. The stock gained
1.7 percent to 185 euros yesterday, the highest level since
August. The Ljubljana Stock Exchange is closed today for a
public holiday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
