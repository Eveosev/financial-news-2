Showa Shell Sekiyu K.K. (5002) ,  Japan ’s
largest buyer of oil from  Iran , is in the final stages of talks
on reducing its crude-oil purchasing contract with the country
for the fiscal year started April 1, company spokesman Satoshi
Yoshida said today in Tokyo.  Showa Shell plans to reduce the contract volume of about
100,000 barrels-a-day in accordance with an agreement between
the U.S. and Japan. The U.S. and its allies have accused Iran of
seeking to develop nuclear weapons and have imposed sanctions on
the country, including limits on oil purchases.  “The discussions with Iran are in the final stretch, but
we still don’t have a date for reaching an agreement,” said
Yoshida.  Japan’s crude  imports from Iran , the fourth-biggest oil
supplier to the country, dropped 32.7 percent from a year ago to
1.41 million kiloliters, or about 306,000 barrels a day, in
February, according to data from the trade ministry.  The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry requested on
March 21 that importers reduce Iranian imports even after Japan
got an exemption from U.S. sanctions.  The U.S. gave the waiver to nations that have
“significantly reduced” oil purchases from the Middle Eastern
nation, according to U.S. Secretary of State  Hillary Clinton .  To contact the reporter on this story:
