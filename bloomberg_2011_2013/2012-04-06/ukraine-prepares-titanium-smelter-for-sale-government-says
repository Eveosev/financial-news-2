The Ukrainian government will allow
the sale of a 49 percent stake in Zaporizki Titano-Magniivi
Kombinat, a state-managed producer of non-ferrous metals.  The state will keep 51 percent in the southern Ukrainian
company, also known as ZTMK, according to a government
resolution published late yesterday on the Cabinet’s Website.  The 49 percent stake will be transferred to the country’s
State Property Fund and prepared for sale, the Cabinet said in
the resolution.  ZTMK needs $500 million of investments in the next three to
four years,  Kommersant-Ukraine  newspaper reported today,  citing
Oleksandr Nechayev, the chief executive officer of state-managed
holding company Titan Ukrainy.  The government is seeking to attract between $2 billion and
$2.5 billion of investments in titanium production, Kommersant
cited Nechayev as saying.  To contact the reporters on this story:
