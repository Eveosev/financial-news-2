Russian diesel exports from the  St.
Petersburg  terminal dropped 41 percent in March from a year
earlier, a port official said.  Shipments fell to 140,000 metric tons from 237,000 tons a
year earlier, the official said today by phone from St.
Petersburg, declining to be identified because the information
is confidential.  Exports of  fuel oil  from the Baltic Sea port increased 51
percent to 653,000 tons last month from 432,000 tons a year
earlier, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
