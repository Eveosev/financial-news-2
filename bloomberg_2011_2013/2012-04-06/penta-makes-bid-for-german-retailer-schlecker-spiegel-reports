Penta Investments Ltd. made a non-
binding offer for insolvent German retailer Schlecker,  Spiegel 
reported, citing an unidentified spokesman for the Prague-based
private-equity firm.  Penta may need to invest about 90 million euros ($118
million) to renovate about 3,000 Schlecker stores, according to
Spiegel. The potential investor is seeking to limit the
Schlecker family’s stake to a “symbolic minority,” the
magazine said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
