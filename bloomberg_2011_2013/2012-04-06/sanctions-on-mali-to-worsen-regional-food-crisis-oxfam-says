Economic sanctions on  Mali  may have
a “devastating effect” on millions of people who are facing
serious food shortages, U.K.-based aid agency Oxfam said in a
statement.  A blockade on food and fuel imports in the landlocked
country can cause rising food prices, lack of transportation and
restrictions on access to drinking water, which will lead to a
worsening of a refugee crisis in West Africa, the agency said.  Oxfam urged the Economic Community of West African States,
which closed its borders with Mali and blocked access to ports
in neighboring countries following a military coup last month,
to review the sanctions and seek a political solution.   “If the Ecowas sanctions are maintained, they could
undermine current efforts to help 3.5 million Malians that have
been affected by serious food insecurity,” the statement said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
