Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  agreed to
buy as much as 13.3 percent of  Aksa Enerji Uretim AS (AKSEN) , one of
Turkey’s two biggest power producers, for $240 million, revising
down an earlier agreement to acquire a 15.1 percent stake for
$268 million, Aksa owner Kazanci Holding AS said.  The agreement between Kazanci Holding and Goldman Sachs
also envisages the provision of a $400 million syndicated loan
for Kazanci, to be arranged by Goldman,  Turkiye Is Bankasi (ISATR)  AS
and  Turkiye Garanti Bankasi AS (GARAN) , to repay a bridge loan of $192
million from Goldman, Kazanci said in a statement to the
Istanbul Stock Exchange today. Kazanci got the bridge loan for
Aksa last year, it said.  Goldman will initially own 5.82 percent of Aksa Enerji by
paying $105 million and the U.S. lender committed to buy another
7.48 percent for $135 million, Kazanci said.  The syndicated loan, for which Kazanci’s 65.5 percent and
Goldman’s 13.3 percent stakes are used as collateral, will have
a maturity of six years including a three-year grace period, the
statement said. Goldman could sell its Aksa Enerji holding at
any time during the maturity period of the loan, it said.  Aksa Enerji rose 1.3 percent to 3.94 liras at 10:30 a.m. in
Istanbul.  To contact the reporter on this story:
