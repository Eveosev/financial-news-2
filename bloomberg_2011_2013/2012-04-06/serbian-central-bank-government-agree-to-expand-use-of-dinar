Serbia ’s central bank and the
government agreed today to expand the use of the dinar in the
nation’s financial system to improve the Balkan nation’s
financial and macroeconomic stability.  The accord, called the “memorandum on dinarization
strategy” defines goals, measures and activities to increase
confidence in the national currency, the dinar, and its wider
use in the financial system, the Belgrade-based Narodna Banka
Srbije said in an e-mail today.  The strategy will lower the risk of exchange rate
volatility and increase the efficiency of  monetary policy , the
bank said, adding that the document will be published today.  Serbia’s level of euroization, or dependence on the euro
instead of the weakening dinar, is one of the highest in east
 Europe . More than 70 percent of all banking transactions in
Serbia are done in foreign currencies.  The central bank activity has sold more than 500 million
euros ($654.4 million) in the foreign-exchange market this year
to slow the weakening of the dinar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
