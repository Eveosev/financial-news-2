Erste Group Bank AG (EBS)  of Austria rose
from its lowest in more than two months, leading Czech shares
higher for the first time this week.  The stock climbed 1.6 percent to 396.80 koruna by 10:56
a.m. in Prague, paring its decline this week to 7.1 percent. A
close at that level would mark the biggest weekly slump since
the five days ended Nov. 25. The 14-member  PX (PX)  equity index,
where Erste has an 18 percent weighting, increased 0.4 percent.  Erste’s 7.6 percent retreat in the previous two sessions to
the lowest since Jan. 20 pushed the 14-day  relative strength
index  for the stock to 27 at yesterday’s close. Readings lower
than 30 suggest to technical analysts that a security may rise.
