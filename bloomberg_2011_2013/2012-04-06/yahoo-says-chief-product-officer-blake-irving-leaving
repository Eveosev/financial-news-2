Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO) , which announced about
2,000 job cuts earlier this week, said Blake Irving, its chief
product officer, is leaving the company amid a turnaround
effort.  Irving, who earlier worked at  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) , has been at
Yahoo since 2010. The owner of the largest U.S. Web portal made
the announcement in an e-mailed statement.  Irving’s exit comes under the new leadership of Scott
Thompson, who became chief executive officer of Yahoo in
January. Irving joined Yahoo when the company was led by Carol Bartz, who was fired last September.  Thompson is looking for ways to increase efficiency and
drive sales after the company fell behind rivals including
 Google Inc. (GOOG)  and  Facebook Inc. (FB)  Thompson, whose cuts affected
about 14 percent of employees, called an all-hands meeting for
next week to discuss the company’s plans for the future,
according to a letter obtained by Bloomberg News.  Under Irving, a part-time musician who kept a set of drums
near his office for employee jam sessions, Yahoo tried to
develop more software for mobile devices and social networks.
One of the products he promoted was Livestand, an application
that showcased editorial content on tablets.  The average amount of time spent by U.S. visitors on Yahoo
sites rose in December to 227 minutes from 201 a year earlier.
That still trailed Google sites at 271 minutes and Facebook at
423 minutes, according to  ComScore Inc. (SCOR)   Yahoo, based in Sunnyvale, California, fell 1.3 percent
yesterday to $15.07 at 4 p.m. New York time. The shares have
declined 6.6 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
