Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) ’s designated co-
Chief Executive Officer  Anshu Jain  will earn less in that
position than he does in his current job as investment banking
chief, Der  Spiegel  reported, citing unidentified people in the
lender’s supervisory board.  Juergen Fitschen, the other incoming co-CEO, will receive a
pay increase as his compensation is brought to a level with
Jain’s, the magazine said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
