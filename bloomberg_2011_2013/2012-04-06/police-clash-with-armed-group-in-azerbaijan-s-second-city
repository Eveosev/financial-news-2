Police and security forces clashed
with a group of gunmen in Azerbaijan’s second-largest city of
Ganca today, Interior Ministry spokesman Ehsan Zahidov said by
phone, without giving details.  APA  news agency  said at least two people were killed and
several others injured in the clash between security forces and
a group of gunmen who planned a terrorist attack in the city,
some 400 kilometers (249 miles) west of the capital of Baku.  The dead included a security officer and a gunman, APA
said, adding that police discovered explosives strapped on the
body of the slain man.  The militants were members of a radical Islamic group,
independent Turan news agency reported.  Azerbaijan borders  Russia ’s volatile North Caucasus region,
where the government has been battling an Islamic insurgency for
the past 20 years. If confirmed, this will be the first major
armed clash between police and Islamists in  Azerbaijan  in the
last 10 years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
