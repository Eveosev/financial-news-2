Vietnam ’s bond yields dropped this
week by the most in a month on speculation interest rates will
fall. The dong was little changed.  The central bank will cut the deposit rate cap to 12
percent from the current 13 percent, online newspaper Dan Tri
reported today, citing Do Thi Nhung, deputy head of the monetary
policy department at the  State Bank  of Vietnam. It didn’t give a
specific timeframe. The Treasury will change bond auctions to
twice a month after holding weekly sales in the first quarter,
according to a statement from the  finance ministry  on Feb. 8.  “People are more interested in buying bonds as they expect
market interest rates to come down,” said Nguyen Tuan Phong,
Hanoi-based fixed-income manager at Bao Viet Fund Management Co.,
a unit of Vietnam’s biggest insurer. “Less frequent bond
auctions are also encouraging investors to buy debt in the
secondary market.”  The  yield  on the benchmark five-year notes declined six
basis points, or 0.06 percentage point, this week to 11.42
percent, the most since the five days ended March 2, according
to a daily fixing from banks compiled by Bloomberg. The yield
slipped five basis points today.  The dong was little changed at 20,830 per dollar as of 3:30
p.m. in Hanoi, compared with 20,835 yesterday and 20,823 a week
ago, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The central bank
fixed the  reference rate  at 20,828, unchanged since Dec. 26,
according to its website. The currency is allowed to trade up to
1 percent on either side of the rate.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
