The court-appointed receiver for R. Allen Stanford can bill his time starting this year at 2012
rates with a 20 percent discount in spite of objections by
Stanford investors who haven’t received any money so far.  U.S. District Judge David C. Godbey in  Dallas , in an order
yesterday, imposed a 10 percent “holdback” on out-of-pocket
expenses. In a separate order today, Godbey approved the payment
of $1.6 million in fees and expenses that the receiver, Dallas
lawyer Ralph Janvey, had requested and said he could apply later
for the held-back amount of $382,253.  Janvey’s outside counsel, Kevin Sadler, argued at a hearing
yesterday that the receiver’s team has been working at the same
pay rates since 2009. Sadler said that Janvey, who regularly
charges his clients $500 an hour, has been billing $340 an hour
on the Stanford case and then discounting that by 20 percent.  A federal jury in Houston last month found Stanford, 62,
guilty of fraud in what prosecutors said was a $7 billion scheme
involving bogus certificates of deposit at his Antigua-based
bank. He’s scheduled to be sentenced on June 14.  Janvey, whom Godbey appointed in February 2009 -- four
months before Stanford was indicted -- and his outside
professionals, including  Baker Botts LLP (1143L) , have been paid more
than $52 million. That sum doesn’t include a court-imposed $16
million hold-back.  The is Securities and Exchange Commission v. Stanford
