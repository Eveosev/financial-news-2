Japanese  stocks  declined, sending
the  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average to its biggest weekly loss since
August, as rising bond yields in Europe fueled concern the debt
crisis has yet to be contained, outweighing improvement in the
U.S. jobs market.  Sony Corp. (6758) , which depends on Europe for more than a fifth
of its sales, lost 2 percent after the euro weakened against the
yen, damping the outlook for exporters. Kobe Steel Ltd., Japan’s
fourth-largest producer of the material, sank 3.1 percent after
posting a loss that was twice as big as forecast.  NSK Ltd. (6471)  slid
3.4 percent after the bearing maker’s rating was cut by Mito
Securities Co.  The Nikkei 225 fell 0.8 percent to 9,688.45 at the 3 p.m.
close in Tokyo, dropping 3.9 percent on the week. Volume on the
gauge was more than 25 percent below the 30-day average. The
broader Topix Index lost 0.8 percent to 825.71, with about three
shares dropping for every two that gained.  “Investors are getting cautious again about European debt
issues,” said  Kiyoshi Ishigane , a Tokyo-based strategist at
Mitsubishi UFJ Asset Management Co., which oversees the
equivalent of $70 billion. “The debt problem is weakening the
euro against the yen, weighing on the markets.”  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPXL1)  added 0.2
percent today. The gauge slipped 0.1 percent in New York
yesterday after Spanish yields rose to their highest compared
with German debt this year. The  S&P 500  trimmed losses after U.S.
data showed the number of  unemployment  claims filed in the last
week of March fell to the lowest since April 2008.  Euro Slides  The euro dropped to a four-week low against the yen as
Spanish and Italian bonds slumped and borrowing costs rose at a
French auction, adding to concern the debt crisis is spreading.  The 17-nation currency weakened to as low as 106.89 yen
last night in  Tokyo , compared with 108.13 yen at the close of
 stock trading  yesterday, cutting the value of some overseas
income at Japanese companies.  Sony, Japan’s biggest consumer-electronics exporter, lost
2 percent to 1,634 yen. Shimano Inc., a maker of bicycle parts
that gets almost 40 percent of its sales in Europe, slipped 2
percent to 4,765 yen.  A report later today in Washington may show the  U.S.
economy  added more than 200,000 jobs in March for a fourth
straight month, the longest streak of such increases since 2000.  “The U.S. jobs data may be relatively strong, but we don’t
know how the market will react to it,” said Kazuyuki Terao,
chief investment officer of RCM Japan Co.  Steelmakers Drop  Steelmakers declined the most among the Topix’s 33 industry
groups.  Kobe Steel (5406)  lost 3.1 percent to 127 yen after posting a
loss of 20 billion yen ($243 million) in the year ended March 31
due to reversal of deferred tax assets, according to a
preliminary earnings statement. The company earlier forecast a
10 billion yen loss for the period. Nippon Steel Corp. dropped
2.8 percent to 212 yen.  NSK sank 3.4 percent to 598 yen after Mito Securities cut
the bearing maker’s investment rating to “neutral” from
“neutral plus,” citing slumping industrial machine operations
in  China . Thai floods and discount requests from carmakers may
have also dragged on earnings, Yoichiro Watanabe, an analyst at
Mito Securities, said in a report dated yesterday.  Kansai Electric Power Co. rose 2.8 percent to 1,346 yen.
Japanese Prime Minister  Yoshihiko Noda  and three cabinet members
have reached a broad agreement on a new safety standard to allow
the restart of two reactors at the utility’s Ohi nuclear power
plant, according to an Asahi Newspaper report. Tokyo Electric
Power Co., which owns the crippled Fukushima Dai-Ichi nuclear
plant, gained 4.3 percent to 219 yen.  Astellas Pharma Jumps  Among other stocks that gained, Astellas Pharma Inc.
rallied 3.2 percent to 3,360 yen. The drugmaker’s new treatment
for overactive bladders won the backing of advisers to U.S.
regulators even after the drug was linked to high  blood pressure 
and other side-effects.  The  Topix (MXAP)  has advanced 13 percent this year, rebounding
from last year’s 19 percent drop, amid signs the U.S. economy is
improving. Shares on the gauge trade for an average of 1.01
times book value, compared with 2.3 times for the S&P 500 and
1.4 times for the Stoxx 600, according to Bloomberg data. A
number less than one means that companies can be bought for less
than value of their assets.  -- With assistance from Yoshiaki Nohara in Tokyo. Editors:  Jim Powell , Jason Clenfield.  To contact the reporters on this story:
