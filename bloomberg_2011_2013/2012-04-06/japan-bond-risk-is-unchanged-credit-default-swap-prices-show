The cost of protecting Japanese
corporate and sovereign bonds from default remained unchanged,
according to traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index was at 159.5 basis points as
of 9:05 a.m. in  Tokyo , according to Deutsche Bank AG. The gauge
closed yesterday at the highest level since March 23, according
to CMA, which is owned by CME Group Inc. and compiles prices
quoted by dealers in the privately negotiated market.  Markets in Australia and  Hong Kong  are closed today for a
public holiday.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
credit quality. A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
