Turkish Central Bank Governor Erdem Basci says measures to tighten liquidity since October have been
“very effective” and credit growth and domestic demand will
slow to more “moderate” levels.  The central bank’s policies, which include a so-called
“interest rate corridor” allowing it to vary  interest rates  on
a daily basis, will gradually reduce imbalances in the Turkish
 economy  and create a “healthier” foundation for growth, Basci
wrote in an article in the Turkish policy magazine Iktisat ve
Toplum, or “Economy and Society.”  The bank’s unexpected decision in August to cut Turkey’s
benchmark interest rate to a record low of 5.75 percent helped
protect the Turkish economy uncertainties growth in  Europe ,
Basci said.  The lira has been less volatile than other emerging-market
currencies since the bank reversed course in October by raising
rates through the interest rate corridor and began intervening
in the  currency market , he said.  The Turkish central bank will preserve its flexibility in
monetary policy “in coming years” amid fast-changing global
conditions, Basci said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
