Russian stocks retreated, falling
for a third week, following U.S. stock futures lower after a
report showed American employers added fewer jobs than forecast.  The 30-stock  Micex index  dropped 1.8 percent to 1,497.19 by
the close of trading in Moscow, bringing the weekly decline to
1.3 percent. The index swung between gains and losses in earlier
trading.  OAO Raspadskaya (RASP)  tumbled 4 percent, the biggest slump in
the index today. OAO Gazprom, Russiaâ€™s gas export monopoly,
declined 2.1 percent.  The U.S. Labor Department said today that employers added
120,000 jobs, the fewest in five months and less than the median
estimate economist forecast of 205,000 in a Bloomberg survey.
The country reduced its 2012 economic growth forecast to 3.4
percent from 3.7 percent previously, Economy Minister  Elvira
Nabiullina  said in Moscow today.  Raspadskaya fell to 103.48 rubles, its lowest level since
Jan. 11, after the coal producer said it missed an output target
in the first quarter. Gazprom fell to 178.19 rubles for the
weakest close since March 29.  The Market Vectors Russia ETF, a U.S.-traded fund that
holds Russian shares, rose 0.5 percent to $30.63 in  New York 
yesterday. The RTS Volatility Index, which measures expected
swings in the index futures, jumped 6.5 percent to 31.60 today.  Most Western European markets were closed today for the
Good Friday holiday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
