Equilor Befektetesi Zrt., a
Hungarian brokerage, has asked for approval from the country’s
financial watchdog to create a fund management unit, the company
said today.  The investment management arm, which will probably start
operating in “late spring” if given the permission, will be
led by Zsolt Pillar, who has been working at  Assicurazioni
Generali S.p.A. (G) ’s Hungarian fund management unit, Equilor said
in an e-mailed statement.  Equilor, which has been a member of the Budapest Stock
Exchange since the exchange’s foundation in 1990, also joined
the Warsaw bourse last year, according to the broker’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
