Evraz Plc (EVR) ,  Russia ’s largest
steelmaker, halted production at its ZSMK unit’s rail mill for
five months to carry out a $600 million expansion project.  The upgrade will allow Evraz to boost rail output capacity
at ZSMK to 1 million metric tons by September from 650,000 tons,
Evraz said today in an e-mailed response to questions. The
steelmaker part-owned by billionaire  Roman Abramovich  will be
able to produce higher quality rails, including those 100 meters
(328 feet) in length.  This year,  OAO Russian Railways (RZHD)  may have a shortfall of
18,900 metric tons of rails after Evraz shut the mill from April
1,  Vedomosti  reported today, citing an unidentified official at
the Transportation Ministry. The company, which has annual
consumption of 700,000 tons of rails, may use some from the
state’s reserves agency, the newspaper said.  Evraz plans to compensate for the shortfall from next
year’s production if needed, the company said by e-mail. Evraz’s
other rail mill at its NTMK unit is continuing to work at full
capacity of 500,000 tons a year, the steelmaker said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
