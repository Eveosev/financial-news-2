U.K. 10-year gilts gained for a
third week as a slump in Spanish and Italian bonds fueled
concern the region’s debt crisis is spreading and boosted demand
for safer assets.  Ten-year yields dropped to the lowest in almost a month as
a report showed U.K. manufacturing unexpectedly declined,
spurring investor appetite for the haven of government debt. The
pound rose to a 12-week high versus the euro as European stocks
declined for a second week. The  Bank of England  kept its
benchmark  interest rate  at 0.5 percent and its  bond-purchase
target  at 325 billion pounds ($516 billion), as predicted in a
Bloomberg News survey.  “Safe-haven flows have resumed and gilts have benefited
from that,” said  Nick Stamenkovic , a fixed-income strategist at
RIA Capital Markets Ltd. in Edinburgh. “Equities had a very
good performance in the first quarter and the second has started
on a bumpy note.”  The  10-year gilt yield  fell four basis points, or 0.04
percentage point, in the week, to 2.16 percent at 5:05 p.m.
London time yesterday, after dropping to 2.13 percent, the
lowest since March 13. The 4 percent bond maturing in March 2022
was at 116.36 percent of face value, from 115.4 on March 30.  British markets are closed for public holidays on April 6
and April 9.  The U.K.’s benchmark FTSE 100 Index of stocks slipped 0.8
percent in the holiday-shortened week, after gaining 3.5 percent
in the first quarter. The Stoxx Europe 600 Index fell 1.6
percent.  Spanish Sale  Spain ’s 10-year yield rose as much as 15 basis points to
5.84 percent yesterday, the highest since Dec. 13. The country
sold less than its maximum target at a bond sale in the week,
the first auction since announcing public debt will surge this
year.  A house-price index increased to minus 12 in March from
minus 13 a month earlier, the  Royal Institution  of Chartered
Surveyors will say April 10, according to the median prediction
of eight economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  Gilts have handed investors a loss of 1.8 percent this year
through April 4, after surging 17 percent in 2011, according to
indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European Federation of
Financial Analysts Societies.  The pound gained for a second week versus the euro, rising
to 82.38 pence on April 5, from 83.27 pence on March 30. The
U.K. currency dropped 0.8 percent to $1.5838.  To contact the reporter on this story:
