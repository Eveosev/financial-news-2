U.S.  local-government payrolls  fell
to the lowest level in more than six years in a sign that
municipalities still face fiscal strains almost three years
after the end of the recession.  Employment by local governments, adjusted for seasonal
hiring swings, dropped by 3,000 in March to 14.1 million, the
lowest since February 2006, the U.S. Labor Department reported
today.  State payrolls  helped offset the loss, showing a third
straight month of gains, rising 2,000 to 5.1 million. It’s the
longest streak of job increases at that level since 2008.  Municipalities, which depend largely on property taxes, are
probably cutting jobs because the housing market is still
rebounding and homeowners are pressing for lower assessments,
said Alan Schankel, a managing director at Janney Montgomery
Scott LLC in Philadelphia. State governments, which depend more
on income and sales taxes, have also cut local aid to balance
budgets in the wake of the recession that ended in June 2009.  “It’s kind of a double-whammy,” Schankel said in a
telephone interview today. “There’s still stress at the local
level.  State and local-government tax collections grew at the
slowest pace in a year in the final quarter of 2011, the U.S.
Census Bureau said last month. Revenue rose 2.1 percent from a
year earlier to $387.2 billion. While it was the ninth straight
advance, it was the smallest jump since the end of 2010.
Property taxes rose 0.2 percent from a year before.  States and local governments have cut about 640,000 jobs
combined since public-sector employment peaked in 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
