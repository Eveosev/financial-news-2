Socialist challenger  Francois Hollande ’s lead over President Nicolas Sarkozy is at its
narrowest since polling started for the French presidential
election.  Hollande would defeat Sarkozy by 53 percent to 47 percent
in the May 6 run-off, an Ifop-Fiducial poll said today. Hollande
was credited with 54 percent in the previous Ifop rolling poll a
week ago and 54.5 percent a week before that.  For the April 22 first round, Sarkozy gained 0.6 point to
29 percent while Hollande was steady at 26.5 percent, with anti-
immigrant campaigner Marine Le Pen third with 16.5 percent.
Under the French system, the top two in the first round meet in
a second and decisive round.  The poll for Paris Match magazine questioned 1,284 people
by e-mail between April 3 and 6. No margin of error was given.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
