Emerging-market stock funds took in
$42 million in the week ended April 4, as net inflows into
diversified developing country funds offset outflows from Brazil
and  Asia  excluding  Japan , according to EPFR Global.  Net investment into emerging-nation  equity  funds has
totaled $25.63 billion in 2012, compared with outflows of $18
billion for the same period of 2011, according to data e-mailed
yesterday by EPFR, a Cambridge, Massachusetts-based data
provider.  So-called Global Emerging-Market funds, or GEM funds,
recorded a net inflow for the week of $1.18 billion,  Cameron Brandt , EPFR’s director of research, said by e-mail yesterday.
GEM Funds have taken in over $1 billion in 10 of the 14 recorded
weeks in 2012, he said.  “It’s a fairly standard reaction to rising uncertainty,”
Brandt said in a phone interview yesterday. “Funds flow into
diversified  emerging markets  and away from countries seen as
higher risk.”  Concern that  China’s economy  is slowing weighed on
investors, Brandt said.  The world’s second-largest economy expanded 8.4 percent in
the first quarter, National Development and Reform
Commission Vice Chairman  Zhang Xiaoqiang  said on April 3. That’s
down from 8.9 percent growth in the last three months of 2011,
the slowest pace for 10 quarters.  Asian funds excluding Japan recorded net outflows of $716
million, according to EPFR. Latin American funds posted net
outflows of $374 million, while Brazil-dedicated funds had
outflows of $396 million.  Russian equity funds posted their 10th consecutive week of
net inflows, the longest streak since the first quarter of 2011.
Russia dedicated funds added $16 million for the week.  The average emerging-market equity portfolio posted a 0.35
percent loss for the week, reducing the advance in 2012 to 13
percent, Brandt said.  Emerging-market bond funds registered inflows for the week
of $507 million, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
