France ’s soft-wheat growing area may
fall to the lowest in nine years after freezing temperatures
destroyed fields in the European Union’s largest grower of the
grain, the government’s crop office reported.  The area may fall 5.4 percent to 4.72 million hectares
(11.7 million acres) from 4.98 million hectares in 2011,
according to data from FranceAgriMer, which last month estimated
farmers had planted 5.07 million hectares of soft wheat, an
increase of 1.7 percent over last year’s area.  Temperatures in France’s Lorraine, Champagne and Burgundy
regions fell as low as minus 20 degrees Celsius (minus 4
Fahrenheit) in February, damaging emerging wheat plants. French
wheat production may be cut by 2.5 million tons due to winter
kill, farm adviser Offre et Demande Agricole estimates.  The estimated crop area was reviewed following the damage
caused by frost, Xavier Rousselin, head of arable crops at
Montreuil-sous-Bois, France-based FranceAgriMer, said by e-mail.  Paris-traded milling wheat for November delivery rose above
grain for December delivery in  Chicago  for the first time in the
contracts’ lifetime on Feb. 7. Buyers now need to pay about
$267.97 a metric ton for French wheat, $17.77 a ton more than
for soft red winter wheat.  The soft-wheat area would be the lowest since 2003, when
French farmers harvested 4.52 million hectares of the grain,
slashing production to 29.1 million tons from 37.3 million tons
the previous year.  The estimate of the soft-wheat area in Lorraine, which last
year grew 4.6 percent of the French crop, was cut to 69,850
hectares from 253,000 hectares, FranceAgriMer data show. Farmers
in Champagne-Ardennes, good for 9.3 percent of last year’s
harvest, will grow wheat on 302,800 hectares rather than the
415,000 hectares estimated in March.  Barley area will also slide, falling 12 percent to 924,315
hectares from 1.05 million hectares in 2011, according to
FranceAgriMer. The office had previously expected barley
planting to climb 2.5 percent to 1.08 million hectares.  FranceAgriMer cut its estimate of the area for growing
rapeseed to 1.57 million hectares from 1.58 million hectares.
France is the EU’s largest grower of the oilseed ahead of
 Germany , according to data from the bloc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
