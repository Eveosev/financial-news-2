Most Czech central bankers consider
inflation risks to be balanced even amid persisting
uncertainties related to global economic developments, according
to minutes from a March 29 rate-setting meeting.  Six out of seven board members voted to leave the  two-week 
repurchase rate at 0.75 percent, a quarter-point less than the
 European Central Bank ’s main rate.  Eva Zamrazilova  demanded a
quarter-point increase in the rate, which hasn’t changed since
May 2010, according to the minutes published today on the
Prague-based bank’s website.  The economy, exporting about 80 percent of its output, slid
into a  recession  last year as government spending cuts
outweighed demand abroad for Czech-made vehicles, car parts and
electronics goods.  Inflation (CZCPYOY)  accelerated to 3.7 percent in
February, the fastest pace in more than three years, driven
mainly by an increase in the value-added  tax rate  at the start
of the year, the bank said.  “The prevailing view was that the risks to the inflation
forecast are balanced,” according to the minutes. “It was said
that the low increase in nominal unit labor costs confirms
absence of demand-driven inflationary pressures in the domestic
economy.”  -- Editors: Alan Crosby, James M. Gomez  To contact the reporter on this story:
