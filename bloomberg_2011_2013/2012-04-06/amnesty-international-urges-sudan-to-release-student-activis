Amnesty International  urged Sudan to
release a detained member of Darfur University Students’
Association, saying he’s “at risk of torture and other ill
treatment.”  Haidar Mahmoud Abderrahman Manis was arrested on March 28
by four men in civilian clothing in the Setta Haj Youssef market
on the outskirts of Sudan’s capital Khartoum, London-based
Amnesty International said in an e-mailed statement yesterday,
citing a witness. He is believed to be held by the National
Intelligence and Security Services, it said.  “He is being detained in an unknown location, and has no
access to his family or a lawyer,” Amnesty said in the
statement.  Sudan’s human rights record deteriorated in the past year
since  South Sudan  seceded in July, with the eruption of new
armed conflicts and crackdowns on students, rights advocates and
the media, New York-based  Human Rights Watch  said on Jan 22.  To contact the reporter on this story:
