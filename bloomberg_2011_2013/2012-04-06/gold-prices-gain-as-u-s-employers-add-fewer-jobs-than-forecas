Gold in  London  rose for a second
straight day after U.S. employers added fewer than jobs than
forecast, boosting prospects for the  Federal Reserve  to use
additional stimulus measures to spur growth.  Payrolls climbed by 120,000 in March, the Labor Department
said today. Economists forecast a gain of 205,000, the median of
80 projections in a Bloomberg News survey. Minutes from a Fed
policy meeting released this week indicated that the central
bank will hold off on increasing monetary accommodation unless
economic expansion falters.  “There’s going to be this feeling that the Fed’s minutes
that said easing was off the table is not going to pan out,”
Michael Gayed, the chief investment strategist who helps oversee
$150 million at New York-based Pension Partners LLC, said in a
telephone interview. “We’re getting the consistent message that
stimulus is good for gold.”  Bullion for immediate delivery gained 0.3 percent to settle
at $1,636.43 an ounce. Trading on the Comex in  New York  is
closed today for Good Friday.  Gold has surged 86 percent since the end of 2008 as the Fed
held borrowing costs at a record low and bought $2.3 trillion in
housing and government debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
