U.S.  stock futures  fell, signaling
more Standard & Poor’s 500 Index losses following the biggest
weekly retreat of the year, as the  dollar  declined while
Treasuries and gold rose after American employers added fewer
jobs than forecast in March.  S&P 500  futures slumped 1.1 percent to 1,374.90 following
the benchmark index’s 0.7 percent weekly loss. All stock
exchanges in the U.S., western  Europe , Canada and Brazil were
closed for Good Friday. Russia’s Micex Index retreated 1.7
percent. The dollar lost as much as 1.3 percent to 81.31 yen,
the lowest in a month. Yields on 10-year  Treasuries (USGG10YR)  fell 13
basis points to 2.05 percent. Gold for immediate delivery rose
0.6 percent to $1,640.35 an ounce.  Yields on 10-year Treasuries dropped the most this year
after the U.S. Labor Department said employers added 120,000
jobs, the fewest in five months and less than the median
economist forecast of 205,000 in a Bloomberg survey. The amount
had exceeded 200,000 for three straight months.  “This is a real shock,”  Donald Selkin , the New York-based
chief market strategist at National Securities Corp., which
manages about $3 billion, said in a telephone interview.
“Everybody is so hung up on the 200,000 increase.”  Equity traders had 45 minutes to react to the jobs report
in the U.S. Futures linked to the S&P 500 and  Dow Jones
Industrial Average  stopped at 9:15 a.m.  New York  time on CME
Group Inc.’s Chicago Mercantile Exchange.  Commodities, Bonds  While gold traded in  London , U.S. commodity markets were
shut for the holiday. The Securities Industry and Financial
Markets Association recommended trading in fixed-income
securities end at noon in New York, opting for an early close
rather than a complete shutdown because of the jobs report.  The U.S. unemployment rate fell to 8.2 percent, the lowest
since January 2009, from 8.3 percent. Faster employment growth
that leads to bigger wage gains is necessary to propel consumer
spending that accounts for about 70 percent of the economy. The
data also showed Americans worked fewer hours and earned less on
average, helping explain why the  Federal Reserve  says  interest
rates  may need to stay low at least through late 2014.  “This is not a horrible report, but it is weaker than the
market has recently become accustomed to,” Thomas Simons, a
government-debt economist at Jefferies Group Inc., wrote in a
note to clients. “This is going to turn up the heat on the
debate for QE3 since a deceleration in the economic data has
been highlighted as a prerequisite for such a program,” he
said, referring to a third round of stimulus measures known as
quantitative easing.  Before the U.S. jobs report, Asian  stocks  and South Korea’s
won fell on concern Europe’s debt crisis will weigh on global
growth. The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  slid 0.4 percent, and the
won weakened against all 16 major peers. Taiwan’s Taiex Index
rallied 0.9 percent after the finance minister said some foreign
investors may be exempt from a capital-gains tax.  To contact the reporters on this story:
