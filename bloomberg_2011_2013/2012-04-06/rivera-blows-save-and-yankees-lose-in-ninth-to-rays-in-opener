The Tampa Bay Rays rallied for two
runs off career saves leader  Mariano Rivera  in the bottom of the
ninth inning to defeat the New York Yankees 7-6 in the season
opener for both teams.  Rivera, 42, who leads Major League Baseball’s list with 603
saves, allowed a run-scoring triple by Ben Zobrist and a game-
winning single by Carlos Pena. He gave up two runs on three hits
and two intentional walks in one-third of an inning.  Rivera had converted 60 of 61 saves against the Rays, and
Pena had been hitless in 11 career at-bats against Rivera.  “When you see him blow one, it’s shocking,” Yankees
manager  Joe Girardi  told reporters. “It’s going to happen. It
happened. It’s baseball.”  Rivera entered yesterday’s game at  Tampa Bay ’s Tropicana
Field with a 6-5 lead. Yankees starter CC Sabathia, who gave up
a grand slam to Pena in the first inning and allowed five runs
in six innings, was in line for the win until Rivera blew the
save.  “My fault,” Rivera said. “I felt good. I don’t make
excuses. I just left the ball up.”  Raul Ibanez, who joined the Yankees as a free agent in
February, hit a three-run homer in the third.  To contact the reporter on this story:
