Isiah Thomas  was fired as the men’s
basketball coach atFlorida International University after
leading his team to an 8-21 record last season.  Thomas, who went 26-65 in three seasons at Miami-based FIU,
won’t return because the school has “decided to take the
program in a different direction,” Pete Garcia, FIU’s executive
director of sports and entertainment said in an e-mailed
statement.  Thomas, a member of the basketball Hall of Fame for his 13-
year career as a member of the Detroit Pistons, was fired as
president and coach of the  New York Knicks  in 2008. He ran the
Knicks for four years -- two as coach -- never producing a
winning team.  To contact the reporter on this story:
