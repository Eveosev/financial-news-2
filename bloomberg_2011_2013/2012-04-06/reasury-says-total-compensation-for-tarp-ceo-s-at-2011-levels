The overall compensation packages
for chief executive officers of the three companies still in the
Troubled Asset Relief Program after receiving “exceptional”
assistance from it have not increased from last year, the U.S.
Treasury Department said.  The Treasury today released the 2012 compensation report
for American International Group Inc., Ally Financial Inc. and
General Motors Co. The CEO compensation packages have been
frozen at their 2011 levels, the Treasury said in a release.  The Treasury said the top senior executives at the
three companies saw their overall cash compensation decrease 18
percent and their total direct compensation decrease 10 percent
from 2011 levels.  To contact the reporters on this story:
