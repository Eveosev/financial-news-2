Russia ’s antitrust regulator banned
OAO Gazprom from bidding for state-owned OAO SG-Trans, the
country’s biggest rail transporter of liquefied petroleum gases.  Gazprom, the world’s biggest gas producer, is the Russia’s
second-largest LPG transporter with 18 percent of the market,
which would rise to more than 80 percent if it acquired SG-
Trans, and Federal Anti-Monopoly Service Deputy Head Anatoly
Golomolzin said today at a conference in Moscow.  OAO Rosneft, Russia’s biggest oil producer, and billionaire
Vladimir Evtushenkov’s AFK Sistema received approval to bid for
the state’s 100 percent stake in the rail company, RIA Novosti
reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
