Lai Changxing, alleged to have
headed a ring in the 1990s that smuggled billions of dollars of
cigarettes, cars, oil and other goods into  China , went on trial
today in Xiamen after he was extradited from  Canada  last year,
the official Xinhua News Agency reported.  Lai, 53, who fled to Canada about 13 years ago, went on
trial for smuggling and bribery at the Intermediate People’s
Court in the southeastern Chinese coastal city, Xinhua reported.
A December 2011 statement by prosecutors said Lai bribed dozens
of government officials and also ordered subordinates to bribe
officials, Xinhua said.  Lai’s smuggling ring brought about 53 billion yuan ($8.4
billion) worth of goods into China starting in 1996, Xinhua
reported in Nov. 2000, when 14 people were sentenced to death
for their involvement in the ring.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
