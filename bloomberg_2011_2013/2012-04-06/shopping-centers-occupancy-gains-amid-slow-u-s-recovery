U.S.  shopping centers  had a net gain
in occupancies in the first quarter amid a slow economic
recovery, according to property-research company  Reis Inc. (REIS)   Occupied space rose by a net 2.96 million square feet
(275,100 square meters), the second-largest increase since
neighborhood and community retail centers began losing tenants
in the first quarter of 2008, New York-based Reis said in a
report today. So-called absorption was up from 717,000 square
feet a year earlier.  “The first quarter produced more evidence in favor of a
slow recovery,” Ryan Severino, a Reis senior economist, said in
the report. “We remain cautious about pronouncing a turnaround
until we observe a couple more quarters of improvement.”  Retail landlords are benefiting as consumers spend more
amid improving employment. U.S. chain-store sales last month
rose 4.1 percent from a year earlier, the  International Council
of Shopping Centers  said. The  jobless rate  was 8.3 percent in
February, the latest period for which Bureau of Labor Statistics
figures are available and the fifth straight month it was less
than 9 percent.  Shopping-center vacancies stood at 10.9 percent in the
first quarter, unchanged from a year earlier and down from 11
percent in the last three months of 2011, according to Reis. It
was the first decline in vacancies from a prior quarter since
the second quarter of 2005.  Effective rents, or what’s paid after any landlord
discounts, averaged $16.57 a square foot, little changed from
$16.55 a year earlier and $16.56 in the fourth quarter. Rents
remain close to late-2005 levels, Reis said.  At regional malls, which typically include department
stores and are larger than neighborhood and community shopping
centers, vacancies fell to 9 percent in the first quarter from
9.1 percent a year earlier. Rents rose to $39 a square foot from
$38.75.  To contact the reporter on this story:
