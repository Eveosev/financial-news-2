The  International Monetary Fund  is
aware that  Hungary  is delaying loan talks in hope that market
conditions will improve and render the backstop unnecessary,
Nepszabadsag  reported , citing an unnamed source with knowledge
of the matter.  Negotiations won’t start in April because Prime Minister
 Viktor Orban  hasn’t agreed to meeting all European Union and IMF
terms required to begin the talks, the Budapest-based newspaper
said.  If negotiations start, Hungary will have to be ready to
change at least the “parameters” of its flat personal income
tax rate. It may have to raise the rate, for example, in case
the government refuses to scrap it altogether, Nepszabadsag
said. The Washington-based lender may also recommend that the
central government levy a property tax, according to the
newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
