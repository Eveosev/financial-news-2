A gauge of U.S. company credit risk
jumped for a third day after a report showing the nationâ€™s
employers added fewer jobs than economists were estimating.  The Markit CDX North America Investment Grade Index, a
credit-default swaps benchmark that investors use to hedge
against losses on corporate debt or to speculate on
creditworthiness, increased 2.4 basis points to a mid-price of
99.3 basis points as of 8:45 a.m. in  New York , according to
Markit Group Ltd. The index is trading at the highest level
since Feb. 17.  The 120,000 increase in payrolls, the fewest in five
months, followed a revised 240,000 gain in February that was
bigger than first estimated, Labor Department figures showed
today in  Washington . The March increase was less than the most
pessimistic forecast in a Bloomberg News survey in which the
median estimate called for a 205,000 rise. Unemployment fell to
8.2 percent, the lowest since January 2009, from 8.3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
