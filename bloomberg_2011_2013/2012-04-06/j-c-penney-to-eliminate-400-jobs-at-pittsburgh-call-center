J.C. Penney Co. (JCP) , the fourth-largest
U.S. department-store company, is eliminating about 300 jobs in
Pittsburgh, in addition to cuts at the company’s headquarters
office announced yesterday, as Chief Executive Officer  Ron Johnson  remakes the retailer.  The reductions at the customer call center and more than
600 cuts at its headquarters that were announced yesterday will
result in pretax charges of as much as $38 million, the Plano,
Texas-based company said today in a filing with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission. The total of about 1,000 job
cuts represents less than 1 percent of the company’s full- and
part-time workforce of 159,000.  Johnson, who took over in November after leading Apple
Inc.’s retail business, is seeking to revive sales by
simplifying pricing into three tiers and reconfiguring stores
into a collection of branded shops. The changes at the
headquarters are intended to make J.C. Penney run more like a
start-up company, he said yesterday in a statement.  The changes are part of a plan announced in January to cut
annual costs by about $900 million by the end of 2013, including
$200 million in savings from headquarters, the company said
yesterday.  Shares fell 1.9 percent to $34.97 yesterday in  New York .
The shares dropped 5.4 percent in the 12 months through
yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
