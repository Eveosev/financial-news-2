Daiei Inc. (8263)  shares jumped the most in
almost 6 months in Tokyo after the Japanese supermarket chain
forecast it will return to profit for the first time since 2008
by increasing private brand sales.  The retailer rose 3.8 percent, the most since Oct. 11, to
277 yen in Tokyo, compared with a 0.8 percent decline on the
broader Topix Index.  “Daiei’s stock has been valued low for some time now, so
there was a certain amount of surprise there,” said  Kenichi
Hirano , general manager and strategist at Tachibana Securities
Co. in Tokyo.  Daiei President Michio Kuwahara said the retailer will
increase the portion of private-label goods it sells to 15
percent this year, from 12 percent. “That will raise our
profitability,” he told reporters in  Tokyo  today.  Net income will probably jump to 1 billion yen ($12.2
million) in the year ending February 2013, from an 11.4 billion
yen loss in the previous year, while sales are expected to
remain little changed at 870 billion yen, according to its
earnings statement today.  Net loss widened to 11.38 billion yen for the year ended
Feb. 29, from 5.32 billion yen a year earlier, according to
today’s statement. Sales dropped 5 percent to 869.5 billion yen.  The retailer also forecast operating profit will more than
double to 8 billion yen this fiscal year from 3.73 billion yen
in the previous 12 months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
