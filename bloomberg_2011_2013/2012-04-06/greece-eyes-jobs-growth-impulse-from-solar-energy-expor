A group led by  Germany ’s  Fichtner
GmbH & Co. KG  was chosen as technical adviser for  Greece ’s 20-
billion euro ($26.1 billion) Helios solar power project,
according to the country’s committee on privatizations.  The other members of the venture are all from Greece;
 Kantor Management Consultants SA , the  Centre for Renewable
Energy Sources  and the  National Technical University of Athens ,
according to a  statement  from the committee posted on the Greek
government’s ministerial decision  website .  The Helios project, named after the ancient god of the sun,
would install as many as 10 gigawatts of solar panels by 2050,
