New World Resources Plc (NWR)  snapped a
two-day drop after the biggest Czech coking-coal producer said
its OKD unit reached an agreement with trade unions on wages.  The stock climbed 2.7 percent to 129.1 koruna by 1:20 p.m.
in Prague, paring its drop this week to 2.6 percent. NWR was the
third-best performer in the 14-member  PX (PX)  index, which added 0.6
percent, reducing its biggest weekly slump since November 2011.  While basic wages will rise 3 percent starting this month,
OKD’s total personnel expenses will remain “broadly flat”
compared with the previous year and in line with the company’s
cost guidance for 2012, NWR said in a statement late yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
