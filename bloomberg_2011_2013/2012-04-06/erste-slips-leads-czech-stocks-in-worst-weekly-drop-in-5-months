Erste Group Bank AG (EBS)  reversed earlier
gains and led Czech shares’ biggest weekly decline in five
months after U.S. employers added fewer jobs than forecast.  The Austrian lender slid 2.4 percent to 381.30 koruna by
the end of trading in Prague, extending its losses this week to
11 percent. The 14-member  PX (PX)  index, where Erste has a 17 percent
weighting, slid 0.8 percent, bringing the weekly retreat to 4.7
percent, the biggest since the five days ended Nov. 4.  U.S. stock futures fell as investors fled to the relative
safety of Treasuries and gold after data showed employers in the
world’s largest economy added 120,000 jobs in March, the fewest
in five months and less than the median forecast of 205,000 in a
Bloomberg survey, casting doubts on the economic recovery.  New World Resources Plc, the biggest Czech producer of
coking coal, pared gains of as much as 3.4 percent after the
U.S. jobs report, ending the day up 0.6 percent to 126.4 koruna.  The Czech koruna weakened 0.3 percent to 24.717 per euro.  To contact the reporter on this story:
