Turkish yields fell the most in a
week after employers in the U.S. added fewer jobs than forecast
in March, fanning speculation of continued loose monetary policy
that will benefit higher-yielding lira bonds.  Yields (BENCH)  on two-year benchmark bonds dropped six basis
points, 0.06 percentage point, to 9.32 percent at 6:01 p.m. in
Istanbul, the lowest level since March 30 on a closing basis.
The lira weakened 0.2 percent to 1.7942 per dollar.  The March increase of 120,000 was less than the most
pessimistic forecast in a Bloomberg News survey in which the
median estimate called for a 205,000 rise. Unemployment fell to
8.2 percent, the lowest since January 2009, from 8.3 percent.  “This data will reinforce expectations of quantitative
easing” and for U.S. rates to stay low for a long time, Bugra Bilgi, a hedge fund manager at Garanti Asset Management in
Istanbul, said in e-mailed comments. “This is good for
emerging-market foreign-exchange and rates.”  Turkish yields fell 157 basis points in January in the
biggest monthly retreat since 2009 after Federal Reserve
Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said on Jan. 25 that U.S. interest
rates will remain exceptionally low for longer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
