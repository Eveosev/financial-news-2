Ukraine’s  inflation rate  fell in
March for a ninth month to the lowest since January 2003 after a
good harvest of vegetables and sugar beet damped price growth.  Consumer prices rose 1.9 percent from a year earlier,
compared with 3 percent in February, the committee, based in the
capital Kiev, said in a statement today. The median estimate of
10 economists in  Bloomberg (UACPTYOY)  survey was 2.1 percent. On the month,
prices rose 0.3 percent.  Slowing inflation allowed the central bank to cut its main
 interest rate  on March 23 for the first time in two years to
spur the former Soviet nation’s economy. The rate was lowered
0.25 percentage point to 7.5 percent amid a government forecast
for economic growth to slow to 3.9 percent this year from about
5 percent in 2011.  “Annual inflation will keep slowing in the first half of
this year because of favorable comparison base,” Iryna Piontkivska, an economist at Troika Dialog in Kiev, said by
phone.  Piontkivska expects inflation to quicken from June as
President  Viktor Yanukovych  promised to raise social spending
ahead of parliamentary elections, scheduled for October, and the
country’s harvest will decline because of worse weather
conditions. She said she keeps her year-end inflation forecast
of 6.5 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
