Comerica Inc. (CMA)  customers agreed to
seek private mediation in their lawsuit challenging the bank’s
overdraft fees, according to a court filing.  The mediation is “an effort to resolve this action without
further litigation,” according to a joint motion filed
yesterday in federal court in Miami. The first mediation session
is scheduled for May 23, according to the filing.  Comerica, based in Dallas, and the customers asked a judge
to suspend court proceedings pending the outcome of mediation.  At least 30 banks have cases before U.S. District Judge
James Lawrence King in Miami. The customers say the banks
reorder debit-card transactions in their computers to maximize
overdraft fees.  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) , the biggest U.S. bank by assets, has
reached a preliminary agreement to pay $110 million to settle
litigation.  Bank of America Corp. (BAC) , the second-biggest, agreed
last year to pay $410 million without admitting liability. Union
Bank NA agreed to a $35 million settlement with customers in
November.  The case is In re Checking Account Overdraft Litigation,
09-md-02036, U.S. District Court, Southern District of  Florida 
(Miami).  To contact the reporter on this story:
