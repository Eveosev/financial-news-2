Palm oil, used in food and fuel,
climbed to the highest in more than a year in  Malaysia  as South
American soybean supplies declined. In  China , palm and  soybean
oil  rose to the costliest in more than six months.  The June-delivery contract advanced 1.3 percent to end at
3,604 ringgit ($1,176) a metric ton on the Malaysia Derivatives
Exchange, the most expensive close for a most-active contract
since March 7, 2011. Futures advanced 5 percent this week, the
fifth straight gain and the longest run in more than 16 months.
Speculation stockpiles in Malaysia may drop also spurred buying.  Palm oil is “rising mainly on anticipation of bullish
stock data and also on the back of the increase of soybean
prices,” Ivy Ng, an analyst with CIMB Group Holdings Bhd., said
by phone from Kuala Lumpur today. With Malaysian inventory data
on April 10, “people will buy in anticipation of that news as
well as the lower soybean crop.”  Stockpiles (PASTTOTL)  in Malaysia fell 2.4 percent to 2.01 million
tons in March, from 2.06 million tons in February, according the
median of estimates in a Bloomberg survey of four analysts and
two plantation companies. The Malaysian  Palm Oil  Board will
release data for inventories, output and exports.  Argentina, Brazil  Soybean production in  Argentina  and  Brazil  will probably be
smaller than the U.S. government said last month after hot, dry
weather reduced yields, based on a survey of as many as 20
analysts by Bloomberg News yesterday. Soybean oil, produced from
the oilseed, and palm oil can replace each other.  Argentina’s crop will be 45.12 million tons and the
Brazilian harvest 66.77 million tons, according to the survey,
which compares with U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates of
46.5 million tons and 68.5 million tons. The USDA is set to
release new estimates on April 10 at 8:30 a.m. in  Washington .  Soybeans for May delivery rose 1 percent to $14.34 a bushel
on the Chicago Board of Trade yesterday, the highest close for a
most-active contract since Sept. 2. Soybean oil for May gained
1.1 percent to 56.64 cents per pound yesterday. U.S. exchanges
are closed for a public holiday today.  Palm oil for delivery in September climbed 1 percent to end
at 8,968 yuan ($1,422) a ton, the highest close for the most-
active contract since Sept. 9. Soybean oil for delivery in the
same month increased 1.2 percent to close at 9,996 yuan a ton,
the highest since Sept. 21.  To contact the reporter on this story:
