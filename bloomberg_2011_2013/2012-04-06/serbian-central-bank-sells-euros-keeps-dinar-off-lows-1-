Serbia ’s central bank sold euros to
support the weakening dinar, lifting the currency off lows for
the second time this week after it fell to 112 to the euro.  The Belgrade-based Narodna Banka Srbije sold 50 million
euros ($65.4 million), its third-biggest daily intervention this
year, to “enable the smooth functioning” of the market, it
said in a statement. It acted after the dinar dropped 0.35
percent against  Europe ’s common currency on the day.  The bank has sold 558.5 million euros since the start of
2012 to prop up the dinar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
