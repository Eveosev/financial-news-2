The Orthodox Christian Church of
Cyprus said it’s “deeply saddened” by the arrest of a parish
priest on charges of smuggling drugs to the east Mediterranean
island from abroad.  The alleged actions of Father Panayiotis Triantafyllou, a
37-year-old Greek national, have saddened the faithful and have
left a black spot on the church, the Nicosia-based  Church of
Cyprus  said today in a  statement  on its website.  The church has suspended Triantafyllou, who was ordained in
 Greece , from being able to perform religious rites pending an
ecclesiastical court investigation into the alleged crime and
after the church received new information related to previous
complaints against the priest for various offenses, according to
the statement.  Cypriot police arrested Triantafyllou on April 4 at
Cyprus’s Larnaca Airport for illegal possession of drugs and
suspected trafficking after he arrived on a flight from abroad
with 3 kilos (6.6 pounds) of cannabis, according to a  statement 
on the website of the Nicosia-based  force . Police are holding
the priest in custody until they complete an investigation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
