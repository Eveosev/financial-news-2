Redecard SA (RDCD3)  said NM Rothschild &
Sons Ltda valued its shares at as much as 37.59 reais ($20.6),
7.4 percent higher than the 35 reais offered by controller  Itau
Unibanco Holding SA (ITUB4)  to buy out minority shareholders.  Rothschild valued Redecard shares at 34.18 reais to 37.59
reais using the free cash flow to equity ratio, according to a
regulatory filing yesterday.  Shares in the card-payment processor were also valued at
36.13 reais to 37.11 reais using a market multiple criteria, in
which Rothschild used  Cielo SA (CIEL3) ’s stock price to earnings per
share multiple as a model, according to the filing.  Itau, Brazil’s biggest bank by market value, in February
offered to buy out Redecard’s minority shareholders for as much
as 11.8 billion reais, less than five years after the card-
payment processor went public.  Itau, based in  Sao Paulo , plans to buy 336.4 million common
shares of Redecard for as much as 35 reais each, according to a
Feb. 7 filing. Redecard hired Rothschild to assess the value of
its shares.  To contact the reporter on this story:
