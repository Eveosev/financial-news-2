The Romanian government is
considering increasing oil and natural-gas royalties or
surcharging energy companies, as the country moves to free
electricity and gas prices, Mediafax  reported today , citing
unidentified government officials.  The administration is considering an increase in oil and
gas royalties earlier than a 2014 deadline or overtaxing energy
and gas companies, which will post profits as the state
deregulates prices, the Bucharest-based news service reported
today, citing the unnamed people.  To contact the reporter on this story:
