The sale of  Bankas Snoras AB (SRS1L)  assets
may be concluded as early as this month after the Lithuanian
lender’s administrator received 20 bids from potential
investors, including Baltic, Scandinavian and U.K. companies,
Neil Cooper, Snoras’s administrator, said in a  statement  on the
bank’s website today.  Snoras was declared insolvent in November after the central
bank discovered assets were missing at the lender.  To contact the reporter on this story:
