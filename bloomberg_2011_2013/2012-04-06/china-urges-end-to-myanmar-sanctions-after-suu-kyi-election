China  urged nations to end sanctions
on Myanmar following April 1 elections that saw democracy
advocate Aung San Suu Kyi win a seat in parliament.  “China has noticed that some western countries have
expressed willingness to partially lift sanctions against
Myanmar,” Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei told reporters in
Beijing yesterday. “We welcome such statements of partial
lifting of sanctions and call on all parties concerned to
completely lift their sanctions against Myanmar.”  China nurtured ties with Myanmar’s former military junta,
signing agreements to import oil and gas. Myanmar has moved to
release political prisoners and open the political process to
opposition parties including Nobel Peace Prize winner Suu Kyi’s
National League for Democracy.  Secretary of State  Hillary Clinton  said April 4 that the
U.S. will selectively lift restrictions on Myanmar. The
 Association of Southeast Asian Nations  this week called on the
U.S. and  Europe  to end sanctions, a step that may allow
Myanmar’s economy to further open and give investors access to
its mineral wealth and market of 64 million people.  China hopes the election “will be conducive to promoting
political reconciliation in Myanmar and boosting stability and
development of the country,” Hong said.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
