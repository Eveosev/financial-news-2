Netflix Inc. (NFLX) , the world’s largest
video-streaming service, said it expects activist investor  Carl Icahn  to start a proxy battle after acquiring an almost 10
percent stake in the company.  Netflix, while willing to consider offers, isn’t interested
in seeking a buyer, Jonathan Friedland, a spokesman for the  Los
Gatos , California-based company, said yesterday by telephone. He
confirmed comments by Chief Executive Officer Reed Hastings
reported yesterday in the Wall Street Journal.  Icahn disclosed his investment in Netflix on Oct. 31,
saying he built the holding of stock and options because of the
company’s “dominant” market position in video streaming. Its
international growth prospects also make it an attractive
acquisition target, he said.  Netflix adopted a so-called poison pill on Nov. 5 to defend
against a hostile bid. On Nov. 14, CNBC reported that Icahn was
reaching out to potential buyers.  The company is positioned to remain independent after 10
years on its own, Hastings told the Journal.  Netflix fell 0.7 percent to $80.90 yesterday in New York.
The shares have advanced 17 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
