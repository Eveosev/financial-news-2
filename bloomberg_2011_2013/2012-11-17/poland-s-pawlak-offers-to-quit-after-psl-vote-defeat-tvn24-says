Polish Economy Minister  Waldemar
Pawlak  offered to resign from the government after failing to be
re-elected as head of the coalition’s Peasants Party, TVN24
said, citing Pawlak.  Janusz Piechocinski, who was elected chairman of the
coalition’s junior partner today, told a televized news
conference that the party, known as PSL, will remain a
“reasonable, wise coalition partner” in the government.  Piechocinski said Pawlak, who is also a deputy prime
minister, should keep his post.  To contact the reporter on this story:
