Prime Minister  Mario Monti  said
Italy would risk losing its voice in shaping the future of the
European Union if it asked for a bailout.  If Italy had taken an International Monetary Fund rescue,
“for the next five, 10, 15 years Italians and those that
govern, sitting at the European table wouldn’t be able to put
their plans for the future of Europe into effect,” Monti said
today at a round-table discussion in Milan. “We must be
rigorous on ourselves so we’re not treated like debtors, even if
we aren’t.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
