Morgan Stanley (MS)  was sued by  IKB
Deutsche Industriebank AG (IKB)  over claims the investment bank hid
the truth about $147.1 million in residential mortgage-backed
securities it sold to the German company.  IKB, based in Dusseldorf, said in a summons filed today in
New York state court in Manhattan that the offering materials
for the securities contained misrepresentations and omissions
about the underwriting standards used for the underlying home
loans, as well as regarding the loan-to-value ratios of the
loans.  Mark Lake, a spokesman for New York-based Morgan Stanley,
declined to comment on the lawsuit.  The case is IKB International v. Morgan Stanley,
653964/2012, New York State Supreme Court, County of New York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
