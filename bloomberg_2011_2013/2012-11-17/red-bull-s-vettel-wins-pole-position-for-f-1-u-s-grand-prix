Sebastian Vettel won pole position
for tomorrow’s U.S. Grand Prix, where he has a chance to claim
his third straight Formula One championship.  Vettel, of the Red Bull team, qualified in a time of 1
minute, 35.796 seconds at the Circuit of The Americas in Austin,
Texas, beating out McLaren’s  Lewis Hamilton  by 0.10 seconds.  Vettel, 25, leads Ferrari’s  Fernando Alonso  by 10 points in
the standings and will become the youngest three-time world
champion if he earns 15 more points that the Spaniard in
tomorrow’s next-to-last race of the season. The winner receives
25 points.  Alonso qualified in ninth place, but will move up a
position to eighth after Lotus’s Roman Grosjean was dropped five
spots from fourth after being penalized for a gearbox change.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
