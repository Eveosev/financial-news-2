Three Brazilian electricity
companies have appealed to the Ministry of Mines and Energy
against the government’s proposed new rules governing
concessions for the industry, Estado de Sao Paulo said, citing a
statement from the ministry.  The three companies are  Cia de Transmissao de Energia
Eletrica Paulista , known as CTEEP,  Cia Energetica de Sao Paulo (CESP6) ,
known as Cesp, and  Empresa Metropolitana de Aguas e Energia ,
known as Emae, the Sao Paulo-based newspaper said.  The companies are appealing the government’s proposed
indemnification for investments in power plants and the amounts
they will be allowed to charge for operating and maintaining the
plants, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
