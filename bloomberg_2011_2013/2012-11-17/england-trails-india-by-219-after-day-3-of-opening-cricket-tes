England  trails India by 219 runs
after being forced to follow on during day 3 of the opening
cricket Test in Ahmedabad.  Captain  Alastair Cook  was an unbeaten 74 and Nick Compton
34 not out as England reached 110-0 at stumps.  The visitors were earlier bowled out for 191 in response to
India’s 521-8 declared. Pragyan Ojha took 5-45 as England’s last
seven wickets were lost by tea.  The match is the first of four Tests between the teams.
England, which swept the series when the teams met in the U.K.,
hasn’t won a Test series in India since a 1984-85 tour.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
