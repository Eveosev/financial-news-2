The auctions for the concessions on
the international airports in Rio de Janeiro and  Belo Horizonte ,
Brazil, will not be held until next year, O Globo reported,
citing unidentified government officials.  There is no longer time this year to finish preparing the
announcement and winning the necessary regulatory approvals, the
Rio de Janeiro-based newspaper said on its  website . The auctions
for the Rio and Belo Horizonte airports, known as Galeao and
Confins, respectively, will probably held in March or April,
with President Dilma Rousseff announcing the date in December, O
Globo said.  Local pension funds are expected to form partnerships with
foreign airport operators, including Fraport AG, Changi Airport
Group and Airports Company South Africa, according to the paper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
