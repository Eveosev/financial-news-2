Pro Football Hall of Famer Mike Ditka suffered a minor stroke yesterday, a producer for ESPN
said on Twitter.  Seth Markman posted on the social networking site that the
73-year-old former Chicago Bears coach, who works as a National
Football League analyst for ESPN, fell ill yesterday and won’t
appear on the network’s coverage this weekend.  “He wants everyone to know he’s ok,” Markman’s post said.  Ditka told the  Chicago Tribune  he was at a suburban Chicago
country club playing cards when he noticed his hands “weren’t
working quite right,” and that he had a problem speaking. He
previously suffered a heart attack in 1988 while coaching the
Bears.  Ditka led Chicago from 1982-92, guiding the team to its
only Super Bowl championships after the 1985 season. He also
coached the  New Orleans Saints , following a Hall of Fame playing
career as a tight end with Chicago, Philadelphia and Dallas.  To contact the reporter on this story:
