be undefeated.  Marc Gasol  scored 24 points and  Zach Randolph  had 20 points
and 15 rebounds for the Grizzlies, who improved their record to
7-1 last night at the FedEx Forum in Memphis.  Carmelo Anthony had 20 points and  Raymond Felton  had 18 for
the Knicks, who gave up 13 turnovers that Memphis converted into
21 points.  The Grizzlies were 26 of 32 from the free-throw line for 81
percent compared with 16 of 21 or 76 percent for the Knicks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
