Spanish bonds fell, pushing 10-year
yields to the highest level in six weeks, as a euro-area report
showed the region’s economy contracted in the third quarter,
pushing it into recession.  Spain ’s 10-year yield  climbed  for a fourth consecutive
week, the longest run of increases since June, as the nation’s
government refrained from asking for aid from the  European
Central Bank ’s Outright Monetary Transactions program. Germany’s
two-year note yields were below zero percent every day this
week. The nation  sold  the securities at a negative rate for the
second time on record on Nov. 14, the first time since July.  “The euro area is in a technical recession which was to be
expected to some extent,” said Norbert Aul, a rates strategist
at Royal Bank of Canada in London. “The prevailing reluctance
of the Spanish government to ask for aid is putting soft
pressure on Spanish bonds.”  The yield on Spain’s 10-year bonds rose five basis points,
or 0.05 percentage point this week, to 5.87 percent at 5 p.m.
 London  time. The 5.85 percent bond maturing January 2022 fell
0.335, or 3.35 euros per 1,000-euro ($1,272) face amount, to
99.82. The rate climbed to 5.96 percent on Nov. 13, the most
since Oct. 1.  Gross domestic product  in the 17-nation euro area dropped
0.1 percent in the third quarter after a 0.2 percent decline in
the previous three months, the European Union’s statistics
office in Luxembourg said on Nov. 15. Spain’s economy  shrank  0.3
percent, the fifth straight quarter of contraction, while
Germany’s  expanded  0.2 percent, separate data showed.  Negative Yields  German two-year notes yielded minus 0.034 percent. A
negative yield means investors who hold the security until it
matures will receive less than they paid to buy it.  Germany  allotted 4.3 billion euros of securities maturing
in December 2014 at an average yield of minus 0.02 percent. That
compares with a  record-low  auction yield of minus 0.06 percent
set on July 18.  The German  10-year bund  yield was at 1.33 percent, after
declining to 1.31 percent on Nov. 13, matching the lowest since
Aug. 31. The rate dropped two basis points since Nov. 9, its
fourth straight weekly fall and the longest run of declines
since June.  Greece  was this week granted an additional two years to
reach budget-deficit goals in its bailout program. European
finance ministers will be discussing ways of plugging the
funding gap resulting from that extension at a meeting in
Brussels on Nov. 20.  Output Data  A report due next week is forecast to show an index euro-
area services and manufacturing output contracted for a tenth
month in November. A composite  index  based on a survey of
purchasing managers in both industries was 45.9 this month, from
45.7 in October, London-based Markit Economics will say on Nov.
22, according to the median estimate of 20 analysts in a
Bloomberg News survey. A reading below 50 indicates contraction.  Germany is scheduled to sell 4 billion euros of 10-year
bunds on Nov. 21, while Spain plans to auction securities
maturing between 2015 and 2021 a day later.  German bonds returned 4 percent this year through Nov. 15,
according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. Spanish securities
gained 2.1 percent, while Italy’s earned 18 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
