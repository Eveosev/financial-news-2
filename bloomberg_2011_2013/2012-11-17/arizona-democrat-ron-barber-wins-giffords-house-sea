Democrat Ron Barber defeated
Republican Martha McSally in the race for the 2nd Congressional 
District in  Arizona  vacated by  Gabrielle Giffords  following the
January 2010 shooting that wounded her and killed six others.  Barber was completing the remainder of Democrat Giffords’
term before  winning  a full term in this election, receiving
143,173 votes to McSally’s 141,771 with all precincts reporting,
according to the Arizona Secretary of State’s office.  Giffords, 42, was shot her through the head from point-
blank range at a constituent event outside a Safeway grocery
store in Tucson on Jan. 8, 2011, by Jared Lee Loughner, 24.
Giffords, a three-term Democrat, resigned from Congress in
January to focus on her recovery. Loughner on Nov. 9 was ordered
to spend the rest of his life in prison after pleading guilty to
killing six people and attempting to assassinate the
congresswoman.  Editors: Ann Hughey, Christian Thompson  To contact the reporter on this story:
