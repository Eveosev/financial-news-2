The pound fell against the euro and
the dollar this week as the  Bank of England  said U.K. growth
will remain “subdued,” leaving the door open for further
stimulus to boost the economy.  The U.K. currency snapped a three-week advance versus the
euro as a report showed Britain’s retail sales fell more last
month than economists forecast, adding to signs the economy is
struggling to recover. Sterling has still strengthened almost 4
percent against the 17-nation currency this year as the euro-
area debt crisis spurred demand for safer assets. U.K.
government bonds were little changed this week.  “Weak economic numbers and comments from the Bank of
England presented a downside risk for sterling in the near
term,” said  John Hardy , head of foreign-exchange strategy at
Saxo Bank A/S in  London . “Our view remains, however, that as
long as the euro debt crisis is unresolved, sterling will
benefit from a safe-haven status.”  The pound declined 0.3 percent this week to 80.15 per euro
at 5 p.m. in London yesterday, after strengthening 1.7 percent
during the previous three weeks. The U.K. currency fell 0.2
percent this week to $1.5866. It fell to $1.5829 on Nov. 15, the
weakest level since Sept. 5.  The central bank lowered its forecasts for the U.K. economy
in its quarterly inflation report released Nov. 14, and said
there was a heightened risk of “persistent low growth.”  ‘Unappealing Combination’  “We face the rather unappealing combination of a subdued
recovery with inflation remaining above target,” Bank of England
Governor  Mervyn King  told reporters that day. “The Committee has
not lost faith in asset purchases as a policy instrument, nor
has it concluded that there will be no more purchases.”  The central bank voted to end its current program of asset
purchases at 375 billion pounds at its meeting on Nov. 7-8.
Minutes of the gathering will be released on Nov. 21. Policy
makers next meet on Dec. 5-6.  Sterling has weakened 2.1 percent in the past six months,
the second-worst performer after the yen of the 10 developed-
market currencies tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted
Indexes. The euro declined 1.8 percent and the dollar dropped
1.7 percent.  The yield on the benchmark  10-year gilt  fell less than one
basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, this week to 1.73
percent. The 1.75 percent bond due in September 2022 rose 0.03,
or 30 pence per 1,000-pound face amount, to 100.165.  The U.K. will auction 4.5 billion pounds of five-year gilts
on Nov. 20 and 2.5 billion pounds of bills on Nov. 23.  Gilts returned 3.4 percent this year through Nov. 15,
according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. German bunds gained
4 percent and  U.S. Treasuries  rose 2.8 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
