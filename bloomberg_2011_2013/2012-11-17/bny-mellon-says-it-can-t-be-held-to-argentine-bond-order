Bank of New York Mellon Corp.  told a
 New York  judge that he shouldn’t hold the bank responsible if
 Argentina  fails to pay the holders of its defaulted debt.  The  U.S. Court of Appeals  in New York ruled Oct. 26 that
Argentina must pay holders of the defaulted notes if it pays off
on its restructured debt. U.S. District Judge Thomas Griesa is
considering how to apply the ruling to third parties, including
BNY Mellon, and to set a payment formula.  Holders of the defaulted bonds, who are seeking more than
$1.4 billion, want Griesa to block Argentina from going forward
with more than $3 billion in scheduled payments on the
restructured debt next month if it refuses to pay them as well.  “As indenture trustee,  BNY Mellon  has no control over
Argentina and no involvement in Argentina’s performance of any
obligations to plaintiffs,” the bank said in a court filing
today. “Plaintiffs’ efforts to threaten an indenture trustee
with an extraordinary citation of contempt go too far.”  Griesa said he will rule by Dec. 1 on the payment formula
and the issues relating to third parties. Argentina has asked
the appeals court to reconsider its Oct. 26 ruling.  The case is NML Capital Ltd. v. Republic of Argentina, 08-
cv-06978, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York
( Manhattan ).  To contact the reporter on this story:
