Arsenal beat 10-man Tottenham 5-2 to
move ahead of its north London rival in the English Premier
League standings.  Per Mertesacker,  Lukas Podolski , Olivier Giroud, Santi
Cazorla and Theo Walcott all scored for Arsenal after
Tottenhamâ€™s Emmanuel Adebayor received a red card at the
Emirates Stadium.  Adebayor opened the scoring against his former club in the
10th minute, but was sent off eight minutes later for a foot-
first challenge on Cazorla. Gareth Bale also scored in the 71st
minute for Spurs.  The win moves Arsenal into sixth place with 19 points, two
more than Tottenham, which drops one spot to eighth place. The
Gunners also beat Spurs 5-2 at home last season.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
