The Czech Republic beat Spain in
doubles to move within a victory of its first Davis Cup tennis
title.  Tomas Berdych and Radek Stepanek beat Marcel Granollers and
Marc Lopez 3-6, 7-5, 7-5, 6-3 to give the Czech Republic a 2-1
lead over the defending champion in the best-of-five final in
Prague.  The Czechs need one victory in tomorrow’s two reverse
singles matches -- as Berdych meets  David Ferrer  and Stepanek
plays Nicolas Almagro -- to claim the premier team event in
men’s tennis.  Spain is trying to win the Davis Cup for the fourth time in
five years and sixth time in all. The Spanish team is withouth
 Rafael Nadal , the world’s fourth-ranked player, who’s been
sidelined since June by a knee injury.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
