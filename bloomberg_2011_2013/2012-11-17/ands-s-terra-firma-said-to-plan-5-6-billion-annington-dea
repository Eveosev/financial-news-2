Terra Firma Capital Partners Ltd.,
the private-equity firm founded by  Guy Hands , is in talks to buy
Annington Homes from  Nomura Holdings Inc. (8604)  in a transaction
valuing the U.K. military housing portfolio at about 3.5 billion
pounds ($5.6 billion), a person familiar with the situation
said.  Terra Firma’s investors will help purchase the portfolio
through 500 million pounds of new equity, combined with about
500 million pounds of debt arranged by  Barclays Plc (BARC) , the person
said, declining to be identified as the details are private. The
business also has around 2.5 billion pounds of debt, the person
said.  Annington was set up by Nomura’s principal finance group in
1996 to buy the U.K. Ministry of Defence housing portfolio. It
had about 57,434 homes at the time of purchase, with the
properties located in England and  Wales , according to
Annington’s website. Hands led the acquisition of Annington when
he worked at Nomura and built up the bank’s buyout unit in the
1990s.  The U.K.’s Telegraph newspaper reported the planned
transaction earlier.  Representatives for Terra Firma and Nomura in London both
declined to comment.  To contact the reporters on this story:
