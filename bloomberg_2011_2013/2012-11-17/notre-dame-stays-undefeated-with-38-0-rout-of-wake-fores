The University of  Notre Dame 
improved to 11-0 with a 38-0 rout of Wake Forest, remaining one
of three undefeated teams at college football’s top level.  Everett Golson threw three touchdown passes as the Irish
opened a 31-0 halftime lead in South Bend, Indiana. Notre Dame,
which travels to the University of  Southern California  next week
for its regular-season finale, has an 11-0 record for the first
time since its 1988 national championship season.   Notre Dame is ranked third in the Bowl Championship Series
standings behind No. 1 Kansas State, which is at Baylor tonight,
and No. 2 Oregon, which hosts 13th-ranked Stanford.   Fourth-ranked Alabama routed Western Carolina 49-0 today,
while No. 17 UCLA beat No. 18 USC 38-28 to claim a spot in the
Pacific-12 championship game as the conference’s South Division
winner. Fifth-ranked  Georgia , No. 6 Florida and No. 9 South
Carolina all won against schools in the Football Championship
Subdivision, the sport’s second level.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
