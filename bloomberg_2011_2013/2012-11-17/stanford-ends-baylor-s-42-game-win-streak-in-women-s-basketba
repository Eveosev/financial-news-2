No. 4  Stanford University  defeated
top-ranked Baylor University 71-69 to end the Lady Bears’ 42-
game winning streak in women’s college basketball.  Brittney Griner, who scored 22 points for Baylor, missed a
basket at the buzzer to give the Cardinal a 3-0 record for the
season.  “We haven’t faced adversity like we did,” Griner said.
“We’ll learn from it.”  Chiney Ogwumike scored 18 points for the Cardinal, who lost
to Baylor (2-1) in the national semifinals last season by 12
points. Stanford also broke Connecticut’s 90-game National
Collegiate Athletic Association record win streak in 2010.  “It’s been a long time since that bunch lost. I hope they
feel like anybody or any competitor feels after a game that you
lose,” said Baylor coach Kim Mulkey after her team’s loss at
Stan Sheriff Center in Honolulu. “I hope they don’t forget it
and it bothers them.”  Baylor’s win streak was the fifth-longest in NCAA women’s
history behind  Connecticut ’s runs of 90 and 70 games, Louisiana
Tech’s 54 consecutive wins and  Tennessee ’s 46 straight
victories, according to ESPN statistics.  To contact the reporter on this story:
