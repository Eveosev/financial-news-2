Italian Prime Minister  Mario Monti 
said the European Union’s plan to buy bonds of countries
struggling to bring down borrowing costs shouldn’t carry a
stigma, though he would prefer that Italy not be the first
nation to trigger a rescue.  “It’s a mechanism that should be encouraged, designed to
support without stigma those who use it, and its aimed at
countries that are already meeting EU rules and conditions,” he
said during a panel discussion at a conference in Milan.  “I am all for it even if I prefer that another country
become the first to test it. I don’t think Italy needs it now
and won’t need it in the future,” he said today.  Monti also said that jointly issuing European debt, or
sellling so-called eurobonds, should still be discussed and that
Italy was fighting to keep the idea “on the table.”  The Italian premier said that he had considered asking for
an extension of deficit targets agreed with the EU, though he
had no regrets about sticking to the original goals, especially
after seeing how some countries that were granted more time
fared.  To contact the reporter on this story:
