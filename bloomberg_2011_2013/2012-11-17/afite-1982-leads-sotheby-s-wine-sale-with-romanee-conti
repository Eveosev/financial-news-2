Chateau Lafite-Rothschild 1982 was
the top lot at  Sotheby’s (BID)  London wine sale this week, with mixed
collections of Romanee-Conti 1999 and 2001 and half-cases of La
Tache 2005 Domaine de la Romanee-Conti accounting for the next
six highest, Sotheby’s said in an e-mailed news release.  Six magnums of Chateau Lafite-Rothschild 1982 sold for a
total of 37,600 pounds ($59,800), including fees, to an Asian
buyer, more than the top estimate of 28,000 pounds, according to
Sotheby’s. A dozen mixed bottles of Domaine de la Romanee-Conti
1999 sold for record 37,600 pounds to a U.K. private buyer. An
Asian client paid 19,975 pounds for a similar assorted case of
DRC 2001, both more than the estimate before the Nov. 14 sale.  The auction came as investor attention has switched to
rarer Burgundy vintages from top Bordeaux wines, which are
available in greater quantities. The global financial crisis has
cooled demand for Medoc first-growths, while collectors remain
ready to bid aggressively on the smaller amounts of Burgundies
available.  A sale by Christie’s International Plc in Geneva on Nov. 14
featured as top lot a 92-bottle vertical collection of Chateau
d’Yquem dessert wine, which sold for 230,000 Swiss francs
($243,000) to an Asian private buyer, according to Christie’s.  Following are auction results this year from the five
biggest houses: New York-based Acker Merrall & Condit Company
Inc., Christie’s, based in London, Sotheby’s, with its
headquarters in  New York ,  Hart Davis Hart Wine Co.  of Chicago
and Zachys in  White Plains , New York. Internet-only auctions
aren’t included.  Links on auction-house names are to results or catalogs on
their websites, while those on city names are to post-sale
statements where available.
