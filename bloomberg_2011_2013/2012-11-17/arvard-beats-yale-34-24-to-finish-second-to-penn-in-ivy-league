Harvard University  defeated Yale
University 34-24 for its record sixth straight win in college
football’s third-oldest rivalry, which is known as “The Game.”  Colton Chapple passed for two touchdowns and ran for a
third yesterday at Harvard Stadium in Cambridge,  Massachusetts ,
as the Crimson (8-2) set an Ivy League record for points in a
season with 394. Brown set the previous mark of 375 in 2000.  “If nobody else in the student population knows about a
football game on this campus, they know about this one,” said
Harvard running back Treavor Scales, who clinched the win with a
63-yard touchdown run with one minute, 8 seconds left. “It’s a
lot of pressure, but you love it. You love the atmosphere and
the entire week leading up to it.”  Harvard finished second in the  Ivy League  with a 5-2 mark
in conference play. Penn (6-4, 6-1 Ivy) clinched the league
championship by beating Cornell 35-28 yesterday. Harvard needed
to win and have the Quakers lose to share the title.  Yale (2-8, 1-6 Ivy) overcame a 10-point deficit to take a
24-20 lead over Harvard midway through the fourth quarter as
Tyler Varga ran for two scores and Henry Furman threw a 12-yard
touchdown pass to Grant Wallace.  Chapple tossed a a 4-yard touchdown pass to Cameron Brate
with 4:44 left to give Harvard a 27-24 lead before Scales sealed
the victory. Scales finished with 177 rushing yards on 19
carries and Chapple rushed for 128 yards.  Yale has a 65-56-8 lead in the series, which is the sport’s
third-oldest behind Lehigh-Lafayette (147 meetings) and Yale-
Princeton (135 meetings).  Spencer Kulcsar scored on 3-yard touchdown run with one
minute remaining in Ithaca,  New York , to give Penn the league
title.  Andrew Holland threw for one touchdown and ran for a second
for the Quakers. Luke Hagy scored three touchdowns for Cornell
(4-6, 2-5 Ivy), while quarterback Jeff Mathews passed for 445
yards and one score.  To contact the reporter on this story:
