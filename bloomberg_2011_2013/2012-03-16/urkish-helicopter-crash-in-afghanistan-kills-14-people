A Turkish military helicopter
serving under NATO command crashed for unknown reasons in
 Afghanistan ’s capital, killing 14 people.  Twelve of the dead were Turkish soldiers, the military
command in Ankara said  on its website  today. A three-floor
building collapsed in the collision in Kabul, killing two Afghan
women, Afghanistan’s Interior Ministry said.  While investigations into the incident continue, the crash
appears to have been caused by a technical failure, Foreign
Minister  Ahmet Davutoglu  told reporters in response to a
question in Istanbul.  The crash was the deadliest for the international force in
Afghanistan since August, when 30 U.S. soldiers were killed in a
helicopter shot down by insurgents in Wardak province.  “The cause of the crash is under investigation,” the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization said in an e-mailed
statement. “Initial reporting indicates there was no enemy
activity in the area at the time of the crash.”  Turkey , a NATO member since 1952, leads the alliance’s
forces in the Afghan capital. The helicopter hit a residential
building in Housainkhel neighborhood in the central district of
Bagrami, according to the  Interior Ministry . The crash occurred
at 10:25 a.m. in Kabul, Turkey’s armed forces said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
