Bard Holding GmbH , a German company
that helped pioneer deep water wind-farms, expects talks on its
takeover by several companies to close within about 12 weeks.  Bard is discussing the sale with a “couple” of companies,
Axel Bahr, a spokesman, said by phone, declining to name them
because talks are continuing. Bard anticipates “indicative
offers” at end-March and completion in 6 to 12 weeks, he said.  The company is developing the 400-megawatt Bard Offshore 1
wind farm in the German  North Sea  about 100 kilometers (62
miles) from Borkum island, scheduled to be completed by next
year or 2014. Bard has permission to build another 80 turbines
in nearby waters about 40 meters (130 feet) deep.  Cost and technical challenges from developing  wind turbines 
far at sea, among the most expensive of renewable technologies,
led to “financial pressure” for Emden-based Bard, Bahr said.  The company suffered delays installing the machines and ran
short of money, pushing the project with an expected capacity to
power 400,000 homes about two years behind schedule, Bahr said.  Bard in September said it had begun seeking a “strategic
investor” and appointed  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) ’s investment
banking arm to sell a 87.5 percent stake.  Daewoo Shipbuilding &
Marine Engineering Co., Ltd. (042660)  said in November it was interested.  While the shipbuilder is still studying it, “there is no
specific matter in progress at the moment,” it said in an e-
mailed reply to questions. JPMorgan Chase & Co wouldn’t comment.  Holding Company  UniCredit Bank AG (HVM) , which provided about 1.74 billion euros
($2.3 billion) for the wind park from 2007 to 2010, agreed to
give a further 1.17 billion euros in August 2011, “on the basis
of various technical and legal reports by external consultants
stating that the project was feasible,” the bank said.  The 2.9 billion euros of UniCredit funds would allow the
park to be finished, the bank said in a  statement  on its website
this year. UniCredit declined to comment when Bloomberg called.  Bard, founded in 2003 by Arngolt Bekker, is the holding
company of a group of businesses covering all stages of offshore
wind development, including making turbines. Bekker transferred
his shares to a trustee at end-2010 because of funding problems.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
