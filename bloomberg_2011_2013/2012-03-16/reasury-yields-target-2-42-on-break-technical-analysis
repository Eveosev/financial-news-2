Treasury 10-year  bond yields  may
climb to the highest level in seven months after breaking above
a so-called downtrend line from April last year,  DZ Bank  AG
said, citing trading patterns.  Yields (USGG10YR)  on benchmark 10-year notes rose as high as 2.346
percent yesterday, the most since Oct. 28, and have surged 27
basis points this week. The advance has broken a downtrend line
drawn from the April high of 3.6132 percent which approached the
2-percent mark today, said Andy Cossor, the Hong Kong-based
chief market strategist for  Asia  at Frankfurt-based DZ Bank.  “We have a clear break of that downtrend line that’s been
in place for a long time and we’ve also punched through the
resistance that had been keeping the market in a sideways
range,” Cossor said. “The upside target, at least initially,
will be the highs from October last year at 2.42 percent.” So-
called resistance is where yields may change direction.  The benchmark 10-year yield rose two basis points to 2.30
percent as of 6:04 a.m. in  London . It rose as high as 2.4176 on
Oct. 28, the most since Aug. 9. The 2 percent security due
February 2022 declined 1/8, or $1.25 per $1,000 face amount, to
97 12/32 today.  Yields will reach 2.60 percent in six months and 2.85
percent by year end, Cossor forecast.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
