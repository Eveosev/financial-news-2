Tobacco companies  ITC Ltd. (ITC) , and
 Godfrey Phillips India Ltd. (GP)  rose after the Indian government
increased excise tax on fewer types of cigarettes than expected.  ITC,  India ’s largest cigarette maker, rose as much as 7.7
percent to 225 rupees in Mumbai, the highest level since its
listing in January 1991. Godfrey Phillips surged as much as 7.4
percent to 3,225 rupees.  The government will levy an additional 10 percent tax of
the current duty on cigarettes of of more than 65 millimeters,
Finance Minister  Pranab Mukherjee  said today while announcing
the nation’s annual budget. The tax will be added on an ad
valorem basis. The additional ad valorem levy will be charged on
50 percent of the retail sale price of a packet of cigarettes,
the minister said.  “Market had factored a hike in excise duty on all types of
cigarettes, which did not happen,” said Savio Shetty, analyst
with Prabhudas Lilladher Pvt. “That is a relief.”  Kolkata-based ITC sells cigarette brands such as Wills and
Gold Flake.  Excise taxes on tobacco remained unchanged in last year’s
budget, after taxes on some cigarettes were raised by as much as
18 percent the year before.  Some Indian states raised local taxes last year, which hurt
volume of sales for ITC after the company raised prices to
counter the increase.  To contact the reporters on this story:
