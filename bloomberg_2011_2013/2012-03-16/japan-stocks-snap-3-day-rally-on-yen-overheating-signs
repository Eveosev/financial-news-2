     March 16 (Bloomberg) --　Japanese  stocks  advanced for a
fourth day, capping their sixth weekly rise, after positive U.S.
data on manufacturing and employment boosted confidence in the
global recovery. Gains were limited on speculation the market
was overbought.  Sony Corp. (6758) , Japan’s No. 1 exporter of consumer electronics,
rose 0.6 percent.  Nippon Yusen K.K. (9101)  paced gains among shipping
lines after container freight rates on Pacific routes jumped
this week. Bridgestone Corp., the world’s biggest tiremaker,
fell 1 percent after a report the global rubber shortage will
deepen this year.  The broader Topix Index climbed 0.4 percent to 866.73 at
the 3 p.m. close in  Tokyo . The  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  rose 0.1
percent to 10,129.83. The benchmark gauge added 2 percent this
week, finishing its sixth weekly gain, the longest streak since
December 2010.  “The market remains in a mid-term uptrend with
expectations mounting about earnings in the next fiscal year,”
said Juichi Wako, a senior strategist at Tokyo-based Nomura
Holdings Inc. “The Nikkei is likely to stay above 10,000.”  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPXL1)  were little
changed today. The gauge gained 0.6 percent in  New York 
yesterday, rising above 1,400 for the first time in almost four
years, on reports  manufacturing  in the New York region expanded

percent over the past two days.  Canon Inc. (7751) , a camera maker that
gets more than 80 percent of its sales abroad, added 0.6 percent
to 3,970 yen.  Gains in stocks were limited as the 14-day relative
strength index for the Nikkei 225  rose  to 79, above the 70 level
that some traders see as a sign the market is overbought. The
yen rose 0.2 percent to 83.57 against the dollar yesterday. A
stronger yen decreases the value of Japanese companies’ overseas
income when repatriated.  “Investors want to take a break from the market’s rally
toward the weekend,” said Naoteru Teraoka, general manager at
Tokyo-based Chuo Mitsui Asset Management Co., which oversees
about $27.6 billion. “The U.S. is recovering for sure. The
question is if employment optimism will hold. We need a bit more
evidence to believe the economy would be fine without further
monetary easing.”  Yen, BOJ  The yen has reached an 11-month low against the dollar this
week on signs of U.S. recovery and signals the Bank of  Japan

purchases by 10 trillion yen ($120 billion) to be an appropriate
move, according to minutes released today.  The Nikkei 225 has risen about 20 percent this year, the
second-best performer after German stocks among 24 developed
markets this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.  The  Nikkei 225 Volatility Index (VNKY)  fell 7.9 percent to 20.95,
indicating traders expect a swing of about 6 percent on the
benchmark gauge over the next 30 days. Trading volume on the
