Barclays Plc (BARC) , the British lender
run by  Robert Diamond , will drop the Barclays Capital name from
its securities unit after 14 years as it tries to offer clients
more services from across the bank.  The change, which takes effect from March 19, will also see
the Barclays Wealth division trade under the Barclays name
alone, said a person briefed on the plans, who declined to be
identified before the change is implemented.  Barclays Capital, led by  Rich Ricci  and Jerry Del Missier,
has used the brand since 1997, when the bank dropped the
equities, equity capital markets and mergers and acquisition
advisory businesses of Barclays de Zoete Wedd to focus on fixed-
income. Diamond, who became chief executive officer last year,
is starting a “One Barclays” initiative to cross-sell more
products to clients.  “We’re delivering payments expertise from Barclaycard to
clients of the corporate bank and Barclaycard signed up 70
percent more clients from these referrals than the year
before,” Diamond said on a conference call with analysts on
Feb. 10. “This is a tangible example of what we call One
Barclays, where our people work together collaboratively.”  The move comes after the government-sponsored Independent
Commission on Banking report published in September recommended
banks insulate their consumer units from investment banking
operations in an effort to improve financial stability.  To contact the reporter on this story:
