“Evita” is back on Broadway, this
time with Ricky Martin, Elena Roger and Michael Cerveris doing
the strutting, singing and suffering.  The 1978 musical, by  Andrew Lloyd Webber  and Tim Rice, has
had many incarnations, including a film with Madonna and  Antonio Banderas . This revival is directed by the canny  Michael Grandage .  Get your tickets now so you don’t cry later.  In previews at the Marquis Theatre, 1535 Broadway, for an
April 5 opening. Information: +1-877-250-2929;

and the attention of dance-music fans.  Catch them tonight at Terminal 5.  Justice’s latest album, “Audio, Video, Disco,” combines
heavy metal with Europop, and somehow it’s much better than you
might expect.  At 610 West 56th Street. Information: +1-212-582-6600;

“Gossamer Gallants,” in which the men are amatory flies
circling predatory female dancers.  Also on the program: the tender “Roses” and “Promethean

still going strong.  Runs through April 1 at the David H. Koch Theater at

studio.  Directed and written by Corinna Belz, the documentary

what he’s done from different angles, at times destroying it.  The film also depicts Richter exhibitions in Cologne,
Munich,  London  and  New York .  Runs through March 27 at Film Forum, 209 W. Houston St.
