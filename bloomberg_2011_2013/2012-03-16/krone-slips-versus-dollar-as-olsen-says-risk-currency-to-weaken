The krone fell against the dollar
as central bank Governor Oeystein Olsen said there’s a risk for
investors that the  Norway ’s currency will weaken.  The krone depreciated 0.1 percent to 5.7883 per dollar at
10:14 a.m. London time, after strengthening to 5.7643.  “At some point there is a risk for investors that the
krone weakens,” Olsen said in an interview in Oslo today. “For
short-term investors this is a risk that we have underlined
may times, we are not like the Swiss franc, we are not as
voluminous, so the door is much more narrow than in
 Switzerland .”  To contact the reporter on this story:
