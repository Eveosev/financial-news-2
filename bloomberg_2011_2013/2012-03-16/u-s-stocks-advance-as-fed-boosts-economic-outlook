U.S. stocks  rose for the fifth
straight week as the  Federal Reserve  raised its assessment of
the economy and let banks such as  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  boost
dividends after reviewing their financial strength.  JPMorgan rallied 8.6 percent to help lead financial shares
in the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  to a 5.9 percent advance, the
most among 10 industries.  Bank of America Corp. (BAC)  surged 22
percent.  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  increased 7.4 percent and topped $600 for
the first time during the week as the company started selling
its new iPad.  Alcoa Inc. (AA)  and  General Electric Co. (GE)  rose more than
6 percent after the Fed said the economic outlook has improved
and strains on global markets have eased.  The S&P 500 rose 2.4 percent to 1,404.17 for the week,
climbing to the highest level since May 2008. It has rallied 10
out of 11 weeks this year. The  Dow Jones Industrial Average 
rallied 310.6 points, or 2.4 percent, to 13,232.62.  “The main theme for this week has been positive economic
numbers,” Chad Morganlander, a Florham Park, New Jersey-based
money manager at Stifel Nicolaus & Co., which oversees more than
$116 billion in client assets, said in a telephone interview.
For banks, “a major overhang for them has been alleviated due
to the successful stress tests.”  Stocks gained after the central bank said on March 13 that
the economic outlook has improved as the labor market gathers
strength. Claims for jobless benefits matched the lowest level
in four years, according to Labor Department data released two
days later. The Fed also said 15 of the 19 largest banks would
maintain adequate capital levels in a severe recession even if
they kept paying dividends and buying back stock.  Bull Market Extended  U.S. stocks completed the third year of a  bull market  that
followed the global financial crisis, rallying on speculation
the economy will continue to recover from the worst contraction
since the Great Depression amid low  interest rates . The  S&P 500 
has risen 28 percent from its 2011 low in October on better-
than-estimated earnings and  economic data . The gauge is up 12
percent in 2012, poised for its best first quarter since 1998.
The index is still 10 percent below its October 2007 record of
1,565.15.  Financial shares in the S&P 500 increased the most in the
S&P 500 for the week, advancing 5.9 percent on the Fed’s
positive evaluation of the economy and stress-test results.
Industrial and technology companies had the second- and third-
biggest gains, adding more than 3 percent. Utilities were the
only group to decline, losing 0.5 percent.  Financials Rally  Financial companies  were boosted after most banks passed
the Fed’s stress tests. Bank of America rose 22 percent to
$9.80, the most of any company in the S&P 500, driven by its
positive test results. It was one of six bank-holding companies
with large trading, private equity and derivatives activities to
be tested against a hypothetical “global market shock.”  JPMorgan also passed its stress test, pushing its stock up
8.6 percent for the week to $44.57. The company raised its
quarterly  dividend  20 percent to 30 cents per share following
its completion of the test. It also authorized a $15 billion
stock-repurchase program, with $12 billion approved for 2012.  Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC) , the biggest U.S. lender by market value,
rose 7 percent to $33.89 after increasing its quarterly  dividend 
by 83 percent to 22 cents a share.  ‘Embolden Investor Confidence’  “These dividend moves embolden investor confidence of an
improving outlook for the financial health of the banking
industry,” said Morganlander. “It’s pushed forward a positive
message that the major U.S. banks are well-capitalized.”  Thomas Lee , JPMorgan’s chief U.S. equity strategist, and
 Jonathan Golub , his counterpart at UBS AG, said in reports that
financial companies may add to their current rally if longer-
term interest rates continue to rise, boosting profitability
from lending. Ten-year Treasury yields surged 27 basis points,
or 0.27 percentage point, to 2.29 percent during the week as
growing economic optimism diminished demand for the relative
safety of  U.S. debt .  The  S&P Information Technology index  rose 3.1 percent for
the week as Apple started selling its new iPad. Apple, which
makes up 21 percent of the index, gained 7.4 percent to $585.57
after touching a record $600.01. The new  iPad  is the biggest
upgrade yet to Apple’s tablet before Microsoft Corp. introduces
new software for competing devices.  “Depending on how that does and how the first quarter
looks for them, that could be some further exciting news for the
market,” John Carey, who helps oversee about $220 billion at
Pioneer Investments in  Boston , said in a telephone interview.  Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD)  gained 8.2 percent to $8.20.
The second-largest maker of processors for personal computers
was upgraded to buy from hold at Jefferies Group Inc. on
projected market-share gains and improving manufacturing output.
 Corning Inc. (GLW) , the largest maker of glass for flat-panel
television sets, rose 7.8 percent to $14.33.  “We don’t have any earnings right now, so people are
looking more at the macroeconomic news and taking encouragement
from that,” said Carey. “Over the next couple of weeks we’ll
start to have some more company-specific news that could move
the market.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
