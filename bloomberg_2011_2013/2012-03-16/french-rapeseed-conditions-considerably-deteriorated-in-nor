Rapeseed conditions in parts of
northeast  France  deteriorated “considerably” this week after
damage from freezing weather, according to Cetiom, the country’s
technical center for oilseed crops.  Damage became apparent this week particularly in the
Lorraine region and the Burgundy plains, Paris-based Cetiom
wrote in a  report  on its website today.  “With the return of active growth, the most damaged plants
that until now had survived are disappearing little by little,
reducing to a greater or smaller degree the density of the
fields,” Cetiom wrote.  Rapeseed in the Lorraine region was exposed to temperatures
of minus 16 to minus 15 degrees Celsius (3.2 to 5 degrees
Fahrenheit) last month with no snow cover, Cetiom reported in
February. France was the European Union’s largest grower of
rapeseed last year after winter kill in  Germany ’s crop.  “On the whole this doesn’t fundamentally change the
outlook for plowing over, which is ongoing but should remain
limited,” Cetiom wrote. “Nevertheless, while the plowing over
of rapeseed is rarely justified, the yield potential of the
crops is affected by the numerous plant losses.”  Editors: Nicholas Larkin, Dan Weeks  To contact the reporter on this story:
