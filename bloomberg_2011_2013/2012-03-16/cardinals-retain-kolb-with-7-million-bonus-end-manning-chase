The  Arizona Cardinals  have decided
to retain quarterback  Kevin Kolb , a $7 million investment that
ended the National Football League team’s pursuit of four-time
Most Valuable Player Peyton Manning.  The Cardinals kept the 27-year-old Kolb on their roster
past today’s 4 p.m. Eastern deadline, activating a $7 million
bonus in his contract, team spokesman Mark Dalton said in an e-
mail. The news comes the same day that ESPN reported the 35-
year-old Manning, the league’s most-coveted free agent, worked
out earlier this week with the San Francisco 49ers and intends
to throw for the Denver Broncos and Tennessee Titans.  “Acquiring Peyton Manning is no longer an option for us,”
Cardinals coach Ken Whisenhunt said in an e-mailed release. “In
the end it didn’t work out, but from our perspective it was very
positive and we certainly don’t have any regrets about it.”  Kolb signed a six-year, $65 million contract with  Arizona 
last year after a trade from the  Philadelphia Eagles , according
to the NFL Network. The team finished 8-8 in 2011, failing to
make the playoffs for the second consecutive season.  -- Editor: Rob Gloster  To contact the reporter on this story:
