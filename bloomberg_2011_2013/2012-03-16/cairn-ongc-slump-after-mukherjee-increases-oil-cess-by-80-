Cairn India Ltd. (CAIR)  led Indian oil
explorers lower in Mumbai trading after Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee proposed an 80 percent increase in the cess payable on
local crude production.  Cairn India  slumped  as much as 7.4 percent to 340.85
rupees, the biggest intraday decline since Aug. 5, and traded at
344.40 rupees at 1:32 p.m. in Mumbai.  Oil & Natural Gas Corp. (ONGC) ,
the biggest energy explorer, fell 5.4 percent, the most since
Jan. 27, and  Oil India Ltd. (OINL)  declined 5.1 percent.  The cess will increase to 4,500 rupees ($89) a metric ton
from 2,500 rupees, Mukherjee said while presenting his budget
proposals in parliament in New Delhi today. The levy will reduce
state-run ONGC’s revenue by 50 billion rupees a year, former
chairman  R.S. Sharma  said by telephone from New Delhi.  “This is directly going to affect the explorers’ profit,”
said Rina Sanghavi, a Kolkata-based research analyst at SPA
Securities Ltd. “This is the biggest negative for the explorers
in the budget speech today.”  India’s government is seeking to increase revenue as it
struggles to reduce its budget deficit amid slowing economic
growth. Mukherjee increased excise duty and service tax in his
budget recommendations for the year starting April 1.  India produced 31.9 million metric tons of crude oil in the
10 months to January, 1.5 percent higher than a year earlier,
according to oil ministry  data . ONGC reported sales of 181.2
billion rupees and  net income  of 67.4 billion rupees in the
three months ended Dec. 31.  To contact the reporter on this story:
