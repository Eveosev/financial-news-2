The  Miami Dolphins  don’t expect to
sign free-agent quarterback Peyton Manning and have turned their
attention to former Green Bay Packers backup Matt Flynn, the
Miami Herald reported today.  The Dolphins, interested in acquiring a quarterback during
the  National Football League ’s free-agency period, are focusing
now on the 26-year-old Flynn, the  newspaper said  citing an
identified person close to the team. Manning, a four-time league
Most Valuable Player, is expected to sign with the Denver
Broncos, Arizona Cardinals or Tennessee Titans, according to
ESPN.  Joe Philbin, hired as the Dolphins’ coach in January, spent
the last four seasons as Flynn’s offensive coordinator. Flynn,
who wasn’t re-signed to back up  Aaron Rodgers  in Green Bay, is
visiting the Seattle Seahawks and planning to meet with the
Dolphins this weekend, the newspaper said.  Flynn was a seventh-round pick in the 2008 draft and spent
four seasons as a backup to Rodgers, a two-time Pro Bowl
selection. Flynn has made two NFL starts, including the Packers’
final-week victory over the  Detroit Lions  last year, when he was
31-for-44 for 480 yards with six touchdown passes and one
interception.  Miami has started four quarterbacks in the past two years -
- including Chad Henne, who signed this week with the
 Jacksonville Jaguars , and Matt Moore, who is entering the final
year of a two-year, $5 million contract. The team has made the
playoffs once in the past 10 seasons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
