The  news  March 7 that Brazil's central bank had reduced its benchmark  interest rate  by 75 basis points, to 9.75 percent, took the market by surprise. The cut wasn't unexpected. The bank has been trimming Brazil's Selic interest rate, one of the world's highest, since August. But the reduction was larger than expected, and the decision wasn't unanimous: Five members voted for it, two against. The bank's move was also complicated by  recent news  that Brazil's economy had grown a disappointing 2.7 percent in 2011 -- less than the government had hoped for and significantly less than 2010's figure of 7.5 percent.  Industrial production , too, was down 2.1 percent in January compared with the previous month. In the week since the announcement,  Brazil 's noisy Internet has been roiled with debate over the economy -- and second-guessing of the bank's decision. Paulo Pereira da Silva, president of the workers' union Forca Sindical, argued on the union's website that  the rate cut wasn’t enough : On the other side, Gustavo Loyola, a former central bank president, told the Estado de Sao Paulo newspaper that he thought the cut could have been too "accelerated" and  warned of potential inflation : Beyond the immediate interest-rate decision, plenty of blame was being spread around about Brazil's worsening economic picture. Brazilian President  Dilma Rousseff  on March 1 had launched an attack on developed countries for creating a "currency war based on an expansionary monetary policy," reported Globo’s G1 news website. In her speech, given at a ceremony in Brasilia to mark the signing of a new agreement for workers' rights, Rousseff launched a buzzworthy  new economic phrase  to describe developed countries' efforts to "artificially devalue" their currencies: The phrase "monetary tsunami" took flight the next few weeks, repeated by politicians such as Finance Minister  Guido Mantega  to explain the dangers of a strengthening real. Jim O'Neill , chairman of Goldman Sachs Asset Management and the Brazil expert who coined the term "BRICs,"  told Bloomberg News  March 12 that the real needed to lose 20 percent of its value to become sustainable. "Brazil’s biggest cyclical challenge is to get rid of the strength of the real," he said. O'Neill added that he supported the central bank's decision to reduce the Selic. Luiz Lemos Leite, the president of the financial association Anfac and a former central-bank director, argued in the Gente de Opiniao March 8 that improving Brazil's economy would take more than changes in monetary policy. What was needed was reform of the country’s "anachronistic" tax regime, whose "high costs to society" inhibited competitiveness.  He said : In an editorial March 12, the  business daily Valor agreed , and expressed sympathy with the government's "torments" about the overvaluation of the real and the peaks and troughs of the economy. Brazil needs to resolve a long list of "structural" questions, the editorial said -- such as excessive taxes, a low savings rate, lack of investment, a scarcity of long-term financing instruments, deficiencies in education and a dearth of skilled labor. "The measures that are being adopted," Valor said, "don't give structural responses to these questions." In this volatile scenario, with Brazil determined to protect itself from what it sees as outside monetary threats, many are predicting that  more interest-rate cuts  are likely. The central bank's Monetary Policy Committee meets again in April. And whether it decides to keep cutting or not, the bank is unlikely to come out of the firing line anytime soon. Nothing quite animates the Brazilian media like the country’s own economic performance. (Dom Phillips is the Rio de Janeiro correspondent for World View. The opinions expressed are his own.)
