Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)  informed the
government of Iraq it froze its contracts with the semi-
autonomous region of Kurdistan.  “We received the letter from Exxon to freeze the oil
contract with Kurdistan,” Iraqi Oil Minister Abdul Kareem al-
Luaibi told reporters today in Paris. Entry into Kurdistan will
“depend on a new oil and gas law and if it’s approved there is
a good chance to solve all the problems with Kurdistan.”  Iraq received a letter from Exxon March 5 and the company
may be allowed to join a next bidding round for oil contracts
“if we receive another letter on this issue,” al-Luaibi said.  Exxon spokesman  Alan Jeffers  said by e-mail he declined to
comment on al-Luaibi’s comments.  Iraq ’s central government has so far refused to recognize
production-sharing agreements between foreign companies and
Kurdistan, home to about 40 percent of Iraq’s 115 billion
barrels of reserves. The central government insists on service
contracts with foreign companies, rather than production-sharing
contracts, and says it needs to pre-approve any agreements
concerning energy resources.  Production from Kurdistan is more than 180,000 barrels a
day and the central government is receiving about 70,000 barrels
a day, the Iraqi minister said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
