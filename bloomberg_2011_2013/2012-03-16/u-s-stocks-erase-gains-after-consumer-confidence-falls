U.S. stocks erased gains after a
gauge of  consumer confidence  unexpectedly declined, tempering
optimism about the world’s largest economy.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slipped less than 0.1
percent to 1,402.34 at 9:55 a.m. in  New York  after climbing 0.2
percent earlier.  The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan preliminary
index of consumer sentiment fell to 74.3 in March from 75.3 the
prior month. The gauge was projected to rise to 76, according to
the median forecast of 70 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.  Stocks rallied  this week , Treasuries slid and money-market
rates rose after the Federal Open Market Committee members
raised their assessment of the  U.S. economy  on March 13 and
reports yesterday showed manufacturing in the New York and
Philadelphia regions topped forecasts while jobless claims
declined.  The  S&P 500  is on pace for the best first quarter since
1998, after rallying 12 percent, amid better-than-estimated
economic and corporate reports. It trades at 14.5 times reported  earnings, the highest valuation level since July while still
below the average since 1954 of 16.4 times earnings. Financial
and technology shares had the biggest gains among 10 groups in
the quarter, surging at least 20 percent.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
