The Argentine provinces of Neuquen
and Mendoza are considering ending  YPF SA (YPFD) ’s oil operating
licenses if it doesn’t boost production, while La Pampa province
is also demanding higher output, newspaper  Clarin  reported.  Neuquen governor Jorge Sapag and Mendoza governor Francisco
Perez can end YPF’s licenses if they aren’t satisfied with its
investment plan, Clarin reported, without saying where it got
the information. Mendoza gave YPF a March 19 deadline to present
its investment projects and Neuquen a day later, Clarin said.  La Pampa province governor Oscar Jorge is demanding that
YPF, controlled by  Repsol YPF SA (REP) , increase its production by 15
percent, according to Clarin.  To contact the reporter on this story:
