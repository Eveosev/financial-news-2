Pioneer Food Group Ltd. (PFG) , a South
African producer of cereals and fruit juice, declined the most
in seven months after saying earnings will drop as volumes
slumped.  The stock lost as much as 4.4 percent and traded 3.6
percent lower at 59 rand as of 3:25 p.m. in Johannesburg, its
biggest drop on a closing basis since Aug. 8.  Earnings per share for the six months through March 31,
including a charge related to a black economic empowerment deal,
will be between 45 percent and 55 percent lower compared with
the year-earlier period, the Paarl, South Africa-based company
said in a statement. Volumes shrank between 4 and 6 percent on
average “as consumer spend remains constrained,” it said.  “This is a shocking result and was not expected,” Chris Gilmour, a portfolio manager at Johannesburg-based Absa Asset
Management, said. “They are citing big increases in costs, but
with volumes down it points to them losing market share.”  The full earnings are expected to be released on May 21.  To contact the reporter on this story:
