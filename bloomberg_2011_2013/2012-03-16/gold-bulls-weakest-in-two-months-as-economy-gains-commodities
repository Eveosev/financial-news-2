Gold traders are the least bullish
in two months after prices erased more than half of this year’s
gain on speculation that a strengthening U.S. economy will
dissuade the  Federal Reserve  from buying more debt.  Thirteen of 26 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg expect prices
to gain next week and four were neutral, the lowest proportion
since Jan. 20.  Hedge funds  cut bets on a rally by the most since
August 2008 in the week ended March 6, Commodity Futures Trading
Commission data show. Prices fell to an eight-week low March 14,
15 percent below September’s record, and are now below the 200-
day moving average, a sign of more declines to some investors.  Gold slid and the dollar gained after Fed policy makers
raised their assessment of the economy March 13. The Fed is
unlikely to start new quantitative easing and may raise  interest
rates  as early as mid-2013, according to UBS AG. Bullion doubled
since debt buying began in December 2008 and rates fell to near
zero. The combined market capitalization of global stocks jumped
$5.7 trillion this year on mounting confidence about growth,
data compiled by Bloomberg show.  “Everything’s beginning to look as if it’s turning the
corner, we’ve passed the point of maximum despair,” said  Nick Moore , the head of commodity research at Royal Bank of Scotland
Group Plc in London. “A number of things which would have kept
people with an eye on the upside for gold have now been
neutralized. Gold can now settle back.”  Standard & Poor’s  Gold had risen as much as 14 percent to $1,792.70 an ounce
by Feb. 28 on the Comex in New York, before tumbling 7.6 percent
to $1,656 by today. This year’s gain of 5.7 percent compares
with a 9.6 percent jump in the  Standard & Poor’s  GSCI gauge of
24 commodities and a 12 percent increase in the MSCI All-Country
World  Index (MXWD)  of equities. Treasuries lost 1.7 percent, a Bank of
America Corp.  index (MXWD)  shows.  Open interest, or contracts outstanding, in U.S. futures
declined to 437,593 on March 14, from 523,284 on Sept. 6, when
prices reached a record $1,923.70. Hedge funds and other money
managers had a net-long position of 145,997 futures and options
by March 6, the fewest since the end of January,  CFTC (.MMGCNET)  data show.  That contrasts with investors in gold-backed exchange-
traded products, whose combined  holdings  reached a record
2,410.2 metric tons on March 13 now valued at $128.3 billion,
data compiled by Bloomberg show. Prices are rising for a 12th
consecutive year and will reach $1,897 by Dec. 31, according to
the average of 14 respondents in a survey at the Bloomberg Link
Precious Metals Conference in New York on March 13.  Central Banks  The decline in prices may spur central banks to add more to
reserves, RBS’s Moore said. They added 439.7 tons last year, the
most in almost five decades, and may buy a similar amount in
2012, according to the London-based World Gold Council.  “After the dramatic drop this week and all month gold is
due for a bounce,” said Adrian Day, the president of Adrian Day
Asset Management in Annapolis,  Maryland . “Given the massive
monetary easing by central banks around the world this is a good
environment for gold.”  Bullion climbed about 7 percent in the month through Feb.
28 after Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said he’s considering
additional bond purchases. The central bank bought $2.3 trillion
of debt in two rounds of quantitative easing that ended in June
2011, during which gold appreciated about 70 percent.  Job growth in the U.S. over the past six months was the
strongest since 2006, with March 9 data showing payrolls jumped
by 227,000 in February, more than economists had anticipated.
The 1.1 percent advance in February retail sales was the biggest
in five months and the Bloomberg Consumer Comfort Index reached
a four-year high in the week ended March 11.  Fund Futures  Gold generally earns holders returns only through price
gains. Federal fund futures on the Chicago Board of Trade show a
12.7 percent chance the Fed will raise borrowing costs by the
end of this year from the current range of between zero and 0.25
percent. The odds for an increase were 7.5 percent a month ago.  While physical demand from  India , the second-biggest buyer
in the fourth quarter, on March 14 was the most since January
2011, there was “limited” demand from other regions,  Edel Tully , an analyst at UBS in  London , wrote in a report yesterday.  The metal dropped below its 200-day moving average on March
6 for the first time since mid-January and is trading about $23
below that measure, a sign for some investors who study charts
of trading patterns and prices to predict trends that a rout has
further to go. The metal’s 14-day relative-strength index is at
38.9. A level of 30 indicates to some analysts who study such
charts that a rebound may be due.  Copper Bears  In other commodities, nine of 22 traders and analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg expect copper to drop next week and six
were neutral. The metal for delivery in three months, the London
Metal Exchange’s benchmark contract, rose 12 percent to $8,528 a
ton this year after declining 21 percent last year.  Eight of 16 people surveyed expect raw sugar to fall next
week and two predicted little change. The commodity gained 9.1
percent this year to 25.42 cents a pound on ICE Futures U.S. in
 New York .  Sixteen of 27 people surveyed anticipate higher corn prices
next week, while 18 of 28 said soybeans will advance. Corn rose
3.4 percent to $6.6875 a bushel this year as soybeans climbed 14
percent to $13.72 a bushel.  “Positive sentiment on the back of better-than-expected
macroeconomics data is supporting the outlook” for commodities,
said Bayram Dincer, an analyst at LGT Capital Management in
Pfaeffikon,  Switzerland . “However, it needs to be proven if
it’s investment driven or real end-user demand.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
