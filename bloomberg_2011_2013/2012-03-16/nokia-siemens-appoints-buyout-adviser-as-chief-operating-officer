Nokia Siemens Networks, the
unprofitable telephone-equipment venture of  Nokia Oyj (NOK1V)  and
 Siemens AG (SIE) , named Samih Elhage as chief operating officer
starting this month.  Elhage, a former executive at Nortel Networks Corp., worked
most recently advising private equity and management
consultants, Nokia Siemens said in an e-mailed statement.  Chief Executive Officer Rajeev Suri announced in November
the company would eliminate 17,000 jobs worldwide as it trimmed
back to focus on mobile broadband equipment and related
services. The company is divesting smaller units under the
direction of Jesper Ovesen, the executive chairman and former
chief financial officer of TDC A/S.  ’’With our strategy clearly defined and restructuring under
way, I am pleased to have Samih join us to focus on driving
operational excellence as well as improving our overall mode of
operations,’’ Suri said in the statement.  Nokia Siemens abandoned talks with private-equity companies
in July after the buyout firms failed to come up with an offer
its owners would accept.  To contact the reporter on this story:
