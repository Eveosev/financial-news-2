Five former employees of Bernard L.
Madoff Investment Securities LLC asked that prosecutors be
ordered to turn over evidence they were lied to about the firm’s
activities to help them fight charges they aided their boss’s
fraud.  Annette Bongiorno, Joann Crupi, Daniel Bonventre, Jerome O’Hara and George Perez asked U.S. District Judge Laura Taylor Swain today to order prosecutors to turn over potentially
favorable information, including statements from Frank DiPascali Jr., a key Madoff lieutenant who is cooperating with the
government.  “We seek disclosure of any and all information suggesting
that Madoff and others provided false explanations to customers,
financial institutions, and regulators or employees in order to
disguise the fact that BLMIS was not investing customer funds,”
the defendants said in papers filed in federal court in
 Manhattan .  The defendants claim the government last month turned over
partial reports of FBI interviews with DiPascali that suggest
that Madoff, DiPascali and others kept them in the dark about
the fact they weren’t investing any of their clients’ money.  The case is U.S. v. Bonventre, 10-CR-228, U.S. District
Court,  Southern District of New York  (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
