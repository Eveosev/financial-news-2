India raised the tax on imported
flat steel, aiming to lift demand for locally produced alloy and
benefitting the nation’s top producers  Tata Steel Ltd. (TATA) ,  Steel
Authority of India Ltd. (SAIL)  and  JSW Steel Ltd. (JSTL)   The tax on flat steel, used to make cars, refrigerators,
air-conditioners and other consumer electronics, was raised to
7.5 percent from 5 percent, Finance Minister  Pranab Mukherjee 
said today in his budget speech. Mukherjee also cut the tax on
imports of machinery used to mine iron ore.  Indian steelmakers have struggled with waning demand after
the nation’s central bank held its benchmark interest rate at
the highest level since 2008. A higher import tax will give the
companies some flexibility in terms of pricing, Giriraj Daga, an
analyst at Nirmal Bang Securities Ltd., said in Mumbai.  India’s steel consumption rose 5.2 percent to 62.8 million
metric tons in the 11 months to February, according to Steel
Ministry data on March 7. That compares with a 10 increase in
the same period last year.  Tata Steel rose as much as 2.4 percent to 473.85 rupees and
traded at 470.05 rupees as of 1:22 p.m. in Mumbai, while Steel
Authority increased as much as 1.8 percent to 100.50 rupees. The
benchmark Sensitive Index rose 0.3 percent.  Steel imports to  India , mainly of flat steel, rose 3.2
percent to 6.2 million tons in the 11 months to February after a
10 percent decline in the same period last year. The increase
overcame an 11 percent decline in Indian rupee since March 31.  To contact the reporter on this story:
