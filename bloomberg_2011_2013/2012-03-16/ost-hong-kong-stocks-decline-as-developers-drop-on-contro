Hong Kong   stocks  fell amid lower-
than-average trading volume as China Overseas Land & Investment
Ltd. led developers lower on slower earnings growth and
speculation China will keep controls on the property market.  China Overseas Land slid 4.7 percent, with a gauge of real-
estate companies falling the most on the Hang Seng Index.  China
Mobile Ltd. (941)  dropped 1.1 percent after Nomura Holdings Inc. cut
the phone company’s investment rating and said dividends may
disappoint.  Li & Fung Ltd. (494)  advanced after U.S. jobless claims
fell and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. added the Wal-Mart Stores Inc.
supplier to a list of top stocks.  The Hang Seng Index slid 0.2 percent to 21,317.85 at the
close in Hong Kong. For the week, the index gained 1.1 percent.
The  Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  of mainland companies
listed in the city slid 0.2 percent to 11,216.39 today, falling
for a third day after Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao said home
prices are still too high.  “With Premier Wen still emphasizing the regulation of the
property sector, investors are remaining quite cautious,” said
 Ben Kwong , chief operating officer at KGI Asia Ltd., a Hong
Kong-based brokerage. “Buying interests are still focused on
export-oriented companies on the strength of the  U.S. economy .”  The Hang Seng Index has risen 16 percent this year as U.S.
data signaled strength in the world’s biggest economy and amid
speculation China will ease monetary policy. Shares in the Hang
Seng Index traded at 10.8 times estimated earnings at the last
close, compared with 13.4 times for the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index and 11.3 times for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.  China Overseas Drops  China Overseas Land fell 4.7 percent to HK$14.64 today,
leading a measure of property shares lower. The developer
yesterday said 2011 profit growth slowed as the Chinese
government introduced measures to cool the  property market .  China Mobile slid 1.1 percent to HK$83.75 after Nomura cut
its rating on the stock to “neutral” from “buy.”  Li Ka-shing , Hong Kong’s richest man, said he won’t
withdraw his money from the city even if the candidate he
supports to lead the government loses an election on March 25.
Li said he will vote for  Henry Tang , even as the candidate’s
popularity has plummeted after a series of personal scandals.  Cheung Kong (Holdings) Ltd. (1) , the developer controlled by Li,
slid 0.3 percent to HK$109.20. Hutchison Whampoa Ltd., another
Li company, added 0.7 percent to HK$81.45. Power Assets Holdings
Ltd., also part-owned by the man ranked 14th on the Bloomberg
Billionaires Index, added 0.3 percent to HK$58.30.  U.S. Shoppers  Futures on the  S&P 500 Index (SPXL1)  slid 0.1 percent today after
the measure gained 0.6 percent in  New York  yesterday, rising
above 1,400 for the first time in almost four years.
 Manufacturing (EMPRGBCI)  in the New York region expanded in March at the
fastest pace since June 2010 and claims for jobless benefits
fell last week, matching the lowest level since 2008.  Li & Fung, which makes 65 percent of its revenue in the
U.S., rose 2.7 percent to HK$19.10. Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
raised its rating on the supplier of toys and clothes to buy
from neutral and added it to a list of top stocks. The company
may benefit as U.S. retailers rebuild inventory to meet
surprisingly firm demand from shoppers, it said.  Galaxy Entertainment Group Ltd. surged 6.6 percent to
HK$20.10, leading its peers higher after Nomura Holdings Inc.
recommended investors buy shares of the Macau casino operator.  Futures on the  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  expiring this month gained
0.1 percent to 21,339. The HSI  Volatility Index (VHSI)  eased 2.5
percent to 19.77, indicating options traders expect a swing of
about 5.7 percent in the benchmark index over the next 30 days.  “The Hong Kong market is moving pretty much sideways
without clear direction,” said KGI’s Kwong. “At this level,
the market needs further stimulus to go even higher. It lacks
further upward momentum.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
