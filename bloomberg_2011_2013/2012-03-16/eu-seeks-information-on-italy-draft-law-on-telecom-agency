The European Commission is seeking
information from  Italy  to determine if proposed legislation will
affect the powers of the national telecommunications authority.  “A national legislative provision which would restrict the
decision-making authority” of the Italian agency “would be
incompatible with EU telecoms rules,” Dennis Abbott, spokesman
at the Brussels-based commission, said in an e-mail summarizing
part of a letter the EU sent to the Italian government.  In an amendment to a draft law, Italy is seeking to boost
competition in the telecommunications market with rules to open
up network access and services, including maintenance.  The EU said there would be no “such concern” on the draft
law’s compatibility with EU law if the provision were limited to
“explicitly facilitating” the Italian agency’s exercise of its
powers, including the ability to require network operators to
set out access terms that avoid charging rivals for facilities
they don’t need.  To contact the reporters on this story:
