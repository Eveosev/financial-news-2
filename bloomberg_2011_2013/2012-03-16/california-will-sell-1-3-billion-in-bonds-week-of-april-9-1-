California (STOCA1) , the most indebted U.S.
state, plans to sell about $1.3 billion of general-obligation
bonds the week of April 9, Treasurer Bill Lockyer said today on
his website.  Citigroup Global Markets Inc. (CLQ) ,  Bank of America Corp. (BAC) ’s
 Merrill Lynch (MER)  and  Morgan Stanley (MS)  will manage the sale, according
to the  treasurer’s office . Lockyer also is selling $918.6
million of lease-revenue bonds next week to pay for prison and
courthouse construction. The state borrowed $2 billion on March
1 to refinance higher-yielding bonds.  Lockyer has said he expects to sell more than $5 billion of
general-obligation bonds this year, following a self-imposed
moratorium through most of 2011 to help curb borrowing costs.
The state offered $3.3 billion in debt in 2011, the least in
four years.  That crimped the supply of  California  state and local
bonds, which returned more than the full municipal market in
each of the past three years.  The size of the April issue and the sale date are subject
to change, said  Tom Dresslar , a spokesman for Lockyer.  To contact the reporters on this story:
