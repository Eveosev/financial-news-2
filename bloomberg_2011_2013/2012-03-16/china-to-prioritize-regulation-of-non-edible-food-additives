China will this year prioritize
regulation of non-edible additives used in the catering
industry, the State Food and Drug Administration said.  The agency urged local governments to step-up supervision
of caterers’ self-made hotpot seasoning, beverages and
flavorings, and “fight illegal use of non-food substances
including poppy capsules and powder, Sudan Red and
antibiotics,” according to a statement posted on the government
agency’s website today.  The administration also ordered standardization of the
purchase, storage and use of additives, and urged local
administrators to monitor  food safety  for rural students and
primary and junior high schools.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
