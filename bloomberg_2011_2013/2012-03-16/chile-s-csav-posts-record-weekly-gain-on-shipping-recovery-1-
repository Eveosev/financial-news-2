Cia. Sud Americana de Vapores SA ,
 Chile ’s largest container shipping company, posted a record
weekly gain in Santiago as surging global freight rates signaled
an industry recovery.  CSAV climbed 8.9 percent to 56.8 pesos at the close in
Santiago, extending a weekly advance to 34 percent.  The Shanghai Shipping Exchange’s Containerized Freight
Index rose 4.5 percent in the week to March 16, its fourth
consecutive weekly gain, according to data released today. The
index has increased 29 percent in the year to date.  Vapores had a record $1.25 billion loss last year when
slowing demand, rising fuel prices and a glut of vessels pulled
down rates, triggering efforts to cut unprofitable routes and
reduce costs. The company’s stock fell 82 percent last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
