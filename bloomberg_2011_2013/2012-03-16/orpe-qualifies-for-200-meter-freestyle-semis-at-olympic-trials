Ian Thorpe  qualified equal fifth-
fastest for the 200-meter freestyle semifinals at Australia’s
Olympic trials as he bids to swim at the London Games.  Thorpe, 29, clocked 1 minute, 49.16 to finish equal second
in his heat and post his quickest time in the event since coming
out of a five-year retirement in November. Ryan Napoleon was the
fastest qualifier with a time of 1:48.27.  “I’m very happy with the swim,” the five-time Olympic
champion told Channel Ten after the race at the SA Aquatic and
Leisure Centre in Adelaide. “It’s a pretty decent time.”  Thorpe needs to post one of the top-eight fastest times in
tonight’s semifinals to advance to tomorrow’s 200-meter final.
 Australia ’s selection policy is to pick the top two from each
event for the Olympics, with a top-six finish in the 100-meter
or 200-meter freestyle securing a place on the relay squad.
Thorpe is also scheduled to race in the 100-meter freestyle at
the weeklong trials.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
