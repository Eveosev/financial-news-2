U.S. states reduced taxes more than
they increased them for the first time in a decade, according to
a survey projecting a net decline of about $2 billion in fiscal
2012 from the preceding year.  Most of the decreases were due to the expiration of
temporary taxes, such as in  California (STOCA1) , which had the biggest
overall decline, at $8.3 billion, the  National Conference of
State Legislatures  said in a report released today. The largest
increase came in  Illinois (STOIL1) , which raised levies by $6.5 billion.  Nationwide, revenue from sales and use taxes fell by $5.2
billion, the most of any category, according to the  report . The
expiration of temporary increases in  California  and  North
Carolina (STONC1)  reduced future annual revenue in those states by $4.5
billion and almost $1 billion, respectively.  “Most states continued to face substantial budget
shortfalls during their 2011 legislative sessions,” the study
said. “The net state tax reduction is a result of temporary tax
increases expiring in a handful of states, not the result of
strong fiscal conditions.”  Not counting the expiration of the temporary taxes, states
increased levies by about $9 billion. Taxes rose $4 billion in
2010.  Personal income-tax collections rose in six states and fell
in 21, for a nationwide net increase of about $3 billion, the
report said. Twenty legislatures cut corporate taxes during
their 2011 sessions, resulting in a net decrease of $804 million
across the country.  To contact the reporters on this story:
