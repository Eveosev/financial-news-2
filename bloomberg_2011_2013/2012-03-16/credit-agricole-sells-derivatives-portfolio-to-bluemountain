Credit Agricole SA (ACA) , France’s third-
largest bank, cut risk-weighted assets by 14 billion euros ($18
billion) as its investment-banking unit sold derivatives assets
to BlueMountain Capital Management LLC.  The sale to the New York-based investment firm was part of
plans set out last year to bolster capital, said Bertrand Hugonet, a spokesman for the corporate- and investment banking
unit of  Credit Agricole  in Paris, confirming an earlier
Financial Times report. He didn’t provide further details.  Credit Agricole posted its first annual loss in 2011 as it
set aside provisions for Greek sovereign bonds and wrote down
financial investments. The French bank, which is cutting fewer
assets than larger rivals  BNP Paribas SA (BNP)  and  Societe Generale 
SA, is refocusing its corporate and investment bank by closing
operations in 21 countries, while remaining active in 32, and
ending its equity-derivatives business, it said in December.  Credit Agricole, along with BNP Paribas and Societe
Generale, is also reducing corporate- and investment-banking
jobs to rein in costs after  Europe ’s debt crisis curbed trading
revenue and regulators imposed stricter capital requirements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
