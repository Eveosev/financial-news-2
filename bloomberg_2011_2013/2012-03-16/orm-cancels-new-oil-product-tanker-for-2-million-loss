Torm A/S (TORM) , an operator of  oil
tankers  and commodity carriers, canceled an order for a new oil-
product tanker at a loss of $2 million, the Hellerup, Denmark-
based company said.  The cancellation means the company has no more vessels on
order, Roland M. Andersen, chief financial officer, said in a
statement today. The tanker was scheduled for delivery in the
second quarter of 2014. Tormâ€™s owned fleet consists of 66
product tankers and two dry bulk vessels, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
