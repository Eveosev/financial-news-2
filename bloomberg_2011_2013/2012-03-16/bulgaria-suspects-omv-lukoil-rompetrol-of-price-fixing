Bulgaria’s antitrust regulator said
four fuel retailers including the Bulgarian units of  OMV AG (OMV)  of
Austria,  OAO Lukoil (LKOH) , Russian oil producer,  Rompetrol Rafinare SA (RRC) 
and  Petrol AD (5PET)  are suspected of being involved in price fixing.  Their potential “violation consists of a banned
agreement” to set prices, which “aims to avert, limit or
hinder competition” on Bulgaria’s gasoline and diesel fuel
wholesale market, the Commission on Protection of Competition in
Sofia said on its  website  today.  The companies have 30 days to present their written
objections to the commission before it rules on the issue, it
said in the statement.  Rompetrol has always complied with all national and
international laws, the company’s Bulgarian unite said in an e-
mailed statement today. “The Commission’s allegations are
entirely groundless,” it said.  Lukoil’s press office in Moscow didn’t answer calls after
business hours and company spokesman, Gleb Ovsyannikov, couldn’t
be reached on his mobile phone. Petrol’s office in Sofia didn’t
answer calls after business hours. OMV spokesman Johannes Vetter
declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
