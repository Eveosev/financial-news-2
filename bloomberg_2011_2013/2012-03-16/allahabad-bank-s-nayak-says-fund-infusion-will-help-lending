M.R. Nayak,  executive director , at
state-owned  Allahabad Bank (ALBK) , comments on India’s annual budget
released today by Finance Minister  Pranab Mukherjee .  India more than doubled its target for a capital infusion
into state-run banks to 158.9 billion rupees ($3.2 billion) for
the year ending March 2013 as it sought to bolster risk buffers
and boost credit growth.  Nayak spoke in a phone interview from Kolkata.  “Banks have been recapitalized which will help strengthen
our position and enable us to lend more. We have asked for 10
billion rupees of capital from the government, but how much the
government will give us depends on their decision. We asked for
it three months back and expect some portion of this capital
infusion by the end of this month.  ‘‘This year’s budget will stimulate a lot of investment
across sectors. Agro-based industries will have a good future.’’  To contact the reporter on this story:
