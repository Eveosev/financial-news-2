Christian Lindner, a former general
secretary of  Germany ’s Free Democrats, will lead the party’s
efforts to win power in a May vote in the country’s most-
populous state, Handelsblatt reported, citing a decision by the
party’s state executive.  Lindner, who is a federal lawmaker, resigned his general-
secretary post this year amid plummeting support for the FDP.
The party and  Chancellor Angela Merkel ’s Christian Democrats
will challenge the Social Democrats and the Greens in the state
of North-Rhine Westphalia after SPD Prime Minister Hannelore
Kraft called a snap election this week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
