Slovenia invited bids for a 25
percent stake in Slovenska Industrija Jekla d.d., the country’s
biggest steelmaker, which is majority owned by  Russia ’s  OAO
Koks (KOKS) .  The offer to purchase 246,655 shares in the Slovenian
company is valid until March 30, the country’s agency for
managing state assets said in an e-mailed statement today.  The majority of Slovenska Industrija Jekla was bought in
2007 by Koks, a Kemerovo, Russia-based producer of raw materials
for steel making.  To contact the reporter on this story:
