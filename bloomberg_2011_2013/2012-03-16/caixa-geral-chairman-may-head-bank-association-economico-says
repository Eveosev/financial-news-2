Fernando Faria de Oliveira,
chairman of  Portugal ’s state-owned lender Caixa Geral de
Depositos SA, may be appointed president of the Association of
Portuguese Banks, Diario Economico reported, without saying
where it got the information.  Faria de Oliveira’s name has yet to be proposed to the
members of the country’s bank association and should have no
implications on his current role as chairman of Caixa Geral, the
newspaper said. He would succeed Antonio de Sousa, whose mandate
ended last year, Diario Economico said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
