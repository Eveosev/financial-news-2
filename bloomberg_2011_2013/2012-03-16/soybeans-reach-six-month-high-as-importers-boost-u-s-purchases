Wheat futures fell on speculation
that  Canada  will boost output amid rising stockpiles that are
expected to reach the highest in 12 years. Soybeans also fell.  Canadian farmers will plant 10 percent more wheat this
year, Agriculture & Agri-Food Canada said yesterday. The area
seeded with the grain will rise to 7.84 million hectares (19.4
million acres) and total production may rise 3.3 percent, the
government said. Global stockpiles may reach 209.6 million
metric tons this year, the highest since 2000, U.S. government
data show.  “The only commodity that could be challenged this year is
wheat with its important surplus,” said Jonathan Bouchet, a
trader at Boman Capital SA in Geneva. “Weather issues in  South
America  might push the grain complex to the upside for some
weeks,” with wheat being the laggard, he said.  Wheat for May delivery declined 0.5 percent to $6.615 a
bushel by 10:07 a.m. London time after yesterday surging as much
as 3.7 percent. Futures are set for a 2.9 percent gain this
week. Milling wheat on NYSE Liffe in Paris gained 0.6 percent to
215.50 euros ($281.30) a metric ton.  Soybeans declined from a six-month high on speculation that
scattered showers and thunderstorms across Parana,  Sao Paulo ,
and Mato Grosso Do Sul states in  Brazil  today will bring
moisture to crops, Accuweather.com said in a forecast.  Soybeans for May delivery lost 0.3 percent to $13.655 a
bushel in  Chicago  after earlier rising to $13.715, the highest
price for the most-active contract since Sept. 15. Futures are
up 2.1 percent this week, heading for their fifth straight
weekly advance, the longest winning streak since November 2010.  Corn for May delivery was down 0.3 percent at $6.6675 a
bushel after climbing yesterday to the highest price since Sept.
22. Futures are headed for a 3.4 percent gain this week, the
most since the five days ended Jan. 27.  To contact the reporter on this story:
