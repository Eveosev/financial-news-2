Canadian natural gas fell for the
first time in three days as warmer-than-normal weather added to
a glut of reserves in the U.S.  Alberta  gas for April delivery fell 0.3 percent following
the U.S.  Energy Department (DOENUST5)  report that stockpiles were 2.369
trillion cubic feet as of last week, 52 percent higher than the
five-year average. Demand for heat across the U.S. will trail
normal by 63 percent through March 23, according to forecaster
Weather Derivatives.  “Storage is full and the weather is warm,” said Brad Florer, a trader with Kottke Associates in  Chicago . “The bulls
are in trouble. There is still uncertainty about where the
bottom is.”  Alberta gas for April delivery slipped 0.5 cent to C$1.81 a
gigajoule ($1.73 per million British thermal units) as of 1:50
p.m. New York time on  NGX , a Canadian Internet market. NGX gas
has gained 4.6 percent this week.  Gas traded on the exchange is shipped to users in  Canada

output of most of the nation’s gas wells, was 16.6 billion cubic
feet, 213 million below target.  Pipeline Flows  Gas was flowing at a daily rate of 1.76 billion cubic feet
at Empress, Alberta, where the fuel is transferred to
TransCanada’s main line.  At McNeil, Saskatchewan, where gas is transferred to the
Northern Border Pipeline for shipment to the Chicago area, the
daily flow rate was 2.32 billion cubic feet.  Available capacity on TransCanada’s British Columbia system
at Kingsgate was 841 million cubic feet. The system was forecast
to carry 1.81 billion cubic feet today, or 68 percent of its
capacity of 2.65 billion.  The volume on  Spectra Energy’s  British Columbia system,
which gathers the fuel in northeastern British Columbia for
delivery to Vancouver and the Pacific Northwest, totaled 3.04
