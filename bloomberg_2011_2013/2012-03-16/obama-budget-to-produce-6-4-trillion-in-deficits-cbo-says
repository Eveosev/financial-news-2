President  Barack Obama ’s budget
plan would produce a $977 billion deficit next year, about $76
billion more than he estimated,  according  to the  Congressional
Budget Office .  The nonpartisan agency said in a report today analyzing the
administration’s 2013 budget request that Obama’s plan would
reduce the deficit to as little as $488 billion in 2017, though
it would start growing again in subsequent years.  The plan, if implemented without changes, would produce
$6.4 trillion in deficits over the next decade, according to the
report. That’s about $300 billion less than the Obama
administration had estimated.  “CBO found that by 2016 deficits as a share of the economy
would be below 3 percent -- a key milestone of fiscal
sustainability,” Jeffrey Zients, acting director of the White
House Office of Management and Budget,  wrote  on the agency’s
blog.  The annual report is being released as  House Republicans 
prepare to unveil their tax-and-spending plan for the upcoming
year. Their budget proposal likely will call for lower taxes, as
well as major spending cuts and an overhaul of the Medicare
health care program for the elderly.  Republicans “will advance a budget next week that restores
spending discipline, tackles the drivers of our debt and makes
good on the fundamental American promise: ensuring our children
inherit a stronger America,” House Budget Committee Chairman
 Paul Ryan  of  Wisconsin  said today in a statement.  Deficit projections beyond this year are uncertain because
lawmakers are unlikely to address a number of far-reaching
budget issues, such as the fate of the Bush-era income tax cuts,
until after the November election.  To contact the reporter on this story:
