Petroleos de Venezuela SA  will end
all ventures with  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)  after an arbitration case at
the  World Bank  is resolved, Venezuelan Oil Minister  Rafael Ramirez  said in an interview with El Mundo.  A decision on assets nationalized by Venezuela in 2007
could come at the end of this year or early 2013, Ramirez said,
according to the interview published today in the Caracas-based
newspaper. The Washington-based International Centre for
Settlement of Investment Disputes, part of the World Bank, is
handling the arbitration.  Exxon and PDVSA, as the state company is called, each have
a 50 percent stake in the Chalmette refinery in Louisiana. The
state oil company wants to convert a heavy crude upgrader at the
Petromonagas facility in  Venezuela  into a full refinery that can
process crude currently sent to Chalmette, said Ramirez.  Also, PDVSA has started a process to divest its 50 percent
stake in the Nynas AB venture with Neste OYG that operates
refineries in Sweden, Belgium and the United Kingdom, Ramirez
told the paper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
