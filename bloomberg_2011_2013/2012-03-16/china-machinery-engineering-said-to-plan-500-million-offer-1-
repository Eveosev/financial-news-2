China Machinery Engineering Corp. ,
the state-owned contractor with projects in  Iraq , Namibia and
Gabon, may raise as much as $500 million in an initial public
offering in  Hong Kong  this year, said a person with knowledge of
the matter.  The unit of  China National Machinery Industry Corp. (CNMICZ) , based
in Beijing, hired BOC International Holdings Ltd. to manage the
share sale, said the person, who declined to be identified
because the information is private.  The contractor, founded in 1978, is seeking to expand
overseas as China strengthens ties with developing nations and
secures access to raw materials in  Africa . China Machinery
Engineering’s business network already covers more than 120
countries and regions, according to the company’s website.  A Beijing-based spokeswoman for  China  National Machinery,
who declined to be named, acknowledged the plan to sell shares
in Hong Kong without providing further details.  China Machinery Engineering signed a $1.2 billion accord
with Iraq in December to build a 1,260-megawatt power station
north of Baghdad, a spokesman for the Iraqi Electricity Ministry
said on Dec. 15.  Companies have raised $926 million by selling new shares in
Hong Kong this year, compared with $470 million for the same
period last year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
