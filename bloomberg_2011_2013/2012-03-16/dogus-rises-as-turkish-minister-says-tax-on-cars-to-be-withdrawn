Dogus Otomotiv Servis & Ticaret AS (DOAS) ,
the Turkish importer of  Volkswagen AG (VOW)  vehicles, rose to a nine-
month high after Industry Minister Nihat Ergun said Turkey would
end its special consumption tax on cars.  The shares gained 4.7 percent to 4.88 liras, the highest
since June 13, by the close in Istanbul.  “The stock is spiking on talk of a special consumption tax
on autos, but there’s a long way to go,” Julian Rimmer, a
trader at CF Global Trading in London, said in an e-mailed note
to clients.  The tax will be withdrawn “over a period of time,” Ergun
said in the the western province of Kocaeli yesterday, according
to the state-run Anatolia news agency.  To contact the reporter on this story:
