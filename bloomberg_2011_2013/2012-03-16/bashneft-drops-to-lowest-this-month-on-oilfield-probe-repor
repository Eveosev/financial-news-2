OAO Bashneft (BANE)  slid to the lowest
level this month after Kommersant reported a Russian lawmaker
called on Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin  to probe the company’s
victory in the Trebs and Titov oil fields auction.  The shares slid 2 percent to 1,785 rubles as of 1:25 p.m.
in Moscow, their lowest intraday price since Feb. 29.  The letter from Sergei Karginov, a lawmaker in Russia’s
lower house of parliament, claims Bashneft illegally gained the
licenses after other companies were disqualified from the
auction and then violated the law by selling a 25 percent stake
in the project to OAO Lukoil, the newspaper said.  “Bashneft believes the information contained in the
lawmaker’s request is false and prejudicial to the business
reputation of the company and the investment climate in
 Russia ,” Bashneft said today in an e-mailed statement.  The State Duma’s switchboard was engaged when Bloomberg
News called seeking to reach the lawmaker.  To contact the reporters on this story:
