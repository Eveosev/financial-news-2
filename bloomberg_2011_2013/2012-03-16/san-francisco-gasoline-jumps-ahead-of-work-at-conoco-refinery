California-blend gasoline in  San
Francisco  strengthened against futures by the most in more than
six months after  ConocoPhillips (COP)  was said to be planning
maintenance on a hydrocracker at the  Rodeo (CPACCRUD)  refinery next month.  The Houston-based company will shut the hydrocracker, which
converts heavy hydrocarbons into lighter fuels such as high-
octane gasoline, in April for six to eight weeks of work, two
people with direct knowledge of the work said yesterday. The
128,000-barrel-a-day refinery in Northern  California  will run at
reduced rates during the maintenance, they said.  Carbob supplies  also fell 2.7 percent last week to 5.76
million barrels from a week earlier, the state Energy Department
said March 14.  Total motor gasoline stocks  tumbled 17 percent to
6.62 million barrels after refiners cut non-California gasoline
inventories.  San Francisco (MOGSD85P)  Carbob jumped 14 cents to a premium of 4.5
cents a gallon against gasoline futures traded on the  New York 
Mercantile Exchange at 4:32 p.m. in New York, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. That’s the largest rise for the fuel
since Aug. 26.  Los Angeles (MOGLDB85)  Carbob increased 13 cents, also to a 4.5-cent
premium against futures.  California-blend diesel, or CARB diesel, in  Los Angeles (DIEILCAD) 
rose 2.75 cents to a 13-cent premium to Nymex heating oil
futures.  San Francisco (DIEISCAD)  CARB diesel was unchanged at a premium of
12 cents a gallon against heating oil futures.  Tesoro Corp. (TSO) , based in  San Antonio , reported the startup of
a hydrocracker at the  Golden Eagle (TEMTCRUD)  refinery near Martinez,
California, March 14, according to a notice to Contra Costa
County regulators. Greg Goff, Tesoro’s chief executive officer,
said during a conference in  San Diego  a day earlier that the
170,000-barrel-a-day refinery was “in the final stages” of
maintenance work that began in January.  Conventional, 87-octane gasoline in  Portland (MOGHD87P) ,  Oregon , rose
7.75 cents to a premium of 2.25 cents a gallon against gasoline
futures.  To contact the reporter on this story:
