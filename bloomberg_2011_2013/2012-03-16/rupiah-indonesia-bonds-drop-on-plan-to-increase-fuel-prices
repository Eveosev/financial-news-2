Indonesia ’s rupiah was poised for a
second weekly decline and government bonds fell after global
funds cut holdings of sovereign debt on concern government plans
to raise energy prices will stoke inflation.  International investors have  pared  ownership of local notes
by 6.1 trillion rupiah ($667 million) since Feb. 22, when
President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono said fuel subsidies must be
reduced. Policy makers are discussing an increase in diesel oil
and low-octane gasoline costs, which may boost inflation to 6.8
percent this year, Bank Indonesia Governor Darmin Nasution said
last week. Consumer-price increases slowed to 3.56 percent in
February from a year earlier, the least in 23 months.  “The biggest factor driving the rupiah is still the plan
to raise fuel prices, which caused inflation expectations in
Indonesia to rise significantly,” said Mika Martumpal, an
analyst at PT Bank CIMB Niaga in Jakarta.  The rupiah fell 0.4 percent this week to 9,156 per dollar
as of 4:56 p.m. in Jakarta, according to prices from local banks
compiled by Bloomberg. It gained 0.1 percent today and
strengthened as much as 0.6 percent earlier.  The currency’s one-month implied volatility, which measures
exchange-rate swings used to price options, was unchanged today
at 8.25 percent, the lowest level in four weeks. It fell 1.25
percentage points during the week.  The yield on the government’s 7 percent bonds due May 2022
climbed 21 basis points this week, or 0.21 percentage point, to
6 percent, according to closing prices from the Inter Dealer
Market Association. The yield fell two basis points from an
eight-week high of 6.02 percent yesterday. The government will
offer 6 trillion rupiah of local-currency debt on March 20.  To contact the reporters on this story:
