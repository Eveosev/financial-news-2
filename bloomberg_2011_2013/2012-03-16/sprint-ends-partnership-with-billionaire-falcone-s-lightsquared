Sprint Nextel Corp. (S)  canceled a
network-sharing agreement with  LightSquared Inc. (SKYT) , handing
billionaire Philip Falcone his biggest setback since regulators
grounded the wireless venture last month.  Sprint said today it will return $65 million in payments it
had received from LightSquared. In a separate statement, Reston,
Virginia-based LightSquared said the return of cash gives it
“more flexibility” as it continues to push ahead toward its
goal of creating a national wireless network.  The loss of Sprint adds to concerns about the viability of
LightSquared and the future of Falcone’s $3 billion investment
in the business through his hedge fund Harbinger Capital
Partners. In February, the Federal Communications Commission
rejected the venture’s network plan over concerns about signal
interference. Harbinger managed about $4 billion at the end of
last year, down from a peak of $26 billion in mid-2008.  “This is about as bad as it could get,” said  Roger Entner , an analyst at Recon Analytics in Dedham,  Massachusetts .
“First they are blocked by the FCC and now abandoned by Sprint.
It’s the clearest sign yet that the wireless venture is
doomed.”  Sprint had given LightSquared until yesterday to get
federal approval for its network. Under the 11-year agreement
struck in June, Sprint and LightSquared would have shared
network expansion costs and equipment to operate a high-speed
network to compete with  AT&T Inc. (T)  and  Verizon Wireless .  Sprint said the termination isn’t “material” to its
business operations.  FCC Setback  Shares of Sprint rose 3.2 percent to $2.89 at the close in
 New York . Another Sprint network partner, wholesale carrier
 Clearwire Corp. (CLWR) , rose 5.6 percent to $2.27.  LightSquared had originally agreed to pay  Overland Park ,
Kansas-based Sprint $9 billion and issue an additional $4.5
billion in service credits in exchange for building and
operating the network. The deal hinged on approval from the FCC
to convert airwaves originally designated for satellite service
to communications spectrum for land-based, or terrestrial, radio
towers.  The FCC said last month it would block LightSquared’s
planned network because of potential disruptions to global-
positioning systems. The company said after the decision that it
remains committed to finding a solution.  Withdrawing U.S. approvals obtained over the past seven
years would represent an “astounding, unsupported, and
unprecedented reversal of commission policy,” LightSquared said
in a filing today, according to a summary the company
distributed by e-mail. It said the government relied on biased
tests and shouldn’t revoke permits.  CEO Departure  The FCC decision set off a series of actions by
LightSquared. Chief Executive Officer  Sanjiv Ahuja  resigned and
the company appointed Falcone to the board as it began a search
for a new CEO. LightSquared also cut 45 percent of its 330-
member staff to preserve cash.  The venture also hired litigators  Theodore Olson  and Eugene Scalia of  Gibson Dunn & Crutcher LLP (1128L)  to make sure LightSquared
doesn’t lose its multibillion-dollar investment due to the
government’s decision.  Nokia Siemens Networks, the wireless-equipment venture of
Finland’s  Nokia Oyj (NOK1V)  and  Germany ’s  Siemens AG (SIE) , said last week
that it stopped work in 2011 on the network it was building for
LightSquared.  LightSquared paid Sprint $310 million in advanced payments
for work on the network and its eventual operation. Sprint said
in a securities filing last month that it would keep most of
that if the agreement was terminated after the March 15
deadline.  Last month, LightSquared skipped a $56.3 million payment to
its partner  Inmarsat Plc (ISAT) , a British satellite operator, saying
the work promised hadn’t been finished.  Clearwire Benefiting  Falcone told Harbinger investors in February that
LightSquared is still exploring remedies like signal-filtering
technology and a possible swap of frequencies with the military.
As of the end of January, Falcone carried his investment in
LightSquared’s equity at $1.5 billion, or about half of what his
hedge fund had invested to date, according to a Harbinger
document.  The company has also hired Moelis & Co. and other advisers
to help study alternatives.  With LightSquared out of the picture, Sprint will have to
rely on Clearwire’s network to meet its users’ bandwidth
demands,  Jennifer Fritzsche , a senior analyst at Wells Fargo
Securities, said in a note.  Clearwire, which would face competition from LightSquared
should the Falcone venture start operations, said this week it
won a five-year network sharing contract from  Leap Wireless
International Inc. (LEAP)  for fourth-generation long-term-evolution, or
4G LTE, service. Leap had entered a long-term agreement with
LightSquared a year ago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
