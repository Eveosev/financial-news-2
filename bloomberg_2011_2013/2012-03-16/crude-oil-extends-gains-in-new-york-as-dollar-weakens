Crude oil extended earlier gains in
 New York  after the dollar weakened, making commodities priced in
the U.S. currency more attractive.  Oil for April delivery on the  New York Mercantile Exchange 
rose as much as 61 cents, or 0.6 percent, to $105.72 a barrel
and was at $105.69 at 12:37 p.m. London time. The Dollar Index,
which tracks the U.S. currency against those of six trading
partners, fell 0.2 percent, erasing an earlier advance of 0.3
percent.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
