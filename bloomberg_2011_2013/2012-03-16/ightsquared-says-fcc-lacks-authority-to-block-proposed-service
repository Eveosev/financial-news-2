Philip Falcone ’s  LightSquared Inc. (SKYT) 
today told the  U.S. Federal Communications Commission  it can’t
legally block the company’s proposed wireless service, calling
the agency’s proposal to do so “astounding.”  Opponents of the venture disagreed, and called on the FCC
to “act quickly” to withdraw approvals because there’s no
practical way to ease interference from LightSquared’s signals.  Both sides were reacting to the FCC’s vow last month to
block LightSquared after the Obama administration found the
wireless service would disrupt navigation gear using the global-
positioning system.  LightSquared in a filing to the FCC said it has invested
more than $4 billion as it seeks to build a high-speed data
network for as many as 260 million users. The company has relied
on a legal framework established by the agency almost seven
years ago, the company said in the filing, according to a
summary it distributed by e-mail today.  “We are not going away,”  Jeff Carlisle , an executive vice
president, said today in a conference call. “We’re in the
process of revising our business plan to extend our financial
runway, to continue to move forward over a period of quarters
and years.”  At issue are plans to let Reston, Virginia-based
LightSquared operate a network of ground-based towers over
airwaves previously reserved mainly for satellites. Users and
makers of GPS gear say the network would cause interference.
LightSquared says GPS device makers have produced defective
equipment that improperly captures its signals.  ‘Biased Tests’  The government “has relied upon flawed and biased tests,”
LightSquared said in its FCC filing, according to the summary.
“No scientifically valid evidence exists that even 1 percent of
GPS receivers would experience adverse performance consequences
as a result of LightSquared’s operations.”  Makers and users of GPS equipment said in a filing today
that tests showed LightSquared will cause harmful interference,
and the agency should revoke decisions to let LightSquared
operate a ground-based network.  “There is overwhelming evidence of interference to
critical government GPS-based systems, including those used in
defense and aviation applications,” the Coalition to Save Our
GPS said in its filing distributed by e-mail. “The FCC must act
to prevent any potential interference with those systems.”  Sprint Walks Away  Members of the organization formed to oppose LightSquared
include package shippers  FedEx Corp. (FDX)  and United Parcel Service
Inc., GPS-unit maker  Garmin Ltd. (GRMN) , Delta Air Lines Inc. and
Southwest Airlines Co., and farm-equipment maker  Deere & Co. (DE)   Sprint Nextel Corp. (S)  said today it canceled an agreement to
help build LightSquared’s network, adding to concern about the
new venture’s viability and the fate of Falcone’s $3 billion
investment in the business through his  Harbinger Capital
Partners (SKYT)  hedge fund.  LightSquared has hired litigators as it gears up for a
possible legal battle with regulators.  Tammy Sun, an FCC spokeswoman, didn’t reply to a telephone
call and e-mail seeking comment.  Harbinger managed $4 billion at the end of last year, down
from a peak of $26 billion in mid-2008. It wrote down its
LightSquared position by 59 percent last year because of the
uncertainty over LightSquared approval.  To contact the reporter on this story:
