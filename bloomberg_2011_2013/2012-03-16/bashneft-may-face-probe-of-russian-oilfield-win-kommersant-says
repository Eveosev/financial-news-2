OAO Bashneft, the Russian oil
producer controlled by billionaire Vladimir Evtushenkov’s AFK
Sistema, said it won the state’s auction of the Trebs and Titov
oil fields cleanly.  Sergei Karginov, a lawmaker from the  Liberal Democratic
Party  of Russia party, sent a letter to Prime Minister  Vladimir
Putin  seeking an investigation into the deal, Kommersant
reported today. Karginov said Bashneft illegally gained the
licenses after other companies were disqualified from the
auction and then violated the law by selling a 25 percent stake
in the project to OAO Lukoil, the newspaper said.  “Bashneft believes the information contained in the
lawmaker’s request is false and prejudicial to the business
reputation of the company and the investment climate in
Russia,” the company said today in an e-mailed statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
