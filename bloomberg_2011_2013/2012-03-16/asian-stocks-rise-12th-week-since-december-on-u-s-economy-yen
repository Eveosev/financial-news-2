Asian stocks rose this week, with
the regional benchmark index capping its 12th week of advance in
13 weeks, as positive economic reports from the U.S. boosted the
outlook for the region’s exporters.  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) , Japan’s No. 1 carmaker, climbed 4.7
percent as the yen weakened against the  U.S. dollar . Li & Fung
Ltd., a supplier of clothes and toys to Wal-Mart Stores Inc.,
advanced 7.6 percent as U.S. retail sales,  consumer confidence 
and employment reports exceeded economists’ estimates. China
Railway Construction Corp. dropped 8.9 percent after a section
of a high-speed track it built collapsed in central China’s
Hubei province following heavy rains.  “The U.S. still seems to be slowly but surely improving,
and that’s definitely improving the mood of investors,” said
 Tim Schroeders , who helps manage $1 billion in equities at
Pengana Capital Ltd. in  Melbourne . “Perhaps we are seeing a
sustained devaluation of the yen, which would improve the
outlook for Japanese exporters.”  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index rose 0.8 percent to 127.95 this
week. The measure, which has retreated for just one week since
Dec. 16, entered a  bull market  on Feb. 29, gaining more than 20

monetary easing in  Europe , Japan and  China  fueled the fastest
rally in more than two years.  Stocks in the Asian benchmark were valued at 16.8 times
estimated earnings on average, the highest level since May 2010,

times for the S&P 500 and 14.6 times for the Stoxx Europe 600

on March 11, 2011, left more than 19,000 people dead and missing
and triggered the worst nuclear crisis in 25 years.  The yen has retreated 7.8 percent this year as the
strengthening recovery in the U.S. and signs that Europe may be
able to prevent its debt crisis from worsening reduced demand
for the currency as a safe haven.  Japan Exporters  Toyota Motor Corp., Asia’s biggest carmaker by market
value, gained 4.7 percent to 3,580 yen. Hotai Motor Co., a
Taiwanese importer of  Toyota vehicles  and parts, soared 17

Inc., the camera maker, advanced 5.6 percent.  The Asia-Pacific gauge rose 12.4 percent this year through
March 16 amid growing confidence in the  U.S. economy , Europe’s
