The trucking industry’s driver
shortage would be mitigated if the U.S. government cut the
length of time people can receive jobless benefits,  Celadon
Group Inc. (CGI)  Chief Executive Officer Steve Russell said.  Reducing the eligibility period to about 15 weeks from 99
weeks would spur people who lose jobs to re-enter the labor
market more quickly, Russell said today at a Society of American
Business Editors and Writers conference in Indianapolis.  Celadon, which is based in Indianapolis and provides long-
haul trucking services in the U.S.,  Canada  and Mexico, is
“seeing the economy is OK” and that confidence among customers
is recovering, Russell added.  To contact the reporters on this story:
