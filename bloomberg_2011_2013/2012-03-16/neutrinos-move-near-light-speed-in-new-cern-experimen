A new experiment indicates that
neutrinos don’t move faster than the speed of light, adding to
evidence that an earlier measurement may have been inaccurate,
according to the institute in charge of the research project.  Measurements taken at a laboratory in Gran Sasso,  Italy , as
part of the experiment, dubbed Icarus, showed seven neutrinos
traveled in a time consistent with the speed of light, the
 European Organization for Nuclear Research , or CERN, said today
in a  statement .  CERN said in September a neutrino beam was measured in its
Opera experiment as traveling faster than the speed of light,
appearing to break the cosmic speed limit described by  Albert Einstein  in his theory of relativity in 1905. The Opera finding
may have been flawed because of a technical malfunction in
timing instruments, CERN said last month.  “The evidence is beginning to point toward the Opera
result being an artifact of the measurement,” CERN Research
Director Sergio Bertolucci said in a statement.  More experiments are scheduled to take place in May to
arrive at a “final verdict,” CERN said.  “These are difficult and sensitive measurements to make
and they underline the importance of the scientific process,”
said Carlo Rubbia, the spokesman for the Icarus experiment and a
1984  Nobel Prize winner  in physics.  Neutrinos, subatomic particles fired from CERN’s Geneva
base to a laboratory 730 kilometers (450 miles) away in Gran
Sasso were clocked at a velocity 20 parts per million above the
speed of light, the organization said in September.  To contact the reporter on this story:
