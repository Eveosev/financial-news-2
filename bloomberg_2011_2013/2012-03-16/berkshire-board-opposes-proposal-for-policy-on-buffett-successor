Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A) ’s board of
directors is opposing a shareholder proposal that the company
have a written policy to ease the eventual transition for the
replacement of Chief Executive Officer  Warren Buffett .  Buffett, 81, said last month that the Omaha, Nebraska-based
company had identified his successor, without publicly
disclosing the executive.  “The board’s judgment as to the most capable successor
could change over time and it would be highly unusual for a
public company to name a successor for its CEO prior to either
the incumbent leaving that position or to the establishment of a
specific date for the CEO to relinquish the position,” the
company said today in a regulatory filing. “It would be
inadvisable to publicly report on an annual basis its plans as
requested by the proposal or to add additional details.”  Berkshire relies on Buffett, also the chairman and head of
investments, to oversee a $77 billion stock portfolio and
operating units with more than 270,000 workers. The board’s
primary job is to ensure it has the right people running the
business and that “the next generation of leaders is identified
and ready to take over tomorrow,” Buffett said in a  letter  to
shareholders last month.  “Our proposal is intended to have the board adopt a
written policy containing several specific best practices in
order to ensure a smooth transition in the event of the CEO’s
departure,” the AFL-CIO Reserve Fund, which made the proposal,
said in a statement included in the filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
