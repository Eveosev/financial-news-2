Sanjiv Goenka, chairman, RP-Sanjiv
Goenka Group, and vice chairman of utility  CESC Ltd. (CESC) , comments
on India’s annual budget released today by Finance Minister
 Pranab Mukherjee .  Goenka’s comments were sent via e-mail.  “The widening of the base for services taxation with a
negative list of 17 socially desirable services is a rational
approach. The increase in service tax, along with the increase
in excise duty from 10 percent to 12 percent, will however raise
prices correspondingly all round. However, this measure is a
better alternative to a higher  budget deficit , which in spite of
the additional revenue of 410 billion rupees, will leave a
deficit of 5.1 percent in 2012-13.  ‘‘The Finance Minister has paid special attention to the
power sector, which needed expeditious expansion. The 100
billion-rupee, tax-free bonds for power sector, exemption of
thermal power companies from tax for 2 years, extension of
sunset clause, as also the facilitates for coal mining with
exemption from customs duty on machinery for mining and on
imported coal, will speed up development of new generating
capacities as also improvement in the plant load factor.  ‘‘The reduction in withholding tax will provide stimulus to
a number of infrastructure activities.’’  To contact the reporter on this story:
