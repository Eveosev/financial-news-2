India  plans to increase defense
spending by 17 percent for the next financial year, as the
country seeks to modernize its armed forces to keep pace with
China’s military buildup and counter traditional rivals.  Total expenditure on the country’s armed services is set to
rise to 1.93 trillion rupees ($40 billion) this year, Finance
Minister Pranab Mukherjee told parliament today as his delivered
the country’s annual budget. China announced plans last month to
increase spending by 11.2 percent this year to meet the
country’s expanding global commitments.  India’s internal security threats and rivalries with
Pakistan and China, the nuclear-armed neighbors with which it
has border disputes, have driven a tripling in defense spending
over the last decade.  The country, which is the world’s largest arms importer,
according to the  Stockholm International Peace Research
Institute , is currently negotiating with  Dassault Aviation SA (AM)  to
buy 126 warplanes in the world’s biggest fighter-jet purchase in
15 years.  To contact the reporters on this story:
