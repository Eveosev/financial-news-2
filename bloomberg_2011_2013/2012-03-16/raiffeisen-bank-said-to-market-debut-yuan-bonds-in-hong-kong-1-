Raiffeisen Bank International AG (RBI) 
said it placed 750 million yuan ($119 million) of two-year
securities in its first sale of Dim Sum bonds, according to
spokeswoman Susanne Langer.  The bonds have a coupon of 4.55 percent, Langer said in an
e-mailed statement today.  “The final coupon was 20 basis points tighter than initial
guidance, nevertheless the book was two times subscribed,” she
said. “This demonstrates that Raiffeisen is also well-received
in  Asia , where we have been present for more than 20 years. The
transaction is part of our ongoing efforts to diversify
Raiffeisen’s funding.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
