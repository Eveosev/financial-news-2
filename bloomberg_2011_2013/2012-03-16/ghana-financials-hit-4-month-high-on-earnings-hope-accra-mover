Ghana ’s financial-stocks  index  rose
to the highest in more than four months as investors look for
cost-cutting measures at the country’s biggest lender,  Ghana
Commercial Bank Ltd. (GCB) , to pay off in higher profit.  The 11-member index, which tracks the performance of banks
and insurance companies listed on the Ghana Stock Exchange, rose
for a second day, gaining 1 percent to 908.12, the highest since
Nov. 9, by the close in Accra, the capital.  Ghana Commercial gained 1.1 percent, the most since Jan. 6,
to close at 1.85 cedis, with a trading volume of 137,040 shares,
or almost five times the three-month daily average.  “The shares were bought by an international institutional
investor looking to take position in a bank with promising
prospects,” Randy Mensah, a stock trader at Accra-based
Databank Financial Services Ltd., said by phone today. Measures
taken by the lender to cut costs and reduce non-performing loans
“stand to yield greater fruits in the medium-to-long term.”  Ghana Commercial’s net income increased 7 percent to 38.3
million cedis ($21.9 million) in the nine months through
September, it said on Oct. 28. Impairment costs on loans dropped
to 4.4 million cedis from 70.9 million cedis.  Full-year results are expected by the end of this month,
said Mensah, declining to give a forecast.  UT Bank Ltd. (UTB) , a lender, rose 6.7 percent to 32 pesewas
while  Ecobank Transnational Inc. (ETI)  dropped 9.1 percent to 10
pesewas.  0  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
