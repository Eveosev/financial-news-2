U.S. farmers will plant more corn
and fewer acres of soybeans than the government forecast last
month, according to a survey of growers by  Allendale Inc.  Wheat
planting will rise for a second consecutive year, it said.  Farmers indicated they will sow 95.012 million acres with
corn, Allendale said today in an e-mailed release. That’s up
from last year’s 91.921 million acres and above the 94 million
that the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  forecast on Feb. 24.  Soybean plantings will slip to 74.495 million acres from
74.976 million last year, according to Allendale’s 23rd annual
survey of farmers. The USDA said last month that 75 million
acres would be sown this year.  The combined area planted with all wheat varieties will
rise to 56.609 million acres, according to the survey by
Allendale, a farm-market adviser and brokerage based in McHenry,
 Illinois . Last month, the USDA said farmers would sow 58 million
acres.  The USDA on March 30 is scheduled to release the results of
a national survey of farmers’ planting intentions, taken this
month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
