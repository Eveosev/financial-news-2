Peru ’s sol rose for the first time
in a week as exporters bought the currency to pay local income
tax, leading the central bank to step up dollar purchases in the
 spot market .  The sol advanced 0.1 percent to 2.67 per  U.S. dollar  at
today’s close, from 2.673 yesterday, according to Deutsche Bank
AG’s local unit. The currency was little changed this week.  Peruvian companies are paying taxes before a deadline for
monthly income tax payments next week and an April 10 deadline
for completing annual payments.  “Every year companies pay more in tax because they’re
exporting more, and each year the pressure on the currency
grows,” said Gonzalo Navarro, the head trader at  Banco
Santander  in Lima. “The central bank is there to compensate for
the lack of demand for dollars,” he said.  The central bank bought $161 million today, the most in a
week, to stem gains in the sol. It paid an average 2.6707 soles
per dollar, the bank said in a statement on its website.
Purchases this year total $5 billion, surpassing the $3.5
billion the bank purchased in all of 2011.  The yield on Peru’s benchmark 6.55 percent dollar-
denominated bond due March 2037 rose one basis point, or 0.01
percentage point, to 4.7 percent, pushing its weekly advance to
six basis points. The bond’s price fell 0.19 cent to 127.05
cents per dollar today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
