Hungarian Prime Minister  Viktor Orban  demonstrated a “complete lack of understanding of
democracy” for drawing a comparison between the European Union
and the  Soviet Union , an EU official said.  “They also fail to understand the important contribution
of all those who have defended and fought for freedom and
democracy,” European Commission spokeswoman Pia Ahrenkilde Hansen told a daily press briefing in Brussels today.  Hungarians won’t be a “colony” and won’t live by “the
dictates of foreigners,” Orban said in a speech yesterday on a
national holiday commemorating the 1848 revolution. Hungarians
will refuse the “unsolicited help of foreigners” and will
write their own Constitution, he said.  “We are more than familiar with the character of
unsolicited comradely assistance, even if it comes wearing a
finely tailored suit and not a uniform with shoulder patches,”
Orban said.  Orban, who is trying to revive bailout talks with the EU
and the  International Monetary Fund , is embroiled in a legal
dispute with the 27-member bloc, which has blocked the start of
talks. The premier pledged to address the legal concerns and
urged the EU to lift obstacles from starting bailout talks this
week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
