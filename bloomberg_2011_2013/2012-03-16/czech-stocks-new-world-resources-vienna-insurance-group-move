The Czech Republic’s  PX (PX)  stock index
rose 0.1 percent to 994.2 at its end of trading in Prague,
paring this week’s losses to 0.4 percent.  The following were among the most active equities in the
Czech market today. Stock symbols follow company names.  New World Resources Plc (NWR)   slumped to the lowest this
year after Citigroup Inc. cut the Czech mining company to
neutral from buy, citing lowered expectations for coking-coal
prices and NWR’s output. The stock fell 2 percent to 136.3
koruna, taking its losses this week to 6.6 percent.  Vienna Insurance Group AG (VIG)   jumped 2.5 percent to
