Eritrea said an Ethiopian attack on
its territory yesterday marked a decade of “incessant acts of
aggression” following a border war between the two countries.  Eritrea “shall not entertain and will not be entrapped by
such deceitful ploys that are aimed at derailing and eclipsing
the underlying fundamental issues,” the Foreign Ministry said
today in a statement on the state-owned Shabait website.  Ethiopia  launched an attack on three military camps about
16 kilometers (10 miles) inside Eritrea, where Ethiopian rebels
are allegedly trained,  Shimeles Kemal , the Ethiopian minister of
state for communications, told reporters in Addis Ababa, the
capital. It accuses the government in Asmara of backing
insurgents who strike its territory, including a January
incident in which five European tourists were killed. Eritrea
denies the accusations.  Eritrea and Ethiopia fought a border war from 1998 to 2000
that killed 70,000 people, according to the Brussels-based
 International Crisis Group . The dispute that caused the conflict
hasn’t been resolved and troops from both sides still maintain a
presence on parts of the frontier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
