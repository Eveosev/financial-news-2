Morgan Stanley (MS)  Chief Executive
Officer  James Gorman  said he told staff not to circulate a
 Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  employee’s op-ed criticizing that firm
and that it wasn’t fair for a newspaper to publish it.  “I was surprised that anyone would run an op-ed piece
based upon the view of a single employee,” said Gorman,
speaking at an event in New York hosted by Fortune magazine.
“To pick a random employee, I just don’t think it’s fair, and I
didn’t think it was balanced.”  The Goldman Sachs employee,  Greg Smith , assailed that
firm’s top managers and treatment of clients while explaining in
a New York Times op-ed why he was quitting. Goldman Sachs said
it disagrees with his assertions. The New York-based firm sent a
memo to current and former employees, saying most of its workers
believe it provides exceptional service to clients.  Gorman joins JPMorgan Chase & Co. CEO Jamie Dimon in
warning executives not to take advantage of the op-ed, which has
opened a public debate over how New York-based Goldman Sachs
treats customers. Goldman Sachs’s shares lost $2.15 billion in
value on March 14, the day it was published.  “At any point in time, somebody’s unhappy with me, with
the organization, with the board, with the direction of the
firm,” Gorman said. “There but for the grace of God go us.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
