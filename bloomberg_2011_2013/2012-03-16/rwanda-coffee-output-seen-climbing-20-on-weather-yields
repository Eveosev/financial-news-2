Rwanda ’s coffee production may
climb as much as 20 percent to 24,000 metric tons this year
because of good weather and a high yield, the state-run National
Agricultural Exports Board said.  Output may rise from 20,000 tons last year, Robinah Uwera,
the agency’s marketing director, said today by phone from
Kigali, the capital.  “This year we expect bigger production because of a high
yield crop cycle and good weather,” Uwera said. “The cycle
alternates such that when you have a good yield this year it
falls the following season.”  Harvesting in the central African nation, which produces
mostly arabica beans, started last month, she said. The country
exports more than 98 percent of its crop, according to the
Eastern African Fine Coffee Association.  The agency had targeted output of 40,000 tons for 2011 two
years earlier. The sector failed to meet the projection because
of insufficient production of coffee cherries and weak
management, the agency said on its website. The East African
region had the worst drought in 60 years last year, which also
affected agricultural ouput.  Coffee and tea are Rwanda’s major crop exports. The nation
earned $75 million from coffee bean shipments in 2011, compared
with $56 million a year earlier, because of improved global
prices, Uwera said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
