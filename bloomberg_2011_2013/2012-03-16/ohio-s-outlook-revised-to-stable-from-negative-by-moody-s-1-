Ohio (STOOH1)  had its credit outlook
upgraded to stable from negative by Moody’s Investors Service,
which cited “modest improvement” in its financial position and
a stabilizing economy.  The ratings company today assigned the negative outlook in
August 2009. Moody’s reaffirmed its rating on $7.8 billion of
general-obligation debt of Aa1, one step below the top grade,
the company said in a press release.  Moody’s said the change reflects an expectation that the
state will return to structural balance in fiscal 2013 and that
“ Ohio (STOOH1) ’s economy and demographics will continue to stabilize,
given recent growth in manufacturing, health care and energy
exploration.”  Governor  John Kasich  said his administration has tried to
emphasize to the rating companies that  Ohio  has a diversified
economy and approach to economic development beyond just
manufacturing.  “The ability to show them that Ohio’s not a one-trick pony
matters,” Kasich told reporters today in Columbus.  To contact the reporter on this story:
