ArcelorMittal (MT) ’s Kazakh unit plans
to boost rolled steel shipments to Russia and the former Soviet
republics by a third this year as sales to Iran are hindered by
sanctions on money transfers imposed by Europe and the U.S.  The company plans to ship about 2 million metric tons to
Russia and its former satellites, after about 1.5 million tons
last year, Roman Ilto, a spokesman for the company, said today
by phone. ArcelorMittal Temirtau plans to boost total sales to
3.4 million tons of rolled steel from 3.2 million tons, he said.  U.S. and European Union leaders are increasing pressure on
Iran over its nuclear program, which the Tehran government says
is for civilian purposes. The Society for Worldwide Interbank
Financial Telecommunication, or Swift, the dominant messaging
service for international financial transactions, said yesterday
it would block its operations for about 24 Iranian lenders
sanctioned by the EU, including the central bank.  ArcelorMittal Temirtau’s customers in  Iran  have been unable
to make payments, Sunil Sankaranarayanan, a marketing manager
said today, according to Interfax. The company has sold 35,000
tons of steel products to Iran, Interfax cited him as saying.  “We cannot confirm any plans for shipments to the Middle
East markets, given the uncertainties in that region,” Ilto
said. The company will also deliver steel to China,  Southeast
Asia  and the  Indian subcontinent , he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
