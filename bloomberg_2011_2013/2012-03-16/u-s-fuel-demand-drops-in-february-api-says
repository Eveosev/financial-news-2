U.S. fuel demand dropped to the
lowest level for February in three years as consumption of
residual oil tumbled because of falling prices for competing
natural gas, the  American Petroleum Institute  said.  Total deliveries of petroleum products, a measure of
demand, declined 2.3 percent to 18.4 million barrels a day last
month from February 2011, the industry-funded group said today
in a report.  Consumption of residual fuels plunged 40 percent to 375,000
barrels a day last month, the report showed. Residual fuel is
used for commercial and industrial heating, electricity
generation and ship propulsion. Demand for all other oils, a
category that includes liquefied petroleum gas, fell 4.3 percent
to 4.19 million barrels a day.  “The steep decline in residual fuel demand is related to
users switching to natural gas,” according to the report.  Natural gas touched $2.204 per million British thermal
units on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  on March 13, the
lowest intraday price since February 2002. Gas for April
delivery dropped 0.5 cent to $2.279 yesterday on the exchange.  Consumption of distillate fuel, the category that includes
heating oil and diesel, rose 0.6 percent to 3.89 million barrels
a day in February. Use of ultra-low sulfur diesel, the type used
on highways, climbed 2.6 percent to average 3.44 million barrels
a day. Heating-oil demand tumbled 10 percent to 455,000 barrels
a day in February, compared with the same month in 2011.  Gasoline consumption rose 0.9 percent to 8.72 million
barrels a day last month. It was the first year-on-year demand
gain since February 2011, the API said.  U.S. crude-oil production increased 2.9 percent to 5.78
million barrels a day in February. Output in the lower 48 states
rose 3.3 percent to 5.17 million barrels a day. Alaskan
production slipped 0.2 percent to 610,000 barrels a day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
