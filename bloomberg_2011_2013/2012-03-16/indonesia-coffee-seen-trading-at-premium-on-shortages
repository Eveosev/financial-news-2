Buyers of coffee from Indonesia,
the third-largest robusta grower, continue to pay a premium for
the beans because of a shortage and high domestic prices,
according to Volcafe, the coffee unit of ED&F Man Holdings Ltd.  Indonesia beans for shipment in April and May were at a
premium of $100 a metric ton to the price on the NYSE Liffe
exchange, data from the Winterthur, Switzerland-based trader
show. That’s unchanged from the previous week. Beans from the
country were at a discount at this time last year.  “Exporters are hesitant to offer any nearby shipment due
to the lack of bean supply and high domestic prices,” Volcafe
said in a report to clients e-mailed today. “Internal
differentials remain firm due to local roasters who pay up.”  Differentials refer to a premium or a discount paid to
obtain physical coffee in relation to the futures price. Local
prices were at 19,000 Indonesian rupiah ($2.08) to 20,500 rupiah
a kilogram (2.2 pounds) today, the trader said. Rains in growing
regions are hampering picking and drying of beans, according to
the report.  In  Vietnam , the world’s biggest robusta grower, the weather
is favorable for crop development, Volcafe said. Local prices
are at 40,000 dong ($1.92) a kilogram, according to the report.  Vietnamese beans for April and May shipments were at a
premium of $10 a ton above the price on NYSE Liffe, unchanged
from last week, data from the trader show.  Robusta coffee for May delivery fell 0.3 percent to $2,027
a ton by 1:16 p.m. on NYSE Liffe in  London .  To contact the reporter on this story:
