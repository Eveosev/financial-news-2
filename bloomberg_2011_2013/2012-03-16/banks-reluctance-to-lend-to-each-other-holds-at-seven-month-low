European banks’ reluctance to lend
to one another held at the lowest in seven months, according to
a money-market indicator.  The Euribor-OIS spread, the difference between the euro
interbank offered rate and overnight indexed swaps, was little
changed at 51 basis points at 8:15 a.m. in  London , data compiled
by Bloomberg show. That’s the lowest since Aug. 8.  The cost for banks to convert euro interest payments into
dollars held at the lowest level in seven months. The three-
month cross-currency  basis swap  was little changed at 58 basis
points below Euribor.  The one-year basis swap was at 50.5 basis points less than
Euribor from minus 50 yesterday. A basis point is 0.01
percentage point.  Lenders increased  overnight deposits  at the ECB yesterday
to 728 billion euros ($952 billion), up from 686 billion euros
on March 14.  To contact the reporter on this story:
