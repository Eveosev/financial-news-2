Sachin Tendulkar became the first
player to score 100 international cricket centuries during
 India â€™s Asia Cup one-day game against  Bangladesh , ending his
yearlong wait to reach the milestone.  Tendulkar, the leading run-scorer in Test and one-day
matches, reached his hundred with a single off Shakib Al Hasan
at the Sher-e-Bangla National Cricket Stadium in Dhaka. He now
has 51 centuries in elite five-day Tests and 49 in one-dayers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
