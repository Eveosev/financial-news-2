Ethanol advanced for the fifth time
in six sessions because of higher production costs and
speculation that producers will curtail output.  Futures followed corn higher on concern that  China  will
increase purchases from the U.S., making ethanol more costly to
produce. An Energy Department report March 14 showed  stockpiles 
of the fuel alternative fell for the first time since Dec. 9.  “Corn continues to go up and that would be supportive for
ethanol,” said Ian Jackson, a trader at SCB & Associates in
 Chicago . “The report this week finally showed a little bit of a
draw, so as a producer they’re hoping to see that dwindle.”  Denatured ethanol for April delivery climbed 1.8 cents, or
0.8 percent, to $2.355 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade,
highest price since Dec. 5. Prices have gained 6.9 percent this
year and have gained for six consecutive weeks, the longest such
streak since the period ended Sept. 17, 2010.  In cash market trading, ethanol was unchanged in the U.S.
Gulf at $2.325 a gallon, while on the West Coast the additive
rose 3 cents, or 1.2 percent, to $2.455, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol in  New York  climbed 2 cents, or 0.9 percent, to
$2.37 a gallon and in Chicago the biofuel increased 1.5 cents,
or 0.7 percent, to $2.285.  Corn for May delivery advanced 4 cents, or 0.6 percent, to
$6.73 a bushel in Chicago.  Distillers are losing 9 cents per gallon of ethanol based
on current prices for corn and the biofuel, assuming a bushel of
corn generates 2.75 gallons of ethanol, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
