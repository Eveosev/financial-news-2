State and local  government spending 
is failing to keep pace with the growth in enrollment at public
colleges and universities after the recession, according to the
latest State Higher Education Finance  report .  Government support increased less than 1 percent to $87.5
billion in 2011 from the previous year, while full-time-
equivalent enrollment rose 2.4 percent to 11.8 million students,
according to the study released today. As a result, spending per
student, when adjusted for inflation, fell to $6,290 from $6,532
in 2010. That’s the lowest in the 25 years that the data has
been tracked.  Tuition fee increases to offset slow-growing government
funding may be hurting the quality of higher education at public
institutions as well as making it out of reach for some people,
according to Paul Lingenfelter, president of the  State Higher
Education Executive Officers , the Boulder, Colorado-based group
that produced the report.  “Many institutions have stretched to accommodate
enrollment demand, but we are beginning to see evidence that
students who have the desire and ability to benefit from higher
education are not enrolling due to tuition costs, inadequate
financial aid, or enrollment caps,” Lingenfelter said in a
press release.  To contact the reporter on this story:
