Korea Resources Corp. (RESCOZ) , a state-run
minerals explorer, is studying setting up a resource fund and
will sell bonds to help finance its 600 billion won ($534
million) of planned spending on overseas mines this year.  The state developer may use government funding of 220
billion, Kim Shin Jong, Chief Executive Officer of the Seoul-
based company, told reporters in Seoul today.  South Korea , the fourth-biggest economy in Asia that relies
on imports for almost all its mineral needs, is competing with
countries including China and  Japan  for natural resources.  Korea 
plans to produce 43 percent of its demand for six strategic
minerals including uranium, coal and iron ore from overseas
mines by 2020, compared with 12 percent last year, the
government said Feb. 16.  “It is very important for an economy like Korea, which
relies heavily on exports, to have stable supplies of raw
materials with competitive prices,” Kim said. “To do so, we
need to be able to secure at least half our demand from our own
mines, eventually,” said Kim.  Korea Resources spent about 780 billion won on overseas
mines last year, exceeding its original plan of 450 billion won,
as the company acquired a Canadian explorer, Kim said. The
Korean company and  Capstone Mining Corp. (CS)  last year purchased
Vancouver-based Far West Mining Ltd. for $700 million.  This year, the company is prioritizing coal and is looking
at the Americas and Indonesia for possible investments, Kim
said, declining to identify specific projects.  To contact the reporter on this story:
