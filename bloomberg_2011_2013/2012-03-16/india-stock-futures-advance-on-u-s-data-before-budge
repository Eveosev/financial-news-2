Indian stocks wrapped four weeks of
losses yesterday as Finance Minister  Pranab Mukherjee ’s federal
budget didn’t offer specific measures to cut subsidies and spur
growth.  Oil & Natural Gas Corp. (ONGC) , the biggest energy explorer, sank
the most in 10 months after the budget proposed an 80 percent
jump in levies payable on local crude output.  Bharat Heavy
Electricals Ltd. (BHEL) , the largest power-equipment maker, dropped for
a second day. Drugmaker  Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (SUNP) 
plunged the most since June 2009.  The BSE India Sensitive Index, or Sensex, lost 1.2 percent
to 17,466.20 at the close in Mumbai yesterday. The four-week
decline in the gauge is the longest since November. The
government proposed a cap on fuel and fertilizer subsidies and
increased service and excise taxes to curb the widest deficit
among major emerging economies. Still, a gap in finances of 5.9
percent of GDP in the year through March, more than the 4.6
percent target set a year ago, outweighed cuts in personal taxes
and share levies.  “There is nothing that particularly excites me; there is
nothing that particularly disappoints me either,”  Jim O’Neill ,
chairman of Goldman Sachs Asset Management, said in a Bloomberg
UTV interview. “There is nothing in this budget that’s going to
make people believe that  India  is now on a more credible long-
term fiscal path. Some of the concerns and risks that many
people would have had before the budget, stay in place.”  India’s economy has slowed for four quarters, reducing  tax
revenue  even as subsidies and welfare programs spur spending.
The central bank yesterday called for better deficit control to
improve scope for interest-rate cuts. Borrowing costs at the
highest level since 2008 to fight price rises, policy gridlock
and the worst investment slump in almost three years caused the
economy to grow last quarter at the weakest pace since 2009.  ‘Very Challenging’  Mukherjee proposed subsidies be restricted to less than 2
percent of GDP in the year from April 1, and raised the service
tax rate and the excise duty to 12 percent from 10 percent. He
cut the so-called securities transaction tax on delivery-based
share trades by 20 percent to 0.1 percent.  “The intent to keep subsidy allocation within 2 percent of
GDP is a positive while the lack of a more definite program of
curtailing expenditure entitlements would continue to keep
achievement targets very challenging,” said Navneet Munot, who
manages $8.4 billion as the chief investment officer at SBI
Funds Management in Mumbai. “Rising crude oil prices and their
potential impact on subsidies may be a threat to the fiscal
assumptions.”  The Sensex has risen 13 percent this year as foreign funds
poured a net $8.5 billion into local stocks on optimism slowing
inflation will prompt the central bank to ease monetary policy.
The nation’s GDP may climb as much as 7.85 percent in the year
through March 2013 from 6.9 percent this year, while inflation
will ease in coming months, Mukherjee said.  ‘Promising Outlook’  “There are some big picture positives but one does worry
occasionally that Indian economic policy is not anchored enough
and could pose problems down the road,” Goldman’s O’Neill said.
“With that caveat, the outlook for Indian markets currently
looks quite promising still.”  The S&P CNX Nifty Index on the National Stock Exchange of
India lost 1.2 percent to 5,317.90 yesterday. The India VIX,
which measures the cost of protection against declines in the
Nifty, sank 9 percent to 23.13, the lowest since Feb. 15. The
 BSE 200 Index (BSE200)  declined 1.3 percent to 2,163.11.  Oil & Natural Gas sank 4.7 percent to 273.05 rupees, paring
this year’s gain to 6.4 percent. The proposed levy will reduce
the company’s revenue by 50 billion rupees annually, former
chairman  R.S. Sharma  said by phone from  New Delhi .  Oil India
Ltd. (OINL) , the second-biggest state-owned explorer, fell 4.5 percent
to 1,212.05 rupees.  Reliance Industries Ltd. (RIL) , owner of the world’s largest
refining complex and the nation’s most valuable company, lost
3.1 percent to 772.35 rupees. Bharat Heavy declined 3.5 percent
to 273.6 rupees.  Larsen & Toubro Ltd. (LT) , the largest engineering
company, shed 3.1 percent to 1,320 rupees.  Alternate Tax  Sun Pharmaceutical slumped 6.9 percent to 545.75 rupees,
ending a five-day 4.9 percent rally, after Mukherjee proposed
that entities claiming profit-linked deductions will be subject
to alternate minimum tax. Cadila Healthcare Ltd. plunged 5.3
percent to 714.85 rupees.  ITC Ltd. (ITC) , the largest cigarette maker, rose 3.5 percent to
a record 216.15 rupees after the finance minister raised excise
tax on fewer types of cigarettes than forecast.  Mahindra &
Mahindra Ltd. (MM) , the largest maker of sport-utility vehicles and
tractors, rallied 3.1 percent to 677.95 rupees after Mukherjee
refrained from raising taxes on diesel vehicles.  Overseas  investors  bought a net 1.83 billion rupees ($36.4
million) of equities yesterday, raising total investments in
equities this year to 427.3 billion rupees, according to the
market regulator.  The  Bank of New York Mellon India index  of American
depositary receipts fell 0.9 percent to 1,117.59 at the close
yesterday in  New York . The measure of ADRs of Indian companies
has retreated for three straight days, cuttings its gain this
year to 27 percent.  Telephone company  Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Ltd. (MTE)  fell 9.8
percent to $1.11 in U.S. trading yesterday.  Tata Communications
Ltd. (TCL) , which provides phone service, lost 4.9 percent to $8.60 in
New York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
