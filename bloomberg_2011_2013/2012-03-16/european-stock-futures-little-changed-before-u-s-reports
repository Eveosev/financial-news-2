European (SXXP)  stocks gained for a fourth
day, extending their highest level since July, as insurance
companies rallied, outweighing a report that showed  consumer
confidence  in the U.S. unexpectedly declined.  Subsea 7 SA jumped 5.3 percent after declaring a special
dividend and saying it will buy back shares.  Tullow Oil Plc (TLW) 
advanced 3.9 percent after saying it found oil off the coast of
 Ghana .  Allianz SE (ALV)  contributed the most to a rally by a gauge of
insurance companies as yields on U.S. Treasuries climbed.  The  Stoxx Europe 600 Index (SXXP)  rose 0.5 percent to 272.4 at the
close. The benchmark measure climbed to its highest level since
July 8. The gauge has gained 2.6 percent this week and  11
percent this year  amid optimism that the euro area will contain
its debt crisis and as U.S. economic reports topped estimates.  “There is still more room to run,” Patrick Moonen, senior
strategist at ING Investment Management in  The Hague , said in a
Bloomberg Television interview. “Many investors are still
rather cautiously positioned and they are still in the beginning
of shifting their positions from out of defensive sectors, out
of defensive asset classes towards equities.”  The Stoxx 600 is trading at  11.3 times the estimated
profits  of its members, according to data compiled by Bloomberg,
compared with 9.1 times in September. The jump in the ratio is
the steepest for any six-month period since October 2009, the
data show.  European (SXXP)  stocks rose 0.3 percent yesterday as jobless
claims and manufacturing reports added to optimism that the U.S.
economic recovery is gaining momentum.  VStoxx Index Slides  The  VStoxx Index (V2X) , which measures the cost of option prices
on the Euro Stoxx 50 Index, slid 4.3 percent to 18.52 today, its
lowest level since April 2011. The European volatility gauge has
 plunged 65 percent  since its almost 32-month high on Sept. 12
and is 30 percent below its historical average before today of
26.38, according to data compiled by Bloomberg going back to
January 1999.  The volume of shares changing hands on the Euro Stoxx 50
Index was 71 percent greater than the average over the past 30
days, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  National benchmark indexes rose in 16 of the 18 western-
European markets.  Germany ’s DAX Index gained 0.2 percent. The
U.K.’s FTSE 100 Index and  France ’s CAC 40 Index rose 0.4
percent.  U.S. Consumer Confidence  In the U.S., the Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan
preliminary index of  consumer confidence  fell to 74.3 in March
from 75.3 in February. That missed the average of  70 economist
estimates  for a reading of 76.  A gauge of industrial production in the world’s largest
economy was unchanged in February, according to a report from
the  Federal Reserve . Economists had forecast that the gauge
would rebound 0.4 percent from January.  Subsea 7 rallied 5.3 percent to 143 kroner. The oilfield-
services provider formerly known as Acergy SA proposed a share
buyback of as much as $200 million and a special dividend of 60
cents. Subsea 7 also posted fourth-quarter sales of $1.42
billion. That beat  analysts’ estimates  for revenue of $1.38
billion.  Tullow Oil advanced 3.9 percent to 1,528 pence. The  oil
company  said the Enyenra-4A appraisal well in the Deepwater Tano
license off the coast of Ghana encountered oil in “very good
quality” sandstone reservoirs.  Allianz, Swiss Life  Allianz,  Europe’s biggest insurer  by market capitalization,
rose 1.6 percent to 94 euros.  Swiss Life Holding AG (SLHN) ,
 Switzerland ’s largest life insurer, added 3.1 percent to 114.90
Swiss francs.  AXA SA (CS) ,  Europe ’s second-largest insurer by market
value, increased 1.9 percent to 13.18 euros.  Prudential Plc (PRU) , the
U.K.’s biggest insurer, added 1.5 percent to 791.5 pence.  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc  rose 6.3 percent to 28.14
pence after the stock was raised to buy from neutral at UBS AG.  Vestas Wind Systems A/S (VWS) , the world’s biggest wind-turbine
producer, jumped 4.7 percent to 63.95 kroner, its fourth day of
gains. China’s wind-turbine industry will consolidate because of
a supply glut and declining prices that have cut profitability,
according the country’s biggest producer Sinovel Wind Energy
Group Co.  Porsche SE and Daimler AG sank 3.6 percent to 47.55 euros
and 2.5 percent to 47.23 euros, respectively, after the shares
were downgraded at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. Porsche was cut to
underperform from market perform and Daimler,  the world’s third-
biggest luxury-car maker , was downgraded to market perform from
outperform.  To contact the reporter on this story:
