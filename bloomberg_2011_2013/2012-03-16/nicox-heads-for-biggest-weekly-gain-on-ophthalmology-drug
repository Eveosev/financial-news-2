NicOx SA (COX)  headed for the biggest
weekly gain ever in Paris trading on optimism the drug developer
will succeed in building an ophthalmology business after
positive mid-stage trial results on a glaucoma treatment
licensed to Bausch & Lomb Inc.  NicOX jumped 11 percent to 3.07 euros at 1:53 p.m. in
Paris, bringing its increase for the week to 73 percent. That
would be the biggest advance ever for the company, which first
sold shares to the public in November 1999.  NicOx, based in Sophia Antipolis,  France , and Bausch & Lomb
said in a March 13  statement  the experimental drug helped reduce
the fluid pressure inside the eye in patients with open-angle
glaucoma or ocular hypertension. Bausch & Lomb will pay NicOx
$10 million for meeting the target and begin advanced tests on
the compound, known as BOL-303259-X, they said. Pfizer Inc. had
previously dropped its development. NicOx shares surged 45
percent March 13.  “NicOx continues rising on the back of the good news from
earlier this week,” Sebastien Malafosse, an analyst at Paris-
based Bryan, Garnier & Co. who has a “buy” recommendation on
the stock, said in a phone interview today. “The company once
again has a compound in phase 3. This validates the strategy of
Chief Executive Officer Michele Garufi.”  The 58-year-old CEO, who co-founded NicOx in 1996, told
analysts during a Feb. 29 conference call he wants to create an
“international specialist pharmaceutical company focused on the
development of late-stage products and their
commercialization.”  Seeking Acquisitions  NicOx is looking for acquisitions or partnerships to help
fill its pipeline, Garufi said that day. The company is “in
mass discussion with a number of acquisition and in-licensing
targets,” he said.  Garufi declined to comment on NicOx’s share-price
performance in an e-mail today. Even with this week’s gain, the
stock is at a fraction of its previous levels. NicOx has plunged
in each of the past five years after setbacks in  drug
development .  Two of the four doses of BOL-303259-X tested reduced eye-
fluid pressure more than Pfizer’s Xalatan, NicOx and Bausch &
Lomb said. NicOx sold rights to the drug to Rochester,  New York- 
based Bausch & Lomb in March 2010. It had repurchased them from
Pfizer in 2009 after the U.S. company decided not to pursue the
compound’s development.  NicOx is likely to use its cash for acquisitions or
partnerships, according to Malafosse. NicOx had 93.1 million
euros ($122 million) in cash and cash equivalents at the end of
last year.  “This gives an idea of the firepower they could have for
deals,” Malafosse said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
