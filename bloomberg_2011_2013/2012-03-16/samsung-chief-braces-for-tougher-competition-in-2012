Samsung Electronics Co. (005930) , the
world’s largest maker of televisions and memory chips, is
bracing for tougher competition amid low industry-wide growth as
it seeks to cement leadership in its main businesses.  “The electronics industry will enter a low-growth
period,” Samsung Chief Executive Officer Choi Gee Sung said
during the company’s annual shareholders’ meeting in  Seoul 
today. “Reorganization of the industry will gain speed and
competition among global players will intensify.”  The electronics maker posted  record revenue  last year,
helped by the popularity of its Galaxy smartphones. In 2012,
Suwon, South Korea-based Samsung will continue to enhance its
competitiveness in hardware, while strengthening new businesses
including medical equipment, Choi said.  Samsung plans capital expenditure of 25 trillion won ($22.2
billion) this year, including 15 trillion won in the chip
business and 6.6 trillion won in the panel business, as it seeks
to widen its lead over rivals.  Shareholders today approved the company’s plan to spin off
its liquid-crystal-display division on April 1. Choi said
Samsung is reviewing merging the business with the Samsung
Mobile Display venture that makes organic light-emitting diodes,
or OLED, screens. Samsung’s LCD business had an  operating loss 
of 750 billion won last year as global TV sales slowed.  Samsung  shares  rose 0.6 percent to 1,257,000 won at 11:45
a.m. in Seoul. The stock has advanced 19 percent this year
compared with the 12 percent gain in the benchmark Kospi index.  Samsung, locked in legal disputes with  Apple Inc. (AAPL) , will be
more aggressive in securing patents, Choi said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
