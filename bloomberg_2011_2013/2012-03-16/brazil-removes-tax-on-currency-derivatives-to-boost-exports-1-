Brazil ’s President  Dilma Rousseff 
removed a tax on currency derivatives for exporters as the
country struggles to remain competitive in the face of a
strengthening real.  The so-called IOF tax for exporters will be eliminated on
condition that their exposure to currency derivatives, used to
hedge against exchange-rate fluctuations, does not exceed 1.2
times the value of their previous year’s exports, according to a
decree published today in the official gazette.  Rousseff last week pledged to take all necessary measures
to shield Latin America’s biggest economy from what she called a
“monetary tsunami” unleashed by rich nations seeking to
devalue their currencies.  On March 12, she extended a 6 percent tax on foreign loans
and bonds issued abroad to include lending with a duration as
long as five years, from three years previously.  The real strengthened 8.7 percent in the first two months
of the year against the  U.S. dollar , the most among the 16 most-
traded currencies tracked by Bloomberg. Since the start of this
month, when Brazil boosted efforts to contain the rally, it has
fallen 4.7 percent.  A stronger currency hurts exporters by making goods more
expensive in dollar terms and spurs demand for imports.  To contact the reporterS on this story:
