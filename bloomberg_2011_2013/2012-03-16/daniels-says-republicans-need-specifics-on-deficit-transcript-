Republican Governor Mitch Daniels
of Indiana said in an interview on Bloomberg Television’s
“Political Capital with  Al Hunt ,” airing this weekend, that
his party’s presidential candidates must get specific on how
they would reduce the federal  budget deficit , suggesting that
has to include tax increases.  (This is not a legal transcript. Bloomberg LP cannot
guarantee its accuracy.)  AL HUNT: We begin the show with Indiana Governor Mitch
Daniels, who joins us from Indianapolis.  Governor, you have consistently dismissed the notion of a
brokered convention, saying you’ll get a nominee. But recently,
Senator  Jim DeMint , one of the most influential conservatives in
the party, said you’re the one person who could emerge as a
compromise candidate, but, quote, “I don’t think his wife will
let it happen,” end quote.  Your reaction to both of those assertions?  MITCH DANIELS : I really appreciate the kind words from
Senator DeMint. I really do. But, no, I continue to think that
we’ll have a nominee by that time and be about the business of,
I hope, putting a really positive and specific program before
the country and for the fall.  HUNT: Governor, you said you’ll get a nominee by then.
“Then,” of course, is Tampa. It’s now in  Illinois . It goes
back and forth.  Mitt Romney  clearly has the advantage so far.
But when do you think you’ll get a nominee, within the next
month, we’ll go all the way to the June primaries, or all the
way to the convention?  DANIELS: Al, I really don’t know and not the best person to
ask. I’m not studying all these charts and calendars. I will
tell you this. I’m sort of rooting for it not to happen before
early May, because we would love to have a real competitive
primary in  Indiana . On the Republican side, it’d be the first
time since 1976. We had a great one on the Democratic side in
’08. That was the first one in about 40 years. And I would love
to see that happen again.  HUNT: And who would be favored - who would be favored on
the Republican side in Indiana today?  DANIELS: That’s a good question. I would just wild guess
that Governor Romney would, but that each of the current
candidates would arrive with some chance to be competitive.  HUNT: When you look at the two candidates who seem to be
the leading candidates, Governor Romney and Senator Santorum,
what do you see as the chief differences?  DANIELS: I think there’s some difference of emphasis. And,
you know,  Governor Romney , when he can, likes to talk about what
I think are the biggest issues, the economic issues facing the
country. And as a matter of emphasis, sometimes I guess Senator
Santorum devotes more of his time to other questions.  But I think they’re more similar in views and outlook than
they let on or the dynamics of their running against each other
allows them to show. I don’t think that the differences are
nearly so wide as is sometimes perceived.  HUNT: Well, let’s talk about the issue that is central to
what Mitch Daniels has been talking about for many, many years,
namely the deficit. And you are a genuine deficit hawk. You
actually want a reunion tour, you said, for Bowles-Simpson. And
you have skewered  Barack Obama  for what you think is his fiscal
recklessness on debt. You’ve really established that record
very, very - in a very committed way.  But your leading candidates, according to the Committee for
a Responsible Budget, are also fiscally reckless. They say Mitt
Romney’s proposals would increase the federal deficit by $250
billion through 2021, Santorum by trillions. Isn’t it time for
Republicans, Republican presidential candidates, as well as the
president, to propose some sacrifices, even some pain, as well
as the fun of tax cuts?  DANIELS: It is time for candidates to, I believe, propose
specific remedies or steps to address this very, I think,
survival-level issue that we’re facing, Al. The president, I’m
sorry to say, has gone completely AWOL on this issue. I guess
we’re not going to hear anything from him. He had his chance
when Bowles-Simpson came out, and he didn’t take it. He had his
chance with -  HUNT: He walked away from it. He did. But have you told
your candidates you’d like to see them step up to that and - and
be specific?  DANIELS: I believe I have, and I’ll continue trying. When I
- when I was asked to speak for our party after the State of the
Union, I tried to address these questions very frontally. I
wrote a book about it, about this general subject for that
matter.  No, I mean, there’s plenty of time - I will say that I
believe our candidates have spoken more forthrightly, certainly,
than the president, but not nearly to the extent that the moment
requires.  I mean, this really ought to be a subject that engages us
all. It threatens the essence of the American promise, upward
mobility. It’s a very serious threat to young people and low-
income people in this country.  And it’s a great opportunity for our party, I think, to
speak more openly and inclusively and also to have the
confidence in the American people that they can handle the
facts. And they pretty much sense we’re in a serious fix, and I
think they’re waiting for somebody to say so and say, look, here
are some things we can do.  Let me just say, Al, I don’t think we have to talk about
pain and sacrifice, particularly. The pain and sacrifice is
going to come through inaction, not the, I think, reasonably
moderate steps would could start taking now.  HUNT: But don’t they have to be taken both with the big
entitlements and with - with higher revenues?  DANIELS: Yes, exactly. But the - there are - we can have
all kinds of differences, honest differences, about the best way
forward, but there must be two constants. There is no way to
preserve the American dream and save us from an unaffordable
future that does not include modernizing the entitlements, not
people in them today, but starting a few years out, and that
does not include, really, an economy that grows and produces
greater revenues.  And so I constantly point out that everyone, starting with
the most affluent, must participate in this. There are smart and
dumb ways to do that. My strong encouragement is for closing tax
loopholes and stop sending benefits that really should be
concentrated and preserved for the most vulnerable among us.  HUNT: Your mentor in this business is Senator  Richard
Lugar , who suffered a blow of sorts this week when - when they
ruled that he couldn’t vote in Indiana. He can run, but couldn’t
vote. The party’s right-wing says look for an upset in that May
primary. What are the odds now that Dick Lugar will come back to
 Washington  for a seventh term?  DANIELS: I think he will. And I think he should. The law is
very settled out here. He’s fully legit as a candidate and as a
voter. Yesterday, a party-line vote - a little partisan
mischief, maybe -  HUNT: But you think he’ll win.  DANIELS: - by local Democrats. I do believe he’ll win. And,
you know, he’s still a great asset to this state and to the
country. And his opponent’s a worthy guy, a friend and ally of
mine, but I’ve broken heretofore a firm policy, Al, made this -
one exception I’ve made by saying that the senator who’s meant
so much to me - and, frankly, to me personally for a long time -
is who I’m for in this primary.  HUNT: OK, Mitch Daniels, good luck to your Indiana Hoosiers
in March Madness. And as always, it’s great to have you on.  DANIELS: Al, thanks a lot.  ***END OF TRANSCRIPT***  THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN
