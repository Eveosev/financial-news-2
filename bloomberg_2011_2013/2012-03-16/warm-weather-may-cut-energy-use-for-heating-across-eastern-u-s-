Warm weather may cut the amount of
energy normally needed for heating at this time of year by 60 to
80 percent across the eastern U.S. early next week, said  David Salmon  of Weather Derivatives.  Temperatures from the upper Great Plains to the East Coast,
including  New York  City and Chicago, are expected to be 10 to 30
degrees Fahrenheit (5.6 to 16.7 Celsius) above normal from March
17 to March 23, Salmon said.  The West Coast to the Rocky Mountains may be at least 2
degrees cooler than normal, said Salmon, in Belton,  Missouri .  Traders watch temperature predictions to gauge energy use
and demand. Warm weather will drive up electricity use as people
turn on air conditioners. About 51 percent of U.S. households
use natural gas for heating, according to the Energy Department.  Temperatures in the Midwest will probably drop somewhat as
a storm front moves through the central U.S. during the period,
said  Matt Rogers , president of Commodity Weather Group LLC in
Bethesda, Maryland.  “The models are struggling in handling the future of an
upper-level low feature that promises to drench Texas early next
week,” Rogers said in a note to clients.  That system may spark thunderstorms across the Great Plains
and into Texas, according to the  Storm Prediction Center  in
Norman, Oklahoma.  The normal average temperature in New York on March 21 is
about 44 degrees, according to MDA. It’s 40 in Boston and
Chicago, 48 in  St. Louis , 56 in Atlanta, 59 in Dallas, 64 in
Houston, 48 in Seattle, and 59 in Burbank, California.  To contact the reporter on this story:
