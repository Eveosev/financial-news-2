Hungary and the  International
Monetary Fund  are in agreement that future negotiations on aid
should focus on economic and financial issues and not political
matters, state news agency  MTI  reported today, citing Tamas Fellegi, the country’s chief bailout negotiator.  “We have definitely agreed that coordination talks concern
an economic-financial package and the preparations for this,”
Fellegi said after holding unofficial negotiations with IMF
representatives, MTI reported. “It isn’t in the IMF’s interest,
either, to propose conditions of a political nature which would
hinder the start” of talks, he was quoted as saying.  Hungary has made the necessary compromises in connection
with European Union infringement procedures as the country “is
not playing for time” and is dedicated to starting the
negotiations, Fellegi said, according to MTI.  To contact the reporter on this story:
