U.S. Representative  Ron Paul  of
Texas reported raising $3.3 million for his presidential
campaign in February, trailing at least two of his rivals for
the party’s nomination during the month.  Paul, who has yet to win a primary or caucus in 2012, has
been the second-most prolific fundraiser overall among the
Republican candidates, behind only former Massachusetts Governor
Mitt Romney. Paul has now raised $34.4 million for his campaign.  He spent $3.5 million in February and ended the month with
$1.4 million in cash on hand, his campaign said in a filing
today with the Federal Election Commission in advance of the
March 20 deadline.  Romney’s campaign said it had raised $11.5 million and
former U.S. Senator  Rick Santorum ’s campaign said it had brought
in $9 million. Former U.S. House Speaker  Newt Gingrich  hasn’t
said how much he raised in February.  Paul again relied on smaller donations, as more than half
of his funds came in amounts of $200 or less.  To contact the reporters on this story:
