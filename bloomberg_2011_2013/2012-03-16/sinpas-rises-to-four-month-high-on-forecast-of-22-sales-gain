Sinpas Gayrimenkul Yatirim
Ortakligi AS (SNGYO) , a Turkish real estate developer, rose to the
highest in almost five months after the deputy chief executive
said sales would rise 22 percent this year.  Sinpas gained 3.1 percent to 1.33 liras, its highest since
Oct. 28, bringing the stock’s advance this year to 34 percent.  Sinpas will increase sales to 850 million liras ($473
million) this year, more than the estimated increase in the
Turkish real estate market of between 5 percent and 7 percent,
deputy CEO Ozkan Ozturk said at a news conference in Istanbul
today. That sales forecast compares with a 649.5 million-lira
mean estimate of 14 analysts in a Bloomberg survey.  Sinpas’ net income in 2011 will climb to 169 million liras
from 61 million liras a year earlier, according to the average
of 15 analyst estimates.  Some smaller players in Turkish real estate may have to
“pull out of a very competitive market” this year, Ozkan said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
