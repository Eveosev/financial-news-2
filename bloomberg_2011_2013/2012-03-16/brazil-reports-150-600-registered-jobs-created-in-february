Brazil â€™s economy created 150,600
government-registered jobs in February, the Labor Ministry said.  The gain compares with a median forecast of 190,000 formal
jobs, according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of
5 economists.  Government-registered job creation number is a balance of
posts created minus job eliminated. Registered jobs, so-called
formal work, assure employees a range of benefits such as
 unemployment insurance , bonuses and retirement payments by the
government.  To contact the reporter on this story:
