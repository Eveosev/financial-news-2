Nigerian M2 money supply growth
slowed to 13.4 percent in February from 18.5 percent the
previous month, the central bank said.  Private sector credit growth slowed to 39.1 percent from
41.7 percent in January, the Abuja-based bank said on its
website today. That compares with contractions of 6.5 percent in
January 2011 and 8.7 percent in February that year, according to
the central bank.  Private sector credit growth “has surged to new highs” in
the first quarter after the state Asset Management Corp. of
 Nigeria  started acquiring bad debt from Nigerian lenders,  Samir Gadio , an emerging-markets strategist at Standard Bank Group
Ltd. in  London , said today in an e-mailed response to questions.  Amcon was established in November 2010 by the West African
nation following a lending crisis in 2008 and 2009 that
threatened the banking system.  “The limited actual access to credit in the overall
economy is primarily a structural issue rather than a function
of monetary policy (even though lending rates have also
increased sizably since late 2011),” Gadio said.  The  Central Bank of Nigeria  has increased its benchmark
 interest rate  by 6 percentage points to 12 percent since
September 2010 as it seeks to bring inflation below 10 percent.
Inflation accelerated to 12.6 percent in January from 10.3
percent the previous month after the government partially
removed gasoline subsidies, boosting the price of refined fuel
by almost half.  To contact the reporters on this story:
