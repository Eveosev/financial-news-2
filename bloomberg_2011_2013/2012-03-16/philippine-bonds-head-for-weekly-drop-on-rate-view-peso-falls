Philippine bonds had a weekly
decline after the central bank signaled it will refrain from
adding to this year’s two interest-rate cuts. The peso recorded
its biggest weekly loss since November.  Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas Governor Amando Tetangco said
March 10 that “pausing gives us time to digest and monitor the
impact of past policy actions and to consider other relevant
data.” The price of crude oil has risen 6.8 this year in  New
York . The central bank raised the ceiling on some importation
that need not be supported by documents to $500,000 from a
previous cap of $50,000, it said in an e-mailed statement today.  “There is some selling pressure on bonds because of
concern about inflation,” said Antonio Espedido, treasurer at
China Banking Corp. in Manila. “Oil, plus the economic recovery
in the U.S. may bring back global inflation.”  The yield on the 5 percent peso bonds due August rose 15
basis points, or 0.15 percentage point, this week to 4.85
percent as of 4:04 p.m. in Manila, according to prices from
Tradition Financial Services. The rate increased seven basis
points today.  The peso fell 1.1 percent this week to 43.068 per dollar,
according to Tullett Prebon Plc. It declined 0.2 percent today.
One-month implied volatility, a measure of exchange-rate swings
used to price options, was steady at 6.50 percent for the day
and the week.  Policy makers reduced the overnight borrowing rate by a
quarter of a percentage point at each of the last two reviews,
lowering it to 4 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
