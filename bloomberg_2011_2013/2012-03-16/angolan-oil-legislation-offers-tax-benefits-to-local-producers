Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos
Santos signed a law offering tax breaks to local  oil companies .  The companies will pay 30 percent to 33 percent of
earnings, compared with 65.75 percent, the presidency said late
yesterday in an e-mailed statement. Local producers are also
exempted from paying so-called contract bonuses to the 
government, it said.  The legislation will come into force after being published
in the government’s official gazette. Angola is sub-Saharan
 Africa ’s biggest oil producer after Nigeria.  To contact the reporter on this story:
