(Corrects to say total production in second paragraph.)  Iraq’s oil output could rise to 3.4
million barrels a day, with 2.6 million barrels for export by
year-end, Oil Minister Abdul Kareem al-Luaibi said in Paris.  Output from Kirkuk could rise to 300,000 barrels a day in
two to three years, and the country’s total production could
reach 10 million barrels a day by 2017, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
