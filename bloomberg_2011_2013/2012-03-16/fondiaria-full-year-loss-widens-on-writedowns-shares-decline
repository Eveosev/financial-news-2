Fondiaria-Sai SpA (FSA) ,  Italy ’s second-
biggest insurer, said its full-year loss widened after writing
down goodwill and its holdings in other companies.  The  net loss  increased to 852.7 million euros ($1 billion)
from a deficit of 717.6 million euros a year earlier, the Turin-
based insurer said in a statement today. The company confirmed
that it will raise 1.1 billion euros through a share sale, which
should be approved March 19.  The shares fell as much as 4 percent. The company wrote
down the value of so-called non-strategic assets by 373 million
euros. It also wrote down 284 million euros of real estate and
101 million euros of goodwill. Fondiaria, which gets most of its
revenue from property and casualty businesses, is planning to
sell new shares and merge with competitor  Unipol Gruppo
Finanziario SpA (UNI)  to become profitable again.  The company’s combined ratio, or claims and expenses as a
proportion of premiums, rose to 112.1 percent in 2011 from 109.4
percent a year earlier. A figure above 100 percent means an
insurer’s claims and costs exceed premium income, giving it a
loss from underwriting.  Shares of Fondiaria were down 2 percent at 1.25 euros as of
11:35 a.m. in Milan, giving the company a market value of 535
million euros.  Unipol agreed last month to buy new shares in  Premafin
Finanziaria SpA (PF) , the holding company of Fondiaria, to
participate in the stock sale announced by Fondiaria on Jan. 30.
After the recapitalization, Unipol, Premafin, Fondiaria and its
unit  Milano Assicurazioni SpA (MI)  will merge, becoming Italy’s
second-biggest insurer after Assicurazioni Generali SpA.  To contact the reporters on this story:
