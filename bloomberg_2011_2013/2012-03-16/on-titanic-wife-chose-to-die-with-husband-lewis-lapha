In April 1912, among the first-
class passengers on the RMS Titanic were Isidor Straus, co-owner
of Macy’s department store, and his wife, Ida, returning from a
trip to  Germany .  (To listen to the podcast, click  here .)  Fellow Titanic passenger Lady Duff Gordon said the two
adored each other and told her that in their long years of
wedded life -- they married in 1871 -- they’d “never been
separated for one day or night.”  When the ship began sinking, the elderly pair was offered a
place in a lifeboat, but Straus refused, saying he did not wish
to be singled out for special favors while women and children
waited.  Ida Straus had stepped into the boat, but climbed out
again, saying, “Where you go, I go.” The two calmly sat on
deck chairs until a wave washed over them.  I spoke with Richard Davenport-Hines, author of “Voyagers
of the Titanic,” on the following topics:  1. Shipboard Microcosm  2. Layer Cake Structure  3. Women First  4. World Stage  5. Thousands in Water  To buy this book in  North America , click  here .  ( Lewis Lapham  is the founder of  Lapham’s Quarterly  and the
