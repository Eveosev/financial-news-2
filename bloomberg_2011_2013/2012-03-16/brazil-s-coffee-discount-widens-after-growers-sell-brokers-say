Buyers of good cup coffee from
 Brazil , the world’s largest producer of the commodity, are
getting a bigger discount for the beans as producers sold after
international prices tumbled, local brokers said.  Good cup quality beans for shipment from April to June are
at a discount of 10 cents a pound to the price on the ICE
Futures U.S. exchange in  New York , Flavour Coffee, a Rio de
Janeiro-based broker, said in a report e-mailed yesterday. That
compares with a discount of 5 cents a pound last week.  Coffee has fallen 19 percent in New York this year as
traders sold the beans in anticipation of a record crop in
Brazil. The price closed below $2 a pound for the first time
since 2010 on March 6. Brazil’s National Coffee Council on March
9 urged growers not to panic because of the price falls.  “After general panic, producers are now selling more
frequently, but not many big sales in general,” Thiago Cazarini, a broker at Varginha, Brazil-based Cazarini Trading
Co. wrote in a report e-mailed yesterday. “Some reasonable
offers can be found for current and new crop,” he said, adding
that these were “not enough to attract various buyers to the
market.”  Coffee output in Brazil will likely rise to a record in the
2012-13 season starting in July as trees enter the higher-
yielding half of a two-year cycle, the government estimates.
Production will be 49 million to 52.3 million bags, exceeding
the high of 48.5 million bags in 2002, according to a Jan. 10
report from Conab, the government’s forecasting agency.  To contact the reporter on this story:
