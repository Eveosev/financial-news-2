The steady appreciation of  China ’s
yuan has ended as the government allows bigger swings in the
currency,  Jim O’Neill , chairman of Goldman Sachs Asset
Management, said in a Bloomberg Television interview in London.  “It’s pretty clear to me that as part of becoming an
adult, the Chinese are saying our currency is going to behave
like more of the others you guys all trade,” O’Neill said.
“It’s going to be more volatile. The days of an easy, slow rise
of the renminbi are over.”  The People’s Bank of China set its daily fixing for the
yuan at the lowest level since December yesterday, after
allowing the currency to gain 31 percent since 2005. Premier  Wen Jiabao  said March 14 that the yuan may be near “equilibrium”
and policy makers will allow greater exchange-rate volatility.  The yuan has lost 0.5 percent against the dollar this year
to 6.329, after gaining an average 4.3 percent annually over the
past six years.  O’Neill coined the “BRIC” term in 2001 to describe
Brazil, Russia,  India  and China, the four nations that he
estimates will collectively equal the U.S. in economic size by
2020.  Economic data in the U.S. has improved, with the housing
market looking “like it is bottoming out,” O’Neill said today.
“The trend of unemployment looks to be better than most people
continue to talk about.”  Global equity markets still face a “wall of worry” even
as they advance in line with his expectations, he said. The MSCI
World Index has rallied 11 percent in 2012 through yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
