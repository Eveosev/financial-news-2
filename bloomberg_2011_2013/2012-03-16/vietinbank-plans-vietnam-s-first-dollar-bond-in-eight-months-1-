Vietnam  Joint Stock Commercial Bank
for Industry and Trade, known as VietinBank, plans to meet with
bond investors from March 19 about Vietnam’s first dollar-bond
since July.  VietinBank will sell its debut U.S dollar-denominated notes
about five days after the meetings, Chairman Pham Huy Hung said
by telephone today.  Standard & Poor’s  gave the lender a B+/B
issuer credit rating with negative outlook today, reflecting the
credit rating company’s view on Vietnam’s sovereign rating.  The Hanoi-based lender plans a $500 million overseas bond
sale this year that may offer a coupon of between 5 percent and
6 percent, Hung said in an interview in September.  The last dollar-note from a Vietnamese company was the $40
million of 6 percent convertible bonds for Vincom Joint-Stock
Co., the country’s largest listed real-estate company by market
value, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The coupon will be determined based on market conditions,
 VietinBank (CTG) ’s Deputy General Director Le Duc Tho said at a
company conference in September.  HSBC Holdings Plc and Barclays Plc were appointed as
advisers and will jointly arrange the sale, Tho told Bloomberg
on Sept. 12.  To contact the reporters on this story:
