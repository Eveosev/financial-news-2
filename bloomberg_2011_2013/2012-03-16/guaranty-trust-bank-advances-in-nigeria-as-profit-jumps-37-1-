Guaranty Trust Bank Plc (GUARANTY) ,  Nigeria ’s
biggest lender by market value, rose for a second day after
full-year profit jumped 37 percent and the company announced a
final dividend.  The  shares  increased as much as 3.2 percent to 14.50 naira
before paring its gain to 14.15 naira by 12:43 p.m. in Lagos.
Net income in 2011 surged to 52.65 billion naira ($334 million)
from 38.35 billion naira a year earlier, the Lagos-based bank
said in an e-mailed statement today.  The result “is in line with our expectations,” Adesoji
Solanke, Lagos-based Africa banking analyst at  Renaissance
Capital , wrote in an initial reaction to the results today.  Guaranty will pay a final dividend of 85 kobo per share on
April 29, it said. This will increase the total dividend to 1.10
naira, with the bank having paid an interim dividend of 25 kobo
per share, it said. Revenue climbed 23 percent to 188.82 billion
naira, according to the statement.  Nigerian banks’ earnings are rising after the central bank
implemented reforms following the debt crisis in 2008 and 2009
which threatened the industry with a collapse. The regulator
fired the chief executive officers of eight of the country’s 24
lenders and asked those that failed an audit to recapitalize or
be liquidated.  To contact the reporter on this story:
