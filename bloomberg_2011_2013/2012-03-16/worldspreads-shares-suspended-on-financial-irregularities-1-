WorldSpreads Group Plc (WSPR) , a U.K.
brokerage and spread-betting company, suspended trading in its
shares after finding “possible financial irregularities” in
its accounts.  The company is investigating its financial position with
its advisers and has informed the Financial Services Authority,
it said in a statement today.  “Given the uncertainty as to the outcome, WorldSpreads is
currently unable to assess its financial position, and inform
the market accordingly, and considers the suspension to be
appropriate,” the London-based firm said.  Lindsay McNeile, WorldSpreads’s executive chairman, didn’t
immediately return a call seeking comment today.  The stock was unchanged earlier at 37 pence for a market
value of about 15 million pounds ($24 million).  WorldSpreads’s founder, chief executive officer and largest
individual shareholder, Conor Foley, resigned March 14. Roger Hynes, a former managing director at CMC Markets Plc, replaced
him as interim CEO. Niall O’Kelly resigned as chief financial
officer in February as Worldspreads said it would post a full-
year loss after an “unusual pattern of client trading.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
