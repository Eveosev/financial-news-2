Greece  remains “accident prone”
and may require further debt restructuring or additional
financing from euro countries if it struggles to implement
measures attached to a new 130 billion-euro ($171 billion)
bailout, staff at the  International Monetary Fund  said.  The loan package is based “on ambitious fiscal and
privatization targets and above all on a reinvigoration of
structural reforms,” IMF staff wrote in a report released
today.  “In the event of slower progress in policy implementation,
or failure of the economy to respond rapidly enough to reforms,
completion of reviews may require additional support from
Greece’s European partners on yet more concessional terms than
currently envisaged, and/or another restructuring of bonded
debt,” according to the report.  The IMF board yesterday approved a 28-billion-euro loan for
Greece as part of a second bailout led by euro-area governments
that requires more austerity and an overhaul of its economy.
Greece completed the world’s largest sovereign-debt
restructuring and had to agree to deeper spending cuts to obtain
the new funds as it faces a fifth year of recession.  The IMF report said the new program was “subject to
exceptional risks,” including political ability to implement
the measures.  The Greek government must continue to meet the conditions
set by its international creditors to receive aid payments at
three-monthly intervals.  “Consistent with its mandate, the IMF is primarily
intended to play a catalytic role for both the official and
private sector contributions and thus provide a temporary bridge
to market access while Greece implements the reforms necessary
to eventually correct its imbalances,” staff wrote.  The IMF staff said economic and political failures in the
bailout program “would most likely require additional debt
relief by the official sector and, short of that, lead to a
sovereign default.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
