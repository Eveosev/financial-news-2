The  Chicago Tribune  endorsed  Mitt Romney  ahead of the March 20 Illinois primary, terming him the
“best, most responsible choice” for the Republican
presidential nomination.  The newspaper, the state’s largest, praised Romney as “the
candidate most likely to steer the Republican Party toward its
traditional values: financial responsibility, economic (and thus
job) growth, social tolerance, and a limited role for government
in the lives of the governed.”  In its editorial, the Tribune offered “one large caveat”
about its choice, saying “Romney has talked too much in
generalities, and with come-and-go candor, about the radical 
restructuring that healthier spending and debt levels will require.”  Romney, the former governor of Massachusetts, is seeking to
rebound from primary losses earlier this week in Alabama and
Mississippi to former Senator  Rick Santorum  of Pennsylvania.  To contact the reporter on this story:
