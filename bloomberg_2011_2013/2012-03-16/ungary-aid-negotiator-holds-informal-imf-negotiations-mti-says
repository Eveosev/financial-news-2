Hungarian Minister Without
Portfolio Tamas Fellegi, who is in charge of aid negotiations
with the  International Monetary Fund  and the European Union,  is
holding informal talks with the Washington-based lender, state
news service  MTI  reported.  Fellegi is scheduled to meet the IMF’s mission chief for
 Hungary  today to discuss “recent developments” in Hungary,
according to MTI.  “It’s not customary to make public comments in this phase
of preparatory talks,” MTI cited Gyorgy Szapary, Hungary’s
ambassador to the U.S., as saying.  Fellegi won’t meet with the head of IMF and formal talks on
Hungary’s request for financial assistance probably won’t take
place “at the current stage,” Iryna Ivaschenko, the lender’s
representative in Hungary, said last week, MTI reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
