Russia ’s southern Krasnodar region
may harvest less grain this year following a prolonged cold
spell, according to Alexander Tkachev, regional governor.  “Despite problems with weather, we have combative mood and
can grow 10 million metric tons of grain,” Tkachev  wrote  today
on his Twitter blog. That’s less than the 11.4 million tons of
grain the region harvested last year, according to Federal State
Statistics Service data. The region’s crop accounted for more
than 12 percent of Russia’s total grain harvest in 2011.  Cold weather damaged more than 30 percent of winter crops,
mostly barley and rapeseed, in Krasnodar,  Yevgeny Gromyko ,
Tkachev’s deputy, said this week, according to Interfax.  Spring sowing is being delayed by 10 to 14 days across
Russia because of low temperatures, Shamil Vakhitov, Russia’s
deputy agriculture minister, said today, according to the
region’s website. The delay isn’t critical, said Vakhitov, who
added that 6 percent to 10 percent of country’s winter crops
will need to be resowed in the spring.  To contact the reporter on this story:
