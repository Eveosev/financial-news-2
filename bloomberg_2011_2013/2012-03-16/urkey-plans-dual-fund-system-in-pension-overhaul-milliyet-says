Turkey  is planning to create a
dual-fund system to lock in savings for a longer period and
increase the size of personal pension contributions, Milliyet
 reported , without saying how it got the information.  Deputy Prime Minister Ali Babacan may propose collecting
tax rebates for savings in a secondary personal retirement fund
that cannot be accessed for 10 years, according to the Istanbul-
based newspaper. Unlike the primary account where individuals
make their deposits, the extra fund won’t be subject to  tax
deductions , Milliyet said.  The government may also increase the contribution limit for
tax breaks from 10 percent of a person’s annual income,
according to the newspaper. The pensions industry has been
pressing Turkey to double the threshold since the system was set
up in 2003, Milliyet said.  With the new incentives, pension funds may grow to as much
as 200 billion liras ($111 billion) by 2023 from more than 15
billion liras currently, Meral Eredenk, chief executive officer
of AvivaSA Emeklilik & Hayat AS, told the newspaper. AvivaSA is
a partnership of London-based  Aviva Plc (AV/)  and  Haci Omer Sabanci
Holding AS (SAHOL)  that oversees Turkey’s second-largest pension fund.  To contact the reporter on this story:
