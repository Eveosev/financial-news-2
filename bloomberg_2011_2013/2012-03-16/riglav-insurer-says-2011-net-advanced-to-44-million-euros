Zavarovalnica Triglav (ZVTG)  d.d.,
Sloveniaâ€™s biggest insurance company, said profit almost doubled
last year as premiums rose. Shares surged.  Net income rose to 47.5 million euros ($62 million) from
26.6 million euros a year earlier, the Ljubljana-based company
said in an e-mailed statement late yesterday. Triglav collected
989.4 million euros of gross written premiums in 2011, it said.  Shares soared the most in more than two years, advancing 99
euro cents, or 8.3 percent to close at 12.99 euros in Ljubljana.
That gives the company a market value of 295 million euros. The
stock rose 30 percent from the start of the year, compared with
a 3.6 percent drop of the benchmark  SBITOP index  in the same
period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
