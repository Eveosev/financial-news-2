Portugal  may begin the sale of
state-owned airline  TAP SGPS SA (TAP)  amid growing signs of bid
interest, Antonio Monteiro, a spokesman for the carrier, said.  “The sale could kick off in coming weeks,” Monteiro said
by phone today. He said his forecast is based on recent comments
made by the  Portuguese government .  International Consolidated Airlines Group SA (IAG) , the owner of
British Airways, has shown an interest in TAP. Other bidders may
emerge, Monteiro said. IAG hired JPMorgan Chase & Co. and
Portuguese law firm PLMJ to advise on the matter, Jornal de
Negocios reported on March 7, without saying how it obtained the
information.  Portugal has agreed to sell TAP in 2012 as part of a plan
to raise funds and comply with the terms of a 78 billion-euro
($102 billion) bailout from the European Union and the
 International Monetary Fund . The government has already sold
stakes in utility  EDP-Energias de Portugal SA  and in  REN-Redes
Energeticas Nacionais SA (RENE) , the operator of the country’s
electricity and natural gas grids.  TAP will announce its 2011 results at the end of this
month, Monteiro said. Higher fuel prices last year may weigh on
earnings, he said, without providing details.  To contact the reporter on this story:
