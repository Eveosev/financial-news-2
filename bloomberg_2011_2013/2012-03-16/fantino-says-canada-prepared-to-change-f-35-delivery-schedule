Canada is prepared to delay
purchases of  Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT) ’s F-35 fighter jet and take
other steps to keep costs in check, Associate Defence Minister
Julian Fantino said today.  Fantino, speaking to defense industry officials in Ottawa,
said Canada won’t spend more than the C$9 billion ($9.1 billion)
it initially budgeted to replace its aging fleet of fighter
jets. The government’s modernization of its current fleet of
McDonnell Douglas CF-18 Hornet planes provides the flexibility
for a later transition, Fantino said.  “Our intention is to receive the F-35 when it is most cost
effective and the development is complete,” Fantino said at an
address to the Canadian Association of Defence and Security
Industries, adding that “all options are on the table.”  “This is something that we can and will adapt in order to
achieve the best cost results,” Fantino said.  When it first announced its plans in 2010, Canada said it
would acquire 65 of the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter jets starting
in 2016. Fantino said today the F-35 is expected to be most cost
effective and fully developed between 2017 and 2023. Canada is
committed to the program, and the F-35 is the only aircraft that
meets the country’s requirements, Fantino said.  Speaking to reporters following his speech, Fantino
declined to say whether purchasing fewer planes was an option.  To contact the reporter on this story:
