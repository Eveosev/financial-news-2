The European debt rating firm being
developed by consulting company  Roland Berger  has been delayed
after failing to raise the 300 million euros ($393 million) it
needed in startup capital by the end of the first quarter,
 Boersen-Zeitung  said today, citing company partner Markus Krall.  The company wants to find enough investors by the end of
the third quarter of 2012, Krall said, according to the
newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
