Spectra Energy Corp. (SE)  cleared an
environmental hurdle in its plan to build a $1.2 billion
pipeline that would bring natural gas from New Jersey to
 Manhattan .  Building and operating the approximately 16-mile (26-
kilometer) project would have a “less-than-significant”
environmental impact with mitigation measures in place, staff of
the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission said in a  report 
issued today. The four-member commission must still vote on the
project, Tamara Young-Allen, an agency spokeswoman, said in a
March 14 interview.  The pipeline would bring 800 million cubic feet of gas a
day from Linden, New Jersey, to Manhattan’s West Village, via
Staten Island and Jersey City. Spectra said the project would
bring abundant gas from new fields including the Marcellus
Shale, potentially lowering prices for  New Jersey  and New York
consumers.  Jersey City Mayor Jerramiah Healy and the municipal council
have  expressed opposition  to the pipeline, which they say will
run through densely populated and historic neighborhoods.
Government agencies including the  Port Authority  of New York &
New Jersey raised concerns about the project’s impact on
bridges, tunnels and rail systems.  Spectra, based in Houston, expects to finish the line in
November 2013, according to its website. The company agreed to
use thicker pipe and altered the route in several places to
allay local concerns.  To contact the reporter on this story:
