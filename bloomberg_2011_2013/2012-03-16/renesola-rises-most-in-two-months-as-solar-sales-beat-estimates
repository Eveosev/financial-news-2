Renesola Ltd. (SOL) , a Chinese maker of
solar products, rose the most in two months after reporting
fourth-quarter sales that beat analysts’ estimates and
forecasting at least a 39 percent increase in shipments.  Renesola’s American depositary receipts  advanced 14 percent 
to $2.81 at the close in New York, the biggest gain since Jan.
11. Before today, the Jiashan, China-based company had increased
61 percent this year. Each ADR is worth two ordinary shares
traded in  London .  Fourth-quarter revenue was $187.7 million, the company said
today in a statement. That beat the $137.7 million average of
three analysts’s  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg. Renesola
expects shipments of crystalline wafers and modules will climb
to a range of 1,800 to 2,000 megawatts this year, up from 1,295
megawatts last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
