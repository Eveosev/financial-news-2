S. Dilli Raj, chief financial
officer at  SKS Microfinance Ltd. (SKSM) , comments on India’s annual
budget released today by Finance Minister  Pranab Mukherjee .  The minister announced a plan to introduce a new microfinance
institutions’ bill. Raj spoke in a phone interview from
Hyderabad.  “We welcome the finance minister’s commitment to the
bill’s introduction this budget session. Its passage would
enable us to resume lending and collection in  Andhra Pradesh . It
will also bring in long-term regulatory clarity for the sector.  ‘‘The overall financial inclusion thrust and the rural
focus is something that we are happy about because it will help
our borrowers. It shows the government’s commitment to last-mile
credit delivery.  ‘‘If regulatory clarity is given through the bill, then it
will give comfort to the creditors and investors. It would make
it easier for us to raise funds.  ‘‘The target for agricultural credit has been increased to
5.75 trillion rupees ($114 billion). We originate agri loans and
then hive them off to the banks. Any increase in the target to
that extent enables us to raise more funds.’’  To contact the reporter on this story:
