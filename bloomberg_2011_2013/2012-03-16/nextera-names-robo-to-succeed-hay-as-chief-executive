NextEra Energy Inc. (NEE) , owner of
Florida’s largest electric utility, named James Robo, its
current president and chief operating officer, to succeed
retiring Lewis Hay as chief executive officer on July 1.  Hay, 56, will also step down as executive chairman at the
end of 2013, the  Juno Beach , Florida-based company said in a
statement today. Hay, the CEO since June 2001, doubled NextEra’s
generating capacity to 41,000 megawatts and made it the largest
U.S. generator of wind and solar power.  Robo, 49, joined the company in March 2002 after working
for General Electric Co. and a management consulting firm. He
was named president of the electricity generation unit within a
few months of joining and COO in 2006. Robo has a bachelor’s
degree and a master’s in business administration from Harvard.  NextEra, the owner of  Florida  Power & Light, has  more than
doubled  its share price since June 2001, compared with an 12
percent decline in the S&P 500 Utilities Index.  The announcement was made after the close of regular
trading. NextEra fell 9 cents to $60.16.  To contact the reporter on this story:
