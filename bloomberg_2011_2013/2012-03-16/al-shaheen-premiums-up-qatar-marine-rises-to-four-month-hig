Middle East crudes ended the week
higher as Qatar’s Al-Shaheen crude sold at increased premiums
and  Abu Dhabi ’s Upper Zakum was assessed at the strongest in
more than four months.  Upper Zakum (PGCPUPZK)  crude rose 15 cents to 48 cents more than its
official selling price, the highest since Oct. 31, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg News.  Murban (PGCPMURB) , also produced by Abu
Dhabi, rose 5 cents to 33 cents above its official selling price,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Qatar International Petroleum Marketing Co., known as
Tasweeq, sold an undisclosed number of Al-Shaheen cargoes to a
U.S. major oil company at premiums from $2.20 to $2.70 a barrel,
five traders who participate in the market said. They declined
to be identified because the information is confidential. The
May cargoes were sold in a higher range than April loadings,
which went for $1.80 to $2.60 a barrel over Dubai.  PV Oil Co., Vietnam’s state-owned oil-marketing company,
sold two 250,000-barrel cargoes of Ruby crude for May loading at
premiums of as much as $2.80 for one shipment and $4.80 for the
second, said three traders who declined to be identified because
the information is confidential.  Brazil ’s Petroleo Brasileiro SA,
or  Petrobras (PETR4) , bought one cargo, according to two of the traders.
The other cargo was sold to an unidentified buyer.  PV Oil also offered to sell four 300,000-barrel cargoes of
Te Giac Trang crude for loading from May to June, said two
traders who declined to be identified because the information is
confidential. The offer closes March 26.  West African Imports  Asian refiners will increase their daily imports of West
African crude for loading in April by 2 percent from this month,
a survey of six traders and an analysis of loading programs

almost 1.9 million barrels a day, will be exported from Angola,
 Nigeria , the Republic of Congo,  Equatorial Guinea ,  Ghana  and
Gabon, according to the survey. This compares with about 1.8
million barrels a day scheduled for this month and 2.2 million
barrels a day in February, the highest level in at least seven
months.  Murphy Oil Corp. (MUR)  offered 600,000 barrels of Kikeh crude
