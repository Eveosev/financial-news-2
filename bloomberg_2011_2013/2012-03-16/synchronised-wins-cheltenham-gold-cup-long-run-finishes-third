Synchronized, ridden by Tony McCoy,
beat favorite Long Run to win the Gold Cup, the showcase event
at horse racing’s  Cheltenham Festival .  Synchronised, the third favorite at 8-1 odds, took the lead
after the last fence of the 3 1/4-mile race and finished ahead
of 50-1 outsider The Giant Bolster and last year’s winner Long
Run, the 15-8 favorite.  “He gave him a fantastic ride,” winning trainer Jonjo
O’Neill said of McCoy in a televised interview. “He gave him
great rhythm.”  Kauto Star, the second favorite at 4-1 to win his third
Gold Cup, was pulled up by jockey Ruby Walsh halfway through the
race. The 2007 and 2009 Gold Cup winner had only been cleared to
run the race by trainer Paul Nicholls last week after the 12-
year-old bay gelding suffered a heavy fall in training.  Kauto Star’s owner Clive Smith said Walsh told him the
horse “felt fine” when he returned to the stable.  “It’s a very good bet that we would do that,” he added
when asked if he would retire the horse after today’s race.  Kauto Star made history on Boxing Day last year when he
beat Long Run to become the first horse to win the King George
VI Chase five times.  Other winners on the final day of the festival were
Countrywide Flame in the Triumph Hurdle, Alderwood in the
Handicap Hurdle, Brindisi Breeze in the Novices’ Hurdle, Salsify
in the Challenge Cup, Attaglance in the Jockeys’ Handicap Hurdle
and Bellvano in the Chase Challenge Cup.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
