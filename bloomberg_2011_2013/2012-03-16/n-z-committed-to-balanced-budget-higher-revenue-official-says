New Zealand’s government is
committed to eliminating its  budget deficit  and is
searching “very hard” for ways to boost  tax revenue , Secretary
to the Treasury Gabriel Makhlouf said in a speech.  “Right now our focus is on ensuring that the books are
balanced while increasing our global competitiveness,” he said
in prepared remarks in Queenstown to the International Fiscal
Association today. “That means that, while we have delivered
tax cuts, we will be looking very hard for well considered base-
broadening measures.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
