BlackRock Inc. (BLK) , the world’s biggest
money manager, paid Chief Executive Officer Laurence D. Fink
$21.9 million in 2011, an 8 percent decrease from the prior
year.  Fink received $500,000 in salary, $8.1 million in a cash
bonus, $13.1 million in stock awards and $192,250 in other
compensation, according to a regulatory filing today that
calculated pay using U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
rules. Fink earned $23.8 million in total compensation in 2010,
according to the filing.  Fink, 59, oversees $3.51 trillion in assets as head of
BlackRock. Richard M. Weil, who directs $148 billion as CEO of
 Janus Capital Group Inc. (JNS) , earned $6.15 million in 2011 compared
with $20.3 million the year before, according to a regulatory
filing.  The decrease in Fink’s compensation resulted from his bonus
declining 20 percent from $10.2 million and other compensation
dropping 46 percent from about $359,000 a year earlier.
BlackRock President Robert S. Kapito’s compensation fell 7.3
percent to about $17 million, also driven by a reduction in
bonus.  BlackRock’s  shares  fell 6.5 percent last year, compared
with a 20 percent decline in the 20-member  Standard & Poor’s 
index of asset managers and custody banks. Net income for New
York-based BlackRock in 2011 rose about 13 percent from a year
earlier to $2.34 billion. Assets under management fell 1.4
percent in 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
