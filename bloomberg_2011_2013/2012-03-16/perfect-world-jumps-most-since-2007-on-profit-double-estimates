Perfect World Co. (PWRD) , a Beijing-based
online-game developer, jumped the most since 2007 in U.S.
trading after reporting fourth-quarter net income that was
almost double the average of analysts’ estimates.  American depositary receipts of Perfect World surged 18
percent to $14.75 by 10:54 a.m. in  New York , the biggest jump
among companies on the  Bloomberg China-US 55 Index (CH55BN)  of the most-
traded Chinese companies in the U.S. The ADRs earlier soared as
much as 27 percent to $15.88, the biggest intraday advance since
July 2007.  Profit for the last quarter of 2011 more than doubled from
a year ago to 260 million yuan ($41 million), or 5.45 yuan per
ADR, the company said in a statement today.  Adjusted net income 
was 5.94 yuan per ADR share, beating the 3.53 yuan average
estimate of four analysts compiled by Bloomberg.  Sales for the quarter rose 32 percent from a year earlier
to 776.4 million yuan,  Perfect World  said. That compared with
analysts’ forecast of 712.5 million yuan and the company’s
previous prediction of 716 million yuan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
