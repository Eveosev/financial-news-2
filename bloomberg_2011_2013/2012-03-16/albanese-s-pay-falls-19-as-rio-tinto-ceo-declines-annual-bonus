Rio Tinto Group Chief Executive
Officer Tom Albanese’s total pay fell 19 percent last year after
he declined a bonus.  Albanese’s total remuneration was 4.47 million pounds ($7
million) compared with 5.54 million pounds a year earlier,
according to the London-based company’s annual report, published
today. His base salary rose 11 percent to 1.01 million pounds.  Albanese said Feb. 9 he won’t be considered for an annual
bonus after the world’s third-largest mining company posted a 59
percent decline in net income following an $8.9 billion charge
related to the 2007 acquisition of Alcan Inc.  “As the acquisition of Alcan happened on my watch, I felt
it only right not to be considered for an annual bonus this
year,” Albanese said last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
