OAO Sberbank (SBER) ,  Russia â€™s biggest
lender, plans to more than double its dividends for 2011, in a
payout equal to 15.3 percent of net income, Chief Executive
Officer  German Gref  said.  Sberbank may pay 2.08 rubles a common share and 2.59 rubles
a preferred share, Gref told reporters today in Moscow.  Net income under Russian accounting standards jumped about
79 percent last year to 310.6 billion rubles ($10.6 billion),
according to Gref. That means the payout may be equivalent to
$1.6 billion. Net income to international standards should be
higher than under Russian accounting, Gref said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
