A bus that crashed in  Switzerland 
on March 13, killing 28 people, wasn’t speeding at the time of
impact, a Swiss prosecutor said.  Analysis of security-camera footage shows the bus was
traveling below the speed limit when it slammed into the right-
hand wall of a tunnel, Valais Central Chief Prosecutor Olivier
Elsig told a news conference broadcast on Sky television.  The bus returning school children to  Belgium  after a skiing
holiday didn’t hit the left-hand side of the tunnel before the
final impact and no third party was involved, Elsig said, adding
that an autopsy of the driver also showed “no sign of excess
alcohol,” the prosecutor said.  More results from a police technical analysis were expected
“in a few hours,” Elsig said.  Police are investigating the possibility that the driver
was distracted while changing a DVD on the bus’s video system,
though there is as yet no firm evidence for this, he said.  Florence Renggli, a spokeswoman for Valais Hospital, said
two survivors are being held in an artificial coma.  To contact the reporter on this story:
