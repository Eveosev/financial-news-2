The cost of insuring corporate and
sovereign bonds against non-payment in  Australia  fell to the
lowest in more than seven months, according to credit-default
swap traders and data provider CMA.  The  Markit iTraxx Australia  index dropped 2 basis points to
133 basis points as of 11:50 a.m. in Sydney, Barclays Plc prices
show. The measure is set to close at its lowest level since Aug.
4, according to CMA, which is owned by CME Group Inc. and
compiles prices quoted by dealers in the privately negotiated
market.  The  Markit iTraxx Japan  index fell 1 basis point to 141 as
of 9:31 a.m. in  Tokyo , Deutsche Bank AG prices show. The gauge
is on track for its lowest close since March 14, CMA prices
show.  The  Markit iTraxx Asia  index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  was little changed at 139 basis points
as of 8:50 a.m. in Singapore, Barclays prices show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
credit quality. A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
