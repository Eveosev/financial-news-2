Perfect World Co. (PWRD)  advanced the most
in more than four years, leading gains in Chinese stocks traded
in the U.S., as expansion into overseas markets spurred a
doubling in profit and a special dividend.  Online-game developer Perfect World jumped 28 percent on
March 16 in New York, the best performer on the  Bloomberg China-
US 55 Index (CH55BN) . The gauge of the most-traded Chinese stocks in the
U.S. rose 0.6 percent last week, bolstered by video sharing
website  Youku Inc. (YOKU) ’s acquisition of competitor  Tudou Holdings
Ltd. (TUDO)   China Eastern (CEA)  Airlines Corp. traded 1.4 percent below  Hong
Kong  stock, the biggest discount in almost two weeks.  Perfect World’s profit in the fourth quarter was 68 percent
above the average analyst estimate as the company bolstered
sales of existing games and moved into other markets. The
company said on March 15 it will offer a $2 special dividend.
Youku said on March 12 it will buy Tudou in a stock swap that
values the takeover at $1.1 billion. The merger is a sign
 China ’s video website sector needs consolidation, according to
Tian X Hou, a senior analyst at T.H. Capital LLC.  “Perfect World’s special dividend plan and its much
higher-than-expected earnings last quarter helped boost its
stock,” said C. Ming Zhao, a Boston-based analyst at
Susquehanna International Group LLP, who raised his target price
on the company’s American depositary receipts to $19 from $18.
“The Youku-Tudou merger and some companies’ good earnings has
drawn investors attention back to company fundamentals.”  $95 Million of Dividends  Beijing-based Perfect World said in the March 15 statement
that it will distribute about $95 million to shareholders in
April in a special dividend plan. Net income for the last
quarter of 2011 more than doubled from a year ago to 260 million
yuan ($41 million), or 5.45 yuan per ADR, according to the
statement. Analysts had forecast adjusted net income of 3.53
yuan for each ADR, data compiled by Bloomberg showed.  American depositary receipts of  Perfect World  climbed to
$16.01 on March 16 in the biggest one-day gain since July 2007.  The ADRs  trade  at 4 times the company’s estimated earnings
for the next four quarters, data compiled by Bloomberg shows.
 Electronic Arts Inc. (EA) , a U.S. online video games provider, trades
at 18 times, the data show. The multiple is 50.5 for  Zynga Inc. (ZNGA) ,
the San Francisco-based social-gaming company that held its
initial public offering in December.  Zhao at Susquehanna said Perfect World continued to benefit
from sales of its existing game inventory, which helped limit
marketing expenses. Expansion into markets including  Brazil ,
 Indonesia  and the U.S. also boosted revenue, he said.  China ETF Drops  Jonathan Chan, an analyst at CCB International Securities
Ltd., on March 16  upgraded  Perfect World to outperform --
meaning it will gain more than the overall market return -- from
neutral, and raised the target price to $15.80 from $11.85.
Three other analysts reiterated their recommendations to buy the
stock on March 16.  The  iShares FTSE China 25 Index Fund , the biggest Chinese
exchange-traded fund in the U.S., fell 0.3 percent to $38.76,
extending its loss last week to 0.7 percent. The Bloomberg
China-US 55 Index was little changed at 104.82 on March 16.  Tudou, based in Beijing, jumped 145 percent last week to
$37.71, a record weekly gain. Tudou’s shareholders will receive
1.595 ADRs of Youku for each Tudou ADR they own in the stock-
swap deal, according to their joint statement on March 12.
Tudou’s ADRs retreated 3.3 percent on March 16.  Shanghai-based Youku climbed 8.2 percent last week after
the acquisition. Its ADRs slid 4.4 percent to $27.06 on March 16
after soaring 27 percent on March 12 to $31.85.  China Eastern Discount  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  advanced 1.3 percent to
2,404.74 on March 16, paring its loss last week to 1.4 percent.
The  Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  for Chinese companies
traded in Hong Kong declined 0.2 percent to 11,216.39, down 0.4
percent for the week.  ADRs of  China Eastern , the country’s third-largest carrier
by market value, dropped for a third day, losing 1.1 percent to
$18.23 on March 16. The ADRs, each representing 50 common shares
in the company, traded 1.4 percent  below  its Hong Kong stock,
which added 0.7 percent to HK$2.87, the equivalent of 37 U.S.
cents. The discount was the most since March 6.  Profit at Chinese airlines may drop 50 percent in the first
quarter this year, China Business News reported on March 15,
citing a research note from Ping An Securities Co., a unit of
China’s second-largest insurer.  The yuan weakened 0.2 percent last week to 6.3227 per
dollar, according to the China Foreign Exchange Trade System.
The steady appreciation of China’s yuan has ended as the
government allows bigger swings in the currency,  Jim O’Neill ,
chairman of Goldman Sachs Asset Management International, said
in a Bloomberg TV interview in  London  on March 16.  Chinese Premier  Wen Jiabao  said on March 14 that the yuan
may be near “equilibrium” and that policy makers will allow
greater exchange-rate volatility.  To contact the reporter on this story:
