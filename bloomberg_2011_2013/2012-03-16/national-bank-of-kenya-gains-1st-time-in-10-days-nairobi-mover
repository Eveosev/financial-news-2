National Bank of Kenya Ltd .,a
state-owned lender, climbed for the first time in 10 days on
bets earnings will decline less than expected.  The stock advanced 4.2 percent to 20 shillings by 10:45
a.m. in Nairobi, the capital, heading for its biggest gain since
Feb. 29, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “There may be a reduction in earnings but not as severe as
was expected,” Eric Musau, a research analyst at Nairobi-based
Standard Investment Bank Ltd., said in a phone interview today.  Net income in the nine months through September dropped to
1.23 billion shillings ($14.8 million) from 1.35 billion
shillings a year earlier, the lender said in November.  NBK, as the lender is known, is expected to make some
“modest recovery” in the fourth quarter from trading in fixed
income securities, Musau said.  The lender, which will report full-year earnings on March
19, is expected to announce a median net income of 2.14 billion
shillings, according to a survey of two analysts by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
