Crude oil options volatility
declined as underlying futures advanced while remaining within a
three-week trading range.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
May, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge
of options prices, was 25.02 percent as of 3:30 p.m. in  New
York , down from 26.20 percent yesterday.  “We’ve seen volatility weaken the whole week and today is
no exception,” said Fred Rigolini, vice president of Paramount
Options Inc. in New York. “We’re a little bit higher, going
into the weekend on a very slow market, and we’re still in a
tight range.”  Crude for May delivery gained $1.93 to settle at $107.58 on
