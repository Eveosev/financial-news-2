German Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s
government aims to meet its constitutional balanced-budget
target two years ahead of time in 2014, a Finance Ministry
official said today in Berlin.  The federal government’s budget deficit will decline from 1
percent of gross domestic product this year to 0.54 percent in
2013 and 0.26 percent in 2014, said the official, who briefed
reporters today under condition of anonymity.  The debt brake obliges the federal government to limit the
shortfall to 0.35 percent of GDP from 2016. The government plans
to shrink the deficit to 0.14 percent in 2015 and 0.01 percent
in 2016, the official said, citing the ministry’s medium-term
budget plan through 2016.  Merkel’s government is stepping up the pace of budget
consolidation after winning support to put stiffer rules on
deficit control at the heart of  Europe ’s efforts to combat the
debt crisis.  While 2012 federal net new borrowing will more than double
from last year to 34.8 billion euros ($45.9 billion), boosted by
two cash payments into the euro region’s permanent financial
backstop, the amount will drop to 19.6 billion euros in 2013,
14.6 billion euros in 2014, 10.3 billion euros in 2015 and 1.1
billion euros in 2016, the official said.  The government cut accumulated planned 2013-2016 borrowing
by more than 29 billion euros from an earlier target, the
official said. The plan, to be approved by Merkel’s Cabinet on
March 21, is based on a government forecast that sees an
economic expansion of 0.7 percent this year, the official said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
