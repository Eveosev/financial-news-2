(Corrects second paragraph to show that the former
management cut jobs.)  Air Seychelles Ltd will return to
profit in 24 months after a restructuring that will involve more
job cuts,  James Hogan , the chief executive officer of  Etihad
Airways  said.  A second round of job cuts will take place in the next six
weeks after consultations with workers, Hogan told reporters
today in the capital, Victoria. In January the former management
of the airline fired 166 workers.  Etihad owns 40 percent of Air Seychelles and has a five-
year management contract of the islandâ€™s national airline.  To contact the reporter on this story:
