Paris wheat rose to a six-month
high on speculation the European crop will decline and Morocco
will need to import more of the grain.  The European Union’s 2012-13 wheat harvest will fall to
131.1 million metric tons, down 1.6 million tons from a prior
estimate, as freezing weather in February hurt plants, research
firm Strategie Grains said yesterday, according to Dow Jones.
Morocco’s cereal crop may fall 52 percent to 4 million tons,
Gainsborough, England-based Gleadell Agriculture Ltd. said on
its website.  “The Strategie Grains report confirmed the damage this
past winter, confirmed exportable supplies are tight and helps
confirm global wheat supplies aren’t going to hurt corn
demand,” Lafayette, Indiana-based Mike Zuzolo, president of
Global Commodity Analytics & Consulting, said by phone today.  Milling wheat for November delivery on NYSE Liffe in Paris
rose 0.7 percent today to 204.25 euros ($269.14), the sixth-
straight increase. The price earlier touched 205 euros, the
highest since Sept. 13.  Grain exports from  France ’s Rouen port,  Europe ’s biggest
cereal-shipping hub, rose 4.4 percent this week to the highest
level in 11 months. Shipments totaled 231,849 tons from March 8
to March 14, the port said. Exports included 192,699 tons of
soft wheat.  To contact the reporter on this story:
