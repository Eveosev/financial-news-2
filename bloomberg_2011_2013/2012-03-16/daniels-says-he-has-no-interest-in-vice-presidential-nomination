Indiana (BEESIN)  Governor  Mitch Daniels , who
declined to seek the U.S. presidency this year, said he isn’t
interested in being selected as the Republican vice presidential
nominee.  “I would like to believe there are ways a desperately
concerned citizen can contribute” without running for a top
national office, Daniels, a former head of the U.S. Office of
Management and Budget, said at the Society of American Business
Editors and Writers conference in Indianapolis. Daniels said he
has no regrets about deciding not to seek the Republican
presidential nomination.  “This was never anything I lusted in my heart to do,” he
said.  Daniels declined to offer an opinion on whether former U.S.
House Speaker  Newt Gingrich  or Texas Representative  Ron Paul 
should stay in the Republican primary contest.  “It’s not for me to say,” Daniels said. Both Gingrich and
Paul trail former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney and onetime
Pennsylvania Senator  Rick Santorum  in the Republican race.  The proliferation of new media allows candidates to remain
viable for longer than in previous election cycles, Daniels
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
