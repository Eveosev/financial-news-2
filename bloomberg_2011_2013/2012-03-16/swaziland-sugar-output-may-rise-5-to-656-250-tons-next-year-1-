Sugar output in Swaziland,  Africa ’s
fourth-largest producer of the sweetener, may rise 5 percent
next year as farmers expand plantings and use more irrigation,
the country’s industry board said.  Output may climb to 656,250 metric tons in the 12 months
through March 2013 from an estimated 625,000 tons a year
earlier, said Mike Matsebula, chief executive officer of the
Swaziland Sugar Association, in an interview in Nairobi,  Kenya ’s
capital.  “We’ve been steadily increasing acreage under cane and
much of that will be ready for harvesting in the coming
season,” he said. Growers are also replanting their fields with
higher-yielding cane through a European-financed program, he
said.  The country sells about a fifth its sugar to European
nations, while domestic and regional customers in  South Africa ,
Namibia, Lesotho and Botswana account for more than half of
purchases, he said. About 47,000 hectares (116,140 acres) of the
kingdom, which borders South Africa and Mozambique, has sugar
planted by about 500 smaller farmers, two large sugar estates
and three millers of the sweetener, he said.  Royal Swaziland Sugar Corp. (RSSC) , based in Simunye, about 100
kilometers (62 miles) northeast of the capital Mbabane,
processes two-thirds of Swaziland’s sugar, according to the
company’s website. It competes with Ubombo Sugar Ltd., a local
unit of South Africa’s Illovo Sugar Ltd.  Swaziland trails South Africa, Egypt and Sudan in
terms of average sugar output over the three years through 2010
on the continent, according to Lindsay Jolly, a senior economist
with the  International Sugar Organization .  To contact the reporter on this story:
