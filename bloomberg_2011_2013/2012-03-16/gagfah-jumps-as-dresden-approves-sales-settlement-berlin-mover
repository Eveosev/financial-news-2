Gagfah SA (GFJ) , the biggest residential
landlord in  Germany , rose to the highest since May 19 after
Dresdenâ€™s city council approved a settlement for a dispute over
the privatization of the WOBA Dresden unit.  Gagfah  rose  as much as 7.8 percent and was trading 6.6
percent higher at 6.13 euros as of 9:50 a.m. in Frankfurt,
valuing the company at 1.36 billion euros ($1.8 billion). The
city council approved a total settlement from the Luxembourg-
based company of 36 million euros through 2020.  Dresden sued the company for 1.08 billion euros in April
2011, claiming it broke a sales agreement. Gagfah filed a
countersuit over the claim in June.  To contact the reporter on this story:
