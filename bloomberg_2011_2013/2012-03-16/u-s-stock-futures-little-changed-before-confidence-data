U.S. stocks were little changed,
with the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index poised for its biggest
weekly gain in 2012, as an unexpected decline in  consumer
confidence  and a rally in oil tempered optimism about growth.  Energy shares had the biggest advance in the  S&P 500  among
10 industries.  Schlumberger (SLB)  Ltd. and  Noble Corp. (NE)  increased more
than 2 percent. The Bloomberg U.S. Airlines Index slumped 2.3
percent amid concern about higher fuel prices.  Bank of America
Corp. (BAC)  jumped 3.5 percent, surging 20 percent in four days.  Apple (AAPL) 
Inc. gained 0.1 percent, after briefly rising above $600
yesterday, as it started selling the new iPad today.  The S&P 500 advanced 0.2 percent to 1,405.16 at 12:42 p.m.
 New York  time. The benchmark gauge for American equities has
risen 2.5 percent since March 9 and is poised for a  fifth 
straight week of gains. The  Dow Jones Industrial Average  gained
5.11 points, or less than 0.1 percent, to 13,257.87. About 3.9
billion shares changed hands on  U.S. exchanges .  “Things are improving at a slow, but steady pace,” said
Madelynn Matlock, who helps oversee about $14.6 billion at
Huntington Asset Advisors in Cincinnati. “The bugaboo in the
background is  oil prices . I filled up my car yesterday and it
hurts. If oil prices pop up, it will be different story.”  Equities were little changed as  confidence  among consumers
unexpectedly fell in March, a sign rising fuel costs may be
starting to weigh on the economic outlook. The cost of living
rose in February by the most in 10 months, reflecting a jump in
gasoline. Treasury Secretary  Timothy F. Geithner  said yesterday
rising oil prices show “we still face a dangerous and uncertain
world” and there’s no easy way to lower gasoline costs.  Best Since 1998  The S&P 500 is still on pace for the best first quarter
since  1998 (SPX) , after rallying 12 percent, amid better-than-
estimated economic and corporate reports. It trades at 14.5
times reported earnings, the highest valuation level since July
while still below the average since 1954 of 16.4 times earnings.
Financial and technology shares had the  biggest gains  among 10
industries in the quarter, surging at least 20 percent.  “It’s a bit of acrophobia,” said  John Manley , chief
equity strategist for Wells Fargo Advantage Funds in New York,
citing potential investors’ fear after the S&P 500 rose to the
highest level since 2008. His firm oversees $209 billion. “The
market has just gone up pretty quickly. Meantime, slow and
slightly improving has been the way to look at the economy.”  Energy (S5ENRS)  shares gained as oil traded above $105 a barrel on
speculation that fuel demand will climb with the economic
rebound in the U.S. Schlumberger, the world’s largest oilfield-
services provider, added 2 percent to $76.45. Noble increased
4.9 percent to $41.26.  Airlines Tumble  An increase in oil prices sent airline shares down.  US
Airways Group Inc. (LCC)  lost 4.6 percent to $7.23.  United Continental
Holdings Inc. (UAL)  declined 2.6 percent to $19.86.  Financial shares in the S&P 500 rebounded from earlier
losses. The  KBW Bank Index (BKX)  rallied 9.4 percent in four days
following dividend increases by banks including JPMorgan Chase &
Co. Bank of America increased 3.5 percent, the most in the Dow,
to $9.56.  Zions Bancorporation (ZION)  added 1.6 percent to $22.48.  American International Group Inc. (AIG)  added 0.1 percent to
$28.10. The insurer’s repayment of $1.6 billion to the U.S.
Treasury Department pushed the government’s portion of recouped
financial-bailout money to 80 percent, said a Treasury official
familiar with the matter.  Apple increased 0.1 percent to $586.07, after yesterday
rising above $600 for the first time. The 9.7-inch iPad,
unveiled on March 7, is the biggest upgrade yet to Apple’s
tablet before  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)  introduces new software for
competing devices.  Cost Conscious  Generating demand with the model is important for Apple to
fend off competition from devices using  Google Inc. (GOOG) ’s Android
operating system and the $199 Kindle Fire from  Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) 
that’s popular among cost-conscious buyers.  The S&P 500 has “healthy intermediate-term momentum” that
helped it recover from a slump at the beginning of the month and
may drive it 2.7 percent higher, MKM Partners LP’s chief market
technician said.  The benchmark index of U.S. stocks rose to 1,402.60
yesterday, its highest level since June 2008, after falling 2.2
percent over three days, starting on March 2. The market may be
staging a “breakout” after matching its 2011 highs last week,
MKM Partners’ Katie Stockton said, citing the momentum indicator
known as Moving Average Convergence/Divergence. A second-
straight weekly close above 1,370 today would confirm the trend
and open the way to a rise to 1,440, Stockton said.  ‘Bullish’  “I’m bullish on the market from an intermediate
perspective based largely on momentum and this breakout that
appears to be under way,” Stockton said in a phone interview.
“The fact that the S&P 500 has managed to exceed resistance at
the 2011 high tells us that breakout should overrule any
negative set-up otherwise.”  A buyout of  Quest Software Inc. (QSFT)  at the industry’s lowest
premium is leaving the door open for higher bids by companies
from  International Business Machines Corp. (IBM)  to  Dell Inc. (DELL)   Quest, the provider of business software for managing and
protecting data, has traded above a $23-a-share offer every day
since the company agreed last week to sell itself to Insight
Venture Partners, which also owns stakes in Twitter Inc. and
Zumba Fitness LLC. The New York-based investment firm offered a
13 percent premium, less than half the average for billion-
dollar acquisitions of applications software companies in  North
America , according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “The general feeling from the market is that the price is
too low and that they can do better,” Chris Konstantinos, who
helps oversee $3 billion as director of international portfolio
management at Riverfront Investment Group LLC in Richmond,
 Virginia , said in a telephone interview. Quest’s stock price
“indicates to me that there’s probably some interest from other
buyers out there,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
