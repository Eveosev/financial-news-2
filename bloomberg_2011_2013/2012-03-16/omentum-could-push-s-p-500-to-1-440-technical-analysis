The  Standard & Poor’s 500 (SPX)  Index has
“healthy intermediate-term momentum” that helped it recover
from a slump at the beginning of the month and may drive it 2.7
percent higher, MKM Partners LP’s chief market technician said.  The benchmark index of U.S. stocks rose to 1,402.60
yesterday, its highest level since June 2008, after falling 2.2
percent over three days, starting on March 2. The market may be
staging a “breakout” after matching its 2011 highs last week,
MKM Partners’ Katie Stockton said, citing the momentum indicator
known as Moving Average Convergence/Divergence. A second-
straight weekly close above 1,370 today would confirm the trend
and open the way to a rise to 1,440, Stockton said.  “I’m bullish on the market from an intermediate
perspective based largely on momentum and this breakout that
appears to be under way,” Stockton said in a phone interview.
“The fact that the  S&P 500  has managed to exceed resistance at
the 2011 high tells us that breakout should overrule any
negative set-up otherwise.”  The S&P 500 has risen 28 percent from its 2011 low in
October and gained every month since then except for November,
as  corporate earnings  beat analysts’ estimates for a 12th
straight quarter.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to predict changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index.  The Moving Average Convergence/Divergence line is
calculated by subtracting the index’s average level during the
past 26 days from the average over the past 12 days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
