Central and eastern  Europe ’s
economic outlook improved to a positive reading for the first
time in almost a year, the ZEW Center for European  Economic
Research  and Erste Group Bank AG said.  The economic-sentiment indicator, a measure of investor
confidence in the region, rose 36.1 points to 16.6 points from
minus 19.5 points in February, ZEW and Erste Bank said today in
an e-mailed statement. That’s the first result above zero since
May 2011, it said.  The ZEW index reflects the difference between the
percentage of analysts who have positive outlooks and those with
negative views. Ratings range from a maximum of 100 points to a
minimum of minus 100 points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
