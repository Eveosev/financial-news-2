Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (LEHMQ) , the
failed investment bank that is planning a payment to creditors
next month, received $850 million for its preferred equity in
asset manager Neuberger Berman Group LLC.  Lehman won court approval in December for a plan to sell
its minority equity stake in Neuberger Berman, a transaction
that it said would generate $1.5 billion, almost double an offer
received in 2008.  The $850 million will be available when Lehman makes a
distribution to creditors scheduled for April 17, Lehman said
today in a statement. New York-based Lehman, which collapsed in
2008, said March 6 that it exited bankruptcy.  Neuberger Berman intends to be fully employee-owned in the
next four to five years, Standard & Poorâ€™s wrote in a March 6
note.  The case is In re Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., 08-13555,
 U.S. Bankruptcy Court , Southern District of New York
(Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
