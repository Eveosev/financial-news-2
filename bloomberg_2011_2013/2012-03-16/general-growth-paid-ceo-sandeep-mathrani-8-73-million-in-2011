General Growth Properties Inc. (GGP) , the
second-largest U.S. shopping-mall owner, paid Chief Executive
Officer Sandeep Mathrani $8.73 million in 2011, his first year
at the company.  Mathrani’s pay consisted of $1.15 million in salary, a $1.5
million cash bonus, stock options valued at $3.88 million and
$2.2 million in other compensation, the Chicago-based company
said today in a regulatory  filing .  Mathrani joined General Growth as CEO in January 2011, soon
after the company left bankruptcy protection. He was previously
executive vice president of New York-based  Vornado Realty
Trust (VNO) ’s retail division. His total compensation at Vornado in
2010 was $7.84 million, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  General Growth, second to Indianapolis-based  Simon Property
Group Inc. (SPG)  in size, said  funds from operations  excluding some
items rose in the fourth quarter as tenant demand for space in
top-tier retail centers increased. So-called core FFO, a measure
of a property owner’s ability to generate cash, climbed to
$279.8 million, or 29 cents a share, from $230.1 million, or 23
cents, a year earlier, the company said on Feb. 8.  Today’s proxy statement was filed after the close of
regular U.S. trading. General Growth rose 1.9 percent to $16.91
at the close in  New York . The shares have gained 19 percent in
the past year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
