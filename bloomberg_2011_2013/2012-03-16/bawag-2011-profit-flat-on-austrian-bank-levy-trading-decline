Bawag PSK Bank, the Austrian lender
controlled by Cerberus Capital Management LP, said profit was
little changed last year after lower bad-debt provisions were
eroded by a national bank levy and a decline in trading income.  Net income rose to 122.5 million euros ($160 million) from
121.8 million euros a year earlier, the Vienna-based bank said
in a statement today. Revenue from lending and fees and
commissions increased by 5.5 percent, while provisions for bad
debt narrowed by 23 percent. That was offset by a 80 percent
decline in trading income. Bawag also had to pay a 20.2 million-
euro bank levy to  Austria .  “The year 2012 will be negatively influenced by the
ongoing and unsolved debt crisis in  Europe  at least in the first
half,” Chief Executive Officer Byron Haynes told reporters in
Vienna today, adding that “the latest developments and the
leading economic indicators give cause to hope that the economy
will enter a recovery again in the second half of the year.”  The lender, which in 2010 returned to profit for the first
time since 2006, has received 550 million euros in state capital
under Austria’s bank stabilization program. Including that
capital, its Tier 1 capital ratio, a measure of financial
strength, rose to 9.6 percent, from 8.9 percent a year earlier.  Bawag won’t repay the state aid in 2012 or 2013, Haynes
said.  Hungary Woes  Cerberus, a New York-based private-equity firm, bought
Bawag for 3.2 billion euros in 2006 after the bank almost
collapsed. It injected 205 million euros in capital along with
the state aid. Cerberus hasn’t received any dividend payment
since it bought the bank, and Bawag isn’t allowed to pay any
until at least 2012, while it holds the state capital.  Cerberus has no plans to sell Bawag, Haynes said.  Bawag holds less than 5 percent in MKB in  Hungary  after not
participating in capital injections last year, with  Bayerische
Landesbank  owning the rest, Chief Financial Officer Andreas Arndt said. The bank also took a 58 million-euro writedown on
its MKB stake in 2011, he said. The MKB investment now is valued
at less than book value, the CFO said.  An increase of the Austrian bank levy by 25 percent,
introduced to finance the partial nationalization of
 Oesterreichische Volksbanken AG (VBPS)  last month, will also hurt the
bank, it said.  Talks to merge Bawag with Volksbanken, Austria’s fourth-
largest bank, collapsed in 2010 and haven’t been revived, Haynes
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
