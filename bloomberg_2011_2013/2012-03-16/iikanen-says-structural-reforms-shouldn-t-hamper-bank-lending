European Central Bank council
member  Erkki Liikanen  said the group examining the need for
structural reforms for banks must find a balance between
financial stability and keeping banks lending.  “There are two sides,” Liikanen, who heads the group,
said in an interview in Helsinki yesterday. “One is financial
stability; it’s important to guarantee and improve it. At the
same time, we must remember that banking is very important in
offering funding for the economy and citizens.”  Liikanen, 61, was picked by the European Union’s financial
services chief,  Michel Barnier , to lead the group mandated to
assess whether banks should build firewalls to protect taxpayers
and customers when failure of one part of a lender threatens to
cascade throughout the company.  The group will examine ideas such as those put forward by a
U.K. government-sponsored panel chaired by  John Vickers  as well
as a U.S. proposal championed by former Federal Reserve Chairman
 Paul Volcker  to bar commercial banks from engaging in trading
solely for their own profit.  The group has started its work and will report “by the end
of the summer,” Liikanen said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
