Hungarian police started legal
proceedings against far-right demonstrators who attacked an
office building housing the local offices of the  International
Monetary Fund  in Budapest, news website  Index  said today, citing
city police.  A group of more than 100 far-right demonstrators belonging
to the the Sixty-Four Counties Youth Movement broke into the
office late yesterday to present a petition to the IMF
representative and lit pyrotechnic torches before police forced
them out, Index said.  After leaving the building a leader of the group encouraged
his followers to battle further, according to Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
