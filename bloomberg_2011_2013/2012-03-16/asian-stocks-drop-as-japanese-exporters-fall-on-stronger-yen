Asian  stocks  fell, after swinging
between gains and losses, after the recent rally pushed its
valuations to its highest level in almost two years. The gauge
earlier rose as U.S. jobs and manufacturing data added to signs
the world’s biggest economy is recovering.  Samsung Electronics Co., a South Korean consumer
electronics maker, slid 1 percent in Seoul, the  second-biggest
drag  on the Asian index, after its Chief Executive Officer said
the industry’s growth will slow.  Bridgestone Corp. (5108) , the world’s
biggest tiremaker, fell 1 percent in Tokyo after a report the

said  Mitsushige Akino , who oversees about $600 million at
Ichiyoshi Investment Management Co. in Tokyo. “There’s no doubt
the  U.S. economy  is headed in a good direction. Fundamentals are
strong and money is flowing into  Asia . With the U.S. recovering
and  Europe ’s debt crisis no longer acting as a drag, the global
economy’s not headed for a decline.”  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index fell 0.2 percent to 127.57 as

About seven stocks retreated for every six that advanced, with
all but one of the gauge’s 10 industry groups declining.  The gauge rose 12 percent this year through yesterday as
U.S. economic reports boosted confidence in the world’s largest
economy, and amid speculation  China  will further ease monetary
policy.  Regional Indexes  Stocks in the Asian benchmark were valued at 15.1 times
 estimated earnings on average , the highest level since May 2010,

Index.  Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  rose 0.1 percent and

 Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP) , which tracks the bigger of China’s
stock exchanges, rose 1.3 percent.  Singapore’s Straits Times Index fell 0.5 percent. The city-

pharmaceuticals and electronics surged after a holiday in
January reduced overseas sales, a report showed.  U.S. Jobs  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPXL1)  were little
changed today. The index gained 0.6 percent in  New York

years.  Manufacturing (EMPRGBCI)  in the New York region expanded in March at
the fastest pace since June 2010, a report showed. Claims for
jobless benefits fell last week, matching the lowest level in
four years.  Samsung Electronics slid 1 percent to 1.238 million won in
Seoul after Chief Executive Officer Choi Gee Sung said the
electronics industry will enter a low-growth period and
competition will intensify.  Bridgestone fell 1 percent to 2,050 yen in Tokyo after the
Association of Natural Rubber Producing Countries said global
