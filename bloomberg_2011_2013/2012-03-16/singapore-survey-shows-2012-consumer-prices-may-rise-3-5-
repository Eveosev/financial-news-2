Singapore ’s consumer prices will
rise more than previously estimated in 2012, which may prompt
policy makers to allow the currency to strengthen, a central
bank survey of economists showed.  Inflation may be 3.5 percent this year, compared with last
quarter’s survey for a rate of 3.1 percent, according to the
median estimate of 23 economists and analysts in a report by the
 Monetary Authority of Singapore  released today. The  Singapore
dollar  may reach S$1.23 by the end of 2012, they predicted, from
S$1.2602 as of 11:43 a.m. local time today.  Higher housing rents, costlier private transportation and
unemployment at a 14-year low are adding to price pressures, and
policy makers have said inflation will remain “elevated and
volatile.” While the government forecasts expansion to slow in
2012, data today showing a surge in February exports are
prompting economists at Bank of America Merrill Lynch to
consider raising their estimates for gross domestic product.  “Growth prospects are improving,” Chua Hak Bin, a
Singapore-based economist at Bank of America, said after today’s
exports data release. “We may upgrade full-year GDP growth if
the February industrial production confirms the rebound. In our
view, the MAS will likely maintain the current ‘modest and
gradual’ appreciation in April, given stubbornly higher
inflation.”  The central bank, which uses the  exchange rate  as a policy
tool to manage inflation, usually reviews its stance in April
and October each year. The Singapore dollar may strengthen to
S$1.25 versus the U.S. currency by the end of this quarter, the
survey showed. It has gained about 3 percent this year.  GDP  (SGDYTY) may rise 2.5 percent in 2012 after rising 4.9 percent
last year, the economists predicted. Last quarter’s poll had a
median forecast of 3 percent for this year.  Non-oil domestic exports  may climb 4.2 percent in 2012,
faster than the 3.1 percent estimate in the previous survey, the
report showed. Exports rose 30.5 percent in February from a year
earlier, the trade promotion agency said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
