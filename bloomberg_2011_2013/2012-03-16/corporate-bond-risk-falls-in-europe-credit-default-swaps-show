The cost of insuring against
default on European corporate debt fell to the lowest since
August, according to BNP Paribas SA.  Contracts on the Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 50
companies with mostly high-yield credit ratings dropped 3.5
basis points to 543.5 at 8:30 a.m. in  London . The Markit iTraxx
Europe Index of 125 companies with investment-grade ratings fell
0.75 basis point to 123.2 basis points. A decline signals
improvement in perceptions of  credit quality .  The Markit iTraxx Financial Index linked to senior debt of
25 banks and insurers fell one basis point to 197 and the
subordinated index declined one to 347.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($13.1 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer
face value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
