Statoil ASA failed to sell  North
Sea   Forties (EUCSFORT)  crude for a third day. Gunvor Group Ltd. sought to
sell Russian Urals blend in the Mediterranean without success
and no trades were done in northwest Europe as the grade dropped
to a 10-month low.  Angola  will export at least 51 cargoes of crude in May,
according to a partial loading program obtained by Bloomberg
News that doesn’t include the newest Pazflor grade.  North Sea  Statoil was unable to sell a cargo of Forties for April 5
to April 7 loading at 45 cents a barrel more than  Dated Brent (EUCRBRDT) ,
unchanged from its yesterday’s offer, a Bloomberg survey of
traders and brokers monitoring the Platts trading window showed.  Royal Dutch Shell Plc failed to sell Forties for April 2 to
April 4 at 30 cents more than Dated Brent, 5 cents less than its
offer yesterday, according to the survey.  Reported North Sea trading typically occurs during the
Platts window, which ends at 4:30 p.m.  London  time. Before the
session, Forties loading in 10 to 25 days was 71 cents a barrel
more than Dated Brent, compared with $1 yesterday, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Brent for May settlement traded at $124.56 a barrel on the
ICE Futures Europe exchange in London at the close of the
window, up from $123.03 yesterday. The June contract was at
$124.12, a discount of 44 cents to May.  Mediterranean/Urals  Gunvor failed to sell 80,000 metric tons of Urals for March
29 to April 2 delivery to Augusta,  Italy , at $2.65 a barrel less
than Dated Brent, the survey showed. Vitol Group didn’t find a
buyer for 140,000 tons of Urals for March 26 to March 30
delivery at $2.90 a barrel below the benchmark, according to the
survey. Yesterday, OAO Lukoil offered at a discount of $2.40.  No bids or offers were made for the blend in northwest
 Europe . Yesterday, Statoil sold a cargo at $2.85 a barrel less
than Dated Brent.  Urals (EUCSURNW)  was at a discount of $2.83 to Dated Brent in
northwest Europe today, the lowest since May 12, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  “The Russian flagship is under pressure as March loadings
out of Novorossiysk and the Baltic Sea rebounded” from
February,  Johannes Benigni , Vienna-based managing director of
JBC Energy GmbH, said in an e-mailed report today. “The higher
liftings come on the back of heavy maintenance in  Russia , but
also in Europe where some refiners limited runs due to dismal
refining economics.”  Two to four extra cargoes of 100,000 tons each will be
added to exports from the  Baltic Sea  port of Gdansk and one
additional 140,000-ton shipment for March 21 to March 25 will be
made from Novorossiysk on the Black Sea, according to a survey
of six traders who participate in the market.  West Africa  Asian refiners will increase their daily imports of West
African crude for loading in April by 2 percent from this month,
a survey of six traders and an analysis of loading programs
obtained by Bloomberg News showed.  A total of 60 cargoes amounting to 56.3 million barrels, or
1.88 million barrels a day, will be exported from Angola,
 Nigeria , the Republic of Congo,  Equatorial Guinea ,  Ghana  and
Gabon, according to the survey. This compares with 1.84 million
barrels a day scheduled for this month and 2.15 million barrels
a day in February, the highest level in at least seven months.  Qua Iboe (AFCSQUA1)  crude was at $2.78 a barrel more than Dated Brent,
compared with $2.67 yesterday, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
