The number of tourists visiting
 Slovakia  last year rose to 1.46 million from 1.33 million in
2010,  Hospodarske Noviny  reported, citing data provided by the
Slovak Statistical Office.  The 10 percent annual increase was partially driven by the
Ice Hockey World Championship held in the east European country
in May, the newspaper said. Tourists from the neighboring  Czech
Republic  had the biggest share on the total, followed by the
Poles and the Germans, Hospodarske reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
