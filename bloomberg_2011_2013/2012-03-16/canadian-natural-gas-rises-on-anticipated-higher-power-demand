Canadian natural gas rose for a
third day as warmer-than-normal weather in the U.S. boosted
hopes for air-conditioner use that would increase demand for
power-plant fuels.  Alberta  gas for April delivery gained 1.4 percent.
Chicago’s high March 19 may be 83 degrees Fahrenheit (28
Celsius), 35 above normal, according to State College,
Pennsylvania-based forecaster AccuWeather Inc. Minneapolis may
have a high of 78 tomorrow.  “There’s a bullish expectation for when people turn on
their air conditioners,” said Eric Bickel, a natural gas
anlayst with Summit Energy Services in Louisville,  Kentucky .
“We’re at June levels in mid-March. People are just seeing it’s
a good time to buy.”  Alberta gas for April delivery gained 2.5 cents to C$1.84 a
gigajoule ($1.76 per million British thermal units) as of 4:10
p.m. New York time on  NGX , a Canadian Internet market. NGX gas
advanced 6.3 percent this week.  Gas traded on the exchange is shipped to users in  Canada 
and the U.S. and priced on  TransCanada Corp. (TRP) ’s Alberta system.  Natural gas for April delivery on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  rose 4.7 cents to settle at $2.326 per million Btu.  Spot gas at the Alliance delivery point near Chicago
slipped 3.07 cents to $2.0309 per million Btu on the
 Intercontinental Exchange  in anticipation of lower weekend
factory demand. Alliance is an express line that can carry 1.5
billion cubic feet a day from western Canada.  Spot Prices  At the Kingsgate point on the border of Idaho and British
Columbia, gas gained 1.08 cents to $2.0979 per million Btu. At
Malin,  Oregon , where Canadian gas is traded for California
markets, gas declined 1.38 cents to $2.1091.  Volume on TransCanada’s Alberta system, which collects the
output of most of the nation’s gas wells, was 16.6 billion cubic
feet, 207 million below target.  Gas was flowing at a daily rate of 1.73 billion cubic feet
at Empress, Alberta, where the fuel is transferred to
TransCanada’s main line.  At McNeil, Saskatchewan, where gas is transferred to the
Northern Border Pipeline for shipment to the  Chicago  area, the
daily flow rate was 2.33 billion cubic feet.  Available capacity on TransCanada’s British Columbia system
at Kingsgate was 865 million cubic feet. The system was forecast
to carry 1.79 billion cubic feet today, or 67 percent of its
capacity of 2.65 billion.  The volume on  Spectra Energy’s  British Columbia system,
which gathers the fuel in northeastern British Columbia for
delivery to Vancouver and the Pacific Northwest, totaled 3.02
billion cubic feet at 3:05 p.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
