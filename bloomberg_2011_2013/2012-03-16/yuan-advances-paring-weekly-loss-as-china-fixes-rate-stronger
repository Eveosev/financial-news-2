The yuan advanced, paring a weekly
decline, after the central bank raised the currency’s fixing by
the most in a week.  The People’s Bank of  China  set its daily  reference rate  
0.25 percent stronger today at 6.3200 against the dollar.
Premier  Wen Jiabao  said in Beijing this week the yuan may be
near equilibrium and policy makers will allow greater movement
in the  exchange rate . Asian currencies rose today after better-
than-expected U.S. economic data improved the outlook for the
region’s exports.  “China’s policy makers are definitely increasing
volatility, they’re really serious now,” said Craig Chan, the
Singapore-based head of foreign-exchange strategy for Asia
excluding  Japan  at Nomura Holdings Inc. “They want to
eventually move to a more market-driven currency.”  The yuan climbed 0.14 percent to 6.3213 per dollar as of
10:28 a.m. in  Shanghai , according to the China Foreign Exchange
Trade System. The currency lost 0.17 percent this week. The yuan
is allowed to move 0.5 percent either side of the fixing.  In  Hong Kong ’s offshore market, the yuan rose 0.14 percent
to 6.3225 and declined 0.3 percent this week. Twelve-month non-
deliverable forwards gained 0.27 percent to 6.3218, almost the
same as the onshore spot rate, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The contracts fell 0.4 percent this week.  One-month implied volatility for the yuan, a measure of
exchange-rate swings used to price options, climbed to 2.55
percent, the highest level in two months.  Claims for jobless benefits in the U.S. dropped last week
to match a four-year low, while U.S. consumer confidence rose to
the highest since 2008, reports showed yesterday. China’s
 exports  increased 18.4 percent in February from a year earlier,
the most in six months, official data showed on March 10.  To contact the reporter on this story:
