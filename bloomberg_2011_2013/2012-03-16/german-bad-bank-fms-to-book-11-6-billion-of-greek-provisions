FMS Wertmanagement, the German bad
bank winding down assets from  Hypo Real Estate Holding AG (HRX) , will
book 8.9 billion euros ($11.6 billion) of risk provisions on
Greek securities after this month’s debt swap agreement.  That includes provisions of 7.9 billion euros on securities
and loans and 1 billion euros for derivatives, Christian Bluhm,
the board member responsible for credit risks at state-owned FMS
Wertmanagement, told reporters in Munich yesterday.  FMS’s participation in the Greek debt swap agreement forced
the Munich-based bad bank to unwind interest-rate and inflation
swap derivatives on its Greek securities at a loss as the swaps
were bought by Hypo Real Estate when rates were higher, Bluhm
said. That leaves the book value of FMS’s Greek portfolio at
about 2.2 billion euros, he said.  FMS was mandated in October 2010 to wind down about 176
billion euros of Hypo Real Estate assets over 10 years. Hypo
Real Estate transferred the assets to the bad bank as part of a
government bailout after the collapse of Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc. prevented the Munich-based property lender from
raising finance.  FMS plans to publish detailed figures for 2011 in May.  To contact the reporter on this story:
