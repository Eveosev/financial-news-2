The Securities Commission of
Zimbabwe said it is concerned that a proposed $55 million
recapitalization plan by  RioZim Ltd. (RIOTZ)  doesn’t provide sufficient
information for shareholders to make their own assessment.  “There is need for disclosure on RioZim’s entire debt
maturity profile so that investors and shareholders can make
their own assessment on which debt might need early
retirement,” Tafadzwa Chinhamo, the regulator’s chief executive
officer, said in a statement published in the Harare-based
Newsday newspaper. Without that transparency, it’s possible that
all the money will be “channelled straight towards debt
retirement, thus leaving the company with no working capital, a
position which led to the current situation.”  “It’s not a big issue,” Josh Sachikonye, RioZim’s
managing director, said in a phone interview from Harare.
“We’ve met with the commission and we’re resolving that.”  A plan by the Harare-based gold and diamond miner to raise
$40 million in Feb. 2011 through a rights offer failed. RioZim
blamed  Zimbabwe ’s black empowerment laws, which require
companies to be majority-owned by black Zimbabweans, for scaring
investors. Subsequent newspaper reports said the miner had debts
of between $40 million and $59 million.  RioZim is due to hold an extraordinary general meeting next
week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
