CarVal Investors LLC, a  money
manager  owned by Cargill Inc., hired David Chene from  Credit
Suisse Group AG (CSGN)  and Tom Bauwens from  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  as
managing directors in its European corporate distressed-debt
business in London.  Chene and Bauwens will report to John Brice, president and
chief investment officer of CarVal, which oversees more than $9
billion of credit and real estate investments, the Minneapolis-

at Goldman’s European special situations group, according to
CarVal.  CarVal was founded by Cargill in 1987 to focus on
proprietary and high-yield debt trading.  To contact the reporter on this story:
