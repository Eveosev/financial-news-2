Nomura Holdings Inc. (8604)  hired Bill Tsang, formerly of  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) , as head of investment
products in Asia outside Japan in the bank’s wealth management
division, according to Jonathan Williams, Nomura’s Singapore-
based spokesman.  Hong Kong-based Tsang was hired for the newly-created role
on Feb. 1, Williams said by telephone today. Tsang reports to
Singapore-based Koki Miura, head of wealth management and retail
for the same region, Williams said.  Tsang was previously Deutsche Bank’s Hong Kong-based head
of investment advisory for North Asia, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Amy Chang, a Hong Kong-based spokeswoman for the German
lender, didn’t respond to a telephone message and e-mail seeking
comment on his departure.  Tsang was not available when contacted by phone today for
comment on his new and previous positions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
