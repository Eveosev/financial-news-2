Russian Energy Minister Sergei
Shmatko proposed extending cross subsidies in the power sector
to 2016 or 2017 to avoid sharp increases in tariffs for
households,  Vedomosti  reported today, citing a presentation to
the State Duma, the lower chamber of parliament.  The so-called last mile cross subsidies, by which
industrial customers connected to  Federal Grid Co. (FEES)  also pay
distributor  OAO MRSK Holding (MRKH) , which rents some of its grids,
were to be eliminated in 2014, the newspaper said. They had
previously been prolonged from 2011, according to the report.  Keeping the measure to 2017 may result in large industrial
customers paying an extra 300 billion rubles ($10 billion) for
power transmission, the newspaper said, citing Mikhail Rasstrigin, a utilities analyst at VTB Capital in Moscow. MRSK
Holding said it lost out on more than 10 billion rubles last
year when some industrial customers refused to work under the
last-mile system, the newspaper reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
