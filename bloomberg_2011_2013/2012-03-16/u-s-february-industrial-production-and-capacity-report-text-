Following is the text of the U.S.
 Industrial Production  and Capacity Utilization report for
February:  Industrial production was unchanged in February after
having risen 0.4 percent in January.  Previously, industrial
production was reported to have been unchanged in January.
Manufacturing output moved up 0.3 percent in February.  Within
manufacturing, the index for motor vehicles and parts fell 1.1
percent after jumping 8.6 percent in January, but the index for
manufacturing excluding motor vehicles and parts increased 0.4
percent in February. Production at mines fell 1.2 percent, while
the output of utilities was unchanged.  At 96.2 percent of its
2007 average, total industrial production for February was 4.0
percent above its year-earlier level.  Capacity utilization for
total industry edged down to 78.7 percent, a rate 1.2 percentage
points above its level from a year earlier but 1.6 percentage
points below its long-run (1972-2011) average.  Market Groups  The production of  consumer goods  was unchanged in February.
The index for durable consumer goods decreased 0.5 percent, as
declines in the output of automotive products and of appliances,
furniture, and carpeting were only partly offset by gains in the
production of both home electronics and miscellaneous goods. The
production of nondurable consumer goods edged up 0.1 percent.
The index for consumer energy products rose 0.6 percent, with
small gains in both fuels and residential utilities.  The output
of non-energy nondurable consumer goods was steady, as a step-up
for foods and tobacco was offset by lower output for clothing,
chemical products, and paper products.  In February, the production of business equipment rose 0.6
percent and was 10.8 percent above its year-earlier level. The
index for information processing equipment moved up 1.0 percent
last month for its third consecutive gain of 1 percent or more.
The production of transit equipment increased 0.9 percent; over
the 12 months ending in February, this index advanced 24.4
percent, with large gains in the output of trucks, civilian
aircraft, railroad rolling stock, and miscellaneous
transportation equipment. The output of industrial and other
equipment increased 0.2 percent in February, its seventh
consecutive monthly rise.  The index for defense and space equipment advanced 1.1
percent in February following a gain of 0.8 percent in January.  The production of construction supplies rose 1.1 percent in
February.  This index has advanced 7.5 percent over the past 12
months but nevertheless remained more than 20 percent below its
level preceding the recession. The index for business supplies
moved up 0.2 percent in February after a similarly sized gain in
January.  The output of materials to be further processed in the
industrial sector moved down 0.3 percent in February. The index
for durable materials was up 0.5 percent after having advanced 1
percent or more in each of the three previous months. Among the
major categories of durable materials, both equipment parts and
other durable materials rose in February, but consumer parts
fell.  The production of nondurable materials decreased 0.3
percent, with losses in chemical materials partly offset by
increases for both textile and paper materials. The output index
for energy materials fell 0.9 percent, its third consecutive
monthly decline.  Industry Groups  Manufacturing output increased 0.3 percent in February to a
level that was 5.1 percent higher than a year earlier.
Production rose 1.1 percent in January, 0.4 percentage point
more than reported previously; higher output of food,
transportation equipment, and primary metals contributed
importantly to the revision. The factory operating rate moved up
0.1 percentage point in February to 77.4 percent, a rate 13.0
percentage points above its trough in June 2009 but still 1.5
percentage points below its long-run average.  Within manufacturing, the output of durable goods increased
0.4 percent in February and was 8.5 percent above its year-
earlier level. Output gains of more than 1 percent were recorded
in February for nonmetallic mineral products; fabricated metal
products; aerospace and miscellaneous transportation equipment;
and electrical equipment, appliances, and components.
Production declined in February for primary metals, machinery,
and motor vehicles and parts; each of these indexes had risen
briskly in January.  The production of nondurable goods edged up 0.1 percent in
February. Among the major components of nondurables, the indexes
for petroleum and coal products and for plastics and rubber
products posted the largest increases. Production also rose for
food, beverage, and tobacco products; textile and product mills;
and paper.  The only major indexes that posted declines were for
apparel and leather and for chemicals. The index for other
manufacturing (non-NAICS), which consists of publishing and
logging, moved down 0.3 percent.  Mining production decreased 1.2 percent in February, as the
extraction of natural gas declined for a second consecutive
month and coal production fell. Capacity utilization in mining
decreased to 90.5 percent but was still 3.1 percentage points
above its long-run average.  The output of utilities was
unchanged, in part as temperatures in February stayed mild
following an unseasonably warm January. The operating rate for
utilities in February decreased to 74.3 percent, a rate 12.1
percentage points below its long-run average.  Capacity utilization rates in February at industries
grouped by stage of process were as follows:  At the  crude
stage, utilization declined 1.0 percentage point to 89.1
percent, a rate 2.7 percentage points above  its long-run
average; at the primary and semifinished stages, utilization
increased 0.2 percentage point to 75.2 percent, a rate 5.9
percentage points below its long-run average; and at the
finished stage, utilization was steady at 78.4 percent, a rate
1.1 percentage points above its long-run average.  Notice
Revision of Industrial Production and Capacity Utilization  The Federal Reserve Board plans to issue its annual
revision to the index of industrial production (IP) and the
related measures of capacity utilization at noon EDT on March
30, 2012.  The revised IP indexes will incorporate detailed data
from the 2010 Annual Survey of Manufactures, conducted by the
U.S. Census Bureau. Annual data from the  U.S. Geological Survey 
regarding metallic and nonmetallic minerals (except fuels) for
2010 will also be incorporated. The update will include
revisions to the monthly indicator (either product data or input
data) and to seasonal factors for each industry.  In addition,
the estimation methods for some series may be changed. Any
modifications to the methods for estimating the output of an
industry will affect the index from 1972 to the present.  Capacity and capacity utilization will be revised to
incorporate data through the fourth quarter of 2011 from the
Census Bureau’s Quarterly Survey of Plant Capacity, which covers
manufacturing, along with new data on capacity from the U.S.
Geological Survey, the  Department of Energy , and other
organizations.  Once the revision is published, it will be available on the
Board’s website at
 www.federalreserve.gov/releases/G17. Further information on the
revision can be obtained from the Board’s Industrial Output
Section (telephone number 202-452-3197)  References and Release Dates
