Swiss stocks  advanced for an eighth
day, extending a nine-month high for the benchmark Swiss Market
Index, as  Transocean Ltd. (RIG)  climbed with  oil prices  and financial
companies rallied.  Transocean, the world’s largest operator of offshore
drilling rigs, advanced the most since October. Swiss Life
Holding AG, Switzerland’s biggest life insurer, increased 3.1
percent, following a gauge of insurers higher.  Temenos (TEMN)  Group AG
gained 3.2 percent after Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said it sees
the company as a “strategic asset.”  The SMI rose 0.1 percent to 6,341.33 at the close in
Zurich, the highest since June 6. The gauge pared a gain of as
much as 0.4 percent as the Thomson Reuters/University of
Michigan index of U.S. consumer confidence unexpectedly dropped.
The broader Swiss Performance Index added 0.2 percent today.  “The decline of the Michigan sentiment disappoints,”
Viola Stork, an analyst at Helaba Landesbank Hessen-Thueringen
in  Frankfurt , wrote in e-mailed comments. “However, the
consumer sentiment is still at a high level. U.S. households are
obviously impressed by the higher energy prices.”  The preliminary index of consumer sentiment fell to 74.3 in
March, the lowest this year, from 75.3 the prior month. The
gauge was projected to rise to 76, according to the median
forecast of 70 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.  Weekly Gain  The  SMI (SMI)  has climbed 2.5 percent this week, the most since
December, and  rallied 6.8 percent  this year after the  European
Central Bank  disbursed more than 1 trillion euros ($1.3
trillion) to the region’s lenders. The number of shares changing
hands on the SMI today was 141 percent higher than the 30-day
average, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Transocean gained 4.9 percent to 53.90 Swiss francs, its
largest increase since Oct. 21, as oil advanced for the first
time in three days in  New York . The company reported deepwater
dayrate contracts that exceeded analyst forecasts in a fleet
status report. Global Hunter Securities upgraded the shares to
buy from neutral.  Weatherford International Ltd. (WFT) , an oil-rig owner, advanced
6 percent to 15.85 francs and Petroplus Holdings AG rallied 15
percent to 77 centimes, the biggest gain since Feb. 2.  Swiss Life (SLHN)  increased 3.1 percent to 114.90 francs, an
almost eight-month high, as a gauge of insurers was among the
best performers of the 19 industry groups in the Stoxx Europe
600 Index.  Zurich Financial Services AG (ZURN) , Switzerland’s largest
insurer, rose 1.2 percent to 244.80 francs.  Temenos Rises  Temenos climbed 3.2 percent to 16.30 francs after Goldman
Sachs reinstated the banking-software maker with a neutral
rating, the equivalent to hold, and a price estimate of 19.50
francs. The brokerage said it continues to see Temenos as a
“strategic asset.”  Health-care companies limited gains in the SMI, with
 Novartis AG (NOVN)  and  Roche Holding AG (ROG)  dropping 0.5 percent to 50.15
francs and 0.3 percent to 159.8 francs, respectively.  The European Medicines Agency said it needs more time to
complete a safety review of Novartis’s multiple-sclerosis pill
Gilenya that followed reports of 11 deaths among patients taking
the drug. The regulator now expects to publish its findings on
April 19 or 20, a spokeswoman said.  Nobel Biocare AG, the second-biggest maker of dental
implants by sales, retreated 2.4 percent to 11.33 francs.  Ascom Holding AG, a maker of communications systems for
hospitals and trains, lost 5.5 percent to 8.55 francs after
Stefan Gaechter, an analyst at Helvea AG, cut the stock to
neutral from buy. Gaechter also reduced his price estimate for
the company’s shares by 33 percent to 11 francs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
