Turkish  yields  fell for a second
day after central bank Governor Erdem Basci stressed the bank’s
priority is inflation, not growth.  Yields on the benchmark two-year debt declined five basis
points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 9.32 percent at the close
in Istanbul, paring this week’s gain to 14 basis points, the
biggest increase since Feb. 10. The lira was little changed at
1.7974 per dollar.  The Ankara-based bank expects inflation rate to start
retreating in April and fall “markedly” in May as the bank
focuses on inflation targets and  price stability , Governor Erdem Basci told businessmen in the southern city of Adana today. The
bank doesn’t have a growth target, he said. Turkish  inflation 
slowed for the first time in five months in February, after
accelerating to a three-year high and almost double the official
target of 5.5 percent in 2011.  “The market takes this clear determination from the bank
on reducing inflation positively,” Selim Gulkan, a fixed-income
trader at  Turk Ekonomi Bankasi AS (TEBNK)  said, by telephone. The
government has a 5 percent inflation target for this year.
Inflation in February was 10.4 percent.  Turkish capacity utilization fell to 72.9 percent in
February from 74.7 percent in the previous month, the central
bank said on its website Feb. 23.  The country’s unemployment rate fell to 9.8 percent in
December from 11.4 percent a year earlier, the statistics office
in Ankara said March 15. It rose from 9.1 percent in November.  To contact the reporter on this story:
