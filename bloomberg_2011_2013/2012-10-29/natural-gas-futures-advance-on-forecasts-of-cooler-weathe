Natural gas futures gained in New
York for the first time in four days on forecasts of colder-
than-normal weather that may increase demand for the heating
fuel.  Gas gained as much as 2.7 percent after Commodity Weather
Group LLC in Bethesda,  Maryland , predicted below-normal
temperatures in parts of the eastern U.S. through Nov. 7.
Heating demand in the Northeast may be 7 percent above normal
from Nov. 4 through Nov. 8, according to Weather Derivatives.
Nymex floor trading is shut today because of  Hurricane Sandy .  “Mother Nature and the possibility of a cold winter is all
this market has to go on,” said  Phil Flynn , senior market
analyst at Price Futures Group in  Chicago . “We could see some
upward momentum as the November contract expires today.”  Natural gas for November delivery rose 8.6 cents, or 2.5
percent, to $3.486 per million British thermal units at 1:26
p.m. on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . The futures are up 17
percent this year.  The November contract expires today. The more actively-
traded December contract was 11.3 cents higher, or 3 percent, at
$3.837 per million Btu.  Gas volume on the exchange was 193,611 contracts at 2:02
p.m. The three-month average volume is 393,000.  January $5 calls were the most active options on the
exchange, trading 0.5 cent higher at 1.8 cents on volume of 905
lots at 1:40 p.m.  The low in  New York  on Nov. 7 may be 41 degrees Fahrenheit
(5 Celsius), 3 below normal, according to  AccuWeather Inc.  in
 State College ,  Pennsylvania . The low in  Boston  may be 35
degrees, 5 less than the usual reading.  Winter Outlook  About 50 percent of U.S. households use gas for heating,
according to the Energy Department.  The coming U.S. winter will probably be cooler than a year
ago, boosting demand for heating fuels such as natural gas, a
panel of forecasters said.  While December will be warmer than normal, temperatures
will drop through February, increasing natural gas use by 13
percent over the same period from last year, Commodity Weather
Group LLC President  Matt Rogers  said during a panel discussion
at Earth Networks Inc.’s seventh annual energy weather seminar
in New York Oct. 18.  The U.S. winter, measured by meteorologists from Dec. 1 to
Feb. 28, may be 21 percent cooler than last year in terms of
natural gas-weighted heating degree days, Rogers said.  Raymond James  Financial Inc. raised its 2012 U.S. natural
gas price forecast by 7.2 percent, citing tighter supply and
higher demand going into winter.  Price Forecast  Raymond James bolstered its view for the average gas price
at the Henry Hub in Erath,  Louisiana , to $2.82 per thousand
cubic feet ($2.75 per million Btu) from $2.63, J. Marshall Adkins, an analyst at the company in Houston, said in a note to
clients today. The  Henry Hub  is the delivery point for gas
futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange.  Gas is projected to average $3.75 in 2013, up 15 percent
from the previous forecast of $3.25, according to the note.
“Our gas model shows that, if the weather is anywhere near
normal, supply-demand should tighten sharply this winter before
loosening up next summer,” Adkins said.       Net-long bets  on
four natural gas contracts rose for a fourth week, increasing
3.9 percent to 176,754 in the week ended Oct. 23, according to
Commodity Futures Trading Commission data released Oct. 26. The
gain left bullish wagers at the highest levels since Aug. 7.  The measure includes an index of four contracts adjusted to
futures equivalents: Nymex natural gas futures, Nymex Henry Hub
Swaps, Nymex Henry Hub Penultimate Swaps and ICE Henry Hub
Swaps.  Hurricane Sandy  Hurricane Sandy may result in widespread power failures
along the East Coast, cutting gas consumption, Price Futures
Group’s Flynn said. Sandy was about 260 miles (415 kilometers)
southeast of  New York City  as of 11 a.m. local time with maximum
sustained winds of 90 miles per hour, according to the National
Hurricane Center.  Gas inventories totaled 3.843 trillion cubic feet in the
week ended Oct. 19, 7 percent above the five-year average. The
 surplus  to the average is down from 61 percent on March 30.
Stockpiles may reach 3.903 trillion by Oct. 31, below estimated
capacity of 4.239 trillion, Energy Department data show.  The boom in oil and natural gas production helped the U.S.
cut its reliance on imported fuel. America met 83 percent of its
energy needs in the first six months of the year, department
data show. If the trend goes on through 2012, it will be the
highest level of self-sufficiency since 1991.  To contact the reporter on this story:
