The leu rallied for a sixth day
against the euro, its longest winning streak in six months, as
 Romania ’s central bank extended a policy of lower funding for
lenders.  The currency appreciated 0.2 percent to 4.5479 per euro by
5 p.m. in Bucharest, the highest since Oct. 3. Today’s advance
expands gains over the past week to 0.6 percent, the best among
central and eastern European currencies tracked by Bloomberg.
Yields on 2018 euro-denominated bonds traded little changed at
4.34 percent.  The central bank tightened a cap on lending to commercial
banks to 4 billion lei ($1.1 billion) today, compared with 6
billion lei on Oct. 8 in its weekly auction of repurchase
agreements. A similar measure helped the leu strengthen 2.5
percent in August.  “The leu receives support from the central bank and we
expect it to continue to use this policy as long as the currency
is threatened by further weakening,” Dan Bucsa, a London-based
economist at  Unicredit SpA (UCG) , wrote in a note to clients today.
“The amount tendered today” reflects the central bank’s
perception of “the strength of depreciation pressure” on the
leu, Bucsa said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
