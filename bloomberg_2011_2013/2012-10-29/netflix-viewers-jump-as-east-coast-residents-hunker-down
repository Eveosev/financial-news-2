Netflix Inc. (NFLX)  said the number of
viewers on its service jumped today as East Coast residents
hunkered down in preparation for the arrival of  Hurricane Sandy ,
the Atlantic’s Ocean’s biggest-ever tropical storm.  Online viewing rose 20 percent today from the same day a
week ago, driven by increased streaming in New York, Washington,
Boston, Philadelphia and Baltimore, spokesman Joris Evers said
today in an e-mail.  “Initially, we saw a lot of kids’ titles being watched, a
sign that kids are staying home from school,” Evers said.  Authorities have closed government offices in several
states, airports and mass transit systems have been shut and
residents have been warned to stay at home. U.S. stock markets
are closed today and tomorrow because of the storm.  Netflix shares, which were not traded today, climbed 13
percent to $69.58 on Oct. 26.  To contact the reporter on this story:
