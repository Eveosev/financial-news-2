Richard Ackroyd, chief executive of
Scottish Water Ltd., the fourth-largest water company in the
U.K., has died, the utility said.  Ackroyd had headed publicly-owned Scottish Water, which
provides about 1.3 billion liters of drinking water a day and
disposes of 840 million liters of wastewater daily, for almost
five years, according to the company’s website.  Ackroyd, a former executive at Yorkshire Water, is survived
by his wife and two sons, Scottish Water said without
elaborating. Scottish Water’s executive leadership and chairman
Ronnie Mercer will take over his role with immediate effect, the
company said today in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
