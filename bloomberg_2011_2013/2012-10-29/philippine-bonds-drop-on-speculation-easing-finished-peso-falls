Philippine bonds declined on
speculation the central bank, which cut its benchmark  interest
rate  four times in 2012 to support growth, will refrain from
further reductions this year.  Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas last lowered its  overnight rate 
to 3.5 percent from 3.75 percent on Oct. 25. That is less than
the annual  inflation  rate of 3.6 percent in September. The peso
has rallied 1.1 percent against the dollar this month and
fluctuated between gains and losses after Moody’s Investors
Service upgraded the nation’s debt rating today to the highest
level since the start of 2004.  “I would say the easing cycle is over for this year,”
said Jackit Wong, a regional economist in  Hong Kong  at Natixis
Asia Ltd. “The latest cut was a pre-emptive move to address
external economic concerns and to curb gains in the peso.”  The yield on the 8 percent bonds due July 2031 rose one
basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 5.66 percent from Oct.
25, according to Tradition Financial Services.  The government had a budget deficit of 34.9 billion pesos
($845 million) last month, compared with a surplus 2.5 billion
pesos in August, official data showed Oct. 24. The trade deficit
widened to $1.26 billion in August from $236 million in July,
the government reported Oct. 25.  Moody’s Upgrade  Moody’s raised the country foreign and local currency long-
term bond ratings by one step to Ba1 from Ba2, or one level
below investment grade. The outlook is stable. That put the
ranking on par with the assessment at  Standard & Poor’s .  “We have been expecting an upgrade this year or early next
year as economic growth has been strong,” said Jetro Siekkinen,
an emerging-market bond manager in Helsinki at Aktia Asset
Management, which oversees about $10 billion. “There are short-
term risks because of weak export demand, therefore an
investment grade may not come sooner than late next year.”  The Philippine economy has shown “economic strength and
fiscal resilience” in the face of a global slowdown, Moody’s
said in a statement today. It’s poised to record faster growth,
lower inflation, exchange rate appreciation and an increase in
foreign exchange reserves, it said.  The peso weakened 0.1 percent to 41.263 per dollar, data
from Tullett Prebon Plc show. The currency traded between gains
and losses after the Moody’s announcement. It reached 41.120 on
Oct. 18, the strongest level since March 2008.  One-month implied volatility, a measure of exchange-rate
swings used to price options, was steady at 4.85 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
