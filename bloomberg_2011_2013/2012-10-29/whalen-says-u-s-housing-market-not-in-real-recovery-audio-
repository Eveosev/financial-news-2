Chris Whalen, senior managing 
director at Tangent Capital Partners LLC, says a shrinking pool 
of potential homebuyers, the difficulty of getting 
non-conforming mortgage loans, and a tougher regulatory 
environment are all working against a real housing recovery. 
Whalen talks with Bloomberg's  Kathleen Hays  on October 26 on 
 Bloomberg Radio 's "The Hays Advantage."  (Source: Bloomberg)  Running time 18:52
