Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4) , Latin
America’s largest company by market value, is in talks to sell
assets in Africa as it seeks to spend $236 billion over five
years while developing crude reserves off the shore of Brazil.  Talks are being held to sell “some” African assets,
either fully or to form joint ventures in which Petrobras, as
the oil producer is known, would not have to be the operator,
Chief Financial Officer Almir Barbassa told reporters in  Rio de
Janeiro .  Petrobras aims to generate $14.8 billion from the sale and
restructuring of assets as it seeks to focus on the development
of the so-called pre-salt oil reserves under the Atlantic Ocean
seabed, according to its 2012-2016 business plan presented in
June. The company said Sept. 17 it would seek to sell  oil fields 
in the  Gulf of Mexico  for $8 billion next year.  Petrobras’s assets in Africa include the Egina and Ajoi
fields in Nigeria, stakes in off-shore blocks in Angola, in
which oil has been discovered, and an exploration in Namibia,
 according  to the company’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
