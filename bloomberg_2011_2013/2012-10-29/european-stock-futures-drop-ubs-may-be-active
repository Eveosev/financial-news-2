European (SXXP)  stocks dropped, snapping a
three-day advance, as  Hurricane Sandy  headed toward  New York 
City, prompting the U.S. to suspend equity trading on all
markets today.  A gauge of insurance companies posted the biggest decline

a portfolio manager at Schroder Investment Management Ltd. in
 London , said in a Bloomberg Television interview. “I think it’s
the right thing to do just because we don’t know how bad Sandy
could be when it arrives. You just have to be a bit more careful
about pricing because liquidity is going to be down.”  The Stoxx 600 retreated 1.3 percent last week as companies
in Europe and the U.S. reported disappointing results. The
volume of shares changing hands in companies listed on the Stoxx
600 today was 36 percent lower than the average of the last 30
days, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Hurricane Sandy  The Securities and Exchange Commission may suspend equity
