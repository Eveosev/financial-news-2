Cia. Siderurgica Nacional SA (CSNA3) , the
third-largest Brazilian steelmaker by output, sees demand
gaining speed in 2013 as the government readies Rio de Janeiro
to host the soccer  World Cup  in 2014 and the  Olympic Games  in
2016.  Demand for steel used in the construction sector will grow
at about 8 percent in 2013, compared with growth of 5.5 percent
this year, Luis Martinez, the company’s executive director for
steel sales, said in an interview in Santiago today.  “We are very optimistic about the growth of this market in
Brazil,” Martinez said. “We have lots of space to grow.”  President  Dilma Rousseff ’s economic team predicted that
economic growth in South America’s largest economy grew at the
fastest pace in more than two years in the third quarter, at an
annualized rate of between 5 percent and 6 percent, a government
official said in October.  As part of the government’s initiative to ready the country
to host the sporting events, new homes in Brazil will use steel
in their construction instead of brick-and-mortar, Martinez
said.  Demand growth for steel used in cars will grow about 4
percent this year and may expand next year as middle-class
families purchase their first vehicle in 2013, Martinez said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
