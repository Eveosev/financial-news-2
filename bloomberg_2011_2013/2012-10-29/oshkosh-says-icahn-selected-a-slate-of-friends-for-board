Oshkosh Corp. (OSK)  said billionaire
activist investor  Carl Icahn  selected “a slate of friends” for
nomination to its board of directors.  The truckmaker based in the Wisconsin city of the same name
confirmed today in a statement that it received Icahn’s
nominees. It said 12 of the 13 nominees are employees or
affiliates of Icahn-controlled entities or repeat nominees from
his previous proxy fights.  “Shareholders should be aware that Mr. Icahn selected a
slate of friends, employees and affiliates so that they are
focused on serving only one agenda -- Carl Icahn’s,” the
company said today in the statement.  Oshkosh’s board last week rejected Icahn’s bid to buy the
company for about $3 billion, or $32.50 a share. Icahn, the
company’s largest investor with a 9.5 percent stake, led an
unsuccessful proxy fight earlier this year. Oshkosh rose less
than 1 percent to $29.92 at the close on Oct. 26 in  New York .
U.S. stock trading was canceled today because of  Hurricane
Sandy .  Icahn has criticized Oshkosh’s executives for poor
performance. He has said he wants to spin off JLG Industries
Inc., which makes construction-lift equipment, because it is
more valuable as a separate entity. The unit was purchased by
Oshkosh about six years ago.  The nominees are Icahn himself, William Lasky, Jose Maria
Alapont, William Leidesdorf, Daniel Ninivaggi, Marc Gustafson,
James Cowan, James Nelson, Jack Wassserman, A.B. Krongard, Keith
Cozza, SungHwan Cho and Hunter Gary.  To contact the reporter on this story:
