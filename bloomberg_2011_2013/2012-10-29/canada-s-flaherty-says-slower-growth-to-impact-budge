Canadian Finance Minister  Jim Flaherty  said lower commodity prices are slowing growth in
revenue and will affect the government’s fiscal outlook.  Flaherty, in a statement released today in Ottawa, released
forecasts that lowered expected nominal gross domestic product
over the next five years, shaving an average of about C$25
billion in annual output through 2017.  “Canada has been affected by volatile and lower commodity
prices, which are dampening government revenue growth,” he told
reporters, after  he met  with private-sector economists. “This
will have an impact on the fiscal outlook.”  Flaherty’s March 29 fiscal plan, which forecast surpluses
beginning in 2015, projects the deficit for the fiscal year that
began in April will drop to C$21.1 billion ($21.1 billion) from
C$26.2 billion in the previous fiscal year.  Canada ’s government is committed to eliminating the deficit
in the “medium-term,” said Flaherty. He declined to say
whether the government still planned to balance the budget in
2015 or quantify how slowing revenue growth will impact the
fiscal outlook. Canada will provide an update to its March
budget in “a few weeks,” he said.  “We know the revenues are off, they are not dramatically
but they are off a bit and we’ll have to adjust for that,”
Flaherty said. “They are not off enough that I need to worry
about the fiscal track.”  Lowered Forecast  Flaherty lowered  the forecast  for growth in nominal GDP to
3.4 percent in 2012 from 4.6 percent in his March fiscal plan,
and cut the 2013 outlook to 4.0 percent from 4.4 percent. The
average growth rate for nominal GDP in the 2012-16 period was
reduced to 4.2 percent from 4.4 percent. Nominal GDP is a better
predictor of the tax base and revenue because it includes
changes in prices.  The country’s economy grew by 5.9 percent in 2011 in
nominal terms. The slowdown in 2012 reflects in part falling
prices for the country’s commodities. The Bank of Canada
Commodity Average  Price Index  has averaged 641.71 this year, 4.5
percent lower than the 2011 average.  Real GDP, which measures volumes and excludes the impact of
falling commodity prices, will average 2.3 percent between 2012
and 2016, the same as the March budget.  Flaherty lowered his estimate for 2013 real GDP growth to 2
percent from 2.4 percent, while raising it over the next three
years.  Surplus Forecast  Earlier today,  Kevin Page , the country’s budget officer,
released a report that forecast the country will swing to  budget
surplus  in the fiscal year starting April 2015. The report also
said nominal output will average C$22 billion less per year than
it had forecast in April.  Economic growth should pick-up after 2013, allowing the
government to meet its plan to eliminate the deficit,  Craig Alexander , chief economist of Toronto Dominion Bank, told
reporters in Ottawa.  “While people might focus on the reduction in the outlook
for real GDP growth in 2013, it’s a very small downward
adjustment, and it’s offset by a stronger profile down the
course,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
