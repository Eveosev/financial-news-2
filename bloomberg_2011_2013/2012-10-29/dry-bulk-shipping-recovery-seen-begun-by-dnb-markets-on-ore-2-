Rates to ship dry-bulk raw materials
by sea are recovering after a four-year slump as Chinese demand
for  iron ore  surged to the highest level since 2009, according
to DNB Markets.  Average daily earnings for Capesizes, the largest ships
hauling the commodity used to make steel, will more than double
to $16,000 in 2013 from $6,705 so far this year, Nicolay Dyvik,
an Oslo-based analyst at DNB, said in an e-mail today. Chinese
demand for iron ore rose 41 percent in October from the previous
month to 95 billion ton-miles, the highest since August 2009,
the investment-banking unit of  Norway ’s largest bank estimated.  Capesize earnings more than doubled this month to $16,934 a
day, according to the  Baltic Exchange , the London-based
publisher of shipping costs. Rates are still 93 percent below
their 2008 peak of about $234,000 after owners ordered too many
ships before the recession. After years of unprofitability,
slower sailing speeds are restraining fleet growth as  China 
increases imports from Australia and  Brazil , according to DNB.  “Dry-bulk market recovery has begun,” Dyvik said in a
report e-mailed today. “Large expansion of low-cost iron-ore
and coal exports make us positive on the dry-bulk segment.”  Estimates Lowered  The recovery was delayed as returns trailed expectations
this year, and other analysts have said it has yet to arrive.
Analysts cut forecasts seven times from $15,000 a day at the
start of the year, according to the averages of 10 estimates in
a Bloomberg survey. The market consensus is that recent
increases were driven by stockpiling, rather than a fundamental
recovery, London-based shipbroker Galbraith’s Ltd. said in an
Oct. 19 report.  The dry-bulk fleet swelled 53 percent since the end of 2008
to a record 581 million deadweight tons, according to data from
IHS Inc., an Englewood, Colorado-based research company. Global
cargo demand will advance 5 percent this year and 4 percent in
2013, according to Clarkson Plc, the world’s largest shipbroker.  Capesizes account for about 40 percent of the fleet’s
capacity, according to figures from Clarkson Plc, the world’s
biggest shipbroker. They’re also the largest vessels tracked by
the  Baltic Dry Index (BDIY) , a broader measure of commodity shipping
costs, which slipped 0.1 percent to 1,048 today, according to
the exchange. It’s down 40 percent this year.  Vessel Speeds  Owners can save on fuel, their biggest expense, and reduce
the fleet’s effective capacity by slowing down ships. Capesizes
sailed at an average speed of 9.13 knots last month, compared
with 11.1 knots three years ago, according to ship-tracking data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Iron ore is the largest commodity traded at sea after crude
oil, and China is the biggest importer. Brazil increased its
share of shipments to China to 28 percent in October from 24
percent the month before, DNB estimates.  Australia ’s share grew
by 1 percentage point to 59 percent. Cargoes from other sources
shrank to 13 percent from 19 percent, Dyvik said in the report.  Ton-mile demand is determined by multiplying the size of a
cargo and the distance traveled for delivery.  Daily hire costs fell for the three classes of smaller
vessels in the index, according to the exchange. Panamaxes, the
largest ships to navigate the Panama Canal, dropped 0.6 percent
to $6,386 as Supramaxes that are about 25 percent smaller slid
0.7 percent to $7,250. Handysizes, the smallest vessels in the
index, retreated 0.6 percent to $6,361.  To contact the reporter on this story:
