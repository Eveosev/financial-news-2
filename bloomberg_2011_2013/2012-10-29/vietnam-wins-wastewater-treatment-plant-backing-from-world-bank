Vietnam  was awarded $50 million in
funds from the  World Bank  for wastewater treatment plant
improvements to help curb pollution at its industrial parks.  At least eight wastewater systems in industrial parks in
Nam Dinh, Ha Nam, Dong Nai and Ba Ria Vung Tau, four of the
country’s most industrialized provinces, will be constructed
with the funding.   Industrial parks discharge as much as 1 million cubic
meters of untreated sewage every day, about 70 percent of the
country’s total volume of industrial wastewater, according to
Vietnam’s natural resources and environment ministry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
