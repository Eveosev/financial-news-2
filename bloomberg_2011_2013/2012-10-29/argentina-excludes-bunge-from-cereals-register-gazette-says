Bunge Ltd. (BG) , Argentina’s second-
biggest exporter, was excluded from the Cereals Register by the
Argentine government amid a tax probe, the Official Gazette said
today, without elaborating.  Being excluded will postpone Bunge’s readmission later, a
tax agency official who asked not to be identified because of
the agency’s communications policy, said in a telephone
interview from Buenos Aires.  Bunge’s local subsidiary was suspended from the register
Oct. 1, forcing the company to pay a tax rate of 25 percent to
export grain, up from a previous 10 percent. Argentina’s tax
agency said then it was investigating Bunge because of unpaid
income taxes since 2006.  Susan Burns , a Bunge spokeswoman at company headquarters in
White Plains,  New York , didn’t reply to a call and an e-mail
seeking comment.  Argentina’s tax agency, known as AFIP, last year said that
four of the South American country’s 10 biggest exporters and
cereals and soybean processors underpaid taxes. Cereal-producing
companies use the register to expedite exporting and reduce
export taxes.  Argentina is the world’s largest exporter of soy oil, the
second-largest of corn and third of soybeans.  To contact the reporter on this story:
