Pattern Energy Group LP, a closely
held U.S. renewable-energy developer, has started producing
electricity at a wind farm in  Puerto Rico  and agreed to sell
more of its output to a local utility.  Pattern will sell power from 95 megawatts of installed
capacity to the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority, up from a
previous agreement for 75 megawatts, the San Francisco-based
company said today in a statement.  The Finca de Viento Santa Isabel project in the southern
municipality of Santa Isabel will consist of 44 2.3-megawatt
 Siemens AG (SIE)  turbines once itâ€™s fully built, according to the
statement.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
