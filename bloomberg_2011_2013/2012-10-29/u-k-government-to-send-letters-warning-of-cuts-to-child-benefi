The U.K. government will send out
letters to parents next month setting out details of its plans
to cut or eliminate  child-benefit payments  for parents earning
more than 50,000 pounds ($80,000) a year.  Under the move, which takes effect Jan. 7, families in
which one parent’s income is 60,000 pounds or more will lose all
their child benefit. Those earning between 50,000 and 60,000
pounds will see their benefits cut on a sliding scale.  About 1 million letters will be sent out to parents
 explaining the change , which is being applied as a charge on tax
bills, Her Majesty’s Revenue & Customs, the U.K. tax agency,
said in an e-mailed statement today. It said those affected will
need to decide whether to keep receiving child benefit and pay
the tax charge, or to stop claiming the benefit altogether.  In his March 21 budget statement, Chancellor of the
Exchequer  George Osborne  bowed to public and political pressure
and revised an original proposal, under which any parent earning
enough to pay tax at the 40 percent income-tax rate -- currently
just over 42,000 pounds a year -- would have lost all of the
benefit.  The new arrangements were designed to go some way toward
addressing the anomaly whereby a family with a single income of
more than 42,476 pounds a year would lose child benefit while a
couple each with an income just below the top rate could
together earn more than 80,000 pounds and keep the benefit.  The cuts are part of efforts to narrow Britain’s fiscal
deficit. Child benefit is worth 1,056 pounds a year for the
first child and 697 pounds for each subsequent one.  To contact the reporter on this story:
