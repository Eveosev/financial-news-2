Sojitz Corp. (2768) , Japan’s largest
importer of rare earth metals, said it will take part in a $125
million desalination project in Ghana with the Spanish company
 Abengoa SA (ABG) , the first of its type in sub-Saharan  Africa .  The Tokyo-based company said in a statement today that
construction on the project in Accra will begin next month with
commercial operations expected to start in 2014 on a plant to
supply as much as 60,000 cubic meters of water a day, sufficient
for 500,000 residents.  Desalinated water will be sold to Ghana Water Co. under a
25-year sales contract. Sojitz said it and Abengoa Water formed
a business alliance a year ago for joint development
desalination projects, mainly in Africa and the Americas.  About 4 million of  Ghana ’s 24 million populace live in
Accra and the surrounding area. Water demand “is scarcely met
by the supply in the region and 40 percent of the nation is
unable to secure safe water,” Sojitz said in the statement.
Cholera broke out in parts of Ghana in 2010 “and security of
safe water is a matter of great urgency,” it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
