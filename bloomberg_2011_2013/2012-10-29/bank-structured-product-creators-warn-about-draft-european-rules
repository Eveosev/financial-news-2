An industry body representing banks
that create structured products for individual investors said
draft regulation from the European Commission may leave
investors misinformed about the risk of the products.  The Joint Associations Committee on Retail Structured
Products, which counts banks including  Barclays Plc (BARC) , BNP Paribas
SA and  Citigroup Inc. (C)  among its members, published today a
response to the Commission’s July 3 proposals for “key
information documents.”. While the concise documents explaining
a product’s main characteristics and risks may be a useful
resource for investors, they should not be used in isolation,
the JAC said.  European regulators focused on structured products after
the 2008 collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., a big issuer
of the securities. Regulators are in particular focusing on the
quantity and quality of information provided to investors by
product creators and distributors.  “I am concerned by the idea that the KID should be a free-
standing document on which investment decisions can be solely
made,” said Tim Hailes, JAC chairman and associate general
counsel at  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  in  London . “You can’t invest
sensibly in these products based on just two pages.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
