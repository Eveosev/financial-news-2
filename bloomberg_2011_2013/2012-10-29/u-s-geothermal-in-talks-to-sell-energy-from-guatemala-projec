U.S. Geothermal Inc. is negotiating
a contract to sell energy from its El Ceibillo project in
Guatemala to one of Central Americaâ€™s largest power
distributors.  U.S. Geothermal is seeking to sell power to the
unidentified buyer for 15 years at rates competitive with
prevailing energy prices in the region, the Boise, Idaho-based
company said today in a statement.  The project, 8.5 miles (13.7 kilometers) southwest of
 Guatemala City , is expected to start producing power in late
2015, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
