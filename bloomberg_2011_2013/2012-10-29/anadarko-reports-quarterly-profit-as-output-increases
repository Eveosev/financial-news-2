Anadarko Petroleum Corp. (APC) , the
second-largest U.S. independent oil and natural-gas producer by
market value, reported a third-quarter profit as sales volumes
topped the company’s July forecast.  Net income was $121 million, or 24 cents a share, The
Woodlands, Texas-based company said in a statement today. That
compares with a net loss of $3.05 billion, or $6.12 a share, in
the year-earlier quarter because of costs from a Gulf of Mexico
oil spill.  Excluding losses from energy contracts and other one-time
items, per-share profit was 9 cents more than the 75-cent
 average  of 31 analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Third-
quarter sales volumes rose 12 percent from a year earlier to the
equivalent of 739,000 barrels of oil a day. On July 30, Anadarko
said it expected daily sales for the third quarter to be 707,000
to 728,000 barrels of oil equivalent.  Anadarko is tapping onshore U.S. formations, such as in
 Colorado  and  Texas , to help boost production of liquids
including oil. It’s also exploring in the  Gulf of Mexico  and off
the coast of  Africa .  The company boosted the midpoint of its full-year forecast
by 3 million barrels, with a new range of 265 million to 267
million barrels. Revenue climbed 4.2 percent from a year earlier
to $3.33 billion in the third quarter.  The quarter was helped by the company’s Wattenberg
horizontal program in Colorado and Eagle Ford Shale in Texas,
which accounted for an increase of more than 800,000 barrels of
liquids sales compared with the second quarter.  Production Shut  About 1 million barrels of oil equivalent of production was
shut in the Gulf of Mexico during the third quarter because of
downtime related to weather, Anadarko said today.  The company had a 25 percent stake in the BP Plc-operated
Macondo well in the Gulf, which in 2010 was the site of the
largest offshore  oil spill  in U.S. history. Last year, Anadarko
agreed to pay BP $4 billion to settle claims related to the
spill.  Gas futures traded in New York averaged $2.893 per million
British thermal units in the third quarter, a 29 percent decline
from a year earlier, amid a glut of the power-plant fuel. Brent
crude futures, a global benchmark, dropped 2.4 percent from a
year earlier to average $109.42 in the third quarter.  Anadarko fell 6 cents to $66.49 on Oct. 26. U.S. trading
was closed today because of  Hurricane Sandy . The shares have
fallen 13 percent this year.  ConocoPhillips (COP)  is the largest U.S. independent oil and gas
producer by market value. Independent  oil companies  don’t own
refineries or a chemical business.  (Anadarko is scheduled to hold an earnings conference call
tomorrow at 10 a.m. New York time. To listen, go to
