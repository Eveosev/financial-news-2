Chief executive officers in America
are finding fewer costs to cut, sending profit margins into the
first 12-month contraction since 2009 and leaving investors
increasingly dependent on economic growth to boost stocks.  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index companies earned $81.93 a share
in the last 12 months on sales of $919.39 a share, generating
margins of 8.9 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg
that excludes banks. The measure, a key gauge for investors,
slipped from 9.0 percent, the first decline after a three-year,
1.6 percentage point expansion, the biggest ever.  Bears say the contraction shows executives have squeezed
all they can from  expenses  and point out that stagnant
profitability accompanied recessions in 2000 and 2007. Bulls say
housing and employment data show the American economy is picking
up speed and that even if earnings contract, valuations are so
low that share prices will build on the 109 percent rally since
March 2009.  “Margins collapse when economies are weakening, which is
the last thing you want to see,” said  Russ Koesterich , the San
Francisco-based global chief investment strategist for the
IShares unit of BlackRock Inc., on Oct. 24. His firm oversees
$3.67 trillion. “That companies remain very profitable has
helped support stock prices. If that starts to diminish, it will
obviously take away a little bit of the luster.”  Weekly Decline  The S&P 500 fell 1.5 percent to 1,411.94 last week as
companies from Caterpillar Inc. to DuPont Co. said a slowdown in
sales will curb earnings growth and analysts cut their margin
forecasts. The benchmark gauge for American equities has
decreased 3.7 percent since reaching a five-year high on Sept.
14, trimming its 2012 advance to 12 percent. That’s about twice
the average  annual gain  since 1900, according to data compiled
by Credit Suisse Group AG in Zurich.  The U.S. securities industry canceled equity trading on all
markets today, moving to protect workers as Hurricane Sandy
barreled toward  New York City  with 70-mile-per-hour winds and
the threat of an 11-foot sea surge. Futures on the  S&P 500 
dropped 0.5 percent at 4:31 a.m. in  New York . Trading will stop
at 9:15 a.m. because of the storm, CME Group Inc. said.  Allegheny Technologies Inc. (ATI)  plunged 11 percent on Oct. 24
after the maker of specialty metals for aerospace and energy
markets reduced its 2012 forecast and said margins narrowed.
Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization
at the Pittsburgh-based company fell to 9.8 percent of sales
last quarter, from 12.3 percent a year earlier, Bloomberg data
show.  Earnings Record  Three years of economic growth pushed S&P 500 earnings to a
record, underpinning a rally that has added $8 trillion to
equity values over 44 months. Margins expanded as profits
climbed 52 percent from 2009 through the 12 months ended in
October, compared with a 26 percent rise in sales, data compiled
by Bloomberg show. For the last year, sales and earnings rose by
about the same amount, 5 percent, ending the gain in margins.  Profit margins in the  S&P 500 (SPX)  excluding financial firms
have averaged about 6 percent since 1993, according to Bloomberg
data. They rose 49 percent above that level to a record last
October as companies cut employees and took advantage of falling
interest rates, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
average length of margin contractions since 1993 has been 16
months, the data show.  ‘Difficult Time’  “The first half of next year is going to be a bit of a
struggle,” said David Joy, the Boston-based chief market
strategist at Ameriprise Financial Inc., which oversees $678
billion. He spoke in an Oct. 23 phone interview. “This is a
difficult time for corporate leadership to try and figure out:
what can we do to maintain the type of earning growth that we’ve
enjoyed? Unless something else happens, they won’t be able to.”  Slipping margins have contributed to lower  forecasts  for
profitability. Analysts say third-quarter income for S&P 500
companies probably rose 1.8 percent, down from an estimate of
9.3 percent at the start of the year. Predictions for the
current period have fallen by 10 percentage points since April.  Even if margins fail to rebound, shares are so  cheap 
relative to profits that they could keep rising, said Brian Jacobsen, who helps oversee $208 billion as chief strategist at
Wells Fargo Advantage Funds in  Menomonee Falls ,  Wisconsin , in an
Oct. 23 phone interview. S&P 500 companies are trading for 14.3
times earnings, more than 10 percent below the five-decade
average of 16.4, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Earnings Increase  Earnings for all U.S. companies with a market value of more
than $1 billion will probably advance to about $1.13 trillion in
2012, according to data and analyst estimates compiled by
Bloomberg. That compares with $784 billion in 2007.  “It seems like people are anticipating that profitability
has got to break down,” Jacobsen said. “Even if we have flat
 earnings  or even declining earnings, we could see sentiment
begin to improve, in which case that could lead to multiple
expansion and continue to drive the market higher.”  Estimates for earnings growth next year have held up even
as they have declined for U.S. economic growth. Gross domestic
product will expand by 2 percent in 2013, down from a prediction
of 3 percent in July 2011, according to the median estimate of
89 economists surveyed by Bloomberg. S&P 500 profits will
increase 10 percent next year, unchanged from the expectation 1
1/2 years ago, more than 9,000 analyst estimates compiled by
Bloomberg show.  GDP Gains  GDP, the value of all goods and services produced, rose at
a 2 percent annual rate in the third quarter after climbing 1.3
percent in the prior period, Commerce Department figures showed
Oct. 26. The median forecast of 86 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg called for a 1.8 percent gain.  Reports for last month showed the expansion is continuing
in the fourth quarter. U.S. manufacturing unexpectedly expanded
in September after three months of contraction and service
industries grew by the most in six months, data from the
 Institute for Supply Management  showed this month. Unemployment
dropped to 7.8 percent in September, the lowest since 2008.  Koesterich said stocks may be spared losses once the
presidential race between  Barack Obama  and  Mitt Romney  is
decided and Congress finds a way to avoid the so-called fiscal
cliff of tax increases and spending cuts set for January.  Earnings Season  For the 273 companies in the S&P 500 that have reported
quarterly results, earnings have declined by 0.4 percent. The
rate of growth is the smallest since the third quarter of 2009,
data compiled by Bloomberg show. Profit margins have averaged
10.3 percent, excluding banks.  Caterpillar, the Peoria, Illinois-based maker of  farm
equipment , posted the highest profit margin since at least 1980
last quarter at 9.2 percent. The company lowered its 2012 income
estimate on Oct. 22 and said sales growth will be slower than in
the previous three years as the global economy decelerates.  Joel Tiss, an analyst at BMO capital Markets in New York,
estimated  Caterpillar (CAT) ’s net income margin will fall to 8.2
percent from 9.4 percent in 2012, with profits shrinking 12
percent, according to an Oct. 22 note to clients.  DuPont’s (DD)  net profit margin may fall to 8.8 percent in 2012
from 9.6 percent last year, according to UBS AG. The Wilmington,
Delaware-based chemical maker tumbled 9.1 percent on Oct. 23
after posting a smaller-than-estimated profit and cutting its
forecast on declining demand for paint pigment and solar cells.  DuPont Margins  The share of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation
and amortization as a  percentage  revenue at DuPont climbed last
year to the highest since 2002, according to Bloomberg data.  Profitability bottomed at 4.44 percent in March 2002 and
staged a six-year recovery that peaked to 8.73 percent in
October 2008 as the S&P 500 almost doubled. The financial crisis
pushed margins down to 7.41 percent by December 2009 prompting
companies to eliminate jobs, hoard cash and sell assets,
Bloomberg data show.  “Global growth is just pretty slow right now,” said  David Kelly , the New York-based chief market strategist at JPMorgan
Funds, which oversees $348 billion. He spoke in an Oct. 23 phone
interview. “From that, you can predict that earnings will do
pretty poorly at this stage of the cycle.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
