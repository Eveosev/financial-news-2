Potato yields in the U.K. were
“significantly reduced” because of cool, wet weather this
summer, and farmers unable to meet production contracts may need
to buy on the open market, the National Farmers Union said.  Potato prices have “reached unprecedented levels for this
time of year,” as demand outstrips production, the Stoneleigh,
England-based NFU said today in a  statement  on its website.
Soggy weather also increased farmers’ production costs and
boosted disease pressure. About 70 percent of potatoes in
England and  Wales  are grown on fixed contracts, the NFU said.  “I have already heard of some buyers taking a pragmatic
approach because they recognize that the shortages have largely
been out of the growers’ control,” NFU potato forum Chairman
Tim Papworth said in the statement. “I can’t remember a year
quite like this. Our members have been working exceptionally
hard to try and meet their customers’ requirements.”  June, July and August were the wettest in the U.K. since
1912, according to the Met Office.  To contact the reporter on this story:
