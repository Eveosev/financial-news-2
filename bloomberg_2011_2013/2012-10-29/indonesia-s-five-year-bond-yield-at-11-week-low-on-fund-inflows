Indonesia ’s government bonds rose,
pushing the yield on five-year securities to an 11-week low,
after global funds increased their debt holdings by the most
since January. The rupiah weakened.  Overseas investors added 4.52 trillion rupiah ($470
million) to their  portfolio  of local notes this month through
Oct. 24, poised for the biggest inflow since January, Finance
Ministry data show. Indonesia plans to raise 500 billion rupiah
by offering Islamic bonds tomorrow, after a debt auction last
week drew bids for three times the amount offered. The yield on
10-year bonds was 5.73 percent, less than the central bank’s
record-low reference rate of 5.75 percent.  “Investors remain focused on seeking high and stable
yields at the moment,” said Billie Fuliangsahar, the head of
treasury at PT Bank Rabobank International Indonesia in Jakarta.
“The 10-year notes have the potential to rally further to yield
as low as 5.25 percent.”  The yield on the government’s 10 percent notes due July
2017 dropped four basis points from Oct. 25, or 0.04 percentage
point, to 5.41 percent as of 2:25 p.m. in Jakarta, the lowest
level since Aug. 9, prices from the Inter Dealer Market
Association show. Indonesian markets were closed on Oct. 26 for
a holiday.  The rupiah declined 0.2 percent to 9,621 per dollar, the
most since Oct. 16, prices from local banks compiled by
Bloomberg show. One-month implied volatility, which measures
exchange-rate swings used to price options, held at 6.25
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
