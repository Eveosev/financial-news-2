Chevron Corp. (CVX) ’s Indonesian unit, the
nation’s largest producer of crude, started a $500 million
expansion of the project at Duri field in Sumatra.  At peak production, the site at North Duri Development Area
13 is forecast to add 17,000 barrels a day to production, PT
 Chevron Pacific Indonesia  said in an e-mailed statement today. A
Chevron spokesman in  Singapore  confirmed the news.  The North Duri 13 project will add 539 new wells, including
145 using a technology known as steam injection to increase
production yields, the company said. Steam flooding involves
injecting steam into wells to ease the flow of heavy oil.  The project follows an expansion in Area 12 that was
completed in 2009, adding 40,000 barrels a day to production, it
said. The Duri field is one of the world’s largest steam-flood
projects.  Chevron Pacific may produce 343,212 barrels of oil a day
this year, about 39 percent of  Indonesia ’s total output,
according to data from the nation’s oil and gas regulator,
BPMigas.  Indonesia is trying to stem production decline as older
fields pump less crude. The nation withdrew from the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries in 2008 amid
falling output.  To contact the reporter on this story:
