The European Union imposed five-year
tariffs on aluminum radiators from China to help Italian and
Polish producers compete with cheaper imports.  The duties as high as 61.4 percent punish Chinese exporters
such as Zhejiang Guangying Machinery Co. for selling the
radiators in the EU below cost, a practice known as  dumping .  European manufacturers including  Italy ’s Fondital SpA and
 Poland ’s  Armatura Krakow SA (ARM)  have suffered “material injury” as
a result of dumped imports from China, the 27-nation EU said
today in Luxembourg. The five-year levies follow provisional
measures introduced in May and will take effect after
publication in the  Official Journal  by Nov. 11.  Chinese exporters expanded their combined share of the EU
market for aluminum radiators to 24 percent in the 12 months
through June 2011 from 13 percent in 2008, according to the
bloc. Other European manufacturers include Italy’s Global Srl
and  Radiatori 2000 SpA , the EU said in May.  The duties are the outcome of an inquiry that the EU opened
in August 2011 after a dumping complaint against  China  by an
industry group on behalf of producers that account for more than
25 percent of the bloc’s output of aluminum radiators. Like the
provisional measures, the five-year levies range from 12.6
percent to 61.4 percent, depending on the Chinese company.  Zhejiang Guangying Machinery faces a 21.2 percent levy,
unchanged from the provisional rate. Two other Chinese
exporters, Sira (Tianjin) Aluminium Products Co. and Sira Group
(Tianjin) Heating Radiators Co., each face a duty of 14.9
percent, down from a provisional rate of 21.2 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
