Natural gas futures declined for a
fourth consecutive day on concern that Hurricane Sandy could cut
consumption.  Gas for November delivery fell 2.4 cents, or 0.7 percent,
to $3.376 per million British thermal units in electronic
trading on the  New York  Mercantile Exchange at 8:35 a.m. London
time. The contract lost 3.4 cents, or 1 percent, on Oct. 26 to
settle at $3.400 per million Btu, capping its first weekly drop
since September.  The November contract expires today. The more active
December future was at $3.375 per million Btu, down 2.5 cents.  Sandy,  currently  off the coast of North Carolina, is
expected to come ashore late today in southern New Jersey,
according to the National Hurricane Center.  The storm will bring heavy rain and high winds, “which
could knock out large areas of electricity,”  Gene McGillian , an
analyst and broker at Tradition Energy in  Stamford ,  Connecticut ,
said in an Oct. 26 note to clients. Power producers account for
about 36 percent of U.S. gas consumption, according to the
Energy Department.  Heating demand in the U.S. will be 14 percent above normal
in the week from Oct. 27 to Nov. 2, according to a forecast from
Weather Derivatives LLC. The south-central region may see
heating usage double during the period, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
