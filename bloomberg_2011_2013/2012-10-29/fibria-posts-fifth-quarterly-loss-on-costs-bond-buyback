Fibria Celulose SA (FIBR3) , the world’s
largest pulp producer, reported a fifth straight quarterly loss
amid higher costs and expenses related to a bond buyback.  The third-quarter net loss narrowed to 214.6 million reais
($105.9 million) from 1.11 billion reais a year ago, Sao Paulo-
based Fibria said today in a statement. That compares with the
54.8 million-real average estimate of six analysts in a
Bloomberg survey.  The company posted a net loss because of “the impacts of
the one-off expense of financial charges on the 2020 senior
notes tender offer and the dollar’s appreciation against the
real,” according to the statement. Shares rose for the first
time in eight days, gaining 0.5 percent to 17.78 reais at 11:55
a.m. in  Sao Paulo .  Fibria announced a buyback of about $500 million of bonds
in June in a bid to cut debt. Net debt dropped 10 percent to
8.56 billion reais.  Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization of 573 million reais surpassed the 569.3 million
reais expected by analysts. The cash cost of producing pulp, the
raw material used to make paper, rose 2.1 percent to 491 reais a
ton on chemical costs and after maintenance stoppages at two of
its plants.  Free  cash flow , or what is left after covering operating
expenses and  capital spending , was positive at 157 million
reais, from a negative 126 million reais a year ago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
