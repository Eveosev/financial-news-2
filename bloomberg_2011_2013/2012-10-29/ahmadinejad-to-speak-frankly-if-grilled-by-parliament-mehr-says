Iranian President  Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 
has indicated that he will speak his mind if he is forced to
appear before the parliament for questioning, the state-run Mehr
news agency reported.  In a meeting last week between several lawmakers and the
president, Ahmadinejad said he considered the possible
questioning session “an opportunity to tell the unsaid,”
Hossein Ali-Haji, one of the lawmakers, told  Mehr  in the report
published today.  If Ahmadinejad is summoned, he “will put forth new issues
in the country’s political atmosphere, the deputies will respond
and this won’t be in line with the mood of consensus and
cooperation” that Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei seeks,
Ali-Haji said.  Lawmakers have been gathering signatures toward a motion
that could see Ahmadinejad summoned to answer questions about
turmoil in  Iran ’s currency market amid pressure from
international sanctions. The president has in recent months
exchanged diatribes with political rivals including Iran’s
parliamentary speaker and the judiciary head.  Iran is holding a presidential election in June and
Ahmadinejad, who’s completing his second term, isn’t eligible to
run.  To contact the reporter on this story:
