Gold declined for the second
straight session as a stronger dollar reduced demand for the
precious metal as an alternative investment.  The dollar gained as much as 0.3 percent against a basket
of currencies amid growing concern that Europe’s three-year-old
debt crisis is weighing on the economy. Last week, the dollar
rose 0.6 percent, while gold retreated 0.7 percent.  “It’s the dollar that’s pushing gold lower,”  Lance Roberts , the chief executive officer of Streettalk Advisors LLC
in Houston, said in a telephone interview.  Gold futures for December delivery fell 0.2 percent to
settle at $1,708.70 an ounce at 1:45 p.m. on the Comex in New
York. The price has slipped 3.7 percent this month.  CME Group Inc., the owner of Comex, said the New York
trading floor was closed today as  Hurricane Sandy  headed toward
the city.  Silver futures for December delivery dropped 0.9 percent to
$31.745 an ounce on the Comex.  Platinum futures for January delivery declined 0.8 percent
to $1,533.90 an ounce on the  New York Mercantile Exchange .  Palladium futures for December delivery fell 0.9 percent to
$589.75 an ounce on the Nymex.  To contact the reporter on this story:
