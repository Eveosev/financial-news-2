Czech, Slovak and Hungarian day-
ahead power contracts jumped as prices advanced in  Germany ,
 Europe ’s biggest market.  Next-day power in the three  coupled markets  settled 22
percent higher at 57.96 euros ($74.82) a megawatt-hour in a
daily auction, according to the countries’ market operators.
German day-ahead electricity gained amid unplanned plant halts.  Day-ahead power  in  Poland  dropped 1.5 percent to 186.42
zloty ($58) a megawatt-hour, according to exchange data compiled
by Bloomberg. Poland is set to export more electricity to Sweden
tomorrow, data from grid manager PSE Operator SA show.  A 225-megawatt unit at  GDF Suez SA’s (GSZ)  Polaniec power plant
in southern Poland was set to halt tomorrow, the data showed.
 PGE SA (PGE) , the country’s largest utility, planned to start a unit
with the equivalent capacity, according to the data.  In Germany, EON AG had an unplanned halt at its 875-
megawatt Heyden coal-fed power plant and  RWE AG (RWE)  halted its
1,050-megawatt Neurath-F lignite-fed plant. Both units are
scheduled to start on Nov. 1, the companies’ websites show.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
