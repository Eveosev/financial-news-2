E-Star Alternativ Nyrt. (ESTAR) , a Hungarian
energy supplier, rose the most in six weeks after saying it will
use payments from the state to help buy back overdue bonds.  The shares jumped 14 percent to 375 forint at 11:54 a.m. in
Budapest, the biggest advance since Sept. 17 and paring its
decline this year to 91 percent.  E-Star’s ESCO unit received funds from the State Treasury
for projects in two Hungarian counties. ESCO will lend 190
million forints ($862,000) of the funds to the group to help buy
back bonds which expired on Oct. 24, E-Star said in a  statement 
to the Budapest Stock Exchange on Oct. 27.  E-Star “intends to settle its liabilities against
creditors and credit institutions” from the funds and
receivables due to be credited in the future, it said in the
statement.  The company will delay the repurchase of bonds maturing in
2014 and later because of lack of funds, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
