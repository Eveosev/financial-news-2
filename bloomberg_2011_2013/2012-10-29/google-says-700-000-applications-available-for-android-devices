Google Inc. (GOOG)  said there are about
700,000 applications available for downloading onto mobile
devices that run the Android operating system, challenging  Apple
Inc. (AAPL) â€™s lead in the race for software tools.  That means Google has matched Apple in the number of games,
productivity tools and other programs that are usable on
handheld electronics, including tablets and smartphones. Apple
said last week that its  App Store  has more than 700,000 apps.  By luring software developers to its Android platform,
Google is attempting to eliminate a key selling point Apple has
used for the iPhone and iPad. Applications have become a
battleground as the two companies look for an edge in the $219.1
billion smartphone market, akin to how  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)  dominated
the personal-computer business by getting other companies to
write programs for its Windows operating system.  The rivalry extends beyond smartphones. Google today
unveiled a tablet with a 10-inch screen and costing $399 to
rival the iPad. The two companies also have introduced tablets
with smaller screens.  In the race for software developers, Apple has argued that
its iOS operating system leads to more sales. Apple said last
week that it has paid $6.5 billion to developers since the App
Store was introduced in 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
