Harvard University  and other Ivy
League colleges will accept early applications for the 2013-2014
school year beyond the Nov. 1 deadline because of possible
disruptions caused by  Hurricane Sandy .  Yale, Columbia and Cornell universities along with
Dartmouth College extended their deadlines to Nov. 5, the
 University of Pennsylvania  to Nov. 6, and  Brown University  to
Nov. 7, according to their websites. Harvard and Princeton
University gave no specific deadline for delayed applications,
telling applicants to cite the reason for lateness in a note to
the school.  Under such admissions programs, colleges let students apply
and receive decisions before regular deadlines. Applicants
typically must choose  one school  for early admissions. In some
cases, they commit to attending; in others, they may later apply
to other schools during the regular process. The eight Ivy
League colleges are all located in the northeastern U.S., which
is being battered by the 1,100-mile-wide hurricane that has shut
schools, government offices and U.S. stock markets.  “Damaging winds will affect a large portion of the
northeast as Sandy’s wind field stretches hundreds of miles,
making prolonged power outages likely,” Jessica Rennells, a
climatologist with the  Northeast Regional Climate Center  at
 Cornell University , said today in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
