A123 Systems Inc. (AONE) , the bankrupt
maker of electric-car batteries, asked a judge to approve a
$50 million loan from Wanxiang America Corp., replacing  Johnson
Controls Inc. (JCI)  as the lender for its Chapter 11 case.  A123 at a Nov. 5 hearing will seek approval of the
financing from Wanxiang, which loaned the company $22.5 million
before it entered bankruptcy Oct. 16, according to papers filed
yesterday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Wilmington,  Delaware .  Johnson Controls received interim court approval Oct. 18 to
lend A123 $15.5 million of a total $72.5 million loan. The
Milwaukee-based auto-parts maker, which has agreed to buy A123â€™s
automotive business for about $125 million, said it withdrew as
the lender to avoid a fight over the financing.  A123 wants other bids due by Nov. 16, followed by an
auction Nov. 19 and a hearing to approve the sale Nov. 26.  A123, based in Waltham,  Massachusetts , listed assets of
$459.8 million and liabilities totaling $376 million. Debt
includes $143.8 million on 3.75 percent convertible subordinated
notes.  A123 had revenue of $159.2 million in 2011 and $39.6
million so far this year. Net losses were $257.8 million in 2011
and $269 million this year through August.  The case is In re A123 Systems Inc., 12-12859, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington).  To contact the reporters on this story:
