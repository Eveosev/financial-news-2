The U.K. government is on course to
save 8 billion pounds ($13 billion) in the current financial
year as a result of efficiency improvements and better financial
controls, Cabinet Office Minister Francis Maude said.  Initial results showed government departments have made
savings of 3.1 billion pounds so far in the year that started in
April, Maude said after a meeting with financial analysts today.  “We have said we want to be saving 20 billion pounds a
year by 2015 and savings of this magnitude cannot come by
trimming budgets here and there,” Maude said in an e-mailed
statement. “That’s why we are working to transform Whitehall
into a leaner, more efficient machine that manages its finances
like the best-run businesses,” he said in a reference to the
U.K. civil service.  The latest savings build on 5.5 billion pounds in the year
that ended in March and 3.75 billion pounds in the previous 12
months, the Cabinet Office said. The biggest portion of this
year’s savings -- 900 million pounds -- came from salaries by
reducing the size of the civil service.  To contact the reporter on this story:
