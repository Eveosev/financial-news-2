HTC Corp. (2498) , Asia’s second-largest
smartphone maker, fell to the lowest level in almost seven years
in Taipei trading after forecasting sales that missed analysts’
estimates and predicting its narrowest operating margin.  HTC dropped 7 percent, the daily limit, to NT$219.50 as of
10 a.m., headed for the lowest closing level since Dec. 15,
2005. The decline widened HTC’s stock-price loss to 56 percent
 this year , after a 42 percent drop in 2011.  Revenue this quarter will be about NT$60 billion ($2.1
billion), the Taoyuan, Taiwan-based company said Oct. 26 after
the market’s close, less than the NT$74.6 billion average of 24
analyst  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg. Operating margin will
be about 1 percent, HTC said. Provisions for old inventory,
spending on marketing, and the introduction of new devices late
in the quarter prompted the lower forecasts, the company said.  “We think it will be a challenge for HTC to turn around,”
Laura Chen, a Taipei-based analyst at BNP Paribas SA, wrote in a
note today. “We think HTC’s weak economies of scale and
difficulty in product differentiation make the company’s
recovery outlook look more remote.”  Chen cut her  stock-price estimate  by 55 percent to NT$100.  HTC’s third-quarter smartphone shipments fell 43 percent
from a year earlier, the most among the top five vendors, even
as the market climbed 45 percent, according to  IDC Corp.   “While contribution from  China  rose to over 40% in 3Q12,
it was not enough to offset weakness in U.S. and  Europe ,”
according to Richard Ko and James Lin, Taipei-based analysts at
KGI Securities Co. “Apple and Samsung are still way head in
terms of brand, marketing and distribution channel.”  The revenue forecast would be HTC’s lowest revenue since
the first quarter of 2010, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Among 35  analysts  tracked by Bloomberg, 25 have the
equivalent of a sell rating on HTC, eight recommend holding the
shares, while two advise investors to buy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
