Suzlon Energy Ltd. (SUEL) ,  India ’s largest
wind turbine maker, submitted a proposal for restructuring about
$2.8 billion of debt, offering to repay the money over a decade
after defaulting on a bond payment this month.  Suzlon, based in the western Indian city of Pune, put
forward a restructuring proposal that will involve a moratorium
on term-debt and interest payments for two years, the company
said in an e-mailed statement. It suspended guidance for the
current fiscal year due to liquidity constraints, volatile
market conditions and problems financing its debt.  “This is an important step toward stabilizing our business
by enhancing liquidity and injecting additional working
capital,” Chief Financial Officer Kirti Vagadia said in the
statement. “We believe this will help us to safeguard the
interests of our key stakeholders.”  Suzlon, which has posted losses for three years, is under
pressure to raise cash. Earlier this month, the company
defaulted on $209 million of debt, the biggest on convertible
bonds by an Indian company. A lack of working capital
constrained its ability to complete orders in the quarter that
ended June 30, Vagadia said in August after the company reported
its second-biggest quarterly loss since at least 2007.  Suzlon shares have declined 59 percent in the past year. It
has accumulated $2.8 billion in debt, including $965 million in
revolving facilities, from acquisitions made before a global
supply glut depressed turbine prices by 23 percent from their
peak in 2009, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
