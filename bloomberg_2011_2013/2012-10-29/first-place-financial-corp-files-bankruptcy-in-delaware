First Place Financial Corp., the
holding company for First Place Bank, filed for Chapter 11
bankruptcy in  Delaware  listing assets of $175.3 million.  The company, which listed debts of $64.5 million in
documents filed yesterday with the  U.S. Bankruptcy Court  in
Wilmington, indicated it has an agreement to sell assets to
Talmer Bancorp Inc.  Asset sales in bankruptcy are typically subject to higher
and better offers at a court-supervised auction.  Dimensional Fund Advisers LP was listed in court papers as
the only entity holding more than 5 percent of the Warren, Ohio-
based companyâ€™s voting shares and the largest unsecured
creditors were company trusts holding subordinated debt.  The case is In re First Place Financial Corp., 12-12961,
U.S. Bankruptcy Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington).  To contact the reporters on this story:
