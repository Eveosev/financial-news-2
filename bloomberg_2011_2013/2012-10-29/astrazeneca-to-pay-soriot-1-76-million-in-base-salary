AstraZeneca Plc (AZN)  said it will pay
Chief Executive Officer Pascal Soriot 1.1 million pounds ($1.76
million) a year in base salary, more than larger U.K. rival
 GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK)  gave its CEO last year.  Soriot, who began his tenure as CEO on Oct. 1, may also be
awarded 69,108 shares at 2,894 pence each, subject to a four-
year performance period and a subsequent four-year holding
period, the company said in a statement today. His bonus target
for the year is 100 percent of his salary, AstraZeneca said.  Soriot joined the London-based drugmaker as it searches for
licensing deals, partnerships and acquisitions of late-stage
assets to replenish the pipeline and boost sales. He suspended
the company’s share buyback program on his first day on the job
as AstraZeneca reviews its strategy.  Glaxo, the U.K.’s biggest drugmaker, paid CEO  Andrew Witty 
a base salary of 1 million pounds last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
