The U.S. Supreme Court left intact a
$61.7 million verdict won by  Dow Chemical Co. (DOW)  in a patent fight
with Nova Chemicals Corp. over the plastic used in grocery bags.  The justices today rejected an appeal by two Nova units
found to have infringed patents held by Dow, the largest U.S.
chemical company. The patents cover polymers that are thinner
and stronger than conventional plastic.  Nova, owned by Abu Dhabi-based International Petroleum
Investment Co., argued unsuccessfully that Dow had transferred
the patents to a holding company and no longer had the legal
right to enforce them.  The award has grown with interest, and Dow has said it will
seek additional damages for infringement in later years and in
 Canada .  A federal jury in Wilmington,  Delaware , sided with Dow in
2010, and the federal appeals court that handles patent cases
upheld the verdict. Dow is based in Midland,  Michigan .  The case is Nova v. Dow, 12-243.  To contact the reporter on this story:
