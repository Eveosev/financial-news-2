Czech  interest rates  below those of
the euro region have failed to revive lending, suggesting the
central bank may need to pursue an alternative strategy to lift
the economy out of recession.  The CHART OF THE DAY shows Czech loan growth slowed even as
policy makers cut the benchmark two-week rate to a record low
0.25 percent. The Ceska Narodni Banka will hold rates at its
next policy meeting on Nov. 1, according to 15 of 20 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg. The  European Central Bank ’s benchmark
rate is 0.75 percent.  “The Czech economy desperately needs monetary easing and
since interest rates are already close to zero, it’s clear that
the central bank needs to use other instruments,” said  Lars
Christensen , chief emerging-market analyst at Danske Bank A/S in
Copenhagen. “The most obvious and simplest way to ease monetary
policy in the present situation would be to use the foreign-
exchange channel.”  The Czech economy, which has contracted for three straight
quarters, is suffering from weak domestic demand after the
government cut investments and raised taxes to reduce the  budget
deficit . The central bank’s board agreed to weaken the koruna
should it need to ease policy beyond what another rate cut would
achieve, Governor Miroslav Singer said on Sept. 27.  Czech export growth in the second quarter was the slowest
since the end of 2009. Sales abroad account for three-quarters
of gross domestic product, with 80 percent of exports going the
European Union.  To contact the reporters on this story:
