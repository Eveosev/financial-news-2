The  New York  Yankees exercised 2013
contract options for second baseman  Robinson Cano  and outfielder
 Curtis Granderson , both of whom were All-Stars this past season
and then struggled in the playoffs.  The options on the contracts are worth $15 million each,
according to  MLB.com .  Cano and Granderson both recorded career highs in home runs
this year before fading in the postseason as the Yankees were
swept by the  Detroit Tigers  in the American League Championship
Series.  Cano hit .075 in the playoffs, with three hits in 40 at-
bats, while Granderson batted .100, going 3-for-30 with 16
strikeouts.  Cano, 30, hit .313 with 33 home runs and 94 runs batted in
for the Yankees during the regular season and was selected to
his fourth All-Star Game. Cano has had at least 150 hits in each
of his first eight Major League Baseball seasons, the longest
such streak for a second baseman since Ryne Sandberg of the
 Chicago Cubs  did it for 10 straight years starting in 1983.  Granderson, 31, made his third All-Star team in 2012,
batting .232 with a team-leading 43 homers, 102 runs scored and
106 RBIs. He also set a franchise record with 195 strikeouts,
surpassing the mark of 169 he set in 2011.  Grandersonâ€™s 84 homers over the past two seasons are the
most in the majors.  To contact the reporter on this story:
