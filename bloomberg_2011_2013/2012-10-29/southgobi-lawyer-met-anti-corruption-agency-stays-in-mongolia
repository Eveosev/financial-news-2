SouthGobi Resources Ltd. (SGQ) , controlled
by a unit of  Rio Tinto (RIO)  Group, said its legal counsel who was
barred from leaving  Mongolia  last week had met with the
country’s anti-corruption agency to assist an investigation.  Sarah Armstrong, a Hong Kong-based Australian, met the
Independent Authority Against Corruption on Oct. 26 and remains
in Mongolia, Vancouver-based SouthGobi said today in an e-mailed
statement. SouthGobi continues to “fully cooperate” with the
investigation, it said.  SouthGobi, controlled by Rio Tinto’s 51 percent owned unit
 Turquoise Hill Resources Ltd. (TRQ) , said in an Oct. 23 statement that
none of its employees have been charged with any crimes. The
company said May 8 that Mongolia’s anti-corruption agency had
asked one of its units for information for an investigation into
a third party.  Armstrong “is free to move around and take part in leisure
activities and can visit friends, work colleagues and the
office,” SouthGobi said today, without saying when Armstrong
will be allowed to leave Mongolia.  SouthGobi gained 0.2 percent to HK$16.70 at the close of
 Hong Kong  trading.  To contact the reporter on this story:
