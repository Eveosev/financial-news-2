South Korea’s won strengthened to a
13-month high on speculation exporters sold dollars to convert
their overseas earnings as the month-end nears.  Government bonds 
were little changed.  Government reports due this week are forecast to show
industrial production increased in September by the most in
three months, while exports shrank 0.5 percent in October from a
year earlier after a 2 percent contraction the previous month,
according to separate Bloomberg surveys. The  Bank of Japan (8301)  meets
tomorrow after unexpectedly expanding its asset-purchase fund on
Sept. 19.  “It was a slow trading day, and the won’s gains were
pushed mostly by South Korean exporters selling the greenback to
convert currency ahead of Japan’s central bank meeting,” said
Jude Noh, a Seoul-based chief currency trader at Suhyup Bank.
Japanese “policy makers may announce further monetary
stimulus,” which will strengthen the won further, he said.  The won climbed 0.1 percent to 1,095.90 per dollar at the
close in  Seoul , according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
currency touched 1,094.50 earlier, the strongest level since
Sept. 14, 2011. One-month implied volatility for the won, a
measure of exchange-rate swings used to price options, fell 18
basis points, or 0.18 percentage point, to 5.72 percent.  South Korean exporters are facing difficulties because of
the won’s gains, President  Lee Myung Bak  said today, according
to the transcript of a speech broadcast on radio. Manufacturers’
confidence fell for the second straight month, a central bank
report showed. An index measuring expectations for November fell
to 70 from 72 in October, the  Bank of Korea  said in a statement
in Seoul. Any number below 100 indicates that pessimists
outnumber optimists.  The yield on the government’s 2.75 percent bonds due
September 2017 was steady at 2.86 percent, Korea Exchange Inc.
prices show. The one-year interest-rate swap was little changed
at 2.74 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
