Chinese stocks  fell, dragging the
benchmark index to a one-month low, as weaker earnings from
companies including  Yanzhou Coal Mining Co. (600188)  outweighed better-
than-estimated figures from  China Petroleum & Chemical Corp. (600028)   Yanzhou Coal, China’s fourth-largest miner of the fuel,
lost 1 percent after posting a loss in the three months to Sept.
30.  Weichai Power Co. (000338) , a maker of high-speed heavy-duty  diesel
engines , sank 2.1 percent after profit decreased. China
Petroleum, Asia’s biggest oil refiner and also known as Sinopec,
added 1.1 percent.  “Earnings are the focus of the market now and investors
give premiums to companies whose profits can exceed
expectations,” said  Li Jun , a strategist at Central China
Securities Co. in Shanghai. “There will be little movement on
the index as there are few catalysts for buying stocks.”  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  fell 0.4 percent to 2,058.94
at the close, its lowest level since Sept. 27. About six stocks
dropped for every five that rose on the gauge. The  CSI 300 Index (SHSZ300) 
slid 0.5 percent to 2,235.85. The  Hang Seng China Enterprises
Index (HSCEI)  of Chinese companies traded in Hong Kong added 0.7
percent. The  Bloomberg China-US 55 Index (CH55BN) , the measure of the
most-traded U.S.-listed Chinese companies, fell 1.8 percent in
New York on Oct. 26.  About 24 percent fewer shares of Shanghai Composite
companies changed hands today compared with the 30-day average,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. U.S. equity markets
will close today as Hurricane Sandy approaches New York City,
the Securities and Exchange Commission said in a statement.  Quarterly Earnings  Yanzhou Coal lost 1 percent to 17.53 yuan. The coal
producer posted a net loss of 79.6 million yuan ($12.7 million)
in the third quarter, it said in a filing to the  Hong Kong  stock
exchange on Oct. 26. The loss compared with a profit of 1.08
billion yuan a year earlier.  Weichai Power slumped 2.1 percent to 19.46 yuan after
profit dropped 53 percent from a year earlier in the third
quarter.  The Shanghai Composite sank 2.9 percent last week, its
first drop in four weeks, as companies including  Maanshan Iron &
Steel Co. (600808)  and ZTE Corp. reported losses. The index trades at 9.7
times estimated earnings for 2012, compared with the 17.8
average multiple since Bloomberg began compiling the weekly  data 
in 2006. The Shanghai gauge has lost 6.4 percent this year.  Sinopec Profit  Sinopec added 1.1 percent to 6.24 yuan. Third-quarter net
income fell 9.4 percent to 18.3 billion  yuan , the company said
yesterday in a statement. That beat the 14.19 billion-yuan
median estimate of nine analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Net income for industrial companies rose 7.8 percent from a
year earlier to 464.3 billion yuan last month, the National
Bureau of Statistics said. That compared with a 6.2 percent
decline in August, the year’s largest drop.  China is studying a differentiated tax system on stock
dividends based on the length of shareholding, the China
Securities Journal reported today, citing unidentified people.  For shares held over 12 months, the tax rate may be
“significantly” reduced and the differentiated tax is aimed at
encouraging long-term investments, according to the report.  Some 505 companies in the Shanghai Composite have reported
third-quarter earnings with an average drop of 1 percent from a
year earlier, according to  data  compiled by Bloomberg. Publicly
traded companies are required to release results by the end of
the month.  Bubble Peak  Five years after global equities peaked, valuations in
 developing countries  have tumbled the most even as their

41 percent for Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average, 38 percent for
the Stoxx Europe 600 Index and 27 percent in the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index.  China-focused equity funds received $913 million of inflows
for the week ended Oct. 24, the most since July 2008, Cambridge,
Massachusetts-based data provider EPFR Global said in an e-mail
Oct. 26.  Thirty-day  volatility  in the Shanghai Composite was at 17.2
today, matching this year’s average. About 5.4 billion shares
changed hands in the gauge, 29 percent lower than the daily
average in 2012.  --Zhang Shidong. Editors: Richard Frost, Ravil Shirodkar  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
