The San Francisco Giants’ World
Series-clinching win over the  Detroit  Tigers on Fox drew viewers
in 5 percent more major-market homes than the equivalent Game 4
of last year’s Major League Baseball championship.  Last night’s game at Comerica Park in Detroit, a 10-inning,
4-3 Giants’ win that completed a four-game sweep for San
Francisco’s second World Series title in three years, was seen
in 10.6 percent of U.S. homes in the top 56 television markets,
Eddie Motl, a spokesman for the  News Corp. (NWSA)  network, said in an
e-mail. That’s 5 percent higher than the 10.1 rating for Game 4
between the St. Louis Cardinals and Texas Rangers last year.  The first possible series-clincher last year was Game 6,
which drew a 13.8 major-market rating, 3.2 percentage points
higher than last night’s game. In that contest, which went 11
innings, the Cardinals came within one strike of losing in two
different innings before eventually winning to force a decisive
seventh game.  Motl said he didn’t immediately have major-market ratings
for 2011’s Game 7. Preliminary national ratings will be
available later today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
