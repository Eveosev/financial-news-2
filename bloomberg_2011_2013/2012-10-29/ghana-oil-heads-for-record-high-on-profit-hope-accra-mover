Ghana Oil Company Ltd. (GOIL) , operator of
the West African nation’s second-biggest network of gasoline
stations, headed for the highest on record on speculation that
profit increased in the nine months through September.  The stock gained 1.7 percent to 60 pesewas as of 2:13 p.m.
in the capital, Accra. A close at this level would be the
highest since November 2007 when shares started trading on the
Ghana Stock Exchange.  “Speculative buying on the company’s nine-month results
pushed the price upwards,” Randy Mensah, a stock trader at
 Ecobank Development Corp. (ETI)  in Accra, said by phone today. “Our
expectation is a profit after tax growth of at least 15
percent.”  The company also introduced new products targeted at
meeting the energy needs of consumers “that we are sure will
increase revenue quite significantly,” Mensah said. The results
are expected by the first week of next month, he said.  Ofori Sarpong, finance manager of the company, wasn’t
available to immediately comment, said a woman who answered a
telephone call today and declined to be identified.  Net income increased 10 percent to 5.3 million cedis ($2.8
million) in the first half. Revenue increased to 407.1 million
cedis from 324.4 million cedis a year before.  To contact the reporter on this story:
