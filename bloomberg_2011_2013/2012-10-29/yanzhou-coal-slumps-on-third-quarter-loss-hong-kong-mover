Yanzhou Coal Mining Co. (1171) , the
country’s fourth biggest producer, fell the most in more than
seven weeks in Hong Kong trade after posting a quarterly loss.  The stock dropped as much as 8.8 percent to HK$11, and
traded down 6 percent at HK$11.34 at 11:11 a.m. local time,
taking its decline for the year to 31 percent. Today, it’s
heading for the biggest decline since Sept. 5.  The company posted a net loss of 79.6 million  yuan  ($12.7
million), compared with a 1.08 billion yuan profit a year
earlier, the Shandong-based company said in a filing on Oct. 26.
The average coal price received by the group fell 19 percent in
the quarter while operating costs rose to 13.03 billion yuan
from 10.69 billion yuan a year ago.  “The Australia coal mines hit Yanzhou Coal hard in the
quarter,” said  Helen Lau , a Hong Kong-based commodities analyst
at UOB Kay-Hian Ltd. “We expect to see only mild recovery in
coal prices in domestic and seaborne call prices.”  Yanzhou said in its earnings statement on Oct. 26 that
lower coal prices and higher costs were the reasons for the
quarterly loss. It didn’t provide any guidance for the current
quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
