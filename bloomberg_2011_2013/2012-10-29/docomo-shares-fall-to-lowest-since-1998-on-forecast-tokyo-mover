NTT DoCoMo Inc. (9437) , Japan’s largest
mobile-phone company, fell to the lowest level in 14 years in
Tokyo trading after cutting its annual profit forecast as
competitors lured customers with Apple Inc.’s iPhone 5.  DoCoMo dropped as much as 4.7 percent to 117,600 yen,
heading for lowest  since the stock began trading in 1998 , and
was at 118,100 yen as of 9:48 a.m. It was the biggest decline in
Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 Stock Average, which rose 0.2
percent. The company cut its  projection  for net income this
fiscal year by 9 percent to 507 billion yen ($6.4 billion) on
Oct. 26, and lowered its estimate for new subscribers to 2
million from 2.8 million.  The carrier, which doesn’t offer the iPhone, is increasing
sales promotions, President Kaoru Kato said last week. Tokyo-
based DoCoMo will also introduce 11 handsets next month that
work on a faster network, using Long Term Evolution technology,
to regain market share from smaller KDDI Corp. and  Softbank (9984) 
Corp., which began selling the iPhone 5 last month.  “DoCoMo needs to show how it’s going to revive profit in
the medium term,” Daisaku Masuno, an analyst at Nomura Holdings
Inc., said in a report dated Oct. 26, cutting his price estimate
for the stock by 8 percent to 121,000. “The sales promotion
burden is rising because of price cuts for LTE fees and Android
handsets.”  For the three months ended September, DoCoMo reported a 13
percent decline in net income to 121.6 billion yen as  revenue 
rose to 1.14 trillion yen from 1.07 trillion yen.  Additional promotional expenses for the year will probably
total 80 billion yen, Kato said Oct. 26.  Softbank, KDDI  DoCoMo’s rivals have turned to acquisitions as part of
their strategy to drive growth as they foresee the domestic
market slowing down. Softbank, the third-largest wireless
services provider, announced a $20 billion investment in U.S.’s
Sprint Nextel Corp. on Oct. 15. KDDI and Sumitomo Corp. offered
as much as 216 billion yen on Oct. 24 to buy out Jupiter
Telecommunications Co.,  Japan ’s biggest cable-TV operator.  Operating profit, or sales minus the cost of goods sold and
administrative expenses, will probably total 820 billion yen
this fiscal year, compared with an earlier projection of 900
billion yen, DoCoMo said last week. Annual revenue may total
4.52 trillion yen, an increase from the 4.45 trillion yen
forecast in July, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
