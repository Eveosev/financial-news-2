French Finance Minsiter  Pierre
Moscovici  said the government won’t be able to deliver an
immediate cut in labor costs because its deficit-cutting effort
is more important.  The company chiefs’ “main demand is for an immediate
reduction in the cost of labor,” Moscovici said today on Europe
1 radio. “I don’t think that’s possible because of the historic
effort we’re making on the deficit.”  President  Francois Hollande ’s work to restore French
competitiveness will take time, he said.  “It’s about the direction,” Moscovici said. “France’s
situation cannot be repaired in several months,” he said,
adding that the government is not seeking a confrontation with
company bosses but a dialogue.  To contact the reporter on this story:
