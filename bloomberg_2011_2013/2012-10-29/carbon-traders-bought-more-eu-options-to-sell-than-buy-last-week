Carbon traders bought more options
to sell December contracts than buy last week, even as the
European Union considers fixing a glut in supply.  Traders bought 8.35 million metric tons of options to sell,
with strike prices ranging from 6 euros ($7.75) a metric ton to
8 euros, according to data from ICE Futures  Europe  in  London .  They bought 6.95 million tons of options to buy, with
strikes ranging from 8 euros a ton to 10 euros, the data show.  EU carbon for December, the industry benchmark, slipped 1
percent last week as the bloc considers temporarily cutting the
volume sold at auctions beginning next year, as well as more
permanent rule adjustments to deal with the  glut. The contract
declined 4 cents to 7.85 euros a ton today at 9:58 a.m.  United Nations Certified Emission Reduction credits for
December advanced 1 cent to 87 euro cents a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
