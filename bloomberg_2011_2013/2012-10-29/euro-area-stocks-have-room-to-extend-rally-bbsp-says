The  Euro Stoxx 50 Index (SX5E)  will extend
its rally since the beginning of June if it crosses a resistance
that is less than 3 percent above last week’s close, according
to a technical analyst at BBSP Partners in Paris.  The benchmark gauge for the euro area must cross the range
between 2,550 and 2,563, levels which fall on a trend line
connecting the peaks of September and October with those of
early last year, Jean-Charles Gand, senior market strategist at
the technical-research firm, said in a telephone interview. The
market will get support at 2,400, which corresponds to a low
point reached in August, he said.  “In case of a significant drop below 2,400, BBSP would
expect an extension lower,” Gand said. “Our preferred scenario
still is for an increasing market however. We hope to break out
of the current trading range.”  The Euro Stoxx 50 has climbed 19 percent since its 2012 low
on June 1 as as European Central Bank President Mario Draghi
pledged to defend the euro and Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S.
Bernanke announced a third round of quantitative easing. The
gauge closed at 2,496.1 on Oct. 26.  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to predict changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
