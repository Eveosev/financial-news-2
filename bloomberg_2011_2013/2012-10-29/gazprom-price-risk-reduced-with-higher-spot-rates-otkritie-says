OAO Gazprom (OGZD) , Russia’s state-run
natural gas exporter, may have reduced the risk of further
contract renegotiations by cutting rates for most of its
European clients as spot prices rise, Otkritie Capital said.  Prices at European hubs rose on average 28 percent year-to-
date, analysts led by Alexander Burgansky, said in a research
note today. Otkritie has a buy recommendation on Gazprom stock.  The U.K.’s National Balancing Point prices approached $391
per 1,000 cubic meters last week, in line with those of
Gazprom’s long-term contracts, according to Otkritie. Rates at
the three main continental hubs in  Belgium ,  Germany  and the
Netherlands, were 3 percent to 5 percent below Gazprom’s prices,
Otkritie said.  Gazprom, which supplies about a quarter of Europe’s gas and
sticks to oil-indexed prices, has already renegotiated contracts
accounting for about 95 percent of its gas sales to the
continent, according to Otkritie. Gazprom reduced prices by 5
percent to 7 percent, while “price adjustments for certain
individual contracts were higher,” the bank said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
