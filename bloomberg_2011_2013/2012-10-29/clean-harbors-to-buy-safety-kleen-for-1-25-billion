Clean Harbors Inc. (CLH) , a provider of
hazardous-water disposal, agreed to acquire Safety-Kleen Inc.
for $1.25 billion to expand in used-oil recycling and re-
refining.  The cash transaction is expected to be completed by the end
of the year, Norwell, Massachusetts-based Clean Harbors said
today in a statement. The company said it has a financing
commitment from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and is considering
several other options that may include a combination of existing
cash, debt and equity.  Safety-Kleen filed in August for a $400 million initial
public offering underwritten by banks led by Credit Suisse Group
AG and Morgan Stanley. The Richardson, Texas-based company said
at the time it was  North America ’s largest re-refiner of used
oil, a business that accounted for about 44 percent of its
annual revenues.  Clean Harbors received legal advice on the transaction from
Davis, Malm & D’Agostine. Credit Suisse served as lead financial
adviser to Safety-Kleen, which was also advised by Morgan
Stanley and Houlihan Lokey. Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom
provided Safety-Kleen with legal advice.  (The companies scheduled a conference call at 9 a.m.  New
York  time to discuss the transaction, which can be accessed at
