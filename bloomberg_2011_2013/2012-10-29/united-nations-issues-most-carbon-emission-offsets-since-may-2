Supply of United Nations carbon
offsets, known as Certified Emission Reductions or CERs, grew by
the most in almost six months, UN data show.  The executive board of the UN’s Clean Development
Mechanism, the body responsible for regulating CERs, issued a
total of 4.7 million metric tons of credits today, according to
data on the UN  website . That’s the biggest daily volume since
May 2, when the regulator issued 6.3 million tons.  The CDM executive board is scheduled to approve  supply  of
more than 47 million tons of credits in November, the second-
highest monthly total since the UN mechanism began in 2005.  To contact the reporter on this story:
