Russia , the world’s biggest energy
exporter, will reduce  duties  on most oil shipments abroad by 3.4
percent from Nov. 1 after Urals crude prices fell.  The standard export duty will decline to $404.50 a metric
ton, or $55.18 a barrel, from $418.90 a ton in October,
according an order signed by Prime Minister  Dmitry Medvedev  and
published  today  on the website of Rossiyskaya Gazeta, the state
newspaper.  The government may propose changes to lower the  tax rate  by
the end of the first quarter next year to stimulate  output  after
President  Vladimir Putin  set a goal of producing more than 10
million barrels a day for at least a decade. Output climbed to a
post-Soviet high of 10.39 million barrels a day in September,
according to the Energy Ministry’s CDU-TEK unit. Oil and gas
provide about half of Russia’s budget revenue.  The discounted rate on some eastern Siberian and Caspian
Sea grades will fall to $199.40 a ton from $210.10 this month.
The levy on extra-heavy crude, set at 10 percent of the standard
duty, will be $40.40 in November.  Russia bases the export taxes on the average Urals blend
price from the 15th day of one month to the 14th of the next.
The benchmark export grade averaged $110.71 a barrel during the
most recent period,  Alexander Sakovich , a Finance Ministry
adviser, said Oct. 15 by phone. In the previous monitoring
period, it averaged $113.98, according to the ministry.  The duty for middle distillates, such as diesel, and heavy
products, such as  fuel oil , will drop to $267 a ton next month
from $276.40 in October. A gasoline tax, which was set at 90
percent of the crude oil duty since May 2011 to counter domestic
shortages, will decline to $364.10 a ton from $377 this month.  The government will raise the duty on liquefied petroleum
gases such as butane and propane to $192.40 a ton in November
from $172.50 this month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
