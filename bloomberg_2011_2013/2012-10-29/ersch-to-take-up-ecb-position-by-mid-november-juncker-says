Luxembourg’s Yves Mersch will join
the  European Central Bank ’s board by mid-November, unaffected by
European lawmakers’ objections, Luxembourg Prime Minister Jean- Claude Juncker said.  Mersch’s appointment has been held up by the European
Parliament, which last week issued its first-ever negative
opinion on an ECB candidate in a symbolic protest against the
shortage of women in top European jobs.  The Parliament’s non-binding opinion left the final say
with leaders of the 17 euro-area governments, which unanimously
nominated Mersch for the ECB’s six-member Frankfurt-based
Executive Board in July.  “I would say that Mr. Mersch will be in  Frankfurt  by mid-
November,” Juncker, who chairs meetings of euro finance
ministers and helped engineer the appointment, said in an
interview in Luxembourg today.  The selection of Mersch, 63, marks a victory for German-
style monetary rigor after financially ailing  Spain 
unsuccessfully sought to hold on to the ECB post, which has been
vacant since June 1. As Luxembourg’s representative on the ECB’s
wider policy-setting Governing Council, Mersch is the euro
area’s longest serving central-bank chief and has earned a
reputation as an inflation hawk.  The 27-nation European Union assembly undercut its case
against Mersch by praising his qualifications and mustering a
vote of only 325 to 300 with 49 abstentions against the
circumstances of his appointment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
