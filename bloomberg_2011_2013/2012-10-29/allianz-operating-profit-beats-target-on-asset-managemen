Allianz SE (ALV) ,  Europe ’s biggest
insurer, said third-quarter net income rose and operating profit
exceeded its expectations, fueled by improvements at the asset-
management business.  Net income rose to 1.4 billion euros ($1.8 billion), the
company said in an e-mailed release today. That compares with an
84 percent drop in net income a year earlier to 196 million
euros. Operating profit climbed to 2.5 billion euros from 1.91
billion euros a year earlier. All results are preliminary, the
Munich-based company said.  “Following the strong operating performance, Allianz
expects the 2012 full-year operating profit to exceed 9 billion
euros, assuming a normal business development during the
remainder of the year,” Allianz said in the statement. The
forecast compares with analysts’ estimates for 8.57 billion
euros in full-year operating profit.  Asset management’s contribution to Allianz’s operating
profit almost tripled to 27 percent over the past five years and
was 635 million euros in the second quarter. The insurer has
said it plans to expand the asset management unit’s operating
profit, excluding currency movements, by 5 percent to 10 percent
“over a full cycle.”  Full-year net income will be “comparatively lower because
of further balance sheet strengthening including investment de-
risking and restructuring activities,” as already seen in the
first nine months of 2012, the insurer said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
