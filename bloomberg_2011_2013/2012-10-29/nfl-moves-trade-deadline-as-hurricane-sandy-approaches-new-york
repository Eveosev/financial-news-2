The National Football League delayed
its trade deadline by two days to limit complications from
 Hurricane Sandy .  The league notified its 32 teams that the new deadline for
trades is 4 p.m. Eastern time on Nov. 1, NFL spokesman  Greg Aiello  said in an e-mail. The league’s New York City offices
will be closed until tomorrow.  The final day for trades was already extended two weeks to
Oct. 30 after negotiations between the league and players’ union
earlier in the season.  The NFL announced the delay as Hurricane Sandy, the biggest
Atlantic Ocean tropical storm in history, headed toward the
northeastern U.S.  To contact the reporter on this story:
