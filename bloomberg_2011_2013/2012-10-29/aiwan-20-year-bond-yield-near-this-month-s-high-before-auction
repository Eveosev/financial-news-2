Taiwan dollar  forwards touched the
strongest level in almost two weeks on optimism the island’s
exports are rebounding, brightening the economic outlook.
 Government bonds  were little changed.  Orders, an indication of demand for shipments in one to
three months, rose 1.9 percent in September from a year earlier,
the first increase since February, figures showed on Oct. 19.
 Taiwan  may report on Oct. 31 that the economy grew 1.55 percent
in the third quarter, after contracting 0.18 percent in the
prior quarter, according to the median estimate of economists
surveyed by Bloomberg.  “Exports will be a key determinant of the Taiwan dollar
looking forward,” said Tarsicio Tong, a currency trader at
Union Bank of Taiwan in Taipei. “But we’re seeing limited room
for more appreciation. The Taiwan dollar might weaken slightly
towards year-end as the economic outlook isn’t certain yet.”  One-month non-deliverable forwards were little changed at
NT$29.228 per dollar as of 4:42 p.m. in Taipei, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. They touched NT$29.086 earlier, the
strongest level since Oct. 17.  Taiwan’s dollar traded at NT$29.292 in the  spot market ,
compared with NT$29.300 at the end of last week, data from
Taipei Forex Inc. showed. Tong predicts the currency will drop
to NT$29.500 by the end of 2012.  One-month implied volatility, a measure of exchange-rate
swings used to price options, declined 21 basis points, or 0.21
percentage point, to 3.34 percent.  The Ministry of Finance sold 20-year bonds at a record-low
yield today. It auctioned NT$30 billion ($1 billion) of
securities due 2032 at 1.58 percent, matching the median
estimate of seven fixed-income traders surveyed by Bloomberg.  The yield on the 1.125 percent notes due September 2022 was
at 1.14 percent in the secondary market, according to Gretai
Securities Market.  The  overnight interbank lending  rate was steady at 0.384
percent, a weighted average compiled by the Taiwan Interbank
Money Center shows.  To contact the reporter on this story:
