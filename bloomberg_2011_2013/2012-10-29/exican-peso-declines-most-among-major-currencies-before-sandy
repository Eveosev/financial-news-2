Mexico ’s peso fell, slipping the
most among major currencies, as Hurricane Sandy moved toward the
U.S. East Coast, bearing down on a stretch of the Latin American
nation’s biggest export market.  The peso fell 0.5 percent to 13.0592 at 7:41 a.m. in Mexico
City, the most among the dollar’s top-traded global
counterparts. The peso’s 1.6 percent slump in the past month has
trimmed its year-to-date advance to 6.7 percent. One-month
historical volatility, which measures the magnitude of
fluctuations over the period, climbed to 6.77 percent from 6.61
percent on Oct. 26., according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The gauge fell to 5.98 percent on Oct. 16, the lowest since
March 2011.  Hurricane Sandy moved closer to  New York City  with 70-mile-
per-hour winds, forcing the cancellation of  stock trading  as it
churned toward the U.S., which purchases 80 percent of Mexico’s
exports.  “We’re waiting to see how hard we get hit by the fact that
Sandy is near the East Coast of the U.S.,” Roberto Galvan, a
currency trader at Intercam Casa de Bolsa SA, said by phone from
Mexico City. “There’s going to be little interest in getting
into risk markets.”  Peso trading volume has been partially limited by the
storm, according to Galvan.  Yields on peso bonds due in 2024 fell two basis points, or
0.02 percentage point, to 5.59 percent, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The price rose 0.2 centavo to 138.79
centavos per peso.  To contact the reporter on this story:
