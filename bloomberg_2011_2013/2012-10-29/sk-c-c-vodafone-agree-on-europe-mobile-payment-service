SK C&C Co. (034730) , a South Korean
technology provider, said it will partner with  Vodafone Group
Plc (VOD)  to introduce a mobile-phone payment service as the companies
seek to tap demand for transactions without physical wallets.  CorFire, the mobile-commerce business of SK C&C’s U.S.
unit, will provide the technology under an agreement signed this
month, the Seongnam, South Korea-based company said in a
statement e-mailed to Bloomberg News. The service will start in
the first quarter of next year in Germany and Spain before
reaching other countries in  Europe , according to the statement.  SK C&C is expanding in mobile payments after signing
similar partnership agreements with  Google Inc. (GOOG)  and Dunkin
Donuts Inc. over the past 18 months. More than 1 billion people
may use mobile payments with almost $1 trillion in transaction
value by 2016, according to IE Market Research.  Vodafone’s new service will allow users to download
“mobile wallet” applications to their smartphones and use them
to pay, according to the statement. The Newbury, England-based
carrier also plans to introduce apps that offer discount coupons
and prepaid cards, according to the statement.  Vodafone has reached a deal to use smart-chip maker Gemalto
NV’s technology to manage a new mobile-phone payment product set
for release next year, two people familiar with the plan said
this month.  SK C&C last year agreed with  InComm  to introduce a
technology that helps shoppers get coupons and pay for items on
their phones.  To contact the reporter on this story:
