Novak Djokovic will knock  Roger Federer  off the top spot next week and finish the season as the
world’s best male tennis player for a second straight year.  Serbia’s Djokovic, 25, had lost his top ranking to Federer
in July after the Swiss won his 17th Grand Slam singles title at
Wimbledon.  Federer’s loss in the final of last weekend’s Basel event
to Argentina’s Juan Martin del Potro and his withdrawal from
this week’s BNP Paribas Masters in Paris mean he won’t have
enough points to retain his ranking, the  ATP World Tour  said on
its website.  Djokovic will reclaim the No. 1 ranking on Nov. 5, the
opening day of the season-ending ATP World Tour Finals in
London. He’s the first man to retain the top spot in consecutive
seasons since Federer had four straight world No. 1 finishes
from 2004-07.  Djokovic, a right-hander from Belgrade, didn’t have the
stellar year he had in 2011, when he won 10 tournaments
including three majors. He won five tournaments in 2012,
including one major at the Australian Open.  He lost his first French Open final to  Rafael Nadal  of
Spain and was defeated in the semifinals of Wimbledon by
Federer, while Britain’s  Andy Murray  got the better of him in
the final of the  U.S. Open .  To contact the reporter on this story:
