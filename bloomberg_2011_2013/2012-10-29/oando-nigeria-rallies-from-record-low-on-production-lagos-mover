Oando Plc (OANDO) , a Nigerian energy
company, rallied from a record low after announcing the start of
production at one of its wells and as a technical signal
indicated the stock was oversold.  The stock gained 5 percent to 11.55 naira by 12:46 p.m. in
Lagos,  Nigeria ’s commercial capital. The shares reached a 14-day
relative strength index of 27.7 when they last traded on Oct.
24, before the market closed for two days of holidays. A level
below 30 signals to some technical analysts that the stock is
oversold and set to gain. The RSI was 38.4 today.  “The stock was oversold, so on a technical trending, it
appears attractive to traders,” Pabina Yinkere, Lagos-based of
Head of Research at Vetiva, said by phone today.  The Ebendo-4 well, in which Oando Energy Resources, a unit
of Oando, has a 42.75 percent working interest, has started
production at 2,000 barrels per day, the company announced on
Oct. 23.  Oando shares have fallen 48 percent this year, compared
with a 30 percent rise in the Nigerian Stock Exchange All-Share
Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
