Bond yields will put pressure on
sellers of annuities if  interest rates  remain near record lows,
Robert Kerzner, chief executive officer of industry group Limra,
said today at a conference.  “If long-term rates stay where they are, it would be
devastating for our industry,” Kerzner said in a speech in
 Chicago . “For now, there is no relief in sight, and if this is
the way it’s going to stay, it’s a game changer.”  MetLife Inc. (MET)  and  Prudential Financial Inc. (PRU)  are among
insurers that sell the retirement products that can guarantee an
income stream. The sellers rely on bonds to invest funds that
they may pay out in the future. The 10-year U.S. Treasury yields
1.72 percent, down from as high as 2.38 percent in March, and
the  Federal Reserve  has pledged to keep rates low through at
least the middle of 2015 to boost U.S. growth.  Sellers may adjust offerings if yields remain low, Kerzner
said. Firms are already raising prices for some products, said
Mark Finkelstein, an analyst at Evercore Partners Inc. The low
rates still raise questions among investors about insurers’
profitability, he said.  “People kind of say, ‘Well, can you really make money when
the ten-year is at 1.6 and spreads are at historic lows?,” he
said in a presentation at the conference.  Low interest rates will slow earnings growth at some
insurers, Finkelstein said.  “It is a headwind, but it’s fairly manageable at least
over the next five to seven years at these levels,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
