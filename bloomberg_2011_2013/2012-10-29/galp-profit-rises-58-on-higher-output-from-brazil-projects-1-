Galp Energia SGPS SA (GALP) , Portugal’s
biggest oil company, said third-quarter profit rose 58 percent
as output from its Brazilian projects increased.  Adjusted net income climbed to 98 million euros ($127
million) from 62 million euros a year earlier, the Lisbon-based
company said today in a regulatory filing. That compares with
the 103.9 million-euro mean  estimate  of 13 analysts in a
Bloomberg survey. Profit on this basis excludes one-time items
and inventory changes.  “Rising production in  Brazil  more than offset the falling
production in Angola, ” Galp said in the statement.  Galp plans to invest 1.2 billion euros a year from 2013 to
2016 as it explores in Brazil’s offshore  Santos Basin , where its
Lula project is located, and in Angola. By expanding access to
crude supplies, Galp is seeking to curb dependence on refining
and sales of fuel in Portugal and  Spain .  Average working-interest  production  rose 25 percent from a
year earlier to 25,900 barrels a day. Average net entitlement
output climbed 60 percent to 19,500 barrels a day. The company
said the average selling price declined 4.5 percent. Galp
targets working interest production of about 24,000 barrels a
day in the fourth quarter.  Galp plans to exceed 300,000 barrels of oil equivalent a
day in working-interest production by 2020. It has stakes in
four offshore blocks in the Santos Basin, including 10 percent
of Lula, the largest find in the Americas since  Mexico ’s
Cantarell field in 1976.  LNG Trading  Natural-gas sales climbed 27 percent to 1.47 billion cubic
meters in the third period, helped by increased trading of
liquefied natural gas as demand in  Asia  and  Latin America  grew.  The Portuguese oil company is also investing in upgrades at
its refineries in Oporto and Sines to increase diesel
production. Galp’s refinery in Oporto can process about 90,000
barrels a day, while the Sines plant has a 220,000-barrel-a-day
capacity.  Galp said in a presentation today that the commissioning of
a new hydrocracker at its Sines refinery is “under way” and it
expects “steady” production at the end of the fourth quarter.
Chief Executive Officer Manuel Ferreira de Oliveira had said on
July 27 that the new hydrocracker would be working at full
capacity at the end of September or beginning of October.  The producer used its refineries at 70 percent of capacity
in the third quarter and processed 2.6 percent more crude. The
volume of refined product sales fell 2.2 percent. The refining
margin, a measure of profit from converting oil into fuels,
widened to $4.40 a barrel from $0.90 in the third quarter of
2011. Galp faced workers’ strikes in September and this month.  Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization rose 38 percent to 306 million euros in the third
quarter. Galp today reaffirmed a forecast for Ebitda to be
“close” to 1 billion euros in 2012. It estimates Ebitda will
rise at a compound annual growth rate of about 25 percent from
2011 to 2016.  Galp  shares  have advanced 12 percent this year, giving the
company a market value of 10.5 billion euros.  Amorim Energia BV, a holding company controlled by
Portuguese investor  Americo Amorim , in July completed the
purchase of a 5 percent stake in Galp from  Eni SpA (ENI)  of  Italy  to
increase its holding to 38 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
