Gulf Coast gasoline strengthened on
speculation refinery shutdowns ahead of  Hurricane Sandy  will
boost demand for the region’s products.  Sandy, the Atlantic’s largest-ever tropical storm, prompted
 Phillips 66 (PSX)  to shut its 238,000-barrel-a-day Bayway refinery in
New Jersey early today, while  Hess Corp. (HES)  shut its Port Reading
plant, also in New Jersey. Philadelphia Energy Solutions’
Philadelphia plant and  PBF Energy Inc. (PBF) ’s Delaware City,
Delaware, unit are operating at reduced rates, the companies
said.  Extended outages may deplete East Coast  supplies , which
Energy Department data show are 9.1 percent less than a year
ago. Stockpiles grew 1.34 million barrels to 48.1 million in the
area in the week ended Oct. 25, the agency said.  Reformulated gasoline  to be blended with ethanol on the
Gulf Coast gained 1.75 cents to trade at a discount of 13.75
cents a gallon below futures on the  New York  Mercantile Exchange
at 2 p.m., according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  RBOB in New York Harbor was 0.5 cent higher at 4.25 cents
over futures.  To contact the reporter on this story:
