Japan ’s two  main stock indexes  fell,
reversing morning gains, as  Honda (7267)  Motor Co. plunged after
cutting its annual profit forecast. The declines were limited on
expectations the  Bank of Japan  will add stimulus at a policy
meeting tomorrow.  Honda, Japan’s third-largest carmaker by revenue, sank 4.7
percent after reducing its outlook as Chinese consumers shun
Japanese vehicles amid a territorial dispute between Asia’s two-
biggest economies.  NTT DoCoMo Inc. (9437) , Japan’s top mobile-phone
company, declined the most on the Nikkei 225 Stock Average after
cutting its profit forecast.  NEC Corp. (6701) , a maker of wireless
stations, jumped 5.7 percent after boosting second-quarter
profit 38 percent on the sale of display panel-related patents
and cost cuts.  “Basically, investors are in a wait-and-see stance,” said
Yoshihiro Ito, chief strategist at Okasan Online Securities Co.,
a unit of Okasan Securities Group Inc. in  Tokyo . “People had
expected the earnings would be bad but some investors used it as
an excuse to sell shares.”  The  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  fell less than 0.1 percent to
8,929.34 at the 3 p.m. close, with volume more than 20 percent
below the 30-day average. The broader  Topix (TPX)  Index slid 0.1
percent to 740.30 after rising as much as 0.6 percent earlier.  The Topix has risen 3 percent since Sept. 6 after the
 European Central Bank  started a global wave of easing to boost
growth, with the U.S. Federal Reserve and the Bank of Japan
following suit. Shares on the stock gauge traded at 0.9 times
book value, compared with 2.2 for the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index and 1.5 for the Europe Stoxx 600　Index.  BOJ Meeting  Bank of Japan Governor Masaaki Shirakawa’s board is facing
political pressure to ease policy as government data last week
showed consumer prices fell for a fifth straight month. The
breakeven rate suggests that inflation will remain below the
BOJ’s 1 percent goal even in 2017. All but one of 27 economists
surveyed by  Bloomberg News  expect the central bank to increase
asset purchases at its policy meeting tomorrow.  Honda sank 4.7 percent to 2,399 yen, the heaviest drag in
the Topix, after saying net income will probably reach 375
billion yen ($4.7 billion) in the year ending March, 20 percent
lower than its forecast in July. Carmakers declined the most in
the Topix’s 33 industry groups.  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203)  fell 1.6
percent to 3,030 yen. Nissan Motor Co. lost 2.2 percent to 670
yen.  Japan’s current earnings season peaks this week, with 571
of the 1,672 Topix companies reporting results. Of the 111
companies on the Topix which have reported quarterly revenue
since Oct. 1, and for which Bloomberg News has estimates, 65
percent have fallen short of projections.  NTT, NEC  NTT DoCoMo sank 6 percent to 116,000 yen after cutting its
annual net income forecast 9 percent to 507 billion yen as
competitors lured customers with Apple Inc.’s iPhone 5.  NEC gained the most in the Nikkei 225, rising 5.7 percent
to 148 yen, after saying net income rose to 25.9 billion yen for
the three months ended Sept. 30 from 18.7 billion yen a year
earlier. NEC sold the patents to a Hon Hai Precision Industry
Co. unit for 9.45 billion yen, Taipei-based Hon Hai said Sept.
28.  Nippon Sheet Glass Co. rose 3.3 percent to 62 yen after the
Nikkei newspaper said on Oct. 27 the company may post July-
September operating loss of about 3 billion yen, narrower than
expected its 4.5 billion yen loss, due to cost cuts.  Nippon Sheet, a glassmaker that generates about 40 percent
of its sales in Europe, said on Oct. 26 it will shut automotive
glass plants in Finland and Sweden by the end of 2013, citing
decline in demand.  ‘Frankenstorm’  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell 0.3 percent
today as investors braced for the impact of  Hurricane Sandy . The
U.S. securities industry canceled equity trading on all markets
today, moving to protect workers as Hurricane Sandy barreled
toward  New York City  with 70-mile-per-hour winds and the threat
of an 11-foot surge.  The last time the NYSE cut trading hours for weather was
Jan. 8, 1996, when a blizzard dropped more than 20 inches of
snow on  New York  City.  U.S. gross domestic product, the value of all goods and
services produced, rose at a 2 percent annual rate after
climbing 1.3 percent in the prior quarter, Commerce Department
figures showed on Oct. 26 in Washington. The median forecast of
86 economists surveyed by Bloomberg was for a 1.8 percent gain.  “The 2 percent growth of U.S. GDP was certainly good as
the headline, but the contents showed the pace of recovery is
much as people expected,” said   Masaru Hamasaki , Tokyo-based
chief strategist at Toyota Asset Management Co., which manages
the equivalent of $23 billion. “Domestic demand was largely
supported by military expenses. The  U.S. economy  is not bad but
not good, either.”  The  Nikkei Stock Average Volatility Index (VNKY)  slid 0.5 percent
to 20.38, indicating that traders expect a swing of 5.8 percent
on the equity benchmark in the next 30 days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
