Prime Minister  Benjamin Netanyahu ’s
Likud party members gave enthusiastic approval to his plan to
team up with Foreign Minister Avigdor Liberman’s Yisrael Beitenu
party in a bid to clinch re-election in January.  “Combining forces will give us the power to rule,”
Netanyahu told a Likud convention in Tel Aviv late today in
remarks broadcast on radio and television.  Polls show the combined ticket will enable Netanyahu to
form a new ruling coalition with allied parties that give him a
majority in the 120-seat Knesset and pave the way for his third
term as prime minister.  Both Netanyahu and Liberman oppose placing a limit on new
building in Israeli settlements in the  West Bank . Palestinian
Authority President  Mahmoud Abbas  has demanded that such
construction be halted as a precondition for resuming peace
talks that have been suspended since 2010.  The two parties together would gain 43 seats, more than
double the 20 seats that would go to its nearest runner-up, the
 Labor party , according to a survey published today in the Maariv
daily.  A poll conducted by Channel Two television over the weekend
gave the Likud-Beitenu list 42 seats, and one carried out by
Channel 10 had it at 35.  Liberman praised the Likud’s approval of the plan in an e-
mailed statement, calling it “an historic and important step
that will strengthen the state of Israel and lead to an
experienced and unified government.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
