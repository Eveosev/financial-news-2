U.S. oil and gas companies are
prepared as  Hurricane Sandy  aims rain and wind at the mid-
Atlantic region, according to the  American Petroleum Institute ,
a group whose members include Exxon Mobil Corp.  “Hurricane procedures have been implemented and will
remain in effect until the passing of the storm,” Bob Greco,
API director of downstream operations, said today in a
statement. “Onshore facilities have been secured for the storm.
This includes pipelines, refineries and terminals.”  Phillips 66 said it shut its 238,000-barrel-per-day
refinery in Linden, New Jersey. Other refineries in the U.S.
Northeast were curtailing output as Sandy approached, according
to the Energy Department update, which quoted trade reports.  To contact the reporter on this story:
