Members of the Bluenext SA spot

European Union permit accounts.  Members will be able to move cash and permits out of their

Chauvancy, a spokesman for Bluenext, said today by phone from
Paris. The exchange said Oct. 26 that it would stop trading in
spot and futures contracts from 6 p.m. on Dec. 5.  “From Dec. 7 to Dec. 13 Bluenext will ensure that members’
cash and allowances are returrned to them,” Chauvancy said.
“From Dec. 17 Bluenext will revoke its mandate on trading and
holding accounts on the EU registry and with Caisse des
Depots.”  Members of the exchange must hold cash in escrow accounts
at Caisse des Depots et Consignations to pay for permits they
buy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
