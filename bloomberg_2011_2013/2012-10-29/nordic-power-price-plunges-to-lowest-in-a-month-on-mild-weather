Nordic power for next-quarter
delivery fell to its lowest price in a month as forecasts of
mild and wet weather indicated lower demand and a boost in
supplies in the hydropower-dependent region.  Temperatures in the Stockholm area may rise to as high as 9
degrees Celsius (48 Fahrenheit) in the next 10 days, from 5
degrees for today, according to the Swedish Meteorological and
Hydrological Institute’s website.  Power for January through March fell as much as 2.7 percent
to 40.30 euros ($51.98) a megawatt-hour, its lowest since Sept.
27, and traded at 40.45 euros at 2:33 p.m. Oslo time on Nasdaq
OMX Group Inc.’s energy exchange. Next-month electricity
declined as much as 3.8 percent to 37.75 euros, and later traded
at 37.85 euros.  The Nordic region gets more than half of its average power
use each year from running water through turbines, and Swedish
and Norwegian reservoirs contain 9.5 terawatt-hours more water
for power generation than the seasonal mean, according to
Markedskraft AS data on Bloomberg. The surplus is set to drop by
21 percent to 7.5 terawatt-hours in two weeks, which signals an
increase of 0.8 terawatts compared with a forecast earlier
today, the data show.  Baseload power for around-the-clock delivery in the Nordic
region will cost 38.78 euros on average tomorrow, following
today’s auction on the Nord Pool Spot AS exchange in Oslo.
That’s 6.8 percent higher than yesterday’s turnout for today.  The nuclear utilization rate from 14 reactors in Sweden and
 Finland  may rise by 7 percentage points from today’s level to 96
percent later this week, according to a Bloomberg estimate, as
Vattenfall AB’s Ringhals-2 unit will start generating power on
Nov. 1, the company said in a Nord Pool filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
