Kansas State moved to No. 2 in the
Bowl Championship Series standings behind the top-ranked
University of  Alabama  to improve its chances of playing for
college football’s national title for the first time.  The University of  Florida  had been ranked second and
slipped five spots with a 17-9 loss to  Georgia  two days ago in
Jacksonville, Florida. Kansas State improved to 8-0 for the
first time since 1999 with its 55-24 win against Texas Tech.  Alabama has topped the BCS since the first standings were
released Oct. 14 and moved to 8-0 with a 38-7 win over formerly
unbeaten Mississippi State two days ago. The Crimson Tide has a
.976 rating out of 1.000 in the standings, which are determined
using the USA Today coaches’ poll, Harris Interactive poll and
six computer rankings. Kansas State is at .940.  Notre Dame is ranked third at .915, followed by fellow
unbeaten  Oregon  at .914.  The Fighting Irish are 8-0 for the first time since 2002
after winning 30-13 at then-eighth ranked  Oklahoma  on Oct. 27.
Oregon is also 8-0 after routing Colorado 70-14. The Ducks are
ranked second by the coaches and in the Harris poll, yet are
hurt by an average computer ranking of fifth.  Louisiana State (7-1) is the highest-ranked one-loss team
at No. 5 and will host Alabama on Nov. 3 in Baton Rouge.  LSU is followed by three other Southeastern Conference
teams, as Georgia (7-1) is ranked sixth, followed by Florida
(7-1) and South Carolina (7-2). Florida State (8-1) and
Louisville (8-0) round out the top 10.  The top two teams in the final BCS standings on Dec. 2 will
play in the national championship game on Jan. 7 in Miami.  To contact the reporter on this story:
