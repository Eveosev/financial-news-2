Buyers of cocoa from  Ghana , the
world’s second-biggest producer, are paying a smaller premium
for their beans as concerns an industry reform in top grower
Ivory Coast would disrupt shipments eased, three traders said.  Ghanaian beans in the European market cost 85 pounds ($136)
to 90 pounds a metric ton more than futures on NYSE Liffe in
London, said the traders, who are familiar with the sales and
declined to be identified because they’re not authorized to
speak to the media. That compares with 90 pounds to 100 pounds a
ton two months ago. Ivory Coast is implementing changes to its
cocoa sector that include selling 70 percent to 80 percent of
the crop before the season starts.  Cocoa climbed 11 percent so far this year on speculation
the reform would result in delays to shipments. Bean arrivals at
ports in  Ivory Coast  for export totaled 65,000 tons from the
start of the season through Oct. 21, according to data from
KnowledgeCharts, a unit of researcher  Commodities Risk Analysis 
LC in Bethlehem,  Pennsylvania . That compares with 50,300 tons in
the same period a year earlier. Prices fell 3.9 percent last
week as concerns about supply disruptions eased.  “Prices have strong momentum so may fall further as
investors remove long positions and because rains returned to
Ivory Coast and initial arrivals have been good,” Keith Flury,
a senior commodities analyst at Rabobank International in
London, said by e-mail today. “In the medium term, prices
should bounce back given we forecast a shortage for 2012-13.”  Ivorian cocoa was trading in the European market at 40
pounds to 55 pounds a ton above the NYSE Liffe price, the
traders said. That compares to 55 pounds to 70 pounds a ton two
months ago, three traders said then.  Cocoa for March delivery was down 0.8 percent to 1,532
pounds a ton in  London .  To contact the reporter on this story:
