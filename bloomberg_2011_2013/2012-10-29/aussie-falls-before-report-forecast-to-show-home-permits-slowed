Australia’s dollar fell against the
majority of its 16 most-traded peers before a report forecast to
show that growth in the nation’s home-building permits slowed
last month.  The Australian currency declined as the Bureau of
Statistics will say that September  approvals  increased 1
percent, compared with 6.4 percent the previous month, according
to the median estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg. The
Aussie and New Zealand’s currency fell against most major peers
as stocks and commodities declined on risk aversion.  The Australian dollar dropped 0.4 percent to $1.0329
yesterday in New York. It bought 82.43 yen, down 0.2 percent.
The  New Zealand dollar , nicknamed the kiwi, slid 0.5 percent to
81.91 U.S. cents. The currency weakened 0.2 percent to 65.37
yen.  The MSCI Asia Pacific  Index (MXAP)  of shares declined 0.3 percent
yesterday, following a 0.9 percent loss on Oct. 26. The Standard
& Poor’s GSCI Index of 24 raw materials declined 0.6 percent.  U.S. stock trading was canceled today for a second day,
joining bond markets, as 90-mile-per-hour winds and surging seas
from  Hurricane Sandy  bore down on New York and paralyzed
American capital markets.  Futures traders increased bets that the Aussie will gain
against the  U.S. dollar  for the first time in four weeks,
figures from the Washington-based Commodity Futures Trading
Commission show.  The  difference  in the number of wagers by  hedge funds  and
other large speculators on an advance in the Australian dollar
compared with those on a drop was 45,651 on Oct. 23, compared
with the so-called net longs of 38,444 a week earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
