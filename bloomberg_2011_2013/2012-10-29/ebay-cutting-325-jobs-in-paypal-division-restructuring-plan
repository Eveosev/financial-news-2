EBay Inc. (EBAY)  will cut 325 jobs in its
PayPal unit and take a pretax restructuring charge of $15
million, part of President David Marcus’s efforts to streamline
the payment division and accelerate new products.  PayPal is also ending work arrangements with about 120
contractors worldwide,  San Jose , California-based EBay said
today in a statement.  Marcus is overhauling the payment unit, whose almost 13,000
employees are competing with startups such as Stripe Inc. and
WePay Inc. that have been able to roll out services more
efficiently. Marcus, who took over in April, so far has
consolidated nine product groups into one and announced a plan
to reorganize offices into a more collaborative environment.  “Unfortunately, making the right decisions on behalf of
our customers meant we had to make some very tough decisions
inside our company,” Marcus said in a  blog post  today. “This
is a difficult day at PayPal.”  Workers who were notified of their termination today will
be eligible for the employee stock-purchase plan, which closes
at the end of the month, according to Anuj Nayar, a spokesman
for PayPal.  PayPal accounted for 43 percent of EBay’s  revenue  last
year, compared with 25 percent in 2007. While sales rose 23
percent to $1.37 billion in the third quarter, that gain was
less than the 32 percent jump to $1.11 billion during the same
three months in 2011.  Total payment volume climbed 20 percent to $35.2 billion in
the three months ended Sept. 30. The unit had 117.4 million
users in the period, a 14 percent increase from a year earlier.  “It is a healthy sign to see a company rationalizing
operations,” said Douglas Greiner, an analyst at Compass Point
Research & Trading LLC.  The $15 million pretax charge in the current quarter will
be offset by an expected $2.5 billion in free  cash flow  for the
full year, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
