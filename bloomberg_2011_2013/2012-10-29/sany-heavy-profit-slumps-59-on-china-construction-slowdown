Sany Heavy Industry Co. (600031) ,  China ’s
biggest machinery maker by market value, posted a 59 percent
drop in third-quarter profit as the nation’s slowing economic
growth sapped demand for excavators and concrete pumps.  Net income  in the three months ended Sept. 30 declined to
714 million  yuan  ($114 million) from 1.73 billion yuan a year
earlier, the Changsha, China-based company said in a  filing  to
Shanghai stock exchange today, citing domestic accounting
standard. Sales fell 18 percent to 8.9 billion yuan.  Sany, along with Caterpillar Inc. and Hitachi Construction
Machinery Co., has cut production of diggers in China amid an
equipment glut and a seven-quarter slowdown in economic growth.
The company’s excavator sales, its second-biggest revenue
contributor, fell 27 percent to 2,034 units in the quarter,
according to  data compiled  by Nomura Holdings Inc.  Accounts receivables jumped 83 percent to 20.7 billion yuan
as of Sept. 30 from nine months earlier, as payments slowed amid
the “current macro-economic situation,” Sany said. China’s
gross domestic product expanded 7.4 percent in the third quarter,
the seventh straight deceleration.  Sany  fell  0.6 percent to 9.11 yuan in Shanghai trading
before the results were released. The stock has slumped 27
percent this year.  The company earlier this month said it would lower bad debt
provision ratios, effective from July. The move may boost
earnings in the first nine months by 470 million yuan, it said
in a stock exchange  filing .  Sany’s first-half profit fell 13 percent to 5.16 billion
yuan. That was lower than rival  Zoomlion Heavy Industry Science
& Technology Co. (1157) ’s 5.62 billion yuan. Zoomlion is due to report
its third-quarter earnings tomorrow.  To contact the reporters on this story:
