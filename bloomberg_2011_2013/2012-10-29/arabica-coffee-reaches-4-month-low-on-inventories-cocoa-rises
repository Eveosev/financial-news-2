Arabica coffee fell to the lowest
level in more than four months as the start of the harvest in
Central American nations added to rising stockpiles. Cocoa rose.  Arabica bean  inventories  in warehouses monitored by the ICE
Futures U.S. exchange in New York stood at 2.41 million bags as
of Oct. 26, the highest since May 2010. The 2012-13 crop in
Central America started this month. Demand for arabica coffee
fell as some roasters increased their usage of cheaper robusta
beans following a rise to a 14-year high last year.  “The C contract, with certified stocks reaching 2.4
million bags, or an increase of 875,000 bags so far this year,
is feeling the effect of the start of the harvest in Central
America and little buying interest from the industry,”  Rodrigo Costa , a contributor for Sao Paulo-based Archer Consulting,
wrote in a report e-mailed today, referring to arabica futures.  Arabica coffee for December delivery fell 0.6 percent to
$1.568 a pound by 8:34 a.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in New York. The
price touched $1.563, the lowest since June 25. Robusta coffee
for January delivery slid 1.3 percent to $1,994 a metric ton on
NYSE Liffe in  London  after touching $1,987, the lowest since
Sept. 6.  Robusta beans slid to a seven-week low on speculation this
season’s harvest in  Vietnam , the world’s largest grower of the
variety, will be similar to last year’s record. Vietnamese
coffee exports may more than triple to 105,000 tons this month,
according to the General Statistics Office in Hanoi.  Vietnamese coffee prices fell to 39,800 dong ($1.91) a
kilogram (2.2 pounds), the lowest since May 8, data from the
Daklak Trade & Tourism Center on Bloomberg showed. The 2012-13
season there started this month.  “With the start of a Vietnamese harvest supposedly as big
as the previous, Liffe quotes may be pressured,” Costa said.  Raw sugar for March delivery rose 0.2 percent to 19.39
cents a pound on ICE. White, or refined, sugar for March
delivery slid 0.1 percent to $524 a ton on NYSE Liffe.  Cocoa for December delivery was up 0.2 percent to $2,388 a
ton in  New York . Cocoa for March delivery advanced 0.2 percent
to 1,547 pounds ($2,483) a ton in London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
