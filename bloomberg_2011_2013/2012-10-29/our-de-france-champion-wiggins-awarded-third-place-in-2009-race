This year’s Tour de France champion
Bradley Wiggins has been awarded third place for the 2009 race
after  Lance Armstrong ’s result was wiped out, the International
Cycling Union said.  Wiggins, the first Briton to win the event, finished fourth
behind Alberto Contador,  Andy Schleck  and Armstrong three years
ago.  Last week the ruling body, known by its French initials
UCI, endorsed a decision by the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency to strip
Armstrong of his seven Tour de France titles from 1999-2005 and
banned the American from the sport.  Those wins will not be reallocated, although the placings
from his 2009-10 comeback will be. The Texan finished 23rd in
2010.  The reallocation of third place to Wiggins was confirmed by
UCI spokesman Enrico Carpani.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
