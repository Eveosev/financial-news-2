Chile’s peso weakened for a second
session as copper fell amid concern that  Hurricane Sandy  will
disrupt the  U.S. economy .  The currency depreciated 0.3 percent to 481.92 per  U.S.
dollar  as of the close of trading in Santiago. Copper fell as
much as 1.9 percent to a seven-week low of $3.482 a pound on the
Comex in New York.  The metal makes up half of Chile’s exports and fell on
expectations the hurricane battering the U.S. East Coast will
slow growth in the world’s largest economy. At the same time
stocks in China, the biggest buyer of copper, fell to a one-
month low on weaker corporate earnings.  “Copper is falling hard and dropped below $3.50 for the
first time in a while,” said Mauricio Olivares, a trader at
 Bank of Nova Scotia (BNS) ’s Chilean unit in Santiago. “That’s the
main reason the peso is down. Commodities and stocks have been
falling for a week and a half. If commodities reach a floor, the
dollar should start weakening against the peso again.”  International investors in the Chilean peso forwards market
trimmed bets against the peso to $8.7 billion on Oct. 25 from
$9.1 billion a day earlier, according to central bank data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
