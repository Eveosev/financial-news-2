Oil fell to a three-month low and
gasoline advanced after U.S. East Coast refineries reduced
operations amid forecasts  Hurricane Sandy  will strike extreme
southern New Jersey or central  Delaware .  Crude futures dropped 0.9 percent as Phillips 66,  NuStar
Energy LP (NS) ,  Hess Corp. (HES) ,  PBF Energy Inc. (PBF)  and Philadelphia Energy
Solutions shut or lowered output at regional refineries and
terminals as a precaution. Gasoline rose for a third day. Sandy
will probably make landfall by 9 p.m. New York time, a National
Hurricane Center  advisory  showed.  “Sandy is bullish for the products and bearish for
crude,” said Bill O’Grady, chief market strategist at
Confluence Investment Management in St. Louis, which oversees
$1.4 billion. “A number of refineries reduced operations or
completely shut down, which is going to reduce fuel supplies.
The shutdowns will reduce demand for crude in the short term.”  Crude oil for December delivery fell 74 cents to settle at
$85.54 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Prices are
down 14 percent this year.  Gasoline for November delivery climbed 5.77 cents, or 2.1
percent, to $2.7568 a gallon in New York. November heating oil
increased 1.74 cents, or 0.6 percent, to $3.1152 a gallon.  Floor trading on the Nymex was suspended today because of
Sandy,  CME Group Inc. (CME) , the owner of the exchange, said in an e-
mailed statement. Electronic trading, where the bulk of futures
volume occurs, was normal.  Strengthening Storm  Sandy packed maximum sustained winds of 90 miles (145
kilometers) per hour, the center said at 4 p.m. New York time.
The storm’s center was 65 miles southeast of Atlantic City, New
Jersey, moving west-northwest at 28 mph.  The hurricane may bring a surge of almost 12 feet (3.7
meters) in  Manhattan , said Howard Glazer, New York’s director of
state operations.  New York, New Jersey, Baltimore, Long Island,  Connecticut 
and Delaware Bay ports were closed to vessel traffic by the U.S.
Coast Guard, halting oil tanker deliveries that may affect the
region’s plants. There are seven refineries in the area with a
combined capacity of about 1.29 million barrels a day, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Phillips 66 (PSX)  is shutting its 238,000-barrel-a-day Bayway
refinery and expects the plant to be idled today. Hess said
yesterday it would begin cutting rates at its 70,000-barrel-a-
day Port Reading plant, while NuStar said Oct. 27 that its
74,000-barrel-a-day Paulsboro asphalt refinery would shut today.
PBF was cutting rates at refineries in Paulsboro and Delaware
City, Delaware, and Philadelphia Energy Solutions reduced rates
at the plant in Philadelphia.  Ample Stockpiles  “The refinery shutdowns are sending gasoline and heating
oil higher,” said Michael Lynch, president of Strategic Energy
& Economic Research in Winchester,  Massachusetts . “The
disruptions should be short and prices should soon weaken.”  Oil in New York slumped 4.2 percent last week as the Energy
Department said supplies  jumped  5.9 million barrels to 375.1
million in the seven days to Oct. 19, the highest level for this
time of year since the government started reporting inventories
in 1982.  “Crude oil is down because we expect supplies to continue
rising,” Lynch said.  Brent oil for December settlement slipped 11 cents to end
the session at $109.44 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures
Europe exchange. The European benchmark was at a $23.90-a-barrel
premium to West Texas Intermediate oil traded in New York, up
from $23.27 at the Oct. 26 settlement, according to Bloomberg
calculations of exchange data.  Trading volume was 284,764 contracts as of 3:53 p.m. Volume
totaled 412,544 contracts on Oct. 26, 21 percent below the
three-month average. Open interest was 1.59 million, the highest
level since Sept. 19.  To contact the reporter on this story:
