Tongaat Hulett Ltd. (TON)  fell the most in
more than four months after  Zimbabwe ’s government gave the South
African sugar producer company 14 days to submit a plan to sell
a majority stake in its local operations.  Shares declined 4.6 percent to 134.38 rand by the close in
Johannesburg, the lowest price since Sept. 11 and making the
stock the worst performer in the 10-member  FTSE/JSE Africa Food
Producers Index. (JFPPS)   Zimbabwe introduced legislation in 2010 that compels all
foreign and white-owned businesses with assets worth more than
$500,000 to sell or cede 51 percent of their shares to black
citizens. Tongaat’s Zimbabwe operations produced 372,000 tons of
sugar in the year through March 2012, the company said on May
28, contributing 19 percent of group revenue and 32 percent of
profit from operations. The operations comprise the wholly owned
Triangle Sugar operation and its 50.3 percent holding in  Hippo
Valley Estates Ltd. (HIPO)   “We would like to advise that the ministry’s patience is
fast running thin,” Zwelibanzi Lunga, general manager for
compliance at the Ministry of Indigenization, said in a letter
to Hippo Valley unit dated Oct 23. “Should we not receive a
proper compliant plan within the prescribed period, ministry and
government would take it that shareholders of Triangle are not
interested in continuing to do business in the country.”  Tongaat spokeswoman Adelaide Chikunguru said the company
was “not prepared to comment on that issue” by phone from
Chiredzi.  The stock’s 30-day  historical volatility , a measure of
stock swings, increased to 23.75 from 18.95 the previous trading
day. The FTSE/JSE Africa All Share Index’s  30-day volatility 
measure was at 11.18 versus 11.27. A higher reading means the
price of an asset can move dramatically in a short period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
