China ’s overnight money-market rate
rose to the highest level in a month on speculation a cash
shortage will worsen as banks hoard funds to meet month-end
 capital requirements .  The People’s Bank of China gauged demand for sales of
seven-, 14- and 28-day reverse-repurchase contracts this week,
according to a trader at a primary dealer required to bid at the
auctions. The authority is “much less” inclined to cut
lenders’ reserve requirements given growth in their foreign-
currency positions, as well as increases in  money supply  and
trust lending, according to a front-page commentary in Financial
News today.  “It’s most likely the month-end effect,” said Wee-Khoon Chong, a strategist at Societe Generale SA in  Hong Kong . “The
money rates will remain high over the next three days but there
won’t be long-term pressure on the market.”  The  one-day repurchase rate , a gauge of interbank funding
availability, jumped 91 basis points, or 0.91 percentage point,
to 4.37 percent at 10:36 a.m. in Shanghai, according to a
weighted average compiled by the National Interbank Funding
Center. That was the highest level since Sept. 25.  The central bank also asked banks to submit orders for 28-
and 91-day repurchase contracts this morning, according to the
trader who declined to be identified because the information
isn’t public.  The one-year interest-rate swap, the fixed cost to receive
the seven-day repo rate, fell one basis point to 3.20 percent in
Shanghai, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
