Norfolk Southern Corp. (NSC) , the second-
largest U.S. eastern railroad, stopped coal exports at its
Lamberts Point Terminal in Norfolk, Virginia, because of
Hurricane Sandy.  The company halted operations yesterday at 6 a.m. local
time as the storm moved toward the U.S. East Coast. Lamberts
Point has capacity to ship 36 million tons of coal annually,
Robin Chapman, a company spokesman, said today in a telephone
interview.  Norfolk Southern serves mines from Illinois to Pennsylvania
and the port typically operates 24 hours, seven days a week,
according to the companyâ€™s website.  CSX Corp. (CSX) , the largest eastern U.S. railroad, said in a
statement that it closed its networks from Richmond, Virginia,
to Albany, New York because of Sandy.  Gary Sease, a company spokesman in Jacksonville, Florida,
declined to comment on shipments of specific commodities,
including coal.  Coal on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  fell 7 cents to
$59.20 a ton on Oct. 26. Prices have dropped 15 percent this
year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
