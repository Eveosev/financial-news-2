Kosovo is set to get a second loan
from the  International Monetary Fund  this year amounting to 41
million euros ($53 million) as the Balkan nation economy avoids
the financial turbulence gripping most of Europe.  The IMF is set to approve the loan in December after
disbursing a 48 million-euro package in July, the Washington-
based lender said in a report today. Total budget receipts
composed of revenue and financing exceeded projections, the IMF
said as the government also met the goal of starting the sale of
telecommunications company Posta dhe Telekomunikacioni i Kosoves
Sh.A.  “Kosovo’s economy has continued to display considerable
resilience in the face of external financial turbulence,”
Johaness Wiegand said in the report. “Robust current and
capital inflows, notably from the Kosovar diaspora, have
continued to support activity.”  Kosovo’s economy is driven by investments and cash sent
from its residents living in  Europe . Gross domestic product is
forecast to expand 3 percent this year and in 2013, higher than
in most neighboring countries, the IMF said today.  The predominantly Albanian-populated Balkan nation that
declared independence from  Serbia  in 2008 wants to normalize
relations with its former ruler as both countries seek closer
ties with the European Union.  To contact the reporter on this story:
