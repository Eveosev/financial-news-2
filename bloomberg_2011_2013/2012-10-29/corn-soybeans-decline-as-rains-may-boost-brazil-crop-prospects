Soybeans fell for a third session in
 Chicago  as rains forecast for this week in South America may
help improve growing conditions. Wheat and corn rose.  Growing areas in  Brazil  may get as much as 1.25 inches (3.2
centimeters) of rain in the next five days, according to a
Commodity Weather Group forecast. Brazil is set to overtake the
U.S. this year as the world’s largest soybean grower and
exporter, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
Brazilian farmers typically  plant  the oilseed starting in
October for a harvest beginning in March.  “The key thing that the market is looking at right now is
the crop and planting conditions on Brazil and  Argentina ,”
Michael Creed, an agribusiness economist at National Australia
Bank Ltd., said by phone from  Melbourne  today. “Rains forecast
in Brazil may be pushing prices a bit lower.”  Soybeans for January delivery slid 0.9 percent to $15.4975
a bushel at 8 a.m. on the Chicago Board of Trade. Prices are
down 13 percent from the record $17.89 reached Sept. 4 amid
concern about the drought afflicting the U.S.  Corn for December delivery rose 0.5 percent to $7.4125 a
bushel, rebounding from a drop of as much as 0.7 percent to
$7.325, a two-week low. The grain fell 3.1 percent last week.  The U.S. securities industry canceled equity trading today
as Hurricane Sandy barreled toward  New York  City. CME Group
Inc., which owns the Chicago Board of Trade,  said  in a statement
e-mailed today trading of all futures and options including
grains will remain open except for U.S. equity index futures and
equity index options.  Wheat for December delivery added 0.5 percent to $8.6825 a
bushel, erasing a decline of as much as 0.4 percent. In Paris,
January-delivery milling wheat gained 0.2 percent to 266 euros
($343) a metric ton on NYSE Liffe.  Farmers in  Russia , last season’s third-largest wheat
exporter, reaped 39.6 million tons of the grain as of Oct. 26,
down 33 percent from a year earlier, according to the country’s
agriculture ministry. The harvest is 99 percent complete.  To contact the reporters on this story:
