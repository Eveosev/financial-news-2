South Africa  said it will open a new
bidding round for alternative energy projects that should add an
additional 3,200 megawatts of power to the national grid in
 Africa ’s largest economy by 2020.  The government is targeting 1,470 megawatts from onshore
wind projects, 400 megawatts from concentrated solar power and
1,075 megawatts from solar photovoltaic projects, Energy
Minister Dipuo Peters said. Biomass and biogas projects should
each generate 47.5 megawatts, small hydropower projects 60
megawatts and other small projects 100 megawatts, she said.  “The South African government is committed to renewable
energy as part of our energy mix,” Peters told reporters in
 Pretoria  today.  The country is expanding electricity supply after state-run
Eskom Holdings SOC Ltd., which generates most of its power from
coal, suffered shortages in 2008, leading to mine closures.
Besides increasing the supply of renewable energy, the
government wants to produce 2,500 megawatts more energy from
coal and 2,609 megawatts from hydropower by 2024, and 2,562
megawatts of extra gas power by 2025.  The power supply program has been approved by the National
Energy Regulator and the necessary government directives will be
published by year-end, Peters said.  The government approved 28 wind, solar and hydropower
projects costing 47 billion rand ($5.4 billion) last December
and 19 proposals valued at 73 billion rand in May, while a third
bidding round is set to be concluded in May.  Companies selected to supply 1,275 megawatts of power in
the first round have concluded financing arrangements, which
were stalled by delays in obtaining government approval, Peters
said. The funding arrangements were supposed to be completed by
the June 30.  The bidding process “introduced a whole new procurement
framework,” she said. “On behalf of government, allow me to
apologize for the delays. I am confident that going forward the
process will be much smoother.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
