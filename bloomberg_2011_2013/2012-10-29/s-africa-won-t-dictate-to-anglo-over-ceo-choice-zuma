South  Africa ’s government won’t
pressure  Anglo American Plc (AAL) , the biggest private employer in the
country, over its choice of chief executive officer, President
Jacob Zuma said, contradicting his mines minister.  Anglo, which helped develop South Africa’s mining-reliant
economy during almost 50 years of apartheid, on Oct. 26 said its
American CEO Cynthia Carroll is resigning and will leave once
her replacement is found.  Susan Shabangu, the minister, said in a statement she hoped
Carroll’s replacement would be “a local person that will
continue to contribute to transformation of our industry and
who will have our interest as a country at heart.” The
country’s Public Investment Corp. and the Government Employees
Pension Fund, together the biggest Anglo shareholder, said Oct.
26 the London-based company’s board needed to be more reflective
of where its assets are. South Africa accounted for 49 percent
of Anglo’s 2011 sales, according to its website.  “We are not going to dictate how companies choose their
people,” Zuma told foreign journalists in Johannesburg today.  Anglo controls Johannesburg-based  Anglo American Platinum
Ltd. (AMS) , the world’s biggest producer of the metal, and  Kumba Iron
Ore Ltd. (KIO) , Africa’s largest iron ore producer. The company also
owns coal and diamond mines in the country.  To contact the reporter on this story:
