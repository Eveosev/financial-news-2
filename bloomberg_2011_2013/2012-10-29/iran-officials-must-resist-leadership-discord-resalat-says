Iranian officials must resist
attempts by Western countries to sow discord within the
leadership,  Resalat  reported, citing Morteza Nabavi, a member of
the Expediency Council.  “By increasing pressures and sanctions, the enemies aim to
squeeze officials in such a way that they start blaming each
other,” the Tehran-based newspaper cited Nabavi as saying.
“This isn’t a time for officials to fire letters at each other
but a time to preserve unity and the nation’s calm,” he said,
in a reference to an ongoing dispute between President  Mahmoud Ahmadinejad  and the judiciary.  Iran’s Expediency Council has the final say in disputes on
legislation.  Nabavi said that the next president shouldn’t make promises
that go beyond the limits of his responsibilities, a criticism
made by Ahmadinejad’s political rivals. Ali Akbar Velayati,
Supreme Leader  Ayatollah Ali Khamenei ’s foreign policy adviser,
is a possible candidate for the June race, he added. Ahmadinejad
is completing his second term and isn’t eligible to run in the
race.  To contact the reporter on this story:
