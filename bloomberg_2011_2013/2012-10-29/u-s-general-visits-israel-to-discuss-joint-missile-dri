U.S. Army General Martin Dempsey,
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, is holding meetings in
 Israel  during the largest joint military exercise between the
two countries.  “The security ties between Israel and the U.S. are deeper
and stronger than they have been for many years,” Israeli
Defense Minister Ehud Barak said in an e-mailed statement from
his office after meeting Dempsey yesterday.  The American general is also meeting with Israel’s Chief of
General Staff Lieutenant General Binyamin Gantz to discuss
“aspects of military cooperation and shared security
challenges,” the army spokesman’s office said in an e-mailed
statement today. Dempsey is also scheduled to visit an Israeli-
made anti-missile Iron Dome battery.  The mock military maneuvers and computer war simulations
come amid heightened tensions with  Iran  over its nuclear program
that Israel says is aimed at achieving nuclear weapons and
Iranian officials say is intended for civilian purposes only.  The U.S.-Israeli exercise, Austere Challenge 12, follows a
U.S.-led exercise last month that involved more than 30 nations
in the largest mine-cleaning demonstration in the Persian Gulf
region.  To contact the reporter on this story:
