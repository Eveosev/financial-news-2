South Korea ’s current-account
surplus widened to the second biggest on record in September on
higher exports of cars and electronics.  The  excess  was $6.07 billion, compared with a revised
surplus of $2.5 billion in August and a record $6.14 billion in
July, the  Bank of Korea  said in a statement in  Seoul  today. The
current account is the broadest measure of trade, tracking
goods, services and investment income.  South Korea’s economy grew at the slowest pace in three
years during the third quarter, with manufacturers’ confidence
for November falling for a second straight month. The Bank of
Korea may add to this year’s two interest-rate cuts to bolster
domestic demand, according to Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc.  “With growth forecast to remain below potential for an
extended period, we expect one more  interest rate  cut in the
first quarter of 2013,” said Erik Lueth, an RBS economist based
in  Hong Kong .  The won was little changed at 1,095.60 per dollar at 11:27
a.m. in Seoul, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It
strengthened to a 13-month high yesterday, touching 1,094.50,
the strongest level since Sept. 14, 2011, before closing at
1,095.90.  While the government announced 14.4 trillion won ($13.1
billion) of economic support measures including tax cuts in
2012, there are no plans for more stimulus in the 2013 budget,
Finance Minister Bahk Jae Wan said last week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
