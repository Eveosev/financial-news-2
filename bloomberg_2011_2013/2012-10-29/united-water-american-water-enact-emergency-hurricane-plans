United Water, a unit of  Suez
Environnement (SEV)  that operates water utilities from North Carolina
to New Hampshire, and  American Water Works Co. (AWK) , the largest
publicly traded U.S. water company, enacted emergency response
plans for customers ahead of the arrival of Hurricane Sandy.  United Water said its national command center would be
based in Boise, Idaho, to operate out of the path of Hurricane
Sandy and help coordinate the company’s response plans with
local officials and municipalities to protect infrastructure,
maintain and restore interrupted services.  American Water Works units in  New Jersey  and New York said
emergency preparations were implemented days ahead of the
storm’s landfall later today to minimize impact to its
facilities and to customers’ water service, backing up power
sources and reinforce points in “the water distribution system
and at treatment plants.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
