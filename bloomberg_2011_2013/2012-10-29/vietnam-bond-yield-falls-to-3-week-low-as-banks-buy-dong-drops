Vietnam ’s bonds rose, sending the
benchmark five-year yield to a three-week low, on speculation
banks are investing spare cash in debt as an economic slowdown
saps demand for loans. The dong weakened.  Loans at Vietnamese banks grew 2.77 percent this year
through Oct. 19, trailing a 14.2 percent increase in deposits,
the government said in a statement on its website yesterday.
Credit growth has fallen short of policy makers’ expectations as
the economy slowed, according to the statement. Prime Minister
Nguyen Tan Dung signaled last week the nation will struggle to
meet a goal of 5.2 percent expansion this year.  The  yield  on the benchmark five-year notes fell two basis
points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 10.19 percent in Hanoi, the
lowest level since Oct. 5, according to a daily fixing from
banks compiled by Bloomberg.  “Some banks have surplus funds and chose to invest in
bonds given the current market conditions,” said Nguyen Thi Ngoc Anh, head of fixed-income trading at Asia Commercial Bank
in  Ho Chi Minh City .  The dong weakened 0.1 percent to 20,850 per dollar as of 4
p.m. in Hanoi, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
central bank set its  reference rate  at 20,828, unchanged since
Dec. 26, according to its website. The currency is allowed to
trade as much as 1 percent on either side of the fixing.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
