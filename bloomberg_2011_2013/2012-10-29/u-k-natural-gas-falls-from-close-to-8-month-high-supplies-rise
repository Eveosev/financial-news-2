U.K. natural gas for same-day
delivery declined from close to an eight-month high as supplies
outpaced demand at the highest level since April. Day-ahead
power dropped.  Month-ahead gas  also fell, trimming a two-week advance,
according to broker data compiled by Bloomberg. Demand in the 24
hours to 6 a.m. tomorrow will be 264 million cubic meters, the
most since April,  National Grid Plc (NG/)  data show. Total supply will
be 268 million, it said.  Gas for today  fell 1.8 percent to 67.35 pence a therm at
10:46 a.m. London time. Next-month gas dropped 0.5 percent to
67.2 pence a therm. That’s equivalent to $10.79 per million
British thermal units and compares with $3.40 per million Btu of
front-month U.S. gas.  Statoil ASA (STL)  said there was reduced availability of gas by
6.4 million cubic meters a day for less than 24 hours yesterday,
 Norway ’s largest energy producer said on its website.  Imports from Norway were at a rate of 107 million cubic
meters a day after reaching 120 million on Oct. 25, the most
since Oct. 1, Gassco AS data show. Flows from  Belgium  were at 19
million cubic meters a day, according to pipeline operator
Interconnector U.K. Ltd. That’s down from 26 million on Oct. 27,
the most since January 2011.  Gas accounted for 32 percent of U.K. power production at
11:00 a.m., National Grid data show. Coal Generated 50 percent,
nuclear 15 percent and wind 2.1 percent.  Electricite de France SA halted its 610-megawatt Hinkley
Point B8 nuclear power plant in southwest  England  on Oct. 27,
according to National Grid Plc data. The reactor will start on
Nov. 3, EDF said.  Electricity for the next working day traded at 50.50 pounds
($81.09) a megawatt-hour, compared with 55 pounds on Oct. 26, an
8.2 percent decline, broker data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
