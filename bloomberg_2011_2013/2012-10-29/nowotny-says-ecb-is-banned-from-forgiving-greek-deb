The  European Central Bank  is banned
from taking part in a Greek debt restructuring because it would
be tantamount to printing money to finance governments,
Governing Council member Ewald Nowotny said.  “For the ECB, forgiving debt isn’t possible because it
would be equivalent to indirect state financing,” Nowotny told
journalists in Vienna today. “Therefore, the ECB certainly
can’t participate in a such actions of the public sector.”  Germany’s Der Spiegel magazine reported yesterday that
Greece’s international creditors propose a so-called haircut in
their latest report on the country’s finances. German Finance
Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  rejected such a debt restructuring,
saying it’s unrealistic to expect public or private bondholders
to take further losses on their Greek holdings.  The ECB holds about 45 billion euros ($58 billion) of Greek
 government bonds  purchased as part of the now terminated
Securities Markets Program, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
