Slovenia’s only nuclear plant was
shut down after heavy rain and snow caused an increase in the
flow of the nearby river used for cooling the system.  The plant in  Krsko , eastern Slovenia, shut down yesterday
at 10:58 a.m. as “the Sava river flow increased and brought
along great quantities of leaves and other impurities, which are
lowering the effectiveness of the cooling system,” it said in
an e-mail statement. The shutdown caused “no impact to the
environment or the people.”  The 700-megawatt plant will be re-connected to the system
in the next couple of days, the plant said in the statement.  Krsko, near the border with  Croatia , is jointly owned by
Slovenia and Croatia. The plant currently provides 20 percent of
Slovenia’s electricity needs and 16 percent to 17 percent for
Croatia, according to Stanislav Rozman, the president of Krsko’s
management board.  To contact the reporter on this story:
