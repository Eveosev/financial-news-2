(Corrects headline and first and second paragraphs to
reflect that the Supreme Court corrected its earlier remarks
that a restraining order was issued blocking an arrest warrant
for Arroyo and halting her trial.)  The Philippine Supreme Court said a
temporary restraining order blocking the arrest of suspects in a
plunder case doesn’t apply to former President Gloria Arroyo,
who was arraigned on the charge today.  Supreme Court spokeswoman Gleo Guerra said the restraining
order applies only to Nilda B. Plaras, an audit commission
official who was charged along with Arroyo for alleged misuse of
charity funds. Guerra corrected a statement made earlier today
that the restraining order also applied to Arroyo.  Arroyo was charged in July with diverting 366 million pesos
($8.87 million) of charity funds for personal gain, and has been
under arrest in the hospital since Oct. 4. She spent eight
months under hospital arrest on separate charges of election
fraud before being freed in July because of a lack of evidence.  The former president didn’t enter a plea during her
arraignment at the anti-graft court today. The court entered a
plea of not guilty on her behalf.  To contact the reporter on this story:
