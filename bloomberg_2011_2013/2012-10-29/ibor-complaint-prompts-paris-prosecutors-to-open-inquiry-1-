Paris prosecutors opened a
preliminary inquiry over manipulation of the London interbank
offered rates, or Libor, after a complaint by a  Societe Generale
SA (GLE)  shareholder.  The July complaint, which didn’t name a target, claims that
lenders engaged in market manipulation related to Libor, among
other allegations, Frederik Karel Canoy, the investor’s lawyer,
said today.  “All the banks participated,” Canoy, who traditionally
represents small shareholders, said by phone. “They manipulated
the rates higher and lower.” The Paris inquiry was opened in
September and is in the hands of the financial unit, he said.  Regulators across the globe are investigating claims banks
altered submissions that were used to set Libor in an effort to
benefit traders, or to appear financially healthier than they
were.  Barclays Plc (BARC)  paid a 290 million-pound ($466 million) fine
in June to settle with British and U.S. regulators over rate
rigging. Sixteen banks have been subpoenaed in investigations by
U.S. states attorneys.  Spokeswomen for the prosecutors’ office and Societe
Generale didn’t immediately return calls seeking comment.  The investigation was reported earlier by  Paris Match 
magazine.  Shaken Confidence  Confidence in Libor, the benchmark interest rate for more
than $360 trillion of securities, was shaken following
Barclays’s admission. The revelations provoked calls for tougher
oversight of the financial system and pushed regulatory and
criminal probes of Libor and other interbank lending rates, such
as Euribor, to the top of the political agenda.  Germany ’s parliament has scheduled a hearing for Nov. 28 on
the issue,  Frankfurter Rundschau  reported today. The lawmakers
have asked Deutsche Bank AG co-Chief Executive Officer Anshu Jain to testify, according to the newspaper.  The European Union has also taken action, with Competition
Commissioner Joaquin Almunia opening probes to see if rate
manipulation included cartel behavior. Michel Barnier, the
bloc’s financial services chief, has urged swift adoption of a
law adding jail time to tougher penalties to prevent any repeat
of the scandal engulfing Libor and other interbank rates. The
legislation would empower courts to hand jail terms to those
found guilty of market abuse and insider dealing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
