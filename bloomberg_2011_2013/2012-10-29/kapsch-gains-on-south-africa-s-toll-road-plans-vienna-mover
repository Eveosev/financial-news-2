Kapsch TrafficCom (KTCG)  AG, an Austrian
maker of road-toll systems that’s a supplier to the South
African road operator, rose by the most in two months after
 South Africa ’s government said it will proceed with plans for
toll roads around Johannesburg and  Pretoria .  Kapsch rose as much as 5 percent, the biggest increase
since Aug. 31 and traded 4.6 percent higher at 43.95 euros by
11:39 a.m. in Vienna. The stock capped four straight sessions of
losses, which saw it lose 10 percent. The Vienna bourse was
closed for a holiday Oct. 26.  South Africa last week said the South African National
Roads Agency SOC Ltd., could start electronic road tolls
following a 30-day public consultation over the plan. The
government cut planned fees to quell opposition from labor
unions and consumer groups.  “It’s positive because they also announced the launch of
the system,” said Daniel Lion, an analyst at Erste Group Bank
AG in Vienna, who recommends buying Kapsch shares. “The fact
that the fees are lowered has an impact for Kapsch only in the
 Czech Republic , where some bonus payments are linked to the toll
revenue.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
