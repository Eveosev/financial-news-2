London Array, the largest offshore
wind park approved in the world, produced its first power as
backers Dong Energy A/S, Masdar  Abu Dhabi  Future Energy Co. and
EON AG seek to curb technology costs by building at scale.  The first 630-megawatt phase of the venture in the Thames
Estuary will produce enough power for more than 470,000 homes
when completed at the end of the year, the companies said today
in a joint statement. The facility has approval for 1 gigawatt
of turbines at the site off the Kent and Essex coasts.  Developers of offshore wind are planning projects with more
turbines to help lower the costs of the technology, among the
most expensive of renewable sources. It costs 161 euros ($208)
to produce a megawatt-hour of offshore wind power, according to
Bloomberg New Energy Finance. The U.K. government is trying to
get that down to 100 pounds ($161) a megawatt-hour by 2020.  “Being able to efficiently develop large offshore wind
farms and harvest the scale advantages in both construction and
operation is an important element in our continuous efforts to
bring down costs of energy of offshore wind,” Benj Sykes, U.K.
wind manager at Danish utility Dong, said in the statement.  EON U.K. Chief Executive Officer Tony Cocker said the
project would help achieve a goal of cutting costs 40 percent by
2015. Dong owns 50 percent, EON 30 percent and Masdar, Abu
Dhabi’s renewable energy initiative, 20 percent, with 151
turbines now installed, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
