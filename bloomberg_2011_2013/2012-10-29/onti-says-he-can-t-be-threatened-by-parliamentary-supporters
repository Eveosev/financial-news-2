Italian Prime Minister  Mario Monti ,
facing a challenge from former premier  Silvio Berlusconi , said
he can’t be threatened by parliamentary backers pushing for
changes to government austerity policy.  “Threats to withdraw support can’t be made to this
government,” Monti said today at a press conference in  Madrid .
“You can’t call it a threat because, and I think I speak for my
fellow ministers, the only thing it would take away is a
government that we didn’t ask for.”  Monti, in the 11th month of his caretaker government, is
being pressed to relax his austerity measures. The two main
parties in the ruling coalition are shaping campaign messages as
Italy prepares to pick Monti’s successor in national elections
by April. Berlusconi, whose party is the government’s No. 1
parliamentary supporter, said on Oct. 27 that Monti’s austerity
is deepening Italy’s recession.  “We will consider these facts and decide whether to
immediately withdraw our support of the government,” said
Berlusconi.  The difference in yield between Italian and German 10-year
bonds widened 16 basis points to 352 basis points at 4:42 p.m.
in  Rome .  Berlusconi delivered his challenge at a press conference a
day after he was found guilty by a Milan court of fraud in a
television rights trial. Berlusconi’s threat to bring down the
government has divided his People of Liberty Party.  Franco Frattini , a former foreign affairs minister under Berlusconi,
said in an interview today with Corriere della Sera newspaper
that Monti is a guarantee of credibility for Italy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
