The U.S. Supreme Court agreed to
decide whether three energy companies are entitled to more than
$500 million in tax credits for payments their subsidiaries made
to the U.K. government during the 1990s.  The justices today said they will hear an appeal from  PPL
Corp. (PPL) , which took a $39 million charge after a federal appeals
court ruled against the company.  Entergy Corp. (ETR)  is claiming a
$234 million credit in a similar legal fight, winning a ruling
from a different appeals court.  American Electric Power Co. (AEP)  has yet to go to court in its
fight over $285 million it paid in U.K. taxes. The company is
seeking less than that in U.S. tax credits, said Kevin
Kenworthy, an attorney for AEP.  The issue stems from a windfall tax paid in 1997 and 1998
by utilities in the U.K. that had recently become private
companies. The question is whether those payments qualify under
a U.S. provision that lets companies take a credit for income
taxes they pay abroad.  The Obama administration joined Allentown, Pennsylvania-
based PPL in urging the Supreme Court to resolve the
disagreement between the appeals courts.  The case is PPL v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue
Service, 12-43.  To contact the reporter on this story:
