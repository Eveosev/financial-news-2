TransCanada Corp. (TRP)  and a unit of
PetroChina Co. Ltd. agreed to develop a C$3 billion ($3 billion)
oil pipeline to ship crude from oil-sands projects in northern
 Alberta .  TransCanada and Phoenix Energy Holdings Ltd. will each own
50 percent of the proposed Grand Rapids Pipeline, which will
ship oil 500 kilometers (310 miles) from the Fort McMurray oil-
sands production area to  Edmonton , according to a statement
yesterday.  The stake would be the largest taken by a Chinese company
in a Canadian pipeline, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
PetroChina expects to produce 400,000 barrels a day from its
Dover and MacKay River oil-sands developments near Fort
McMurray, according to a  website  for the projects.  “Transportation in the Athabasca region has become a
bottleneck,” Zhiming Li, the chief executive officer of
Phoenix, said in the statement. “This transportation solution
will be important to Phoenix and other potential producers in
the area to monetize their huge resources.”  The plan includes a 900,000 barrel-a-day crude pipeline,
and a 330,000 barrel-a-day pipeline for diluent, fluids mixed
with tar-like bitumen so it can flow through pipelines. The
project is expected to be in service by 2017.  Pipeline Project  “This is the first major pipeline project to meet the
needs of this fast-growing area,” TransCanada Chief Executive
Officer  Russ Girling  said in the statement.  TransCanada, based in Calgary, will operate the system and
Phoenix has agreed to ship crude on it. Phoenix is a unit of
publicly traded PetroChina, controlled by Chinese state-owned
China National Petroleum Corp., according to filings. CNPC owns
a controlling interest in PetroChina.  In March, PetroChina bought the interest it didn’t own in
MacKay River through its joint venture with Athabasca Oil Corp.
Dover Operating Corp., owned by Athabasca Oil and PetroChina,
runs the projects.  Margaret Jia, a spokeswoman for CNPC companies in  Canada ,
didn’t return telephone calls seeking comment.  TransCanada rose 1 percent to C$44.83 at the close in
Toronto in yesterday.  To contact the reporters on this story:
