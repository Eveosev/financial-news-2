Bulgaria  sold three-quarters of its
33 percent stake in the local distribution unit of  CEZ AS (CEZ) , the
largest Czech power producer, in the first day of an auction on
the Bulgarian Stock Exchange.  The state sold 48,074 shares in the power distribution
unit, CEZ Razpredelenie Bulgaria, at an average price of
1,605.85 lev ($1,060) a share, the Sofia-based bourse said in an
e-mail today, bringing the sale value to 77.2 million lev.  Bulgaria also sold about 34 percent of the stake, or 560
shares, in grid operating unit CEZ Electro Bulgaria at an
average price of 9485.37 lev a share, the bourse said, bringing
the sale’s value to 5.3 million lev. The manager is Sofia-based
 Central Cooperative Bank AD (4CF)  and 31 brokers bought shares.  The government sold its minority stakes in most of the
seven power distributors, after selling majority stakes in 2005
to  Germany ’s  E.ON AG (EOAN) , CEZ AS and  EVN AG (EVN)  in the run-up to joining
the European Union.  The government expects to raise at least 100 million lev
from the CEZ units’ sale, Privatization Agency Executive
Director Emil Karanikolov said in an interview on Oct. 3.  Bulgaria sold the minority stakes in the two units
controlled by EVN for about 93 million lev nine months ago and
got about 70 million lev from selling minority stakes in the two
companies run by Czech utility Energo-Pro three weeks ago.  E.ON sold its Bulgarian companies to Energo-Pro last year.  Bulgaria, which weathered the global crisis without
borrowing from international lenders, is working to cut the
budget gap to 1.3 percent of gross domestic product this year,
after 2.1 percent in 2011, to help contain the impact from the
euro-area crisis.  To contact the reporter on this story:
