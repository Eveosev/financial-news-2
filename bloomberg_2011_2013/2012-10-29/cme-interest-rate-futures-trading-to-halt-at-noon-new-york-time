CME Group Inc. (CME) , the world’s largest
futures market, will cease interest-rate contract trading at
noon New York time today as Hurricane Sandy approaches the U.S.
East Coast.  Eurodollar, Treasury and federal funds futures contracts
will cease trading on the floor of the exchange and
electronically, the Chicago-based company said in an e-mailed
statement. The move aligns the exchange with the Securities
Industry and Financial Markets Association’s recommended closing
of the bond market at noon, CME Group said.  The exchange will accept for clearing credit-default and
interest-rate swaps until 7 p.m. EST, with settlement curves
calculated at noon tomorrow.  CME Group closed its equity-index futures trading at 9:15
a.m. today to match the shut-down in U.S. stock markets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
