Oil options volatility rose as crude
futures declined as U.S. East Coast refineries shut and reduced
rates before Hurricane Sandyâ€™s arrival tonight.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
December, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a
gauge of options prices, was 31.74 percent on the  New York 
Mercantile Exchange at 4:15 p.m. compared with 28.94 percent on
Oct. 26.  Crude oil for December delivery fell 0.9 percent to $85.54
a barrel as  Phillips 66 (PSX) ,  NuStar Energy LP (NS) ,  Hess Corp. (HES) ,
Philadelphia Energy Solutions and  PBF Energy Inc. (PBF)  shut or
reduced output at refineries and terminals in Delaware, New
Jersey and Pennsylvania.  The most-active options in electronic trading today were
March $88 puts, which rose 46 cents to $6.74 a barrel on volume
of 2,020 lots. December $99.50 calls were the second-most active
options. They were unchanged at 7 cents on movement of 2,008
lots.  Puts, or bets that prices will fall, accounted for 54
percent of the 28,675 contracts that changed hands.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on open-
outcry volume, where the bulk of options activity occurs.  In the previous session, calls made up 60 percent of the
87,263 contracts traded.  December $135 calls were the most actively traded the
previous session, with 4,743 lots exchanged. They rose 1 cent to

68,123 contracts. Next were December $80 puts with 46,554 lots
