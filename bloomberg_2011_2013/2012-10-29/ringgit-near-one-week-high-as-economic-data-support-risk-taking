Malaysia’s ringgit traded near a
one-week high after U.S. and Chinese economic data suggested
global growth is picking up, boosting demand for riskier assets.  The net income of Chinese industrial companies rose 7.8
percent in September from a year earlier to 464 billion  yuan 
($74 billion), the first increase in six months, according to a
report released Oct 27 in Beijing. U.S. gross domestic product
grew at a 2 percent annual rate in the third quarter, compared
with the 1.8 percent gain forecast in a Bloomberg survey,
official data showed Oct. 26.  “The U.S. has been a little bit positive in terms of the
numbers and Chinese industrial profits showed signs things are
improving,” said Choong Yin Pheng, senior manager for fixed
income and economic research at Hong Leong Bank Bhd. in Kuala
Lumpur. “That’s helping risk appetite.”  The ringgit strengthened 0.3 percent to 3.0488 per dollar
as of 9:05 a.m. in Kuala Lumpur, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. It closed at 3.0430 on Oct. 25 and touched 3.0368,
the strongest since Oct. 19. The market was shut on Oct. 26 for
a public holiday. One-month implied volatility, a measure of
exchange-rate swings used to price options, fell 10 basis points
to 5.90 percent.  Government bonds advanced Oct 25. The yield on the 3.314
percent notes due October 2017 dropped two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 3.24 percent, according to Bursa Malaysia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
