Israeli benchmark bonds rose,
pushing the yield to the lowest in almost three months, on
speculation the central bank will keep borrowing costs unchanged
today to stimulate the economy.  The yield on the 5.5 percent Mimshal Shiklit notes maturing
in January 2022 fell three basis points, or 0.03 percentage
point, to 4.05 percent at 1:20 p.m. in Tel Aviv, the lowest
level since Aug. 6.  One-year  interest-rate swaps , an indicator
of investor expectations for rates over the period, dropped
three basis points to 2.11 percent, the lowest since Aug. 29.  Policy makers will probably keep the key  interest rate 
unchanged today at 2.25 percent for a fourth consecutive month,
according to all 24 analysts  surveyed  by Bloomberg.  Israel ’s
economic growth is set to decline to 3.5 percent this year from
4.6 percent in 2011, according to statistics bureau estimates,
as  Europe  contends with a debt crisis and global growth slows.
Exports comprise 40 percent of Israel’s gross domestic product,
and Europe is one its top markets.  “The  Bank of Israel  is expected to leave interest rates
low for a longer period as the economy grows at a moderate pace
and inflation is intact,” said Alex Zabezhinsky, chief
economist at DS Securities & Investments Ltd. in Tel Aviv.
“This environment is giving preference to longer-term bonds
over shorter-term.”  Bond Auction  The  Finance Ministry  sold a combined 1.55 billion shekels
($399 million) in bonds today, bringing this month’s fundraising
total to 6 billion shekels, according to ministry data posted on
Bloomberg. Investors sought 7.9 times the 200 million shekels of
3.5 percent bonds due August 2014 on sale compared with 9.9
times at the last auction on Oct. 22. The yield on the notes
increased one basis point to 2.21 percent.  The central bank, which will announce its rate decision at
5:30 p.m. local time, had lowered the base lending rate from
3.25 percent from September 2011 through June. Annual inflation
accelerated to 2.1 percent in September, less than expected, the
statistics bureau said Oct. 15. The government’s target range is
1 percent to 3 percent.  The two-year break-even rate, the yield difference between
the inflation-linked bonds and fixed-rate government debt of
similar maturity, declined five basis points to 230, implying an
average annual inflation rate of 2.3 percent.  The  Tel Aviv  Bond 40 Index, which measures inflation-linked
and fixed-rate corporate bonds, was little changed at 276.78.
The shekel weakened 0.3 percent to 3.8872 a dollar, trimming
this month’s gain to 0.8 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
