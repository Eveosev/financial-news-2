Terra Mauricia Ltd. (TERA) , a Mauritian
 investment company , plans to build or buy a third sugar factory
in  Africa  at a cost of about $200 million as growth in its
domestic market peaks.  “We currently have four projects under review in Eastern
and Central Africa,” Strategic Development Executive Sebastien Mamet said in an interview yesterday, in Port Louis, the
capital.  Terra’s agricultural unit is the largest producer of
specialty sugars in the Indian Ocean island nation, with output
forecast to reach 90,825 metric tons in 2012, and expansion will
be best achieved outside Mauritius, Mamet said.  “Governments in some African countries are keen to develop
the sugar sector in their countries and consequently facilitate
investments,” he said. “The political climate is improving and
the continent is a net buyer of sugar.”  While Terra’s loss widened to 125 million rupees ($4
million) for the six months through June from 81.2 million
rupees a year earlier, the company had assets of 14.34 billion
rupees.  “We don’t have any  debt ,” Mamet said. “To finance the
project we expect to raise half through loans and the difference
in equity.”  The group has a 25 percent stake Sucrivoire SA, which owns
two sugar mills in Ivory Coast, catering for about half of the
country’s domestic requirements. Output is expected to rise to
93,000 tons in 2012 from 90,000 tons a year earlier.  “Our first choice will be to buy an existing mill,
otherwise we will have to start from scratch,” Mamet said.  The  stock  is the best performer of four sugar-related
companies on the 40-member  SEMDEX (SEMDEX)  index of the Mauritius Stock
Exchange. Terra declined 0.8 percent to 39.10 rupees, trimming
gains this year to 2.4 percent compared with an 11 percent drop
in the index, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
