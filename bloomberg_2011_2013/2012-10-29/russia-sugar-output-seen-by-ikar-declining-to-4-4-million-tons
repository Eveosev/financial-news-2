Russia , which started beet-sugar
exports last year, will reduce domestic output of the sweetener
to 4.4 million to 4.7 million metric tons due to a weaker crop
this season, the Institute for Agricultural Market Studies said.  Russia had a record sugar output of almost 5.1 million tons
in the last marketing year that ended July 31, according to the
institute data.  Drought earlier this year prompted smaller beet yields and
the total crop is seen at 41.5 million tons, said  Evgeny Ivanov ,
an analyst at the institute, known as Ikar. That compares with
47.6 million tons a year earlier, he said, citing the Federal
State Statistics data. Excessive rains in the country’s south in
August and September washed out sweetener content in the roots,
which will lower the sugar output from the beets, Ivanov said by
phone in Moscow today.  Farmers will reduce beet planting in favor of grains and
oilseeds to about 1 million hectares (2.47 million acres) for
the 2013 crop, down from 1.14 million hectares planted for the
2012 crop, Ivanov said.  Russia’s sugar consumption is seen at 5.5 million tons in
the 2012-13 season that started Aug. 1, exports may be 150,000
tons or less, and imports of white sugar are seen at about
280,000 tons, or the same as in the preceding season, Ivanov
said.  Imports of the raw sugar are expected to be at least
350,000 tons, he said. “Imports depend on actual beet-sugar
production and will be just enough to cover domestic needs in
the sweetener,” Ivanov said. Last season, Russia imported
438,000 tons of raw sugar, according to Ikar data.  Farmers harvested 31.7 million tons of sugar-beets from 73
percent of the sown area by Oct. 26, Agriculture Ministry data
show. Yields dropped to 38.18 tons a hectare from 38.33 tons a
hectare a year earlier, the ministry said on its  website  last
week.  Last year, Russia shipped more than 300,000 tons of sugar,
according to Agriculture Ministry data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
