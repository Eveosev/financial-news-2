The Labor Department in the U.S.
will wait to gauge the full impact of  Hurricane Sandy  before
determining the status of the October jobs report.  “We will assess the situation when the weather emergency
is over and notify the press and public of any changes at that
time,” Labor Department spokesman Gary Steinberg said in an e-
mailed statement.  The monthly employment report is currently slated to be
released on Nov. 2 at 8:30 a.m. in  Washington . The median
forecasts of economists surveyed by Bloomberg call for payrolls
to rise by 125,000 workers in October and for the  jobless rate 
to increase to 7.9 percent from a three-year low of 7.8 percent
reached in September.  Federal government agencies in Washington were closed today
as Hurricane Sandy, the Atlantic’s largest-ever tropical storm,
approached the East Coast.  To contact the reporter on this story:
