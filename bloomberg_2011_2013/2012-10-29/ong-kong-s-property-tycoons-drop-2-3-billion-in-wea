The six richest property developers in Hong Kong lost a combined $2.2 billion in net worth today as  shares  in their companies dived after the government imposed a property tax on overseas buyers.  The wealthiest man in Asia,  Li Ka-shing , saw his net worth decline $748 million to $26.3 billion from Friday, as shares in  Cheung Kong Holdings Ltd. (1)  slid 4.7 percent at the end of trading in Hong Kong, according to the  Bloomberg Billionaires Index . Henderson Land Development Co. Chairman Lee Shau-kee dropped $462 million to $22.7 billion. New World Development Co. founder Cheng Yu-tung slid $188 million to $17.3 billion.  The city ordered its third set of property curbs in two months after  home prices  almost doubled over three years to become the world’s most expensive. Hong Kong Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying, who vowed to halt a housing bubble when he ran for office this year, imposed the first property tax aimed at overseas investors, a 15 percent duty upon purchase, on Oct. 26. A resale tax was raised by about 5 percentage points.  “It’s time to sell” property stocks, Andrew Lawrence, Hong Kong-based analyst at Barclays Plc, wrote in an Oct. 27 report. “The government has finally become serious about demand-side measures.”  Other Hong Kong property magnates also suffered losses. Robert Kuok, who controls 55 percent of Kerry Properties, fell $202 million to $13.5 billion. Sun Hung Kai Properties co- chairmen Thomas and Raymond Kwok lost a combined $594 million to $15.8 billion. The brothers were charged with bribery in July by the city’s Independent Commission Against Corruption. The Kwoks deny wrongdoing. A court hearing is scheduled for Jan. 25.  The city’s home prices are 65 percent higher than  Tokyo ’s, the world’s second-priciest place to buy a home, according to a study by  Savills Plc (SVS)  published last month that compares prices in 10 global cities including New York and  London .
