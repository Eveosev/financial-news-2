In late August 1932, George Foster Peabody, a major figure in railway and electric-power development, wrote a  letter  to the  New York  Times, criticizing President  Herbert Hoover 's response to the Great Depression. Peabody’s conclusion was stark: “I am thus thoroughly convinced that Mr. Hoover is incompetent.” Meanwhile, support for New York Governor  Franklin D. Roosevelt , the Democratic presidential candidate, was growing. The Economist  wrote : “Mr. Roosevelt has plunged boldly into the trenches and is arousing enthusiasm by the energy of his personal raids on the enemy's lines.” The New York Times  echoed  this view: “The Democrats are on the offensive. . . . The Republicans have yet to bring up their heavy artillery.” Hoover had planned to campaign from the White House, but the success of Roosevelt’s  Western tour  forced him out of  Washington . Hoover delivered his first campaign speech in his home state,  Iowa , on Oct. 4, just five weeks before Election Day. After he noted that he was born during the 1874 depression, Hoover got down to  brass tacks  about the current economic crisis: Stern words delivered in combative language. But would it be enough? While Hoover presented himself as too busy fighting the Depression from the White House to waste precious time campaigning for re-election, Roosevelt took an engaged approach to campaigning, traveling thousands of miles and delivering scores of public addresses to huge crowds. At a speech in Indianapolis on Oct. 20, he appeared calm, clear and confident of victory. He  said : Roosevelt said Hoover’s policies represented a “brood of disaster-producing gambles with national prosperity." Instead, he promised: The Economist  ruled  the election's outcome decided: “No Republican candidate at this late stage of the campaign has ever looked so badly beaten as Mr. Hoover.” How right that was.
