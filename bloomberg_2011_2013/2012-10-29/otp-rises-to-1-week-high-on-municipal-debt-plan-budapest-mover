OTP Bank Nyrt. (OTP) , Hungary’s largest
lender, rose to the strongest in more than a week after Prime
Minister  Viktor Orban  said the government will take over debt
from local governments.  The shares climbed 3.2 percent to 4,180 forint by the close
in Budapest, the highest since Oct. 17 and extending its gains
this month to 7.3 percent. Traders bought and sold 2.2 million
shares, more than 144 percent of the stock’s three-month daily
average. The benchmark BUX stock  index , in which OTP has a 29
percent weighting, added 1.2 percent.  Orban’s government, which has been working to cut the
biggest sovereign debt burden in the east of the European Union,
is extending its “war” on liabilities by taking over $2.8
billion in local council debt, Orban said on Oct. 27. The plan
may boost OTP’s earnings by helping to cut provisions made for
municipal bad debt, said Szabolcs Vaszko, a Budapest-based
equities trader at Erste Group Bank AG.  “The plan may create a one-off improvement in OTP’s
profits, which is probably behind the rally,” Vaszko said by
phone.  Hungary ’s currency depreciated 1.1 percent to per euro
after the announcement of the municipal plan and on concern
Hungary won’t obtain international aid.  “On a macroeconomic level, the municipal debt plan isn’t
necessarily positive,” Vaszko said, citing the potential impact
on the central government budget.  To contact the reporter on this story:
