The cost of insuring corporate bonds
in Japan from non-payment fell, according to traders of credit-
default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index dropped 1.5 basis point to
206.5 basis points as of 9:32 a.m. in  Tokyo , Deutsche Bank AG
prices show. The gauge, which has ranged from 136.2 to 229.5
this year, is on track for its lowest close since Oct. 25,
according to CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index was little changed at 143
as of 11:04 a.m. in Sydney, according to  Westpac Banking Corp. (WBC) 
The measure has ranged from 128.2 to 211.1 this year, according
to data provider CMA, which is owned by McGraw-Hill Cos. and
compiles prices quoted by dealers in the privately negotiated
market.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan was also little changed at 123 basis
points as of 8:21 a.m. in  Hong Kong , Credit Agricole SA prices
show. The index rose 6.3 basis points last week, CMA prices
show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
