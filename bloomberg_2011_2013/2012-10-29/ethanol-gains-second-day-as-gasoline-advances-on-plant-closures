Ethanol futures gained for a second
day in Chicago as gasoline jumped on concern that  Hurricane
Sandy  will curtail supply.  The biofuel followed the motor fuel higher as refiners
including Phillips 66 and PBF Energy Inc. reduced output before
the arrival of the storm. Ethanol is blended with gasoline to
stretch supply and meet federal mandates.  “Sandy’s affecting it,” said  Dan Flynn , a trader at Price
Futures Group in Chicago. “We don’t know what we’re going to
have.”  Denatured ethanol for November delivery increased 0.4 cent
to $2.385 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade. Futures have
gained 8.3 percent this year.  In cash market trading, ethanol in New York added 2 cents,
or 0.8 percent, to $2.47 a gallon and in the U.S. Gulf the
biofuel rose 1.5 cents, or 0.6 percent, to $2.46, data compiled
by Bloomberg shows.  Ethanol in Chicago climbed 0.5 cent to $2.385 a gallon and
on the West Coast the additive declined 1.5 cents, or 0.6
percent, to $2.53.  Gasoline for November delivery advanced 5.77 cents, or 2.1
percent, to $2.7568 a gallon in  New York . The contract covers
reformulated gasoline, made to be blended with ethanol before
delivery to filling stations.  Ethanol-blended gasoline made up about 93 percent of the
total U.S. gasoline pool last week, the Energy Department said
Oct. 24. The 2012 high is 95 percent in the week ended Oct. 5.  Corn for December delivery was little changed, down 0.75
cent to $7.37 a bushel in Chicago. One bushel makes at least
2.75 gallons of ethanol.  Based on December contracts for ethanol and corn, producers
are losing about 31 cents on each gallon of the biofuel made,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That doesn’t include
profit from the sale of dried distillers’ grains, a byproduct of
ethanol production that can be fed to livestock.  To contact the reporter on this story:
