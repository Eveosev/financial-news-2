Housing Finance Ltd. (HFCL) ,  Kenya ’s only
publicly traded mortgage lender, jumped to its highest level in
more than four months on plans to continue raising capital.  Shares climbed 3.2 percent to 16.25 shillings by 11:30 a.m.
in Nairobi, the highest since June 22.  The stock has rallied 9.8 percent since the company said
Oct. 16 that it raised 5.2 billion shillings ($61 million)
compared with a target of 2.95 billion shillings in a bond sale.
Housing Finance is in talks for $20 million for onward lending
in foreign currency, Managing Director Frank Ireri said Oct. 23.  “The news that the bond was oversubscribed has encouraged
buyers to step in,” Aly Khan Satchu, chief executive officer of
Rich Management Ltd., a Nairobi-based adviser to companies and
high net-worth individuals, said by phone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
