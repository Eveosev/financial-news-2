A cargo ship that went missing
yesterday in the Sea of Okhotsk was ferrying about 700 tons of
golden ore that belonged to  Polymetal International Plc (POLY) , a
Russian gold miner on  London ’s FTSE 100 index.  The vessel was carrying ore mined at the Avlayakan deposit,
the St. Petersburg-based company said in an e-mailed statement
today. “Responsibility for the cargo lies with the freight
carrier,” according to the statement.  The dry-cargo freighter Amurskaya, operated by a company
based in Nikolayevsk-on-Amur, was en route to Okhotsk from the
port of Kiran with nine people on board when it disappeared near
the Shantar Islands. The authorities deployed aircraft and ships
for a search operation that has so far brought no “negative or
positive results,” Alexander Khokhlov, an official at the port
of Nikolayevsk-on-Amur in the Khabarovsk region, said by phone.  The incident won’t cause a substantial loss for Polymetal,
according to Nikolay Sosnovskiy, an analyst at VTB Capital.
Based on Polymetal’s earlier estimate for the Avlayakan deposit,
the lost cargo contained gold worth an estimated $800,000,
Sosnovskiy said by phone.  Polymetal and the port declined to comment on what cargo
and ship insurance was in effect.  To contact the reporter on this story:
