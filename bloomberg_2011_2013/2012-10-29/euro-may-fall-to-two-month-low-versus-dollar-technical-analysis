The euro may decline a two-month low
against the dollar should it break below an area of so-called
support, Commerzbank AG said, citing trading patterns.  The 17-nation currency would be poised to drop more than 3
percent if its weakens below its 200-day moving average,
currently at $1.2835, and this month’s low of $1.2804, according
to Karen Jones, head of foreign-exchange, fixed-income and
commodities technical analysis at Commerzbank in  London .  “Failure here would be viewed as negative and target
$1.2472/44 supports,” she said. The level of $1.2472 represents
the 61.8 percent retracement of the euro’s advance from July 24
to Sept. 17, Jones said, referring to Fibonacci theory.  The  euro  traded at $1.2898 at 12:28 p.m. in London after
rising to $1.3172 on Sept. 17, the highest level since May 4.
The last time it traded below $1.2472 was on Aug. 28.  The common currency has closed above its 200-day moving
average every day since Sept. 11.  Fibonacci analysis is based on the theory that prices rise
or fall by certain percentages after reaching a new high or a
low. Support refers to an area where analysts predict that buy
orders may be clustered.  In technical analysis, investors study charts of trading
patterns and prices to forecast changes in a bond, commodity,
currency or index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
