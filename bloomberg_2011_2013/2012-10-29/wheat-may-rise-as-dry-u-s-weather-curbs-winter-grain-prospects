Wheat may rise for the first time in
three sessions as dry weather in the U.S. southern Great Plains
cuts prospects for recently planted winter varieties.  Parts of  Kansas , the biggest grower of winter wheat in the
U.S., and  Oklahoma  have received little or no rainfall in the
past 30 days, National Weather Service data show. That may
prevent plants from establishing roots into the dry soil. The
crop is sown in September and October, goes dormant for the
winter and then starts growing again in April.  “If we don’t get some of these fall rains, you can’t count
on winter replenishing soil moisture,” Jason Britt, the
president of Central States Commodities Inc. in Kansas City,
 Missouri , said by telephone. “They’re still in drought. That’s
become a lot bigger story because we’re going to need to produce
normal crops.”  Wheat futures for December delivery rose less than 0.1
percent to $8.645 a bushel at 10:08 a.m. on the Chicago Board of
Trade. The price through Oct. 26 was down 4.3 percent in
October.  In the U.S., wheat is the fourth-largest crop, valued at
$14.4 billion in 2011, behind corn, soybeans and hay, government
data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
