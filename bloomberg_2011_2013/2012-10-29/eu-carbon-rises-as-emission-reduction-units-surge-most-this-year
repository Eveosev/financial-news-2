European Union carbon permits rose
to their highest since Oct. 18 as the market’s regulator in
Brussels plans to temporarily delay supply sold at auctions.  EU allowances for December rose 19 cents, or 2.4 percent,
to close at 8.08 euros ($10.42) a metric ton on the ICE Futures
Europe exchange in  London . United Nations Certified Emission
Reductions for the same month increased 13 percent to 97 euro
cents a ton. Emission Reduction Units gained 20 percent to close
at 73 cents a ton, the biggest jump since Dec. 20.  EU carbon may rise this week as high as 8.40 euros as the
European Commission considers a temporary reduction in supply
starting next year or in 2014, according to Bloomberg New Energy
Finance. The allowances may alternatively drop as low as 7.60
euros a ton, Konrad Hanschmidt, an analyst at the London
research company, said today in an e-mailed research note.  “The market is becoming more volatile ahead of the
backloading proposal release on Nov. 14,” Hanschmidt said.
“The volume of backloading is likely to be kept a closely
guarded secret until the official release of the proposal. There
is room for a surprise.”  Traders expect supply of about 750 million tons will be
held back, according to a New Energy Finance survey. Still, the
final number may be as little as 400 million tons and as much as
1.2 billion, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
