Whether they favor President  Barack Obama  or Republican challenger  Mitt Romney  in the Nov. 6
election, bond investors are better off now than four years ago.  From Treasuries to mortgage securities to corporate bonds,
returns on U.S. fixed-income assets have averaged 6.5 percent
throughout Obama’s term, exceeding the 4.6 percent during the
previous four years under  George W. Bush , according to Bank of
America Merrill Lynch indexes. Yields on America’s fixed-income
assets yield seven basis points less than the global average,
compared with 51 basis points more back then, the data shows.  Supported by $2.3 trillion of bond purchases by the  Federal
Reserve  and Obama’s $787 billion fiscal stimulus, corporate
borrowing has revived, as have commercial and industrial  loans ,
and  mortgage rates  are at record lows amid signs that housing is
starting to improve with  consumer confidence . Obama backs the
Fed while Romney said he wouldn’t reappoint Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  to a third term in 2014.  “It’s been a spectacular four years for the  bond market ,”
Robert Tipp, chief investment strategist in  Newark ,  New Jersey ,
for Prudential Financial Inc.’s fixed-income division, which
oversees $335 billion, said in an Oct. 26 telephone interview.
“In the U.S. the risk isn’t so much the economy, which is doing
reasonably well,” he said. “The risk is policy makers are
tapped out.”  ‘Depression Levels’  Prudential is buying investment-grade obligations of
financial firms and structured debt, Tipp said. Four years ago,
when the insurer managed about $200 billion, he was buying high-
quality corporate bonds “trading at depression levels” and
commercial mortgage-backed securities.  Fixed-income assets are rallying even as companies step up
borrowing and government debt swells to  $16 trillion , from $10.6
trillion four years ago. The Fed said in a statement Oct. 24
that benchmark  interest rates  about zero “are likely to be
warranted at least through mid-2015,” indicating its policies
will continue to contain yields.  Individuals poured $168.9 billion into taxable fixed-income
mutual funds from January through August, up from $135.2 billion
for all of 2011 and compared with $10.8 billion in 2008,
according to Investment Company Institute data.  Even as the Fed has printed money to buy bonds, inflation
remains quiescent with consumer prices rising at an average
annual rate of 1.6 percent since 2009, compared with a 3.3
percent pace the previous four years, government data show.  Falling Yields  Treasury 10-year  yields  declined 2 basis points last week,
or 0.02 percentage point, to 1.75 percent, and are down from
about 4 percent four years ago. The yield was three basis points
lower at 1.71 percent as of 9:55 a.m. in  New York .  U.S. government debt securities have returned 24.2 percent
since the end of October 2008, including reinvested interest, or
5.59 percent a year, Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s U.S. Master
Index shows. That compares with 21.4 percent for government debt
worldwide, according to the firm’s indexes.  “By almost any measure of bond market performance, the
markets are stronger now than they were then,” said  James Kochan , chief fixed-income strategist at Wells Fargo Funds
Management LLC in Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin, in an Oct. 23
telephone interview.  Relative Strength  Treasury yields, which were already at record lows when
Obama took office, have fallen as the worsening European
sovereign debt crisis and the relative strength and stability of
the U.S. boosted demand for dollar-denominated assets.  Yields on U.S. fixed-income assets average 1.62 percent on
Oct. 25, lower than the global average of 1.69 percent, Bank of
America bond indexes show. When Obama took office the average
for American debt securities was 3.93 percent, above global
average of 3.41 percent.  This year’s performance in U.S. bonds exceeds the 5.7
percent gain in Europe and the 2 percent in Japan. Returns under
Obama are the highest since the 7.5 percent average during  Bill Clinton ’s second term, according to Bank of America indexes.  Where else except the U.S. “can you invest your money at a
high investment-grade in large sums and be sure you’ll get your
money back in the future?” asked  Chris Ahrens , an interest-rate
strategist at UBS Securities LLC in Stamford, Connecticut, a
primary dealer. “It’s money good.”  ‘Panic Mode’  The Fed’s QE program started two months after the collapse
of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., with a November 2008
commitment to buy $500 billion of mortgage securities and $100
billion of debentures of  Fannie Mae  and  Freddie Mac .  Policy makers raised the purchase targets in March 2009 to
$1.25 trillion of mortgage bonds, $200 billion of agency debt
and added $300 billion of Treasuries. In November 2010, the Fed
announced it would acquire $600 billion of Treasuries.  “The markets really were in a  panic mode ,” said James Sarni, senior managing partner at Payden & Rygel in Los Angeles,
which manages $60 billion, in an Oct. 23 telephone interview.
“The Fed has been very effective and has done a good job of
keeping the markets from disintegrating.”  At the same time, Obama pushed through a $787 billion
stimulus package including tax cuts and increases in spending.  Gross domestic product is forecast to expand 2.1 percent
this year, compared with 1.8 percent in 2011, according to the
median estimate of 89 economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  Rising Confidence  Confidence among U.S. consumers rose in October to the
highest level since before the last recession began five years
ago, with the Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan final
 sentiment index  climbing to 82.6.  A Gallup poll of registered voters released Oct. 26, or
nine days before the election, showed the race between Obama and
Romney in a dead heat. The poll of about 3,050, which has a
margin of error of two percentage points, showed 48 percent of
respondents would vote for Obama and 48 percent for Romney if
the election were held that day.  The trade-offs from the monetary and fiscal stimulus are
the risk of faster inflation, four years of  budget deficits 
exceeding $1 trillion and a rising a debt load for the
government just as the bond market is trading at its most
expensive levels ever.  Treasury 10-year yields exceed inflation as measured by the
personal consumption expenditures index, a gauge preferred by
Fed, by about 45 basis points, below the median of 292 basis
points the past 20 years.  Auction Demand  “If market forces had driven us down to these levels
excluding the involvement of the Federal Reserve, maybe I’d feel
better” about current yields, Mitchell Stapley, the Grand
Rapids, Michigan-based chief fixed-income officer for Fifth
Third Asset Management, which oversees $15 billion in assets,
said in a telephone interview Oct. 23. “What happens when the
medicine goes away?”  Confidence in U.S. assets hasn’t been a concern. Investors
bid a record $3.17 for each dollar of the $1.79 trillion in
notes and bonds sold at Treasury auctions this year, compared
with $2.23 for each dollar of the $922 billion sold in 2008.  The central bank’s actions revived the housing market. The
average rate for 30-year  home loans  has declined to 3.41 percent
from 5.12 percent when Obama took office, according to Freddie
Mac. Housing starts climbed 15 percent in September from August
to a four-year high, Commerce Department data showed Oct. 17.  Mortgages, Corporates  “The U.S. is thought to be among the best developed-
economy performers going forward,”  Christopher Sullivan , who
oversees $2 billion as chief investment officer at United
Nations Federal Credit Union in New York, said in a phone
interview Oct. 19. “That in and of itself is attracting
capital.”  Bonds backed by mortgages have returned an average 6.52
percent annually since the end of October 2008, as yields fell
to 1.36 percent from 5.86 percent, according to the Bank of
America Merrill Lynch U.S. Mortgage Master index.  Corporate bond sales total $4.86 trillion since 2008, the
most ever in a four-year presidential term. The securities have
returned 61 percent, as yields dropped to 3.60 percent from 9.25
percent, Bank of America indexes show.  Bank commercial and industrial  lending  has risen 24 percent
to $1.48 trillion as of Oct. 10, from a 33-month low of $1.2
trillion in October 2010, Fed data show.  Bonds tied to consumer loans and commercial mortgages have
returned 36.1 percent since October 2008, Bank of America
indexes show. The amount of securities backed by  car loans 
issued by auto companies surged to $90 billion in 2012, up from
$49 billion in all of 2008, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Relative Debt  Vehicle deliveries this year through September climbed 15
percent to 10.9 million from a year earlier, according to
researcher Autodata Corp. in Woodcliff Lake, New Jersey. Sales
are on pace for the best year since 2007.  While government debt has risen, total U.S. public and
private obligations have shrunk to a six-year low relative to
the size of the economy as homeowners, cities and companies
scale back on borrowing.  Private-sector borrowing is down by $4 trillion the past
four years to $40.2 trillion, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Indebtedness including that of federal and state
governments and consumers is 3.29 times GDP, the least since
2006 and down from a peak of 3.59 in 2008.  “Overall the environment is in a better place than it was
at the height of the crisis,” said  Sean Simko , who oversees $8
billion at SEI Investments Co. in Oaks, Pennsylvania, in an Oct.
24 telephone interview. “You’ve seen the market go through a
healing process. We’ve come a long way.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
