Warner Bros. is canceling Anderson Cooper’s daily talk show, saying the “Anderson” series won’t
be back for a third season.  “While we made significant changes to the format, set and
produced it live in its second season, the  series  will not be
coming back for a third season in a marketplace that has become
increasingly difficult to break through,” Burbank, California-
based Warner Bros. said today in a statement.  The show, produced by Warner Bros.’ Telepictures unit, will
end after summer 2013, according to the studio. Warner Bros. is
part of  Time Warner Inc. (TWX)   To contact the reporter on this story:
