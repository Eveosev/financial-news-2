Augusta National Golf Club plans to
renovate its clubhouse and build an addition to the structure,
according to preliminary plans filed with the city of Augusta,
 Georgia .  The documents show that the private club, which hosts
golf’s annual Masters Tournament, plans to demolish a portion of
the building that includes a kitchen area, Bob Austin of the
Augusta Planning and Development office said in a telephone
interview.  The plan shows that a two-level structure will be built,
with the lower level below ground. The site plan doesn’t include
changes to the clubhouse’s main structure, which was built in
1854, Austin said. A miniature silver replica of the clubhouse
is presented each year to the Masters Tournament champion.  The exact size of the planned renovation and addition won’t
be known until a building plan is submitted, Austin said.  Steve Ethun, a spokesman for the Masters Tournament, didn’t
immediately respond to a request for comment on the building
plan.  Cranston Engineering Group, of Augusta, submitted the plan.
An employee there who didn’t give his name referred all calls to
the club, then hung up.  The renovation plans were first reported by the Augusta
Chronicle.  To contact the reporter on this story:
