MacDonald Dettwiler & Associates
Ltd. (MDA) , a Canadian maker of space-data collection equipment, rose
the most in four months after a U.S. regulator approved its $875
million acquisition of Space Systems/Loral Inc. and analysts
upgraded the stock.  MacDonald Dettwiler rose 11 percent to C$55.43 at 4:46 p.m.
in Toronto the biggest one-day gain for the Vancouver-based
company’s shares since June 27. It has risen 18 percent this
year.  “The acquisition allows MDA to gain critical mass in the
commercial satellite manufacturing industry and better positions
the company to win U.S. defence and intelligence work,”
Stephanie Price, an analyst at  CIBC World Markets  said in a
note. Price raised her 12 to 18-month price target on MacDonald
Dettwiler to C$66.  Steven Arthur, a technology analyst at  RBC Capital Markets ,
raised his price target on the stock to C$68.  MacDonald Dettwiler said it received notice from a branch
of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission that it has completed its
review of the proposed transaction.  The company said in June when the deal was announced that
about two-thirds of a projected C$1.9 billion ($1.9 billion) in
revenue will come from commercial communications after the
transaction, compared with one-third now.  To contact the reporter on this story:
