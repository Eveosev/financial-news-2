Energy Future Holdings Corp., the
 Texas  power company that was taken private in 2007 in the
largest buyout in history, reported its seventh consecutive
quarterly loss.  The third-quarter loss narrowed to $407 million from $710
million a year earlier, the closely held company said in a
filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission made
public today.  Sales fell 24.5 percent to $1.75 billion on low power
prices and weaker demand due to milder summer weather, according
to the filing.  Faced with power prices that  have fallen  by half since the
buyout, Energy Future, the biggest generation owner in Texas,
has sought to reduce its risk of default by extending  debt
maturities  and asking bondholders to swap their holdings at
discounted prices for new securities.  The company may need to restructure its balance sheet next
year as low natural gas prices, which help set the price of
electricity, have cut into the company’s cash flow, Moody’s
Investors Service said in a research note on Aug. 9.  The company’s $1.83 billion of 10.25 percent bonds due
November 2015 traded at 23 cents on the dollar on Oct. 25 from a
high of 88.5 cents in January 2010, according to Trace, the
bond-price reporting system of the Financial Industry Regulatory
Authority.  Energy Future, formerly known as TXU Corp., was sold to a
group led by  KKR & Co. (KKR)  and TPG Capital in 2007, in a $43.2
billion cash transaction.  Energy Future’s units include Oncor, a regulated power-line
business; TXU Energy, a retail electricity seller with about 1.8
million customers; and Luminant, which owns more than 15,400
megawatts of generation capacity in Texas.  To contact the reporters on this story:
