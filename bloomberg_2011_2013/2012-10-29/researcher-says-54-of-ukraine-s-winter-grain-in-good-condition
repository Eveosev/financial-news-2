About 54 percent of Ukraine’s
emerged winter grains were in good condition as of Oct. 25,
according to agriculture researcher UkrAgroConsult.  Winter grains, most of which are wheat, emerged on 6.47
million hectares (16 million acres) as of that date, or 82
percent of the planted area, the Kiev-based researcher said in
an e-mailed statement today.  The share of weak crops fell to 10 percent from 13 percent
on Oct. 18, the researcher said. That’s less than 16 percent a
year ago, according to UkrAgroConsult.  To contact the reporter on this story:
