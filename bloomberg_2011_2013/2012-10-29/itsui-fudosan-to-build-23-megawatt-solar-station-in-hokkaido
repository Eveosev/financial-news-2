Mitsui Fudosan Co. (8801) , a Japanese
property developer, will build a 23 megawatt solar power station
in northern  Japan .  The company plans to start building the power plant in
November in Tomakomai City, Hokkaido prefecture, and operations
are expected to begin by the end of March 2014, the company said
in a  statement  today.  The plant will generate enough power to supply about 6,600
homes and use Japanese solar panels, it said, without specifying
manufacturers.  In September, Mitsui Fudosan announced it will build a 13
megawatt solar power plant in Yamaguchi prefecture on its own,
as well as a 17 megawatt station in Oita prefecture with  Mitsui
Engineering and Shipbuilding Co.   To contact the reporter on this story:
