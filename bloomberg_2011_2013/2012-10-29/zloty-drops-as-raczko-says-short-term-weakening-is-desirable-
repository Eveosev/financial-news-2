The zloty weakened for the first
time in three days as Andrzej Raczko, a member of the central
bank’s management board, said short-term depreciation of the
currency was “desirable.”  The Polish currency retreated 0.3 percent to 4.1468 per
euro as of 5:03 p.m. in Warsaw. That pared this year’s
appreciation to 7.7 percent, still the third-steepest gain among
more than 20 emerging-market currencies tracked by Bloomberg
after the Hungarian forint and Chilean peso. The yield on five-
year notes rose two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to
4.13 percent.  A weaker zloty in the short term would help promote Polish
exports during a slowdown, Raczko, who isn’t a member of the
central bank’s rate-setting council, said at a panel discussion
in Warsaw today. If the currency depreciates over the long term,
it would be detrimental for the economy, he said. Poland’s
economic expansion slowed to its  weakest pace  in almost three
years in the second quarter as the debt crisis in the euro area,
its main trading partner, curbed demand.  “The zloty depreciation would be the only fast way to spur
recovery in the economy” as  interest rates  are “high,”   Piotr Kalisz  and Cezary Chrapek, economists at Citigroup Inc.’s Polish
unit wrote in an e-mailed report today. “The pressure to weaken
the zloty will grow with time.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
