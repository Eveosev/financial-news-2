Sir Michael Rake, a contender to
replace Marcus Agius as chairman of  Barclays Plc (BARC) , has withdrawn
from the race, the Sunday Times  reported , without saying how it
obtained the information.  Rake, currently deputy chairman of the London-based bank,
as well as chairman of BT Group Plc, was preferred by some of
Barclaysâ€™ biggest shareholders, the newspaper said. Other
investors wanted someone from outside the bank to be appointed,
according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
