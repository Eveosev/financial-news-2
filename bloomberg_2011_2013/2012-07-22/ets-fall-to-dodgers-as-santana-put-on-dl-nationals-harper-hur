The  New York Mets  fell 8-5 to the
 Los Angeles Dodgers  at home after the team announced it placed
pitcher Johan Santana on the 15-day disabled list with a right
ankle sprain.  Los Angeles third baseman  Juan Uribe  was 2-for-3 with three
runs scored and four runs batted in as the Dodgers handed the
Mets the eighth loss in their last nine games. Elsewhere in
Major League Baseball action, Washington Nationals rookie Bryce Harper was injured after fouling a pitch off his left leg in a
4-0 loss to the  Atlanta Braves .  The Dodgers opened a 4-0 lead in the third inning against
Mets starting pitcher Miguel Batista, and never trailed at Citi
Field in Flushing, Queens. Ronny Cedeno hit his second home run
of the season for New York.  Santana, 33, is 6-7 this season, with a 3.98 earned-run
average and 105 strikeouts. His ERA is 6.53 in the eight starts
since he threw the first no-hitter in Mets history last month.  Harper, who earlier this month became the youngest position
player to compete in an MLB All-Star game, left the first game
of the Nationalsâ€™ doubleheader with the Braves after two innings
due to a left ankle bruise. While x-rays revealed no broken
bones, the 19-year-old outfielder was held out of the starting
lineup for the second game, according to MLB.com.  -- Editor: Paul Tighe  To contact the reporters on this story:
