Almost three quarters of Spaniards
believe that billions of euros of austerity measures enacted by
the ruling  People´s Party  won’t help the country recover from
the economic crisis, El Mundo reported, citing a survey by Sigma
Dos.  The poll showed 73 percent of respondents expect austerity
measures to fail to bring a recovery in the economy and almost
82 percent said the government of Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy 
has failed to fulfill its electoral program, the newspaper
reported. The survey carried out between July 17 and 19 polled
1,000 citizens and has a margin of error of 3.2 percent, El
Mundo said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
