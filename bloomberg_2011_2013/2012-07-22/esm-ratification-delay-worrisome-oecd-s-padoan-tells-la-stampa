Germany ’s delay in ratifying the
permanent European Stability Mechanism is “worrisome,” the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development’s chief
economist, Pier Carlo Padoan, told La Stampa.  “We have in front of us a long period of political
uncertainty” on how to tame markets, Padoan told the Italian
newspaper in an interview.  The ESM should be given a banking license, and countries
like  Italy  that are respecting their fiscal goals should have
the possibility to tap it automatically, Padoan said.  “If a country asks for aid, it shouldn’t do it
explicitly” because markets would react negatively, he said.
Italy is on the right track in terms of budget consolidation,
though “the markets are wondering whether in the next 18 months
the effort will continue,” he told the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
