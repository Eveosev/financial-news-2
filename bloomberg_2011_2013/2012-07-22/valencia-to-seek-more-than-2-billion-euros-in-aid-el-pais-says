The regional government of Valencia
will request more than 2 billion euros ($2.43 billion) in aid
from the central government to meet debt repayments, El Pais
reported, citing Maximo Buch, head of Economy for the region.  The exact amount to be requested will depend on how much
other regions ask for from the fund, the newspaper cited Buch as
saying yesterday.  Valencia, which has 2,595 billion euros of debt maturing in
December, said on July 20 that it would tap a recently created
central government fund, the newspaper added.  Spain  created the 18 billion-euro bailout mechanism last
week to help cash-strapped regions even as its own access to
financial markets narrows.  To contact the reporter on this story:
