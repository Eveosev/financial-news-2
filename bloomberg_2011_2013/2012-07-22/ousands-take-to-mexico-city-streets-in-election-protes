Thousands of people marched down
Mexico City’s main business boulevard today to protest incoming
President Enrique Pena Nieto.  Organizations led by #YoSoy132, a group that says the
results of the July 1 elections were manipulated by television
stations and vote buying, marched against what protesters said
was the “imposition” of Pena Nieto.  The Democratic Revolution Party of presidential runner-up
 Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador  and the ruling  National Action Party 
joined forces last week to demand the electoral tribunal
investigate claims that Pena Nieto’s  Institutional Revolutionary
Party , or PRI, used illegally obtained funds to buy votes.  The PRI has denied the allegations of vote-buying and use
of illicit funds and asked the Attorney General’s office to
investigate the source of the accusations. The tribunal has
until Sept. 6 to rule on the claims and appoint a president
elect.  To contact the reporter on this story:
