released from custody and placed under house arrest pending a
decision on whether he will stand trial for leaking confidential
documents to an Italian journalist.  Paolo Gabriele, “will reside at home with his family”
Vatican spokesman Father Federico Lombardi said in a e-mailed
statement late yesterday. Gabriele had been held since May 25 on
suspicion of “aggravated theft.”  -- Editors:  Paul Jarvis , Robert Lakin  To contact the reporter on this story:
