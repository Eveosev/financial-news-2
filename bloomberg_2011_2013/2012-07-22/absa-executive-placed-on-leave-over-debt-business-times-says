Absa Group Ltd. (ASA)  placed an executive
on special leave and started an internal investigation into
circumstances that have led it to increase provisions for bad
debt, the  Business Times  reported, citing David Hodnett, the
lender’s financial director.  The unidentified executive was suspended as a precautionary
measure and while there was no suggestion of wrongdoing the
probe would be easier to conduct without him being present,
Hodnett said, according to the Johannesburg-based newspaper.  Absa confirmed Hodnett’s comments.  “We have nothing further to add,” the Johannesburg-based
company said in an e-mailed reply to questions. “We are in a
closed period and therefore cannot comment until after the
publication of our financial results on July 27.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
