The regional government of Catalonia
may follow Valencia to ask for financial aid from the central
government, El Pais reported, citing  Catalan delegate in
Parliament Josep Rull.  The Catalan regional government, led by Artur Mas, is
trying to negotiate a 500 million euro ($608 million) bridge
loan with undisclosed financial entities, El Pais said. The
regional government has warned publicly funded hospitals and
schools that if they fail to secure the loan they will not
receive payment this month given that they only have enough cash
to pay public sector employee wages, debt maturities and some
supplier´s bills, El Pais added.  A spokeswoman for the regional government of Catalonia
wasn´t immediately available for comment.  Catalonia, Castilla-La-Mancha, Murcia, the  Canary Islands ,
the Balearic Islands are among six Spanish regions that have
admitted they may ask for aid from the central government after
Valencia sought a bailout on Friday, El Pais reported.  Andalusia will also need to tap the fund, even though Diego
Valderas, vice president of the regional government, yesterday
ruled out such a measure, El Pais said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
