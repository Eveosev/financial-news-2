German Vice Chancellor Philipp
Roesler said he’s “very skeptical” that European leaders will
be able to rescue  Greece  and the prospect of the country’s exit
from the euro had “lost its terror.”    Roesler, who is  Germany ’s economy minister, told
broadcaster ARD that Greece was unlikely to be able to meet its
obligations under a euro-area bailout program as its
international creditors hold talks this week in  Athens . Should
that be the case, the country won’t receive more bailout
payments, Roesler said.   “What’s emerging is that Greece will probably not be able
to fulfil its conditions,” Roesler said today in an ARD summer
interview. “What is clear: if Greece doesn’t fulfil those
conditions, then there can be no more payments.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
