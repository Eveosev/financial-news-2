James Holmes, the suspect in the
shooting that killed 12 and injured 58 in a  Colorado  movie
theater, spent $15,000 on weapons, ammunition and other
equipment over the past several months and had 90 packages
delivered to his workplace, a law-enforcement official said.  A search of Holmes’s apartment in Aurora, Colorado,
revealed 30 improvised hand grenades and several containers
filled with gunpowder and gasoline and an additional 10 gallons
of fuel, said the official, who asked for anonymity because he
was not authorized to speak about the investigation. The
official said he was briefed on the matter.  Holmes, 24, is being held at the Arapahoe County jail and
awaits arraignment Monday morning.  Police are investigating deliveries to both Holmes’s
apartment and workplace at the  University of Colorado , where
Holmes was a graduate student in neurosciences, said Jacki
Kelley, a spokeswoman for the multi-agency investigation. She
declined to confirm the contents of Holmes’ apartment, which she
said police are continuing to search.  University of Colorado-Denver spokeswoman Jacque Montgomery
didn’t immediately respond to a phone call.  CBS News  earlier reported on Holmes’s spending and
deliveries.  To contact the reporters on this story:
