Hashim Amla became the first South
African to score a triple century in Test cricket, leaving top-
ranked  England  fighting to avoid defeat on the final day of the
series opener at the Oval in London.  Amla made 311 not out as the Proteas declared on 637-2 in
their first innings yesterday. England lost four second-innings
wickets before the close and still trails by 150 runs heading
into day five.  “I didn’t dream about getting 300,” Amla said in a news
conference. “I’ve always been a person who never sets goals and
I think that helps, because you can keep going and going without
being limited. The biggest pleasure is that the team is in a
really dominant position to win this Test match.”  South Africa, the  No. 3 team  in the International Cricket
Council’s Test rankings, would take over the top spot by winning
the best-of-three series, which continues with matches at Leeds
and Lord’s. The South Africans are the 2-5 favorites to win the
first Test with England the 100-1 outsider, according to U.K.
bookmaker  William Hill Plc. (WMH)   Amla and  Jacques Kallis , 182 not out, shared an unbeaten
377-run partnership for the third wicket -- only eight runs
fewer than England’s first-innings total. They came together two
days ago after captain  Graeme Smith  was bowled after making 131
in his 100th Test match.  Amla began his innings with South Africa at 1-1 following
the dismissal of Alviro Petersen. The 29-year-old right-hander
faced 529 balls and struck 35 fours in a stay at the crease
lasting more than 13 hours.  The previous highest score by a South African in elite
five-day Tests was  278 not out  by AB de Villiers against
Pakistan in November 2010.  South Africa’s bowlers removed Alastair Cook, Jonathan Trott,  Kevin Pietersen  and captain Andrew Strauss early in
England’s second innings before  Ian Bell  and  Ravi Bopara  guided
the home team to 102-4 at stumps. Bell will resume on 14 with
Bopara 15 not out.  “Could not have lost my record to a better man,” de
Villiers wrote on Twitter. “Also a great effort by our bowlers,
but lots of work ahead.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
