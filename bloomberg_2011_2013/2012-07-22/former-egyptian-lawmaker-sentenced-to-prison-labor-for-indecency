An Egyptian Salafi lawmaker was
sentenced to a year in prison with labor after being convicted
of an indecent act with a young woman in a parked car, the
independent Al-Shorouk reported today.  Ali Wanis, who represented the Salafi Nour Party in the
now-disbanded Islamist-dominated parliament, was also ordered by
the criminal court in the city of Tokh to pay a 1,000 Egyptian
pounds ($165) bail to suspend the sentence. A young woman was
sentenced to six months in prison. Her bail was set at 500
pounds. Wanis has denied the charges.  Authorities said he was found in the parked car on a
desolate road at night with the young woman while engaging in
improper behavior. He said at the time that the woman was his
niece, though authorities said she was not related to him.  Wanis was also sentenced to six months in prison for
insulting security forces.  To contact the reporter on this story:
