Egyptian tourist facilities aren’t
allowed to provide alcohol to local citizens during any Islamic
religious holidays, the official Middle East News Agency
reported today, citing Tourism Minister Mounir Fakhry Abdel-
Nour.  The ban was previously only implemented during Muslim’s
fasting month of Ramadan, the news service said. Businesses
violating this decision will face suspension and delisting by
the ministry, MENA reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
