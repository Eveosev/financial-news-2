DRB-Hicom Bhd (DRB) , the owner of the
Lotus sports car marque, is pushing on with a request for 10
million pounds ($15.6 million) of public money to expand its
factory in Norfolk, eastern  England , the  Sunday Times  said,
without stating how it got the information.  The company, which employs 1,200 in Norfolk, has ended the
contracts of three senior executives, the newspaper said. They
were Mike Bell, finance director; Kerry Dugan, the head of human
resources; and Sarah Price, head of legal, the Times said.  Alistair Florance, a spokesman for Lotus, didnâ€™t
immediately return a call to his mobile phone seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
