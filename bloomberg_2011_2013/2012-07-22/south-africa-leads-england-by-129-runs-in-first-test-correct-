(Corrects South Africa’s lead in headline.)  South Africa reached 514-2 in its
first innings at lunch on the penultimate day of the opening
cricket Test against England at the Oval in London, with Hashim
Amla unbeaten on 251.  Jacques Kallis  is 125 not out, while captain  Graeme Smith 
was bowled yesterday for 131.  South Africa, ranked the No. 3 Test team in International
Cricket Council rankings, could leapfrog No. 1 England by
winning the three-match series, which continues with games at
Leeds and at Lord’s in London.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
