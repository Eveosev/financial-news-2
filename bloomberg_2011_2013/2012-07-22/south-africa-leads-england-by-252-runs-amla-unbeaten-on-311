Hashim Amla became the first South
African to score 300 runs in a Test innings as he helped the
tourists to a 252-run lead against England at tea on the
penultimate day of the first Test.  Amla was 311 not out, with  Jacques Kallis  on 182, when
South Africa declared on 637-2 at The Oval in London.   South Africa, ranked the No. 3 Test team in International
Cricket Council rankings, could leapfrog No. 1 England by
winning the three-match series, which continues with games at
Leeds and at Lordâ€™s in London.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
