Rich Ricci , the head of  Barclays
Plc’s (BARC)  investment bank, won’t seek to replace Robert Diamond as
the bank’s chief executive officer, the Sunday Telegraph
reported, citing people it didn’t identify.  Ricci doesn’t want the job and will focus on measures aimed
at reviving the investment bank’s reputation, the newspaper
said.  Naguib Kheraj, a former Barclays chief financial officer
who’s currently a senior adviser to the bank, is the only
internal candidate as Anthony Jenkins and Tom Kalaris are
believed to be too inexperienced, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
