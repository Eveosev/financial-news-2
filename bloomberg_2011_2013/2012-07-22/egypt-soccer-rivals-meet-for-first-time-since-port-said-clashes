Egyptian soccer clubs Al Ahly and
Zamalek will face each other behind closed doors today for their
first match in  Egypt  since deadly clashes in February, state-run
Ahram newspaper reported today.  Fans haven’t been allowed to attend any matches in Egypt
since the violence, which left at least 70 dead and hundreds
injured after fans of the two teams clashed after a game in Port
Said. It was the worst outbreak of violence since the uprising
that toppled President  Hosni Mubarak  a year earlier.  The deaths led to the indefinite suspension of domestic
football activities, with Ahly and Zamalek restricted to a few
competitive games in Africa’s premier club competition. Today’s
match is part of the African  Champions League .  To contact the reporter on this story:
