Chinese stocks fell for a third week
in New York before Internet companies from Baidu Inc. to
 Ctrip.com International Ltd. (CTRP)  report second-quarter earnings that
analysts estimate will show slower profit growth.  The  Bloomberg China-US Equity Index (CH55BN)  of the most-traded
Chinese shares in the U.S. sank 1.9 percent last week to 86.11.
Baidu, the nation’s largest online search engine, hit an 18-
month low while online travel agency Ctrip capped the longest
losing streak since 2008.  New Oriental Education & Technology
Group Inc. (EDU)  fell the most on record after saying the U.S.
regulator is investigating its accounting practices and Muddy
Waters LLC questioned its ownership structure.  Analysts expect Baidu to report today that profit in the
three months ended June 30 rose 52 percent, after growing at
least 70 percent in the previous nine quarters, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Government reports showed net income
for state-owned companies dropped 12 percent in the first half
while gross domestic product expanded last quarter at the
slowest pace in three years.  “They will give us very little upside surprise,” Michael Ding, lead manager of the  China Region Fund (USCOX)  at U.S. Global
Investors Inc., which oversees $2.2 billion, said in a telephone
interview from  San Antonio ,  Texas  on July 20. “Advertising
sales of Internet companies slowed down amid a slowdown in
consumption. Baidu’s growth is on the downside as it doesn’t
have many new revenue sources.”  The  iShares FTSE China 25 Index Fund , the biggest Chinese
exchange-traded fund in the U.S., climbed 2.1 percent last week
to $33.26, snapping a two-week slump. The  Standard & Poor’s 500
Index (SPX)  added 0.4 percent to 1,362.66, a second week of gains.  ‘Pretty Bearish’  Beijing-based Baidu forecast in April sales would increase
as much as 60 percent in the second quarter to 5.46 billion  yuan 
($857 million), compared with the $5.47 billion  projection  of
analysts. Profit for the period may have risen to $2.49 billion
from $1.88 billion in the previous quarter, analysts predicted.  Baidu’s second-quarter results and third-quarter guidance
won’t exceed analysts’ estimate, Tian X. Hou, the founder of
T.H. Capital LLC wrote in a July 20 note. “The Street has a
pretty bearish view on  China’s economy , which is reflected in
their outlook on Baidu.”  The stock fell to $104.98 on July 17, the lowest level
since January 2011. Baidu retreated 0.2 percent on July 20,
ending the week up 0.7 percent.  Sell Recommendation  Ctrip, the largest online travel agency in  China , is due to
report earnings tomorrow. The company forecast revenue growth of
15 percent to 20 percent for the second quarter, according to a
PR Newswire statement on May 16. The average estimate of 13
analysts was for a 21 percent increase to $156 million,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ctrip’s ADRs fell 2.9 percent in its sixth weekly slide,
which was the longest periods of losses in four years. The ADRs
sank 1.3 percent on July 20 to $14.63.  E-Commerce China Dangdang Inc. (DANG) , the nation’s largest online
book retailer, declined 13 percent last week to $5.09, the most
in seven weeks. Beijing-based 86Research Ltd. recommended
selling the shares of the company on July 17, citing concern
about its deteriorating cash flow.  Internet data-center service provider  21Vianet Group Inc. (VNET) 
tumbled 12 percent to $9.96 last week, the worst performance in
a year.  Muddy Waters  New Oriental’s ADRs jumped 15 percent to $12.91 on July 20,
trimming the weekly loss to 42 percent. The rebound followed a
35 percent slump on July 18 as  Muddy Waters  questioned the
ownership of some of New Oriental’s schools and the
consolidation of their financial statements with the parent
company.  The Beijing-based educational services provider said it
formed a special committee comprised of three independent
directors to conduct a review of the allegations in a July 20
statement, aiming “to provide the highest level of transparency
to its shareholders.”  SouFun Holdings Ltd. (SFUN) , which runs China’s biggest real
estate information website, tumbled 11 percent last week to
$13.42, the lowest level this year.  China will keep a “firm grip” on the real estate market
to prevent a rebound in housing prices, the Xinhua News Agency
said July 19. Cities that have loosened controls must “set
straight” government policies, the state-owned Xinhua reported,
citing a notice from the Ministry of Land and Resources and the
Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development.  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  of shares traded in mainland
China declined 0.8 percent last week to 2,168.64, completing its
fifth weekly slump.  To contact the reporter on this story:
