The  International Monetary Fund  will
stop paying further rescue aid to Greece, making the country’s
insolvency in September more likely, the  Der Spiegel  magazine
said. citing unidentified European Union officials.  While a review of Greece’s progress in meeting terms of its
rescue is unfinished, it is “already clear” to the reviewing
body of the IMF, the EU Commission and the  European Central Bank 
that Greece will not be able to fulfill its promise to cut debt
to 120 percent of annual economic growth in euro terms by 2020,
 Der Spiegel  said.  Missing the target means Greece needs between 10 billion
euros and 50 billion euros ($60.8 billion) in additional aid, a
potential outcome that the IMF and several unidentified euro-
area states are not prepared to accept, the magazine said,
citing the review.  Euro-area leaders regard Greece’s exit from the euro as
manageable even though they want to prop up the country’s
finances until the new and permanent rescue fund called the
European Stability Mechanism is in operation, the magazine said,
citing from the same sources.  Germany  is holding up the
inception of the ESM as it awaits a court ruling on the fund’s
constitutionality on Sept. 12, Spiegel said.  The ECB may step in to help  Greece  in the meantime, said
the magazine, citing some 3.8 billion euros the government needs
to pay back to the central bank on August 20. The government may
sell debt of that amount as short-term “T-Bills” to Greek
banks, which in turn would deposit the bonds as security at the
ECB, securing further aid, Spiegel said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
