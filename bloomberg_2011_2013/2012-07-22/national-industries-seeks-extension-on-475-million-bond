National Industries Group Holding, (NIND) 
which has $475 million of Islamic bonds maturing in August, is
seeking a four-year extension on the sukuk maturity as the
Kuwaiti investment company raises financing for repayment.  The company is seeking to amend the periodic distribution
from floating to fixed at a rate of 4.5 percent payable semi-
annually on Feb. 16 and Aug. 16, National Industries said in a
statement distributed via the Regulatory News Service. Citigroup
Inc. is managing the process and consent solicitation will
expire Aug. 9, with a debt-holders’ meeting scheduled for Aug.
13 to seek their approval to extend the maturity to Aug. 16,
2016, it said.  A number of Kuwaiti investment companies have defaulted
since the onset of the global financial crisis after the value
of their assets collapsed and frozen debt markets prevented them
from raising loans. Global Investment House KSCC, a investment
bank that reorganized $1.73 billion of debt in 2009, said last
month bondholders agreed to delay the maturity of its bonds,
while Investment Dar Co., the owner of half of Aston Martin
Lagonda Ltd., altered the terms on $5 billion of loans after
defaulting in 2009.  Total debt of Kuwait’s more than 90 investment companies
amounts to about 4.8 billion dinars ($17 billion), according to
Bloomberg News calculations based on central bank data. The
average yield on Kuwaiti debt was 6.3 percent on July 20,
JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s CEMBI Broad Kuwait Blended Yield index
shows. That compares with 2.2 percent in  Saudi Arabia , 4.2
percent in the  United Arab Emirates , 3.4 percent in Qatar and
4.9 percent in Bahrain, according to JPMorgan data.  Financing  National Industries is in the process of raising a three-
year syndicated murabaha facility of more than 100 million
dinars ($356 million) to pay “any early consent fee,  any
ineligible payments and the initial dissolution amount of 30
percent,” according to the statement. The company said May 20
it hired Warba Bank to raise Islamic financing of more than 100
million dinars.  The price on National Industries’ floating-rate sukuk due
Aug. 16 fell 1.25 cents last week to 80 cents on the dollar,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The shares  have
declined 21 percent this year compared with a less than 0.1
percent drop in the benchmark KSE Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
