Credit Suisse Group AG plans to
raise as much as 500 million francs ($506 million) by the end of
this year through the sale of buildings including its Uetlihof
office complex in Zurich,  SonntagsZeitung  reported, without
saying where it got the information.  The bank will continue to occupy the Uetlihof site as a
tenant after the sale, the Swiss newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
