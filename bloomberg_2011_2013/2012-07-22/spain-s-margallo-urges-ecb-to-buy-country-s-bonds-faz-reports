Spanish Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Garcia Margallo urged the  European Central Bank  to buy his
country’s bonds as yields widen, the  Frankfurter Allgemeine
Zeitung  reported, citing comments made at a meeting of European
Union foreign ministers yesterday in Palma de Mallorca.  The ECB is “in hiding,” Garcia Margallo is cited as
saying to reporters, according to FAZ. The bank’s “doing
nothing to douse the fire” of  Spain ’s sovereign debt. Financial
markets are rewarding Spain’s efforts to consolidate debt “by
boxing its ears,” he said. The euro-area must “act
decisively” in Spain’s interest, he added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
