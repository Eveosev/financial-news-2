A jump in orders to draw copper
supplies from inventories may signal prices of the metal are set
to rebound as construction demand climbs.  The CHART OF THE DAY shows that orders to move material out
of warehouses monitored by New York’s Comex and the London Metal
Exchange have more than doubled since the 2012 low on June 7.
Prices have tumbled 14 percent since this year’s high on Feb. 9.  Orders are rising amid signs of a recovery in U.S. home
building and plans for infrastructure projects in other parts of
the world, said  William O’Neill , a partner at Logic Advisors.
About 40 percent of global demand comes from construction
materials including wire and pipe, the Copper Development
Association estimates.  “The recent evidence suggests we’ve bottomed out in
copper, and there’s evidence of growing tightness,” O’Neill
said in a telephone interview from  Upper Saddle River ,  New
Jersey . The rise in orders “is a positive sign for the supply-
demand equation.”  Futures for September delivery on the Comex slid 1.6
percent to $3.448 a pound last week. The price may rebound to
$3.70 by the end of the year, O’Neill said.  New U.S. home construction rose in June to the highest
level in almost four years, the Commerce Department said on July
18.  To contact the reporter on this story:
