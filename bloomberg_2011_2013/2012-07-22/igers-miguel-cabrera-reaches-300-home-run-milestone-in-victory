Miguel Cabrera  of the Detroit Tigers
hit two home runs in a 6-4 win over the Chicago White Sox to
become the 22nd active Major League Baseball player with at
least 300 career homers.  The Tigers had four homers to cap a three-game series sweep
that leaves them 1 1/2 games ahead of the White Sox atop the
American League Central Division. Detroit has won 13 of its past
15 games.  Cabrera, 29, becomes the youngest active member of the 300-
home run club. The seven-time All-Star third baseman now has 23
homers this season and has hit at least 30 home runs in seven of
the past eight seasons.  Barry Bonds  is baseball’s all-time leader with  762 homers ,
while  Alex Rodriguez  of the New York Yankees leads all active
major-league players with 643 home runs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
