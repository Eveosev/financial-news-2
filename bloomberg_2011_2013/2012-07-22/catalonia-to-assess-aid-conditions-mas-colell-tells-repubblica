Catalonia hasn’t decided whether to
ask for aid from the Spanish central government, the region’s
finance chief Andreu Mas-Colell told Italian daily  la Repubblica 
in an interview.  “Catalonia will study the conditions of the new aid
mechanism,” Mas-Colell said. “After that, it will decide
whether to tap” the emergency-loan fund created by the
government, he said.  Spain  leaving the euro is out of the question, Mas-Colell
also said, according to the newspaper. “We are completely in
line with the European austerity policies,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
