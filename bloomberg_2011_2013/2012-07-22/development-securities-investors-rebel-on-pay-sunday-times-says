Development Securities Plc (DSC) 
shareholders want to reduce  executive compensation  and are
calling on the company to extend a buyback of stock, the  Sunday
Times  reported, citing an unidentified investor.  The company, owner of the Manchester Arena music venue,
trades at a 45 percent discount to its net asset value, the
newspaper said. Investors may consider seeking a change of
management after executives collected 2.6 million pounds ($4
million) in salaries and bonuses last year, according to the
report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
