Sir Michael Rake, a contender to
replace Marcus Agius as chairman of  Barclays Plc (BARC) , has withdrawn
from contention for the role, the Sunday Times  reported , without
saying how it obtained the information.  Rake, deputy chairman of the London-based bank chairman of
 BT Group Plc (BT/A) , was preferred by some of Barclaysâ€™ biggest
shareholders, the newspaper said. Other investors wanted someone
from outside the bank to be appointed, the Times said.  Barclays spokesman Giles Croot declined to comment when
contacted by mobile phone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
