Julius Baer Group Ltd. (BAER)  results
tomorrow may reveal that the bank profited from new money
inflows at the expense of Clariden Leu AG,  SonntagsZeitung 
reported, citing people familiar with the matter.  Much of the 3.4 billion Swiss francs ($3.44 billion) that
clients have withdrawn from Clariden Leu since it was acquired
by Credit Suisse Group AG has been transferred to Baer, the
Swiss newspaper cited the people as saying, without naming them.  To contact the reporter on this story:
