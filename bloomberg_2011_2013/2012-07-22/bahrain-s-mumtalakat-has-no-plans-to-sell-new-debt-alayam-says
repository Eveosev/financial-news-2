Bahrain Mumtalakat Holding Co. BSC,
the Island-Kingdom’s sovereign wealth fund, doesn’t plan to sell
new debt at the moment, Alayam reported, citing chief executive
officer Mahmood Al Kooheji.  The fund, which manages $8.8 billion in assets, will seek
to extend the repayment period on existing debt and focus on
reducing debt levels, Al Kooheji told the Bahraini newspaper.  The company raised $750 million from the sale of bonds in
2010. The yield on the 5 percent notes maturing June 2015 has
fallen 97 basis points this year to 4.77 percent on July 20,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
