Andy Haste, the former chief
executive of  RSA Insurance Group Plc (RSA) , will lead a bid by
private-equity firms for Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc’s
Direct Line Group, the Sunday Telegraph said, citing people it
didn’t identify.  Blackstone Group LP (BX) , Bain Capital Partners Llc, and Advent
International Corp. will join Haste to bid as much as 3.5
billion pounds ($5.5 billion) for the unit, the newspaper said.  A successful bid would see Haste become the business’s
chief executive or chairman, according to the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
