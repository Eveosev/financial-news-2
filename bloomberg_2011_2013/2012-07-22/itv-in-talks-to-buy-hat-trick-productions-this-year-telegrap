U.K. broadcaster  ITV Plc (ITV)  hopes to to
buy Hat Trick Productions Ltd. and complete the deal within the
next few months, the Sunday Telegraph reported, citing
unidentified sources close to the company.  ITV has been striving to announce the acquisition at its
second-quarter results on July 26, the newspaper said. Buying
the television producer would help plans to boost in-house
content production, the report said.  “We will not comment on speculation,” Mary Fagen,
