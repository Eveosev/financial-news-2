G4S Plc (GFS)  Chairman John Connolly
expects the security-services company to miss out on contracts
to run prisons and back-office police work after it supplied too
few workers for the  Olympic Games , he told the  Sunday Times .  The future of Chief Executive Officer Nick Buckles may come
under review to decide whether there was “enough focus” on the
contract to manage security at the Games in London, the paper
cited Connolly as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
