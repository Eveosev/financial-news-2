World Bank  President Jim Yong Kim
said today that his organization “will work tirelessly” to win
the fight against AIDS.  Kim was addressing the opening plenary session of the 2012
 International AIDS Conference  in  Washington .  “I pledge that the World Bank will work tirelessly with
all of you here to drive the AIDS fight forward until we win,”
Kim said in remarks prepared for delivery. “I challenge you to
join me in harnessing the moral power and practical lessons that
the AIDS movement has produced to speed progress against that
other global scourge, poverty.”  There are a record 34.2 million people worldwide living
with HIV and the virus killed more than 4,000 people a day last
year, according to the  World Health Organization . The AIDS
meeting in Washington is expected to draw more than 20,000
activists and researchers.  Kim said that “we look towards the end of AIDS as
something that is actually within our reach” and that he is
“committed to strengthening the World Bank’s multilateral
alliances” in the fight against AIDS.  Kim, 52, took over as head of the World Bank on July 1. He
is an HIV/AIDS specialist who co-founded a non-profit
organization that has opened clinics in countries including
Haiti and  Peru .  To contact the reporter on this story:
