Egypt  seeks to raise 7 billion
pounds ($1.2 billion) in domestic debt today as yields drop from
records, helped by central bank measures to boost bank funding
and a government plan to extend debt maturities.  The Ministry of Finance plans to sell 4 billion pounds of
nine-month treasury notes and 1 billion pounds in three-month
bills, according to central bank data on Bloomberg. The ministry
also seeks to raise 1 billion pounds each from the sale of five-
year and 10-year bonds, the data show.  Treasury yields have retreated from near-record highs in
June after the central bank cut the local currency reserve
requirement ratio for banks to 10 percent and started selling
28-day  repurchase agreements  alongside seven-day repos. Interim
Finance Minister Momtaz El-Saieed said July 16 the government
plans to raise the average maturity of local debt to 1.8 years.
Egyptâ€™s average debt maturity fell to 1.3 years at the end of
2011 from 1.7 years in 2010.  The average yield on nine-month securities fell in the last
three sales to 15.696 percent, the lowest since the start of
May, according to central bank data on Bloomberg. The average
yield on three-month notes declined in the last two auctions,
the data show.  The yield on the 5.75 percent dollar bonds due April 2020
rose one basis point to 6.26 percent on July 20, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The pound, subject to managed float,
gained less than 0.1 percent last week to 6.0628 a dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
