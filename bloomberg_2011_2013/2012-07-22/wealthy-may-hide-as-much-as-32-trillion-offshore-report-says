Wealthy individuals may have been
hiding as much as $32 trillion offshore at the end of 2010,
according to  Tax Justice Network , a U.K.-based organization that
campaigns for transparency in the financial system.  The estimate is almost three times the organization’s last
estimate of $11.5 trillion in 2005. Fewer than 100,000 people
own $9.8 trillion of offshore assets, according to the research,
carried out by former McKinsey & Co. economist James Henry.  There is a “huge black hole in the world economy” of
untaxed private wealth, Henry said in a statement. “The lost
 tax revenue  implied by our estimates is huge.”  The amount held offshore means that 139 countries with
external debts of $4.1 trillion at the end of 2010 would be
creditors to the world, if as much as $9.3 trillion of cross-
border holdings of their wealthiest citizens were taken into
account, according to the research.  The Tax Justice Network study drew on data from the  World
Bank ,  International Monetary Fund , central banks, the  United
Nations  and company reports.  To contact the reporter on this story:
