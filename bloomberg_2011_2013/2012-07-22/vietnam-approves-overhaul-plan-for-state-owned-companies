Vietnamese Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung approved proposals to boost the competitiveness and profit
margins of state companies, according to  a posting  on the
government website.  Selling shares in some state companies will be a “key
task” during the period until 2015, according to the
restructuring plan. Some companies, such as those classified as
important to national defense or  economic production , will
remain under full government control, according to the
proposals.  State companies facing financial difficulties are to
“focus resources on core business activities” and clarify
management responsibilities, the plan states.  Strengthening the performance of state companies would
require “decisive measures”, according to an International
Monetary Fund  report  this month that said “the lack of
information on state-owned enterprises’ financial position is
posing a threat to the financial system, as well as, ultimately,
the public fiscal position.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
