Toyo Ink SC Holdings Co. (4634)  and
affiliates agreed to pay $45 million to settle allegations of
submitting false claims to the U.S. government to avoid  import
duties .  Toyo Ink, a printer-ink maker based in Tokyo and affiliated
companies in the U.S. disguised products’ country of origin on
documents given to  U.S. Customs  and Border Protection for eight
years starting in 2002, the government said today in a
statement.  “Fair and lawful trade requires importers to truthfully
identify their products and pay the appropriate duties,” U.S.
Attorney  Anne M. Tompkins  in Charlotte, North Carolina, said in
the statement.  Toyo Ink, without admitting liability, agreed to the
$45 million payment, of which John Dickson, who brought the case
under the federal False Claims Act, will receive $7.87 million,
according to a settlement agreement in federal court in
Charlotte.  Nancy Ikehara, a spokeswoman for Toyo Ink, didn’t
immediately respond to an e-mail message seeking comment.  The case is U.S., ex rel. Dickson v. Toyo Ink Manufacturing
Co., 09-cv-00438, U.S. District Court, Western District of  North
Carolina  (Charlotte).  To contact the reporter on this story:
