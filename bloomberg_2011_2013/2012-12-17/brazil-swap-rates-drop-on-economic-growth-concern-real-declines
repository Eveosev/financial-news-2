Brazil  swap rates fell as analysts
in a central bank survey cut their economic growth forecasts for
a fifth straight week, supporting speculation borrowing costs
will stay at record lows through the first half of 2013.  Swap rates on contracts due in January 2014 dropped one
basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 7.08 percent today in
Sao Paulo. The real depreciated 0.7 percent to 2.0996 per U.S.
dollar.  About 100 economists in a weekly central bank survey
published today lowered their median estimate for 2013 growth to
3.4 percent from 3.5 percent the week before. They raised their
year-end inflation forecast for next year to 5.42 percent from
5.40 percent.  “Even though there are inflation concerns, the weak GDP
numbers prevailed,”  Roberto Padovani , the chief economist at
Votorantim Ctvm, said in a phone interview from Sao Paulo.  Brazil’s policy makers left the  target lending rate  at a
record low 7.25 percent last month following 10 straight
reductions. Traders use  interest-rate swaps  to bet on the
direction of borrowing costs.  Gross domestic product in the largest emerging economy
after  China  grew 0.9 percent in the third quarter from a year
earlier, the statistics agency reported Nov. 30. The median
forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg was for a 1.9
percent expansion.  The IGP-10 inflation index rose 0.63 percent in the month
through Dec. 10, the Getulio Vargas Foundation reported today.
The median forecast of 25 analysts in a survey by Bloomberg was
for a 0.5 percent increase. The gauge is composed of 60 percent
wholesale prices, 30 percent consumer prices and 10 percent
construction costs.  Inflation Target  Brazil’s annual rate of consumer price increases as
measured by the IPCA gauge has exceeded the 4.5 percent midpoint
of the central bank’s target range for 27 consecutive months.
Annual inflation unexpectedly accelerated to 5.53 percent in
November from 5.45 percent the month before, the statistics
agency reported Dec. 7.  The real has dropped 11 percent this year, the worst
performance among the dollar’s 16 most-traded counterparts
tracked by Bloomberg.  Policy makers have swung in 2012 between selling currency
swaps aimed at preventing the real from depreciating too quickly
and offering reverse currency swaps to protect exporters by
keeping the real from strengthening.  The central bank sold $2.1 billion in currency swaps Dec. 3
and $1.6 billion on Nov. 23 to stem the real’s declines. From
August through October, the bank sold reverse currency swaps to
keep the real weaker than 2 per dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
