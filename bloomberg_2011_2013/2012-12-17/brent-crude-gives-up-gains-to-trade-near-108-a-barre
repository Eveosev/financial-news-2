Brent crude oil slipped, giving up
earlier gains to trade near $108 a barrel in  London .  Oil futures were buoyed in part earlier today after the
Federal Reserve reported Dec. 14 that industrial output in the
U.S. climbed by the most in two years in November.  Brent  for February settlement traded 16 cents lower at
$108.02 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange
at 9:06 a.m., after gaining as much as 32 cents earlier. The
January contract settled $1.24 higher at $109.15 when it expired
Dec. 14.  West Texas Intermediate crude for January delivery was at
$86.76 a barrel, up 3 cents, in electronic trading on the  New
York  Mercantile Exchange. The February WTI grade was trading at
a $20.66 discount to the same-month Brent contract, down from a
$22.42 gap on Dec. 14, when the front months were both January.  Money managers lowered net-long positions, or wagers on
higher WTI crude prices, by 21 percent in the seven days ended
Dec. 11, according to the Commodity Futures Trading Commissionâ€™s
Dec. 14 Commitments of Traders report. It was the biggest drop
since the week ended May 8. ICE will report trader commitment
data for Brent and gasoil futures later today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
