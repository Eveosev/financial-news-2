Soybeans rose to a five-week high
after crushing in the U.S., last year’s biggest shipper,
increased in November to the highest level since 2010, adding to
signs of stronger demand.  Crushers in the U.S. used 157.3 million bushels last month
to make  animal feed  and cooking oil, the biggest amount since
January 2010, data from the National Oilseed Processors
Association  tracked  by Bloomberg showed. U.S. exporters  sold 
1.319 million metric tons in the week ended Dec. 6, the most
soybeans since Nov. 2010, according to government data.  “Strong demand for U.S. soybeans, both domestic and
abroad, remains the main factor supporting prices,”  Luke Mathews , a commodity strategist at  Commonwealth Bank of
Australia (CBA) , said in a report e-mailed today.  Soybeans for March delivery climbed 0.5 percent to $14.99 a
bushel by 6:26 a.m. on the Chicago Board of Trade. Earlier, the
price touched $15.0125, the highest for a most-active contract
since Nov. 8. The oilseed is heading for a 24 percent gain this
year. Corn for March delivery was little changed at $7.3125 a
bushel, set for an increase this year of 13 percent.  Wheat for delivery in March rose 0.4 percent to $8.17 a
bushel in Chicago, up 25 percent in 2012. In Paris, March-
delivery milling wheat was up 0.3 percent at 259.75 euros
($341.91) a ton, heading for a 33 percent increase this year.
The Paris contract was at an almost $1.14 per bushel  premium  to
 Chicago  as of Dec. 14, the widest price difference ever for the
two contracts, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  “In wheat markets, the trade is fully expecting the U.S.
to pick up the majority of any future tenders,” Jaime Nolan-
Miralles, an INTL FCStone Inc. commodity risk manager in Dublin,
said today in an e-mailed report.  In the week ended Dec. 6, U.S. exporters sold 573,422 tons
of wheat for delivery this marketing year and next, up 62
percent from a week earlier, the  U.S. Department of Agriculture 
said Dec. 13. The U.S. is the world’s biggest wheat exporter.  To contact the reporters on this story:
