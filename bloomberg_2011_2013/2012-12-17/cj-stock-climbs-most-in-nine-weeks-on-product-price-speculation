CJ CheilJedang Corp. (097950)  shares climbed
the most in nine weeks, pacing gains among South Korean
snackfood makers, as the company confirmed a report it may raise
prices of some products.  CJ, South Korea’s biggest food processor, closed 3.4
percent higher, the steepest gain since Oct. 12, to 348,500 in
Seoul.  Lotte Confectionery Co. (004990)  gained 4.3 percent, the most
since Aug. 9, to 1,545,000 won.  Orion Corp. (001800)  rose 4.3 percent to
1,024,000 won. The benchmark  Kospi index  lost 0.6 percent.  CJ may raise prices of some fresh food this month, Newspim
reported today, citing an unidentified company official. CJ is
seeking to increase tofu and bean-sprout prices this month,
though the scope of the price gains has not been determined, Lee
Eun Young, a company spokeswoman, said by phone today in
response to Bloomberg queries on the report.  “The expectation for price increases appears to be
boosting CJ shares today,” said Kim Yun Oh, an analyst with
Shinyoung Securities Co. in  Seoul . “Other snack makers are
being boosted as well on bets the companies may follow suit.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
