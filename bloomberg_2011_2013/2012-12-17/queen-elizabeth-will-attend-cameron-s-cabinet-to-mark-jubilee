Queen Elizabeth II  will attend a
U.K. Cabinet meeting tomorrow under the chairmanship of Prime
Minister  David Cameron , the first time a monarch has attended
such a session since Victoria in the 19th century.  During the 90-minute meeting, Cameron’s ministerial team
will present the queen with a gift paid for from their own
contributions as part of yearlong celebrations of her Diamond
Jubilee, the prime minister’s spokesman, Steve Field, told
reporters in London today.  The queen is likely to sit beside Cameron and will be
attending the weekly meeting as an observer, Field said. the
monarch’s husband, Prince Philip, won’t attend. The meeting is
due to start at 9:15 a.m. in Cameron’s Downing Street office.  As head of state, the queen, who’s 86, “has to remain
strictly neutral with respect to political matters, unable to
vote or stand for election,” according to the monarchy’s
website.  Britain staged four days of events in June to mark the
queen’s 60 years as ruler. Victoria, who reigned from 1837 to
1901, is the only monarch to have spent longer on the throne.  Queen Elizabeth  and Prince Philip visited the  Bank of
England  last week and were shown the central bank’s gold
reserves.  To contact the reporter on this story:
