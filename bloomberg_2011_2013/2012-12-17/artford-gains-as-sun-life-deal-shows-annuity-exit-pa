Hartford Financial Services Group
Inc. (HIG) , the insurer seeking to cut liabilities tied to annuities,
gained the most in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index after  Sun
Life Financial Inc. (SLF)  struck a deal to sell a similar business.  Sun Life said today it will sell a U.S. annuity operation
to a firm owned by Guggenheim Partners LLC shareholders in a
$1.35 billion deal to cut risks tied to market fluctuations.
Hartford, based in the Connecticut city of the same name, has
been also seeking to retreat from the retirement products.
Obligations to clients increase on the policies when stock
markets fall, and lower  interest rates  pressure returns.  The Guggenheim deal shows “there are potential buyers out
there for these troubled books of business, which could open up
opportunities for Hartford,” said  Randy Binner , an analyst at
FBR Capital Markets, in a note to investors today.  Hartford  reached deals  to sell the individual life unit,
Woodbury Financial Services and retirement-plan operations after
investor  John Paulson  pushed Chief Executive Officer  Liam McGee 
to narrow the company’s focus on property-casualty coverage.
McGee said last month he is offering cash payments to some
clients to give up their variable annuity contracts after the
insurer’s liabilities swelled on the policies.  Hartford rallied 2.9 percent to $21.91 at 11:10 a.m. The
company has climbed 35 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
