Peru ’s sol fell from its highest
level in 16 years as the central bank bought dollars to stem
appreciation in the local currency.  The sol depreciated 0.1 percent to 2.5625 per  U.S. dollar 
at today’s close, according to Deutsche Bank AG’s local unit.
The currency strengthened to 2.56 on Dec. 14, its strongest
close since 1996,  data  from Peru’s financial regulator show.  The central bank said on its website it bought $80 million
in the  spot market  today, taking its purchases this year to
$13.5 billion. Since September the monetary authority has bought
dollars every day, even when the sol depreciates, to make it
harder for traders to predict movements in the currency, bank
president Julio Velarde told reporters Dec. 14.  “The central bank has become less predictable, intervening
in the market even when there is little movement in the
currency, because it wants to create volatility that is really
lacking in the currency,” said Hedmond Rios, an economist at
Celfin Capital in Santiago.  The yield on the nation’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol-
denominated bond due August 2020 was little changed at 3.95
percent at 3:41 p.m. in  Lima , according to prices compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
