DVB Bank SE (DVB) , one of the most active
aircraft financiers in  India , suspended all financing to Indian
carriers after the country’s administration failed to deregister
two airliners following their repossession from  Kingfisher
Airlines Ltd. (KAIR)   DVB repossessed two Airbus A320 aircraft earlier this year
from Kingfisher after terminating leases on the planes, the
lender said in an e-mailed statement. The bank still hasn’t
gotten the necessary documentation that would let it place the
jets elsewhere, Bertrand Grabowski, managing director for
aviation and rail at the Frankfurt-based bank, said in a
telephone interview.  “Until we have the planes deregistered, we can’t redeploy
the airplanes and that means a loss for DVB,” Grabowski said.
Financing into the Indian market is suspended until further
notice, he said.  DVB has placed financing directly or indirectly through
lessors with airlines including Air India Ltd., Kingfisher,
IndiGo and  Jet Airways India Ltd. (JETIN)   India Aviation Minister Ajit Singh said he was not aware of
DVB’s decision when asked in an interview today about the
situation. He declined to comment further.  Arun Mishra, the director general of civil aviation in
India, didn’t respond to two calls to his mobile phone. Mishra
is the nation’s aviation regulator and his office is responsible
for registering and deregistering aircraft.  Holding security over an aircraft registered in India
“does not provide acceptable protection to owner and
mortagees,” Grabowski said in an earlier e-mailed statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
