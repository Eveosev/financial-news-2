The Bundesbank said Germany’s
economy,  Europe ’s largest, may have contracted markedly in the
final quarter of the year as the sovereign debt crisis weighs on
investment and spending.  “Indicators point to a perceptible decline in economic
activity at the end of the year,” the Frankfurt-based
institution said in its monthly report published today. “The
current weakness emanates mainly from the industrial sector, in
which production has been curbed significantly.”  The Bundesbank lowered its growth outlook on Dec. 7 after
the euro area, Germany’s largest export market, fell into
recession in the third quarter and global growth slowed. It now
predicts the German economy to expand 0.4 percent in 2013 and
1.9 percent in 2014.  “On the positive side, export expectations are now
positive again,” the Bundesbank said. “In connection with an
increase in business confidence this may point to the fact that
the period of economic weakness in  Germany  can be overcome
soon.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
