China , the world’s biggest user of
rubber, will reduce  import duties  next year, potentially
boosting purchases and curbing domestic prices. Futures in Tokyo
surged to a seven-month high.  Taxes will be either 20 percent or 1,200  yuan  ($193) a
metric ton, whichever is lower, for  imports  beginning Jan. 1,
the  Finance Ministry  said on its website today. The tariffs are
the lower of either 20 percent or 2,000 yuan a ton and either 20
percent or 1,600 yuan a ton for ribbed smoked sheets this year,
according to a previous statement from the  ministry .  Futures in Tokyo, the global benchmark, have surged 38
percent from a three year low in August after Thailand,
Indonesia and Malaysia, representing 67 percent of global
natural-rubber supply, announced export curbs and cut down aging
trees to reduce a surplus. Futures in  Shanghai , which jumped to
a two-month high, are heading for a 5 percent gain this year.  “The move may boost imports and weigh on local prices” as
they are currently higher than international prices, Chen Ruibi,
an analyst at Shanghai CIFCO Futures Co., said in a telephone
interview from Shanghai. Imports gained 3.7 percent to 1.97
million tons in the first 11 months, customs data show.  Inventories monitored by the Shanghai Futures Exchange
gained 1,131 tons to 95,927 tons, the highest since March 2010,
based on a survey of nine warehouses in Shanghai, Shandong,
Yunnan, Hainan and Tianjin, the bourse said Dec. 14.  The contract for delivery in May advanced as much as 1.6
percent 25,500 yuan a ton on the Shanghai Futures Exchange, the
highest price for the most-active contract since Oct. 19, and
was last at 25,320 yuan. The contract for delivery in May jumped
2.8 percent to 284.2 yen a kilogram ($3,385 a ton), the highest
price at close since May 10, on the  Tokyo  Commodity Exchange.  Link to Statement: { http://goo.gl/V92Se }  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
