Tokyo Electric Power Co. (9501) ’s shares
surged on speculation the  Liberal Democratic Party ’s election
victory will pave the way for the utility to restart reactors at
its Kashiwazaki Kariwa nuclear plant, the world’s biggest.  The stock, which lost more than 90 percent of its value
after the meltdown of three reactors at its Fukushima plant in
March last year, jumped 33 percent at the morning close in
 Tokyo , or by its daily limit, trading at 202 yen, the biggest
gain since Oct. 11, 2011.  “For Tepco to make a reasonable profit, the restart of
reactors at the Kashiwazaki Kariwa plant is essential,” said
Hirofumi Kawachi, an energy analyst at Mizuho Investors
Securities Co. “Investors judge the result of yesterday’s
election as a big step forward for the restart.”  All but two of  Japan ’s 50 reactors are offline for safety
checks after the Fukushima disaster. Both are in  Kansai Electric
Power Co. (9503) ’s Ohi plant north of  Osaka . The Kashiwazaki Kariwa
plant is in Niigata prefecture in northern Japan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
