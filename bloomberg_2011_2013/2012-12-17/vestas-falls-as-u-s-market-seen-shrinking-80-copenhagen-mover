Vestas Wind Systems A/S (VWS) , the worldâ€™s
largest wind turbine maker, fell the most in five days in
Copenhagen trading after its chief executive officer said the
U.S. market may contract 80 percent next year.  Vestas dropped as much as 2.7 percent, the most since Dec.
12. The stock lost 1 percent to 31.64 kroner as of 3:15 p.m. in
the Danish capital with volume traded at 55 percent of the
three-month daily average.  The U.S. market will shrink as tax breaks for green energy
production may not be renewed, CEO Ditlev Engel said in an
interview published by newspaper  Jyllands-Posten  today. The CEO,
who has presided over four quarters of earnings that have missed
analyst estimates the past year and a half, said he has no plans
to step down, according to the newspaper.  The Aarhus, Denmark-based company is struggling to make
profits as overcapacity in the industry squeezes margins. Vestas
said on Nov. 7 it will cut 3,000 more jobs and reduced its full-
year cash-flow forecast.  To contact the reporter on this story:
