German bunds fell, pushing 10-year
 yields  to the highest level in more than a week, before data
this week that economists said will show the nation’s business
confidence rose for a second month in December.  Italian 10-year government bonds advanced for a second day.
The Munich-based Ifo institute’s business climate  index  climbed
to 102 from 101.4 in November, according to the median estimate
of 43 analysts in a Bloomberg News survey, before the data is
released on Dec. 19. European Central Bank President Mario Draghi will address European parliament legislators on recent
developments in the euro area’s sovereign-debt crisis at 2:30
p.m. in Brussels.  “The Ifo is the highlight of the week and if it is
improving like other indicators it should put some pressure on
bunds,” said Christian Reicherter, an analyst at DZ Bank AG in
 Frankfurt . “There is a short-term downtrend in bunds.”  German 10-year bund yields increased two basis points, or
0.02 percentage point, to 1.37 percent at 9:07 a.m. London time,
after rising to 1.39 percent, the highest since Dec. 5. The rate
climbed five basis points last week. The 1.5 percent bond
maturing in September 2022 dropped 0.185, or 1.85 euros per
1,000-euro ($1,316) face amount, to 101.19.  Italy’s 10-year yields fell one basis point to 4.59
percent, while the nation’s two-year rate dropped four basis
points to 2.02 percent. The yield on similar-maturity Spanish
notes declined two basis points to 2.86 percent.  France  is scheduled to sell as much as 6.3 billion euros of
bills today.  German bunds returned 4.1 percent this year through Dec.
14, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. Italian debt earned
20 percent while Spanish bonds gained 5.3 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
