Nasdaq OMX Group Inc. (NDAQ) , the second-
largest U.S. equity exchange operator, said it is offering
brokers a monitoring service for London Metal Exchange trading
to help them comply with regulations.  Two broker-dealers including Newedge Group SA are signed up
to the so-called SMARTS Broker market surveillance, which covers
LME trading in the ring, on the phone and electronically, Nasdaq
said in an e-mailed statement today.  “We’ve seen a lot of interest from our customers in
relation to LME markets and commodity markets generally,” Paul
McKeown, vice president of market technology at Nasdaq OMX in
New York, said by phone Dec. 14. “This service will be focused
and targeted toward anyone who’s trading on the LME at this
point in time, who needs to conduct and carry out trade
compliance.”  Brokers will be able to monitor, identify and flag trading
activity across the three LME trading platforms, according to
 Nasdaq . “Commodities continue to become an area where greater
compliance and regulatory focus is required,” McKeown said in
the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
