Vitol Group bought three cargoes of
European  naphtha  at higher prices, adding to the 14 shipments it
purchased last week. Diesel barge premiums shrank.  Mercuria Energy Trading SA purchased a cargo of European
heating oil at a premium to January gasoil on the ICE Futures
Europe exchange.  Light Products  Vitol bought consignments of naphtha from  Royal Dutch Shell
Plc (RDSA)  and Gunvor Group Ltd., according to a survey of traders and
brokers monitoring the Platts pricing window. The lots traded
from $943 to $950 a metric ton, rising from $927 in the previous
session. That’s the highest trade in two weeks.  Naphtha’s  backwardation , or the premium of front-month
swaps to the second month, widened to the most in almost 19
months, according to data from PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a crude
and products broker in  London .  January naphtha swaps rose 1.1 percent to $925.94 a ton,
according to PVM. February swaps were at $905.40, putting the
backwardation at $20.54 a ton. That’s the widest spread since
May 23, 2011. This market structure usually indicates rising
near-term demand or declining supplies.  Naphtha’s crack, or discount to Brent, narrowed to $3.53 a
barrel from $4.32 in the previous session, PVM data showed.  Gasoline in the Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp oil hub traded
at least four times at $941 a ton, according to a survey of
traders and brokers monitoring the Argus Bulletin Board. That’s
up from $933 to $935 on Dec. 14, when prices fell to the least
since Nov. 5.  Vitol and Gunvor were buyers of Eurobob grade, to which
ethanol is added to make finished fuel.  Glencore International
Plc (GLEN) , Chevron Corp., Hess Corp.’s Hetco unit and  BP Plc (BP/)  sold
barges, which typically comprise 1,000 tons to 2,000 tons.  The fuel’s  crack , or premium to  Brent crude , rose 9 cents
to $4.97 a barrel as of 11:53 a.m. local time, PVM data showed.  Middle Distillates  OAO Lukoil’s Litasco unit sold 15,000 tons of heating oil
to Mercuria at a $5 a ton premium to January gasoil on ICE, the
survey of Platts showed. The consignment is for delivery to  Le
Havre ,  France .  In the barge market, Litasco sold  gasoil  to Total SA at a
discount of $3 to January futures. That’s stable from Dec. 13.  BP sold six of seven  diesel barges  that traded today, the
survey of Platts showed. Statoil ASA was also a seller. Vitol
and Total purchased the lots at premiums of $16 and $17 to
January gasoil, compared with trades Dec. 14 at $18.  Gasoil for January delivery dropped 25 cents to $922.50 a
ton on the ICE exchange as of 5:02 p.m. local time. February
futures were 50 cents more expensive than the front month.  Gasoil’s crack  rose to $15.80 a barrel at 4:30 p.m. versus
$14.70 on Dec. 14. Brent was little changed at $108.19 a barrel.  Refineries  OMV AG, central  Europe ’s biggest oil company, replaced the
heads of its Austrian Schwechat and German Burghausen
refineries, the company said.  Dieter Tuppinger, senior vice president at OMV Refining and
Marketing GmbH, will be in charge of the 193,000 barrel-a-day
Schwechat plant from Jan. 1, OMV said today in an e-mailed
statement.  He will replace Gerhard Wagner, who will become the head of
the Burghausen refinery, OMV said. The facility can process
72,000 barrels of crude a day, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
