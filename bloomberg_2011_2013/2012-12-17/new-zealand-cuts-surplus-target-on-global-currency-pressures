New Zealand’s projected  budget
surplus  in 2015 will be narrower than the government forecast in
May as the global slowdown, a rising currency and weak domestic
demand hinder the nation’s recovery.  The operating surplus will be NZ$66 million ($56 million)
in the year through June 2015, Finance Minister  Bill English 
said in a fiscal update released in Wellington today. That
compared to a NZ$197 million gap projected in May’s budget.  English maintained a surplus target for the period as the
Treasury Department said the economy will grow at a slower pace
in coming years. Weaker global growth will curb exports which
make up 30 percent of the economy, while New Zealand’s dollar,
the best performing Group of 10 currency this year, is forecast
to remain close to its current level on a trade-weighted basis
until the first half of 2014, it said.  “We will for some time yet see  Europe  and the U.S. deal
with the problems of low or no growth,” English told reporters.
“The high Kiwi dollar is a factor of these weaknesses offshore.
It is a headwind to our efforts to tilt the economy toward
exporting and investment.”  The projected 2014-15 surplus compares with a forecast
NZ$7.34 billion deficit in the year ending June 30, 2013. That’s
narrower than the May forecast of NZ$7.9 billion amid lower-
than-expected finance costs that offset weaker tax revenue.  The shortfall is forecast to narrow to NZ$2.01 billion in
the year through June 2014. Surpluses will then grow beyond 2015,
according to the Treasury.  Net government debt is expected to rise to 27.8 percent of
GDP in the year ending June 30, 2013, from 24.3 percent a year
earlier. Debt is likely to rise to 29.5 percent of GDP at its
peak in 2015.  The government will borrow NZ$14 billion by selling bonds
in the year ending June 30, 2013, up from the NZ$13.5 billion
program announced in May. The Debt Management Office will start
offering inflation-indexed bonds at monthly auctions from Feb. 7,
it said in a statement.  Christchurch Rebuild  Domestic demand is being hampered by cautious household
spending and rising unemployment, the Treasury said. The
government’s spending cuts are also contributing while exports
will detract from growth until 2015, reflecting increased demand
for imports for the Christchurch rebuild, the strong currency
and weak tourism inflows, it said.  New Zealand ’s annual economic growth is forecast to be 2.1
percent in the year ending March 31, the Treasury said today.
That’s weaker than the 3.3 percent pace in May’s forecasts.  Growth has slowed in the second half of 2012 after GDP
increased 1.6 percent in the six months through June. A Dec. 20
report will show third-quarter growth of 0.4 percent for an
annual pace of 2.5 percent, according to the median forecast of
12 economists in a Bloomberg survey.  Growth will accelerate to 3 percent in 2013-14 as
rebuilding earthquake-damaged Christchurch gets under way, the
Treasury said.  Christchurch, New Zealand’s third-biggest city, was hit by
a series of earthquakes in 2010-11, including a Feb. 22, 2011,
temblor that killed 185 people and shut the central business
district. Quake damage is estimated at NZ$25 billion, up from
NZ$20 billion assumed in May, and the rebuild cost is estimated
at NZ$30 billion, the Treasury said.  Growth will slow to 2.5 percent in 2014-15 and 2.4 percent
a year later, today’s report showed.  Modest growth, benign inflation and global market turmoil
add to the case for central bank Governor Graeme Wheeler to keep
the official cash rate at a record-low 2.5 percent until late
next year. Fourteen of 16 economists in a Bloomberg News survey
expect no change until at least July.  Interest rates  are likely to start rising from late 2013,
the Treasury said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
