China ’s  yuan  rebounded from its
biggest weekly loss since July after the government relaxed
foreign investment rules and the central bank strengthened the
daily fixing by the most in almost three weeks.  Authorities scrapped a ceiling on investments by overseas
sovereign wealth funds and central banks in the nation’s capital
markets on Dec. 14. The People’s Bank of China raised the
 reference rate  by 0.05 percent to 6.2892 per dollar, the biggest
increase since Nov. 27. The yuan is allowed to trade as much as
1 percent on either side of the daily fixing.  “China is looking for overseas funds to boost domestic
consumption, which is favorable for the yuan,” said  Daniel Chan , executive vice president at Glory Sky Global Markets Ltd.
in Hong Kong.  The yuan rose 0.14 percent to close at 6.2350 per dollar in
 Shanghai , according to the China Foreign Exchange Trade System.
The currency, which has advanced 1 percent this year, will gain
as much as 2 percent in 2013, Chan forecast. One-month implied
volatility, a measure of expected moves in exchange rates used
to price options, fell five basis points, or 0.05 percentage
point, to 1.9 percent.  China will “fully deepen reforms,” including increasing
urbanization and “firmly promote opening-up” the economy,
according to a report yesterday by the state-run Xinhua News
Agency after the annual central economic work conference in
Beijing.  Yuan Positions  The PBOC and financial institutions sold a net 73.6 billion
yuan ($11.8 billion) of foreign currency in November, reversing
two months of net buying and suggesting companies are betting on
gains in the currency, data published by the central bank on
Dec. 14 showed.  Yuan positions  accumulated from foreign-exchange
purchases fell to 25.7 trillion yuan last month from October.  In  Hong Kong ’s offshore market, the yuan gained 0.08
percent to 6.2158 per dollar, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards were steady at
6.3150, a 1.3 percent discount to the onshore spot rate.  The Hong Kong Monetary Authority injected HK$3.1 billion
($400 million) into its banking system on Dec. 14 to prevent the
city’s currency from rising beyond its permitted trading range.
The aggregate balance will increase to HK$242 billion tomorrow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
