Azerbaijan’s State Oil Fund, known
as Sofaz, bought an office complex in  London ’s West End for 177
million pounds ($287 million) in its first investment in real
estate to diversify reserves.  The “A” class office building erected in 1845 and fully
renovated in 2003 was bought from RREEF Real Estate, the real-
estate arm of Deutsche Bank, the Baku-based fund said by e-mail
today. The building is leased to HSBC Bank for 9.65 million
pounds until 2023.  “This newly acquired office building in London is the
first in a series of planned property acquisitions in prime
business districts of major cities around the world,” Sofaz’s
Executive Director Shahmar Movsumov said. “The secure income
that this type of investment will generate over the years
coupled with strong fundamentals of prime office spaces in major
world capitals are the determining factors in our investment
rationale.”  The fund, established in 1999 to manage the Caspian Sea
nation’s state income from oil and natural gas sales, had $33.9
billion of assets as of Dec. 1. Azeri President Ilham Aliyev
decreed in October 2011 that Sofaz may invest a maximum 5
percent of the value of its portfolio each in gold, equities and
real estate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
