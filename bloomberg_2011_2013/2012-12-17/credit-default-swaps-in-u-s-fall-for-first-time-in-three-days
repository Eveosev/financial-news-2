A benchmark gauge of U.S. company
credit risk fell for the first time in three days.  The Markit CDX North American Investment Grade Index of
credit-default swaps, which investors use to hedge against
losses on corporate debt or to speculate on creditworthiness,
declined 1.7 basis points to a mid-price of 93.5 basis points at
8:46 a.m. in  New York , according to prices compiled by
Bloomberg.  The index, which typically falls as investor confidence
improves and rises as it deteriorates, dropped even as a Federal
Reserve report showed New York-area manufacturing shrank more
than forecast in December.  The Federal Reserve Bank of New Yorkâ€™s general economic
index dropped to minus 8.1, the fifth month of contraction, from
minus 5.2 in November. The median forecast of 55 economists in a
Bloomberg survey called for minus 1. Readings of less than zero
signal contraction.  Credit swaps pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails
to meet its obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A
basis point equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10
million of debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
