The Australian dollar rose to the
strongest in 19 months versus the yen after  Japan ’s main
opposition party reclaimed power in elections yesterday on
pledges of increased fiscal and monetary stimulus.  New Zealand’s dollar touched a four-year high versus the
Japanese currency on prospects the election will add to pressure
on the Bank of Japan to expand easing as early as this week. The
so-called Aussie slid against the U.S. dollar before the Reserve
Bank of Australia releases minutes tomorrow from this month’s
meeting when interest rates were reduced. Australian bond yields
touched three-month highs.  “We had a very large lift in the dollar-yen and yen
crosses after the election result,” said  Joseph Capurso , a
Sydney-based currency strategist at Commonwealth Bank of
Australia, the nation’s biggest lender. “The RBA minutes are
likely to put a little bit of downward pressure on the Aussie
because they’re likely to indicate the RBA is still open to
further easing.”  The  Australian dollar  gained 0.5 percent to 88.67 yen as of
4:16 p.m. in Sydney from Dec. 14, after earlier touching 89.13,
the highest since May 2, 2011. The Aussie fell 0.3 percent to
$1.0540. The currency touched NZ$1.2455, the lowest since Oct.
9, before trading little changed at NZ$1.2489.  New Zealand’s dollar, known as the kiwi, reached 71.51 yen,
the strongest since October 2008, before trading at 71, 0.5
percent above the close in New York. The currency slid 0.3
percent to 84.39 U.S. cents.  Yields Climb  The yield on Australia’s 10-year government debt rose as
much as four basis points to 3.41 percent, the highest since
Sept. 17, before dropping to 3.34 percent.  In Japan, Shinzo Abe’s Liberal Democratic Party captured
294 seats in the 480-member lower house of parliament yesterday,
while Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda’s Democratic Party of Japan
lost three-fourths of its lawmakers, according to public
broadcaster NHK’s vote count. Abe has called for unlimited
easing by the  Bank of Japan. (8301)  The BOJ next meets on Dec. 19-20.  “The new government aims to lift economic growth via
further monetary stimulus, a move that has seen the yen decline
and bond yields rise in recent weeks,” Hans Kunnen, chief
economist at St. George Bank Ltd. in Sydney, wrote in a report
to clients today.  The New Zealand dollar was supported after a private report
showed an improvement in  consumer sentiment . Westpac Banking
Corp. and McDermott Miller Ltd.’s gauge of confidence rose to
111.1 in the fourth quarter, the highest since the third quarter
2011.  Best Performer  The kiwi dollar has gained 6.3 percent in 2012, the best
performer among the 10-developed-market currencies tracked by
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Currency Index. The Aussie rose
0.6 percent in the same period.  The RBA will release tomorrow the minutes of the Dec. 4
meeting when it cut its benchmark rate by a quarter percentage
point to 3 percent.  Interest-rate swaps  data compiled by
Bloomberg show traders see a 56 percent chance the central bank
will lower its benchmark to 2.75 percent in February.  The Reserve Bank will probably cut interest rates to 2
percent by the end of 2013, Australia & New Zealand Banking
Group Ltd. said in a report today.  Futures traders increased bets to a record that the
Australian dollar will gain against the greenback, figures from
the Washington-based Commodity Futures Trading Commission showed
Dec. 14. The difference in the number of wagers by hedge funds
and other large speculators on an advance in the Aussie compared
with those on a drop -- so-called  net longs  -- was 103,376 on
Dec. 11, the most in data going back to 1993 and compared with
net longs of 92,229 a week earlier.  “There’s still very strong demand for Aussie bonds from
foreign central banks,” said Commonwealth Bank of  Australia ’s
Capurso. “That’s why, when the Aussie does sell off, the
selloff’s usually fairly shallow.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
