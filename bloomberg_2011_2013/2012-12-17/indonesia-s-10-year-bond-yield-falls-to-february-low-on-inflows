Indonesia’s bonds rose, pushing the
10-year yield to the least since February, on speculation the
 Federal Reserve ’s decision to increase monetary stimulus will
spur capital flows into higher-yielding assets.  Overseas funds raised local debt holdings by 3.35 trillion
rupiah ($347 million) this month through Dec. 11, following a
record inflow of 19.5 trillion rupiah in November, official data
show. Investors bid for more than nine times the amount offered
at the government’s last securities auction of the year on Dec.
3. Ten-year notes yield 5.23 percent in Indonesia, compared with
1.72 percent on U.S. Treasuries. The Fed announced on Dec. 12 it
will start purchasing $45 billion of Treasuries each month
starting in January.  “Bonds have room to rally as there is limited supply
because there are no more government auctions, while the Fed
stimulus increases investor appetite and capital flows into
 Indonesia ,” said Raditya Ariwibowo, a Jakarta-based research
analyst in the treasury division at PT Bank Negara Indonesia.  The yield on the government’s 7 percent bonds due in May
2022 fell one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 5.23
percent as of 3:24 p.m. in Jakarta, prices from the Inter Dealer
Market Association show. It fell to 5.22 percent earlier, the
lowest level since Feb. 15. The yield dropped 80 basis points
this year and reached a record low of 5.05 percent on Feb. 9.  Bank Indonesia  submitted a proposal to parliament to
redenominate the rupiah starting in 2014, with each new unit
equating to 1,000 of the existing currency, Perry Warjiyo,
 executive director  for economic research and monetary policy,
said on Dec. 14.  The rupiah snapped a two-day gain, weakening 0.1 percent to
9,645 per dollar, prices from local banks compiled by Bloomberg
show. The currency reached a three-year low of 9,733 on Dec. 10.
One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves in
exchange rates used to price options, was unchanged at 5.7
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
