Royal KPN NV, the Dutch phone
company that scrapped its dividend to buy faster wireless
networks frequencies, led declines in corporate bonds after it
was cut by Fitch Ratings and as issuance stalled in the run-up
to the holiday break.  The relative yield on the company’s 700 million euros ($920
million) of 5.625 percent notes due 2024 increased seven basis
points to 237 basis points, the most since Nov. 20, according to
Bloomberg generic prices, after it bought 1.35 billion euros of
frequencies. The last European non-financial company to sell
benchmark bonds in the single currency was  Telecom Italia SpA (TIT) ,
which priced a 1 billion-euro deal on Dec. 14.  “It’s the end of the year and a lot of investors have shut
their books for the year,” said Simon Ballard, a credit
strategist at National Australia Bank in London. “Secondary
market volumes are very muted, which makes pricing very
sensitive to headline risk.”  Phone companies are spending cash to upgrade their networks
to accommodate smartphones such as Apple Inc.’s iPhone and
handsets based on Google Inc.’s Android software, forcing them
to cut or scrap dividends. Bond issuance has ground to a halt as
investors head off on vacation or shun new deals to lock in
returns that have reached 12.58 percent this year, according to
Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s Euro Corporate Index.  Relative Yields  KPN’s purchase of wireless frequency triggered a downgrade
from Fitch Ratings, which lowered the  credit  grade one level to
the cusp of junk at BBB-. The company paid almost 1 billion
euros more for the frequency than Fitch expected, the ratings
firm said.  KPN, based in The Hague, said Dec. 14 that it won’t pay a
final dividend for 2012 and that next year’s payout will be 3
cents a share, compared with its 12-cent interim dividend.
Relative yields on the company’s 500 million euros of 4.5
percent notes due 2021 increased eight basis points to 215.7
basis points, the widest since Nov. 20.  Indexes of credit-default swaps held at, or close to, the
lowest levels since mid-2011.  The  Markit iTraxx Financial Index  of credit-default swaps
on the senior debt of 25 banks and insurers fell 92.7 basis
points to 149.5 at 12:50 p.m. in  London , close to the 18-month
low of 145 reached during trading on Dec. 6. The subordinated
financials index fell 9.5 basis points to 250.8. A closing price
at this level would be the lowest since May 20, 2011.  The Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of credit-default swaps
on 50 companies with mostly high-yield ratings fell 0.9 basis
point to 461.6, holding close to the 17-month low it reached on
Sept. 14.  To contact the reporter on this story:
