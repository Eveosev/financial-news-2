Enzon Pharmaceuticals Inc. (ENZN) , a
developer of cancer treatments, said it’s considering selling
all or part of the business after billionaire investor  Carl Icahn  expressed interest in talking to the company.  Lazard Ltd. (LAZ)  was hired to help explore the possibility of a
sale, Piscataway, New Jersey-based Enzon said today in a
statement. To conserve cash, Enzon suspended development and
testing of its androgen receptor treatment.  Icahn said Nov. 28 he had informed the company that he
wanted to discuss its operations, direction and plans to manage
expenses, according to a regulatory filing. Icahn’s firm owned
13.3 percent of Enzon shares as of Nov. 9. Enzon has a treatment
for breast and colorectal cancer in the second of three stages
of development typically needed to get regulatory approval.  “Enzon’s drug candidates and technologies offer the
potential for a variety of transactions,”  Alex Denner , chairman
of Enzon’s board, said in the statement.  Enzon rose 3 percent to $4.71 at 4 p.m. New York time. The
shares have fallen 30 percent this year, giving the company a
market value of $209 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
