The Australian dollar held losses
after the nation’s  Reserve Bank  cited a softer labor market for
cutting  interest rates  at this month’s meeting.  The  Reserve Bank of Australia  said growth is stabilizing in
 China , according to minutes of the Dec. 4 meeting when it cut
its overnight cash-rate target to 3 percent. Losses in the so-
called Aussie were limited after the Conference Board’s gauge of
leading economic indicators in  Australia  rose in October. New
Zealand’s dollar remained lower after the Treasury Department
lowered its  budget surplus  forecast for 2015.  “The Aussie got sold first on expectations of additional
rate cuts from the RBA,” said Takuya Kawabata, a researcher in
Tokyo at Gaitame.com Research Institute Ltd. “The Aussie was
then bought back as the market digested some the positive
comments about Chinese growth. The RBA may wait and see for a
little while before resuming rate cuts next year.”  The  Australian dollar  slid 0.1 percent to $1.0540 as of
4:26 p.m. in Sydney from yesterday, when it fell 0.1 percent to
$1.0552. The Aussie bought 88.51  yen  from 88.52 yesterday, when
it touched 89.13, the highest since May 2011.  New Zealand ’s dollar, known as the kiwi, lost 0.1 percent
to 84.38 U.S. cents from yesterday, when it declined 0.2
percent. The currency was little changed at 70.86 yen.  The yield on Australia’s 10-year government  debt  rose three
basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 3.38 percent from
yesterday, when it touched 3.41 percent, the highest since Sept.
17.  RBA Minutes  Labor data “suggested that the inflation outlook still
afforded the board some scope to provide additional support to
demand,” according to the RBA’s minutes released today in
Sydney. It also cited “further confirmation that the peak in
resource sector investment was near.”  The cut in the benchmark rate by 25 basis points to 3
percent by Governor  Glenn Stevens  and his board matches the
level reached from April-October 2009 that was the lowest since
1960.  Interest-rate swaps  data compiled by Bloomberg show
traders see a 53 percent chance the central bank will lower its
benchmark to 2.75 percent in February.  “The RBA minutes are relatively balanced,” said Greg Gibbs, a Singapore-based senior currency strategist at Royal
Bank of Scotland Group Plc. “It does not sound that there will
be deep further rate cuts.”  The New York-based Conference Board’s  index  of Australian
leading economic indicators climbed 0.2 percent in October from
the previous month, when it fell a revised 0.4 percent,
according to a report released in an e-mailed statement.  Budget Forecast  New Zealand Finance Minister  Bill English  said the
operating surplus will be NZ$66 million ($56 million) in the
year through June 2015, according to the fiscal update released
in Wellington today. That compared to a NZ$197 million gap
projected in May’s budget. Growth will slow to 2.5 percent in
2014-15 and 2.4 percent a year later, the report forecast.  “We will for some time yet see  Europe  and the U.S. deal
with the problems of low or no growth,” English told reporters.
“The high kiwi dollar is a factor of these weaknesses offshore.
It is a headwind to our efforts to tilt the economy toward
exporting and investment.”  New Zealand’s dollar has risen 6.2 percent so far this
year, the best performer tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-
Weighted Currency indexes. The Australian dollar has gained 0.4
percent in the same period.  To contact the reporters on this story:
