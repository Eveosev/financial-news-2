Hulu.com, the online television
service, said revenue climbed 65 percent to about $695 million
this year as paying subscribers more than doubled.  Hulu had more than 3 million customers paying $8 a month to
watch shows on TVs, computers and mobile devices, compared with
fewer than 1.5 million a year ago, Chief Executive Officer  Jason Kilar  said today on the Los Angeles-based company’s  website .  The company, controlled by News Corp.’s Fox,  Comcast
Corp. (CMCSA) ’s NBC Universal and  Walt Disney Co. (DIS) ’s ABC, is adding
paying subscribers as the service becomes available on more
mobile devices. Hulu can be accessed on more than 320 million
Web-connected devices in the U.S., with subscriptions required
to watch on smartphones, tablets, video-game consoles and TVs.
Hulu’s free service is available on PCs.  The company also expanded the roster of advertisers, Kilar
said. In 2012, more than 1,000 marketers placed ads on Hulu, a
28 percent increase from a year ago. Hulu began charging only
for ads that are streamed in full this year.  Providence Equity Partners Inc., which co-founded Hulu in
2006 with Fox and NBC, sold its 10 percent stake in October for
about $200 million, valuing the service at about $2 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
