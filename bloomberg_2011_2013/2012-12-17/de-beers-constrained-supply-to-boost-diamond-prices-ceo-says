Diamond prices, headed for the first
annual drop in four years, are set to get a boost in 2013 as De
Beers, the world’s biggest producer, constrains supply.  De Beers, owned by  Anglo American Plc (AAL) , forecasts that it
will produce about 27 million carats this year, a 14 percent
decline from 2011. It expects stable production in 2013,
bolstering prices that have slumped 16 percent this year.  “The supply is going to be constrained next year so we
have an opportunity for further price growth in 2013,” Chief
Executive Officer Philippe Mellier said in an interview with
Bloomberg Television. “This year we’re going to produce around
27 million, we will be around that number next year.”  Rough diamond prices have slumped 16 percent this year as
Asian purchases slowed and the euro region debt crisis eroded
demand, according to data compiled by WWW International Diamond
Consultants Ltd. Prices have risen by more than 20 percent in
each of the past three years as producers struggled to keep pace
with consumption.  De Beers ’ 2012 production will be the lowest since 2009
when it slashed output by 50 percent amid the global financial
crisis. The 27 million carats it plans to produce this year
represents a 43 percent decline from its pre-crisis output in
2008.  “We are now focusing a lot of our effort to try to see
where to mine, when to mine so that we can produce the right
diamonds and the right quantity to suit the market,” said
Mellier. “We adapt to the marketplace.”  Aging Assets  Diamond producers have struggled to find new large mines to
replace aging assets. Production at many of the biggest mines is
falling as supplies of more accessible diamonds near the surface
are depleted.  BHP Billiton Ltd. agreed to sell its Ekati diamond mine in
 Canada  to Harry Winston Diamond Mines Ltd. for $500 million last
month as part of a plan to focus on long-term, low-cost assets.  De Beers’s Orapa mine in Botswana began output in 1971,
while its Jwaneng project, the world’s largest diamond mine by
production value, and Rio Tinto Group’s Argyle started in 1982.
The last major mine to enter production was Rio’s Diavik in
2003. Diamond production slid 8.5 percent to 161.1 million
carats in 2008 from 2005.  The use of diamonds may expand at double the pace of supply
through 2020 because of a growing middle class in China and
 India , according to Bain & Co., the consulting firm. Bain
forecasts that pre-crisis supply won’t return until 2017.  Chinese Demand  Mellier, 57 and a mechanical engineer with a background in
cars and trains, was appointed as CEO in May 2011 as De Beers
broke with a tradition of promoting internally.  Growing Chinese demand will help bolster prices next year
as miners struggle to keep pace with growing consumption in
emerging economies.  Chinese and Indian demand accounted for about 20 percent of
global diamond demand this year and that share will rise to 28
percent in 2016 as the diamond market grows from $23 billion to
$31 billion, according to an Anglo American presentation last
month.  The diamond market will grow about 3 percent to 4 percent
this year compared with growth of 10 percent in 2011, Mellier
said. De Beers forecasts “at least this type of growth” again
in 2013.  The U.S. market, the biggest consumer of diamonds, will
expand 3 percent to 4 percent next year, while  China  will grow
at about 10 percent. Indian demand will expand at a “minimum”
of 5 percent after a “disappointing” 2012 when demand was
flat, the CEO said.  Better Year  “As a whole, U.S. steady growth, China increased growth,
India coming back. I think 2013 should be better than 2012 so
the prospect for growth is there,” Mellier said.  Anglo American bought the Oppenheimer family’s 40 percent
in De Beers for $5.1 billion this year, increasing the company’s
holding to 85 percent and ending the dynasty’s 80-year ownership
of De Beers. Botswana owns the rest of the business.  Formed by British colonist Cecil John Rhodes more than 120
years ago, De Beers mines diamonds in  South Africa , Canada,
Botswana and  Namibia . Founded in Kimberley, where diamond
diggings established South Africa’s mining industry, De Beers
was named after a nearby farm. Ernest Oppenheimer, who founded
Anglo in 1917, took control in the 1920s.  His son and grandson, Harry and Nicky, built De Beers into
a business that now supplies about a third of the world’s rough
diamonds.  To contact the reporters on this story:
