Vodafone Group Plc (VOD)  fell the most in
more than a month on concern that a 1.4 billion-euro ($1.84
billion) spectrum purchase in a Dutch government auction will
herald higher prices for frequencies to carry faster mobile
services.  Vodafone dropped as much as 3.1 percent to 156 pence in
London trading, the biggest intraday decline since Nov. 13, and
was down 2.8 percent as of 10:47 a.m. The stock had fallen 10
percent this year through Dec. 14.  The Dutch government raised 3.8 billion euros on Friday
from Vodafone, Royal KPN NV, Deutsche Telekom’s T-Mobile unit
and  Tele2 AB (TEL2B)  as the carriers bought the rights to airwaves that
will carry signals on faster fourth-generation networks. The
U.K. government is planning a similar auction that will begin in
2013.  The “losers are all the telco operators and specifically
Vodafone, which will have to participate and pay in auctions all
over Europe,” Saeed Baradar, an analyst for  Societe Generale  in
London, said in a note. U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer  George Osborne  “must be very excited about the prospects for upcoming
U.K. auctions where the renewal cost of the original 2G spectrum
will be priced off the 4G auctions.”  KPN, the Dutch phone company partly owned by  Carlos Slim ’s
 America Movil (AMX)  SAB, today had its biggest indraday drop in 11
years after it cut its dividend to pay 1.35 billion euros for
Dutch frequencies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
