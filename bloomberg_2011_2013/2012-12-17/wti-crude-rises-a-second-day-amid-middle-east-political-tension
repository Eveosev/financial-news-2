Crude futures advanced a second day
in  New York  as concern that tensions in the  Middle East  may
curtail oil exports countered signs of weaker growth in the U.S.  West Texas Intermediate rose as much as 52 cents, or 0.6
percent. Prices gained even as manufacturing in the New York
region shrank more than forecast in December, showing weakness
in the industry is persisting as the year draws to a close.
Syrian forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad are massing
near a Palestinian camp a day after air attacks on the site
killed eight civilians.  WTI for January delivery was at $87.03 a barrel, up 30
