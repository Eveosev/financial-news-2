Russian capital outflows were half
the amount reported by the central bank last year, according to
a study by Ernst & Young, the Russian Direct Investment Fund and
Moscow State University’s Intelligent Reserve Center.  Only $40.5 billion of the $80.5 billion of net outflows
recorded in 2011 was genuine, according to a report e-mailed
today.  More than $10 billion was mergers and acquisitions by
Russian companies, $9.9 billion was “errors and omissions” by
the regulator, as much as $9 billion was investment through
offshore jurisdictions, $6 billion was Russian banking
subsidiaries supporting their parent companies and $6 billion
was spent on aircraft registered abroad, the researchers said.  Capital outflow from the world’s largest energy exporter
has reached $363 billion since 2007, the last full year of net
inflows, central bank data show. In his first state-of-the-
nation address since returning to the presidency in May,
President Vladimir Putin on Dec. 12 urged lawmakers to proceed
with legislation to repatriate capital held by companies and
high-ranking officials abroad.  Outflows will reach as much as $65 billion in 2012, Finance
Minister Anton Siluanov said Dec. 12. The ruble has gained 4.4
percent against the dollar this year, data compiled by Bloomberg
show.  The researchers said their findings were comparable to
 World Bank data , which put 2011 outflows at $32.3 billion, based
on private capital flows from direct and portfolio investment.
Outflows were $10.9 billion in 2010, compared with the official
$34.4 billion estimate, $9.3 billion instead of $56.1 billion in
2009 and $16 billion rather than $133.7 billion in 2008,
according to the World Bank.  Capital outflows from  Russia  were equal to almost 5 percent
of gross domestic product last year, compared with almost 20
percent in  Norway  and 35 percent in  Kuwait , according to today’s
study. There’s no statistical relationship between capital flows
and indicators of the investment climate, the researchers said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
