Uranium One Inc. (UUU) , which mines the
raw material used in reactor fuel, rose to its highest in six
weeks in Toronto after Japan’s pro-nuclear Liberal Democratic
Party won a landslide election victory.  Uranium One  rose  4.5 percent to C$2.10 in Toronto, its
highest since the end of October. Shares of the Vancouver-based
company have declined 2.8 percent this year. Cameco Corp., the
world’s third-largest uranium producer, rose 2.9 percent to
C$19.84.  Paladin Energy Ltd. (PDN) , an Australian-based producer,
climbed 11 percent to C$1.04.  The LDP, led by Shinzo Abe, yesterday captured a two-thirds
majority in Japan’s lower house of parliament.  “The LDP governed Japan for much of the postwar period and
is seen as being favorable towards nuclear power,”  Greg Barnes ,
a Toronto-based analyst at TD Securities Inc., said today in a
note to clients.  Japan moved to shut down its atomic reactors after last
year’s tsunami and earthquake triggered a meltdown at  Tokyo
Electric Power Co. (9501) ’s Fukushima Dai-Ichi nuclear power plant. The
LDP campaigned on Japan’s need to restart the reactors to cut
the cost of importing natural gas and coal to fire conventional
power stations.  The spot price of uranium has fallen 36 percent since March
10, 2011, the day before the earthquake and tsunami struck.  Cameco was the third-largest uranium miner last year after
Kazatomprom, Kazakhstan’s state-owned producer, and Paris-based
 Areva SA (AREVA) , according to the World Nuclear Association.  To contact the reporter on this story:
