President  Barack Obama  spoke of a town’s immeasurable pain and a nation’s sorrow after meeting with families of those slain in a massacre of children and teachers in a Connecticut school.  Obama’s visit yesterday to Newtown, a community of 28,000, marked the fourth time during his presidency he has gone to a city to console relatives after a mass shooting, this one the second-deadliest in U.S. history. This time, he faces unprecedented pressure to address  gun control , yet he offered no specific cures for what he called “carnage.”  “I come to offer the love and prayers of a nation,” Obama said at a memorial at Newtown High School. “I am very mindful that mere words cannot match the depths of your sorrow, nor can they heal your wounded hearts.”  Hours before the president’s remarks,  Connecticut State Police  Lieutenant Paul Vance told reporters that detectives are tracing the origins of the firearms used to kill 28 people Dec. 14, including the gunman, who took his own life. The shooter had hundreds of rounds left, Vance said.  Vance identified the gunman as Adam Lanza, 20. The rampage, which also left his mother, Nancy, 52, dead at the family home nearby, brought worldwide attention to the town about 60 miles (97 kilometers) northeast of  New York City  and plunged residents into despair.  In Together  “Whatever measure of comfort we can provide, we will provide,” Obama said. “Whatever portion of sadness that we can share with you to ease this heavy load, we will gladly bear it.”  “Newtown, you are not alone.”  As the president spoke for about 20 minutes, sobs broke out in the front rows.  All 26 children and adults killed were shot more than once, and some as many as 11 times, according to H. Wayne Carver II, the state’s  medical examiner . The victims ranged in age from 6 to 56. The children -- 12 girls and eight boys -- were all 6 or 7 years old, and the adults were all women.  It was the worst U.S. massacre since 33 people died in a 2007 rampage at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University in Blacksburg, Virginia. This year, there have been at least seven mass murders -- killings of four or more people - - that claimed at least 65 lives in the U.S.  ‘Endless Series’  This month, three died when a gunman opened fire inside a mall in suburban  Portland ,  Oregon . In August, a shooter took six lives at a Sikh temple in Oak Creek,  Wisconsin . In July, a masked gunman opened fire at a midnight movie in Aurora,  Colorado , killing 12 and injuring 58.  “There have been an endless series of deadly shootings across the country, almost daily reports of victims, many of them children, in small towns and in big cities all across America,” Obama said. “We can’t tolerate this anymore. These tragedies must end.”  In Newtown, the most recent mass murder began on the morning of Dec. 14.  Nancy Lanza was the first to die after suffering gunshots to the head, said Kathy Wilson, an investigator at the state medical examiner’s office. The guns used in the shootings belonged to her, according to a  law-enforcement  official who asked for anonymity because of a continuing investigation.  Wide-Eyed  Adam Lanza was “on medication,” Louise Tambascio, a friend of Nancy Lanza for 12 years, told CBS’s “60 Minutes” last night. The mother didn’t work and she had home-schooled her son, she said.  The killer, seen in a picture published by NBC News staring wide-eyed into a camera beneath brown bangs, attempted to buy at least one gun before the shooting, said a federal law- enforcement official who asked for anonymity because the investigation was continuing.  About 9:30 a.m., police received a call from the school, attended by about 700 children in kindergarten through fourth grade, after the gunman forced his way inside, Vance said.  A survivor, school nurse Sally Cox, said in an interview that aired last night on “60 Minutes” that exterior doors are locked at 9:15 a.m., five minutes after the Pledge of Allegiance. Lanza shot out a window, she said.  Cox and a secretary ducked beneath their desks, and Lanza walked into their office. Peering through a hole cut in the desk to accommodate electronics cords, Cox said, she saw his legs come to a stop. He walked back out, and moments later she heard screams and more shots.  Burials Begin  The fourth-grade daughter of Curt Brantl was in the school’s library during the attack.  “The town is full of grief and is desperate for some hope,” he said in an interview at the high school memorial. “Funerals are starting tomorrow. That’s going to be hard.”  Some say these funerals should be the last of their sort. New York City Mayor  Michael Bloomberg  led a chorus of gun- control advocates calling for new and stricter gun laws.  Obama hasn’t made enough of an effort to ban ownership of assault weapons and restrict sales to criminals and mentally ill buyers, he said. The mayor, who is co-chairman of the group Mayors Against Illegal Guns and the founder and majority owner of Bloomberg News parent Bloomberg LP, spoke on NBC’s “Meet the Press” program.  The president said that he would use his office to persuade Americans to prevent more such massacres, though he didn’t offer concrete measures.  “In the coming weeks, I’ll use whatever power this office holds to engage my fellow citizens, from law enforcement, to mental-health professionals, to parents and educators, in an effort aimed at preventing more tragedies like this, because what choice do we have?” he said. “We can’t accept events like this as routine.”  To contact the reporters on this story: Esme E.
