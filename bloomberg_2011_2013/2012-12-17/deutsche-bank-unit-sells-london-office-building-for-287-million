Deutsche Bank AG’s RREEF real estate
affiliate sold an office building in central  London ’s St.
James’s neighborhood to Azerbaijan’s State Oil Fund for 177.4
million pounds ($287 million).  The building was sold on behalf of RREEF’s Grundbesitz-
Europa fund, the Deutsche Bank unit said in a statement today.
The property is being leased by HSBC Bank Plc for 9.65 million
pounds a year through 2023, according to the statement. Located
near Buckingham Palace in London’s West End, it’s listed for
historic preservation and has a modern extension to the rear.  The property was sold “to capitalize on the growing demand
for London properties from overseas,” James Petit, RREEF’s head
of U.K. and Ireland, said in the statement. “London is and will
remain an important investment market for the fund.”  The Grundbesitz-Europa fund is seeking to buy more real
estate in the U.K., according to the statement. About a third of
its assets are London properties. It bought an office building
in the  City of London  financial district for 150.3 million
pounds in March, according to a statement at the time. The
property is leased in part by Bloomberg LP, parent of  Bloomberg
