Treasuries slid, pushing benchmark
10-year yields to a six-week high, as optimism increased that
talks are progressing on a budget deal in  Washington  that would
head off a recession in the world’s biggest economy.  The government sold $35 billion of two-year debt to lower-
than-average demand. The offering’s  bid-to-cover  ratio, which
gauges demand by comparing total bids with the amount offered,
fell to 3.59, the least since February, after matching a record-
high 4.07 last month. The Treasury will auction $35 billion in
five year debt tomorrow in the second of four note sales this
week totaling $113 billion. U.S. one-month bill rates fell below
zero for a second day.  “I’m surprised by the magnitude of the move in Treasury
yields today,” said  Ian Lyngen , a government-bond strategist at
CRT Capital Group LLC in  Stamford ,  Connecticut . “There’s more
optimism that we’re closer to a fiscal-cliff deal of some
sort.”  The  10-year note yield  climbed seven basis points, or 0.07
percentage point, to 1.77 percent, at 5 p.m. in New York,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. It touched 1.78
percent, the highest level since Nov. 2, surpassing its 200-day
moving average of 1.75 percent. The price of the 1.625 percent
security due in November 2022 dropped 5/8, or $6.25 per $1,000
face amount, to 98 21/32.  Thirty-year bond  yields rose eight basis points to 2.95
percent, also the highest since Nov. 2, and the yield on the
current  two-year note  increased two basis point to 0.25 percent.  Negative Rates  One-month  bill rates  fell to as low as negative 0.005
percent before trading at zero. They reached that level Dec. 14
as traders bet temporary government insurance on some bank-
deposit accounts will end as scheduled on Dec. 31 after a Senate
effort to extend it failed. That would trigger a flow of several
hundred billion dollars into Treasury bills, repurchase
agreements and money funds that purchase  government securities ,
according to Fed primary dealers including Bank of America Corp.  Treasuries have returned 2.3 percent this year, set for the
worst performance since a 3.7 percent decline in 2009, a Bank of
America Merrill Lynch index shows. The Standard & Poor’s 500
Index of U.S. stocks has  returned  16 percent, including
reinvested dividends, after a 2.1 percent return last year.  U.S. government securities traded today at the least
expensive levels in more than five weeks. The 10-year term
premium, a model created by economists at the Fed that includes
expectations for  interest rates , growth and inflation, was
negative 0.78 percent, the least costly since Oct. 25.  A negative reading indicates investors are willing to
accept yields below what’s considered fair value. The average
this year is negative 0.77 percent.  Fiscal Cliff  Treasuries fell as President  Barack Obama  and House Speaker
 John Boehner  met at the White House in their talks to avert more
than $600 billion in automatic spending cuts and tax increases
in January, according to Boehner’s spokesman.  Obama is considering a possible budget concession on Social
Security cost-of-living increases after Boehner dropped his
opposition to raising tax rates for some top earners, according
to two people familiar with the private talks who requested
anonymity. Obama seeks an income-tax increase for top earners,
while Boehner wants to cut spending on entitlement programs.  If officials fail to reach agreement and push the economy
over the fiscal cliff of spending cuts and tax boosts, the
result may be a recession next year, according to the
Congressional Budget office.  Note Auctions  The U.S. will sell $29 billion of seven-year notes on Dec.
19 and $14 billion of five-year Treasury Inflation Protected
Securities on Dec. 20.  “The amount of supply hitting the market this week is
putting pressure on Treasuries,” said  Michael Franzese , senior
vice president of fixed-income trading at ED&F Man Capital
Markets in New York.  The Treasury notes  sold today  drew a yield of 0.245
percent, the lowest since July, compared with an average
forecast of 0.247 percent in a Bloomberg News survey of six of
the  Federal Reserve ’s 21 primary dealers.  Indirect bidders , an investor class that includes foreign
central banks, purchased 17.7 percent of the two-year notes, the
lowest on record going back to 2003. That compared with 34.4
percent last month and an average of 31.6 percent for the past
10 sales.  Direct bidders , non-primary-dealer investors that place
their bids directly with the Treasury, purchased 28.4 percent,
compared with 23.6 percent in November and a record 38.2 percent
at the October sale. The average as the past 10 offerings was
16.1 percent.  Record High  Last month’s two-year auction drew a bid-to-cover ratio of
4.07, matching a record sale high set in November 2011. The
average for the past 10 auctions was 3.82.  Two-year notes have returned 0.3 percent this year,
according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes. The
securities gained 1.5 percent in 2011, while Treasuries overall
returned 9.8 percent.  China , the largest foreign holder of Treasuries, boosted
its  holdings  of the securities by $7.9 billion, or 0.7 percent,
in October during the U.S. presidential election campaign to
$1.1615 trillion, Treasury data showed today. China held
$1.153.6 trillion of Treasuries in September, a decrease from
the $1.1555 trillion reported for the previous month.  To contact the reporters on this story:
