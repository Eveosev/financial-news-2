The  New York  Mets’ Citi Field will
host a pair of college lacrosse games in March 2013, with the
University of Michigan part of a four-team field that includes
Patriot League rivals Colgate, Holy Cross and Navy.  Michigan will face Colgate in the first game of the
inaugural Metropolitan Lacrosse Classic on March 17, while the
U.S. Naval Academy meets Holy Cross. They will be the first
National Collegiate Athletic Association lacrosse games played
at Citi Field in the New York City borough of Queens.  “Lacrosse is immensely popular in our community and we are
thrilled to bring together these four prestigious
universities,” Mets executive vice president of business
operations Dave Howard said in a statement.  The Michigan-Colgate game will be televised on ESPNU and
the Navy-Holy Cross matchup will be aired on ESPN3.  Colgate went 14-4 last season and advanced to the
quarterfinals of the NCAA tournament, while  Michigan  in 2012
completed its first season of varsity lacrosse after winning
three straight national club team titles from 2008-10.  To contact the reporter on this story:
