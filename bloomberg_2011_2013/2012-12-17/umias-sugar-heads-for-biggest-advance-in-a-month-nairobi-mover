Mumias Sugar Co., (MSUG)   Kenya ’s biggest
miller of the sweetener, headed for its biggest advance in a
month.  The stock climbed 3.1 percent to 4.95 shillings by 1:40
p.m. in the capital, Nairobi, its first gain in three trading
days. The increase would be the biggest since Nov. 19 and the
highest level since Nov. 30. More than one million shares
traded, or 80 percent of the three-month daily average volume,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Kenya’s only publicly traded sugar company has declined 7
percent this year while the  Nairobi Securities Exchange All-
Share Index (NSEASI)  has rallied 37 percent. The 14-day relative strength
index for Mumias closed at 27.8 on Dec. 14, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. A level below 30 signals to some
technical analysts that the stock is oversold and set for a
rise.  The RSI identifies possible turning points in indexes or
securities by measuring the degree to which gains and losses
outpace each other in a given period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
