The  New York Mets  sent R.A. Dickey
to the  Toronto Blue Jays  in a seven-player swap, trading away
the National League’s reigning Cy Young Award winner one year
after parting ways with batting champion  Jose Reyes .  Dickey yesterday agreed on a three-year, $29 million
contract with the  Blue Jays  that cleared the way for the trade
to be completed, the Major League Baseball team said in a
statement. The deal includes a $12 million team option for 2016.  Dickey, 38, had a 20-6 record with a 2.73 earned run
average for the Mets last season, becoming the first
knuckleballer in major league history to win a Cy Young award as
his league’s best pitcher. He joins David Cone,  Pedro Martinez 
and  Roger Clemens  as the only Cy Young winners to be traded the
offseason after receiving the award.  “I’m hopeful in coming years that our overall popularity
will be more a function of our success than individuals,” Mets
General Manager  Sandy Alderson  told reporters. “This is an
entertainment business and it was great to have R.A. here. And
yet we felt in the best interest of the organization that this
was the right thing to do.”  Catchers Josh Thole and Mike Nickeas also were sent to
Toronto, while the Mets received two of the Blue Jays’ top
prospects in catcher Travis d’Arnaud and right-handed pitcher
Noah Syndergaard. New York also got catcher John Buck and 18-
year-old minor-league outfielder Wuilmer Becerra, the Mets said
in an e-mailed statement.  Cy Youngs  Clemens was the last pitcher dealt following a Cy Young-
winning season, going from Toronto to the  New York Yankees  in
1999. A year earlier, Martinez was traded to the  Boston Red Sox 
from the Montreal Expos, and in 1995 Cone joined the Blue Jays
from the  Kansas City Royals .  Catfish Hunter, Mark Davis and Greg Maddux changed clubs as
free agents after winning Cy Youngs.  Dickey last season became the Mets’ first Cy Young
recipient since  Dwight Gooden  in 1985 and the franchise’s first
20-game winner since Frank Viola in 1990. His 230 strikeouts led
the NL.  Dickey’s 2012 performance was one of the few bright spots
during a season in which the Mets finished 74-88, 24 games
behind the  Washington Nationals  in the  National League East .
They missed the playoffs for the sixth straight season and 11th
in the last 12. Last offseason, the Mets dealt Reyes to the
 Miami Marlins  for two draft picks.  Dickey had a 39-28 record with a 2.95 ERA in three seasons
with the Mets after going 22-28 with a 5.43 ERA over his first
seven years in the majors. Alderson said it was a privilege to
have Dickey on the team.  ‘Extraordinary Career’  “The final chapter has not been written, but it has been
an extraordinary career, arcing from disappointment to
jubilation,” Alderson said.  Dickey joins a Toronto starting pitching rotation that
features Josh Johnson,  Mark Buehrle , Brandon Morrow and Ricky Romero. The Blue Jays acquired Johnson and Buehrle from the
Marlins last month along with Reyes and outfielder Emilio Bonifacio. Melky Cabrera, an All-Star who batted .346 last
season with the  San Francisco Giants  prior to a performance-
enhancing drug ban, also signed with Toronto.  The Blue Jays went 73-89 last season, 22 games back of the
American League East Division-winning Yankees.  “We just felt we were so close to contention, this is a
deal we had to make,” Blue Jays general manager Alex
Anthopolous said of adding Dickey.  D’Arnaud, 23, is Toronto’s top prospect and Syndergaard,
20, ranks third, according to  Baseball America . Both are former
first-round draft picks.  D’Arnaud’s Upside  D’Arnaud was drafted 37th by Philadelphia in 2007 and
traded to Toronto as part of the deal that brought Cy Young
Award winner  Roy Halladay  to the Phillies. In 67 games with
Triple-A Las Vegas last season, he hit .333 with 16 home runs
and 52 runs batted in. D’Arnaud missed the final two months of
the season after tearing a ligament in his left knee.  D’Arnaud was voted the Eastern League’s Most Valuable
Player in 2011 after hitting .311 with 33 doubles, 21 home runs,
78 runs batted in and 72 runs scored.  “His upside is such that he could be a significant player
for us over the next many years,” Alderson said. “We
understand he has not done anything at the major league level,
but given his ceiling, his position and what we think he can do,
he can be a difference-maker.”  Syndergaard, 20, was selected 38th by Toronto in the 2010
draft. In Single-A play last season in Lansing, Michigan, he
went 8-5 with a 2.60 ERA, striking out 122 while walking 31.
Alderson said Syndergaard is a “very high-ceiling power
pitcher” who could make his major league debut in 2014 or 2015.  Buck’s Statistics  Buck, 32, has 48 homers over the past three seasons, the
third-most in the majors among catchers behind Brian McCann (63)
and Matt Wieters (53). Buck was an All-Star in 2010, when he hit
20 home runs and drove in 66 runs for the Blue Jays, though he
hit just .192 with 12 homers and 41 RBIs in 106 games for the
Marlins last season.  Becerra, who’s from Venezuela and is the son of former St.
Louis Cardinals scout Wilmer Becerra, appeared in 11 games with
the rookie-level Gulf Coast Blue Jays last season and hit .250
with four doubles and four RBIs.  To contact the reporters on this story:
