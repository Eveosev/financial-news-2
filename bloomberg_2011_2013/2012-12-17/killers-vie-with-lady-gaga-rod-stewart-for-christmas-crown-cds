Rod Stewart , the subject of music
industry derision for decades, was greeted with predictable
guffaws when he released “ Merry Christmas , Baby.”  The star’s coolness rating has never recovered from the
self-mocking “Do Ya Think I’m Sexy?” in 1978. Festive albums
are usually about as sophisticated as party hats and mistletoe
kisses and this is no exception.  As the critics take pot shots, Rod is crying all the way to
the bank. The CD has joined his American Songbook releases as
among his bestselling on both sides of the Atlantic.  You’ll probably only want to hear it for about a week of
the year, though the title track, featuring Stewart’s husky
voice, Cee Lo Green’s soulful crooning and Trombone Shorty, is
fun. Rating: **  The same song shows up on “Cee Lo’s Magic Moment.”
Green’s collection has more imaginative material, including a
powerful reworking of one of Joni Mitchell’s best laments,
“River.”  Green retains Mitchell’s sad instrumental take on “Jingle
Bells” at the start and his vocal soars on the words “teach my
feet to fly.” Rating: ****  Tracey Thorn  has a horn-led version of “River” on a rather
more somber seasonal release, “Tinsel and Lights.” It’s not a
barrel of laughs, though it sounds classy. Rating: ***.  The Killers have released their seventh Christmas single in
aid of the  Product Red  charity. The band put out an EP of the
previous ones last year. At this rate, it will soon have enough
for a whole album. The latest song, “I Feel It in My Bones,”
is catchier than some of the material on “Battle Born.”  It’s not especially Christmassy, with only a Santa “ho ho
ho” and a snatch of “Silent Night” tacked on the end.  Rating: ****  Seasonal songs are often best when musicians realize that
jolly sleigh bells aren’t absolutely obligatory. That’s good
reason to admire the Pogues and the re-released “Fairytale of
 New York .” As they say, “The boys of the NYPD choir were
singing ‘Galway Bay,’ and the bells were ringing out for
Christmas Day.” Rating: ****  Country stars Lady Antebellum have jumped on the festive
bandwagon (or should that be sledge). “On This Winter’s Night”
runs over much the same snowy ground. Rating: **  It seems Christmas comes earlier every year. Back in
August, Warner Brothers was advertising tree ornaments designed
by indie band the Flaming Lips, a little premature for the
festive season.  On Sept. 25, Andy Williams -- who had turned Christmas into
gold for decades -- died at the age of 84.  The same day, “Now That’s What I Call Today’s Christmas”
hit the shelves. My review copy arrived with a press release
saying it “brims with yuletide cheer” and “18 holiday
classics and originals by superstars” including Justin Bieber
and Coldplay.  I needed to get closer to holiday time to get in the mood
to play this. Lady Gaga’s live take on “White Christmas” with
dinner-jazz backing is amusing. Rating: ***  Also in September, a load more CDs turned up from Legacy
records, all called “The Classic Christmas Album.” On his,
Luther Vandross has a spirited duet with  Darlene Love  in “I
Listen to the Bells” (rating **).  The Elvis Presley title is boosted by THAT voice on “Blue
Christmas” (rating: ****). The  Kenny G ., John Denver and Barry Manilow releases are for fans only (rating * at best).  Kenny G. also shows up on “This Christmas” by  John Travolta 
and Olivia Newton-John, back together for the first time since
1978. This record’s only redeeming feature is that its proceeds
go to charity. Rating: *.  They compete with  Bob Dylan ’s similarly charity-inspired
“Christmas in the Heart” in the worst-of stakes. I gave
Dylan’s a stinking review when it first came out. With a few
years’ perspective I smile more at his gruff “Must Be Santa.”
Maybe it’s meant to be a joke. Rating: **.  For the best of holiday rock, try “Christmas With the Rat
Pack,” featuring  Frank Sinatra , Dean Martin and Sammy Davis Jr.
Rating: ****.  “ Phil Spector ’s Christmas Album” is outstanding. The
producer’s reputation is in tatters given his later conviction
for second-degree murder. He still produced some of the finest
pop music of his time.  He worked on the LP obsessively for months. His epic studio
sound perfectly suits “Winter Wonderland” and “ Santa Claus  Is
Coming to Town.”  It’s best heard as the last disc of the “Back to Mono”
set which combines all his hits: “Be My Baby,” “River Deep --
Mountain High,” “To Know Him Is to Love Him” and more. Now
that really does make a perfect Christmas present.  Rating: *****  The CDs are priced from $9.99 and download prices vary
across services.  (Mark Beech writes for Muse, the arts and leisure section
