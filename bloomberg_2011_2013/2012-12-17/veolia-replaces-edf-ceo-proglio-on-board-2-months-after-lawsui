Veolia Environnement SA (VIE)  will replace
Electricite de France SA Chief Executive Officer Henri Proglio
on its board of directors with Marion Guillou less than two
months after the companies became embroiled in a lawsuit.  The appointment of Guillou, French National Institute for
Agricultural Research president from 2004 to 2012 and chairman
of engineering school Ecole Polytechnique, will be submitted for
approval to shareholders in May, Veolia said in a statement.  Proglio, after spending most of his career at Veolia, quit
as a director of the biggest water utility in October following
his decision in 2009 to leave as CEO and take the post at EDF.
The power operator, with 4 percent of Veolia, is suing the water
company over ownership of their Dalkia energy-services unit.  Before taking the helm at EDF, Proglio told members of the
French Senate the utility and Veolia would work together beyond
Dalkia and may develop synergies in energy and foreign markets.  He stayed as Veolia chairman to December 2010, which was
criticized by lawmakers as a conflict of interest. The naming of
Guillou to the board by CEO Antoine Frerot follows the chiefâ€™s
success in a struggle over plans to cut debt and sell assets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
