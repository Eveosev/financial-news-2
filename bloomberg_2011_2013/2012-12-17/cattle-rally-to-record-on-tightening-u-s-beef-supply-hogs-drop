Cattle futures extended a rally to a
record amid signs of shrinking supplies of U.S. beef. Hogs fell.  Beef  production  will drop 5 percent to 24.68 billion pounds
(11.2 million metric tons) next year, the  U.S. Department of
Agriculture  projected on Dec. 11. Ranchers culled herds as the
worst drought since 1956 eroded crop yields, sending the price
of corn, the main ingredient in feed, to a record in August. The
U.S. herd as of July 1 was the smallest since at least 1973.  “There’s just optimism out there from the standpoint of
the reduced supply,” Chad Henderson, the president of Prime
Agricultural Consultants Inc. in Brookfield,  Wisconsin , said in
a telephone interview.  Cattle futures for February delivery climbed 0.7 percent to
settle at $1.335 at 1 p.m. on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange,
after reaching $1.337 a pound, the highest ever for the most-
active contract. Prices are up 9.9 percent this year.  Wholesale  beef  increased 0.9 percent last week, the biggest
gain since Nov. 23, USDA data show. Higher prices may start to
erode consumer demand as U.S. economic growth slows, Henderson
said.  Feeder-cattle futures for January settlement rose 0.8
percent to $1.5425 a pound on the CME.  Hog futures for February settlement dropped 0.8 percent to
close at 84.75 cents a pound in  Chicago . Prices are up 0.5
percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
