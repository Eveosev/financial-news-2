Swaps for  iron ore  jumped to a six-
month high on speculation fewer cargoes are being offered as
stockpiles declined at ports in China, the largest importer,
according to SSY Futures Ltd.  January contracts rose 1.9 percent to $131.50 a dry metric
ton, according to Mark Richardson, head of the derivatives unit
of London-based shipbroker Simpson, Spence & Young Ltd. Thatâ€™s
the highest since June for contracts to deliver the steelmaking
commodity one month ahead, he said.  Inventories at Chinese ports dropped 17 percent since the
end of October to 73.74 million tons, the least in more than two
years, according to Beijing Antaike Information Development Co.,
a state-backed research company. Traders are competing for
cargoes as fewer tenders are being offered, driving up prices,
Richardson said in an e-mail today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
