European  stocks  fell for a third day
on concern that U.S. lawmakers won’t agree on a budget before
year-end holidays. The yen weakened to the lowest since April
2011 after the  Liberal Democratic Party  returned to power on
calls for more monetary easing, and gold declined.  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index retreated 0.4 percent at 10:35
a.m. in  London . Standard & Poor’s 500 Index futures rose 0.1
percent. The yen weakened to a 20-month low against the dollar
and gold for immediate delivery dropped 0.3 percent. The yield
on Germany’s 10-year bond increased two basis points to 1.37
percent. The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot Index of 24 raw
materials fell 0.1 percent.  “Time is running out to avoid a temporary fall off the
U.S. fiscal cliff,” Kit Juckes, the head of foreign-exchange
research at Societe Generale SA in London, wrote in a report.  The  Congressional Budget Office  says the U.S. will probably
tumble back into a recession should lawmakers fail to reach an
accord on the more than $600 billion in automatic tax increases
and spending cuts scheduled to start Jan. 1. Three years after
surrendering half a century of control, Japan’s LDP reclaimed
power in a landslide election victory yesterday, calling for
more  government spending  and central bank stimulus.  Telecommunications companies posted the biggest decline of
the 19 industries in the  Stoxx 600. (SXXP)  Royal KPN NV tumbled 14
percent, its biggest plunge in 11 years. The phone operator
scrapped its  final dividend  for 2012 after winning a spectrum
auction in the Netherlands.  The Stoxx 600, Europe’s  benchmark gauge , advanced more than
13 percent this year, set for the first annual gain since 2010,
amid increased confidence that policy makers are gaining control
over the region’s debt crisis. The  S&P 500  and the MSCI Asia
Pacific Index have each risen about 12 percent in 2012.  To contact the reporters on this story:
