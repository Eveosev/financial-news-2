Steel reinforcement-bar advanced to
the highest level in almost five months after the ruling Chinese
Communist Party signaled it will boost urbanization to underpin
economic growth in the world’s largest user.  Rebar for delivery in May rose 0.7 percent to 3,812  yuan 
($611) a metric ton on the Shanghai Futures Exchange, the
highest price since July 19, and the gain pared this year’s loss
to 9.5 percent. The contract jumped 2.8 percent on Dec. 14, the
biggest one-day gain in three months, after data suggested
 China ’s manufacturing may expand at a faster pace.  China will seek higher-quality  growth  next year, with
urbanization a driver, the Xinhua News Agency said yesterday
after the central economic work conference in Beijing. It will
boost spending on so-called non-redundant infrastructure
projects that provide long-term benefits, it said.  “We are cautiously bullish on steel,” Wu Zhili, an
analyst at Shenhua Futures Co., said by phone from Shenzhen.
Increased prospects for more investment in railroads combined
with a recovery in the  property market  and low inventories will
likely push up futures, Wu said.  The  average spot price  of rebar rose 0.6 percent to 3,604
yuan a ton today, the highest since Nov. 28, according to the
Beijing Antaike Information Development Co.  Spot iron ore  jumped
2.3 percent to $129.30 a dry ton at Tianjin port on Dec. 14,
according to a gauge compiled by The Steel Index Ltd.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
