Rubber surged to a seven-month high
on expectations for further stimulus after Japan’s  Liberal
Democratic Party  reclaimed power and on optimism China will
increase imports after cutting duties.  The contract for delivery in May advanced 2.8 percent to
end at 284.2 yen a kilogram ($3,384 a metric ton), the highest
closing level since May 10, on the Tokyo Commodity Exchange.
Futures climbed 7.9 percent this year, rebounding from a 36
percent drop in 2011.  China, the world’s biggest user of rubber, will reduce
 import duties  next year, potentially boosting purchases and
curbing domestic prices. The Japanese yen fell to its weakest
level since April 2011 versus the dollar after Shinzo Abe’s
Liberal Democratic Party swept to power in Japanese elections
yesterday, giving him a mandate to act on pledges of expanded
fiscal and monetary stimulus.  “Weakening yen supported the gain today,” Ker Chung Yang,
an analyst at Phillip Futures Pte, said by phone from  Singapore .
China’s import tax reduction also gave a boost to rubber prices,
he added.  Taxes will be either 20 percent or 1,200 yuan ($193) a ton,
whichever is lower, for imports beginning Jan. 1, the  Finance
Ministry  said on its website today. The tariffs are the lower of
either 20 percent or 2,000  yuan  a ton for natural rubber and
either 20 percent or 1,600 yuan a ton for ribbed smoked sheets,
said a previous statement from the ministry.  “This is going to weigh down local prices as they are
currently higher than international markets and may help boost
imports,” said Chen Ruibi, an analyst at Shanghai CIFCO Futures
Co. Rubber for delivery in May rose 1 percent to close at 25,345
yuan ($4,065) a ton on the Shanghai Futures Exchange. Thai
rubber free-on-board gained 1.6 percent to 95.60 baht ($3.12) a
kilogram today, according to the Rubber Research Institute of
 Thailand .  To contact the reporters on this story:
