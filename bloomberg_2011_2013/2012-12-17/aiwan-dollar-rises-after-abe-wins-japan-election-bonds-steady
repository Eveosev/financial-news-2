Taiwan’s dollar traded near a 15-
month high on speculation Japan’s Shinzo Abe will press for more
monetary stimulus after reclaiming power in national elections,
boosting the outlook for inflows to the rest of Asia.  Abe’s Liberal  Democratic Party  captured 294 seats in the
480-member lower house of parliament yesterday, while Prime
Minister  Yoshihiko Noda ’s Democratic Party of Japan lost three-
fourths of its lawmakers, according to public broadcaster NHK’s
vote count. Global funds bought $1.7 billion more Taiwanese
stocks than they sold this month, taking net purchases this year
to $4.9 billion, exchange data show. Japanese policy makers meet
to set  interest rates  on Dec. 20.  The Taiwan dollar was little changed at NT$29.100 against
its U.S. counterpart, according to data from Taipei Forex Inc.
The currency touched NT$28.959 on Nov. 12, the strongest level
since September 2011. It has appreciated 4.1 percent this year,
poised for a fourth straight annual gain.  “We might see Japan expanding monetary easing as soon as
this week and Asian currencies will benefit,” said  Frances Cheung , a strategist at Credit Agricole CIB in  Hong Kong .
“Asian central banks will try to smooth volatility in their
currencies.”  Bonds Steady  Taiwan’s central bank has bought the greenback to counter
gains in the island’s currency on most days in the past eight
months, according to traders who asked not to be identified. The
monetary authority’s mandate is to keep relative exchange-rate
stability and to intervene in the event of abnormal moves,
Governor Perng Fai-Nan said on Dec. 12.  The monetary authority will meet on Dec. 19 to discuss

measure of expected moves in exchange rates used to price
options, slipped three basis points to 2.92 percent.  The yield on the government’s 1.125 percent bonds due
