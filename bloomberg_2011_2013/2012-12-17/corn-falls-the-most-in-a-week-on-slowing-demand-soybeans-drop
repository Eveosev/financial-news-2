Corn fell the most in a week on
slowing demand for supplies from the U.S., the world’s biggest
exporter. Soybeans declined for the first time in three
sessions.  As of Dec. 6,  corn sale s for delivery before Sept. 1 fell
46 percent to 12.488 million tons from a year earlier, the
lowest since the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  began reporting
the data in 1990, the USDA said. Output of grain-based ethanol,
a gasoline additive, tumbled 1.3 percent in the week ended Dec.
7 from a week earlier, and inventories rose to the highest since
June 29, U.S. Energy Department data show.  “Export demand is disappointing and ethanol production is
slowing,” Joseph Vaclavik, the president of Standard Grain Inc.
in  Chicago , said in a telephone interview. “Everyone is waiting
for lower prices before extending purchases.”  Corn futures for March delivery declined 0.9 percent to
close at $7.24 a bushel at 2 p.m. on the Chicago Board of Trade,
the biggest drop since Dec. 10. Still, the grain has gained 12
percent this year after drought cut U.S. production 13 percent
to a six-year low.  Soybean futures for March delivery fell 0.2 percent to
$14.8825 a bushel in Chicago, after gaining 1.4 percent the
prior two sessions on rising export demand. Most-active futures
have risen 23 percent this year after a drought in the U.S.
triggered concern supplies will fall short of growing demand
from  China .  Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, followed by soybeans, hay
and wheat.  To contact the reporter on this story:
