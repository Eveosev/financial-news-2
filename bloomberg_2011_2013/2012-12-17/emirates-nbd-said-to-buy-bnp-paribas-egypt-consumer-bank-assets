Emirates NBD PJSC (EMIRATES) , the United Arab
Emirates’ biggest bank by assets, is poised to buy  BNP Paribas
SA’s (BNP)  consumer banking business in Egypt, according to a person
with knowledge of the matter.  Emirates NBD, which is controlled by Dubai’s government,
may pay the French lender $400 million to $500 million for the
assets, said the person, who asked not to be identified because
the information is private.  A spokesman for Emirates NBD declined to comment, while a
spokesman for BNP Paribas couldn’t immediately be reached.
Reuters reported the story earlier today.  BNP Paribas is likely to become the second French bank to
sell assets in Egypt as the European nation’s banks boost
capital amid Europe’s debt crisis. On Dec. 12, Societe Generale
SA, France’s second-largest lender, agreed to sell its 77.2
percent stake in its Egyptian unit,  National Societe Generale
Bank SAE (NSGB) , to  Qatar National Bank SAQ (QNBK)  for $1.97 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
