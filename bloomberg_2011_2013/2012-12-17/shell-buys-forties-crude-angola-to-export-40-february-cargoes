Royal Dutch Shell Plc bought a cargo
of North Sea Forties crude at the highest premium in about six
weeks. Socar Trading SA sold two lots of Azeri Light blend.  Angola ,  Africa ’s second-largest oil producer, will export
40 consignments of crude in February, a partial loading program
obtained by Bloomberg News showed. The plan excludes Palanca,
Saturno and Plutonio grades.  North Sea  BP Plc sold Forties lot F1216 for loading Dec. 29 to Dec.
31 at 65 cents a barrel more than Dated Brent, according to a
survey of traders and brokers monitoring the Platts pricing
window. That’s 5 cents higher than when the same cargo traded on
Dec. 12 and matches a deal on Nov. 8.  Shell and Statoil ASA failed to buy the blend for loading
next month, the survey showed. Shell bid at a premium of 80
cents to Dated Brent for Jan. 8 to Jan. 10, while Statoil didn’t
find a seller at plus 65 cents for Jan. 8 to Jan. 11.  Reported crude trading typically occurs during the Platts
window, which ends at 4:30 p.m. London time. Before the session,
Forties loading in 10 to 25 days dropped 3 cents to 73 cents
more than Dated Brent, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Brent for February settlement traded at $108.07 a barrel on
the ICE Futures  Europe  exchange in London at the close of the
window, compared with $107.63 in the previous session. The March
contract was at $107.19, a discount of 88 cents to February.  A Forties cargo for export in December was postponed for a
third time, according to two people with knowledge of the
loading program. Consignment F1205 will now be shipped on Dec.
17 to Dec. 19 and will co-load with lot F1208, said the people,
declining to be identified because the information is
confidential.  Exports of Flotta crude will be one cargo of 650,000
barrels in January, unchanged from this month, a loading plan
obtained by Bloomberg News showed.  The shipment is set to load Jan. 16 to Jan. 18, according
to the plan. Talisman Energy Inc. operates the field.  Mediterranean/Urals  Total SA bought two shipments of 600,000 barrels each of
Azeri crude, the Platts survey showed. Socar sold the cargoes,
on a delivered basis to Augusta in  Italy  from Jan. 4 to Jan. 8,
at premiums of $3.20 and $3.25 to Dated Brent.  The Urals differential to Dated Brent in the Mediterranean
was unchanged at minus 26 cents, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. In northwest Europe, the  discount  to Dated Brent
widened 5 cents to $1, the data showed.  West Africa  Angola will export 1.37 million barrels a day in February,
according to the partial program. That’s down from 1.8 million
barrels, or 59 cargoes, in January, a final loading program for
that month showed. Each lot is for about 950,000 barrels.  Seven shipments of Plutonio, two consignments of Saturno
and one of Palanca are set to be exported next month, according
to the January program.  Qua Iboe blend fell 2 cents to at $2.63 a barrel more than
Dated Brent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s
close to an eight-month high at $2.72 on Dec. 10.  To contact the reporter on this story:
