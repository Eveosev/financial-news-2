Gasoline strengthened on the U.S.
 Gulf Coast  after a fire broke out today at Motiva Enterprises
LLC’s new 325,000-barrel-a-day crude unit in  Port Arthur ,  Texas .  The fire was the second in less than a week as the company
attempts to restart the unit after six months of repairs. The
pipestill is stable and Motiva is “still targeting early 2013
for restart as planned,” Kimberly Windon, a Houston-based
spokeswoman for the refinery, said in an e-mail. A small pipe
leak and fire forced the unit to shut Dec. 11.  The crude unit is the largest of three at Port Arthur and
was initially shut for repairs several days after operations
began in May. At full rates, the  refinery  can make 240,000
barrels a day of gasoline and 190,000 barrels of diesel,
according to the company.  Conventional gasoline  to be blended with ethanol, or CBOB,
on the Gulf Coast gained 2 cents to 33 cents a gallon below
futures on the  New York  Mercantile Exchange at 1:33 p.m.
Conventional,  87-octane gasoline  rose 2 cents to trade at a 31-
cent discount.  Motiva said June 19 that a caustic chemical may have caused
corrosion of equipment on the crude unit after it was shut down.
The Port Arthur refinery is the largest in the country,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
