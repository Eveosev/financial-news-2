Prime Minister  Mario Monti ’s Cabinet
passed a decree to simplify the procedures for parties running
for the first time in general elections.  Parties not already represented in the Rome-based
Parliament will have to collect fewer signatures than now
required to qualify, according to an e-mailed statement from the
prime minister’s office today. New parties will have to collect
half the number of signatures normally required, while those
with seats in parliament will have to collect 60 percent of the
normal levels.  Monti has said he will resign by the end of this week after
the approval of the budget law. That decision would allow
President Giorgio Napolitano to dissolve the Parliament ahead of
elections expected in February. The measure comes as Monti faces
pressure at home and abroad to run in the election or at least
to endorse a coalition of parties officially supporting his
policies.  The new rules make it easier for parties such as the 5 Star
Movement of comedian-turned-politician Beppe Grillo. The party
runs close to 20 percent in most opinion polls and has never
participated in national elections.  The Parliament will probably be dissolved over the holiday
period, complicating efforts by parties to collect the required
signatures. Today’s decree makes it easier for the parties to
meet the required thresholds.  The government also passed a measure to allow regional
elections in Lombardy, Lazio and Molise to be held the same day
as the national vote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
