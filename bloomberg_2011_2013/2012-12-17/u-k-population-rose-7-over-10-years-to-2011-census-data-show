Britain’s population rose almost 7
percent over a decade, data from the 2011 census show. It’s the
largest increase recorded over 10 years since 1961.  The number of people in the U.K. grew by 4.1 million to
63.2 million as of March 27 last year, the Office for National
Statistics in London said in its  first population estimate  from
the census, the latest in a 10-yearly series dating to 1801.  The increase reflects in part immigration from other
European countries, particularly  Poland , though there’s also
been a rise in the number of births. Census data released last
week by the ONS showed the proportion of people identifying
themselves as white British in  England  and  Wales  declined to
80.5 percent from 87.5 percent over the decade. In London, it
dropped to 45 percent.  Prime Minister David Cameron’s Conservative-led government
has been pressing ahead with moves to cut immigration, including
clamping down on the abuse of student visas by those seeking to
travel to Britain to work. Home Secretary Theresa May said last
week that with annual net migration still at 183,000, there was
still some way to go to achieve her goal of reducing that to
less than 100,000 by 2015.  May  argued in a speech on Dec. 12  that uncontrolled mass
immigration is pushing up house prices, putting downward
pressure on wages and making it harder to create a cohesive
society. The opposition Labour Party leader, Ed Miliband, spoke
two days later of the need for a “comprehensive strategy for
integration” to respond to voters’ concerns about immigration.  Today’s data showed the largest percentage increases in
population were seen in the east  London  boroughs of Tower
Hamlets -- up 26.4 percent -- and Newham, where there was a rise
of 23.5 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
