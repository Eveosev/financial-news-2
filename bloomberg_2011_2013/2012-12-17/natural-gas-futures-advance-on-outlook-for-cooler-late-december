Natural gas futures climbed in New
York for the first time in eight days as revised forecasts
showed below-normal temperatures that would spur heating demand.  Gas gained as much as 2.4 percent after Commodity Weather
Group LLC in Bethesda,  Maryland , predicted colder-than-usual
weather across most of the lower 48 states from Dec. 27 through
Dec. 31. Earlier outlooks forecast above-average temperatures on
the East Coast. Prices settled at an 11-week low of $3.314 per
million British thermal units on Dec. 14.  “The colder-than-normal temperatures are giving us a
little bit of a short-term bounce,” said Phil Flynn, senior
market analyst at the Price Futures Group in  Chicago . “The
market had been looking oversold after last week’s declines.”  Natural gas for January delivery rose .72 cents, or 2.2
percent, to $3.386 per million British thermal units at 11:53
a.m. on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The futures are up 13
percent this year, heading for the first annual gain since 2007.  February $3.75 calls were the most active gas options in
electronic trading. They were 0.7 cent higher at 6.2 cents on
volume of 444 contracts as of 11:35 a.m. Calls accounted for 63
percent of options volume.  Net-long bets on four U.S. natural gas contracts shrank by
18,460 futures equivalents, or 17 percent, to 92,119 in the week
ended Dec. 11, according to data released Dec. 14 by the
Commodity Futures Trading Commission.  The measure includes an index of four contracts adjusted to
futures equivalents: Nymex natural gas futures, Nymex Henry Hub
Swap Futures, Nymex ClearPort Henry Hub Penultimate Swaps and
the ICE Futures U.S. Henry Hub contract. Henry Hub, in Erath,
Louisiana, is the delivery point for Nymex futures, a benchmark
price for the fuel.  Weather Outlook  The low in St. Louis on Dec. 30 may be 22 degrees
Fahrenheit (minus 5 Celsius), 1 below the usual reading,
according to  AccuWeather Inc.  in State College,  Pennsylvania .
The low in  Cleveland  may be 21 degrees, 4 lower than normal.  About 50 percent of U.S. households use gas for heating,
Energy Department data show.  Gas inventories rose 2 billion cubic feet in the week ended
Dec. 7 to 3.806 trillion cubic feet, the Energy Department
reported Dec. 13. It was the latest seasonal supply gain since
the week ended Dec. 30, 2005, according to department data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Supplies were 8 percent above the five-year average,
compared with 4.6 percent the previous week. The gas inventory
 surplus  to the average has declined from a six-year high of 61
percent in March, department data show.  Total SA (TOT)  has agreed to purchase liquefied natural gas from
 Cheniere Energy Partners LP’s (CQP)  Sabine Pass facility in Louisiana
under a 20-year agreement.  Total Purchases  Total’s North American subsidiary will buy about 2 million
metric tons a year of the 4.5 million metric tons of capacity
from Train Five at the proposed export facility, Cheniere said
in a statement today. Deliveries from Train Five are expected to
begin as soon as 2018.  The U.S. raised its forecast for natural gas output in 2012
by 0.6 percent in a report Dec. 11 and boosted its outlook for
prices.  Marketed gas production will average 69.22 billion cubic
feet a day this year, up from 68.84 billion estimated in
November, the Energy Department said in its monthly  Short-Term
Energy Outlook . Output may rise 0.5 percent in 2013 to 69.59
billion a day, department estimates show.  Henry Hub  Gas prices at the benchmark Henry Hub in Erath,  Louisiana ,
will average $2.78 per million British thermal units, compared
with the previous estimate of $2.77, according to the report
from the department’s Energy Information Administration.  The boom in oil and natural gas production helped the U.S.
cut its reliance on imported fuel. America met 83 percent of its
energy needs in the first eight months of the year, department
data show. If the trend goes on through 2012, it will be the
highest level of self-sufficiency since 1991.  The number of rigs drilling for gas in the U.S. slipped by
one to 416 last week, according to data from  Baker Hughes Inc. (BHI) 
in Houston. The rig count is down 49 percent this year.  -- With assistance from Asjylyn Loder and Tina Davis in New
