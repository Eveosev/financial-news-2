A majority of Americans support
stricter gun-control measures, including a ban on high-capacity
ammunition clips, according to a poll released today following
the murder of 26 people, including 20 children, in Newtown,
 Connecticut .  The  ABC News/Washington Post survey  showed 54 percent of
respondents backing new limits on gun rights, with 43 percent
opposed. When asked about banning ammunition clips that contain
more than 10 bullets, 59 percent supported the idea, while 38
percent opposed it. In addition, 52 percent backed a ban on
semiautomatic handguns, with 44 percent in opposition.  A  Pew Research Center poll  also released today showed 47
percent of respondents said the killing rampage reflected
problems in U.S. society, while 44 percent said it was an
isolated act by one person. Asked about the July shootings in a
Colorado movie theater that killed 12 people, 67 percent viewed
it as an isolated act and 24 percent said it was a societal
problem.  The suspect in the Dec. 14 Connecticut killings, Adam
Lanza, brought handguns and an assault rifle to Sandy Hook
Elementary School before embarking on the second-deadliest U.S.
school shooting. He killed himself at the scene, police said. In
2007, 33 people including shooter Seung-Hui Cho died at Virginia
Polytechnic Institute and State University, popularly known as
Virginia Tech, in Blacksburg.  In the July 20 shootings in Aurora,  Colorado , James Holmes
is facing charges of first-degree murder.  Assault Weapons Ban  Majorities have consistently supported gun-control measures
going back to 1993, when 60 percent were in favor of stronger
laws, according to surveys. Congress banned certain assault
weapons in 1994, though 10 years later then-President George W. Bush and the Republican-controlled Congress didnâ€™t renew the
prohibition when it expired.  Senator Dianne Feinstein, a California Democrat, said she
would introduce legislation next month to reinstate the assault-
weapons ban.  Forty-nine percent of respondents in the ABC/Post poll said
the best way to reduce gun violence was by enforcing existing
laws, compared with 32 percent who called for new legislation.
In January 2011, 57 percent called for enforcing existing
measures while 29 percent said new laws were needed.  The survey of 602 adults was conducted Dec. 14-16 and had a
margin of error of plus or minus 4.5 percentage points.  The Pew poll of 746 adults was taken Dec. 14-16 and had an
error margin of plus or minus 4.3 percentage points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
