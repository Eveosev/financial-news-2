Venezuelan bonds fell the most in
two months after opposition parties relinquished five
gubernatorial posts yesterday, triggering speculation they may
not have enough support to defeat President Hugo Chavez’s
successor should an emergency vote be called.  Yields on  Venezuela ’s dollar-denominated bonds due 2027
rose 19 basis points, or 0.19 percentage point, to 9.31 percent
at 10:35 a.m. in Caracas, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The price sank 1.5 cent to 99.51 cents on the dollar
after surging more than 10 cents in the prior three weeks.  Opposition candidates took just three of 23 gubernatorial
posts in the nationwide elections, down from the eight they had
controlled. Venezuelan bonds had been rallying in part on
speculation that the opposition had enough backing to win an
emergency presidential election should cancer force Chavez, a
self-declared socialist who has nationalized more than 1,000
companies, to step down from office.  “This seems to suggest that the chances that the
opposition could win an eventual presidential election are
declining,” Alejandro Arreaza, a Barclays Plc economist, said
in a telephone interview from New York.  Miranda Governor Henrique Capriles Radonski, the opposition
candidate who Chavez defeated in October presidential elections,
won re-election yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
