VimpelCom Ltd. (VIP)  rose to the highest
level in eight weeks in New York after  Russia ’s third-biggest
mobile provider said it would resume dividend payments.  Shares of VimpelCom jumped 3.5 percent to $11.39 on the New
York Stock Exchange, the highest closing price since Oct. 12,
data compiled by Bloomberg show. Today’s advance, which drove
gains in the  Bloomberg Russia-US Equity Index (RUS14BN)  of Russian
companies traded in the U.S., extended VimpelCom’s surge in 2012
to 20 percent.  VimpelCom will pay a dividend of 80 cents per American
depositary share, including 35 cents per ADS related to 2011
results, according to a PR Newswire statement issued today. The
company, whose total dividend payout will reach $1.3 billion, is
free to pay returns to investors after Russia agreed to withdraw
legal claims against shareholder  Telenor ASA (TEL)  over the Norwegian
phone company boosting its stake.  “VimpelCom finally pleased minorities after missing
interim dividends in May because of the corporate conflict,”
Alexander Kazbegi, an analyst at Moscow-based Renaissance
Capital who rates VimpelCom buy, said by phone. “The size of
dividends is no surprise though,” he said, as the 80 cents was
already “agreed in its dividend policy.”  Amsterdam-based VimpelCom, which canceled a 28-cent payment
due May 30, had a gross dividend yield over the past 12 months
of 3.98 percent, compared with 4.9 percent for  OAO Mobile
TeleSystems (MBT) , Russia’s biggest mobile phone company, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
