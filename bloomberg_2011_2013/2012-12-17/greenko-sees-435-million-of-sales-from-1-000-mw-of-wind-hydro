Greenko Group Plc (GKO) , an Indian clean-
energy developer, sees annual sales of 330 million euros ($435
million) by building and buying 1,000 megawatts of renewable-
power facilities including wind and hydropower by 2015.  Greenko will take control of about 540 megawatts of  wind
energy  and 450 megawatts of hydropower, as well as biomass and
gas operations,  Mark Thompson , director of corporate affairs at
the Hyderabad-based company, said in a phone interview. About an
equal split between hydropower and wind would probably bring in
about 330 million euros of revenue, Thompson said.  Wind and water power are among the cheapest power sources
in India, with “huge” demand and a lack of capacity, he said.  The average monthly energy shortfall in India was almost 9
percent at the end of last quarter, compared with 5.5 percent a
year earlier, Bloomberg New Energy Finance estimates.  Greenko is building about 190 megawatts of hydropower and
350 megawatts of wind farms and has enough money to reach 1,000
megawatts of capacity by 2015, Thompson said. It received $70
million for projects from Standard Chartered Plc a year ago.  The company will get about a third of its hydropower from
acquisitions, Thompson said. “ India  is seeing quite a few firms
that own hydro projects that are non-core to their activities
and because raising capital in the country is challenging at the
moment, these companies are selling their hydro,” he said.  “It’s opportunistic on our part and there are quite a few
potential targets in the pipeline that we could acquire if we
can get them at the right price,” Thompson said, adding Greenko
can earn a cash return three years earlier by buying hydropower.  About 57 percent of India’s capacity was from coal at the
end of September, 18.8 percent from large hydropower and 8.7
percent from wind, according to data compiled by BNEF.  To contact the reporter on this story:
