Latvia is very close to meeting
requirements for adopting the euro in 2014 and becoming the
currency union’s 18th member, Violeta Klyviene, a senior analyst
at Danske Bank A/S, said in an e-mailed note today.  The Baltic country’s inflation, debt and  budget deficit 
already meet membership criteria, leaving only requirements on
long-term interest rates that are “more a formality than a real
obstacle,” Vilnius-based Klyviene said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
