DCNS SA plans to buy OpenHydro Group
Ltd., an Irish tidal-turbine maker working with Electricite de
 France  SA, to get a foothold in the marine  energy industry .  The deal will be completed in the first half, Virginie
Lemiere, a spokeswoman at the Paris-based marine engineering
company, said today by e-mail, declining to give a value for the
deal or size of the stake. DCNS now owns about 11 percent.  The purchase is part of a strategy to double revenue from
2010 to 2020, Lemiere said. OpenHydro is working with EDF to
install turbines off the coast of France.  To contact the reporter on this story:
