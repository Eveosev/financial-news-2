Philippine stocks  fell the most in
five months on speculation  Philippine National (PNB)  Bank won’t merge
with a rival and on the prospect  San Miguel (SMB)  Brewery Inc. will be
delisted for failing to meet the minimum public float.  SM Investments Corp. (SM) , owned by billionaire  Henry Sy , slid
the most in three months and Philippine National, known as PNB,
sank 5.1 percent after SM denied a report the group is in talks
to invest in PNB.  Bank of the Philippine Islands  lost 2.8
percent after the exclusivity period for merger talks with PNB
lapsed. San Miguel posted its sharpest loss in six months.  The benchmark  Philippine Stock Exchange index  slid for a
fourth day, losing 1.5 percent to 5,623.85, the most since July
9, at the close in Manila. Shares in the measure, which hit an
all-time closing high of 5,831.50 on Dec. 11, are trading at 18
times estimated earnings, compared with 15.3 at the end of 2011.  SM sank 3.3 percent to 816 pesos, the steepest retreat
since Aug. 24, while its venture BDO Unibank Inc. declined 2.7
percent to 70.90 pesos, the sharpest loss since Oct. 19.  The SM Group, including its bank, are not in talks for an
investment in PNB, Chief Financial Officer Jose Sio said in a
phone interview today. The group, which include SM Investments,
is making a bid for a PNB stake and in talks for a possible
merger with BDO, the Manila Bulletin reported today, citing Sio.  “The statement poured ice cold water on market speculation
that the SM Group is acquiring PNB,” Astro del Castillo,
managing director  at First Grade Finance Inc., said.  PNB sank 5.1 percent to 88 pesos, the sharpest drop since
Sept. 2011, while  Bank of the Philippine Islands  lost 2.8
percent to 91.95 pesos. PNB has not received any official
communication after the exclusivity period ended Dec. 15, it
said in a disclosure to the stock exchange today.  Brewer Drops  San Miguel  declined 2.9 percent to 33 pesos, the sharpest
loss in six months.  San Miguel Corp. (SMC) , parent of the brewer, sank
4.6 percent to 101 pesos, the lowest close since November 2010.
The brewer said the bourse rejected a request to extend a Dec.
31 deadline to meet a minimum 10 percent public float. The
exchange said stocks that don’t meet deadline will be suspended
from trading starting Jan. 1 and will be de-listed if they don’t
meet the minimum float by June 30.  “There’s strong anticipation that a trading suspension and
eventual de-listing of San Miguel Brewery will translate to
lower valuation for the venture,” Alex Pomento, head of
research at Macquarie Group Ltd.’s  Manila  unit, said by phone.  To contact the reporters on this story:
