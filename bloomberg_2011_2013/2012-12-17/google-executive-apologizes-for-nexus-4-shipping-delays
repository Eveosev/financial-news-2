Google Inc. (GOOG) ’s Dan Cobley, managing
director for the U.K. and Ireland, apologized for delays in
shipping the Nexus 4 Android handset, saying there were supply
shortfalls with device maker  LG Electronics Inc. (066570)   The company is working “nights and weekends” to
compensate, according to a posting by Cobley on his Google+
account. The company began selling Nexus 4 smartphones, which
showcase the latest features in Google’s Android smartphone
software, earlier this year on its  Google Play store .  “Supplies from the manufacturer are scarce and erratic,”
Cobley wrote in one of  his comments . “I can offer an unreserved
apology for our services and communication failures in the
process.”  Google, owner of the world’s largest search engine, has
expanded into mobile software and hardware to lessen its
dependence on traditional online advertising. Android, which is
offered for free to device makers,  holds  75 percent of the
global smartphone market, according to researcher IDC.  Kim Regillio, a spokeswoman for Seoul-based LG, didn’t
immediately return a phone message seeking comment.  “We’ve had overwhelming demand for our new Nexus devices
and are working around the clock to resolve issues with order
fulfillment,”  Mountain View , California-based Google said in an
e-mailed statement. “We are working closely with our partners
to get products shipped and into consumers’ hands as quickly as
possible.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
