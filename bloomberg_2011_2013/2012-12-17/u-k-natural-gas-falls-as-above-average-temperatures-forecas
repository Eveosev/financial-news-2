U.K. natural gas for same-day
delivery declined for a third day as warmer-than-average weather
was predicted through the end of the year, cutting demand for
the heating fuel.  Within-day gas  slid as much as 1.6 percent, according to
broker data compiled by Bloomberg. The low temperature in  London 
was 5 degrees Celsius (41 Fahrenheit), compared with a 10-year
average of minus 1 degree, CustomWeather Inc. data on Bloomberg
show. It will stay above 1 degree through Dec. 31, according to
the data.  Gas for today fell 0.95 pence, or 1.4 percent, to 65.7
pence a therm at 4 p.m. London time.  Month-ahead gas  dropped 0.5
percent to 66.85 pence a therm. Thatâ€™s equivalent to $10.83 per
million British thermal units and compares with $3.33 per
million Btu of front-month U.S. gas.  Demand in the 24 hours to 6 a.m. tomorrow will be 298
million cubic meters versus a seasonal normal of 296 million,
 National Grid Plc (NG/)  data show. The delivery network was balanced,
with the  system  predicted to contain 349 million cubic meters of
gas at the end of the period versus 345 million at the
beginning, grid data show.  Gas accounted for 35 percent of U.K. power production at
3:45 p.m., grid data show. Coal generated 43 percent, nuclear 15
percent and wind 1.7 percent.  Electricity for the next working day jumped 3.6 percent to
50.75 pounds a megawatt-hour, broker data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
