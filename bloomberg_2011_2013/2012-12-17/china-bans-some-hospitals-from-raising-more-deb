China  ordered county-level public
hospitals to stop borrowing money after an audit showed some of
them took on too much debt when upgrading facilities, according
to a document seen by Bloomberg News.  The  National Development and Reform Commission , the finance
and health ministries and the China Banking Regulatory
Commission, requested banks stop issuing new loans and reduce
lines of credit to county hospitals nationwide, according to the
Oct. 31 emergency notice that was distributed this month and
seen by Bloomberg.  The contents of the document were confirmed by three people
with knowledge of the matter, who asked not to be identified
because the order has not been made public.  County hospitals in Xinjiang in northwestern China were
ordered not to raise new debt, according to a  statement  posted
on website of the autonomous region’s Development and Reform
Commission, dated Dec. 10. An employee at the NDRC’s information
office said such a notice hasn’t been made public and declined
further comment. Employees at the Health and Finance Ministry’s
press offices declined to comment. Calls to the CBRC’s press
office weren’t picked up.  China’s central government spent 450.6 billion  yuan  ($72.3
billion) in 2009-2011 on improving medical services, which
included building and upgrading county hospitals. It is also
ordering hospitals to stop marking up the price of drugs, sales
of which contribute 50 percent of hospitals’ revenues, in a bid
to reduce health-care costs for patients.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
