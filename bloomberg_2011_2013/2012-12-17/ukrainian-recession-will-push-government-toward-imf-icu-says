Ukraine’s government will be pushed
to agree on International Monetary Fund aid because of its weak
economy, according to Investment Capital Ukraine.  After shrinking 1.3 percent from a year earlier in the
third quarter, the  economy  is probably in a “double-dip
recession,” ICU said today in an e-mailed report. Even after
contracting in some quarters, gross domestic product will
advance 0.2 percent this year, before growing 1.7 percent in
2013, it predicted.  “It’s very likely this recession will spill over well into
next year,” ICU said today from the capital, Kiev. “These
conditions are pushing Ukraine toward striking an agreement with
the IMF very early next year to resume receiving funding under
the condition of carrying out economic reforms.”  The former Soviet state is seeking to renew lending from
the IMF after disbursements from a 2010 program were frozen last
March because the government refused to cut household heating
subsidies. An IMF mission was supposed to arrive to Kiev in the
second half of January for talks.  The hryvnia, which has lost 0.8 percent against the dollar
this year, may decline to 9 by end-2013 as the IMF demands a
more flexible exchange-rate regime, according to ICU, which
forecasts the current-account deficit will narrow to $10.9
billion next year from $14.7 billion in 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
