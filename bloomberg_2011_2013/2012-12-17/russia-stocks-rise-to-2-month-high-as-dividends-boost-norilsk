Russian equities gained as crude oil
rose and OAO GMK Norilsk Nickel rallied after the miner
announced its dividend policy.  The Micex Index added 0.2 percent to 1,469.53 by the close
in Moscow, the highest since Oct. 22, with 13 stocks rising and
17 falling. The gauge fell as much as 0.5 percent earlier and
advanced 1.7 percent last week. OAO  Mechel (MTLR) , the nation’s biggest
coking-coal producer, surged as much as 3.7 percent.  Oil, Russia’s chief export earner, gained 0.6 percent to
$87.21 a barrel in  New York . Norilsk jumped after Chief
Executive Officer  Vladimir Potanin  told reporters the company
will pay 50 percent of annual earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization as dividends twice a year.  “Norilsk surged on the dividend news,”  Mikhail Stiskin ,
an analyst at Sberbank CIB, said by phone from Moscow. “This is
a very high amount.”  Potanin, 51, replaced Vladimir Strzhalkovsky, a statement
from the company handed to reporters in Moscow today shows.
Potanin selected Strzhalkovsky, 58, to run the company in 2008
as conflict with United Co. Rusal over the management of Norilsk
began.  Norilsk jumped 3.7 percent to 5,573 rubles, the highest
level since March 19. The volume of shares traded was twice the
three-month average, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Deripaska, Abramovich  Rusal, controlled by billionaire Oleg Deripaska, and
Potanin are settling a more than four-year battle over control
of Moscow-based Norilsk by balancing their representatives on
the board. As part of the accord,  Roman Abramovich , the
billionaire Chelsea Football Club owner, will control  voting
rights  on a 20 percent stake to help quash shareholder disputes,
the parties said in a statement last week.  Utilities lost 0.7 percent on average today after Deputy
Prime Minister  Arkady Dvorkovich  signaled state asset sales in
the industry may be smaller than investors anticipated.
Dvorkovich told analysts on Dec. 14 that state asset-sale plans
in the next two years are limited to selling stakes in one or
two of OAO MRSK Holding’s regional units, according to  Alfa Bank 
and Aton Capital LLC.  “Investors were expecting the start of a big privatization
program, but instead we’re seeing the regulator increasingly
tightening its grip,” Alexei Yazikov, an analyst at Aton
Capital, said by phone. “In the long and the short term, the
power shares aren’t interesting for investors.”  OAO Mosenergo retreated 1.4 percent, while OAO RusHydro
lost 1.2 percent. Federal Grid Co. dropped 0.9 percent. MSCI
Inc.’s  Russia Utilities (MXRU0UT)  Index declined 1.6 percent to 37.52, the
most since Nov. 26.  RusHydro Shares  The amount of shares traded on the Micex was 23 percent
below the 30-day average, according to Bloomberg data.  RusHydro fell to 73.76 kopeks. The board on Dec. 10
approved the sale of 110 billion shares at 1 ruble each, which
will start on Dec. 19, according to a company statement.
President  Vladimir Putin  last month signed a decree transferring
50 billion rubles from the budget to RusHydro in exchange for
additional shares.  Former President  Dmitry Medvedev  pledged in June last year
to relinquish government control of some of the biggest state
companies, including MRSK’s subsidiaries and RusHydro, the
country’s largest hydropower producer, saying it was time to
reverse the policy of strengthening the state’s presence.  Standard & Poor’s GSCI Index of commodities rose 0.2
percent to 638.23. The  RTS Index (RTSI$)  dropped 0.6 percent to
1,491.21. The Russian Depositary Index retreated 0.1 percent.  Mechel gained 2.4 percent to 209.40 rubles, as a
preliminary purchasing managers’ index showed manufacturing in
 China  expanded at a faster pace this month.  Gas Demand  Russia ’s industrial-production rose 1.9 percent from a year
earlier, compared with 1.8 percent in October, the Federal
Statistics Service said today in an e-mailed statement.  American depositary receipts  of OAO Gazprom, Russia’s
biggest company, added 0.3 percent on Dec. 14, as the stock’s
100-day volatility dropped to 28.38, the lowest reading since
Jan. 31, 2011. Gazprom lost less than 0.1 percent to 139.13
rubles in Moscow today.  Gazprom supplies about 25 percent of  Europe ’s gas and is
benefiting from soaring demand for heating in the region as a
wave of cold Siberian air and above-normal snowfall send
temperatures plummeting. The company, whose ADRs have slumped 16
percent in 2012, has seen an “unprecedented” surge in supplies
to Europe, with exports reaching an all-time high of 550.1
million cubic meters a day on Dec. 13, Chief Executive Officer
Alexey Miller said in an e-mailed statement at the end of last
week.  Lowest Valuations  The  Bloomberg Russia-US Equity Index (RUS14BN)  added 0.1 percent to
97.20 in New York on Dec. 14. The  Market Vectors Russia ETF (RSX) , the
largest dedicated Russian exchange-traded fund, rose 0.7 percent
to $29.29.  The Micex trades at about 5.6 times  estimated earnings 
after adding 4.8 percent this year. That compares with a
multiple of 10.6 times for the MSCI  Emerging Markets  Index,
which has gained 13.4 percent.  Russian equities have the lowest valuations based on
estimated earnings among 21 emerging markets tracked by
Bloomberg. Russia receives about half of its budget revenue from
oil and natural gas industry sales.  To contact the reporter on this story:
