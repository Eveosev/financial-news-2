South Africa ’s corn exports in the
year through April 2013 are forecast to drop to 1.6 million
metric tons from 2.5 million tons in 2011-12 because of lower
beginning stocks, the UN’s Food & Agriculture Organization said.  Corn planting for 2013 may show a “marginal” increase as
farmers react to higher corn prices and due to crop rotation,
the Rome-based United Nations agency wrote in a  country report 
on its website dated Dec. 13.  To contact the reporter on this story:
