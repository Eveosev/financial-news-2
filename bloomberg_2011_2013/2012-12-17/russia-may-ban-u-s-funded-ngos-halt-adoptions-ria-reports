Russian lawmakers proposed closing
political non-government organizations that receive U.S. funding
and halting adoptions of Russian children by American citizens
as part of retaliation against a U.S. human-rights bill that
targets Russian officials, RIA Novosti reported.  The steps, which would add to planned travel and investment
bans on Americans who commit crimes against Russian citizens or
violate their human rights, are scheduled for discussion in
Parliament this week, the state news service said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
