Banco Santander SA (SAN) , Spain’s biggest
lender, will offer 263 million euros ($345 million) in stock to
buy out minority investors in its  Banco Espanol de Credito SA 
retail unit and close 700 local branches to cut costs.  Santander, which already owns almost 90 percent of Banesto,
will offer investors the equivalent of 3.73 euros a share, 25
percent above its Dec. 14 closing price, the Santander, Spain-
based lender said in a filing to regulators today. The
transaction will shutter 700 branches as Santander limits its
combined Spanish network to 4,000, it said.  Spanish banks are striving to rein in costs as the state
forces them to book losses linked to real estate and  lending 
contracts. Santander said its absorption of the  Banesto (BTO)  network
will yield 520 million of annual savings by the third year of
the plan, with the Spanish banking industry seen shrinking to
35,000 branches by the end of 2015, a 35 percent drop from 2008.  “The rationale for doing this is clear,” Carlos Joaquim Peixoto, an analyst at  Banco BPI SA (BPI)  in Porto,  Portugal  who
recommends buying the shares, said in a phone interview.
“There’s no real scope for top-line growth in revenues in
Spain, so you have to focus on reducing your operations.”  Stock Jumps  Banesto jumped as much as 23 percent and closed up 18
percent at 3.54 euros in Madrid. Santander fell 1.2 percent to
5.83 euros. The offer is valued at 0.633 Santander share per
Banesto share, Santander said.  Santander has a flat costs structure in Spain “but that is
not enough,” the bank said in a presentation for analysts,
adding it had to focus on becoming more efficient. Profit at
Santander’s Spanish business fell 5.9 percent in the first nine
months of the year from the same period of 2011 to 1.05 billion
euros as profit from Banesto plunged 39 percent.  The branch closures won’t involve “traumatic” job cuts,
with reductions in staff being covered by natural turnover and
relocation of workers where possible, Santander Chief Financial
Officer Jose Antonio Alvarez said on a conference call. The
Banesto brand will disappear, he said.  “This transaction is part of the restructuring of the
Spanish financial system, which involves a significant reduction
in the number of competitors and the creation of larger
financial institutions,” Santander said. Banif, Banesto’s
private banking arm, will also operate under the Santander
brand, the lender said.  Financial Collapse  Banesto, a 110-year-old consumer bank, had 1,698 branches
and 8,303 staff at the end of September, according to its third-
quarter earnings report. It had 100 billion euros of assets, 67
billion euros of loans and 50 billion euros of deposits.
Santander bought Banesto in 1994 after Spain’s deposit-guarantee
fund put it up for sale following a financial collapse.  Alfredo Saenz, named as chairman of Banesto when it was
under state administration, stayed in the role after it was
acquired by Santander and remained until 2002, when he became
chief executive officer of Santander. Ana Patricia Botin,
daughter of Santander Chairman Emilio Botin, was chairman of
Banesto from 2002 to 2010, when she took over from Antonio Horta-Osorio as head of Santander’s U.K. unit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
