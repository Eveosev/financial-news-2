Foreigners bought a net C$13.3
billion ($13.4 billion) of Canadian securities in October, led
by purchases of bonds, the federal statistics agency said.  Purchases fell from a revised C$14.1 billion in September,
 Statistics Canada  said today in Ottawa. It was the fourth
straight month of net investment, the agency said.  Non-residents bought C$8.15 billion of  government bonds  and
C$8.93 of private corporate debt -- the largest investment in
more than 10 years -- while divesting of C$2.97 billion of
money-market paper, the report said. Foreigners purchased a net
C$745 million of the country’s stocks, led by shares of oil and
gas companies.  For the year to date, net securities purchases of C$76.2
billion exceeded last year’s comparable total of C$74.2 billion,
Statistics Canada said. Bond purchases of C$67.9 billion were
almost double the previous year’s total.  Canadians  bought  a net C$3.19 billion of foreign securities
in October, led by acquisitions of bonds, following a purchase
of C$6.03 billion in September.  To contact the reporter on this story:
