Nigeria,  Africa ’s top oil producer,
said it’s evaluating the costs for  Exxon Mobil Corp. (CVX) ’s Erha
North Phase 2 and  Total SA (FP) ’s Egina deepwater projects in order
to “maximize” the government’s profits from the new projects.  The management of the state-owned Nigerian National
Petroleum Corp. “is critically reviewing the overall economics
of the projects in view of their high cost estimates in order to
establish their validity, maximize Federal Government’s take and
ensure comparative price competitiveness,” Fidel Pepple, an
Abuja-based company spokesman, said today in an e-mailed
statement.  Exxon Mobil’s Erha North project is planned to beginning
production in 2015 with 50,000 barrels a day of crude output
while Total’s Egina has a planned output of between 150,000
barrels and 200,000 barrels daily and will also start in 2015,
according to information obtained from field operators and the
U.S. Energy Information Administration.  Exxon Mobil, the second-largest producer in  Nigeria , is the
operator of a joint venture in which it holds a 40 percent
stake, with state-owned NNPC holding the rest. Total also runs a
similar joint venture in which it holds 40 percent equity and
the state oil company holds the rest.  To contact the reporter on this story:
