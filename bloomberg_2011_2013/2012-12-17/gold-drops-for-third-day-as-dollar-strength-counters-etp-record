Gold futures advanced for a second
session after a report showed manufacturing in the  New York  area
contracted more than expected, bolstering prospects for expanded
U.S. monetary stimulus from the  Federal Reserve .  The Fed Bank of New York’s general economic index dropped
to minus 8.1, wider than the minus 1 median forecast in a
Bloomberg survey of economists. The central bank pledged last
week to buy $45 billion a month of  Treasury securities  starting
in January, expanding its asset-purchase program, and linked the
outlook for its main interest rate to unemployment and
inflation.  “We’re seeing a knee-jerk reaction to the factory data,”
Matt Zeman, a strategist at Kingsview Financial in Chicago, said
in a telephone interview. “The thinking is that this lays the
groundwork for even more Fed action.”  Gold futures for February delivery gained 0.1 percent to
settle at $1,698.20 an ounce at 1:42 p.m. on the Comex in New
York. Prices are up 8.4 percent this year.  Silver futures for March delivery slipped 0.1 percent to
$32.28 an ounce on the Comex. Earlier, the metal touched $32.08,
the lowest since Nov. 16.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , platinum futures for
January delivery lost 0.4 percent to $1,608.50 an ounce.  Palladium futures for March delivery decreased 0.5 percent
to $698.30 an ounce.  To contact the reporter on this story:
