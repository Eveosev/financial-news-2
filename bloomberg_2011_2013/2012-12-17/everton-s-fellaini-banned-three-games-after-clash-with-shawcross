Everton midfielder Marouane Fellaini
has been banned for three games after admitting a charge of
violent conduct in the Premier League match at Stoke two days
ago, his club said.  Television footage showed Fellaini appearing to headbutt
Stoke’s Ryan Shawcross in an incident not seen by match
officials. The game ended in a 1-1 draw.  Fellaini will miss games against West Ham, Wigan and
Chelsea under the punishment ordered by the Football
Association.  Fellaini had already issued an apology for his conduct
shortly after the match.  “There was a lot of pushing and pulling going on inside
the Stoke penalty area and I didn’t feel I was getting any
protection from the officials,” he said. “Nevertheless I know
I shouldn’t have done what I did.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
