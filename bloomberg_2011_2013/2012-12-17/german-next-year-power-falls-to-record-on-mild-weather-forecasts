German power for 2013 fell to a
record as contracts for the next three months declined on
forecasts for milder weather.  German power for next year lost as much as 0.7 percent,
according to broker data compiled by Bloomberg. Low temperatures
in  Frankfurt  will be above the 10-year average for the rest of
the year, according to CustomWeather Inc. data on Bloomberg.  The year-ahead contract, a European benchmark, fell 0.4
percent to 45.33 euros ($59.66) a megawatt-hour at 4:58 p.m.
Berlin time. Power for January dropped for an eighth day, its
longest losing streak since September 2011, and was down 1.2
percent at 47.70 euros.  “Traders aren’t afraid that this winter is going to be a
cold one, which puts pressure on power prices at the short end
of the curve,” Danny Graefe, a power trader at AVU Energie AG,
said today by phone from Gevelsberg,  Germany . He buys and sells
energy for local utilities in the Rhine-Rhur area.  The temperature in Frankfurt will rise as high as 8 degrees
Celsius (46 Fahrenheit) on Dec. 25. Wind speeds will increase to
28 kilometers (17 miles) per hour on Dec. 26, up from 15 kph
today.  German day-ahead power rose to 55.24 euros a megawatt-hour
in an auction on the European Energy Exchange, compared with
53.28 euros for delivery today.  “Wind will pick up in the next week though and combined
with low demand and above-average temperatures during the
Christmas holidays we may see negative day-ahead power prices
then,” Thomas Randel, a power trader at Karlsruhe-based utility
 EnBW Energie Baden-Wuerttemberg AG (EBK) , said by phone.  Carbon permits for December declined 1.4 percent to 6.48 a
metric ton on the ICE Futures Europe exchange. Lower carbon
costs will damp power prices further and the 2013 contract may
lose another 50 cents, Randel said.  German utility  RWE AG (RWE)  started block C of its 1,288-megawatt
nuclear power plant Gundremmingen at about 5:40 p.m. German
time, according to power plant data on Bloomberg. The plant was
halted Dec. 10 for technical reasons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
