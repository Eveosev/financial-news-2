South Korea ’s won rose toward a 15-
month high and  government bonds  fell on speculation Japan will
step up monetary easing after Japan’s  Liberal Democratic Party 
reclaimed power in yesterday’s elections.  The yen fell to its weakest level since April 2011 versus
the dollar, while the won appreciated against the yen for a
ninth day. Shinzo Abe’s LDP is proposing a “large scale”
supplementary budget to stimulate the economy, according to
election pledges posted on its website. South Korea’s central
bank Governor Kim Choong Soo said last week that “appropriate”
action on won volatility will be taken if needed.  “Investors are doing cross trades of selling the yen and
buying the won, and expectations for further monetary easing by
 Japan  are also supporting the won on inflows optimism,” said
Byeon Ji Young, a Seoul-based currency analyst for Woori Futures
Co. “Still, won appreciation is being limited near the 1,072
per dollar level on government intervention concerns.”  The won appreciated 0.2 percent to 1,073 per dollar as of
9:33 a.m. in Seoul, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
currency touched 1,071.08 on Dec. 13, the strongest level since
Sept. 8, 2011. One-month implied volatility, a measure of
expected moves in exchange rates used to price options, slid 10
basis points, or 0.10 percentage point, to 4.75 percent.  The yield on South Korea’s 2.75 percent bonds due September
2017 increased one basis point to 3.01 percent, Korea Exchange
Inc. prices show. The one-year interest-rate swap was little
changed at 2.82 percent.  South Koreans vote Dec. 19 to replace President  Lee Myung
Bak , whose five-year term ends in February. Candidate Lee Jung
Hee abandoned the race yesterday, providing a boost for main
opposition contender Moon Jae In as he trails the front-runner
from the ruling New Frontier Party by less than 1 percentage
point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
