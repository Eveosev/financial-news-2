Duke University moved into the No. 1
spot in the Associated Press Top 25 college basketball poll, two
days after  Indiana  lost for the first time this season.  The Blue Devils (9-0) received 62 first-place votes from
the 65-member national media panel, with the Hoosiers dropping
to No. 6.  Indiana (9-1) held the No. 1 ranking through the first five
weeks of the season after being voted to the top spot in the
preseason poll. It lost to Butler 88-86 in overtime on Dec. 15
in Indianapolis.  This is the 123rd week Duke has been No. 1 in the poll, 11
weeks behind UCLAâ€™s record of 134 weeks. The last time Duke held
the top spot was during an 11-week run during the 2010-11
season, according to AP.  Michigan (11-0) and Syracuse moved up one place each to
second and third.  Arizona , Louisville, Indiana, Ohio State,
Florida,  Kansas  and Illinois complete the top 10.  To contact the reporter on this story:
