India ’s rupee fell to the lowest
level in almost two weeks on speculation importers stepped up
purchases of the dollar and as the government lowered its growth
estimate for the economy.  The  Finance Ministry  said today gross domestic product will
increase 5.7 percent to 5.9 percent this fiscal year through
March, less than an earlier estimate of as much as 7.85 percent.
That would be the slowest pace in a decade and in line with the
central bank’s October forecast of 5.8 percent. The  Reserve Bank 
of India will keep its benchmark  repurchase rate  at 8 percent
tomorrow, according to 24 of 25 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg. One predicts a 50 basis point cut.  Dollar-demand from importers will keep pressure on the
rupee, L. Subramanian, a currency analyst at  ICICI Bank Ltd. (ICICIBC)  in
Mumbai, wrote in a research report today. Investors are “likely
to remain cautious ahead of the RBI’s policy meeting tomorrow,”
he wrote.  The rupee dropped 0.7 percent to 54.8550 per dollar in
Mumbai, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It touched
54.8950 earlier, the weakest level since Dec. 4. The currency
has fallen 3.3 percent this year after plunging 16 percent in
2011. One-month implied volatility, a gauge of expected moves in
exchange rates used to price options, was unchanged at 10.05
percent.  The monetary authority will lower banks’  cash reserve
requirements  to 4 percent tomorrow from 4.25 percent, according
to 19 of 23 analysts in a separate survey. Three forecast no
change and one sees a reduction to 3.75 percent. Inflation
unexpectedly slowed to 7.24 percent last month from 7.45 percent
in October, official data showed Dec. 14. The rate is still
above the central bank’s so-called comfort zone of around 5
percent.  Three-month onshore rupee forwards traded at 55.69 per
dollar, compared with 55.48 on Dec. 14, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Offshore non-deliverable contracts were
at 55.64 versus 55.33. Forwards are agreements to buy or sell
assets at a set price and date. Non-deliverable contracts are
settled in dollars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
