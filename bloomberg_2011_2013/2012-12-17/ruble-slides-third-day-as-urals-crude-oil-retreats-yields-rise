The ruble weakened for a third day
against the dollar, sliding by the most in almost eight weeks as
importers of consumer goods bought foreign currency during the
year’s busiest shopping season.  The ruble slid 0.7 percent against the dollar to 30.9400 by
the close in Moscow, the biggest drop since Oct. 23 and its
longest losing streak since Oct. 29. It lost 1.1 percent versus
the central bank’s target euro-dollar basket to 35.3678 and
declined 1.4 percent versus the euro to 40.7795. An index of
five-year government bond yields compiled by the Micex rose six
basis points to 6.48 percent.  “Sellers of consumer goods, mostly electronics, are
actively buying foreign currency,” Vladimir Pantyushin, chief
economist at Barclays Plc’s investment-banking unit in Moscow
said by phone today. “They need to pay for goods delivered to
 Russia . Sales have reportedly been strong ahead of the
holidays.”  An average Russian plans to spend 382 euros ($503) on
presents, parties and entertainment during the year-end
holidays, a 9 percent increase from the year before, the
Vedomosti newspaper reported on Dec. 4, citing a survey by
Deloitte. OAO M.Video, a Russian electronics retailer, is among
the top stock choices for 2013 at Credit Suisse Group AG,
according to a report emailed on Dec. 13.  Non-deliverable forwards showed the ruble at 31.4072 per
dollar in three months.  The extra yield investors demand to own Russia’s dollar
bonds over U.S. Treasuries fell three basis points to 173,
according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s EMBI Global Index.  To contact the reporters on this story:
