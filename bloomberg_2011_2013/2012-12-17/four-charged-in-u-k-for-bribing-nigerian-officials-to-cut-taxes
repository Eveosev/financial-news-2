Four former Swift Technical Energy
Solutions Ltd. employees were charged with conspiring to bribe
Nigerian officials to lower the taxes their workers paid in the
country.  Three men and one woman, all British nationals, were
charged this morning at a London criminal court following a two-
year probe of the company, which is a Nigerian subsidiary of the
Swift Group companies, the U.K. Serious Fraud Office said in an
e-mailed statement today.  The defendants -- a former chief financial officer, tax
manager, financial controller and area director for  Nigeria  --
allegedly paid a total of 180,000 pounds ($292,000) in bribes in
2008 and 2009 to agents of the Rivers State Board of Internal
Revenue and the Lagos State Board of Internal Revenue, according
to prosecutors.  The bribes were paid to avoid, reduce or delay paying taxes
on behalf of the oil- and gas-industry workers whom Swift sent
to Nigeria, the SFO said. The case was transferred to a higher
criminal court for a hearing on Feb. 22 and the defendants were
released on bail.  “The company itself is not under investigation and has
fully supported the inquiry,” Swift spokesman Andrew Honnor
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
