Daimler AG (DAI) , the world’s third-
largest maker of  luxury vehicles , merged two Mercedes-Benz sales
units in  China  to streamline operations in a bid to boost car
deliveries by a third in the country by 2015.  The new unit, called Mercedes-Benz Sales Service Co., will
coordinate distribution for the brand in China and is a 50-50
joint venture with Beijing Automotive Group Co. Ltd., the
Stuttgart, Germany-based carmaker said today in a statement.
Mercedes previously had separate units overseeing imported
vehicles and locally made cars.  “With the establishment of the new sales company, we are
now increasing the effectiveness of our sales organization and
setting a course for long-term and sustainable growth,” Chief
Executive Officer  Dieter Zetsche  said in the statement.  The merger is a response to sluggish growth in China, the
world’s largest auto market. Mercedes deliveries advanced 4.2
percent this year through November, trailing growth of more than
30 percent at Bayerische Motoren Werke AG and  Volkswagen AG (VOW) ’s
Audi. Daimler last week appointed Hubertus Troska to a new
management-board position to push China expansion.  Daimler is targeting China sales of 300,000 cars a year by
2015, compared with 223,000 last year in an expansion
underpinned by 20 new and refreshed models over the next three
years. Mercedes plans to add 50 dealerships annually in the
country.  To contact the reporter on this story:
