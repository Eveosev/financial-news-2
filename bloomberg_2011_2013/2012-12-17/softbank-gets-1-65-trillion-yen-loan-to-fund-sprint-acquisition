Softbank Corp. (9984) , the Japanese carrier
buying 70 percent of  Sprint Nextel Corp. (S)  for about $20 billion,
said its board approved a bridge loan of as much as 1.65
trillion yen ($19.7 billion) to finance the deal.  The nation’s third-largest mobile-phone company said it
would use the loan proceeds to invest about $20.1 billion in
Sprint, as detailed in its Oct. 15 announcement, and plans to
refinance the facility with mid- and long-term debt, according
to a statement to the Tokyo Stock Exchange.  Japan ’s three megabanks, Mizuho Corporate Bank Ltd.,
Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp. and Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ
Ltd., are the loan’s mandated lead arrangers, along with
Deutsche Bank AG, according to today’s statement. The loan will
be split into two parts, facility A of 250 billion yen and
facility B of 1.4 trillion yen.  Softbank is closing the gap on its bigger rivals  NTT DoCoMo
Inc. (9437)  and  KDDI Corp. (9433)  by cutting fees and adding more lucrative
smartphone subscribers, thanks in part to its being the first
mobile carrier in Japan to offer the iPhone series. It’s also
seeking to increase users outside the country, and its purchase
of Sprint, based in Overland Park, Kansas, would bring customer
numbers to about 96 million in Japan and the U.S.  Shares in Softbank closed 1.95 percent higher at 2,987 yen.
The stock has gained 31.8 percent this year, versus a 10.9
percent advance for the broader  Topix index .  Facility A of the loan will be drawn down on Dec. 21 and
facility B at the time of the Sprint acquisition, according to
the statement. Proceeds from the smaller facility will be used
to finance the investment in Sprint in the form of newly-issued
convertible bonds, while the 1.4 trillion yen portion will be
used for the investment in and resulting acquisition of Sprint.
Both parts will mature on Dec. 17, 2013.  Softbank said it expects to record about 17 billion yen in
costs associated with the loan as non-operating expenses in its
income statement for the fiscal year ending March 31.  To contact the reporters on this story:
