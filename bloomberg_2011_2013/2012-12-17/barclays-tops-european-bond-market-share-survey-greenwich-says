Barclays Plc has the biggest share
of trading in the European fixed-income bond market this year,
according to the latest survey by consulting firm Greenwich
Associates.  The London-based bank led 1,241 fixed-income investment
professionals based in Europe and the  Middle East , taking 13.3
percent of overall market share. It was also ranked highest for
the quality of its European fixed-income sales, research and
trading, Greenwich said in an e-mailed report.  Deutsche Bank AG (DB)  was ranked second, with a market share of
11.9 percent and JPMorgan Chase & Co. came third with 8.5
percent. Deutsche topped separate measures of market share in
credit- and emerging-market fixed-income trading.  Greenwich sees changes to the fixed-income market
“accelerating as a result of regulatory implementation and
capital requirements,” the report said. “These changes have
forced dealers to pare fixed-income inventories in products that
are more costly to hold, and will likely reduce liquidity in
markets for corporate bonds and other products.”  The study took place between May and July, the Stamford,
Connecticut-based firm said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
