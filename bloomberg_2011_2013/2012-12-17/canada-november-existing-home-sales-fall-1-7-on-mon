Canadian existing home sales fell
1.7 percent in November from the previous month, a realtor group
said, led by Toronto’s weakening housing market.  Sales were down 11.9 percent from a year earlier, the
 Canadian Real Estate Association  said in an e-mailed  statement .
The number of homes sold in Toronto, the country’s biggest
housing market, fell 4.4 percent in November from October and
18.3 percent from a year earlier.  The country’s housing market is cooling after policy makers
took measures to tighten mortgage lending amid concern that a
bubble was building in some markets. Finance Minister  Jim
Flaherty  tightened rules on government-insured mortgages in July
for the fourth time in four years, while the Office of the
Superintendent of Financial Institutions, the country’s banking
regulator, introduced tougher standards for mortgage lenders.  “National sales activity lacks the momentum it had a year
ago,” Gregory Klump, chief executive of the Ottawa-based
realtor group, said in the statement. “ Interest rates  have
remained low and the economic backdrop has remained supportive
for housing activity, so that should leave little doubt that
recent changes to mortgage regulations are responsible for
having cooled activity.”  The average national price for existing homes fell 0.8
percent in November from October and from the same month a year
earlier.  The real estate group today also cut its forecast for
resales in 2012 and 2013. It projects 456,300 homes will be sold
this year, down from 466,900 projected in September, and said
447,400 units will be sold next year, down from the earlier
forecast of 457,800.  To contact the reporter on this story:
