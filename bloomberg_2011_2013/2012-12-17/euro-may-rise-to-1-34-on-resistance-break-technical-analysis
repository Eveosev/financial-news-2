The euro may rise 1.9 percent
against the dollar after climbing above a key level of
resistance, Morgan Stanley said, citing trading patterns.  The 17-nation currency is poised to extend this month’s
advance after strengthening above the peak set on Sept. 17,
according to strategists at the company including  Hans Redeker 
and  Ian Stannard  in  London . The next target is the high set at
the end of March, they said.  “The top end of the three-month range has been breached,
suggesting the way towards our $1.34 target has been opened,”
the strategists wrote in a note to clients. “The euro has
extended the recovery trend and we expect further gains in the
coming week.”  The shared currency fell 0.1 percent to $1.3154 at 2:29 p.m.
London time after rising to $1.3190, the highest level since May
2. The target of $1.34 was chosen because it coincides with the
peak of $1.3386 set on March 27, Morgan Stanley said. The last
time the currency reached $1.34 was on Feb. 29.  Morgan Stanley recommends investors bet the euro will
extends its 1.3 percent gain this month and place an automatic
order to exit the trade if the currency weakens to $1.3040.  The strategists said one risk to further euro gains is the
German Ifo institute’s  business climate  report on Dec. 19. The
ZEW Center for European Economic Research said on Dec. 12 that
its gauge of the country’s investor confidence jumped to a
seven-month high in December.  “Market expectations regarding German Ifo have likely been
increased following the strong reading of the ZEW, leaving open
the potential for disappointment,” the report said.  Resistance is an area where technical analysts anticipate
sell orders to be clustered.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
