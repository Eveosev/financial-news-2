A team of British scientists who are
drilling through three kilometers (2 miles) of ice to search for
life in a sub-glacial lake are facing a delay after a component
of their boiler broke.  The researchers were using a secondary burner to melt snow
needed for their hot-water drill when that failed two days ago,
the British Antarctic Survey, a member of the drilling group,
said today in an e-mailed statement.  “Both units demonstrated the same problem,” the BAS said.
“The engineering team is in contact with the manufacturers of
the units who are helping them to determine the cause of the
malfunction.”  The researchers had hoped to reach Lake Ellsworth, 3
kilometers under the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, yesterday. They
wanted to deploy probes today to see if any organisms survive in
the waters of the lake. Instead, they’re waiting for a new
component, and are unlikely to begin drilling again until Dec.
21, BAS said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
