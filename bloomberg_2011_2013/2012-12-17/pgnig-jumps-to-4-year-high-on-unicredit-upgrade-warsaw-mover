Polskie Gornictwo Naftowe i
Gazownictwo SA ,  Poland ’s biggest gas distributor, jumped to the
highest level in almost five years as  UniCredit SpA (UCG)  recommended
buying its shares on speculation that increased oil and gas
production will boost earnings.  The stock advanced 2.7 percent to 5 zloty in Warsaw, the
highest since January 2008 as UniCredit upgraded PGNiG, as the
company is known, to buy from hold and raised its price estimate
to 5.42 zloty from 4.42 zloty.  “PGNiG offers attractive medium-term growth in exploration
and production,” Flawiusz Pawluk, head of equity research at
UniCredit in Warsaw, said in a note. “In addition, the company
owns exciting unconventional gas acreages in Poland and trades
at fairly attractive valuations.”  Oil production may increase “more than 130 percent” by
2014, according to UniCredit. Exploration of oil and gas from
 Norway ’s Skarv project will help generate net cash of as much as
1.2 billion zloty ($386 million) annually.  The Warsaw-based company’s net income will probably climb
to 2.74 billion zloty next year from 2 billion zloty seen in
2012, according to UniCredit estimates.  The Warsaw-based utility plans to update its strategy and
to double its gas exploration “in several years,” Dziennik
Gazeta Prawna reported today, citing Chief Executive Officer
Grazyna Piotrowska-Oliwa. PGNiG’s annual gas production amounts
now to 4.5 billion cubic meters of gas.  To contact the reporter on this story:
