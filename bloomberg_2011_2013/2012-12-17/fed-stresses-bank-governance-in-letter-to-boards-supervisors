The Federal Reserve stressed the
responsibility of boards and managers for governance in a letter
to banks and their supervisors that also outlined other
priorities for oversight.  A bank’s “board is expected to establish and maintain the
firm’s culture, incentives, structure, and processes that
promote its compliance with laws, regulations, and supervisory
guidance,” the letter, released today in  Washington , said. The
letter also called for managers to set “appropriate
compensation and other incentives that are consistent with the
institutional risk appetite.”  Many of the items on the Fed’s letter, such as heightened
standards for capital and liquidity, are already under way as a
result of the annual stress tests and tougher supervisory
oversight. Governance is one area the Fed rarely discusses.  The Fed has been evolving its approach to large bank
supervision partly as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act and also in
response to its own shortcomings during the 2008-2009 financial
crisis. The Fed said the guidance in the letter “does not apply
to community banking organizations, defined as institutions
supervised by the Federal Reserve with total consolidated assets
of $10 billion or less.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
