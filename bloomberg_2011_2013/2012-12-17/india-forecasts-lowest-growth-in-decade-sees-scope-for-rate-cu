India’s  economy  may grow at the
slowest pace in a decade in the current financial year,
according to forecasts by the  Finance Ministry , which predicts
inflation will slow enough to allow interest-rate cuts.  Asia’s third-largest economy may expand about 5.7 percent
to 5.9 percent in the year through March, less than an earlier
estimate of as much as 7.85 percent, the ministry said in a mid-
year review presented in Parliament today. That would be the
smallest gain since the year ended March 31, 2003, when gross
domestic product grew 4 percent.  The  Reserve Bank  of India, which decides on monetary policy
tomorrow, has so far resisted calls from Finance Minister
Palaniappan Chidambaram for lower rates, opting to keep the
repurchase rate at 8 percent to damp inflation in October while
reducing the cash reserve ratio. To revive confidence in an
economy with one of Asia’s worst performing currencies this year,
Prime Minister  Manmohan Singh  in recent months pushed through
policy overhauls to allow more foreign investment in retail and
curbed energy subsidies.  “Both fiscal and monetary policies, however, would need to
be supportive to sustain investor confidence,” the ministry said.
A moderation in inflation that may commence in the January-to-
March quarter and benign global commodity prices will
“facilitate softening of the monetary policy stance of the
RBI,” it said.  Inflation at the end of March will probably moderate to 6.8
to 7 percent and the  budget deficit  will be contained at 5.3
percent of GDP, the Finance Ministry said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
