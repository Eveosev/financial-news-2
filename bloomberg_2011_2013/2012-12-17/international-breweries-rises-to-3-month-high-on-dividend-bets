International Breweries Plc (INTBREW)  rose to
its highest level in three months as investors’ bet the Nigerian
brewer will pay a dividend for this year.  The company jumped 10 percent to 15.62 naira at close in
Lagos, Nigeria’s commercial capital, the highest level since
Sept. 19. The number of shares traded was 58 percent of the
stock’s three-month moving average, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  “Investors expect a dividend of between 60 kobo and 70
kobo per share,” Raheem Mohammed, the chief operating officer
of Kundila Finance Ltd., said by phone from Lagos today.  Profit for the nine months through September rose to 1.29
billion naira ($8.2 million) from 635.3 million naira a year
earlier, the company said on Nov. 2. Revenue rose to 9.1 billion
naira from 6.9 billion naira.  “The last quarter is always the best for breweries because
of higher consumption,” Mohammed said.  International Breweries raised 7 billion naira in 2011
through a rights issue to refinance its debt and buy capital
equipment.  The company has not paid dividends “for a long time, and
now that its performance has improved, investors expect it must
pay a dividend,” Mohammed said.  The shares have surged 174 percent this year, compared with
a 33.3 percent rise in the Nigerian Stock Exchange All-Share
Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
