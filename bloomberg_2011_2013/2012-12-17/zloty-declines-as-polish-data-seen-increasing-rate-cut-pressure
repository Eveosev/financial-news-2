The zloty weakened before data this
week that’s expected to show  Poland ’s economic slowdown is
deepening, adding pressure on the central bank to reduce
borrowing costs further.  The zloty retreated 0.3 percent to 4.0921 per euro at 4:34
p.m. in Warsaw. The yield on notes maturing in October 2023 fell
less than 1 basis point to 3.91 percent.  Polish  corporate employment  probably declined 0.2 percent
from a year earlier in November, the statistics office will say
tomorrow, according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey
of 22 economists.  Industrial output  data, to be published in two
days, slowed to its weakest pace in three months, according to
the survey, as demand from the euro area weakened.  “The data out this week will confirm the economic growth
is slowing,” Cezary Chrapek, a fixed-income and currency market
analyst at Citigroup Inc., said in an e-mailed note to clients.
“It will open the way for further rate cuts.”  The economy suffered its slowest pace of growth in more
than three years last quarter, prompting the central bank to cut
its main rate by a quarter point in each of the two last months.
Forward-rate agreements signal trader  bets  for 105 basis points
in further cuts over the next six months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
