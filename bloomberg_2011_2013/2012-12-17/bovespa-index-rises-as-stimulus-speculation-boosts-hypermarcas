Most Brazilian stocks rose, led by
planemaker  Embraer SA (EMBR3)  while homebuilders including  Rossi
Residencial SA (RSID3)  rose amid speculation policy makers may take
further steps to boost Brazil’s recovery as a central bank
survey showed economists cut growth forecasts.  Vale SA (VALE3)  jumped to a five-month high as iron ore advanced
for a 10th straight day on declining stockpiles in China. Oil
company  OGX Petroleo e Gas Participacoes SA  slumped the most in
two weeks.  The  Bovespa (IBOV)  index fell 0.1 percent to 59,566.52 at the
close in Sao Paulo. Thirty-six stocks advanced on the gauge
while 26 fell. The real weakened 0.7 percent to 2.0996 per  U.S.
dollar . Swap rates on most contracts declined after a central
bank survey of about 100 economists showed the median estimate
for 2013 growth fell for a fifth week, dropping to 3.4 percent
from 3.5 percent.  “With mounting signs that the economy is not growing as
fast as the government had expected, more stimulus measures are
likely to be announced throughout 2013,”  Luciano Rostagno , the
chief strategist at Banco WestLB do Brasil SA, said by phone
from Sao Paulo.  Embraer rose 4.5 percent to 13.35 reais, the biggest gain
in two months.  Rossi gained 2.2 percent to 4.58 reais. The BM&FBovespa
Real Estate Index rose 0.6 percent.  Vale, the world’s largest iron-ore mining company, jumped
1.4 percent to 40.31 reais.  Iron ore  for immediate delivery rose
2.2 percent to $132.20 a dry ton, poised for its longest winning
streak since June, according to a  price index  compiled by The
Steel Index Ltd.  OGX fell 5.3 percent to 4.31 reais.  ‘External Outlook’  “Vale is tracking gains in iron-ore prices amid what seems
to be a more favorable external outlook,” Fausto Gouveia, who
helps manage 380 million reais at Legan Administracao de
Recursos, said by phone from  Sao Paulo . “Signs that growth in
China will remain strong are positive for iron-ore and as
consequence for Vale.”  The Bovespa index has climbed 14 percent from this year’s
low in June as stimulus from central banks around the world
eased concerns about an economic slowdown, while record-low
benchmark lending rates pushed some investors to move into
stocks from fixed income.  The index  trades  at 11.1 times analysts’ earnings estimates
for the next four quarters, in line with the ratio for MSCI
Inc.’s measure of 21 developing nations’ equities, data compiled
by Bloomberg show.  Trading volume was 6.76 billion reais in stocks in Sao
Paulo, data compiled by Bloomberg show. That compares with a
daily average of 7.26 billion reais this year through Dec. 14,
according to data compiled by the  exchange .  To contact the reporters on this story:
