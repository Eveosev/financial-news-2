Kuwait, OPEC’s fourth-biggest
producer, had a preliminary budget surplus of 14.67 billion
dinars ($52.2 billion) in the first seven months of the fiscal
year ending March 31, 2013, the Finance Ministry said.  Government income was 18.86 billion dinars, including oil
revenue of 17.99 billion dinars, and spending was 4.19 billion
dinars, according to data posted on the ministry’s  website 
today. Government spending is normally higher in the second half
of the year.  The 2012-2013 budget has projected spending of 21.2 billion
dinars, which includes about 9 billion dinars for salaries and
wages, and revenue of 13.9 billion dinars. The government said
it will raise revenue allocations to its Future Generations Fund
this fiscal year to 25 percent from 10 percent to “encourage
saving.”  Kuwait posted a record budget surplus of 13.2 billion
dinars in the 2011-2012 fiscal year as oil prices and output
rose. The Gulf state pumped 2.8 million barrels of oil a day in
November, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  While Kuwait’s economy grew 8.2 percent in 2011, it was the
slowest among the six Gulf Cooperation Council countries in the
previous five years. The International Monetary Fund  forecasts 
economic growth at 6.6 percent this year and 1.8 percent in
2013. The country will exhaust all oil revenue by 2017 if the
government’s current spending policy continues, the IMF said in
May.  To contact the reporter on this story:
