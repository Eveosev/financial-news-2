Ukraine plans to sell state stakes
in VAT Odeskyi Pryportovyi Zavod, the country’s second-biggest
ammonia producer, VAT Turboatom, Ukraine’s biggest turbine
maker, and more than 200 other assets next year, according to
the State Property Fund.  The government will sell a 75.2 percent stake in Turboatom
and 99.6 percent of Odeskyi, the State Property Fund, said in a
 statement  on its website today siting a Cabinet resolution dated
Dec. 7.  The SPF, which is based in the capital Kiev, will also sell
60.9 percent in VAT Makiivskiy Metalurhiynyi Kombinat.  The government of Prime Minister  Mykola Azarov  is seeking
to raise 10.9 billion hryvnia ($1.35 billion) from state-asset
sales next year, according to the 2013 state budget. President
 Viktor Yanukovych  signed the state budget today after it was
supported by the legislature earlier this month, his website
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
