Bank of England  official Brunello Rosa is leaving to join Roubini Global Economics LLC as London’s finance industry continues to lure central bank staff to more lucrative jobs.  Rosa, an analyst at the Sterling Markets division, was hired as a director covering macro and fixed-income strategy, Arnab Das, managing director of market research and strategy, said by telephone today. A Bank of England spokesman confirmed that Rosa has resigned.  Rosa joined the Bank of England in 2009 having previously worked as a fixed-income strategist at IDEAglobal. His departure is the latest in a series of resignations as a second year of pay freezes adds to the attractiveness of the private sector. Robert Wood, who led analysis of British data for policy makers, resigned to join Berenberg Bank in September.  Governor  Mervyn King , who implemented the salary freeze last year, singled out the struggle to hire and keep staff as a potential risk to the central bank’s monetary-policy analysis in this year’s annual report.  Rosa, who studied at the University of Siena and the  London School of Economics , has also lectured at the LSE.
