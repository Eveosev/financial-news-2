Japanese shares  gained, with the
 Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average rising to its highest in eight months,
as the yen fell after the  Liberal Democratic Party  regained
power. Tokyo Electric Power Co. led gains on expectations the
new government will allow the restart of nuclear reactors.  Tokyo Electric, also known as Tepco, surged 33 percent to
lead utilities higher.  Fast Retailing (9983)  Co.,  Asia ’s biggest
clothing retailer, gained 2.9 percent. Toyota Motor Corp., the
world’s biggest carmaker, rose 0.6 percent after the yen
weakened against the dollar. Property-developer Tokyo Tatemono
Co. increased 5.9 percent.  The Nikkei 225 rose 0.9 percent to 9,828.88 at the 3 p.m.
close of trading in Tokyo, its highest close since April 3. The
measure has gained 13 percent since Nov. 14 when elections were
announced. The LDP has called for more easing and a doubling of
the nation’s inflation goal. The broader Topix Index climbed 0.9
percent to 807.84, with about two stocks gaining for each that
fell.  “The market hasn’t priced in this kind of a landslide
win,” said  Hideyuki Ishiguro , senior strategist at Okasan
Securities Co. in Tokyo. “There’s more certainty that LDP will
make progress in deflation-fighting agenda. This could be a
 turning point  for Japanese stocks.”  The LDP yesterday captured 294 seats in the 480-member
lower house of parliament, while Prime Minister  Yoshihiko Noda ’s
 Democratic Party  of  Japan  lost three-fourths of its lawmakers,
according to public broadcaster NHK’s vote count.  LDP leader
Shinzo Abe, 58, is set to replace Noda, returning to the office
he left five years ago for health reasons.  Economy Reeling  Japan’s economy, still reeling from last year’s record
earthquake and nuclear disaster, last quarter fell into its
fifth technical recession in 15 years, while confidence among
the country’s largest manufacturers slid to the lowest in about
three years, according to the Bank of Japan’s Tankan index.  Fast Retailing, the operator of the Uniqlo clothing store,
gained 2.9 percent to 20,500 yen. Tokyo Tatemono jumped 5.9
percent to 362 yen. Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc., the
nation’s biggest bank by assets, rose 1.8 percent to 395 yen.  Smaller companies also gained today, with the  Jasdaq Top-20
Index (JASDAQ20)  rising for ninth consecutive day, its longest winning
streak on record. Jasdaq Securities Exchange Inc. is Japan’s
biggest market for start-up companies, and the Jasdaq Top-20
measures the best performers on the exchange.  ‘Investors Relieved’  “Investors are relieved for now,” said  Naoki Fujiwara ,
chief  fund manager  at Shinkin Asset Management Co., which
oversees about $6.3 billion. The LDP “obtained a lot more seats
than was expected, so there may be more optimism that they can
implement policies. A lot of the expectations for their monetary
easing has been priced into stocks, so for things to rise
further, they need to make it a reality.”  The Japanese yen weakened to the lowest level against the
dollar since April 2011 on bets Abe’s victory in Japan’s general
election adds to the case for the nation’s central bank to
expand stimulus as early as this week.  Exporters advanced. Toyota Motor increased 0.6 percent to
3,620 yen. Nissan Motor Co., which counts  North America  as its
biggest market for sales, rose 1.8 percent to 799 yen.  Sony
Corp. (6758) , Japan’s biggest exporter of consumer electronics, rose
1.4 percent to 919 yen.  “This is going to have a tremendous impact on the fortunes
of Japanese exporters and the economy,”  Ed Rogers , chief
executive officer at Tokyo-based Rogers Investment Advisors,
said in a Bloomberg Television interview today. “The moves in
the dollar-yen indicate that the world at large believes that
we’re starting on the path to reflation.”  Nuclear Power  Electricity suppliers lead gains among the Topix’s 33
industry groups on expectations the new government will allow
the restart of nuclear reactors shut in the aftermath of the
Fukushima meltdown.  Tokyo Electric Power, owner of the Fukushima nuclear power
station, surged 33 percent to 202 yen, the  biggest gain  on the
Nikkei 225. Kansai Electric Power Co. leapt 18 percent to 920
yen, while Chubu Electric Power Co. advanced 9.6 percent to
1,188 yen.  Hiroyuki Hosoda, the chairman of the LDP’s general council,
said Japan must restart its nuclear  power plants  quickly after
confirming they are safe in a Nov. 26 interview.  Among stocks that fell, Asahi Glass Co. lost 2.3 percent to
626 yen. The company is likely to post 95 billion yen in
operating profit, missing its 100 billion yen forecast, the
Nikkei reported, without saying where it got the information.  S&P 500 futures gained 0.2 percent today. The gauge dropped
0.4 percent on Dec. 14, the first weekly decline in a month, as
a drop in Apple Inc. shares and concern about a lack of progress
in budget talks outweighed a rise in industrial production and
data showing  China ’s manufacturing may expand at a faster pace.  The Nikkei 225 has risen 16 percent this year, its best
annual performance since 2009, when the measure climbed 19
percent. The measure’s 14-day relative strength index is at 79
today, its highest level since March 2. Some traders use a
reading above 70 as a sign the measure is overbought.  The Topix trades at 0.96 times book value, compared with
2.1 for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and 1.5 for the Europe
Stoxx 600 Index. A number less than one means that companies can
be bought for less than the value of their assets.  The Nikkei Stock Average Volatility Index sank 10 percent
to 17.51 today, indicating traders expect a swing of about 5
percent on the benchmark gauge over the next 30 days.  To contact the reporters on this story:
