Puerto Rico ’s incoming
administration may use taxable pension bonds to strengthen the
worst-funded retirement system in the U.S., officials said.  Governor-elect Alejandro Garcia Padilla, a member of the
Popular Democratic Party, is set to take office Jan. 2. The new
administration will draft proposed changes to the pension system
within one or two months, David Chafey, who will take the post
of chairman of the board of directors of the Government
Development Bank for Puerto Rico, said today in a call with
reporters. The bank is the commonwealth’s fiscal agent.  While selling debt to increase the fund’s assets isn’t his
“first choice,” Chafey said the island may use pension bonds
along with unspecified changes to the system.  “It does need new sources of funding,” he said. “We need
to look at that as an option.”  Puerto Rico’s pension system had assets equaling 6.8
percent of estimated retirement payments as of June 30, 2011.
Illinois had a ratio of about 43 percent, the lowest among U.S.
states, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Moody’s Investors Service last week cut Puerto Rico’s
credit rating to one level above speculative grade partly
because of a “lack of meaningful pension reform.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
