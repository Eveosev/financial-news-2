Dollar-denominated bond sales in
Asia outside of  Japan  may drop by about 15 percent next year
after a record 2012, according to Bank of America Corp.
Borrowers paused offerings today ahead of year-end holidays.  Issuance will slow in 2013 as companies have low
refinancing requirements, while economic growth is set to pick
up only moderately, Bank of America analysts wrote in a report
this month. Still, even a 15 percent decline in Asian dollar
bond offerings would make 2013 the second-busiest year ever,
behind the $121.1 billion raised in the current period,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “It’s going to be active again next year,” Alan Schmoll,
Hong Kong-based director, Asia-Pacific debt syndicate at Bank of
America’s Merrill Lynch unit, said in a phone interview today.
“While supply will likely be lower than the record-setting
volume of this year, 2013 could still be one of the busiest
years on record.”  Investors flocked to debt from the world’s fastest-growing
region in 2012, spurring a 15 percent return on Asian corporate
bonds in dollars that outpaced the 10 percent gain on company
notes globally, Merrill Lynch indexes show.  Asia ’s economy will
expand 6.8 percent in 2013, from a 6.3 percent pace this year,
according to strategists surveyed by Bloomberg. Growth averaged
8.1 percent in the five years through 2011.  U.S. currency bond offerings in the region paused for a
second business day today as investors and issuers head into the
Christmas holiday period. Zoomlion Heavy Industry Science &
Technology Co., a Chinese concrete and hoisting machinery maker,
raised $600 million selling 6.125 percent notes on Dec. 13 in
the only sale last week, Bloomberg-compiled data show.  Dollar Premiums  Yield premiums on dollar bonds in Asia have risen to 265.1
basis points on Dec. 14 from a record-low 247.2 basis points on
Oct. 19, according to HSBC Holdings Plc indexes.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan was little changed at 109 basis points
as of 08:24 a.m. in  Hong Kong , Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc
prices show.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index retreated 2.5 basis points to
161 basis points as of 10:00 a.m. in  Tokyo , Citigroup Inc.
prices show. The gauge has slid nine basis points over the past
week, according to prices from Citigroup and data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index declined 0.5 basis point
to 123.5 as of 11:23 a.m in Sydney, according to  Westpac Banking
Corp. (WBC)  The measure has dropped five basis points over the past
week, according to Westpac and CMA, which is owned by McGraw-
Hill Cos. and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the privately
negotiated market.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
