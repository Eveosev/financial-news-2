Hyundai Motor Co. (005380)  led South Korea’s
auto stocks lower in  Seoul  trading after the yen fell to its
weakest level since April 2011 versus the dollar, aiding
Japanese carmakers’ exports.  Hyundai Motor  dropped  2 percent to 225,000 won on the Korea
Exchange, the lowest level since Nov. 28. Affiliate  Kia Motors
Corp. (000270)  slumped 3.6 percent to 59,200 won, while the benchmark
 Kospi index  dropped 0.6 percent.  The yen tumbled after Shinzo Abe, who has called for
“unlimited” monetary easing by the  Bank of Japan  to end
deflation and an increase in public-works spending, won the
country’s general election yesterday. Japanese automakers
compete with South Korean companies in key global markets
including the U.S. A weaker currency boosts the value of
exporters’ overseas sales when converted back to local currency.  “It’s the currency -- the won strengthening while the
Japanese yen weakens,” Lee Sang Hyun, an analyst at NH
Investment & Securities Co., said by telephone today. “There
are concerns in the market that currency movements may have a
negative impact on South Korean automakers.”  The won gained to 12.76 per yen in Seoul, after earlier
reaching the strongest level in 20 months. South Korea’s central
bank Governor Kim Choong Soo said last week that “appropriate”
action on won volatility will be taken if needed.  Hyundai Mobis (012330)  Co., South Korea’s biggest auto-parts maker,
sank 3 percent to 291,500 won.  Mando Corp. (060980) , which also
manufactures automotive parts, retreated 4.1 percent to 128,500
won.  To contact the reporters on this story:
