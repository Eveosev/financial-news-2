The number of potential credit
rating downgrades reached 613 at the end of November, the
highest level in 30 months, as Europe’s debt turmoil persists,
according to  Standard & Poor’s .  That’s an increase from 599 in October, according to a
report by S&P’s Global Fixed Income Research released today.
About 18 percent of the possible cuts are banks, with European
lenders making up more than half, the report said. The potential
downgrades affect issuers rated AAA to B- and have either a
negative rating outlook or are on CreditWatch with negative
implications.  “The number of potential bond downgrades has been steadily
increasing during the past two years and is now at a level not
seen since June 2010,” said  Diane Vazza , head of S&P’s Global
Fixed Income Research, in a statement about the report.  The gap between potential downgrades and upgrades has
widened this month to the most since May 2010 “due to the
sovereign crisis in Europe,” Vazza said.  Fifty-two percent of the possible cuts are speculative
grade with B ranked securities making up the largest portion of
issuers. High-yield, high-risk, bonds are rated below Baa3 by
Moody’s and lower than BBB- at S&P.  To contact the reporter on this story:
