A federal court deferred further
proceedings in a lawsuit filed by  Texas  over the state’s voter
identification law until the U.S. Supreme Court rules on whether
part of the Voting Rights Act is constitutional.  A three-judge panel in  Washington  said today that “in the
interest of efficiency and judicial economy” it will wait for
the Supreme Court to review a provision of the 1965 law
requiring all or part of 16 mostly Southern states to get
federal approval before changing their voting rules. The Texas
suit challenges the same provision.  The judges today issued a final judgment on their earlier
rejection of the identification law, allowing Texas to seek an
immediate appeal to the Supreme Court.  The high court said Nov. 9 it would consider a case in
which Shelby County,  Alabama , objects to the formula in Section
5 for determining which jurisdictions must get pre-clearance of
laws affecting voting qualifications and procedures. The court
will hear arguments in the case on Feb. 27.  A Texas law requiring photo identification to vote was
rejected by a three-judge panel in Washington on Aug. 30 after a
nonjury trial. In order to issue a ruling before the November
election, the panel held off on deciding Texas’s claim that
Section 5 is unconstitutional.  The case is Texas v. Holder, 12-cv-00128, U.S. District
Court, District of Columbia (Washington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
