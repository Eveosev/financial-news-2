Copper fell to a one-week low in  New
York  as a jump in stockpiles monitored by the London Metal
Exchange and a U.S. budget standoff added to demand concerns.  Inventories in warehouses tracked by the LME rose for an
eighth session, climbing 9.5 percent to 298,625 metric tons, the
most since Sept. 5, 2008, exchange data showed today. President
 Barack Obama  and House Speaker  John Boehner  haven’t been able to
reach agreement on how to avoid $600 billion in tax increases
and spending cuts set to start next month.  “The increase in stockpiles is keeping a lid on things,”
Harry Denny, a broker at Hoboken, New Jersey-based PVM Futures
Inc., said in a telephone interview. “Also, with the continued
uncertainty from the fiscal cliff, people aren’t married to
their positions going into year-end.”  Copper futures for March delivery slid 0.3 percent to
$3.672 a pound at 12:10 p.m. on the Comex in New York after
touching $3.6475, the lowest since Dec. 7.  Inventories tracked by the Shanghai Futures Exchange
advanced for a second week, rising 3.7 percent to 205,385 tons,
data from the bourse showed Dec. 14.  The rise in copper stockpiles “is the key reason for a
weakness at the moment,” Angus Staines, an analyst at UBS AG in
 London , said by telephone. Demand in  China , the biggest buyer of
the metal, won’t pick up until the Chinese New Year, celebrated
in February, he said.  The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approved
JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s plan for an exchange-traded fund backed
by physical copper.  On the LME, copper for delivery in three months declined
less than 0.1 percent to $8,061 a metric ton ($3.66 a pound).  Aluminum and nickel were also lower in London. Tin, lead
and zinc rose.  To contact the reporters on this story:
