Colombia ’s peso bond yields rose as
lawmakers debate a tax bill this week that includes a proposal
to lower foreigners’ bond profits.  The yield on the government’s 10 percent peso-denominated
bonds due in July 2024 rose one basis point, or 0.01 percentage
point, to 5.94 percent, according to the central bank. The price
fell 0.157 centavo to 133.293 centavos per peso.  “We’ll continue to see a lot of volatility in the market
this week with the  tax reform ,” said Jorge Cardozo, an analyst
at Corredores Asociados brokerage in Bogota.  Finance Minister  Mauricio Cardenas  told Caracol Radio today
that a 25 percent tax on foreigners’ bond profits is
“adequate.” His comments come after Senator Juan Mario
Laserna, who is part of the government coalition and a member of
the Senate’s economic commission, said in an interview last week
that lawmakers cut the proposed tax on foreigners’ bond profits
to 14 percent in draft legislation being debated in Congress.  Congress is also debating a 5 percent tax on stock
dividends exceeding 200 million pesos ($111,222), which are
currently untaxed, Laserna said in an interview today with W
Radio.  Colombia’s central bank will meet Dec. 21 for this year’s
last monetary policy meeting. The central bank may leave the
overnight lending rate unchanged at 4.5 percent, according to 26
of 27 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. One analyst expects a 25
basis point cut to 4.25 percent.  The peso was little changed at 1,796.1 per  U.S. dollar ,
leaving it 7.9 percent higher for the year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
