U.K. stocks  retreated for a third
day, their longest losing streak in a month, as  Vodafone Group
Plc (VOD)  declined and concern mounted that U.S. lawmakers will fail
to agree on a budget before the holiday.  Vodafone dropped 1.7 percent after paying 1.4 billion euros
($1.8 billion) for frequency at a Dutch spectrum auction.
 Aggreko Plc (AGK)  plunged 22 percent, its biggest slide in more than a
decade, after the company said profit will probably fall in
2013.  Centamin Plc (CEY)  surged 22 percent after saying it has resumed
exports of gold from Egypt.  The  FTSE 100 (UKX)  retreated 9.61 points, or 0.2 percent, to
5,912.15 at the close in London. The equity benchmark has still
 rallied 6.1 percent  this year as the European Central Bank
announced an unlimited bond-buying plan and the Federal Reserve
began a third round of asset purchases. The broader FTSE All-
Share Index also fell 0.2 percent today, while Ireland’s ISEQ
Index slipped 0.5 percent.  “Telecoms today are an easy target to penalize as the
spectrum licenses in the Netherlands were priced a lot higher
than people anticipated,” said Kevin Lilley, a fund manager at
Old Mutual Asset Managers U.K. in  London , which oversees about
4.4 billion pounds ($7.1 billion). “You’ve got the likes of the
U.K. auctioning their licenses next year; the thought is maybe
they’ll go for a similarly aggressive-type approach to the
Dutch,” he said in a phone interview.  U.S. Manufacturing  In the U.S., the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s gauge
of manufacturing in the New York region contracted in December
more than economists had forecast. The index dropped to minus
8.1 from minus 5.2 in November. Economists had predicted the
measure would climb to minus 1, according to a  Bloomberg survey .  U.S. lawmakers continue to discuss a budget deal to avoid
the so-called fiscal cliff, the more than $600 billion in
automatic tax increases and spending cuts due to take effect
next year.  In  Japan , Shinzo Abe’s Liberal Democratic Party reclaimed
power in a landslide victory after pledging to achieve nominal
economic growth of 3 percent with an inflation target of 2
percent. The LDP yesterday won 294 seats in the 480-member lower
house of parliament, according to public broadcaster NHK. Prime
Minister Yoshihiko Noda’s Democratic Party of Japan lost three-
quarters of its lawmakers.  Vodafone declined 1.7 percent to 158.2 pence after the
world’s second-largest mobile-phone operator won spectrum in an
auction in the Netherlands.  Aggreko Plummets  Aggreko plunged 22 percent to 1,664 pence, its biggest
tumble since June 2002. The world’s largest provider of mobile-
power supplies also said net debt may rise by 250 million pounds
to about 620 million pounds at the end of 2012.  AZ Electronic Materials SA (AZEM)  lost 2.9 percent to 344.2 pence
after Numis Securities Ltd. cut its recommendation on the shares
to hold from buy, meaning investors should no longer buy the
stock. The supplier of chemicals used in devices such as Apple
Inc.’s iPad has still rallied 43 percent this year.  Hunting Plc (HTG)  dropped 6 percent to 757.5 pence, falling for a
fifth day. Analysts at Investec Plc, JPMorgan Chase & Co.,
Deutsche Bank AG and Barclays Plc all cut their earnings
forecasts after the U.K. oil-services company said it has become
more cautious on its short-term trading outlook.  Imagination Technologies Group Plc (IMG)  retreated 6.3 percent to
383.5 pence, its  lowest price  in 15 months. The maker of chip
technology for tablet computers and smart phones agreed to
acquire MIPS Technologies Inc.’s assets for $100 million,
increasing its $80 million offer after Ceva Inc. bid $90 million
for the operations on Dec. 11.  Centamin Jumps  Centamin surged 22 percent to 42.1 pence, completing the
biggest two-day rally since its initial public offering in 2001,
after the gold producer said that exports from its Sukari mine
in  Egypt  have resumed. Centamin said production will restart
within the next few days.  Fortune Oil Plc (FTO)  soared 18 percent to 10.75 pence, its
biggest jump in almost two years, after the Hong Kong-based
company said China Gas Holdings Ltd. will buy its Chinese
natural-gas operations for $400 million.  The volume of shares changing hands on FTSE 100 companies
was 12 percent lower than the 30-day average, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
