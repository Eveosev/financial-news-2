Kenya ’s shilling remained at its
weakest level against the dollar in six months as retailers
demanded the U.S. currency to pay for imports for the festive
period.  The currency of  East Africa ’s biggest economy depreciated
less than 0.1 percent to 86.15 per dollar before paring the
losses to trade unchanged at 86.10 per dollar by 10:52 a.m. in
Nairobi, the capital.  Imports in Kenya rise during the Christmas and year-end
period as companies anticipate higher sales. Christians account
for 87 percent of Kenya’s 38 million population, according to
the CIA World Factbook.  Kenya’s  Nakumatt Holdings , the biggest retail chain by
outlets expects to increase its festive season sales by 17
percent compared with the same period last year when sales were
$150 million, Atul Shah, the managing director, said in an e-
mailed statement on Dec. 12.  “There is last minute purchasing of dollars trickling in
before the festive season which is weighing on the shilling,”
John Muli, a dealer at Nairobi-based African Banking Corp., said
by phone. “With the holidays approaching we expect demand to
fizzle out and the shilling to trade within range bound levels
of 86.10 to 86.20 a dollar,” he said.  The  Central Bank  of Kenya cut its daily auction of seven-
day repurchase agreements to 2.7 billion shillings today from 7
billion shillings on Dec. 14, a bank official who asked not to
be named in line with policy, said on phone.  The Ugandan shilling gained 0.4 percent to 2,665.5 a
dollar, appreciating the most since Nov. 26. Tanzania’s shilling
weakened less than 0.1 percent to 1,597 a dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
