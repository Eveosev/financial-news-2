China , the largest foreign lender to
the U.S. government, increased its Treasuries holdings in
October to a five-month high, while  Japan , the second largest
holder, kept pace.  China’s  position  in the debt increased $7.9 billion, or 0.7
percent, to $1.16 trillion, U.S. Treasury Department data
released yesterday show. Japan’s holdings rose $5.2 billion, or
0.5 percent, to a record $1.13 trillion. For the year, Japan has
purchased $76.7 billion of the securities, more than any other
country, compared with $9.6 billion for China.  Rising demand for the debt from the largest holders
followed the  Federal Reserve ’s Sept. 13 decision to increase its
support for the U.S. economy by purchasing $40 billion a month
of mortgage-backed securities and on concern the  European debt
crisis  hasn’t been contained.  “You continued to see some pretty weak data over here and
it didn’t seem like anything was getting any better in  Europe ,”
said Thomas Simons, a government-debt economist in  New York  at
Jefferies & Co., one of 21 primary dealers that trade with the
Fed. That made buying U.S. government debt “something of a
reflex,” Simons said.  The 10-year note yield climbed six basis points, or 0.06
percentage point, to 1.76 percent in New York, the highest level
since Nov. 2, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices, on
speculation officials in  Washington  were making progress on a
budget deal.  China’s Lead  While China holds $26.8 billion more Treasuries than Japan,
that gap has narrowed from $429.7 billion in July 2011, Treasury
data show. At the 2012 pace of  buying , Japan may overtake China
as the largest holder of  U.S. government debt  in February.  Holdings of Treasuries outside the U.S. rose in October by
$6 billion, or 0.1 percent, the smallest increase since December
2011 when foreign ownership declined, the data show. Foreign
investors have boosted their holdings 9.6 percent through
October after climbing 12.8 percent in 2011.  The U.S.  marketable borrowing  reached $10.89 trillion in
October, and was up 9.6 percent this year, Treasury data show.  Foreign investors owned 50.4 percent of the marketable
debt, the least since May, the data, known as Treasury
International Capital, show. China held 7.9 percent of the  U.S.
debt , its smallest share since March 2008. Japan’s stake
comprised 10.4 percent of U.S. government obligations, the least
since October 2011.  “There are many concerns out there about the global
economy and the  U.S. economy ,” said Justin Lederer, an interest
rate strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald LP in New York, a primary
dealer.  With the budget-deficit talks becoming a more urgent
concern as the Dec. 31 deadline nears, foreign purchases may
have climbed after the election “given the rally and ahead of
the fiscal cliff,” Lederer said. “It’s the continued safe-
haven bid.”  Of the $5.48 trillion Treasuries held outside of the U.S.,
72 percent, or $3.96 trillion, are owned by  official
institutions  including central banks, finance ministries and
other fiscal agents, Treasury data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
