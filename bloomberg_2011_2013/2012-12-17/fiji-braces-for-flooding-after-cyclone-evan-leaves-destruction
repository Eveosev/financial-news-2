Fiji, an island chain in the South
Pacific, is preparing for floods after tropical cyclone Evan
destroyed homes, cut power and left thousands sheltering in
evacuation centers.  Flood warnings were issued this morning for rivers and low-
lying areas, according to the Fiji Meteorological Service
 website . While the category 3 cyclone was now moving south,
about 210 kilometers (130 miles) from the capital Suva at 7:23
a.m. local time, high winds were still expected.  Winds yesterday reached 200 kilometers an hour, sending
houses and trees flying as people sought cover in evacuation
centers, New Zealand website  stuff.co.nz  reported. While there
was widespread damage to infrastructure and property, there were
no reported deaths or injuries, according to the site.  Fiji is a 332-island archipelago 3,240 kilometers northeast
of  Australia . The cyclone season in the South Pacific region
runs from November to April and storms sometime cause flooding
and landslides.  -- Editors: Tracy Withers,  Tim Smith   To contact the reporters on this story:
