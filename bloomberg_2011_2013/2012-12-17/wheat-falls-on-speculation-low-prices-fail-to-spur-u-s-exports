Wheat futures fell for the sixth
time in seven sessions on speculation that the lowest prices
since July have yet to spur demand for grain from the U.S., the
world’s biggest exporter.  “I don’t think the demand is there,” even after U.S.
wheat futures tumbled 5.5 percent last week and touched a five-
month low, Dewey Strickler, the president of Ag Watch Market
Advisers in Franklin,  Kentucky , said by telephone. “We don’t
have the tight situation in wheat that we have in corn.”  The U.S. Department of Agriculture raised its estimate of
global wheat reserves in a report on Dec. 11 and cut its demand
forecast. Government  inspections  of wheat for shipment overseas
from June 1 through Dec. 13 are down 13 percent from the same
period a year earlier, USDA data show.  Wheat futures for March delivery fell 1 percent to $8.0575
a bushel at 10:31 a.m. on the Chicago Board of Trade. The price
is down 6.7 percent this month, after touching $8.015 on Dec.
13, the lowest for a most-active contract since July 3.  In the U.S., wheat is the fourth-largest crop, valued at
$14.4 billion in 2011, behind corn, soybeans and hay, government
data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
