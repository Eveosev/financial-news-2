Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (TEVA) 
will start selling medicine in  South Korea  as it seeks to gain
access to a $14 billion drug market.  Teva will have a controlling stake of 51 percent in a
partnership with  Handok Pharmaceuticals Co. (002390) , the Petach Tikva,
Israel-based company said in a statement. The business venture
will allow Teva to market its multiple sclerosis treatment
Copaxone and so-called branded generics to a growing health-care
system in South Korea, Teva said. This is its first commercial
deal in East Asia outside Japan.  “Our business venture with Handok in Korea reinforces our
commitment to execute disciplined business development
transactions which support our growth plan, specifically in this
region,” Chief Executive Officer Jeremy Levin said in an e-
mailed statement to Bloomberg.  Levin is expanding in East Asia as he revamps the company.
Teva, which presented its long-term strategy to investors on
Dec. 11, is seeking new ways to grow as U.S. generic competition
intensifies and best-selling Copaxone faces competition from
oral drugs and patent protection loss in 2015. Teva is already
the third largest generic-drug maker in Japan, the world’s most
rapidly aging nation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
