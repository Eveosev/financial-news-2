Lindab International AB (LIAB) , a Swedish
maker of steel ventilation parts and building components, fell
to the lowest level in four months after saying weakening demand
had accelerated in the third quarter and continued in the
fourth.  “Fourth-quarter sales will also be affected by the harsher
winter weather conditions we are experiencing in December in
several markets, mainly affecting Building Components,” the
company said in a statement today. “For 2013 we expect a weak
start given the current market conditions.”  Lindab fell as much as 5.5 percent to 41.6 kronor, the
lowest price since Aug. 16. At 10:21 a.m. in Stockholm the stock
was down 4.9 percent in its seventh day of losses, valuing the
Baastad-based company at 3.29 billion kronor ($494 million).
Trading volume was more than half of the three-month daily
average.  The manufacturer had 74 percent of its sales in the Nordic
region and western  Europe  last year, according to its annual
report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
