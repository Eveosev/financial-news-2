 Crude options volatility fell as
the underlying futures rose on optimism that a U.S. budget
agreement will be reached.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
February, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a
gauge of options prices, was 25.69 percent on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange  as of 3:45 p.m., down from 26 percent on
Dec. 14.  February-delivery crude oil advanced 42 cents, or 0.5
percent, to settle at $87.67 a barrel on the Nymex.  Prices gained as House Speaker  John Boehner  proposed
raising tax rates on household incomes above $1 million a year
in exchange for containing entitlement program costs. Boehner
previously opposed higher rates for any income level. President
 Barack Obama , who wants increased rates to start at $250,000, is
considering a concession on Social Security cost-of-living
advances, according to two people familiar with the talks.  The most active options in electronic trading today were
February $75 puts, which slipped 2 cents to 23 cents a barrel on
volume of 4,297 lots at 3:55 p.m. February $80 puts were the
second-most active, with 3,226 lots exchanged as they declined
11 cents to 60 cents.  Bets that prices would fall, or puts, accounted for 57
percent of electronic trading volume.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on open-
outcry volume, where the bulk of options activity occurs.  In the previous session, bearish bets accounted for 53
percent of the 102,558 contracts traded.  February $70 puts were the most active options Dec. 14 with
6,734 contracts changing hands. They declined 2 cents to 8 cents
a barrel. February $78 puts fell 12 cents to 47 cents on 6,389
lots.  Open interest was highest for February $105 calls, with
31,773 contracts. Next were December 2013 $100 calls with 23,633
lots and December 2013 $150 calls with 23,335.  To contact the reporter on this story:
