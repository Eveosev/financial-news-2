$600 million of 4.05 percent, 30-year debentures at a relative
yield of 100 basis points, Bloomberg data show. The bonds traded
at 106.6 cents on the dollar to yield 3.68 percent, a spread of

price reporting system of the Financial Industry Regulatory
Authority.  The new bonds may be rated Aa3 by Moody’s Investors
Service, according to the person, who asked not to be identified
