Australia  will boost financial aid
and provide equipment to the Sri Lankan government to counter a
surge in people smuggling from the Asian nation, Foreign
Minister Bob Carr said.  Carr’s four-point plan, announced today in Colombo, will
see Australia provide  Sri Lanka ’s navy and intelligence service
with extra surveillance and electronic equipment, training, and
A$45 million ($47 million) in aid over five years to reduce
poverty, Carr said in an e-mailed statement. Australia will also
spend A$700,000 in advertisements to deter potential asylum
seekers, he said.  At least 1,000 asylum seekers, often from war-torn Middle
Eastern and South Asian nations, are known to have drowned in
the waters between Indonesia and Australia since 2001. The issue
has become politically damaging for the government of Prime
Minister  Julia Gillard , who has been forced to open off-shore
processing centers as well as resettling some refugees in
Australian cities.  Cooperation between the Sri Lanka and Australian
governments has resulted in the disruption of 65 smuggling
ventures involving 2,900 people this year, and since August the
involuntary return of more than 700 Sri Lankans, Carr said.  Australia shepherded laws through parliament on Aug. 17 to
allow refugees to be processed on the South Pacific island
nation of Nauru and in  Papua New Guinea  in a bid to deter asylum
seekers from paying Indonesian smugglers to ferry them in
overcrowded boats to Australia. Sri Lankan people smugglers
often sail directly from the island nation into Australian
waters.  To contact the reporter on this story:
