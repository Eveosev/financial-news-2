Centamin Plc (CEY)  had its biggest two-day
gain on record in  London  trading after saying normal operations
would resume within days at its Sukari mine in  Egypt  after a
dispute over diesel supplies that halted operations.  Centamin advanced as much as 29 percent, adding to a 25
percent jump on the last trading day on Dec. 14. The company
said today that it expects fuel supplies and normal operations
to restart in “coming days.” A halt by customs on the mine’s
gold exports has also ended and a shipment was made yesterday.  The producer has been in dispute with state-run Egyptian
General Petroleum Corp., which is claiming $65 million in back
payments for subsidised diesel supplied from December 2009 to
January 2012. The dispute is now in court, said Andy Davidson,
Centamin’s investor relations manager, by phone last week.  The company, based in Mount Pleasant,  Australia , has been
dogged by operational and political delays in Egypt since last
year’s political uprising in the country. Centamin fell as much
as 59 percent Oct. 30 after Egypt’s administrative court issued
a preliminary ruling to annul an 18-year-old concession accord
with the government. Its joint-venture partner, the state-owned
Mineral Resources Authority, said it would appeal the decision.  The gold producer also temporarily halted mining in March
and July because of labor unrest related to a pay dispute.  It rose 26 percent to 43.55 pence by 9:12 a.m. in London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
