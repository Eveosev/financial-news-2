Nigeria ’s naira slipped to its
weakest in a month as investors increased demand for dollars
amid accelerating inflation.  The currency of  Africa ’s biggest oil producer retreated 0.3
percent to 158.075 per dollar as of 3:10 p.m. in Lagos, the
commercial capital, its weakest since Nov. 16. The naira has
gained 2.7 percent this year, the second-best performing
currency in Africa, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Companies have increased demand for foreign-currency after
the  Central Bank of Nigeria  said it will end dollar sales to
lenders at twice-weekly auctions on Dec. 19 and resume on Jan.
7, according to Tunde Ladipo, chief executive officer of Lagos-
based Valuechain Investment Ltd.  “Dealers speculate dollar supply won’t be enough to meet
demand during the festive season as auctions end,” he said by
phone today.  The central bank sold $200 million at an auction today,
compared with $180 million on Dec. 12, it said in e-mailed
statement. The next sale scheduled for Dec. 19 will be the last
for the year, it said on Dec. 14.  Nigeria’s  inflation  rate rose for the second consecutive
month in November to 12.3 percent from 11.7 percent, the
 National Bureau of Statistics  said today in an e-mailed report.
The central bank left its benchmark  interest rate  unchanged at
12 percent this year to control inflation and stabilize the
naira.  “Inflation picked up in November, moderately exceeding our
11.6 percent forecast,”  Samir Gadio , an emerging-markets
strategist at Standard Bank Group Ltd. in  London , said in an e-
mailed reply to questions. “This uptick in inflation will also
make it more difficult for the CBN to start easing monetary
policy at its January meeting.”  Yields on 10-year naira debt fell three basis points to
11.85 percent, according to Dec. 14 prices compiled on the
Financial Markets Dealers Association website. Borrowing costs
on the nation’s $500 million of Eurobonds due January 2021 fell
two basis points to 4.114 percent today.  Ghana ’s cedi declined for a second day by 0.1 percent to
1.8935 per dollar in Accra, the capital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
