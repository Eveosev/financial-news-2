Olympic downhill champion  Lindsey Vonn  says she is taking a break from World Cup skiing to regain
strength after being hospitalized last month with a stomach
infection.  “After talking with my family and consulting with my
coaches and trainers, I have decided to take a break from the
World Cup circuit,” Vonn said in a  statement  posted on
Facebook. “Since my intestinal infection last month, I have
been struggling with my energy and strength. I believe that some
time off the mountain will help me regain the physical strength
that I require to compete at the level that I demand from
myself.”  Vonn, a 28-year-old American, did not say when she would
return to the sport. She competes in all Alpine skiing
disciplines, excelling in the speed events of downhill and
super-G. The next World Cup downhill and super-G races are Jan.
12-13 in St. Anton,  Austria .  A four-time overall World Cup champion, Vonn is fourth in
the overall standings this season behind Tina Maze of Slovenia,
Maria Hoefl-Riesch of Germany and Kathrin Zettel of Austria.
Vonn leads the downhill standings, which she has won the last
five seasons, over fellow American Stacey Cook.  Vonn was hospitalized in  Colorado  for three days with
severe intestinal pain. Following her recovery, she won two
downhill races and two super-G events.  To contact the reporter on this story:
