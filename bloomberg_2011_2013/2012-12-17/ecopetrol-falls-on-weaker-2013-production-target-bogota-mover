Ecopetrol SA (ECOPETL) ,  Colombia ’s largest oil
company, fell after announcing a 2013 production target that
trailed some analysts’ estimates, after licensing delays and
guerrilla attacks hampered output gains this year.  Ecopetrol will produce the equivalent of 798,000 barrels of
oil a day next year, according to a  filing on Dec. 14  after the
stock market closed. The company had said in late 2011 that it
planned to produce 800,000 barrels a day this year, before
cutting the estimate in July to 780,000 barrels a day.  “The 2013 guidance falls short of our expectations,” Itau
BBA SA analysts Paula Kovarsky and Diego Mendes said in a note
to clients today. The company’s 2015 goal of 1 million barrels a
day now seems “even more difficult to achieve,” said Kovarsky,
who expects Ecopetrol to pump about 755,000 barrels a day this
year.  The shares  fell  0.4 percent to 5,320 pesos at 11:48 a.m. in
Bogota, after earlier falling as much 0.7 percent, the most in
almost two weeks. Ecopetrol was the most heavily traded stock on
the Colombian exchange. The country’s benchmark IGBC index
climbed 0.2 percent.  Ecopetrol, 88.5 percent-owned by the Colombian government,
plans to invest $9.5 billion next year, according to a
regulatory filing on Dec. 14.  The company’s output through nine months of this year
averaged 750,100 barrels a day, according to an October filing.
That compared with 716,400 barrels a day during the same period
of 2011.  To contact the reporters on this story:
