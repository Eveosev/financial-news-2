Carrefour SA (CA) , the world’s second
largest retailer, will be fined after local inspectors found a
store in northern China had charged consumers incorrect prices,
Xinhua News Agency reported.  Carrefour will receive a fine of 50,000  yuan  ($8,000) to
500,000 yuan, Xinhua reported yesterday, citing Song Jianhu, an
official of the pricing bureau in Taiyuan, a city capital of
Shanxi province. Dai Wei, vice president of Carrefour China, has
agreed to accept punishment from the bureau, Xinhua cited Song
as saying.  Carrefour has been in contact with the Taiyuan price bureau
on how the matter will be handled and will continue to cooperate
with the department, Liu Huanyu, a spokeswoman for Blue Focus,
Carrefour’s external press relations agency in  China  said. “It
hasn’t been decided whether there will be a fine,” she said.  A consumer complained to regional authorities after
noticing a discrepancy between the price displayed on the shelf
and that charged by the cashier at the Carrefour outlet, Xinhua
said. Carrefour last week said it apologized for the error,
which was an individual case and an “unintentional working
mistake.”  The Taiyuan outlet was also found to have used misleading
advertising, failed to provide accurate information regarding
sales and allowed goods to be produced in areas that were
inconsistent with the company’s specifications, Xinhua reported
today.  Carrefour sent a team to check the store and to make sure
it follows company processes, the retailer said in last week’s
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
