The Chilean peso weakened following
two weeks of gains as copper, the countryâ€™s main export, fell.  The peso dropped 0.1 percent to 474.34 per  U.S. dollar  at
10:44 a.m. in Santiago after earlier rising as much as 0.2
percent.  Copper retreated as much as 0.8 percent in  New York  as
stockpiles monitored by the London Metal Exchange jumped the
most in more than four years, creating concern that demand for
the metal will remain weak.  To contact the reporter on this story:
