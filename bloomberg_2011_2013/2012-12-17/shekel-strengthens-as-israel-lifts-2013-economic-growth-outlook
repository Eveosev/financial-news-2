Israel ’s shekel strengthened for a
second day and  government bonds  fell after the country’s  Finance
Ministry  raised its 2013 growth forecast for the economy,
boosting investor demand for riskier assets.  The shekel rose 0.2 percent to 3.7834 a dollar at 4:41 p.m.
in Tel Aviv, the sixth-best performer among an expanded list of
31 major currencies tracked by Bloomberg. The currency gained
0.9 percent this month. The yield on the 5.5 percent benchmark
bonds due January 2022 increased for the first time since Dec.
4, adding one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 3.71
percent.  Israel’s economy may expand 3.5 percent next year, the
Finance Ministry said yesterday, revising an earlier forecast of
3 percent to include the effect of natural gas discoveries, with
the offshore Tamar field set to start production by the second
quarter next year. Israel posted a current account surplus in
the third quarter, its first in a year, as imports declined, the
 Central Bureau of Statistics  said yesterday.  “The growth update and the current account surplus are
providing further support for shekel strength,” said Rony Gitlin, head of spot trading at Bank Leumi Le-Israel Ltd. in Tel
Aviv. “We may see the start of the domestic gas flow positively
impact the shekel in the coming year.”  The Finance Ministry today sold a combined 1.45 billion
shekels ($383 million) of bonds at the final government auction
this year, government data posted on Bloomberg show. Investors
sought 3.7 times the 250 million shekels of 2018 notes on sale
compared with 4.4 times at the previous sale on Dec. 10. The
yield on the 2018 bonds jumped five basis points to 2.79
percent.  The two-year break-even rate, the yield difference between
the inflation-linked bonds and fixed-rate government notes of
similar maturity, retreated five basis points to 206, implying
an average annual inflation rate of 2.06 percent over the
period.  The Tel-Bond 40 Index of corporate bonds dropped for a
fourth day, declining 0.1 percent to 279.88. One-year  interest-
rate swaps , an indicator of investor expectations for rates over
the period, slumped seven basis points to 1.71 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
