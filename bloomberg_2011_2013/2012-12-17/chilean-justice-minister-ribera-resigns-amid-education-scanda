Chile ’s Justice Minister Teodoro Ribera resigned today amid allegations he has ties to a former
director of the country’s accreditation committee, or CNA, which
improperly authorized some universities to operate.  Ribera, who in 2011 replaced Felipe Bulnes when he moved to
the Education Ministry, announced his resignation on live
television today. A member of President Sebastian Pinera’s
National Renewal Party, Ribera previously was rector of Chile’s
Autonomous University.  Ribera is accused of having ties to former CNA Director
Luis Eugenio Diaz, who is under investigation for bribery and
allegedly using Ribera to try to get a family member admitted to
the Autonomous University. Ribera today denied allegations of
wrongdoing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
