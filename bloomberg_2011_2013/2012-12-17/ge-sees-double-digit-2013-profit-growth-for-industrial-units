General Electric Co. (GE)  forecast profit
from its industrial segments will increase by “double digit”
percentages next year, while growth slows at the  GE Capital 
Corp. unit.  Total revenue will be little changed to a 5 percent
increase for 2013, GE told investors and analysts at a
presentation today in New York. Industrial sales excluding
acquisitions are expected to grow by 2 percent to 6 percent,
versus a 2012 outlook of about 8 percent, the company said.  Chief Executive Officer  Jeffrey Immelt  is seeking to expand
profit margins at the Fairfield, Connecticut-based company’s
industrial units while shrinking its financial operations. GE
said today that the industrial units will increase to 65 percent
of earnings in 2015 from about 55 percent now, as GE Capital
trims assets and speeds up cash transfers to the parent.  Immelt has focused on  units  that make  jet engines , medical
scanners and diesel locomotives after the finance unit suffered
$32 billion of credit losses and received capital infusions from
its parent during the financial crisis.  GE rose 1.4 percent to $21.93 at the close in New York. The
 shares  have gained 22 percent this year.  The company forecast that industrial profit margins will
expand by about 0.7 percentage point next year. GE also said it
plans to return about $12 billion to shareholders in 2013.  Adjusted earnings at GE may climb to $1.69 a share next
year, from $1.51 this year, based on the averages of 16
analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
