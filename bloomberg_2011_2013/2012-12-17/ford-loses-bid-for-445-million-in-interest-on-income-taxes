Ford Motor Co. (F)  can’t collect $445
million in interest on overpayment of income taxes, an appeals
court ruled, saying the Internal Revenue Service didn’t
improperly calculate what the company was owed.  Ford sued the U.S. in 2008, claiming that the government
shortchanged the auto company on interest accrued on overpayment
of corporate income taxes from 1983 to 1989 and in 1992 and 1994.
A federal judge in  Detroit  rejected Ford’s claim in 2010,
agreeing with the government that the U.S. had correctly
calculated the interest Ford was due on the overpayment.  Ford asked the  U.S. Court of Appeals  in Cincinnati to
overturn the decision, contending that U.S. revenue procedure
required interest to accrue from the time the company deposited
money with the  Internal Revenue Service . The appeals court today
ruled that revenue procedure couldn’t be used to support the
company’s argument.  “We are unwilling to place so much weight upon an
interpretive aid that binds neither IRS nor this court,” U.S.
Circuit Judge Julia Smith Gibbons wrote. The procedure cited
“does not even enjoy the status of an agency regulation,” she
said.  Jay Cooney, Ford spokesman, declined to comment immediately
on the court’s decision.  The case is Ford Motor Co. v U.S., 10-1934, U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Sixth Circuit (Cincinnati).  To contact the reporter on this story:
