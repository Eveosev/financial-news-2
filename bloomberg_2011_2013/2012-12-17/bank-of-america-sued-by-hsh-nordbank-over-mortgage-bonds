Bank of America Corp. , the second-
biggest U.S. lender by assets, was sued by German regional
lender HSH Nordbank AG over more than $218 million in
residential mortgage-backed securities.  The Hamburg-based bank sued Bank of America in  New York 
State Supreme Court in  Manhattan  on Dec. 14, accusing the
company and its Countrywide unit of making “misrepresentations
and omissions” about the underwriting standards for  mortgage
loans  that were pooled together into the securities.  Lawrence Grayson, a spokesman for Charlotte, North
Carolina-based Bank of America, declined to comment on the
lawsuit in an e-mail.  HSH Nordbank is one of a group of regional German lenders
that have sued over mortgage-backed securities in New York
during the past year. HSH Nordbank filed a similar suit against
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Morgan Stanley in August.  Pools of home loans securitized into bonds were a central
part of the housing bubble that helped send the U.S. into the
biggest recession since the 1930s. The housing market collapsed,
and the crisis swept up lenders and investment banks as the
market for the securities evaporated.  The case is HSH Nordbank AG v.  Bank of America Corp. (BAC) ,
654382/2012, New York State Supreme Court, New York County
(Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
