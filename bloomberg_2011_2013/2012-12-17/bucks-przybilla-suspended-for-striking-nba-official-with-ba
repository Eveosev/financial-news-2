Joel Przybilla of the Milwaukee
Bucks was suspended one game by the  National Basketball
Association  for throwing a basketball that hit a referee.  The incident occurred with one minute, 36 seconds left in
Milwaukee’s 111-85 loss to the Los Angeles Clippers two days
ago. After a foul, Przybilla lobbed a ball over several players
to a referee who had his back turned,  striking the official  in
the leg. Przybilla received a technical foul.  The 7-foot-1 Przybilla, a backup center, will sit out
tomorrow’s game when the Bucks host the Indiana Pacers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
