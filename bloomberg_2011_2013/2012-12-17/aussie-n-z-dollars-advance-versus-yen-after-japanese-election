The Australian and  New Zealand 
dollars gained against the yen after Japan’s main opposition
party reclaimed power in Dec. 16 elections on pledges of
increased monetary stimulus.  The Aussie rose to its highest level since May 2011 before
the  Reserve Bank  of Australia releases minutes from this month’s
meeting when  interest rates  were reduced. New Zealand’s dollar
touched a four-year high versus the Japanese currency on
prospects the election will add to pressure on the  Bank of Japan (8301) 
to expand easing as early as this week.  At its last meeting, the RBA “expressed concerns about the
outlook for global growth, but maintained a neutral tone,
providing no hints about their bias to ease again next year,”
 Kathy Lien , managing director of foreign exchange at BK Asset
Management, an investment advisory firm in New York, wrote today
in a note to clients. “Investors will be looking to the minutes
for confirmation of the central bank’s bias to ease.”  Australia’s currency appreciated 0.3 percent to 88.52 yen
yesterday in New York after earlier touching 89.13. It declined
0.1 percent to $1.0552.  The New Zealand dollar, nicknamed the kiwi, increased 0.3
percent to 70.88 yen. The kiwi fell 0.2 percent to 84.50 U.S.
cents.  The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Index of raw materials was
little changed and crude-oil futures rose 0.9 percent to $87.49
per barrel in New York. The  S&P 500 Index (SPX)  gained 1.2 percent.  New Zealand’s dollar has strengthened 6.3 percent this
year, the biggest increase among the 10 developed-nation
currencies monitored by the Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted
Indexes, and the Aussie has gained 0.5 percent. The U.S. dollar
has fallen 3.1 percent and the yen has dropped 12 percent to
lead decliners.  To contact the reporter on this story:
