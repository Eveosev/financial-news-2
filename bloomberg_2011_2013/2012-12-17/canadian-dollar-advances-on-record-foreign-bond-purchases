The Canadian dollar gained against
its U.S. counterpart as foreign purchases of Canadian bonds
reached a 10-year high.  Canada’s currency erased losses earlier today as foreign
investors bought a net C$13.3 billion ($13.4 billion) of
Canadian securities in October, led by purchases of bonds, the
federal statistics agency said, the fourth straight month of net
investment. The currency rose with oil and stocks as President
 Barack Obama  and House Speaker  John Boehner  met at the White
House for budget talks. The Canadian dollar strengthened to a
19-month high against the yen after Japan’s  Liberal Democratic
Party  returned to power on calls for more monetary easing.  “Since we’ve come in the North American session, we’ve
seen Canada start to claw back, whether it’s straight
dollar/Canada or cross-related moves,” Matthew Perrier,
director of foreign exchange at  Bank of Montreal (BMO)  by phone from
Toronto. “Anyway you slice it, Canada’s done a little bit
better.”  The loonie, as the Canadian currency is known for the image
of the aquatic bird on the C$1 coin, increased 0.1 percent to
98.44 cents at 12:19 p.m. in Toronto. One Canadian dollar buys
$1.0159. Canada’s dollar advanced 0.4 percent to 85.05 yen after
earlier touching 85.62 yen, it’s highest since May 2011.  Futures of crude oil, Canada’s biggest export, rose 0.9
percent to $87.44 a barrel in New York. The  Standard & Poor’s 
500 index of U.S. stocks rose 0.9 percent.  Debt Buying  Canada’s  government bonds  fell, with benchmark 10-year
bonds yields rising three basis points, or 0.03 percentage
point, to 1.82 percent. The 2.75 percent security due June 2022
fell 25 cents to C$108.08.  Nonresidents bought C$8.15 billion of Canadian government
bonds and C$8.93 of private corporate debt -- the largest
investment in more than 10 years -- while divesting of C$2.97
billion of money-market paper,  Statistics Canada  said today in
Ottawa. Foreigners purchased a net C$745 million of the
country’s stocks, led by shares of oil and gas companies.  Gains in the loonie were tempered as  existing home sales  in
fell 1.7 percent in November from the previous month, according
to the  Canadian Real Estate Association . Sales were down 11.9
percent from a year earlier.  The government tightened mortgage rules in July while the
banking regulator introduced tougher standards on mortgage
lenders in an attempt to prevent a housing bubble forming in
some markets.  ‘Unlimited Easing’  Obama and Boehner met for about 45 minutes, said Boehner
spokesman  Michael Steel  in an e-mailed statement. The aide gave
no further details, nor did the White House, as the two try to
avoiding more than $600 billion in tax increases and spending
cuts, the so-called fiscal cliff, that will start taking effect
in January.  Canada’s currency rose against the yen as Japan’s LDP won
294 seats in the 480-member lower house, setting the stage for
Shinzo Abe to become Prime Minister with economic policies that
include “unlimited easing” by the  Bank of Japan (8301)  to reach a 2
percent inflation target and increased public-works spending.  “Unlimited easing is not going to be good” for the yen,
said  John Curran , senior vice president at Canadian Forex Ltd.,
an online foreign exchange dealer. “It should weaken the
currency.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
