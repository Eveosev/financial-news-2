Uganda  ruled out including
executions in a bill seeking to impose harsher penalties on
homosexual acts, said Ethics and Integrity Minister Simon
Lokodo.  The East African nation dropped the death penalty because
it is about to ratify a United Nations convention against
executions, he said by phone from Kampala, the capital.
President  Yoweri Museveni  rejected using capital punishment to
curb homosexuality, the state-owned New Vision newspaper
reported today.  “We have ruled out the death penalty, but there is a life
sentence for aggravated homosexuality,” Lokodo said. The bill
will be tabled for discussion by lawmakers in the first week of
February, he said.  Lawmaker David Bahati in February reintroduced a bill,
which was first drafted in 2009, seeking to increase the maximum
penalties for homosexual behavior, which is illegal in Uganda.  To contact the reporter on this story:
