The  European Central Bank  is set to
directly supervise about 150 banks, accounting for approximately
80 percent of the euro area’s banking assets, according to
tentative estimates given by a European Union official.  The percentage of banking assets subject to direct ECB
supervision will be highest in nations with highly concentrated
banking industries such as the Netherlands, said the official
who isn’t authorized to be identified, in line with EU policy.  The ECB will take on bank oversight duties by March 2014,
or whenever the central bank says it is ready, under an accord
reached by finance ministers last week.  The final figures on banks that will face direct ECB
oversight will need to be calculated by the Frankfurt-based
bank, the official said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
