Sugar rose to the highest in more
than a week in New York as lower prices may spur buying after
investors boosted bets on falling prices. Cocoa fell.  Large and small investors excluding index funds were net-
short, or betting on lower prices, by a record 76,700 contracts
in the week ended Dec. 11,  data  from the U.S. Commodity Futures
Trading Commission showed. Sugar declined 18 percent this year
as supplies will outpace demand for a third year in 2012-13.  “The report has to be considered bullish,” Michael McDougall, head of the Brazil desk at Newedge Group in New York,
said by e-mail on Dec. 14, referring to trader holdings data
released after the market close that day. “I don’t think anyone
was expecting the old record to be comprehensively blown out.”  Raw sugar for March delivery gained 0.8 percent to 19.16
cents a pound by 7:46 a.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in New York. It
reached 19.30 cents in earlier trading, the highest since Dec.
7. White, or refined, sugar for March delivery rose 0.8 percent
at $512.70 a ton on NYSE Liffe in London. It’s lost 15 percent
this year.  “The index funds increased their gross long by almost
10,000 lots, presumably because the market had fallen low enough
to attract value buying or low enough relative to other
commodities,” McDougall said.  Index funds are set to buy another 30,000 futures in early
to mid-January as the Dow Jones-UBS Commodity Index and the
Standard & Poor’s GSCI gauge make their annual changes to
weightings of raw materials, Paul Bannister, head of sugar
brokerage at Marex Spectron Group, said in a report today.  Sugar Output  The sugar surplus will be 5.1 million tons in 2012-13 due
partly to a stronger-than-forecast output in  Brazil , according
to Barclays Plc. Sugar output in the country’s main growing
region will near 34 million tons, Marex Spectron estimates. That
compares with 31.3 million tons in 2011-12.  Cocoa for March delivery was little changed at $2,434 a ton
on ICE. The chocolate ingredient has gained 15 percent this
year. Cocoa for March delivery fell 0.7 percent to 1,535 pounds
($2,488) a ton on NYSE Liffe, still up 11 percent this year.  Arabica coffee for March delivery was up 0.3 percent to
$1.436 a pound in New York. It’s fallen 37 percent this year.
