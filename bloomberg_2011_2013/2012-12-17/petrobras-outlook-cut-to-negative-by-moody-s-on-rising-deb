Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4) ,  Brazil ’s
state-controlled oil company, had the outlook on its foreign
currency bonds revised to negative from stable by Moody’s
Investors Service, according to a statement from the ratings
company.  The cut in the outlook for the Rio de Janeiro-based company
known as Petrobras, “reflects the company’s rising debt
levels,” Moody’s said. “We also see increasing linkage between
Petrobras and the sovereign,” according to the statement
yesterday.  The oil producer has lost a record $8 billion at its
refining unit this year as Brazilian President  Dilma Rousseff ’s
battle with inflation means the state-run company must sell
imported gasoline below cost. Petrobras posted an unexpected
loss in the second quarter, followed by a drop in profit in the
third quarter that surprised analysts.  Moody’s said its decision was also based on the
“uncertainty over the timing and delivery of production.”  Calls to Petrobras press office after regular business
hours were not immediately returned.  Petrobras is heading for its first yearly output drop since
2004 as fields in the Campos basin off the coast of Rio de
Janeiro state decline faster than the company expected.  To contact the reporter on this story:
