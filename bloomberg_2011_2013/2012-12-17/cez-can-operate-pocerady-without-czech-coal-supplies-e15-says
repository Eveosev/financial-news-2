CEZ AS (CEZ) , the largest Czech producer
of electricity, can operate its Pocerady power plant without
supplies from Czech Coal AS if the two companies won’t agree on
the price of coal supply by the end of the year, E15 reported
citing CEZ board member Vladimir Hlavinka.  CEZ can use coal from its own mines located further away
from the plant and run only 3 out of Pocerady’s 5 200 megawatt
units, the newspaper said, citing Hlavinka.  To contact the reporter on this story:
