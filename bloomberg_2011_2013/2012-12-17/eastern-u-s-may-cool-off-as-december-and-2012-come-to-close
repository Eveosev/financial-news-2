The eastern U.S. is expected to cool
in the last half of December after warmer than normal
temperatures dominate the region this week.  Temperatures may be 8 degrees Fahrenheit (4 Celsius) higher
than usual from the Midwest to the Northeast this week, said
 Matt Rogers , president of Commodity Weather Group LLC in
Bethesda,  Maryland . Colder air will arrive in the East starting
this weekend and may persist through the end of the month.  “The details are still murky, but it looks like a cold
push drops through the mid-continent” late in the Dec. 22 to
Dec. 26 period, Rogers said today in a note to clients.  Colder-than-normal weather in the high-population areas of
the Northeast and the large cities of the Midwest increases
energy use for heating, which may push up natural gas and
heating oil prices. The period from November to March is when
the most fuel is used for heating in the U.S.  Rogers said temperatures may drop about 3 to 5 degrees
below normal across the Midwest and South from Dec. 27 to Dec.
31. In the Northeast, temperatures will be seasonal.  MDA Weather Services disagreed, predicting temperatures
across the eastern U.S. will remain seasonal through year’s end.
The Pacific Northwest and  California  may be 3 to 4 degrees
cooler in the same period.  In  New York , the normal average temperature for Dec. 25 is
about 36 degrees, according to MDA in Gaithersburg, Maryland. It
is 32 in  Boston ; 25 in Chicago; 32 in  St. Louis ; 53 in Houston;
19 in Calgary, Alberta; 35 in Seattle; and 49 in Burbank,
California, according to MDA.  To contact the reporter on this story:
