Ivory Coast expects to produce
300,000 metric tons of rubber in 2013 as it plans to raise funds
for developing new production zones of the crop.  Output this year was lower than expected, at 230,000 tons
from a forecast of 250,000 tons, Albert Konan, executive
secretary of the Rubber Development Fund, said in a phone
interview from the commercial capital, Abidjan. He didn’t give a
reason for the missed target.  In 2013, the fund plans to sponsor 5,000 rubber farmers and
create new plantations spanning about 20,000 hectares (49,421
acres) in the West African nation, Konan said.  The fund, which is managed by the national natural rubber
trade association  Apromac , seeks to boost production to 600,000
tons by 2020 if it can attract donor funds to finance its
expansion plans, he said.  Natural rubber produces its crop year-round while cocoa is
harvested twice a year. Ivory Coast is the world’s biggest
grower of the chocolate ingredient.  To contact the reporters on this story:
