Elliott Management Corp., the
activist investor that  owns  8 percent of  Compuware Corp. (CPWR) ,
offered to buy the Detroit-based software company for $2.3
billion, saying it has “underperformed.”  The bid of $11 a share is a 15 percent premium over the
company’s closing price of $9.53 on Dec. 14. Elliott, the $20
billion New York-based hedge fund founded by billionaire  Paul Singer , said it is “confident” that it can obtain financing
for the deal, according to a statement today.  In a letter to Compuware today, Elliott said the software
company’s “execution, profitability and growth have
meaningfully underperformed.” Elliott said it’s prepared to
meet with Compuware immediately to discuss a transaction.  Compuware, which provides infrastructure software,  rose  13
percent to $10.76 today in New York, the biggest jump in more
than four years. The stock has climbed 29 percent in 2012.  The company’s board “will review all aspects of the
proposal in consultation with its financial and legal advisers
in due course,” according to a statement today.  Elliott reported a 5.7 percent stake in Compuware in a 13D
filing on Nov. 26, gaining an opening to agitate for change at
the company.  Elliott made an unsolicited $2 billion offer for Novell
Inc. in 2010 after building an 8.5 percent stake in the Linux
software maker. Novell was bought last year by Attachmate Corp.
for $2.2 billion.  Elliott’s Investments  More recently, Elliott pressed BMC Software Inc. for
several months to consider a sale, resulting in a $1 billion
share buyback announced Oct. 31. The activist investor amassed a
stake in Brocade Communications Systems Inc. as of August 2011,
and a year later Chief Executive Officer Michael Klayko said he
would step down after trying to sell the company for more than
two years.  Sales at Compuware are projected to fall about 2.7 percent
to $982.1 million in 2013, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The company’s products include mainframe
applications, collaboration technology, project management
tools, and application performance management services for cloud
and mobile applications.  To contact the reporter on this story:
