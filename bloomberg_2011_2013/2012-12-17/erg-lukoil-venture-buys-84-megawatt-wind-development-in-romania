Lukerg Renew, a venture between
Italy’s  ERG SpA (ERG)  and Russia’s OAO Lukoil, bought an 84-megawatt
wind development in  Romania  from Santarelli Costruzioni SpA that
will cost 135 million euros ($178 million) to build.  Lukerg Renew plans to start construction at the site in the
Tulcea region early next year with commercial operation in the
first half of 2014, Milan-based ERG said in a statement. Terms
weren’t disclosed.  The company plans to fund the project with a long-term loan
from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development,
currently undertaking due diligence. The loan will be non-
recourse, where the lender can recoup payments from the
venture’s profits.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
