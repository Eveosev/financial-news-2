U.S.  stocks  rose, giving the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index its biggest gain in about a month,
as investors weighed prospects for a budget deal in Washington.  All 10 groups in the  S&P 500 (SPX)  rose as financial companies
gained the most, adding 2.1 percent.  American International
Group Inc. (AIG)  climbed 3 percent on plans to sell as much as $6.5
billion of AIA Group Ltd. shares. Hartford Financial Services
Group Inc. jumped 3.6 percent as Sun Life Financial Inc.’s deal
to sell a U.S. annuity unit raised the prospect for the insurer
seeking to sell a similar business.  Tenet (THC)  Healthcare Corp. rose
1.8 percent as Deutsche Bank AG upgraded the hospital chain.  The S&P 500 added 1.2 percent to 1,430.36 at 4 p.m. in New
York. The measure capped its biggest gain since Nov. 23. The  Dow
Jones Industrial Average  rose 100.38 points, or 0.8 percent, to
13,235.39. About 6.3 billion shares changed hands on U.S.
exchanges, 2.3 percent above the three-month average.  “It’s a historic tug of war: pulling on one side is the
fiscal cliff, pulling the other side is continued global
monetary easing,”  David Sowerby , a portfolio manager at Boston-
based Loomis Sayles & Co., said in a telephone interview. His
firm oversees about $175 billion. “The most positive thing for
the market is valuation and an accommodative Fed policy.”  The equity benchmark has lost 0.7 percent so far this
quarter as President  Barack Obama  and  House Republicans  differed
over how to avoid automatic deficit-reduction measures. The
 Federal Reserve  said last week that it will buy $45 billion a
month of  Treasury securities  starting in January to help boost
growth, in addition to $40 billion a month of mortgage-debt
purchases under a previous plan.  Budget Deal  The S&P 500 is trading at 14.6 times reported earnings,
compared with the average of 16.4 since 1954, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. The benchmark is up 14 percent this year.  Obama and House Speaker  John Boehner  met for about 45
minutes at the White House today with two weeks remaining to
avert more than $600 billion in spending cuts and tax increases
set to start in January. The  Congressional Budget Office  has
said a failure to avoid the so-called fiscal cliff may lead to a
recession in the first half of 2013.  Obama is considering a possible budget concession on Social
Security cost-of-living increases after Boehner dropped his
opposition to raising tax rates for some top earners, said two
people familiar with the talks. Senate Majority Leader  Harry
Reid , a Nevada Democrat, said today it appears the chamber will
need to reconvene Dec. 26 to work on the budget.  Manufacturing in the New York region shrank more than
forecast in December, showing weakness in the industry is
persisting as the year draws to a close.  Japan Politics  In Japan, the Nikkei 225 Stock Average rose to the highest
in eight months after the  Liberal Democratic Party  returned to
power on a campaign for more economic stimulus and the doubling
of the nation’s inflation goal.  AIG climbed 3 percent to $34.95. The insurer plans to sell
out of AIA Group, exiting the business from which it was formed
in Shanghai in 1919. AIG is selling about 1.65 billion shares in
Hong Kong-headquartered AIA at HK$29.65 to HK$30.65 each,
according to a term sheet obtained by  Bloomberg News .  Hartford advanced 3.6 percent to $22.05. Sun Life struck a
deal to sell its U.S. annuity business to a firm owned by
Guggenheim Partners LLC shareholders for $1.35 billion.  The Guggenheim deal shows “there are potential buyers out
there for these troubled books of business, which could open up
opportunities for Hartford,” said  Randy Binner , an analyst at
FBR Capital Markets, in a note to investors today.  ‘Stand Out’  Tenet climbed 1.8 percent to $31.18. The hospital chain was
raised to buy from hold by Deutsche Bank, which said the
company’s 2013 growth will “stand out.”  Compuware Corp. (CPWR)  surged 13 percent to $10.76. Elliott
Management Corp., which owns 8 percent of the software maker,
offered to acquire the company for $2.3 billion, or $11 a share.  An index of homebuilders rallied 4.5 percent, the most
since Oct. 3, as all its 11 members gained. A Wells Fargo & Co.
monthly survey of homebuilding sales managers showed that 1
percent of respondents lowered prices in November, the fewest in
seven years. Lennar Corp. climbed 4 percent to $38.80. D.R.
Horton Inc. added 5.1 percent to $19.69 while PulteGroup Inc.
gained 5.3 percent to $18.04.  Gun Control  Smith & Wesson Holding Corp. led a decline in stocks of
firearms makers amid talks about  gun control  following last
week’s elementary school shooting that left 20 children dead.
Smith & Wesson dropped 5.2 percent to $8.66, after a 4.3 percent
loss on Dec. 14. Sturm Ruger & Co. slipped 3.5 percent to $44.  J.C. Penney Co. fell 1.6 percent to $20.64, ending a seven-
day, 20 percent gain. The department-store company is “resuming
a more aggressive promotional stance” to boost store traffic,
said Brian Nagel, an analyst with Oppenheimer & Co. While the
strategy may help strengthen its cash holdings, the recent stock
rebound might not prove sustainable, Nagel said in a note today.  Clearwire Corp. (CLWR)  slumped 14 percent to $2.91. The company’s
board agreed to a sweetened, $2.97-a-share takeover bid from its
wireless partner Sprint Nextel Corp., which is now offering $2.2
billion to acquire the portion of Clearwire it doesn’t already
own. Shares of money-losing Clearwire jumped above $3 last week
after Sprint made an initial $2.90-a-share offer, a sign that
investors were anticipating a higher bid.  CEO Pessimism  The U.S. budget debate is holding stocks hostage, as chief
executive officers prepare to cut  capital spending  for the first
time since 2009 should President Obama and Congress fail to
reach an accord.  Expenditures by  S&P 500  companies will fall 1.3 percent in
2013 after three years of growth, according to more than 10,000
analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Companies from Verizon
Communications Inc. to Rockwell Collins Inc. said they don’t
plan to boost investment amid concern political leaders will
fail to agree on a plan to avert the fiscal cliff.  Bears say CEO pessimism will sap the rally and note that
the last time capital spending declined was at the end of 2008,
just before stocks slumped to a 12-year low. Bulls point out
that estimates for corporate spending show any decline will be
limited and say the improving U.S. economy will lift equity
valuations, now 12 percent below the 58-year average, Bloomberg
data show.  “In an environment where the economic and political
outlook is highly uncertain, it is hard for executives to make
investment decisions,” Abi Oladimeji, who helps oversee $4.3
billion as head of investment strategy at Thomas Miller
Investment Ltd. in London, said in a telephone interview on Dec.
12. “The danger is that we see policy errors, which could
undermine equity markets and the broader economy.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
