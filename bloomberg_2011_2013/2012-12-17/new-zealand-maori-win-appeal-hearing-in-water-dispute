New Zealand ’s Maori Council, which
represents the nation’s indigenous people, won the right to
challenge the government’s plan to sell shares in state-owned
energy companies.  The  Supreme Court  agreed to hear the appeal on Jan. 31 and
Feb. 1, according to a posting on the court’s  website  today.
High Court Justice Ronald Young dismissed the Maori challenge on
Dec. 11, ruling the courts couldn’t review parliament’s decision
to change the status of the companies from state-owned to mixed-
ownership models to allow the sale.  New Zealand’s government, which had an operating deficit of
NZ$2.87 billion ($2.42 billion) in the four months through
October, is cutting non-essential spending and selling assets to
speed up a return to surplus. The government forecasts it will
raise at least NZ$5 billion over the next three to five years by
selling as much as 49 percent of Mighty River Power Ltd.,
Genesis Power Ltd., Meridian Energy Ltd. as well as coal miner
Solid Energy and by reducing its holding in Air New Zealand Ltd.  The Maori Council and groups supporting it claim the asset
sales would be unlawful because they ignore outstanding Maori
claims to freshwater and geothermal resources.  Prime Minister John Key said on  Radio New Zealand  on Dec.
12 that Young’s ruling was a  “crushing defeat”  for the groups
opposing the sale and he didn’t think an appeal would change the
decision, according to Fairfax NZ News.  The case is Between The New Zealand Maori Council and The
Attorney General. 2012/NSSC 115. Supreme Court of New Zealand
(Wellington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
