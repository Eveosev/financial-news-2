Fidel Castro , who ruled Cuba for
almost half a century before handing the presidency to his
brother Raul in 2008, was nominated to run for a seat in the
National Assembly, state-run news agency AIN reported.  The 86-year-old former guerrilla leader will run to
represent Santiago de Cuba in the Feb. 3 election, when 612
lawmakers and more than 1,200 provincial delegates will be
elected,  AIN reported  in a story posted today on its online
edition. Raul, who must be a member of the assembly to remain
president, will run for the municipality of Segundo Frente.  Fidel Castro, who is already a member of the congress, has
remained largely out of public view since leaving the
presidency, often sparking speculation that his health is
failing. He last published one of his “Reflections” columns in
the state-run Granma newspaper in October, squashing talk he was
ill after he failed to publicly congratulate Venezuela’s  Hugo Chavez  on his presidential victory that month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
