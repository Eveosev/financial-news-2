China ’s investment abroad rose 25
percent in the first 11 months, highlighting the nation’s search
for opportunities abroad amid slower growth at home.  Outbound non-financial investment was $62.5 billion, the
Ministry of Commerce said on its website today. For the first 10
months, the gain was 25.8 percent from a year earlier.  Today’s figures contrast with a 3.5 percent decline in
inbound investment in the January-October period after an
economic  slowdown  damped foreign interest. China will step up
efforts to stabilize investment inflows next year and expand
outflows, state media reported yesterday after an economic
planning meeting in Beijing.  Inbound foreign investment totaled $91.7 billion in the
first 10 months of 2012.  --Scott Lanman, Liu Li. Editors: Scott Lanman, Paul Panckhurst  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
