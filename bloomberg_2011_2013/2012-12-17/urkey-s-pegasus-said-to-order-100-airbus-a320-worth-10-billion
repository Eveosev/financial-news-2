Airbus SAS is poised to win an order
from Turkish low-cost carrier Pegasus Airlines, a long-time
Boeing customer, for as many as 100 A320neo single-aisle
aircraft, three people familiar with the talks said.  Pegasus plans to take 75 planes on firm order, mixing
A320neos and the larger A321neo variant, said two of the people,
who asked not to be named because talks are private. Pegasus,
with 42 Boeing 737s in its fleet, may make an announcement,
including 25 options, as early as tomorrow, the people said.  The A320eo is a variant of the existing A320 with more
efficient engines, and has helped Airbus persuade loyal Boeing
customers to consider the alternative, making the aircraft the
fastest-selling jet in aviation history. Boeing plans to deliver
its competing 737 MAX in late 2017. The firm part of the Airbus
order would have a value of about $8 billion at list price.  Turkish carriers have been adding routes to neighboring
countries and raising capacity on domestic flights to attract
more customers. That’s led to higher earnings even as airlines
elsewhere lost business in the global slump.  The number of passengers carried in the Turkish air grew by
10 percent from a year ago to 121.8 million in the first 11
months of this year, according to government data.  Pegasus Havayollari AS is owned by Esas Holding AS and was
established in Istanbul in 2000, according to the company
website. It flies to 61 destinations in 24 countries, mostly in
 Europe . It is slated for an initial public offering in 2013.  Its main competitor is the flag carrier Turk Hava Yollari
AO, or  Turkish Airlines (THYAO) , which is controlled by the government
and has 202 aircraft in its fleet.  Airbus offers a choice of engines by  United Technologies
Corp. (UTX) ’s  Pratt & Whitney  or by CFM Intl., a venture between
 General Electric Co. (GE)  and SafranSA. Pegasus will choose engines
next year, one of the people said. Reuters reported earlier
today that Pegasus is considering the purchase of as many as 100
Airbus aircraft, citing people it didn’t identify.  To contact the reporters on this story:
