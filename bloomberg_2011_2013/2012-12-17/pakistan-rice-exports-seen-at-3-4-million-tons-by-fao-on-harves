Pakistan  may export 3.4 million
metric tons of rice and 1 million tons of wheat in the year
through April after grain production climbed in 2012, the United
Nations’ Food & Agriculture Organization forecast.  The country shipped 4.1 million tons of grain in 2011-12,
the Rome-based FAO wrote in a  report  on its website today.  Planting of Rabi season wheat and barley for harvesting in
spring is almost completed, according to the report. Flooding in
August and September hindered and delayed field work, and
Pakistan’s wheat area may be reduced because many areas were
still under water by the middle of November, the FAO said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
