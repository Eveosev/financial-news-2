Bharti Infratel Ltd. (BHIN) , a unit of
 India ’s largest wireless operator, raised about 41.7 billion
rupees ($763 million) in the country’s biggest initial public
offering in two years.  The New Delhi-based owner of wireless telecommunications
towers, sold shares to institutions and wealthy individuals at
220 rupees apiece, it said in an e-mailed statement. Bharti also
sold stock to so-called anchor and retail investors.  The shares were marketed at between 210 rupees and 240
rupees each, according to the IPO prospectus. Institutions and
wealthy individuals bid for all of the 148.4 million shares
reserved for them, while retail investors sought to acquire 12.2
million shares, according to data on the National Stock
Exchange’s  website  on Dec 14.  The IPO is the largest since state-owned  Coal India Ltd. (COAL) 
raised about 155 billion rupees in October 2010, and comes after
India’s benchmark BSE India Sensitive Index, or  Sensex (SENSEX) , rose 25
percent this year, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Indian
companies and the government sought over $2 billion in share
sales last week as stock market gains reignited demand for new
equity.  The company, controlled by  Bharti Airtel Ltd. (BHARTI) , sold shares
to retail investors for 210 rupees each, it said today. Bharti
Infratel already sold 28.3 million shares to 18 anchor investors
at 230 rupees, the company said on Dec. 10.  Bharti Airtel’s shares fell  3.7 percent  to 300.95 rupees as
of 3:30 p.m. Mumbai time today.  KKR Valuation  The offering, of 10 percent of Bharti Infratel, values the
company at about $7.6 billion. In 2008, KKR & Co., the New York-
based buyout firm, agreed to invest $250 million in Bharti
Infratel, valuing the company at $12.5 billion.  Bharti Infratel operates 34,220 towers used by mobile
telecom companies, its prospectus shows. The company’s
consolidated revenues rose to 94.52 billion rupees in the year
through March, from 85.08 billion rupees a year before,
according to the prospectus.  Sales may rise to 105 billion rupees in the year ending
March, according to an estimate by BRICS Securities Ltd.  The offering range values Bharti Infratel at 42.7 to 48.3
times expected 2013 earnings of 18.4 billion rupees, BRICS
analyst Sushil Sharma wrote in a Dec. 11 note to clients. That
compares with  30.3 times  at its parent company, according to
analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Exit Opportunity  Sharma recommended that investors subscribe to the
offering.  Bharti Infratel’s offering comes after India’s government
last week raised about $1.1 billion by selling a 10 percent
stake in  NMDC Ltd. (NMDC) , India’s largest iron ore producer. IPOs by
PC Jeweller Ltd. and Credit Analysis & Research Ltd., seeking
about $240 million, were several times oversubscribed last week.  Indian stocks are poised for their biggest annual advance
since 2009, after Prime Minister  Manmohan Singh  opened the
nation to more overseas investment to revive growth and avert a
downgrade of India’s credit rating.  The listing will provide an exit for companies such as
Temasek Holdings Pte, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Citigroup
Inc., which bought a $1 billion stake in 2007. As part of the
offering Bharti Infratel sold shares to 18 anchor investors,
including  Alliance Bernstein and Wellington Management Co., who
agreed to hold the shares for at least 30 days.  Standard Chartered Plc (STAN) , JPMorgan Chase & Co., Barclays Plc,
Bank of America Corp., Enam Securities Pvt., HSBC Holdings Plc,
Kotak Mahindra Capital Co., Deutsche Bank AG and UBS AG managed
the sale.  To contact the reporters on this story:
