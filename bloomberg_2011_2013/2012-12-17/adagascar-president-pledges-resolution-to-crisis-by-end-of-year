Madagascar President Andry Rajoelina
agreed to a final round of talks mediated by Tanzanian President
Jakaya Kikwete to resolve the country’s almost four-year
political crisis before the end of December.  The announcement was made in a joint statement released
after the leaders met Dec. 14-15 in Tanzania’s capital, Dar es
Salaam. “Significant progress has been made,” according to the
statement. “The two leaders agreed to have further
consultations with relevant stakeholders prior to meeting again
before the end of this month to conclude on the matter.”  Rajoelina, supported by the Madagascan military, ousted
elected President  Marc Ravalomanana  in March 2009 following a
series of protests, sparking a political crisis. The Indian
Ocean-island nation is the world’s largest vanilla grower.  Rajoelina, a former nightclub disc jockey, has come under
pressure from the 15-nation  Southern African Development
Community ,  African Union  and donors to help resolve the
political impasse, paving the way for democratic reforms and
elections.  Ravalomanana is living in exile in South Africa because he
risks arrest after being sentenced to life in prison for
civilian deaths during protests in Madagascar. Ravalomanana
announced after meeting Kikwete this month that he’ll abstain
from running in the next elections.  Kikwete is the current chairman of the politics, defense
and security cooperation committee of SADC.  To contact the reporters on this story:
