Thailand ’s baht touched a 10-week
high after foreign investors pumped money into local stocks on
optimism the nation’s economic growth prospects are improving.  Overseas funds bought $384 million more Thai shares than
they sold this month, taking net purchases in 2012 to $2.1
billion, exchange data show. Gross domestic product may increase
5.8 percent in 2012, compared with an earlier prediction of 5.7
percent, Bank of Thailand Governor Prasarn Trairatvorakul said
in Bangkok on Dec. 13.  Europe  will return to growth in the near
future and the U.S. economy’s fundamentals are in place, World
Bank President Jim Yong Kim said in  Stockholm  on Dec. 11.  “Barring natural disasters, Thailand’s prospects are
fairly constructive for next year in the sense that it should
benefit from the global recovery,” said Sim Moh Siong, a
currency strategist at Bank of Singapore Ltd. “The central bank
keeps a close eye on the competitiveness of the baht.”  The baht rose 0.1 percent to 30.61 against the dollar as of
3:08 p.m. in Bangkok, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
It touched 30.55 earlier, the strongest level since Oct. 8, and
has gained 3.1 percent this year. One-month implied volatility,
a measure of expected moves in exchange rates used to price
options, fell three basis points to 3.89 percent.  Standard & Poor’s  affirmed Thailand’s BBB+ credit rating,
the third-lowest investment grade, last week. S&P cited the
Southeast Asian nation’s “favorable external position” and the
credibility of its monetary policy. Overseas funds have pumped
$10 billion into Thai bonds so far in 2012 and inflows will
continue, Bank of Thailand Deputy Governor Pongpen Ruengvirayudh
said on Dec. 15.  The yield on the government’s 3.125 percent notes due
December 2015 rose one basis point to 2.96 percent, the highest
level since Oct. 18, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The yield

month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
