B. Riley & Co., the Los Angeles-
based investment bank, bought stock-research firm Caris & Co. to
increase its sales and trading business amid a slowdown in the
brokerage industry.  B. Riley, founded in 1997, is adding nine analysts, 12
salesmen and four traders in  San Francisco , New York,  Los
Angeles , San Diego and Atlanta, Chairman Bryant Riley said today
in a telephone interview. Darren Caris, who was president of
Caris & Co., will run research, sales and trading, the company
said in a statement.  Small brokerages including ThinkEquity LLC, Rodman &
Renshaw LLC and WJB Capital Group Inc. closed this year as
institutional investors turn to computerized  stock trading  and
the pace of activity on U.S. markets declines. Avian Securities
LLC shut after failing to find a firm willing to take on its
employees, founder Avi Cohen said last month.  “We’ve always expanded when it’s difficult,” said Riley,
who declined to say how much he paid for Caris. “This will add
to the research and sales side at a time when there’s less and
less firms out there servicing the institutional investor.”  Caris specializes in providing advice on trading the stocks
of technology and consumer companies, Riley said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
