Brent crude  fell for a second time
in three days amid concern that deadlock in U.S. budget talks
may threaten to curb economic growth and fuel demand.  The North Sea benchmark dropped as much as 45 cents,
reversing earlier gains. European stocks declined for a third
day on concern U.S. lawmakers won’t agree to a budget before
more than $600 billion in tax increases and spending cuts known
as the fiscal cliff start taking effect in January. The  Stoxx
Europe 600 (SXXP)  slid 0.3 percent to 278.62, while indexes in the
U.K.,  Germany  and  France  slumped.  “Debt reduction negotiations in the U.S. congress continue
to cloud the macro outlook going into 2013,”  Andrey Kryuchenkov , an analyst at VTB Capital in London, said in a
note. “Oil investors would prefer to wait on the sidelines
until this is resolved before placing large bets.”  Brent for February settlement fell 17 cents, or 0.2
percent, to $108.01 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures
Europe exchange as of 12:21 p.m. local time. The January
contract settled $1.24 higher at $109.15 when it expired Dec.
14. The European grade was at a premium of $20.81 to WTI, down
from $22.42 on Dec. 14.  West Texas Intermediate crude for January delivery was at
$86.69 a barrel, down 4 cents, in electronic trading on the  New
York  Mercantile Exchange. Front-month prices advanced 0.9
percent for the week ended Dec. 14.  Brent-WTI Spread  WTI has fallen 12 percent in 2012 as the U.S. shale boom
deepened the glut at Cushing,  Oklahoma , America’s biggest
storage hub and the delivery point for Nymex futures. That has
left it at an average discount of $17.36 to Brent this year,
compared with a premium of about 7 cents in the five years
through 2010. Brent, the benchmark grade for more than half the
world’s crude, has risen 0.5 percent this year.  Money managers lowered net-long positions, or wagers on
higher U.S. oil prices, by 21 percent in the seven days ended
Dec. 11, according to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission’s
Dec. 14 Commitments of Traders report. It was the biggest drop
since the week ended May 8.  “This is in line with falling WTI prices over that week
and also an apparently growing perception that the market will
be oversupplied in the months to come,” Vienna-based researcher
JBC Energy GmbH said today in a note.  Factory Output  Output at U.S. factories, mines and utilities increased 1.1
percent last month after a revised 0.7 percent drop in October
that was more than initially estimated, the  Federal Reserve 
reported Dec. 14. Economists forecast a 0.3 percent advance,
according to a Bloomberg survey. Manufacturing also surged 1.1
percent in November, the most this year.  In  China , a preliminary purchasing managers’ index by HSBC
Holdings Plc and  Markit Economics  indicated a reading of 50.9,
for December, higher than a median estimate of 50.8 in a
Bloomberg survey. It followed a reading of 50.5 in November,
which was above the expansion-contraction dividing line of 50
and was the first growth in 13 months.  China will consume 9.9 million barrels a day of oil,
115,000 more than previously projected, in the last three months
of this year, the  International Energy Agency  said in a Dec. 12
monthly report.  “Demand is affected by the good numbers for manufacturing
in the U.S. and China,” Fahad Alturki, Riyadh-based senior
economist at Jadwa Investment Co., said in a telephone interview
yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
