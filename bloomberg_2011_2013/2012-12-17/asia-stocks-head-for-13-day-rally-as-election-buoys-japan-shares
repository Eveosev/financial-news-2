Asian  stocks  fell, with the regional
benchmark index poised to snap its longest rally since 2004, as
suppliers to  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  dropped. Losses were limited as Japanese
shares jumped after a party that backs more economic stimulus
returned to power.  Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. fell 4.7 percent in Taipei,
pacing losses among suppliers to Apple, which had its rating cut
at Citigroup Inc.  Nissan Motor Co. (7201) ,  Japan ’s second-largest
carmaker by revenue, rose 1.8 percent as the yen slid to the
lowest level since April 2011 against the dollar.  Tokyo Electric
Power Co. (9501)  surged 33 percent on speculation Japan’s new
government will allow the restart of nuclear reactors.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index slipped 0.1 percent to 127.33
as of 7:48 p.m. in  Tokyo  after rising as much as 0.3 percent.
The measure capped a 12-day rally on Dec. 14, the longest
winning streak since January 2004. The MSCI Asia Pacific
Excluding Japan Index fell 0.5 percent to 462.74.  “The upward momentum of Apple shares peaked out as
investors priced in all the good news,” said  Mitsushige Akino ,
Tokyo-based chief fund officer at Ichiyoshi Asset Management
Co., which oversees about $356 million. “That’s affecting the
Apple suppliers that were trading at a premium. Investors are
concerned whether Apple can come up with something that can
surpass iPhones. It needs something beyond people’s imagination,
and that’s a hard hurdle to clear.”  Overbought Signals  The  14-day relative strength index  of the MSCI Asia Pacific
Index climbed to 77 on Dec. 14, rising above the 70 threshold
that some traders say signals equities are overheating.  Asia’s benchmark equities index rose 12 percent this year
as central banks from the U.S.,  Europe , Japan and  China  took
action to spur economic growth. The gauge traded at 14.4 times
average estimated earnings as of Dec. 14, compared with 13.6 for
the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and 12.7 times for the Stoxx
Europe 600 Index, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Apple suppliers dropped after Citigroup cut its rating on
the world’s most valuable company to neutral from buy, citing a
cut in iPhone orders.  Hon Hai Precision, which assembles the smartphone, lost 4.7
percent to NT$87.20. Foxconn Technology Co., which makes iPhone
casings, dropped 4.7 percent to NT$89.70. Largan Precision Co.,
which makes lenses for Apple, sank 5.5 percent to NT$741 in
Taipei.  Taiwan’s Taiex Index (TWSE)  dropped 0.9 percent.  Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average rose 0.9 percent to close
at the highest level since April 3. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 slid
0.2 percent and New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index fell 0.3 percent.
South Korea’s Kospi Index dropped 0.6 percent.  Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index fell 0.4 percent, while China’s
Shanghai Composite Index rose 0.5 percent. Singapore’s Straits
Times Index slid 0.3 percent.  Japan’s Election  Japanese shares advanced after the  Liberal Democratic Party 
reclaimed power in a landslide victory yesterday. The yen
dropped against all of its 16 major counterparts on expectations
the new government will expand monetary and fiscal stimulus to
reverse deflation. The  Bank of Japan  is scheduled to conclude a
policy meeting on Dec. 20.  “This is going to have a tremendous impact on the fortunes
of Japanese exporters and the economy,”  Ed Rogers , chief
executive officer at Tokyo-based Rogers Investment Advisors,
told Bloomberg Television today. “The moves in the dollar-yen
indicate that the world at large believes that we’re starting on
the path to reflation.”  Nissan, which gets about 79 percent of its revenue outside
Japan, added 1.8 percent to 799 yen. Sumitomo Realty &
Development Co. gained 3.4 percent to 2,437 yen.  Fast Retailing
Co. (9983) , Asia’s biggest apparel chain, rose 2.9 percent to 20,500
yen.  Korean Carmakers  Hyundai Motor Co. led South Korean auto stocks lower in
Seoul trading after the yen weakened, boosting prospects for
Japanese carmakers’ exports. Hyundai declined 2 percent to
225,000 won. Kia Motors Corp., a unit of Hyundai, slumped 3.6
percent to 59,200 won.  Tokyo Electric, known as Tepco, surged 33 percent to 202
yen on speculation the LDP’s victory will pave the way for the
utility to restart reactors at its Kashiwazaki Kariwa nuclear
plant, the world’s biggest. Shikoku Electric Power Co. jumped 15
percent to 1,308 yen, while Kansai Electric Power Co. soared 18
percent to 920 yen.  Futures on the  S&P 500 index  added 0.3 percent today. The
gauge dropped 0.4 percent on Dec. 14 as a lack of progress in
U.S. budget talks outweighed a rise in industrial production and
data showing China’s manufacturing may expand at a faster pace.  President  Barack Obama  and Republican House Speaker  John
Boehner  remained deadlocked at their third White House meeting
on next year’s budget. More than $600 billion in tax increases
and spending cuts, the so-called fiscal cliff, are scheduled to
take effect in January unless Congress acts to avert them.  To contact the reporter on this story:
