Serbia ’s central bank will seek to
slow inflation next year while keeping its permissable target
band unchanged.  The Belgrade-based Narodna Banka Srbije will focus on
reducing price growth to 4 percent plus or minus 1.5 percentage
points, from more than 10 percent this year and pledged to make
 interest rate  changes “consistent and predictable,” the bank
said today in a statement posted on its website.  The bank will maintain a managed-floating regime for the
dinar exchange rate, “intervening in the foreign-exchange
market” to smooth its daily swings, encourage interbank trade,
or maintain financial and price stability, it said.  Inflation reached 11.9 percent in November and the central
bank raised the  benchmark interest rate  to 11.25 percent on Dec.
