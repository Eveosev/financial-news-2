Banca Comerciala Romana SA,
Romania’s largest bank by assets, will cut about 18 percent of
its workforce in the next 12 to 18 months, Mediafax  reported
today , citing Tomas Spurny, the lender’s chief executive
officer.  The bank, majority owned by  Austria ’s  Erste Group Bank AG (EBS) ,
will close more than 60 unprofitable branches and fire 1,600
people to reduce its total workforce to 7,500 to adapt its
business model to the “new economic reality,” the Bucharest-
based news service quoted Spurny as saying. BCR targets a cost
reduction of 250 million lei ($74 million) in the next two
years, according to Mediafax.  To contact the reporter on this story:
