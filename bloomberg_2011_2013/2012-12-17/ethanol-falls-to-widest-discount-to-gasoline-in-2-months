Ethanol’s discount to gasoline
widened to the largest gap in two months as inventories of the
fuel additive rose to a seasonal high and corn prices slumped on
slowing demand.  An Energy Department report last week showed ethanol
 stockpiles  gained 687,000 barrels to 20 million in the seven
days ended Dec. 7, the highest for this time of year since at
least 2010, when the department began collecting data. As of
Dec. 6,  corn sales  for delivery before Sept. 1 dropped 46
percent to 12.488 million tons from a year earlier, the
Agriculture Department reported.  “Ethanol inventories are oversupplied on a seasonal basis
and this is putting slight downward pressure on the front of the
ethanol curve,” said Mike Breitenbach, an analyst and trader at
Blue Ocean Brokerage LLC in  New York .  Denatured ethanol for January delivery fell 2.1 cents, or
0.9 percent, to $2.277 a gallon on the  Chicago  Board of Trade,
the lowest price since Sept. 27. The difference between ethanol
and gasoline widened to 37.76 cents based on settlement prices,
the largest gap since Oct. 17 and up from 36.41 Dec. 14,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  In cash market trading, ethanol on the West Coast slid 3
cents to $2.43 cents a gallon and in the U.S. Gulf the additive
declined 1.5 cents to $2.335, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
Ethanol in Chicago decreased 1 cent to $2.275 a gallon and in
New York the biofuel gained 3 cents to $2.40.  Gasoline for January delivery slumped 0.75 cent to settle
at $2.6546 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . The
contract covers reformulated gasoline, made to be blended with
ethanol before delivery to filling stations.  Corn for March delivery declined 0.9 percent to close at
$7.24 a bushel in Chicago, the biggest drop since Dec. 10.  To contact the reporter on this story:
