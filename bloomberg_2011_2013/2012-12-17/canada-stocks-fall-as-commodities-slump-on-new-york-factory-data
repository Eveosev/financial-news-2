Canadian  stocks  fell as raw
materials companies declined after manufacturing slumped more
than forecast in the  New York  region, showing weakness in the
industry is persisting as the year draws to a close.  First Quantum Minerals Ltd. (FM) , a producer of copper in
Africa, dropped 4 percent after it raised its bid for Inmet
Mining Corp. to C$5.1 billion ($5.17 billion). Inmet rose 4.3
percent.  First Majestic Silver Corp. (FR)  plunged 10 percent after it
announced a deal to acquire Orko Silver Corp. yesterday.  Sun
Life Financial Inc. (SLF)  slipped 3.9 percent after the insurer agreed
to sell a U.S. annuity business to a firm owned by Guggenheim
Partners LLC in a $1.35 billion deal.  The  Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index (SPTSX)  fell 15.37
points, or 0.1 percent, to 12,281.35 at 4 p.m. in Toronto. The
equity gauge has gained 2.7 percent this year.  “Commodities are pretty flat today,” said  Paul Harris ,
 fund manager  with Avenue Investment Management in Toronto. His
firm manages about C$300 million. “Gold doesn’t look as great
on the charts; it could go to $2,000 but people are feeling it
will go lower short-term before it goes higher. Gold went from
$1,500 in June to $1,800 and now it’s pulled back.”  The price of gold has fallen more than 5 percent since
reaching a second-half high of $1,798.60 in October. Gold for
February delivery gained 0.1 percent to settle at $1,698.20 an
ounce in New York.  Yamana Gold Inc. lost 1.9 percent to C$16.90 and Goldcorp
Inc., the second-largest producer of the metal, dropped 0.4
percent to C$36.33.  Factory Gauge  A Federal Reserve gauge of manufacturing in the New York
region  shrank  more than forecast to minus 8.1 in December. The
median forecast of 55 economists in a Bloomberg survey called
for minus 1. Readings of less than zero indicate contraction.  Mining and bank stocks contributed  most  to losses in the
S&P/TSX. Trading volume was 28 percent higher than the 30-day
average at this time of the day.  First Majestic plunged 10 percent to C$20.29 after it
announced a plan to acquire  Orko (OK)  for about C$387 million. As
part of the deal, First Majestic will issue 17.1 million common
shares. Orko, which is developing a silver project in  Mexico ,
surged 51 percent to C$2.39.  Silvercorp Metals Inc. retreated 7.7 percent to C$5.18 and
Fortuna Silver Mines Inc. sank 5.5 percent to C$4.26.  First Quantum fell 4 percent to C$20.11 after raising its
bid for Inmet a second time. The company is now offering C$72 in
stock and cash for each Inmet share. The bid is 2.9 percent more
than the previous offer of C$70 a share.  Inmet, which is developing the Cobre  Panama  copper project
in Panama, climbed 4.3 percent to C$72.85, suggesting investors
are speculating other suitors will bid for the company.  Copper Stockpiles  HudBay Minerals Inc. (HBM)  lost 3 percent to C$10.37. Copper for
March delivery slipped 0.5 percent to settle at $3.666 a pound,
as inventories tracked by the London Metal Exchange jumped the
most in more than four years.  Sun Life Financial Inc., Canada’s third-largest insurer,
lost 3.9 percent to C$26.74. Sun Life expects the sale of the
U.S. annuity business to reduce earnings by about 22 cents a
share in 2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
