Cotton rose to the highest price in
almost eight weeks amid an improving demand outlook in  China ,
the world’s largest consumer. Sugar and coffee gained, while
orange juice and cocoa fell.  China’s manufacturing is expanding at a faster pace this
month, a preliminary reading for a purchasing managers’ index
released by HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics showed Dec.
14. The country plans to increase urbanization, the state-run
Xinhua News Agency reported yesterday after the annual central
economic work conference. Last week, the  U.S. Department of
Agriculture  raised its forecast for global cotton demand.  “Good economic data from China helped demand ideas,”  Jack Scoville , a vice president for Price Futures Group in Chicago,
said today in a report. “Some leftover bullish sentiment from
the USDA report” also supported prices, he said.  Cotton for March delivery increased 1.1 percent to 75.91
cents a pound at 11:42 a.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in  New York ,
after reaching 76.25 cents, the highest since Oct. 23. Through
Dec. 14, cotton fell 18 percent this year as global inventories
expanded.  Raw-sugar futures for March delivery climbed 1.8 percent to
19.35 cents a pound in New York, after touching 19.38 cents, the
highest since Dec. 7. The commodity has dropped 17 percent this
year amid forecasts for record output in  Brazil , the top
producer.  Arabica-coffee futures for March delivery gained 1.5
percent to $1.453 a pound on ICE.  Orange-juice futures for March delivery fell 0.7 percent to
$1.372 a pound in New York, while cocoa futures for March
delivery dropped 0.5 percent to $2,423 a metric ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
