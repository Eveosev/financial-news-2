Libya’s parliament voted to close
the country’s borders with four neighbors and conduct a military
operation in the south to catch fugitives and return
infiltrators, the state-run Libyan  News Agency  reported.  The decision to temporarily close borders with Chad,  Niger ,
Sudan and Algeria passed the General National Congress yesterday
with 136 votes in favor in the 200-member legislature, Lana
said.  Parliament called on Libya’s defense minister to appoint a
military ruler who is not from the south to conduct military
operations there, Lana said, without giving more details of the
proposed operation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
