from the U.S., the world’s biggest exporter.  As of Dec. 6, corn sales for delivery before Sept. 1 fell
46 percent to 12.488 million tons from a year earlier, the
lowest since the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  began reporting
the data in 1990, the USDA said. Output of grain-based ethanol,
a gasoline additive, tumbled 1.3 percent in the week ended Dec.
7 from a week earlier, and inventories rose to the highest since
