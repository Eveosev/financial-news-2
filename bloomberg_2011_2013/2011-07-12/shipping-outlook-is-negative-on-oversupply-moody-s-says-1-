The outlook for the global shipping
industry over the next 12 to 18 months is “negative” because
of overcapacity, Moody’s Investors Service said.  Dry bulk may weaken the most as new supply sends freight
rates lower, Moody’s analyst Marco Vetulli said in a report
today. Over the next two years, 80 percent of dry bulk ships on
order will be delivered, as freight rates move lower in 2011
than in 2010, according to the report.  An oversupply of  oil tankers  may continue until 2013,
Moody’s said. The practice of storing crude oil at sea on 2
million barrel very large crude carriers, or VLCCs, is no longer
profitable and these ships have returned to the global fleet,
further swelling the numbers of available tankers, it said.  Shipping disruptions after  Japan ’s March 11 earthquake
and tsunami may end in the fourth quarter, according to Vetulli,
who is a senior credit officer at Moody’s in Milan. “We expect
volumes of seaborne trade flows, which for dry bulk means
commodities, to recover to pre-earthquake levels in the fourth
quarter of this year,” Vetulli said by e-mail today in response
to questions from Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
