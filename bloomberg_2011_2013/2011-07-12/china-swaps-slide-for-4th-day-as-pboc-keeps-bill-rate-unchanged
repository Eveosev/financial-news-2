China ’s interest-rate swaps declined
to a two-week low on speculation the central bank will pause in
raising  interest rates .  The People’s Bank of China held the yield on one-year bills
at 3.4982 percent, the third week it has been at that level,
according to a statement on its website, adding to signs policy
makers will refrain from adding to this year’s three increases
in borrowing costs. The monetary authority issued 99 billion
yuan ($15.3 billion) of 28-day repurchase agreements today,
compared with 22 billion yuan a week ago.  “The central bank may not raise interest rates this
month,” said Guo Caomin, a bond analyst at Industrial Bank Co.
in Shanghai. “Swap rates, which are based on the seven-day
repurchase rate, also declined because liquidity has improved.”  The one-year swap contract, the fixed cost needed to
receive the floating seven-day repo rate, fell seven basis
points to 3.75 percent as of the 4:30 p.m. close in  Shanghai ,
the lowest level since June 27, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  The seven-day repurchase rate, which measures interbank
funding availability, dropped 48 basis points to 4.83 percent,
according to a weighted average rate compiled by the National
Interbank Funding Center.  China’s State Council may discuss the nation’s economic
direction in the second half during a regular meeting tomorrow,
the National Business Daily reported today, without saying where
it got the information.  The yield on the 3.83 percent government bond due March
2021 was little changed at 3.83 percent, according to the
Interbank Funding Center.  --Judy Chen. Editors: Andrew Janes,  James Regan   To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
