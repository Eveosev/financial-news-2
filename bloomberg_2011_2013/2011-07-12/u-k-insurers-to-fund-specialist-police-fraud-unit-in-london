British insurance companies are to
fund a 35-strong police unit dedicated to tackling fraudulent
claims that currently cost the industry about 2 billion pounds
($3.2 billion) annually.  The unit will focus on “organized gangs and opportunistic
fraudsters,” according to an e-mailed statement today from the
 City of London Police , which will run the service. It will start
work at the beginning of next year.  Fraud is one part of what Justice Minister Jonathan Djanogly last month described as a “rotten” system of
insurance claims in which criminals and other legal
intermediaries are blamed by insurers for inflating costs.
Insurance fraud adds 44 pounds to the average Briton’s spending
on insurance, the  City of London  Police said.  The initiative “represents another important landmark for
private sector funding in policing, something that we should
actively encourage within the current financial climate,”
Adrian Leppard, the City police commissioner said in the
statement.  Members of the  Association of British Insurers  will fund
the division for the next three years, the statement said. There
will also be an “evaluation” after two years, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
