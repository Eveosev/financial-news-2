The euro declined to a four-month
low against the yen as soaring yields on Italian  government
bonds  stoked concern the region’s sovereign-debt crisis is
spreading to its largest economies.  The 17-nation currency fell to a record versus the Swiss
franc before the Italian Treasury sells one-year bills today and
as much as 5 billion euros ($7 billion) of bonds on July 14. The
yen rose against most of its major counterparts as Asian stocks
extended a worldwide equity slump, spurring demand for safer
assets. The dollar maintained a two-day drop versus the yen
before the  Federal Reserve  releases minutes from its June
meeting amid signs the U.S. recovery is faltering.  “There’s no question that the Italian debt situation is
under pressure,” said Alex Sinton, a senior dealer at ANZ
National Bank Ltd. in Auckland,  New Zealand . “There’s still
weakness and downside potential for the euro.”  The euro fell to as low as 111.74 yen, the least since
March 18, before trading at 111.88 at 11:08 a.m. in  Tokyo  from
112.61 in  New York  yesterday. It declined to $1.3938, the
weakest since March 17, from $1.4029 yesterday, before changing
hands at $1.3959. The euro was 0.3 percent lower at 1.16882
Swiss francs after dropping to a record 1.16719.  The dollar slipped to 80.15 yen from 80.26 yesterday.  The yield on 10-year Italian bonds rose 41 basis points to
close at 5.68 percent yesterday, the highest in more than a
decade, pushing the yield premium investors demand to hold the
debt over German bunds to a euro-era record of 301 basis points.  Italian bond yields are less than 2 percentage points away
from disaster, according to  Gary Jenkins , head of fixed-income
at Evolution Securities Ltd. in  London . Greece, Ireland and
Portugal all sought international assistance after their 10-year
yields rose past 7 percent.  Italy faces 175 billion euros in debt maturities this year
and has 1.6 trillion euros of bonds outstanding, the world’s
third-largest debt pile after the U.S. and Japan.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index fell 1.7 percent following
yesterday’s 1.8 percent drop in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  To contact the reporters on this story:
