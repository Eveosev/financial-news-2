Campbell Soup Co. (CPB) , the world’s
largest soup maker, said profit will decline in its fiscal 2012
as the company’s incoming chief executive officer detailed a new
strategic plan.  Income excluding some items will decline as much as 6
percent in the fiscal year beginning next month, the Camden, New
Jersey-based company said today in a statement. Revenue will be
little changed or gain as much as 2 percent next year, the
company said.  Chief Operating Officer Denise Morrison, who will become
CEO on Aug. 1, outlined a new strategy for the company today at
a meeting with investors. The plan includes expanding Campbell’s
three categories of simple meals, baked snacks and healthy
beverages; innovating in products and packaging and expanding in
emerging markets, Morrison said on a webcast of the meeting.  Campbell declined 13 cents to $34.01 at 9:05 a.m. in
trading before the opening of the New York Stock Exchange. The
stock declined 1.8 percent this year through yesterday.  American consumption of soup has dropped steadily in recent
years to about 4.1 kilograms per capita in 2010, according to
Euromonitor International.  The company’s soup, sauces and beverages business accounted
for about half of its $7.68 billion in sales last year.
Campbell’s other brands include Pepperidge Farm cookies and
crackers, V8 juices, and Prego spaghetti sauce.  To contact the reporter on this story:
