Kenyan coffee prices climbed 10
percent at a sale today as better quality beans boosted demand,
the Nairobi Coffee Exchange said.  The average price for all the coffee sold increased to
$343.25 per 50-kilogram (110-pound) bag, from $311.67 two-weeks
ago, the exchange said in an e-mailed statement today.  Kenya 
didn’t hold an auction last week because of insufficient
supplies after cold weather disrupted drying of the beans.  The benchmark AA grade rose 4 percent to an average of
$434.24 a bag after supplies fell 22 percent to 1,457 bags, the
exchange said.  “The performance today was better because of an increase
in demand and good quality coffee which is streaming in,” said
David Muriithi, the exchange’s acting chief executive officer,
by phone from Nairobi.  “Traders were covering their short positions since we
didn’t have an auction last week and supplies may be low next
week,” Mansukh Shah, a coffee trader for Alanwood Ltd., said by
phone from Nairobi.  Sales at the auction rose 44 percent to 16,507 bags worth
$6.91 million, from 11,495 bags valued at $4.38 million at the
previous sale, the exchange said. Supplies of the beans rose 17
percent to 22,567 bags, it said.  Kenya’s coffee production in the 12 months through
September may decline 27 percent to 40,000 metric tons, from the
previous forecast of between 49,000 and 55,000 tons, James
Wahome, the quality manager at the Coffee Board of Kenya, said
on Jan. 17.  The country produced 45,000 tons last season. Kenya
harvests the bulk of its crop from October through December,
while a secondary crop is reaped from April to June.  The following are details of today’s auction in U.S.
