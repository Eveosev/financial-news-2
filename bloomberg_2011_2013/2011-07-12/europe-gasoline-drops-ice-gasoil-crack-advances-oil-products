European gasoil futures advanced for
the sixth time in seven days on the ICE Futures  Europe  exchange.  The amount of gasoil to be delivered through the ICE
exchange in July rose. Premium gasoline advanced.  Light Products  Premium gasoline traded at as much as $1,062 a metric ton
as Total SA bought on the barge market, according to a Bloomberg
survey of traders and analysts monitoring the Platts pricing
window. That’s an $18 increase from yesterday’s highest trade.  Eurobob gasoline for immediate loading traded from $1,024
to $1,044 a metric ton, according to the survey of Platts and
the Argus Bulletin Board. That’s little changed on yesterday.  Chevron Corp. was among sellers for the Eurobob grade, to
which ethanol is added before being sold to motorists. So-called
barge lots are usually about 1,000 or 2,000 tons.  The motor fuel’s premium to  Brent crude , or its crack,
advanced to $7.61 a barrel, according to PVM Oil Associates Ltd.
data on Bloomberg. That’s the highest level since July 4.  Middle Distillates  Diesel barges traded at premiums from $28 to $29 a ton to
the August gasoil futures contract on ICE, the survey showed.
That compares with a deal at a $30.50 a ton premium to the July
futures contract on July 8. Diesel barges didn’t trade
yesterday.  Demand for the fuel in Europe is “quite firm,”  Francisco Blanch , global head of commodities research at Bank of America
Merrill Lynch, wrote in a report e-mailed today. That’s in
contrast to demand for other fuels, which has “softened a
touch” in the last few months, the report said.  The July gasoil futures contract on ICE expired today. The
amount of gasoil to be delivered in July rose to 253,600 tons,
according to data from the Intercontinental Exchange Inc. That
compares with 251,600 tons in June and 233,900 tons in July last
year.  Gasoil futures advanced on the ICE exchange in  London . The
contract for August delivery added $5.75, or 0.6 percent, to
$966.50 a ton as of 5:25 p.m. local time. Gasoil is mainly used
in heating.  Heating oil barges traded at discounts from $2 to $3.50 to
the August futures contract, the survey showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
