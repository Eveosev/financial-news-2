France ’s inflation rate unexpectedly
climbed to the highest in more than 2 1/2 years in June as costs
for food, energy and services rose.  Consumer prices jumped 2.3 percent from a year earlier,
based on European Union methodology, after rising an annual 2.2
percent in May, the Paris-based national statistics office Insee
said today. That’s the biggest gain since October 2008.
Economists had forecast an increase of 2.2 percent, according to
the median of 10 estimates in a Bloomberg News survey. In the
month, prices advanced 0.1 percent.  Crude  oil prices  have jumped 26 percent over the past year,
forcing French motorists to pay more for gasoline and sapping
households’ disposable income. The  European Central Bank , which
on July 7 raised its benchmark rate for the second time this
year, has repeatedly said it’s determined to prevent higher
energy costs from feeding into wage demands.  Oil products were 14.1 percent more expensive in June from
a year earlier, Insee said. Energy costs advanced 11.5 percent,
while food prices rose 1.8 percent from June 2010, as did prices
of services, including health-care costs and rent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
