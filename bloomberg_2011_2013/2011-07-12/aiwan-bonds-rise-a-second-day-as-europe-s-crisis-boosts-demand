Taiwan ’s dollar dropped by the most
in more than three weeks as  Europe ’s worsening debt crisis
prompted investors to reduce holdings of emerging-market assets.  The benchmark Taiex share index slumped 2 percent as
overseas investors sold $227 million more stocks than they
bought today, the biggest sell-off since June 16, according to
exchange data. Taiwan’s bonds gained for a second day as
investors favored the relative safety of government debt.
Italian 10-year yields climbed to the highest level in more than
a decade on concern the country will be forced to join Greece,
Portugal and Ireland in seeking a bailout.  “Europe’s debt crisis damped risk-taking appetite and
supported bonds,” said  Albert Lee , a Taipei-based fixed-income
trader at Cathay United Bank Co.  The  Taiwan dollar  weakened 0.5 percent to NT$28.998 against
its U.S. counterpart as of the 4 p.m. local time close,
according to Taipei Forex Inc. That’s the largest daily drop
since June 16.  The yield on Taiwan’s 2 percent notes due July 2016, the
most-traded government debt, fell one basis point to 1.155
percent, prices from Gretai Securities Market show. A basis
point is 0.01 percentage point. The government will auction
NT$30 billion ($1 billion) of five-year debt on July 15.  The money-market rate, which measures interbank funding
availability, was unchanged at 0.371 percent, according to a
weighted average compiled by the Taiwan Interbank Money Center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
