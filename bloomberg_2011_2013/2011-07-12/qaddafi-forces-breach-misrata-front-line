Forces loyal to  Muammar Qaddafi 
attacked the Libyan city of Misrata, breaching the opposition’s
front line to the west and killing 11 rebel fighters, military
officials in the rebel-held enclave said.  The aim of yesterday’s assault was to capture a strategic
hill that gives views over the city, said Hassan Duew, a rebel
commander. Qaddafi’s soldiers were pushed back and the front
line remains in place. There was no comment from the government
on the fighting or whether its forces sustained casualties.  “They advanced 300 meters over the front line,” Duew said
in an interview late yesterday.  Misrata, about 170 kilometers (100 miles) from the capital,
Tripoli, is the main rebel-held city in western  Libya  and has
been under siege for most of the uprising that began in
February. The attack comes four days after rebel forces pushed
west to within 3 kilometers of the nearby government-held town
of Zlitan, where they are now dug in.  Duew said rebels were angry that there was no sign of any
North Atlantic Treaty Organization assistance during the battle,
which saw a heavy bombardment by government rockets and mortar
bombs. “Every day 10 die, 11 die,” he said. “Where is NATO?”  To contact the reporter on this story:
