Angola ’s sovereign debt rating was
raised one step by  Standard & Poor’s , helping plans for a debut
sale of dollar bonds as surging  oil prices  restored the
country’s fiscal and current account balances to surpluses.  Sub-Saharan Africa’s second-largest oil producer after
Nigeria is rated BB-, or three levels below S&P’s lowest
investment-grade rating, matching assessments for Gabon and
Venezuela and carrying a “stable” outlook, the company said in
a statement today, implying it probably won’t change soon.  Higher oil prices boosted state revenue, helping the
country move from a deficit in 2009 to a surplus of 7.7 percent
of gross domestic product last year, S&P said. Angola has
started implementing fiscal and monetary reforms recommended by
the  International Monetary Fund , which will lessen the risk of
its over-dependence on oil revenue, the ratings company said.  “The upgrade reflects our view of the robust improvement
in Angola’s fiscal and external balances,” Ravi Bhatia, a
credit analyst at S&P, wrote in the statement. “We expect that
relatively high oil and gas prices as well as some increase in
oil and gas production should support the economy over the
2011-2014 forecast horizon.”  Angola has a $1.4 billion loan facility with the IMF. The
country intends to sell its first dollar bond of $500 million in
September, Finance Minister Carlos Alberto Lopes said on April
20.  The nation’s credit rating was upgraded to Ba3 by Moody’s
Investors Service on June 3 and to BB- by Fitch on May 24.  To contact the reporter on this story:
