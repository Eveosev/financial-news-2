Northern Ireland police said 22
officers were injured in rioting in  Belfast  that started late
last night as Protestants prepare to take part in hundreds of
marches across the British province.  Catholics attacked police in west Belfast with petrol
bombs, bricks and bottles and 51 plastic bullets were fired to
quell the trouble, according to a statement from the Police
Service of Northern Ireland. Water cannon was also deployed and
four police officers received hospital treatment.  “We would appeal for everyone to do everything they can to
help ensure all areas are calm and peaceful over the next 48
hours,” said Assistant Chief Constable Dave Jones. “Violence
does not need to be inevitable.”  Protestant celebrations of a 17th century victory over
Catholics in Ireland culminate in hundreds of marches across
 Northern Ireland  today, the anniversary of the battle, testing
the region’s peace process. Last year, Catholics rioted for four
days in Belfast when one of the parades passed by their area.  Today’s parades won’t end until late in the evening, when
some of the marches make their way back to Protestant
neighborhoods via Catholic districts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
