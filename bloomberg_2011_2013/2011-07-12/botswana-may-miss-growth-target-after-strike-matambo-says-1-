Botswana’s economy may expand less
than the 7.2 percent forecast by the government for this year
after an eight-week strike by state workers disrupted
production, Finance Minister Kenneth Matambo said.  The strike had “been detrimental to the economy,” Matambo
told lawmakers in the capital, Gaborone, today. The growth
forecast for the year through March 2012 was made in Matambo’s
budget speech in February.  Nurses, teachers and other government workers went on
strike to demand a 12 percent pay increase, clashing with police
in protests. Labor unions suspended the strike on June 13 after
the government refused to raise its offer from 3 percent.
Central bank Governor Linah Mohohlo said on June 15 the impact
of the strike may “reverse the gains” of the economy’s
recovery so far.  “There may be a slight reduction in real growth from the
original forecast stated in the 2011 budget speech,” Matambo
said. “Such a decline may however be cushioned by the improved
performance of the mining sector.”  The economy of the world’s biggest diamond producer has
rebounded after a slump in demand for  luxury goods  caused a 3.7
percent contraction in gross domestic product in 2009.  Mining increased 7.2 percent in the first quarter from a
year earlier, helping the economy expand 6.4 percent, the
statistics office said on June 30.  While the recovery in mining may help cushion the economy
from the impact of the strike, “there may be long term
implications, especially with respect to education and skills
development,” Matambo said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
