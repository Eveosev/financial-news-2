The  Federal Reserve  has released
the list of institutions that will be exempt from rules capping
debit-card swipe fees.  The Dodd-Frank Act, which required the Fed to write the
rules regulating the interchange market, exempted financial
institutions with less than $10 billion in assets. Those with
more than $10 billion in assets, including  Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC)  and
 Bank of America Corp. (BAC) , face a 21-cent cap on the fees.  The list of exempt institutions is available on the Fedâ€™s
website.  The Fed finalized the rule during a June 29 board meeting.
It is scheduled to go into effect on Oct. 1. The central bank
also published a list of institutions that will be affected by
the new rules.  To contact the reporter on this story:
