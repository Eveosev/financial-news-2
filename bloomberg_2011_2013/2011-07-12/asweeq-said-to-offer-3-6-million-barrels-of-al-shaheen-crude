Qatar International Petroleum
Marketing Co., known as Tasweeq, offered to sell 3.6 million
barrels of Al-Shaheen crude for loading in September, said two
traders who received the tender documents, declining to be
identified because they aren’t authorized to speak to the media.  Details of the offer are as follows:  Al-Shaheen has qualities similar to  Saudi Arabia ’s Arab
Medium crude oil. Qatar also exports two other grades, Qatar
Marine and Qatar Land, to customers in  Asia .  To contact the reporter on this story:
