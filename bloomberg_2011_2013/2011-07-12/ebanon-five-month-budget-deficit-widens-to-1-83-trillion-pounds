Lebanon’s budget deficit increased
in the first five months as the government spent more on
subsidies for the electricity generating power company.  The deficit widened to 1.83 trillion Lebanese pounds ($1.2
billion) from 1.3 trillion pounds in the same period last year,
the  Ministry of Finance  said in an e-mail today. Revenue fell 1
percent to 5 trillion pounds. Allocations for the government-run
power company  Electricite du Liban , which provides more than 90
percent of the country’s electricity, increased 17.5 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
