Hog futures fell the most this month
on signs of slowing U.S. demand. Cattle also declined.  Yesterday, spot-market hog prices fell 1.8 percent to 90.41
cents a pound, the lowest in four weeks, while futures jumped on
speculation that  China  will import U.S. pork to cap rising
domestic meat prices, said  Dax Wedemeyer , a broker at U.S.
Commodities Inc. in  West Des Moines .  “We are seeing a little bit of softness in the cash
market,” said Doug Harper, an analyst at Brock Associates in
 Milwaukee . “Futures were sharply higher yesterday on talk of
Chinese business. This is probably mostly a correcting
pullback.”  Hog futures for October settlement fell 0.55 cent, or 0.6
percent, to settle at 92.2 cents a pound at 1 p.m. on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the biggest drop for a most-active
contract since June 30. The commodity has climbed 24 percent in
the past 12 months.  China will seek to increase supplies of hogs to promote a
stable market, Premier  Wen Jiabao  said in a statement posted on
the government’s website. Pork prices in June soared 57 percent
from a year earlier, a government report on consumer prices
showed on July 9.  Cattle futures for August delivery dropped 0.675 cent, or
0.6 percent, to settle at $1.14025 a pound on the CME. The price
has gained 25 percent in the past year.  Feeder-cattle futures for August settlement declined 1.325
cents, or 0.9 percent, to $1.42025 a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
