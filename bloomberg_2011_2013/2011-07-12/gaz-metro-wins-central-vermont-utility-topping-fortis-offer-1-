Gaz Metro LP agreed to buy  Central
Vermont Public Service Corp. (CV)  for $472.2 million in cash, beating
a bid by Fortis Inc. to become the largest electricity supplier
in  Vermont .  Central Vermont holders will get $35.25 a share under deal,
the companies said today in a statement. Gaz Metro, based in
 Montreal , will merge the Rutland, Vermont-based company with
Green Mountain Power, the Vermont utility it bought last year.
Fortis will get $19.5 million in termination fees and costs.  The Gaz Metro bid, announced on June 23, is “superior” to
the $35.10 per offer by Fortis, and represents a 45 percent
premium to the share price prior to the Fortis announcement,
Central Vermont said.  Central Vermont fell 95 cents, or 2.6 percent to $35.05 at
4:15 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The
shares had closed yesterday at 75 cents above the offer price.
Fortis rose 38 cents, or 1.2 percent, to C$32.76 in Toronto
Stock Exchange trading.  Gaz Metro is the largest natural-gas distributor in  Quebec ,
according to its website. The partnership is owned by Gaz Metro
Inc. and Valener Inc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
