South Africa ’s borrowing costs rose
to the highest in four months at an auction of government debt
on concern Europe’s debt crisis will worsen.  The Pretoria-based  Reserve Bank  sold 1.5 billion rand
($217.2 million) of 7.25 percent notes maturing in 2020 at an
average yield of 8.43 percent, the highest since the March 22
sale. Investors bid for 1.8 times the amount on offer, according
to central bank data on Bloomberg. It also sold 600 million rand
of 7 percent bonds due 2031 at a yield of 8.95 percent, the
highest since March 8, with investors bidding for 1.5 the
securities on offer.  The dollar rose to a four-month high against the euro and
 U.S. Treasuries  surged, pushing yields to seven-month lows, as
investors turned to safe-haven assets on concern Europe’s debt
crisis will spread to economies too big to rescue. The extra
yield investors demand to buy South African 10-year debt over
U.S. Treasuries widened 12 basis points to 5.58 percentage
points, the most since March 17.  “Simply put, this was a very poor auction outcome,”  Leon Myburgh  and Coura Fall, analysts at  Citibank NA  in Johannesburg,
said in an e-mailed comment. “Few people wanted these bonds,
and those that did bid in small clips at high yield levels. The
risk-off sentiment on increased European concerns was probably
the main factor keeping buyers at bay.”  The secondary market yield on the 2020 bonds rose six basis
points today to 8.42 percent as of 11:43 a.m. in Johannesburg,
the highest on a closing basis since May 18.  To contact the reporter on this story:
