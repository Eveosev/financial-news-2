Argentina  beat Costa Rica 3-0 in a
must-win match to advance to the quarterfinals of soccer’s Copa
America as a group runner-up.  Sergio Aguero scored either side of halftime at the Estadio
Mario Kempes in Cordoba last night before Angel  Di Maria  added
the host nation’s third goal in the 63rd minute. FIFA World
Player of the Year Lionel Messi provided defense-splitting
passes for the second and third goals.  Argentina, seeking its first continental championship since
1993, finished Group A with five points to join pool winner
Colombia, Chile, Peru and Venezuela in the last eight. Argentina
will face the Group C runner-up in Sante Fe on July 16.  The top two teams and the two third-place nations with the
best records advance from the group stage.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
