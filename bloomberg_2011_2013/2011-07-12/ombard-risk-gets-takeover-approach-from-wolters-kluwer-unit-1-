Lombard Risk Management Plc (LRM) , a U.K.
developer of software for banks such as Societe Generale SA,
said it’s in talks to be bought by a unit of Dutch publisher
 Wolters Kluwer NV. (WKL)   “While at this point in time the board thinks it unlikely
that an acceptable offer will be forthcoming, discussions are
continuing and a further announcement will be made as
appropriate,” London-based Lombard said in a statement today.  Wolters Kluwer’s FRS Global division made the approach,
Lombard said. Lauren Dearmer, a spokeswoman for the bidder,
didn’t return a telephone call seeking comment.  Lombard said in May revenue in the 12 months through March
jumped 32 percent to 11.8 million pounds from the year-earlier
period. The company swung into a pretax profit of 600,000 pounds
from a 1.3 million-pound loss.  The shares climbed 17 percent to 8.63 pence as of 3:07 p.m.
in  London  trading, their highest since June 2007.  To contact the reporter on this story:
