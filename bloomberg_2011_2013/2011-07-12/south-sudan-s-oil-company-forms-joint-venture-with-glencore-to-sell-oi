South  Sudan ’s state oil company,
Nilepet, has formed a joint venture with Glencore International
Plc to market its oil, the managing director of the company said
today.  The joint venture will be called Petro Nile and will be 51
percent controlled by Nilepet and 49 percent by Glencore, Mangok
Khalil Mangok said by phone today from Juba, South Sudan’s
capital. The company will start selling South Sudanese oil in
August, he said.  Oilfields in South Sudan, which became independent on July
9, produced about 375,000 barrels of crude, pumped mainly by
China National Petroleum Corp., Malaysia’s Petroliam Nasional
Bhd. and India’s Oil & Natural Gas Corp.  The Sudanese authorities in Khartoum have been marketing
the crude and exporting it though pipelines to  Port Sudan  on the
 Red Sea . Since the end of the civil war 2005, the north and
south have split earnings from production in southern oilfields.  To contact the reporter on this story:
