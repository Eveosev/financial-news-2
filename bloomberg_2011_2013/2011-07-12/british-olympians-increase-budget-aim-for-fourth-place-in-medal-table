The head of the British Olympic
Association said the organization will increase the budget for
the 2012 Games as it aims to retain its fourth place spot in the
medals table.  The budget for British team for next year’s  London  Games
will be 13 million pounds ($21 million), up from 8 million
pounds in Beijing, British Olympic Association Chef de Mission
and CEO Andy Hunt said to journalists today in London. Hunt says
the amount per athlete will be about the same as 2008 because
there are more athletes in the 2012 team.  Hunt said the group had an “aspiration” to retain the
fourth position in the medals table reached in Beijing, although
he expects challenges from  Australia  as well as  Germany  and
other European rivals.  The British team got 47 medals from 11 sports in 2008. The
U.S. led the total medal table in Beijing with 110, followed by
 China , with 100. The hosts had the most gold medals. Russia was
third in both gold medals and total medals.  Sports Minister Hugh Robertson told reporters that the
terror threat against the 2012 Olympic Games will remain at
“severe” even though the national threat level was reduced
yesterday.  “The planning assumption is at severe,” Robertson said.
“It’s an old military thing: plan for the worst case
scenario.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
