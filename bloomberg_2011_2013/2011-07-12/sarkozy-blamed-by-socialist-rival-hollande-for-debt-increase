Francois Hollande , a potential
Socialist  rival  to French President  Nicolas Sarkozy  in elections
next year, said he would seek to cut debt and blamed the current
leader for aggravating France’s public finances.  The French Parliament is set to vote this week on a law
anchoring a balanced budget in its constitution to limit deficit
spending and to maintain its AAA rating.  Hollande said Sarkozy failed to manage finances
effectively. “His government widened deficits with tax breaks
to the most favored and pushed public debt to a record high,”
Hollande said today in a press conference in Paris.  Sarkozy’s government plans to cut its  budget deficit  to 5.7
percent of gross domestic product this year, with the economy
set to grow about 2 percent. French public debt stood at to 84.5
percent of GDP in the first quarter and will increase to 85.4
percent at the end of the year and peak at 86.9 percent next
year, the government said June 30.  Sarkozy, who has not announced his candidacy, said June 27
 France ’s AAA rating would be at risk if  the Socialist Party  wins
May 2012 elections.  “Debt is our enemy and I shall fight it if I am given the
responsibility because I am conscious of the threats we face,”
said Hollande.  To contact the reporter on this story:
