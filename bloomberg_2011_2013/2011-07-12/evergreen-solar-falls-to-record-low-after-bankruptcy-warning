Evergreen Solar Inc. (ESLR) , a
Massachusetts-based solar products maker, fell to a record low
after notifying shareholders that it may be forced to file for
bankruptcy if it is delisted.  Evergreen fell as much as 24 cents, or 39 percent, to 37
cents in Nasdaq Stock Market trading, the lowest since the
Marlboro, Massachusetts-based company went public in November
2000. The shares were trading at 41 cents at 11:44 a.m. and have
dropped 90 percent in the past year.  Nasdaq notified the company July 5 that it faces delisting
because its share price is below $1 and its market
capitalization has fallen below $35 million. It has until
January 3 to regain compliance, it said in a regulatory filing
yesterday.  If the company is delisted, holders of Evergreen’s existing
convertible notes will have the right to require it to
repurchase their notes, which Evergreen is “almost certain” it
would be unable to do, according to the filing. As a result, it
“may be forced to declare bankruptcy.”  Evergreen said it is trying to restructure its debt. The
company’s market capitalization is $16.3 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
