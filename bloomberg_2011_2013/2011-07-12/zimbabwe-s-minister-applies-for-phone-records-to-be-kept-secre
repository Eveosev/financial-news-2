Zimbabwean Finance Minister  Tendai Biti  appealed to the  High Court  to prevent the country’s mobile
operator, Econet Wireless Mobile, from releasing any information
about his phone history to police, without a valid court order.  Access to his phone record would give the police “vital
information” about the Movement for Democratic Change, of which
Biti is a lawmaker, and the Finance Ministry, Biti said in his
affidavit to the court.  In a letter to the minister’s lawyers, Econet’s chief
executive officer, Douglas Mboweni, confirmed that the police
had requested information on Biti’s communications.  To contact the reporter on this story:
