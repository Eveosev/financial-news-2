The rapeseed, or canola, harvest in
 Ukraine  was delayed by rainfall in recent days, Hamburg-based
oilseeds researcher Oil World said.  About 12 percent of the total area was harvested through
July 5, behind last year’s 21 percent, according to the report.
Yields averaged 1.07 metric tons a hectare (0.43 tons an acre),
down from 1.4 tons last year, Oil World said. Exports in the
marketing year that started on July 1 from Bulgaria, Romania,
Russia and Ukraine are expected to fall 5.9 percent to 2.8
million tons, according to the report.  “Rapeseed harvesting had a poor start in the  Black Sea
region , probably leading to some delays in new-crop exports and
creating some price firmness,” Oil World said in a report
today. “There is some concern about a detrimental impact of the
unfavorable weather conditions on harvest results.”  Rapeseed futures on NYSE Liffe in Paris have dropped 8.9
percent this year and the price on ICE Futures Canada declined
5.5 percent.  Turkish importers are having difficulties securing supplies
because of the delayed harvest in the Ukraine, Oil World said.
Imports into  Turkey  from January through May were 48,000 tons,
half the prior year, according to the report. Romanian and
Bulgarian exports to Turkey have come to a standstill owing to a
lack of supplies, the researcher said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
