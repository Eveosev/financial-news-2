Euro-area finance ministers talked
little about  Italy  at a meeting in Brussels even as the plunge
in Italian securities overshadowed their efforts to advance a
second aid package for  Greece , according to German Finance
Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble .  Italian bonds fell for a seventh day with the yield on 10-
year debt reaching the highest since 2007 today as investors
shunned the securities on concern about the country’s ability to
trim the EU’s second-biggest debt. The nation’s benchmark stock
index fell as much as 4.8 percent to a two-year low before
paring losses.  “We haven’t spoken about Italy as much as many people
expected because it is our view that the core of the problem and
the crisis is Greece, and that the question of improving the
debt sustainability in Greece is the solution to the crisis,”
Schaeuble said in Brussels after a two-day meeting of European
Union finance ministers today.  Italian Prime Minister  Silvio Berlusconi  said in an e-
mailed statement that the slide in Italian markets was a threat
to the single currency and the unity of  Europe . His government
was moving to speed the passage of a 40 billion-euro ($56
billion) deficit-cutting plan that would allow Italy to start
cutting a debt set to reach 120 percent of gross domestic
product this year.  “We have been informed that Italy will introduce and then
pass its ambitious austerity budget,” Schaeuble said. “Nobody
has any doubts that this will happen and we’re certain that
financial markets will have a more realistic view again of the
situation in Italy.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
