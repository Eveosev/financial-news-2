Wolfgang Gerke, president of the
Bavarian Center of Finance in Munich, said any potential plan by
the  European Central Bank  to double the European Union rescue
fund to 1.5 billion euros ($2.1 billion) would be
“irresponsible,”  Passauer Neue Presse  reported today, citing
an interview with Gerke.  Such “slogans” create scares and unsettle the financial
markets, Gerke said, according to the German newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
