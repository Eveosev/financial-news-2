Parmalat SpA (PLT) , the Italian dairy
company controlled by Groupe Lactalis, appointed Yvon Guerin as
chief executive officer to replace Enrico Bondi.  Guerin, the 46-year-old general manager of Lactalis’s
creamery and nutrition division, was approved unanimously by the
board as the new CEO with immediate effect, Collecchio, Italy-
based Parmalat said in a statement today.  Lactalis, the maker of President cheese, said last week
that it had increased its stake in Parmalat to 83.3 percent
after gaining management control on June 28. Olivier Savary, one
of nine Lactalis board representatives, resigned on July 8,
leaving room for the French company to install Guerin.  Bondi had been on a list of board candidates submitted on
March 18 by lender Intesa Sanpaolo SpA, which, with Silvio Berlusconi’s government, had sought to block Lactalis from
gaining control of Parmalat. Intesa withdrew its list on May 31
after Berlusconi said in April that he didn’t consider the
French company’s bid to be hostile.  As CEO, Bondi built up 1.4 billion euros ($1.96 billion) in
cash by winning settlements from the company’s former creditors
following Parmalat’s bankruptcy,  Italy ’s biggest, in 2003. He
later came under fire as activist shareholders, including
Toronto-based Mackenzie Financial Corp., called for Parmalat to
boost shareholder returns.  To contact the reporter on this story:
