Harvesting was “substantially”
delayed in  Russia ’s Southern and North Caucasus federal
districts in the first 10 days of July because of rains, the
state weather center said on its  website .  More rain forecast for North Caucasus in the next 10 days
will worsen harvesting conditions, while the weather will be
mainly satisfactory elsewhere, the Federal Hydrometeorological
Center said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
