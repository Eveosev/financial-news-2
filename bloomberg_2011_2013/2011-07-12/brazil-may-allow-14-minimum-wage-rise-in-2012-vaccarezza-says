Brazil ’s government will not try to
fight to amend a formula that will likely cause the minimum wage
to rise 14 percent next year, said Candido Vaccarezza, the
government leader in the lower house.  President  Dilma Rousseff ’s government this year won a
battle in Congress to limit the increase in the minimum wage to
6.8 percent. Sixty-six percent of Brazil’s pension and welfare
payments are linked to that wage.  The link to pensions “hasn’t caused difficulties so far,”
Vaccarezza said in an interview. “Its money that we put in the
hands of the poorest in our society, helping create a strong
consumer market.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
