Canadian natural gas fell after
earlier gains as the U.S. government forecast imports of the
power plant fuel will drop this year and next.  Canadian gas prices, which usually follow their U.S.
counterparts on the  New York  Mercantile Exchange, dropped 0.4
percent as the U.S. Energy Information Administration predicted
a drop of 3.9 percent in pipeline imports in 2011 and 4 percent
in 2012.  “This provides a bleak outlook for U.S. demand for
Canadian producers, and provides a strong supply environment for
the Canadian market for the foreseeable future,” Eric Bickel, a
commodity analyst at Summit Energy in Louisville,  Kentucky , said
in an e-mailed response to questions.  Alberta  gas for August delivery fell 1.5 cents to C$3.47
per gigajoule ($3.40 per million British thermal units) as of
4:55 p.m. New York time, according to  NGX,  a Canadian Internet
market. September gas dropped 0.75 cent to C$3.46. Gas traded on
the exchange goes to users in Canada and the U.S. and is priced
on  TransCanada Corp. (TRP) ’s Alberta system.  Natural gas on the Nymex rose 4.5 cents, or 1 percent, to
settle at $4.333 per million Btu as forecasts for above-normal
temperatures in the U.S. Midwest signaled stronger demand for
the power-plant fuel.  MDA EarthSat Weather of Gaithersburg, Maryland, predicted
the U.S. Midwest will have weather in a range of 8 to 14 degrees
Fahrenheit (4 to 8 degrees Celsius) hotter than normal until
July 21, and 5 to 7 degrees warmer until July 26.  “If it wasn’t for hot weather, we wouldn’t be up here,”
Gordy Elliott, a risk-management specialist at INTL FCStone Inc.
in  St. Louis Park ,  Minnesota , said in a telephone interview.
“This market would have crashed a while ago.”  Cooling Demand  Cooling demand will be 36 percent higher than normal in
Cleveland and almost double normal in Denver until at least July
19, said Weather Derivatives in Belton, Missouri.  The high in Indianapolis today was 92 degrees, 6 degrees
above normal, according to AccuWeather Inc. of  State College ,
 Pennsylvania .  Power plants  use 30 percent of U.S. gas supplies, and
industrial consumers account for about 28 percent, according to
Energy Department estimates.  Volume on TransCanada’s Alberta system, which collects the
output of most of the nation’s gas wells, was 15.5 billion cubic
feet as of 3:30 p.m. in New York.  Gas Flows  Gas was flowing at a daily rate of 2.87 billion cubic feet
at Empress, Alberta, where the fuel is transferred to
TransCanada’s main line.  At McNeil, Saskatchewan, where gas is transferred to the
Northern Border Pipeline for shipment to the Chicago area, the
daily flow rate was 1.77 billion cubic feet.  Available capacity on TransCanada’s British Columbia system
at Kingsgate was 998 million cubic feet. The system was forecast
to carry 1.76 billion cubic feet today, about 64 percent of its
capacity of 2.76 billion.  Gas at the Alliance Pipeline delivery point near Chicago
gained 0.1 cent to $4.4638 per million Btu as of 1:22 p.m. New
York time on the Intercontinental Exchange. Alliance is an
express line that can carry 1.5 billion cubic feet a day to the
Midwest from western  Canada .  At the Kingsgate point on the border of  Idaho  and British
Columbia, gas fell 3.5 cents, or 0.9 percent, to $4.0906.  To contact the reporter on this story:
