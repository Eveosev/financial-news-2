Banco Espanol de Credito SA (BTO) , a
retail-banking unit of  Banco Santander SA (SAN) , said second-quarter
profit declined 31 percent as lending revenue dropped and costs
for covering bad loans rose.  Net income fell to 117.4 million euros ($163.6 million)
from 170.2 million euros a year earlier, the Madrid-based
company said in a filing to regulators today. That compared with
the average estimate of 106.3 million euros in a Bloomberg
survey of four analysts.  Spanish banks including Banesto are striving to protect
earnings as lending contracts and bad loans increase, forcing
them to set aside reserves to cover losses. A surge in funding
costs as doubts about  Italy ’s finances fuel  Europe ’s debt crisis
make it hard to predict when Spanish banking earnings will
stabilize, said Carlos Joaquim Peixoto, an analyst at Banco BPI
SA in Porto,  Portugal .  “It’s still not clear whether there will be a hesitant
recovery or whether it will just be room to breathe before
taking another dive,” said Peixoto in a phone interview before
the release of earnings by Banesto, the first Spanish lender to
report second-quarter results.  Banesto fell for a sixth day, dropping 0.4 percent to 5.19
euros in Madrid. That extended this year’s decline to 16 percent
compared with an 11 percent drop in the 49-company Bloomberg
Europe Banks and Financial Services Index.  Income Rebound  While net interest income fell 11 percent to 389 million
euros from a year earlier, that’s above the low of 375 million
euros posted in the fourth quarter of 2010. That rebound comes
as the bank re-prices loans and refrains from renewing higher-
yielding deposits from a campaign to gather client savings last
year, Chief Executive Officer Jose Antonio Garcia Cantera said
on a webcast for analysts.  Lending contracted 5.7 percent to 55.7 billion euros while
deposits dropped 9.5 percent from a year ago, the bank said.  Costs for covering impairments leapt to 174.3 million euros
from 96.3 million euros a year earlier, Banesto said. The bank’s
so-called generic provisioning buffer of additional reserves on
top of those set aside for specific loans shrank to 82 million
euros in June from 411 million euros a year ago.  Bad loans as a proportion of total lending climbed to 4.39
percent from 4.15 percent in March and 3.48 percent a year
earlier. Net entries into default in the quarter climbed more
than sevenfold to 199 million euros from the preceding three
months as recoveries failed to keep pace with increased bad
loans.  To contact the reporter on this story:
