An increase in U.S. job openings in
May fell short of the jump in firings, the latest evidence that
the labor market is weakening as the economy cools.  The number of positions waiting to be filled climbed by
21,000 to 2.97 million, according to Labor Department figures
issued today in Washington. There were 1.78 million workers
discharged, up from 1.6 million in April.  “Labor demand is simply not strong enough to support a job
recovery,” Henry Mo, an economist at Credit Suisse in
 New York , said in a note to clients. There is “intense
competition among job seekers” for openings.  The  unemployment rate  rose to 9.2 percent in June while
employers added the fewest workers in nine months, Labor
Department data showed last week, indicating employers lacked
confidence to take on needed staff. Faster job growth is needed
to bring down unemployment, fuel consumer spending and keep the
economy growing.  Job openings increased 0.7 percent in May from a revised
2.95 million in April that was fewer than initially reported,
the data showed.  The gain in vacancies was led by an 83,000 increase in
professional and business services, a category that includes
accountants, managers and temporary-help agencies. Employers at
education and health services showed a 40,000 increase in
openings.  June Payrolls  Those two industries were among the ones showing the
biggest slowdown in employment in June’s payroll report released
last week, a sign that concern over the economic recovery rather
than a lack of business played a role in last month’s jobs
slump.  Hiring at professional-service companies slowed to 12,000
from 45,000 in May, while payrolls at education and health
services stagnated in June after increasing by 18,000 the prior
month, last week’s report showed.  Today’s report helps shed light on the dynamics behind the
monthly employment figures. Payrolls rose in June by 18,000
after a 25,000 gain the prior month that was less than half the
initially reported figure, Labor Department figures showed on
July 8.  Employers took on 4.07 million workers in May, or 69,000
more than the previous month, according to today’s report. Total
separations, which include firings, retirements and those who
left their jobs voluntarily, increased to 4.06 million from 3.83
million a month before.  12-Month Gain  In the 12 months ended in May, the economy created a net
0.7 million jobs, representing about 47.5 million hires,
compared with about 46.7 million separations, today’s report
showed.  Compared with the 13.9 million Americans who were
unemployed in May, today’s figures indicate there were almost 5
people vying for every opening, up from about 1.8 when the
recession began in December 2007. The number of jobless rose to
14.1 million in June, pushing the unemployment rate up from 9.1
percent the previous month, the Labor Department reported last
week.  Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT)  is among companies still trimming
staff. The world’s largest defense contractor, plans to
eliminate about 1,500 employees from its Aeronautics business
unit that makes F- 35 jet fighters, the company said June 30.  Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO) , the largest networking-equipment
company, may cut as many as 10,000 jobs, or about 14 percent of
its workforce, to revive profit growth, according to two people
familiar with the plans.  Cisco Chief Executive Officer  John Chambers  is slashing
jobs and exiting less-profitable businesses as competitors such
as Juniper Networks Inc. and Hewlett-Packard Co. take market
share in Cisco’s main businesses with lower-priced, simpler
products.  To contact the reporter on this story:
