Coffee production in  Africa  may drop
18 percent in the 2011-12 crop year due to a smaller crop in
Ethiopia, according to the  International Coffee Organization .  Output in the country, Africa’s biggest coffee grower, will
drop to 14.4 million bags next season from 17.5 million bags in
the 2010-11 crop year, the London-based organization estimates.  “The fall in production is attributable mainly to the
poorer performance of Ethiopia,” the  ICO  said in a monthly
report e-mailed today.  Coffee production in South America will fall 4.5 percent to
60.2 million bags, according to the organization. A better crop
in  Colombia , the world’s second-largest producer of arabica
beans, will partially offset a reduction in output in  Brazil ,
the ICO said.  The coffee crop in Brazil, the world’s largest grower, is
estimated to fall to 43.5 million bags from 48.1 million bags as
trees enter the lower-yielding half of a two-year cycle, the ICO
said, citing the country’s official estimates.  “According to the official estimates of the Brazilian
authorities, production in crop year 2011-12, will fall by 9.5
percent in relation to production in crop year 2010-2011,” the
ICO said. “If these estimates are confirmed, this would be the
lowest fall ever recorded for an off year,” according to the
report.  Output in  Asia  and Oceania is forecast to rise by 5.6
percent to 37.1 million bags, the ICO estimated in today’s
report. Vietnam is the world’s largest producer of robusta
coffee and  Indonesia  is the third largest.  Arabica coffee is grown mainly in  Latin America  and favored
for specialty beverages such as those made by Starbucks Corp.
Robusta, used in instant coffee and espresso, is harvested
mostly in Asia and parts of Africa.  Production in  Mexico  and Central America will climb by 4.2
percent to 18.3 million bags on improved harvests in Mexico,
Guatemala and Nicaragua, according to the ICO.  World output will be about 130 million bags, down from
133.3 million bags in 2010-11, the organization said. Arabica
bean output will fall by 6.2 percent to 78.3 million bags, while
the robusta crop will expand by 3.9 percent to 51.7 million
bags, the ICO estimated.  Global coffee consumption was estimated at 134 million bags
in the 2010 calendar year, up from 131.3 million bags in 2009,
it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
