Palestinian Authority President
 Mahmoud Abbas  expressed disappointment that the Middle East
Quartet failed to issue a statement after meeting yesterday in
Washington in an effort to restart Israeli-Palestinian talks.  Differences that remain between Israelis and Palestinians
are too great for negotiations to restart anytime soon, said a
U.S. official who requested anonymity because he wasn’t
authorized to speak publicly. Quartet representatives, led by
Secretary of State  Hillary Clinton , expressed support for
President Barack Obama’s proposal to resolve the Israeli-
Palestinian conflict by starting with the 1967 borders, the
official said.  The lack of an official statement from the Quartet,
comprised of the U.S., United Nations, European Union and
Russia, “is a bad sign because it means they have
differences,” Abbas said in Ramallah today after meeting with
Greek President Karolos Papoulias. If the Quartet cannot restart
the negotiations, Palestinians will have “no choice but the
 United Nations ,” Abbas told reporters, referring to a plan to
seek statehood recognition at the UN General Assembly in
September.  Israel and the U.S. oppose the move. Before going into the
talks, Clinton repeated her assertion that talks were the only
way to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian impasse.  To contact the reporter on this story:
