Minister Susan Shabangu may lose her post in a reshuffle of
President  Jacob Zuma â€™s Cabinet, Business Day said, without
saying where it got the information.  Shabangu may be replaced by her deputy, Godfrey Oliphant,
while Police Minister Nathi Mthethwa may replace Cooperative
Governance and Traditional Affairs Minister Sicelo Shiceka, the
Johannesburg-based newspaper said, without citing anyone for the
information. Zuma may announce the changes after a four-day
national executive committee meeting of the ruling  African
National Congress  that begins in two days, it said.  Sports Minister Fikile Mbalula may replace Mthethwa,
Business Day said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
