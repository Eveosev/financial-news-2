Nigeria shut the University of
Maiduguri in the northeastern Borno state over the threat of
violence from the Islamic sect, Boko Haram,  Daily Trust 
reported, citing a statement by the institution.  The students who were to begin their first semester
examinations on Aug. 15 were asked to vacate the campus by noon
yesterday, the Abuja-based newspaper said. The school will
remain closed until the security situation improves, it said.  Nigerian security forces launched an attack on suspected
Boko Haram members in Maiduguri over the weekend, Trust said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
