Deepali Bhargava, an economist at
the Indian unit of ING Groep NV in Mumbai, comments on  India ’s
industrial production.  Output at factories, utilities and mines rose 5.6 percent
from a year earlier, the government said today. The median of 27
estimates in a Bloomberg News survey was for an 8.5 percent
jump.  The  Reserve Bank  of India has increased  interest rates  10
times since the start of 2010, the longest streak of monetary
tightening in a decade, to curb inflation that accelerated to
9.06 percent in May.  Bhargava spoke in a phone interview from Mumbai.  “The consumption side seems to have been impacted, finally
feeling the pinch of the higher rates. The numbers going forward
may not be so well going forward as the consumption pattern is
starting to get affected.  ‘‘The central bank’s priority will still remain of
tempering inflation. The 5.6 percent output number is still not
abysmally low, we have seen worse numbers. We may see over 7
percent industrial production for the whole year, which is well
in line for the central bank’s overall growth projection.  ‘‘The latest number strengthens the case for a 25 basis
point increase in rates rather than a more aggressive one.  ‘‘It is looking like that inflation may be higher than the
projections. So the central bank won’t give dovish signals but
at the same time a more hawkish stance is something that won’t
happen.’’  To contact the reporter on this story:
