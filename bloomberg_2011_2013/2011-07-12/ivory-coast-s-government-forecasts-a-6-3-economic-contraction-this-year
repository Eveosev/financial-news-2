Ivory Coast ’s government expects the
economy to contract 6.3 percent this year after a political
crisis disrupted business activity, it said in a letter to the
International Monetary Fund.  Inflation may slow to 3 percent by year end from an average
of 5.2 percent in the first quarter, the government said in the
letter, which was published on the IMF’s website late yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
