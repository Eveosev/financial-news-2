South African steel and engineering
companies boosted a pay offer to workers in a bid to end a
strike that started on July 4, said the  National Union of
Metalworkers of South Africa , or Numsa.  The companies raised the offer from 7 percent, Karl Cloete,
deputy general secretary of the labor union, said by phone,
declining to give details of the new wage package. Numsa’s
governing committee will meet tomorrow to discuss the union’s
response, he said.  “The strike will continue while we continue to
negotiate,” Cloete said. “Wages, the use of labor brokers and
the duration of the agreement are the three remaining sticking
points.”  Numsa is demanding a 13 percent pay increase, compared with
the current inflation rate of 4.6 percent. The differences
between the two parties “is substantial and it appears unlikely
that an early resolution to the strike is possible,” David
Carson, the Steel and Engineering Industries Federation of  South
Africa ’s executive director, said in an e-mailed statement from
Johannesburg today.  Other trade unions, including the 70,000-strong Chemical,
Energy, Paper, Printing and Allied Workers’ Union have also
began  strike action  this month.  Numsa said it has about 320,000 workers on strike.  To contact the reporter on this story:
