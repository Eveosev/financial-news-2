Gold may climb to an all-time high
once it breaks out of a shrinking range, according to  technical
analysis  from Dhiren Sarin at  Barclays Capital .  The metal for immediate delivery has formed a triangulating
pattern in the past two months, with prices held in narrowing
bands, Singapore-based Sarin said in a phone interview today.  Bullion advanced as much as 0.8 percent to $1,557.05 an
ounce yesterday, the most expensive since June 22, and traded at
$1,553.15 an ounce today. The metal denominated in euros and
pounds reached an all-time peak.  “Gold is trying to push through the current range,” Sarin
said. “It will reach a new all-time high” if the price exceeds
$1,558, he said. Bullion advanced to a record $1,577.57 on May 2.  The price increased 4.4 percent in the past seven days on
concern  Europe ’s sovereign-debt crisis may spread to Italy and
Spain and on signs of slowing global growth. Gold is heading for
its 11th year of gains, the best performance since at least 1920.  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to predict changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index. Some analysts and traders use a
combination of indicators and levels to form both short- and
long-term forecasts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
