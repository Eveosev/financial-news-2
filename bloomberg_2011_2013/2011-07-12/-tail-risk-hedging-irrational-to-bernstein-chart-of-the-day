Investors seeking to avoid losses
are better off spreading around their money than buying assets
that are supposed to protect against the risk of highly unusual
events, according to Richard Bernstein, chief executive officer
of an investment firm bearing his name.  “Today’s concerns regarding the need to hedge ‘tail
risk’” are irrational, Bernstein wrote in a July 7 report.
Paying to minimize this threat doesn’t make as much sense as
diversifying, he added.  The CHART OF THE DAY compares the total return on a
Treasury bond exchange-traded fund, run by BlackRock Inc.’s
iShares unit, with Hedge Fund Research Inc.’s composite index
for the five years ended in June. Bernstein used a similar chart
in the report to support his conclusion, based on a traditional
view that investors should own bonds as well as stocks.  The ETF had a higher total return “despite all the hoopla
regarding the risk of Treasuries and the growing acceptance of
tail hedging,” he wrote. The iShares fund’s 38 percent return
beat the hedge-fund gauge by 12 percentage points.  Holding onto investments will also reduce the odds of
losses, according to Bernstein, who showed this by analyzing
data on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index from January 1930 until
last month. While the  S&P 500  fell on 47 percent of the trading
days, the comparable figure for 10-year periods was 11 percent,
the report said.  “Longer time horizons and traditional  asset allocation  are
more effective investment strategies than are short-term trading
and tail-risk hedging,” he wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
