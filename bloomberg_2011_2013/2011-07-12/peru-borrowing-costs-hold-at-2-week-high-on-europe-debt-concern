Peru’s benchmark borrowing costs in
dollars held at a two-week high as concern mounted that  Europe ’s
government-debt crisis threatens to spread from Greece to the
bigger economies of Italy and Spain.  The extra yield investors demand to own Peruvian  government
bonds  instead of U.S. Treasuries was unchanged at 1.86
percentage point at 12:47 p.m.  New York  time, according to
JPMorgan Chase & Co.  European finance chiefs met today to look for ways to cut
Greece’s debt burden as the contagion spread to Italy. Ministers
floated ideas from bond buybacks to a temporary Greek default in
an overhaul of a strategy that has failed to contain the debt
panic in the region.  “You’re getting increasing headwinds from the European
debt crisis and that’s beginning to have an impact on the entire
Latin American sovereign class,” said  Enrique Alvarez , head of
Latin America fixed-income research at IdeaGlobal in New York.
“Peru’s been going through the same sort of back and forth
related to the contagion coming from Europe and the positive of
low rates in the developed world for a long time ahead.”  The yield on the nation’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol-
denominated bond due August 2020 fell 1 basis point, or 0.01
percentage point, to 6.30 percent, according to prices compiled
by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
