Shares of the following companies
had unusual moves in Taiwan trading. Stock symbols are in

drop was the steepest since March 15.  Chip companies:  Inotera Memories Inc. (3474)  (3474 TT) slid 6.9
percent to NT$8.08, the lowest close since Jan. 5, 2009, while
 Powerchip Technology Corp. (5346)  (5346 TT) sank 6.9 percent to

December, according to data by TrendForce Corp.’s DRAMExchange.  Acer Inc. (2353)  (2353 TT) lost 4.3 percent to NT$41.90, the
lowest close since Feb. 2, 2009. The world’s second-largest
laptop computer maker said June sales fell 28 percent from a
year earlier to NT$31.94 billion ($1.1 billion).  Compal Electronics Inc. (2324)  (2324 TT) dropped 2.7 percent to
NT$34, the biggest drop since March 28. The world’s second-
largest contract maker of notebooks shipped 10.8 million
notebooks during the second quarter, 5 percent more than the
previous three-month period, the Taipei-based company said in an
e-mail yesterday. Compal had forecast shipment growth of as much
as 10 percent for the period.  Chipbond Technology Corp. (6147)  (6147 TT) slid 6.9 percent to
NT$35.10, the lowest close since March 8, 2010. The chip
packaging company was cut to “hold” from “buy” at Samsung
Securities Co., which said the company’s earnings will be lower
than analysts’ estimate as a decreasing factory usage rate
erodes profitability.  HTC Corp. (2498)  (2498 TT) retreated 6.9 percent to NT$915, the
lowest close since Jan. 24.  Asia ’s second-largest maker of
smartphones was accused of infringing Apple Inc. patents in a
case that may halt U.S. imports of the Taiwanese company’s
phones and its new Flyer tablet computers.  HTC continues to “vehemently deny” all of Apple’s past
and present claims against it and will continue to protect and
defend its own intellectual property, said Grace Lei, HTC’s
general counsel.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
