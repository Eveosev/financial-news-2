Three incidents involving trains that killed more than 100 people  over the the last week naturally caused a public uproar in India, as citizens considered afresh the risks involved in using the services of Indian Railways, an organization that calls itself the "lifeline to the nation" on its  Website . In the early hours of  July 7, 38 people were killed and at least as many injured when  a train collided  with a bus carrying members of a wedding party at an unmanned level crossing in the northern  state of  Uttar Pradesh . Then, on July 10, at least 68 people were killed and more than  250 injured when 15 bogies of the Howrah-Kalka Mail  careered off the tracks , again in Uttar Pradesh, while the train was travelling at more than  60 miles (100 kilometers) per hour. The  exact cause  of the derailment couldn't be immediately ascertained, even from the drivers of the train, who regained consciousness in hospital the next day. That evening,  six coaches  of the Guwahati-Puri Express derailed in Assam after a bomb was set off on the tracks, injuring more than 100 people. It is likely that a  local insurgent group  in  India 's troubled north-east was responsible. These events established many things: that the price of a life in India continues to be far too cheap, that inefficiency and neglect continue to be as much a threat as terrorism, that the railways are in urgent need of reform and careful direction, that emergency-response mechanisms in most parts of the country  remain rudimentary , and, finally, that this was a problem for which the  UPA government  was clearly culpable. For two months, the country has been without a full -time railway minister . The last holder of the post,  Mamata Banerjee , resigned in May to become chief minister of West Bengal after her party, the Trinamool Congress, won the  state elections . But the Railway Ministry has also long been held hostage to the pathologies of coalition politics, as powerful regional parties have laid claim to it as a condition of their support of the Indian National Congress and then used it as a  tool of patronage . This crisis affects almost everyone in the country. Indian Railways, which has a monopoly on train travel and is the largest railway system under single management in the world, carries about 19 million passengers every day across long distances on about 7,000 trains that run the length and breadth of the country, on a network cumulatively about 40,000 miles in length. While the services aren't of the highest standard, fares are absurdly cheap, meaning that the railways enjoy a measure of  good will with the Indian public that almost no other service operated by the government does. There is almost no train on which tickets aren't always sold out. Many poor and middle-class Indians spend extensive amounts of their time riding the rails, and even the rich often use the railways to travel short distances in air-conditioned comfort. The reminder that one of the most common Indian experiences could be fatal was a cause of great distress to many Indians, who commiserated with the family and friends of the dead and sought to ask hard questions of the government. An editorial in the  Deccan Chronicle  pointed out that the accidents weren't especially surprising, since: And in a somewhat incoherent, but nonetheless revealing, report about the Kalka Mail mishap titled " Politics Makes Delhi-Howrah Route Corridor of Death ," Mahendra Kumar Singh wrote in The Times of India: In the Hindustan Times,  Srinand Jha wrote : And the Indian Express observed in an  editorial : The incidents  occurred as the government was preparing a  reshuffle of the Cabinet . When the list of new ministers was announced, it was no surprise to find that the Trinamool Congress had retained control of the Indian Railways portfolio, nominating one of its lawmakers,  Dinesh Trivedi , for the job. Predictably, the new railway minister announced that safety would be his top priority, but in a  television interview  he gave a rambling and disingenuous answer to a question about his party appearing to have a monopoly over the Railway Ministry. It was hard to shake off the suspicion that even the loss of more than 100 lives hasn't been enough to wake the government up to the extent of the crisis affecting one of its most important services.
