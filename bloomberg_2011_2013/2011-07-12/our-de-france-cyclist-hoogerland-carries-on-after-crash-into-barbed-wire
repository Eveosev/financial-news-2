Dutch cyclist Johnny Hoogerland
completed today’s  Tour de France  stage, two days after he needed
33 stitches for injuries caused when a car veered into a group
of riders and he was catapulted into a barbed-wire fence.  The 28-year-old retained the polka-dot jersey as the top-
ranked climber after the 98-mile 10th stage over rolling terrain
between Aurillac and Carmaux. He finished 111th today, almost
six minutes behind the leading pack of riders.  “He’s not doing the best, but it’s the Tour de France and
he’s in the polka-dot jersey,” Ard Bierens, a spokesman for his
Vacansoleil team, said by telephone before the stage. Hoogerland
managed a 25-mile training ride on the rest day yesterday,
Bierens added.  On the ninth stage, a  France  Television car swerved on a
narrow road to avoid a tree on the side, hitting Team Sky’s Juan
Antonio Flecha and causing Hoogerland to crash. The riders made
a statement to police as part of a standard inquiry into road
accidents, Bierens said.  Hoogerland needed stitches on the front and back of his leg
and on his backside, Bierens added.  Spain ’s Flecha suffered
whiplash and gashes, Team Sky said on its website. He came 97th
today.  France Television apologized to the riders in a statement,
 Agence France-Presse  reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
