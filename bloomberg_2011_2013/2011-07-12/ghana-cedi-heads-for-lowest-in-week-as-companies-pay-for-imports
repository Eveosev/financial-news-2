Ghana ’s cedi headed for the lowest
close in more than a week against the dollar as manufacturers
bought the U.S. currency to pay for imports of raw materials and
equipment.  The cedi depreciated as much as 0.8 percent to 1.5255 per
dollar and traded 0;2 percent down at 1.5163 by 1:05 p.m. in the
capital, Accra. A close at this level would be the weakest since
July 1.  “There was quite a level of demand from manufacturers
today,” Chris Nettey, a currency trader at Stanbic Bank Ghana
Ltd., said in a telephone interview today. “They needed the
dollars to import raw materials to keep their plants going.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
