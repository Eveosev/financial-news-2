Kenya ’s shilling depreciated the
most in two weeks against the dollar as concern that  Europe ’s
debt crisis will worsen curbed demand for higher-yielding,
frontier-market assets.  The currency of East Africa’s biggest economy weakened for
a second day, losing as much as 0.7 percent to 91.00 per dollar
and traded 0.2 percent down at 90.50 per dollar by 1 p.m. in
Nairobi, the capital, from yesterday’s close of 90.33. A close
at this level will be the lowest since June 27.  Nine hours of talks yesterday by European finance chiefs
resulted in a six-paragraph statement in which the 17 euro
governments pledged to flesh out a new master plan “shortly”
to end the 21-month-old crisis, without setting a timeline. The
meetings resumed today with all 27 European Union finance
ministers planning a response to the release of bank stress
tests later this week.  “The shilling is under pressure due to the flight to
safety by investors who are buying dollars as the euro debt
crisis remain unresolved,” Bernard Matimu, chief dealer at
Nairobi-based NIC Bank Ltd., said in a phone interview today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
