Dutch Finance Minister  Jan Kees de Jager  said a selective default by  Greece  “is not excluded
anymore.”  Euro-area finance ministers yesterday “did not exclude” a
selective default during a meeting on Greece, “so we have more
options, a broader scope to work with,” de Jager told reporters
in Brussels today.  European Union finance chiefs today will discuss stress
tests on the region’s banks. De Jager declined to comment on the
tests before the talks. “We are going to listen first,” he
said. “It’s very important to have credible stress tests. I am
going to listen first and then I can comment on it later.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
