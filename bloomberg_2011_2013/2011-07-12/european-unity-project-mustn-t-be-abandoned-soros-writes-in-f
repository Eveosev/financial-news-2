The European status quo has become
untenable, yet it should still be possible to mobilize a
“silent majority” in favour of further advance toward a united
Europe, said  George Soros , the billionaire investor.  Writing in the Financial Times, Soros said the euro was
from the start an incomplete currency, in the sense that it had
a central bank but no treasury, and its architects thought,
wrongly, that markets would correct their own excesses; hence
they set up rules designed to stop only public-sector excesses.  The excesses, however, were mainly in the private sector,
as interest-rate convergence generated economic divergence;
lower rates in the weaker countries led to housing bubbles,
while the strongest country,  Germany , had to keep a tight rein
to cope with reunification; and finance was compromised by the
spread of risky financial instruments and unsound lending
practices, Soros said.  As integration has turned into disintegration,  Europe ’s
political establishment has turned from spearheading further
unification to defending the status quo, he said.  A Greek default may be inevitable, but it needn’t be
disorderly; the rest of the eurozone must be safeguarded, and
that means strengthening it through a wider use of Eurobonds and
a eurozone deposit-insurance arrangement, Soros concluded.  To contact the reporter on this story:
