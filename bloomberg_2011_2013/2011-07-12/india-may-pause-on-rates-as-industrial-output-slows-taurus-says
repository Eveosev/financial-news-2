R.K. Gupta, managing director of
Taurus Asset Management Ltd., which manages $1.1 billion in
assets, comments after India’s industrial production growth
unexpectedly slowed in May. He spoke by phone from  New Delhi .  Output at factories, utilities and mines rose 5.6 percent
from a year ago following a revised 5.8 percent gain in the
previous month, the  Central Statistical Office  said today. The
median of 27 estimates in a Bloomberg News survey was for an 8.5
percent jump.  The Bombay Stock Exchange Sensitive Index fell 1 percent to
18,525.77 as of 12:13 p.m. in Mumbai, set for a two-week low.  “The numbers show that Indian companies are shying away
from making investments and are shifting their investments
overseas market. Growth is slowing and this trend is unlikely to
reverse given the geopolitical scenario in the country. We
haven’t seen enough in terms of decision-making from the
government.”  On stock markets:  “Indian equities continue to be driven by foreign fund
flows. The slowdown in industrial output may force the central
bank to pause on rates at its July 26 meeting, which could act
as a positive and bring some relief for the markets.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
