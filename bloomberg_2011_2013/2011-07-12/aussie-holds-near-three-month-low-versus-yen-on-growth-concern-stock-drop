The Australian and  New Zealand 
dollars rose versus the majority of their most-traded peers
after  China’s economy  and industrial output grew more than
forecast, fueling appetite for higher-yielding assets.  New Zealand’s dollar, nicknamed the kiwi, gained against
its U.S. counterpart for the first time in three days, trading
at almost a record high as stocks and commodities rallied. The
Aussie gained for the first time in four days versus the
greenback, rallying from a two-week low yesterday.  Today’s economic data “does break the recent string toward
disappointment from numbers out of China,” said  Todd Elmer ,
head of Group-of-10 currency strategy for Asia ex-Japan at
Citigroup Inc. in Singapore. “It could help to ease some of the
downward pressure on the Aussie and kiwi.”  The New Zealand dollar advanced 2.1 percent to 83.59 U.S.
cents at 12:04 p.m. in  New York , from 81.81 cents yesterday,
when it dropped to 81.11, its lowest level since June 29. It
touched 83.86 cents on July 8, the highest since the currency
was freely floated in 1985. The kiwi climbed 1.9 percent versus
the yen to 66.04, from 64.82.  Australia’s dollar strengthened 1.6 percent against the
 U.S. dollar  to $1.0766, from $1.0598 yesterday. The Aussie
gained 1.3 percent to 85.03 yen, from 83.98 yen.  China’s gross domestic product expanded 9.5 percent in the
second quarter from a year earlier, the statistics bureau said
in Beijing today. The median estimate was for a 9.3 percent
increase in a Bloomberg News survey of economists. Industrial
output advanced 15.1 percent in June, the most since May 2010.  The MSCI World Index of stocks rose 1.5 percent, and the
Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of 19 raw materials advanced
1.5 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
