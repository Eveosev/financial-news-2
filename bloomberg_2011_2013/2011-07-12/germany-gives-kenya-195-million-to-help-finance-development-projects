Germany  will provide Kenya, east
Africaâ€™s biggest economy, with 140 million euros ($195 million)
of funding for development projects, President Mwai Kibaki said.  The two countries will also form a joint group to boost
investments, Kibaki told reporters in the Kenyan capital,
Nairobi, today after meeting with German Chancellor  Angela Merkel . The funds will be disbursed between 2010 and 2013,
Kibaki said.  German investors should explore investment opportunities in
infrastructure projects such as the planned construction of a
port in Lamu and the Lamu-Ethiopia-South Sudan rail, road and
pipeline link, he said.  Kenya and Germany agreed that the European nation would
look to boost investments in energy, transport and the
environment, Kenyan Prime Minister  Raila Odinga  said after
