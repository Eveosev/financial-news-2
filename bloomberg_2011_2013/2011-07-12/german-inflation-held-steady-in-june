Inflation in  Germany , Europe’s
largest economy, held steady in June as energy costs retreated.  The inflation rate, calculated using a harmonized European
Union method, held at 2.4 percent from May, the Federal
Statistics Office in Wiesbaden said today, confirming an initial
estimate published June 28. From May, prices remained unchanged.  While crude  oil prices  retreated 7 percent in June, they’re
still 26 percent higher than a year ago.  European Central Bank 
President Jean-Claude Trichet on July 7 raised borrowing costs
for a second time this year, saying euro-region inflation will
hold above the central bank’s 2 percent limit in the coming
months.  “Consumer prices rose very little in June, which can be
ascribed to a decline in energy prices,” said  Klaus Baader , an
economist at Societe Generale in London. “In Germany, inflation
rates reflect the economy’s robust economic growth.”  On a non-harmonized basis, inflation remained unchanged at
2.3 percent in June and consumer prices rose 0.1 percent in the
month, the statistics office said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
