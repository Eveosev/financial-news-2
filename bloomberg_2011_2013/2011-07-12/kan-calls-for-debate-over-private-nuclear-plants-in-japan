Japan’s Prime Minister  Naoto Kan 
said the country must consider whether private companies should
administer nuclear power stations in light of the disaster at a
crippled reactor in Fukushima prefecture.  “Given the scale of the risk of a nuclear accident, I
agree that debates are needed on whether private companies can
take on the burden,” Kan said in parliament today. “In some
other countries, it’s not necessarily the case” that private
firms are involved, he said.  Kan’s remarks during a lawmaker session on reconstruction
following the March 11 earthquake and tsunami come amid a debate
on the country’s future energy policy. Kan said earlier today
the country should scrap its plan to boost nuclear energy to 53
percent by 2030.  Japan ’s government said yesterday it would keep nuclear
reactors shut until after the completion of safety tests amid
concerns about energy shortages this summer.  The earthquake and tsunami crippled Tokyo Electric Power
Co.’s Fukushima Dai-Ichi plant, sparking the worst nuclear
disaster since Chernobyl. Almost two-thirds of Japan’s 54
reactors have been shut by the disaster or because of regular
checks, leading to power-saving measures in parts of the
country.  To contact the reporter on this story:
