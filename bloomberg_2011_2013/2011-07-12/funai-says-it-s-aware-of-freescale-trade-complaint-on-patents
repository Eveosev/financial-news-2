Funai Electric Co., a Japanese maker
of audiovisual equipment, said it knew Freescale Semiconductor
Inc. filed a complaint to the U.S. International Trade
Commission on June 8 alleging patent infringement and seeking to
block imports of certain chips.
　　“We also learned on July 8 that USITC started
investigations in that case,” Naoyuki Takanaka, a spokesman at
Osaka-based Funai, said by telephone today. Takanaka said the
products in dispute include Funai televisions that use
semiconductors and declined to give further details.
　　The U.S. trade agency agreed to review the complaint by
Freescale against Funai Electric Co., Funai Corp., Mediatek and
Zoran Corp., it  said  on its website yesterday. This is Funai’s
second trade dispute with Freescale, Takanaka said.
　　Freescale filed a complaint on March 1 last year claiming
that Panasonic Corp., Funai and JVC Kenwood Holdings Inc., as
well as retailers such as Best Buy Co. and Wal-Mart Stores Inc.,
are violating Freescale’s patent rights.
