Digiturk, which owns the
broadcasting rights to  Turkey ’s first division soccer, is
offering erotic channels to subscribers who say they’ll cancel
if title-holder Fenerbahce is relegated amid match-fixing
allegations,  Sabah  reported.  The digital satellite broadcaster, owned by Turkey’s
Cukurova Holding AS and U.S.-based Providence Equity Partners
Inc., told the country’s soccer federation it may seek renewal
of a contract it won in 2010 to broadcast matches for four
years, the newspaper said, without saying where it got the
information. Digiturk has 1 million subscribers for its LigTV
and pays the federation about $400 million a year under the
contract, Sabah said.  A match-fixing investigation is casting uncertainty over
Turkey’s 500 million-euro ($720 million) “soccer economy,”
Hurriyet reported July 6.  The income of Istanbul’s big three clubs, Fenerbahce,
Galatasaray and Besiktas, totaled more than 600 million liras
($370 million) last year, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
