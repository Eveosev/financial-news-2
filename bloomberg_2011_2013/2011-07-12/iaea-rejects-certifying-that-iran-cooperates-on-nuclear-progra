The United Nations atomic agency
chief rejected calls from  Iran  for the UN to certify the Persian
Gulf nation is cooperating with some nuclear verification
measures.  The IAEA “is not in a position” to make such a
declaration, International Atomic Energy Agency Director General
Yukiya Amano said after a 40-minute meeting today in Vienna with
Iranian Foreign Minister  Ali Akbar Salehi . Iran “is not meeting
its obligations,” he said.  Salehi told reporters after the meeting that Iran is ready
to work “closer than before” with IAEA inspectors if the
agency acknowledges that the government in Tehran has fulfilled
some nuclear verification measures.  Iran asked the IAEA to consider ways to break the nuclear
deadlock that has resulted in four sets of UN Security Council
sanctions against the country.  Iran has been the subject of IAEA inspections since 2003.
The U.S. and  Europe  accuse the Iranian government of hiding
nuclear-weapons work. Iran, with the world’s second-biggest
natural gas reserves, insists that it is enriching uranium for
nuclear power.  To contact the reporter on this story:
