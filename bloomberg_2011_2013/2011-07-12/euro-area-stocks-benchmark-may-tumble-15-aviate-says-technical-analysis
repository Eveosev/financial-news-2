The benchmark Euro Stoxx 50 Index
may tumble a further 15 percent if it ends the week below a
support level of 2,700, according to a technical analyst at
Aviate Global LLP.  “Our concern for several weeks has been the ability for
the Euro Stoxx 50 to hold its 2,700 support level,” Riccardo Ronco, head of  technical analysis  at Aviate Global, said in e-
mailed comments yesterday. The “technical outlook is anything
but bullish for the medium term.”  If the Euro Stoxx 50 breaches 2,700, the “most likely”
next area of support is at 2,300 to 2,400, Ronco said. That’s as
much as 15 percent below yesterday’s close of 2,709.14 in the
benchmark gauge for euro-area equities. The measure has plunged
12 percent from this year’s high in February as contagion from
 Greece ’s debt crisis threatens to spread to the bigger economies
of Italy and  Spain .  In the U.S., the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index is “much
stronger on a relative basis,” Ronco said. He said a weekly
close below 1,250 would push the  S&P 500  down to the 1,100 to
1,150 level.  To contact the reporter on this story:
