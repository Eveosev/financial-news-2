Ethiopia ’s inflation rate climbed to
38.1 percent in June from a year earlier as food costs increased
and the central bank boosted the money supply.  Inflation accelerated from 34.7 percent in May, the Central
Statistical Agency, based in the capital,  Addis Ababa , said in
an e-mailed statement today. Food prices surged 45.3 percent in
June after rising 40.7 percent in the previous month, it said.  Drought in East  Africa  has pushed up food prices in the
region, with 4.57 million Ethiopians requiring food aid for the
rest of the year, State Minister of Agriculture Mitiku Kassa
said yesterday. Money supply growth of as much as 40 percent has
played a “significant role” in rising prices, Prime Minister
Meles Zenawi said on July 5.  Inflation may undermine economic growth in Ethiopia,
Africa’s largest coffee producer, the  International Monetary
Fund  said on May 31. The economy will probably expand 6 percent
in the fiscal year through July 7, 2012 from 7.5 percent in the
past year, the IMF said.  Ethiopian authorities brought inflation down to 5.3 percent
in August 2010 from a peak of 64.2 percent in July 2008. A 17.5
percent devaluation of the Ethiopian birr against the dollar on
September 1 boosted import costs, pushing up inflation since
then.  To contact the reporter on this story:
