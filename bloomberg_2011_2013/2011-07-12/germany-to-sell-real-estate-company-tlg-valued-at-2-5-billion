Germany ’s government revived a plan
to sell the property-management company that replaced Treuhand
Gesellschaft to take advantage of the improving property market.  TLG Immobilien GmbH , a Berlin-based company that owns real
estate in eastern Germany, will be split into two companies that
will be sold separately to attract more bidders, the  Finance
Ministry  said in a statement yesterday.  Following Germany’s reunification in 1990, Treuhand oversaw
the sale and restructuring of thousands of companies in the
country’s six eastern states. TLG has managed assets since 2000
and reported net income of about 20 million euros for 2010,
according to the statement. TLG’s assets are valued at about
1.76 billion euros ($2.5 billion).  TLG owns homes, office buildings, hotels and retirement
homes in eastern Germany, mainly on the Baltic Sea coast and in
Berlin, Halle and Leipzig. The sale was initially planned for
2008 and was shelved in November of that year because of the
global recession.  TLG used the interim period to “optimize its portfolio
further, improve its efficiency and thoroughly prepare for the
privatization,” the ministry said. The government expects a
favorable price due to a “very positive” real-estate
environment in Germany, according to the statement.  To contact the reporters on this story:
