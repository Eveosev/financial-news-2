Ethanol rose to a four-week high in
 Chicago  after the government forecast smaller-than-expected corn
stockpiles and on tighter supply of the biofuel.  The grain-based gasoline additive gained after the
Agriculture Department estimated corn inventories before next
year’s harvest may total 870 million bushels, the lowest since
1996, raising ethanol production costs. Supply of ethanol is the
lowest since January, according to the Energy Department.  “You’re seeing tight corn inventories combined with tight
physical ethanol markets in Chicago and that’s being reflected
in the forward curve,” said Michael Breitenbach, an analyst and
trader at Blue Ocean Brokerage LLC in New York.  Denatured ethanol for August delivery advanced 5.6 cents,
or 2 percent, to settle at $2.769 a gallon on the Chicago Board
of Trade, the highest price since June 13. Futures have gained
16 percent this year.  In cash market trading, ethanol in the U.S. Gulf soared 7
cents, or 2.6 percent, to $2.815 a gallon and in  New York  the
biofuel increased 6.5 cents, or 2.3 percent, to $2.92, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol in Chicago added 5 cents, or 1.8 percent, to $2.825
a gallon and on the West Coast the additive gained 0.5 cent to
$2.92.  Stockpiles of the fuel are at 18.6 million barrels,
according to the latest Energy Department data, the lowest since
Jan. 28.  Corn futures for December delivery rose 25.25 cents, or 4
percent, to close at $6.58 a bushel in Chicago, after touching
$6.61, the highest for the most-active contract since June 29.  To contact the reporter on this story:
