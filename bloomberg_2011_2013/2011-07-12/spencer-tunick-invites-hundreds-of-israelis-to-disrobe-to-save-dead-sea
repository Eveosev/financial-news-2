Spencer Tunick, the artist known for
gathering together hundreds of naked volunteers, is asking
Israelis to disrobe to raise awareness of the shrinking  Dead
Sea .  Tunick is going ahead with the project after raising more
than $100,000 in an Internet campaign, his Israeli partner Avi
Fruchter said, adding that the fundraising was continuing.  The Dead Sea , popular for the restorative powers of its mud
baths and mineral waters, is dropping more than three feet (a
meter) a year, marine experts said. The drop is caused by the
diversion of agricultural and drinking water and dry winters.  U.S.-born  Tunick , 44, has photographed large groups of
naked people at the Big Chill Festival in the U.K., and cities
including London, Amsterdam, Sydney and  Buenos Aires . In 2007,
together with Greenpeace, 600 volunteers posed naked for him on
 Europe ’s Aletsch glacier to illustrate humanity’s tragic
relationship with the climate.  “The environmental impact is alarming and through my work
I hope to bring it back to life,” Tunick said in an e-mailed
statement, “showcasing the importance of water in this region
and creating art with the naked human form that brings world
attention to the need to save the Dead Sea.”  The installation will take place on Sept. 17 at the Dead
Sea shore.  To contact the reporters on this story:
