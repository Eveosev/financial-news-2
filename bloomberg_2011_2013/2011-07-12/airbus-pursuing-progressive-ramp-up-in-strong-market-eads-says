Airbus SAS, the world’s biggest
commercial planemaker, will continue to ramp up jetliner
production “progressively” as orders climb, the head of parent
company European Aeronautic, Defence & Space Co. said today.  “The market is very good for the time being,” EADS Chief
Executive Officer  Louis Gallois  said in an in interview. The jet
market “goes up and down” and Airbus is tapping current demand
by “increasing the production rate of all our planes,” he said.  Airbus won more orders in the first half than in the whole
of 2010 while handing over 258 planes to customers, only eight
more than in the first six months of 2010, it said July 7. The
Toulouse, France-based company will carry on boosting output of
its A320, A330 and A380 models to manage the backlog, Gallois
said at the opening of a factory in Ghimbav, central Romania.  A380 superjumbo output will reach 25 planes this year,
Gallois said, declining to disclose the rate for 2012 because
it’s “market-sensitive.” Production of the widebody A330 is at
8.5 a month and will rise to 10 by mid-2013, while the single-
aisle A320 will go from 38 jets a month in August to 42 in the
second part of next year, he reiterated.  Airbus, the No. 1 planemaker since overtaking  Boeing Co. (BA)  in
2003, is ramping up the build rate as airlines and leasing
companies refresh their fleets with more fuel-efficient planes.  Boeing produced 31.5 of its 737 narrowbodies in March and
that’s set to rise in two steps to 38 by 2013 and as high as 42
later. The Chicago-based company delivered 222 planes in the
first half, unchanged from a year earlier.  Romanian Investment  EADS’s Premium Aerotec unit is spending more than 40
million euros ($56 million) on the Ghimbav factory, which will
manufacture and assemble metal parts for the A320, A330 and A380
models, Gallois said. Romania will provide 19.4 million euros of
funding by 2013, when the plant reaches full production, Finance
Minister Gheorghe Ialomitianu told reporters at a briefing.  “ Romania  is the country where we have invested the most,
besides our home countries,” Gallois said. EADS may also
consider investment to make helicopter parts, he said.  Premium Aerotec was spun off as a wholly-owned subsidiary
of Paris- and Munich-based EADS in 2009.  To contact the reporters on this story:
