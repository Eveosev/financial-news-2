(Corrects headline to add dropped word.)  Belvedere SA (BVD)  Chief Executive Officer
Jacques Rouvroy was fined 100,000 euros ($140,000) by  France ’s
financial-markets regulator for manipulating the company’s share
price.  Belvedere, its Sobieski and Polmos Lancut units, and
Rouvroy’s Financiere du Vignoble were fined another 75,000 euros
in total. The Autorite des Marches Financiers issued the
 decision  on its website today.  Rouvroy and Belvedere were found to have reported
misleading information to the markets on a share buy-back plan
as well as on how many of the company’s shares they controlled.
Sobieski, a Polish vodka company, Rouvroy and Financiere du
Vignoble were faulted for not declaring purchases of Belvedere
shares. Polmos Lancut didn’t notify the markets that it had
crossed stake thresholds in buying up Belvedere shares.  “These elements come together to show that while using the
companies’ accounts” Rouvroy “ensured that Belvedere shares
were fixed at an abnormal level compared to that which would
have happened naturally in the market,” the AMF said.  Alain Ribeyre, a lawyer for Rouvroy and the companies,
didn’t immediately respond to calls for comment on the decision.
Rouvroy didn’t return a message left on his mobile phone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
