U.S. regulators should require that
high-frequency and algorithmic traders register with authorities
before they enter financial markets, said  Bart Chilton , member
of the U.S.  Commodity Futures Trading Commission .  The traders, which Chilton calls “cheetahs”, should be
“confined” and subject to testing and a pre-trading
accreditation process, Chilton said in a speech prepared for a
 Washington  conference held today by the  American Soybean
Association .  “Without registration of cheetahs, there is no way of
actually regulating these cats and the results could be
horrendous,” Chilton said.  Algorithms that exchanges use to allocate trades “may be
adding to the problem by not necessarily accepting the first or
best bid or offer but weighing the size of the trade, too,” he
said.  The CFTC has sought public comment on whether and how to
regulate potentially disruptive practices including algorithmic
trading and “spoofing,” in which someone enters a bid or offer
with the intent of canceling it before the trade is carried out.  The CFTC and  Securities and Exchange Commission  are leading
U.S. efforts to write new regulations for the  derivatives market 
after largely unregulated trades helped fuel the 2008 credit
crisis. The Dodd-Frank Act aims to reduce risk and boost
transparency in the $601 trillion swaps market.  To contact the reporter on this story:
