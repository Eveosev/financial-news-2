Czech stocks slumped the most in
three months, with banks leading declines, amid concern  Europe ’s
credit crisis will worsen.  The PX gauge of 14 companies fell as much as 1.7 percent,
its biggest drop since April 12, and traded down 1.5 percent by
10:20 a.m. in Prague. The index headed for its worst three-day
sell-off in more than a year.  Equities and commodities dropped worldwide, the euro slid
to its weakest in four months against the yen and bond risks
jumped as concern  Greece ’s debt plight will spread hurt investor
demand for riskier assets worldwide.  Austria’s  Erste Group Bank AG (EBS)  declined 3.8 percent to 784.8
koruna, its lowest since Dec. 1.  Komercni Banka AS (KOMB) , the Czech
unit of Societe Generale SA, lost 1.9 percent to 3,961 koruna.
The two lenders have a combined 40 percent weighting in the PX.  New World Resources Plc, the biggest Czech coking-coal
producer, retreated 1.7 percent to 233 koruna, its fourth day of
declines.  CEZ AS (CEZ) , the country’s biggest power utility, rose 0.5
percent to 865 koruna, making it the index’s best performer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
