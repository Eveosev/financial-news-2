U.K. two-year government note yields
reached the lowest since October as reports showed inflation
unexpectedly slowed and retail sales slid in June, fueling
speculation interest rates will stay at a record low.  The 10-year yield fell to the lowest in more than eight
months as the worsening debt crisis in  Europe  prompted investors
to buy the securities as a haven. Consumer prices rose 4.2
percent from a year earlier, the  Office for National Statistics 
said today in London. Economists had expected the gauge to stay
at 4.5 percent, according to the median of 30 predictions in a
Bloomberg survey.  “Given the weak U.K. economic data and the problems in the
euro area, clearly the Bank of England will stay on hold in the
long term,” said  Matteo Regesta , a senior interest-rate
strategist at BNP Paribas SA in London. ‘The outlook for gilts
is very positive.’’  The yield on the two-year note fell 10 basis points to 0.62
percent, the least since Oct. 25, and was at 0.71 percent as of
5:17 p.m. in  London . The 4.5 percent security maturing in March
2013 rose 0.1, or 1 pound per 1,000-pound ($1,594) face amount,
to 106.22. The 10-year gilt yield was little changed at 3.09
percent, after sliding to 2.93 percent.  British bonds have risen and the pound declined this year
amid speculation that slowing economic growth will limit the
Bank of England’s ability to raise rates, while the  Federal
Reserve  ends its bond-purchase stimulus program and the  European
Central Bank  tightens monetary policy.  Retail Sales  Gilts have returned investors 1.9 percent since the end of
June, compared with a 4.4 percent decline by Italian bonds,
according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. Spanish bonds have
handed investors a 2.8 percent loss, the indexes show.  Sales fell 0.6 percent from a year earlier, following a 2.1
percent decline in May, the  British Retail Consortium  said
today. The median estimate of six economists surveyed by
Bloomberg was for a drop of 1.4 percent.  The pound gained 0.2 percent to $1.5932, after dropping to
$1.5781, the weakest level since Jan. 26. It lost 0.7 percent to
126.76 yen and was 0.3 percent stronger at 87.94 pence per euro.
It earlier gained as much as 0.8 percent to 87.49 pence, the
strongest level since June 16.  Sterling has lost 6.3 percent in the past year, the second-
biggest decline after the dollar, according to Bloomberg
Correlation-Weighted Currency Indexes, which track 10 developed-
market currencies. The Swiss franc has jumped 15 percent.  “The market has accepted that although there is a lot of
inflation, the  Bank of England  is clearly in no rush to raise
rates because it is focused on soft domestic demand,” said Jane Foley, a senior currency strategist at Rabobank International in
London. “The U.K. fundamentals look very poor.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
