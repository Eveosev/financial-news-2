The chief executive officers of
Alcatel-Lucent SA,  Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE)  and  Vivendi SA (VIV)  will say
in a report to be published today that European telecoms
operators should be allowed to develop new business models, with
“no restrictions,” including charging online content providers
for delivering content to customers, the Financial Times
reported, citing the report.  The report is a response to the European Commission’s
concerns that European Union targets on improving broadband
speeds will not be met because of insufficient investment by
telecoms operators, the FT said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
