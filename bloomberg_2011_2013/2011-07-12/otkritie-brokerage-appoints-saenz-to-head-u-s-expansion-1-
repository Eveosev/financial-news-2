Otkritie Financial Corp., the
brokerage partly owned by  Russia ’s VTB Group, named Luis Saenz
chief executive officer of its new U.S. unit, according to an
internal memo seen by Bloomberg News.  Saenz, who formerly held the post of director of
international sales and was based in  London , worked at
 Renaissance Capital  in New York before joining Otkritie.  The brokerage recently obtained regulatory approval to work
in the U.S., Roman Lokhov, Otkritie Financial Corp.’s CEO, was
quoted as saying in the memo. “This milestone will enable
Otkritie to proceed with our expansion plans in the U.S. and in
the rest of the Americas,” Lokhov said.  The Moscow-based company said in March it is hiring 10
bankers for its  New York  operations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
