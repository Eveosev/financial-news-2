(Corrects figure on investor auction bids in last
sentence.)  Treasuries snapped a two-day gain as
the U.S. prepared to sell $66 billion of notes and bonds this
week, starting with a $32 billion three-year auction today.  The government also intends to offer $21 billion of 10-year
debt tomorrow and $13 billion of 30-year bonds on July 14.
Treasury yields may rise after the  Federal Reserve  completed its
$600 billion bond-purchase program in June, Bank of America
Merrill Lynch, one of the 20 primary dealers authorized to trade
directly with the central bank, wrote in a report.  “The auctions this week may support higher yields,” said
Tomohisa Fujiki, an interest-rate strategist at BNP Paribas
Securities Japan Ltd. in  Tokyo . BNP’s U.S. unit is another
primary dealer.  The benchmark 10-year yield climbed one basis point to 2.93
percent as of 9:46 a.m. in Tokyo, according to Bloomberg Bond
Trader prices. The 3.125 percent note maturing in May 2021
traded at 101 21/32.  Japanese bonds advanced for a second day. The yield on the
10-year security dropped 2.5 basis points to 1.105 percent.  Treasuries rallied yesterday, pushing 10-year yields to the
biggest two-day decline in more than a year, as  Europe ’s
sovereign-debt crisis intensified.  Yields fell to the lowest level in two weeks as European
finance chiefs clashed over how to help  Greece  avoid defaulting
on its debt. Italian 10-year rates climbed to the highest level
in a decade.  ‘Scaring People’  “Europe’s scaring people more than anything right now,”
said  Thomas Roth , senior Treasury trader in  New York  at
Mitsubishi UFJ Securities USA Inc. “The longer it goes with the
uncertainty, the more people are just going to throw in the
towel, sell stocks and buy Treasuries.”  The three-year notes scheduled for sale today yielded 0.66
percent in pre-auction trading, compared with 0.765 percent at
the previous sale of the securities on June 7.  Investors bid for 3.28 times the amount of debt offered
last month. The average for the past 10 auctions is 3.14.
Indirect bidders, which include foreign central banks, bought
35.6 percent of the securities, versus the 10-sale average of
34.7 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
