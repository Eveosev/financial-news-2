Cotton slumped for a second day to
its lowest in nine months on speculation of slower demand in
 China , the world’s biggest consumer.  December-delivery cotton fell as much as 4.3 percent to
$1.042 a pound, the lowest price since Oct. 7, on ICE Futures
U.S. in  New York  and traded at $1.0429 at 11:03 a.m. London
time. The contract tumbled by the exchange limit of 5 cents
yesterday. Futures have fallen 28 percent this year.  There’s concern China may further tighten its monetary
policy, slowing demand, said Han Sung Min, a broker at Korea
Exchange Bank Futures Co. in  Seoul .  Cotton for January delivery tumbled as much as 4.7 percent
to 21,155 yuan ($3,268) a metric ton, the lowest since Sept. 30,
in Zhengzhou, before closing at 21,460 yuan.  Data released by the People’s Bank of China on its website
today showed that new loans exceeded estimates in June and
foreign-exchange reserves jumped by $153 billion in the second
quarter, bolstering the case for more tightening.  Editors: Ovais Subhani, James Poole  To contact the reporter on this story:
