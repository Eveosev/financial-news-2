The Hungarian government’s plan to
increase its holdings of “strategic” assets will hamper the
drive to cut debt and to prevent a  credit-rating  downgrade to
junk, according to Bank of America’s Merrill Lynch.  “Evidence is accumulating suggesting that the public debt-
reduction plan will prove much less than forecast, leaving
Hungary more exposed to external vulnerability and failing to
safely anchor the sovereign credit rating in investment-grade
territory,”  Raffaella Tenconi , an economist at the U.S. bank in
London, wrote in a report dated today. “The government’s
rhetoric seemed to suggest that increasing the state’s strategic
assets is not inconsistent with its plan to sharply cut public
debt. Alas, we don’t believe that is feasible.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
