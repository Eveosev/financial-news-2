Canada  ran a fourth straight
merchandise trade deficit in May as higher prices for imports
offset export gains.  The trade deficit narrowed to C$814 million ($835 million)
in May from a revised C$857 million a month earlier,  Statistics
Canada  said today. The figure was in line with the C$800 million
shortfall forecast in a Bloomberg survey of 23 economists.  Growth in exports will be “modest” as the economy
recovers over the next year because of a strong currency and the
need for companies to regain competitiveness, Bank of Canada
Governor  Mark Carney  told lawmakers June 22. The country has
reported average monthly deficits of C$476 million since the
start of 2009, versus surpluses averaging C$4.5 billion in the
previous five years.  “The difficulty in getting back to a surplus is we are
assuming that investment remains strong, and Canadian companies
import a lot of machinery and equipment from the U.S.,” said
 Paul Ferley , assistant chief economist at Royal Bank of Canada
in Toronto.  The Canadian dollar was little changed at 96.85 cents per
 U.S. dollar  at 9:50 a.m. in Toronto, compared with 96.88 cents
yesterday. One Canadian dollar buys $1.03252.  Canadian Dollar  The currency reached 94.46 cents per U.S. dollar on April
29, the strongest level since November 2007. A stronger currency
makes imported goods such as clothing and machinery cheaper.  “The strong Canadian dollar and persistent softness in
U.S. demand continue to be headwinds,” said Benjamin Reitzes,
an economist at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto.  Exports increased 1.2 percent in May to C$36.9 billion, led
by machinery and equipment and industrial goods such as metals.
Imports rose 1.1 percent to C$37.8 billion on gains in every
major group except energy. The Ottawa-based agency today also
lowered the deficits for the previous three months.  Rising prices drove the increase in imports, the report
showed. The volume of imports, which excludes the impact of
price changes, fell by 1 percent. Export volumes rose 1.5
percent.  The  trade surplus  with the U.S., Canada’s largest trading
partner, narrowed to C$3.74 billion in May from C$3.95 billion
in April. Canada sends about 75 percent of its exports to the
U.S.  Other recent reports suggest the economic recovery is
building, including a jobless rate at a 2-1/2 year low last
month and a 21 percent rise in building permits in May.  Bombardier Inc. last month won an order from Korean Air
Lines for as many as 30 CSeries single-aisle jets, the first
customer from  Asia  to select the mid-range airliner.  South
Korea ’s flagship airline signed an agreement to buy 10 CS300
aircraft, with an additional 10 options, and 10 purchase rights
on CS300 aircraft, Montreal-based Bombardier said June 21.  To contact the reporter on this story:
