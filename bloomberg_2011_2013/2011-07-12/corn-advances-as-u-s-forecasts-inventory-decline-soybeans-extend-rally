Corn rose to the highest price this
month after the government said U.S. stockpiles will be smaller
than expected, heightening concern that costs for food and fuel
will climb. Soybean prices also gained.  U.S. corn inventories before next year’s harvest may total
870 million bushels, the lowest since 1996, the Department of
Agriculture said today. Analysts in a Bloomberg News survey
expected 1.029 billion. The USDA boosted its export forecast and
said a record 5.15 billion bushels will be used to make ethanol,
more than estimated last month.  “We’re a lot more inelastic on corn demand than people
think,” said  Jason Britt , the president of brokerage Central
States Commodities Inc. in  Kansas City ,  Missouri . “Sure, the
world economy is going into a horrible funk, but there’s still a
certain amount of animals that have to be fed and a certain
amount of ethanol that’s going to be produced.”  Corn futures for December delivery rose 25.25 cents, or 4
percent, to close at $6.58 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the Chicago
Board of Trade, after touching $6.61, the highest for the most-
active contract since June 29. The price was up 68 percent in
the past year.  Soybean futures for November delivery gained 11.25 cents,
or 0.8 percent, to $13.5825 a bushel on the CBOT, climbing for a
seventh straight session, the longest rally since December. The
most-active futures have gained 43 percent in the past year.  Global food costs climbed to a record in February, a United
Nations index showed. High grocery prices and corruption have
spurred unrest this year in the  Middle East  and northern  Africa ,
where the leaders of Tunisia and  Egypt  were ousted. The U.S. is
the world’s largest exporter of corn, soybeans and wheat.  Consumption Rising  Corn consumption globally will rise 4.1 percent to 877.6
million metric tons in the year that begins Oct. 1, from a
record 842.8 million this year, the USDA said. World inventories
before the 2012 harvest will fall to 115.66 million tons, from
120.88 million. Stockpiles will be equal to about 13 percent of
consumption, the lowest since 1974, USDA data show.  World wheat and soybean inventories will fall for a second
straight year, the USDA said. Wheat supplies before the 2012
harvest will fall to 182.2 million tons from 190 million
estimated on June 1 this year, the agency said. Soybean reserves
on Oct. 1, 2012, will fall 5.9 percent to 61.97 million tons,
down from 65.88 million this year.  “We are not rebuilding inventories in the U.S. or the
world,” said Sal Gilbertie, the president of  Santa Fe , New
Mexico-based Teucrium Trading LLC, which last year started an
exchange-traded product linked to corn futures. “As global
consumption goes up, the competition for acreage will increase
from all crops.”  U.S. Exports Surge  Exports  of agricultural products from the U.S. jumped to
$60.2 billion in the first five months of 2011, up 33 percent
from a year earlier, the government said last month. Shipments
last year climbed 18 percent to a record $115.81 billion. China
became the leading market for U.S. farm goods by boosting
purchases 34 percent.  China, the biggest buyer of soybeans, became a net importer
of corn last year for the first time since 1996. The USDA said
today that  China  will import 2 million tons of corn in the year
that begins Oct. 1, up from an estimated 1.5 million this year.  “China is the most critical factor for prices,” and there
are no signs that demand is slowing, Gilbertie said. “Unless we
have a major economic hiccup,” livestock producers will buy
“more corn to produce more meat,” he said.  Prices accelerated to session highs after midday forecasts
for hot, dry weather in the U.S. Midwest, threatening yield
potential as corn and soybeans begin to reproduce, said  Mark Schultz , the chief analyst for Northstar Commodity Investment
Co. in  Minneapolis .  Temperatures will average 7 degrees to 12 degrees
Fahrenheit warmer than usual from July 14 to July 20 with above-
normal temperatures and drier weather continuing to July 25,  T-
