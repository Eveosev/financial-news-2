OPEC crude oil production jumped
last month as  Saudi Arabia , the group’s biggest exporter, pumped
the most since 2008.  The 11 members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries bound by quotas produced 26.9 million barrels a day in
June, the group’s Vienna-based secretariat said today in its
monthly oil market report. That’s up from 26.4 million in May.  “Saudi Arabia led the crude oil output increase, followed
by the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Venezuela and Iraq,” the
group said “Output from Angola, Nigeria and  Libya  experienced
the largest declines.”  Supplies from Saudi Arabia rose 5.1 percent to 9.4 million
barrels a day last month, from 9 million in May, OPEC said.  The group’s compliance with record production cuts dropped
to 51 percent in June compared with 63 percent the previous
month, according to Bloomberg calculations. Compliance
percentages are based on combined output from the 11 members
that committed to reduce from a  base rate  in September 2008 of
29.045 million barrels.  OPEC’s production including Iraq, which is exempt from the
quota system, was 29.6 million barrels a day in June, compared
with 29.1 million in May.  Libyan production was at 111,000 barrels a day last month
as violence between anti-government rebels and forces loyal to
 Muammar Qaddafi  curtailed output. The country produced an
average 1.56 million last year, according to the report.  OPEC, provider of about 40 percent of the world’s crude,
announced its biggest-ever supply cuts in late 2008 amid a
collapse in global demand. The decision capped production at
24.845 million barrels a day for all members except Iraq, which
is exempt from the quota system.  OPEC’s members are Algeria,  Angola , Ecuador,  Iran , Iraq,
Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab
Emirates and Venezuela.  To contact the reporter on this story:
