Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) ,  Japan ’s biggest
automaker, said it received 23 percent more orders for its Etios
sedan in India than it had targeted.  The carmaker got 37,000 orders from Dec. 1 to June 30,
compared with an estimate for 30,000, Toshihiro Takeda, group
leader for Southeast Asia sales, told reporters today at a test-
drive event for the Etios at the Fuji Speedway racetrack in
Japan’s Shizuoka prefecture. Toyota began selling the Etios
sedan in India in December and a hatchback version in late June.  The Etios line, also to be sold in  China ,  Brazil  and
Thailand, is part of the carmaker’s plan to get half of its
global auto sales from emerging markets by 2015. Toyota is
studying whether to introduce a sport-utility or multipurpose-
vehicle Etios in  India , and may need a larger version for the
Chinese market, Yoshinori Noritake, chief engineer for the
models, said in an interview in Shizuoka today.  “In India, where many people ride at the same time, an SUV
or MPV may be necessary,” Noritake said. “In China, exterior
appearance of size is more important than price.”  The automaker aims to sell more than 100,000 Etios cars in
2012, up from at least 60,000 this year, Sandeep Singh, deputy
managing director for Toyota’s Indian unit, said June 27.  Toyota plans to invest 4.9 billion yen ($61 million) to
expand production capacity at two plants in India. The Indian
unit will raise annual output to 210,000 vehicles from the
current 150,000 in the first half of next year, the automaker
also said in June.  The company received 1,400 orders for the Etios hatchback
in India from June 27 to 30, more than its target of 1,000, it
said today.  Toyota fell 1.9 percent to 3,355 yen as of the 3 p.m. close
of trading in  Tokyo . The shares have gained 4.2 percent this
year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
