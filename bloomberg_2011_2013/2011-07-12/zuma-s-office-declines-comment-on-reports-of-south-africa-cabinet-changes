South African President  Jacob Zuma ’s
office declined to comment on speculation that he plans to
reshuffle his Cabinet, which Business Day said might see Mineral
Resources Minister Susan Shabangu lose her post.  “There are no facts on the table about a reshuffle,” Mac
Maharaj, Zuma’s spokesman, said in a phone interview today.
“There is no such a discussion at the moment. All the reports
are pure speculation.” Maharaj didn’t rule out the possibility
of changes to government ministers.  Shabangu may be replaced by her deputy, Godfrey Oliphant,
while Police Minister Nathi Mthethwa may replace Cooperative
Governance and Traditional Affairs Minister Sicelo Shiceka,
Johannesburg-based  Business Day  newspaper said, without citing
anyone for the information. Zuma may announce the changes after
a four-day national executive committee meeting of the ruling
 African National Congress  that begins in two days, it said.  “The minister continues to do her job as per her
performance agreement with the President,” Musa Zondi,
Shabangu’s spokesman, said in an e-mailed response to a query
today. “Until advised otherwise, she continues with her
engagements.”  Sports Minister Fikile Mbalula may replace Mthethwa,
Business Day said.  Johannesburg-based The New Age newspaper yesterday said
Zuma may make changes to his Cabinet, without citing where it
got the information.  To contact the reporter on this story:
