German Foreign Minister  Guido Westerwelle , whose country leads the United Nations Security
Council this month, called violence in Syria “unacceptable”
and said he’ll intensify pressure on the country’s leadership.  Westerwelle, in  New York  at the UN today, also condemned
yesterday’s mob attacks on the U.S. and French embassies in the
Syrian capital Damascus, saying that the government of President
Bashar al-Assad had an obligation to protect diplomats.  “The attacks on foreign missions in Damascus must be
stopped immediately,” Westerwelle said in a statement issued by
the Foreign Ministry in Berlin today. “The Syrian government
has an obligation to protect under international law that it
must fulfill without any ifs, ands or buts.”  Germany  summoned the Syrian ambassador in Berlin again to
criticize the treatment of demonstrators by Syrian security
forces. Westerwelle repeated that Assad must meet the demands of
his opponents and arrive at a “credible national dialog that
will lead to democracy and real political participation.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
