What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets.  -- Corn futures are called to open 5 cents to 8 cents a bushel
higher on the  Chicago  Board of Trade, erasing earlier declines,
after the government said U.S. reserve inventories will rise
less than analysts expected and as adverse weather threatens to
trim U.S. yields, said Mike Zuzolo, the president of Global
Commodity Analytics & Consulting in Lafayette, Indiana.  -- Wheat futures may open 2 cents to 3 cents a bushel higher on
the CBOT, the Kansas City Board of Trade and the  Minneapolis
Grain Exchange  after the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  forecast
declining domestic inventories for 2012, Zuzolo said.  -- Soybean futures may open steady to 3 cents a bushel higher in
Chicago as hot, dry weather the next two weeks may damage U.S.
crops after the government said U.S. inventories before the 2012
harvest will be smaller than this year, Zuzolo said. Soybean-
meal futures may open $1 to $2 lower per 2,000 pounds, and
 soybean oil  is expected to open 0.2 cent to 0.4 cent a pound
lower.  To contact the reporter on this story:
