Ivory Coast  released about 12
billion CFA-francs ($25.7 million) to compensate French and
Ivorian businesses that were looted or destroyed during violence
over the past ten years, the finance minister said.  A fund of 6 billion CFA-francs was made available for
private enterprises that were looted in fighting that preceded
the arrest of former President  Laurent Gbagbo  in April, Charles Koffi Diby told reporters yesterday.  A separate fund of 6 billion CFA-francs was established to
compensate 44 French entrepreneurs whose businesses were
severely damaged or destroyed by mobs during anti-French riots
in 2004, he said.  The government also plans to provide tax relief to private
industry this year, Diby said, without giving further details.  Ivory Coast, the worldâ€™s biggest cocoa producer, is
emerging from a 4 1/2-month political crisis that followed a
disputed November presidential election. Gbagbo, who lost the
vote to  Alassane Ouattara , clung to power until he was captured
in Abidjan. Ouattara was sworn into office on May 21.  To contact the reporter on this story:
