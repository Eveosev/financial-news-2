The Treasury Department’s $32
billion sale of three-year notes may draw a yield of 0.680
percent, according to the average forecast in a Bloomberg News
survey of 10 of the  Federal Reserve ’s 20 primary dealers.  The amount was unchanged from the previous nine sales of
the security. The notes, which mature in July 2014, yielded
0.680 percent in pre-auction trading. Bids are due by 1 p.m. New
York time.  Last month’s auction of three-year notes drew a yield of
0.765 percent, the lowest level since November.  The June 7 offering’s bid-to-cover ratio, which gauges
demand by comparing the amount bid with the amount offered, was
3.28, versus an average of 3.14 for the past 10 sales.  Indirect bidders, a class of investors that includes
foreign central banks, bought 35.6 percent of the notes at the
June sale, compared with 32.7 percent at the May auction. The
average for the past 10 offerings is 34.7 percent.  Direct bidders, non-primary-dealer investors that place
their bids directly with the Treasury, purchased 9.2 percent of
the notes at the last sale, compared with an average of 12.8
percent for the past 10 auctions.  Three-year notes have returned 2.2 percent this year,
compared with a gain of 3.5 percent for Treasuries overall,
according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes.  The Fed’s primary dealers trade  government securities  with
the central bank and are obligated to participate in Treasury
auctions.  The Treasury is selling $66 billion in notes and bonds this
week. It’s due to auction $21 billion of 10-year securities
tomorrow and $13 billion of 30-year debt on July 14.  To contact the reporter on this story:
