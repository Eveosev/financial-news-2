The Venezuelan government may
present conditions for a bond auction before the National
Assembly today even as Finance Minister  Jorge Giordani  said the
 interest rates  investors demand for Venezuelan securities are
too high.  Once the conditions have been approved the government could
begin to sell bonds at any moment, Giordani said without
specifying whether the currency would be in bolivars or dollars.  Venezuela is increasingly looking to  China  as a creditor as
investors demand higher interest rates to guarantee the debt
issued by South America’s biggest oil producer, Giordani said.  “This will give additional impulse to the economic growth
we’ve already experienced this year -- if you take your foot off
the pedal the car stalls,” Giordani said in comments carried on
state television yesterday. “We’re not going to pay those rates
they make us pay.”  Venezuelan President  Hugo Chavez  signed a bill to expand
the debt ceiling by 45 billion bolivars ($10.5 billion) this
year. The government sold $3 billion of bonds due in 2022 with a
coupon of 12.75 percent last August.  China and Venezuela set up a joint development fund which
has received $32 billion since it was established in 2008. Under
the terms of the fund China must double any payment made by
Venezuela.  To contact the reporter on this story:
