Corinthians denied a newspaper
report that it offered Manchester City 37 million pounds ($59
million) for  Carlos Tevez , Folha de S.Paulo reported, citing
Roberto Andrade, the Brazilian club’s director of football.  The U.K.’s Daily Mail reported today that Corinthians are
funding the bid with sponsorship and television rights money.
Andrade said his club had only begun talks with Tevez’s lawyer,
Adrian Rocco, to try to take the Argentine striker back to his
former club, the newspaper said.  Corinthians “only formalized its interest, we do not know
of values and nor if it would be for a loan or permanent
signing,” Folha cited Andrade as saying.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
