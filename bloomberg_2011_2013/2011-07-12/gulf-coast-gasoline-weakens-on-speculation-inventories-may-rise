Gasoline in the  Gulf Coast  declined
as analysts forecast that inventories of the fuel will rise for
the first time in four weeks.  Gasoline stockpiles probably increased by 500,000 barrels,
or 0.2 percent, to 213 million in the week ended July 8,
according to the median estimate of 15 analysts in a survey by
Bloomberg News. The Gulf Coast contains over 40 percent of U.S.
crude processing capacity.  The differential for reformulated, 87-octane gasoline in
the Gulf Coast widened 2.88 cents to a discount of 0.38 cent
versus futures traded on the  New York  Mercantile Exchange at
4:07 p.m., according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Prompt
delivery slipped 0.1 cent to $3.0945 a gallon.  Supplies of industrial, trucking and home-heating fuels
also probably rose 500,000 barrels, or 0.4 percent, to 142.6
million barrels, according to the survey. The Energy Department
is scheduled to report last weekâ€™s inventories at 10:30 a.m.
tomorrow in  Washington .  The premium for ultra-low-sulfur diesel in the Gulf versus
Nymex heating oil futures dropped 0.35 cent to 4.15 cents a
gallon.  Colonial Pipeline Co., which operates the largest line
linking U.S. Gulf Coast refiners and East Coast markets,
allocated fuel shipments on Line 2 for Cycle 41, according to a
notice to shippers. Line 2 carries distillates north of Collins,
 Mississippi .  The premium for reformulated, 87-octane gasoline in New
York slipped 0.38 cent to 5.75 cents a gallon.  To contact the reporter on this story:
