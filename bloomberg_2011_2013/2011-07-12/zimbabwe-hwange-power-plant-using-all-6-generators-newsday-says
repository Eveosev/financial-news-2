Zimbabwe ’s Hwange thermal power
plant is using all six of its generators for the first time in
more than a decade, Harare-based  Newsday  reported, citing
Ndabezinhle Mpokho, the facility’s general manager.  Hwange produced 727 megawatts in June, the newspaper said.
Improved generating capacity won’t prevent electricity rationing
in the southern African nation, Newsday reported.  Zimbabwe Power Co., a unit of the government-owned Zimbabwe
Electricity Supply Authority, is generating 1,400 megawatts with
Hwange and the Kariba Hydro-Power plant on the Zambezi River,
the newspaper said. Demand, suppressed by a decade of economic
recession, is 1,800 megawatts to 2,000 megawatts, Newsday said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
