Japan ’s bonds rose for a second day
as concerns  Europe ’s debt crisis is spreading to  Italy  and the
U.S. economic recovery is losing momentum boosted demand for the
relative safety of the Asian nation’s debt.  Benchmark yields fell to a two-week low after rates on 10-
year Italian government debt soared to the highest level in more
than a decade. A report today is forecast to show the  U.S. trade
deficit  widened. Bonds also advanced as stocks slid and the yen
rose to a one-month high against the dollar.  “The market is concerned the debt issue may spread from
Greece to Portugal and Spain, and things will get really bad if
it reaches Italy,” said  Satoshi Yamada , who helps oversee $12.7
billion as manager of debt trading at Okasan Asset Management
Co. in  Tokyo . “Bonds are rebounding after expectations for the
U.S. economic recovery proved to be short-lived.”  The yield on the 1.2 percent bond due June 2021 fell 2.5
basis points to 1.105 percent at 3:21 p.m. in Tokyo at Japan
Bond Trading Co., the nation’s largest interdealer debt broker.
The price rose 0.225 yen to 100.85 yen. The yield earlier
touched 1.095 percent, the lowest since June 28. A basis point
is 0.01 percentage point.  Ten-year bond futures for September delivery gained 0.46 to
141.45 as of the afternoon close at the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
The contracts earlier reached 141.54, the highest since June 28.  Ten-year yields on Italian debt climbed to as high as 5.71
percent yesterday, the most since September 2000.  The U.S. trade deficit widened to $44.1 billion in May from
$43.7 billion in April, according to the median estimate of
economists in a Bloomberg News survey before today’s data.  The  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average fell 1.4 percent. The yen
touched 79.84 per dollar, the highest since June 9. A stronger
yen lowers the value of overseas income at Japanese companies
when repatriated.  Bank of Japan  Governor Masaaki Shirakawa and his policy
board left the benchmark lending rate between zero and 0.1
percent at a meeting in Tokyo today. They also kept unchanged a
10 trillion yen ($125 billion) fund to buy assets such as
corporate bonds and exchange-traded funds, while raising the
