U.S. stocks gained, rebounding from
the worst two-day drop for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index since
March, as minutes from the  Federal Reserve ’s last meeting showed
policy makers had not ruled out further stimulus efforts.  The S&P 500 climbed 0.3 percent to 1,323.82 at 2:12 p.m. in
New York after slumping 2.4 percent over the previous two
sessions. The  Dow Jones Industrial Average  climbed 44.73 points,
or 0.4 percent, to 12,550.49.  Benchmark indexes swung between gains and losses before the
release of the Fed report. Equities rallied after the minutes
showed policy makers have not completely ruled out additional
monetary stimulus.  “A few members noted that, depending on how economic
conditions evolve, the committee might have to consider
providing additional monetary stimulus, especially if economic
growth remained too slow to meaningfully reduce the  unemployment
rate  in the medium run,” the Federal Open Market Committee said
in the minutes of its June 21-22 meeting, released today in
Washington.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
