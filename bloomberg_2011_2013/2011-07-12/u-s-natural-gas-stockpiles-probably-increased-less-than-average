U.S. natural-gas inventories
probably rose less than average last week as hotter-than-normal
weather raised demand for the power-plant fuel, according to
analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Stockpiles gained 79 billion cubic feet, or 3.1 percent, to
2.606 trillion in the week ended July 8, based on the median of
21 estimates. The five-year average change for the week is an
increase of 88 billion, according to Energy Department data.
Supplies climbed 78 billion cubic feet a year earlier.  Temperatures in  New York  last week were above normal,
according to AccuWeather Inc. in  State College ,  Pennsylvania .
The high was 92 degrees Fahrenheit (33 Celsius) on July 7, 9
degrees more than average.  “Even in consideration of the Fourth of July holiday, the
weather was so hot that the forecast this week is below
average,” said Jason Schenker, president of Prestige Economics
LLC, an Austin, Texas-based energy consultant, who estimated a
storage increase of 72 billion cubic feet. “It’s all a weather
story and that could be price bullish.”  The stockpile estimates ranged from increases of 65 billion
to 89 billion cubic feet. The Energy Department’s weekly supply
report is scheduled for release at 10:30 a.m. tomorrow in
 Washington .  Power plants  use about 30 percent of the nation’s gas
supplies, according to department data.  Gas storage increased 95 billion cubic feet to 2.527
trillion in the week ended July 1, the Energy Department
reported last week. Stockpiles were 1.9 percent below the five-
year average and 8.1 percent below year-earlier levels.  Gas Production  The Energy Department yesterday raised its forecast for
2011 U.S. marketed gas production to 65.39 billion cubic feet a
day from 64.61 billion, according to the monthly  Short-Term
Energy Outlook .  Consumption for electricity generation will be 20.63
billion cubic feet a day, up from the previous estimate of 20.3
billion, the report showed.  Natural gas for August delivery declined 2.5 percent to
$4.205 per million British thermal units last week on the  New
York Mercantile Exchange , the biggest weekly loss in four weeks.
Prices gained 7 cents, or 1.6 percent, to $4.403 today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
