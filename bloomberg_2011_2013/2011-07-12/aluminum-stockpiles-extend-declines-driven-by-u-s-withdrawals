Aluminum inventories monitored by
the London Metal Exchange fell to a six-month low, driven by
declines in the U.S.  Inventories of the lightweight metal fell for a 34th
session, dropping 6,500 metric tons to 4.42 million tons,
exchange data showed today. They are at the lowest level since
Jan. 12. Stockpiles have dropped 6 percent since May 24. Most
declines were registered in the U.S. Total orders to draw
aluminum from LME warehouses, known as canceled warrants, fell
6,525 tons to 389,250 tons.  The decline in aluminum inventories on the LME is the
result of a shift into “invisible” stockpiles, which are those
not tracked by the LME, rather than to consumers, said  Alcoa
Inc. (AA) , the top U.S. producer of the metal used in cans and cars.  “We do see shifts between visible and invisible
inventories,” said Chief Executive Officer  Klaus Kleinfeld  in a
conference call with analysts. “It’s moved into invisible
inventory whereas before we’d seen it moving into visible.”  Lead inventories rose for the first time in 10 days,
gaining 1,925 tons to 308,650 tons on gains in Malaysia and
Rotterdam. Stockpiles in the Dutch port city rose 1,150 tons in
the past two days after declining 1,150 tons on July 7. Total
canceled warrants fell 1,625 tons to 20,500 tons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
