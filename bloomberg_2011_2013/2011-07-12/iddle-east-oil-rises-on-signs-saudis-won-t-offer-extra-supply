Middle East crude grades for sale to
 Asia  climbed against their benchmarks on signs that  Saudi Arabia 
may not offer extra supplies to refiners in the region.  Murban for September loading climbed 6 cents to a discount
of 2 cents a barrel to its official selling price, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Qatar Marine climbed 2 cents to a
discount of 15 cents a barrel, Bloomberg data showed.  Refiners haven’t sought extra supplies for August from
Saudi Arabian Oil Co. after the company sold additional amounts
for July, said two refiners who participate in the market. That
should support prices for grades such as Murban and Qatar Marine
that are sold on the  spot market . Aramco told processors
yesterday it would provide full long-term volumes for August.  Oman crude for immediate loading dropped $1.55, or 1.4
percent, to $109.36 a barrel, Bloomberg data showed. Dubai oil
for delivery in September fell 1.4 percent to $108.90. Murban
declined 1.3 percent to $113.26.  Oman futures for September delivery declined $1.01 to
$110.35 a barrel on the  Dubai Mercantile Exchange  at 5:31 p.m.
Singapore time, with 1,322 contracts traded. The settlement
price was $109.68 at 12:30 p.m. in Dubai.  The August Brent-Dubai exchange for swaps, which measures
the European marker against the Persian Gulf grade, narrowed 24
cents to $6.18 a barrel, according to data from PVM Oil
Associates Ltd., a crude and refined-products broker in  London .
The exchange for swaps for September fell 29 cents to $5.13.  To contact the reporter on this story:
