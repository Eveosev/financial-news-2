     July 12 (Bloomberg) --  UDR Inc. (UDR) , the third-largest publicly
traded U.S. apartment owner, agreed to pay about $581 million
for two Manhattan rental communities as it seeks to expand its
foothold in the  New York  market.  The company will purchase the 706-unit Rivergate complex in
Murray Hill for $443 million, and a 210-unit community called 21
Chelsea for $138 million, the Highlands Ranch, Colorado-based
real estate investment trust said today in a statement. UDR also
said it bought a property in  Washington , D.C., on June 28,
paying $106 million for a 185-home community called View 14.  “The acquisition of these three communities continues our
portfolio transformation and strategy of owning apartment homes
in markets characterized by above-average job growth, low home
affordability and limited new supply -- three of the key drivers
to strong rental growth,” Tom Toomey, president and chief
executive officer, said in the statement.  UDR is expanding in  Manhattan  after making its first
purchase in the borough earlier this year, when it paid $260.8
million for 10 Hanover Square in the Financial District. Chief
Financial Officer David Messenger said in March that the company
was “walking up and down the streets” looking at New York
properties as it sought more acquisitions in the city.  “One asset isn’t going to be enough for us,” he said in
an interview at the time.  The acquisitions announced today will be financed with cash
and UDR’s credit line, as well as the assumption of a $31
million first mortgage on 21 Chelsea, the company said. The
mortgage has an interest rate of 6.76 percent and matures in
June 2012. It can be pre-paid at par in December.  UDR also increased its forecast for funds from operations,
a measure of  cash flow  used by REITs. The company expects full-
year FFO of $1.25 to $1.30 a share, compared with a February
forecast of $1.20 to $1.25.  To contact the reporter on this story:
