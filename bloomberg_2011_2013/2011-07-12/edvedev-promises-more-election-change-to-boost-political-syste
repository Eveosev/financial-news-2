President  Dmitry Medvedev  said he
will continue changing electoral law to ensure more parties join
parliament, part of efforts to decentralize the power structure
created by his predecessor  Vladimir Putin .  ”Our political system requires further improvement,”
Medvedev said outside Moscow today. Proposals probably ”won’t
be limited” to a bill to cut the threshold for parties to win
seats in the State Duma to 5 percent, he told the leaders of
parties represented in parliament, without providing details of
additional initiatives.  Putin, now prime minister, centralized power and sidelined
opposition in his eight years as president and remains at the
center of decision-making after making way for Medvedev in 2008.
Medvedev has vowed to loosen federal control and grant more
economic freedom to regions and municipalities.  Pro-government parties control 87 percent of seats in the
lower house of parliament, or State Duma. The bill to reduce the
existing 7 percent parliamentary barrier, imposed during Putin’s
presidency, would come into force after elections in December.  The ruling  United Russia  party, led by Putin, plans to
”maintain its position” in parliament, Duma speaker  Boris Gryzlov  said. United Russia holds 315 of the Duma’s 450 seats.  Medvedev said he hopes the parliamentary campaign will be
“open and honest’’ and that voting will be “absolutely fair.’’  To contact the reporter on this story:
