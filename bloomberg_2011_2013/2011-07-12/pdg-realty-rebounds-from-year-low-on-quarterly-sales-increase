PDG Realty SA Empreendimentos &
Participacoes,  Brazil ’s biggest homebuilder by revenue, advanced
from a one-year low in Sao Paulo trading after reporting an
increase in second-quarter sales.  Shares gained 0.1 percent to 8.11 reais at the close of Sao
Paulo trading at 4:15 p.m. New York time after earlier rising as
much as 2.2 percent. The Bovespa index fell 0.9 percent to
59,704.75.  PDG Realty said second-quarter net sales rose 17 percent
from a year earlier to 1.8 billion reais ($1.1 billion),
according to a regulatory filing. New building projects
announced by the company in the quarter are valued at 2.1
billion reais, a 14 percent increase from a year before.  “Demand remains resilient, despite the home price
increases over the past few quarters,” Paulo Renelli Neto, an
analyst at Banco J. Safra SA, said in a note to clients today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
