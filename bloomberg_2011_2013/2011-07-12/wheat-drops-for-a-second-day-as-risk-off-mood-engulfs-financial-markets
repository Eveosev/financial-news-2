Corn fell for a second day in
 Chicago  on speculation the U.S. will boost its forecast for
global inventories of the grain.  Corn stockpiles on Oct. 1 may be pegged at 121.77 million
metric tons in a Department of Agriculture report today, a
Bloomberg News survey of 12 analysts shows. That’s up 3.7
percent from a month-ago USDA estimate. USDA figures released
June 30 showed domestic corn inventories were higher than
estimated and sowing exceeded expectations, sending prices down
by the exchange limit in Chicago.  “After the end-of-June surprise, nobody seems to fancy
going into this report too long, or with any huge degree of
confidence,” Dave Norris, an independent feed broker in the
U.S. who has traded grain since 1979, said by e-mail. “The
smart money is continuing to exit.”  Corn for December delivery declined 14 cents, or 2.2
percent, to $6.1875 a bushel by 12:26 p.m.  London  time on the
Chicago Board of Trade. The grain has plunged 17 percent since
the end of May.  Inventories may total 118.5 million tons on Oct. 1, 2012,
according to the survey. That’s up 5.9 percent from the USDA’s
month-ago estimate. The U.S. is the world’s biggest corn
producer and exporter.  Wheat for September delivery fell 19.5 cents, or 3.1
percent, to $6.1975 a bushel. The grain has tumbled 21 percent
since the end of May on speculation that farmers in the U.S.
planted more than originally expected.  Wheat stockpiles on June 1 may have totaled 187.7 million
tons, unchanged from last month’s estimate, according to the
survey. The USDA last month pegged world inventories at 187.1
million tons.  Milling wheat for November delivery traded on NYSE Liffe in
Paris dropped 5 euros, or 2.6 percent, to 185.75 euros ($258.54)
a ton.  November-delivery soybeans fell for the first time in seven
sessions in Chicago, sliding 8.25 cents, or 0.6 percent, to
$13.3875 a bushel. The oilseed has retreated 5.1 percent since
the end of March.  To contact the reporters on this story：
