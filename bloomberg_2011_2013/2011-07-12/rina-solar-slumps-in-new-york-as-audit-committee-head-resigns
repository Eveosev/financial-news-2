Trina Solar Ltd. (TSL) , a China-based
solar power manufacturer, dropped the most in 14 months in  New
York  trading after the chairman of its audit committee resigned.  Trinaâ€™s American depositary receipts fell as much as 16
percent to $16.60, the biggest intraday decline since May 6,
2010, and traded at $17.44 as of 11:35 a.m. local time.  Peter Mak left the board on July 10, Changzhou-based Trina
said today in a statement. Jerome Corcoran will replace him as
head of the audit committee.  To contact the reporter on this story:
