A late-day rally in U.S. stocks
faded after Ireland’s debt rating was cut to junk at Moody’s
Investors Service, overshadowing signs the  Federal Reserve  had
not ruled out further stimulus efforts.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index lost 0.1 percent to
1,318.06 at 3:33 p.m. in New York after climbing as much as 0.6
percent. The benchmark gauge tumbled 2.5 percent in the previous
two days, its worst back-to-back slump since March.
Moody’s cut Ireland’s government bond rating one notch to Ba1
from Baa3, spurring concern Europe’s debt crisis is worsening.  Stocks drifted between gains and losses for most of the day
before turning higher as the 2 p.m. release of minutes from the
Fed’s last meeting showed policy makers had not ruled out
further stimulus efforts.  “A few members noted that, depending on how economic
conditions evolve, the committee might have to consider
providing additional monetary stimulus, especially if economic
growth remained too slow to meaningfully reduce the  unemployment
rate  in the medium run,” the  Federal Open Market Committee  said
in the minutes of its June 21-22 meeting, released today in
Washington.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
