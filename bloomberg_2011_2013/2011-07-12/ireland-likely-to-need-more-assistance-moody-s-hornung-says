Dietmar Hornung, a senior credit
officer at Moody’s Investors Service in  Frankfurt , comments on
the agency’s decision to downgrade Ireland’s sovereign debt to
Ba1, below investment grade, from Baa3 with a negative outlook.
He spoke in a telephone interview.  On the rating:  “We see a growing possibility the country is likely to
need a further round of official financing, and at the same time
we see that there’s an increasing possibility that private-
sector creditor participation will be required as a precondition
for such additional support. These factors weigh on the credit
and led to the decision to go for a one-notch downgrade in the
case of Ireland to a Ba1 rating.”  On the outlook:  “We also decided to keep the negative outlook just to
reflect the implementation risk, but also to reflect the
shifting tone among European Union governments toward the
conditions under which support to a distressed euro-area
sovereign will be made.”  “We are monitoring the evolving approach here, and part of
the evolving approach is the increasingly clear preference of EU
policy makers for private-sector participation, particularly in
countries in which private sectors continue to hold a majority
of outstanding debt.”  “In the end, these kind of discussions and the evolving
approach just reflect uncertainties that weigh on the
creditworthiness of countries that are dependent currently on
support.”  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
