fourth-quarter earnings and bookings are at the “upper end” of
its forecast.  Chief Executive Officer Rick Wallace gave the update today

predicted on April 28 that earnings per share, minus certain
items, would be $1.28 to $1.44 on sales of $840 million to $900
million.  Shares of the Milpitas, California-based company pared
losses after today’s announcement. The stock fell 98 cents to
$41.31 at 4 p.m. New York time on the Nasdaq Stock Market after
