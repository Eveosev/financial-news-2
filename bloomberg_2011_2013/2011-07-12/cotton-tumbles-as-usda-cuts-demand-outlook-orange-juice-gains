Cotton dropped to a nine-month low
on signs of slowing demand for supplies from the U.S., the
world’s biggest exporter.  Orange juice  advanced.  The Department of Agriculture lowered its outlook for U.S.
cotton shipments to 12 million bales for the year that begins
Aug. 1, down from last month’s projection of 13 million.
Exporters have had more canceled orders than sales in 14 of the
past 15 weeks, government data show. Prices have tumbled 28
percent this year, the most among the 19 commodities tracked by
the Thomson/Reuters Jefferies CRB Index.  “It seems like the market is focused on the demand aspect
of things,” said Louis Barbera, a broker with VIP Commodities
in New York. Government data points to “the continued export
cancellations and the slow pace of shipments. All this stuff
rings bearish.”  Cotton for December delivery dropped 4.49 cents, or 4.1
percent, to settle at $1.0439 a pound at 2:47 p.m. on ICE
Futures U.S. in  New York . Earlier, the fiber dropped by the 5-
cent exchange limit to $1.0388, the lowest since Oct. 7.  The fiber has plunged 52 percent since touching a record
$2.197 in March as demand slumped in  China , the world’s biggest
consumer. The USDA cut its outlook for the country’s imports in
the 2011-2012 season by 4.7 percent today. Consumption has
slowed as the nation’s central bank increased borrowing costs
three times this year in a bid to cool growth and curb
inflation.  Orange-juice futures for September delivery gained 2.35
cents, or 1.3 percent, to settle at $1.893 a pound on ICE.
That’s the biggest advance since June 24.  To contact the reporter on this story:
