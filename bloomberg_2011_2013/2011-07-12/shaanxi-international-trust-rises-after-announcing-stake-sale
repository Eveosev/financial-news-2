     July 12 (Bloomberg) - Shaanxi International Trust Co., a
financial services company in central  China , rose the most in
more than a year after agreeing to sell stakes to Shaanxi Coal
and Chemical Industry Group Co. and Xi’an Investment Holding Co.  The company’s shares gained by the 10 percent daily limit
in Shenzhen to 12.21 yuan after trading resumed following a
suspension that started June 28. It was the stock’s biggest one-
day gain since January 2010. China’s benchmark Shanghai
Composite Index fell 1.7 percent.  The financial services provider, based in the city of Xi’an,
signed an agreement yesterday to sell 220 million new shares to
Shaanxi Coal and Chemical and Xi’an Investment Holding for 2.12
billion yuan ($327 billion). Shaanxi Coal and Chemical will
become the Shaanxi International Trust’s biggest shareholder
with 34.58 percent stake, according to a statement filed
yesterday to Shenzhen’s stock exchange.  --Charles Li. Editor:  John Liu   To contact Bloomberg News staff on this story:
