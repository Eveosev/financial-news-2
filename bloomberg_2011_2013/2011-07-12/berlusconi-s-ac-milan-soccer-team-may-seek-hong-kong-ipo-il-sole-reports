Italian Prime Minister  Silvio
Berlusconi ’s AC Milan soccer club may consider selling shares in
a Hong Kong initial public offering, daily Il Sole 24 Ore
reported, without saying where it got the information.  Berlusconi holding company Fininvest may alternatively sell
a minority stake in AC Milan through a capital increase, the
Italian newspaper said.  Fininvest on July 9 was ordered to pay a 540 million-euro
fine to Compagnie Industriali Riunite SpA.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
