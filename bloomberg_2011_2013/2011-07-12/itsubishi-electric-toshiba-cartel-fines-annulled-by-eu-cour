Mitsubishi Electric Corp. (6503)  and
 Toshiba Corp. (6502)  won a European Union court challenge to overturn
fines of 118.6 million euros ($164.8 million) and 90.9 million
euros, respectively, that were levied in a case over electrical
equipment pricing.  The  EU General Court  in Luxembourg today said the European
Commission, the 27-nation EU’s antitrust regulator, fined Asian
companies more harshly than European competitors in the cartel
case. The court also reduced a 2.4 million-euro fine for Fuji
Electric Co. to 2.2 million euros and upheld a 50.4 million-euro
penalty on  Hitachi Ltd. (6501)   “The commission infringed the principle of equal
treatment,” the court said in a statement, deciding that the EU
regulator had treated the European and the Japanese members in
the cartel unequally.  The commission fined 10 companies including  Areva SA (CEI)  and
 Alstom SA (ALO) , a total of 750.7 million euros in January 2007 for
fixing prices and carving up the market for gas-insulated
switchgear, used to control electrical flow.  Siemens AG (SIE) ,
Europe’s largest engineering company, lost a court appeal in
March against its 396.6 million-euro fine, the highest in the
cartel.  The court in March also cut to 48.2 million euros from 53.5
million euros a joint penalty against Areva SA and Alstom SA. A
separate fine for Alstom was cut from 11.5 million euros to 10.3
million euros.  ‘Essential Information’  For Fuji Electric the court said the commission failed to
consider “essential information” that had been submitted by
the company when calculating the fine.  Mitsubishi Electric said in a statement that the company
will consider the ruling carefully. Toshiba spokesman Keisuke Omori also said the company would review the ruling.  The commission in 2007 said 11 companies began in 1988 to
collude on prices and projects for electrical-network equipment,
continuing to do so until 2004.  ABB Ltd. (ABBN) , the world’s largest
maker of power-transmission gear, tipped off the EU and
therefore escaped a 215.2 million-euro fine.  ABB earlier this month was among at least 10 power-cable
manufacturers to receive an EU antitrust complaint over
allegations of price-fixing for undersea and underground high-
voltage power cables.  The cases are: T-112/07, Hitachi and Others v. European
Commission; T-113/07, Toshiba v. European Commission; T-132/07,
Fuji Electric v. European Commission; T-133/07, Mitsubishi
Electric v. European Commission.  To contact the reporter on this story:
