The U.S. Federal Communications
Commission is proposing new rules to protect landline telephone
users from surprise charges on their monthly bills.  The rules proposed today would require telephone companies,
such as  Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ)  and  AT&T Inc. (T) , to separate
third-party charges more clearly on their bills and to provide
more disclosure about those charges.  The FCC said in an e-mail that the rules would help
subscribers block unauthorized charges. The agency will take
public comment on the rules, which require a vote by the full
commission to take effect.  Last month, the FCC  proposed  a total of $11.7 million in
fines against four telephone companies it said had charged
thousands of consumers for services that they never wanted,
ordered or used.  To contact the reporter on this story:
