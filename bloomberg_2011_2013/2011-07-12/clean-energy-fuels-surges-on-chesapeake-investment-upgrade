Clean Energy Fuels Corp. (CLNE) , the
largest U.S. provider of natural gas fuel for transportation,
jumped in early New York after  Chesapeake Energy Corp. (CHK)  announced
plans to buy $150 million of its convertible bonds and an
analyst upgraded the shares.  Clean Energy rose $1.58, or 12 percent, to $14.70 at 9:13
a.m. in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. Before today, the shares
had declined 13 percent in the past year.  Chesapeake, the most active U.S. natural gas driller,
yesterday said it would purchase Clean Energy’s bonds over three
years, part of its plan to create a $1 billion fund to invest in
companies that develop natural gas for transportation.  Clean Energy today was raised to “outperform” from
“market perform” by Northland Securities analyst Eric Stine
with a 12-month price target of $17 a share.  To contact the reporter on this story:
