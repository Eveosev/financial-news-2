Shale gas produced in  Europe  will be
more expensive than in the U.S. and it won’t be serious
competition for OAO Gazprom,  Lidove Noviny  reported, citing
Gazprom Deputy Chief Executive Officer Alexander Medvedev.  There may be legal, geological, technological, ecological
and other obstacles for transferring the U.S. shale gas
experience to Europe, the Czech newspaper quoted Medvedev as
saying in the interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
