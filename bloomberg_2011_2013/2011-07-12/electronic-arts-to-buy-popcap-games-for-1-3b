Electronic Arts Inc. (ERTS) , the second-
largest U.S. video-game publisher, agreed to buy PopCap Games
for as much as $1.3 billion in cash and stock to extend a drive
into online titles played on websites like Facebook.  Electronic Arts will pay $650 million in cash and $100
million in stock for the producer of games such as “Plants vs.
Zombies” and “Bejeweled,” according to a statement today.
PopCap’s owners may receive as much as $550 million more in
performance-based payments.  The purchase is the biggest yet in the online area for
Electronic Arts, which bought Playfish Inc. in November 2009.
Chief Executive Officer John Riccitiello is seeking $1 billion
in digital sales this fiscal year. Electronic Arts, based in
 Redwood City ,  California , is paying 10 times profit before
interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, Eric Brown, the
company’s chief financial officer, said in an interview.  PopCap, whose titles tend to be popular with women in a
variety of age groups, fits into Electronic Arts’ strategy of
targeting casual players with games for consoles, personal
computers, smartphones and other products, Brown said.  “The key thing is they’re an additional cross-company
platform,” Brown said.  Electronic Arts has been moving to compete with Zynga Inc.,
the biggest application developer on Facebook, for dominance of
the casual game business. Zynga filed for a $1 billion initial
public offering this month.  $100 Million in Sales  Closely held PopCap, based in  Seattle , posted more than
$100 million in revenue last year, and had 40 percent year over
year growth that could accelerate as Electronic Arts expands
distribution in  Europe  and elsewhere, Brown said.  “Zynga is about a successful business based on two games
and one platform,” Brown said. “We’re buying a scale developer
that’s the leader in casual games.”  The acquisition will add 10 cents per share, excluding
items, to fiscal 2013 profit, Brown said.  Electronic Arts also reported preliminary revenue of $500
million to $525 million, excluding items, in the first quarter
that ended last month. The company previously forecast $460
million to $500 million. Analysts projected sales of $488.1
million, the average of 18 in a Bloomberg survey.  The company also put its preliminary loss at 37 cents to 40
cents a share, excluding items, compared with the 44-cent to 49-
cent loss forecast earlier.  Electronic Arts fell 83 cents to $23.34 in extended
trading. The shares lost 22 cents to $24.17 in regular Nasdaq
Stock Market trading and have gained 48 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
