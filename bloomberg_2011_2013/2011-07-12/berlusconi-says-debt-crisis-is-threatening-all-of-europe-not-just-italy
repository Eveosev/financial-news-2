Italian Prime Minister  Silvio
Berlusconi  said that the plunge in the country’s stocks and
bonds in recent days is a threat for the unity of  Europe  and its
single currency.  “The crisis in confidence that has battered financial
markets and hit Italy in recent days is a threat for everyone
and that effects the single currency, the most concrete element
of European unity,” he said in an e-mailed statement.  He said that his government and the opposition parties were
determined to defend that country and that he had support from
EU allies.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
