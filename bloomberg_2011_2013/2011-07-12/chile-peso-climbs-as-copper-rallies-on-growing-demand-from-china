Chile ’s peso climbed for the first
time in three days as copper prices rose on signs that Chinese
demand for the metal is rebounding after a three-month slump.  The peso gained 0.1 percent to 466.79 per  U.S. dollar  at
2:36 p.m. New York time, from 467.34 yesterday.  “Chile’s peso is fundamentally a puppet pulled by copper
and international conditions,” Leonardo Suarez, chief economist
at Larrain Vial SA, said in a phone interview from Santiago.
“When the price of copper rises, the peso usually follows.”  Copper, which accounts for half of Chile’s exports, gained
0.6 percent on the  New York Mercantile Exchange .  China  is the world’s largest copper consumer. Chinese
copper imports rose for the first time in three months in June
as buying from overseas became profitable and supply tightened
after consumers drained local stockpiles. There are “strong
signs” that the country will “come back and buy in a more
aggressive way,” according to Codelco, Chile’s state-owned
copper company and the world’s largest copper producer.  Chile’s one-year interest-rate swap rate, which reflects
traders’ views of future rates, fell three basis points, or 0.03
percentage point, to 5.68 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
