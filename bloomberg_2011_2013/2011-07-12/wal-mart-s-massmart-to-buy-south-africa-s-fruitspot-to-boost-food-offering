Massmart Holdings Ltd. (MSM) , the South

Fruitspot  as part of its strategy to expand its fresh food
offering, said spokesman Brian Leroni.  “It’s a relatively modest transaction,” Leroni said by

its business in butcheries, bakeries and fruit and vegetable
suppliers, Leroni said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
