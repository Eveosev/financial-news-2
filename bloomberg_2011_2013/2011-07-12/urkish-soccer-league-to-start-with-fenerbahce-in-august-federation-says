Turkish soccer authorities won’t
take any action against Fenerbahce SK or other clubs until
prosecutors release all the evidence they’ve gathered in an
investigation alleged match fixing.  The Turkish Football Federation’s discipline procedures
won’t start until any indictment from the investigation accepted
by a court, Chairman Mehmet Ali Aydinlar said in a statement on
the Istanbul-based federation’s website.  The season will start as scheduled on Aug. 5 and the
“Supercup” match between league champions Fenerbahce and cup-
winners Besiktas JK will take place July 31, Aydinlar said.  Click here for web link  To contact the reporter on this story:
