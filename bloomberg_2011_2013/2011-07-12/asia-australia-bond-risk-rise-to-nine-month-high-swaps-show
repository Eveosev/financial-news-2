The cost of insuring Asia-Pacific
corporate and sovereign bonds against non-payment increased,
according to traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 50 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  rose 3 basis points to 121.5 basis
points as of 8:35 a.m. in Singapore, according to Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc. prices. The Markit iTraxx Australia index
also rose 3 basis points to 121.5 as of 10:35 a.m. in Sydney,
Westpac Banking Corp. prices show.  The risk gauges are on track to reach the highest level
since Sept. 24, according to data provider CMA, which is owned
by CME Group Inc. and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the
privately negotiated market.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index advanced 3 basis points as
well to 130 basis points as of 9:36 a.m. in  Tokyo , Deutsche Bank
AG prices show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 of a percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
