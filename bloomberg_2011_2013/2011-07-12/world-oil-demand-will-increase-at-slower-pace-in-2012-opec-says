The Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries forecast world oil demand will grow at a
slower pace for a second year in 2012 as consumption declines 
in  Europe  and slows in other industrialized nations.  Global demand will average 89.5 million barrels a day in
2012, the group’s Vienna-based secretariat said today in its
monthly report, giving its first forecast for next year. That’s
up 1.3 million barrels, or 1.5 percent, on this year’s estimate.  Crude oil consumption has been rising since the last
quarter of 2009, driven by demand in emerging markets including
 China , according to OPEC. Chinese demand will rise by 500,000
barrels a day next year compared with a gain of 150,000 barrels
a day in North America. European use will decline, it said.  “An unsteady world economy is negatively affecting the oil
market and imposing a high range of uncertainty for the short
term,” the organization said in the report.  OPEC members including  Saudi Arabia ,  Iran  and Venezuela
will need to pump more crude to meet rising consumption. Demand
for OPEC oil will climb to 30.3 million barrels a day in 2012,
an increase of 300,000 barrels on this year, the report showed.  The producer group, which accounts for about 40 percent of
global supply, expects crude use of 88.1 million barrels a day
this year, up by 1.4 million barrels on last year.  OPEC’s output rose to 29.6 million barrels a day last
month, the report said. The 11 members bound by quotas produced
26.9 million barrels, the most since 2008. In December of that
year, the group announced record supply cuts amid a collapse in
global demand. It capped supplies for all members except  Iraq  at
24.845 million barrels a day at that meeting.  ‘Worst Meeting’  The organization last met in Vienna in June, when its
members failed to agree on crude output limits for the first
time in at least 20 years. “It was one of the worst meetings
we’ve ever had,” Saudi Oil Minister Ali al-Naimi said.  Saudi Arabia together with Kuwait,  Qatar  and the United
Arab Emirates proposed increasing production quotas at the
meeting. They were blocked by members including Iran and
Venezuela, which warned of a “collapse” in prices.  Non-OPEC supply will rise by about 680,000 barrels a day to
average 53.57 million barrels next year, OPEC said. Shipments
from countries including  Russia , Norway and the U.K. are
estimated at 52.89 million barrels a day this year. Production
growth in  North America , Latin America and the former Soviet
Union will offset declines in Europe, OPEC said.  OPEC’s members are Algeria, Angola, Ecuador, Iran, Iraq,
Kuwait,  Libya , Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab
Emirates and Venezuela.  To contact the reporter on this story:
