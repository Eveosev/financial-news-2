Cia. Brasileira de Distribuicao
Grupo Pao de Acucar tumbled for a seventh day, the longest
losing streak in more than a year, after Casino Guichard-
Perrachon SA’s board said the proposal to merge the retailer
with rival  Carrefour SA (CA) ’s Brazilian unit is “flawed” and
“destroys value.”  Pao de Acucar fell 1.4 percent to 65.36 reais in Sao Paulo
trading at 10:51 a.m. New York time. Shares jumped 13 percent on
June 28, when the merger plan was announced, and have declined
11 percent since then.  “There’s a small chance for this merger plan to go
forward,” Caue Pinheiro, an analyst with SLW Corretora, said in
a telephone interview from Sao Paulo. “Today Casino was
emphatic about the reasons for its opposition to the proposal.”  The proposed merger “grossly” overestimates potential
cost savings, has high execution risks and would reduce Pao de
Acucar’s earnings per share, Saint Etienne, France-based
Casino’s board said today in a statement following a meeting.  Casino and Pao de Acucar Chairman Abilio Diniz are battling
over the Brazilian retailer, which they jointly control through
a joint venture.  Banco BTG Pactual SA’s investment fund Gama proposed the
merger.  To contact the reporter on this story:
