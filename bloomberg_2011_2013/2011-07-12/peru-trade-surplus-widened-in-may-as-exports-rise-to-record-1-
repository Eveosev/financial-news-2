Peru ’s trade surplus widened in May
after higher copper and gold prices pushed the Andean nation’s
exports to a record.  Peru posted a $659 million trade surplus in May, compared
with $390 million in April and $329 million a year earlier, the
country’s National Statistics Institute said today in an e-
mailed report.  Exports jumped 62 percent from a year earlier to $3.83
billion, the agency said. Mining, fishmeal, oil and gas and
agricultural commodities accounted for 79 percent of shipments
overseas. Imports rose 56 percent to $3.17 billion on higher
purchases of fuel, corn, automobiles and computers.  “The strength of import demand suggests that economic
activity, and particularly domestic demand, continued growing at
a strong pace” in the second quarter,  Carola Sandy , an
economist, Credit Suisse AG in  New York , said today in an e-
mailed report. “Investment might not have slowed as much as it
seemed as a result of political uncertainty ahead of the
presidential elections.”  According to a separate statement from the tax and customs
duty collection agency known as Sunat, imports rose 38 percent
in June to $3.3 billion as fuel purchases climbed.  Imports in the first half of the year rose 35 percent last
month from a year earlier to $18.1 billion, Sunat said. The U.S.
supplied 20 percent of Peru’s imports, while  China  and  Brazil 
accounted for 16 percent and 7 percent respectively.  The yield on the nation’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol-
denominated bond due August 2020 fell 1 basis point, or 0.01
percentage point, to 6.30 percent, according to prices compiled
by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
