Italian and Spanish bonds rose on
speculation the  European Central Bank  bought the debt of the
euro region’s most-indebted nations to stabilize markets amid
concern that the debt crisis is worsening.  Greek 10-year yields fell the most in almost two weeks
while equivalent-maturity Spanish yields retreated from a euro-
era record reached earlier. Italian bonds rose, with yields
below 6 percent after breaching the level for the first time
since 1997. The 27 European Union finance ministers continued
meetings today after euro-region officials said late yesterday
that they may revive bond buybacks to ease  Greece ’s debt woes.
An ECB press officer declined to comment on whether it bought
so-called peripheral euro-region bonds today.  “The suspicion has to be that there has been some
unofficial central bank activity this morning, be that the ECB,
or Asian central banks or a combination of the two,” said  John Davies , a fixed-income strategist at WestLB AG in  London . “The
hurdles of the T-bill auctions from Italy, Greece and, to a
lesser degree,  Belgium , were overcome successfully.”  Yields on 10-year Italian bonds declined for the first time
in seven days, falling 12 basis points to 5.56 percent as of
4:33 p.m. in London. The yields climbed as high as 6.02 percent,
widening the spread over German bunds to 318 basis points, a
euro-era record. Spanish 10-year yields were 18 basis points
lower at 5.85 percent, after surging to 6.31 percent, the most
since 1997.  Euro Slips  Irish 10-year bond yields increased 15 basis points to
13.35 percent after reaching a record 13.68 percent. Greek 10-
year yields declined 24 basis points to 16.77 percent while
Portuguese yields of equivalent maturity dropped 82 basis points
to 12.56 percent.  The euro slid to $1.3837, an almost four-month low, while
the Stoxx  Europe  600 Index fell as much as 2.7 percent for the
biggest three-day drop since March.  Ten-year bund yields rose three basis points to 2.70
percent, after reaching as little as 2.50 percent, the least
since November. Two-year German note yields added two basis
points to 1.28 percent, after reaching 1.05 percent, the least
since January.  Investor impatience with the EU’s response to the fiscal
crisis punished the bloc’s most debt-ridden states yesterday,
prompting a surge in borrowing costs across so-called peripheral
states. The 17 euro-area finance ministers issued a six-
paragraph statement yesterday, following a nine-hour meeting in
Brussels, pledging to flesh out details of a new strategy to end
the 21-month-old crisis “shortly,” without setting a timeline.  Closed Short Positions  “Speculation of central bank involvement encouraged short
positions in peripherals to be closed,” said  Peter Chatwell , a
strategist at Credit Agricole Corporate & Investment Bank in
London. “If the ECB were to announce an intention to buy, then
it would have the same effect: shorts would scuttle to cover
their positions.”  Euro-area finance ministers agreed that investors should
play a role in the second bailout of Greece currently being
discussed, European Union Economic and Monetary Affairs
Commissioner  Olli Rehn  told reporters in Brussels today.  “This was lengthily discussed yesterday in the meeting of
the eurogroup, understandably because it’s a difficult issue,”
said Rehn. “The ministers came to a consensual agreement on the
parameters for private-sector involvement.”  Ministers from the 27 EU nations began meeting today with
the aim of crafting a response to the release of bank stress
tests later this week.  Greek Rollover  A new strategy to contain the euro area’s debt crisis may
require reinforcing the European Financial Stability Facility,
the 440 billion-euro bailout fund that was beefed up only last
month. Talks with bondholders over a rollover plan for Greek
debt have been snapped by warnings from credit-rating companies
that the arrangement risked putting Greece in default.  Spanish Finance Minister  Elena Salgado  said her nation
still opposes private-sector involvement in any Greek rescue.  “ Spain ’s position has not changed since this idea was put
on the table in November,” she said in the Senate in  Madrid 
today. “Private investors’ participation is not a good idea; in
fact we think this is one of the causes of instability we’re
suffering from, so we need to find a solution.”  The cost of insuring against default on debt sold by
Europe’s peripheral governments rose to records earlier amid
contagion from the region’s debt crisis.  Credit-Default Swaps  Credit-default swaps on Greece surged 150 basis points to
2,453, signaling an 88 percent probability of default within
five years, according to CMA prices in London, before settling
at 2,324, up 21 basis points from yesterday.  Swaps on Ireland slid 15 basis points to 1,000 after
reaching 1,086,  Italy  slipped 16 to 286 after rising to 343.
 Portugal  dropped 89 basis points to 1,048 after rising to 1,187
and Spain reached 380 basis points before falling 29 to 320,
according to CMA data.  Italy sold 6.75 billion euros of one-year Treasury bills at
an average yield of 3.67 percent at an auction today. Investors
bid for 1.55 times the amount of securities on sale, down from
1.71 times at a previous auction of similar-maturity debt held
June 10, which achieved a yield of 2.147 percent.  Italy is scheduled to sell securities due in April 2016,
February 2017, August 2023 and March 2026 on July 14.  “Though the yield is well up from levels earlier this
year, Italy can afford 3.67 percent,” said  Luca Jellinek , head
of European interest-rate strategy at Credit Agricole CIB.  Debt Auctions  Greek borrowing costs fell at an auction of six-month
Treasury bills. Greece sold 1.625 billion euros of securities at
a yield of 4.90 percent. Investors bid for 2.88 times the amount
of debt on sale. That compares with a so-called bid-to-cover
ratio of 2.58 at a previous sale of similar-maturity debt held
June 14, which was sold at a yield of 4.96 percent.  Belgian 10-year bonds rose, lowering yields on the
securities by three basis points to 4.26 percent. The nation’s
borrowing costs for 12-month Treasury bills rose to the highest
in more than 2 1/2 years as demand for the securities fell at
auction today.  The Treasury sold 1.07 billion euros of 12-month bills,
less than planned, at a weighted average yield of 1.884 percent,
the debt agency in Brussels said. That’s the highest yield since
an auction on Dec. 16, 2008, and compares with a yield of 1.625
percent when similar securities were last sold on June 14.
Investors put in bids for 1.54 times the amount of notes sold,
down from 2.18 times four weeks ago and the lowest bid-to-cover
ratio since Dec. 14 last year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
