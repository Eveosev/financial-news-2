Serbia ’s foreign-exchange reserves
fell to 9.96 billion euros ($13.88 billion) in June as the
country repaid debt to domestic and foreign creditors.  Foreign-exchange reserves fell by a net 97.3 million euros
after Serbia repaid 67.8 million euros to locals whose savings
were frozen in the early 1990s and which the government pays
through a so-called savings bond, the National Bank of Serbia
said in an e-mail today.  Serbia also repaid 48.7 million euros to foreign creditors,
while banks withdrew 20.6 million euros from their mandatory
reserve accounts, kept with the central bank. Inflows included
47.7 million euros raised by the government in the local market
and 5.7 million euros worth of donations, the bank said.  Net reserves, excluding the funds commercial lenders keep
with the central bank and funds from the  International Monetary
Fund , increased to 5.4 billion euros from 5.39 billion euros in
May, the Belgrade-based  Narodna Banka Srbije  said.  That level of the reserves matched 426 percent of M1 money
supply, seven months of goods and services imports and 984
percent of Serbia’s short-term debt, the bank said.  Interbank trading volumes rose in June to 2.06 billion
euros, increasing by 381.9 million euros from May, while the
January through June interbank trading volumes hit 8 billion
euros, it said.  The dinar weakened 5.4 percent against the euro in June,
while remaining 3 percent stronger against the common European
currency this year so far, according to the bank.  The central bank sold 30 million euros in June in interbank
foreign-exchange market to smooth excessive dinar daily swings,
it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
