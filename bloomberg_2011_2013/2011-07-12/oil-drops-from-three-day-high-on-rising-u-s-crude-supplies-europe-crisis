Oil declined from a three-day high
in  New York  as investors bet that increasing U.S. crude supplies
and signs that  Europe ’s debt crisis is spreading indicated
demand for raw materials may falter.  Futures fell as much as 0.9 percent after the American
Petroleum Institute said crude inventories rose for the first
time in six weeks. An Energy Department report today may show
supplies shrank. Prices also dropped after Ireland joined
Portugal and Greece as the third euro-area nation to have its
 credit rating  reduced to below investment grade.  “There’s still concern around the euro-zone,” said  Ben Westmore , a minerals and energy economist at National Australia
Bank Ltd. in Melbourne, who predicts oil in New York will
average $113 a barrel in the third quarter. “The crude market
hasn’t improved much in terms of those supply dynamics. Demand
is still pretty sluggish.”  Crude for August delivery slipped as much as 90 cents to
$96.53 in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange , and was at $96.94 at 11:23 a.m. Sydney time. The
contract yesterday climbed $2.28, or 2.4 percent, to $97.43, the
highest since July 7. Prices are 26 percent higher the past
year.  Brent oil for August settlement fell 50 cents, or 0.4
percent, to $117.25 a barrel on the ICE Futures Europe exchange
in  London . That took the European benchmark contract to a
premium of $20.31 a barrel above U.S. futures, compared with
$20.32 yesterday and the record close of $22.29 on June 15.  Oil Stockpiles  U.S. crude inventories climbed 2.3 million barrels last
week to 359.4 million, the industry-funded American Petroleum
Institute report showed yesterday. The Energy Department today
may say supplies dropped 1.5 million barrels, according to the
median of 15 analyst estimates in a Bloomberg News survey.  Oil-supply totals from the  American Petroleum Institute  and
the Energy Department have moved in the same direction 71
percent of the time over the past year. The API collects
stockpile information on a voluntary basis from operators of
refineries, bulk terminals and pipelines.  Moody’s Investors Service cut Ireland to Ba1 from Baa3,
citing the probability that the country will need additional
official financing and for investors to share in losses before
it can return to the private market to borrow. The outlook
remains “negative,” Moody’s said in a statement yesterday.  The euro fell to a four-month low yesterday against the
dollar as European finance ministers failed to present a
solution to the financial contagion that’s threatening to spread
to  Italy  from  Greece , Ireland and Portugal. In  Spain , Finance
Minister  Elena Salgado  said the nation might need to endure even
deeper spending cuts in 2012 than those currently planned.  Crude Consumption  The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries projected
that world oil demand will average about 88.1 million barrels a
day this year, up 1.4 million from last year. It also said
consumption would grow at a slower pace for a second year in
2012 as usage falls in Europe and other industrialized nations.  Global oil consumption will average 89.5 million barrels a
day in 2012, OPEC’s Vienna-based secretariat said yesterday in
its monthly report, giving its first forecast for next year.
That’s up 1.5 percent from the 2011 estimate.  The Energy Department reduced its price forecast for New
York futures in 2011 to an average $98.43 a barrel from $101.91
in its monthly Short-Term Energy Outlook, released yesterday.
The department also cut its forecast for global consumption for
this year to 88.16 million barrels a day from 88.43 million
estimated last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
