Germany ’s lenders face low
profitability and quality of capital as “pockets of
vulnerabilities remain” in the country’s financial system,
according to the  International Monetary Fund .  “Banks continue to be highly leveraged and the quality of
their capital is low by international standards,” the
Washington-based institution said in a report on Germany today.
“Their profitability is also relatively low and expected to
remain so.”  While German lenders raised capital levels and improved
asset quality in 2010, actions to limit systemic risk in the
financial system are required, including finding a “viable”
business model for state-owned Landesbanken, IMF said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
