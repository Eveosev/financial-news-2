The risks to financial stability
from analysts using  European Union  stress-test data to conduct
their own exams on banks “should not be underestimated,”
according to a confidential document prepared by EU officials.  There is an expectation the  European Banking Authority 
stress-test results will be “challenged by market tests,”
according to the draft document obtained by Bloomberg News. Some
EU member states with lower-rated sovereign debt may struggle to
borrow money to fund their banks, according to the document.  Backstops for banks that fail the exams are “are either
ready or in the process of being prepared,” Polish Finance
Minister Jacek Rostowski told reporters after a meeting with his
EU counterparts in Brussels today. Ministers agreed that they
will have measures ready “extremely fast” to assist these
lenders, he said.  This year’s exams, which will be published on July 15, will
include a review of how lenders would handle a 0.5 percent
economic contraction in the euro area in 2011, a 15 percent drop
in European equity markets as well as possible trading losses on
sovereign debt. The banks will be expected to maintain a core
Tier 1 capital ratio of at least 5 percent under the stress-test
scenarios, the EBA has said.  Lenders that fail the tests would have to “take action
themselves” or obtain public help “within three months,”
Rostowski said.  ‘Sovereign Default’  Since the stress test exercise started, “the market
environment has changed considerably for the worse in respect of
the assessment of the possibility of sovereign default,” the
draft EU document says. “If this scenario persists, the option
of giving the banks some months to strengthen their capital
position may no longer be available for all banks.”  At today’s meeting, finance chiefs hunted for ways to cut
 Greece ’s debt burden, floating ideas from bond buybacks to a
temporary default in an overhaul of a strategy that has failed
to contain the debt panic in the region.  “The conditions in EU financial markets and the economy
have deteriorated since the stress scenarios were envisaged,”
Sony Kapoor, managing director of policy group Re-Define  Europe 
in  London , said in a telephone interview today.  The EU document warns that banks, national regulators and
finance ministries will have to address “contagion effects,”
which could include liquidity risks, a lack of credibility
surrounding recapitalization plans, access to capital market
funding and problems with information sharing among supervisors.  ‘Lower-Rated Countries’  A number of countries have “no dedicated and committed
resolution fund” to recapitalize banks that fail the test,
according to the document. It may prove “increasingly difficult
for lower-rated countries under market expectations of sovereign
default” to borrow money to fund their banks.  Lenders will be made to disclose capital levels, estimates
for profitability in 2011 and 2012 as well as their holdings of
sovereign debt in the tests, the EBA said yesterday.  Banks will also list their holdings of commercial real
estate, residential property, corporate lending and sovereign
debt by country, according to the  template  for the results.  Credit ratings companies should not use the results of the
stress tests as a pretext to carry out downgrades,  Michel Barnier , the EU’s financial-services chief, told reporters in
Brussels.  “Certainly the results of the tests will be one factor but
it should not be the one factor, in their method of
assessment,” he said.  “I want to have transparency in their methods,
particularly when they are rating countries,” Barnier said. The
 European Commission , the 27-nation EU’s executive arm, will make
proposals in November for “strict” regulation of ratings
firms, Barnier said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
