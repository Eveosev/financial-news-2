Serbia will soon publish a tender to
review its existing energy development strategy and then order a
new long-term plan for its energy strategy through 2030.  The current strategy, adopted in 2005 with a development
plan to 2015 needs replacing because “global conditions have
changed so much, we need a whole new concept for electricity
production, for gas supplies, for mining, everything,” said
Deputy Energy Minister Milos Banjac.  The first will be published next week for an assessment of
the “current state of the energy sector and what has been
achieved” from the 2005 document, Banjac said. That should be
completed by year-end and will be followed by a tender in 2012
for putting together the new strategy, he said.  Serbia is seeking to avoid gas shortages such as those last
decade when supplies of Russian gas through Ukraine were halted
following a price dispute between the two ex-Soviet neighbors,
he said.  Since 2005, there’s been “the gas crisis with Ukraine, the
global economic crisis and new environmental requirements for
Serbia as a prospective European Union member” regarding  carbon
emissions , Banjac said.  The Balkan nation must have “well-defined solutions for
its energy sources” over the next two decades, Banjac said. The
ministry will invite researchers, planners and academic
institutions in two tenders, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
