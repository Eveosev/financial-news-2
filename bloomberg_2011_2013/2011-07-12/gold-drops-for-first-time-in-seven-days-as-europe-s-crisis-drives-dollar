Gold futures, little changed in  New
York , may rise for the sixth straight session on mounting demand
for a haven amid Europe’s escalating debt crisis.  The euro fell against the dollar after a meeting of
European Union finance ministers failed to defuse the region’s
escalating fiscal woes. Gold priced in euros and pounds rose to
records.  “With the currency volatility and the debt-contagion risk
in Europe, investors are gravitating toward something tangible
like gold,” said  Adam Klopfenstein , a senior strategist at
Lind-Waldock, a broker in Chicago.  Gold futures for August delivery rose 50 cents to $1,549.70
an ounce at 10:16 a.m. on the Comex in New York. The metal
gained 4.5 percent in the previous five sessions. On May 2, the
price reached a record $1,577.40.  Dennis Gartman , the economist and editor of the Suffolk,
Virginia-based Gartman Letter, said he is cutting his euro-
denominated gold holdings by as much as 50 percent because “too
many people have joined the trade.” He said he remains “quite
bullish” on the metal in the long term.  Gold will trade above $1,600 in the third quarter and
outperform silver, palladium and platinum, Edel Tully, a London-
based analyst at UBS AG, said in a report dated yesterday. UBS
cut its 2011 silver forecast to $36 an ounce from $40, lowered
its palladium outlook to $800 an ounce from $825 and reduced its
platinum estimate to $1,825 an ounce from $1,900.  Silver futures for September delivery dropped 46.8 cents,
or 1.3 percent, to $35.23 an ounce on the Comex. Palladium
futures for September delivery slipped $7.50, or 1 percent, to
$759.95 an ounce on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . Platinum
futures for October delivery fell $1.30 to $1,727 an ounce.  To contact the reporters on this story:
