Commissioners of DeKalb County, an
Atlanta suburb that lost its  Standard & Poor’s  bond rating in
March, raised property taxes today to rebuild its finances.  In a meeting today in Decatur, Georgia, the commission
agreed to increase its  tax rate  by 26 percent, which will bring
in an estimated $50 million in new revenue per year.  The county’s situation exemplifies the challenges facing
local governments as collapsing housing values erode their tax
base. DeKalb County had a 20 percent decline in the value of
taxable property since 2008, County Chief Executive Burrell
Ellis said in a June 7 letter to the commission. Property values
fell three times as fast in the past year, Ellis said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
