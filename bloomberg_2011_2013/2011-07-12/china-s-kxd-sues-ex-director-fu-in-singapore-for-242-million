KXD Digital Entertainment Ltd. (KXD) , a
China-based digital video products supplier whose shares are
suspended in Singapore, said it’s suing former director Liu Fusheng in the city for $242 million citing breach of duties.  KXD is also seeking an inquiry and an account of the
company’s profits from Liu, according to a statement to the
Singapore exchange today. Liu was a director at the Shenzhen-
based company from February 2003 to September 2010.  The company is claiming $211 million, 197.4 million yuan
($31 million) and S$12,977 ($10,560) from Liu, it said.  Two calls made to the phone number listed on the company
website reached a recording that said the number wasn’t in use.  Shares of KXD have been suspended since May 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
