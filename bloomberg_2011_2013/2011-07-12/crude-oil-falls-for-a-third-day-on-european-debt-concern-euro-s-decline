Oil climbed the most in two weeks in
 New York  as European governments worked to halt the region’s
credit crisis.  Futures increased as Italian and Spanish bonds rose amid
speculation the  European Central Bank  bought the debt of the
euro-region’s most-indebted nations to stabilize markets and
ease concern that the credit crisis is worsening. Crude also
gained after failing to sustain a move below the 200-day moving
average and on forecasts that U.S. supplies fell last week.  “The European Union is looking for some type of solution,
and that’s tided us over for now,” said Carl Larry, director of
energy derivatives and research with Blue Ocean LLC in New York.
“Nobody wants to see the European Union fail, so everyone’s
looking for some signs of competence.”  Crude for August delivery rose $2.28, or 2.4 percent, to
settle at $97.43 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  in
the biggest one-day gain since June 28. Prices have risen 30
percent in the past year.  Prices pared gains from the settlement and after the
 American Petroleum Institute  reported at 4:30 p.m. that U.S.
crude-oil stockpiles increased 2.34 million barrels to 359.4
million. August oil rose $1.68, or 1.8 percent, to $96.83 a
barrel in electronic trading at 4:31 p.m.  Brent oil for August settlement increased 51 cents, or 0.4
percent, to $117.75 a barrel on the ICE Futures  Europe  exchange
in  London . The spread between the benchmark New York and London
contracts narrowed to $20.32 a barrel from $22.09 at the
settlement yesterday.  EU Meetings  The 27 European Union finance ministers met further today
after euro-region officials said late yesterday that they may
revive bond buybacks to ease  Greece ’s debt woes and work to end
the 21-month-old European debt crisis. An ECB press officer
declined to comment on whether it bought so-called peripheral
euro-region bonds today.  The euro slipped 0.4 percent to $1.3978 at 4:32 p.m. in New
York. It rebounded from a four-month intraday low of $1.3837. A
stronger euro and weaker dollar boost the appeal of commodities
as an alternative investment to the U.S. currency.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell 0.4 percent to
1,313.64. The  Dow Jones Industrial Average  dropped 58.88 points,
or 0.5 percent, to 12,446.88.  Oil rose after briefly slipping below its 200-day moving
average of $93.77. As it rebounded, it breached resistance at
$95.56, the 23.6 percent retracement level on a Fibonacci study
from May, and the 30-day moving average at $96.56.  ’Poised for $100’  “We’re basically poised for $100 here,” said  John Kilduff , a partner at Again Capital LLC, a New York-based hedge
fund that focuses on energy, citing the moves through the
resistance levels. “It’ll be off to the races to $100.”  Investors use moving averages and Fibonacci charts to
determine levels of support and resistance and predict price
direction when those thresholds are crossed.  U.S. crude oil inventories probably dropped 1.5 million
barrels, or 0.4 percent, to 357.1 million barrels in the seven
days ended July 8, according to the median of 15 analysts in a
Bloomberg News survey before an Energy Department report
tomorrow. That would be the sixth week of declines.  The Energy Department reduced its  crude oil  price forecast
for 2011 to an average $98.43 a barrel from $101.91 in its
monthly  Short-Term Energy Outlook , released today.  The department also cut its forecast for global oil
consumption for this year to 88.16 million barrels a day from
88.43 million estimated last month.  Demand Outlook  The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries projected
earlier today that world oil demand will average 88.2 million
barrels a day this year, up 1.4 million barrels, or 1.6 percent,
from last year. It also said consumption would grow at a slower
pace for a second year in 2012 as usage declines in Europe and
other industrialized nations.  Global oil consumption will average 89.5 million barrels a
day in 2012, OPEC’s Vienna-based secretariat said today in its
monthly report, giving its first forecast for next year. That’s
up 1.3 million barrels, or 1.5 percent, from the 2011 estimate.  The trade deficit in the U.S. widened in May to the highest
level in almost three years, reflecting a surge in the cost of
imported crude oil. The U.S. is the world’s largest oil
consuming country.  The gap grew 15 percent to $50.2 billion, exceeding all
forecasts of 73 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News and the
biggest deficit since October 2008, Commerce Department figures
showed today in  Washington .  U.S. oil imports fell 11 percent to 8.72 million barrels a
day in April from the year earlier, according to the latest
monthly Energy Department import figures.  Oil volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was 636,121
contracts as of 4:34 p.m. in New York. Volume totaled 594,115
contracts yesterday, 13 percent below the average of the past
three months. Open interest was 1.54 million contracts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
