The euro was 0.9 percent from a
four-month low against the dollar on concern  Europe ’s debt
crisis is spreading as Ireland became the third euro-area nation
to have its  credit rating  cut to below investment grade.  The 17-nation currency was 0.6 percent from a record low
versus the Swiss franc before the Italian Treasury sells as much
as 5 billion euros ($7 billion) of bonds tomorrow. The yen rose
to its highest against the greenback since March 17, the day
before the Group of Seven countries jointly intervened in
 currency markets . Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke 
 delivers  his semi-annual report on monetary policy today.  “The euro is a sell on rallies at the moment as I can’t
see any light yet out of Europe,” said  Matthew Brady , executive
director for foreign exchange at JPMorgan Chase & Co. in Sydney.
“ Italy  is a big concern and it’s the whole contagion trade.”  The euro traded at $1.3965 as of 8:09 a.m. in Tokyo from
$1.3976 in New York yesterday when it declined to $1.3837, the
weakest since March 11. It fetched 110.78 yen from 110.74 yen
yesterday when it reached 109.58, the least since March 17. The
franc was little changed at 1.16233 per euro after yesterday
touching 1.15533, the most on record.  The dollar traded at 79.33 yen from 79.24 after earlier
touching 78.50 yen.  Italy ‘Weak’  Moody’s Investors Service cut Ireland to Ba1 from Baa3
yesterday, citing the probability that Ireland will require
additional official financing and investors will need to share
in losses before it can return to the private market to borrow.
The outlook remains “negative,” Moody’s said in a statement.  The  International Monetary Fund  said yesterday Italy is
experiencing a “weak” recovery driven by exports and urged the
nation to continue pursuing fiscal consolidation. The IMF sees
Italy’s economy growing 1 percent in 2011, it said in an e-
mailed statement.  Italy is the euro region’s biggest bond market, with 1.8
trillion euros of outstanding debt as of Dec. 31, compared with
1.1 trillion euros of German debt outstanding on March 31,
according to websites from the nations’ debt agencies.  “The euro is playing the leading role in the currency
market because of the region’s sovereign debt situation,” said
 Daisaku Ueno , president of Gaitame.com Research Institute Ltd.
in Tokyo, a unit of Japan’s largest online currency broker.
“While the euro is trying lower levels, safe-haven currencies
such as the yen, dollar, Swiss franc are being bought.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
