Bank of America Corp. (BAC) , the biggest
U.S. lender by assets, is urging a review of how companies,
their advisers and underwriters manage initial public offerings
in  Europe  amid “widespread dissatisfaction” from clients.  The bank proposed more transparency on fees paid to sale
arrangers, according to a copy of a letter sent yesterday to
investors, companies planning IPOs and their shareholders
obtained by Bloomberg News.  Companies in western Europe are struggling to complete IPOs
as the region’s sovereign debt crisis roils stock markets and
clouds the economic outlook. At least 21 IPOs were pulled or
delayed in the region this year, almost twice the number last
year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Bank of America
is the fifth-ranked manager of IPOs in Europe, the  Middle East 
and  Africa  this year, the data show.  Advisers that companies sometimes hire to assist them in
picking underwriters shouldn’t act as a “force for conflict,”
the investment bank said. Companies that select more than two or
three banks to manage IPOs should establish clear leadership
among the underwriters, the lender said.  Independent analysts who aren’t linked to the banks
managing an IPO should also be allowed to write research on
companies before they sell stock, the firm said. Issuers should
also determine the structure of their management boards before
starting IPOs, the document proposed. The Financial Times
earlier reported the letter earlier today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
