Indonesia ’s rupiah fell for a second
day and stocks slumped on concern  Europe ’s sovereign debt crisis
is spreading to its largest economies, reducing demand for
emerging-market assets.  The MSCI Asia-Pacific Index of regional shares dropped by
the most in almost a month after yields on Italy’s and  Spain ’s
10-year bonds climbed to the highest levels in at least a decade
even amid European Union efforts to prevent a Greek default. The
Jakarta Composite Index of stocks lost 1 percent, the biggest
drop since June 16.  Bank Indonesia  kept its benchmark lending
rate at 6.75 percent today, after raising it by a quarter
percentage point in February.  “The entire euro-zone concerns have returned and people
are now talking about  Italy  probably in trouble,” said Gundy Cahyadi, a Singapore-based economist at Oversea-Chinese Banking
Corp.  The rupiah declined 0.4 percent to 8,553 per dollar as of
4:44 p.m. in Jakarta, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
That’s the biggest drop since June 16.  Indonesia’s government failed to sell Islamic bonds in an
auction today, as investors demanded higher yields than the
government was willing to offer, Dahlan Siamat, director of
Islamic finance at the Ministry of Finance said in a mobile-
phone text-message today. The offer attracted 1.12 trillion
rupiah of bids, Siamat said.  Ten-year notes fell for a second day. The yield on the 8.25
percent debt due July 2021 climbed four basis points, or 0.04
percentage point, to 7.32 percent, according to prices from the
Inter-Dealer Market Association.  To contact the reporter on this story:
