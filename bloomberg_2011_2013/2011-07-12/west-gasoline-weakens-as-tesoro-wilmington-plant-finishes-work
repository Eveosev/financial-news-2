Spot gasoline in the West weakened
as  Tesoro Corp. (TSO)  finishes scheduled work on a unit at its  Los
Angeles  refinery and  Valero Energy Corp. (VLO)  said the coker at its
Benicia refinery was operating at planned rates.  Prompt-delivery of California-blend gasoline, or Carbob, in
Los Angeles fell 3 cents to a discount of 12.25 cents versus
futures traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  as of 3:58
p.m. New York time. The discount narrowed 1.25 cents yesterday
after Tesoro and Valero reported flaring at their plants.  Tesoro extended a notice of potential flaring at its
Wilmington,  California , refinery until today as it finishes
planned work on a unit, said Mike Marcy, a company spokesman
based in Martinez, California.  Valero reported a failed check valve on a coker at its
Benicia refinery, north of  San Francisco .  “The problem with the valve at the coker didn’t have a
material impact to production, and the coker is at planned
rates,” Bill Day, a spokesman at the company’s headquarters in
San Antonio, said in an e-mail today.  The discount for Carbob in San Francisco widened 4.5 cents
to 13.5 cents a gallon versus futures.  The discount for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in
 Portland , Oregon, weakened 0.5 cent to 2 cents versus futures.  The premium for low-sulfur California diesel in Los Angeles
narrowed 1.25 cents to 4.75 cents a gallon versus Nymex heating
oil futures. The premium for the same fuel in San Francisco
weakened 2.75 cents to 2.75 cents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
