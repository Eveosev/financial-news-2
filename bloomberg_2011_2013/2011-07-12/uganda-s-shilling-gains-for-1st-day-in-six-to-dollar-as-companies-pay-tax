Uganda ’s shilling appreciated for
the first day in six against the dollar as companies eased
demand for the U.S. currency as they prepared to make local
value-added tax payments.  The currency of  Africa ’s second-biggest coffee producer
strengthened as much as 0.4 percent to 2,600 per dollar and
traded 0.2 percent up at 2,605 by 3:41 p.m. in Kampala, the
capital.  “We are seeing demand for the dollar easing off,” Faisal
Bukenya, a currency trader at the Kampala-based unit of Barclays
Bank Plc, said by phone. “Companies just paid their annual
taxes last month and now there is VAT which must be paid in
local currency.”  The central bank has sold dollars in the domestic foreign-
exchange market at least four times since June 15 as the
currency slumped to its weakest level since 1993 on June 30,
making it the third-worst performer worldwide after Suriname’s
dollar and Maldive’s rufiyaa. Inflation in the East African
country accelerated to a 17-year high of 16 percent in May,
before slowing to 15.8 percent last month.  Demand for dollars may increase after companies conclude
VAT payments, which may force the shilling to weaken if the
central bank doesn’t sell dollars to support it, said Bukenya.  “Once the tax obligations are finished, we shall see
dollar demand rising as companies make more sales,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
