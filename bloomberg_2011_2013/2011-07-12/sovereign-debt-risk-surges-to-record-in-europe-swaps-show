The cost of insuring against default
on debt sold by  Europe ’s peripheral governments rose to records
amid contagion from the region’s debt crisis.  Credit-default swaps on  Greece  surged 150 basis points to
2,453, signaling an 88 percent probability of default within
five years, according to CMA prices at 9:30 a.m. in London.
Swaps on Ireland soared 71 basis points to 1,086,  Italy  jumped
41 to 343,  Portugal  climbed 50 to 1,187 and  Spain  rose 31 to 380
basis points.  Investors are betting the crisis that forced Greece,
Ireland and Portugal to seek international bailouts will engulf
Spain and Italy. European finance chiefs cast about for a new
strategy to halt Greece’s debt spiral as bond yields in Italy
and Spain surged to records.  “The sovereign crisis has now entered a new stage, with
contagion clearly being felt everywhere in the periphery,” said
Markus Ernst, a strategist at UniCredit SpA in London.  The Markit iTraxx SovX Western Europe Index of swaps on 15
governments increased 20 basis points to an all-time high 311.
An increase signals deteriorating perceptions of  credit quality .  Contracts on the Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 40
companies with mostly high-yield credit ratings jumped as much
as 31.5 basis points to 482.5, the highest since Dec. 1, before
trading at 472, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.  The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125 companies with
investment-grade ratings rose 5.75 basis points to 125.25 basis
points, the highest since July 2010. The Markit iTraxx Financial
Index linked to senior debt of 25 banks and insurers increased
10 basis points to 195 and the subordinated index climbed 13 to
337.5, both the highest since January.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($13.9 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer
face value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
