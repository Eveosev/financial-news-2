3M Co. (MMM) , the maker of Scotch tape and
 Post-it Notes , filed a lawsuit claiming that the Purell Instant
Hand Sanitizer made by Gojo Industries Inc. infringes one of its
patents.  The patent is for a “foamable alcohol composition” that
can be used as a disinfectant, according to the complaint filed
yesterday by 3M in federal court in Minneapolis. 3M said it
first sued Gojo in January, when the patent was issued. It
dropped the suit after receiving an affidavit by Gojo President
Mark Lerner “that no accused product had been made or sold”
since the patent was issued.  “However, 3M has now learned that, contrary to the Lerner
affidavit, Purell Instant Hand Sanitizer Foam having the accused
formulations has been made and sold” by closely held Gojo,  St.
Paul , Minnesota-based 3M said in the complaint.  Gojo, based in Akron, Ohio, has said it invented Purell in
1988 for use in food-service and health-care businesses. It
later sold the brand, and last year bought it back from  Johnson
& Johnson (JNJ) ’s consumer products unit for undisclosed terms.  The case is 3M Innovative Properties Co. v Gojo Industries
Inc., 11cv1867, U.S. District Court for the District of
Minnesota (Minneapolis).  To contact the reporter on this story:
