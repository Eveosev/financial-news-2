Peru ’s central bank purchased the
most dollars in seven weeks to slow gains in the sol as demand
from Peruvian exporters pushed the currency to its strongest
level since at least 2008.  The central bank bought $79 million in the spot currency
market and paid an average of 2.7420 soles per  U.S. dollar , it
said on its website.  The sol gained 0.1 percent to 2.7420 per U.S. dollar at
today’s close, from 2.7450 yesterday, according to Deutsche
Bank’s local unit. That’s the currency’s strongest level since
at least December 2008.  Peruvian exporters led by mining companies bought soles to
pay local income taxes and biannual worker bonuses, said  Mario Guerrero , an economist at Scotiabank Peru. A rising supply of
dollars into the local market boosted the net position of
Peruvian banks to $497 million as of July 8, compared with $347
million in the July 1 to July 5 period, according to the central
bank.  “There’s higher demand for soles from companies for
seasonal reasons, so the central bank had to step in and absorb
some of the dollar supply,” Guerrero said. “We could see
pressure on the sol for a few more days and therefore further
purchases by the central bank.”  The yield on the nation’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol-
denominated bond due August 2020 fell one basis point, or 0.01
percentage point, to 6.30 percent, according to prices compiled
by Bloomberg.  The extra yield investors demand to own Peruvian  government
bonds  instead of U.S. Treasuries rose five basis points to a
two-week high of 1.91 percentage point at 4:24 p.m. New York
time, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.  To contact the reporter on this story:
