Japanese stock futures fell as
growing concern that the government-debt crisis is spreading in
Europe pushed down the euro, weakening the outlook for earnings
at Asian exporters. Australian futures were little changed.  American depositary receipts of  Sony Corp. (6758) , a Japanese
electronics maker which derives 20 percent of its sales in
Europe, declined 1.2 percent from the closing share price in
Tokyo. Those of Honda Motor Co., a carmaker which gets more than
80 percent of its sales abroad, lost 1.2 percent. ADRs of
 National Australia Bank Ltd. (NAB) , the nation’s third-biggest lender
by revenue, slid 0.1 percent.  Futures on Japan’s  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average expiring in
September closed at 9,810 in Chicago yesterday, compared with
9,920 in Osaka. They were bid in the pre-market at 9,840 in
Osaka at 8:05 a.m. local time. Futures on Australia’s S&P/ASX
200 Index were little changed today. New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index
slid 0.3 percent in Wellington.  “If the yen remains at levels higher than companies’
estimates, there will be no way exporters can avoid a negative
impact on their earnings,” said  Hiroichi Nishi , an equities
manager in  Tokyo  at SMBC Nikko Securities Inc. “If the yen
continues to strengthen sharply, expectations for intervention
to sell the Japanese currency will increase.”  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slid 0.2 percent
today. The index dropped 0.4 percent to 1,313.64 in New York
yesterday after the downgrading of Ireland’s credit rating to
junk added to concerns Europe is losing control of the credit
crisis and overshadowed evidence the  Federal Reserve  hasn’t
ruled out more stimulus.  Yen Rises  Ireland’s credit rating was cut to Ba1, non-investment
grade, from Baa3 by Moody’s, joining Portugal and Greece to
become the third euro-area country to be lowered to junk. The
outlook remains negative. Portugal’s rating was cut four levels
to Ba2 on July 5 by Moody’s.  The yen appreciated to 109.63 against the euro, compared
with 111.87 at the close of  stock trading  in Tokyo yesterday, a
level not seen since Jan. 12. Against the dollar,  Japan ’s
currency strengthened to 78.50, the highest level since March 17,
from 80.13. A stronger yen reduces income at Japanese companies
when overseas revenue is converted into their home currency.  In the U.S., policymakers continued to debate whether
additional stimulus will be needed if the outlook for economic
growth remains weak, minutes from the Federal Open Market
Committee’s June meeting showed yesterday.  Some members noted the committee might need to consider
further stimulus, while others voiced concern about an increased
inflation risk that might warrant tighter monetary policy.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index lost 2.4 percent this year
through yesterday, compared with a gain of 4.5 percent by the
 S&P 500  and a drop of 2.8 percent by the Stoxx  Europe  600 Index.
Stocks in the Asian benchmark are valued at 13.5 times estimated
earnings on average, compared with 13.2 times for the S&P 500
and 10.7 times for the Stoxx 600.  To contact the reporter on this story:
