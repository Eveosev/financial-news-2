Iraq  isn’t currently seeking to buy
U.S. F-16 fighter jets made by  Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT)  because it
lacks the funds to rebuild its  air force , government spokesman
Ali al-Dabbagh said.  “Iraq is determined to rebuild its air power capabilities,
but the plan is postponed,” al-Dabbagh said in a telephone
interview from  Baghdad . “There are no new negotiations by the
Iraqi government or the defense ministry,” he said. The defense
portfolio is held by Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki.  The Wall Street Journal reported earlier today that Iraq
has started negotiations to buy U.S. fighter jets  The Iraqi government was close to signing an agreement on
the purchase last year before plans were delayed when funds were
diverted for food rations and other urgent items, al-Dabbagh
said.  “The plan was postponed, but not canceled as we will
rebuild our armed forces in the next few years when there will
be more liquidity,” the spokesman said.  Iraq requested on Aug. 27, 2008, for information on pricing
and availability of 36 U.S. F-16 aircraft, manufactured by
Bethesda, Maryland-based Lockheed, Vanessa Murray, director of
legislative and public affairs at the Pentagon’s  Defense
Security Cooperation Agency , said The plan was revived a few
months ago until Iraq’s parliament agreed to divert funds for
fighter jets to social programs.  Iraq is struggling to rebuild its army and security forces
to end the violence that has engulfed the country since the
U.S.-led invasion that ousted the regime of President  Saddam Hussein . U.S. troops are due to withdraw from Iraq by the end of
the year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
