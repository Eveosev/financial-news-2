Euro-area finance ministers agreed
that investors should play a role in the second bailout of
 Greece  currently being discussed, European Union Economic and
Monetary Affairs Commissioner  Olli Rehn  said.  “This was lengthily discussed yesterday in the meeting of
the eurogroup, understandably because it’s a difficult issue,”
Rehn told reporters in Brussels today. “The ministers came to a
consensual agreement on the parameters for private-sector
involvement.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
