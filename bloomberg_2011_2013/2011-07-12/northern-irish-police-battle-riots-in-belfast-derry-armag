    July 13 (Bloomberg) - Northern Ireland police have appealed
for “calm’’ after two nights of rioting have left 22 police
officers injured as disturbances broke out in  Belfast , Derry and
Armagh, amid the U.K. province’s annual ‘marching season.’  Catholics threw petrol bombs, bricks and bottles at police
in north Belfast in clashes that began yesterday after a
Protestant parade passed a nationalist area. Riots have broken
out in north Belfast, downtown Belfast, Derry, the region’s
second largest city and Armagh and police have used plastic
bullets and water cannon to quell the rioters.  “We have unfortunately witnessed first hand this evening
how violence damages people’s homes and businesses, it sets back
relationships and leaves wounds which take time to heal,”
Assistant Chief Constable Alistair Finlay said in an e-mailed
statement. “It is not representative.’’  Protestants annually celebrate a 17th century victory over
Catholics in Ireland each year, with parades commemorating the
battle culminating in hundreds of marches on July 12. Some of
the parades passed by Catholic areas, causing tension and
provoking unrest. Last year Catholics rioted for four days after
a Protestant parade passed by a nationalist area.  To contact the reporter on this story: Colm Heatley in Belfast
