Asian stocks fell, with the regional
benchmark index heading for the biggest two-day loss since March
15, after U.S. lawmakers failed to agree on cutting the deficit
and concern increased that Greece’s debt crisis may spread to
bigger European nations, threatening bank earnings.  Sony Corp. (6758) , which sells about 21 percent of its PlayStation
game consoles and other products in  Europe , retreated 3 percent
in  Tokyo . Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc.,  Japan ’s biggest
publicly traded bank, declined 2.9 percent.  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) ,
Europe’s No. 1 lender by market value, dropped 3 percent in  Hong
Kong .  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , the world’s biggest mining company and
an oil producer, lost 1.9 percent as crude and metal prices
dropped.  “People are worried about the negative impact on financial
systems as it’s looking more and more like the debt crisis in
Europe will spread from Greece, Ireland and Portugal to bigger
countries such as Italy and Spain,” said Yumi Nishimura, an
equity-market analyst at Daiwa Securities Capital Markets Co.  The MSCI  Asia  Pacific Index decreased 1.9 percent to 134.26
as of 6:10 p.m. in Tokyo, headed for its steepest drop since
June 16. Almost 14 stocks fell for each that rose on the measure.
The gauge last week extended its rally to a third week as
European Union leaders hammered out proposals to roll over debt
to prevent Greece from defaulting and after reports showed
retail sales in the U.S. increased in June, and initial claims
for unemployment benefits declined.  Europe Bailout  Every major market in Asia fell today. Japan’s  Nikkei 225 (NKY) 
Stock Average declined 1.4 percent. South Korea’s Kospi Index
dropped 2.2 percent. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index sank 3.1
percent, while  China ’s Shanghai Composite Index lost 1.7 percent.
 Australia ’s S&P/ASX 200 Index dipped 1.9 percent.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slid 1.1 percent
today. In  New York , the index retreated 1.8 percent to 1,319.49
yesterday. President Barack Obama said he will continue to press
congressional leaders for a package of deficit cuts. German
newspaper Die Welt cited unidentified “high-ranking” people at
central banks in a report saying Euro-area countries may have to
double their bailout fund to 1.5 trillion euros ($2.1 trillion)
to cover a crisis in Italy.  Exporters to Europe fell after German Finance Minister
 Wolfgang Schaeuble  said “there’s no discussion whatsoever” of
doubling the EU’s rescue facility after the Die Welt report.
European finance ministers revived the prospect of bond buybacks
to ease Greece’s plight and declined to rule out a temporary
default, struggling to contain the debt crisis as investors
forced 10-year yields on Italian debt to the highest level in a
decade.  Exporters Drop  Sony, Japan’s biggest exporter of consumer electronics,
dropped 3 percent to 2,136 yen in Tokyo.  Canon Inc. (7751) , the world’s
largest camera maker that gets about 32 percent of sales from
Europe, slipped 1.8 percent to 3,795 yen.  Esprit Holdings Ltd. (330) ,
the Hong Kong-based clothier that counts Europe as its main
source of revenue, sank 5.8 percent to HK$22.85.  HTC Corp. (2498) , the Taiwanese maker of smartphones, slumped 6.9
percent to NT$915 after Apple Inc. accused the company of
infringing patents in case that may halt the shipment of HTC
phones and tablet computers to the U.S., its biggest market.  Gauges of financial companies, energy producers and raw
material supplier led declines among the 10 industry groups in
the MSCI Asia-Pacific Index. All of the sub-indexes dropped.  HSBC fell 3 percent to HK$74.75, its biggest decline since
March 1.  Standard Chartered Plc (STAN) , the U.K.’s third-biggest bank
by market value, slid 2.7 percent to HK$196.60 in Hong Kong.
Mitsubishi UFJ dropped 2.9 percent to 397 yen in Tokyo.  The spreads investors demand to hold Italian, Portuguese
and Spanish debt over German bunds widened to euro-era records,
sparking concern costs may rise for Asia-Pacific banks.  Australian Banks  Australia’s big four banks rely on wholesale debt markets
for funding, accounting for 40 percent of liabilities, making
them vulnerable to swings in investor confidence, Moody’s
Investors Service said in May.  Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) , the nation’s largest lender
by market value, lost 1.8 percent to HK$49.64. Westpac Banking
Corp., the second-biggest, dropped 2.1 percent to A$21.14.
Smaller rival Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. fell
2.2 percent to HK$21.08.  Raw material producers declined after crude oil and metal
futures dropped. BHP slipped 1.9 percent to A$43.46. Rio Tinto
Group, the world’s second-biggest mining company by sales, slid
2.1 percent to A$81.43.  Inpex Corp. (1605) , Japan’s No. 1 energy
explorer, decreased 4.6 percent to 584,000 yen  Crude oil for August delivery fell 1.1 percent to $95.15 a
barrel in New York yesterday, the lowest level since July 1. The
London Metal Exchange Index of prices for six industrial metals
including copper and aluminum dropped 1.6 percent, the biggest
drop since June 2.  ‘Red Flags’  Longfor Properties Co., the developer controlled by China’s
richest woman Wu Yajun, tumbled 10 percent to HK$12.34 in Hong
Kong, the second-biggest decline in the MSCI Asia-Pacific Index.
The company is seeking to raise HK$4 billion ($513 million) from
a so-called top-up placement, the Hong Kong Economic Journal
reported today, citing a prospectus. Longfor said it hasn’t
entered into an agreement on the placement reported today.  West China Cement Ltd. slumped 14 percent to HK$2.43 after
Moody’s said the maker of the construction material posed the
biggest governance and accounting risks of 61 Chinese companies
it analyzed. All 61 companies Moody’s examined raised “red
flags,” with West China Cement, Winsway Coking Coal Holdings,
China Lumena New Materials Corp., Hidili Industry International
Development Ltd. and LDK Solar Co. cited as “negative
outliers.”  The Asian gauge lost 0.6 percent this year through
yesterday, compared with a gain of 4.9 percent by the S&P 500
and a drop of 2.1 percent by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. Stocks
in the Asian benchmark are valued at 13.5 times estimated
earnings on average, compared with 13.3 times for the S&P 500
and 10.8 times for the Stoxx 600.  Among stocks that advanced,  Macarthur Coal Ltd. (MCC) , the
world’s biggest producer of pulverized coal, surged 37 percent
to A$15.14, the most on the regional benchmark index.
ArcelorMittal, the world’s largest steelmaker, and Peabody
Energy Corp. said yesterday they offered to buy the Australian
coal producer for A$4.7 billion ($5 billion), or A$15.50 a share.  To contact the reporters on this story:
