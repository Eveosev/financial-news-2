Stocks in Switzerland dropped for a
third day, dragging the  Swiss Market Index (SMI)  to its lowest level
in two weeks, amid mounting concern that the European sovereign-
debt crisis has spread to  Italy .  UBS AG (UBSN)  and  Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) , Switzerland’s biggest
banks, declined more than 1 percent.  Holcim Ltd. (HOLN) , the world’s
second-largest cement maker, fell 2.2 percent.  The SMI, a measure of the largest and most actively traded
companies, declined 0.6 percent to 6,014.84 at the 5:30 p.m.
close in Zurich, the lowest close since June 28. The broader
Swiss Performance Index also retreated 0.6 percent today.  “The macro uncertainty is putting a strain on the global
equity markets,” said Urs Beck, equities portfolio manager at
Zuercher Kantonalbank in Zurich. “The uncertainty will remain
for several months.”  The SMI has tumbled 10 percent since its high this year on
Feb. 18 as U.S. manufacturing and job reports missed economists’
estimates. Strategists define a drop of 10 percent or more in an
index as a correction.  The gauge pared a drop of as much as 2.6 percent today as
Italian and Spanish bonds rose amid speculation that the
 European Central Bank  has bought the debt of the euro region’s
most-indebted nations to stabilize markets.  The 17 euro-area governments pledged to flesh out a new
master plan after nine hours of talks yesterday. The meetings
resumed today with all 27 European Union finance ministers
plotting a response to the release of bank stress tests later
this week.  UBS, Credit Suisse  UBS slipped 1.9 percent to 14 Swiss francs, the stock’s
lowest price since February 2010. Credit Suisse fell 1.3 percent
to 30.55 francs.  Holcim slid 2.2 percent to 58 francs, its lowest price in
almost two years, after JPMorgan Chase & Co. analysts including
 Michael Morris  reduced their price estimate for the company’s
shares to 77.20 francs from 95.70 francs.  Cie. Financiere Richemont SA, the owner of the Cartier
watch brand, dropped 1.4 percent to 54.70 francs as Patrik Schwendimann, an analyst at Zuercher Kantonalbank, cut the
shares to “underweight” from “overweight.” Swatch Group AG,
the world’s largest watch maker, slid 0.9 percent to 420.80
francs.  Swiss Reinsurance Co., the world’s second-biggest
reinsurer, declined 1.2 percent to 45.53 francs as Michael Huttner, an analyst at JPMorgan Chase & Co., cut his price
estimate for the stock to 65 francs from 68 francs.  Kuoni Reisen Holding AG (KUNN) , a travel company, slumped 3.6
percent to 313.50 francs, its biggest drop since March, after
Thomas Cook Group Plc,  Europe ’s second-largest tour operator,
cut its full-year profit forecast. Thomas Cook said its
underlying operating profit may fall to 320 million pounds ($510
million) from 362 million pounds in 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
