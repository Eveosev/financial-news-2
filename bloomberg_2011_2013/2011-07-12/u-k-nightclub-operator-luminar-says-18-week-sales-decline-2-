Luminar Group Holdings Plc (LMR) , a U.K.
operator of bars, restaurants and nightclubs, reported same
outlet sales in the 18 weeks to July 2 fell 11.7 percent.  Luminar is in talks with lenders over restructuring its
debt, the  Milton Keynes , southern England-based company said
today in a regulatory statement. For the year ended Feb. 26 net
interest costs increased to 8.7 million pounds ($13.9 million)
while debt fell from 140 million pounds to 91.5 million pounds,
the company said in May.  “We are downgrading our 2012 forecasts from 4.2 million
pounds($6.7 million) loss before tax to 7.3 million pounds by
assuming like-for-like sales fall by 9 percent,” wrote analysts
at Numis Securities Ltd. in a notes to clients today. Numis
Securities acts as joint broker and financial adviser to
Luminar.  The company’s shares have fallen 58.8 percent so far this
year, giving Luminar a market value of 6.51 million pounds. The
shares fell 2 percent to 6.49 pence at the 4:30 p.m. close in
 London .  “The fundamental issue remains that the debt level is
uncomfortably high and the economic backdrop is likely to remain
unhelpful for some time,” wrote Greg Feehely, an analyst at
Altium Capital Ltd., in London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
