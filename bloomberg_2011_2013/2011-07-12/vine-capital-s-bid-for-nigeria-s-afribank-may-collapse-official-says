Vine Capital Partners Ltd.’s plans
to acquire Nigeria’s Afribank Plc may fail because the country’s
central bank won’t approve the transaction, an official at
Afribank said, declining to be identified because the
information has not been made public.  Fidelity Bank Plc (FIDELITY) , another Nigerian lender that had
previously expressed interest in acquiring Lagos-based Afribank,
is waiting for permission from the central bank to resume talks,
an official at Fidelity, which is also based in Lagos, said,
declining to be named for the same reasons.  Vine Capital officials declined to comment and didn’t
immediately respond to an e-mailed query. The central bank
declined to immediately comment.  Afribank was one of the banks that received part of the 620
billion naira ($4.1 billion) bail out of banks by the Central
Bank of Nigeria in 2009. The central bank is now overseeing the
sale of all or part of some of the banks.  Afribank’s stock fell by the daily limit of 5 percent to 95
kobo in Lagos today, its lowest level since 2002. Fidelity also
fell 5 percent to 2.28 naira, a level last reached in October.  The likely collapse of the talks was reported earlier by
 Nigeria ’s BusinessDay newspaper.  To contact the reporters on this story:
