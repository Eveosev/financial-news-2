Union Bank Nigeria Plc (UBN)  will receive
$750 million in new capital after the country’s second-oldest
bank signed an “implementation agreement” with a group led by
private equity company African Capital Alliance.  “With this development, the bank’s recapitalization
process is progressing,” the Lagos-based lender said in an e-
mailed statement late yesterday. Additional funding to meet
 capital requirements  will come from existing shareholders and
the Asset Management Corp. of  Nigeria , it said.  Union Bank is one of eight lenders bailed out by the
central bank in 2009 with the injection of 620 billion naira
($4.1 billion) after a financial crisis that roiled  Africa ’s
largest oil producer. The central bank fired eight lender chief
executive officers, called for bids for stakes in the banks and
has set a Sept. 30 deadline for their recapitalization.  “It is a mutually beneficial deal for both parties,”
Ifeanyi Odunwa, managing director of Lagos-based Investment
Centre Ltd., said by phone on the agreement by Union Bank.
“African Capital Alliance will benefit from the depth of Union
Bank’s business just as Union Bank needs the fund to jump-start
its business and deliver higher returns on investment.”  Union Bank’s shares gained 2.2 percent, the most in a week,
to 2.35 naira at the 2:30 p.m. end of trading in Lagos today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
