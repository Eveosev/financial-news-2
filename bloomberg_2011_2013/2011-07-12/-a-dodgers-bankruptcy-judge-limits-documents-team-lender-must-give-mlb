The judge overseeing the Los Angeles
Dodgers bankruptcy restricted the scope of information  Major
League Baseball  can get from the team’s proposed lender, saying
it was seeking data that isn’t relevant.  U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Kevin Gross said JPMorgan Chase &
Co.’s Highbridge Capital Management LLC doesn’t have to provide
an internal analysis of its proposed $150 million financing
package. The only information baseball officials need is what’s
directly related to the loan, Gross said.  “Usually we don’t have these kinds of battles in advance
of a credit agreement,” Gross said during a hearing today in
Wilmington, Delaware.  The ruling is part of a dispute between baseball and
Dodgers’ owner  Frank McCourt  over who will fund the team while
it tries to reorganize and exit bankruptcy. Both sides are
collecting information from each other for a July 20 hearing
where the Dodgers’ will ask Gross to approve the Highbridge
loan.  Gross already has given the team temporary approval to
borrow as much as $60 million from Highbridge.  The Dodgers filed for bankruptcy on June 27 after Baseball
Commissioner  Bud Selig  rejected a proposed cable television-
rights deal McCourt negotiated with  News Corp. (NWSA) ’s Fox Sports. The
team plans to sell the rights while under court protection.  The bankruptcy case is In re Los Angeles Dodgers LLC, 11-
12010,  U.S. Bankruptcy Court , District of Delaware (Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
