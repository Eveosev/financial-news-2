Afribank Plc, a Nigerian lender
bailed out two years ago by the  central bank , fell for a tenth
day after BusinessDay said that plans by the private-equity firm
Vine Capital Partners Ltd. to acquire the bank have probably
collapsed.  The stock dropped 5 kobo, or the maximum daily limit of 5
percent, its biggest daily decline since Jun. 9, to 95 kobo by
the 2:30 p.m. close in Lagos.  Fidelity Bank Plc is now likely to acquire Afribank, the
Lagos-based newspaper said, without disclosing how it got the
information.  The  Central Bank of Nigeria  fired the chief executives of
eight lenders in 2009 and bailed out the industry with 620
billion naira ($4 billion) after a debt crisis threatened the
sector with a collapse. The central bank gave the rescued
lenders until Sept. 30 to recapitalize or face liquidation or
nationalization.  To contact the reporter on this story:
