South Africa’s parliamentary
portfolio committee summoned the nation’s antitrust authorities
to explain why  Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT)  was allowed to purchase a
controlling stake in  Massmart Holdings Ltd. (MSM) , Business Day said.  The committee, in an unprecedented move, wanted to briefed
on the case a day before the Competition Tribunal issued its
reasons for allowing Wal-Mart’s 16.5 billion-rand purchase of a
51 percent stake in Massmart, the Johannesburg-based newspaper
said. Mmathulare Coleman, the chairwoman of the committee,
didn’t take calls to her mobile phone by Business Day and didn’t
respond to written questions from the newspaper, it said.  The committee published an advertisement in Johannesburg’s
Sunday Times seeking comment on the acquisition, Business Day
said. There has been no interaction between Massmart, Wal-Mart
and the committee, Business Day said, citing Massmart spokesman
Brian Leroni.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
