News Corp. (NWSA)  shares, having fallen for
four days amid a probe into alleged phone hacking by the
company’s U.K. journalists, received a vote of confidence from
Lawrence Haverty, a portfolio manager at Gamco Investors Inc.  Haverty, in an interview with Erik Schatzker on Bloomberg
Television’s “Inside Track,” said News Corp. has “stable,
loyal, talented management,” and a balance sheet that is a
“fortress.” The company has proven capable in the past at
overcoming problems, he said.  “It is time to buy the stock,” said Haverty, whose firm
owns 6 million shares of News Corp. The current crisis, “will
in fact blow away.”  News Corp. has lost $7 billion in market value over four
days amid investor concern that the probe into the alleged phone
hacking by journalists at the London-based News of the World
tabloid could have a broader impact on the company.  New York-based News Corp., controlled by  Rupert Murdoch ,
lost $1.27, or 7.6 percent, to $15.48 in Nasdaq Stock Market
trading yesterday, the biggest drop since April 2009.  To contact the reporters on this story:
