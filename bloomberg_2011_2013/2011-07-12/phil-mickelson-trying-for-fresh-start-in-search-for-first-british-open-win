Four-time major winner  Phil Mickelson  said he’s taking a new approach into this year’s
British Open after just one top-10 finish in 17 appearances.  The American has struggled with the high winds and
irregular bounces of British links golf. His best finish at the
Open was third in 2004 and he was 59th the last time it was
played at Royal St. George’s, site of this year’s championship,
in 2003.  “I’m trying to pretend like it’s my first time here,”
Mickelson said at a news conference two days before play begins
in Sandwich,  England . “I’m just trying to learn it all from the
start, from scratch.”  Mickelson practiced today in wind gusts that reached 35
miles (56 kilometers) per hour. He said he played terribly,
failing to reach the par-3, 243-yard 11th hole with his driver,
and considered the day educational.  “I think any round and any experience that you can have on
this course is going to be a good thing and you’ll learn
something,” he said. “It very well may be at some point in the
four days we’ll get this wind. So it may be very helpful.”  Mickelson was the last American to win a major title, the
2010  Masters Tournament . The five straight victories by non-U.S.
players in the four Grand Slam tournaments is the longest such
run in history, and the world’s  sixth-ranked golfer  doesn’t see
that as bad.  “We’ve got players from all over the world winning the
biggest events,” Mickelson said. “That only helps promote and
grow the game on an international level, so I think it’s been a
good thing.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
