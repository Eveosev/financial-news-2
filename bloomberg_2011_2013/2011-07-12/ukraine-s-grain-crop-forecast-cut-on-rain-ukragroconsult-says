Ukraine’s grain-harvest will be 2
percent smaller than previously forecast at 44.117 million
metric tons because excessive rains damaged wheat and barley
crops, UkrAgroConsult said.  The wheat estimate was lowered to 19.8 million tons from
20.4 million tons, the Kiev-based researcher said in e-mailed
statement today. The barley forecast was lowered to 8.05
million tons from 8.55 million tons.  The corn forecast was raised 2.5 percent to 13.9 million
tons from 13.55 million tons, according to the company. Black
Sea corn produced by Ukraine,  Russia , Kazakhstan, Romania and
 Bulgaria  may climb to 30 million tons from 25 million tons, it
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
