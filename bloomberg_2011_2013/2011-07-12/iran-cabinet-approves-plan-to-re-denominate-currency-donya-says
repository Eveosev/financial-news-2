Iran ’s cabinet approved a plan to
re-denominate the rial by slashing four zeros from the national
currency,  Donya-e-Eqtesad  reported, citing Central Bank Governor
Mahmoud Bahmani.  The plan needs to be approved by parliament and the
Guardian Council, the country’s top legal authority, and will
take about three years to implement, the newspaper said.  Officials said the initiative to re-denominate the rial,
originally requested by the government in 2007, was delayed to
first ensure  price stability .  One dollar exchanges for 10,715 rials. Iran’s inflation
accelerated to 14.2 percent in the 12 months through the Iranian
month of Ordibehesht, which ended May 21st, from 13.2 percent
the previous month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
