OAO TMK,  Russia ’s largest producer
of steel pipes for the oil and gas industry, posted a 17 percent
increase in shipments in the second quarter as demand from
energy producers increased.  TMK shipped 1.09 million metric tons of pipes in the three
months, it said in a statement today. That compares with 931,000
tons a year earlier, according to a 2010 filing.  Shipments of large-diameter pipes declined quarter-on-
quarter as OAO Gazprom and OAO Transneft cut purchases after
completing projects, TMK said without giving figures. Shipments
rose 34 percent in the first half from a year earlier to 377,000
tons, it said.  U.S. unit TMK IPSCO’s first-half shipments climbed 16
percent to 479,000 tons, the statement shows.  Second-quarter adjusted earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization are expected to be little changed
from the first quarter, TMK said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
