Tao Tsuot Ltd. (TAO)  soared the most in
almost two years after Ilan Ben Dov, the holding company’s
controlling shareholder, offered to give Tao 50.01 percent of
Suny Electronic Inc. as part of a proposed debt settlement.  Tao Tsuot shares increased 33 percent, the most since
August 2009, to 0.17 shekel at 2:46 p.m. in  Tel Aviv , giving the
Petach Tikva, Israel-based company a market value of 50.4
million shekels ($14.6 million). Suny shares dropped for the
first time in four days, declining 0.6 percent to 35.79 shekels.  Tao Tsuot would own about 57 percent of Suny following the
transfer, Tao said in a  statement  to the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange
today.  Ben Dov, Suny’s chairman, owns about 70 percent of the
importer and marketer of Samsung mobile phones in  Israel ,
according to Bloomberg data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
