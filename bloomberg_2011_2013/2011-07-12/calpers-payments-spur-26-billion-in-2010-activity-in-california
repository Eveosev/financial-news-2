Benefit payments in 2010 by the
 California  Public Employees’ Retirement System, the largest U.S.
public pension, spurred more than $26 billion in economic
activity in the state, the fund said in a report.  The payments led to an increase in the gross state product
of more than $8.6 billion and supported more than 93,600
California jobs in 2010, according to the report released today.  “Calpers retirement checks are a powerful engine helping
to drive California’s economy,”  Anne Stausboll , Calpers’s chief
executive officer, said in an e-mailed statement.  Officials in California cities, including San Francisco and
San Jose, have been negotiating with municipal unions for
concessions on pension benefits that they say are putting a
strain on their budgets.  Calpers paid almost $12 billion in benefits to more than
500,000 retirees and other beneficiaries in 2010, according to
the report. About 86 percent live in California, the report
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
