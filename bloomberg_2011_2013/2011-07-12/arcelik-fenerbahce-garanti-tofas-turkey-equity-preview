Turkey ’s benchmark  ISE National 100
Index (XU100)  rose for the first day in four, gaining 571.27, or 0.9
percent, to 63,261.06 at the 5:30 p.m. close in Istanbul.  The following stocks were active. Symbols are in
parentheses.  Koza Altin Isletmeleri AS (KOZAL)  , a gold miner, added
85 kurus, or 3.8 percent, to 23.05 liras, its biggest gain since
April. Gold climbed to a record in  London  and New York today as
concern about  Europe ’s debt crisis spurred demand for the metal
as a protection of wealth.  Mango Gida Sanayi & Ticaret AS (MANGO TI), a producer of
fruits and vegetables, surged 33 kurus, or 18 percent, to 2.14
liras, a record jump. Mango signed a contract to sell its
products to  Russia ’s food retailer  Magnit OJSC (MGNT)  that will be
valid until Dec. 15, 2015, it said in a statement to the
 Istanbul Stock Exchange  today.  Otokar Otomotiv & Savunma Sanayi AS (OTKAR TI), a producer
of minibuses and military trucks, rose 60 kurus, or 1.6 percent,
to 38.3 liras after getting an export order worth $54.1 million
for four-wheel-drive armored vehicles, spare parts and training,
according to a company statement to the exchange today.  Turk Telekomunikasyon AS (TTKOM)  , the landline phone
company, dropped 20 kurus, or 2.4 percent, to 8.22 liras. The
company may miss second-quarter profit estimates on a weaker
lira and its shares are “overpriced,” Is Investment said in a
research report today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
