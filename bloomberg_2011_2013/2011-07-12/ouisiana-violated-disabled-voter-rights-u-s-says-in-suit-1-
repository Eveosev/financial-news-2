The state of  Louisiana  and some of
its agencies and officials violated the National Voter
Registration Act through their treatment of disabled residents
and people on public assistance, the U.S. said in a lawsuit.  The U.S. Justice Department said in the suit filed today in
federal court in  Baton Rouge , Louisiana that the state broke the
law by failing to provide voter registration services at offices
administering to residents on public assistance or state-funded
programs serving people with disabilities. The law requires
states to “identify and designate” these offices as voter
registration agencies, the U.S. said.  “The voting process begins with registration,” Thomas E. Perez, assistant attorney general in the civil rights division,
said in an e-mailed statement. “Therefore, it is essential that
all citizens have unfettered access to voter registration.”  The  Justice Department  is seeking a court order requiring
the state and its agencies to comply with the voter registration
law. The U.S. names as defendants the state, Louisiana Secretary
of State J. Thomas Schedler, the Louisiana Department of Health
and Hospitals and others.  Sharon Kleinpeter, spokeswoman for the Louisiana attorney
general’s office, said she couldn’t immediately comment.  The lawsuit is U.S. v. State of Louisiana, 3:11-cv-00470,
U.S. District Court, Middle District of Louisiana (Baton Rouge)  To contact the reporter on this story:
