Copper rose for the first time in
three sessions on signs that demand is rebounding in  China , the
world’s biggest consumer.  Chinese imports rose for the first time in three months in
June as buying from overseas became profitable and supply
tightened after consumers drained local stockpiles. There are
“strong signs” that the country will “come back and buy in a
more aggressive way,” according to Codelco, the top producer.
Prices slid 3.7 percent in the first six months of the year as
demand waned.  “Copper has a strong fundamental story,” said Rich Ilczyszyn, a market strategist at Lind-Waldock, a broker in
 Chicago .  Copper futures for September delivery rose 2.35 cents, or
0.5 percent, to close at $4.3915 a pound at 1:10 p.m. on the
Comex in  New York . The price lost 1.7 percent in the previous
two days.  The metal has gained 46 percent in the past year, reaching
a record $4.6575 on Feb. 15.  On the  London  Metal Exchange, copper for delivery in three
months added $80, or 0.8 percent, to $9,650 a metric ton ($4.38
a pound).  Aluminum, lead, nickel, tin and zinc also rose in London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
