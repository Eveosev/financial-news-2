Iriver Ltd. (060570)  surged the most in six
months in Seoul trading hours before the company said it will
offer the world’s first reader customized for  Google Inc. (GOOG) ’s
electronic-book service. The shares erased those gains today.  The stock jumped 15 percent to 3,450 won yesterday, when
the number of shares traded rose to 1.85 million, or six times
the three-month daily average. The South Korean MP3 maker then
tumbled 15 percent, the most since trading began in December
2003, to 2,935 won at the 3 p.m. close in Seoul trading.  Iriver released a statement seven hours after yesterday’s
market close in Seoul saying the company’s Story HD will be the
first e-reader fully integrated with Google’s eBooks service and
that  Target Corp. (TGT)  will be its exclusive retailer in the U.S.  The company doesn’t “officially have much to say about the
reason” for the surge, J.K. Jeong, a spokeswoman for Seoul-
based iriver, said in a text message. “There have been a number
of media reports lately about how we are trying to diversify our
products beyond MP3 players to smartphones and tablets, and we
think the stock has been responding to those expectations.”  Morgan O’Murray, a spokeswoman for Minneapolis-based
Target, didn’t immediately reply to a voice-mail message on her
office telephone. Jennie Johnson, a Google spokeswoman in Tokyo,
declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
