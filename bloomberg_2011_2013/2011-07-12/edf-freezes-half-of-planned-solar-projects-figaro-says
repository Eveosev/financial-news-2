Electricit√© de France SA has stopped
work on about half of the new solar-energy generating projects
it had planned,  Le Figaro  reported.  An unidentified EDF spokesman described the projects as no
longer economical because the government was suspending
preferential tariffs for solar-generated electricity, the
newspaper said.  EDF has frozen construction of about 800 megawatts out of a
planned 1,600 megawatts in solar generating capacity because the
work could not be completed within 18 months, Le Figaro said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
