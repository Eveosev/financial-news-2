Gold futures rose to a record
settlement as  Europe ’s escalating debt crisis boosted demand for
the metal as a haven investment.  On the Comex in  New York , gold futures for August delivery
gained $13.10, or 0.8 percent, to settle at $1,562.30 an ounce
at 1:39 p.m. on the Comex in New York. The previous record was
$1,557.10 on May 2, when the intraday price reached an all-time
high of $1,577.40.  The euro fell to a four-month low against the dollar after
a meeting of European Union finance ministers failed to defuse
the region’s fiscal woes, hunting for ways to reduce Greece’s
debt burden. Bond yields surged in Italy and Spain, and European
equities posted the biggest three-session slump since March.
Gold priced in euros and pounds rose to records.  “With the currency volatility and the debt-contagion risk
in Europe, investors are gravitating toward something tangible
like gold,” said  Adam Klopfenstein , a senior strategist at
Lind-Waldock, a broker in  Chicago .  Gold rose as high as $1,573.90 in electronic trading after
the settlement. Federal Reserve policy makers disagreed on
whether additional monetary stimulus will be needed, even if the
outlook for economic growth remains weak, minutes of their
meeting last month showed.  Gold futures, up for the sixth straight session, have
gained almost 10 percent this year. The price has rallied every
year since 2001. The metal will trade above $1,600 in the third
quarter and outperform silver, palladium and platinum,  Edel Tully , a London-based analyst at UBS AG, said in a report dated
yesterday.  ‘Flight to Safety’  “It’s a continued flight to safety into gold,” said  Frank McGhee , the head dealer of Integrated Brokerage Services LLC in
Chicago. “People are worried the debt crisis will spread to
Spain, Italy, and ultimately, the U.S.”  Congress is in talks aimed at raising the $14.3 trillion
U.S. debt ceiling before Aug. 2, the date when the government is
projected to exhaust its borrowing authority.  Silver futures for September delivery dropped 6.4 cents, or
0.2 percent, to $35.634 an ounce on the Comex. Platinum futures
for October delivery rose $8, or 0.5 percent, to $1,736.30 an
ounce on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . Palladium futures for
September delivery were unchanged at $767.45 an ounce.  To contact the reporters on this story:
