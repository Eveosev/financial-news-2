Japanese stocks fell for a second
day, driving down the Topix index by the most in five weeks,
amid concern Europe’s debt crisis will spread, weakening
earnings prospects for banks and exporters.  Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. (8306) , Japan’s largest lender
by market value, sank 2.9 percent.  Sony Corp. (6758) , which sells about
20 percent of its PlayStation game consoles and other products
in Europe, retreated 3 percent.  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) , the world’s
largest carmaker, lost 1.9 percent.  The Nikkei 225 Stock Average fell 1.4 percent to 9,925.92
at the 3 p.m. close in  Tokyo . The broader Topix index declined
1.5 percent to 857.19, its biggest drop since June 2, as bond
yields in Italy and Spain spiked toward levels that forced
Greece Ireland and Portugal to request external help.  “It’s looking more and more like the debt crisis in Europe
will spread,” said Yumi Nishimura, an equity-market analyst at
Daiwa Securities Capital Markets Co. “People are worried about
the negative impact on financial systems.”  Italy  and Spain are being dragged into the crisis on
concern soaring bond yields triggered by a failure to resolve
rescues of Greece, Ireland and Portugal may make it impossible
for them to finance their borrowings. The yield on Italy’s 10-
year bond surged to its highest in more than a decade, pushing
the premium investors demand to hold the debt over German bunds
to a Euro-era record.  Banks Retreat  Europe may have to double its bailout fund to 1.5 trillion
euros ($2.1 trillion) to cover a crisis in Italy, the  European
Central Bank  said, according to German newspaper Die Welt,
citing  “high-ranking” people at central banks. German Finance
Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  denied the report.  Japanese banks dropped. Mitsubishi UFJ sank 2.9 percent to
397 yen.  Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc. (8316) , the country’s
second-largest publicly traded lender, fell 2.1 percent to 2,466
yen.  Mizuho Financial Group Inc. (8411) , the No. 3, retreated 1.5
percent to 131 yen.  Exporters also fell after the yen rose to a four-month high
against the euro. Sony lost 3 percent to 2,136 yen. Toyota
dropped 1.9 percent to 3,355 yen. Honda Motor Co., Japan’s
second-largest carmaker, retreated 2.5 percent to 3,170 yen.  The yen appreciated to 111.68 against the euro, a level not
seen since March 17, increasing from 114.71 at the close of
 stock trading  in Tokyo yesterday. Against the dollar, Japan’s
currency strengthened to 80.06 from 80.76. A stronger yen hurts
exporters because it cuts the value of overseas sales.  BOJ Assessment  Stocks also fell after the Bank of  Japan  cut the country’s
growth forecast for the year ending March 2012 to 0.4 percent
from an April estimate of 0.6 percent. Although production and
consumer spending have picked up recently, growth for the year
will be slower because of the “sharp downturn” immediately
after Japan’s March 11 earthquake and tsunami, the bank  said .  BOJ Governor Masaaki Shirakawa and his policy board left
the benchmark lending rate between zero and 0.1 percent at a
meeting in Tokyo today.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slid 0.7 percent
today. The index retreated 1.8 percent yesterday amid concern
U.S. lawmakers will fail to reach an agreement on raising the
debt ceiling before the government exhausts its borrowing
authority on Aug. 2. Stocks in the U.S. also dropped after
bellwether Alcoa Inc. reported earnings that missed analyst
estimates.  Oil, Metals Drop  Alcoa, the largest U.S. aluminum producer, kicked off the
second-quarter earnings season, reporting after stocks markets
closed that profit excluding certain items was 32 cents a share,
missing the 33-cent average estimate of analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg. Alcoa dropped 0.6 percent in after-hours trading.  Japanese traders of metals and energy declined after the
report and as crude price slid.  Mitsubishi Corp. (8058) , Japan’s
largest commodities trader, fell 1.9 percent to 2,032 yen.  Inpex
Corp. (1605) , the country’s No. 1 energy explorer, slumped 4.6 percent
to 584,000 yen, the most on the Nikkei.  Japan Petroleum
Exploration Co. (1662) , the nation’s second-biggest oil driller,
retreated 2.5 percent to 3,885 yen.  Crude oil for August delivery fell 1.1 percent to $95.15 a
barrel in  New York  yesterday, the lowest level since July 1. The
London Metal Exchange Index of prices for six metals including
copper and aluminum dropped 1.6 percent, the biggest drop since
June 2.  To contact the reporters on this story:
