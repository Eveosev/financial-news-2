Daily exports of North Sea Aasgard
crude in October will increase by 8 percent from September, a
loading program obtained by  Bloomberg News  showed.  The schedule comprises eight cargoes of 855,000 barrels
each, totaling 220,645 barrels a day, the plan showed. This
compares with six lots of 855,000 barrels each and one of 1
million barrels amounting to 204,333 barrels a day in September.  Loadings of Grane will rise to five shipments of 600,000
barrels, one more than September, according to a separate plan.  Exports of Gullfaks will be unchanged at five cargoes of
800,000 barrels each, a third program showed.  Statoil ASA (STL) ,  Norway â€™s largest oil company, operates the
three fields. Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude
shipments compiled by field operators to allow buyers and
sellers to plan their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
