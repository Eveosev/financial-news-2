Hurricane Leslie was downgraded to a
tropical storm when its top winds dropped to 70 miles (113
kilometers) an hour as it sat stalled in the Atlantic southeast
of Bermuda, the National Hurricane Center said.  The system is expected to regain hurricane strength over
the weekend, the center said. Little change in speed or movement
is forecast today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
