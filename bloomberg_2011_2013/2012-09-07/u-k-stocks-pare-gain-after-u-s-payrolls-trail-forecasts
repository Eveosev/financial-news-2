U.K. stocks  advanced, extending a
two-week high for the FTSE 100 Index, as  industrial production 
surged by the most in 25 years.  Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY) , Royal bank of Scotland Group and
 Barclays Plc (BARC)  climbed more than 2 percent. Xstrata Plc jumped 3.6
percent as  Glencore (GLEN)  International Plc boosted its takeover offer
for the mining company by 9 percent. Glencore’s shares declined
3.6 percent.  British American Tobacco Plc (BATS)  and Imperial Tobacco
Group Plc dropped at least 2 percent.  The FTSE 100 gained 17.46 points, or 0.3 percent, to
5,794.8 at the close in London, bringing this week’s increase to
1.5 percent. The benchmark gauge has climbed  10 percent  from its
2012 low on June 1 as European Central Bank policy makers agreed
to an unlimited bond-purchase program in an effort to protect
the euro. The broader FTSE All-Share Index advanced 0.4 percent
today, while Ireland’s ISEQ Index jumped 0.8 percent.  “Previous market bounces on euro-zone euphoria have been
short-lived,” said Chris Beauchamp, a market analyst in IG
Index in  London . “I suspect that this one has more life to
it.”  U.K.  industrial production  soared in July as manufacturing
rebounded from disruption caused by the extra public holiday for
the Queen’s Jubilee. Production rose 2.9 percent, the most since
1987, after falling 2.4 percent in June, the Office for National
Statistics said today. The median forecast of 28 economists in a
Bloomberg survey was for a gain of 1.5 percent.  The volume of shares changing hands in FTSE 100 companies
was more than double the 30-day average today, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  ECB Plan  The FTSE 100 surged the most in a month yesterday after ECB
President  Mario Draghi  said policy makers agreed to an unlimited
bond-purchase program to help regain control of  interest rates 
in the euro area.  U.K. shares pared their advance today as a U.S. Labor
Department report showed payrolls rose at a slower pace last
month. Employers hired 96,000 workers in August, down from a
revised 141,000 in July. That missed the median forecast of
130,000 in a Bloomberg survey of economists. The  unemployment
rate  unexpectedly dropped to 8.1 percent.  “The jobless number left us in a limbo,” said Jakup Petur Baerentsen, a chief equity adviser at Nordea Private Bank in
Copenhagen. “It wasn’t strong enough to show the economy
improved, while not making the case for more stimulus from
 Federal Reserve  more or less likely.”  Banks paced gains on the FTSE 100 today. Lloyds, the U.K.’s
second-biggest government-aided bank, added 2.3 percent to 37.02
pence. Barclays increased 6.9 percent to 206.4 pence and RBS
advanced 4.7 percent to 244.5 pence.  Xstrata, Glencore  Xstrata (XTA)  soared 3.6 percent to 1,014 pence after Glencore,
the world’s biggest commodities trader, increased its proposed
takeover bid to 3.05 shares for each Xstrata share.  Xstrata investors including Qatar Holding LLC had sought a
higher bid from Glencore and had planned to vote against the
previous 2.8-share offer. Glencore retreated 3.6 percent to
378.05 pence.  A gauge of  miners  led advances after China approved new
infrastructure projects, supporting the demand outlook in the
world’s biggest copper consumer. The government-backed
construction plans including roads and warehouses, statements on
the National Development and Reform Commission’s website showed.
That followed approval this week of higher spending on
railroads.  Ferrexpo Surges  Ferrexpo Plc (FXPO) , the maker of iron ore pellets for steel

retreated 2 percent to 3,173.5 pence and  Imperial (IMT) , the second-
biggest, fell 3.5 percent to 2,262 pence.  The companies have declined more than 4 percent this week
as Russia said it will submit a law banning smoking in public
places to parliament by Nov. 1 and reports said France plans to
remove branding from cigarette packs.  GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK) , the U.K.’s largest drugmaker, dropped
2 percent to 1,409 pence, the biggest decline in two months.
