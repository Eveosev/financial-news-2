Canada has enough workers to fill
the demand from expanding oil-sands projects in the coming
years,  Cenovus Energy Inc. (CVE)  Chief Operating Officer John Brannan
said.  “Across the country there are enough people” to supply
the labor needs of the industry, Brannan said in an interview
today at the Spruce Meadows Roundtable in Calgary. The industry
in Alberta has managed to keep pace with labor demands, he said.  Canadian employment rose faster than economists forecast in
August, with a 34,300 increase following July’s 30,400 decline,
Statistics Canada said today. The  unemployment rate  was
unchanged at 7.3 percent.  Increased investment in the nation’s oil sands is expected
to result in 905,000 jobs in 2035 from 75,000 in 2010, according
to the  Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers .  Cenovus, based in Calgary, employs more than 4,000 workers,
according to its website. With new oil-sands production, the
company is planning to reach almost 500,000 barrels a day by
2021, three times more than current output, according to a Sept.
6  investor presentation .  To contact the reporter on this story:
