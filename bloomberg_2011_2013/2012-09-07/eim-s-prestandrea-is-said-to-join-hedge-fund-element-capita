Adam Prestandrea has stepped down as
co-head of investments at Arpad Busson’s EIM SA to join hedge
fund Element Capital Management LLC, according to two people
familiar with the matter.  Prestandrea, who was based in EIM’s  New York  office, also
served as director of research, said the people, who asked not
to be identified because the firm is private. Element Capital is
a New York-based fixed income firm led by Jeffrey Talpins.  Prestandrea joined EIM in 2004 and was named co-head of
investments last year, according to the website of the New York
Society of Security Analysts. Assets at EIM have fallen by about
two-thirds to less than $5 billion since 2008. Busson, 49, said
in a July 30 interview he’s held talks about combining Nyon,
Switzerland-based EIM with a rival, though he hasn’t hired
lawyers or bankers to work on a merger.  Prestandrea declined to comment when reached by telephone
at Element Capital. His departure from EIM was reported
yesterday by HFMweek.  “He decided to switch to the other side of the business
and we support him in that decision,” Davidson Goldin, a
spokesman for EIM, said in an e-mailed statement.  EIM’s website lists Marc Albertelli as co-head of
investments. The firm in June appointed Robert Phillips from
Geneva-based Union Bancaire Privee as global head of research
for equity long-short  hedge funds .  Busson started EIM, which charges fees to pick hedge funds
for clients such as pension funds and insurance companies, in
1992.  To contact the reporter on this story:
