OTP Bank Nyrt. (OTP) , Hungary’s largest
lender, led the country’s stocks to the longest streak of gains
in eight months on speculation the European Central Bank’s plan
to buy euro area bonds will ease the region’s debt crisis.  The shares jumped 1.9 percent to 3,850 forint by 11:12 a.m.
in Budapest. The benchmark BUX  index  rallied 1.4 percent to
18,200.17 in a sixth day of advances, the longest such series
since January.  Emerging-market stocks rose the most in a month yesterday
after ECB President  Mario Draghi  said policy makers agreed to an
unlimited and sterilized bond-purchase program, easing concern
the region’s debt crisis will curb exports from developing
nations. The forint and Hungarian bonds slumped yesterday after
Prime Minister  Viktor Orban  said he rejected conditions demanded
by the  International Monetary Fund  and the European Union for a
credit line.  The ECB bond plan is lifting OTP’s stock, Zoltan Varga, an
analyst at broker Quaestor Zrt., wrote by e-mail. “Should the
global mood of optimism fade, the focus could quickly return to
the domestic concerns.”  European stocks rose today, extending yesterday’s biggest
rally in a month, as investors awaited a U.S. report on payrolls
and unemployment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
