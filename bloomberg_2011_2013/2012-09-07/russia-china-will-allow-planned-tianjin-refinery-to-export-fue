Russia  and China have agreed to
allow OAO Rosneft and China National Petroleum Corp. to export
oil products from their planned Tianjin refinery north of
Beijing, the head of Russia’s largest oil producer said today.  The ability to export oil products will improve the
profitability of the refinery, Rosneft President  Igor Sechin 
told reporters at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit
in Vladivostok, Russia.  CNPC and Rosneft announced plans to build a 13 million
metric-ton refinery in Tianjin in 2010, according to the Russian
producer’s  website . The state-owned Chinese company owns 51
percent of the joint venture.  To contact the reporter on this story:
