Crude-oil shipments aboard
supertankers bound for  China  fell 2.1 percent this week,
according to ship-tracking data compiled by Bloomberg.  Tankers with a total carrying capacity of 13.9 million
deadweight tons are heading for the Asian nation, compared with
14.2 million last week. About 11 percent of the fleet of the
largest  oil tankers  signaling future destinations is bound for
China, the world’s biggest energy consumer. The ships would haul
about 101.9 million barrels of oil, assuming a conversion factor
of 7.33 barrels a ton.  The following table shows the destinations and combined
carrying capacity in deadweight tons of 426 VLCCs, out of a
global fleet of 570, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Average drafts are expressed as a percentage of maximum sailing
depth and are an indication of cargo size. Each country’s
percentage share of total oil shipments is shown for the current
and previous weeks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
