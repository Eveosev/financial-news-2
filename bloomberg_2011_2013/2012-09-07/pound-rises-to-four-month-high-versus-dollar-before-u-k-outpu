U.K. 30-year bonds declined in the
week as a report showing industrial production surged in July
added to signs Britain’s recession is easing.  Borrowing costs touched the highest in more than two months
after European Central Bank President Mario Draghi’s plans to
stem the sovereign debt crisis eroded demand for haven assets.
The pound touched a four-month high above $1.60 versus the
dollar as today’s factory data followed a purchasing managers’
index this week that showed  services  expanded more than
economists estimated. Ten-year gilts reversed an intraday
decline after a report showed the  U.S. economy  added fewer jobs
than analysts estimated last month.  “It has been a week of stronger U.K. data, which is having
some downward impact on gilts,” said Adam McCormack, head of
gilt sales at Barclays Plc in  London .  “This move is more of a
reaction to the developments in peripheral  Europe .”  Thirty-year gilt yields climbed eight basis points, or 0.08
percentage point, this week to 3.03 percent at 4:48 p.m. London
time, and slipped less than two basis points today. They reached
3.14 percent earlier, the highest since July 5. The price of the
4.5 percent bond maturing in December 2042 fell 1.98, or 19.80
pounds per 1,000-pound ($1,602) face amount, in the week, to
129.045.  Spanish 10-year bond yields fell below 6 percent for the
first time in four months today.  Euro Advances  U.K.  industrial production  rose by the most in 25 years in
July after manufacturing rebounded from disruption caused by the
extra public holiday in June for the Queen’s Jubilee. Output
climbed 2.9 percent, after falling 2.4 percent in June, the
 Office for National Statistics  said today in London. The median
forecast of 28 economists in a Bloomberg News survey was for a
gain of 1.5 percent.  The difference in yield, or  spread , between 30-year gilts
and two-year notes widened to 291 basis points, the most since
April 4, signaling investors were adding to bets for faster
inflation.  Gross domestic product rose 0.2 percent in the three months
through August, compared with 0.3 percent in the quarter through
July, the National Institute of Economic and Social Research,
whose clients include the  Bank of England  and the U.K. Treasury,
said in an e-mailed statement today.  Gilts have returned 3.3 percent this year through
yesterday, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the
European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies,
outperforming German bunds, which gained 2.7 percent, and U.S.
Treasuries, which earned 2.1 percent.  Sterling Strength  Sterling climbed 0.5 percent to $1.6015 after reaching
$1.6034, the strongest level since May 15. The pound slipped 0.8
percent to 79.89 pence per euro, after touching 79.94 pence, the
weakest level since July 5.  The 17-nation currency rose versus the dollar to the
highest since May 22, boosted after European Central Bank
President  Mario Draghi  said yesterday that asset purchases
“will enable us to address severe distortions in government
bond markets.”  The U.S. economy added 96,000 workers last month following
a revised 141,000 increase in July that was smaller than
initially estimated, Labor Department figures showed today in
 Washington . The median estimate of 92 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg called for a gain of 130,000.  The U.K. currency has gained 1.1 percent in the past month,
according to Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes, which track
10 developed-market currencies. The dollar fell 1.7 percent and
the euro rose 1.8 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
