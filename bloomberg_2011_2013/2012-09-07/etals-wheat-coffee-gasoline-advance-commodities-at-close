The Standard & Poor’s GSCI  gauge  of
24 commodities advanced for the second day, rising 0.7 percent
to 676.64 at 4:53 p.m. in New York, led by gains in metals,
wheat, coffee and gasoline futures. The UBS Bloomberg CMCI  index 
of 26 materials increased 1.1 percent to 1621.318.  PRECIOUS METALS  Gold rose to a six-month high as government data showed
that the U.S. added fewer jobs than forecast last month,
spurring speculation that the  Federal Reserve  will expand
stimulus measures to boost the labor market.  The  U.S. economy  added 96,000 workers last month following
a revised 141,000 increase in July that was smaller than
estimated by the government. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg
called for an August gain of 130,000. Fed Chairman  Ben S.
Bernanke  last week said the central bank may need to do more to
counter high unemployment.  Gold futures for December delivery climbed 2 percent to

April 13. Palladium futures for December delivery rose 1.1
percent to $654.75 an ounce.  Precious metal markets: NI PCMKTS  BASE METALS  Copper rose to a 16-week high in  New York  after  China 
approved new infrastructure projects and the disappointing U.S.
jobs report fueled bets that policy makers will move to boost
growth.  The Chinese government backed construction plans including
roads and warehouses, statements on the National Development and
Reform Commission’s website showed yesterday, signaling stronger
metals demand.  Copper futures for December delivery climbed 3.7 percent to
settle at $3.645 a pound at 1:22 p.m. on the Comex in New York
after reaching $3.6525, the highest level since May 14. The

months rose 3.5 percent to $7,970 a metric ton ($3.62 a pound).  Aluminum, tin, zinc, nickel and tin were also higher in
London.  Base metals markets: NI BMMKTS  SOFT COMMODITIES  Raw-sugar rebounded from a two-year low on signs that lower
prices are spurring demand. Coffee and cotton gained, while
cocoa slid.  Egypt  bought 50,000 metric tons of raw sugar in a tender

2010. The price rose 7.1 percent this week.  Cocoa futures for December delivery fell 0.6 percent to
$2,676 a metric ton.  Soft  commodities markets : NI SOMKTS  GRAINS, OILSEEDS  Wheat rose on speculation that demand for grain from the
U.S., the world’s biggest exporter, will increase as Russia and
 Ukraine  run low on supplies. Corn also gained, while soybeans
slid.  Egypt yesterday bought 475,000 metric tons of wheat from
Russia, Ukraine and  Romania . Russia’s grain harvest will fall to
69 million tons this year, down from a forecast of as much as 72
million tons a month earlier, according to the Institute for

1.1 percent this week.  Grain markets: NI GRMKTS  OIL PRODUCTS  Gasoline rose as refiners worked to increase production
after disruptions caused by Hurricane Isaac reduced U.S.
stockpiles to the lowest level since 2008.  Prices gained after Gulf Coast refineries operated last
week at the lowest level since January. Almost one-quarter of
U.K. refining capacity is expected to shut in October for
planned work, reducing shipments to the East Coast. Tropical
Storm Leslie is moving north up the coast and may reach
Newfoundland by the middle of next week, the National Hurricane
Center said in an advisory at 2 p.m. East Coast time.  October-delivery reformulated gasoline, or RBOB, advanced

a gallon on the exchange. Prices declined 0.7 percent this week
and have climbed 17 percent this quarter.  Products Markets: NI OPFMKT  NATURAL GAS  Natural-gas futures declined for a third day in New York as
demand for the fuel to power air conditioners faded with cooler
weather.  Gas fell 3.4 percent as Commodity Weather Group LLC in
Bethesda,  Maryland , predicted normal temperatures in most of the
U.S. through Sept. 21. While unusually hot summer weather helped
reduce a stockpile surplus, supplies have been rising to
seasonal highs each week, Energy Department data show.  Natural gas for October delivery dropped 9.4 cents to
$2.682 per million British thermal units on the New York
Mercantile Exchange, the lowest settlement price since Aug. 29.
Gas fell 4.2 percent this week, capping the sixth loss in seven
weeks. The futures are down 10 percent this year.  Natural Gas markets: NI NUSMKT  CRUDE OIL  Oil advanced for a third day after the Labor Department

August.  Crude for October delivery rose 89 cents, or 0.9 percent,

highest settlement in a week. Futures dropped 5 cents this week

percent from the year’s low of $77.69 a barrel on June 28.  Brent oil for October settlement increased 76 cents, or 0.8
percent, to end the session at $114.25 a barrel on the London-
based ICE Futures Europe exchange.  The lower-than-forecast employment growth will move the Fed
closer to more quantitative easing, Pacific Investment
Management Co.’s  Bill Gross  said. The Fed implemented two rounds
of large-scale asset purchases totaling $2.3 trillion from
December 2008 to June 2011.  Oil markets: NI CRMKTS  LIVESTOCK  Hog futures fell, extending a slump to a 21-month low, as
climbing U.S. pork supplies outpace demand. Cattle advanced.  Meatpackers have processed 1.738 million hogs this week, up
1.5 percent from a year earlier, and the price of hogs for
immediate delivery to slaughter plants has dropped for 19
straight sessions, the longest slide since at least April 2003,
U.S. Department of Agriculture data show.  Hog futures for October settlement declined 0.6 percent to
settle at 71.35 cents a pound at 1 p.m. on the Chicago

this week, extending this year’s decline to 15 percent.  Cattle futures for October delivery rose 0.3 percent to
settle at $1.26475 a pound. The price has climbed 4.1 percent
this year.  Beef-export sales totaled 18,236 metric tons (40.2 million
pounds) in the week ended Aug. 30, up 12 percent from the four-
week average, government data showed today. The figures were
“pretty good” and are supporting prices, Schultz said.  Feeder-cattle futures for October settlement fell 0.1
percent to $1.46125 a pound.  Livestock markets: NI LVMKTS  To contact the reporter on this story:
