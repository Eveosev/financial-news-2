Syncrude’s premium to West Texas
Intermediate crude surged to the widest in almost 11 months
after Suncor Energy Inc. began maintenance on a vacuum tower at
its Fort McMurray upgrader in  Alberta .  The work on the unit, which processes heavy bitumen from
Alberta’s oil sands into a light, sweet oil, is scheduled to
last six weeks, Sneh Seetal, a Calgary-based spokeswoman, said
by e-mail yesterday. Repairs at Nexen Inc.’s Long Lake upgrader,
which shut in mid-August and is expected to resume output in the
second half of this month, may also reduce supplies.  Syncrude increased $1 to $13 a barrel over WTI at 12:10
p.m. in  New York , according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
That’s the largest margin since Oct. 19.  Western Canada Select’s discount was unchanged at $9.25 a
barrel below the U.S. benchmark. Bakken’s premium was unchanged
at $6 a barrel.  On the U.S. Gulf Coast grades strengthened. Light Louisiana
Sweet’s premium to WTI added 40 cents to $17.10 a barrel. Heavy
Louisiana Sweet increased 55 cents to $17.35.  Poseidon’s  premium  grew 20 cents to $13.20. Mars Blend’s
premium increased 25 cents to $13.05 a barrel over WTI. Southern
Green Canyon’s widened by 25 cents to $11.75.  Thunder Horse , a sour crude with lower sulfur content than
Mars, Poseidon and Southern Green Canyon, was unchanged at $16
above WTI.  To contact the reporter on this story:
