Pennsylvania ’s requirement that
voters present photo identification before casting a ballot
won’t deprive citizens of any rights, state lawyers told the
Pennsylvania Supreme Court in a filing.  The statute only tightens voter identification requirements
to “increase public confidence that only legally registered
voters are voting,” wrote Alfred Putnam Jr., an attorney for
Governor Thomas W. Corbett.  The voters who sued to block the law in state court
mischaracterized the issue by calling it “an assault on the
fundamental constitutional right to vote,” Putnam said.  The voting rights of as many as 1 million people could be
compromised by the photo-ID law, according to the lawsuit.  Arguments before the Supreme Court are scheduled for Sept.
13 in Philadelphia.  In an earlier brief, David Gersch, an attorney for the
 American Civil Liberties Union  and 10 voters, said that the
state’s high court “has previously held that depriving even one
person of the right to vote is an ‘extremely serious matter.’”  Gersch is asking to have the statute thrown out before the
Nov. 6 election.  A lower-court judge denied the ACLU’s request to
temporarily bar the law and the state  Supreme Court  agreed to
expedite the case.  The case is Applewhite v. Pennsylvania, 71 MAP 2012,
Supreme Court of Pennsylvania.  To contact the reporter on this story:
