Banco Espirito Santo SA (BES)  and  Banco
BPI SA (BPI)  led Portuguese banks higher for a second day, boosted by
the European Central Bank’s bond-purchasing plan.  ECB President  Mario Draghi  said yesterday that bond
purchases may be considered for euro-area countries currently
under bailout programs, such as Portugal, Greece and Ireland,
when they regain bond-market access.  Banco Espirito Santo, the country’s biggest publicly traded
lender, rose 8 percent to 66.2 euro cents, the highest since
April 11, while Banco BPI gained 12 percent to 75.4 cents, the
highest price in more than a year.  “Any stimulus by the ECB is reason enough to bolster
shares, especially in Portugal’s banking sector, which has been
under pressure because of the debt crisis,” said Diana Gomes, a
trader at Orey iTrade in Lisbon.  Banco Comercial Portugues SA (BCP) , the country’s second-biggest
bank, advanced 6 percent to 8.8 cents. The company said
yesterday that the subscription period for the sale of 500
million euros ($633 million) in new shares will begin on Sept.
