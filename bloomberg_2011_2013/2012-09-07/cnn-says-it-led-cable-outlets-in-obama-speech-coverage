CNN led cable-news outlets in
viewers during the final night of the Democratic National
Convention, when President  Barack Obama  accepted the party’s
nomination for a second term, after falling behind MSNBC the two
previous nights.  Time Warner Inc.’s CNN averaged 5.56 million viewers from
10 p.m. to 11:15 p.m. New York time, the network said today in
an e-mailed statement, citing Nielsen ratings.  Comcast Corp. (CMCSA) ’s
NBC broadcast network led all outlets with 8.93 million viewers.  After trailing MSNBC, also owned by Comcast, on the first
two nights of the convention, CNN assembled a million more
viewers than MSNBC during Obama’s speech. CNN, which had
dominated ratings during the Democrats’ convention four years
ago, is reconsidering its approach to news coverage after
network President Jim Walton said in July he would resign at
year-end.  MSNBC, with commentators including  Rachel Maddow , averaged
4.56 million viewers during the time period, according to the
ratings data.  Walt Disney Co. (DIS) ’s ABC drew 4 million,  CBS Corp. (CBS) ’s
TV network coverage was watched by 3.29 million and News Corp.’s
Fox News was viewed by 2.91 million.  Overall, the last night’s convention coverage drew 35.7
million viewers across 13 television networks, Nielsen said
today on its  website . That compares with 38.4 million who tuned
into 10 networks for the final night of the party’s convention
four years ago. The Republican convention last week attracted a
total of 30.3 million viewers on its final night.  Time Warner, based in New York, gained 1 percent to $43.64
at the New York close. The  stock  has climbed 21 percent this
year. Comcast fell 0.6 percent to $34.46 and is up 45 percent
this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
