John Paulson , the billionaire hedge-
fund manager coming off record losses in 2011, reported
increases in most of his funds in August as rising stock markets
lifted the value of holdings, according to two people briefed on
the returns.  Paulsonâ€™s Gold Fund led gains with an 11 percent jump in
August, which reduced losses this year to 15 percent, said the
people, asking not to be named because the information is
private. The Advantage funds, which seek to profit from
corporate events such as takeovers and bankruptcies, and Paulson
Enhanced, which aims to make money from companies involved in
mergers, also rose last month.  Armel Leslie , a spokesman for New York-based Paulson & Co.,
which manages $19.5 billion, declined to comment on the returns.  To contact the reporter on this story:
