SK Hynix Inc. (000660) , the world’s second-
largest maker of computer memory chips, led Asian chipmakers
higher on speculation prices of so-called NAND flash memory
chips may recover.  SK Hynix  rallied  7.7 percent to 22,500 won at the close on
the Korea Exchange, its steepest gain since Oct. 21.  Samsung
Electronics Co. (005930)  added 4.5 percent in Seoul trading, while
Japan’s  Toshiba Corp. (6502)  rose 7.3 percent in Tokyo.  The gains tracked a rally in U.S. peers after  OCZ
Technology Group Inc. (OCZ) , a maker of disk drives, said it
experienced “a significant shortage” of certain NAND flash
memory components, which are used to store data in phones,
tablets and other devices.  Micron Technology Inc. (MU) , which
forecast last month the NAND market will improve in the first
half of 2013, climbed 7.8 percent yesterday and  SanDisk Corp. (SNDK) 
surged 8.4 percent.  “Chip stocks are jumping, driven by the nice rally we saw
yesterday for U.S. peers,” Jeff Kang, a Seoul-based analyst at
Daishin Securities Co., said by phone today. “Growing shipments
for pending new products such as Apple Inc.’s iPhone 5 and
potential benefits from the ongoing legal battle between Apple
and Samsung are driving Hynix shares even higher.”  Apple is cutting reliance on Samsung parts for its new
iPhone, the Korea Economic Daily reported, citing unidentified
industry officials. A U.S. jury last month found Samsung
infringed Apple’s patents and ordered the South Korean company
to pay more than $1 billion.  To contact the reporters on this story:
