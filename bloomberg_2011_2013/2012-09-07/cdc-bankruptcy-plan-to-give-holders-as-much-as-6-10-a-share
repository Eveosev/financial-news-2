CDC Corp. (CDCAQ) , a China-based enterprise
software developer also known as Chinadotcom, won a judge’s
approval of a bankruptcy reorganization plan where shareholders
will get as much as $6.10 a share.  The shares yesterday rose as much as 21 percent to $6 as of
3:52 p.m. New York time after opening at $4.95. Shares closed at
$5.44, up 49 cents.  The cash for equity holders resulted from CDC’s sale of its
87 percent interest in CDC Software Corp. for $249.8 million to
Archipelago Holding, an affiliate of Vista Equity Holdings.
After paying a $65 million secured judgment claim and other
costs, CDC was left with a net of $172.8 million when the sale
was completed in April.  Unsecured creditors with $2.9 million in claims were paid
in full and thus didn’t vote on the plan.  Shareholders should expect to receive at least $5.01 a
share, according to the disclosure statement explaining the
plan. The stock price has ranged in the last three years from
$9.57 in April 2010 to 78 cents in December 2011.  CDC’s petition listed assets at $377.4 million and debt of
$250.2 million. For the first half of 2011, revenue of $158.9
million resulted in a $17.8 million operating loss and a $23.9
million net loss.  The case is In re CDC Corp., 11-79079, U.S.  Bankruptcy
Court , Northern District of  Georgia  (Atlanta).  To contact the reporter on this story:
