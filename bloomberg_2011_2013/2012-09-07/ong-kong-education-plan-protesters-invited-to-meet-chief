Hong Kong  Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying invited three groups to “have a frank exchange of
views” on a proposed Chinese national-education curriculum that
they oppose.  Leung invited Scholarism, the Parents Concern Group on
National Education and the Hong Kong Professional Teachers’
Union to meet with him and Anna Wu, chairwoman of  Committee on
the Implementation of Moral and National Education , according to
a notice posted on the government’s information-services website
today.  Protesters began camping out at the government headquarters
on Aug. 30, demanding that Leung abandon plans for the national-
education classes that they said portray an overly favorable
view of Communist Party rule in  China .  To contact the reporter on this story:
