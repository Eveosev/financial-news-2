U.K.  economic growth  slowed in the
three months through August and “significant downside risks”
to the outlook remain, the National Institute of Economic and
Social Research said.  Gross domestic product  rose 0.2 percent in the period,
compared with 0.3 percent in the quarter through July, Niesr,
whose clients include the  Bank of England  and the U.K. Treasury,
said in an e-mailed statement in London today.  Data today showed industrial production surged the most in
25 years in July as it rebounded from the disruption of an extra
public holiday the previous month. While gauges of services and
manufacturing improved in August, the Bank of England has said
the outlook is “unusually uncertain” amid the debt turmoil
emanating from the euro area.  “While we expect the economy to continue to expand, it
will take more robust rates of growth than we have recently seen
to close the U.K.’s large negative output gap,” Niesr said.
“Significant downside risks to the outlook persist, not least
the future evolution of the euro-area crisis.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
