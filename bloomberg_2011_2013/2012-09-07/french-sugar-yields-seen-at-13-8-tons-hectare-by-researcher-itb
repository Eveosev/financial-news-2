French sugar yields from beets are
expected to be about 13.8 metric tons a hectare (2.47 acres),
industry researcher Institut Technique de Betterave said,
unchanged from a July outlook.  Sampling of sugar beets found similar yields as in 2007,
2008 and 2010, the Paris-based institute wrote in a report on
its website yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
