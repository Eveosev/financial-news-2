Nigerian forces killed seven
suspected members of the Islamist Boko Haram movement in a
gunfight yesterday in the northeastern Borno state, while the
same group killed five people in neighboring Yobe, police and
military officials said.  The shootout in Maiduguri, Borno’s state capital, began
when militants opened fire on security forces, Sagir Musa, a
spokesman for the Joint Task Force in the state, said in an e-
mailed statement today.  In Damaturu, the capital of Yobe, the killings by Boko
Haram militants followed attacks on mobile phone transmission
towers, Patrick Egbuniwe, police chief in the state, said by
phone today. Officials said yesterday that the group had
attacked similar targets in Maiduguri and the northern city of
Kano, run by  MTN Group Ltd. (MTN) ’s Nigerian unit,  Airtel Nigeria ,
Visafone Communications Ltd and  Starcomms Plc. (STARCOMM)   Boko Haram, which means “Western education is a sin,”
said in February it would attack mobile-phone service providers
because they have helped authorities track the group’s members,
adopting a tactic that’s been used by the Taliban in
 Afghanistan .  Boko Haram says it’s campaigning to establish an Islamic
state in  Africa ’s top oil producer. Over the past two years the
group has carried out attacks in the mainly Muslim north and
Abuja, the capital, targeting government buildings, churches,
police, soldiers and Muslims who oppose its aims.  To contact the reporter on this story:
