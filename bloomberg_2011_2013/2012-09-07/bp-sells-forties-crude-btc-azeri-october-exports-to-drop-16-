BP Plc sold a North Sea Forties
crude cargo at a higher price than the previous trade. OAO
Lukoil sold Russian Urals blend in the Mediterranean at the
lowest level in more than two months.  Daily exports of Azeri Light crude from a port in  Turkey 
will decrease by 16 percent in October from this month,
according to a loading program obtained by  Bloomberg News .  North Sea  BP sold Forties lot F0910 for Sept. 27 to Sept. 29 loading
to Royal Dutch Shell Plc at 20 cents a barrel more than Dated
Brent, according to a Bloomberg survey of traders and brokers
monitoring the Platts trading window. This compares with a cargo
BP sold on Sept. 5 at a discount of 75 cents.  Total SA didnâ€™t manage to buy any Brent, Forties or Ekofisk
for Sept. 25 to Oct. 6 at parity to Dated Brent, unchanged from
its bid yesterday, the survey showed.  Reported crude trading typically occurs during the Platts
window, which ends at 4:30 p.m. London time. Before the session,
Forties loading in 10 to 25 days was 36 cents a barrel less than
Dated Brent, compared with a discount of 42 cents yesterday,
data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Brent for October settlement traded at $113.82 a barrel on
the ICE Futures  Europe  exchange in London at the close of the
window, down from $114.77 yesterday. The November contract was
$113.39, a discount of 43 cents to October.  Exports of Statfjord will increase to five cargoes in
October, one more than September, while Aasgard loadings will be
eight lots versus seven this month, according to shipping plans
obtained by Bloomberg News. All shipments for October are
855,000 barrels each.  Shipments of Grane will rise to five consignments of
600,000 barrels each from four in September, while exports of
Gullfaks will be unchanged at five cargoes of 800,000 barrels
each, plans showed.  Statoil ASA said its Troll A oil and natural gas processing
plant in the  North Sea  will halt power consumption because of
maintenance from Sept. 10 to Sept. 22, according to a filing
with the Nord Pool Spot AS exchange.  Mediterranean/Urals  Lukoil sold 80,000 metric tons of Urals for loading on
Sept. 18 to Sept. 22 to Petraco Oil Co. at $1.10 a barrel less
than Dated Brent on a delivered basis to Augusta,  Italy , the
lowest level since June 19, according to the survey. This
compares with a discount of 70 cents for a trade on Aug. 23.  Vitol Group failed to sell 80,000 tons of the crude for
Sept. 17 to Sept. 21 at 85 cents a barrel less than Dated Brent,
the survey showed.  No bids or offers were made for Urals in northwest Europe.
The blend dropped 4 cents to a discount of $1.44 a barrel to
Dated Brent for delivery in the region, data compiled by
Bloomberg showed.  Shipments of Azeri Light from the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan
pipeline will total 17.8 million barrels, or 574,000 barrels a
day, compared with 680,000 barrels a day in September, the
schedule showed.  TNK-BP issued its annual tender to sell Urals for loading
in 2013 from the Baltic ports of Primorsk and Ust-Luga and the
Black Sea port of Novorossiysk, three traders who participate on
the market said.  The tender is for zero to three 100,000 ton cargoes per
month from the Baltic ports, and as many as three 80,000 ton
shipments as well as one or two 140,000 ton lots from the Black
Sea port, according to the people, who declined to be identified
because the information is confidential. The tender closes on
Sept. 20. The volumes will be decided by the seller.  West Africa  Indian Oil Corp. bought via a tender 1 million barrels each
of Nigerian Qua Iboe and Bonga crudes for loading in November
from Glencore International Plc, according to two traders with
knowledge of the matter.  Qua Iboe fell 2 cents to $1.64 a barrel more than Dated
Brent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
