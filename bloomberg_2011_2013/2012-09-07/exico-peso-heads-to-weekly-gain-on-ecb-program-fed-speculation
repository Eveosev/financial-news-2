Mexico’s peso posted its biggest
weekly gain since June on speculation the  European Central
Bank ’s bond-buying proposal will blunt the euro region’s debt
crisis and the  Federal Reserve  will add to monetary stimulus.  The peso rose 0.6 percent to 12.9808 per U.S. dollar at 4
p.m. in Mexico City, pushing the weekly advance to 1.6 percent,
the biggest such jump since the five-day period ended June 29.  U.S. Labor Department figures today showed the economy
added 96,000 workers last month, below the median estimate in a
Bloomberg survey and adding to bets on central bank stimulus.
The peso gained yesterday after the European Central Bank
announced plans for unlimited bond purchases to stem the crisis.  “While the report in the U.S. came out bad, below
expectations, it reinforces a bit the idea that the Fed has to
act,”  Rafael Camarena , an economist at  Banco Santander SA (SAN) , said
by phone from Mexico City. “That’s helped the peso.”  Mexico’s central bank left its key  interest rate  unchanged
at a record low 4.5 percent amid forecasts that a jump in
inflation will ease by year end. The inflation rate climbed to
4.57 percent in August, a 29-month high, after a drought and
bird-flu outbreak pushed up prices of corn, eggs and bread.  Yields on Mexico’s benchmark bonds due in 2024 rose one
basis point to 5.59 percent today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
