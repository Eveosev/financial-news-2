Asian  stocks  rose, with the regional
benchmark index posting its biggest gain since December as
 Europe ’s plan to reduce borrowing costs, better-than-estimated
U.S. jobs data and Chinese stimulus measures boosted the
earnings outlook for Asian exporters.  Hutchison Whampoa Ltd., which operates retailers, phone
companies and ports in Europe, rose 3.7 percent in Hong Kong.
China Resources Cement Holdings Ltd. jumped 14 percent in Hong
Kong after the mainland government approved road projects.
 Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) , a carmaker that depends on  North America  for
25 percent of its sales, added 3.4 percent.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index rose 2.2 percent to 118.51 as
of 7:07 p.m. in Tokyo, its biggest gain since Dec. 1. About six
stocks advanced for each that fell on the gauge, which has risen
0.6 percent this week. More than 80 companies on the regional
gauge had their biggest daily advances in at least six months
today.  The bond plan “takes another European crisis episode off
the table for at least the rest of this year,” said  Andrew Pease , chief investment strategist at Russell Investment Group
in Sydney, which manages about $150 billion. “It does minimize
the tail risk in Europe. There’s no doubt about it.”  The Asia Pacific measure fell 1.1 percent this quarter
through yesterday as signs of a global economic slowdown
outweighed expectations for further stimulus measures. The Asian
benchmark traded at 12.1 times estimated earnings, compared with
13.8 times for the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPXL1)  and 11.9 times
for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.  Nikkei, Kospi  The Shanghai Composite Index climbed 3.7 percent. Hong
Kong’s Hang Seng Index added 3.1 percent.  Taiwan’s Taiex Index (TWSE) 
rose 1.3 percent and Singapore’s Straits Times Index gained 0.9
percent.  Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average rose 2.2 percent. South
Korea’s  Kospi Index (KOSPI)  advanced 2.6 percent. Australia’s S&P/ASX
200 added 0.3 percent and New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index gained 0.8
percent.  Asian indexes followed gains in global stocks after
European Central Bank President Mario Draghi yesterday said
policy makers agreed to an unlimited bond-purchase program as
they try to regain control of  interest rates  in the euro area.
The program will target sovereign bonds with maturities of one
to three years in its most ambitious plan yet to save the euro.  Futures on the  S&P 500  gained 0.4 percent today. The  index 
increased 2 percent to its highest level in four years in New
York yesterday. Claims for U.S. jobless benefits fell, and a
private report showed U.S. companies added more workers than
forecast.  ’Risk Premium’  “The risk premium on Asia could be lifted for a little
while,” saidDiane Lin, a fund manager with Sydney-based
Pengana Capital Ltd., which oversees about $1.1 billion in
global assets. “From that regard, it’s positive. But whether
the ECB’s action itself is going to be sustainable and
fundamentally improve the outlook, we still need to see.”  Exporters rallied. Hutchison Whampoa rose 3.7 percent to
HK$69.40.  Esprit Holdings Ltd. (330) , a clothier that depends on
Europe for 79 percent of its sales, rose 2.1 percent to
HK$12.58.  Financial firms accounted for 27 percent of the gain in the
Asia Pacific index.  HSBC Holdings Plc (5) , Europe’s biggest lender,
rose 2.5 percent to HK$68.90 in Hong Kong.  Mitsubishi UFJ
Financial Group Inc. (8306) , Japan’s biggest lender, advanced 2.5
percent to 363 yen.  Volatility for Asian equities declined. The  Nikkei Stock
Average Volatility Index (VNKY)  dropped 8.2 percent to 19.18,
indicating traders expect a swing of about 5.5 percent on the
benchmark gauge over the next 30 days. Measures of anticipated
price movements for the Hang Seng Index and Kospi Index also
fell.  More Roads  Cement companies advanced after China approved plans to
build 2,018 kilometers (1,254 miles) of roads. China Resources
Cement soared 14 percent to HK$3.90. Anhui Conch Cement Co., the
country’s biggest supplier of the building material, rose 8.5
percent to HK$21.40.  Stocks linked to the U.S. advanced. Toyota rose 3.4 percent
to 3,205 yen.  James Hardie Industries SE (JHX) , a building-materials
supplier that gets 67 percent of sales from the U.S., added 2.3
percent to A$8.65. Man Wah Holdings Ltd., a sofa maker that
depends on the world’s biggest economy for 51 percent of sales,
rose 5 percent to HK$3.17.  Investors continue to gauge U.S. growth conditions after
Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said last week that he
wouldn’t rule out more stimulus to boost employment if needed.
U.S. Labor Department data today may show hiring slowed while
the  unemployment rate  remained at 8.3 percent in August,
according to forecasts by economists in a Bloomberg survey.  Chipmakers advanced, with SK Hynix Inc. climbing 7.7
percent to 22,500 won in Seoul. Shares rose after California-
based OCZ Technology Group Inc. blamed a shortage of certain
flash-memory components for lower-than-estimated sales of its
disk drives.  Toshiba Corp. (6502)  advanced 7.3 percent to 251 yen in
Tokyo after its chipmaking partner SanDisk Corp. gained 8.4
percent in the U.S.  To contact the reporter on this story:
