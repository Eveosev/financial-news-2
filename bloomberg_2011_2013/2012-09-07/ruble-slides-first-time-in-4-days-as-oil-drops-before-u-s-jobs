The ruble snapped three days of
gains against the dollar as crude oil, the country’s main export
earner, retreated before a report forecast to show jobs growth
slowed last month in the U.S.  The ruble dropped 0.3 percent to 32.0215 at 10:38 a.m. in
Moscow, paring its weekly gain to 1 percent.  Russia ’s currency
lost 0.5 percent versus the euro to 40.4971 and retreated 0.4
percent against the central bank’s target euro-dollar basket.
Non-deliverable forwards showed the ruble at 32.4748 per dollar
in three months.  Oil fell as much as 1 percent to $94.55 a barrel in  New
York . U.S. employment probably rose by 130,000 in August after
gaining 163,000 in July, according to a Bloomberg News survey
before a Labor Department report today. Oil and gas contribute
about 50 percent of Russia’s government revenue.  The extra yield investors demand to own Russia’s dollar
bonds over U.S. Treasuries fell two basis points to 204,
according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s EMBI Global Index. An index
of five-year government bond yields compiled by the Micex rose
three basis points to 7.555 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
