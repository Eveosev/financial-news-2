Royal Bank of Canada , the country’s
largest lender by assets, agreed to buy the Shoppers Optimum
credit-card portfolio from  Bank of America Corp.  to extend its
 MasterCard Inc. (MA)  offerings.  Royal Bank will buy the MasterCard accounts as part of a
co-branding pact with  Shoppers Drug Mart Corp. (SC) ,  Canada ’s biggest
pharmacy chain, the Toronto-based lender said today in a
statement. The portfolio’s size and price weren’t disclosed.  Royal Bank agreed three years ago to collaborate with
 WestJet Airlines Ltd. (WJA)  to introduce the bank’s first MasterCard
credit-card offering in Canada. The latest card, named RBC
Shoppers Optimum MasterCard, has no annual fees and allows users
to earn reward points on purchases. Royal Bank and Shoppers
struck a deal in January to offer a debit card.  “This has been part of the broader relationship that RBC
and Shoppers put together and announced a while ago on the debit
card side,” Linda Mantia, Royal Bank’s head of credit cards and
payment solutions, said in an interview. “A  credit card  was
something we also wanted to do with them.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
