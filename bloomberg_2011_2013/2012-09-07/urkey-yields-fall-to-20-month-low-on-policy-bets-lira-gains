Turkey ’s bond  yields  sank to the
lowest in almost 20 months on bets the central bank will extend
its loosening policy after the  European Central Bank ’s bond-
buying program bolstered risk appetite. The lira gained.  Yields on two-year benchmark debt retreated eight basis
points, or 0.08 percentage point, to 7.45 percent at 12:35 p.m.
in Istanbul, declining for a fourth day to the weakest level
since Jan. 20, 2011. The lira appreciated less than 0.1 percent
to 1.8081 per dollar, strengthening for a third day.  Turkey’s central bank has provided funding for lenders at
the cheapest rate in its daily one-week repurchase agreements
auctions since June 4. This sent the  overnight cost of borrowing 
in the  interbank market  to 5.01 percent today, two basis points
off its lowest in a year. ECB President  Mario Draghi  announced
yesterday unlimited and sterilized bond-purchases at the short-
end to stem the region debt crisis. Turkey sends 34.3 percent of
its exports to the European Union.  “Together with the ECB decision, risk appetite
strengthened and the lira advanced and this created the
expectation that the central bank can continue with the loose
monetary policy,” Erkin Isik, a fixed-income strategist at  Turk
Ekonomi Bankasi AS (TEBNK) , said in e-mailed comments.  The Turkish central bank lent 6.5 billion liras ($1.09
billion) in one-week repo at its lowest 5.75 percent policy rate
today. It provided 2 billion liras in one-month repo.  To contact the reporter on this story:
