Erste Group Bank AG (RBAG)  advanced to the
strongest in more than four months, leading Czech shares higher
for a second day, on optimism the European Central Bank’s bond-
buying program will contain the euro area’s debt crisis.  The Austrian lender jumped 5.9%, the most since June 29, to
433.5 koruna in Prague, its highest closing price since April
25. Share turnover today was more than four times the daily
average in the past three months. The  PX (PX)  equity index, in which
Erste has a 21 percent weighting, climbed 1.7 percent.  Banks and basic-resources companies led European shares up
after ECB President  Mario Draghi  said yesterday policy makers
agreed to a plan designed to cap most-indebted nation’s funding
costs and prevent the financial crisis from spreading. Better-
than expected U.S. jobs data and speculation that China will
step up economic stimulus also drove demand for riskier assets.  “The ECB move has significantly reduced the risk of the
euro area’s debt crisis getting much worse, raising investors’
appetite for riskier assets,” Jiri Simara, an analyst at Cyrrus
AS brokerage in Brno, Czech Republic, wrote in a report today.  Erste has been the best performer in the 14-member PX gauge
today and the most-traded stock, followed by  New World Resources
Plc (NWR)  in terms of turnover. The biggest Czech producer of coking
coal added 2.3 percent to 90 koruna as commodities rallied.  To contact the reporter on this story:
