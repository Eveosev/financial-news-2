Usain Bolt won the 100 meters at
tonight’s Diamond League track meet in Brussels, while Jamaican
teammate Yohan Blake won the 200-meter race.  Aries Merritt of the U.S. set a world record of 12.80
seconds in the men’s 110-meters hurdles, besting the previous
mark of 12.87 seconds set by Cuba’s Dayron Robles in 2008.  Bolt started slowly before taking the lead midway through
the 100 and won in a time of 9.87 seconds. The two-time Olympic
champion and world record-holder celebrated by throwing his
shoes into the crowd.  Bolt led a Jamaican sweep, with Nesta Carter second in 9.96
seconds and Kemar Bailey Cole third in a personal best of 9.97
seconds.  Blake finished second to Bolt in both the 100 and 200 at
the  London  Olympics last month, but skipped the shorter race
tonight. The 22-year-old led tonight’s 200 from the outset and
eased to victory in 19.54 seconds. Jamaica’s Jason Young was
second in 19.92, with  France ’s Christophe Lemaitre third in
20.17.  American Jayson Richardson finished second to Merritt’s
world-record performance in the hurdles, with Jamaica’s Hansle
Parchment third, mirroring the trio’s finish at the Olympics.  To contact the reporter on this story:
