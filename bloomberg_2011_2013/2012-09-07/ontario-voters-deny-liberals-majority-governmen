Ontario’s Liberal government under
Premier Dalton McGuinty missed an opportunity to obtain a
majority of seats in the provincial legislature after they
failed to sweep two by-elections.  While the Liberals easily retained the Toronto-area
district of Vaughan, they failed to pick up the district of
Kitchener-Waterloo, finishing in third place. The seat was won
by the  New Democratic Party , who took it from the Progressive
Conservatives, according to results posted on the Elections
Ontario  website .  The result means that McGuinty’s Liberals will continue to
need support from some opposition members in order to pass laws.
Finance Minister Dwight Duncan presented a plan in March to
eliminate a C$15.2 billion ($15.5 billion) deficit by the year
beginning April 2017, and the province had its debt rating cut
to Aa2 by Moody’s Investors Service in April.  Liberal Steven Del Duca kept the Vaughan district with 51
percent of the vote, with Conservative Tony Genco taking 33
percent.  In the Kitchener district, southwest of Toronto, Catherine
Fife of the NDP took about 40 percent of the vote, compared with
31 percent for the Conservatives and 24 percent for the
Liberals.  With the results, the Liberals still have 53 seats in the
107-seat legislature, one short of a majority. The Conservatives
now have 36 seats and the NDP have 18.  To contact the reporter on this story:
