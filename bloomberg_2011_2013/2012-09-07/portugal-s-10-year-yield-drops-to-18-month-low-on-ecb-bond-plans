Portugal ’s bonds rose for a sixth-
straight week, sending 10-year yields to the lowest in almost 18
months, after European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi 
announced a plan to buy indebted-nations’ bonds.  Borrowing costs plunged below the market rates when
Portugal requested financial aid from the European Union on
April 6, 2011. Bond purchases may be considered for euro-area
countries currently under bailout programs, such as Greece,
Portugal and Ireland, when they regain bond-market access,
Draghi said at a press conference in  Frankfurt  yesterday.  “The lower yields now facing Ireland and Portugal make
market financing an ever more realistic” prospect in the coming
months, said  Ciaran O’Hagan , head of European rates strategy at
Societe Generale SA in Paris.  Ten-year government bond  yields  dropped 61 basis points, or
0.61 percentage point, to 8.10 percent at 5:58 p.m. London time,
after reaching 8.09 percent, the lowest since March 31, 2011,
and down from 9.31 percent a week ago. The 4.95 percent security
due in October 2023 climbed 3.58, or 35.80 euros per 1,000-euro
($1,278) face amount, to 77.475.  The extra yield investors demand to hold Portuguese 10-year
bonds instead of their German equivalents shrank to 647 basis
points, the narrowest since May 2011. Portugal’s five-year note
yields reached 5.94 percent, the least since January 2011.  Two-
year rates  fell to as low as 4.14 percent, the least since March
2011.  Officials from the  International Monetary Fund , the
European Commission and the ECB started a fifth quarterly review
of Portugal’s aid program on Aug. 28. It focuses on topics
including the planned return to bond markets in 2013, as well as
on the 2012 and 2013 budget plans.  Portugal plans to regain access to bond markets by
September 2013 and Prime Minister  Pedro Passos Coelho  has said
if the country can’t do that for “external reasons,” it would
be able to count on continued support from the EU and the IMF.  The nation is “sounding out” the market as it prepares to
resume sales of medium-term notes, Joao Moreira Rato, chairman
of the country’s debt agency, said in an interview in July.  To contact the reporter on this story:
