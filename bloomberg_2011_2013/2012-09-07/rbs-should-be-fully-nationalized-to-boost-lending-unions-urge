U.K. labor unions called for  Royal
Bank of Scotland Group Plc  to be fully nationalized so the
government can transform it into a state investment bank with
the aim of financing industry.  The Edinburgh-based lender, 82 percent state-owned, should
be taken wholly into public hands with a new mandate and the
ability to issue bonds, the  Trades Union Congress  said.  “The remit of the bank could then be changed from
maximizing short-term  shareholder value  (and consequently
shrinking its balance sheet) to supporting long-term growth,”
the TUC said in a statement as it prepares to begin its annual
conference tomorrow in Brighton,  England .  The TUC, which represents about 6.5 million workers, is
seeking to get its members on the remuneration committees of
banks to tackle “the culture of bonuses entitlement,” it said.
Compensation above 250,000 pounds ($400,000) a year should be
considered to come from company profit and be subject to
 corporation tax , it said.  The group also urged the government to lift funding
restrictions on the Green Investment Bank so it can promote
clean and renewable energy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
