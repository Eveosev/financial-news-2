Philippine builders  advanced on
expectations European steps to ease the region’s debt crisis
will boost remittances, spurring spending and home purchases in
the Southeast Asian nation.  Megaworld Corp. (MEG) , a builder of residential towers, rose as
much as 2.7 percent to 2.25 pesos and settled at 2.24 pesos at
the noon break in Manila.  Ayala Land Inc. (ALI) , the nation’s biggest
developer of homes, gained 1.8 percent and  SM Prime Holdings
Inc. (SMPH) , the largest shopping mall builder, climbed 2.5 percent,
bound for sharpest gain since July 31.  The Philippine Stock
Exchange Index (PCOMP)  climbed 1.2 percent.  The  European Central Bank  announced yesterday an unlimited
bond-buying plan to subdue borrowing costs of the region’s most
indebted nations and quell speculation about euro breakup.
Europe accounts for 16 percent of remittances from overseas
Filipinos and funds from the region fell 5.5 percent in the
first half from a year ago, Philippine central bank data show.  “Developments in Europe are improving sentiments and
outlook on remittances and spending,” said Richard Laneda,
analyst at COL Financial Group Inc. “Developers source a
sizeable chunk of sales from overseas Filipinos.”  Remittances make up 10 percent of the $225 billion economy
and help fund  consumer spending . The nation’s gross domestic
product expanded 5.9 percent in the second quarter, slower than
a revised 6.3 percent in the previous quarter, as  government
spending  eased and global demand weakened.  To contact the reporter on this story:
