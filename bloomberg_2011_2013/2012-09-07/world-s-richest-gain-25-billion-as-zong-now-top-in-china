The 40 richest people on the planet
added $25.3 billion to their collective net worth this week as
global equities soared.  One of the biggest gainers was  Amancio Ortega , who gained
$1.3 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.
Shares of  Inditex SA (ITX) , the world’s largest clothing retailer,
rose 0.81 percent during the week, pushing the 76-year-old
Spaniard’s fortune to $47.7 billion -- $1.3 billion ahead of
 Warren Buffett .  The increases came after European Central Bank President
Mario Draghi outlined an unlimited bond-purchase program to
reduce interest rates for struggling nations and fight
speculation of a breakup of the euro. In the U.S., payrolls rose
less than projected in August while the  unemployment rate  was
unexpectedly driven down by Americans leaving the labor force,
boosting the odds of additional Federal Reserve easing.  “Non-farm payroll was disappointing across the board.
There were fewer jobs created than anticipated along with a
decrease in the  labor force  participation rate,” said James Gaul, a portfolio manager at Boston Advisors LLC, which oversees
about $2.2 billion in assets. “You can boil this week down to
government central banking activity buoying asset prices.”  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rallied 2.23 percent during
the week to close at 1437.92 in New York, its best level since
January 2008. The index has climbed 12.5 percent since June 1.
The Stoxx Europe 600 Index gained 2.28 percent, closing at
272.30.  Zong Rises  Zong Qinghou, head of China’s third-largest beverage maker,
is the country’s richest man. The 66-year-old soda and juice
tycoon owns more than 80 percent of closely held  Hangzhou Wahaha
Group Co. , the company’s spokesman Shan Qining said in an
interview on Sept. 3. The newly disclosed stake, which is more
than double previous estimates, raised Zong’s fortune to $22.2
billion.  Carlos Slim , 72, remains the world’s richest person with a
net worth of $74.3 billion. Arturo Elias, a spokesman for Slim,
said Thursday that the Mexican billionaire plans to remain a
large investor in  Saks Inc. (SKS)  after reducing his stake in the
company because the shares were trading at a “good” price.  Bill Gates , 56, is $10.4 billion behind Slim. Shares of
 Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) , the world’s biggest software maker, inched up
0.42 percent after the company announced it planned to increase
the number of employees in China by 22 percent.  The Bloomberg Billionaires Index takes measure of the
world’s wealthiest people based on market and economic changes
and Bloomberg News reporting. Each net worth figure is updated
