Japan ’s Ministry of Economy, Trade
and Industry asked for 130.4 billion yen ($1.7 billion) to
develop clean energy for the fiscal year starting April 1.  Of that, the ministry wants to allocate 25 billion yen to
develop power grids to promote wind power, according to a budget
 request  announced by the ministry today.  METI plans to spend 17.5 billion yen to develop wind power
including a floating offshore wind project Japan is developing
in Fukushima after the 2011 earthquake.  The request also includes 23.1 billion to develop large-
size storage batteries. The budget for this fiscal year’s
renewable energy projects was 43.5 billion yen, according to the
ministry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
