Chinese President  Hu Jintao  told
Vietnamese counterpart Truong Tan Sang that both countries
should stay calm and act with restraint over territorial
disputes in  South China Sea .  “There have been some difficulties with China- Vietnam 
relations because of the dispute of the South Sea,” Hu told
Truong at a meeting in Vladivostok, Russia, according to a
 statement  from China’s Foreign Ministry. “This is what we don’t
want to see.”  China has become increasingly assertive in claiming
sovereignty over islands in the South China Sea, a region rich
in oil and gas. Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia, Taiwan and
Brunei also have territorial claims over parts of the area.  China and Vietnam “should avoid any unilateral actions
that would expand, complicate and internationalize the
dispute,” Hu was cited as saying in Vladivostok, where he and
Truong are attending the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation
summit. He said they should “adhere to bilateral negotiations
and friendly consultations.”  China ’s foreign ministry said Truong told Hu that Vietnam
is willing to work with China to solve the dispute as early as
possible through peaceful and friendly negotiations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
