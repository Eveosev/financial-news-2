Following is the text of  Canada ’s
labor force survey released by  Statistics Canada .  After a decline in July, employment rose by 34,000 in
August, the result of an increase in part-time work. The
unemployment rate held steady at 7.3%.  On a year-over-year basis, employment increased by 1.0% or
177,000, with most of the gains occurring in the spring of this
year. Virtually all of the increase in the 12-month period was
in full-time work. Over the same period, the total number of
hours worked rose 0.7%.  Employment rose in  Quebec , British Columbia, Saskatchewan
and Manitoba, while it declined in Ontario and Prince  Edward
Island . There was little change in the other provinces.  In August, there was added employment in transportation and
warehousing; professional, scientific and technical services;
business, building and other support services as well as in
natural resources. At the same time, there were fewer people
employed in construction as well as information, culture and
recreation.  Employment increased among employees and was little changed
among the self-employed in August. On a year-over-year basis,
public sector employment increased 1.9% and the number of
private sector employees rose 1.0%, while self-employment was
unchanged.  In August, there was an increase in employment among people
aged 55 and over, while it fell among youths aged 15 to 24.  This summer, the average employment rate from May to August
for students aged 15 to 24 was 47.9%, down from 49.1% last
summer.  Provincial summary  Employment increased by 33,000 in Quebec, with gains in
part-time work. This left overall employment in the province
slightly above the level of 12 months earlier. At 7.6% in August,
the  unemployment rate  was unchanged from the previous month.  In August, employment rose by 15,000 in British Columbia,
pushing the unemployment rate down 0.3 percentage points to 6.7%.
Compared with 12 months earlier, employment increased 2.3%,
above the national growth rate of 1.0%.  In Saskatchewan, employment increased by 4,600, bringing
gains over the past 12 months to 3.6%, the highest growth rate
of all provinces. The increase in employment in August pushed
the unemployment rate down 0.6 percentage points to 4.4%, tied
with  Alberta  for the lowest rate among all provinces.  Employment increased by 3,400 in Manitoba in August and the
unemployment rate fell by 0.3 percentage points to 5.4%.
Compared with 12 months earlier, employment was up 0.9%.  The number of employed fell by 25,000 in Ontario, leaving
employment similar to its level of August 2011. The unemployment
rate in the province was 8.0% in August 2012.  Employment up in services  In August, employment increased by 37,000 in transportation
and warehousing. Despite this increase, employment in the
industry was similar to its level of 12 months earlier.  There were 20,000 more people working in professional,
scientific and technical services in August, offsetting the
decline in the previous month. On a year-over-year basis,
employment was little changed in this industry.  Employment rose by 19,000 in business, building and other
support services in August, the second increase in the past
three months, bringing employment up 43,000 (+6.4%) over the
past 12 months.  Employment increased by 8,800 in natural resources in
August. Since August 2011, when employment in the industry was
at its most recent low, employment has grown by 17.7%.  Construction employment decreased by 44,000 in August,
bringing employment in this industry 2.4% below its level of a
year earlier.  Employment declined by 17,000 in information, culture and
recreation in August. With losses in four of the past five
months, employment in the industry was down 3.2% from its level
of August 2011.  More employed women and men aged 55 and over  Following a decline in July, employment among women aged 55
and over increased by 46,000 in August, bringing year-over-year
gains to 97,000 (+7.1%). The unemployment rate for this group
fell by 0.9 percentage points to 5.2% in August.  The number of employed men aged 55 and over rose by 16,000
in August, the first notable increase in four months. Their
unemployment rate was little changed at 5.9%. Compared with 12
months earlier, employment for this group has increased by
104,000 (+6.2%).  The robust year-over-year employment increase for both men
and women aged 55 and over was in part the result of population
aging.  Employment among those aged 25 to 54 was virtually
unchanged in August. Employment growth for this group totalled
47,000 or up 0.4% over the previous 12 months.  Employment among youths fell by 22,000 in August, and was
down by 72,000 (-2.9%) compared with 12 months earlier. The
youth unemployment rate rose by 0.5 percentage points to 14.8%
in August.  Summer labour market for students  From May to August, the Labour Force Survey collects labour
market information about young people aged 15 to 24 who were
attending school full time in March and intend to return to
school full time in the fall. The published estimates are not
seasonally adjusted; therefore, comparisons can only be made on
a year-over-year basis.  Compared with last summer, employment rates were down for
students of all age groups, and were among the lowest on record.
Overall, the average employment rate from May to August for
students aged 15 to 24 was 47.9%, down from last summer (49.1%),
and the summer of 2009 (48.6%), when student employment was hard
hit by the labour market downturn. In contrast, the rates in the
summers of 2006 to 2008 averaged 54.1%.  The average unemployment rate over the summer for students
aged 20 to 24 was 11.3%, while it was 18.1% for those aged 17 to
19 and 30.2% for students aged 15 to 16.  The average number of hours worked at all jobs during the
summer of 2012 by students aged 15 to 24 was 24.2 hours per week,
similar to the summer of 2011. Students worked slightly more
hours this summer compared with the summer of 2009, when the
average workweek was 23.4 hours.  Note to readers  The Labour Force Survey (LFS) estimates are based on a
sample and are therefore subject to sampling variability.
Estimates for smaller geographic areas or industries will have
more variability. For an explanation of sampling variability of
estimates and how to use standard errors to assess this
variability, consult the “Data quality” section of the
publication Labour Force Information (71-001-X, free).  The employment rate is the number of employed persons as a
percentage of the population 15 years of age and over. The rate
for a particular group (for example, youth aged 15 to 24) is the
number employed in that group as a percentage of the population
for that group.  The unemployment rate is the number unemployed as a
percentage of the labour force (employed and unemployed).  The participation rate is the number of employed and
unemployed as a percentage of the population. For more detailed
information, see the Guide to the Labour Force Survey (71-543-G,
free).  Unless otherwise stated, this release presents seasonally
adjusted data, which facilitates comparisons by removing the
effects of seasonal variations. For more information on seasonal
adjustment, see Seasonal adjustment and identifying economic
trends ( http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/11-010-x/2010003/part -
partie3-eng.htm) .  Educational services  The LFS seasonal adjustment process removes typical
seasonal patterns in the monthly data, according to trends
established in previous years. While there have been larger
movements in educational services employment in summer months in
recent years, there has not been a consistent pattern in the
magnitude or direction of these changes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
