Crude oil options fell as underlying
futures remained within a trading range from mid-August.  Implied volatility for options expiring in October, a
measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge of
options prices, was 27.3 percent as of 3:55 p.m. in  New York ,
falling from 29.17 percent yesterday. October options will
expire on Sept. 17.  “We’re still in this upper range, $99 down to $94, without
a whole lot of movement,” said Fred Rigolini, vice president of
Paramount Options Inc. in New York. “There’s no real
direction.”  Crude oil for October delivery rose 89 cents, or 0.9
percent, to settle at $96.42 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . Prices have swung between $93.93 and $98.29 since Aug.
16.  The most active options in electronic trading today were
October $90 puts, which fell 19 cents to 22 cents a barrel at
4:03 p.m. with 2,406 lots trading. October $100 calls were the
second-most active options, with 2,204 lots changing hands as
they rose 2 cents to 52 cents a barrel.  Bets that prices would fall accounted for 50.4 percent of
the 54,956 contracts in electronic trading. One contract covers
1,000 barrels of crude.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on open-
outcry volume, where the bulk of options activity occurs.  In the previous session, bearish bets accounted for 56
percent of the 159,255 contracts traded.  November $90 puts were the most actively traded options
yesterday with 5,284 lots changing hands. They fell 9 cents to
$1.79 a barrel. December $80 puts declined 2 cents to 98 cents
on volume of 5,179.  Open interest was highest for December $120 calls with
46,400 contracts. Next were December $80 puts with 44,336 lots
