French corn rated good or excellent
fell 4 percentage points in the week through Sept. 3 as
conditions deteriorated in Aquitaine, the biggest growing
region, following hot and dry August weather.  Corn getting the top ratings slid to 69 percent from 73
percent in the previous seven days, crop office FranceAgriMer
wrote in a  report  on its website today. At the same time last
year, 80 percent of the grain was rated good or excellent.  Southwest  France , including the Aquitaine region that grows
20 percent of the country’s corn, got 26 millimeters (1.02
inches) of rain in August, 58 percent less than usual, the
 Agriculture Ministry  reported yesterday. Temperatures of 22.8
degrees Celsius (73 degrees Fahrenheit) were 2.3 degrees above
normal. France is the European Union’s biggest corn producer.  Crop conditions in Aquitaine showed the biggest drop among
reported regions, with corn receiving the top two ratings
sliding to 66 percent from 75 percent a week earlier, according
to the report.  France’s soft wheat, durum wheat and barley crops have all
been harvested, according to FranceAgriMer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
