The biggest-ever imports of corn by
 China , the world’s largest livestock producer, may help sustain
a record rally in Chicago that’s been driven by drought across
the U.S. Midwest, according to Rabobank International.  Shipments may climb to 7 million metric tons in the year
starting Oct. 1 from about 5 million tons this year, Daron Hoffman, Shanghai-based director of research, said in an
interview. That compares with a  U.S. Department of Agriculture 
forecast for a 60 percent drop to 2 million tons in 2012-2013.  Record imports by China may spur higher prices, lifting
global food costs and forcing rival importers to cut purchases.
China’s demand needs to be met by imports no matter what the
price, according to Nathan Broders, director of feed ingredients
at INTL FCStone Inc. Corn has rallied 24 percent to a record
this year as the worst U.S. drought since 1936 slashed output.  Prices may be much higher in the second half of 2012 as
China increases purchases, Hoffman said yesterday, without
giving a forecast. His estimate for imports in 2012-2013 is
higher than the USDA’s outlook because he sees a smaller
increase in China’s output this year, he said in  Shanghai .  Corn for December delivery gained 0.2 percent to at $8 a
bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade at 5:15 p.m. in Shanghai,
after reaching a record $8.49 on Aug. 10. The most-active
contract on China’s Dalian Commodity Exchange ended at 2,362
 yuan  ($372) a ton after climbing 3.9 percent this year.  Corn Deficit  China, a net exporter before 2010, has shifted to a deficit
as rising incomes spur demand for protein-rich diets. Corn is
used to make  animal feed . Shipments in the first 10 months of
the 2011-2012 marketing year were 4.2 million tons, near the
record 4.3 tons in 1995-1996, customs data show.  The best-case scenario for China’s corn harvest this year
is a rise of 1 percent to 1.5 percent, Hoffman said, citing his
own analysis. Last month, the USDA forecast production in China,
the second-largest consumer, may gain 3.7 percent this year.  Global prices of corn and soybeans will need to stay at a
high level for years as a so-called structural requirement to
encourage farmers to boost planting and increase inventory
drained by China-led growing consumption, Hoffman said. Soybeans
rallied to a record in  Chicago  on Sept. 4.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
