Rajiv Goel is seeking probation
after testifying as a government witness in the insider-trading
trial of Galleon Group LLC co-founder Raj Rajaratnam.  Goel’s reputation was “ruined” by his involvement in the
Rajaratnam matter, his lawyer, David Zornow, said in a filing
today in Manhattan federal court.  To contact the reporter on this story:
