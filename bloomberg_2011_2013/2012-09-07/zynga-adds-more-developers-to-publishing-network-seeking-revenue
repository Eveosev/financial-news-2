Zynga Inc. (ZNGA) , the largest maker of
games that connect with  Facebook Inc. (FB) ’s website, added nine
developers to its publishing portfolio of 24 companies, bringing
in a potential new source of revenue for the struggling company.  Four games from outside developers recently became
available on Zynga.com, which players can visit instead of
loading them on Facebook, said Rob Dyer, the vice president of
partner publishing for Zynga.  The company has chosen games, including a miniature golf
simulator and fashion-design tool, that are unlike the games
currently in development by the “FarmVille” creator, he said
at a news conference at the San Francisco-based company’s
headquarters.  “We want genres that Zynga is not doing,” Dyer, a former
executive for  Sony Corp. (6758) ’s PlayStation business, said in an
interview. “We describe this in phases of crawl, walk and run.
We’re just starting to run.”  Analysts have criticized Zynga for being overly reliant on
Facebook for its revenue. Facebook, through its Credits service,
will handle the transactions for these games, as it does for
Zynga’s own products.  Zynga will take a cut of each transaction of sales from
partners’ games in exchange for promotion to some of Zynga’s 306
million users. Amy Sezak, a spokeswoman for Zynga, declined to
say how much the company takes.  -- Editors: Reed Stevenson, Michael Tighe  To contact the reporter on this story:
