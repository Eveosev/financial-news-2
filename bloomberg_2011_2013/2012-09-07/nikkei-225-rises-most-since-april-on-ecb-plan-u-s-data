Japan   stocks  rose a second day, with
the  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average posting its biggest gain since
March, as a European bond-buying plan, U.S. employment data and
more stimulus in China boosted the outlook for exporters.  Makita Corp. (6586) , a power-tool maker that gets more than 40
percent of sales in  Europe , advanced 4.1 percent as the yen
retreated to its lowest versus the euro since July. Honda Motor
Co., an automaker that counts  North America  as its biggest
market, gained 5.2 percent. Hitachi Construction Machinery Co.,
which relies on China for 17 percent of revenue, climbed 4.7
percent after the nation’s government approved a major road
construction plan.  The Nikkei 225 advanced 2.2 percent to 8,871.65 at the
close of trading in  Tokyo , the most since March 27. Volume was
38 percent above its 30-day average. The equity benchmark posted
a 0.4 percent gain this week. The broader Topix Index climbed
2.3 percent to 735.17, with more than three shares rising for
each that fell.  “We can see this rally extend for a little bit,” Guy
Stear, the head of Asia Pacific research at Societe Generale SA
in  Hong Kong , said in a Bloomberg TV interview. “The fact that
the ECB wants to absorb more risk and the fact that they managed
to get it done despite the Bundesbank opposition -- all that in
the short term is positive. In the short term Asian stocks are
going to do better.”  The Topix dropped 16 percent from this year’s peak on March
27 through today on concern Europe’s debt crisis is deepening
and growth is slowing in China and the U.S. The gauge trades at
0.9 times book value, compared with 2.2 for the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index and 1.5 for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. A
number less than one means companies can be bought for less than
the value of their assets.  Nikkei Volatility  The  Nikkei Stock Average Volatility Index (VNKY)  tumbled 8.2
percent to 19.18 today, the most since July 27, as equities
advanced. The index indicates that traders are expecting a 5.5
percent swing on the equity benchmark in the next 30 days.  ECB President Mario Draghi yesterday said policy makers
agreed to an unlimited bond-purchase program to rein in  interest
rates  in the euro area. The program will target sovereign bonds
with maturities of one to three years in the most ambitious plan
yet to save the euro.  Companies that do business in Europe advanced. Makita rose
4.1 percent to 2,786 yen. Sysmex Corp., a medical-equipment
manufacturer that gets 30 percent of sales in the region, gained
4.2 percent to 3,580 yen.  U.S. Stocks  Iron and steel, energy and metals companies recorded some
of the biggest advances among the Topix’s 33  industries  today
amid speculation economic conditions will improve in Japan’s
largest markets. Just two groups declined.  Futures on the  S&P 500  gained 0.2 percent today. The
underlying index increased 2 percent, rising to its highest
level in four years, in  New York  yesterday. Claims for U.S.
jobless benefits fell to the lowest in a month, and a private
report showed American companies added more workers than
forecast. U.S. services expanded at a faster pace.  Honda Motor advanced 5.2 percent to 2,600 yen. Komatsu
Ltd., a construction-machinery maker that relies on the Americas
for about 25 percent of its sales, gained 6.6 percent to 1,592
yen.  China’s top planning agency approved plans to build 2,018
kilometers (1,254 miles) of roads, its second major construction
project announced this week, as the government boosts spending
on infrastructure to help spur economic growth.  Hitachi Construction rose 4.7 percent to 1,319 yen. Taiyo
Yuden Co., an electronics maker gets 30 percent of revenue in
 China , gained 7.1 percent to 705 yen.  To contact the reporter on this story:
