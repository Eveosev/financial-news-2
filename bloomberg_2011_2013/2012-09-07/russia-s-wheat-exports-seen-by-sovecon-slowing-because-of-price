Russia’s  wheat exports  to  Egypt  are
slowing as the cereal becomes more expensive, SovEcon said.  There were just two offers to sell Russian wheat for
delivery in early November because several other proposed sales
were canceled as traders doubted they would be able to fulfill
the commitments, Moscow-based researcher SovEcon  said  in a
statement on its website today, citing unidentified traders.  The number of offers is down from five made for October
delivery in the tender yesterday by Egypt’s General Authority
for Supply Commodities, according to two traders involved in the
process who asked to remain anonymous because they are not
allowed to speak to the media. On Sept. 1, exporters presented
10 Russian wheat offers to GASC for October delivery, according
to Bloomberg data.  Average prices for Russian wheat increased $6 to $10 a
metric ton this month, and French wheat was cheaper, SovEcon
said.  Russia , the world’s third biggest wheat exporter last
season, is seen to export 8 million tons in 2012-13 from 21.6
million tons a season earlier because of drought, according to
U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates. Russia’s government
forecasts 10 million to 14 million tons for all grain exports
this season, down from record 27.2 million tons in 2011-12.  To contact the reporter on this story:
