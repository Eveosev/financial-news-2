Groupe Bruxelles Lambert SA (GBLB)  raised
400 million euros ($512 million) in the issuance of convertible
bonds for shares of Suez Environnement, the second-largest water
company.  The issue has a 3-year maturity with a coupon of 0.125
percent, resulting in a 20 percent premium to Suez
Environnement’s share price, the Paris-based utility said today
in an e-mailed statement.  GBL remains a shareholder of Suez with a 7.2 percent stake
and retains its representatives on Suez’s board of directors,
according to the Suez statement. It said Suez provides 91
million people with drinking water and 63 million with
wastewater treatment services on five continents.  GDF Suez (GSZ)  holds almost a 36 percent stake in Suez.  To contact the reporter on this story:
