The ruble strengthened for a fourth
day, erasing earlier declines against the dollar, on rising
appetite for riskier assets after the  European Central Bank 
announced its bond-buying program.  The ruble rose 0.8 percent to 31.6973 per dollar at 7 p.m.
in Moscow, its longest stretch of gains in seven weeks. The
ruble weakened 0.6 percent versus the euro at 40.5400, leaving
it less than 0.1 percent stronger against the central bank’s
target euro-dollar basket.  ECB President  Mario Draghi  said yesterday policy makers
agreed to an unlimited bond-purchase program to lower borrowing
costs for struggling economies.  Brent crude  rose 0.5 percent to
$114.07 per barrel today, increasing for a second day. Oil and
natural gas account for about 50 percent of Russia’s state
revenue.  “The ruble continues to appreciate on the back of external
markets,” Igor Akinshin, a Moscow-based currency trader at  Alfa
Bank  said by phone. “The markets heard from Draghi what they
wanted to hear.”  Non-deliverable forwards showed the ruble at 32.1675 per
dollar in three months against 32.3955 yesterday.  The extra yield investors demand to own Russia’s dollar
bonds over U.S. Treasuries rose 1 basis point to 207, according
to JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s EMBI Global Index. An index of five-
year government bond yields compiled by the Micex fell 5 basis
points to 7.472 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
