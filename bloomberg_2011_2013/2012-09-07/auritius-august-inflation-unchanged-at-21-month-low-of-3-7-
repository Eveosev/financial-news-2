Mauritius’s inflation rate was
unchanged in August at a 21-month low, giving the Indian Ocean
island’s central bank room to cut  interest rates  to spur growth.  Inflation was unchanged at 3.7 percent in August, Port
Louis-based Statistics Mauritius said in a  statement  on its
website today.  The $10 billion economy will probably expand at its slowest
pace in three years as the debt crisis in Europe curbs tourism
and exports. The statistics office cut its growth forecast to
3.5 percent from 3.6 percent in June.  The Bank of Mauritius left its benchmark interest rate on
hold at 4.9 percent on June 11.  The rupee weakened 0.7 percent to 31.15 a dollar by 11:34
a.m., according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
