Liberia plans to boost electricity
output by almost five-fold by 2018 to reduce the cost of doing
business in the West African nation, the  Finance Ministry  said.  The country will spend $20 million in the 2012-13 fiscal
year building a 10-megawatt heavy fuel oil-fired plant, while
another two 10-megawatt facilities are planned over the next 18
to 24 months financed by the  World Bank  and the Japanese
government, the ministry said in a statement today in Monrovia,
the capital. The three new plants are expected to more than
halve the cost of power in Liberia, it said.  Liberia is rebuilding its economy after civil wars between
1989 and 2003 in which an estimated 250,000 people died and most
of its infrastructure was destroyed. The country currently
produces 23 megawatts of electricity for its 4.1 million people,
one of the lowest per capita rates in the world, according to
the ministry.  “This makes doing business very expensive for small and
medium businesses, and manufacturing almost impossible,”
Finance Minister Amara Konneh said in the statement. “That’s
why our priority now is energy.”  A further $35 million has been allocated to improve
transmission and distribution networks, while the government is
in talks with  Germany , Norway and the  European Investment Bank 
about the $200 million needed to rehabilitate the 64-megawatt
Mount Coffee hydro-power station, the ministry said.  “Within five to six years, we want to have 100MW of power
available,” Mr Konneh said.  Liberia’s $672 million budget for 2012-13, approved in
August, relies on donors funding 10 percent, while $80 million
will be raised from borrowings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
