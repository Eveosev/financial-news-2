German exports unexpectedly rose in
July, helping  Europe ’s largest economy to weather the region’s
debt crisis.  Exports, adjusted for work days and seasonal changes,
increased 0.5 percent from June, when they fell 1.4 percent, the
Federal Statistics Office in Wiesbaden said today. Economists
forecast a 0.5 percent decline, according to the median of 12
estimates in a Bloomberg News  survey . Imports gained 0.9 percent
from June.  While the debt crisis has dented demand for German goods in
Europe, companies have compensated with sales to faster-growing
 emerging markets . That has helped boost employment and domestic
demand, insulating the economy. Still, economic growth slowed in
the second quarter and business confidence has dropped for four
straight months.  Germany ’s trade surplus narrowed to 16.9 billion euros ($21
billion) in July from 18 billion euros in June, today’s report
showed. The surplus in the current account, a measure of all
trade including services, was 12.8 billion euros, down from 18.5
billion euros a month earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
