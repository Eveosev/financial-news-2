The Czech economy continued to
shrink in the second quarter as households cut consumption and
the government reduced spending, fueling the second recession
since 2009.  Gross domestic product  fell 0.2 percent from the previous
quarter, the third consecutive contraction, compared with a
revised 0.6 percent decline in the first three months of the
year, the Czech Statistics Office said in a statement on its
website. GDP fell 1 percent from a year ago.  The Czech economy is suffering from weak domestic demand as
the government cut investments and raised sales taxes to trim
the  budget deficit  below the European Union’s limit of 3 percent
of GDP. Foreign trade remains in surplus, though the  EU’s debt
crisis has curbed demand for cars and electronics as the 27-
nation bloc buys 80 percent of Czech exports, including from
companies such as carmaker Skoda Auto AS.  Household spending and government consumption both fell 1.1
percent in the second quarter from the first three months, the
statistics office said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
