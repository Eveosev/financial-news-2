Hellenic Telecommunications
Organization SA (HTO) , known as OTE, expects to raise around 1 billion
euros ($1.26 billion) in the coming months from the sale of two
units,  Euro2day  said, without citing anyone.  OTE is anticipating its Globul mobile unit in  Bulgaria  to
sell for around 800 million euros and that of Hellas Sat SA for
around 150 million euros, helping to provide much of the
liquidity needed to refinance debt in the coming years, the
Athens-based financial website reported today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
