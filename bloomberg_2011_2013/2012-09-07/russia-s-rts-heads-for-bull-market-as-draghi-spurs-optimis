Russian stocks rallied to a four-
month high, as steelmakers gained on the optimism the  European
Central Bank ’s unlimited debt purchase plan will boost demand
for metals.  The  Micex Index (INDEXCF)  surged 1.3 percent to 1,474.58 by the close

cataclysms this year,” Dmitry Mikhailov, who manages $130
million in assets at  Renaissance Capital  in Moscow, said by
phone. “The  European debt crisis  issue has been postponed for
at least a few months, that was the main message investors took
from Draghi’s speech.”  The RTS Index jumped 2.4 percent to 1,471.80, after rising

showcase Vladivostok, 4,000 miles east of Moscow, as leaders
gather for this week’s APEC summit.  APEC Summit  Russia is looking to  Asia  as the European Union, which
accounts for about half of its trade, grapples with a three-
year-old debt crisis. Putin, who’s targeting faster growth and a
greater role for investment, says the 21 APEC economies
represent the best bet to fuel global expansion as traditional
engines such as the U.S. and Europe flag.  Standard & Poor’s GSCI Index of raw materials gained 0.2
