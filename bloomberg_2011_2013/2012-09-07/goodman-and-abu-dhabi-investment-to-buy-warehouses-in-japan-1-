Goodman Group (GMG) , Australia’s biggest
industrial property trust, said it had partnered with Abu Dhabi
Investment Council, a government-controlled  fund manager , to buy
warehouses in  Japan .  Goodman raised $500 million that will enable the fund to
acquire more than $1 billion of logistics properties in major
cities such as Tokyo and Osaka, according to the statement
released today. Goodman also said its Japan Core Fund had
received allocations from three global institutional investors,
taking external commitments to over $100 million.  “Today’s announcement further demonstrates our successful
capital partnering approach with major global investor groups
and underscores our strategy of matching third party capital
with our growing development pipeline,” said Greg Goodman,
chief executive of Goodman, in a statement.  Japan’s distribution centers are drawing investors as the
market rebounds from record-high vacancies about two years ago.
The vacancy rate for large multi-tenant warehouses in Tokyo
metropolitan area fell to 3.6 percent as of June 30, from 5.2
percent in December, as manufacturers seek to improve supply
chains and distribution networks following last year’s
earthquake, according to  CBRE Group Inc.   Goodman’s venture with  Abu Dhabi  will start with an
investment in three development projects in Tokyo Bay and Osaka
with a total 250,000 square meters (2.7 million square feet) of
gross leasable area.  To contact the reporters on this story:
