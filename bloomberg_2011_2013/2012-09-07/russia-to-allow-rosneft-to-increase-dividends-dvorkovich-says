The Russian government plans to
allow OAO Rosneft, the country’s biggest oil producer, to
increase its dividend payments to 25 percent of net income,
Deputy Prime Minister  Arkady Dvorkovich  said.  “I have signed the directive,” Dvorkovich, who is in
charge of the energy industry, said today on his  Twitter Inc. 
account. “The government will soon allow Rosneft to raise
dividends.”  Chief Executive Officer  Igor Sechin  said in June that
state-run Rosneft will increase its total payout to 7.53 rubles
a share on 2011 income. The board had recommended 3.45 rubles a
share in April. President Vladimir Putin called on Sechin to
increase the company’s dividend on June 15.  To contact the reporter on this story:
