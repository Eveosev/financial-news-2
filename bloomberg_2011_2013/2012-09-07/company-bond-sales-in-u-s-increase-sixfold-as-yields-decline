Corporate bond  sales  in the U.S.
surged more than sixfold this week as yields hovered at about
record lows.  Deere & Co. (DE) , the largest maker of agricultural equipment,
and  WellPoint Inc. (WLP)  led borrowers selling $35.7 billion of debt,
compared with $5.5 billion last week, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. Sales were the highest since $40.2 billion in the
five days ended Aug. 10.  Issuance accelerated as borrowers seized a window of calm
while the  European Central Bank  prepared to announce a plan for
bond buying to bolster the region’s common currency and
investors awaited today’s payrolls report in the U.S. for
signals on whether the labor market is stagnating in the world’s
largest economy. The  Federal Reserve  may signal at next week’s
policy-setting meeting its willingness to undertake more
quantitative easing to stimulate the economy.  “It makes for an opportune time,” Jody Lurie, a corporate
credit analyst at Janney Montgomery Scott LLC in Philadelphia,
said in a telephone interview. “Considering the last few weeks
have been dead, you expect companies will be itching to issue.”  Yields on bonds from the most creditworthy to the riskiest
borrowers decreased to a record-low 3.84 percent on Sept. 3,
before increasing to 3.88 percent, according to the Bank of
America Merrill Lynch U.S. Corporate & High Yield Master index.
The extra yield investors demand to own corporate bonds rather
than government debentures decreased 5 basis points since Aug.
31 to 262 basis points, or 2.62 percent.  Investment-Grade Sales  Sales of investment-grade debt reached $31.3 billion, the
most since $51 billion was sold in the period ended March 9,
Bloomberg data show. Sales increased from $5.5 billion last week
and compare with a 2012 weekly average of $20 billion.  Yields increased from a record-low 2.98 percent on Aug. 31
to 3.04 percent, Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data show.
Spreads decreased 3 basis points to 183 basis points.  WellPoint, the second-biggest U.S. health insurer, raised
$3.25 billion in four-parts for its acquisition of Amerigroup
Corp., Bloomberg data show. The offering included $1 billion
each of 3.3 percent notes due January 2023 that yielded 175
basis points more than similar-maturity Treasuries and 4.65
percent bonds maturing in 2043 at a spread of 200 basis points.  The operator of Blue Cross and Blue Shield insurance plans,
based in Indianapolis, also sold $625 million each of 1.25
percent, three-year notes at 95 basis points and 1.875 percent
securities due January 2018 at 130 basis points, Bloomberg data
show.  JPMorgan Estimate  Sales of investment-grade debt in the U.S. are estimated to
reach $750 billion this year, up from $700 billion, analysts led
by  Eric Beinstein  at JPMorgan Chase & Co. wrote in a report
today. JPMorgan has helped manage the most high-grade corporate
bond sales in the U.S. this year with about $83.5 billion,
excluding self-led transactions, Bloomberg data show.  “The new figure reflects that supply was running both
ahead of expectations and ahead of the pace over the past few
years,” according to the bank.  Yields on 10-year Treasuries increased eight basis points
to 1.68 percent yesterday as the European Central Bank announced
a bond-purchasing plan.  The ECB’s bond-buying program “will enable us to address
severe distortions in government bond markets which originate
from, in particular, unfounded fears on the part of investors of
the reversibility of the euro,” ECB President  Mario Draghi  said
at a news conference yesterday in  Frankfurt . “Under appropriate
conditions, we will have a fully effective backstop to avoid
destructive scenarios with potentially severe challenges for
 price stability  in the euro area.”  ‘Effective Backstop’  The economy added 96,000 workers last month following a
revised 141,000 rise in July that was smaller than initially
estimated, Labor Department figures showed today in  Washington .
The median estimate of 92 economists surveyed by Bloomberg
called for a gain of 130,000.  Deere issued $1 billion of debt, selling $500 million each
of 0.7 percent, three-year notes to yield 42 basis points more
than similar-maturity Treasuries and 1.2 percent, five-year debt
at a relative yield of 62 basis points, Bloomberg data show. The
bonds are rated A2, the sixth level of investment grade, by
Moody’s Investors Service.  Deere Offering  Sales of high-yield bonds reached $4.4 billion and follow a
shutdown in sales last week, Bloomberg data show. Issuance was
the most since $11.4 billion in the five days ended Aug. 17 and
compares with a 2012 weekly average of $5.7 billion.  Yields on junk debt decreased 7 basis points this week to
7.28 percent, Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data show.
Spreads declined 18 basis points to 580 basis points.  Issuers planning sales include Nuveen Investments Inc., the
asset manager owned by Madison Dearborn Partners LLC, with a
$1.15 billion offering and Houston-based Midstates Petroleum Co.
Inc. with a $550 million issue, Bloomberg data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
