Vestas Wind Systems A/S (VWS) , the turbine
manufacturer trying to slash 250 million euros ($317 million)
from  fixed costs , is pioneering the transportation of blades by
rail to cut transit costs.  The windmill maker worked with logistics company SNCF
Geodis to move nine 55-meter (180-feet) blades by rail from its
factory in Lauchhammer,  Germany , to the port of Esbjerg,
 Denmark , where they are due to arrive today, the company said in
an e-mailed statement. The Danish company said it expects to cut
transport costs by 10 percent to 15 percent compared with moving
the gear by road.  It takes one locomotive 20 hours to transport nine blades,
compared with 36 hours required by nine trucks and 18 pilot cars
to complete the same task, Aarhus-based Vestas said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
