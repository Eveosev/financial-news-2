A total of 18 supertankers have
shipped North Sea crude to  South Korea  since December, according
to vessel reports and ship-tracking data from  IHS Inc. (IHS)   The unprecedented export flow is taking place after South
Korea and the European Union signed a free-trade agreement in
July 2011. The accord exempted the nation’s refineries from a 3
percent tax on imports from the EU. More than half of the North
Sea oil shipped to South Korea is Forties blend, a grade used to
set Dated Brent, the benchmark for more than half of the world’s
crude, according to the table of ships chartered.  Details of VLCC fixtures since December are as follows.
Freight costs are in millions of dollars. Hound Point,  Scotland ,
is the loading point for Forties crude and Mongstad is the
terminal for Norwegian Troll and Heidrun grades. One VLCC
typically carries 2 million barrels of crude.  To contact the reporter on this story:
