Georgian billionaire Bidzina Ivanishvili’s opposition coalition is losing support to
President Mikheil Saakashvili’s party before parliamentary
elections in October, a poll showed.  As many as 37 percent of likely voters would back
Saakashvili’s National Movement if the ballot were held
tomorrow, higher than 36 percent support in June, according to
the National Democratic Institute, which conducted the survey.
Ivanishvili’s party had 12 percent backing, down from 18
percent, Luis Navarro, the NDI’s country director, told
reporters today in the capital, Tbilisi.  Ivanishvili, whose wealth Forbes puts at $6.4 billion,
entered politics to challenge Saakashvili’s ruling party and
displace Vano Merabishvili as the Black Sea nation’s next prime
minister. Saakashvili’s second and final term as president ends
in 2013.  The nationwide survey, funded by the Swedish International
Development Agency, polled 2,038 people in August and has a
margin of error of three percentage points. This is the last
survey to be conducted before October’s elections, Navarro said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
