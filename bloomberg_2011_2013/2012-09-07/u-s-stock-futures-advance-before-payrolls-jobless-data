U.S.  stocks  rose, sending the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index to its highest level in more than
four years, amid bets on central bank stimulus as American
payrolls increased less than projected.  Commodity and financial shares climbed the most among 10
S&P 500  groups  as Bank of America Corp. and Cliffs Natural
Resources Inc. jumped at least 5.4 percent.  Caterpillar Inc. (CAT)  and
 Alpha Natural  Resources Inc. added more than 3.9 percent as
China announced infrastructure projects. Google Inc. closed
above $700 for the first time since 2007.  Intel (INTC)  Corp. and  Kraft
Foods Inc. (KFT)  fell more than 3.6 percent, the most in the  Dow Jones
Industrial Average , amid disappointing forecasts.  The S&P 500 rose 0.4 percent to 1,437.92 at 4 p.m. in New
York. The index rallied 2.2 percent for the holiday-shortened
week, the most since June. The Dow added 14.64 points, or 0.1
percent, to 13,306.64, reversing a loss in the final hour of
trading. Volume for exchange-listed stocks in the U.S. was 6.51
billion shares, or 7.8 percent above the three-month average.  “The market is taking this weak jobs number as a positive
because it means that we’re going to get action coming from
Bernanke and company,” said Michael Mullaney, who helps manage
$9.5 billion as chief investment officer at Fiduciary Trust in
Boston. He spoke in a telephone interview. “It’s just this new
upside-down world of investing that we’re living in where bad
news is good news for assets.”  Equities rose as Labor Department figures showed the
economy added 96,000 workers last month following a revised
141,000 rise in July that was smaller than initially estimated.
The median estimate of 92 economists surveyed by Bloomberg
called for a gain of 130,000. Unemployment unexpectedly fell to
8.1 percent, and hourly earnings were unchanged.  Economic Slowdown  Employers may be reluctant to expand headcounts as they
face a global economic slowdown and the so-called fiscal cliff
of automatic tax increases and government spending cuts. The
damage inflicted by the lack of progress on jobs is the reason
Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  last week said the
central bank may need to do more. The Fed’s Open Market
Committee meets next week to discuss policy and will release a
statement on Sept. 13 after a two-day meeting.  The S&P 500 climbed 2 percent yesterday as the European
Central Bank announced specifics of its bond-buying plan and
data boosted optimism in the American economy. The index has
risen 14 percent this year as European leaders worked to tame
the region’s debt crisis and the Fed vowed to safeguard the
economic recovery.  ‘Missing Rally’  “The global risk has been abating significantly,
especially in Europe,” Douglas Cote, Hartford, Connecticut-
based chief market strategist at ING U.S. Investment Management,
said in a phone interview. His firm oversees more than $160
billion. “The bigger concern about market participants is
missing a fourth-quarter rally.  Hedge funds , the shorts, they
will have to cover. They will have to capitulate and I think
that’s going to provide the next up-leg.”  Andrew Garthwaite , a strategist at Credit Suisse Group AG,
raised his forecast for the S&P 500 this year to 1,500 from
1,425, saying ECB President  Mario Draghi ’s announcement of an
unlimited bond-purchase program is a “game-changer” in a note
today. He also cited improving economic data, the likelihood of
a third round of Fed stimulus, or quantitative easing, and
supportive valuations. He boosted his earnings estimate for
companies in the S&P 500 to $100.10 a share from $99.60.  Commodity Shares  Commodity, financial and industrial shares in the S&P 500
climbed at least 0.9 percent for the biggest advances among 10
groups today. The Morgan Stanley  Cyclical Index (CYC)  rose 1.6 percent
while the KBW Bank Index added 1.6 percent to the highest level
since April. Bank of America jumped 5.4 percent to $8.80.  China approved plans to build 2,018 kilometers (1,254
miles) of roads while backing nine sewage-treatment plants, five
port and warehouse projects, and two waterway upgrades,
according to statements on the website of the National
Development and Reform Commission yesterday. The announcements
are a sign the government is stepping up stimulus efforts to
revive economic growth.  Cliffs Natural (CLF) , the largest U.S. iron-ore producer, rallied
14 percent to $39.91. Caterpillar, the world’s largest maker of
construction and mining machines, rose 3.9 percent to $88.10.
Alpha Natural, the second-largest U.S. coal producer, surged 17
percent to $6.90 for the biggest advance in the S&P 500.  SunTrust Banks Inc. (STI) , the lender that invested in  Coca-Cola
Co. (KO)  in 1919, rose 3.1 percent to $27.50 after announcing plans
to liquidate its stake to help cover costs of restructuring bad
loans. The transaction will boost third-quarter net income by
about $750 million, or $1.40 a share, the bank said.  Green Mountain  Green Mountain Coffee Roasters Inc. (GMCR)  climbed 13 percent to
$27.83. The maker of Keurig coffee machines has “meaningful
room” for K-Cup to increase household penetration, Matthew DiFrisco, an analyst with Lazard Capital Markets, wrote in a
report initiating coverage of the stock with a buy rating.  Smith & Wesson Holding Corp. (SWHC)  surged 12 percent to $10.07.
The handgun manufacturer raised its earnings forecast for fiscal
year 2013 to a range between 85 cents and 90 cents a share.
Sales will be at least $530 million.  Google, based in  Mountain View , California, added 1 percent
to $706.15, it’s highest level since December 2007.  Intel, the world’s largest semiconductor maker, slumped 3.6
percent to $24.19, the lowest level since December. Third-
quarter sales will be $13.2 billion, plus or minus $300 million,
compared to a prior projection of $13.8 billion to $14.8
billion, the company said. Intel in July scaled back its annual
sales forecast as personal-computer demand fails to rebound
among consumers in the U.S. and Europe.  Kraft Slips  Kraft, the food producer that will split into two companies
next month, fell 5.5 percent to $39.99 for the biggest retreat
in the Dow. Chief Financial Officer David Brearton told
investors at a conference in Boston yesterday that 2012 and 2013
earnings may be lower than expected.  “The market is thinking that central banks continue to
have their back,” John Augustine, who helps manage $25 billion
as chief market strategist at Cincinnati-based Fifth Third
Bancorp, said in a phone interview. “What frustrates investment
managers is being more focused on slowing economic growth and
what that’s going to do to profits.”  Pandora Media Inc. (P) , a Internet-radio pioneer, plunged 17
percent to $10.47.  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  is considering introducing an
online service to stream music based on users’ tastes, two
people with knowledge of the plans said, potentially competing
with Pandora.  Closing In  The $1.9 trillion restored to U.S. equity prices in 2012
has pushed the  S&P 500  within 10 percent of a record, more than
7 percentage points closer than any country among the world’s
biggest stock markets.  Yesterday’s advance left the S&P 500 9.3 percent from its
all-time high of  1,565.15 (SPX) , reached Oct. 9, 2007. More gains are
likely as bearish investors give up and start buying, according
to Laszlo Birinyi, president of Birinyi Associates Inc. in
Westport, Connecticut.  “They realize it isn’t working,” Birinyi, an equity
trader for Salomon Brothers Inc. in the 1980s, said in a
telephone interview. “The excuses of no volume and earnings
aren’t going to be good -- that’s not happening, and maybe it’s
time to join the party.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
