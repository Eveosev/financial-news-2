About 1.6 million Malawians will
need food aid before this year’s harvest, an eightfold increase
from last year, because of poor crops and rising prices, the
United Nations  World Food Programme  said.  “Prolonged dry spells ravaged this year’s harvest,
weakening resilience and coping mechanisms in many homes,”
Rome-based WFP said in an e-mailed statement. “In some areas,
this is the third consecutive year of drought.”  Malawi will use 25,000 metric tons of stored corn to
provide relief, while the U.S. will give food worth $7.8
million, according to the statement. The U.K. will donate $4.7
million in funding, it said. The first phase of the aid
operation will target 200,000 people, WFP said.  As many as 15 out of 28 districts are facing food shortages
during the so-called lean season, the period leading up to crop
harvests, WFP spokeswoman Claudia Altorio said in the statement.
Southern African farmers traditionally plant rain-dependent
crops in November and harvest between March and April.  To contact the reporter on this story:
