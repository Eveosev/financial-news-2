RWE AG (RWE) ’s market share in the  Czech
Republic  declined to 45 percent from 80 percent in 2006 when the
country liberalized the gas market,  Lidove Noviny  reported,
citing its own research.  The German utility keeps losing Czech customers to cheaper
competition because it is bound by long-term disadvantageous
contracts with Russia’s  Gazprom OAO (GAZP) , the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
