Entertainment One Ltd. (ETO) , the
distributor of The Lord of the Rings films, said it hired
JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Barclays Plc to arrange financing for
its acquisition of Alliance Films Holdings Inc.  The banks are asking Entertainment One’s lenders to add a
term loan of as much as C$150 million ($153 million) to its
existing credit facilities, the London and Toronto-based company
said in a statement today. JPMorgan and Barclays will provide
the financing if the existing lenders don’t agree to expand the
facility.  Entertainment One will also seek to extend the maturity of
its revolving credit from October 2014, according to the
statement.  The company will also raise 110 million pounds ($176
million) from share sales to fund the deal.  Entertainment One said today it agreed to buy Montreal-
based Alliance Films from  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  and
Investissement Quebec for C$225 million to become the largest
film distributor in Canada and the U.K.  To contact the reporter on this story:
