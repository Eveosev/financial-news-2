The cost of cocoa butter relative to
the price of beans rose this week in  Europe  as processors are
still curbing bean grinding, according to three traders with
direct knowledge of the sales.  The ratio was 1.55 to 1.62 times the price of cocoa futures
on NYSE Liffe in London, said the traders, who declined to be
identified because they aren’t authorized to speak to the media.
It was 1.5 to 1.52 last week, when a four-month rally stalled.
Cocoa butter accounts for as much as 20 percent of the weight of
a chocolate bar. The beans also yield cocoa powder, used to make
ice cream, cookies and soft drinks.  “Cocoa butter is actually getting quite tight now, as
grinders have not been producing much butter in the first half
of 2012,”  Kona Haque , a London-based analyst at Macquarie Group
Ltd., said in a report e-mailed on Sept. 4.  Ratios began rallying in May after grinders started buying
the product to slow bean processing. The ratio was at 1.06 on
May 25, according to data from KnowledgeCharts, a unit of
 Commodities Risk Analysis , a research company in Bethlehem,
 Pennsylvania . Euromar Commodities GmbH slowed grindings at its
factory in Fehrbellin,  Germany , this year and Delfi Cocoa
(Europe) GmbH started to renovate its plant in Hamburg July 1.  European cocoa processing may drop 15 percent in the third
quarter, according to the average of 10 trader estimates in a
Bloomberg survey published last month. Factories slowed grinding
because powder prices started to fall. Powder in Europe cost
3,043 euros ($3,845) a ton on Aug. 31, 1.3 percent less than a
week earlier, KnowledgeCharts data showed.  Cocoa futures climbed 7.1 percent in  London  last week. The
price rose 0.4 percent to 1,741 pounds ($2,783) a ton by 1:49
p.m.  “With butter stocks now finally falling and grindings
expected to remain slow in the third quarter, there is a real
risk that butter will turn from surplus to shortage,” Haque
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
