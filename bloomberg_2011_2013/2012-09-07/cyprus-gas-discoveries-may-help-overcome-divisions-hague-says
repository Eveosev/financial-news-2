British foreign secretary  William Hague  said that plans by Cyprus, a former British colony, to
develop recently discovered natural gas off its southern coast
may help overcome the island’s divisions.  “It should be regarded in that way by all involved and we
have supported the rights of Cyprus to develop resources,”
Hague told reporters in Nicosia today after meeting Cypriot
president Demetris Christofias. “But I hope that by doing so it
can somehow be an incentive for the settlement of the problem
rather than a disincentive”.  Cyprus, which announced its first gas discovery in
December, has been divided between its Greek and Turkish
communities since  Turkey  invaded the northern part of the island
in 1974 after a coup aimed at uniting it with  Greece . Turkey,
the only country that recognizes the breakaway state in the
north, opposes hydrocarbon exploration by the Republic of Cyprus
run by Greek Cypriots.  There is concern in  Europe  and the rest of the world over
the lack of progress in negotiations to reunify the east
Mediterranean island, “It is something that the world wants to
see resolved,” said Hague.  To contact the reporter on this story:
