Stone Harbor  Investment Partners
hired Bill Perry from  Morgan Stanley (MS)  as a partner and portfolio
manager to build out its emerging-market corporate debt team.  Perry started with Stone Harbor in  New York  on Sept. 4,
according to Jim Craige, a portfolio manager and partner with
the firm, which oversees $56.6 billion in assets, including $47
billion of securities from developing nations. Perry will work
with Chris Wilder, Stone Harbor’s London-based corporate debt
portfolio manager, Craige said.  “We think corporates will grow and it’s a very labor-
intensive business,” Craige said in a telephone interview from
New York. “Depending on how the market develops, we’ll probably
hire more people as well.”  Stone Harbor’s emerging-market assets under management have
climbed 42 percent from the end of last year, Craige said.
Emerging-market debt has  returned  14 percent this year as the
MSCI  Emerging Markets  stock index advanced 5.8 percent.  The average yield for dollar-denominated emerging-market
debt is at a record low 4.78 percent, according to JPMorgan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
