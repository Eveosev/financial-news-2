Seamless Distribution AB (SEAM) , a Swedish
developer of software for mobile payment solutions, rose the
most in two months in Stockholm after the company signed a
distribution agreement with EG Sverige AB.  The deal means retailers using EG’s business software can
offer customers the ability to pay with Seamless’ SEQR mobile
solution, the company said in a statement.  Seamless stock rose as much as 2.20 kronor, or 14 percent,
and was up 12 percent to 17.30 kronor as of 10:15 a.m. in
Stockholm, the biggest gainer on the OMX Stockholm All-Share
Index. The company, which is based in the Swedish capital, has
advanced 69 percent this year, compared with a 7.5 percent
advance for the  Stockholm  all-share index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
