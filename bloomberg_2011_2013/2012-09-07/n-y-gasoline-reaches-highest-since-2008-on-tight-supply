Spot gasoline in New York jumped to
the highest level in almost four years as supplies tightened
after Hurricane Isaac shut  Gulf Coast  refineries.  Prices increased as stockpiles of blending components in
the Gulf Coast, which include reformulated blendstock, or RBOB,
fell 1.8 million barrels to 53.7 million barrels, Energy
Department data showed. The Gulf Coast delivered 57 percent of
East Coast gasoline supply in June.  “Gulf coast blending components went down,” said  Sander Cohan , a global transportation fuels analyst and principal with
Energy Security Analysis Inc. in Wakefield, Massachusetts.
“That will put pressure on inventories which were already a
little tight heading into the hurricane.”  The premium for RBOB in New York Harbor rose 12.12 cents to
35 cents a gallon versus futures traded on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange  at 11:58 a.m., according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. It’s the highest level since Sept. 16, 2008. Prompt
delivery rose 17.11 cents to $3.3909 a gallon.  Gasoline  inventories  on the East Coast increased 379,000
barrels to 49.8 million, according to the Energy Department, the
lowest  seasonal level  since 2007.  Valero Energy Corp.’s St. Charles and Meraux refineries in
Louisiana are “progressing as expected” in their restarts
after Isaac,  Bill Day  a spokesman for the company in  San
Antonio , said in an e-mail. Phillips 66’s Alliance plant is
restarting after losing power Sept. 5 for the second time in
about a week.  The premium for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in the
Gulf Coast rose 3 cents to 12 cents a gallon versus futures.  Petroleos de Venezuela SA will resume normal operations at
its 645,000-barrel-a-day Amuay oil refinery in about a week
after an Aug. 25 explosion knocked the country’s largest plant
offline, Jesus Luongo, head of refining, said yesterday.  “Amuay could definitely be a factor” in depleting overall
gasoline supplies, Cohan said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
