Falling orders for industrial
machinery and other big-ticket items are signaling losses for
U.S. stocks, according to  Albert Edwards , a global strategist at
Societe Generale SA.  As the CHART OF THE DAY shows, orders for capital goods
other than aircraft have tended to track the Standard & Poor’s
500 Index during the past 15 years. Edwards included a similar
chart in a report published yesterday.  Orders fell 8.3 percent in the first seven months of this
year, according to data compiled by the Commerce Department. The
 S&P 500  added 9.7 percent during the period, which accounted for
most of its 14 percent gain for the year through yesterday.  “It will not be long before the U.S. equity market
reacts” to the decline in orders, a harbinger of the third
recession since 2001, Edwards wrote. The chart shows the last
two economic contractions.  Reductions in analysts’ earnings estimates are another
warning sign, according to Edwards, who reiterated his stance
that stocks are in a  bear market  that he calls “The Ice Age.”
The average projection for companies worldwide slipped 2 percent
in August, bringing this year’s decline to 15 percent, according
to data cited in the report.  “High levels of investor hope” have lifted share prices
as the profit outlook worsens, the London-based strategist
wrote. “Investors must voluntarily give up hope” before the
Ice Age ends, the report said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
