The price of an option to buy United
Nations Certified Emission Reduction credits at 2.50 euros
($3.17) a metric ton plunged 21 percent to a record after 9.3
million tons changed hands over the past two days.  The option’s price dropped 7 cents yesterday to 27 cents a
ton, according to settlement data from the ICE Futures Europe
exchange in  London . December futures first dropped below the
strike price on Sept. 5 and declined 2.9 percent today to 2.33
euros a ton as of 9:56 a.m. London time.  The exchange cleared 8.3 million tons of the option on
Sept. 5 and 1 million tons yesterday, its first volumes, the
data show. At the settlement price on Sept. 5 of 34 cents a ton,
the total amount cleared would have cost 3.2 million euros.  CER futures are declining amid a glut in the EU carbon
market, which has restricted the use of offsets for compliance
with its climate-protection laws.  Factories, power utilities and airlines in the European
market, the world’s biggest cap-and-trade program by traded
volume, can use EU permits or a limited amount of cheaper CERs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
