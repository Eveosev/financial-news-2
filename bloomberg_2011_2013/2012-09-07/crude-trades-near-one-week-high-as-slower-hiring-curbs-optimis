Oil advanced for a third day as U.S.
employers added fewer jobs in August than forecast, stoking
speculation the Federal Reserve will bolster stimulus measures.  Crude rose as much as 1.1 percent after a Labor Department
report showed U.S. employers hired 96,000 workers last month
following a revised 141,000 increase in July, pushing the dollar
lower against the euro. Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke , who also
has vowed to hold the key interest rate at virtually zero until
late 2014, said last week unemployment was of “grave concern.’’
Policy makers meet next week.  “Prices are going to be underpinned by expectations of
further quantitative easing,”  Michael Hewson , an analyst at CMC
Markets in London, said by phone. “The jobs numbers are bad
news in terms of the headline figure,  but the  unemployment rate 
is also down.”  Crude for October delivery was at $96.36 a barrel, up 83
cents, in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange
at 1:57 p.m. London time.  Brent oil for October settlement on the London-based ICE
Futures Europe exchange was at $114.25 a barrel, up 76 cents.  Unemployment unexpectedly fell to 8.1 percent, and hourly
earnings were unchanged, according to the Labor Department.  The dollar weakened 1.1 percent to $1.2768 versus the euro.  To contact the reporter on this story:
