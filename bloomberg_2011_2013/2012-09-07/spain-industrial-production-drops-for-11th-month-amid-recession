 Spanish  industrial production  fell
for an 11th straight month in July amid a second recession in
the euro area’s fourth-largest economy since 2009 and increased
budget cuts to curb the nation’s borrowing costs.  Output at factories, refineries and mines adjusted for the
number of working days fell 5.4 percent from a year earlier,
after declining a revised 6.1 percent in June, the National
Statistics Institute in  Madrid  said in an e-mailed statement
today.  Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy  last month gave up on the
prospect of an economic recovery next year as he increased to
more than 150 billion euros ($190 billion) the amount of budget
cuts and tax increases planned through 2014 to tackle the euro
area’s third-largest budget gap.  Spain ’s recession intensified in the  second quarter , while
unemployment reached 24.6 percent, the highest in the country’s
34 years of democratic history.  Fomento de Construcciones &
Contratas ’ cement unit last month said it is in talks with
unions to cut costs for an amount equivalent to three of its
eight plants in Spain.  To contact the reporter on this story:
