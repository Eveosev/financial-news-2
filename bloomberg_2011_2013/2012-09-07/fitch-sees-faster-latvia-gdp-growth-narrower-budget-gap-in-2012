Fitch Ratings  improved its outlook
for Latvia’s 2012 economic growth and  budget deficit , saying the
Baltic nation continues “to outperform expectations.”  Gross domestic product will probably rise 3.5 percent this
year, compared with a previous 2.5 percent estimate, Fitch said
today in a statement from  London . The budget deficit may narrow
to 2 percent of GDP, compared with an earlier 2.5 percent
projection, it said.  Latvia is rebounding from the world’s deepest recession in
2008-2009, which erased almost a quarter of economic output
after a property bubble bust and credit inflows dried up,
prompting an  International Monetary Fund  bailout. The economy
expanded 5 percent from a year earlier in the second quarter,
the statistics office reported today, the quickest pace in the
European Union.  “The risks to creditworthiness have diminished since our
review in late 2011,” Fitch said. “A continuation of positive
fiscal and macroeconomic trends could lead to a positive rating
action.”  Fitch rates Latvia BBB-, the lowest investment grade, with
a stable outlook. While the country’s banking industry is
solvent and profitable, the share of non-resident deposits may
pose a risk, Fitch said.  “The high proportion of non-resident deposits in the
banking system remain at risk of capital flight should risk
aversion increase, while continuing deleveraging by Nordic
parent banks restrict credit supply and international
reserves,” the ratings company said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
