The Syrian conflict is “rapidly
deteriorating,” as wounded people die because medical aid is
lacking and “immense destruction” is inflicted on
infrastructure and homes.  Speaking after a three-day visit to the country, where he
met President Bashar al-Assad, International Committee of the
Red Cross Chairman Peter Maurer said, “there have been many
casualties, and now the situation is rapidly deteriorating,”
according to an e-mailed statement today.  Assad “agreed on the necessity of urgently boosting
humanitarian aid.”    Wounded civilians “who could be saved are dying on a daily
basis because they lack access to medical care,” Maurer said in
the statement.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
