SMBC Nikko Securities Inc., the
investment banking unit of  Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc. (8316) ,
said it will close its euro-denominated money market fund as
interest rates hold at record lows in Europe.  Shareholders have until Dec. 6 to redeem their investment
in the fund, which opened in 1996, SMBC Nikko said in a
 statement  without providing details. The Tokyo-based firm is
closing the fund because of pressure on short-term euro
financial markets.  The  European Central Bank  lowered its benchmark rates to
record lows in July and hasn’t ruled out further cuts amid
slowing euro-region economic growth.  SMBC Nikko’s withdrawal follows Daiwa Europe Fund Managers
Ireland Ltd.’s Sept. 3 announcement to permanently close its
euro fund by the end of October “due to continuing low  interest
rates .”  SMBC Nikko’s euro fund has about 27.7 billion yen ($355
million) of assets under management, while Daiwa’s fund holdings
total about 16.7 billion yen, Reuters reported earlier today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
