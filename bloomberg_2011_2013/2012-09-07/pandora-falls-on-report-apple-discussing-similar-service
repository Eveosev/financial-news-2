Pandora Media Inc. (P) , the Internet-
radio pioneer, fell the most in six months after the Wall Street
Journal reported that Apple Inc. is in talks to license music
for a similar radio service.  Pandora  tumbled  17 percent to $10.47 at the close in New
York, for the biggest drop since March 7. The Oakland,
California-based company’s shares had gained 26 percent this
year through yesterday.  Apple, based in Cupertino, California, may create a service
that would work on its iPhone and iPad devices, as well as on
Mac computers and personal computers running  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) ’s
Windows operating system, the  newspaper  said, citing a source it
didn’t identify.  Apple’s presence in online music sales and installed base
of MP3 players, smartphones and tablets could make it more
competitive with Pandora than existing rivals such as Spotify
Ltd., the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
