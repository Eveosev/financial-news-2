Canadian  employment  rose faster than
economists forecast in August, more than recovering the prior
month’s decline, as part-time work increased.  Employment rose by 34,300 following the July decrease of
30,400,  Statistics Canada  said today in Ottawa, and the  jobless
rate  was unchanged at 7.3 percent. Economists surveyed by
 Bloomberg News  projected a 10,000 gain in jobs and 7.3 percent
unemployment, according to median forecasts.  Canada’s jobless rate will remain stalled over the next
year, according to economists surveyed by Bloomberg, and Prime
Minister  Stephen Harper  said in an interview with Bloomberg in
Vancouver yesterday there will be “sluggish” growth for an
extended period in much of the global economy.  “It’s an economy that is growing very slowly and a little
bit below potential, not enough to bring down the unemployment
rate any further,” said  Doug Porter , deputy chief economist at
BMO Capital Markets in Toronto.  Part-time positions rose by 46,700 in August, Statistics
Canada said today. Full-time employment fell by 12,500 in
August, the first decline in seven months.  Canada’s dollar appreciated 0.4 percent to 97.86 cents per
 U.S. dollar  at 8:52 a.m. in Toronto. One Canadian dollar buys
$1.0219. Bonds rose, with the yield on the two-year government
benchmark falling one basis point to 1.16 percent.  Transportation and warehousing jobs posted the biggest gain
by industry with an increase of 37,100 in August. Professional,
scientific and technical services rose by 20,000 and business,
building and other support services employment increased 19,000.  Full Capacity  “We expect near full capacity utilization for the balance
of the year,”  Algoma Central Corp. (ALC)  Chief Executive Officer Greg
Wight said on an Aug. 13 earnings call. The  St. Catharines ,
Ontario-based company owns a fleet of cargo ships that work
through the Great Lakes. “This is of course barring any
unexpected events that could be disrupted to the North American
economy.”  Private companies added 29,900 workers and public-sector
employment increased by 17,400 in August. Workers designated by
Statistics Canada as employees rose by 47,300 while the self-
employed decreased by 13,000.  Industrial Declines  The biggest job loss by industry in August was construction
with a drop of 44,000 positions, followed by a 17,200 decline
for the information, culture and recreation category.  Average hourly  earnings  of permanent employees rose 3.7
percent in August from a year earlier, slower than the prior
reading of 3.9 percent that was the fastest since April 2009.
The  Bank of Canada  says the figure is a key indicator of
inflation.  Two days ago, Bank of Canada Governor  Mark Carney  left his
 key interest rate  at 1 percent, where it’s been for two years,
aiming to encourage investment and consumption that he says will
drive growth. Carney gives a speech and will hold a press
conference later today near Calgary.  Unemployment has ranged between 7.2 percent and 7.6 percent
since March 2012, after falling from a peak of 8.7 percent
during the 2009 recession. Joblessness will remain around 7.2
percent over the next year according to a Bloomberg economist
survey.  Plant Closing  Paper maker  Cascades Inc. (CAS)  said Sept. 5 it will close a
folding carton plant in Lachute, Quebec, and move the work to
other factories. About 40 percent of the 155 employees may be
transferred to work at other locations, the Kingsey Falls,
Quebec, based company said.  Statistics Canada today also said labor  productivity  fell
0.4 percent between April and June from the previous quarter,
while economists forecast a 0.2 percent decline. The measure of
worker output per hour rose by 1 percent from a year earlier.
Unit labor costs rose 0.7 percent from the first quarter.  The U.S. today reported that payrolls rose less than
economists projected in August and the  unemployment rate 
declined as more Americans left the  labor force . The economy
added 96,000 workers last month following a revised 141,000 rise
in July that was smaller than initially estimated, Labor
Department figures showed today in Washington. The median
estimate of 92 economists surveyed by Bloomberg called for a
gain of 130,000. Unemployment unexpectedly fell to 8.1 percent.  “With the disappointment in the U.S. I think the Bank of
Canada realistically is just going to be talking about the
potential for higher  interest rates , and not acting, for some
time yet,” said Porter at BMO Capital Markets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
