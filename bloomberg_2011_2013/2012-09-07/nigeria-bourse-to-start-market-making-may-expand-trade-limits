The  Nigerian Stock Exchange  may
alter regulations on trading limits as part of its plans to
encourage market making.  The bourse is starting its market-making program, in which
broker-dealer firms will enter bid and offer prices on specified
stocks to improve liquidity, on Sept. 18. Stocks that have
market makers assigned to them will have a price bandwidth
movement of 10 percent, instead of the current 5 percent,
Securities Africa Ltd. said in a note today.  “Brokers have been informed of the new limit which is
intended to make market making function properly, as widening
the price band will enable market makers to recoup investments
in stocks, cover risk and remain in business,” David Adonri,
chief executive officer of Lagos-based Lambeth Trust and
Investment Co., said by phone today.  The NSE is sub-Saharan  Africa ’s second-biggest bourse after
 South Africa ’s.  To contact the reporter on this story:
