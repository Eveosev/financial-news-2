Serbia’s supplementary budget to be
unveiled next week will achieve an extra 1 billion euros ($1.26
billion) benefit by raising taxes and cutting spending, the
government said.  About half the saving will come from austerity measures and
the rest from “minimal tax increases,” Prime Minister  Ivica
Dacic  said, according to a statement on the government  web site .  “We must avoid a budget blockade, to make sure that there
is enough money for pensions and wages,” as well as debt
servicing “in order to avoid falling into a debt crisis,”
Dacic said.  The draft budget will be presented to parliament on Sept.
10 to be followed by laws that include lifting 130 levies and
other fees that burden businesses as the authorities aim to spur
economic growth, according to the prime minister.  “Short term, it is important that Serbia survives and to
ensure fiscal consolidation, because the budget gap in the first
six months is 7 percent” of gross domestic product, while the
public debt may near 60 percent of GDP by the end of the year,
Dacic said.  Serbia ’s own fiscal rules require that the public debt must
not exceed 45 percent of GDP.  To contact the reporter on this story:
