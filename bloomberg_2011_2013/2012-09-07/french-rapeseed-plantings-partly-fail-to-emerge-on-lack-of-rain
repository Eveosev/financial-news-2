French rapeseed plantings partly
failed to emerge after late sowing, hot weather in August and
lack of rain hampered crop development, according to industry
researcher Cetiom.  A third of the seeded crop has come up, with the remainder
yet to emerge, the Paris-based researcher wrote in an online
 report  today.  France  is the European Union’s largest grower of the
oilseed. The country had a dry and hot August, with above-normal
temperatures and rainfall 18 percent below the usual amount for
the month, the  Agriculture Ministry  said yesterday.  “The late harvests, the heat wave in August and the lack
of significant rain are disrupting the implantation of
rapeseed,” Cetiom wrote. “The quality of the seed bed,
mediocre, isn’t favorable for rapeseed sprouting, all the more
in the context of weak rains.”  Planting of spring barley this year to replace crops killed
by frost left soils very dry, Cetiom wrote. Clods are difficult
to break in clay soils and the dry conditions are raising
questions about the effectiveness of pesticides, according to
the report.  The optimal planting period for rapeseed has passed and
“several days” remain to sow the crop, the researcher wrote.  “In all cases, it’s too early to decide to change crops
because nothing has been lost at this point,” Cetiom wrote.
“Sowing in dry soil doesn’t have to be a brake on implantation.
After sowing in dry soil, weak rains of 10 millimeters (0.39
inch) are sufficient for correct rapeseed emergence, provided
the soil isn’t too cloddy.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
