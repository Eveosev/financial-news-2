Daimler AG (DAI) ’s Mercedes-Benz unit won
a U.S. lawsuit that accused the carmaker of infringing a patent
for a monitor to detect when a motorist is drowsy.  The patent, owned by licensing company Ibormeith IP LLC, is
invalid, U.S. District Judge Faith Hochberg ruled Sept. 5 in
federal court in  Newark ,  New Jersey . She said the patent owner
never clearly described what the invention claimed to cover.  The lawsuit, filed in October 2010, targeted the Mercedes
 Attention Assist  feature used in the E-Class and some S-Class
vehicles. The feature monitors a driver’s behavior at the start
of a trip and develops a profile for comparison throughout the
journey. If the pattern alters, an alarm is sounded suggesting
the driver take a break.  Patent law requires inventors to describe, in definite
terms, the scope of their invention, much like a landowner must
explain his property borders so others know where to avoid.  While the Ibormeith patent claims to cover an algorithm to
compute the changes in a driver, it “fails to disclose the
steps necessary to actually perform that suggested algorithm,”
Hochberg ruled.  Patents are rarely ruled indefinite, according to a
statement today by Shearman & Sterling LLP, the  law firm  that
represented Stuttgart, Germany-based Daimler in the case.  The case is Ibormeith LLC v. Mercedes-Benz USA LLC, 10-cv-
5378, U.S. District Court, District of New Jersey (Newark).  To contact the reporters on this story:
