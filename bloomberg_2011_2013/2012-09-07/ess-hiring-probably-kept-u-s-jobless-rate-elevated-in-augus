Payrolls probably rose at a slower pace in August, keeping unemployment in the U.S. above 8 percent for a 43rd month, economists said before a report today.  An additional 130,000 workers were taken on last month following a 163,000 increase in July, according to the median forecast of 92 economists surveyed by Bloomberg. The jobless rate may have held at 8.3 percent, the survey showed.  Employers may be reluctant to expand headcounts as they face a global economic slowdown and the so-called fiscal cliff of automatic tax increases and government spending cuts. The damage inflicted by the lack of progress on jobs is the reason Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  last week made the case for further easing.  “Hiring will be held in check by the tremendous amount of uncertainty this year,” said  Michael Moran , chief economist at Daiwa Capital Markets America Inc. in  New York , whose payroll forecast matched the survey median. “The Fed will take some action to spur the economy, they’ll want to be visible.”  The Labor Department’s report is due at 8:30 a.m. in Washington. Bloomberg survey employment estimates ranged from increases of 70,000 to 185,000.  Private employment, which excludes government jobs, climbed 142,000 after rising 172,000 in July, economists forecast the report will show.  Reports yesterday helped ease concern the labor market was weakening further. The number of claims for  jobless benefits  last week dropped to a one-month low, according to figures from the Labor Department. Data from Roseland, New Jersey-based ADP Employer Services showed companies expanded payrolls by 201,000 workers last month.  Shares Surge  Stocks jumped yesterday on the reports and on news that policy makers at the  European Central Bank  agreed to an unlimited bond-purchase program as they try to regain control of  interest rates  in the euro area. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 2 percent to close at 1,432.12, the highest level since January 2008.  American Axle & Manufacturing Holdings Inc. (AXL) , a maker of axles and crankshafts, is among companies looking to expand as the  auto industry  rebounds. The Detroit-based company plans to hire 400 to 500 workers at its Three Rivers,  Michigan , factory over the next two years, David Tworek, a spokesman, said in an e-mail last month.  Others are looking to pull back.  Mountain View , California- based  Google Inc. (GOOG)  said on Aug. 13 it will cut about 4,000 positions at its Motorola Mobility Holdings Inc. unit, with about one-third of the reductions coming in the U.S. Printer maker  Lexmark International Inc. (LXK)  on Aug. 28 announced plans to eliminate 1,700 jobs globally.  Recession’s Damage  Payroll gains slowed from an average 226,000 in the first quarter to 73,000 in the April to June period, before picking up in July. So far, it has taken the U.S. three years to recover about half, or 4 million, of the 8.8 million jobs lost as a result of the 18-month recession that ended in June 2009.  The  unemployment rate , derived from a separate Labor Department survey of households, has exceeded 8 percent since February 2009, the longest stretch in monthly records going back to 1948.  Bernanke in an Aug. 31 speech in  Jackson Hole ,  Wyoming , cited “the daunting economic challenges” that confront the U.S. He also said the Fed will provide additional policy stimulus as needed to promote a stronger economic recovery.  “The stagnation of the labor market in particular is a grave concern,” he said. Persistently high unemployment “will wreak structural damage on our economy that could last for many years.”  Employment and the economy are central themes in the presidential campaign, with President  Barack Obama  and Republican challenger  Mitt Romney  each trying to convince voters they can best energize the expansion and create jobs.
