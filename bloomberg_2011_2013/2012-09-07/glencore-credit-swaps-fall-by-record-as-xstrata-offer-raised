The cost of insuring against default
on Glencore International Plc’s bonds fell by a record after the
commodities trader raised its offer for mining company Xstrata
Plc in an effort to salvage its takeover.  Credit-default swaps on Glencore dropped 80 basis points to
241, the lowest since March 5, and the biggest daily decrease
since Bloomberg began compiling data in 2005. Contracts on
Xstrata fell 42 basis points to 142, the biggest drop since data
began in 2007.  Glencore, owner of 34 percent of Xstrata, increased its
all-stock offer to 3.05 of its shares for each one in its target
from 2.8, and proposed that its Chief Executive Officer Ivan
Glasenberg holds the role in the combined group rather than
Xstrata’s CEO Mick Davis. The revised terms were meant to
overcome opposition from Xstrata investors including Qatar
Holding LLC and Knight Vinke Asset Management LLC.  “If the deal happens it’s certainly good for Glencore
bonds and for Xstrata it’s mildly positive,” said Michael Ridley, a credit analyst at Mizuho International Plc in  London .  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($12.7 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer
face value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
