U.S. stock futures remained higher,
while the dollar slid and Treasuries and gold  advanced , as
weaker-than-forecast growth in American payrolls spurred bets
the  Federal Reserve  will undertake more monetary stimulus.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index expiring this
month were up 0.4 percent at 1,436.2 as of 8:49 a.m. in New York
after the benchmark gauge yesterday surged to the highest level
since January 2008. The Dollar Index, a gauge of the currency
against six major peers, slid 0.8 percent to the lowest level
since May. Ten-year Treasury yields fell six basis points to
1.62 percent and gold futures added 1.3 percent to $1,728.40 an
ounce, the highest since March.  The economy added 96,000 workers last month following a
revised 141,000 rise in July that was smaller than initially
estimated, Labor Department figures showed today in  Washington .
The median estimate of 92 economists surveyed by Bloomberg
called for a gain of 130,000. Unemployment unexpectedly fell to
8.1 percent as more Americans left the workforce, and hourly
earnings were unchanged.  “It’s a disappointing report across the board and it puts
the Fed in the driver's seat for additional quantitative
easing,” said Chad Morganlander, a  Florham Park , New Jersey-
based  fund manager  at Stifel Nicolaus & Co., which oversees
about $120 billion of assets. “It’s not a negative number, but
there is very little vibrancy to the report and the trend is
dismal. It lacks the get-up-and-go that we need to get the
economy moving again.”  While the  S&P 500  in August reached its highest level on an
intraday basis since 2008, yesterday was the first time it
closed at a multi-year high since April.  The index has risen almost 14 percent this year as European
leaders worked to tame the region’s debt crisis and the Federal
Reserve vowed to safeguard the economic recovery. Fed Chairman
 Ben S. Bernanke  said in  Jackson Hole , Wyoming, last week he
wouldn’t rule out more stimulus to help bolster an employment
market he described as “a grave concern.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
