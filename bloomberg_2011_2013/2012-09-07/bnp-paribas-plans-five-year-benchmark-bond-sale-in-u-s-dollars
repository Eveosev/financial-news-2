BNP Paribas SA (BNP) , France’s largest

percent, five-year notes that paid a relative yield of 135 basis
points to benchmarks, Bloomberg data show.  Those securities traded at 105.1 cents on the dollar Sept.
5 to yield 2.1 percent, according to Trace, the bond-price
reporting system of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.
