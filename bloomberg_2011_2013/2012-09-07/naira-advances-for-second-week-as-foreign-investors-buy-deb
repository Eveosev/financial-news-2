Nigeria ’s naira advanced against the
dollar, heading for its second weekly gain, after inflows into
the West African nation’s debt markets.  The currency of  Africa ’s biggest oil producer climbed 0.2
percent to 157.64 a dollar as of 1:01 p.m. in Lagos, the
commercial capital, taking its weekly rally to 0.3 percent. The
naira has risen 3 percent this year, the best performer in
Africa, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Treasury bill yields declined to the lowest in more than
three months at a Sept. 5 auction as investors bid for three
times the 142.9 billion naira ($905 million) on offer, the
central bank said yesterday. JPMorgan Chase & Co. said last
month that it is considering adding the West African nation’s
debt into its government bond emerging-market index series.  “Strong offshore institutional inflows for naira debt
purchases are adding to foreign exchange supply in the  interbank
market ,” Gregory Kronsten, head of economic research at FBN
Capital Ltd. in  London , wrote in an e-mailed note today. “This
has brought exchange-rate stability for now as sought by” the
central bank, he wrote.  Nigerian benchmark Bonny Light crude increased 0.7 percent
to $114.29 per barrel and has gained 26 percent since a June low
this year. The country’s  foreign-exchange reserves  reached a
more than two-year high of $39.2 billion, according to Sept. 3
data compiled by the Abuja-based central bank.  The yield on Nigeria’s 7 percent domestic bonds due October
2019 fell five basis points to 13.82 percent, according to
yesterday’s data on the Financial Markets Dealers Association
website. Yields on the nation’s $500 million of Eurobonds due
January 2021 rose less than one basis point to 4.87 percent
today.  Ghana ’s cedi climbed for a third day, increasing 0.5
percent to 1.9175 a dollar in Accra, the capital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
