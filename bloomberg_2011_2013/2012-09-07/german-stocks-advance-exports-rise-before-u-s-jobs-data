German stocks  advanced to their
highest in more than a year, extending yesterday’s surge, as
exports and industrial production unexpectedly rose in July.  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  and  Commerzbank AG (CBK) , Germany’s two largest
lenders, rose at least 5 percent each.  Bayerische Motoren Werke
AG (BMW)  climbed 1.4 percent.  Deutsche Post AG (DPW)  sank 3.6 percent as KfW
Group sold a 5 percent stake in  Europe ’s largest mail carrier.  The DAX rose 0.7 percent to 7,214.50 at the close of
trading in  Frankfurt , the highest level since July 27, 2011. The
gauge jumped the most in a month yesterday after European
Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  said policy makers agreed to
an unlimited bond-buying program to regain control of  interest
rates  in the region and stem the debt crisis. The broader HDAX
Index advanced 0.6 percent today.  “After Mario Draghi delivered yesterday, we saw a new buy
trading signal and that is confirmed today,” said Petra Grafin von Kerssenbrock, a technical analyst at Commerzbank in
Frankfurt. “The potential of this trading buy signal is 7,250
to 7,300. We could have highs that lead to the 7,600 level. The
discount from the banks and insurance sectors is being worked
out of prices, and the positive sentiment remains intact.”  The volume of shares changing hands on the  DAX (DAX)  was more
than twice the average of the last 30 days, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Exports Rise  German exports , adjusted for work days and seasonal
changes, increased 0.5 percent from June, when they fell 1.4
percent, the Federal Statistics Office in Wiesbaden said today.
Economists had forecast a 0.5 percent decline, according to the
median of 12 estimates in a Bloomberg News  survey . Imports
gained 0.9 percent from June.  Industrial production unexpectedly rose in July as output
of investment goods increased. Production rose 1.3 percent from
June, when it fell a revised 0.4 percent, the Economy Ministry
in Berlin said today. Economists forecast unchanged production,
the median of 39 estimates in a  Bloomberg News survey  showed.  U.S. payrolls rose less than projected in August and the
 unemployment rate  declined as more Americans left the  labor
force , indicating the labor market is stagnating.  The economy added 96,000 workers last month following a
revised 141,000 rise in July that was smaller than initially
estimated, Labor Department figures showed today in  Washington .
The median estimate of 92 economists surveyed by Bloomberg
called for a gain of 130,000. Unemployment unexpectedly fell to
8.1 percent, and hourly earnings were unchanged.  Banks Gain  Deutsche Bank rose 5.3 percent to 31.36 euros. Commerzbank
added 6.7 percent to 1.39 euros. A gauge of banking stocks
posted the second-biggest gain of the 19 industry groups in the
Stoxx 600 Europe Index.  BMW, the largest maker of luxury cars, gained 1.4 percent
to 58.03 euros.  Deutsche Boerse AG, which owns the Frankfurt stock exchange
and Clearstream, Europe’s second-biggest securities-settlement
company, advanced 4 percent to 42.43 euros. Clearstream said
that the value of customer assets it holds rose 3 percent to
11.2 trillion euros ($14.3 trillion) in August.  Deutz AG, an engine maker, jumped 7 percent to 3.30 euros.
Deutz spokesman Christian Krupp said that he had no knowledge of
rumors that the company may be taken over.  Deutsche Post slid 3.6 percent to 15.40 euros. Germany’s
state-owned development bank sold a 5 percent stake in the mail
carrier for 924 million euros. KfW sold 60 million shares for
15.40 euros per share, the Frankfurt-based lender said in a
statement today.  Continental AG (CON)  sank 1.4 percent to 80.92 euros. UBS AG cut
its recommendation on Europe’s second-largest auto-parts maker
to neutral from buy, saying further margin expansion is limited.
UBS also said the European Union auto-supplier sector is its
least preferred sub-category of the industry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
