A vacancy on the European Central
Bank’s Executive Board will go unfilled for at least another
month after lawmakers postponed consideration of the nominee,
Yves Mersch of  Luxembourg , to protest the absence of female
candidates.  The European Parliament put off a planned Sept. 10
 committee hearing  and Sept. 13 confirmation vote on Mersch
because there are no women on the ECB board, the parliament
said.  “There is now not even a single woman sitting on the main
board of what is one of the most powerful and essential
institutions in the EU,”  Sharon Bowles , head of the
parliament’s Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee, said in an
e-mailed statement in Brussels today. “The symbolic and
practical effects of this absence are not without note.”  The parliamentary objection is the first since the ECB was
set up in 1998. While lawmakers have no power to block ECB
appointments, their assent is necessary before central bank
candidates picked by euro-area governments can take office.  The ECB seat has been empty since Jose Manuel Gonzalez-
Paramo of  Spain  came to the end of his eight-year term on May
31. A battle between Spain and Luxembourg over the seat dragged
on until July when Mersch, 62, prevailed in a vote by euro
finance ministers.  Two women, Sirkka Haemaelaeinen of  Finland  and Gertrude
Tumpel-Gugerell of  Austria , have served on the ECB’s board. The
parliament’s next opportunity to vote on the appointment will be
in the week of Oct. 22.  To contact the reporter on this story:
