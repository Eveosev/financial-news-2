Three of  Morgan Stanley’s (MS)  gasoline
traders have quit the bank to join Mercuria Energy Trading SA,
according to four people with knowledge of the matter.  Leo Sint Nicolaas, Sebastian Ferraccu and Louis Mitchell
resigned from their posts in  London , according to the people,
who declined to be identified because the information hasn’t
been made public. They left this week, one of the people said.  Tom Walton, a spokesman for Morgan Stanley in London,
declined to comment by phone today. Geneva-based Mercuria didn’t
immediately respond to a voicemail message or an e-mail seeking
comment.  Mercuria hired staff for its energy business from other
banks earlier this year, including Roger Jones, former global
head of commodities and Phil Sutterby, a senior natural gas
trader at  Barclays Plc. (BARC)  Andrew Perkins joined the company from
Morgan Stanley this year to head its new global agriculture team
in  Singapore .  Morgan Stanley’s second-quarter net revenue from
commodities and fixed income sales and trading fell 59 percent
to $770 million from $1.9 billion a year earlier, the bank said
in a  statement  on July 19. The drop reflected “the challenging
global market environment with reduced levels of client
activity,” it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
