  Tornos Holding AG (TOHN)  rose as much as
2.9 percent after the Swiss maker of machines that produce
precision components  said  it’s cutting 225 jobs to save as much
as 35 million francs ($37 million).  The stock gained as much as 20 centimes to 7.05 francs.
Shares of the Moutier-based company, whose products help produce
Swiss watches, aircraft screws and medical devices, traded 0.7
percent higher at 6.90 francs at 9:37 a.m. in Zurich.  Tornos said it’s adapting to a shift in production to  China 
from  Europe  and to the debt crisis weighing on demand in
southern Europe, as well as the strong Swiss franc, which
reduces the value of sales from other countries. The company
said last month it wouldn’t break even at the level of earnings
before interest and taxes in 2012, after first-half orders
dropped 34 percent from a year earlier.  “Adapting the cost structure at Tornos seems to be the
only way to try to compete,” Michael Inauen, an analyst at
Zuercher Kantonalbank, wrote in a note to investors. He has a
market-perform recommendation on the stock.  To contact the reporter on this story:
