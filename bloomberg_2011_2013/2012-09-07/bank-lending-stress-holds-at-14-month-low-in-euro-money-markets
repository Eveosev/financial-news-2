European banks’ reluctance to lend
to one another held at the lowest in more than 14 months,
according to a money market indicator.  The difference between the euro interbank offered rate and
overnight indexed swaps, known as the Euribor-OIS spread, 18.5
basis points, or 0.185 percentage point, at 8:20 a.m. in  London ,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The gap is the smallest
since June 14, 2011.  The cost for European banks to borrow in dollars held at
the lowest since June 22, 2011. The three-month cross-currency
 basis swap , the rate banks pay to convert euro interest payments
into dollars, was unchanged at 26.5 basis points below Euribor.
The one-year basis swap was 31 basis points below Euribor from
minus 32.5 yesterday.  The European Banking Federation’s euro overnight index
average, or Eonia, of unsecured lending deals was set at 0.108
percent yesterday from 0.107 percent the day before. The Eonia
swap, an estimate of average overnight borrowing costs over the
next three months, rose 0.01 basis point to a one-month high of
8.1 basis points.  Lenders cut  overnight deposits  at the European Central Bank
yesterday, placing 342 billion euros ($433 billion) with the
Frankfurt-based central bank from 347 billion euros the day
before.  To contact the reporter on this story:
