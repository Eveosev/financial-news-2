India ’s 10-year bonds were poised
for the best week in a month on speculation the easing of a cash
squeeze at banks spurred demand.  Domestic lenders  borrowed  an average of 72.5 billion rupees
 ($1.3 billion) from the  Reserve Bank  of India this week via
repurchase contracts to meet shortages, compared with 478
billion rupees last week. The government has probably stepped up
spending to counter a weakness in economic growth, helping to
reduce the cash squeeze, according to Srinivasa Raghavan, an
executive vice president of treasury at Dhanlaxmi Bank Ltd.  “The drop in bond yields is a result of the easing of the
cash crunch,” said Mumbai-based Raghavan.  The yield on the 8.15 percent notes due June 2022 fell
seven basis points, or 0.07 percentage point, this week to 8.17
percent as of 10:03 a.m. in Mumbai, according to the central
bank’s trading system. The rate rose one basis point today.  India’s $1.8 trillion  economy  expanded 5.5 percent last
quarter, near the slowest pace since 2009 of 5.3 percent in the
previous three months, government data released last week show.  One-year  interest-rate swaps , or derivative contracts used
to guard against fluctuations in funding costs, fell five basis
points this week to 7.77 percent, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. They rose two basis points today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
