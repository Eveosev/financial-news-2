President  Barack Obama ’s job
approval reached a 15-month high during the Democratic National
Convention this week, according to a Gallup Poll.  The poll , conducted Sept. 4-6 and released today, found
that 52 percent of Americans approve of the president’s job
performance, up 3 percentage points from the previous survey,
conducted Sept. 3-5. In the latest poll, 43 percent disapproved
of the job Obama is doing, down from 45 percent.  Obama’s job approval hadn’t topped 50 percent in the Gallup
survey since a poll conducted June 21-23. The latest approval
numbers are the president’s highest since a survey conducted May
29-June 1, 2011, in which Obama registered a 53 percent approval
rating.  The bump in Obama’s rating coincides with his party’s
nominating convention in  Charlotte ,  North Carolina , this week.
Obama accepted the Democratic presidential nomination in a
speech last night before heading to a campaign event today in
 New Hampshire  where he discussed an unexpected slowdown in
August job growth that could temper his momentum from the
convention.  The poll released today has a margin of error of plus or
minus 3 percentage points and is based on telephone interviews
with about 1,500 adults.  Republican nominee  Mitt Romney  got no “bounce” in his
poll standings from the  Republican National Convention  in Tampa,
Florida, Aug. 28-30,  Gallup reported  Sept. 4.  Since 1964, Gallup has measured such a post-convention
improvement in polls for every major-party candidate except
Democrats George McGovern in 1972 and  John Kerry  in 2004.  Unemployment Reaction  The Labor Department reported today that the economy added
96,000 jobs in August, down from a revised gain of 141,000 in
July. While the  unemployment rate  fell to 8.1 percent from 8.3
percent in July, that resulted from more people giving up
looking for work.  “We know it’s not good enough,” Obama said today during
the event in Portsmouth, New Hampshire. “We need to create jobs
faster.”  Romney seized on the jobs numbers when he landed in Iowa
for a campaign event in Orange City. The employment report shows
Obama’s policies aren’t working, Romney said.  “The president has been unable to deliver on virtually any
of the promises he made four years ago,” Romney said.  The race between Obama and Romney remains too close to call
coming out of the conventions, Gallup said today. In Gallup’s
 latest poll , conducted Aug. 31-Sept. 6, 48 percent of voters
said they would support Obama if the election were held today,
compared with 45 percent who said they would back Romney.  Essentially Tied  While that represents a slight numerical shift toward Obama
-- the breakdown was 47 percent for Obama and 46 percent for
Romney in a survey conducted Aug. 30-Sept. 5 -- the race remains
essentially tied given that the poll had a margin of error of
plus-or-minus 2 percentage points.  The median post-convention bounce for a presidential
candidate among registered voters is 5 percentage points, and
the average is 6 percentage points, according to Gallup data for
presidential elections from 1964 to 2008.  The biggest bounce was a 16-point lift for  Bill Clinton 
after the 1992 convention that presaged his victory over  George
H.W. Bush  that November. Following their 2008 conventions, Obama
experienced a 4-point boost and  John McCain  rose by 6 points,
Gallup data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
