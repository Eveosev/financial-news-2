The U.S. and  Canada  signed an accord
to protect the  Great Lakes , agreeing to curb pollutants and
limit the infestation of invasive species.  The agreement, signed in Washington today by the top
environmental officials of each country, updates pledges between
the two nations first made in 1972 to protect the world’s
largest freshwater system.  “Protecting cherished water bodies like the Great Lakes is
not only about environmental conservation,”  Lisa Jackson , the
administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, said
in a statement. “It’s also about protecting the health of the
families -- and the economies -- of the local communities that
depend on those water bodies for so much, every day.”  The new  provisions  set goals for each country to address
aquatic invasive species such as the Asian carp; curb phosphorus
run-off, which can contribute to algae blooms; and cut toxic
chemicals pollution from industry and vessels. Each nation will
now need to come up with the financing and policies to implement
their “common objectives,” according to the agreement.  The Great Lakes -- Erie, Huron, Michigan, Superior and
Ontario -- account for 80 percent of the lake and river water in
 North America , draining a basin that covers 295,700 square miles
(766,000 square kilometers), according to a joint government
 report  on the region.  To contact the reporter on this story:
