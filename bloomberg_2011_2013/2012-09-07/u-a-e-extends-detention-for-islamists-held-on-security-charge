A court in the  United Arab Emirates 
has extended the detention of Islamists who were arrested on
charges of threatening national security, according to a local
activist and blogger.  Six detainees appeared before a judge yesterday in the
country’s  Supreme Court  to have their custody extended, Ahmed
Mansoor said by e-mail. A similar ruling was given the day
before in the case of another five suspects, he said.  U.A.E. authorities said last month they have arrested more
than 50 Islamists who were conspiring against the state and
allegedly had links to “external elements.” Most of those
detained belong to a domestic Islamic group known as al-Islah.  Anwar Gargash, the minister for foreign affairs, said on
Aug. 26 that the so-called Arab Spring has emboldened Islamist
groups in the region.  To contact the reporters on this story:
