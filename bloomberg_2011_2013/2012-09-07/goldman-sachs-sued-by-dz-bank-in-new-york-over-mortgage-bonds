Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  was sued by
German lender  DZ Bank  AG over $188.6 million in mortgage-backed
securities, at least the third investor this week to sue the
bank over mortgage bonds.  Goldman Sachs made material misrepresentations about loans
that were bundled into the securities, DZ Bank said in a filing
today in New York State Supreme Court. The claims include fraud
and negligent misrepresentation, the lender said.  Two other German lenders --  IKB Deutsche Industriebank AG (IKB) 
and Bayerische Landesbank -- are suing New York-based Goldman
Sachs over losses on mortgage bonds, according to filings this
week in state supreme court.  Michael DuVally , a spokesman for Goldman Sachs, declined to
comment.  The case is Deutsche Zentral-Genossenschaftsbank AG v.
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., 653134-2012, New York State Supreme
Court, New York County (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
