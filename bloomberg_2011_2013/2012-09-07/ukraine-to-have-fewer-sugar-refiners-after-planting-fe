The number of sugar refiners in
Ukraine processing beets harvested in 2012 will retreat after
planting declined, the  Agriculture Ministry  said.  The ministry expects 70 facilities to process between 15.7
million and 16.2 million metric tons of beets this year,
according to a statement on its website today. Seventy-five
refiners operated last year, according to Ukrtsukor, the
country’s sugar producers’ association.  Beet areas declined by about 13 percent to 466,300 hectares
(1.15 million acres), compared with 538,300 hectares a year
earlier, according to the state statistics office data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
