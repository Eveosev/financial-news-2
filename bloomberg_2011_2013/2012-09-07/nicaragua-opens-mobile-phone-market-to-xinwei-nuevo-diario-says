Nicaragua  will allow China’s Xinwei
Telecom Enterprise Group to compete against two other mobile-
phone providers in the Central American nation, El Nuevo Diario
said.  The privately-held Xinwei may invest $300 million in the
first two years and as much as $800 million in total for
Internet and mobile-phone service rights, the Managua-based
newspaper  reported  today, citing Orlando Castillo, president of
Nicaragua’s telecommunication regulating agency.  America Movil SAB, Mexico’s largest wireless provider, and
Spain’s  Telefonica (TEF)  SA also provide mobile phone service in
Nicaragua, El Nuevo Diario said. Nicaragua has six million
mobile phones in use, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
