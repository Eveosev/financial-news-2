Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) , the world’s largest
online retailer, will hire 2,000 people in the U.K. in the next
two years as it adds new offices and expands its presence in the
country.  The company opened a fulfillment center in Hemel Hempstead,
England, that will account for 600 permanent jobs, Amazon said
in a statement. An additional 3,000 temporary posts will be
created for the Christmas season when orders peak.  “This is great news, not only for those individuals who
will find work, but for the U.K. economy,” British Prime
Minister  David Cameron  said in a statement.  Chief Executive Officer  Jeff Bezos  plans to open 18
fulfillment centers this year to speed deliveries and help
Seattle, Washington-based Amazon siphon shoppers from physical
stores. The investment has taken a toll on earnings and Amazon
said in July it expects a third-quarter operating loss of as
much as $350 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
