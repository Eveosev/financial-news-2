Questcor Pharmaceuticals Inc. (QCOR) 
climbed to its highest value in almost two months after the
drugmaker said shipments of its Acthar multiple sclerosis
injection rose 33 percent last month.  Questcor rose 3.3 percent to $51.97 at 4 p.m. New York
time, its highest closing price since July 9.  Shipments of Acthar climbed to 2,190 vials in August, 540
more than a month earlier, the company said in a regulatory
filing today. Acthar is approved for treating multiple sclerosis
relapses, infantile spasms and damaged kidneys.  “We would be buying Questcor related to these Acthar
numbers,” said Marko Kozul, a San Francisco-based analyst for
Leerink Swann, in a note to investors today. The shipping trends
were ahead of estimates and suggests a strong third quarter, he
wrote.  Kozul reiterated his outperform rating and a valuation of
$55 to $58.  To contact the reporter on this story:
