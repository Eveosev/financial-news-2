Treasuries fell for a fourth day as
investors awaited a monthly U.S. payroll report after industry
data yesterday showed companies hired more workers in July than
economists forecast.  Benchmark  10-year yields  headed for their biggest weekly
increase in three months as a European Central Bank plan to buy
euro-area  government bonds  to contain the region’s debt crisis
spurred a rally in stocks around the world. German bunds also
declined while Spanish and Italian bonds led gains among the
securities of Europe’s most highly indebted nations.  “Yields of high-grade government bonds are rising because
of constructive  market sentiment , which was triggered by the
ECB’s announcement,” said  Michael Leister , a fixed-income
strategist at Commerzbank AG in London. “There is room for an
upside surprise on U.S. jobs data today. It will be a volatile
market into the non-farm payroll report.”  The U.S.  10-year yield  climbed five basis points, or 0.05
percentage point, to 1.73 percent at 6:51 a.m. in  New York  after
rising to 1.74 percent, the highest level since Aug. 22. The
1.625 percent  note  due in August 2022 dropped 15/32, or $4.69
per $1,000 face amount, to 99 1/32. The yield climbed 18 basis
points this week, the most since the period ended June 8.  U.S. employers hired 130,000 workers last month, after
adding 163,000 in July, according to a Bloomberg News survey
before today’s Labor Department report. Companies created
201,000 jobs in August, ADP Employer Services said yesterday,
exceeding the 140,000 gain predicted by economists in a separate
Bloomberg survey.  Fed Meeting  The policy-setting  Federal Open Market Committee  meets
Sept. 12-13. Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said on Aug. 31 at a
conference in  Jackson Hole ,  Wyoming , that the costs of
“nontraditional policies” appeared manageable when considered
carefully. He said he wouldn’t rule out steps to lower a jobless
rate he described as a “grave concern.”  “Whether the Fed chooses to use this firepower again next
week will depend on a careful assessment of the costs as well as
benefits,” Deutsche Bank AG analysts including chief economist
 Peter Hooper  in New York, wrote in an e-mailed note. “Because
the economic picture is still improving, at least modestly, we
feel that the Fed should and probably will limit its actions
next week to verbal easing.”  The U.S. central bank has kept its  benchmark   interest rate 
in a range of zero to 0.25 percent since December 2008 and has
pledged to maintain that level through late 2014. The Fed has
purchased $2.3 trillion of bonds from 2008 to 2011 in two rounds
of so-called quantitative easing to stimulate the economy
through lower borrowing costs.  ‘Higher Chance’  “Our main scenario envisages a higher chance that the Fed
will extend its low-rate commitment,” said Shinichiro Kadota, a
strategist at Barclays Plc in  Tokyo . “If the Fed extends the
pledge to mid- or end-2015, it will weigh on short-term yields
up to five years.”  The ECB’s bond-buying plan will focus on government notes
with maturities of one to three years, Draghi said yesterday at
the central bank’s policy meeting in  Frankfurt . The ECB will
only intervene in the secondary market if a country has asked
Europe’s bailout fund to buy its debt, ensuring strict
conditions are agreed to, he said.  The Stoxx Europe 600  Index (SXXP)  of shares gained 0.4 percent and
the euro strengthened 0.6 percent to $1.2699. Germany’s 10-year
bund yield climbed six basis points to 1.62 percent, while
Spanish  10-year yields  dropped below 6 percent for the first
time in four months.  Volatility Index  Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s  MOVE index , which measures
price swings based on Treasury options, climbed to 71 basis
points yesterday, the highest since Aug. 17. The average over
the past five years is 112.  The U.S. central bank is  scheduled  to sell as much as $8
billion of Treasuries today due from February 2013 to February
2014 as part of so-called Operation Twist, a program to swap
shorter-term securities in the Fed’s holdings with longer-term
debt to put downward pressure on borrowing costs.  The Treasury will auction $32 billion of three-year notes
on Sept. 11, $21 billion of 10-year debt the next day and $13
billion of 30-year bonds on Sept. 13.  To contact the reporter on this story:
