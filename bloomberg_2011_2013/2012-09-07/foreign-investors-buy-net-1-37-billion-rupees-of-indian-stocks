Overseas  investors  bought a net  1.37
billion rupees  of Indian stocks yesterday, raising their
investment in the equities this year to 631.7 billion rupees, or
$12.3 billion, according to the nation’s market regulator.  Foreigners bought 17.7 billion rupees of shares and sold
16.3 billion rupees, the Securities & Exchange Board of India
said on its  website  today. They purchased a net 106.1 billion
rupees of stocks last month.  Offshore funds sold a net 9.01 billion rupees of bonds
yesterday, reducing their inflow into debt this year to 229.8
billion rupees, the data  show .  The benchmark  BSE India Sensitive Index (SENSEX)  has increased 14
percent this year, helped by the biggest overseas equity flows
among 10 Asian markets tracked by Bloomberg. Flows surged to a
record in 2010, making the Sensex the best performer among the
world’s top 10 markets. The largest-ever outflow in 2008 led to
the biggest annual slump of 52 percent.  Foreigners have invested 5.076 trillion rupees in stocks
and 1.437 trillion rupees in bonds since they were allowed into
the country in 1993.  The regulator provides data on shares bought and sold by
large investors, including trades in the primary and secondary
markets, with a delay of at least a day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
