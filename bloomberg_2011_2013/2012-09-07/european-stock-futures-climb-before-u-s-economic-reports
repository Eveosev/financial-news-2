European stocks climbed, completing
their biggest weekly rally in three months, on speculation that
the  Federal Reserve  will opt for further stimulus after a report
showed U.S. employers hired fewer workers than estimated.  Banks contributed the most to the Stoxx Europe 600 Index’s
advance as  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  and  Barclays Plc (BARC)  each climbed more
than 5 percent. Xstrata Plc jumped 3.6 percent after  Glencore
International Plc (GLEN)  increased its offer for the mining company led
by  Mick Davis .  Solvay SA (SOLB)  climbed 3.3 percent after NYSE Euronext
said it will join France’s CAC 40 Index.  The Stoxx 600 advanced 0.2 percent to 272.3 at the close,
after earlier rising as much as 0.8 percent. The gauge has
gained 2.3 percent this week as European Central Bank President
 Mario Draghi  said yesterday that policy makers agreed on a plan
to buy unlimited government debt.  “The Fed’s not going to be happy with the payrolls numbers
and will probably look for a way to stimulate the economy,”
said  Mike Lenhoff , chief strategist at Brewin Dolphin Securities
Ltd. in London, in a phone interview. “It’s a win-win for the
markets: if the numbers were good, it would’ve meant the economy
is improving. Now the numbers are bad, the Fed might do
something about it. Markets are also rallying because of the
positive developments in Europe.”  In the U.S., a Labor Department report showed that
employers hired 96,000 workers in August, down from a revised
141,000 in July. Economists had forecast that the world’s
largest economy added 130,000 workers last month.  U.S. Unemployment  The release also showed that the nation’s unemployment rate
unexpectedly slipped to 8.1 percent. Economists had predicted a
jobless rate of 8.3 percent, according to the median projection
in a Bloomberg News survey. Unemployment has stayed above 8
percent for the last 43 months.  The Stoxx 600 posted its biggest weekly gain since the
beginning of June after Draghi said yesterday that the ECB has
approved his bond-buying plan. The central bank will target
government securities with maturities of one to three years,
Draghi said. Purchases will be fully sterilized to ensure a
neutral impact on  money supply , and the ECB will not have
seniority, he said.  The volume of shares changing hands on the Stoxx 600 today
was double the average of the last 30 days, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  The  VStoxx Index (V2X) , which measures the cost of option prices
on the Euro Stoxx 50 Index, dropped for a third day, declining
5.6 percent to 21.83. The gauge tumbled 16 percent yesterday,
its largest slide since October last year.  China Infrastructure  China has approved plans to build 2,018 kilometers of
roads, according to statements on the National Development and
Reform Commission’s website. The state endorsed the projects in
the June-August period. A Sept. 5 statement showed the
government also gave the go ahead for plans to build subways in
18 Chinese cities, as it seeks to revive economic growth.  National benchmark indexes climbed in every western-
 European (SXXP)  market except Denmark today. The U.K.’s FTSE 100 added
0.3 percent, while Germany’s DAX advanced 0.7 percent. France’s
CAC 40 rose 0.3 percent.  A gauge of banking shares advanced 2.1 percent to its
highest level in five months. Deutsche Bank and Barclays surged
5.3 percent to 31.36 euros and 6.9 percent to 206.4 pence,
respectively.  Banks Rally  Santander SA,  Spain’s biggest lender , climbed 1.7 percent
to 6.08 euros, while  BNP Paribas SA (BNP) ,  France’s largest bank ,
added 1.7 percent to 37.78 euros.  Credit Agricole SA (ACA)  and  Societe
Generale SA (GLE)  jumped 6.5 percent to 5.34 euros and 6.8 percent to
24.49 euros, respectively.  Italy’s  Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena SpA (BMPS)  surged 11
percent to 26.4 euro cents, while Portugal’s  Banco Espirito
Santo SA (BES)  soared 8 percent to 66.2 cents.  Xstrata (XTA)  gained 3.6 percent to 1,014 pence, while Glencore
slumped 3.6 percent to 378.1 pence. The commodities trader,
which owns 34 percent of Xstrata, offered 3.05 of its shares for
every one that its target’s investors hold, according to a
statement from Zug, Switzerland-based Xstrata. Glencore’s Chief
Executive Officer, Ivan Glasenberg, will become CEO of the
combined group. Under the previous offer, Xstrata’s Davis would
have taken on the position.  Rio Tinto Group climbed 6.2 percent to 3,021 pence for the
biggest contribution to the Stoxx 600’s advance.  Solvay gained 3.3 percent to 91.79 euros after NYSE
Euronext said late yesterday that the maker of chemicals and
plastics will replace PSA Peugeot Citroen in the  CAC 40 (CAC)  from
Sept. 24.  Meggitt Plc (MGGT)  added 1.6 percent to 407.3 pence after
Citigroup Inc. raised its recommendation on the shares to buy
from neutral. The brokerage said that other companies may find
Meggitt an attractive takeover target.  Neopost SA (NEO)  slumped 8 percent to 38.99 euros, its biggest
drop since October 2007. The company late yesterday posted

exchange rates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
