Unga Group Ltd. (UNGL) , a Kenyan grain
miller, rose the highest in almost two years on speculation that
the company will increase its dividend payment.  The stock advanced 3 percent to 13.60 shillings by 11:16
a.m. in Nairobi, the capital, the highest since October 2010,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “There is expectation of better performance which may see
the dividend payment raised to as much as 1 shilling from last
year’s 0.75 shillings,” Eric Musau, a research analyst at
Nairobi-based Standard Investment Bank Ltd., said by phone
today. “The strengthening of the shilling has also lowered its
foreign-exchange exposure especially for imported grains.”  Net income for the six months to Dec. 31 rose to 149
million shillings ($1.76 million) from 146.7 million shillings
with sales climbing to 8.42 billion shillings from 6.26 billion
shillings a year earlier, it said on March 1. The Kenyan
shilling has advanced 6.1 percent against the dollar from June
30, 2011, to the end of June this year, the best-performing
currency in  Africa .  To contact the reporter on this story:
