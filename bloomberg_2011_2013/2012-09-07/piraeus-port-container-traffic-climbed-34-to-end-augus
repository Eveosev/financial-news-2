Piraeus Port Authority SA (PPA) , which
operates  Greece ’s biggest port, said containers handled at its
Pier 1 facility in the eight months through Aug. 31 rose more
than 34 percent from a year earlier.  The pier handled 436,244 20-foot-equivalent units, up from
324,598 in the first eight months of 2011, the authority said in
a  statement  on its website late yesterday.  The port’s car terminal saw imports rise about 7 percent to
296,293 vehicles as an almost 20 percent increase in so-called
transit cars, which are destined for Balkan markets, offset a 41
percent drop in car imports destined for the Greek market,
according to the statement.  Greece may sell a stake in Piraeus Port as part of a
program of state asset sales. The harbor’s Pier II is run by
Piraeus Container Terminal SA, a unit of  Cosco Pacific Ltd. (1199) ,
which will also build a Pier III.  To contact the reporter on this story:
