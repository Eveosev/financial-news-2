Spanish Deputy Prime Minister Soraya Saenz de Santamaria said the government needs time to decide
whether to take a bailout as the nation’s business lobby urged
the government to accept help.  “This is a decision that can’t be made without considering
all the elements,” Saenz told reporters after a Cabinet meeting
in  Madrid  today. “It’s an issue on which the future of the
country and many Spaniards depends.”  Saenz called for “prudence” after Arturo Fernandez, the
vice chairman of business lobby CEOE, called on Prime Minister
 Mariano Rajoy  to decide quickly. He said in an interview with
Cope radio today that “time is running out” as the nation is
on the verge of bankruptcy.  Rajoy declined to comment yesterday on European Central
Bank President  Mario Draghi ’s proposal to buy bonds of cash-
strapped nations on the condition they make a formal request for
aid from the euro region’s government-run rescue funds. Rajoy,
who denied  Spain  would need a bailout for its banks two weeks
before seeking one in June, was meeting German Chancellor Angela Merkel yesterday as Draghi unveiled his plan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
