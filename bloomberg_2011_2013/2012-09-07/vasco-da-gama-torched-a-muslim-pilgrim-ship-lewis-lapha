Vasco da Gama is celebrated for
leading the first expedition to sail directly from  Europe  to
India in 1498. He was also a fierce Christian crusader.  (To listen to the podcast, click here.)  A subsequent voyage by a fleet of 15 heavily armed
Portuguese ships reached India in October 1502, and da Gama then
set about capturing Arab vessels.  The Miri was a pilgrim ship coming home from Mecca with
many of the wealthiest Calicut merchants on board. They tried to
negotiate their freedom with gold and spices but were refused.  Desperate Muslim women held up their infants and toddlers
and pleaded for mercy. After looting the ship, da Gama spared
only 17 children, who were forcibly baptized.  As screams rent the air, the Miri was then burned with the
rest of the 300 people on board, “very cruelly and without the
slightest pity,” according to one eyewitness.  I spoke with Nigel Cliff, author of “The Last Crusade: The
Epic Voyages of Vasco da Gama,” on the following topics:  1. Anti-Islam Sentiment  2. Open Spice Trade  3. Creating Enemies  4. Destruction of Miri  5. Freeing Asian Seas  To buy this book in  North America , click  here .  ( Lewis Lapham  is the founder of  Lapham’s Quarterly  and the
