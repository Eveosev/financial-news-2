U.S.  stocks  rose with gold and 10-
year Treasuries, while the dollar slid, as weaker-than-forecast
jobs growth spurred bets the  Federal Reserve  will undertake more
stimulus. The euro climbed as plans to contain the credit crisis
sent Spanish and Italian bonds higher.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index advanced 0.4 percent to
1,437.92, its highest level since January 2008, and the  Dow
Jones Industrial Average  closed at its best level since December
2007. Ten-year Treasury  yields  fell one basis point to 1.67
percent and gold futures increased 2 percent to $1,740.50 an
ounce, a six-month high. The  Dollar Index (DXY) , a gauge of the
currency against six major peers, slid 1.1 percent to the lowest
level since May as the euro rallied 1.4 percent to $1.2812.  America added 96,000 workers last month following a revised
141,000 increase in July that was smaller than first estimated,
trailing the median estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg
for a gain of 130,000. Unemployment unexpectedly fell to 8.1
percent as more Americans left the workforce, and hourly
earnings were unchanged. Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said last
week he wouldn’t rule out more stimulus to bolster a job market
he described as “a grave concern.”  “It’s a disappointing report across the board and it puts
the Fed in the driver’s seat for additional quantitative
easing,” said Chad Morganlander, a Florham Park, New Jersey-
based  fund manager  at Stifel Nicolaus & Co., which oversees
about $120 billion of assets. “It’s not a negative number, but
there is very little vibrancy to the report and the trend is
dismal. It lacks the get-up-and-go that we need to get the
economy moving again.”  Treasuries, Commodities  While today’s jobs data trailed forecasts, better-than-
projected reports over the past three months have pushed the
Citigroup Economic Surprise Index for the U.S. to an almost
five-month high. The index, which measures how much data is
beating or missing the median estimates in Bloomberg surveys,
climbed to 15 today after yesterday rising above zero for the
first time since April.  The  Federal Open Market Committee  meets next week to
discuss policy and will release a statement on Sept. 13 after a
two-day meeting. Bernanke told a gathering of central bankers in
 Jackson Hole ,  Wyoming , last week that the first two rounds of
quantitative easing through asset purchases have helped
stabilize the economy.  ‘Push and Pull’  “We have this push and pull between economic momentum and
and the policy response,”  Alan Gayle , a senior strategist at
RidgeWorth Capital Management in Richmond, Virginia, which
oversees about $47 billion, said in a telephone interview. “The
expectation is if the economic data is soft, then the Fed, the
 European Central Bank  and the Chinese will spend more money on
the policy front.”  The S&P 500 extended its weekly gain to 2.2 percent.
Trading of companies in the index was almost 21 percent above
the 30-day average and the volume of Dow stocks was 52 percent
higher as the 30-stock gauge increased 14.64 points to
13,306.64. More than three shares rose for every two that fell
in the U.S.  Producers of raw materials and energy advanced more than
1.6 percent for the biggest gains among the 10 industry groups
in the  S&P 500 , with Exxon Mobil Corp. jumping 1.1 percent and
Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. surging 8.5 percent to pace
the advance. Alpha Natural Resources Inc., a coal producer,
jumped 17 percent for the biggest gain in the S&P 500. Bank of
America Corp. added 5.4 percent, extending this week’s gain to
10 percent.  Google $700  Google Inc. climbed 1 percent to $706.15, topping $700 for
the first time since 2008.  Telephone and consumer-staples companies fell the most.
 Intel Corp ., the world’s largest semiconductor maker, tumbled
3.6 percent after cutting its third-quarter revenue forecast.  The S&P 500 surged 2 percent yesterday as the European
Central Bank announced plans for unlimited bond purchases to
stem the debt crisis. While the S&P 500 in August reached its
highest level on an intraday basis since 2008, yesterday was the
first time it closed at a multi-year high since April. The index
has risen 14 percent this year as European leaders worked to
tame the region’s debt crisis and the Fed vowed to safeguard the
economic recovery.  The $1.9 trillion restored to U.S. equity prices in 2012
has pushed the S&P 500 within 10 percent of a record, more than
7 percentage points closer than any country among the world’s
biggest stock markets. More gains are likely as bearish
investors give up and start buying, according to Laszlo Birinyi,
president of Birinyi Associates Inc. in Westport,  Connecticut .  ‘Join the Party’  “They realize it isn’t working,” Birinyi, an equity
trader for Salomon Brothers Inc. in the 1980s, said in a
telephone interview. “The excuses of no volume and earnings
aren’t going to be good -- that’s not happening, and maybe it’
time to join the party.”  Yields on 30-year Treasury bonds rose two basis points to
2.82 percent, erasing earlier declines, while two-year rates
lost one point to 0.25 percent. The dollar weakened against 15
of 16 major peers, losing at least 1.4 percent versus the South
African rand, Norwegian krone and Swedish krona.  Copper, zinc and silver jumped more than 3 percent to lead
the S&P GSCI Index of commodities up 0.7 percent. Copper gained
3.7 percent to $3.645 a pound, the highest since May 14, as
China approved plans to build 2,018 kilometers (1,254 miles) of
roads and other infrastructure programs, sending the Shanghai
Composite Index up 3.7 percent for its biggest rally in almost
eight months. The country is the largest buyer of copper.  European Markets  Ten-year Spanish yields tumbled 40 basis points to 5.63
percent and Italian rates lost 20 basis points to 5.06 percent,
the lowest since April for both, after ECB President  Mario Draghi  announced the bond-buying program for struggling nations
yesterday. Portugal’s bonds rose for a sixth straight week,
sending 10-year yields to 8.10 percent, the lowest in almost 18
months.  Two stocks gained for each that fell in the Stoxx 600. The
volume of shares changing hands on the Stoxx 600 was double the
average of the last 30 days, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
Banks and commodity producers led gains, with Portugal’s Banco
Espirito Santo SA surging 8 percent and Germany’s Commerzbank AG
rising 6.7 percent.  Xstrata Plc (XTA)  rallied 3.6 percent. Glencore International
Plc, the world’s biggest publicly traded commodities supplier,
raised its proposed takeover bid for the mining company.
Glencore shares fell 3.6 percent.  The euro climbed above 100 yen for the first time since
July 5 as the shared currency strengthened against 13 of 16
major peers. The Swiss franc touched the lowest level in almost
six months against the 17-nation currency.  The  MSCI Emerging Markets Index (MXEF)  climbed 2 percent, the most
in six weeks. South Korea’s  Kospi (KOSPI)  index jumped 2.6 percent after
 Fitch Ratings  upgraded the country’s debt. India’s Sensex jumped
2 percent and benchmark gauges in Russia, Hungary and the  Czech
Republic  rose more than 1 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
