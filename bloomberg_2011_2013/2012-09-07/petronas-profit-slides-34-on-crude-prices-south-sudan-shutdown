Petroliam Nasional Bhd., Malaysia’s
state energy company, said it will struggle to match last year’s
earnings after second-quarter profit fell 34 percent on lower
crude oil prices.  Net income dropped to 12.8 billion ringgit ($4.1 billion)
in the three months ended June 30 from 19.4 billion ringgit a
year earlier, the company known as  Petronas  said in a statement
in  Kuala Lumpur  today. Revenue slipped 3 percent to 70.7 billion
ringgit, also hurt by a production shutdown in  South Sudan .  To contact the reporter on this story:
