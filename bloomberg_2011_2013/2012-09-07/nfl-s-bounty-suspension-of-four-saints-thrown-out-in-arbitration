An arbitration panel threw out the
 National Football League ’s suspensions of four players who were
involved with the New Orleans Saints’ bounty pool case,
according to the league’s players union.  The yearlong suspension of linebacker Jonathan Vilma was
overturned, along with shorter suspensions to Scott Fujita,
Anthony Hargrove and  Will Smith , National Football League
Players Association spokesman George Atallah said in a telephone
interview. He said he couldn’t provide further details.  Saints spokesman Greg Bensel and NFL spokesman Greg Aiello
didn’t immediately return telephone or e-mail messages seeking
comment.  In May, Goodell suspended Vilma without pay for the 2012
season; Hargrove, a free-agent defensive lineman, for eight
games; Smith, a defensive end, for four games; and Fujita, a
linebacker now with the Cleveland Browns, for three games.  Todays decision doesn’t affect suspensions handed down to
Saints coaches including head coach  Sean Payton  and former
defensive coordinator Greg Williams.  To contact the reporter on this story:
