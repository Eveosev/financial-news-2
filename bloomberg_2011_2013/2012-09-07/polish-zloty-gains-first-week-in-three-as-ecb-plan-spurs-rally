The Polish zloty advanced for the
first week in three as the  European Central Bank ’s plan to buy
bonds of the euro area’s most indebted countries bolstered
appetite for riskier assets.  The zloty advanced 0.5 percent to 4.1040 per euro as of
5:25 p.m. in Warsaw. It appreciated 1.6 percent this week, the
steepest gain among more than 170 currencies tracked by
Bloomberg.  ECB President  Mario Draghi  said yesterday policy makers
agreed to an unlimited bond-buying program for struggling common
currency nations. It also eased borrowing against government-
issued or guaranteed assets by dropping rating requirements.  “The improvement in the euro area, reduced volatility and
expectations for quantitative easing are all positive factors
for high-yielding currencies, including the zloty,”  Rafal Benecki , chief economist for Poland at ING Groep NV in Warsaw,
wrote in an e-mailed note to clients.  To contact the reporter on this story:
