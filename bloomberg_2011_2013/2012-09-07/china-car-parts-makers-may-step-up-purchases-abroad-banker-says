Chinese auto-parts makers will
probably step up their pursuit of overseas assets and technology
as the global economic slump creates buying opportunities,  Bank
of America (BAC)  Merrill Lynch said.  Chinese companies seeking to boost exports will probably
acquire assets at a faster pace than the global auto-parts
industry, Patrick Steinemann, co-head of Asia industrials
 Investment Banking , said in an interview in Chengdu, China,
yesterday. Targets include German, Swedish and U.S. producers
with values ranging from $100 million to $200 million, he said,
declining to name anyone.  “This year is a year of opportunity because of the global
slowdown,” Steinemann said. “If export volumes increase, you
will see mergers and acquisitions increase.”  Chinese companies last year made 10 overseas acquisitions
valued at a record $1.8 billion in the auto-parts industry,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The Chinese government
has set aside about $10.9 billion in subsidies to help Chinese
auto-parts companies make overseas acquisitions through the end
of the decade, Usha Haley, a researcher at Washington-based
 Economic Policy Institute , wrote in January.  China’s Wanxiang Group signed an agreement last month to
invest as much as $465 million in  A123 Systems (AONE)  Inc., a U.S.
maker of rechargeable automobile batteries.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
