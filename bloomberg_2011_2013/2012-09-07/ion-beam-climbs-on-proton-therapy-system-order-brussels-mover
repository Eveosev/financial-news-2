Ion Beam Applications SA (IBAB) , Europe’s
largest maker of proton-therapy equipment, rose to the highest
in four months in Brussels trading after announcing an order to
install a cancer-treatment system in the U.S.  The shares climbed as much as 9.7 percent to 4.88 euros,
the highest since May 4. The stock traded at 4.70 euros, or 5.6
percent higher, at 9:46 a.m. local time.  The order, worth about $50 million to Ion Beam, is for a
joint venture in  Texas  between Baylor Health Care System, Texas
Oncology and McKesson Specialty Health, and includes a set of
three treatment rooms, Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium-based Ion Beam
said today in a statement.  “Importantly,  project financing  has been secured,” Jan De Kerpel, an analyst at KBC Securities in Brussels who recommends
buying the stock, wrote today in a note to clients. “The timing
and the size of the deal should allow investors to increase
their comfort level in IBA as an investment opportunity.”  The center will be able to treat more than 1,000 people
annually, with the first treatments slated for 2015, the company
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
