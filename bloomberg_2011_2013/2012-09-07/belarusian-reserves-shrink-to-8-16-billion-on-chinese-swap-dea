Belarus’s international reserves
dropped for a second month in August as the former Soviet nation
serviced external and domestic debt and a  currency swap  with
 China  expired, the country’s central bank said.  The gold and foreign-currency  holdings  shrank 1 percent to
$8.16 billion as of Sept. 1, after a 1.2 percent decline in
July, the central bank in the capital, Minsk,  said  in an e-
mailed statement today.  China and Belarus agreed on the three-year currency swap
valued at about $3 billion in March 2009 to boost trade and
investment, less than three months after the east European
country received an emergency loan from the  International
Monetary Fund .  Belarus wants to maintain its reserves at between $6.1
billion and $7 billion until the beginning of 2013, according to
monetary-policy guidelines approved by the government.  To contact the reporter on this story:
