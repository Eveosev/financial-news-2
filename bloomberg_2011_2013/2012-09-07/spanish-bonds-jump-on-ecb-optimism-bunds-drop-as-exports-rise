Spanish bonds rose, pushing 10-year
yields below 6 percent for the first time in four months, amid
optimism that the  European Central Bank ’s planned asset-purchase
program will lower the nation’s borrowing costs.  Italian bonds also gained, reducing the extra yield that
investors demand for holding the nation’s 10-year securities
instead of similar-maturity German bunds to the least in five
months. Bunds advanced, paring a weekly decline, after U.S.
 payrolls  rose less than economists forecast in August.
Portugal’s 10-year rates fell to the lowest in almost 18 months
as the ECB’s plan boosted demand for higher-yielding assets.  “The ECB delivered what was expected, and it’s a very
powerful tool that they’ve got,” said  Elisabeth Afseth , a
fixed-income analyst at Investec Bank Plc in  London . “They
could drive yields down as far as they want, to a certain
extent.”  The Spanish 10-year yield slipped 39 basis points, or 0.39
percentage point, to 5.64 percent as of 4:19 p.m. London time,
after falling to 5.63 percent, the lowest since April 4. The
5.85 percent bond due in January 2022 gained 2.795, or 27.95
euros per 1,000-euro ($1,279) face amount, to 101.495.  Italy ’s
10-year yield dropped 18 basis points to 5.08 percent.  The spread between Italian and German 10-year yields shrank
14 basis points to 3.56 percentage points after narrowing to
3.44 percentage points, the least since April 4.  Default Swaps  Credit-default swaps on the sovereign bonds of  Spain  and
Italy are set for their biggest weekly declines since the
European Union committed almost $1 trillion to backstop the
region’s debt in May 2010.  Contracts on Spain dropped 34 percent to 342 basis points
from 518 basis points on Aug. 31, and those on Italy fell 32
percent to 314 from 467. A decrease signals improving
perceptions of  credit quality .  ECB President  Mario Draghi  told reporters in  Frankfurt  that
asset purchases “will enable us to address severe distortions
in government bond markets, which originate from, in particular,
unfounded fears on the part of investors of the reversibility of
the euro.”  Policy makers are ready to use the resources needed to
reach the objectives in their bond-buying plan, ECB Governing
Council member Ardo Hansson said.  ‘No Limits’  “No limits were set yesterday, we are ready to use as many
resources as needed to achieve these goals,” Hansson, who is
the Governor of Estonia’s central bank, said on national public
television today. The ECB wants “to fix the situation in the
money market so that our goal of preserving  price stability 
would work all over euro area.”  Germany’s 10-year yield slipped four basis points to 1.52
percent, after rising to 1.63 percent, the highest since June
29. The rate has gained 18 basis points this week, the most
since the five days through July 27. The two-year rate was at
0.03 percent, from minus 0.035 percent at the end of last week.  The  U.S. economy  added 96,000 workers last month following
a revised 141,000 increase in July that was smaller than
initially estimated, Labor Department figures showed today in
 Washington . The median estimate of 92 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg called for a gain of 130,000. Unemployment fell to 8.1
percent, and hourly earnings were unchanged.  Bond Volatility  Volatility on Irish bonds was the highest in euro-region
markets today, followed by Spain and  Portugal , according to
measures of 10-year bonds, the spread between two- and 10-year
securities, and credit default swaps.  The yield on Ireland’s securities due October 2020 fell 20
basis points to 5.64 percent, while that on Portuguese debt
maturing in October 2023 slipped as much as 61 basis points to
8.09 percent, the lowest level since March 31, 2011.  German bunds dropped earlier as reports showing the
country’s  exports  and  industrial production  unexpectedly rose in
July added to evidence that  Europe ’s largest economy will avoid
a recession, damping demand for the euro-area’s safest assets.  Exports increased 0.5 percent in July from June, when they
fell 1.4 percent, the Federal Statistics Office in Wiesbaden
said today. Economists predicted a 0.5 percent decline,
according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey.  Production rose 1.3 percent from June, when it fell a
revised 0.4 percent, the Economy Ministry in Berlin said today.
Economists forecast unchanged production, a survey showed.  German  government bonds  returned 2.7 percent this year
through yesterday, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg
and the European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies.
Italy’s rose 14 percent and Spain’s were little changed.  To contact the reporters on this story:
