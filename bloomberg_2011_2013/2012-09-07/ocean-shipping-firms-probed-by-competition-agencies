The European Union’s antitrust
regulator and the U.S.  Justice Department  said they are
investigating possible violations in the maritime shipping
industry.  The Brussels-based European Commission carried out
unannounced inspections yesterday at several providers of
maritime transport services for cars as well as construction and
agricultural rolling machinery, the regulator said in a
statement today.  The commission said it has “reasons to believe that the
companies concerned may have violated” EU competition rules.
The EU didn’t identify the companies.  Gina Talamona, a spokeswoman for the Justice Department in
Washington, confirmed in an e-mail that the agency’s antitrust
division “is investigating the possibility of anticompetitive
practices involving the ocean shipping of cars, trucks,
construction equipment and other products.”  “We are coordinating with the European Commission, the
Japanese Fair Trade Commission and other international
competition authorities,” Talamona said, declining to elaborate
further.  To contact the reporters on this story:
