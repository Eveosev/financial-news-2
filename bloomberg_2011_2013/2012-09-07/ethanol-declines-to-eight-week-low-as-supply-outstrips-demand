Ethanol futures declined to an
eight-week low in  Chicago  as supplies outstripped demand.  Prices fell a day after an Energy Department report showed
the amount of the biofuel blended into U.S. gasoline slipped to
the lowest since the week ended Aug. 17 while  production  surged
to a nine-week high and  supply  jumped the most since July 27.  “Increases in the DOE production and inventory numbers
this week have left many market participants a little
skittish,” said Mike Breitenbach, an analyst and trader at Blue
Ocean Brokerage LLC in  New York .  Denatured ethanol for October delivery fell 2.4 cents, or 1
percent, to $2.512 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade, the
lowest price since July 11. Futures have gained 14 percent this
year.  In cash market trading, ethanol was unchanged in Chicago at
$2.53 a gallon and on the West Coast the additive sank 4 cents,
or 1.5 percent, to $2.655, data compiled by Bloomberg shows.  Ethanol in the U.S. Gulf slid 2.5 cents, or 1 percent, to
$2.595 a gallon and in New York the biofuel lost 1 cent, or 0.4
percent, to $2.605.  Corn for December delivery gained 1 cent to $7.995 a bushel
in Chicago. One bushel makes at least 2.75 gallons of ethanol.  Gasoline for October delivery jumped 2.86 cents, or 1
percent, to $3.0196 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . The contract covers reformulated gasoline, which is
made to be blended with ethanol before delivery to filling
stations.  The value of Renewable Identification Numbers, known as
RINs, climbed 3.6 percent to 2.9 cents, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. They are credits that help the government track
whether refiners are meeting 2012 federal ethanol use mandates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
