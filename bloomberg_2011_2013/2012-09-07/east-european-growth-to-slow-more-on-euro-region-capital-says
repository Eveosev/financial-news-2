Eastern  Europe ’s economic growth is
set to slow further because of a deteriorating outlook in the
euro area, the region’s largest export market, Capital Economics
Ltd. said.  The east’s second-quarter slowdown was triggered by
austerity and falling economic confidence as households hold
back on consumption and companies run down inventories faster on
concern demand will fall,  William Jackson , a London-based
emerging-markets economist at Capital, wrote today in an e-
mailed note.  “Weak domestic demand was the main drag on growth coming
on the back of fiscal austerity and falling confidence,”
Jackson wrote. “With external headwinds mounting, we think
growth is set to slow further over the coming quarters.”  Eastern Europe depends on the euro region for exports,
foreign direct investment and bank funding. Western European
lenders control about two-thirds of the region’s banking
industry. The economy of the 17-nation euro area shrank 0.2
percent in the second quarter from the January-March period,
when it stagnated.  The Czech and Hungarian economies contracted 1 percent and
1.3 percent from a year earlier in the second quarter, while
 Poland  grew 2.4 percent, its slowest pace in almost three years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
