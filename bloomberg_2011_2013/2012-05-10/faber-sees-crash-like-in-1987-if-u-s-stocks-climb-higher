U.S. stocks  may plunge in the second
half of the year “like in 1987” if the  Standard & Poor’s 500
Index (SPX)  climbs without further stimulus from the  Federal Reserve ,
said  Marc Faber , whose prediction of a February selloff in
global equities never materialized.  “I think the market will have difficulties to move up
strongly unless we have a massive QE3,” Faber, who manages $300
million at Marc Faber Ltd., told  Betty Liu  on Bloomberg
Television’s “In the Loop” from Zurich today, referring to a
third round of large-scale asset purchases by the Fed. “If it
moves and makes a high above 1,422, the second half of the year
could witness a crash, like in 1987.”  The  Dow Jones Industrial Average  plunged 23 percent on Oct.
19, 1987 in the biggest crash since 1914, triggering losses in
stock-market values around the world. The Standard & Poor’s 500
Index plummeted 20 percent. The Dow still closed 2.3 percent
higher in 1987, and the  S&P 500  advanced 2 percent.  “If the market makes a new high, it will be a new high
with very few stocks pushing up and the majority of stocks
having already rolled over,” Faber said. “The earnings outlook
is not particularly good because most economies in the world are
slowing down.”  Profit Growth  More than 69 percent of companies the S&P 500 that reported
results since April 10 have exceeded  analysts’ forecasts  for
per-share earnings, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Profits are due to increase 3.9 percent in the second quarter
and 6 percent the following period, estimates compiled by
Bloomberg show.  Faber said a third round of quantitative easing would
“definitely occur” if the S&P 500 dropped another 100 to 150
points. If it bounces back to 1,400, he said, the Fed will
probably wait to see how the economy develops.  The S&P 500 rose 0.3 percent to 1,358.77 at 12:03 p.m. in
 New York  today as U.S.  initial jobless claims  fell last week to
a one-month low. The gauge has dropped 4.3 percent from a four-
year high on April 2 after some economic reports missed
forecasts.  Equity markets this year resemble 1987 as they had a “very
strong start” followed by a “correction,” Faber said in an e-
mailed response to questions today. “If we have a rally into
August it could resemble 1987 with a crash in the fall.”  On Dec. 2, Faber said global markets may drop in February
and the chances of a medium-sized recession are high. The MSCI
World Index climbed 4.8 percent that month after surging 5.7
percent in January.  ‘Off the Table’  Faber said investors should “take some money off the
table” on Feb. 21 as stocks were “overbought.” The S&P 500
increased 4.2 percent through April 2.  Faber had said in an interview with Bloomberg Television on
March 9, 2009, that it was “very difficult to see a scenario
where you wouldn’t make any money” owning stocks over the
following 10 years, while also warning the S&P 500 might lose 26
percent before the  bear market  ended.  In March 2007, he had said the S&P 500 was more likely to
fall than rise because the threats of faster inflation and
slower growth persisted. The S&P 500 then climbed 10 percent to
a record 1,565.15 seven months later, and ended the year up 3.5
percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
