Latvian consumer prices grew at the
slowest pace in 16 months in April as health care and clothing
costs fell.  The inflation rate dropped to 2.8 percent from 3.3 percent
the previous month, the  statistics office , based in the capital,
Riga, said today on its website. Prices rose 0.6 percent from
March.  The Baltic country plans to cut its value-added tax, a
sales levy, by 1 percentage point in July to slow inflation as
the government seeks to qualify for euro adoption in 2014,
Finance Minister Andris Vilks said last month.  Countries seeking to adopt the euro must keep inflation at
less than 1.5 percentage points above the average of the three
lowest levels in the EU. Latvia’s 12-month consumer-price index
was 4.1 percent in March, according to Eurostat. The threshold
for the currency changeover was 3.1 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
