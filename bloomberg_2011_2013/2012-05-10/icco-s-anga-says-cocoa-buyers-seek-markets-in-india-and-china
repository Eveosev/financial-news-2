Cocoa buyers and chocolate makers are
seeking to increase exports to  China  and India, according to the
International Cocoa Organization.  “These countries have real potential, with at least 600
million people earning more than $10,000,” Jean-Marc Anga,
executive director of the London-based group, said in an
interview yesterday in Abidjan,  Ivory Coast ’s commercial
capital.  The ICCO will hold its annual cocoa conference in the
Ivorian city in November, Anga said. As the world’s biggest
grower of the crop, Ivory Coast is expected to produce about 1.3
million metric tons in the 2011-2012 season, he said.  Global cocoa stocks are currently at about 1.4 million
tons, Anga said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
