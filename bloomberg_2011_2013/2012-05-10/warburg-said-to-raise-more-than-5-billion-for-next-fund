Warburg Pincus  LLC, the owner of
 Neiman Marcus  and Interactive Data Corp., has raised more than
$5 billion for its new fund, said a person briefed on the matter
who asked not to be named because the information is private.  The buyout firm is seeking $12 billion for Warburg Pincus
Private Equity XI LP, which started gathering money in
September, according to a marketing document obtained by
Bloomberg News.  Ed Trissel, a spokesman for the New York-based firm,
declined to comment.  Unlike some peers that have scaled back their capital-
raising targets, Warburg Pincus has the same goal for Fund XI as
its predecessor. Warburg Pincus Private Equity X LP surpassed
its target with a final close at $15 billion in 2008.  When Warburg Pincus started fundraising, it told investors
that it would give a management fee break to those that
committed at least $200 million, according to the marketing
document. Several large buyout firms are offering similar
discounts to win large checks.  The prior Warburg Pincus fund was producing 1 times the
Oregon Public Employees Retirement Fundâ€™s investment, for a 0.3
percent internal rate of return, as of Sept. 30, according to
data from pension system.  Reuters reported the fundraising progress earlier today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
