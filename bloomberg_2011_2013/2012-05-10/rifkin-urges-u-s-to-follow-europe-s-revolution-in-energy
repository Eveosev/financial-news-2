The U.S. should follow  Europe ’s lead
in boosting renewable energy as part of “the third industrial
revolution,” according to Jeremy Rifkin, a Wharton Business
School professor.  The European Union, which hired Rifkin as an adviser, is
setting up internet infrastructure that millions of people use
to share energy information and building electric car networks,
Rifkin said after speaking today at a seminar in  Seoul .  “The U.S. should not stay asleep, because fossil energy
can not support sustainable growth,” he said. “Energy is
expensive and volatile. You can’t grow with old second-
industrial revolution, centralized electricity communications,
fossil energy and old-type infrastructure.”  Sustainable growth will be available only when countries
shift to the “third industrial revolution,” where energy
information is a matrix available in all buildings, he said.
People in the EU can share electricity across the region and
plug in electric vehicles anywhere, which will create thousands
of jobs, Rifkin said.  The EU is looking for renewable-energy partners in  South
Korea , he said. In the U.S., Rifkin advised the Democratic
Policy Committee of the Senate on how to develop an exit-
strategy from oil, according to his  website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
