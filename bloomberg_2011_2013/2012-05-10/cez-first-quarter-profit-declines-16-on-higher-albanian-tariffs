CEZ AS (CEZ) , the  Czech Republic ’s largest
power producer, said first-quarter profit fell 16 percent after
it was forced to pay higher tariffs in Albania and currency
gains weren’t repeated.  Net income dropped to 14.4 billion koruna ($738 million)
from 17.3 billion koruna a year earlier, the Prague-based
utility said today in a statement. That missed the 15.4 billion-
koruna average estimate of 13 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Profit was curtailed as the Albanian regulator ordered CEZ
to pay the state-owned electricity producer higher tariffs
without allowing the utility to pass on the extra costs to
customers. CEZ reiterated a full-year target for net income of
41 billion koruna and said it will focus on the expansion of the
Temelin nuclear power station, for which it may seek a partner.  “The quarterly results are slightly negative, but CEZ
confirmed its full-year targets,”  Josef Nemy , an analyst at
Komercni Banka AS in  Prague , said in an e-mailed note. “Its
outlook indicates increased earnings in the following
quarters.” Nemy has a hold recommendation on the shares.  Revenue gained 7 percent to 60.8 billion koruna, while
earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization
fell 1 percent to 26.3 billion koruna. CEZ said in February it
expects 2012 Ebitda of 87.9 billion koruna.  CEZ pre-sold 56 percent of its 2013 power output and 22
percent of its 2014 production as of May 1. The company
confirmed plans to pay 45 koruna a share in dividends for 2011.  Winning Bid  CEZ rose 0.6 percent to 714.50 koruna as of 12:05 p.m. in
Prague. The stock has lost 9.7 percent this year.  Westinghouse Electric Corp.,  Areva SA (AREVA)  and a Russian-Czech
group led by Rosatom Corp.’s Atomstroyexport unit are competing
for the Temelin contract, estimated at $10 billion. CEZ plans to
select the winning bid at the end of 2013 and is studying
options to invite a strategic partner for the project.  Losses in Albania shaved 1.9 billion koruna off CEZ’s
Ebitda, offsetting a 400 million-koruna gain in  Bulgaria  and a
600 million-koruna gain in  Romania , the company said. CEZ’s
Romanian wind parks in Fantanele and Cogealac produced 283
gigawatts during the first quarter, a 42 percent increase from
year ago. Production capacity in the parks will exceed 1,000
gigawatt hours this year, CEZ said.  Last year, CEZ gained from a revaluation of its share
options in  Hungary ’s Mol Nyrt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
