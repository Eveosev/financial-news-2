Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) , the fifth-
biggest  U.S. bank  by assets, positioned itself for a decline in
the value of Spanish  government bonds  and a rally in Italian
sovereign debt during the first quarter.  The firm’s “market exposure” to Spanish government bonds
shifted to a negative $446 million in March from a positive $151
million in December, the New York-based firm disclosed in a
quarterly regulatory filing. For Italian sovereign debt, the
exposure surged to $2.51 billion in March from $210 million in
December, according to the filing.  Goldman Sachs discloses the firm’s credit and market stance
for Italy,  Greece , Ireland,  Portugal  and  Spain  each quarter
because those five countries are viewed by investors as  Europe ’s
riskiest. Concern about the continent’s financial crisis has
reignited since the end of the quarter as Greek voters balked at
austerity measures and Spain prepared a fourth attempt to
overhaul its financial system.  “Credit exposure” shows the risk from a default or credit
deterioration of the counterparty or borrower, and “market
exposure” is the potential loss tied to price changes.  Total credit exposure to the five nations fell 14 percent
in the first quarter to $2.52 billion from $2.93 billion,
according to the filing. Total market exposure more than
quadrupled to $2.68 billion from $585 million.  Spanish Securities  In Spain, Goldman Sachs’s market exposure to credit
derivatives on sovereign debt was negative $515 million at the
end of March, compared with negative $550 million at the end of
December. The total market exposure on Spanish sovereign debt
was negative $961 million at the end of March, more than double
the negative $399 million at the end of December.  By contrast, Goldman Sachs’s market exposure to non-
sovereign Spanish securities climbed to $911 million from
negative $45 million at the end of December. The firm had $1.46
billion of non-sovereign Spanish  bonds  and $234 million of
equities, offset by a negative $782 million from  credit
derivatives , according to the filing.  Derivatives include credit-default swaps, which act like
insurance to reimburse a bondholder when a borrower fails to
meet its obligations.  Goldman Sachs’s credit exposure to Spanish government debt
fell to $68 million in March from $88 million in December, while
the firm’s position in non-sovereign Spanish debt climbed to
$571 million from $423 million, according to the filing.  The firm  had “market exposure” of $2.51 billion on
Italian government bonds and $170 million on credit derivatives
at the end of March.  Italian Markets  Market exposure to non-sovereign Italian securities was
negative $285 million at the end of March, as a negative
$907 million exposure from credit derivatives more than offset
$367 million of non-sovereign Italian bonds and $255 million in
Italian equities.  Total credit exposure to  Italy  fell to $1.17 billion in
March from $1.23 billion at the end of December. While sovereign
credit exposure to Italy rose to $302 million from $259 million,
non-sovereign credit exposure slid to $867 million from $966
million.  The yield on Spanish 10-year bonds, which move in the
opposite direction of prices, was little changed at 5.33 percent
at the end of March compared with 5.34 percent at the end of
December. It has since surged to 5.97 percent. Italy’s 10-year
bond, after dropping to a yield of 5.10 percent from 7.03
percent in the quarter, has since risen to 5.50 percent.  Yields on two-year Spanish debt have climbed to 3.51
percent from 2.47 percent at the end of March, while two-year
Italian bonds are yielding 2.95 percent compared with 2.86
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
