South Korea’s bonds fell the most in
almost two months as  Bank of Korea  left  interest rates  unchanged
and Governor Kim Choong Soo said the board didn’t discuss a cut.
The won declined.  The central bank held the benchmark seven-day repurchase
 rate  at 3.25 percent for an 11th month, as predicted by all 17
economists in a Bloomberg News survey, and said it will continue
to “normalize” borrowing costs. The won slid as Greek
political leaders struggle to form a coalition government after
a May 6 election, reigniting concern about the country’s
willingness to comply with bailout agreements. The  Kospi Index (KOSPI) 
fell as overseas investors sold more Korean shares than they
bought for a seventh day, according to exchange data.  “There were some expectations in the market for comments
from the central bank that may signal a rate cut, but the
governor clearly stated the bank will normalize rates, which
means a rise,” said Kong Dong Rak, a Seoul-based fixed-income
analyst at Taurus Investment & Securities Co. in Seoul.  The yield on South Korea’s 3.25 percent bonds due December
2014 rose four basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 3.41
percent, according to Korea Exchange Inc. prices. That’s the
biggest increase since March 15.  Three-year debt futures declined 0.11 to 104.37 and the
cost of the one-year interest-rate swap increased two basis
points to 3.46 percent.  Stabilizing Markets  South Korea  will take action to stabilize financial markets
if needed as uncertainty over  Europe  has increased after
elections in France and  Greece , Finance Minister Bahk Jae Wan
said today. The central bank’s policy statement was “hawkish,”
and rate increases may come in early 2013, Kwon Goohoon and
Chung Sungsoo, Seoul-based economists at Goldman Sachs Group
Inc., wrote in a note to clients.  The won lost 0.2 percent to 1,142.30 per dollar in Seoul,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It touched 1,145.75
earlier, the weakest level since April 11. One-month implied
volatility, a measure of exchange-rate swings used to price
options, jumped 32 basis points to 8.25 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
