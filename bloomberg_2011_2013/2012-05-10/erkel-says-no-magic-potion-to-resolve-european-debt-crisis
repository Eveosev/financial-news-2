German  Chancellor Angela Merkel  said
she’ll tell her Group of Eight counterparts there is no “magic
potion” to cure  Europe ’s financial crisis and the turmoil can
only be overcome by reducing debt and boosting competitiveness.  “Overcoming the sovereign debt crisis cannot and will not
happen overnight -- and certainly not with the big bang that
we’d all wish for,” Merkel told lawmakers in Berlin today in a
speech previewing the G-8 summit at Camp David in Maryland on
May 18-19. “There’s been so much discussion about euro bonds
and leveraging effects -- all of these remedies came and went
like wonder weapons that revealed themselves as unworkable.”  Merkel’s support for austerity measures has come under
renewed criticism with a surge of support in  Greece  for anti-
bailout parties and  Francois Hollande ’s victory in  France ’s
presidential election after campaigning on a platform of
shifting the crisis-fighting focus to growth.  In her 20-minute speech to the lower house of parliament,
or Bundestag, Merkel reiterated her preference to curtail
spending among the 17 euro states and spur growth through
“structural reform” rather than debt-funded stimulus programs.  Defeating the euro-area crisis that surfaced in Greece in
late 2009 will be a “long and strenuous path,” Merkel said.
She identified the source of the crisis as “the horrendous debt
as well as the lack of competitiveness in some euro-area
countries.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
