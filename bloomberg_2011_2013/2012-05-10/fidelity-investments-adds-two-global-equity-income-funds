Fidelity Investments , the second-
largest mutual fund company, introduced two versions of a
global-equity fund designed to appeal to investors seeking
dividend income.  The Fidelity Global Equity Income Fund and the Fidelity
Advisor Global Equity Income Fund will buy dividend-paying
stocks around the world in an effort to generate income amid a
volatile stock market and low bond yields, Boston-based Fidelity
said today in a statement.  “This fund should be able to generate good risk-adjusted
returns while delivering good dividend yields,” Ramona Persaud,
the fund’s manager, said in a telephone interview.  Persaud, who has been with Fidelity since 2003, buys a
similar group of stocks for the $8.8 billion  Fidelity Equity-
Income Fund (FEQIX) , which she helps manage. That U.S.-oriented fund
beat 77 percent of rivals this year while trailing 96 percent
over five years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Companies around the world have consistently paid higher
dividends than their counterparts in the U.S., Fidelity said.
Because markets outside the U.S. are less efficient, they can
“create significant investment opportunities,” the firm wrote.  The 10-year U.S. Treasury note yields about 1.83 percent.
The dividend yield on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, a
benchmark for large U.S. stocks, is 2.1 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
