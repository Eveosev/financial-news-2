Juniper Networks Inc. (JNPR)  Chief
Technology Officer Pradeep Sindhu said that demand from
telecommunications-service providers for his company’s computer-
networking gear remains “unsettled.”  “The marketplace, especially in service providers, is
definitely a little bit unsettled and deals are taking somewhat
longer, so the outlook is cautious,” Sindhu said at the
Bloomberg Enterprise Technology Summit in New York. “But we are
actually quite confident we are gaining market share, we have an
incredible product pipeline and I think we should hold our
own.”  Lackluster demand from communications companies, which make
up 60 percent of Juniper’s revenue, is weighing on results for
the company. Juniper, the second-largest maker routers and
switches, reported first-quarter gross margin last month that
missed its own forecasts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
