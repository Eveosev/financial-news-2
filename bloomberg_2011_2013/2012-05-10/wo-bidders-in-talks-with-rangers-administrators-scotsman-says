Two new bidders, one of them well-
known to football and  Scotland , have held detailed talks with
administrators to Rangers Football Club Plc, the Scotsman
reported, citing administrators Duff & Phelps.  The club’s future can be secured before the team play their
last league fixture against St Johnstone on May 13, the
newspaper said.  American Bill Miller, named as preferred bidder for the
club two days ago, withdrew his bid after finding its
preliminary financial  statements were “more optimistic than
reality.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
