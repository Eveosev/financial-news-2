Oil rose for the first time in seven
days as U.S. claims for initial jobless benefits fell last week
to a one-month low, adding to optimism that demand in the
world’s biggest crude consumer will grow.  Futures increased 0.3 percent after the Labor Department
reported  jobless claims  dropped by 1,000 to 367,000 in the
period ended May 5, the lowest since the end of March. The
number of people on unemployment benefit rolls was the smallest
since July 2008.  “The jobs data was supportive and oil gained after the
numbers,” said  Tom Bentz , a director with BNP Paribas Prime
Brokerage Inc. “The market is consolidating after the recent
losses, recovering a little bit.”  Crude for June delivery gained 27 cents to settle at $97.08
a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . The price, which
slumped 8.8 percent in the six-day losing streak, has fallen 7.4
percent in May.  Brent oil for June settlement slid 47 cents, or 0.4
percent, to $112.73 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures
Europe exchange.  The latest week’s jobless figure compares with an average
of 373,000 claims since the end of February. The  median forecast 
of 47 economists surveyed by Bloomberg was 368,000. The  four-
week  moving average, a less volatile measure than the weekly
figures, decreased to 379,000 last week from 384,250 the
previous period.  ‘Good News’  “The jobs number is alleviating concerns that the economic
recovery is faltering,” said  Phil Flynn , an analyst at futures
brokerage PFGBest in Chicago. “The market’s been down for six
days in a row so any good news will encourage more buying.”  Oil also gained as U.S. equities advanced and the euro
strengthened against the dollar. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
rebounded from a two-month low, rising 0.6 percent as floor
trading ended on the Nymex.  The euro snapped the longest slide since 2008 as  Greece 
attempted to form a new government. The euro gained 0.2 percent
to $1.2956. A weaker dollar and stronger euro increase oil’s
appeal as an alternative investment.  “The jobless claims were pretty good,” said Rich Ilczyszyn, chief market strategist and founder of Iitrader.com
in  Chicago . “Equities like it and the euro isn’t falling into
the ocean. You are seeing buyers coming back into the market.”  China Imports  Oil declined earlier after  China ’s April crude imports
dropped to the lowest level since December, while exports of
goods rose less than estimated, signaling less demand in the
world’s second-biggest crude consumer.  China bought 22.21 million metric tons, or 5.4 million
barrels a day, more oil than it exported in April, data
 published  on the website of the Beijing-based General
Administration of Customs showed. Imports of crude were 22.26
million tons and exports 50,000.  The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries said that
global supplies are outpacing demand, keeping its forecast for
world consumption this year unchanged.  OPEC, scheduled to meet next month, is producing 8.3
percent more crude than it considers necessary this quarter,
which has helped inventories in developed nations to reach
“comfortable levels,” equivalent to about 59 days worth of
consumption, according to an e-mailed report from the group.  Saudi Arabia , the world’s biggest crude exporter, pumped
10.1 million barrels a day in April, about 200,000 barrels more
than the previous month.  U.S. oil stockpiles  climbed 3.65 million barrels to 379.5
million last week, the most since August 1990, the Energy
Department reported yesterday.  Total demand  rose 0.3 percent to
18.6 million barrels a day.  “We still have plenty of oil and the fundamentals are
weak,” said  James Williams , an economist at WTRG Economics, an
energy-research firm in  London ,  Arkansas .  Electronic trading volume on the Nymex was 477,877
contracts as of 3:09 p.m. in New York. Volume totaled 660,026
contracts yesterday, 8.6 percent above the three-month average.
Open interest was 1.57 million.  To contact the reporters on this story:
