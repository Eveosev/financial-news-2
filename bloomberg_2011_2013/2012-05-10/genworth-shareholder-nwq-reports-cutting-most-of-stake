NWQ Investment Management Co. slashed
its stake in  Genworth Financial Inc. (GNW) , the insurer whose chief
executive officer resigned May 1 after postponing plans for the
initial public offering of its Australia unit.  NWQ reported beneficial ownership of 0.001 percent in
Richmond, Virginia-based Genworth in a regulatory filing today.
That compares with a stake of more than 37 million shares, or
about 7.6 percent, at the end of 2011, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
