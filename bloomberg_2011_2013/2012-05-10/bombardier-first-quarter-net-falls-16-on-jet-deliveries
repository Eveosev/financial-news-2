Bombardier Inc. (BBD/B) , the world’s biggest
maker of business jets by revenue, said first-quarter profit
fell 16 percent as the company delivered fewer of its large-
cabin Global 5000 and 6000 aircraft.  Net income dropped to $185 million, or 10 cents a share,
from $220 million, or 12 cents, a year earlier, Montreal-based
Bombardier said today in a statement. Sales declined 25 percent
to $3.51 billion, trailing the average analysts’ estimate of
$4.5 billion.  Bombardier began outfitting its Global business jets with
new cockpit equipment in late March, delaying deliveries of some
planes. With a list price of about $50 million, the Global jets
are the most important contributors to Bombardier’s aerospace
profit, Joe Nadol, an analyst at JPMorgan in  New York , said in a
note to clients published May 7.  Most of the drop in revenue and profit “is due to timing
issues,”  Fadi Chamoun , an analyst with BMO Capital Markets in
Toronto, said today in a note to clients. “Order levels
continue to be robust. We view the pullback as a buying
opportunity.”  Chamoun has an outperform rating, a type of buy
recommendation, on Bombardier. The Class B shares rose 7.3
percent, the most since Oct. 28, to C$3.96 at the close in
Toronto.  Cameron Doerksen , an analyst at National Bank Financial
in Montreal, raised his rating to outperform from sector
perform.  Quarterly Deliveries  Customers took delivery of 37 aircraft in the quarter,
compared with 61 planes a year earlier. Bombardier shipped seven
commercial aircraft, down from 23 regional jets and turboprops
in last year’s first quarter. Business jet deliveries dropped 22
percent to 29 units.  “The entry into service of the Vision Flight Deck on the
Global 5000 and Global 6000 aircraft and the resulting
transition, as well as lower deliveries of commercial aircraft,
had an impact on our revenues,” Chief Executive Officer Pierre Beaudoin said in today’s statement. “Nevertheless, we were able
to contain costs and maintain our profitability.”  Bombardier said March 1 it expects deliveries to drop to
235 this year from 245 in calendar 2011. Business aircraft will
make up the bulk of shipments, with 180 business planes
delivered, compared with 55 commercial aircraft.  ‘Deliveries Ramping’  “Now that Bombardier is delivering aircraft with the new
cockpit, we see deliveries ramping,” said Nadol, who has an
overweight recommendation on the stock, the equivalent of buy.
“Demand for Globals is solid and production rates are rising,
which gives us confidence in the growth we are forecasting
despite the slow start.”  Nadol said he expects Bombardier to ship 59 Global  business
jets  this year, an 11 percent increase over last year’s total.  Net orders declined 21 percent to 68 units in the quarter.
Bombardier sold 40 business jets, down from 77 a year ago. It
also sold 28 commercial aircraft, up from five a year ago.  Bombardier switched to calendar-year reporting in 2011 from
a fiscal year that ended Jan. 31. That means this year’s first
quarter ended on March 31, while the year-earlier period ran
from Feb. 1 through April 30, 2011.  Free cash flow usage soared 74 percent to $712 million in
the first quarter, the company said. Bombardier is working to
meet a 2013 target for entry into service of the CSeries
jetliner, its largest plane, which is costing about $3.5 billion
to develop.  Segment Results  Earnings before interest and taxes fell to 6.1 percent of
revenue from 6.7 percent a year earlier, Bombardier said today.
Profit dropped to 6.1 percent of sales from 6.4 percent at the
aerospace unit, and to 6.2 percent from 6.9 percent in the rail
business.  “We’re in an excellent position in the rail transportation
market,” Beaudoin said, after rail accounted for more than half
of revenue and pretax earnings in the quarter. Bombardier
received an order for 16 four-car double-decker trains from
Deutsche Bahn AG earlier this year.  Bombardier had $55.2 billion of future orders in its
backlog as of March 31, down from $53.9 billion a year earlier.
Its rail unit booked $1.2 billion of new contracts in the first
quarter, boosting its backlog to $31.9 billion at the end of
March.  Separately, Bombardier said its board yesterday approved a
plan to buy back as much as 5 percent of outstanding Class A and
Class B stock after June 16.  To contact the reporter on this story:
