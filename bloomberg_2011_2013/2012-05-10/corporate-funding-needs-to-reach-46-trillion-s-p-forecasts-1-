Funding needs of non-financial
companies in the U.S., euro region, U.K., China and  Japan  will
total $43 trillion to $46 trillion over the next five years,
 Standard & Poor’s  said in a report.  This includes $30 trillion of debt to be refinanced and $13
trillion to $16 trillion of new money needed to spur growth, the
ratings company said.  “This global wall of non-financial corporate debt will
potentially compound the credit rationing that may occur as
banks seek to restructure their balance sheets, and bond and
equity investors reassess their risk-return thresholds,” Jayan Dhru, senior managing director of global corporate ratings at
S&P in  New York , said in the report.  “Combined with the euro-zone crisis, the slow U.S.
economic recovery and the prospect of a slowing economy in
 China , this raises the downside risk of a perfect storm in
global corporate credit markets,” Dhru said.  Companies around the world sold $1.5 trillion of bonds this
year, about the same as was issued in the same period of 2011,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Loans fell 18 percent
to $740.1 billion as the global financial crisis prompted banks
to pull back on lending.  S&P said it expects banks and capital markets “will
largely be able to continue to provide” most of the cash
companies need, though “downside risk remains” and the funding
situation remains “very fragile.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
