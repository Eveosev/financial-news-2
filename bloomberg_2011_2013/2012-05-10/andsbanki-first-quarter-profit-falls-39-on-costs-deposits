Landsbankinn hf , the state-created
successor to failed Icelandic lender Landsbanki Islands hf, said
first-quarter profit slipped 39 percent as costs increased and
it paid out more in deposits.  Net income fell to 7.7 billion kronur ($61 million) from
12.7 billion kronur a year earlier, the Reykjavik-based bank
said in a statement posted on its website. Net interest income
after adjustments rose to 8.9 billion kronur from 5.4 billion
kronur a year earlier, while operating income rose to 15.7
billion kronur from 13.3 billion kronur.  Landsbanki Islands collapsed in October 2008 after it was
unable to secure short-term funding. A year later, 18.7 percent
was taken over by a resolution committee representing the bankâ€™s
creditors. The  Icelandic government  holds 81.3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
