The U.S. government posted a  budget
surplus  in April, the first in more than three years, as  tax
revenue  climbed and spending dropped.  Receipts topped outlays by $59.1 billion compared with a
deficit of $40.4 billion in April 2011, the Treasury Department
said today. Economists projected a $35 billion surplus,
according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey. It
was the first surplus since September 2008 and the biggest since
April 2008.  “The total  federal budget  deficit is slowly shrinking,”
said  Steven Wood , president of Insight Economics LLC in
Danville,  California . “However, this improvement has been
halting, due largely to erratic economic and employment
growth.”  President Barack Obama, in his campaign to win a second
term, is trying to make the case that while the recovery has
been uneven, the U.S. is making progress. The administration has
said won’t accept any of the dozen spending bills  House
Republicans  are working on unless they agree to abide by a
budget deal reached last year.  The dispute may lead to a government shutdown shortly
before the November elections unless lawmakers agree on
legislation to keep agencies operating in the 2013 fiscal year,
which starts Oct. 1.  Obama Budget  Republicans rejected President  Barack Obama ’s $3.8
trillion election-year budget plan, saying it didn’t go far
enough to reduce the deficit or boost economic growth.  Estimates of the April budget outcome ranged from roughly
in balance to a surplus of $60 billion in a Bloomberg survey of
23 economists. April has been a surplus month in 44 of the past
58 fiscal years, the Treasury Department said.  The non-partisan  Congressional Budget Office  estimated this
week the April surplus would reach $58 billion. The CBO said in
a report dated May 7 that the results were influenced by shifts
in the timing of certain payments.  Receipts increased 10 percent from the same month last year
to $318.8 billion, today’s Treasury Department report showed.
Over the same period, spending dropped 21 percent to $259.7
billion.  Obama’s proposed budget would initially boost the  U.S.
economy  though later in this decade it would become a drag on
growth, the CBO said April 20.  Between 2018 and 2022, the administration’s plan would cut
growth by 0.5 percent to 2.2 percent, according to the analysis.  To contact the reporters on this story:
