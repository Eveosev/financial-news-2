Schneider Trading Associates Ltd.
agreed to sell its clearing franchise unit to commodities broker
Marex Spectron Group for an undisclosed sum.  The transaction is expected to be completed before the end
of May, London-based parent Schneider Group said in a statement
today. The combined group will service 1,000 traders transacting
more than 200 million contracts per year. Schneider Trading
Associates will focus on its brokerage unit following the sale.  Marex, which describes itself as the worldâ€™s largest
closely held commodities broker, has more than doubled its
headcount to about 545 from 210 in January last year. The firm
purchased commodity and freight broker Spectron Group Ltd. in
March 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
