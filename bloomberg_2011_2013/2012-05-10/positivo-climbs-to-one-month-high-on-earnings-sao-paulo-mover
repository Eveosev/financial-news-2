Positivo Informatica SA (POSI3) , Brazil’s
biggest computer maker, rose to a one-month high after it
reported a profit in the first quarter, compared with a loss a
year earlier.  Shares jumped 2.7 percent to 6.96 reais at the close in  Sao
Paulo , the highest since April 9. The benchmark  Bovespa index 
dropped 0.1 percent.  The company reported net income of 9.8 million reais ($5
million) in the first quarter after posting a loss of 33.7
million reais in the first three months of 2011, according to a
regulatory filing yesterday after markets closed. Operating
expenses fell 12 percent to 107.2 million reais while net sales
increased 8.6 percent to 457.9 million reais.  Positivo “appears to be returning to more normalized
profitability levels, and continues to benefit from the efforts
to improve its operating efficiency,”  Raymond James  &
Associates Inc. analysts Luca Cipiccia and Daniela Bretthauer in
Sao Paulo wrote in a note to clients.  Raymond James forecast the computer maker would report net
income of 1 million reais.  To contact the reporter on this story:
