Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) ,  Citigroup
Inc. (C)  and  Jefferies Group Inc. (JEF)  plan to sell $1.5 billion of
commercial mortgage-backed securities as soon as next week,
according to people familiar with the transaction.  The deal contains 79 loans tied to 175 properties across
the U.S., said the people, who asked not to be identified
because terms aren’t public.  Wall Street has arranged about $5 billion of the debt this
year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Sales are picking
up after slowing in the fourth quarter as market volatility
crimped new lending.  Bank projections for commercial-mortgage bond deals in 2012
range from Wells Fargo & Co.’s $25 billion to Credit Suisse
Group AG’s projection of as much as $45 billion.  Commercial-mortgage bond values slid last month when the
 Federal Reserve Bank of New York  said it was considering selling
assets from its Maiden Lane III portfolio on concern there
wouldn’t be enough buyers. The district bank sold $7.5 billion
of collateralized debt obligations tied to commercial real
estate to Barclays Plc and Deutsche Bank AG on April 26 after a
bidding war erupted for the securities. UBS AG yesterday sold
$1.5 billion of similar securities.  Prices on a commonly cited measure of demand for lower-
rated commercial-mortgage bonds fell to 59.8 cents on the dollar
on April 10, according to data from Markit Group Ltd. Prices
have since rebounded to 61.9 cents, still down from the 2012
high of 72 cents in January.  To contact the reporter on this story:
