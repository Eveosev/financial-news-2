The ruble weakened to its lowest
close against the dollar in almost three months after oil,
 Russia ’s chief export earner, declined.  The ruble weakened 1 percent to 30.11 per dollar by the
close in Moscow, its worst since Feb. 16. Russia’s $3.5 billion
of Eurobonds due 2020 rose for the first time in three days,
lowering the yield five basis points, or 0.05 percentage point,
to 3.881 percent.  Crude futures traded at $97.11 per barrel in  New York ,
$1.38 less than when the ruble last traded through the Moscow-
based Micex-RTS Exchange on May 5. Russia was closed for public
holidays from May 7 to May 9.  Greece  may have to hold another
election as early as next month as coalition talks remain
deadlocked, signaling the country may risk exiting the euro. The
European Union is Russia’s largest trading partner.  Russia’s central bank refrained from cutting  interest rates 
for a fifth month, leaving the  refinancing rate  at 8 percent,
according to a statement on its website today. The overnight
auction-based repurchase rate was held at 5.25 percent and the
overnight deposit rate will remain at 4 percent.  The ruble weakened 0.1 percent to 39.035 per euro and 0.6
percent to 34.1263 against the central bank’s target dollar-euro
basket. Investors increased bets on the currency weakening, with
non-deliverable forwards showing the ruble at 30.5303 per dollar
in three months, compared with expectations of 30.6097 per
dollar yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
