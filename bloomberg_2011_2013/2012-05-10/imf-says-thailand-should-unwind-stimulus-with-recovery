The  International Monetary Fund  said
Thailand should be ready to increase  interest rates  and exit
fiscal stimulus when the recovery strengthens.  “Directors agreed that the current expansionary fiscal and
monetary stances are appropriate in the context of weak world
demand and muted inflationary pressures,” the IMF said in an e-
mailed statement today following an April 27 meeting on
Thailand.  “The authorities should unwind the supportive policy
stance as the recovery takes hold and move to a medium-term
consolidation path consistent with low inflation and fiscal
sustainability.”  The  Bank of Thailand  has kept its benchmark rate unchanged
at its past two meetings, resisting pressure from the government
to resume cuts in borrowing costs to help businesses recover
from floods that swamped thousands of factories in the fourth
quarter of last year. While inflation slowed in April to the
lowest in more than two years, rising wage and oil costs are
reviving price pressures.  The IMF expects  Thailand ’s growth to accelerate to 5.5
percent this year from 0.1 percent in 2011. It sees
“significant risks” to the outlook as the country remains
vulnerable to contagion from the European debt turmoil, weak
growth in trading partners and domestic political tensions, “if
they were to be renewed.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
