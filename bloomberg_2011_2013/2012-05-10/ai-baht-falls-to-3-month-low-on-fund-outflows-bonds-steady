Thailand’s baht dropped to its
weakest level in more than three months after global funds cut
holdings of the nation’s assets.  Government bonds  were little
changed.  International investors  sold  $76 million more local
equities than they bought yesterday and pulled a net $165
million from government debt, according to data from the stock
exchange and the Thai Bond Market Association. The  Dollar Index 
traded on ICE Futures in  New York  rose for a fourth consecutive
day as investors sought the relative safety of the U.S. currency
on uncertainty surrounding the formation of a government in
 Greece  following elections over the weekend.  “Foreign investors’ selling of the stocks and bonds
weighed on the baht,” said Korawarin Prateepawanit, a currency
trader at RHB Bank in Bangkok. “The dollar got support from
uncertainties in the euro-zone political situation.”  The baht traded at 31.11 per dollar as of 8:33 a.m. in
Bangkok, compared with 31.10 yesterday, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. It touched 31.15 earlier, the weakest
level since Jan. 31.  One-month implied volatility, a measure of foreign-exchange
swings used to price options, was unchanged at 4.52 percent.  The yield on the 3.25 percent bonds due June 2017 was
little changed at 3.63 percent, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
