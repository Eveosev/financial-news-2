China ’s stocks pared gains after
export and import growth trailed economists’ estimates last
month.  The Shanghai Composite Index rose 0.1 percent to 2,410.47
at 11:09 a.m. local time, after gaining as much as 0.4 percent
earlier. The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index slid 1.1 percent.  China’s exports rose 4.9 percent in April from a year
earlier while imports increased 0.3 percent, resulting in a
trade surplus of $18.42 billion, the customs bureau said today.  The growth in overseas shipments compares with the 8.5
percent median estimate of 33 analysts in a Bloomberg News
survey. Economists forecast import gains of 10.9 percent and a
trade surplus of $9.9 billion.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
