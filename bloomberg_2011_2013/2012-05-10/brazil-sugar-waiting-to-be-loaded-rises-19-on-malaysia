The amount of sugar waiting to be
loaded at ports in Brazil, the world’s largest producer, climbed
by 19 percent over the past week, with Malaysia and Algeria
buying, according to Williams Servicos Maritimos Ltda.  Vessels at Brazil’s main ports were waiting to load 1.015
million metric tons of sugar as of yesterday, data from the
shipping agency show. That compares with 855,755 tons a week
earlier. Malaysia and Algeria were the biggest destinations,
followed by ports in the  Black Sea region , the data show.  Ships bound to Malaysia will carry 108,000 tons, while
Algeria’s scheduled shipments totaled 103,350 tons, according to
Williams Brasil. Vessels were also set to sail with 93,100 tons
to ports in the Black Sea region, 78,250 tons to  Egypt  and
59,905 tons to Morocco, the data show.  “There is talk of demand popping up again,”  Michael McDougall , a senior director and head of the Brazil desk at
Newedge Group in  New York , said in a report e-mailed today.
“Malaysia is the name being mentioned a lot recently,” he
said, adding that Morocco and other buyers were also said to be
purchasing.  Brazil is attracting sugar demand from  Asia  because of high
premiums to obtain the sweetener in Thailand, the world’s
second-biggest exporter, according to Newedge. The South
American country’s sugar cane crop will recover to 509 million
tons this season, up from 493.3 million tons last year, industry
group Unica estimates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
