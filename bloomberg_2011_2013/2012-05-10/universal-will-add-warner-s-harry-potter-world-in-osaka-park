Universal Studios Japan, owned by a
 Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  unit, will invest about 45 billion yen
($565 million) to add the Wizarding World of  Harry Potter  to its
Osaka theme park to lure visitors.  The exhibit is set to open in 2014 and will be based on
stories created by  J.K. Rowling  in her best-selling books made
into films by Warner Bros. and into a similar feature at
Universal Orlando Resort in Florida, according to a joint
statement from Warner and Universal today.  The attraction is expected to draw “millions” of
customers, Tsuyoshi Morioka, USJ chief marketing officer, said
today in Osaka. He declined to give targets for revenue or
visitors. The operator also expects the Wizarding World to draw
tourists from overseas, about half from  China , he said.  USJ Co. operator of the Universal Studios Japan park was
acquired by the Goldman unit SG Investments K.K. in 2009.  Adding the feature in Osaka will create 480,000 new jobs in
Japan over 10 years, President Glenn Gumpel told reporters today
in Osaka.  To contact the reporter on this story:
