Fortress Investment Group LLC (FIG) , the
first publicly traded private-equity and hedge fund manager in
the U.S., said it will close its commodities fund on or around
May 23 and return the money to investors after losing almost 13
percent in the past four months.  Fortress Commodities Fund LP declined 4.2 percent in April
and fell 13 percent since the start of the year through April
30, New York-based Fortress said in a May 8 regulatory filing
with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  The fund, started in 2008, invests in energy, metals,
grains, freight and emissions, according to Fortress’s  website .
It had $1.1 billion under management at its start and $500
million as of last quarter.  Fortress last week reported first-quarter profit of
$57 million, down 45 percent from a year earlier. The decline
was driven by lower management fees and incentive income. The
stock has declined 81 percent since the firm’s 2007 initial
offering and gained 1.5 percent this year before today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
