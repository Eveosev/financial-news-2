Development banks, sovereign wealth
funds and export lenders will need to help fill a project-
financing gap in Africa left by European banks reducing their
exposure to the continent, said Ahmed Heikal, chairman of
 Citadel Capital SAE. (CCAP)   The “triple combo” is needed to “replace the shrinking role
of European banks in the period to come,” Heikal said today in
an interview at the  World Economic Forum  on Africa in Addis
Ababa, Ethiopia’s capital. “Commercial banks that are based in
Europe that used to finance projects are going to face a tough
time and Africa could suffer as a result of that.”  Citadel is an Egyptian private equity company with an
investment portfolio worth $10 billion, with assets in African
nations including Kenya, Uganda, Sudan and South Sudan, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
