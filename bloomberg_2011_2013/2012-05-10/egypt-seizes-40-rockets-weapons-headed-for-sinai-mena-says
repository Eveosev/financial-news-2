Egyptian security forces seized a
weapons cache that included dozens of rockets, assault rifles
ammunition and vehicles, the state-run Middle East  News Agency 
reported, citing an Interior Ministry official.  The arsenal was believed to be headed for Sinai, where
police and military forces earlier in the week launched a broad
operation, the Cairo-based agency said, citing unidentified
officials. The decision followed a series of attacks on security
personnel in the peninsula over the past few weeks.  Authorities said the cache included 40 surface-to-surface
rockets, thousands of rounds of ammunition and 36 disassembled
rockets, MENA said. Three people were arrested in the operation,
it said.  The security officials said the type of weapons intercepted
indicated that they were intended for confrontations with
military forces, according to MENA.  To contact the reporter on this story:
