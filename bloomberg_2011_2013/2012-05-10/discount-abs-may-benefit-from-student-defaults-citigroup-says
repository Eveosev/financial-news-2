Discounted asset-backed securities
tied to government-guaranteed student loans could benefit from
defaults, according to  Citigroup Inc. (C)   Defaults trigger government prepayments of loans taken out
through the Federal Family Education Loan Program and could
increase if the economic situation remains uncertain, Citigroup
analysts said in a report today. The acceleration of early
payments will reduce the weighted average life of the debt.  “Given currently low voluntary prepayments, defaults are a
major component of prepayment speeds,” according to the New
York-based analysts led by Mary Kane.  Relative yields on the government-guaranteed debt range
from 30 basis points to 105 basis points more than the London
interbank offered rate, according to Citigroup. Doubling the
current default rate would increase the spread by four basis
points to 24 basis points, according to Citigroup.  To contact the reporter on this story:
