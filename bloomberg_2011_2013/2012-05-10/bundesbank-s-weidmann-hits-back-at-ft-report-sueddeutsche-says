Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann
hit back at a Financial Times report that the bank is prepared
to accept higher inflation rates, the  Sueddeutsche Zeitung  said,
citing an interview.  Such reports are an “absurd discussion,” Weidmann is
quoted as saying. Weidmann said that while German inflation may
be higher than in the past, there is no danger as long as the
 European Central Bank  keeps the euro-area average at just below
2 percent, according to Sueddeutsche.  The FT reported yesterday that the Bundesbank was showing
signs of yielding to faster inflation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
