Marriot International Inc. (MAR)  will manage
two hotels that are under construction in Ethiopia’s capital,
 Addis Ababa , as the company expands in the region, said Alex Kyriakidis, the company’s  Middle East  and Africa president.  Bethesda, Maryland-based Marriot’s capital partners are
investing $1.3 billion in 13 hotels on the continent, adding to
the eight it already manages, he said in an interview in Addis
Ababa, at the  World Economic Forum on Africa . Marriot is
targeting annual revenue growth of 25 percent from Middle East
and Africa, said Kyriakidis.  The Marriot Executive Apartments and 209-room Courtyard by
Marriot are owned, constructed and financed by Addis Ababa-based
Sunshine Construction (Pvt) Ltd., he said. The properties may
generate 1 billion Ethiopian birr ($57 million) over the first
five years, said Kyriakidis.  The self-catering apartments may be finished in the third
quarter of next year, while the Courtyard hotel is scheduled to
be completed by early 2015, he said.  Marriot is also focusing on  Benin , Gabon, Ghana, Nigeria
and Rwanda on the continent, the company said in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
