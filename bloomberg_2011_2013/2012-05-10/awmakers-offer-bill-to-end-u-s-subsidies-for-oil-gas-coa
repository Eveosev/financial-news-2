Senator  Bernie Sanders  and
Representative  Keith Ellison  introduced legislation to repeal
U.S. subsidies that benefit oil, gas and coal companies.  The bill would end tax breaks, relief from royalty
payments, and direct federal spending on fossil-fuel research
and development valued at about $113 billion over 10 years,
according to Sanders, a Vermont independent who often votes with
Democrats, and Ellison, a Minnesota Democrat.  Paying subsidies to “hugely profitable” fossil-fuel
companies is an “absurdity,” Sanders said today at a
Washington news conference.  To contact the reporter on this story:
