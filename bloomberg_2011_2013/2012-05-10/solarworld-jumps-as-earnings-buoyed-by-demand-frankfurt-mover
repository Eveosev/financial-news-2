Solarworld AG (SWV) ,  Germany ’s biggest
solar-panel maker, surged the most in six months in Frankfurt
trading after reporting first-quarter results that were almost
twice as high as analyst estimates.  Solarworld jumped 13 percent to 1.856 euros a share at the
5:30 p.m. close, the steepest one-day increase since Nov. 11,
after earnings before interest and taxes increased to 31.5
million euros ($41 million), topping analysts’ 16.9 million-euro
estimate.  “In Germany, our results were affected by pull-forward
effects in the first three months, which were once again
triggered by politics,” Chief Executive Officer Frank Asbeck
said in a statement about the strong demand in its home market.  Germany’s plan to reduce solar subsidies starting April 1
after an installation boom last year caused panel demand to jump
in the quarter. The cuts, meanwhile, put longer-term pressure on
domestic manufacturers already suffering from depressed margins
as Chinese rivals grab market share.  Solarworld’s EBIT result “seems to include high positive
one-offs,” Sven-Olaf Kuerten, an analyst with  DZ Bank , said in
an e-mailed note.  While the earnings were a “positive surprise,” they
“come with a major catch, namely that Solarworld’s wafer
business totally collapsed in Q1,” Katharina Cholewa, an
analyst with WestLB AG, said in an e-mailed note. Both analysts
reiterated their “sell” rating.  To contact the reporter on this story:
