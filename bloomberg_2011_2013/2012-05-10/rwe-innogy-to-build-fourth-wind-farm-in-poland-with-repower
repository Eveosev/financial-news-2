RWE AG (RWE) ,  Germany ’s second-biggest
utility, will build a 60 million euro ($78 Million) wind farm in
Poland using turbines made by  Suzlon Energy Ltd. (SUEL) ’s Repower
Systems SE unit, adding to its wind operations in the country.  The development near the city of Gdansk will produce enough
power for more than 50,000 homes a year when completed,
potentially in early 2013, the utility’s renewables unit RWE
Innogy GmbH said today in a  statement  on its website.  The 39-megawatt project in Nowy Staw, northern Poland, will
use 19 Repower turbines, according to the statement. RWE Innogy
plans to build 50 megawatts of wind a year in Poland to reach
300 megawatts by 2015, it said. It operates 108 megawatts now.  The project is RWE Innogy’s fourth in  Poland  as the nation
lures investors such as EON AG and CEZ AS by offering clean
power incentives through a green certificate program to bolster
alternative energy. Poland may install as much as 13 gigawatts
of wind power by 2020, the Polish Wind Energy Association says.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
