The Minnesota Legislature gave its
final approval on a $975 million stadium plan for the National
Football League’s Vikings that requires the team to pay almost
half the cost.  The bill passed the state House 71-60 at 3:30 this morning
and later cleared the Senate 38-28. It now goes to Governor  Mark
Dayton  to sign into law.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
