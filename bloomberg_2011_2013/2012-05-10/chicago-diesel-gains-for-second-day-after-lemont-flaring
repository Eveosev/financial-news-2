Chicago diesel strengthened for a
second day after Citgo Petroleum Corp. experienced issues at its
Lemont, Illinois, refinery.  The plant released an unknown amount of natural gas and
propane from a flare after a “power blip” at Lemont, a filing
May 8 with the U.S. National Response Center showed.  Prices also dropped because  BP Plc (BP/)  sold the fuel on May 4,
Steve Mosby, vice president of supply consultant ADMO Energy LLC
in Kansas City, Missouri, said in a telephone interview.  The discount for ultra-low-sulfur diesel in Chicago versus
heating oil traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  narrowed
5.5 cents to 4 cents a gallon at 12:44 p.m., according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Prompt delivery rose 3.44 cents to
$2.9935 a gallon.  Sunoco Inc. (SUN)  won’t have an estimate for the restart of a
200,000-barrel-a-day crude unit at its Philadelphia refinery
until damage from a fire yesterday is inspected, according to a
person familiar with plant operations.  The discount for conventional gasoline to be blended with
ethanol, or CBOB, in  New York  Harbor narrowed 3.5 cents to 3.5
cents a gallon.  To contact the reporter on this story:
