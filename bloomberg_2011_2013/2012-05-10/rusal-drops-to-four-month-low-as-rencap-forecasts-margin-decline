United Co. Rusal, the world’s largest
aluminum producer, fell to a four-month low as  Renaissance
Capital  forecast a 5 percent decline in margins from the
previous quarter.  Rusal lost 1.3 percent to 196.98 rubles by the end of
trading in Moscow, the lowest level since Jan. 10.  “The rising oil price and resulting strong ruble will
squeeze already thin earnings before interest, tax, depreciation
and amortization margins, which we expect to fall from 14
percent to 9 percent quarter-over-quarter,” Andrew Jones, an
analyst at Renaissance Capital, said in an e-mailed report
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
