A Greek court rejected a request by a
Russian investment fund to issue an injunction putting on hold
the sale of the countryâ€™s natural gas company, the state agency
running the sale said in an e-mailed statement.  The tender for selling state-controlled natural gas
supplier Depa SA and its fully owned Desfa SA gas-grid unit is
continuing without delays, the Hellenic Republic Asset
Development Fund said in the statement.  Fund Energy, which is owned by former Russian Energy
Minister and  OAO Gazprom (GAZP)  director Igor Yusufov, lodged the
appeal after it was excluded from a list of 14 investors that
qualified to move to the next stage of the tender last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
