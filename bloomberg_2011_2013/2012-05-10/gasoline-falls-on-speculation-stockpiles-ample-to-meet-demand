Gasoline declined for the first time
in three days on speculation that inventories are ample to meet
consumption during the U.S. summer driving season.  Futures fell as  stockpiles  as of May 4 were 0.6 percent
higher than a year earlier and demand over the past four weeks
was 3.2 percent lower than the same period in 2011, according to
Energy Department data. The May 28 Memorial Day holiday is the
traditional start of the summer driving season. Futures rose
earlier after U.S. jobless claims slipped last week.  “The jobs report gave us a bit of a bounce, but we know
the market is oversupplied,” said  Phil Flynn , vice president of
research at PFGBest in  Chicago .  Gasoline for June delivery fell 1.39 cents, or 0.5 percent,
to settle at $3.0102 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange , after touching $3.0249.  Gasoline has lost 12 percent since reaching a 2012 high of
$3.4166 on March 26. The fuel has pared its year-to-date gain to
12 percent from 27 percent.  First-time  claims  for jobless benefits declined to a one-
month low of 367,000 last week, the Labor Department said today.
The number of people on unemployment benefit rolls was the
smallest since July 2008.  Gasoline stockpiles  fell 2.61 million barrels to 207.1
million in the week ended May 4, according to department data.
Inventories, which have dropped 11 percent in 12 weeks to the
lowest level since November, are above a year ago when they
totaled 205.8 million barrels. Refiners raised gasoline output
to 9.09 million barrels a day, the highest level since Dec. 23.  ‘Adequately Supplied’  “The market is more than adequately supplied and the
geopolitical risk is the lowest it’s been in months,” said
Dominick Chirichella, senior partner at the Energy Management
Institute in  New York .  Future deepened losses as the dollar pared an earlier
decline, making commodities less attractive to investors, and
equities retreated from their highs of the day. The dollar was
down 0.1 percent against the euro at 3:25 p.m. in New York,
after earlier losing 0.4 percent. The Standard & Poor’s 500
Index was up 0.4 percent, after an earlier gain of 0.8 percent.  “The macro sentiment seems to have shifted,” said  Addison Armstrong , director of market research at Tradition Energy in
 Stamford ,  Connecticut . “The dollar is moving up and the S&P is
coming off.”  June-delivery heating oil sank 1.57 cents, or 0.5 percent,
to settle at $2.9834 a gallon on the exchange.  Regular gasoline  at the pump, averaged nationwide, fell 1.1
cents to $3.739 a gallon yesterday, according to AAA. That’s the
lowest average since Feb. 29. Prices are down 19.7 cents since
reaching a 2012 high of $3.936 on April 4. Gasoline peaked in
2011 at $3.985 on May 4.  To contact the reporter on this story:
