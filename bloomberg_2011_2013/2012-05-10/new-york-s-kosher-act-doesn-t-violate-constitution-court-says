A  New York  law regulating the
marketing and labeling of kosher food doesn’t violate the U.S.
Constitution, a federal appeals court ruled, rejecting a First
Amendment challenge.  A three-judge panel of the court in New York today affirmed
a lower-court ruling that upheld the law, which replaced an
earlier version the court overturned in 2002. The appeals court
said the Kosher Law Protection Act of 2004 doesn’t violate First
Amendment provisions restricting laws relating to religion.  “The Kosher Act merely requires food products marketed as
kosher to be labeled as kosher,” U.S. Circuit Judge Christopher Droney wrote. “The Kosher Act does not entangle the state with
religion because it does not require the state to enforce laws
based on religious doctrine or to inquire into the religious
content or religious nature of the products sold.”  The court also rejected a challenge to the law as
unconstitutionally vague.  The appeal was filed by a Long Island butcher shop and
delicatessen, Commack Self-Service Kosher Meats Inc.  The case is Commack Self-Service Kosher Meats v. Hooker,
11-3517,  U.S. Court of Appeals  for the Second Circuit
( Manhattan ).  To contact the reporter on this story:
