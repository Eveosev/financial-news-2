Standard & Poor’s Ratings
Services said that its forecast for states is stronger
than for local governments.  States are more dependent upon income taxes while local
governments are more dependent on property taxes, which have
not yet recovered from the drops of the past four years, the
ratings service said today in statement.  The forecast is contained in S&P’s report “Sector Economic
and Credit Conditions Forecast: U.S. State and Local Governments
to See Gradual but Uneven Revenue Improvement.” The report was
published today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
