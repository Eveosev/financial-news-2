said Ray Attrill has left his position as senior currency
strategist in  New York  to move back to Australia.  Attrill, who joined BNP in July as the head of currency
strategy for  North America , departed the firm last week, said
Cesaltine Gregorio, a BNP spokeswoman. No successor has been
named, she said.  Attrill joined BNP Paribas from 4Cast Ltd., a macroeconomic
