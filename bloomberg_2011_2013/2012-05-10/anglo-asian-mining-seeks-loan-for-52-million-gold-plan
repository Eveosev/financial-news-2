Anglo Asian Mining Plc (AAZ) , an  Azerbaijan 
gold and copper mining company, is in talks with local and
international lenders for a loan to build a new $52 million
plant, according to a statement from the company.  The agitation and leaching facility will improve gold
recovery rates at Anglo Asian Miningâ€™s Gedabek mine in western
Azerbaijan, the Baku-based company said.  Anglo Asian Mining got a $9.4 million term loan from the
International Bank of the Republic of Azerbaijan in May 2009,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
