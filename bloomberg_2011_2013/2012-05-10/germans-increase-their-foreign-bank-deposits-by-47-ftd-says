German savers increased the amount
they have deposited in foreign-based banks by almost half in the
past year,  Financial Times Deutschland  reported in a preview of
an article to be published tomorrow, citing its own
calculations.  In the 12 months from April last year, Germans increased
their deposits in non-German banks by 21.6 billion euros ($28
billion) to 67 billion euros, FTD said. German savings banks, or
Sparkassen, meanwhile, took in 17.8 billion euros, according to
the newspaper.  More than 5 billion euros was deposited with  Bank of
Scotland Plc , close to 2 billion with ABN Amro Bank NV, and just
since last autumn, Russiaâ€™s VTB Direktbank has received close to
1 billion euros, FTD said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
