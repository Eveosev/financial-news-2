European Union Trade Commissioner
Karel  De Gucht  said the bloc needs to do more to help companies
file trade complaints against  China  and other state-run
economies without fear of retaliation.  “It is undeniable that many European companies are
unwilling to come forward and make justified trade defense
complaints due to fear of consequences for their business,” De
Gucht said in a speech in Brussels today.  The EU is considering ways to start trade complaints on its
own initiative, without a formal complaint from affected
companies, De Gucht said. Companies would still need
encouragement to work with the commission on the cases, which
investigate whether goods are being sold into the 27-nation bloc
below cost in a practice known as dumping.  If the EU were to begin pursuing its own complaints, “no
government could blame a European company for the launch of the
case,” De Gucht said. “The flip side, of course, is that we
would need tough rules to oblige reticent companies to cooperate
with us.”  The EU in April launched a public consultation on ways to
modernize its trade complaint procedures. A formal proposal
could come later this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
