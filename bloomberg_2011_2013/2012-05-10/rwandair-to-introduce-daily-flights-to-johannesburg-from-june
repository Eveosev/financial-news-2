RwandAir,  Rwanda ’s national carrier,
will start daily flights to Johannesburg next month, Chief
Executive Officer John Mirenge said.  The airline is increasing frequencies to the South African
city to seven flights a week from June 10, Mirenge said in a
telephone interview today from Kigali, the capital.  “This is a way of adding more connectivity to our clients,”
Mirenge said. The new flights will allow business travelers to
fly at night and have the day to do business, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
