Soybean growers in  Brazil , the
world’s second-largest producer, will harvest more than
previously forecast, the government said.  The outlook for the crop year that started Sept. 1 was
raised to 66.7 million metric tons from 65.6 million tons
estimated on April 10, the Agriculture Ministry’s crop-
forecasting agency, known as Conab, said in a report today.
Production will fall from 75.3 million tons in the previous crop
year.  The forecast for corn output was raised to 65.9 million
tons from 65.1 million tons. Brazil, the world’s third-largest
grower of the grain, produced 57.4 million tons of corn in the
previous crop year.  The U.S. is the world’s largest producer of soybeans and
corn.  China  is the world’s second-biggest corn grower.  To contact the reporters on this story:
