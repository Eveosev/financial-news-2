Residual-fuel inventories in
Singapore,  Asia ’s biggest oil-trading, refining and storage
center, rose to the highest in four weeks, according to a unit
of the Ministry of Trade and Industry.  Onshore stockpiles including  fuel oil  and low-sulfur waxy
residue and excluding bitumen gained 642,000 barrels, or 3.3
percent, to 19.87 million in the seven days to yesterday,
 International Enterprise Singapore  said in an e-mailed
statement. That’s the highest since the week to April 11.  Middle-distillate supplies including gasoil, or diesel, and
kerosene rose for a second week, gaining 1.08 million barrels,
or 12 percent, to 10.01 million, the ministry’s data showed.  Stockpiles of  light distillates  including naphtha, gasoline
and reformate declined 188,000 barrels to 10.21 million,
according to the data. That’s the lowest in six weeks.  The trade ministry surveys refiners, traders and storage
terminals on a voluntary basis. The results may exclude offshore
storage capacity, International Enterprise said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
