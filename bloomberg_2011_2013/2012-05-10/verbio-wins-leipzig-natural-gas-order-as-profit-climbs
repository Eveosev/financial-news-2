Verbio AG (VBK) , a German biofuels company,
will supply all eight natural-gas car filling stations in the
eastern German city of Leipzig with fuel made from farm waste.  An agreement with the city’s municipal utility was reached
at a conference in Berlin last month, Chief Executive Officer
Claus Sauter said today in a phone interview. “We’re winning
more and more municipal utilities as customers and we’re in
negotiations with several more,” Sauter said.  The deals will increase income for the company, which today
said revenue rose 41 percent to 201 million euros ($261 million)
in the first quarter from a year before on sales of biodiesel
and bioethanol, a motor-fuel additive. Net income gained to 2.1
million euros, from 2 million euros, it said in a statement.  The European Union aims to get 10 percent of transportation
fuel from renewable sources by 2020 to cut fossil-fuel imports
and curb pollution. Verbio in March opened what it said was the
world’s first straw-to-biomethane plant and is building plants
that will allow it to sell its renewable gas as a vehicle fuel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
