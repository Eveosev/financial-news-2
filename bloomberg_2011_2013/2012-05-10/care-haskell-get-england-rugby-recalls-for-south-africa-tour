Danny Care  and  James Haskell  were
recalled to the England rugby team for next month’s tour of
South Africa.  Coach Stuart Lancaster selected 13 uncapped players for the
42-man squad, which will be lead by captain Chris Robshaw. Care
returns after being left off England’s Six Nations squad in
January for disciplinary reasons, while Haskell was unavailable
because he was playing in  New Zealand .  “There is a real excitement about this squad,” Lancaster
said in a statement on the Rugby Football Union’s website. “We
have a massive challenge ahead of us, but it is one that
everybody involved -- players, coaches and management -- is
looking forward to.”  England will play three Tests against two-time world
champion  South Africa  as part of its five-match tour June 9 to
23.  To contact the reporter on this story:
