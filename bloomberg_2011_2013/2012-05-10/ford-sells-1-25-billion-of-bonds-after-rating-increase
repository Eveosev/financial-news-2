Ford Motor Co. (F) , the second-biggest
U.S. carmaker, issued $1.25 billion of three-year notes, its
biggest sale in six months, two weeks after  Fitch Ratings  raised
the company’s credit ranking to investment grade.  The company sold 2.75 percent senior bonds to yield 238
basis points more than equivalent Treasuries, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Proceeds will be used for general
corporate purposes, according to a person familiar with the
offering. The company last issued more than $100 million of
dollar-denominated debt in January, when the Dearborn, Michigan-
based automaker sold $1 billion of 4.25 percent notes maturing
in 2017, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Fitch cited improved  earnings , reduced pension costs and
cash on hand as it raised Ford, which Moody’s Investors Service
and  Standard & Poor’s  still rate as junk, to BBB- on April 24,
the first time since 2005 that the biggest high-yield issuer has
been  ranked above speculative-grade  by any of the three largest
ratings firms.  Chief Executive Officer Alan Mulally has sought to restore
Ford’s  investment-grade  rating to reduce borrowing costs and
attempt to recover major assets put up for collateral as the
company borrowed $23.4 billion in late 2006 to avoid the
bailouts and bankruptcies that befell the predecessors of
 General Motors Co. (GM)  and Chrysler Group LLC.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc., HSBC Holdings Plc, Morgan Stanley
and Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc managed the sale, Bloomberg
data show.  Ford, which in October sold $1.55 billion of 3.875 percent
bonds maturing in 2015,  trails  General Motors among U.S.-based
automakers in industry revenue.  To contact the reporter on this story:
