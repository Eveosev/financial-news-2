Puerto Rico , which has a lower  credit
rating  than any U.S. state, plans to eliminate borrowing to
close budget deficits by fiscal 2014.  The governor’s $9.08 billion 2013 budget proposal includes
a $933 million funding gap, down from the $1.4 billion shortfall
for the year ending June 30, said Juan Carlos Batlle, president
of the Government Development Bank for Puerto Rico. He spoke at
the Puerto Rico Credit Conference in  San Juan .  Puerto Rico will restructure debt to push off $600 million
of principal and interest payments due in fiscal 2013, Batlle
said. That is on top of a $333 million budget deficit that the
administration plans to close, in part, by using its sales-tax
credit to borrow $100 million from a bank rather than selling
municipal debt, he said.  The 2012 budget included a $610 million gap and the
commonwealth restructured debt to skip about $800 million of
debt-service payments this year. Puerto Rico will end its
practice of borrowing to balance spending in fiscal 2014, Batlle
said.  “That will eliminate the need to issue additional debt and
we’ll only have to use debt either for refunding purposes for
savings, or money for infrastructure projects like roads and
bridges and whatever we need,” he said in an interview at the
conference.  Moody’s Investors Service rates Puerto Rico’s general-
obligation debt Baa1, three steps above speculative grade, with
a negative outlook.  “They are making efforts to get closer to structural
balance,” a Moody’s analyst, Emily Raimes, said in an interview
at the conference. “They are taking the steps to getting
there.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
