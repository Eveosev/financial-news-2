51job Inc. and  7 Days Group Holdings
Ltd. (SVN)  fell in  New York , pushing an index of Chinese stocks in the
U.S. to the lowest level in more than three months, as the
companies pared sales forecasts on global economic concerns.  51job, a Shanghai-based recruiting service provider,
dropped the most since September, while 7 Day Group, a hotel
operator, sank to the least in 21 months. The  Bloomberg China-US
Equity Index (CH55BN)  of the most traded Chinese companies in the U.S.
fell 0.3 percent to 98.37, the weakest close since Jan. 24.  Average sales per share for the 55 companies in the China-
US index will drop in the second quarter to the weakest in two
years, according to  data compiled by Bloomberg .  51job (JOBS)  forecast
slower revenue growth in the three months ended June, while
earnings guidance from 7 Days Group trailed analysts’ estimates.
Chinese exports and imports rose less than predicted in April as
the slowing economy and European debt crisis curbed trade.  51job “is one of the most economically-sensitive names in
 China ,” Jeff Papp, senior analyst at Oberweis Asset Management
Inc. in Lisle, Illinois, which manages $700 million, said in a
phone interview. “With the economy still in the process of
bottoming, small and medium-sized enterprises appear to be
pulling back, and investors are reacting to that trend.”  The  IShares FTSE China 25 Index Fund (FXI) , the biggest Chinese
exchange-traded fund in the U.S., lost 0.3 percent to $35.81,
the lowest since April 10. The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  added
0.3 percent, while the  Shanghai Composite Index of mainland
stocks  climbed 0.1 percent.  American depositary receipts of  PetroChina Co. (PTR) , the
nation’s largest oil producer, declined 0.3 percent to $135.91.
The company’s ADRs traded 0.3 percent higher than its equivalent
shares in Hong Kong.  51job Tumbles  51job sank 8.3 percent, the most since Sept. 30, to $51.30.
Second-quarter sales will be between $57.2 million and $59.5
million in the second quarter, compared with revenue of $60.5
million in the first three months of this year, the company said
in a statement after markets closed on May 9. Adjusted earnings
per share will be between 60 cents and 65 cents, 51job said
after posting net income of 71 cents for the first quarter.  Concern over China’s slowing economy is “clearly casting a
shadow over enterprises in their hiring activities,” said Chief
Executive Officer Rick Yan on a conference call with analysts
after the earnings were released.  7 Days Group, a budget hotel operator based in Guangzhou,
China, fell 5.7 percent to $10.88, the lowest close since July
2010. Sales will climb to as much as 640 million  yuan  ($101
million) in the three month ending in June from 546 million yuan
in the previous quarter, the company said on May 9. The median 
forecast  of seven analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was for an
increase to 647 million yuan.  Trade Slowdown  Chinese imports and exports grew in April less than
economists expected, fueling concern that the economy may not
have recovered from the slowest growth in more than two years
posted in the first quarter.  Overseas shipments  rose 4.9 percent
from a year earlier, compared with the 8.5 percent increase that
was the median estimate of 33 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.
Import growth of 0.3 percent trailed forecasts for a 10.9
percent gain.  “The risk of a hard landing is disappearing but I don’t
expect much of a rebound at this point,” Tao Dong, chief
regional economist at Credit Suisse AG said in an interview on
Bloomberg Television from  Hong Kong . “Anybody who is counting
on China to have a strong rebound because of organic demand will
be disappointed.”  Sales Per Share  Average revenue per share for Chinese companies in the
Bloomberg China-US gauge may decline to $10.10, the lowest level
since the second quarter of 2010, from $11.70 in the first three
months of this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Of the 23 companies on the China-US index that have
reported quarterly earnings since April 1, 10 fell short of
analysts’ predictions, from  Yanzhou Coal Mining Co. (YZC) , China’s
fourth-largest producer, and  China Telecom Corp. (CHA) , the nation’s
biggest fixed-line carrier, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  China Lodging Group Ltd (HTHT) , another budget hotel operator
based in Shanghai, climbed 1.3 percent to $12.50 in the U.S.
yesterday, after posting a first-quarter adjusted loss per share
that was smaller than analysts’ forecast. The shares are
“fairly valued,” analysts at T.H. Capital LLC wrote in a note
to clients yesterday. Analysts led by Chenyi Lu at Cowen & Co.
maintained their neutral rating.  Feihe International Inc. (ADY) , a Beijing-based producer of
infant formula, soared 49 percent, the most in three years, to
$8.74 after posting first-quarter profit that beat estimates.
Trading volume was 12 times Feihe’s three-month average.  Sands China Ltd. (1928) , the Hong Kong-listed unit of billionaire
 Sheldon Adelson ’s Las Vegas-based company, gained 2.3 percent to
$37.89 in New York trading.  The company will list on the  Hang Seng Index  to become its
49th member company, effective June 4, index provider Hang Seng
Indexes Co. said in an e-mailed statement yesterday.  To contact the reporters on this story:
