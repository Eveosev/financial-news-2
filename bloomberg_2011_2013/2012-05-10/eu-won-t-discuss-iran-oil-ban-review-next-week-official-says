European Union foreign ministers
won’t discuss at a meeting on May 14 a review of an embargo on
Iranian oil that is due to come into force at the beginning of
July, according to an EU official with knowledge of the matter.  At a meeting in Brussels today, EU diplomats agreed that
any potential questions from a member state on exemptions for
existing oil contracts and some insurance may be put forward in
June, before the next ministerial meeting, said the official,
who declined to be identified, quoting policy.  The EU decided in January to ban imports of oil from the
Persian Gulf nation and prohibit the insurance of contracts for
shipments of Iranian oil as part of measures to ratchet up the
pressure on  Iran’s nuclear program .  EU governments approved exemptions until July 1 for
existing contracts and insurance related to them as well as for
third-party liability insurance and environmental-liability
insurance and agreed they could be subject to a review.  To contact the reporter on this story:
