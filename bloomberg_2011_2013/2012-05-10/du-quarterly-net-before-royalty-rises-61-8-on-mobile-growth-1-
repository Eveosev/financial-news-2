Emirates Integrated
Telecommunications Co. (DU) , known as Du, said first-quarter net
profit before royalty surged 61.8 percent as revenues from
mobile and data services grew.  Net income for the period rose to 666 million dirhams ($181
million) from 412 million dirhams in the same period last year,
the company said in a filing to the  Dubai Financial Market .
Revenue from mobile increased 21.8 percent to 1.9 billion
dirhams.  The  average estimate  of three analysts was for a profit of
260 million dirhams, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The company booked 50 percent of its profit as a provision for
royalty payment to the government, it said.  Du competes with  Emirates Telecommunications Corp. (ETISALAT) , also

2007.  Duâ€™s total revenue increased 20 percent in the quarter to
2.4 billion dirhams, it said. The telephone company added
320,600 mobile subscriptions in the period, bringing its number
