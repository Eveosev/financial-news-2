Saudi Arabian Oil Minister Ali al- Naimi will visit Australia tomorrow, the official Saudi Press
Agency said.  He is scheduled to speak at the Australian Petroleum
Production and Exploration Association conference on May 14,
according to the event  program . Other speakers at the meeting
include Christophe de Margerie, chief executive officer of Total
SA, and the Executive Director of the International Energy
Agency Maria Van der Hoeven.  The oil minister of the world’s biggest crude exporter has
repeatedly said in recent weeks that prices are too high given
that there is no lack of supply. The kingdom produced 10.1
million barrels a day of oil last month, the highest in at least
30 years, as it seeks to calm prices.  Crude dropped for a seventh day in  New York , its longest
run of declines since December 2009. Futures for June delivery
fell as much as 73 cents to $96.08 a barrel in electronic
trading on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  and were at $96.49
as of 11:57 a.m. London time. It slid 20 cents yesterday to
$96.81, the lowest close since Feb. 2. Prices have fallen 2.4
percent this year.  The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, which
produces 40 percent of the world’s oil, said that global crude
supplies are outpacing demand levels. OPEC, scheduled to meet
next month to decide the group’s output levels, is producing 8.3
percent more than it considers necessary this quarter, data
released today by the Vienna-based group show.  Al-Naimi was in  Tokyo  this week for board meetings of Saudi
Arabian Oil Co., of which he is chairman.  To contact the reporter on this story:
