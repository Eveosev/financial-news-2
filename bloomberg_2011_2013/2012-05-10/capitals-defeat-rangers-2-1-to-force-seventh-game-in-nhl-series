The Washington Capitals won 2-1 to
force a decisive seventh game in their National Hockey League
playoff series against the  New York  Rangers.  Alex Ovechkin  scored on a power play after one minute, 28
seconds for the home team last night at Verizon Center in
Washington. It was Ovechkin’s 30th career playoff goal, tying
the franchise record held by Peter Bondra.  Jason Chimera got the second goal 11 minutes into the
second period. The Rangers scored with 51 seconds remaining in
the third when Marian Gaborik’s shot deflected in off the back
of Washington’s John Carlson.  “We caught some bad breaks in the last game, but these
guys worked their tails off tonight and got the job done,”
Washington coach Dale Hunter told reporters.  The Rangers are 4-0 in Game 7s at Madison Square Garden in
New York, which will host the decider on May 12. The winner will
advance to the Eastern Conference finals against the  New Jersey
Devils . This is the seventh playoff series between the Capitals
and Rangers, Washington having won four of them.  The Rangers haven’t reached the conference finals since
1997, a year before Washington’s last visit to the third round
of the playoffs.  The Devils won their second-round series against the
Philadelphia Flyers two nights ago to reach the conference
finals for the first time since 2003, when they won the  Stanley
Cup  for the third time in franchise history.  The Rangers won the Stanley Cup for a fourth time in 1994.
The Capitals lost in their only trip to the championship round
in 1998.  To contact the reporter on this story:
