Turkey â€™s parliament may pass
legislation that allows judges to free suspects jailed in a
series of coup-plot investigations, Sabah  reported .  A measure approved by a parliamentary committee in Ankara
would remove a restriction that says suspects must be remanded
in custody pending trial if the offense they are charged with
carries a maximum jail sentence of three years or more,
according to the Istanbul-based newspaper. About 36,000
prisoners would be covered by the bill, it said.  Turkish prosecutors are carrying out four separate probes
into military interventions in politics, ranging from the coup
of 1980 to alleged plots against the current administration of
 Recep Tayyip Erdogan . Current and former military officers,
three opposition lawmakers and several journalists and academics
are among those jailed during the investigations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
