Oaktree Capital Group LLC (OAK) , the
distressed-debt investor that went public last month, reported a
first-quarter profit after a loss a year earlier as it realized
more gains on investments.  Net income rose to $18.6 million, or 82 cents, from a loss
of $10.1 million, or 45 cents, a year earlier, Los Angeles-based
Oaktree said in a statement today. Assets under management rose
to $77.9 billion from $74.9 billion on Dec. 31 as the value of
holdings rose and the firm attracted $1.7 billion in new capital
commitments.  Oaktree is seeking to take advantage of  Europe ’s sovereign
debt crisis by buying distressed assets in the region. The firm
two months ago finished raising a 3 billion euro ($3.9 billion)
fund to buy controlling stakes in troubled European companies,
according to two people familiar with the results.  “Our diverse investment strategies and the large
proportion of our assets that consists of liquid securities
enabled us to capitalize on opportunities both to invest, as we
did in real estate, and to sell in strong markets, as our
distressed debt funds did,”  Howard Marks , the firm’s chairman
and co-founder, said in the statement.  Oaktree fell 0.9 percent to $41.08 at the close of trading
in New York. The stock has fallen 4.5 percent from its initial
public offering price of $43.  Oaktree raised $380 million in the offering, selling 8.84
million shares for $43 each, the bottom of the proposed range.
Marks has called the firm’s pitch to public investors “very
challenging.”  Fees Decline  Adjusted net income, a measure of profit excluding some
costs, fell to $173.6 million, or 90 cents a share, from $207.4
million, or $1.15, a year earlier, Oaktree said, attributing the
decline to lower tax-related distributions. Adjusted net income
excludes some expenses, including noncash equity compensation
and income taxes.  Management fees during the quarter fell 17 percent to $32
million, and incentive income declined 13 percent to $5.05
million. The net realized gain on investments increased 41
percent from a year earlier to $1.07 billion.  The firm will pay a distribution of 55 cents a unit to
shareholders on May 25, it said.  Oaktree expects to close on at least $4 billion this month
for its next distressed-debt fund, according to three
prospective investors. The fund had $1.2 billion in commitments
as of March 31, Oaktree said today. Oaktree will be able to
invest as much as half of the fund outside the U.S. and  Canada ,
according to marketing materials from October.  To contact the reporter on this story:
