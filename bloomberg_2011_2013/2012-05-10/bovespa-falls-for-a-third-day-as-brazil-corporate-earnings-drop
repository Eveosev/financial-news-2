The  Bovespa (IBOV)  index fell for a third
day after Brazilian companies reported lower profits and
consumer prices rose more than analysts expected.  Braskem SA,  Latin America ’s largest petrochemicals maker,
fell to the lowest since June 2010 after it said first-quarter
profit fell 50 percent as costs soared and a weaker real boosted
the value of its dollar-denominated debt. Telefonica Brasil SA,
 Brazil ’s largest phone company by revenue, declined to a two-
week low after its net income trailed analysts’ estimates.  The Bovespa retreated 0.1 percent to 59,702.05 at the close
in  Sao Paulo , after erasing an earlier gain of as much as 1.6
percent. Thirty-two stocks fell while 34 advanced. The real
strengthened 0.8 percent to 1.9548 per  U.S. dollar .  Among the 36 companies on the Bovespa index that have
already reported first-quarter earnings, 19  missed  analysts’
estimates, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “There is so much bad news affecting the Bovespa, like the
disappointing results from the companies,” Jose Luiz Garcia, a
portfolio manager at Mercatto Gestao de Recursos, said by phone
from  Rio de Janeiro . “Investors are expecting Petrobras’s
earnings, due tomorrow, to be weak too.”  Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PBR) , the state-run oil producer known as
Petrobras, fell 1.2 percent to 19.92 reais, the second-biggest
decline on the Bovespa.  The IGP-M index of wholesale, consumer and construction
prices rose 0.89 percent in the period that the Getulio Vargas
Foundation calls its first preview for May. The median forecast
of analysts in a Bloomberg News survey was for an increase of
0.70 percent.  Rate Cuts  Policy makers cut the benchmark lending rate by 75 basis
points, 0.75 percentage point, to 9 percent on April 18 to
revive growth that slowed to 2.7 percent last year from 7.5
percent in 2010. The central bank has lowered its target rate
350 basis points since August.  “Investors are expecting the central bank to keep cutting
 interest rates , which should help real estate and retail
companies,”   Pedro Galdi , an analyst at SLW Corretora, said by
phone from Sao Paulo. “But with rising inflation it might not
be the case anymore.”  Braskem slipped 4.6 percent to 12.55 reais. First-quarter
net income dropped to 152 million reais ($77.3 million) from 305
million reais a year earlier, the company said in a regulatory
filing today.  Telefonica Drops  Telefonica Brasil fell 1.1 percent to 54.10 reais. Net
income fell 15 percent to 956.6 million reais in the first
quarter, from 1.13 billion reais a year earlier, the Sao Paulo-
based phone company said in a regulatory filing. The average
estimate was for an adjusted profit of 1.03 billion reais,
according to six analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  The Bovespa has gained 5.2 percent in 2012, buoyed by local
interest-rate cuts and signs of expansion in the U.S. The
measure has fallen 13 percent since this year’s high on March 13
on concern Europe debt crisis is worsening and speculation a
slowdown in  China , Brazil’s biggest trading partner, may be
deeper than expected.  Trading volume was 6.07 billion reais in stocks in Sao
Paulo today, data compiled by Bloomberg say. That compares with
a daily average of 7.22 billion reais this year through May 8,
according to data from the exchange.  To contact the reporters on this story:
