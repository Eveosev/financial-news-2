China  Petrochemical Corp., the state-
owned petroleum explorer known as Sinopec Group, sold $3 billion
of debt in its first dollar-denominated bond sale in more than
15 years.  The company issued $1 billion portions each of 2.75 percent
five-year debt to yield 205 basis points more than similar-
maturity Treasuries, 3.9 percent 10-year bonds with a 210 basis-
point spread and 4.875 percent 30-year securities to yield 185
basis points more than benchmarks, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Sinopec is the fifth Chinese gas company to sell dollar
bonds this year after borrowers in  Asia  issued a record amount
of dollar-denominated debt in April while seeking funds to
expand in the world’s fastest-growing region  amid a drop  in
global sales.  Cnooc Ltd. (CEO) , China’s largest offshore oil producer,
sold $2 billion of 30-year notes April 25, the biggest such
offering by a Chinese company in more than a year, Bloomberg
data show.  Sinopec last sold dollar bonds in 1996, when it issued a
$200 million convertible note through Sinopec Zhenhai Refining &
Chemical Co., Bloomberg data show. The company has about 218
billion  yuan  ($34 billion) of debt outstanding. Proceeds from
the sale will be used for general corporate purposes in its
international businesses and to fund overseas expansion,
according to marketing materials obtained by Bloomberg News.  China National Petroleum Corp., Beijing Enterprises
Holdings Ltd. and China Resources Gas Group Ltd. have also
raised U.S. currency debt in 2012, Bloomberg data show.  China’s energy use increased at the fastest pace in four
years in 2011 as consumption of natural gas jumped 12 percent
and crude-oil use rose 2.7 percent, the statistics bureau said
in February.  Citigroup Inc., HSBC Holdings Plc, BOC International
Holdings Ltd., Barclays Plc, Goldman Sachs Group Inc., JPMorgan
Chase & Co., Mizuho Securities Co. and UBS AG managed the sale,
Bloomberg data show. Moody’s Investors Services is expected to
rate the securities Aa3, its fourth-highest grade.  To contact the reporter on this story:
