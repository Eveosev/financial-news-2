Republican presidential candidate
 Mitt Romney  set a tough economic benchmark when he said last
week that U.S. payroll growth of 500,000 jobs a month should be
“normal” in a recovery.  The BGOV Barometer shows  job creation  has reached that
level only 10 times since 1950, or about once every six years,
according to Labor Department figures. Those gains typically can
be traced to special circumstances such as the end of strikes,
census hiring and military mobilizations.  Romney raised the notion of creating a half-million jobs a
month on May 4, after the government reported that employers
added a less-than-projected 115,000 new workers in April, the
fewest since October.  “We should be seeing numbers in the 500,000 jobs created
per month,” Romney said during an interview on  Fox News . “This
is way, way, way off from what should happen in a normal
recovery.”  Monthly job growth has averaged about 120,000 since 1950,
government data show. During post World War II economic
expansions, the pace averaged about 174,000.  The last time payroll gains exceeded 500,000 was in May
2010. That increase, of 516,000 jobs, included about 411,000
temporary workers hired by the government to help conduct the
2010 census, according to figures from the Labor Department.
Employment declined by 167,000 the following month, when some of
those workers were dismissed.  After Strikes  The 500,000-jobs month before that, a 507,000 advance in
September 1997, reflected the return of about 185,000 Teamsters
Union members who had walked off their jobs at  United Parcel
Service Inc. (UPS)  a month earlier.  September 1983’s gain of 1.11 million jobs, the biggest
one-month jump on record, exceeded Romney’s threshold only
because it included about 640,000  AT&T Inc. (T)  employees who
returned to work after a three-week strike.  “I don’t think that kind of job creation is likely to
happen anytime soon, but I’m all for setting ambitious
benchmarks to get the  unemployment rate  down,” said Josh Bivens, an economist at the  Economic Policy Institute , a
Washington group that says it focuses on the economic condition
of low- and middle-class Americans.  “To me, the bigger issue is who has policies that are more
likely to do that, and I don’t think Romney has identified
any,” Bivens said. “Nobody is putting policies on the table
right now that would lead us to a rapid recovery.”  The  jobless rate  has exceeded 8 percent for 39 months, the
longest streak of such elevated levels since the Great
Depression.  To contact the reporter on this story:
