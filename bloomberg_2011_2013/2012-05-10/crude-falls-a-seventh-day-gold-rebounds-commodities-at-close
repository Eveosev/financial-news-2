The Standard & Poor’s GSCI  gauge  of
24 commodities declined 0.1 percent to 647.35 at 5:39 p.m.
Singapore time. The UBS Bloomberg CMCI  index  of 26 raw materials
dropped 0.06 percent to 1,521.709.  CRUDE OIL  Oil fell for a seventh day in  New York , its longest run of
declines since December 2009, as hopes for a solution to
 Europe ’s debt crisis receded, U.S. supplies rose and Chinese
imports fell.  WTI for June delivery fell as much as 52 cents to $96.29 a
barrel in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile Exchange 
and was at $96.34 at 9:24 a.m.  London  time. The contract
yesterday slid 20 cents to $96.81, the lowest close since Feb.
2. Prices have fallen 2.5 percent this year.  NATURAL GAS  Natural gas futures gained in New York on speculation that
a U.S. government report today will show inventories increased
at a lower-than-average rate.  OIL PRODUCTS  The premium of gasoil, or diesel, to Asian marker Dubai
crude fell $1.30 to $15.92 a barrel at 11 a.m. Singapore time,
according to data from PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a broker. This
crack spread, a measure of processing profit, narrowed the most
since Nov. 10. Gasoil swaps for June dropped 23 cents, or 0.2
percent, to $125.25 a barrel, PVM data showed. That’s the lowest
since Jan. 3.  Fuel oil  swaps for June climbed $2.50, or 0.4 percent, to
$682.75 a metric ton, according to PVM. Prices snapped a seven-
day run of losses. High-sulfur fuel oil declined 69 cents to
$4.29 a barrel below Dubai crude, PVM said. That’s the widest
discount in a week, signaling growing losses for refiners
turning oil into residual products.  PRECIOUS METALS  Gold rebounded from the lowest level in four months as the
metal’s slide, driven by Europe’s debt crisis and a stronger
dollar, spurred buying from investors.  Price declines are attracting physical buyers from India
and  China , according to UBS AG. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. kept
its forecast for higher  gold prices  in six months, citing weaker
U.S. growth, renewed European sovereign-debt risks and resilient
physical buying. Bullion slumped 3.2 percent in the first three
days of this week as Greek politicians struggled to form a
government following weekend elections, boosting speculation
that the country may quit the  euro zone .  Gold for immediate delivery rose 0.1 percent to $1,591.38
an ounce by 9:38 a.m. in London. June-delivery bullion declined
0.2 percent to $1,591.30 on the Comex in New York.  BASE METALS  Copper advanced for the first time in six days after data
showed shipments of the metal into China dropped last month,
boosting speculation that a surplus in the largest user will
shrink.  Three-month copper gained as much as 0.9 percent to
$8,129.75 a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange and traded
at $8,074.75 at 4:23 p.m. in  Shanghai . The contract fell to
$7,949.75 yesterday, a three-week low, as Europe’s escalating
debt crisis increased concern that commodity demand may falter.  GRAINS, SOFT COMMODITIES  Corn advanced for the second time this week on speculation
that yesterday’s plunge, the biggest in a week, may spur
importer demand. Wheat climbed.  Corn for July delivery gained as much as 0.7 percent to
$6.1175 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade and was at
$6.1125 at 2:26 p.m. Singapore time. July-delivery wheat  rose
as much as 1.3 percent to $6.075 a bushel and last traded at
$6.07.  Soybeans for July delivery rose 0.8 percent to $14.4175 a
bushel, snapping three days of declines. Futures rose 19 percent
this year on concern drought may curb output in  South America .  Rubber may decline for a fourth day, overturning early
gains, after China reported trade figures that missed
economists’ estimates, raising concern that demand from the
world’s largest consumer may weaken.  The October-delivery contract was unchanged at 292.3 yen a
kilogram ($3,670 a ton) on the Tokyo Commodity Exchange at 12:59
p.m. after earlier rising 1.1 percent. The price ended at 292.3
yen yesterday, the lowest settlement for the most-active
contract since Jan. 17 as political turmoil in  Greece  deepened
concern Europe’s debt crisis may reduce demand for commodities.  Palm oil  advanced for the first time in three days as
stockpiles in  Malaysia , the second-largest producer after
 Indonesia , dropped more than expected in April to the lowest in
a year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
