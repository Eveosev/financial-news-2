Officials from  Greece ’s finance
ministry and central bank met with political party
representatives to brief them on the state of the country’s
public finances,  Ta Nea  reported, without saying how it got the
information.  Greece’s budget projects revenue this year will be 100
billion euros ($129 billion) with expenditure at 84.7 billion
euros, according to the Athens-based newspaper. Stripping out
12.8 billion euros of interest payments, this leaves a 2.5
billion-euro primary shortfall that the government would need to
find a way to fill if there is no external aid from the European
Union and  International Monetary Fund , Ta Nea said.  Officials from the  Bank of Greece  and General Accounting
Office of the  Finance Ministry  met representatives of the
parties yesterday, while in the coming days central bank
governor George Provopoulos will make public more details about
the public finances, Ta Nea said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
