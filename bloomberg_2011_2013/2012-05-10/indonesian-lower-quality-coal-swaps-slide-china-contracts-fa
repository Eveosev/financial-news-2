Swaps contracts fell for lower-
quality thermal coal from  Indonesia , the world’s biggest
exporter of the fuel, according to Ginga Petroleum Singapore Pte
Ltd., an energy broker. China prices also dropped.  The June 2012 contract for Indonesian coal with a heating
value of 4,900 kilocalories a kilogram declined 85 cents to
$74.65 a metric ton on a net as-received basis yesterday,
according to data from the energy broker. Swaps for the third
quarter of 2012 slid 55 cents to $74.25 a ton.  Swaps contracts for China coal dropped. Coal with a heating
value of 5,500 kilocalories a kilogram on a net as-received
basis for shipments to South China for June slid 65 cents to
$98.10, Ginga said. The swap for the third quarter also fell 65
cents to $98.25 a ton.  A commodity swap is a financial agreement whereby a
floating, or spot price, is exchanged for a fixed rate over a
specified contract period.  About 60 percent of the coal from Indonesia is classed as
sub-bituminous. The grade is typically softer, with a dull,
earthy appearance, according to the London-based World Coal
Association. Higher moisture levels and a lower carbon content
reduce the heating value compared with grades with a higher
quality stock. Sub-bit coal has kilocalories of less than 6,100
per kilogram, according to the Indonesian Energy Ministry.  The cost of Indonesian  coal  cargoes with an energy value of
5,000 kilocalories per kilogram slid 7.6 percent in the three
months to the beginning of May, compared with a 17 percent
decline in higher-quality fuel from the Australian port of
Newcastle, a regional benchmark price. The difference between
Indonesia’s sub-bituminous coal and Newcastle prices is the
smallest in more than two years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
