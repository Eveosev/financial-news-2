Dick Advocaat signed a one-year
contract to return as coach at  PSV Eindhoven , the Dutch soccer
club said on its website.  Advocaat, 64, will take over July 1 after he coaches Russia
at the European Championship. He previously led PSV from 1995 to
1998, winning the league title in the 1996-97 season.  PSV fired coach Fred Rutten in March and replaced him for
the rest of the season with assistant Phillip Cocu, who guided
the club to a third-place finish in the league and a win over
 Heracles Almelo  in the Dutch Cup final.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
