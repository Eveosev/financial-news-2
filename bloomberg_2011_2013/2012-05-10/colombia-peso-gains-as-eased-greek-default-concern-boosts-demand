Colombia ’s peso rose from a four-week
low as reduced concern about Greece’s sovereign debt revived
demand for higher-yielding assets in  emerging markets .  The currency appreciated 0.3 percent to 1,762.93 per  U.S.
dollar  after touching 1,782.63 yesterday, the weakest level
since April 12. The peso is up 10 percent this year, the best
performance among all currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  “External markets are calmer today,” said Daniel Escobar,
the head analyst at Global Securities brokerage in Bogota.
Higher prices for oil, Colombia’s biggest export, and a report
showing U.S. first-time claims for jobless benefits fell to a
one-month low also helped buoy demand for the Colombian
currency, he said.  The yield on the government’s 10 percent peso-denominated
debt due in July 2024 rose two basis points, or 0.02 percentage
point, to 7.11 percent, according to the central bank. It closed
on May 7 at 7.03 percent, its lowest level since the debt was
issued in 2009. The price decreased 0.198 centavo to 123.012
centavos per peso.  A European Commission spokesman, Olivier Bailly, said
 Greece ’s financial needs “are covered” even as political
parties struggled to form a coalition government.  To contact the reporter on this story:
