European banks’ reluctance to lend to
one another held at the lowest level in more than nine months,
according to a money-market indicator.  The  Euribor-OIS spread , the difference between the euro
interbank offered rate and overnight indexed swaps, was little
changed at 38 basis points at 8:12 a.m. in  London , data compiled
by Bloomberg show. It’s the fifth day the measure has held at
the lowest since Aug. 1.  The cost for banks to convert euro interest payments into
dollars fell from the highest in more than two weeks. The three-
month cross-currency  basis swap  was 45 basis points below
Euribor from 48 yesterday, the highest since April 19.  The one-year basis swap fell from the highest since April
16. The measure was 55 basis points less than Euribor from minus
57 yesterday. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  Lenders cut  overnight deposits  at the Frankfurt-based
European Central Bank yesterday, placing 696 billion euros ($902
billion) with the  European Central Bank  from 823 billion euros
the day before.  To contact the reporter on this story:
