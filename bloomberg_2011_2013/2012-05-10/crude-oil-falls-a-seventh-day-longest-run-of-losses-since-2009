Oil rose, halting a six-day decline
that was the commodity’s longest drop since 2010, as first-time
claims for  unemployment benefits  fell to a one-month low.  West Texas Intermediate futures reversed earlier losses
after jobless claims declined by 1,000 to 367,000 in the period
ended May 5, in line with the median forecast in a Bloomberg
News survey and the lowest since the end of March, the Labor
Department said today in  Washington .  “For WTI at least the drop might have been overdone,”
said  Eugen Weinberg , head of commodities research at Commerzbank
AG in Frankfurt.  WTI for June delivery advanced as much as 88 cents, or 0.9
percent, to $97.69 a barrel in electronic trading on the  New
York Mercantile Exchange , having fallen as much as 73 cents to
$96.08 a barrel. The contract yesterday slid 20 cents to $96.81,
the lowest close since Feb. 2, and was at $97.47 at 1:53 p.m.
London time.  The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries said that
global oil supplies are outpacing demand levels, keeping its
forecast for world consumption this year unchanged.  “Higher OPEC crude oil production underscores the current
trend of plentiful supply in excess of market requirements,”
OPEC’s secretariat said in its Monthly Oil Market Report today.  Saudi Arabia , the world’s biggest crude exporter, boosted
oil output last month to the most in more than three decades,
according to a person familiar with the country’s production.  The kingdom pumped 10.1 million barrels a day in April,
more than the 10.04 million it produced last November, according
to the person, who is not authorized to speak publicly and
declined to be identified. That’s the highest level since at
least 1980, according to data from the U.S. Energy Department.  Oil prices  fell earlier today after a report yesterday from
the Energy Department showed U.S. crude inventories rose 3.7
million barrels last week to 379.5 million, the highest level
since 1990.  To contact the reporter on this story:
