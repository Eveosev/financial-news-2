Johnson Matthey Plc (JMAT) , the U.K.-based
pollution control specialist that makes a third of all
autocatalysts, will build a new plant in Macedonia to double
capacity.  The 50 million pound ($81 million) investment will increase
capacity in the Balkan country to 8 million units a year, said
Ian Godwin, investor relations director in a phone interview
from  London . The factory will open “in the next couple of
years,” before tighter European laws on emission control come
into force in the next few years, he said.  The new plant will be near the capital Skopje, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
