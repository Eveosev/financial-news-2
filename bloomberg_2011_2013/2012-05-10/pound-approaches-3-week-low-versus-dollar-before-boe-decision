The pound weakened for a third day
against the dollar as some economists forecast the  Bank of
England  will boost its asset-purchase program at a policy
meeting today.  Sterling weakened against most of its 16 major peers as
eight of 51 economists surveyed by Bloomberg predict policy
makers will increase  quantitative easing  by at least 25 billion
pounds ($40 billion). Gilts were little changed after a report
showed U.K. manufacturing production rose more than forecast in
March.  “The pound is a touch weaker as there’s a moderate
possibility that the BOE may spring a surprise,” said  Jeremy Stretch , head of currency strategy at Canadian Imperial Bank of
Commerce in London. “It makes sense to be moderately short on
the pound into next week on the expectation that the BOE may be
a little more circumspect about growth and the outlook for QE in
the medium term.”  The pound dropped 0.1 percent to $1.6113 at 11:29 a.m.
 London  time after falling to $1.6067 yesterday, the lowest level
since April 20. Sterling declined 0.2 percent to 80.30 pence per
euro. It earlier reached 80.03 pence, the strongest level since
November 2008.  Factory Output  “Euro-sterling down near 80 pence provides a psychological
barrier,” Stretch said. “Positions look pretty crowded and
look vulnerable to a bit of a correction.”  The U.K. currency has appreciated 4.6 percent in the past
three months, the best performer of the 10 developed-nation
currencies tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes.
The dollar gained 2 percent and the euro fell 0.2 percent.  U.K.  factory output  increased 0.9 percent in March after
falling a revised 1.1 percent the previous month, the  Office for
National Statistics  said today.  The  10-year gilt  yielded 1.92 percent after dropping to a
record 1.881 percent yesterday. The 4 percent bond due in March
2022 traded at 118.59.  Safety Demand  Demand for the relative safety of U.K. government debt has
pushed the yield difference, or  spread , between two- and 10-year
gilt rates to the lowest in more than three years.  The spread was at 150 basis points, or 1.5 percentage
points, the least since Jan. 7, 2009, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  The spread may encounter resistance at the January 2009 low
at 131 basis points, and may find support at the 100-day moving
average at 171 basis points, the data show.  Resistance refers to an area on a yield chart where
analysts expect orders to sell a security to be grouped. Support
is an area where they anticipate buy orders may be clustered.  Gilts have returned 0.1 percent this year, according to
indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European Federation of
Financial Analysts Societies. U.S. Treasuries gained 0.7 percent
and German bunds returned 2.2 percent, the indexes show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
