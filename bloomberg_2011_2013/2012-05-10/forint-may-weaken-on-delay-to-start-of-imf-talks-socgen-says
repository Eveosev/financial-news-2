Investors should sell the forint
against the euro and the Turkish lira because Hungary faces
further delays to starting talks on a bailout from the
 International Monetary Fund , Societe Generale SA said today.  Hungary’s currency may weaken to 300 per euro and 130 per
lira, Guillaume Salomon, a London-based strategist at the bank,
wrote in an e-mailed report today. The forint appreciated 0.3
percent to 289.4 per euro by 12:43 p.m. in Budapest. It traded
little changed at 124.97 per lira.  “We do not expect the negotiations on a new financial
package to start before the end of the summer, at the earliest,
which is a scenario that is not priced in by the market,”
Salomon wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
