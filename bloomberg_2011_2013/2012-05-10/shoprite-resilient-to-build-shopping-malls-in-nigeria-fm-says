Shoprite Holdings Ltd. (SHP)  and Resilient
Property Income Fund Ltd. plan to spend more than 1 billion rand
($125 million) building 10 shopping malls in Nigeria, the
 Financial Mail  said, citing Resilient’s Chief Executive Officer
Des de Beer.  The malls, 10,000 square meters (108,000 square feet) and
15,000 square meters in size, will be built over the next three
years in the capital, Abuja, and the city of Lagos, the main
commercial hub, said the Johannesburg-based weekly magazine.
Shoprite, Africa’s largest food retailer, will be the major
tenant.  Standard Bank Group Ltd. (SBK) , Africa’s biggest lender, and
construction company  Group Five Ltd. (GRF)  are also partners in the
deal, the FM said. Johannesburg-based Resilient is a South
African real-estate investment company with a market
capitalization of 11 billion rand.  To contact the reporter on this story:
