Germany ’s IG Bau labor union won a
3.3 percent pay increase for about 23,000 workers in the
quarrying industry after negotiations with employer’s
associations from the southwestern state of Baden-Wuerttemberg.  The wage contract has a duration of 13 months, IG Bau said
today in an e-mailed statement. The employers also agreed to
offer one-year contracts to all those completing apprenticeships
in the industry as part of the deal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
