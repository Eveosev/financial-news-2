China , the world’s second-biggest oil
consumer, reduced net  crude imports  to the least in fourth
months as a slowing economy and refinery repairs eroded demand.  The country bought 22.21 million metric tons, or 5.4
million barrels a day, more than it exported in April, data
 published  today on the website of the Beijing-based General
Administration of Customs show. That’s the lowest level since
December.  China’s exports of goods rose less than estimated in April,
lowering demand for fuel and petroleum products needed in
manufacturing. Refiners are also idling crude-processing plants
for seasonal maintenance in the second quarter.  “Domestic demand has been quite weak, and it’s also
related to refinery maintenance,” Shi Yan, an analyst at UOB-
Kay Hian Ltd., said by telephone from  Shanghai .  Imports of crude were 22.26 million tons in April, while
exports were 50,000 tons.  China’s state-owned refiners will close the equivalent of
12 percent of the nation’s oil-processing capacity in the second
quarter, Shandong-based industry website Oilchem.net reported in
January.  April crude purchases averaged $123 per barrel, compared
with about $116 in March, according to Bloomberg calculations
from customs data. Costs were around $109 in April 2011.  China bought 3.02 million tons of fuel, including gasoline
and diesel, and exported 1.66 million tons last month, according
to today’s data. Net imports of fuel were at 1.36 million tons,
compared with 1.86 million in March.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
