Kensey Nash Corp. (KNSY) , a maker of
absorbable cardiac medical devices, was sued by a stockholder
contending investors will be shortchanged in a planned $360
million bid from  Royal DSM NA. (DSM)   Directors of Exton, Pennsylvania-based Kensey Nash have a
duty to get the best price for the shares and haven’t complied
with that responsibility, investor Hilary Coyne said in court
papers made public today in Delaware Chancery Court in
Wilmington.  “The buyout is a product of a flawed process that is
designed to ensure the sale of Kensey Nash to DSM on terms
preferential to DSM, but detrimental” to shareholders, lawyers
for Coyne said in court papers.  DSM, based in Heerlen,  Netherlands , agreed to buy Kensey
Nash May 3 to expand in the market for medical-devices made of
proteins and synthetic polymers. The buyout price of $38.50
a share was a 33 percent premium at the time.  In the lawsuit, Coyne asks a judge to halt the proposed
sale and to certify the case as a class-action, or group,
lawsuit to represent all shareholders.  Joseph Kaufmann, chief executive officer of Kensey Nash,
didn’t immediately respond to an e-mail seeking comment on the
lawsuit.  Kensey Nash rose 3 cents to $38.47 in Nasdaq stock market
trading at 11:38 a.m. in  New York .  The case is Coyne v. Kensey Nash, CA7508, Delaware Chancery
Court (Wilmington).  To contact the reporters on this story:
