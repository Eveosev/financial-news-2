A total of 403,400 metric tons of 0.1
percent sulfur gasoil was delivered against the May contract on
the ICE Futures Europe exchange, the most since March 2011,
according to data on the bourse’s website.  That compares with 71,800 tons in April and 90,000 tons in
May last year, the ICE data show.  Shipments for low-sulfur gasoil fell to 8,100 tons in May,
compared with 30,000 tons in April. That’s the smallest volume
in the five months since deliveries began against the new
contract, which started trading last year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
