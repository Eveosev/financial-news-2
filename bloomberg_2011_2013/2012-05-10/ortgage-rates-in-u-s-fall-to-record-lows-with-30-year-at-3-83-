Mortgage rates  in the U.S. declined
for a third week, reaching record lows as the housing market
shows signs of stabilizing.  The average rate for a 30-year fixed loan fell to 3.83
percent in the week ended today from 3.84 percent,  Freddie Mac 
said in a statement. It was the lowest in the McLean, Virginia-
based mortgage-finance company’s data dating to 1971. The
average 15-year rate dropped to 3.05 percent, also the lowest on
record, from 3.07 percent.  The U.S. property market appears to be bottoming as low
borrowing costs and improving  employment  fuel demand for a
shrinking inventory of available homes. Prices for single-family
houses climbed in the first quarter from a year earlier in 74 of
146 metropolitan areas measured, the National Association of
Realtors said in a report yesterday.  “Pricewise, it looks like we’ve probably bottomed,”  Brian Jones , senior U.S. economist for Societe Generale SA in  New
York , said in a telephone interview yesterday. “But it’s slow
and steady improvement.”  At the end of March, 2.37 million previously owned homes
were available for sale, 22 percent fewer than a year earlier,
the Realtors said. Purchases of existing houses rose 5.3 percent
in the first quarter from a year earlier.  The  Mortgage Bankers Association ’s index of  purchase 
applications increased 3.4 percent in the week ended May 4,
while the  refinancing  gauge climbed 1.3 percent, the Washington-
based group said yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
