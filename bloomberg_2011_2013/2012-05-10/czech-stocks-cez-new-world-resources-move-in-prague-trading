The Czech Republic’s  PX (PX)  stock index
jumped 2.1 percent, the most in three months, to 911.9 at the
close of trading in Prague.  The following were among the most active equities in the
Czech market today. Stock symbols follow company names.  CEZ AS (CEZ)  , the country’s biggest power utility, rose
0.7 percent to 714.9 koruna, snapping a five-day decline to its

overshadowing worse-than-expected profit for the first quarter.  New World Resources Plc (NWR)  , the biggest Czech coking-
coal producer, jumped 4.9 percent to 119 koruna, its steepest
one-day advance in more than three months, after falling to a
