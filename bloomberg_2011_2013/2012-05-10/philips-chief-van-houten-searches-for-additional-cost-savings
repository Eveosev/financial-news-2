Royal Philips Electronics NV (PHIA) , the
world’s largest lighting company, will look for more cost
reductions, in addition to an 800 million-euro ($1 billion)
savings program initiated last year.  “We need to make sure the way we work is suitable for the
21th century,” Chief Executive Officer Frans  van Houten  said in
a presentation at an investor day in  Boston . “We will continue
to look at additional cost-savings opportunities.”  The CEO, who took the helm in April last year, initiated an
800 million-euro savings program in October, involving 4,500 job
cuts. A quarter of the targeted headcount reduction was
completed by the first quarter of this year, he said.  The program in place, called Path to Value, will cut
spending at the headquarters, in infrastructure,  information
technology  and real estate. Today the company said it set a
target to reduce information technology costs by 250 million
euros in the next four years with measures such as outsourcing
and reducing the number of software programs.  Van Houten has set a target for sales growth of 4 percent
to 6 percent by 2013, assuming gross domestic product increasing
at 3 percent to 4 percent a year. The target for earnings before
interest, taxes and amortization as a proportion of sales by
2013 is 10 to 12 percent.  “There is still a lot to do to hit the 2013 goals,” Van
Houten said in the presentation. At the end of the first quarter
profitability was at 9.8 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
