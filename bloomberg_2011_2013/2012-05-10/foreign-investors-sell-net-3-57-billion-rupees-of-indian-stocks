Overseas  investors  sold a net  3.57
billion rupees  ($66.8 million) of Indian stocks yesterday,
reducing their investment in the equities this year to 429.1
billion rupees, according to the nation’s market regulator.  Foreigners bought 22.1 billion rupees of shares and sold
25.7 billion rupees, the Securities & Exchange Board of India
said on its  website  today. Foreign funds sold a net 2.3 billion
rupees of bonds, paring their inflow into debt this year to
167.8 billion rupees, the data  show . They put 421 billion rupees
in bonds in 2011.  Finance Minister  Pranab Mukherjee  on May 7 deferred by a
year a plan to introduce rules to curb  tax avoidance  after the
proposals, announced on March 16, stoked concern that foreign
investment will decline and hurt growth in  Asia ’s third-largest
economy. Overseas funds sold a net 11.1 billion rupees of shares
last month after being net buyers in each of the first three
months of 2012.  Foreigners have invested 4.873 trillion rupees in stocks
and 1.375 trillion rupees in bonds since they were allowed into
the country in 1993.  India’s $1.2 trillion stock market, Asia’s fifth-biggest,
is influenced by flows from overseas. Inflows from abroad surged
to a record in 2010, making the BSE  India  Sensitive Index the
best performer among the world’s top 10 markets. The largest-
ever outflow in 2008 led to the biggest annual slump of 52
percent.  Offshore funds pulled out 27.1 billion rupees from local
equities last year, compared with record flows of 1.33 trillion
rupees in 2010, as  Europe ’s debt crisis threatened the global
economy and cooled demand for emerging-market assets. That led
to a 25 percent drop in the Sensex, the second worst annual
loss, and sent the rupee to an all-time low.  The regulator provides data on shares bought and sold by
large investors, including trades in the primary and secondary
markets, with a delay of at least a day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
