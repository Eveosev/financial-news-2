The  U.S. Commodity Futures Trading
Commission  voted to complete guidelines urging derivatives
exchanges to have additional information about how private
industry groups set prices, including the London interbank
offered rate.  The guidelines, part of final rules approved on a 5-0 vote
in  Washington , will govern exchanges and how they review
information from private price-reporting agencies including the
British Bankers’ Association. Regulators around the world are
probing whether banks colluded five years ago to manipulate
rates including Libor, the basis for $360 trillion in securities
worldwide.  “Large parts of the futures and swaps markets rely on the
price reporting agencies,” CFTC Chairman  Gary Gensler , told
reporters after the meeting. “In the financial markets, it
matters to corporations across this land who are borrowing
against an index called Libor.”  The guidance would apply to exchanges that have contracts
tied to prices set by private groups in the agriculture, energy
and financial markets. The guidelines are an effort to ensure
that “the underlying  price index  is not susceptible to
distortion or manipulation,” Gensler said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
