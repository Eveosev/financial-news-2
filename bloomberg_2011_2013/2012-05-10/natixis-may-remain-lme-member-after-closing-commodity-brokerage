Natixis Commodity Markets Ltd., one
of 12 companies allowed to trade on the floor of the London
Metal Exchange, may remain a member of the bourse after the
bank’s decision to close the commodity brokerage business.  Natixis SA Chief Executive Officer Laurent Mignon said
yesterday the French bank is ending the London-based commodities
brokerage business. Most of that business is industrial metals,
with the remainder in agricultural commodities and energy, said
Pierre-Henri Denain, senior country manager for Natixis in U.K.  The Paris-based bank plans to stop its “pure brokerage”
business while keeping over-the-counter activities, Mignon said
yesterday. The process of exiting the brokerage business may run
until the end of this year, Denain said.  Natixis will remain a category 1 member of the LME in “the
immediate future but it’s now working with customers to decide
when it will cease offering ring-dealing services,” Denain
said. “The bank may then decide whether or not to continue with
a different level of LME membership to support its OTC sales and
trading business.”  There are seven different categories of LME membership.
Category 1 and 2 members provide access to the market and can
clear trades, according to the exchange website. Only category 1
members have access to the ring. The exchange also has
electronic and telephone trading.  Natixis will announce next week the restructuring of its
over-the-counter commodity sales and trading business, Denain
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
