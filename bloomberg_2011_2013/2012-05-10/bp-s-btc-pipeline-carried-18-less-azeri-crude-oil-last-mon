The BP Plc-led Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan
pipeline carried 2.3 million metric tons of crude oil last
month, a decline of 18 percent from the same period a year
earlier, according to  State Oil Co. (ATPG)  of Azerbaijan.  It delivered 10.24 million tons from the offshore Azeri-
Chirag-Guneshli field, also led by BP, to  Turkey ’s Mediterranean
port of Ceyhan via  Georgia  in the first four months, compared
with 11.4 million tons a year earlier, the company, known as
Socar, said on its website today without giving a reason.  As of May 1, the 1,768-kilometer (1,099 mile) pipeline
known as BTC carried a total of 186.2 million tons of oil since
it began operating in 2005, said Socar, a project partner.  Azerbaijan, the third-largest oil producer in the former
 Soviet Union  after Russia and Kazakhstan, curbed oil exports by
7.3 percent in the first quarter to 6.4 million tons, the State
Statistics Committee said on April 23. Natural-gas exports
increased 2.7 percent to 1.34 billion cubic meters.  To contact the reporter on this story:
