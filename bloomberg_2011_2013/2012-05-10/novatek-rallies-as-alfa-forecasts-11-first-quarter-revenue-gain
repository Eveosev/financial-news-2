OAO Novatek rose on speculation
 Russia ’s second-largest natural-gas producer will post a gain in
first-quarter sales.  The shares added 5.5 percent to 333.52 rubles by the close
in Moscow, the most since July 21.  First-quarter revenue climbed 7.5 percent to $1.65 billion
from a year earlier, according to the average estimate of eight
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. The company is due to report
earnings May 11.  The results will be “seasonally strong on volume growth
across the board -- gas and liquid rose 11.2 percent and 5.7
percent year-over-year,” Alfa Bank analysts, led by Pavel Sorokin, wrote in an e-mailed report today. “Crude oil price
appreciation further boosted the company’s liquid sales.”  The shares sank 10 percent on May 2 after Deputy Finance
Minister  Sergei Shatalov  said the government approved
quadrupling the mineral-extraction tax.  Independent gas producers, which include Novatek and  oil
companies , will pay 1,049 rubles per 1,000 cubic meters of gas
produced in 2015, compared with 251 rubles this year, Shatalov
told reporters in Moscow on May 2 after a government meeting.  To contact the reporter on this story:
