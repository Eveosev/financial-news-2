A bill passed by Ecuadorean lawmakers
that would limit borrowers’ liability should they default on
mortgages would reduce home lending and raise risks for lenders,
according to the country’s biggest banking association.  The measure, which allows homeowners to cancel outstanding
debts by forfeiting their houses, gives consumers incentives to
not pay their obligations, Cesar Robalino, executive president
of  Ecuador ’s Private Bank Association, told reporters today in
Quito. The association will ask President  Rafael Correa  to veto
parts of the bill, which was passed May 8, he said.  The new rules would apply to first-time home buyers whose
dwellings are valued at as much as $146,000. They also would
allow Ecuadoreans to settle automobile loans of as much as
$29,200 by handing over the vehicle. Correa said April 28 the
bill was necessary to end lenders’ “criminal abuse” of
citizens.  “It creates moral risk and stimulates a culture of not
paying debts,” said Robalino, a former finance minister during
three administrations in the 1980s and 1990s.  To contact the reporter on this story:
