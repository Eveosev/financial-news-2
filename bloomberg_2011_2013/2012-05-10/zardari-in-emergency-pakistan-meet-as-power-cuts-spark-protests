Pakistan  President Asif Ali Zardari
called an emergency meeting of key ministers after power
blackouts triggered violent protests in some cities.  The president “has canceled all his engagements scheduled
for today and has called an urgent meeting on the issue of power
shortage in the country,” his media office said in a statement
today. The ministers of power, petroleum and finance will attend
the meeting, according to the statement.  The gap between power demand and supply surged to a record
7,500 megawatts today, the Geo television channel reported,
broadcasting footage of demonstrations in several cities in the
country’s largest province, Punjab. The region is the stronghold
of Zardari’s chief rival,  Nawaz Sharif .  Pakistan has been beset by energy shortages for the last
four years, blackouts that have cut economic growth and closed
factories. The power deficit and damage to the cotton crop from
floods last year may restrict the country’s growth to 3.6
percent in the year ending June, according to the Manila-based
 Asian Development Bank .  To contact the reporter on this story:
