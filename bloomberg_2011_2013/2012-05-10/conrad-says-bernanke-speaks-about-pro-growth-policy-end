Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  spoke to a group of senators today about the potential
harm to the economy from the expiration of several pro-growth
policies, Senator  Kent Conrad  said.  Bernanke said to a group of Democrats the scheduled end of
programs including tax cuts and extended unemployment benefits
could pose a risk to the U.S. expansion, said Conrad, a Democrat
from North Dakota.  “If all those things happened, that would constitute a
fiscal cliff, and that would have economic consequences,”
Conrad said.  Conrad declined to characterize Bernanke’s message about
the potential impact from the expiration of the pro-growth
policies. Bernanke also described the current condition of the
economy, Conrad said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
