Rathbone Brothers Plc (RAT) , a U.K. money
manager founded in 1742, said net operating income rose 12
percent in the first quarter as it attracted more client funds.  Net operating income climbed to 40.1 million pounds ($64.7
million) compared with 35.9 million pounds in the previous three
months, the London-based company said in a statement today.
Total funds under management rose 6.1 percent to 16.8 billion
pounds in the quarter, the company said.  “Whilst investment markets are expected to remain
uncertain, Rathbones is as well placed as ever to develop future
growth opportunities,” said Chairman Mark Nicholls.  Private-client fund managers, including Rathbones, may be
attracting funds from customers looking for better returns than
they can get on deposits with  interest rates  at record lows as
the euro-region economies face the debt crisis.  To contact the reporter on this story:
