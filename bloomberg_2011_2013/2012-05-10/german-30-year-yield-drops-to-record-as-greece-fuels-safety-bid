Spanish bonds rose for the first time
in four days after the government said it would take over  Bankia
SA (BKIA)  and was prepared to inject public funds into the banking
group, bolstering investor confidence.  German bunds fell, snapping a two-day gain, as the rally
in Spanish securities and the euro, damped demand for the
region’s safest assets. Greek bonds dropped for an eighth day as
the nation’s political leaders struggled to form a new
government, raising the possibility that another election will
have to be held as early as next month. Italian bonds advanced.  “The late news yesterday that Spain is going to part-
nationalize Bankia is the major driver,” said Eric Wand, a
fixed-income strategist at Lloyds Banking Group Plc in  London .
“It’s a step in the right direction and I think the market
likes it. We’ve seen a decent selloff in the last couple of days
and people are seizing on that to re-price”  Spain ’s 10-year bond yield fell 10 basis points, or 0.1
percentage point, to 5.98 percent at 4:35 p.m. London time after
rising 34 basis points over the previous three days. The 5.85
percent security due in January 2022 rose 0.685, or 6.85 euros
per 1,000-euro face amount, to 99.015.  The Spanish government said it will take a 45 percent
controlling stake in Bankia as it aims to help shore up the
financial system. The country’s bank bailout fund will convert
its 4.5 billion euros of preferred shares in Bankia’s parent,
Banco Financiero y de Ahorros, into voting shares, the  Economy
Ministry  said in a statement yesterday.  Italy, Portugal  Bonds in other so-called peripheral nations also advanced.
Italian  10-year yields  dropped eight basis points to 5.41
percent, and Portugal’s 10-year rate declined 42 basis points to
11.12 percent  The euro strengthened 0.3 percent to $1.2961, snapping an
eight-day decline.  Germany ’s 10-year yield climbed three basis points to 1.55
percent, and the 30-year  yield  increased one basis point to 2.24
percent. German two-, five-, 10- and 30-year yields all dropped
to records yesterday amid the political instability in  Greece .  The yield on the Greek bond due February 2023 climbed 49
basis points to 24.19 percent. The yield has jumped almost four
percentage points since the elections on May 6.  Greece’s  Evangelos Venizelos , the socialist Pasok leader
and former finance minister, began a last-ditch effort to form a
coalition government today that would avert a new election and
keep the country in the euro.  Annual Return  German debt returned 2.2 percent this year, according to
indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European Federation of
Financial Analysts Societies. Spanish securities dropped 2.3
percent, the indexes show.  The difference between German two- and 10-year yields
widened two basis points to 147 basis points after shrinking to
145 basis points yesterday, the least since November, based on
closing prices.  Volatility on Portuguese bonds was the highest in euro-area
markets today followed by Austrian securities, according to
measures of 10-year bonds, the spread between two and 10-year
securities, and credit-default swaps. The change in the
Portuguese yield was 1.6 times the 90-day average.  To contact the reporters on this story:
