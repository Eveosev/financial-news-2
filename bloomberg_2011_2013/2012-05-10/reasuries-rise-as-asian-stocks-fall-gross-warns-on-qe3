Treasury 10-year yields were 19 basis
points from the record low as  Greece ’s politicians struggled to
form a government, increasing speculation that the nation will
abandon the euro as its currency as it battles a recession.  The U.S. is scheduled to sell $16 billion of 30-year bonds
today, after a $24 billion 10-year auction yesterday drew a
record-low rate.  Europe ’s fiscal crisis and signs of slowing
growth are increasing demand for the safety of U.S. debt.  Ten-year  yields  were little changed at 1.86 percent as of
6:45 a.m. in  London , according to Bloomberg Bond Trader data.
The 1.75 percent security due in May 2022 changed hands at 99.
The record low is 1.67 percent set Sept. 23. The average yield
for the past year is 3.82 percent.  “Demand is still there” even after rates tumbled, said
Will Tseng, who invests in  U.S. debt  at Taipei-based Shin Kong
Life, which has the equivalent of $53.9 billion in assets.
“We’re going to hold” the position in Treasuries rather than
consider selling, he said. Tseng said he would like to buy again
if the 10-year yield rises to 1.95 percent.  Japan ’s 10-year yield increased one basis point to 0.86
percent, after falling to 0.845 percent yesterday, the least
since October 2010.  Australia ’s rate slid to a record low 3.31
percent.  One Country Fewer  As Greece faces political paralysis, a survey of 1,253
Bloomberg subscribers showed 57 percent of investors, analysts
and traders predicted at least one country will abandon the euro
by year-end. Political leaders remained divided on forming a new
government, stoking concern another election could set the stage
for the country’s s exit from the currency union.  In the U.S., employers added 115,000 jobs in April, the
least in six months, the Labor Department reported May 4.  The Treasury sold 10-year notes yesterday at 1.855 percent,
lower than the previous record 1.9 percent in January. It also
auctioned $32 billion of three-year notes on May 8.  Bill Gross , who runs the world’s biggest bond fund, cut his
holdings of emerging-market debt to a two-year low, selling
assets from an area where the  International Monetary Fund  says
growth will slow.  Gross reduced the securities to 7 percent of assets in
Pacific Investment Management Co.’s Total Return Fund in April
from 10 percent in March, according to Newport Beach,
California-based Pimco’s  website . He trimmed investment-grade
bonds to 13 percent from 14 percent. Treasuries were 31 percent
of holdings, versus 32 percent in March, the report showed.  Slowing Growth  Growth in emerging economies will slow to 5.7 percent in
2012 from 6.2 percent in 2011, the IMF said in April.  Gross kept mortgage securities as his biggest holding at 53
percent of assets, according to the report posted yesterday on
the Pimco website. The  Federal Reserve  will probably shift its
focus to mortgage securities in its next possible round of bond
purchases to keep borrowing rates low, he said in March.  The 30-year bonds being sold today yielded 3.045 percent in
pre-auction trading, versus 3.23 percent the last time the
government sold the securities on April 12.  Investors  bid  for 2.76 times the amount of debt offered
last month, versus the average of 2.67 percent for the past 10
auctions.  Indirect  bidders , the investor group that includes foreign
central banks, purchased 30.7 percent of the securities,
compared with the 10-sale average of 30.  The government is also scheduled to announce today the size
of a sale of 10-year Treasury Inflation Protected Securities
scheduled for May 17. The auction will probably be for $13
billion, according to Wrightson ICAP LLC, an economic advisory
company in  Jersey City ,  New Jersey , that specializes in
 government finance .  The Federal Reserve plans to sell as much as $8.75 billion
of Treasuries due from October 2013 to January 2014 today,
according to the Fed Bank of  New York ’s  website .  The sales are part of the U.S. central bank’s effort to
replace $400 billion of shorter-term debt in its holdings with
longer maturities by the end of June to hold down borrowing
costs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
