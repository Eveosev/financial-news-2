Taiwan ’s dollar and government bonds
were little changed after the central bank signaled inflation
will stay within target in 2012, following data this week
showing prices rose the most in three months.  Governor Perng Fai-nan said yesterday he’s confident the
consumer-price index will remain below 2 percent this year,
after the statistics bureau raised its full-year forecast to
1.94 percent from 1.46 percent last month. The  gauge  climbed
1.44 percent in April, compared with a revised 1.25 percent
increase in March.  “Inflation concern has eased,” said Tarsicio Tong, a
foreign-exchange trader at  Union Bank of Taiwan (2838)  in Taipei. “The
currency should stay in a range of between NT$29.2 and NT$29.5
as Taiwan’s economy isn’t great. There’s no basis supporting a
strong appreciation.”  Taiwan’s dollar traded at NT$29.395 against its U.S.
counterpart, compared with NT$29.400 yesterday, according to
Taipei Forex Inc. One-month implied volatility, a measure of
exchange-rate swings traders use to price options, was unchanged
at 4.5 percent.  Exports declined 6.4 percent in April from a year earlier,
after a 3.2 percent drop the previous month, official data
showed this week. Economic growth slowed to 0.36 percent last
quarter, the least since a contraction in the period ended
September 2009.  The yield on the government’s 1 percent bonds due January
2017 rose 0.5 basis point to 0.982 percent, according to Gretai
Securities Market. The  overnight interbank lending rate  was
little changed at 0.509 percent, according to a weighted average
compiled by the Taiwan Interbank Money Center. It reached 0.514
percent yesterday, the highest level since 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
