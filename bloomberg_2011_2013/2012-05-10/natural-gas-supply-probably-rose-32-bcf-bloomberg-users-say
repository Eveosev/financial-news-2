The U.S. Energy Department’s natural-
gas inventory report, scheduled for release at 10:30 a.m. in
 Washington , will show that supplies rose 1.2 percent last week,
according to a survey of Bloomberg users.  The government’s Natural Gas Storage Report will show that
inventories gained 32 billion cubic feet in the week ended May 4
to 2.608 trillion cubic feet, according to the survey.  Natural gas for June delivery fell 0.1 cent to $2.464 per
million British thermal units on the  New York  Mercantile
Exchange at 10:20 a.m.  Bloomberg compiles the anonymous survey based on estimates
by at least 100 users each week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
