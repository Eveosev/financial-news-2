Coffee output in  Brazil , the world’s
largest producer, will rise to 50.4 million bags in the current
crop, the Agriculture Ministry said.  Production will climb from 43.5 million bags in the
previous harvest, the ministry’s Conab crop-forecasting agency
said today by e-mail. The forecast compares with a Jan. 10
estimate of production between 49 million and 52.3 million bags.  Output of arabica beans will increase to 38.1 million bags
from 32.2 million, while robusta production will rise to 12.3
million from 11.3 million bags in the previous crop, Conab said.  Most harvesting in Brazil runs from April to September. A
bag of coffee weighs 60 kilograms (132 pounds.)  To contact the reporters on this story:
