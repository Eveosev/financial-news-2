The 247-acre (100-hectare) country
estate where former Irish Premier Charles Haughey entertained
Libyan leader  Muammar Qaddafi  and opera singer  Luciano Pavarotti 
is on sale for 7.5 million euros ($9.7 million).  Haughey, who died in 2006, also hosted British Prime
Minister  Margaret Thatcher  at the Abbeville estate, 10
kilometers (6.2 miles) north of Dublin, according to  Savills
Plc (SVS) , which is managing the sale. Haughey bought the estate in
1969 when he was finance minister. It was sold in 2003 to Manor
Park Homes for 45 million euros, the Irish Times reported.  Irish real estate prices, which have fallen about 55
percent from their peak in 2007, may fall for two to three more
years and lose as much as 70 percent of their value, Danske Bank
said today. The lender expects to reduce its 8.45 billion-euro
loan portfolio in the country by half, Jesper Nielsen, the
deputy chief executive officer of the bank’s Irish unit, said in
an interview today.  Haughey, a four-time prime minister, led a “conspicuously
lavish lifestyle” on relatively modest earnings, according to a
2006 tribunal convened to investigate his finances that finished
after his death. Haughey received more than 11 million euros
over two decades from benefactors and businessmen, the tribunal
concluded.  Abbeville includes a 14-bedroom mansion dating from the
mid-1700s. It has six reception rooms and 14,600 square feet
(1,356 square meters) of space over four floors. The property is
being sold on the instructions of Tom Kavanagh, receiver for
Manor Park Homes, according to Savills. Manor Park went into
receivership in 2011.  The estate also has 23 stables, an indoor equestrian arena,
two cottages and an outdoor swimming pool. Planning permission
has previously been secured for the development of a leisure
resort including an 18-hole golf course, a hotel and luxury
homes on the property, Savills said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
