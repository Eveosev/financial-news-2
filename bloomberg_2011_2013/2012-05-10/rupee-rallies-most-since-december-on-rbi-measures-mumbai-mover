India ’s rupee rebounded from near a
five-month low after the central bank tightened rules on
exporters’ earnings to boost dollar supply and stem  Asia ’s worst
exchange-rate loss.  The currency rose as much as 1.6 percent, the most since
December, after the  Reserve Bank  of India cut the amount of
overseas income companies can hold in foreign currency to 50
percent from 100 percent,  forcing  them to convert earnings. The
rupee also gained on speculation the central bank intervened in
the market to sell dollars.  Reserve Bank Governor Duvvuri Subbarao is stepping up
efforts to support the currency after it lost 4.8 percent this
quarter, fueled by  Standard & Poor’s  decision on April 25 to cut
the outlook on the nation’s BBB- rating to negative. Funds based
abroad cut holdings of Indian  stocks  and  bonds  by a total $781
million in the month through May 8 and the nation’s trade
deficit rose to a record $184.9 billion in the fiscal year ended
March 31, official figures show.  “The rupee’s rally today is completely because of this
announcement,” said  Paresh Nayar , head of money-market and
currency trading in Mumbai at  FirstRand Ltd. (FSR)  “The rupee has to
strengthen because of the RBI moves but we have to wait and see
how it reacts in the coming days as we still have a trade
deficit, which means demand for dollars will be strong.”  The rupee advanced 0.8 percent to 53.4250 per dollar in
Mumbai, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It had touched
53.9225 on May 4, the lowest level since falling to a record low
of 54.3050 on Dec. 15. The currency’s one-month implied
volatility, a measure of exchange-rate swings used to price
options, rose 50 basis points, or 0.5 percentage point, to 11.70
percent.  Stocks, Bonds  Indian stocks advanced as much as 1.2 percent after the
central bank’s move, before reversing gains on concern  Europe ’s
debt crisis will sap demand for emerging-market assets.  The 17-nation euro area is on the verge of losing one of
its members as  Greece ’s election impasse threatens to worsen its
debt problems, according to more than 50 percent of investors
who participated in the Bloomberg Global Poll.  The BSE India  Sensitive Index (SENSEX) , or Sensex, fell 0.4 percent
to 16,420.05 in Mumbai.  In the government bond market, the yield on the benchmark
8.79 percent notes due November 2021 was little changed at 8.56
percent percent, according to the central bank’s trading system.
The rate had dropped to 8.53 percent after the central bank’s
announcement.  ‘At the Bottom’  “We’re pretty much at the bottom in terms of the rupee and
most of the bad news is in the price,” Hans Goetti, Singapore-
based chief investment officer for Asia at Finaport Investment
Intelligence, which has $1.5 billion in assets under management,
told Bloomberg UTV today. “We don’t see much of a downside risk
for Indian markets from here.”  The Sensex has risen 6.2 percent this year as foreigners
 pumped  $8.7 billion into Indian stocks on optimism the central
bank would ease monetary policy after a record run of increases
in  interest rates  slowed economic growth and eroded corporate
earnings. Four out of 14, or 29 percent, of Sensex companies
posted March-quarter profits that trailed analyst estimates,
compared with a 47 percent in the December quarter.  India VIX, which measures the cost of protection against
losses in the S&P CNX  Nifty (NIFTY)  Index on the National Stock
Exchange, declined 1.4 percent to 22.72. The  BSE 200 Index (BSE200)  fell
0.2 percent to 2,023.67. A total of 892 million shares changed
hands on the BSE and NSE yesterday, 1 percent less than the
daily average in the past year, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Six-month onshore currency forwards were trading at 55.05 a
dollar, compared with 55.56 yesterday, and offshore non-
deliverable contracts were at 55.25 from 55.73. Forwards are
agreements to buy or sell assets at a set price and date. Non-
deliverable contracts are settled in dollars.  To contact the reporters on this story:
