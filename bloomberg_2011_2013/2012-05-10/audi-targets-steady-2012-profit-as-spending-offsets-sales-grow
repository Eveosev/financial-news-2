Volkswagen AG (VOW) ’s Audi brand forecast
2012 profit to hold steady as slowing European economic growth
and spending on factories and new vehicles offset higher
worldwide deliveries.  “Audi plans an operating result on the same record level
as the previous year, despite higher spending on models and
technology,” Chief Financial Officer Axel Strotbek said in a
speech at the company’s annual shareholders meeting today at its
Ingolstadt, Germany headquarters. “In western  Europe , we are
confronted with particularly challenging market conditions.”  Audi, the world’s second-largest maker of luxury cars,
forecasts sales will increase as long as economic conditions
don’t deteriorate significantly, the Volkswagen unit said today.  The brand intends to grow faster than the auto industry by
introducing 18 models this year, including a new generation A3
compact and a hybrid version of the A6 sedan.  Operating profit reached 5.35 billion euros ($6.9 billion)
in 2011, and climbed 27 in the first quarter of 2012 to a record
1.4 billion euros while sales gained 18 percent to 12.4 billion
euros.  Chasing BMW  The Volkswagen unit is expanding as it looks to overtake
 Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW)  as the world’s largest luxury-car
maker. Audi agreed last month to purchase Italian motorcycle
maker Ducati. It also plans to start producing cars in Mexico by
2016 at its first factory in  North America .  Audi Chief Executive Officer Rupert Stadler said that the
company expects this year to sell more than 130,000 vehicles in
the U.S., which would be a record. The brand’s sales reached
117,561 in 2011, less than half as many as competitors BMW or
Daimler AG.  “By 2015 we want to double the number of diesel engines in
the U.S.A.,” 49-year-old Stadler added. Audi delivered 1.3
million vehicles globally last year.  Shares in parent VW declined as much as 1.7 percent to
123.85 euros, and were trading 0.4 percent lower as of 1:52 p.m.
in Frankfurt.  Audi, whose revenue in the Asia-Pacific region topped 12
billion euros in 2011, expects  China ’s premium car segment to
grow more than 20 percent this year, while Audi’s sales rise 8
percent,  Peter Schwarzenbauer , head of sales, told shareholders.
The company also forecast unit sales in  Russia  will top 30,000
this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
