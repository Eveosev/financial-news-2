Hwange Colliery Ltd. (HWANGE)  of Zimbabwe
started transporting coal to Mozambique that will eventually be
shipped to  India , a company spokesman said.  “We have started overland shipments to Beira,” Basil Dube
said today in an interview on the sidelines of a Chamber of
Mines meeting in Victoria Falls, west of Harare, the capital.
“As of yesterday we have moved 48,000 tons.”  The company plans to ship 60,000 metric tons of coal to
India and is using the National Railways of Zimbabwe to get the
product to Mozambique, Dube said.  Hwange is exporting as its main consumer, Zimbabwe Power
Corp., a wholly owned unit of the state-owned Zesa Holdings
(Pvt) Ltd., has enough stocks until August and is receiving
5,000 tons of coal a day, Dube said.  Hwange is also in talks to sell coal to  China , Dube said.
“The logistics have yet to be finalized, but we hope this can
be concluded soon,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
