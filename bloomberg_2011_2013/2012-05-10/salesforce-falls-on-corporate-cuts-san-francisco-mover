Salesforce.com Inc. (CRM) , the biggest
provider of online customer-management software, fell the most
in almost six months after computer-networking leader  Cisco
Systems Inc. (CSCO)  said corporate customers are reluctant to spend.  Salesforce dropped 9.1 percent to $135.44 at the close in
 New York , for the biggest decline since Nov. 18. The stock pared
gains for the year to 33 percent.  Cisco Chief Executive Officer John Chambers yesterday said
orders from big companies dropped in the third quarter, and it’s
taking longer to sign large deals with corporate customers.
Cisco is seen as a bellwether for the broader technology
industry because most of its sales come from new business,
making its results a reliable gauge of real-time spending
trends. Networking products such as routers and switches must be
upgraded frequently to handle increasing data traffic.  “Cisco’s comments on the enterprise scared people,” Peter Goldmacher, an analyst at Cowen & Co. in  San Francisco , said in
an e-mail. “Large enterprise deals are critical to Salesforce
hitting numbers now.”  San Francisco-based Salesforce is scheduled to report
fiscal first-quarter earnings May 17. Sales may rise 34 percent
to $678.3 million, according to the average analyst estimate
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporters on this story:
