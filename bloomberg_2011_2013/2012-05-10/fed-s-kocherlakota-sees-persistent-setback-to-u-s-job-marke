Federal Reserve Bank of  Minneapolis 
President Narayana Kocherlakota said damage to the labor market
may persist even as the expansion continues, holding U.S.
unemployment higher than the usual rate since World War II.  Central bankers must “contemplate the possibility that the
erosion in labor market performance that we’ve seen in the
United States over the past five years may be highly persistent,
even under appropriate monetary policy,” Kocherlakota said
today in the text of remarks given in Minneapolis. Accelerating
inflation is “a signal that our country’s current labor market
performance is much closer to ‘maximum employment’ than the
post-World War II U.S. data alone would suggest.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
