Bundesbank board member Andreas Dombret said euro-area governments don’t have an alternative to
implementing structural and fiscal reforms.  Countries should aim for “a gradual and steady improvement
of their competitiveness and fiscal positions,” Dombret said in
Vienna today, according to his e-mailed speech. “There is no
substitute for such an adjustment process at the local level.”  While firewalls “can buy time and serve as a tool for
commitment to implement necessary reforms,” they can’t be a
“substitute for restoring solvency,” he said. “This can only
be achieved through economic adjustments and structural reforms,
in which case a firewall may well be helpful.”  Dombret also said that policy makers observed “clear signs
of a systemic financial crisis” at the end of 2011. After the
 European Central Bank ’s record cash provision, fiscal reforms
and  Greece ’s debt restructuring “managed to mitigate the stress
to some extent,” tensions “have renewed due to doubts of the
solidity of the fiscal positions of some countries.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
