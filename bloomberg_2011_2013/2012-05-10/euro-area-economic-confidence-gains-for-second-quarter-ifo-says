Confidence in the euro-area economy
improved for a second straight quarter, driven by rising
expectations for growth,  Germany ’s  Ifo research institute  said,
citing its quarterly World Economic Survey.  An index measuring economic sentiment in the 17-nation
currency area increased to 100.3 from 84.8 three months ago,
Munich-based Ifo said in an advance copy of the WES, which it
conducts with the  International Chamber of Commerce  in Paris.
While that’s the biggest increase in six years, Ifo said the
index remains below its long-term average. A measure of current
conditions rose to 114.7 from 109.1 and a gauge of expectations
jumped to 91.8 from 70.5.  “The six-month outlook is significantly more positive than
in the first quarter,” Ifo said. “However, the economic
situation in the euro area is not homogeneous.”  Analysts judged the situation to be good in Germany and
Estonia and not satisfactory in Austria, Belgium, the
Netherlands, Ireland and France, the report showed. The worst
assessments were given to Greece, Portugal, Italy, Spain and
Cyprus.  Inflation is forecast to average 2.4 percent in the euro
area in 2012. Survey respondents expect short-term  interest
rates  to remain stable over the next six months and the  U.S.
dollar  to “strengthen somewhat” against the euro, Ifo said.  The second-quarter survey was based on responses from 279
economic experts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
