Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) , one of the
five U.S. banks with the biggest positions in over-the-counter
derivatives, may owe counterparties $2.21 billion if its credit
rating falls two levels.  Counterparties could demand the money in collateral and
termination payments, the New York-based bank said in a
quarterly filing today. A one-level reduction would require
$1.33 billion in payments, according to the filing.  Goldman Sachs, the fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets, is
under review by Moody’s Investors Service for a possible two-
level downgrade to A3 from A1. The credit rater said in February
it was examining ratings of 17 banks and securities firms with
global capital-market operations. Morgan Stanley,  Credit Suisse
Group AG (CSGN)  and  UBS AG (UBSN)  may be cut three levels, Moody’s said.  As of Dec. 31, a two-level cut would have obliged Goldman
Sachs to pay $2.18 billion in collateral and terminations, the
firm reported in February. A one-level reduction would have
required $1.3 billion as of December, the firm reported.  Goldman Sachs was among five companies that accounted for
96 percent of the total U.S. banking industry’s notional
holdings in derivatives and 86 percent of net current credit
exposure in derivatives as of December, according to the  Office
of the Comptroller of the Currency .  To contact the reporter on this story:
