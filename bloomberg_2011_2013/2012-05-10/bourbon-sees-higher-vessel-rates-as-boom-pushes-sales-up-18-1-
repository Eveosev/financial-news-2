Bourbon SA (GBB) , owner of the biggest
fleet of supply and crew ships for the oil industry, increased
first-quarter revenue 18 percent and said contracts for supply
vessels will be renewed at higher rates because of a “booming”
market.  Sales rose to 278 million euros ($360 million) from 235.5
million euros the previous year, the Paris-based company said in
a statement. Average daily rates for marine and subsea service
vessels rose.  “The growth in demand from clients gradually led to a
disappearance of over-capacity,” Bourbon said. “The
utilization rates and daily rates of offshore service vessels
are expected to continue rising.”  Bourbon bolstered its building program last year in
anticipation that explorers will choose new vessels. Under a $2
billion expansion plan, Bourbon plans to own 600 ships by 2015,
up from 437 at the end of last year.  The company had 37 more vessels in the first quarter than
during the same period last year, adding 8 in the period,
according to today’s statement. The average utilization rate
rose to 83.7 percent from 83.1 percent with the highest level at
92.5 percent for deepwater offshore vessels. Average daily rates
for deepwater vessels rose 6.2 percent to $20,011.  Over the next nine months, the company expects to renew
contracts for at least 46 supply vessels, according to the
statement.  “Bourbon is reaping the benefits of a booming market in
the offshore oil and gas marine services,” Chief Executive
Officer Christian Lefevre said in the statement. During the
first quarter, sales rose in Nigeria and  Angola  as well as
 Europe  and the Mediterranean due to orders in  Egypt  and  Romania ,
Bourbon said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
