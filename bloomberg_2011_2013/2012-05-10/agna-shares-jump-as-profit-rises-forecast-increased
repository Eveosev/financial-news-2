Magna International Inc. (MG) ,  North
America ’s largest auto-parts supplier, rose the most since
February after it reported that first-quarter profit rose 6.5
percent and raised its full-year sales forecast.  Magna surged 4.1 percent to C$44.42 at 1:19 p.m. Toronto
time, the biggest intraday jump since Feb. 24, after having
reached C$45.95. The  shares  gained 26 percent this year before
today. Net income totaled $343 million, or $1.46 a share, from
$322 million, or $1.30, a year earlier, the Aurora, Ontario-
based company said today in a statement.  North American light-vehicle production rose 17 percent in
the first quarter to 3.97 million units, according to researcher
IHS Automotive. That helped boost Magna sales by 6.6 percent to
$7.67 billion. The average estimate of nine analysts was for
sales of $7.49 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Magna raised its annual sales forecast to as much as $30.5
billion, from a Feb. 24 projection of as much as $29.5 billion.
The company also said it expects the industry to make 14.4
million vehicles in North America. Magna in February projected
output of 13.8 million vehicles.  Separately, Magna said today it signed a “memorandum of
understanding” to produce an entry-level Infiniti luxury
vehicle for  Nissan Motor Co. (7201)  starting in 2014. No details were
disclosed about where the vehicle will be produced.  Potential Acquisitions  Magna, which ended the quarter with $1.27 billion in cash,
said it is looking at “a number” of potential acquisitions,
Don Walker, chief executive officer, said to reporters today
after the annual meeting in Toronto.  “If we can get technology or gain business with a customer
we want to grow with, we’ll certainly look at it,” Walker said.
“There are a number we’re looking at right now.”  While the company typically has made acquisitions of
companies with $600 million in annual revenue, spending $200
million to $250 million, it is willing to spend much more,
Walker said,  “Typically we look at smaller acquisitions, but we have
the ability to do big ones, too,” he said, such as those that
are “much bigger” than a company with $600 million in revenue.  To contact the reporter on this story:
