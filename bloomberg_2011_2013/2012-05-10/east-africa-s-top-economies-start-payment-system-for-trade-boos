Kenya,  Uganda  and Tanzania will start
a system to speed up financial transactions among East Africa’s
biggest economies in a bid to boost trade, said Natu el-Maamry
Mwamba, deputy governor of Tanzania’s central bank.  The payment system will be faster than current check-
clearing method, Mwamba said at a conference in Kampala, the
Ugandan capital, today.  Rwanda will join the payment regional system shortly after
its creation, while Burundi “is still behind” and will first
have to create a local payment system before moving to a
regional one, said Emmanuel Tumusiime-Mutebile, governor of
Uganda’s central bank.  To contact the reporter on this story:
