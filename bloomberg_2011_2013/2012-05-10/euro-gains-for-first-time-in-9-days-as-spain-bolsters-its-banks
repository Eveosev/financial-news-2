The euro strengthened for the first
time in nine days against the dollar as  Spain  moved to bolster
confidence in the country’s lenders, increasing confidence the
region’s debt crisis can be contained.  The 17-nation currency climbed from a 12-week low versus
the yen as a technical indicator signaled the slide in the
currency was poised to end. The pound fell against most of its
major counterparts before policy makers decide on whether to
extend a 325 billion-pound ($524 billion)  bond-purchase  program
that’s due to finish this month. Sweden’s krona weakened after
report showed  inflation  slowed for a second month in April.  “We need some more bad news for the euro to take another
leg lower,” said  Neil Jones , head of European hedge-fund sales
at Mizuho Corporate Bank Ltd. in  London . “We haven’t really got
it today. It’s pretty much the same kind of news we’ve had since
the weekend. There’s nothing fresh.”  The euro rose 0.2 percent to $1.2948 at 10:13 a.m. London
time after declining to $1.2912 yesterday, the lowest level
since Jan. 23. The shared currency gained 0.2 percent to 103.17.
It slipped to 102.76 yesterday, the weakest since Feb. 16. The
yen was little changed at 79.69 per dollar.  The euro’s 14-day relative strength index against the yen
fell to 29 yesterday, below the level of 30 that some traders
see as signaling an asset is poised to reverse direction.  Spain said it would take over  Bankia (BKIA)  SA, the nation’s
third-largest lender, adding momentum to Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy ’s efforts to bolster the financial system amid concern
that possible hidden losses on banks’ books may push up the
government’s borrowing costs.  Pound Falls  The pound fell 0.3 percent to 80.39 pence per euro, and
dropped 0.2 percent to $1.6102.  Bank of England  policy makers will halt their bond-buying
program, according to 43 of 51 economists in a Bloomberg News
survey. The rest expect an increase of at least 25 billion
pounds. That’s the biggest split on the direction of policy
since October, when the bank resumed quantitative easing.  The krona fell 0.4 percent to 8.9394 per euro and weakened
0.3 percent to 6.9054 versus the dollar.  Sweden’s inflation rate slowed to  an annual  1.3 percent
from 1.5 percent in March,  Statistics Sweden  said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
