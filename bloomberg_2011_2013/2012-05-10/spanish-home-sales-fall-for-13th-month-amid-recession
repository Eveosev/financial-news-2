Spanish home sales declined for a
13th month in March as the euro area’s fourth-largest economy
relapsed into a  recession  and banks reduced lending.  The number of  transactions  fell 22.7 percent to 25,464 from
a year earlier, the National Statistics Institute in  Madrid  said
in an e-mailed statement today. That compares with a decline of
31.8 percent in February, the most in six months.  Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy , in power since December,
plans to increase tomorrow the real estate asset losses banks
have to recognize, as the recession worsens the sector’s woes
amid a surge in bad loans and unemployment above 24 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
