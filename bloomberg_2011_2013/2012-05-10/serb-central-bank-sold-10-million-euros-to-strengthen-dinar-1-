Serbia ’s central bank sold euros
today to strengthen the dinar, acting in the market just before
it left the benchmark interest rate unchanged at a policy
meeting.  The Belgrade-based Narodna Banka Srbije sold 10 million
euros ($12.9 million) to “ensure the smooth functioning” of
the market, it said in a statement on its website. The dinar
traded at 112.2370 at 5:02 p.m. in Belgrade, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  The central bank, which left the two-week repurchase rate
at 9.5 percent for a fourth month, has spent a total of 763.5
million euros since the start of 2012 to prop up the dinar. The
currency has weakened 10.3 percent against the euro compared
with the same period last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
