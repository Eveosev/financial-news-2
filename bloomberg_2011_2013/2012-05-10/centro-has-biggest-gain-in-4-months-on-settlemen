Centro Retail Australia (CRF) , formed from
the mall manager’s reorganization, had the biggest gain in more
than four months in Sydney trading after agreeing to a A$200
million ($201 million) settlement in a shareholder suit.  Shares of Melbourne-based Centro Retail rose as much as 3.9
percent, the biggest gain since Jan. 3. The shares climbed 6
cents to A$1.91 at 11:51 a.m. in Sydney.  Centro’s former shareholders, who claimed they were misled
over the company’s debt, agreed to end a lawsuit in  Melbourne  in
mid trial after the mall manager and PricewaterhouseCoopers
consented to the Australian record A$200 million settlement. The
agreement was completed today with a request to Federal Court
Justice Michelle Gordon to end the trial,  Slater & Gordon Ltd. (SGH) ,
one of the law firms that sued, said in a statement.  Under the agreement, Centro Retail will pay A$85 million,
PricewaterhouseCoopers will pay A$67 million,  CNPR Group (CNP) , Centro
Retail’s holding company, will contribute A$10 million and A$38
million will come from insurers, CNPR said in a statement. The
agreement must be approved by a judge, with a hearing scheduled
for June 19.  Slater & Gordon, which represented mostly retail investors,
will get A$50 million of the settlement, with A$150 million
going to Maurice Blackburn Lawyers, whose clients included
institutional investors.  Centro’s 2007 annual report failed to disclose A$1.5
billion of short-term liabilities by classifying them as non-
current, and the company didn’t declare $1.75 billion of short-
term debt guarantees of an associated company, Federal Court
Justice John Middleton said in a ruling in June. The mall
manager also didn’t disclose A$500 million of short-term debt at
one of its units, he said.  Centro Properties Group shares fell 76 percent in Sydney on
Dec. 17, 2007 after the company said it was struggling to
refinance debt because of the collapse of the subprime mortgage
market. The share slump wiped A$4.98 billion from the market
value of Centro Properties and Centro Retail Group at the time.  The case is: Richard Kirby v. Centro Properties Ltd.
