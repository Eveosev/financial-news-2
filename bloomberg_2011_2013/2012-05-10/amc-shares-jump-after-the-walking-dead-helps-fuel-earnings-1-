AMC Networks Inc. (AMCX) , the cable-TV
company spun out of  Cablevision Systems Corp. (CVC)  in June, rose 2.2
percent after better ratings helped first-quarter profit top
analysts’ estimates.  Net income from continuing operations was 60 cents a share
in the period, the New York-based company said today in a
statement. Analysts had projected 45 cents on average, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. The stock also was raised to a
buy recommendation from a neutral rating by  David Joyce , an
analyst at Miller Tabak & Co.  AMC shares climbed to $40.50 at the close in New York. The
stock has gained 7.8 percent this year.  The company’s networks posted ratings gains in the first
quarter, helping fuel advertising revenue, Chief Executive
Officer Josh Sapan said in the statement. AMC zombie drama “The
Walking Dead” ended its second season with 9 million viewers,
up 50 percent from a year earlier, he said. “Mad Men,” a show
about New York advertising executives in the 1960s, is having
its best-rated season, he said.  First-quarter revenue increased almost 20 percent to $326
million from a year earlier, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
