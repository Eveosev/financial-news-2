Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) , the Wall
Street bank that generated 57 percent of its first-quarter
revenue from trading, had a loss from that business on one day
in the period, down from 17 during the preceding three months.  The firm’s traders made more than $100 million on 24 of the
62 days in the quarter ended March 31, according to a quarterly
regulatory filing today by the New York-based company. The
quarter produced the fewest days of trading losses since the
first quarter of 2011, the filing shows.  Goldman Sachs, the fifth-biggest U.S. bank by  assets ,
reported last month that revenue from trading stocks, bonds and
other securities dropped 14 percent in the first quarter from a
year earlier. That followed a 21 percent decline in trading
revenue for 2011, the worst performance since 2008.  Morgan Stanley, the sixth-biggest  U.S. bank , said this week
that its traders lost money on four days during the first
quarter, up from three a year earlier. Bank of America Corp.,
the No. 2 U.S. lender, reported last week that it had trading
profits on every day in the period.  Trading losses never exceeded Goldman Sachs’s value-at-risk
limit -- a measure of how much the company estimates it could
lose in the securities markets in a single day -- during the
quarter, according to the filing. Average daily value-at-risk
dropped to $95 million in the three months ended March 31, from
$135 million in the prior period, the firm reported on April 17.  To contact the reporter on this story:
