Emirates Aluminium Co., an Abu Dhabi-
based smelter, will approach banks in June to finance its
expansion, MEED reported, citing people familiar with the
project.  Negotiations with  export credit agencies  from Korea, the
U.S., France and  Germany  will conclude soon, paving the way for
the company to seek commercial funding, according to the report.
Mubadala Development Co. and Dubai Aluminium Co., Emalâ€™s owners,
are also planning to issue a project bond to fund the expansion,
MEED said.  The company hopes to reach agreement on financing by
October, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
