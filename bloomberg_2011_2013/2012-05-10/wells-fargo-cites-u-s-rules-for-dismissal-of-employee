Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC) , the largest U.S.
mortgage lender, said federal banking regulations led it to fire
a Milwaukee employee for a 40-year-old shoplifting violation.  The dismissal was tied to background checks across the
mortgage business that have led to the firing of “a handful”
of employees, according to  Jason Menke , a spokesman at the San
Francisco-based company. Menke declined to provide the number of
firings. The customer-service employee at the home-loan unit was
fired after five years of employment for the 1972 charge, the
Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported  May 5 .  The policy is in accordance with Section 19 of the Federal
Deposit Insurance Act which prohibits depository institutions
from employing workers with a criminal record tied to dishonesty
or breaches of trust, Wells Fargo said today in a statement.  “The decision to terminate team members over criminal
matters that occurred prior to their employment with Wells Fargo
may seem tough - we recognize that these situations are
difficult for everyone involved,” Wells Fargo said in the
statement. “Laws and regulations related to the employment of
bank employees are designed to protect the interests of all
consumers who put their trust in financial service companies.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
