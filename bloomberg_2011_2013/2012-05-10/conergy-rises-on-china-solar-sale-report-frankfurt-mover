Conergy AG (CGYK)  rose to its highest since
February after a report by the Financial Times Deutschland said
the German solar-panel maker is close to selling a 30 percent
stake to a Chinese peer.  Conergy jumped as much as 16 percent to 57 euro cents a
share, and was 11 percent higher at 54.6 euro cents at 11 a.m.
local time. What really remains is when the deal will be
completed, the newspaper said, citing an unidentified person
with knowledge of the deal who declined to name the buyer.  “We’re interesting for a set of Asian companies,” Antje
Stephan, a Conergy spokeswoman, said in an e-mailed statement.
“We get requests on and off, they’re confidential and we handle
them confidentially. To put this into perspective very clearly:
There is no deal imminent.”  Conergy, once  Germany ’s largest solar company, and its
domestic counterparts are under pressure as subsidies fall at
home amid competition from Chinese companies depressed margins
and panel prices. The Jiangxi, China-based solar wafer-maker LDK
Solar Co. bid about 24.2 million euros in January for the German
solar company  Sunways AG. (SWW)   The Hamburg-based company is cutting jobs, halting
production of wafers and cells, and focusing on end-product
modules and services in a bid to become profitable. Conergy has
a market value of about 88 million euros ($114 million).  To contact the reporter on this story:
