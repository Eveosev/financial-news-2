Iceland’s  Supreme Court  ruled that a
former employee of Kaupthing Bank Hf be held personally liable
for loans she received from the failed lender.  Delia Kristin Howser, who worked at a local branch, was
found liable for a 6.6 million-krona ($52,000) loan she obtained
to purchase the bank’s shares, according to the  ruling .  Kaupthing’s board in a letter dated Sept. 28, 2008, had
sought to revoke personal liability on loans given to a number
of executives in connection with stock purchases. The decision
was taken following a drop in the share price. Kaupthing
collapsed on Oct. 9, 2008, after it was unable to secure the
short-term funding needed to stay afloat.  The bank’s resolution committee has made similar claims
against a number of former executives, including then Chairman
Sigurdur Einarsson, former Chief Risk Officer Steingrimur
Karason and the bank’s Ex-Iceland CEO Ingolfur Helgason.  To contact the reporter on this story:
