European Central Bank council member
Jens Weidmann said if policy makers stick to the bank’s core
principles, inflation will remain contained,  Germany ’s Bild
newspaper reported, citing an interview.  “The ECB council decides on monetary policy,” Weidmann,
who also heads Germany’s Bundesbank, is quoted as saying. “I
stand for monetary stability in the euro area. At the moment, it
is decisive that the guardians of the currency don’t let their
cart get hitched to the carriage of fiscal policy. If we hold to
our principles, then there is no danger that inflation will get
out of control.”  Weidmann also said that Germany, which for many years
enjoyed inflation below the euro-area average, may now see
above-average inflation rates due to its strong economy and low
unemployment, Bild reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
