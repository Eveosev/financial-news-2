U.K. gilts fell, with 10-year yields
rising the most in almost eight weeks, after the  Bank of England 
halted its bond-purchase program amid the threat of inflation.  Ten-year bonds snapped a seven-day gain as the Monetary
Policy Committee held its quantitative-easing target at 325
billion pounds ($525 billion). Eight of 51 economists surveyed
by Bloomberg before the decision predicted an increase of at
least 25 billion pounds. Sterling strengthened after the
announcement.  Ten-year gilt yields  dropped to a record yesterday
as signs the  European debt crisis  is worsening spurred demand
for safety.  “Gilts sold off as the market was a little disappointed
the BOE didn’t deliver more QE,” said Adam McCormack, head of
gilt sales at Barclays Plc in London. “There was maybe a 20 or
25 percent chance of more QE being priced into the market. We’d
been driven to record yield lows by the European situation, so
there was that much greater scope for gilts to react.”  The 10-year  yield  rose nine basis points, or 0.09
percentage point, to 2.01 percent at 4:01 p.m.  London  time after
gaining as much as 11 basis points, the biggest increase since
March 16. The 4 percent bond due in March 2022 fell 0.875, or
8.75 pounds per 1,000-pound face amount, to 117.825. The yield
dropped to 1.881 percent yesterday, the lowest since Bloomberg
began compiling the data in 1989.  Double Dip  The nine-member MPC led by Governor  Mervyn King  left its
benchmark  interest rate  at a record-low 0.5 percent today, where
it has been since March 2009.  With the U.K. suffering its first  double-dip  recession
since 1975, officials had to balance the need to bolster the
economy with the threat of inflation, which has been above their
2 percent target for more than two years. The MPC made its
decision with new quarterly economic forecasts that will be
published next week.  Minutes of today’s decision will be published on May 23 and
may reveal a split among policy makers.  David Miles , the only
MPC member to vote for more stimulus last month, has since said
that decision looks vindicated, while  Martin Weale  said data
showing the U.K. slipped back into recession strengthened the
argument for more QE.  Data last week showed  manufacturing  and services weakened
in April after the economy shrank 0.2 percent in the first
quarter.  Factory output  increased 0.9 percent in March after
falling a revised 1.1 percent the previous month, the  Office for
National Statistics  said today.  Annual Return  Gilts have returned 0.1 percent this year, according to
indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European Federation of
Financial Analysts Societies. They surged 17 percent in 2011 as
the European debt crisis worsened.  The pound appreciated 0.2 percent to $1.6152 after falling
as much as 0.2 percent. The U.K. currency was little changed at
80.18 pence per euro. It earlier advanced to 80.01 pence, the
strongest level since November 2008.  “There was a little relief among pound bulls that they
didn’t do QE,” said  Daragh Maher , a currency strategist at HSBC
Holdings Plc in London. “The reaction is proving small. Still,
it removes one downside event risk to the pound, and may
encourage some to test the downside in euro-sterling for that
elusive break of 80 pence per euro.”  A bullish position is a bet an asset will rise.  The pound has appreciated 4.8 percent in the past three
months, the best performer of the 10 developed-nation currencies
tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The dollar
gained 2 percent, and the euro fell 0.1 percent.  Demand for U.K. government bonds this week pushed the
 difference  between two- and 10-year yields to the narrowest in
more than three years.  The spread was at 156 basis points today after shrinking to
150 basis points yesterday, the least since January 2009,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg based on closing prices.  The spread may encounter resistance at its January 2009 low
at 131 basis points, and may find support at the 100-day moving
average at 171 basis points, the data show.  Resistance refers to an area on a yield chart where
analysts expect orders to sell a security to be grouped. Support
is an area where they anticipate buy orders may be clustered.  To contact the reporter on this story:
