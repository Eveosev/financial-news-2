Mexico ’s peso headed for its biggest
weekly drop in more than five months as Greece’s struggle to
form a government sapped demand for the Latin American nation’s
higher-yielding assets.  The currency depreciated 0.3 percent to 13.5532 per  U.S.
dollar  at 7:51 a.m. in Mexico City, extending its weekly drop to
2.7 percent, the most since the five days ended Nov. 25.  The yield on Mexico’s peso bonds due in 2024 rose two basis
points, 0.02 percentage point, to 6.31 percent, according to
prices compiled by Bloomberg. The price fell 0.21 centavo to
131.94 centavos per peso.  The peso declined as Greece’s political leaders began a
fifth day of talks to carve out a government. In November,
Mexico’s Currency Exchange Commission started offering $400
million of its reserves daily to thwart volatility in the peso
as Europe’s debt crisis intensified.  To contact the reporter on this story:
