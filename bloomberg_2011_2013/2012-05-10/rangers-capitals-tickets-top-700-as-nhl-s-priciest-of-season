The  New York  Rangers’ latest Game 7
has pushed the average ticket price above $700, the most
expensive for a National Hockey League contest outside the
Stanley Cup finals in at least the past three years.  The Rangers play the  Washington Capitals  at New York’s
Madison Square Garden on May 12, with the winner advancing to
the Eastern Conference final against the  New Jersey Devils .  The average ticket listing price is $718, according to
TiqIQ, an aggregator of the online resale ticket market. Outside
of the Stanley Cup finals, no NHL game has had a higher average
ticket price since TiqIQ opened in 2009.  “Anytime there’s a big game at the Garden, it becomes more
than a game, it’s an event,” TiqIQ spokesman Chris Matcovich
said in a telephone interview.  Resale prices for Game 7 of last year’s  Stanley Cup  finals
in Vancouver between the Canucks and the  Boston Bruins  topped
$5,000.  Face value of tickets ranges from $108 to $1,205 for Game
7, according to the Rangers’ box office. At TiqIQ, where more
than 3,000 seats are on sale, tickets are listed from $279 to
$4,999.  Another online ticket aggregator, SeatGeek.com, said the
average price for Game 7 tickets already sold is $558 today, up
from $459 yesterday. SeatGeek’s current average listing price is
about $600.  “All the good deals get scooped up and then the prices
really go up because people are only able to buy what’s left on
the market,” SeatGeek spokesman Will Flaherty said. “And then
in the last 24 hours before the game it will decline.”  ‘Feed Off Crowd’  After New York’s Game 6 loss to  Washington  last night,
Rangers captain  Ryan Callahan  said home-ice advantage will be a
key and that the team would “feed off the crowd” in Game 7.  The Rangers, the top seed in the East, have already played
one decisive Game 7 at home, beating the Ottawa Senators 2-1 on
April 26 for their first playoff series win since 2008. The
average ticket price for that game reached $500 on the secondary
market. The Capitals played a Game 7 the same day, beating the
Bruins 2-1 in overtime in  Boston .  “What happened in previous series doesn’t matter,”
Callahan said. “You throw that out the window.”  The last time the Rangers played a  Game 7  at home twice in
the same postseason was 1993-94, when they beat the Devils and
 Vancouver  Canucks in successive series to win the Stanley Cup.  The Rangers never have lost a Game 7 at home, going 4-0.
They are 4-5 in all Game 7 appearances.  The most expensive ticket for an NHL game this year at
TiqIQ had been a $522 average for the Winter Classic, which was
played outdoors on Jan. 2 between the Rangers and  Philadelphia
Flyers  at Citizens Bank Park.  To contact the reporter on this story:
