Petroplus Holding AG (PPHN) ,  Europe ’s
largest independent refiner before filing for insolvency, owes
Sonatrach Group more than $250 million for crude sales, Reuters
 reported , citing an identified Algerian energy official.  The Algerian state oil company hasn’t received payment for
several cargoes of crude it delivered to the refiner, according
to Reuters.  An official at Wenger Plattner, the administrator of the
insolvent refiner, declined to comment if Sonatrach had filed a
claim when contacted today by telephone. Angelika Rittner said
businesses and individuals can submit claims for any money owed
during a six-month period, which closes at the end of September.  To contact the reporter on this story:
