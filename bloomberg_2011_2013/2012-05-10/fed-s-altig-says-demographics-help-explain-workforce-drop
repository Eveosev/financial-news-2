About 40 percent of the decline in
the U.S. labor force participation  rate  since 2000 can be
explained by demographic factors such as the retirement of the
 baby boomers , Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta Research Director
David Altig said in an online commentary.  The decline in the labor force has been “influenced by a
confounding mix of demographic change and other behavioral
changes that nobody seems to understand,” Altig wrote in an
online posting on his Macroblog site.  Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  says the decline
reflects weakness in the economy that’s causing discouraged
Americans to leave the workforce. It is “very important” to
look not just at the  unemployment rate , which “no doubt
understates the weakness of the labor market in some broad
sense,” Bernanke said in February.  The participation rate, which indicates the share of
working-age people in the  labor force , fell to 63.6 percent last
month, the lowest since December 1981, from 63.8 percent the
month before. The  unemployment  rate fell last month to a three-
year low of 8.1 percent as people left the labor force.  Altig said that 0.9 percentage points of the decline in the
participation rate since the beginning of the last recession in
December 2007 can be explained by demographic trends.
Subtracting those “still leaves 1.5 percentage points to be
explained” by the weak economy.  To contact the reporters on this story:
