Pirates boarded a Suezmax oil tanker
able to carry 1 million barrels of crude, which would be the
largest vessel seized in more than a year.  “They are on board the vessel with guns,” Ody Valatsas,
chartering manager at ship owner Dynacom Tankers Management Ltd.
in  Athens , said by e-mail, declining to comment further. The
ship is the Smyrni, he said.  The vessel was 15.8 meters (52 feet) deep in the water
after calling at a loading terminal in  Turkey , according to
ship-tracking data compiled by Bloomberg. A tanker of the same
size was hijacked at 12:30 p.m. local time 430 miles northeast
of Yemen’s Socotra Island, Jacqueline Sherriff, a European Union
Naval Force spokeswoman, said by phone.  Pirates mounted 102 attacks worldwide last quarter, the
International Maritime Bureau said last month. About 3,500
Somali pirates are attacking vessels off  Africa ’s eastern coast,
the  United Nations  said in February. Ransoms worth $160 million
were paid to release 31 hijacked vessels in 2011, according to a
One Earth Future Foundation report.  The seized tanker is the largest vessel to be hijacked
since February 2011, according to Sherriff and the IMB.  A smaller Aframax tanker escaped yesterday from pirates
armed with rocket-propelled grenades and AK-47 assault rifles
off the Somali coast, Cyrus Mody, spokesman for the IMB, said by
phone today. The pirates fired seven RPGs and 300 bullets,
according to the London-based group tracking incidents.  To contact the reporters on this story:
