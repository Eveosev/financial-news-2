Assured Guaranty Ltd. (AGO) , the only
active U.S. municipal bond insurer, said operating income fell
71 percent because of  Greece ’s sovereign-debt default.  Operating income, a measure of profitability that excludes
some items, fell to $71.2 million in the first quarter, compared
with $247.4 million a year earlier, the Hamilton, Bermuda-based
company said in a regulatory filing today. Taking into account
changing credit spreads, the company reported a net loss of $483
million, or $2.65 a share.  The drop in income was primarily due to losses on insured
Greek debt,  Assured Guaranty  said. The company expects to lose
$231.9 million due to the country’s default, net of reinsurance
and the value of exchanged securities.  Demand for bond insurance was hurt by “rating
uncertainty” in the quarter, according to the company, which
Moody’s Investor’s Service has on review for a downgrade.  The insurer said Deutsche Bank AG agreed to pay $165.6
million in cash to settle a lawsuit over losses on securities
backed by home loans. The Frankfurt-based bank also agreed to
share losses on certain securities.  (The company will hold a conference call tomorrow at 7 a.m.
 New York  time. To listen, dial +1-877-317-6789.)  To contact the reporter on this story:
