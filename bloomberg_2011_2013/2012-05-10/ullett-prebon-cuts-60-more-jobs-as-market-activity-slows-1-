Tullett Prebon Plc (TLPR) , the British
inter-dealer broker run by  Terry Smith , cut a further 60 jobs as
market activity in the first part of 2012 was “slightly lower”
than in the year-earlier period.  The company cut about 140 posts this year, London-based
Tullett Prebon said in a statement today. That’s up from the 80
it said it would eliminate in March. Revenue for the first four
months of the year was 305 million pounds ($493 million).  “In the light of the challenging market and competitive
conditions and the increased costs faced by the business
relating to electronic platform development and other costs
related to impending regulatory changes, a number of actions
were taken towards the end of 2011 to reduce costs,” the
company said in today’s statement.  The stock fell 2.7 percent to 308.6 pence in London
trading, for a market value of about 672 million pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
