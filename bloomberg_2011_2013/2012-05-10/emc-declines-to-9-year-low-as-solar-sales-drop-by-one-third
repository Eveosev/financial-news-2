MEMC Electronic Materials Inc. (WFR) , the
second-largest U.S. polysilicon maker, fell the most in more
than 10 years after posting a first-quarter loss 20 times
greater than a year earlier as solar sales lagged.  MEMC fell 25 percent to $2.45 at the close in New York, the
most since Sept. 28, 2001. Shares had fallen 18 percent this
year through yesterday.  Revenue in the company’s solar energy unit dropped 37
percent to $303.2 million compared with a year earlier, St.
Peters, Missouri-based MEMC said in a statement released after
the close of regular trading yesterday.  “We expect the market environment to remain challenging
throughout 2012,” Chief Executive Officer Ahmad Chatila said
yesterday during a conference call with investors. “Price
reductions continue, but the rate has declined.”  Prices for polysilicon, the main raw material in solar
cells,  fell  70 percent in the last year to $23.78 a kilogram as
Chinese companies increased production and demand for panels
slowed. MEMC announced in December it would fire 20 percent of
its workforce and cut production. The unit’s president quit last
week.  The company’s net loss for the quarter was $92 million, or
40 cents a share, compared with a $4.5 million loss, or 2 cents
a share,  a year earlier . The loss was more than the 26-cent
average estimate of 11 analysts compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
