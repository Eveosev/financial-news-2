“significantly better” net income in 2011 after earnings in
2010 fell by half to 64 million euros ($83 million), Financial
Times Deutschland reported, citing Chief Executive Officer Frank Haun.  Sales rose 4 percent to 936 million euros last year, Haun
said in an interview, according to the German newspaper. New
orders also improved, with 60 percent to 80 percent coming from
outside  Germany , Haun told FT Deutschland, without giving
