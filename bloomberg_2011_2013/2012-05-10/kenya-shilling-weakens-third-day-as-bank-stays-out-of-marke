Kenya ’s shilling weakened for a third
day, as the central bank continued to stay out of the money
market.  The currency of East Africa’s biggest economy depreciated
as much as 0.5 percent to 83.70 per dollar and was trading 0.2
percent weaker at 83.45 as of 2:20 p.m.  “The shilling is on a retreat due to high liquidity
prevailing in the money market and the decision by the central
bank not to intervene for the third day,” John Muli a dealer at
Nairobi-based African Banking Corp., said in a phone interview
today.  The  interbank rate  rose to 16.815 percent from 16.813
percent,  NIC Bank Ltd. (NICB)  said in a note to clients.  The central bank refrained from selling  repurchase
agreements  for a third day, an official in the bank’s money
market department, who asked not to be identified citing policy,
said in a phone interview. The bank removed a total of 26
billion shillings ($312 million) from the market through one-
week repo auctions from April 27 through May 7 to support the
currency.  Tanzania’s shilling gained, appreciating less than 0.1
percent to 1,581.15 to the dollar. The Ugandan shilling gained
for a second day, appreciating as much as 0.4 percent to 2,470
to the dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
