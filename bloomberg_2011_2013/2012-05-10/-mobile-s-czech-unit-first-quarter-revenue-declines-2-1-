T-Mobile International AG’s Czech
unit said first-quarter total revenue fell 2.1 percent to 6.4
billion koruna ($328 million) as prices of telecommunications
services and average revenue per user declined.  Ebitda, or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation
and amortization, fell to 3.1 billion koruna in the three months
ended March 31, from 6.6 percent from a year ago, the Prague-
based company said in an e-mailed statement today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
