Turkeyâ€™s government will use as much
as 90 percent of proceeds from state-land sales to rebuild
disaster areas and reconstruct apartments to withstand
earthquakes, Finance Minister  Mehmet Simsek  said.  Turkey may raise 14.8 billion liras ($8.3 billion) if all
buyers pay the money upfront, qualifying for a 20 percent
discount, Simsek said. The sale of former forest land will
legalize buildings that were illegally constructed there.  To contact the reporter on this story:
