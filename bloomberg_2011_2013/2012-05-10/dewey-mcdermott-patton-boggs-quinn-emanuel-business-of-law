Dewey & LeBoeuf LLP co-chairmen
 Jeffrey Kessler  and Richard Shutran left to join rival law
firms, leaving just two members of Dewey’s new chairman’s office
in place.  Kessler, head of litigation, will start next week at
Winston & Strawn LLP, which has hired about 60 Dewey lawyers at
its offices, including 24 litigation partners, said the Chicago-
based firm’s chairman, Dan Webb. Shutran, head of the corporate
department, will join  O’Melveny & Myers LLP  with four other
Dewey partners, that firm said in a statement yesterday.  Webb, who was the New York Stock Exchange’s lawyer for its
pay case against ex-Chairman  Richard Grasso , called Kessler
after Dewey told partners in an April 30 memo they were free to
explore other job opportunities, he said. Kessler’s sports-
litigation group is the best in the U.S. and the hirings will
add to Winston & Strawn’s group dealing with antitrust and
securities litigation, he said in a phone interview yesterday.  “It’s a big transaction,” Webb said. The Dewey lawyers
will mostly be based in New York, where Winston & Strawn wants
more litigators, with some joining in Chicago,  Washington  and
 Los Angeles , he said.  Amid mounting defections in March, New York-based Dewey
said it was creating a new chairman’s office with five co-equal
members from its most profitable groups. They included  Martin Bienenstock , who runs the firm’s restructuring group; Shutran,
Kessler; and Charles Landgraf, who runs the Washington office
and the legislative and public policy group.  Dewey ousted the fifth member of the chairman’s office,
 Steven Davis , formerly sole chairman, after Manhattan District
Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. began a probe into possible wrongdoing
at the firm, Dewey told partners in an April 29 memo obtained by
Bloomberg.  Michael Sitrick , a spokesman for Dewey, didn’t return a
call seeking comment on the departures.  Firm News  Walsh to Head McDermott’s International Restructuring Group  McDermott Will & Emery LLP hired restructuring lawyer
Timothy W. Walsh away from DLA Piper LLP and appointed him
international head of the firm’s restructuring and insolvency
practice.  The hire is part of the firm’s effort to expand its
worldwide restructuring and bankruptcy capabilities, McDermott
said in a statement.  Walsh was previously vice chairman of DLA Piper’s
restructuring practice group. His practice focuses on all
aspects of restructuring transactions in major domestic and
cross-border bankruptcy-related proceedings as well as out-of-
court restructurings.  With the addition of Walsh, the firm is also bolstering its
offerings to the private-equity community.  “As we build our international restructuring practice, we
will also be able to deliver more holistic services to our
private-equity clients, such as in- and out-of-court
restructurings as a means of facilitating acquisitions as well
as dispositions of portfolio companies,” David Goldman, partner
and head of McDermott’s corporate advisory practice group, said
in the statement.  McDermott’s restructuring and insolvency practice has more
than 40 lawyers around the world. In the past 60 days, McDermott
has brought on board nine corporate partners in the U.S. and
 Europe . The new hires reflect an expansion of the firm’s
international transactional capabilities, with a focus on
private equity, energy and cross-border mergers and
acquisitions, the firm said.  McDermott has more than 1,000 lawyers with offices in
Boston, Brussels, Chicago, Dusseldorf, Houston,  London , Los
Angeles, Miami, Milan, Munich,  New York , Paris, Rome, Washington
and Orange County and Silicon Valley,  California , and a
strategic alliance with MWE China Law Offices in Shanghai.  Ex-CFTC Commissioner Dunn Named Chairman of U.S. Swap Database  Patton Boggs LLP’s Michael V. Dunn, a member of the
Commodity Futures Trading Commission until last year, was named
non-executive chairman of the largest database of U.S. swap
information as regulators prepare to complete an overhaul of
financial regulations required under the Dodd-Frank Act.  The Depository Trust & Clearing Corp. yesterday said Dunn,
who joined the commission in December 2004, would help the
database align the needs of participants in the markets and
regulators. Dodd-Frank intends for so-called swap data
repositories to provide regulators access to information about
the price and volume of trades in an effort to increase
transparency about the $708 trillion global swaps market.  “I’m just looking forward to taking the next step toward
fulfilling the Dodd-Frank Act,” Dunn, also a senior adviser at
Washington-based Patton Boggs, said in a telephone interview.
Dunn stepped down on Oct. 24 from the CFTC, the main U.S.
derivatives regulator implementing Dodd-Frank.  The 2010 financial-regulation overhaul was enacted after
largely unregulated swaps helped fuel the 2008 credit crisis.  Moves  Quinn Emanuel Woos Allen & Overy London Arbitration Partners  Two  Allen & Overy  LLP arbitration partners, including head
of the international arbitration practice Stephen Jagusch, are
joining Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan LLP’s London office as
partners.  Jagusch will become head of Quinn Emanuel’s international
arbitration practice. He and Anthony Sinclair specialize in
international commercial and treaty arbitration.  “London is the epicenter of international arbitration. We
are delighted that advocates of Stephen and Anthony’s stature
are joining us,” said Richard East, co-managing partner of the
firm’s London office.  With the addition of Jagusch and Sinclair, whose start date
hasn’t been determined, the firm has added five new partners to
the international arbitration group in the last 12 months.  Managing partner  John Quinn  said that the firm’s expansion
in the international arbitration area isn’t over. “We will be
adding more partner and senior level talent in other arbitration
centers in the coming months.”  Allen & Overy said in a statement that “Stephen Jagusch
and Anthony Sinclair have given notice of their intention to
resign from Allen & Overy at the end of the 2013 financial
year.” Judith Gill will assume the role of head of the practice
at Allen & Overy.  Quinn Emanuel has more than 650 lawyers in its business
litigation firm with offices in Los Angeles, New York, San
Francisco, Washington,  Chicago , Tokyo, London, Moscow, Hamburg,
Mannheim, Germany, and Silicon Valley, California.  Office of Thrift Acting Director Joins Venable Team  Venable LLP added to its financial services practice with
the addition of former Office of Thrift Supervision Acting
Director John E. Bowman, who joins the firm in Washington and
Los Angeles as a partner.  As head of the OTS, Bowman also served as a director on the
five-member board of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. He
joined the OTS, which regulated thrifts, savings and loans, and
their holding companies, in 1999, rising to the position of
deputy director and chief counsel before taking over as acting
director in early 2009.  Earlier in his career, Bowman served for many years as the
Assistant General Counsel for Banking and Finance at the U.S.
Treasury Department. During his 14-year tenure at Treasury, he
provided advice and counsel to the senior leadership of the
department on legal and strategic implications on a broad range
of issues from financial modernization to the financing of the
Federal debt.  Brock Landry, co-head of Venable’s government division,
said in a statement, “Venable’s finance and consumer protection
regulatory practices already boast former government officials
from the Treasury, OCC, FDIC, SEC, FTC, DOJ, and numerous other
agencies, and John’s extensive experience at the highest levels
of government brings a new dimension to that lineup.”  Venablehas more than 500 attorneys at seven U.S. offices.  Mayer Brown Adds to Real Estate Practice in New York  David M. Stewart, a partner with Latham & Watkins LLP, has
moved to Mayer Brown LLP real estate practice in New York.  Stewart has experience representing clients in subordinate
real estate lending and structured finance transactions,
primarily in and around the commercial mortgage-backed
securities market. He has a particular focus in his practice on
master repurchase agreements and other structures that allow
mortgage finance companies to raise their source capital.  Mayer Brown has 20 offices worldwide in the Americas, Asia
and Europe.  Kirkland & Ellis Adds Four IP Lawyers in New York Office  Four lawyers at Kaye Scholer LLP have left the firm to join
the New York office of Kirkland & Ellis LLP.  Leora Ben-Ami, Thomas Fleming, Patricia Carson and
Christopher Jagoe are now partners in Kirkland’s intellectual
property practice group.  Ben-Ami focuses on patent litigation and has represented
pharmaceutical and biotechnology firms such as Pfizer Inc.,
Genentech Inc. and DuPont Co., according to Kirkland’s
statement.  Fleming specializes in IP litigation and has tried cases in
the areas of biotechnology, pharmaceuticals and chemical
products, as well as in the areas of wireless technology and
telecommunications. Carson focuses on patent litigation and
patent counseling matters, including IP due diligence and
licensing in a variety of fields such as pharmaceutical,
biotechnology, chemical, medical device and consumer health
care.  Jagoe focuses on patent litigation related to chemical,
pharmaceutical and biotechnology matters. He has represented
clients such as  Roche Holding AG , Ariad Pharmaceuticals Inc.,
Pioneer Hi-Bred International Inc. and DuPont.  Kirkland & Ellis LLP has 1,500 attorneys with offices in
New York, Chicago, Hong Kong, London, Los Angeles, Munich,
Shanghai, Washington, San Francisco and  Palo Alto , California.  Deals  Bed Bath & Beyond Agrees to Buy Cost Plus for $495 Million  Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. (BBBY) , the operator of more than 1,000
home-furnishings stores, agreed to buy  Cost Plus Inc. (CPWM)  for about
$495 million in cash to add its World Market and Cost Plus
Imports chains.  Proskauer Rose LLP as legal adviser to Bed Bath & Beyond.
The firm’s New York mergers and acquisitions partners Peter Samuels, Rima Moawad and Reid Arstark were involved.  Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP acted as legal
advisers to Cost Plus. The Skadden team included Los Angeles M&A
partners Rick Madden and Brian McCarthy; Palo Alto, California,
partner Joseph Yaffe from the executive compensation and
benefits group; and Los Angeles partner Eric Waxman from the
commercial litigation and trial practice.  The offer of about $22 a share will be funded with
available cash, the companies said yesterday in a statement. The
companies expect the deal to be completed in Bed Bath & Beyond’s
fiscal second quarter and add “slightly” to earnings in the
current year. The offer is 22 percent higher than Cost Plus’s
$17.99 closing price May 8.  The deal would give Bed Bath & Beyond, which operates 1,173
locations in 50 states, 259 new stores while also adding another
e-commerce platform as it competes with retailers ranging from
 Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN)  to Target Corp. Demand at Cost Plus stores has
surged as consumers increase home-related spending amid the
housing market recovery, said Bradley Thomas, an analyst for
Keybanc Capital Markets Inc. in New York.  For more, click here.  To contact the reporter on this story:
