Emirates, the world’s largest airline
by international traffic, said full-year profit fell 61 percent
as fuel costs rose and growth in European economies slowed.  Net income in the 12 months ended March 31 dropped to 2.31
billion dirhams ($629 million) from 5.95 billion dirhams a year
earlier, the Dubai-based company said today in its annual
report. Revenue increased 18 percent to 67.4 billion dirhams.  Airline-industry profit will probably drop 62 percent to $3
billion in 2012, the International Air Transport Association
estimates. Emirates boosted annual passenger numbers 8 percent
and its planes flew with four-fifths of seats occupied even as
it builds the largest fleet of Airbus SAS A380 superjumbos in a
bid to establish Dubai as a long-haul hub and win customers from
rivals including  Air France-KLM (AF)  Group and  Deutsche Lufthansa AG. (LHA)   “Emirates is no more immune to rising fuel costs than any
other airline, but what’s impressive is that it has managed to
remain profitable and all the commercial indices remain high,
revenues and traffic rising and load factors robust,” said  John Strickland , an analyst at JLS Consulting Ltd. in  London .  Wing Cracks  Net income at the main airline unit fell 72 percent to 1.5
billion dirhams, with the fuel bill up 44 percent to a record
24.3 billion dirhams, Emirates said in a separate release. The
price of  Brent crude  rose 49 percent in the fiscal second half,
averaging $108 a barrel, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  “Our most significant challenge was the high price of  jet
fuel ,” Emirates Chairman Sheikh Ahmed Bin Saeed Al-Maktoum said
in the report. “Had prices remained the same as last year our
annual net profit would have again soared to a new record high.”  The economic environment was hampered by the on-going euro-
zone debt crisis and a slowly rebounding global economy, the
carrier said, and earnings were also clipped by the grounding of
A380s after the discovery of wing cracks. Six of the jets, which
generate $50,000 an hour, 15 hours a day for Emirates, have been
out of action for repairs as part of a rolling program, idling
830 cabin crew and 160 pilots not qualified on other models.  The carrier, which competes with fellow Gulf operators
Qatar Airways Ltd. and Abu Dhabi-based Etihad Airways, operates
21 superjumbos with 69 more on order and is also having to
compensate people who were set on an A380 trip.  Route Expansion  Emirates increased its annual passenger total to 34
million, it said today, with the load factor, a measure of seat
occupancy, little changed at 80 percent. The company added 11
routes and increased frequencies on 34 others while recruiting
10 percent more staff and introducing 22 new aircraft.  The airline now operates to 123 cities in 73 countries and
has this year commenced flights to Rio de Janeiro,  Buenos Aires ,
Dublin,  Dallas  and  Seattle , together with Lusaka in Zambia and
Harare in  Zimbabwe . Barcelona, Lisbon,  Washington  and  Ho Chi
Minh City  in  Vietnam  will follow in coming months.  The fleet features 172 Airbus and  Boeing Co. (BA)  jets, among
them the largest number of the U.S. manufacturer’s 777 wide-
bodies, with around 231 on order worth more than $84 billion.  Earnings at ground-handling unit Dnata rose 40 percent to a
record 808 million dirhams as sales rose 59 percent to 7 billion
dirhams. The world’s No. 4 air-services provider said Jan. 3 it
had acquired a majority stake in U.K. online travel agent Travel
Republic after taking a 50 percent holding in South African in-
flight caterer Wings Inflight Services a month earlier.  Cargo volumes grew by 1.6 percent to 1.8 million metric
tons, according to the statement, while the company’s cash
balance grew 9.5 percent to 17.6 billion dirhams.  To contact the reporter on this story:
