Ted Schlein, a managing partner at
Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, said the value created by
companies in cloud services, data virtualization and mobile
computing will be 10 times larger than that of the Internet.  “We have never seen anything like this in the history of
technology,” said Schlein, whose venture-capital firm has
invested in companies such as  Jive Software Inc. (JIVE)  and Twitter
Inc.  It’s rare to have three simultaneous transformations going
on in corporate computing, Schlein said at the Bloomberg
Enteprise Technology Summit hosted by  Bloomberg Link  in New York
today. Companies are trying to figure out where to store their
data inexpensively and securely while letting their employees
access it on smartphones and tablets like  Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s iPad.  Venture capitalists are backing entrepreneurs trying to
meet these challenges as they watch stocks jump in initial
public offerings by enterprise companies like  Splunk Inc. (SPLK) , which
analyzes web data, and Jive, which makes social tools for
business.  “You get enough of those high-profile, high-liquidity
events and people start to recognize,” Schlein said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
