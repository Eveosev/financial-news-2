Soybeans rose the most in more than
two weeks after the U.S. forecast a 31 percent plunge in
domestic inventories next year, as drought damage in  South
America  boosts demand for supplies from the Midwest.  Reserves will drop to 145 million bushels (3.94 million
metric tons) on Aug. 31, 2013, from an estimated 210 million
this year, the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  said today in a
report. The average estimate of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg
was 172 million bushels. U.S. exports will jump 14 percent to
make up for smaller crops in Brazil and Argentina this year and
rising global demand, the USDA said.  “U.S. carryover is already projected to be very small, and
that means South America will have to harvest big crops to
prevent a bigger global shortage from developing,”  Bill Gentry ,
a broker at  Risk Management Commodities Inc . in Lafayette,
 Indiana , said in a telephone interview. “We will need to see
increased export demand to keep this rally going.”  Soybean futures for July delivery advanced 1.7 percent to
close at $14.5525 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the Chicago Board of
Trade, the biggest gain since April 20. The oilseed has rallied
20 percent this year.  Reduced soybean supplies in the U.S., the world’s largest
grower and exporter last year, may raise feed costs for meat
producers including  Tyson Foods Inc. (TSN)  and  Smithfield Foods Inc. (SFD) 
Craig Huss, the chief risk officer at Decatur, Illinois-based
Archer Daniels Midland Co., the world’s largest grain processor,
said May 1 that reduced South American exports would make it
“difficult to buy beans going forward.”  South America  Combined production in Brazil and  Argentina  will fall to
107.5 million metric tons in the marketing year that ends Sept.
30, from 111 million forecast in April and 124.5 million a year
earlier, the USDA said. Output will rise to 133 million next
season, the agency said in its first forecast of the crops.  Estimated global production in the marketing year that
begins Oct. 1 will rise to 271.42 million metric tons, from a
revised 236.87 million tons this year, the USDA said in today’s
report.  World consumption is forecast at 265.14 million tons next
year, up from a record 254.14 million forecast this year.  Reserves before the 2013 Northern Hemisphere harvest will
rise to 58.07 million tons, up from 53.24 million this year, the
lowest in three years, the USDA said. Eighteen analysts surveyed
by Bloomberg News expected 58.24 million, on average.  Soybeans are the second-largest U.S. crop, valued at $35.8
billion in 2011, behind corn, government data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
