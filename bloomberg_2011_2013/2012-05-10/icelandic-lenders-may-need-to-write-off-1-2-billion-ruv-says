Icelandic banks may have to write off
a total of 145 billion kronur ($1.2 billion) following a Supreme
Court ruling banning lenders from adjusting  interest rates 
higher on foreign currency-linked loans,  RUV  reported.  The north Atlantic island’s banks have already written down
67 billion kronur, following the February ruling, and can absorb
the shock, the state broadcaster reported, citing Unnur Gunnarsdottir, head of Financial Supervisory Authority.  All of Iceland’s lenders will continue to have capital-
adequacy ratios exceeding the FSA’s 16 percent requirement,
Gunnarsdottir told RUV.  To contact the reporter on this story:
