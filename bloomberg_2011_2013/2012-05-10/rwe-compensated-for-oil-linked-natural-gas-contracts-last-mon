RWE AG (RWE)  last got compensatory payments
in April after renegotiating oil-linked natural-gas contracts,
the company said in its first-quarter earnings  statement .  “Our earnings would improve considerably if we obtained
further positive results from our price reviews, although we
will probably not see any significant benefit until after
2012,” RWE said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
