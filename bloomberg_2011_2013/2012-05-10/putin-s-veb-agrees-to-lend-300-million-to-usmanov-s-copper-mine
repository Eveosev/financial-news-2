VEB, the state development bank with
Russian President  Vladimir Putin  as chairman, agreed to lend as
much as $300 million to billionaire  Alisher Usmanov ’s Udokan
copper project in eastern Siberia for three years.  The bank’s board agreed to lend the money to Baikal Mining
Co., which holds the license to Udokan, the bank said today in
an e-mailed  statement . The funds will be used to finance the
preliminary stage of Udokan’s development, VEB said.  The resource, which contains 14.4 million metric tons of
copper metal, is among the world’s five largest deposits of the
commodity, according to the statement. A railway link and coal
power station need to be built to develop the project, VEB said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
