Spanish bonds advanced, snapping a
three-day drop, after the nation said it would take over  Bankia
SA (BKIA)  and prepared to inject public funds into the banking group,
bolstering investor confidence.  German bunds snapped a two-day advance after the European
Financial Stability Facility yesterday confirmed it would
release 5.2 billion euros ($6.74 billion) in funds to  Greece .
The euro strengthened amid renewed optimism as Greek socialist
Pasok leader  Evangelos Venizelos  prepares to try to form a
government.  “The late news yesterday that Spain is going to part-
nationalize Bankia is the major driver,” said Eric Wand, a
fixed-income strategist at Lloyds Banking Group Plc in  London .
“It’s a step in the right direction and I think the market
likes it. We’ve seen a decent selloff in the last couple of days
and people are seizing on that to reprice” Spanish bonds.  Spain ’s 10-year bond yields fell four basis points, or 0.04
percentage point, to 6.04 percent at 9:37 a.m. London time. The
5.85 percent security due January 2022 rose 0.255, or 2.55 euros
per 1,000-euro face amount, to 98.585.  The government will take a 45 percent controlling stake in
Bankia, the group with the most Spanish real estate, and aims to
help shore up Spain’s financial system.  Italy’s 10-year yield climbed one basis point to 5.61
percent.  German Records  The German 10-year yield was little changed at 1.52
percent, after sliding to a record 1.497 percent yesterday.  German two-, five-, 10- and 30-year yields dropped to all-
time lows yesterday as Greek leaders struggled to form a new
government, fueling speculation the Hellenic nation will
withdraw from the single-currency bloc. Venizelos will receive a
three-day mandate to try to build a coalition from President
Karolos Papoulias today.  The 2 percent Greek bond maturing in February 2023 fell for
an eighth day, with the yield gaining 30 basis points to 23.99
percent.  German debt returned 2.2 percent this year, according to
indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European Federation of
Financial Analysts Societies.  -- Editors: Mark McCord, Nicholas Reynolds  To contact the reporters on this story:
