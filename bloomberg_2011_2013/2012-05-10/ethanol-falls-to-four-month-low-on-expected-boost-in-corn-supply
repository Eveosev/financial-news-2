Ethanol tumbled to the lowest price
in almost four months after a government report forecast an
increase in corn supplies.  Futures fell after the Agriculture Department said that the
2012 crop may rise 20 percent to a record 14.79 million bushels
and that world inventories on Oct. 1, 2013, will total 152.34
metric tons, the largest stockpile since 2001. The grain is used
to produce ethanol in the U.S.  “That sent ethanol lower with the corn,” said Matt Janney, a trader at Citigroup Global Markets Inc. in  Chicago .  Denatured ethanol for June delivery dropped 5 cents, or 2.3
percent, to settle at $2.119 a gallon on the Chicago Board of
Trade, the lowest price since Jan. 18 and the steepest drop
since March 29.  In spot market trading, ethanol in  New York  decreased 5
cents, or 2.2 percent, to $2.18 a gallon and in Chicago the
additive lost 3.5 cents, or 1.6 percent, to $2.11, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol on the West Coast slid 3.5 cents, or 1.5 percent,
to $2.305 a gallon and in the U.S. Gulf the biofuel fell 2.5
cents, or 1.1 percent, to $2.175.  The Agriculture Department left its estimate on the amount
of corn to be used to make ethanol in 2013 unchanged from the
2012 estimate of 5 million bushels, signaling that demand for
the biofuel may be weak, Janney said.  “Projected corn use for ethanol is unchanged on the year
as weak gasoline consumption limits domestic blending
opportunities,” according to the  report .  Corn for July delivery plunged 19.75 cents, or 3.3 percent,
to $5.875 a bushel in Chicago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
