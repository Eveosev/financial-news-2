New York  Yankees reliever  Mariano Rivera ,  Major League Baseball ’s career saves leader, was given
blood thinners this week to dissolve a clot near the knee injury
that ended his season.  Rivera tore his right anterior cruciate ligament and
meniscus in his knee while catching fly balls during batting
practice May 3. Doctors discovered the blood clot in his calf
this week.  “Things happen for a good reason,” Rivera told reporters
yesterday. “I was more concerned with the blood clot than the
knee.”  Surgery to repair his knee hasn’t been scheduled, said
Rivera, who was walking on crutches at Yankee Stadium. He needs
two weeks to strengthen his knee, he said.  “I believe (the clot) is taken care of already,” Rivera
said. “Now I have to just strengthen it and be ready for
surgery. I have to have full range of motion, and that will be
better for the surgery.”  The 42-year-old Rivera, a 12-time All-Star who has 608
saves, said he plans to return next year for a 19th season with
the Yankees. His contract expires this year.  “I was leaning toward coming back; I was feeling strong on
that,” Rivera said. “The traveling, I hate it. The playing, I
love it. I was torn between that.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
