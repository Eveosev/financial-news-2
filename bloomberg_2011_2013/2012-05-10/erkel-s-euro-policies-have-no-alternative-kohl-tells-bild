Europe is “a matter of war and
peace” and Germany must work for its integration, former German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl told  Bild-Zeitung .  “I’m looking with great sympathy at the course  Angela Merkel  is plotting for Europe and her commitment to necessary
structural changes -- including necessary savings measures,”
the German newspaper quoted Kohl as saying. “There isn’t any
real alternative to that.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
