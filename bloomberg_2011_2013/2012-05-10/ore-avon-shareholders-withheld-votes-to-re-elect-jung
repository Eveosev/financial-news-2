The portion of shareholders who
withheld votes to re-elect  Avon Products Inc. (AVP)  Chairman  Andrea Jung  to the retailer’s board jumped more than fivefold to 14
percent of the shares outstanding this year, according to a
company filing.  About 60.7 million shareholders withheld votes for Jung,
compared with about 11 million, or 2.5 percent, last year,
according to regulatory filings. All of Avon’s directors up for
election were reinstated at the New York company’s annual
meeting last week.  Shareholders had until the company’s May 3 meeting to vote
on candidates and proposals, after Coty Inc. announced a $10
billion offer to buy the world’s largest door-to-door seller.  Avon shares dropped 3.3 percent to $20.89 today at the New
York close after Coty raised its offer to acquire the world’s
largest door-to-door seller to about $10.7 billion, or $24.75 a
share, from its previous bid of $23.25. The shares closed 16
percent below Coty’s latest offer, suggesting investors aren’t
convinced the bid will succeed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
