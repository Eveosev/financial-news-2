CEZ AS (CEZ)  rose from its lowest in more
than five months after the biggest power utility in the  Czech
Republic  confirmed an earlier full-year profit forecast,
overshadowing worse-than-expected quarterly profit.  The stock climbed 0.6 percent to 714.5 koruna by 12:06 p.m.
in Prague, after tumbling 6.6 percent in the previous five days
to its weakest price since November 2011. CEZ has lost 9.2
percent so far this year.  The company reiterated its 2012 target for net income of 41
billion koruna ($2.1 billion) and its plan to pay a dividend of
45 koruna per share. First-quarter net income of 14.4 billion
koruna missed estimates and revenue rose 7 percent to 60.8
billion koruna, CEZ said today.  “While first-quarter results are overall slightly
negative, CEZ has confirmed its full-year targets, which is
often more important for investors than the quarterly data,”
 Josef Nemy , an analyst at  Komercni Banka AS (KOMB)  in Prague, wrote in
a report today. “CEZ shares are undervalued in our view, but
they keep being hurt by unfavorable trends in energy markets.”  Power for next-year delivery in Germany, where CEZ exports
part of its output, has tumbled 6.4 percent so far this year.
The futures contract rose 0.1 percent to 49.70 euros today, its
second day of gains.  To contact the reporter on this story:
