French industrial output declined in
March as warmer weather led to a drop in demand for electricity
and gas for heating.  Output from factories, mines and power plants fell 0.9
percent from February, when it rose 0.3 percent, national
statistics office Insee said in an e-mailed statement today.
Economists forecast a drop of 0.6 percent, according to the
median of 19 estimates in a Bloomberg News survey.  Manufacturing production  climbed 1.4 percent, the first
increase this year, amid concern about  France ’s ability to
revive growth in the face of a deepening euro-area recession.
Socialist  Francois Hollande , who will be sworn-in as president
next week, said that boosting French output will be one of his
priorities for the next five years.  “On the manufacturing front, a very modest increase can be
seen following a weak beginning in the first quarter,” said
Pierre-Olivier Beffy, chief economist at Exane BNP Paribas in
 London . “The overall manufacturing trend remains weak.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
