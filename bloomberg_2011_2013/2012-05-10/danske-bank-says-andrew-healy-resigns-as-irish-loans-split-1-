Danske Bank A/S (DANSKE)  said its National
Irish Bank unit chief executive officer, Andrew Healy, resigned
as part of a restructuring that will move its commercial real
estate loans into a separate unit.  “We want to focus on our core business in Ireland,”
Eivind Kolding, chairman of Danske Bank’s executive board, said
today in a statement. “Danske Bank has considered alternative
options and decided that this solution is the best in terms of
creating value. With these initiatives, we also confirm our
commitment to Ireland.”  Healy’s departure means that nine of the heads of the
largest 10 banks in Ireland have quit since loan losses started
to soar in 2008 after the collapse of the domestic real estate
market. National Irish’s loan-loss impairments rose to 195.2
million euros ($253 million) in the first quarter from 172
million euros a year earlier, it said in today’s statement.
Belgian-owned KBC Bank Ireland also reported today 195 million
euros of first-quarter loan-loss provisions.  Danske said it is rebranding National Irish and its
Northern Bank in  Northern Ireland  under the parent name this
year. Healy had been CEO of National Irish since 2005, the year
that Copenhagen-based Danske took over the two banks.  Ireland’s largest 10 consumer lenders, including four
overseas-owned banks, lost about 117.8 billion euros on soured
loans in the four years through December, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg News. In addition to KBC and Danske’s
first-quarter Irish losses, Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc’s
Ulster Bank unit reported 394 million pounds ($636 million) of
impairment losses and Lloyds Bank Group Plc’s Irish portfolio
had 526 million pounds of losses in the first three months.  National Irish’s pretax loss widened to 184.3 million euros
in the first quarter from 161.4 million euros a year earlier, it
said in a separate statement today. Customer deposits fell to
4.24 billion euros from 5.59 billion euros, it said. Total loans
fell to 8.45 billion euros from 9.29 billion euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
