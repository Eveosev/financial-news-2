Yelp Inc. (YELP) , the website that allows
people to comment on businesses and services, will make its
global headquarters in a historic San Francisco office tower.  Yelp agreed to lease almost 100,000 square feet (9,300
square meters) at 140 New Montgomery St., an art deco high-rise
near the San Francisco Museum of  Modern Art  in the South of
Market area, San Francisco-based co-owners  Stockbridge Capital
Group LLC  and  Wilson Meany  said today in a statement. The
Internet company plans to relocate in the fall of 2013, a “few
doors away” from where it began in 2004, said  Jeremy Stoppelman , Yelp’s co-founder and chief executive officer.  “Yelp represents exactly the type of tenant we have
envisioned for this location, an industry leader driving
innovation and commerce by combining technology and community,”
Terry Fancher, executive managing director of Stockbridge, said
in the statement.  The 26-story tower has 295,000 square feet and was the
longtime home of Pacific Telephone & Telegraph Co., the
companies said. Completed in 1925, the property is undergoing a
renovation that includes a seismic upgrade, sculpture garden,
secure bicycle parking, showers and locker rooms. A 411-slot
parking garage is located next door.  -- Editors: Christine Maurus, Andrew Blackman  To contact the reporter on this story:
