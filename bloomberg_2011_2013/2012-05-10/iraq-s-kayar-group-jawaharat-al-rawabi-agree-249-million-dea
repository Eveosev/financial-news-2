Iraq ’s Kayar Group and Jawaharat
Alrawabi companies signed a $249 million contract to build 3,827
housing units in the southern region of Diwaniya, said,  Ahmed
Hisham, president of the Diwaniya Investment Commission.  “We are also styuding designs for other companies to build
15,000 residential units,” Hisham said in a telephone interview
today. “Some of these companies are from the UAE, Italy, Brazil
and Iraq.”  The project will be built within three years to the south
of Diwaniya city and the province will need 100,000 residential
units by 2015, he said.  Iraq, which holds the world’s fifth-largest oil reserves,
is seeking foreign investment to help rebuild an economy and
infrastructure damaged by years of conflict, sanctions and
underinvestment. In March 2010, the government approved plans to
build 1 million apartments by 2014 for lower- and middle-income
families to help a housing shortage.  To contact the reporter on this story:
