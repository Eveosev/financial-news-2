The Spanish government is on “good
track” to address the banking system’s problems,  UniCredit SpA (UCG) 
Chief Executive Officer Federico Ghizzoni said in an interview
with Bloomberg Television today.  “The Spanish government is taking a very pragmatic stance
to the problem of Spanish banks,” the CEO said. “I don’t think
the government has understimated the situation.”  Italy’s banks are “quite strong and sound from a capital
point of view,” Ghizzoni said.  The Italian and Spanish banking industries aren’t
comparable, he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
