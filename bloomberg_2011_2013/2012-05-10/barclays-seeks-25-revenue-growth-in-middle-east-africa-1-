(Corrects year of hiring in first paragraph in the story
originally published May 10.)  May 10 (Bloomberg) -- Barclays Plc, Britain’s second-
biggest bank, is seeking to boost revenue from the  Middle East 
and North  Africa  by as much as 25 percent annually over the next
five years and will hire about 100 people in the region in 2012.  Revenue “aspirations are in the range” of a 20 percent to
25 percent compound annual increase, helped by the wealth,
investment management and trade finance businesses, John Vitalo,
chief executive officer for the Middle East and North Africa,
said in an interview in Dubai today. The bank will add about 100
people to its existing staff of a 1,000 in the region, he said.  The Middle East and Africa generated about 5 billion pounds
($8 billion) of revenue for Barclays last year, about 15 percent
of the total, the London-based bank’s annual report shows.  Banks such as Barclays, HSBC Holdings Plc, Citigroup Inc.
and  Standard Chartered Plc (STAN)  are stepping up lending in the Middle
East again as rising oil revenue revives the region’s economy
after the credit crisis of 2008. The number of millionaires in
the Middle East rose 10 percent to 400,000 in 2010 and their
wealth by 13 percent to $1.7 trillion, according to the
 Capgemini and Merrill Lynch 2011 World Wealth Report .  Barclays is growing its balance sheet “modestly” and is
posting “respectable growth” in revenue and pretax profit in
the Middle East and North Africa, said Vitalo, 47. He took up
his present post in 2009.  Investment Banking  The lender’s  investment-banking  unit, which includes debt
 capital markets  and mergers and acquisitions advisory, has a
“pretty good pipeline,” he said, without giving details.  Barclays helped to arrange a $750 million bond sale for the
 National Bank of Abu Dhabi PJSC (NBAD)  in March and a $1 billion
offering for  Qatar National Bank SAQ (QNBK)  in February.  Companies in the Middle East have been raising about 80
percent of their borrowings through bank loans and 20 percent
from bond sales, unlike the U.S., where companies rely on the
capital markets for about 80 percent of their debt, Vitalo said.
Bond sales from the Middle East will increase in coming years as
continental European lenders reduce lending to the Middle East,
he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
