Fed funds, the U.S. overnight inter-
bank lending  rate , is projected to open at 0.13 percent to 0.17
percent, within the Federal Reserve’s target of zero to 0.25
percent.  Fed funds closed at 0.07 percent yesterday after trading
from 0.07 percent to 0.28 percent and averaging 0.15 percent,
according to ICAP Plc, the world’s largest inter-dealer broker.
ICAP’s monthly average is 0.158 percent.  The central bank will sell $8 billion $8.75 billion of
Treasuries maturing from October 2013 to January 2014. The sales
are part of the Fed’s program to replace $400 billion of short-
term debt in its portfolio with longer-term Treasuries in an
effort to reduce borrowing costs further and counter rising
risks of a recession.  To contact the reporter on this story:
