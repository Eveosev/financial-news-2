Slovak Telekom AS, a unit of  Deutsche
Telekom AG (DTE)  and Slovakiaâ€™s biggest telecommunications company,
said first-quarter profit fell 7.8 percent as regulation
increased.  Net income declined to 25 million euros ($32.3 million)
from 27.1 million euros a year earlier. Revenue dropped 3.5
percent to 206.2 million euros because of price regulation and a
saturated market, the Bratislava, Slovakia-based company said in
an e-mailed statement today.  Deutsche Telekom owns 51 percent the company with the rest
held by the government.  To contact the reporter on this story:
