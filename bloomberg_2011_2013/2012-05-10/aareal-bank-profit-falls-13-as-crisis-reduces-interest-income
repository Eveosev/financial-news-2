Aareal Bank AG (ARL) , a German commercial-
property lender, said first-quarter profit declined 13 percent
as the sovereign debt crisis curbed its lending business.  Net income fell to 26 million euros ($33.7 million) from 30
million euros a year earlier, the Wiesbaden-based lender said in
a statement today. Net interest income declined 4 percent to 129
million euros, while net commission income in the quarter rose
33 percent to 40 million euros.  Aareal, which provides property financing in more than 25
countries in Europe, Asia and  North America , said on Feb. 21
that profit will probably decline this year, while predicting
“good potential for achieving consolidated operating profit
that is only slightly below” the 185 million euros in 2011. The
lender is following “a cautious liquidity and investment
strategy” amid  Europe ’s sovereign debt crisis, it said today.  “We affirm our target for new business of 4.5 billion
euros to 5.5 billion euros for the full year 2012, and will
exploit opportunities in new lending business more vigorously
during the remainder of the year,” Chief Executive Officer Wolf Schumacher said in the statement.  Aareal rose as much as 3 percent and was up 2.3 percent to
13.20 euros as of 9:18 a.m. Frankfurt. The stock has fallen 5
percent this year, valuing the company at 793 million euros.  Aareal Bank tapped the  European Central Bank ’s three-year
loans for about 1 billion euros in February to assure additional
refinancing and to boost flexibility, spokesman Peter Alexewicz
said in February.  To contact the reporter on this story:
