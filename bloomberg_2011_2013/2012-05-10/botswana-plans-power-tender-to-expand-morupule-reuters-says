Botswana plans to issue power tenders
this year for two coal-fired plants of 300 megawatts each,
Reuters reported, citing Nchidzi Mmolawa, acting deputy
permanent secretary for minerals.  The one tender will be for the expansion of state-owned
Botswana Power Corp.â€™s existing Morupule complex, to become
operational by 2015-16, Reuters reported. The second plant can
be built anywhere in the country and should be operational by
2018-19, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
