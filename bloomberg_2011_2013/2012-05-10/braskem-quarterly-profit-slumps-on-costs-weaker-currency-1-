Braskem SA (BRKM5) ,  Latin America â€™s largest
petrochemicals maker, said first-quarter  profit  fell 50 percent
after costs soared and a weaker local currency boosted the value
of its dollar-denominated debt.  Net income dropped to 152 million reais ($77.3 million), or
19 centavos a share, from 305 million reais, or 38 centavos a
year earlier, Sao Paulo-based Braskem said in a regulatory
filing today.  The cost of goods sold jumped 19 percent in the quarter to
7.6 billion reais. Increased costs compressed margins, Braskem
said. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization, or Ebitda, fell to 9.6 percent of net sales, from
12.4 percent a year earlier.  Braskem had a first-quarter financial loss of 104 million
reais, almost double the 57 million reais loss a year earlier as
the Brazilian real declined 11 percent in the 12 months through
the end of the quarter.  The real was the worst performing currency among seven
Latin American currencies tracked by Bloomberg in the period.
Under Brazilian accounting rules, an increase in foreign debt
stemming from a currency slump is booked as a loss.  Net sales climbed 11 percent to 8.23 billion reais, Braskem
said.  Braskem rose 0.7 percent to 13.24 reais at 10:27 a.m. in
 Sao Paulo .  To contact the reporter on this story:
