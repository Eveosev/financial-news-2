Billionaire Vincent  Bollore (BOL)  said he’s
confident in  Vivendi SA (VIV) ’s management and described himself as a
“nice” and “diligent” investor in the music, video-games and
telecommunications company.  The French businessman owns  1.09 percent  of Vivendi and is
due to receive another 22.4 million shares on completing a deal
to sell 60 percent of his television assets to Vivendi’s pay-
television unit Canal Plus.  “I have great confidence in Jean-Rene Fourtou and Jean- Bernard Levy,” Vivendi’s chairman and chief executive officer,
Bollore said. “I think they will fix their problems.” Bollore,
chairman of advertising business  Havas SA (HAV) , was speaking today at
that company’s annual shareholder meeting in Puteaux, France.  Faced with calls last month at Vivendi’s shareholder
meeting to change managers and invite new members to the board,
Fourtou said that there was “no reason” why Bollore shouldn’t
join the company’s supervisory board if he wished.  Vivendi is considering an overhaul of its group structure
that may lead to a breakup, people with knowledge of the matter
said last month. As its French telephone unit SFR faces
increased competition from discounter  Iliad SA (ILD) , Paris-based
Vivendi has forecast an earnings slump through 2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
