Bombardier Inc. (BBD/B)  needs to win more
regional jet and turboprop orders this year to avoid curbing
production in 2013, the aerospace unit chief said.  Bombardier, the world’s third-largest maker of commercial
aircraft, said today it secured 28 orders for the planes in the
first three months of the year. On May 1, Canadian discount
carrier WestJet Airlines Ltd. awarded the Montreal-based company
a contract for as many as 45 turboprops that could be worth
about $1.35 billion, based on list prices.  “Right now, we are set for this year,” he told reporters
in Montreal after the company’s annual shareholder meeting. “We
are pretty satisfied with the level we have this year in terms
of production rates. We need to win more orders for next year to
achieve what we had planned.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
