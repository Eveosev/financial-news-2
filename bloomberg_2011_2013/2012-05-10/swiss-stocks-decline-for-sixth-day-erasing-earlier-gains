Switzerland stocks  declined to a
four-month low amid political turmoil in Greece where former
Finance Minister  Evangelos Venizelos  emerged as the prime-
ministerial candidate.  Givaudan SA (GIVN) , the world’s biggest maker of flavors and
fragrances, followed a gauge of European chemical shares lower.
 Lonza Group AG (LONN) , the world’s biggest maker of drug ingredients,
slipped 2.6 percent.  UBS AG (UBSN)  and  Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) ,
Switzerland’s largest lenders, climbed more than 2.5 percent.  The  Swiss Market Index (SMI)  fell 0.2 percent to 5,926.60 at the
close in Zurich, its sixth day of losses. The gauge has dropped
to the lowest since Dec. 29 as uncertainty after elections in
Greece raised questions about that nation’s ability to obtain
financial rescue and pay back its debt on time. The Swiss
Performance Index lost 0.1 percent.  “ Greece  and its problems forming a government and Spanish
banks are the two main problems,” said Markus Wallner, an
equity strategist at Commerzbank AG in Frankfurt. “Investors
are very nervous about a possible Greek exit from the euro zone
and that Spain will be forced to ask for external financial
aid.”  Venizelos, the socialist Pasok leader in Greece, received a
three-day mandate from President Karolos Papoulias today to try
to form a coalition government.  Antonis Samaras, the leader of
the nation’s biggest political party, and Alexis Tsipras of the
left-wing Syriza coalition have already failed in their
attempts.  Bailout Funds  The European Financial Stability Facility’s board of
directors late yesterday confirmed the release of 5.2 billion
euros ($6.7 billion) by the end of June to help Greece meet its
debt-repayment obligations.  In Spain, the government is negotiating with European Union
officials over funding from the EFSF or the European Investment
Bank to bolster its lenders, El Economista reported.  Givaudan dropped 1.1 percent to 870.50 francs as a gauge of
European chemical companies was the worst performer of the 19
industry groups in the  Stoxx Europe 600 Index. (SXXP)  Clariant AG slid
2.5 percent to 10.95 francs. Syngenta AG, the world’s biggest
supplier of agricultural chemicals, declined 1.3 percent to 308
francs.  Lonza slipped 2.6 percent to 38.87 francs, its lowest price
since at least November 1999, after Jacob Thrane, an analyst at
Standard & Poor’s, cut his recommendation on the company’s
shares to hold from buy.  Gategroup Holding AG, the airline catering company,
retreated 1.8 percent to 27.95 francs after it reported a loss
of 14.8 million francs in the first quarter, after a 6.2
million-franc loss a year earlier.  UBS and Credit Suisse increased 3.4 percent to 11.43 francs
and 2.9 percent to 19.88 francs, respectively.  Julius Baer Group
Ltd. (BAER)  rose 1.8 percent to 33.56 francs. Swiss Life Holding AG,
the country’s biggest insurer, added 2.8 percent to 88.20
francs.  Adecco SA (ADEN) , the world’s largest supplier of temporary
workers, jumped 3.3 percent to 40.12 francs after ABN Amro Bank
NV raised the stock to buy from hold.  To contact the reporter on this story:
