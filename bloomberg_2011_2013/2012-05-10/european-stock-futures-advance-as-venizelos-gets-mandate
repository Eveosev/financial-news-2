European stock futures rose,
indicating the region’s equities will rebound from two days of
losses, as  Greece ’s president turned to former finance minister
Evangelos Venizelos to try to form a coalition government. U.S.
index futures climbed, while Asian shares were little changed.  Bankia SA (BKIA)  may be active after Spain said it would take over
the lender. Deutsche Telekom might move as the company was said
to discuss a merger of its T-Mobile USA Inc. unit with MetroPCS
Communications Inc. Zurich Insurance Group AG may move after it
reported first-quarter net income that beat analysts’ estimates.  Futures on the Euro Stoxx 50 Index expiring in June rose
0.7 percent to 2,205 at 7:12 a.m. in  London . Contracts on the
FTSE 100 Index expiring the same month added 0.2 percent.
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index futures gained 0.3 percent today,
while the MSCI Asia Pacific Index slipped less than 0.1 percent.  “Today socialist Pasok leader  Evangelos Venizelos  will
attempt to form a coalition government and if unsuccessful new
elections in June could be given the green light,” Nam Truong,
a trader at Capital Spreads in London, wrote in a note.
“However, another election without an outright majority will be
disastrous and send shockwaves across the euro zone.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
