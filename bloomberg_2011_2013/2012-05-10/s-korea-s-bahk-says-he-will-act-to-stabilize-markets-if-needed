South Korea  will take action to
stabilize financial markets if needed as uncertainty has risen
over Europe due to recent elections in France and Greece, the
nation’s Finance Minister Bahk Jae Wan said.  Asian countries need to create more demand in the region,
rather than relying heavily on export-driven growth, Bahk also
said in a speech prepared for a forum in Seoul. He urged the
creation of a strong financial safety net for Asia against
possible capital flow changes due to the euro-zone crisis.  South Korea will continue policy coordination with major
countries such as the U.S., China and Japan if needed for market
stability, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
