Russian stocks rose for the first
time in seven days on speculation  China  will ease monetary
policy, boosting demand for commodity producers’ shares.  The 30-stock  Micex Index (INDEXCF)  rose 1.8 percent to 1,408.99 by
10:44 a.m. in Moscow, paring a 6.1 percent drop in the past six
days. OAO Magnitogorsk Iron & Steel, billionaire Victor Rashnikov’s steelmaker, rallied 3.8 percent 11.259 and OAO
Raspadskaya, a Russian coal producer, gained 2.6 percent 85.59.
United Co. Rusal, the world’s biggest aluminum producer, lost
2.1 percent 195.37. The dollar-denominated  RTS Index (RTSI$)  rose 0.3
percent to 1,489.39.  China’s exports rose less than estimated in April, making
the government more likely to ease policy, Bloomberg economist
Michael McDonough said. Copper, alumminum and nickel rose on the
London Metal Exchange, while crude pared a drop of as much as
0.5 percent to trade little changed at $96.70 a barrel in  New
York .  “Today’s data gives the market hope that the Chinese
government will introduce monetary easing,” Renat Malin,
portfolio manager at Kapital Asset Management LLC who manages $3
billion in assets, said by phone from Moscow. “China is very
important for  Russia ’s economy and for commodity demand.”  Russia, the world’s biggest energy exporter and the largest
producer of nickel and palladium, received almost 50 percent of
budget revenue from oil and gas sales last year, according to
government estimates.  The Micex was closed yesterday for the Victory Day holiday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
