Paul Singer , the founder of hedge
fund Elliott Management Corp., said he’s betting the price of
30-year sovereign debt in the U.S.,  Europe  and Japan will fall.  These bonds, many with yields of about 2 percent to 3
percent, are trading at “extreme” levels because central banks
have purchased a large amount of government debt, a practice
known as quantitative easing, he said.  Central banks “have given every inclination to keep
printing willy-nilly to solve every economic problem,” said
Singer, speaking yesterday at the Skybridge Alternatives
Conference in Las Vegas. At some point, inflation is likely to
kick in, sending bond prices tumbling, he said.  Singer, who has run New York-based Elliott for 35 years,
said it’s the same kind of trade he put on in the mid-2000s,
when he bet that U.S. bank debt and subprime mortgages would
fall.  “We weren’t bearish on these,” Singer said. “What we
were doing was buying an incredibly cheap  put option . It was
insanely asymmetric,” meaning the cost was small if he was
wrong, and the return could be huge if he was right.  To contact the reporters on this story:
