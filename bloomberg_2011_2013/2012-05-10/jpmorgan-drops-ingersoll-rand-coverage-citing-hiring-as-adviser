JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  dropped equity
research coverage of Ingersoll-Rand Plc, saying the bank is now
acting as an adviser to the maker of Trane air conditioners.  JPMorgan’s advisory role was announced on May 9, according
to a note today from analyst Stephen Tusa, who had an overweight
recommendation on shares of Swords, Ireland-based Ingersoll-
Rand.  Misty Zelent, a spokeswoman for Ingersoll-Rand, said in a
telephone interview that the company didn’t announce JPMorgan as
an adviser and has retained the bank’s services periodically
over several years.  Earlier this week, Trian Fund Management LP, the investment
fund of Nelson Peltz, announced it took a 7.3 percent stake in
Ingersoll-Rand and would seek talks with management.  To contact the reporter on this story:
