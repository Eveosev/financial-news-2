Turkish authorities arrested 15
military officers in connection with an investigation of the so-
called postmodern coup of 1997, when the army pushed an
Islamist-led coalition government out of power.  The jailing of active and retired officers, including 11
generals, followed a fourth round of raids May 8, when the
special prosecutor’s office in Ankara placed 17 members of the
armed forces under surveillance, according to the state-run
Anatolia news agency.  At least 43 serving and retired members of the military
have been arrested and many more placed under watch in the
investigation of a four-month period that began with a meeting
of the National Security Council on Feb. 28, 1997, and ended
with the resignation of the coalition government.  Prime Minister  Recep Tayyip Erdogan , who was Istanbul’s
mayor at the time and counted among the Islamist politicians
targeted by the military as a potential threat to  Turkey ’s
secular constitution, criticized the probe after the fourth wave
of detentions, saying it is “unsettling” the public.  To contact the reporter on this story:
