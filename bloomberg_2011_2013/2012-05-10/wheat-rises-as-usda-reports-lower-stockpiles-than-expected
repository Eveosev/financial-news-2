Wheat rose after the  U.S. Department
of Agriculture  said domestic inventories at the end of next
season will be lower than analysts forecast as exports are
expected to increase.  Stockpiles in the U.S., the world’s biggest shipper, may
fall 4.3 percent to 735 million bushels on May 31, 2013, the
USDA said today. Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News estimated
inventories at 827 million bushels. Exports may rise 12 percent
to 1.15 billion bushels, the agency said.  “The U.S. stockpiles number is going to be looked at as a
little bit friendly,”  Jason Britt , the president at Central
States Commodities Inc. in  Kansas City , Missouri, said by
telephone. “This will go a long ways in tempering some of that
downside pressure.”  Wheat futures for July delivery rose 0.2 percent to settle
at $6.0125 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the  Chicago  Board of Trade.
The price is down 7.9 percent this year as warm weather and
timely rain improved crop prospects.  Global inventories may fall 4.5 percent to 188.1 million
metric tons in the year that ends on May 31, 2013, the USDA
said. World production may fall 2.5 percent to 677.6 million
tons.  Wheat is the fourth-largest U.S. crop, valued at $14.4
billion in 2011, behind corn, soybeans and hay, government data
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
