Intel Corp. (INTC)  Chief Executive Officer
Paul Otellini said demand from large corporations is in line
with the company’s forecasts, including in Europe, countering 
comments yesterday from  Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO)   “We haven’t seen any change in enterprise in Europe,”
Otellini said today at a meeting for investors in Santa Clara,
California. “The year is playing out just as we expected.
Enterprise is good. It’s not fantastic.”  Cisco yesterday forecast quarterly sales and profit that
missed analysts’ estimates. Cisco CEO John Chambers said big
companies were hesitant to spend, and the company was concerned
about demand in Europe.  Otellini said Chambers’s comments may reflect competitive
issues rather than the weakness in Europe that Cisco cited.  “I don’t see what he’s seeing,” Otellini said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
