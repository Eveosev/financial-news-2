The Olympic flame that will burn in
the stadium during the  London 2012 games  has been lit among the
historic ruins at the home of the ancient games in Greece.  In traditional ceremonial rites, the flame was lit by using
the sun’s rays at the Temple of Hera in ancient Olympia, the
London organizing committee (Locog) said in an e-mailed
statement.  “This is the second time representatives of the U.K. have
gathered here to celebrate the lighting of the Olympic flame,”
said Locog Chairman Sebastian Coe. He was present at the
ceremony alongside International Olympic Committee President
Jacques Rogge and Spyros Capralos, president of the Hellenic
Olympic Committee.  “In 1948, shortly after the Second World War, my
predecessor stood where I am today and made the first tentative
steps in turning the world from war to sport,” Coe said. “We
find ourselves in challenging times again and turn to sport once
more to connect the world in a global celebration of achievement
and inspiration.”  The flame will first travel through  Greece  before being
flown to the U.K., where it will arrive at the Royal Naval Air
Station Culdrose in Cornwall on May 18. London last hosted the
games in 1948.  A torch relay will start on May 19 at Land’s End, Cornwall,
taking the Olympic flame on a 70-day, 8,000-mile journey
crisscrossing the U.K. so that it will be within 10 miles of 95
percent of the population, organizers say. It will be carried by
8,000 torchbearers before it reaches the Olympic Stadium on the
evening of July 27 for the opening ceremony.  To contact the reporter on this story:
