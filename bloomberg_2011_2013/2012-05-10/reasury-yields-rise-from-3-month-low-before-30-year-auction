Treasury 30-year bonds fell for the
first time in five days as investors balked at buying the debt
with yields at three-month lows before a government auction of 
$16 billion of the securities.  Yields on the longest-maturity U.S. government security
remain below the 3.41 percent average of the past year as
investors continue to seek a refuge from turmoil in European
sovereign-debt and credit markets. The Treasury sold $24 billion
of 10-year notes yesterday at a record low auction yield.  “Treasuries have come off the highs ahead of today’s bond
auction,” said  Richard Bryant , a trader in  New York  at Mizuho
Securities USA Inc., one of 21 primary dealers that are required
to bid at government-debt auctions. “The question is, will
there be enough concession to distribute the bond at these
levels?”  The 30-year  yield  rose six basis points, or 0.06 percentage
point, to 3.09 percent at 11:52 a.m. New York time, according to
Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The 3.125 percent bond due in
February 2042 fell 1 3/32, or $10.94 per $1,000 face amount, to
100 27/32.  The yield dropped to 2.98 percent yesterday, a level last
seen on Feb. 2.  Ten-year note yields climbed four basis points to 1.90
percent after rising as many as nine basis points, the biggest
gain since April 3. Yields dropped to 1.79 percent yesterday,
the lowest level since Jan 31.  Swap Rates  “Yields are already low and we have a third auction,”
said  David Ader , head of U.S. government-bond strategy at CRT
Capital Group LLC in  Stamford  Connecticut. “We haven’t really
garnered any more dramatic information about  Europe .”  The difference between the 10-year  swap rate  and the yield
on similar-maturity  U.S. debt  narrowed for the first time in
three days to 12.44 basis points. It widened yesterday to as
much as 18 basis points, the most since December. Swap rates are
usually higher than Treasury yields in part because the floating
payments are based on  interest rates  that contain credit risk.
Swap rates serve as benchmarks for investors in many types of
debt, including mortgage-backed and auto-loan securities.  The 30-year bonds being sold today yielded 3.10 percent in
pre-auction trading, compared with 3.23 percent the previous
time the government sold the securities on April 12.  ‘Dive Into Duration’  Investors  bid  for 2.76 times the amount of debt offered
last month, versus the average of 2.67 percent for the past 10
auctions. Indirect  bidders , the investor group that includes
foreign central banks, purchased 30.7 percent.  “People are going to dive into duration a bit right now,”
said  Michael Franzese , managing director and head of Treasury
trading at Wunderlich Securities Inc. in New York. “It’s out of
necessity. Situations out there are very tenuous.”  Demand for a refuge from Europe’s turmoil helped the U.S.
sell the 10-year notes at 1.855 percent yesterday, a record low
for an auction. Ten-year  yields  dropped to 1.67 percent on Sept.
23, the least ever.  The U.S. sold $32 billion of three-year notes May 8 at a
yield of 0.365 percent. This week’s sales will raise $35.3
billion of new cash as maturing securities held by the public
total $36.7 billion, according to the  U.S. Treasury .  Treasuries have returned 0.6 percent this year, including
reinvested interest, Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes show.
They returned 9.8 percent in 2011 as the European financial
crisis deepened.  Top Forecaster  “European investors are looking for alternative safe
havens where they can earn a little bit more and it’s coming
into the Treasury market,” FTN Financial Chief Economist
Christopher Low, the most accurate forecaster of Treasury note
yields last year, said yesterday. “The combination of low
growth and low inflation is beneficial for bonds everywhere,
including U.S. Treasuries.”  Low was the only one among 70 analysts in a Bloomberg
survey who predicted the yield would fall to 2 percent by the
end of last year.  “It’s likely that the U.S. 10-year Treasury yield will
work itself down to 1.5 percent by year-end,” said Low, who is
based in New York.  As  Greece  faces political paralysis, a survey of 1,253
Bloomberg subscribers showed 57 percent of investors, analysts
and traders predicted at least one country will abandon the euro
by year-end. Political leaders remained divided on forming a new
government, stoking concern another election may set the stage
for the country’s exit from the currency union.  Jobs Data  The 10-year yield will meet resistance should it fall to
the Jan. 31 low of 1.7901 percent, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Resistance refers to the level where orders to sell a
security may be grouped.  Jobless claims dropped by 1,000 to 367,000 in the period
ended May 5, in line with the median forecast in a Bloomberg
News survey and the lowest since the end of March, the Labor
Department said today in  Washington . The number of people on
unemployment benefit rolls was the smallest since July 2008.  The government announced today it would auction $13 billion
of 10-year Treasury Inflation Protected Securities on May 17.  The  Federal Reserve  sold $8.636 billion in notes due from
October 2013 to January 2014 today as part of a program known as
Operation Twist. The sales are part of the central bank’s effort
to replace $400 billion of shorter-term debt in its holdings
with longer maturities by the end of June to hold down borrowing
costs.  To contact the reporters on this story:
