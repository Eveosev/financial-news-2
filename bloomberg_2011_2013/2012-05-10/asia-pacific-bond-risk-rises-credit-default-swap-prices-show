The cost of insuring Asia-Pacific
corporate and sovereign bonds from default increased, according
to traders of credit-default swaps.  The  Markit iTraxx Asia  index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  gained 3 basis points to 183 basis
points as of 8:29 a.m. in  Hong Kong ,  Credit Agricole SA (ACA)  prices
show. The gauge is set for a fifth daily increase, the longest
stretch of gains since November, and its highest close since
Jan. 30, according to data provider CMA.  The  Markit iTraxx Australia  index rose 4 basis points to
176 as of 10:29 a.m. in Sydney, Credit Agricole prices show. The
index is poised to close at the highest level since Jan. 16,
according to CMA, which is owned by CME Group Inc. and compiles
prices quoted by dealers in the privately negotiated market.  The  Markit iTraxx Japan  index was unchanged at 206 basis
points as of 9:22 a.m. in  Tokyo , according to Deutsche Bank AG
prices. That was the highest since Nov. 25, CMA prices show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
