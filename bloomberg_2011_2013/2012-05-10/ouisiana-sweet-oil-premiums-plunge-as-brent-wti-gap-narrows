Light and Heavy Louisiana sweet oil
premiums weakened as the gap between West Texas Intermediate and
Brent narrowed.  Brent crude’s premium to WTI, based on June futures prices,
narrowed 84 cents to $15.55 a barrel at 2:35 p.m. in  New York .
When Brent falls versus WTI, it typically weakens the value of
low-sulfur U.S. grades that compete with West African oil priced
against the European benchmark.  Light Louisiana Sweet’s premium lost $2.25 to $14 a barrel
at 12:11 p.m. in New York, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Heavy Louisiana Sweet’s premium decreased $2.40 to
$15.  Mars Blend’s premium narrowed 55 cents to $11.25 a barrel.
Poseidon’s fell 40 cents to $10.25, while Southern Green
Canyon’s decreased 35 cents to $10.  Thunder Horse , a sour crude with lower sulfur content than
Mars, Poseidon and Southern Green Canyon, decreased $1 against
WTI to a premium of $14.50.  Western Canada Select’s discount to WTI widened 25 cents to
$19 a barrel. Syncrude’s premium added 10 cents to $1.95.  Bakken oil’s discount to the U.S. benchmark narrowed 75
cents to $1 a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
