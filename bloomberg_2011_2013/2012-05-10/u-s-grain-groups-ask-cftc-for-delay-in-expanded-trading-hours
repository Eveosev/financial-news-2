The two largest U.S. grain-trading
associations asked the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to
delay the start of expanded trading hours for grain contracts at
the CME Group Inc. and the  IntercontinentalExchange Inc. (ICE)   The National Grain and Feed Association and the North
American Export Grain Association said in a joint statement that
the two exchanges provided “inadequate advance consideration”
of their plan to expand trading to 22 hours a day, compared with
17 hours now.  The impact of the longer trading day on market participants
justifies intervention by U.S. regulators in delaying the change
and imposing a 30-day public comment period to “provide time to
assess” the issues, the groups said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
