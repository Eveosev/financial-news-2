Sotheby’s reported a first-quarter
loss as auction sales dropped 29 percent from a year earlier.  The  New York  auctioneer lost $10.7 million, or 16 cents a
share, compared with a profit of $2.4 million, or 3 cents a
share, a year earlier, it said in a statement. Revenue fell 12
percent to $105 million.  Sotheby’s said expenses rose 5 percent as it spent more to
develop its “presence in growth markets.”  The loss per share was in line with estimates of six
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Chief Executive Officer William Ruprecht said first-quarter
results would have been comparable to a year earlier were it not
for an “exceptional” single-owner sale in February 2011 that
totaled $132 million.  “As the excellent results of our May auctions make
abundantly clear, the first-quarter results are in no way
reflective of a slowdown in demand for works of art around the
world,” he said in a statement.  Last week,  Sotheby’s (BID)  sold a version of Edvard Munch’s “The
Scream” for $119.9 million, the highest price ever paid for an
artwork at auction.  The auctioneer typically posts a small loss or profit in
the first and third quarters. Its biggest auctions are held in
the second and fourth quarters.  Sotheby’s shares are down about 22 percent in the past 12
months. Today, they fell $1.40 to $34.04 in New York Stock
Exchange trading.  At year-end, Sotheby’s said it accounted for 51 percent of
the auction sales of fine art and decorative art, jewelry and
collectibles worldwide between the two major auction houses, up
from 49 percent in 2010. Its annual sales were $5 billion, up 16
percent.  To contact the reporter of this story:
