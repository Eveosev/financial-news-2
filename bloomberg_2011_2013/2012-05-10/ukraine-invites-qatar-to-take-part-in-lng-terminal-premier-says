Ukraine is inviting  Qatar  to help
build a liquefied-natural-gas terminal under a strategic
partnership program to be signed when President  Viktor
Yanukovych  visits the Persian Gulf nation in autumn this year.  Ukraine is also seeking LNG supplies from Qatar and
cooperation on domestic oil and gas production, Prime Minister
 Mykola Azarov  said at a government meeting today in Kiev, the
capital. Azarov held talks with Qatari Prime Minister Hamad Bin Jasim Bin Jabr Al Thani yesterday, while visiting the country.  The former Soviet republic plans to build an 846 million-
euro ($1.1 billion) LNG terminal at the port of Yuzhnyi, in the
Odessa region. About 70 percent of the costs will be borrowed,
Vladyslav Kaskiv, the head of state national projects, which is
managing the LNG project, said in March.  The terminal, which is to have capacity of 10 billion cubic
meters by 2018, is intended to help Ukraine diversify sources of
fuel away from  Russia . The eastern European nation depends on
imports from Moscow-based OAO Gazprom for about 70 percent of
its gas.  To contact the reporter on this story:
