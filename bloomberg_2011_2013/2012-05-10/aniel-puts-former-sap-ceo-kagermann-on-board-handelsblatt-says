Former  SAP AG (SAP)  Chief Executive Officer
 Henning Kagermann  will join the board of Franz Haniel & Cie.
GmbH,  Handelsblatt  reported, without saying where it got the
information.  Haniel, the closely held German company that controls drug
wholesaler  Celesio AG (CLS1) , will be adding a non-family member to its
board for the first time, the German newspaper said. Kagermann
is meant to be a “sparring partner” for Stephan Gemkow, the
 Deutsche Lufthansa AG (LHA)  executive who will become Haniel CEO in
September, Handelsblatt said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
