Bancolombia SA (PFBCOLO) ,  Colombia ’s largest
lender, dropped the most in four months after reporting an
increase in past-due loans during the first quarter.  Preferred shares slumped 3 percent to 29,440 pesos at the
close of trading in Bogota, the largest drop since Jan. 6. The
percentage of outstanding loans more than 30 days overdue rose
to 2.7 percent in the first quarter from 2.2 percent at the end
of 2011, while those more than 90 days past due rose to 1.4 from
1.3 percent, the company said in a regulatory filing.  Past due loans “grew significantly,” said David Pelaez,
an analyst at Bolsa y Renta brokerage in Medellin. “It may lead
some to question how much more it will deteriorate.”  Net credit outstanding grew 20 percent from the same period
last year, led by a 32 percent rise in consumer loans, according
to the filing. The bank may pare lending to riskier borrowers
after loosening standards in an effort to bolster market share,
said Sergio Restrepo, executive vice president of corporate
development at the Medellin-based bank.  “We do not expect these numbers to be the trend,”
Restrepo said on a conference call with investors. “We have to
balance if it’s worth returning again to more strict credit
standards.”  Palaez said the company had adequate provisions to cope
with a further increase in bad loans.  Consolidated first-quarter net income of 445.6 billion
pesos ($252.6 million) trailed the 448.3 billion pesos average
forecast of four analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Profit rose 27
percent from a year earlier. The bank forecast loan growth of 15
percent to 20 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
