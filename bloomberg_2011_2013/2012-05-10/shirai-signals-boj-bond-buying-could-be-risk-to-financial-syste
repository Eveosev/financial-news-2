The  Bank of Japan ’s growing purchases
of government debt may pose risk to the stability of financial
markets, a central bank board member indicated.  “That may be an issue,” board member Sayuri Shirai said
today at a press conference in Akita, northern  Japan . She was
responding to a question about whether excessive BOJ purchases
of public bonds could destabilize the financial system by
affecting yields. “The BOJ has been buying a considerable
amount of bonds from the market as a result of its monetary
easing.”  The central bank has twice this year pledged to buy more
government debt through the asset-purchase program, its main
policy tool. It said this week that its holdings of government
debt will probably exceed banknotes this year, an indication of
its growing stake in the world’s largest public debt market.  To contact the reporters on this story:
