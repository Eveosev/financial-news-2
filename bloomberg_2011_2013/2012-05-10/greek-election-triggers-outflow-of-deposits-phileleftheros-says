Concern over whether  Greece  will keep
the euro after the May 6 election caused an outflow of deposits
to Cyprus, Phileleftheros reported, without saying how it
obtained the information.  Depositors are seeking Cypriot banks and subsidiaries of
Greek banks on the island, the newspaper said.  -- Editor: Alan Purkiss  To contact the reporter on this story:
