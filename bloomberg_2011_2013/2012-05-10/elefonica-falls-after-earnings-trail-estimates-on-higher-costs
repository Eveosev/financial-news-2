Telefonica Brasil SA (VIVT3) ,  Brazil ’s
largest phone company by revenue, dropped to a two-week low
after first-quarter profit trailed analysts’ estimates on higher
costs associated with bringing all its services under the Vivo
brand.  Shares dropped 1.1 percent to 54.10 reais at the close in
Sao Paulo, the lowest since April 27. It was the worst performer
on the the  MSCI Brazil/Telecommunication Services Index (MXBR0TC) , which
gained 0.1 percent. The benchmark Bovespa index advanced 0.1
percent.  Net income fell 15 percent to 956.6 million reais ($486
million) in the first quarter, from 1.13 billion reais a year
earlier, the Sao Paulo-based phone company said in a regulatory
filing. The average  estimate  was for an adjusted profit of 1.03
billion reais, according to six analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  “Costs and expenses rose because of operational
integration with Vivo,” pressuring earnings before interest,
tax, depreciation and amortization margins, Marco Aurelio
Barbosa, an analyst at Coinvalores Corretora, wrote in a report
to clients.  Operating costs increased 5.6 percent in the quarter from a
year earlier, helped by a 32 percent jump in expenses with
staff, according to the filing. The company spent 130.2 million
reais on restructuring and 21.5 million reais on branding.  Telefonica has  gained  30 percent in the past 12 months as
the company completed last month the reorganization of its
mobile, internet, cable TV and fixed-line services under the
Vivo brand. The benchmark slipped 8 percent in that period.  Vivo, Telefonica’s mobile-phone operator in Brazil, boosted
its number of users by 21 percent in the first quarter to 74.8
million. Fixed-line clients of unit Telecomunicacoes de  Sao
Paulo  SA, or Telesp, rose 1.3 percent to 15.3 million.  To contact the reporters on this story:
