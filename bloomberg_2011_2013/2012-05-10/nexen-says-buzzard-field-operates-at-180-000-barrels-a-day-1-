Nexen Inc. (NXY)  is nearing full production
levels at its Buzzard field in the U.K. North Sea after an
unscheduled shutdown.  The 200,000-barrel-a-day field was producing at 180,000
barrels early today, Patti Lewis, a Calgary-based spokeswoman,
said in an e-mail.  “We’re well on our way to operating at full rates,” she
said.  Buzzard is the biggest contributor to the Forties crude
blend, one of four grades that make up Dated Brent, the
benchmark used to price more than half of the world’s oil.  To contact the reporter on this story:
