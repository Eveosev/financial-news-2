Betsey Johnson LLC, the bankrupt
women’s fashion retailer, won approval to sell all of its
merchandise to a joint venture formed by liquidators Hilco
Merchant Resources LLC and Gordon Brothers Retail Partners LLC.  U.S. Bankruptcy Judge James Peck in  Manhattan  today
approved the deal after lawyers for the company said it was the
best one achieved through an auction. Liquidating sales will be
able to begin tomorrow.  Hilco and Gordon will pay Betsey Johnson $5.2 million
immediately, and 102 percent of the total cost value of the
merchandise plus other variables, depending on how successful
the sales are, according to court papers.  “It looks as if the auction process was a very successful
one,” Peck said.  The case is In re Betsey Johnson LLC, 12-11732,  U.S.
Bankruptcy Court , Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
