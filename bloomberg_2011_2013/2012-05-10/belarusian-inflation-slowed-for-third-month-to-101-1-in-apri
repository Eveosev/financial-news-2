Belarusian inflation  slowed  for a
third month in April, decelerating to 101.1 percent from a year
earlier after a 106.5 percent increase in March, the state
statistics service said in a statement on its website today.  The central bank will consider lowering its benchmark
refinancing rate after the release of April inflation data,
Chairman Nadezhda Ermakova said May 3. The former Soviet
republic is seeking to cap consumer-price growth at 19 percent
to 22 percent this year after a foreign-currency currency
shortage and current-account deficit fanned price growth in
2011, the central bank said Jan. 30.  To contact the reporter on this story:
