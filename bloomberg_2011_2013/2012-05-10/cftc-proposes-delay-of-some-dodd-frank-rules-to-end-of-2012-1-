The U.S.  Commodity Futures Trading
Commission  proposed delaying some Dodd-Frank Act derivatives
regulations from taking effect until as late as the end of the
year.  The commission voted in a private process to allow
temporary exemptive relief from rules that were scheduled to
take effect in July 2011,  Gary Gensler , the agency’s chairman,
said today at a meeting in  Washington .  Gensler said the proposed exemptive order “addresses
comments from market participants requesting clarity regarding
the transactions in and clearing of agricultural swaps, as well
as comments from unregistered trading facilities that offer
swaps for trading.”  The CFTC is required under the Dodd-Frank Act to write
regulations that reduce risk in the swaps market after largely
unregulated derivatives trades helped fuel the 2008 credit
crisis.  To contact the reporter on this story:
