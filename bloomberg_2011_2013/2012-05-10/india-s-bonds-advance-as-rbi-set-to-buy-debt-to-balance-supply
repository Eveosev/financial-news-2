India ’s  bonds  rose after the central
bank said it will buy securities from the secondary market,
helping counter record sales this year.  The  Reserve Bank  of India offered to purchase a total of
120 billion rupees ($2.2 billion) of notes tomorrow, when the
 finance ministry  will also auction 150 billion rupees of
securities due in 2018, 2021, 2027 and 2036. Falling oil prices
are also aiding the rally on optimism inflation will ease,
according to Development Credit Bank Ltd. in Mumbai.  “Investors are optimistic the central bank will use more
open-market purchases to support the borrowing plan,” said
Debendra Kumar Dash, a fixed-income trader at the bank. “The
oil-price drop is supporting the slide in yields.”  The yield on the 8.79 percent bonds due November 2021
dropped two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 8.55
percent as of 9:55 a.m. in Mumbai, according to the central
bank’s trading system.  The government plans to borrow 5.7 trillion rupees in the
fiscal year that ends in March.  Crude oil has declined 9 percent since May 1 to $96.63 a
barrel in  New York . India is due to report inflation numbers on
May 14. The wholesale-price index, the country’s key gauge
covering costs in the economy, rose 6.89 percent in March from a
year earlier, according to official data. That was less than
6.95 percent in February and 9.68 percent in March last year.  The cost of one-year  interest-rate swaps , or derivative
contracts used to guard against fluctuations in funding costs,
rose four basis points to 8.08 percent, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
