Returns for Panamax ships that carry
grains and coal slumped as exports of the commodities slowed,
curbing demand for vessels.  Daily average earnings fell 2.9 percent to $10,774,
according to the London-based Baltic Exchange today. That’s the
eighth decline in a row and the lowest in three weeks, the data
show. Panamaxes are the second-largest vessels tracked by the
Baltic Dry Index, a broader gauge of costs to ship commodities,
which fell for a second day.  A slowdown in grain exports from  South America  has in part
contributed to the slide in rates for Panamax vessels, Oslo-
based investment bank Fearnley Fonds ASA said today in an e-
mailed report. The carrying capacity of the global Panamax fleet
reached 162.8 million deadweight tons this month, the most since
at least 1970, according to data from Clarkson Research Services
Ltd., a unit of the world’s largest shipbroker.  “In the Pacific the tonnage availability is high combined
with limited coal spot sales,” Fearnley Fonds said in the
report.  The Baltic Dry Index lost 0.9 percent to 1,146, the
exchange’s data showed. Returns for Capesizes, about twice the
size of Panamaxes and the largest ships in the gauge, decreased
for the first session in six, declining 1 percent to $8,769 a
day.  Supramaxes, about 25 percent smaller than Panamaxes, gained
0.1 percent to $11,671. Handysizes, the smallest vessels tracked
by the gauge, added 0.5 percent to $9,181, exchange data showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
