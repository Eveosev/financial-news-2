OMV AG (OMV)  said construction of the
Nabucco natural gas pipeline to transport gas from the  Caspian
region  to  Europe  may start in 2015.  Should the owners of the BP Plc-led Shah Deniz field in
Azerbaijan make a decision on whom to award its gas next year,
construction could start in 2015 and be completed in 2018, OMV’s
gas head Hans-Peter Floren told shareholders at the company’s
annual shareholder meeting in Vienna today.  Nabucco, which is a joint venture of OMV, Germany’s  RWE AG (RWE) ,
Budapest-based  Mol Nyrt. (MOL) , Bulgargaz EAD, Romania’s Transgaz SA
and Ankara-based Boru Hatlari ile Petrol Tasima AS, has faced
repeated delays after struggling to secure fuel sources. Mol
said last month that it isn’t prepared to finance the pipe and
may sell its stake.  Chief Executive Officer Gerhard Roiss told OMV’s
shareholders today that  Nabucco  is “more important than
ever” as it’s needed to transport gas from the OMV- Exxon Mobil
Corp. (XOM)  gas find in the  Black Sea . “It’s important to have a
pipeline in this region,” he said.  OMV announced in February that the Exxon-operated Domino-1
deep-sea offshore well encountered 1.5 to 3 trillion cubic feet
in what may be OMV’s biggest gas find ever.  The Nabucco project may now be cut to “Nabucco West”
starting at the Turkish-Bulgarian border and be complimented by
the Azeri-Turkish Trans-Anatolia Pipeline, known as Tanap, Roiss
said.  Turkey “doesn’t want this to be a pipeline in accordance
with European law,” Roiss said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
