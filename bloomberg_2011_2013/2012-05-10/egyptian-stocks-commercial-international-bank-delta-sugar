Egypt’s benchmark  EGX30 Index (EGX30)  fell

p.m. close in Cairo. That pared the gauge’s gain to 1.7 percent
this week.  The following shares were active on the Egyptian Exchange.
Stock symbols follow company names.  Commercial International Bank Egypt SAE (COMI)   increased
as much as 1 percent to 26.25 Egyptian pounds before closing at
26.06 pounds. First-quarter profit for the country’s largest
publicly traded lender climbed 64 percent to 505 million pounds
