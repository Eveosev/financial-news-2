     May 10 (Bloomberg) --　Japanese  stocks  fell for a second day,
with the  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  dipping below 9,000 for the
first time in three months, as concern  Greece  may be forced to
exit the euro outweighed improved earnings outlooks. Toyota
Motor Corp. rose after forecasting profit will more than double.  Canon Inc. (7751) , a camera maker that gets 31 percent of its
revenue in Europe, lost 0.7 percent. Sumitomo Rubber Industries
Ltd. led declines among tire makers after rubber slumped by the
most in more than four months. Toyota, Asia’s biggest car
manufacturer, rose 1.9 percent.  Tokyo Electric Power Co. (9501)  jumped
13 percent after the government took control of the utility.  The Nikkei 225 Stock Average lost 0.3 percent to 9,019.88
as of 10:34 a.m. in  Tokyo , headed for its lowest close since Feb.
13, after falling to as low as 8,985.90. The broader Topix Index
was little changed at 766.00, with about two stocks declining
for each that rose.  “Greece may be going back to square one and fall into
chaotic default without getting a second bailout,” said Hitoshi Asaoka, a Tokyo-based senior strategist at Mizuho Trust &
Banking Co., a unit of Japan’s third-largest bank by market
value. “There’s been nothing negative about earnings at
domestic companies, but the market attention has been
deflected.”  The Nikkei 225 dropped below 9,000 for the first time since
Feb. 14, when the  Bank of Japan  surprised the market by
expanding its government bond purchases and setting an inflation
goal of 1 percent. The gauge has retreated 12 percent from this
year’s high on March 27 amid concern resistance to austerity
measures will worsen  Europe ’s debt crisis and China will refrain
from further easing to spur growth.  Greek Impasse  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index added 0.1
percent today. The  gauge  slid 0.7 percent in  New York  yesterday
to the lowest level in two months as coalition talks in Greece
reached an impasse, stoking concern the country may not hold to
the terms of its two bailouts negotiated since May 2010, leading
it to default and an exit from the euro.  Stocks on the Topix were valued at 0.93 times book value,
compared with 2.15 for the S&P 500 and 1.37 for the Stoxx Europe
600 Index. A value less than one means investors can buy
companies for less than the value of their assets.  The  Nikkei 225 Volatility Index (VNKY)  gained 1.1 percent to 22.09,
indicating traders expect a swing of 6.3 percent on the
benchmark gauge over the next 30 days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
