OAO Rostelecom,  Russia ’s long-
distance phone operator, rose the most in almost two months
after Vedomosti reported President  Vladimir Putin  ordered the
completion of its merger with OAO Svyazinvest, the national
telecommunications holding.  Rostelecom added 2.2 percent to 127.86 rubles by the close
in Moscow, its biggest gain since March 14.  On May 2, Putin ordered the merger of the two state-owned
companies be completed by April next year, Vedomosti reported
today. Svyazinvest  owns  13 percent of Rostelecom, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  “With this order Putin has confirmed that the
privatization of Rostelecom is on its way,” Victor Klimovich,
an analyst at VTB Capital, said by phone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
