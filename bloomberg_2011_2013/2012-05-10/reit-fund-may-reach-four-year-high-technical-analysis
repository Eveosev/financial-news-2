The  iShares Dow Jones U.S. Real
Estate Index Fund  may increase as much as 13 percent after
breaking above a price level where it has stalled previously,
according to  Katie Stockton  of MKM Partners.  The fund, which tracks the U.S. real estate industry and
currently  trades  at $63.81, crossed the resistance level of $63
in the week ending May 4, according to the firm’s analysis. The
fund had approached that level and retreated three times last
year and again in April. Crossing the threshold could send the
fund’s price to $72, about the level it last reached in May
2008, Stockton wrote in a May 9 report.  “This breakout targets that May 2008 level over the long-
term, meaning the next several months,” Stockton, chief market
technician at MKM, said in a telephone interview. “It might be
sooner than that. It’s a relatively conservative upside
target.”  The breakout by the Reit index fund, which has risen 12
percent this year while the  Standard & Poor’s  500 index advanced
7.7 percent, is a “bullish development” for the industry,
Stockton wrote in the report. The fund reached its year-to-date
intraday high of $64.87 on May 1.  The fund shows signs of being overbought, implying that it
may fall as low as $59 before it rises to $72, according to
Stockton.  “Because it’s run into some resistance you might see it
stabilize, if not underperform, for a little period here,”
Stockton said. “It’s not an area of the market I would short
because it has broken out, but I would certainly wait for a
better point of entry.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
