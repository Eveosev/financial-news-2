TAG Immobilien AG (TEG)  said first-quarter
profit soared and raised its forecasts for 2012 after the German
real-estate company bought a Bayerische Landesbank real-estate
unit.  Net income rose to 88.3 million euros ($114 million), or 95
cents a share, from 10.6 million euros, or 16 cents, a year
earlier, the Hamburg-based company said in a statement today.
TAG increased its pretax profit forecast to 140 million euros
from 75 million euros.  In March, TAG agreed to buy DKB AG Immobilien from
Bayerische Landesbank for 160 million euros and said the deal
would more than double its portfolio to about 56,000 homes.
Rental income for the first quarter rose to 34.4 million euros
from 24.4 million euros, TAG said today.  “Enlarging our portfolio will help us to realize
additional economies of scale,” the company said in the
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
