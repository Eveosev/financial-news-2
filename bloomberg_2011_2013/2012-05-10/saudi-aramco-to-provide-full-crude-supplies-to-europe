Saudi Arabian Oil Co., the worldâ€™s
largest crude exporter, will supply full volumes in June to
customers in  Europe , unchanged from this month, according to two
refinery officials with knowledge of the matter.  Saudi Aramco , as the company is known, will provide 100
percent of crude cargoes sold under long-term contracts, said
the officials, who declined to be identified because the
agreements are confidential.  The kingdom exported in January 860,000 barrels a day of
Arab Light and Extra Light crude, 20,000 barrels of Arab Medium,
and 10,000 barrels of Arab Heavy grade to European members of
the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development except
Hungary, the  International Energy Agency  said in its monthly oil
market report on April 12.  Saudi Aramco will also provide full supplies to customers
in Asia next month, according to buyers at four regional
refiners who received notification from the producer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
