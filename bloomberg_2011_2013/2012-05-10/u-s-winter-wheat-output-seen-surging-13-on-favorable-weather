U.S. winter-wheat production may
surge 13 percent this year as warm, wet weather in the southern
Great Plains and eastern Midwest boosts yields and encourages
farmers to harvest early.  The crop may total 1.694 billion bushels, up from 1.494
billion last year, the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  said today
in a  report . Analysts in a Bloomberg survey forecast 1.658
billion bushels, on average. Hard-red winter varieties grown in
the southern Plains and soft-red winter wheat sown in the
Midwest account for about two-thirds of U.S. wheat output.  “The soft-red winter crop looks excellent,” Dan Manternach, a wheat economist at Doane Advisory Services in  St.
Louis , said in a telephone interview earlier this week. The crop
in Kansas, the biggest grower of winter varieties, is
“certainly better than most of us would’ve expected,” he said
after touring fields in the state for three days.  Wheat futures in  Chicago  have fallen 8.1 percent this year,
closing at $6 a bushel yesterday, as parts of  Kansas  and
 Oklahoma , the biggest winter-wheat growers, had more than twice
the normal amount of rainfall in the past 60 days,  National
Weather Service  data show.  Output of hard-red winter wheat, used to make bread, may
jump 32 percent to 1.032 billion bushels from 780.1 million last
year, according to the  USDA . Production of soft-red winter
wheat, used in cakes and cookies, will fall 6.4 percent to 428.3
million bushels, the department said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
