Nova Ljubljanska Banka d.d.,
 Slovenia ’s biggest financial services company, extended losses
in the first quarter as loan-loss provisions climbed.  NLB had a loss for the parent company of 34.6 million euro
for the bank when its units in the Balkans are included, the
Ljubljana-based lender said in a regulatory  statement . That
compares with a profit of 3.9 million euro in the same period a
year earlier. Provisions for bad loans were 98 million euros.  “Business in the first three months has been marked by a
continued deterioration of the quality of our portfolio,” NLB
said in the statement.  Nova Ljubljanska, in which the government holds an indirect
majority, may suffer further this year as Slovenia slides into
its second  recession  in three years, pushing more companies into
bankruptcy and forcing banks to set aside record levels of bad-
loan provisions.  NLB wants to raise 400 million euros in equity capital by
the end of June to improve its core Tier 1 ratio to above 9
percent as demanded by the European Banking Authority and the
Slovenian central bank.  NLB and other Slovenian lenders, which are relying on loans
from the  European Central Bank  for liquidity, have reduced
lending because of restricted availability of financing from
outside the country, the central bank said in March.  To contact the reporter on this story:
