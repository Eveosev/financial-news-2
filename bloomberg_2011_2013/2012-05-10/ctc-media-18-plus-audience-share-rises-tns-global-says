CTC Media Inc. (CTCM) ’s average daily share
of viewers 18 years and older for its CTC television channel
rose to 6.1 percent in the week to May 6, according to TNS-
Global.  Viewer share for CTC TV, the Nasdaq-listed Russian media
company’s biggest source of revenue, rose from 5.5 percent in
the previous week, data researcher TNS-Global said by e-mail
today. CTC’s average daily audience among viewers 4 years old
and over rose to 7.1 percent in the week to May 6, from 6.5
percent in the week to April 29, the data show.  CTC failed to regain the fifth-most watched ranking it had
lost to REN TV in the previous week, while retaining its fifth
place among viewers 4 years old and over, TNS-Global said.  Russia’s government-controlled  Pervyi Kanal  regained its
top spot among both audiences, outpacing  NTV Television , which
had the third-biggest audience in both categories behind
government-controlled Rossiya-1, the data show. TNT was the
fourth-most watched channel ahead of CTC among viewers 4 and
over.  To contact the reporters on this story:
