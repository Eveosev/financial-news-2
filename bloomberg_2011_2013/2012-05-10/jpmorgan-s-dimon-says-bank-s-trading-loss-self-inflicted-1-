JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  Chief Executive
Officer  Jamie Dimon  said the bank made egregious mistakes and
that the losses of about $2 billion tied to synthetic credit
securities were “self-inflicted.”  “We’re accountable, and what happened violates
our own standards and principles about how we want to operate
the company,” Dimon said in a conference call today. “This is
not how we want to run a business.”  The bank fell 6.2 percent to $38.20 at 5:26 p.m. in
extended trading in New York after disclosing the losses at its
chief investment office. Dimon said the New York-based lender
made the trades to guard against  credit risk .  “In re-hedging the portfolio, it was a bad strategy, badly
executed and poorly monitored,” Dimon said.  Dimon told analysts they should assume his bank keeps
regulators informed about its finances and that the trades may
not run afoul of the so-called Volcker rule, which seeks to
limit banks’ bets with their own funds.  “We do believe you need to have the ability to hedge in a
CIO-type position, and that Volcker allows that,” he said.
“This trading may not violate the Volcker rule, but it violates
the Dimon principle.”  Dimon said that while the changes in prices contributed to
the losses, he didn’t want to cite what he called the excuse of
“market dislocation” and he said other banks may have been
spared losses from the disruption.  “Just because we’re stupid doesn’t mean everybody else
was,” Dimon said. This “puts egg on our face and we deserve
any criticism we get.”  Editors: Dan Kraut, Steven Crabill  To contact the reporter on this story:
