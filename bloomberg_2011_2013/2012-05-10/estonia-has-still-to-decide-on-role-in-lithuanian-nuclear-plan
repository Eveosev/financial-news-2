Estonia  will decide whether to take
part in  Lithuania ’s Visaginas nuclear plant project when it can
assess the profitability of its potential contribution based on
the construction plan, Prime Minister  Andrus Ansip  said.  “Profitability is the key issue for us,” he told a news
conference in Tallinn today.  Lithuania wants to cut its dependence on electricity
imports from  Russia  after closing the Soviet-era Ignalina
facility at the end of 2009. Neighboring Latvia and Estonia rely
less on energy imports because of hydro and oilshale resources.
The Lithuanian government plans to build the 1,300-megawatt
reactor in Visaginas by 2020.  The plan is for Lithuania to have an initial stake of 38
percent in the plant, which may cost as much as $6.5 billion,
Economy Minister Arvydas Sekmokas said yesterday. Estonia may
hold 22 percent, while Latvia and  Hitachi Ltd. (6501) , a Japanese
reactor-builder, would hold 20 percent each. The Lithuanian
government is also in talks with neighboring Poland on possible
participation, Sekmokas said.  Ansip said Estonia’s position on the project is shared by
other partners.  “Latvia, which has constantly participated in
negotiations, and as far as I know also the Polish energy
company, will again analyze their intent to participate once it
is possible to assess the profitability of the project,” he
said.  A concession agreement for construction of the plant, which
was signed with Hitachi in March, requires the approval of
Lithuania’s parliament by June 28.  To contact the reporter on this story:
