German 30-year bunds advanced,
pushing the yield on the securities to a record low.  The yield dropped as much as two basis points to 2.211
percent, the least since Bloomberg started collecting the data
in 1994. It was at 2.215 percent as of 10:04 a.m. London time.  The German 10-year bund reversed a decline, leaving the
yield one basis point lower at 1.51 percent after earlier rising
to as high as 1.55 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
