(Corrects to billion from million in second paragraph of
story first published yesterday.)  Corn fell for the second time this
week as planting advanced in the U.S., the world’s largest
grower, boosting production prospects before a government report
that may show rising domestic and world supplies.  About 71 percent of the crop in the U.S. had been  planted 
by May 6, up from 32 percent a year earlier, the most recent
Department of Agriculture data show. Above-average temperatures
allowed crop development to accelerate, the USDA said in a
weekly  bulletin  yesterday. The U.S. may harvest a record 14.395
billion bushels of corn, according to a Bloomberg News survey
before the USDA releases its production estimates tomorrow.  “The weather has been benign across the Midwest,” Victor Thianpiriya, an analyst at  Australia & New Zealand Banking Group
Ltd. (ANZ) , said by phone from  Melbourne  today, referring to the
absence of weather-related events that may harm the harvest in
the largest U.S. growing region. “There’s been no support from
weather for corn prices.”  Corn for July delivery fell 0.4 percent to $6.205 a bushel
on the Chicago Board of Trade as of 10:48 a.m.  London  time. The
most-active contract is down 4 percent this year on prospects
for increasing production.  World inventories will probably rise to 138.29 million
metric tons before the 2013 Northern Hemisphere harvests, from
an estimated 122 million tons a year earlier, as the crop in the
U.S. expands, according to the Bloomberg News survey.  Soybeans for July delivery lost 0.7 percent to $14.2875 a
bushel. The most-active contract has dropped 5.5 percent since
May 2, when prices reached the highest level since July 2008 as
drought hurt crops in Argentina and  Brazil . U.S. farmers may
plant 3.214 million acres in soybeans, 5.2 percent more than a
year earlier, according to the Bloomberg survey.  “The negative news from  South America  should be priced in
by now, giving way to expectations that the high price level
will provoke a positive supply reaction,”  Carsten Fritsch , an
analyst at Commerzbank AG, said today in a report.  Wheat for July delivery fell 0.4 percent to $6.125 a
bushel. In Paris, November-delivery milling wheat slid 0.3
percent to 197.50 euros ($256.24) a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
