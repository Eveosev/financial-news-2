Croatia ’s economy will contract 1
percent this year as personal consumption and investment
decrease, central bank Governor Zeljko Rohatinski said.  The fiscal deficit will narrow to “about 5 percent” of
gross domestic product on the government’s cost-cutting
measures, Rohatinski said today at a conference in Opatija,
Croatia, according to a statement released by the bank. In
December he forecast a “possible” recession, while forecasting
the  budget deficit  to widen to 7 percent of economic output,
should the government fail with fiscal consolidation efforts.  “Croatia needs a serious approach to basic problems, it
needs to further consolidate the public sector, remove
impediments to investment and improve the level of enterprise in
the private sector,” he said.  Croatia, which is set to become the  European Union’ s 28th
member in 2013, needs to service a growing external debt and
revive its faltering economy. Prime Minister  Zoran Milanovic 
said in February that the economy will grow 0.8 percent in 2012,
while the  World Bank  said last month the economy will contract 1
percent, after stagnating in 2011.  The government, which took power in January, proposed to
cut spending by 4 billion kuna ($689 million) by approving lower
subsidies to state companies and clipping the public wage bill.  Inflation will rise to 3.5 percent this year from 2.1
percent in 2011, Rohatinski said.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
