Japanese  shares  fell a second day,
with the  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  sliding to a three-month low,
as concern Greece may exit the euro and slowing  China  trade
sapped demand for riskier assets. Losses were limited on Toyota
Motor Corp.’s improved earnings forecast.  Canon Inc., a camera maker that gets 31 percent of its
revenue in  Europe , lost 0.7 percent.  Fanuc Corp. (6954) , a maker of
automation controls used in Chinese factories, fell 0.3 percent.
Toyota gained 0.8 percent.  Tokyo  Electric Power Co. jumped 6.5
percent after the government took control of the utility.  The Nikkei 225 Stock Average fell 0.4 percent to 9,009.65,
its lowest close since Feb. 13, at 3 p.m. in Tokyo after
swinging between gains and losses at least 10 times. The broader
Topix Index lost less than 0.1 percent to 765.42.  “ Greece  may be going back to square one and fall into
chaotic default without getting a second bailout,” said Hitoshi Asaoka, a Tokyo-based senior strategist at Mizuho Trust &
Banking Co., a unit of  Japan ’s third-largest bank by market
value. “There’s been nothing negative about earnings at
domestic companies, but the market attention has been
deflected.”  The Nikkei 225 earlier fell as low as 8,985.90, dropping
below 9,000 for the first time since Feb. 14, when the  Bank of
Japan  surprised the market by expanding its government bond
purchases. The gauge has retreated 12 percent from this year’s
high on March 27 amid concern resistance to austerity measures
will worsen Europe’s debt crisis and China will refrain from
further easing to spur growth.  Greek Impasse  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index added 0.3
percent today. The  gauge  slid 0.7 percent in  New York  yesterday
to the lowest level in two months as coalition talks in Greece
reached an impasse, stoking concern the country may not hold to
the terms of its two bailouts negotiated since May 2010, leading
it to a possible default and exit from the euro.  Canon fell 0.7 percent to 3,460 yen. Shimano Inc., a maker
of bicycle parts that generates 36 percent of its revenue in
Europe, lost 3.2 percent to 4,920 yen.  Stocks also fell after China’s exports rose 4.9 percent
from a year earlier, the customs bureau said on its website
today. That compares with the 8.5 percent median estimate in a
Bloomberg News survey of 33 analysts. Import growth of 0.3
percent trailed forecasts for a 10.9 percent gain.  Fanuc slid 0.3 percent to 13,290 yen.  Komatsu Ltd. (6301) , a
construction machinery maker that gets 14 percent of its sales
out of China, lost 0.4 percent to 2,052 yen.  ‘Very Cheap’  Stocks on the Topix are valued at 0.93 times book value,
compared with 2.15 for the S&P 500 and 1.37 for the Stoxx Europe
600 Index. A value less than one means investors can buy
companies for less than the value of their assets.  “Stocks are very cheap, and I’ve been buying a lot today
and yesterday,” said　Ichiro Takamatsu, a  fund manager  at
Tokyo-based Bayview Asset Management Co. that oversees about
$1.9 billion.  Among stocks that rose, Toyota advanced 0.8 percent to
3,170 yen after  Asia ’s biggest carmaker forecast profit will
more than double to a five-year high and revenue will climb more
than analysts estimated.  Net income may increase to 760 billion yen ($9.5 billion)
in the fiscal year ending March 2013, after falling to 283.6
billion yen, Toyota said yesterday. The carmaker forecast
revenue will increase 18 percent to 22 trillion yen, exceeding
the 20.8 trillion yen average analyst estimate compiled by
Bloomberg.  Tokyo Electric Power, owner of the crippled Fukushima
nuclear plant, climbed 6.5 percent to 196 yen after the
government took over the utility and agreed to provide 1
trillion yen as part of a bailout.  The  Nikkei 225 Volatility Index (VNKY)  gained 0.2 percent to 21.89,
indicating traders expect a swing of 6.3 percent on the
benchmark gauge over the next 30 days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
