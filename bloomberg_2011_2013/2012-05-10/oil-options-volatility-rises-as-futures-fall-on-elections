Oil options volatility fell to a
five-day low as underlying futures were little changed a second
straight day.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
June, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge
of options prices, was 26.9 percent at 3:25 p.m. on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange , down from 27.4 percent yesterday.
Volatility had risen as high as 28.17 percent on May 8 after
prices dropped $9 over five sessions.  “For prices to move sharply lower and extend the rise in
volatility, we need catalysts,”  Harry Tchilinguirian , head of
commodity markets strategy at BNP Paribas SA in  London , said in
an e-mailed report today. “The inventory and supply side
fundamentals that bear down on prices in the near term are by
now largely discounted.”  Crude oil for June delivery rose 27 cents to settle at
$97.08 a barrel. Prices fell 20 cents yesterday.  The most-active oil options in electronic trading today
