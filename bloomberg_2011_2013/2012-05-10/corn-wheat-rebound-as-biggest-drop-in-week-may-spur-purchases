Corn advanced for the second time
this week on speculation that yesterday’s plunge, the biggest in
a week, may spur importer demand. Wheat climbed.  Corn for July delivery gained as much as 0.7 percent to
$6.1175 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade and was at
$6.1125 at 2:26 p.m. Singapore time. July-delivery wheat rose as
much as 1.3 percent to $6.075 a bushel and last traded at $6.07.  Corn prices slumped 2.5 percent yesterday, the biggest drop
since May 2, after Global Weather Monitoring said beneficial
conditions will boost planting and crop growth in parts of the
U.S. Wheat dropped 2.4 percent, also the most since May 2, on
speculation a U.S. Department of Agriculture report today will
show domestic stockpiles have increased.  “When you get a large sell-off of the scale we have seen
in recent weeks, you do get somewhat of a bounce-back,”  Michael Creed , an agribusiness economist at National Australia Bank
Ltd., said by phone from  Melbourne  today. “When you look at the
fundamentals driving wheat, corn and soybeans, not an awful lot
has changed in the last couple of days.”  Corn prices are down 5.4 percent this year as U.S. farmers
told the government in March they intend to plant the most acres
since 1937. The U.S. may harvest a record 14.395 billion bushels
of corn, according to a Bloomberg News survey.  Wheat reserves at the end of the next marketing year on May
31, 2013, may total 827 million bushels, according to a
Bloomberg News survey. That’s up from 793 million forecast by
the USDA at the end of this month. Warm weather and timely rains
have increased prospects for winter varieties that are set to be
harvested later this month and in early June.  ‘Bearish Situation’  “Wheat fundamentals point to a bearish situation because
you have fairly solid crop prospects for the season ahead,”
Creed said. “Corn’s one where there’s a bit of a reason to be
bearish just on the size of the projection of the U.S. crop.”  Soybeans for July delivery rose 0.8 percent to $14.4175 a
bushel, snapping three days of declines. Futures rose 19 percent
this year on concern drought may curb output in  South America .
On May 2, the most-active contract touched $15.125 a bushel, the
highest since July 2008.  China ’s soybean  imports , the world’s biggest, were 4.88
million metric tons in April, up from 4.83 million tons in March
and 26 percent more than a year ago, the Beijing-based customs
office said in a statement today. Purchases may be about 6
million tons and 5.5 million tons in May and June, while
averaging 4.6 million tons a month in July to September, state-
owned researcher Grain.gov.cn said today.  To contact the reporter for this story:
