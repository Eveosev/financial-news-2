Brian Dunn may receive either $3.1
million or zero in termination payments after he resigned as
chief executive officer of  Best Buy Co. (BBY) , depending on whether
his departure was deemed voluntary.  Dunn, 52, would not be entitled to any payment if it is
determined that he resigned voluntarily while he would receive
payment if his departure is deemed involuntary, Richfield,
Minnesota-based Best Buy said in a  filing  today.  Best Buy, the world’s largest consumer-electronics
retailer, said in the filing that it’s reviewing Dunn’s
compensation pending its investigation into his personal
conduct. Dunn’s payment under the terms of an involuntary
departure would comprise cash of $2.2 million and stock awards
of $891,367, as of the fiscal year ended March 3, the filing
said.  The company also said it will make the results of its probe
into Dunn publicly available and plans to disclose the final
terms of his departure. Dunn resigned on April 9.  Best Buy “has no comment” regarding Dunn’s compensation
beyond the filing, Bruce Hight, a spokesman, said by e-mail
today.  Last fiscal year, Dunn’s compensation increased 41 percent
to $7.1 million, boosted by stock awards of $3.6 million,
according to the filing. His salary increased 5.6 percent to
$1.1 million while option awards declined 29 percent to $2.3
million. He received no stock awards a year earlier.  Best Buy slipped 0.1 percent to $20.10 at the close in  New
York . The shares have dropped 14 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
