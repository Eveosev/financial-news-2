Sands China Ltd. (1928) , the Hong Kong-
listed unit of billionaire  Sheldon Adelson ’s Las Vegas-based
company, will be added to the  Hang Seng  Index effective June 4.  The total number of constituents of Hong Kong’s stock
benchmark will increase to 49 with the addition, Hang Seng
Indexes Co., the index provider, said in an e-mailed statement
today.  New China Life Insurance Co. (1336) , a Beijing-based life
insurer, will be added to the Hang Seng China Enterprises Index
of Chinese companies, while China Railway Construction Corp.
will be removed, Hang Seng said.  The changes may impact share prices, as index-tracked
funds, including the  Hang Seng Index Exchange-Traded Fund (2833)  with a
 total asset value  of HK$30.5 billion ($4 billion), adjust their
holdings. The  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  is down 2.7 percent since its last
quarterly review on Feb. 10, when no changes were announced.  To contact the reporters on this story:
