Gold rebounded from the lowest level
in four months as the metal’s slide, driven by  Europe ’s debt
crisis and a stronger dollar, spurred buying from investors.
Platinum and palladium advanced.  Spot gold rose for the first time in four days, gaining as
much as 0.4 percent to $1,595.80 an ounce and trading at
$1,594.55 at 3:20 p.m. in Singapore. The metal fell to $1,580.13
yesterday, the lowest since Jan. 3. Gold’s so-called 14-day
relative-strength index, which dropped yesterday below the 30
level that may indicate a rebound, was at 31.435 today.  Gold slumped 3.2 percent in the first three days of this
week as Greek politicians struggled to form a government
following weekend elections, boosting speculation that the
country may quit the  euro zone .  “The drop was large and quick, so it’s not surprising to
see some buying at these levels,” said Xiang Nan, an analyst at
CITICS Futures Co., a unit of  China ’s biggest listed brokerage.
“But the dollar looks to be strong in the near term and this
will limit gains.”  June-delivery bullion was little changed at $1,595.20 on
the Comex in  New York , after falling to $1,578.50 yesterday. The
euro rose 0.3 percent after declining for the past eight days.  Pasok party leader  Evangelos Venizelos  will try to form a
government when he receives a three-day mandate from Greek
President Karolos Papoulias today, after Alexis Tsipras of the
anti-bailout Syriza party and Antonis Samaras of  New Democracy 
failed. China Investment Corp. said that it has stopped buying
European government debt because of the crisis on the continent.  Schaeuble’s Outlook  More than 50 percent of investors are predicting an exit
from the 17-nation euro area this year, according to the
Bloomberg Global Poll. “If Greece decides not to stay in the
euro zone, we cannot force Greece,” German Finance Minister
 Wolfgang Schaeuble  said yesterday.  Cash platinum, this year’s best-performing precious metal,
rose for the first day in three, gaining as much as 0.6 percent
to $1,509.38 an ounce. It was last at $1,506.50, after slumping
to $1,490.75 yesterday, the lowest level since Jan. 16.  Spot palladium, this year’s worst-performing precious metal,
snapped an eight-day losing streak, gaining as much as 0.9
percent to $619.25 an ounce. It tumbled to $609.75 yesterday,
the lowest since Jan. 9, and was last at $616.25.  Silver rose as much as 0.5 percent to $29.36 an ounce,
after retreating to $28.6375 yesterday, the lowest since Jan. 9.
It was last at $29.315.  To contact the reporter on this story:
