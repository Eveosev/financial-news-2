German  Chancellor Angela Merkel  said
that people in Ukraine and Belarus suffer under “dictatorship
and repression,” her sharpest comment since jailed Ukrainian
opposition leader  Yulia Tymoshenko ’s hunger strike.  Merkel’s criticism, made in a speech to lower-house
lawmakers in Berlin today, came as German doctors supervise
Tymoshenko’s health in Ukraine. EU officials have said they
won’t attend Euro 2012 soccer championship events in Ukraine.
The tournament is being hosted by Ukraine and Poland next month.  “Today, Germany and the European Union are living in peace
and freedom,” Merkel said, noting that May 8 was the
anniversary of the end of World War II. “Unfortunately, not all
of  Europe  is, because in Ukraine and Belarus people are still
suffering under dictatorship and repression.”  Tymoshenko was found guilty of overstepping her authority
as premier when signing a gas accord with  Russia  in 2009. She
began a hunger strike April 20 after saying she was attacked by
three men, punched and forced to go to a hospital near Kharkiv.  A probe by the Prosecutor General’s Office showed she
wasn’t beaten, Foreign Ministry spokesman Oleksandr Dikusarov
said on May 8. Tymoshenko was transferred to hospital for
treatment supervised by German doctors yesterday after ending
her two-and-a-half-week hunger strike.  To contact the reporters on this story:
