Henry Kravis and  George Roberts , co-
founders and co-chief executive officers of  KKR & Co. (KKR) , got at
least $137 million each in pay and cash dividends in 2012 as
their payouts climbed from $94 million apiece a year earlier.  Kravis and Roberts, both 69, earned $35 million in
compensation, consisting of $300,000 salaries and $34.7 million
each primarily in carried interest, or their share of deal
profits. Kravis received $102 million in cash dividends from his
ownership of KKR stock, bringing his total to $137.2 million,
New York-based KKR said yesterday in a  filing  with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission. Roberts got $106 million in
stock dividends, bringing his total to $140.8 million.  The private-equity firm isn’t required by the  New York 
Stock Exchange, where its shares are listed, to have a
compensation committee because the firm is considered a limited
partnership. As a result, executive compensation decisions are
left to Kravis and Roberts, who are cousins and serve as co-
chairmen of the company’s board of directors.  KKR’s economic net income after taxes, a measure of profit
excluding some costs, more than quadrupled to $2 billion in 2012
from the previous year, the firm said earlier this month. The
increase was driven by KKR’s more than 20 so-called liquidity
events during the year, selling assets and stakes in holdings,
and a 24 percent gain in the value of its private-equity
holdings, outpacing the 13 percent gain in the  MSCI All-Country
World Index. (MXWD)   ‘Attractive Returns’  “Our portfolio is performing, our cash distributions are
starting to flow and our balance sheet is generating attractive
returns,”  Scott Nuttall , KKR’s global head of capital and asset
management, said in a conference call earlier this month while
discussing the year’s earnings. Nuttall said KKR returned over
$9 billion to its investors, a record for the firm, founded in
1976.  The company’s  stock  beat the broader markets, gaining 19
percent in 2012, compared with the 13 percent increase in the
Standard & Poor’s 500 index of large U.S. stocks. Shares of
competitor  Blackstone Group LP (BX)  rose 11 percent, and  Apollo
Global Management LLC (APO)  surged 40 percent.  Blackstone, the largest private-equity firm by assets, said
it will disclose its executives’ compensation in a filing with
the SEC at the end of the month.  Stephen Schwarzman , the
company’s 66-year-old CEO and co-founder, took home $213.5
million in 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
