Brandon Saad scored a shorthanded
goal in the third period to defeat the San Jose Sharks 2-1 as
his  Chicago Blackhawks  broke the National Hockey League record
for a season-opening point streak.  The Blackhawks, 14-0-3 this season, have recorded at least
one point in each of their first 17 games to surpass the Anaheim
Ducks, who held the record at 12-0-4 in 16 games in the 2006-07
season when they won the  Stanley Cup .  Chicago leads the NHL with 31 points in 14 wins and three
overtime losses. The Sharks are 8-5-3 with 19 points.  Patrick Marleau  scored the Sharksâ€™ goal with 15 seconds
left in the first period. Victor Stalberg tied the game at 1-1
with a goal 16 minutes, 40 seconds into the second period on his
home ice at United Center in Chicago.  Saad added the winning goal with Brent Seabrook in the
penalty box for tripping Logan Couture.  To contact the reporter on this story:
