Paul Elliott , an anti-racism
activist and former soccer player, has resigned from his roles
with England’s Football Association over “discriminatory
abusive comments” he made.  Elliott, whose career included stints at Charlton,  Aston
Villa  and Chelsea, made the comments to former business partner
and ex-Charlton player Richard Rufus, English soccer’s governing
body said in a  statement  on its website. Both men are black.  F.A. Chairman  David Bernstein  said Elliott’s position with
the organization was “untenable” after the incident. Elliott
was a member of the F.A. judicial panel and also a nominated
member of committees to European soccer governing body UEFA, the
F.A. said.  Elliott, 48, also resigned from  Kick It Out , the soccer
anti-racism group said in a statement on its website.  “Earlier this week, a former friend and business colleague
made public a SMS text message I sent him, in which I used a
term which is widely known as being derogatory to my own
community,” Elliott said in the statement. “I regret using it,
it is inappropriate and not part of my everyday vocabulary.  “As an advocate of high-standards of public behavior, and
integrity in public life, I know the use of this word sends out
mixed messages and contradicts my position as a Kick It Out
trustee. I will continue to be active in other projects in what
I believe to be a true and just cause.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
