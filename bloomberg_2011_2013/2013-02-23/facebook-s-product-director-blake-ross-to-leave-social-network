Facebook Inc. (FB) ’s product director
Blake Ross is leaving the company after joining it in 2007 as
part of the first acquisition by the operator of the largest
 social network .  The company confirmed the departure in an e-mail without
providing further details. Ross moved to Facebook with the
purchase of Parakey Inc., whose software made it easier to
transfer information between personal computers and the
Internet. Parakey was run by Ross and Joe Hewitt, who also
created the Web browser Firefox.  Ross’s duties at Facebook included serving on a team that
focused on user growth. It was formed in late 2007 as the sign-
up rate cooled, even as the service approached 100 million
members. The growth team’s effort helped boost user adoption
and, by last year, the service had topped 1 billion members.  Ross’s exit follows the departure of several Facebook
employees since the company held its initial public offering in
May 2012. Senior executives Katie Mitic and Ethan Beard said in
August that they were leaving the  Menlo Park , California-based
company.  Facebook fell less than 1 percent to $27.13 today at the
New York close.  The stock  has declined 29 percent since the
company went public at $38 a share.  -- Editors: Stephen West, Reed Stevenson  To contact the reporter on this story:
