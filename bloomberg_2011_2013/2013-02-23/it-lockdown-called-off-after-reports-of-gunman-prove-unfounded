Police called off a security
lockdown at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in
Cambridge, Massachusetts, this morning after failing to
corroborate earlier reports of a gunman in body armor on campus.  A person carrying a long rifle was reported in the Main
Group Building, according to a  posting  on the school’s emergency
information website at 9:22 a.m. local time. Students were urged
“to stay indoors and shelter in place and report suspicious
activity to the campus police dispatch.”  Cambridge police said its officers and those from other law
enforcement agencies joined in a search for the gunman.  By midmorning, no one matching the description had been
found and the search was called off, according to a tweeted
statement by the police.  “Scene is clear. Call unfounded. No threat to public
safety,” police said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
