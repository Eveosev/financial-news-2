England defeated New Zealand by five
wickets in Auckland to win their one-day international cricket
series 2-1.  England bowled New Zealand out for 185 after winning the
toss and electing to field at Eden Park. The visitors then
needed 37.3 overs of 50 overs to reach their target.  Steven Finn  took 3-27 as New Zealand was dismissed, with
Brendon McCullum top-scoring for the host with 79. Captain
 Alastair Cook  (46), Eoin Morgan (39), Jonathan Trott (38) and
Joe Root (28 not out) then led the England response.  The teams open a three-match Test series March 6 in
Dunedin. England also won the earlier Twenty20 series 2-1.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
