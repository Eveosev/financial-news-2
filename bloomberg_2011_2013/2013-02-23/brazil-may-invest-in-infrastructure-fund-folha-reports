Brazil â€™s government may invest 15
billion reais ($7.6 billion) into a private-industry fund used
to finance infrastructure projects,  Folha de Sao Paulo  reported,
without saying where it obtained the information.  The banks would loan the money to finance highway, railway,
port and airport investments, the newspaper said. The government
may increase the amount in the fund at a later date, Folha
reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
