North Korean leader Kim Jong Un
visited military units for a third consecutive day amid
escalating tensions with neighboring countries after his
communist nation conducted a nuclear test earlier this month.  Kim oversaw a flight exercise and a paratroop drill
yesterday, the official Korean Central  News Agency  said today.
The news agency reported similar visits by Kim to military units
on Feb. 20 and 21.  “It is necessary to steadily study and round off the
Korean style combat methods” in order to defeat the enemy, Kim
said, according to KCNA. He called on his military forces “to
put spurs to making preparations for going into action, keeping
themselves at maximum alert at all times.”  North Korea  is threatening further actions after it tested
a nuclear weapon on Feb. 12, following the launch of a long-
range rocket that prompted the  United Nations  to tighten
sanctions against the country. U.S. President  Barack Obama  and
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said yesterday they will take
strong actions against North Korea for its provocative behavior.  South Korean President-elect Park Geun Hye said yesterday
that it’s important to end a vicious cycle by sternly punishing
North Korea’s continued reckless provocation. Park will be
inaugurated on Feb. 25.  To contact the reporter on this story:
