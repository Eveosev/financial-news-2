Canada ’s dollar slid versus its U.S.
counterpart for a third week, the longest losing streak since
October, as declines in retail sales and the inflation rate
deepened concern the world’s 11th-largest economy is slowing.  The currency touched its weakest level in almost eight
months amid bets the Bank of Canada will keep interest rates
low. Growth in gross domestic product held at the lowest since
June 2011, data next week may show. Commodities fell as risk
appetite shrank amid concern lawmakers in the U.S., Canada’s
biggest trade partner, will fail to head off $1.2 trillion in
automatic spending cuts set to begin March 1.  “The Canadian economy, based on the data we’ve seen, is in
a vulnerable spot,”  Joe Manimbo , a market analyst at Western
Union Business Solutions, a unit of Western Union Co., said by
phone from  Washington . “If we see this string of downbeat data
continues out of Canada, we may hear eventual talk about a rate
cut from the Bank of Canada.”  The Canadian dollar, nicknamed the loonie for the image of
the aquatic bird on the C$1 coin, depreciated 1.5 percent to
C$1.0215 per U.S. dollar this week in Toronto. It touched
C$1.0256 yesterday, the weakest since June 29. One Canadian
dollar buys 97.90 U.S. cents.  The loonie may be due to strengthen, a technical measure
indicated. Its 14-day relative-strength index against the U.S.
dollar fell to 24 yesterday, its third day below the 30 level
some traders see as a sign an asset has moved too much, too
fast, and may be about to reverse direction.  Sales, Inflation  The currency dropped for a sixth straight day yesterday
against the greenback as Statistics Canada data showed  retail
sales  slid 2.1 percent in December to C$38.6 billion ($37.9
billion). It was the biggest monthly decline since April 2010.  Canada’s  consumer-price  index rose 0.5 percent in January
from a year earlier, the lowest gain since October 2009, the
statistics agency reported yesterday. The gauge increased 0.8
percent in December.  “All in all, it’s two negative reports that will likely
weigh on expectations of the Bank of Canada’s ability to raise
rates,”  Camilla Sutton , head of currency strategy at Bank of
Nova Scotia, said yesterday by telephone from Toronto.  Policy makers have held the benchmark  interest rate  at 1
percent since September 2010 to support the economy. Trading in
overnight index swaps yesterday showed investors priced in six
basis points of easing by the central bank by its December
meeting, data compiled by Bloomberg showed. A week ago, they had
priced in nine basis points of tightening.  Over Time  The central bank said in January an increase may still be
needed over time. Governor Mark Carney reiterated to lawmakers
last week in Ottawa a rate boost is less urgent now than
previously anticipated because the weaker-than-expected economy
is keeping inflation below the bank’s 2 percent target.  Canada’s  gross domestic product  grew 0.6 percent in the
fourth quarter, matching the increase from July through
September, economists in a Bloomberg survey forecast before
Statistics Canada reports the data March 1. It’s the lowest
level since the second quarter of 2011.  “We’re at the point where the good economic stories that
were evident earlier are fading,” David Watt, chief economist
at the Canadian unit of HSBC Holdings Plc, said by phone from
Toronto. “There’s a rather sharp retreat after the upswing in
risk sentiment we’ve had for a while.”  Government  bonds  gained, pushing the yield on benchmark 10-
year debt down seven basis points, or 0.07 percentage point,
this week to 1.94 percent. The price of the 2.75 percent
security due in June 2022 rose 63 cents to C$106.83.  Bond Auctions  The central bank auctioned C$400 million this week of
inflation-indexed bonds due in November 2044, drawing a median
yield of 0.615 percent. A C$700 million offering of the real-
return bonds on Dec. 5 yielded 0.3 percent.  The bank will sell C$3.4 billion of five-year notes on Feb.
27. The 1.25 percent securities will mature in March 2018.  Canada’s dollar has fallen 1.2 percent this year among the
10 developed-nation currencies tracked by the Bloomberg
Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The U.S. dollar rose 1.9 percent.  Futures traders decreased to the lowest level since August
their bets that the Canadian dollar will gain against the U.S.
dollar, figures from the Washington-based Commodity Futures
Trading Commission show.  The difference in the number of wagers by hedge funds and
other large speculators on an advance in the Canadian dollar
compared with those on a drop -- so-called net longs -- was
19,379 on Feb. 19, compared with net longs of 26,565 a week
earlier. They reached 68,668 Jan. 18, the most in 2013.  U.S. Cuts  The loonie fell versus most major peers as risk appetite
shrank amid the looming spending cuts in the U.S. If lawmakers
fail to reach an accord on them, the measures will lower GDP by
0.6 percent and cost 750,000 jobs by year-end, according to the
non-partisan Congressional Budget Office. The reductions, part
of a 2011 deal, were supposed to be so onerous Congress and
President  Barack Obama  would never let them occur.  Standard & Poor’s GSCI Index of 24 raw materials dropped
2.6 percent this week. Futures on crude oil, Canada’s biggest
export, slumped 2.6 percent to $93.36 a barrel in New York and
touched $92.44, the lowest since Jan. 7. Raw materials account
for about half of Canada’s export revenue.  To contact the reporter on this story:
