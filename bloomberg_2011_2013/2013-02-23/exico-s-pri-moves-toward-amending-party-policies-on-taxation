Local representatives from Mexico’s
ruling party have agreed to changes in the Institutional
Revolutionary Party’s bylaws that would allow for taxes on food
and medicine, according to a party official.  State and municipal-level representatives from the party
known as the PRI have approved removing language from policies
that prohibited a value-added tax on these items, Martin
Takagui, a PRI deputy secretary for state relations, said in a
telephone interview from Mexico City. The draft changes will be
presented at the PRI’s national assembly March 1-3 for final
approval, Takagui said.  Mexico President Enrique Pena Nieto, whose election last
year returned the PRI to power, has pledged to increase growth
in Latin America’s second-biggest economy in part by boosting
tax collections. The bylaw changes would open the door to the
party considering tariffs on food and medicine as part of tax
policy proposals, according to Takagui.  Party members at the national assembly will consider the
changes with a simple majority vote needed for approval,
according to Takagui.  To contact the reporter on this story:
