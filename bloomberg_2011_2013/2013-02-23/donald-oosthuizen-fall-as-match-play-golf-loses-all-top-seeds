Luke Donald and  Louis Oosthuizen 
lost in the second round of the Match Play Championship, leaving
the 64-player event without any of its top seeds heading into
this weekend.  The losses yesterday by Donald and Oosthuizen, both of whom
were top-seeded in their 16-player groups, came a day after the
other two No. 1 seeds -- Rory McIlroy and  Tiger Woods  -- lost in
the first round of the World Golf Championships event at The
Golf Club on Dove Mountain in Marana, Arizona.  South African Oosthuizen lost 3 and 2 to ninth-seeded
American  Robert Garrigus , who had eight birdies. Garrigus faces
Fredrik Jacobson of Sweden in today’s third round.  “I felt like I was playing better than anybody coming in
here, so whatever seed it was didn’t matter,” Garrigus told
reporters. “If I’m putting well, I’m going to be hard to
beat.”  England’s Donald lost 7 and 6 to American Scott Piercy, who
won the first three holes and took a four-shot lead with an
eagle from 228 yards on the fifth hole. Donald had a double
bogey on the first hole and never recovered.  To contact the reporter on this story:
