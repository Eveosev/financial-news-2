Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4)  expects to
expand oil production in Nigeria as the Rio de Janeiro-based
company looks to strengthen its presence in  Africa ’s top oil
producer.  “Petrobras has been producing oil in Nigeria for 14 years,
and expects to increase production,” Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff said today during a speech in Abuja, Nigeria’s capital.
“Petrobras expects to establish an ever-stronger presence here
in Nigeria.”  Trade between  Brazil , South America’s biggest economy, and
Nigeria, Africa’s most populous country, is $9 billion a year.
Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan and Rousseff signed an
agreement to boost cooperation on energy, aviation, agriculture,
electricity, infrastructure development and defense.  The two leaders “pledged to work together toward attaining
a more balanced, diverse and mutually beneficial trade
relationship,” according to a joint statement issued after they
held talks today.  -- Editors: John Deane, Kristen Hallam  To contact the reporter on this story:
