(Corrects headline to say PRI.)  Leaders of  Mexico ’s ruling
Institutional Revolutionary Party approved changes to its bylaws
that would allow for taxes on food and medicine, according to  El
Universal newspaper .  The daily said that changes were agreed to by members of
President Enrique Pena Nieto’s party to an internal document
called the Action Program, removing language that prevented the
PRI from considering a value-added tax on those goods.  Tax and energy reforms are “practically approved” by the
party, Cesar Camacho, national head of the PRI, is quoted as
saying in the article.  To contact the reporter on this story:
