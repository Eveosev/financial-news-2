Mohamed ElBaradei , a senior member
of  Egypt ’s opposition, urged supporters to boycott parliamentary
elections set to begin in April, while President Mohamed Mursi
indicated the voting schedule may be changed because it coincides 
with Easter for the minority Coptic Christians.  ElBaradei, a leader in the National Salvation Front
coalition and head of the Constitution Party, made the call 
today via his Twitter account. The Front had earlier threatened 
a boycott unless voting was delayed to allow for tensions to ease,
the economy to recover and the constitution to be amended to 
reverse measures the opposition says were imposed by Islamists.  “Called for parliamentary election boycott in 2010 to
expose sham democracy,” ElBaradei said on Twitter. “Today I 
repeat my call, will not be part of an act of deception.”  Mursi, backed by the  Muslim Brotherhood , has resisted 
demands for a national unity government. Islamist parties 
welcomed Mursi’s decree two days ago to hold a four-stage 
parliamentary election starting April 27 and ending in June,
with the new assembly to gather on July 6. The president, who
faces a rift with some of his Islamist allies, had expressed
hope that the vote would end the unrest and violence that has
spooked investors and damaged the economy since the uprising
that ousted former President  Hosni Mubarak  in February 2011.  Christians welcomed remarks Mursi made today, reported by 
the state-run Middle East  News Agency , that he’s studying a 
change in the election schedule to accommodate the Easter 
holidays.  To contact the reporter on this story:
