Saudi Arabian stocks added 0.1
percent to 7,041.58 by the close in Riyadh today, boosted by
banks and petrochemical companies.  The Tadawul All Share Index reached the highest level since
Feb. 18, with  Al Rajhi Bank (RJHI) , the kingdom’s biggest lender by
market value, gaining 0.7 percent to 68 riyals, the highest gain
in more than a month, and  Bank Al-Jazira (BJAZ)  advancing 4 percent to
28.9 riyals, the biggest gain in six weeks.  Northern Region
Cement Co. (NORTHCEM) , the building material producer, climbed 9.7 percent
to 23.7 riyals, the highest since Feb. 10.  The Saudi stock exchange has been moving in a “horizontal
direction” for several weeks as “there aren’t any substantial
changes in the market,” Turki Fadaak, head of research and
consultancy at Albilad Investment Co., wrote in an e-mail.  “The market is anticipating any signs that indicate an
increase in the demand for petrochemicals globally, which will
reflect on the performance of the petrochemical sector as the
shares have reached the highest prices in three years,” Fadaak
said.  Saudi Arabia ’s stock exchange is the only Persian gulf
bourse open on Saturdays.  To contact the reporter on this story:
