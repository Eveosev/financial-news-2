Industrial & Commercial Bank of
China   Middle East , a regional unit of the world’s largest lender
by market value, said 2012 pretax profit increased 69 percent
because of higher operating and fee income.  Profit for the period surged to $54 million, while
operating income rose 47 percent to $72 million from a year
earlier, the bank said in an e-mailed statement today. Total
assets increased 29 percent to $3.96 billion as of Dec. 31, the
Beijing-based bank said.  “We strengthened our relationships with key government
entities, private institutions and financial institutions across
the region,” Tian Zhiping, chief executive officer of ICBC’s
Middle Eastern business, said in the statement. “We are also
providing  project financing  to the increasing number of Chinese
businesses operating in the Middle East.”  The bank plans to develop  investment banking  and asset
management services in the region and hopes to open branches
this year in Kuwait and the Saudi capital, Riyadh, this year, he
said.  ICBC said its Middle Eastern unit conducted $2.25 billion
of  renminbi  transactions in the interbank money market. Dollar
transactions in the interbank money market for the bank surged
to $11.1 billion last year from $1.35 billion in the earlier
period, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
