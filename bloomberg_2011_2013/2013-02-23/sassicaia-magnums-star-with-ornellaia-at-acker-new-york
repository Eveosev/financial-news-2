Three magnums of pioneering Tuscan
winegrower Sassicaia Tenuta San Guido dating from 1978, 1982 and
1985 are included in an Acker Merrall & Condit  New York  auction
as part of an Italian collection including Ornellaia and Barolo.  The three, listed as a single lot, carry an upper estimate
from Acker of $6,000 and include the first vintage released in
that 1.5-liter format, according to the auction house’s catalog.
A nine-magnum lot of Sassicaia spanning 1988 to 1999 carries a
top price tag of $6,000, while an 11-bottle lot covering the
years from 1980 to 1989 is estimated at as much as $3,500.  The sale comes amid a recovery in fine-wine prices over the
past three months, after the London-based Liv-ex Fine Wine 50
Index touched its lowest level for 32 months in November. It has
rallied 6 percent since then, and in January had its biggest
monthly gain for two years, as investors and collectors sought
wines whose prices were beaten down during the financial crisis.  Other vintages in the auction include a 12-bottle lot of
Sassicaia covering the period 1967 to 1979 and 25 bottles of
neighboring estate Tenuta dell’Ornellaia spanning the years 1985
to 2004, estimated to fetch as much as $4,800. Five bottles of
Monfortino Riserva Giacomo Conterno spanning the years 1961 to
1969 have an upper estimate of $3,500.  Sotheby’s (BID)  also holds an auction in New York today at which
Ornellaia wines from the past two decades and lots from top
Bordeaux vineyard Chateau Petrus are on sale, along with Dom
Perignon Champagne from vintages spanning more than 30 years.  A four-magnum lot of Dom Perignon Rose Oenotheque 1978 is
estimated to fetch as much as $20,000 at the sale, according to
the Sotheby’s catalog. The top estimate for three magnums of the
1966 vintage is $18,000, and $15,000 for four magnums from 1982.
Sotheby’s is also scheduled to hold a sale in London on Feb. 27.  Here is a list of global wine auctions scheduled so far
