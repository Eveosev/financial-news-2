Taiwan’s benchmark 10-year yields
traded at the highest level in more than seven months as
speculation the government will relax restrictions on real
estate purchases by insurers cooled demand for bonds.  The island sold NT$35 billion ($1.2 billion) of 30-year
notes at 1.795 percent yesterday, compared to the 1.75 percent
median estimate of seven fixed-income traders surveyed by
Bloomberg. The Financial Supervisory Commission will lift a ban
on insurance companies buying real estate, the Economic Daily
News reported on Feb. 21, citing minister Chen Yuh-chang.  “Investors are demanding higher yields for the new
issuances,” said George Pu, a bond trader at Sinopac Securities
Corp. in Taipei. “Ten-year yields have room to rise even
more.”  The  yield  on the 1.125 percent bonds due March 2023 rose to
1.225 percent from 1.223 percent as of 9:33 a.m. local time, the
highest level since July 4, according to Gretai Securities
Market. It increased one basis point from Feb. 6.  Taiwan’s stock and debt markets were closed from Feb. 7
through Feb. 15 for the Lunar New Year holiday and were open
today to partly compensate for the loss of working days.  The  Taiwan dollar  strengthened 0.2 percent to NT$29.609
against its U.S. counterpart, according to prices from Taipei
Forex Inc. It gained 0.5 percent this week.  The central bank has sold the local currency near the close
on most days in the past 11 months, according to traders who
asked not to be identified.  The  overnight interbank lending rate  was steady at 0.388
percent, a weighted average compiled by the Taiwan Interbank
Money Center showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
