Italian health officials said a type
of lasagna frozen-food product tested positive for horse DNA,
the first such case in the country.  The product being sold in a supermarket in the northern
city of Brescia wasn’t properly identified as horsemeat on its
label, according to an e-mailed statement from the Italian
Health Ministry. The “Lasagna alla Bolognese,” made by a
company in Bologna, has been removed from store shelves, the
ministry said.  Health officials have seized 6 tons of ground meat labeled
as beef and 2,400 packages of the lasagna product, according to
the statement. The ministry said authorities are continuing to
conduct checks throughout  Italy . Earlier today, the ministry
said all samples of a  Nestle SA (NESN)  frozen-food product in Italy
were negative for horse DNA.  Nestle, the world’s biggest food company, said Feb. 18 that
it’s withdrawing some beef ravioli and beef tortellini products
and halted deliveries after traces of horse DNA were found in
food made with meat from a German supplier.  A frozen lasagna produced in  France  for the catering
industry was also withdrawn, the Vevey, Switzerland-based
company said in the Feb. 18 statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
