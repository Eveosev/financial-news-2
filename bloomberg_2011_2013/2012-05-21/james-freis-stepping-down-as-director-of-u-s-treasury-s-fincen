James Freis, director of the U.S.’s
Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, is stepping down after
more than five years in the job.  David Cohen , the Treasury’s undersecretary for terrorism
and financial intelligence, said in a letter to staff obtained
by Bloomberg News that he asked Freis to stay on until a
successor is named.  FinCEN spokesman Steve Hudak referred questions to the
Treasury.  John Sullivan , a Treasury spokesman, declined to
comment.  FinCEN, which maintains financial transactions data and
analyzes information for law-enforcement purposes, is a bureau
of the Treasury. FinCEN’s director is appointed by the Treasury
secretary and reports to the undersecretary for terrorism and
financial intelligence.  To contact the reporters on this story:
