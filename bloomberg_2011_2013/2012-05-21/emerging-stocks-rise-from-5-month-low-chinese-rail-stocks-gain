Sentiment among investors in
emerging-market equities has reached “panic” levels after a 15
percent price drop in three months, although this is a sign
stocks may rise in the next six months, Citigroup Inc. said.  Emerging-market stocks have advanced an average 7.5 percent
in six months and 23 percent in a year on past occasions when
Citigroup’s “Whether Vane” has been at such levels, New-York-
based analysts Geoffrey Dennis, Howard Park and Christina Wood
wrote in an e-mailed note to clients dated yesterday.  The “Whether Vane” measures the VIX Index of volatility
as well as the ratio of put options to call options and
commodity prices, they said.  Citigroup lowered its recommendation on the MSCI  Emerging
Markets  Index to neutral in a May 18 report, saying the gauge is
no longer likely to outperform global equities amid concerns
about the European debt turmoil.  The developing-nations gauge has fallen 15 percent from its
year-high on March 2.  To contact the reporter on this story:
