Alvarion Ltd. (ALVR)  gained the most in a
month in  New York  trading after the Israeli developer of
wireless access solutions announced a “multi-million dollar”
project in the Philippines.  Shares of Tel Aviv-based Alvarion rallied 8.7 percent to 50
cents a share at the close in New York, the biggest climb since
April 20. The company’s  Tel Aviv stock  rose 6.3 percent to 1.92
shekels, or the equivalent of 50 cents.  Alvarion will provide Wi-Fi access with the Philippine Long
Distance Telephone Company, according to a PRNewswire statement
distributed today. The project is expected to be completed in
two years and will generate at least between $2 million and $3
million in an initial phase, Lior Shemesh, chief financial
officer of the company, said by phone from  Tel Aviv  today.  “This is important because it will help us make sure that
we break even in the third and fourth quarters this year,”
Shemesh said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
