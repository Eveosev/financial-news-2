Iraq  plans to spend $9.8 billion on
roads, bridges and housing through 2016 as the war-torn
country’s budget doubles on higher oil production, according to
the construction and housing minister.  The current annual budget is $112 billion, of which the
 energy industry  consumes 40 percent, Mohammad Saheb al-Darraji
said in an interview in Abu Dhabi today. The country is
budgeting $5.8 billion on roads and bridges and $4 billion on
housing, he said.  Iraq is pumping oil, its biggest foreign-currency
generator, at the highest rate since  Saddam Hussein  seized power
in 1979 as it seeks to increase income for reconstruction. Oil
production will reach about 6 million barrels a day by 2016, al-
Darraji said. The country produced 3.03 million barrels a day in
April, according to an OPEC monthly report on May 10.  The country needs 2.5 million homes in the next four or
five years, although budgetary constraints may make that target
difficult to achieve, al-Darraji said. A $250 million housing
project tender to build 3,000 mid-income homes in Basra will
close in two weeks, he said.  A $7 billion contract with  South Korea ’s Hanwha Engineering
& Construction Corp. to build 100,000 housing units over the
next 7 years has been finalized, al-Darraji said.  The government is also considering Poly Technologies Inc.
as a candidate to build a highway that will link the country to
Turkey.  “We are in discussions with them,” al-Darraji said.
“They are offering financing,” for the project.  With assistance from Ayesha Daya in Dubai. --Editors: Tim
