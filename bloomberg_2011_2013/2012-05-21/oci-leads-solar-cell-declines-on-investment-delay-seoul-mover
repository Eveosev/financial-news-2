OCI Co. (010060)  led declines among South
Korean solar-cell companies following the polysilicon maker’s
announcement that it will delay expansion plans.  OCI,  South Korea ’s biggest maker of polysilicon, the raw
material used to make most solar panels, fell 4.4 percent on the
Korea Exchange to 194,000 won today, the lowest close since Oct.
6. South Korea’s benchmark Kospi index gained 0.9 percent.  Seoul-based OCI announced on May 18 after the stock market
closed that it scrapped plans to build two polysilicon factories
at home because  Europe ’s worsening fiscal crisis is affecting
the volatility of the solar-power industry. An update on its
investment position will be given within a year, OCI said.  The announcement may slow OCI’s efforts to cut expenses
because the new plants are designed to be more cost effective,
Nomura analysts, including CW Chung, said in a research note.
Nomura has a “reduce” recommendation on OCI.  The  price  of polysilicon dropped 2.6 percent in the week
ended May 7, adding to almost three months of continuous
declines, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance.  Nexolon, South Korea’s biggest maker of silicon ingots and
wafers used in solar cells, fell 3.4 percent to 3,670 won, the
lowest close since Dec. 28. SKC Solmics Co., a producer of
semiconductor machinery parts made from silicon materials,
declined 6.8 percent to 4,410 won.  Woongjin Energy Co. (103130) , which
makes silicon ingots and wafers, dropped 6 percent to 5,170 won.  To contact the reporter on this story:
