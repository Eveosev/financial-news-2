German  Chancellor Angela Merkel  said
she won’t shy away from clashing with French President Francois Hollande at a European Union summit on May 23 that’s the next
attempt to stem the debt crisis.  “There is the continuity of good cooperation,” Merkel
told reporters in Chicago today after she and Hollande attended
the Group of Eight and NATO summits in the U.S. “That doesn’t
exclude differing positions. These may very well arise in the
context of the European discussions.”  Hollande intends to discuss joint euro-area bonds at the
summit in Brussels, where “everything will be on the table,”
French Finance Minister  Pierre Moscovici  said in Berlin today.
Merkel opposes joint debt issuance, saying the differences in
bond yields between euro countries are incentives for weaker
nations to overhaul their economies and boost competitiveness.  With Greece at risk of leaving the euro area and ways to
spur economic growth on the EU’s agenda, Merkel and Hollande
must build a working relationship, after the French Socialist
won elections on a campaign pledge to blunt the German-led
austerity drive for  Europe . Merkel didn’t specify on which
points there might be conflict at the EU summit.  “The point is to find sensible solutions,” she said.
“That’s how I work and that’s also the feeling I got from the
French president.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
