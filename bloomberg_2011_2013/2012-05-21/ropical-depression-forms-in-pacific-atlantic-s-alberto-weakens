Tropical Storm Alberto churned off
the Florida-Georgia coast with 40 mile-an-hour (64 kilometer-an-
hour) winds on a course expected to keep it away from land and
safely at sea, the National Hurricane Center said.  A tropical depression, the second in a week, about 520
miles south of Acapulco far off the Mexico-Guatemala coast is
moving westward at 6 miles an hour and is expected to intensify
from 35 mph winds to tropical-storm status later in the day, the
NHC said in a website advisory.  To contact the reporter on this story:
