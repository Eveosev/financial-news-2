Shares in Poland’s two biggest banks
rose after the head of the country’s financial market regulator,
Andrzej Jakubiak, said he sees no risks to local lenders from
Greece’s potential withdrawal from the euro.  PKO Bank Polski SA (PKO) , the country’s biggest lender controlled
by the government, jumped 2.1 percent to 31.68 zloty and  Bank
Pekao SA (PEO) , the Polish unit of UniCredit SpA, climbed 2 percent to
135.6 zloty, rising for the first time in three days at 10:21
a.m. in Warsaw. The benchmark WIG20 Index increased 1.5 percent
to 2,092.81.  Polish banks have ample capital reserves, Jakubiak said in
an interview with Rzeczpospolita, published on the newspaper’s
website Rp.pl today. The country’s lenders, which jointly have
150 billion zloty ($44 billion) of financing from their foreign
owners, should switch to longer-term funding sources, he said.  “I don’t see any special threats for the Polish financial
industry” from  Greece , Jakubiak was quoted as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
