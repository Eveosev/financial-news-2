The  yuan  halted a three-day decline
as the central bank strengthened the currency’s daily  reference
rate  and Premier  Wen Jiabao  pledged to bolster economic growth.  The People’s Bank of China raised the  reference rate  by
0.15 percent, the most since May 2, to 6.3116 per dollar. The
government will give “more priority to maintaining growth,”
while it continues to implement “a proactive fiscal policy and
a prudent monetary policy,” the official news agency Xinhua
reported yesterday, citing Premier Wen.  “Wen’s comments provide hope to investors that the economy
will rebound in the third quarter with government stimulus,”
said Banny Lam, a Hong Kong-based economist at CCB International
Securities Ltd., a unit of  China ’s second-largest bank.  The yuan rose 0.01 percent to close at 6.3279 per dollar in
Shanghai, according to the China Foreign Exchange Trade System.
It gained as much as 0.15 percent, the most since April 17, to
6.3187 earlier. The currency is allowed to trade as much as 1
percent on either side of the daily fixing. One-month implied
volatility, a measure of exchange-rate swings used to price
options, was unchanged at 2.2 percent.  In Hong Kong’s offshore market, the yuan strengthened 0.02
percent to 6.3255. Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards gained
0.03 percent to 6.3885, at 0.95 percent discount to the spot
rate in Shanghai, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  China will work to speed up approvals of qualified foreign
institutional investors looking to buy its domestic securities,
according to a statement posted on the State Administration of
Foreign Exchange yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
