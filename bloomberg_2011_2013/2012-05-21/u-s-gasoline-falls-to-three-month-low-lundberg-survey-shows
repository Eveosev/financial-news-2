The average price for regular
gasoline at U.S. filling stations fell to the lowest in almost
three months, according to  Lundberg Survey Inc.   The price declined to $3.7833 a gallon in the two weeks
through May 18, the lowest since the period ended Feb. 24,
according to data from about 2,500 stations surveyed by the
Camarillo, California-based company. The price is down 6.19
cents in the past two weeks and is 12.41 cents lower than a year
earlier, when the average was $3.9074. Prices peaked this year
at $3.9671 during the two weeks ended April 6.  “The falling crude-oil price has allowed this slide in the
gasoline price,”  Trilby Lundberg , president of Lundberg Survey,
said yesterday in a telephone interview. “The weakness in the
U.S. and European economies discourages the crude-oil price. We
can expect another decline as the most probable direction.”  Prices at the pump fell as West Texas Intermediate crude
for June delivery on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  slid
$7.01, or 7.1 percent, to $91.48 a barrel in the two weeks ended
May 18. Futures are at the lowest level since Oct. 26 and have
declined 17 percent since reaching a year-to-date high of
$109.77 on Feb. 24.  Gasoline futures for June delivery on the Nymex sank 8.63
cents, or 2.9 percent, during the period to $2.8895. Gasoline
has lost 15 percent since reaching a 2012 high of $3.4166 on
March 26. Futures are up 7.6 percent this year.  Growth Outlook  Futures have fallen on concern that the  European debt
crisis  is worsening and on signs economic growth in the U.S. and
China is slowing, threatening to curb fuel demand.  European Union Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner
 Olli Rehn  warned  Greece  on May 18 that the EU would continue to
demand budget discipline after a June 17 election that could
increase the risk of the nation’s exit from the euro monetary
system.  Rehn said Greece must stick to a spending-cut agreement
that Syriza, a Greek party that came in second in an
inconclusive election on May 6, wants to renegotiate. Syriza
forced the new vote by refusing to help form a unity government.  Industrial production in the 17-nation euro area slipped
0.3 percent in March from February, when it advanced 0.8
percent, according to data from the European Union’s statistics
office in Luxembourg. In  China , factory  production  grew 9.3
percent in April, the smallest increase since 2009.  Oil Decline  The index of U.S. leading indicators unexpectedly fell in
April, indicating the pace of economic expansion may slow. The
Conference Board’s gauge of the outlook for the next three to
six months decreased 0.1 percent after a 0.3 percent gain in
March, the New York-based group said on May 17.  Oil may decline further this week on concern that the
reversal of the Seaway pipeline won’t be enough to alleviate a
record supply glut in the central U.S., a Bloomberg survey
showed.  Nineteen of 34 analysts, or 56 percent, forecast oil will
drop through May 25. Nine respondents, or 26 percent, predicted
prices will rise and six estimated they will be little changed.
Last week, 48 percent of surveyed analysts expected a decrease.  Enbridge Inc. and  Enterprise Products Partners LP (EPD)  completed
the pipeline reversal on May 18 and began accepting shipments of
oil May 19 from Cushing, Oklahoma, the delivery point for WTI,
to the  Gulf Coast . U.S. oil inventories rose to a 22-year high
and Cushing  stockpiles  reached a record in the week ended May 11
as domestic output increased, according to the Energy
Department.  On  Long Island , regular gasoline fell to $3.94 a gallon,
according to Lundberg. Los Angeles-area retail stations averaged
$4.35.  The highest price in the lower 48 U.S. states among the
cities surveyed was in  San Francisco , where the average was
$4.36 a gallon, Lundberg said. The lowest price was in  Memphis ,
 Tennessee , where customers paid an average of $3.34 a gallon.  To contact the reporters on this story:
