Rafael Nadal  beat Novak Djokovic in
the final of the Rome Masters and moved back to No. 2 in the
world tennis rankings.  Nadal beat top-ranked Djokovic 7-5, 6-3 at Rome’s Foro
Italico in a final that had been delayed by a day because of
rain. It was the Spaniard’s 21st Masters title, a record.  It’s Nadal’s sixth Rome title and his second defeat of the
Serb on clay this season. The Spaniard, seeking a record-
breaking seventh French Open men’s crown in the tournament
starting next week, beat Djokovic in the Monte Carlo final in
April. That ended a seven-match losing streak against him.  Nadal will now move ahead of  Roger Federer  of Switzerland
in the rankings of the ATP World Tour, meaning he won’t play
Djokovic before the final at Roland Garros. Djokovic is trying
to win four majors in a row at the French Open, where he’s never
made the championship match.  To contact the reporter on this story:
