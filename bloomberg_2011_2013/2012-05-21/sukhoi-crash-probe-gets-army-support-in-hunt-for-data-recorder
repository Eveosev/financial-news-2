Indonesian salvage crews sifting
through the wreckage of the Russian Sukhoi SuperJet in the
thicket of West Java have enlisted the help of the army and
special forces as the hunt continues for the data recorder.  The country had dispatched 600 search and rescue experts to
the site following the crash on May 9 that killed all 45 people
on board, and the effort is now being handed off to military
forces trained in salvaging equipment. Russian support personnel
deployed to  Indonesia  have started winding down their effort,
according to the Russian Emergency Ministry.  Search crews are focused on finding the container housing
the data recorder that stores systems and engine performance to
help determine the cause of the crash. The Sukhoi jet was on a
promotional trip through  Asia , and the aircraft that crashed had
been switched halfway through the tour after an issue on an
engine component on a flight from  Kazakhstan  to  Pakistan .  “We haven’t stopped the search,” said Gagah Prakosa, a
spokesman at Indonesia’s National Search and Rescue Agency.  Olga Kayukova, a spokeswoman for Sukhoi parent company
United Aircraft Corp., said she had no immediate information on
how long it would take to analyze the contents of the cockpit
voice recorder. The voice recorder captures sounds including
conversations and alarms heard in the pilot cabin  The plane, which seats five abreast, uses engines built by
PowerJet, a venture between Snecma, a unit of  Safran SA (SAF) , and NPO
Saturn. The aircraft had been on its second flight of the day,
carrying prospective customers and local journalists, when it
disappeared from radar screens shortly into its voyage.  To contact the reporters on this story:
