A former  Los Angeles  appraiser was
charged with lowering the property values of wealthy home and
business owners by $172 million in return for campaign
contributions to County Assessor John Noguez.  Scott Schenter, 49, was arrested today in Beaverton,
 Oregon , and is being held on $1.5 million bail, Los Angeles
County District Attorney Steve Cooley said in a statement. The
arrest is part of an investigation into allegations that Noguez
cut property values of wealthy clients of a tax consultant and
campaign contributor, Cooley said.  “The magnitude of Schenter’s suspected betrayal of public
trust is almost inconceivable,” Cooley said. “We believe his
actions are not isolated.”  Schenter, who was an appraiser from 1988 to early last
year, is accused of lowering the values of multimillion-dollar
homes and businesses in  Beverly Hills , Brentwood and Pacific
Palisades. The unauthorized reductions were discovered by a
supervisor in January of last year, according to the prosecutor.  The former appraiser faces 30 counts of falsifying accounts
and 30 counts of falsifying records. If convicted, he faces as
long as 33 years in state prison, Cooley said.  Noguez didn’t immediately respond to an e-mailed request
for comment on Schenter’s arrest.  The name of a lawyer for Schenter wasn’t immediately
available from the district attorney’s office.  The case is People v. Schenter, BA397710, Los Angeles
County Superior Court.  To contact the reporter on this story:
