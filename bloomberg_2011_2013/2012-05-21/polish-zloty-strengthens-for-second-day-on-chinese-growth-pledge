The Polish zloty strengthened for a
second day against the euro after  China â€™s pledge to boost growth
offset concern over the future of the euro area, increasing
investor demand for assets regarded as riskier.  The zloty appreciated 0.3 percent to 4.3328 per euro as of
9:55 a.m. in Warsaw, adding to a 0.1 percent gain in the
previous session.  To contact the reporter on this story:
