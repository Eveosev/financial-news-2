Asian  stocks  rose, with the regional
index rebounding from its biggest drop in six months, after
Premier Wen Jiabao said  China  will focus more on bolstering
economic growth.  China Overseas Land & Investment Ltd., a developer
controlled by the nation’s construction ministry, rose 1.8
percent in  Hong Kong .  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP)  advanced 2 percent in
Sydney after  RBC Capital Markets  said the world’s largest mining
company may buyback shares. Nintendo Co., a manufacturer of
gaming consoles that gets a third of its sales in Europe, fell
1.4 percent in Osaka. OCI Co., a chemicals maker, slumped 4.4
percent in Seoul after delaying expansion plans because of
Europe’s debt crisis.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  rose 0.2 percent to 112.78 as
of 7:30 p.m. in Tokyo. The gauge fell 2.5 percent on May 18, the
most since Nov. 10, wiping out this year’s gains as Europe’s
crisis worsened and U.S. economic data missed estimates.  Wen’s pledge on Chinese growth “will be a support for the
market when we see clear signs of it,” said Shintaro Takeuchi,
portfolio investment group manager at Tokio Marine & Nichido
Fire Insurance Co. that manages $109 billion in assets. “Stocks
are becoming cheaper and fewer people are selling them, but
they’re not cheap enough to buy either.”  Gains were limited before German and French leaders meet
today to discuss the euro after the Group of Eight nations
exposed disagreement on a rescue strategy.  Yearly Drop  The  Asian gauge  dropped 1.1 percent this year through last
week compared with a 3 percent gain by the  Standard & Poor’s 500
Index (SPXL1)  and a 2.3 percent loss by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.
Stocks in the Asian benchmark are valued at 11.5 times estimated
earnings on average, compared with 12.3 times for the  S&P 500 
and 10 times for the Stoxx 600.  Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average climbed 0.3 percent today
before the  Bank of Japan  begins a two-day meeting tomorrow. The
broader Topix Index slid 0.1 percent after a drop last week that
capped the longest streak of weekly losses since the Sept. 11
terrorist attacks in 2001.  Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index increased 0.7 percent, its
first increase in five days, while South Korea’s Kospi Index
rose 0.9 percent.  Hong Kong’s  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  declined 0.2 percent. The  Hang
Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  of Hong Kong-listed Chinese
companies advanced 0.1 percent, after last week falling as much
as 21 percent from its high for the year on Feb. 29. China’s
Shanghai Composite Index gained 0.2 percent.  Wen said China will focus more on bolstering economic
growth, indicating policies may be loosened further as inflation
moderates.  China Investment  “We should continue to implement a proactive fiscal policy
and a prudent monetary policy, while giving more priority to
maintaining growth,” Wen said during a tour of Wuhan, the
capital of China’s Hubei province, from Friday to Sunday.  China’s foreign-exchange regulator has approved $26 billion
in quotas for 138 qualified investors looking to buy into its
domestic securities as of May 16, according to a statement
posted on the State Administration of Foreign Exchange yesterday.  China Overseas Land rose 1.8 percent to HK$15.06 in Hong
Kong.  CSR Corp. (1766) , a Chinese train maker, jumped 6.8 percent to
HK$5.79, leading its peers higher after the 21st Century
Business Herald reported the railway ministry has been granted a
credit line of more than 2 trillion  yuan  ($316 billion),
signaling transport projects may resume.  U.S. Futures Rise  Fanuc Corp. (6954) , a maker of industrial robots that gets almost
half its revenue from Asia outside Japan, rose 1.5 percent to
13,050 yen in Tokyo. The company will expand its production
capacity for equipment to control machine tools by 30 percent,
the Nikkei newspaper reported, without saying where it got the
information.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index gained 0.6
percent today after the index slid 0.7 percent in  New York  on
May 18.  Leaders of G-8 nations who met at Camp David over the
weekend pushed for Greece to stay in the euro area and supported
boosting growth, even as Germany said Europe can’t spend its way
out of the debt crisis. They concurred at U.S. President Barack
Obama’s retreat outside Washington “that the right measures are
not the same for each of us.”  German Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  will for the
first time discuss the 17-nation currency at a meeting with his
newly installed French counterpart, Pierre Moscovici, in Berlin
today as European Union leaders prepare for a summit meeting in
Brussels on May 23.  BHP Buyback  Nintendo slid 1.4 percent to 9,230 yen in Osaka, while  HSBC
Holdings Plc (5) , Europe’s largest bank by market value, declined 1
percent to HK$63.10 in Hong Kong.  BHP rose 2 percent to A$32.10 in Sydney, the  second-biggest 
contributor to the MSCI Asia Pacific Index’s advance. The miner

billion spending plan over five years, RBC Capital Markets said

much as 2.15 percent of its outstanding stock.  Renesas Electronics Corp. (6723) , a maker of microcontrollers used
in cars, slumped 10 percent to 269 yen, its lowest close on
record, after Goldman Sachs Group Inc. lowered its rating on the
stock, citing a slow earnings recovery.  OCI slumped 4.4 percent to 194,000 won after the Seoul-
based solar-cell company announced it is scrapping plans to
build two polysilicon factories at home because  Europe ’s
worsening fiscal crisis is affecting the volatility of the
solar-power industry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
