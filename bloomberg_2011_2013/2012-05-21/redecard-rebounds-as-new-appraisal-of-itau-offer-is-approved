Redecard SA (RDCD3) , Brazil’s second-largest
card-payment processor, rebounded from its biggest drop in a
year after shareholders voted to get another appraisal of  Itau
Unibanco Holding SA (ITUB4) ’s 11.8 billion-real ($5.8 billion) bid for
the company.  Redecard advanced 1.8 percent to 30.60 reais at the close
of trading in  Sao Paulo , reversing an earlier decline of as much
as 2.3 percent. The benchmark Bovespa index rose 3.8 percent.  The card-payment processor’s shares sank 6.4 percent on May
18 as 57 percent of its minority investors backed Lazard Asset
Management LLC’s proposal to hire  Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN)  to
evaluate the offering, according to a regulatory filing. Itau
offered 35 reais a share on Feb. 7 to take full ownership of
Redecard and delist it less than five years after going public.  “We view further delays in the transaction as negative for
Redecard, as it creates further distractions to management, and
could imply further loss of market share in the following
quarters,”  Mario Pierry , an equity analyst at Deutsche Bank AG,
wrote in a report to clients today. “Furthermore, if the deal
does not go through, we see significant downside risk to
Redecard’s earnings, given the misalignment of interest between
Redecard and its controlling shareholder.”  Credit Suisse has 30 days to prepare the second appraisal,
according to the regulatory filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
