Old Republic International Corp. (ORI) , the
insurer that stopped backing home loans after capital ran short
at the business, said it sold 20.6 percent of the Republic
Financial Indemnity Group unit to investors in a partial
leveraged buyout.  The deal is tied to a plan to spin off stock in the unit to
Old Republic shareholders, the Chicago-based insurer said today
in a statement distributed by PR Newswire.  To contact the reporter on this story:
