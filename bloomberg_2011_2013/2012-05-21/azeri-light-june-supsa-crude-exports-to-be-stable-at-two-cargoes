Exports of Azeri Light crude from
Georgiaâ€™s Black Sea port of Supsa in June will be unchanged at
two cargoes, according to a loading schedule obtained by
Bloomberg News.  Each shipment is for 600,000 barrels, the plan showed.  BP Plc (BP/)  operates the Baku-Supsa pipeline, which carries
Azeri Light from the  Caspian Sea  to the Black Sea. Loading
programs are monthly schedules of crude shipments compiled by
field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan their supply
and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
