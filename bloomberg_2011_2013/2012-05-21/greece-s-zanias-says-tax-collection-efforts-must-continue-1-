Greece ’s caretaker government will
step up attempts to curb  tax evasion  and meet revenue targets,
Finance Minister Giorgios Zanias said.  “It is a national duty to pay taxes,” Zanias told
reporters today after a visit to the offices of the financial
crimes squad in Athens. Greece can’t allow any relaxation of
tax-collection efforts during the country’s pre-election period,
a time when revenue traditionally drops, he said.  Greece has a caretaker government in place as it heads to a
repeat election on June 17 after a May 6 poll failed to produce
a viable government amid gains for parties that oppose the terms
of the country’s bailouts from the European Union and the
 International Monetary Fund . Under the program, Greece has to
reduce its  budget deficit  to 7.3 percent of gross domestic
product this year from 9.3 percent in 2011, and cut its primary
deficit, which excludes interest payments, to 1 percent from 2.4
percent.  Public revenue dropped 15 percent in the first 10 days of
May compared with the same period of 2011, Kathimerini reported
on May 18, without saying how it got the information. The
Finance Ministry forecasts that with no improvement in
collection, revenue for the month will be down 50 percent
compared with May 2011, the Athens-based newspaper reported.  Zanias said today he would consult with the heads of other
agencies involved in revenue and tax collection to keep up the
effort.  To contact the reporter on this story:
