Drake & Scull International PJSC (DSI)  is
“about to take its first job” in Iraq, the company’s chief
executive officer said.  The company is part of a group in final negotiations over
the construction of a pipeline in Basra and expects to hear in
about 30 days, Khaldoun Tabari told a conference in Abu Dhabi
today. The contract would be worth about $300 million in revenue
for the company.  Profit at the Dubai-based construction company will be
better in the second-quarter, he said. Net income fell to 37.6
million dirhams ($10.2 million) in the first quarter from 45.9
million dirhams a year earlier amid increased expenses, the
company said on May 15.  To contact the reporter on this story:
