Thermal-coal buyers in  China  are
negotiating to defer imports amid a surge in stockpiles,
according to three Indonesian sellers of the fuel.  Traders are asking to delay shipments of Indonesian power-
station coal for as many as two weeks as stockpiles in China’s
main ports are sufficient, said two of the people who declined
to be identified because the information is confidential. One
buyer asked to reschedule a 50,000-ton cargo for June delivery,
according to one of the people.  The Financial Times reported today that buyers of  iron ore 
and thermal coal are asking traders to delay shipments with some
defaulting on their contracts, citing unidentified traders.  Chinese thermal coal at the nation’s biggest port for
delivering the fuel fell for a second week as stockpiles rose at
the fastest pace in six months.  Coal inventories at Qinhuangdao, which delivers half the
nation’s seaborne supplies, rose 13 percent to 6.46 million tons
yesterday from a week earlier, according to the China Coal
Transport and Distribution Association. That’s the biggest
percentage increase since Nov. 20, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Coal with a benchmark energy value of 5,500 kilocalories
per kilogram at Qinhuangdao slid 0.6 percent to a range of 770
 yuan  ($122) to 780 yuan a ton, according to data from the
association.  To contact the reporter on this story:
