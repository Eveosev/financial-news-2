China  has 260 million patients with
chronic diseases, which cause about 85 percent of the nation’s
total deaths, the  Ministry of Health  said.  Major chronic ailments include cardiovascular diseases,
diabetes, virulent tumors and respiratory diseases, the ministry
said today in a statement giving its 2012-2015 plan for
prevention and control.  China aims to reduce the adult smoking rate to less than 25
percent and encourage citizens to engage in “constant”
physical exercise, the ministry said.  The central government also encourages private investment
in nonprofit medical institutions, the ministry said in a
 separate statement .  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
