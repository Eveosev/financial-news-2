(Corrects to show that HSBC made a recommendation rather
than a trade in the headline and second paragraph of story
published on May 17.)  HSBC Holdings Plc ended its short
long dollar, long lira trade recommendation as  Greece ’s
political and debt crisis deepened, the lender said.  The bank opened a short dollar versus long lira
recommendation at 1.81 with a target of 1.74 on March 22, Murat Toprak, London-based head of the bank’s currency strategy for
 Europe ,  Middle East  and  Africa , said in an e-mailed note dated
May 16. The lender closed the recommendation at 1.83 for a
nominal loss of 1.1 percent.  The Turkish currency lost 1.9 percent against the dollar
over the past five days as Greece heads toward national
elections after the inconclusive May 6 polls pushed a political
party opposed to Greece’s international bailout into second
place, raising the specter of Greece exiting the euro.  “The trade has initially performed well, approaching the
target,” Toprak wrote. “However, we have decided to exit the
trade as the Greek crisis has changed the panorama.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
