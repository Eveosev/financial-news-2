Shares of  Glencore International Plc (GLEN) ,
the world’s largest publicly traded commodities supplier, may
gain as its  weighting  in FTSE and  MSCI Inc. (MSCI)  indexes is adjusted
in the coming months, BMO Capital Markets said.  A further 2.7 billion Glencore  shares  will become eligible
for trading starting May 25 as employee lock-ups relating to
last year’s initial public offering lapse,  Tony Robson , a
Toronto-based analyst at BMO, said in a May 18 report.  The resulting jump in the Glencore free-float to about 57
percent from 17 percent may spur buying from so-called index
tracker funds, he said. The next FTSE re-weighting is likely to
occur on June 18 while the MSCI is expected to re-balance on
Sept. 1, BMO said.  “With more than 200 million shares likely to be bought by
tracker funds, there could be a share squeeze if employee
shareholders hold on to their stock,” Robson said. “In
situations where there is a healthy increase in demand, a ‘bump’
in share price is possible, however, this depends entirely on
the inclination of unlocked shareholders to sell.”  Glencore  advanced  1.8 percent to close at 351.5 pence in
 London . The stock has declined 34 percent since Glencore sold
$10 billion in shares at 530 pence apiece in an IPO a year ago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
