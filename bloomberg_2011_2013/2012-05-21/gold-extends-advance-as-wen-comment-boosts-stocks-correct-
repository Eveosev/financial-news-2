(Corrects to platinum from gold in penultimate paragraph.)  Gold climbed for a third day, gaining
alongside equities and other commodities, before German and
French leaders meet today to discuss the euro and as  China  said
it will focus on aiding growth. Platinum and palladium gained.  Spot gold rose as much as 0.3 percent to $1,598.25 an
ounce, the highest price since May 10, and was at $1,596.25 at
11 a.m. in Singapore. Bullion last week rebounded after a 21
percent drop from an intraday record in September. The metal
ended the week up 0.9 percent, the first weekly advance in
three.  Gold dropped to $1,526.97 an ounce on May 16, the cheapest
this year, as speculation that  Greece  may have to leave the
currency bloc wiped almost $4 trillion from global stock markets
this month. German and French leaders will meet before a
European Union summit May 23 to map a revised plan to resolve
the debt crisis, after leaders of the Group of Eight nations
failed to deliver a unified strategy at their May 18-19 meeting.  “Gold had a really nice rally following a very steep drop,
so we might get some consolidation from here as the market
prepares to take on $1,600,” said Feng Liang, an analyst at GF
Futures Co., a unit of China’s second-largest listed brokerage.
“It’s too soon to say if the dollar link has been broken.”
Gold tends to trade inversely to the U.S. currency.  China Growth  June-delivery bullion gained 0.3 percent to $1,596 on the
Comex in  New York , after climbing 0.4 percent earlier. Holdings
in exchange-traded products rose to a three-week high of
2,383.677 metric tons on May 18. The dollar declined against
most of its major counterparts as Asian stocks, oil and copper
advanced after China’s Premier  Wen Jiabao  said the country will
focus more on bolstering growth, signaling further loosening.  Cash platinum, the year’s best-performing precious metal,
gained for a third day, adding as much as 0.9 percent to a one-
week high of $1,468.13 an ounce. It was last at $1,463. One
ounce of platinum bought 0.9178 ounce of gold today after the
so-called ratio dropped to 0.9132 on May 18.  Spot palladium, this year’s worst-performing precious
metal, climbed as much as 1.2 percent to $611.50 an ounce and
was last at $610. Silver fell for the first time in three days,
dropping 0.2 percent to $28.6825 an ounce.  To contact the reporter on this story:
