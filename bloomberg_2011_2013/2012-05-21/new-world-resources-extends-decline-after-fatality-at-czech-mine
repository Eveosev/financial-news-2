New World Resources Plc (NWR)  extended its
drop after the biggest Czech coking-coal producer said today one

 Prague , the seventh day of declines and its lowest price since
July 2009. The drop made NWR the worst performer in the PX index
of 14 companies, which advanced 0.2 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
