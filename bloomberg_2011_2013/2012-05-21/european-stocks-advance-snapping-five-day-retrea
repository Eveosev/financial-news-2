European stocks climbed, after last
week’s biggest selloff for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index since
September, as  China ’s pledge to boost growth helped offset
concern over the future of the euro area.  The Stoxx 600 gained 0.3 percent to 239.53 at 8:44 a.m. in
London, recouping some of last week’s 5.2 percent selloff. The
gauge earlier fell as much as 0.6 percent. Contracts on the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 0.7 percent today and the MSCI
Asia Pacific Index gained 0.2 percent.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
