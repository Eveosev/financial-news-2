British Land Co. (BLND) , the U.K.’s second-
largest real estate investment trust, said net asset value was
little changed in the quarter through March as gains on office
developments were matched by a drop for retail properties.  Net asset value  rose to 595 pence a share in the company’s
fiscal fourth quarter from 593 pence three months earlier, the
London-based company said in a statement today. Net income for
the 12 months through March fell to 480 million pounds ($760
million) from 840 million pounds a year earlier the value of its
real estate grew more slowly.  Britain entered a  double dip recession  in the first
quarter, making it harder for landlords to demand higher rent
and leading appraisers to lower the estimated values of shopping
centers. Helping offset these declines were higher values for
office developments in central  London , where British Land plans
to build 2.2 million square feet (204,000 square meters) of
space through 2014.  British Land fell 1.3 percent in London on Friday to 488.7
pence. The shares have advanced 4.2 percent in the past six
months, less than the FTSE 350 Real Estate Investment Trust
Index’s 5.6 percent gain.  To contact the reporter on this story:
