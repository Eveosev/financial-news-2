Abu Dhabi  National Oil Co. offered to
sell a year’s supply of naphtha starting July at a premium to
April prices, according to three people with knowledge of talks
with Asian buyers.  The company offered to sell splitter-grade naphtha at $28 a
metric ton above Middle East benchmark prices, the people said,
declining to be identified because the discussions are ongoing
and confidential. Pentane-plus grade was offered at $29.50 a ton
and low-sulfur naphtha at $28.50 a ton, they said.  Two telephone calls to the company’s sales and research
departments in Abu Dhabi were unanswered.  For its annual contract beginning in April this year,
Adnoc, as the company is known, set the premium for pentane-plus
naphtha at $25 a ton, people involved in those negotiations said
in March. Low-sulfur and splitter-grade naphtha were both set at
$23 a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
