Kenya Reinsurance Corp. (KNRE) , the state-
owned reinsurer, fell a second day after a technical signal
indicated the stockâ€™s gain was overdone.  Kenya Re, as the stock is known, slumped 5.7 percent to
12.35 shilling by the close in Nairobi, the biggest one-day
retreat since Feb. 6. The shares slipped 0.8 percent on Friday
after advancing 6 percent to 13.2 shillings on May 17, the
strongest level in more than two years, touching 95.7 on the
Relative Strength Index. A reading of more than 70 serves as a
signal to some technical analysts a security is overvalued and
set for a reversal.  The stock has catapulted 54 percent since April 23, making
it the second-best performer this year, outpacing the NSE All
Share Index, which jumped 19 percent.  The company said April 23 net income climbed to 1.91
billion shillings ($22.6 million) from 1.54 billion shillings a
year earlier. Net earned premiums rose to 5.7 billion shillings
from 4.3 billion in 2010. The reinsurer plans to offer a bonus
of one share for every six held and a dividend of 0.35 shilling
per share.  To contact the reporter on this story:
