European Union Transport Commissioner
Siim Kallas said Deutsche Bahn AG’s accounting practices are
“unacceptable” and need to be changed,  Financial Times
Deutschland  reported, citing an interview.  Because all subsidiaries transfer profits to the holding
company, which then redistributes the money, “nobody really
knows today if there is an unfair cross-subsidization of the
transport business with money from the infrastructure side, and
therefore ultimately from the government,” Kallas was quoted as
saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
