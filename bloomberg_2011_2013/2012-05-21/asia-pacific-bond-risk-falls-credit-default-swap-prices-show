The cost of insuring Asia-Pacific
corporate and sovereign bonds from default decreased, according
to traders of credit-default swaps.  The  Markit iTraxx Asia  index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  fell 3 basis points to 199.5 basis
points as of 8:44 a.m. in  Hong Kong , Royal Bank of Scotland
Group Plc prices show. The index rose to 200.4 basis points on
May 18, its highest in four months, according to data provider
CMA.  The  Markit iTraxx Japan  index declined 2 basis points to
216 as of 9:37 a.m. in Tokyo, according to Citigroup Inc. The
benchmark jumped to 217.3 basis points on May 18, its highest
since Oct. 5, according to CMA, which is owned by CME Group Inc.
and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the privately
negotiated market.  The  Markit iTraxx Australia  index was little changed at 202
basis points as of 10:43 a.m. in Sydney,  Westpac Banking Corp. (WBC) 
prices show. The gauge rose to 201 basis points on May 18, its
highest since Nov. 29, according to CMA.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
