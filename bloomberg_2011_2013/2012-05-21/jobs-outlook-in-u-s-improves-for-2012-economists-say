Employment will improve more this
year than economists previously estimated, helping the world’s
largest economy to keep growing, a private survey showed.  Payrolls will rise 188,000 a month on average in 2012, up
from a February projection of 170,000, according to the results
of a  survey  by the National Association for Business Economics
issued today in  Washington . Unemployment will average 8 percent
in the fourth quarter, little changed from the three-year low of
8.1 percent reached last month.  The world’s largest economy will grow 2.3 percent this
year, the same as projected in February, and expand 2.7 percent
in 2013. Inflation will probably remain in check, holding around
the  Federal Reserve ’s 2 percent through next year, while a still
elevated jobless rate limits gains in consumer spending, the
survey showed.  Forecasters “expect moderate growth in the near-term with
improvement coming in the post-election year,” Shawn DuBravac,
chief economist at the  Consumer Electronics Association  and the
survey’s chairman, said in a statement. “Expectations for
housing, vehicle sales, employment, and industrial production
all improved.”  Responses in the survey, taken from April 19 through May 2,
didn’t reflect the results of the latest jobs report that was
issued on May 4. Employers added 115,000 workers to payrolls in
April, the fewest in six months, and the jobless rate dropped as
people left the  labor force , according to Labor Department data.  Job Market  The job market may accelerate further next year, the survey
showed. Payroll gains are forecast to average 200,000 a month in
2013, and the  unemployment rate  may drop to 7.5 percent in the
last three months of that year.  The economists raised their forecast for auto sales this
year to 14.5 million from 14 million in the February survey,
which would make this the best year since 2007. Demand is
projected to climb to 14.8 million in 2013.  Prospects for housing are also looking up. Economists in
the latest survey predicted housing starts will climb to 720,000
this year, compared with a February forecast of 700,000. They
are projected to jump to 850,000 in 2013, which would be the
best year for builders since 2008.  Inflation will probably be contained even as the economy
expands. Prices tied to  consumer spending  and excluding food and
fuel, the co-called core personal consumption expenditures
index, will increase 2 percent this year and next, the survey
showed. While higher than projected in the February survey, the
gain is in line with the Fed’s long-term forecast for the index
including food and fuel.  Fifty-four NABE members responded to the survey. The
National Association for Business Economics, founded in 1959, is
the professional organization for people who use economics in
their work.  To contact the reporter on this story:
