Vale SA (VALE) , the world’s biggest iron-ore
producer, said it’s in talks about opening a second trans-
shipment facility for mega-ships in Asia as it struggles to gain
access to Chinese ports.  South Korea is among locations under consideration, Global
Marketing Director Claudio Alves told reporters today in Nantong
city, Jiangsu province, China, where he was attending a ship-
naming event. He didn’t say when a decision would be made.  The Rio de Janeiro-based miner is still having discussions
in China in a bid to win permission for its 400,000 deadweight
ton ships to use local harbors, Alves said. Vale has so far
failed to regularly use Chinese ports as local ship owners
complain about new competition worsening a capacity glut and a
slump in rates.  Sailing the ships to  China  remains “the best solution for
the steel mills in China and for Vale,” Alves said. “We hope
we will be able to implement this very soon.”  Vale eventually intends to build up a fleet of 35 leased
and owned mega-ships, each almost as big as the Bank of America
Tower in  New York . The company will spend at least $8 billion on
the plan.  Today’s event marked naming of the first two mega-ships for
Oman Shipping Co. The vessels, built by  China Rongsheng Heavy
Industries Group Holdings Ltd. (1101) , will next undergo sea trials.
The Omani company will eventually operate four mega-ships for
Vale, which it will use to haul iron ore from Brazil to a
facility in the Persian Gulf sultanate.  --Jasmine Wang. Editors: Neil Denslow, Vipin Nair  To contact the reporter on this story:
