Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT)  shareholders
shouldn’t relect four directors, including Chief Executive
Officer Mike Duke, because of a Mexican bribery probe, according
to  Institutional Shareholder Services Inc.   Duke, former CEO Lee Scott, Chairman Robson Walton and
Christopher Williams should be removed, the corporate governance
advisory firm said in a May 19 report. The directors
inadequately responded to allegations that company officials
bribed Mexican officials to more rapidly expand operations in
the country, ISS said.  The  New York  Times reported last month that Wal-Mart is
investigating whether executives systematically bribed Mexican
officials so it could more quickly open stores. Scott, who was
CEO at the time the bribes are alleged to have taken place in
2005 and 2006, and Duke, who was head of Wal-Mart’s
international operations before becoming CEO, didn’t investigate
the matter satisfactorily, ISS said.  Voting any Wal-Mart directors off the board would probably
require the support of the Walton family, whose Walton
Enterprises LP owns 47 percent of the shares, according to
Bloomberg data. The directors stand for reelection on June 2.  To contact the reporter on this story:
