A group of LightSquared Inc. lenders
that objected to the wireless-network provider’s use of cash
collateral owns $1.1 billion of its secured debt and includes
Capital Research & Management Co. and Appaloosa Management LP.  The debt is part of a $1.7 billion loan to LightSquared’s
“LP” unit, according to papers filed May 18 in  bankruptcy
court  in Manhattan. U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Shelley Chapman at a
May 16 hearing asked the lender group, represented by law firm
White & Case LLP, to disclose its members and holdings.  “Today it really isn’t a business. There’s a vision of a
business,”  Thomas Lauria , a lawyer for the ad hoc lender group,
said of LightSquared on May 16. Lenders are concerned that the
company’s assets and cash flow aren’t enough to support the LP
unit’s debt, he said.  LightSquared, based in Reston, Virginia, filed for
bankruptcy May 14, saying it will seek a resolution with U.S.
regulators who thwarted the company’s plan to deliver high-speed
wireless to as many as 260 million people over concerns that it
interferes with GPS networks.  Capital Research owns $331.2 million in LightSquared debt
and Appaloosa owns $257.3 million in debt, according to court
papers. The other holders are  Fortress Investment Group LLC (FIG) ,
Knighthead Capital Management LLC, Redwood Capital Management
LLC, Silver Point Capital LP, Solus Alternative Asset Management
LP and Cyrus Capital Partners LP. The group also owns some
preferred securities, according to court papers.  Cash Management  Chapman urged LightSquared to reach an agreement with
lenders on the cash collateral at the May 16 hearing. She also
approved LightSquared’s request to manage its $15 million in
cash on hand.  LightSquared listed assets of $4.48 billion and debt of
$2.29 billion as of Feb. 29 in its Chapter 11 filing. The filing
followed intense negotiations with creditors, who had requested
that the company’s backer,  Philip Falcone , step aside. Falcone
and the current management team will remain with the company,
 Terry Neal , a LightSquared spokesman, said May 14.  The case is In re LightSquared Inc., 12-12080, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of  New York  (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
