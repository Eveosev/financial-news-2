South African wheat rallied to a
seven-month high after the global price surged as dry weather
threatens the harvests in the U.S. and  Russia , two of the
world’s three biggest shippers this year.  South African wheat prices for July delivery increased 2.2
percent to 2,948 rand ($355) a metric ton by the midday close in
Johannesburg, the strongest level on a closing basis since Oct.
7. Wheat on the Chicago Board of Trade increased to an eight-
month high.  “Due to the extreme dryness in key wheat growing areas in
Russia and in parts of the U.S., the U.S. market traded higher
over the weekend and also forced our market higher,” Benjamin Swanepoel, a Johannesburg-based trader at Trademar Futures (Pty)
Ltd., said in an e-mailed response to questions today.  Before today, wheat futures rallied in six of seven
sessions in  Chicago  after the U.S. Department of Agriculture
released its first outlook for the 2012-2013 season on May 10,
predicting a smaller global harvest.  Russia’s total grain harvest may drop 2.7 percent to 91
million tons from last month’s forecast of 93.5 million tons
because of drought in southern regions, the Moscow-based
Institute for Agricultural Market Studies said on May 18.  The country is sub-Saharan  Africa ’s largest wheat producer
and the region’s third-biggest importer of the grain after
Nigeria and  Sudan , according to USDA data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
