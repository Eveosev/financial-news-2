IKA ,  Greece ’s largest state social-
security fund for employees, and  OAEE , the fund for self-
employed people, need money from the government to make July
pension payments,  Imerisia  reported.  IKA needs 200 million euros ($255 million) and OAEE 100
million euros to pay July pensions on June 22, the newspaper
said, citing estimates by the managements of the two funds.  Non-payment, or delays in payment, of contributions because
of Greece’s recession caused IKA’s funding to fall by 14 percent
and OAEE’s by about 20 percent in the first four months of the
year, Imerisia said, citing fund officials.  To contact the reporter on this story:
