Germany  should stop utilities
including EON AG from closing unprofitable gas-fired power
plants to safeguard supplies,  Handelsblatt  reported, citing the
state-owned Dena Energy Agency.  While the government can legally force utilities to keep
plants online, operators must be compensated for doing so,
Stephan Kohler, head of the research agency, told the newspaper.  Germany should create “capacity markets” by identifying
the generators needed and paying those companies that can build
or operate them at the lowest cost, Kohler said, according to
Handelsblatt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
