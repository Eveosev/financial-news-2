The Czech Republic’s  PX (PX)  stock index
gained for a second day, rising 0.5 percent to 873.2 by the end
of trading in Prague.  The following were among the most active equities in the
Czech market today. Stock symbols follow company names.  Central European Media Enterprises Ltd. (CETV)   fell for
an 11th day, its longest stretch of losses on record, sliding 2
percent to 129.05 koruna. The broadcaster had its long-term
corporate  credit rating  downgraded to CC from B- at  Standard &
Poor’s  late on May 18.  CEZ AS (CEZ)  , the country’s biggest power utility, rose
2.3 percent to 726 koruna, its steepest one-day gain in a month.
Electricity for next-year delivery in Germany, where the company
exports part of its output, climbed 0.7 percent to 48.85 euros
per megawatt-hour as China’s pledge to support economic growth
boosted demand for commodities and energy worldwide.  New World Resources Plc (NWR)  , the biggest Czech coking-
coal producer, dropped 3.3 percent to 103.5 koruna, its lowest
close in almost three years. The company said today one employee
was killed in an underground incident at its CSM mine.  To contact the reporter on this story:
