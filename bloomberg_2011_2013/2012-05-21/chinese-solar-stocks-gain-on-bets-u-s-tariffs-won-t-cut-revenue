Chinese solar stocks rose for the
first time in six days in  New York , led by  Yingli Green Energy
Holding Co. (YGE) , on speculation new U.S. tariffs announced last week
won’t reduce the companies’ sales.  Yingli, a solar-panel maker based in Baoding city in
northern  China , rose the most in two months, adding 6.7 percent
to $2.69 at the close of trading in New York. Shares have lost
29 percent this year.  Suntech Power Holdings Co. (STP) , the world’s
largest solar-panel maker, added 1.5 percent to $2.03.  Yingli fell 22 percent and Suntech slumped 12 percent in
the two days after the U.S. said on May 17 that it’s imposing
tariffs of as much as 250 percent on Chinese-made solar cells to
aid domestic manufacturers. The companies can sustain U.S. sales
by circumventing the tariffs through increased manufacturing in
Canada and the U.S., or exporting panels from  Taiwan ,  David Smith , the portfolio manager of the  Gabelli Green Fund (SRIAX) , said.  “There was a knee-jerk reaction to the news last week
that’s turned to the realization that there are many ways
Chinese solar companies can work around these duties,” Smith
said by phone from Rye, New York. “This makes it a little more
difficult but there’s nothing that says these guys can’t order
cells from Taiwan and have them assembled in the U.S.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
