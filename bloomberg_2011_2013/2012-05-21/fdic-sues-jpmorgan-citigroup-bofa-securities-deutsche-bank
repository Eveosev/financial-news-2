The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
sued a group of banks, including  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) ,  Citigroup
Inc. (C) ,  Bank of America  Securities and  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) , in two
suits over mortgage-backed securities.  The FDIC, acting as receiver for two failed banks, filed
the suits in New York federal court today seeking money the
banks allegedly lost on securities backed by residential
mortgages. The suits claim a total of $77 million.  The FDIC filed an $11 million claim as receiver for
Strategic Capital Bank, a Champaign, Illinois commercial bank
that was closed by regulators in 2009. It filed a separate
$66 million claim on behalf of Strategic Capital and Citizens
National Bank.  The FDIC alleges the defendants misled investors in the
registration statements for the securities.  Scott Helfman, a spokesman for Citigroup, declined to
comment on the suits, as did Bank of America spokesman Lawrence Grayson and Deutsche Bank spokeswoman Renee Calabro. Phone calls
to Joseph Evangelisti, a JPMorgan spokesman, werenâ€™t immediately
returned.  The cases are:  Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation  v.
Bear Stearns Asset Backed Secutiries I LLC, 12-CV-4000; Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation v. J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, 12-
CV-4001, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
