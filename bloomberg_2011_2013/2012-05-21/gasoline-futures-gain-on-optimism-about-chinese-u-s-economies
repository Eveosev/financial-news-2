Gasoline rose the most in five weeks
as a Federal Reserve report showed increased U.S. economic
activity and  China ’s premier pledged support for policies to
boost the economy.  Futures gained as the Chicago Fed’s national index, which
draws on 85 economic indicators, climbed to 0.11 in April,
versus minus 0.44 in March. Chinese Premier  Wen Jiabao  called
for “putting stabilizing growth in a more important position,”
easing concern the world’s second-largest economy is slowing.  “The Fed number is encouraging and so are the remarks from
China,” said  Phil Flynn , vice president of research at PFGBest
in Chicago.  Gasoline for June delivery rose 5.06 cents, or 1.8 percent,
to settle at $2.9401 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . It was the largest gain since April 12.  Futures sank 3.7 percent last week on concern that  Europe ’s
fiscal crisis and Greek’s possible exit from the euro currency
may slow economic growth and curb fuel demand in the region.  Leaders of the Group of Eight nations pushed for Greece to
stay in the euro system as the eight leading industrial
economies met at Camp David over the weekend.  “We agree on the importance of a strong and cohesive  euro
zone  for global stability and recovery, and we affirm our
interest in Greece remaining in the euro zone while respecting
its commitments,” according to a G-8 statement yesterday.  Oil products were supported by the group’s message, said
 Andy Lipow , president of Lipow Oil Associates LLC in Houston.  U.S. inventories of the motor fuel as of May 11 dropped to
the lowest level for this time of year since 2004, the Energy
Department reported May 16.  Pump Prices  Regular gasoline at the pump, averaged nationwide,  fell  0.1
cent to $3.689 a gallon yesterday, according to AAA. It was the
lowest level since Feb. 25. Gasoline is down 24.7 cents since
reaching a 2012 high of $3.936 on April 4.  June-delivery heating oil increased 3.03 cents, or 1.1
percent, to $2.8603 a gallon on the exchange, after dropping 4.5
percent last week.  Distillate inventories in the U.S. fell six consecutive
weeks to the lowest level since June 2008, according to
government data.  To contact the reporters on this story:
