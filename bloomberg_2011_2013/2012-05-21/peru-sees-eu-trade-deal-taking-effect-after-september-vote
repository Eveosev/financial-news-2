The European Union’s free-trade
agreement with  Peru  and Colombia will probably take effect this
year after the European Parliament approves the accord in
September, Peruvian Foreign Minister Rafael Roncagliolo said.  While the legislatures in each of the 27-member countries
will need to approve the accord before it takes effect, most of
its benefits will be activated once it’s endorsed by the
European Parliament, Roncagliolo said at a news conference in
Lima today.  President Ollanta Humala will visit Strasbourg, France, and
Brussels on June 13 to discuss the agreement, which would
eliminate import tariffs on almost all commerce between the EU
and Peru and Colombia. It was approved by the European Council
on March 16. Humala will also visit Geneva and Berlin during the
trip, Roncagliolo said.  The Andean nation, which has free-trade agreements with the
U.S.,  China ,  South Korea  and Japan, aims to boost exports to $86
billion by 2016 from $46 billion last year. The country also
seeks trade accords with Russia and India, Roncagliolo said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
