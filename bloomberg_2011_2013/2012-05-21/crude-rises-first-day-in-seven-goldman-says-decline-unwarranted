Oil for June delivery rose as much as
49 cents, or 0.5 percent, to $91.97 a barrel in electronic
trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange, and was at $91.93
at 11:36 a.m. Sydney time. Prices have fallen the past six days
and are down 12 percent this month.  The extent of the sell-off was unwarranted as the balance
between supply and demand is tightening, Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. said in a report e-mailed today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
