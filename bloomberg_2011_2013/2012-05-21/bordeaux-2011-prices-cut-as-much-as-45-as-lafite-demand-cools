Top Bordeaux 2011 wines including
Chateau Lafite-Rothschild and Chateau Cos d’Estournel are
selling for between 30 percent and 45 percent below recent
vintages after investment demand for the exceptional 2009s and
2010s sapped buyers’ appetite for less-powerful new clarets.  First-growth  Lafite  is being quoted at $8,410 a case on
London-based wine exchange Liv-ex, 41 percent below 2010 and 45
percent down from the 2009s. Second-growth  Cos d’Estournel , its
close neighbor, is at $1,680 a case for the latest vintage, 45
percent down from the 2010s and 62 percent below 2009.  Asian demand for Bordeaux is becoming more selective while
European and American buyers, still struggling with prices for
the 2009s and 2010s, are eyeing cheaper back vintages and are
less willing to pay premiums for wines still needing a decade or
more in bottle, which critics including  Robert Parker  say fall
short of the overall quality reached in the previous two years.
Recession in Europe and weak global growth, combined with
tumbling bank bonuses, are also driving the market lower.  “Coming into the 2011s, there is more uncertainty,”
 Michael Saunders , managing director of Bibendum Wine Ltd. in
London, said during a tasting at Lord’s cricket ground. “The
vintage isn’t being as widely lauded as the 2010s. There needs
to be a real reason for people to buy 2011s at this stage.”  American Thirst  Pierre Lurton, director of top Sauternes producer Chateau
d’Yquem and Chateau Cheval Blanc in Saint Emilion, said he saw
more English and American buyers and fewer Asians among the
2,000 visitors to Cheval Blanc during the en primeur campaign to
sample wines that won’t be bottled for another year or more.  “It’s a vintage for  Europe  and for America,” Lurton said.
“The price decrease of between 30 percent and 45 percent is
normal. It’s not a speculative vintage, 2011, like 2010 and
2009. It’s a vintage for the traditional consumer.”  A warm, unusually dry spring followed by a cool summer made
it a tough year to ripen grapes consistently, making the timing
of the harvest particularly critical. Christian Seely, director
of Pauillac second-growth  Chateau Pichon-Longueville , said that
“for now maybe the 2011 is slightly in the shadow of its very
illustrious predecessors, but put it in the context of the last
10 years and this is a very serious vintage.”  London merchants said demand exists for the new vintage at
lower prices, and price cuts have generated sales.  Consumer Vintage  Parker, writing in the Wine Advocate following tastings in
March, said “this is the type of vintage where the producers
should price low and sell as quickly as possible, giving
consumers something to get excited about.”  Chateau Pontet-Canet, a Pauillac fifth-growth that is a
close neighbor to both Lafite and Chateau Mouton-Rothschild,
went on sale in  London  at 720 pounds ($1,160) a case, 37 percent
below the level at which its 2010 wines are quoted on Liv-ex and
56 percent down from its 2009s.  “We sold out within two hours, and had demand for a third
more,” Alfred Tesseron, owner of Pontet-Canet, said in London.
“I could have priced it higher, but I am working for the long
term.” London merchants agreed.  “It came out at a good price and it’s the first wine
that’s really kicked,” said Saunders. “We’ve sold a lot of
Pontet-Canet.”  First-growth  Chateau Margaux  released its wines at 3,800
pounds a case for the U.K. market, down 45 percent from current
Liv-ex prices for its 2010 and 48 percent lower than 2009, while
Chateau Lynch-Bages, a Pauillac fifth-growth, went on sale at
750 pounds, down 27 percent from last year.  Cheaper Giscours  Chateau Giscours , a third-growth from Margaux, pitched its
2011 at 320 pounds a case for London buyers, down 25 percent
from its 2010, while Chateau Batailley, also a Pauillac fifth-
growth, went on sale at 250 pounds, down 15 percent from 2010.  A significant driver of lower prices has been producers’
desire to hold on to traditional buyers in Europe and the U.S.
after four years in which much of the focus has been on demand
coming from  China  and other parts of Asia, dealers said.  The abolition of wine duties in  Hong Kong  in 2008 coincided
with the collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. that year,
resulting in a boost to Asian demand just as the U.S. and
European markets suffered a setback.  Auction sales indicate Asian collectors are shifting their
attention away from Bordeaux first-growths toward less well-
known clarets and rarer Burgundies, as well as wines from other
regions. Bordeaux producers are watching the trend closely.  “Pichon-Baron is probably 20 percent to 25 percent in Asia
and no more, and I’m quite happy with that sort of figure,”
Seely said. “We’re not dependent on the Asian market in any
way. If we were to go to 50 percent or 60 percent of our sales
in  Asia , which could easily happen, you would be starving your
traditional market, and that would be dangerous.”  Bibendum’s Saunders agreed that Bordeaux needs to maintain
the global balance of its market as it prices the 2011 vintage.  “To put all your chips on China is probably a big call,”
he said. “It might be a lucrative call short-term, but they’ve
got to look after their traditional markets.”  (Guy Collins writes about the wine market for Muse, the
