BP Plc (BP/) ’s Sangachal terminal, south of
the Azeri capital of Baku, exported less crude oil in the first
quarter than a year earlier because of lower production from the
Azeri-Chirag-Guneshli field.  The terminal pumped about 76.6 million barrels of oil, down
from 78 million barrels in the same period of 2011, BP said
today in an e-mail.  Of the total, 66.7 million barrels were exported via the
Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline and 8.1 million barrels through the
Western Route Export Pipeline, also known as the Baku-Supsa
link. Both pipelines are operated by BP. The remaining 1.55
million barrels were transported by rail, BP said.  The Sangachal terminal also exported about 22 million cubic
meters of natural gas through the South Caucasus Pipeline, or
SCP, in the first quarter. That compared with 16.2 million cubic
meters a year earlier, BP said. The fuel was produced from the
offshore Shah Deniz field in the  Caspian Sea .  Azerbaijan exports gas to Georgia and  Turkey  via the SCP
and to  Russia  across the Mozdok-Gazimagomed pipeline. The
Caspian Sea nation produced 45.6 million metric tons of oil and
25.8 billion cubic meters of gas last year.  Production from the ACG field fell to 8.8 million tons from
9.6 million tons a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
