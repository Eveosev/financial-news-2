Crude-oil options volatility fell as
the underlying futures rebounded after hitting a six-month low
last week as the Seaway pipeline began carrying cheap oil to the
 Gulf of Mexico .  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
July, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge
of options prices, was 27.6 percent at 12:50 p.m. on the  New
York  Mercantile Exchange, down from 29.6 percent May 18.  Crude oil for June delivery rose 79 cents, or 0.9 percent,
to $92.27 a barrel on the Nymex at 12:55 p.m.  Enterprise Products Partners LP (EPD)  and  Enbridge Inc. (ENB)  started
shipping oil Saturday through the 150,000-barrel-a-day Seaway
pipeline from Cushing,  Oklahoma , to Houston-area refineries. The
startup of the line, which was reversed, may ease a storage glut
in Cushing, the delivery point for New York futures.  Booming production in  Canada  and the Midwest U.S. combined
with a lack of pipeline capacity out of Cushing caused storage
there to increase to 45.1 million barrels, the highest level on
record, the Energy Department said May 16.  The most-active oil options in electronic trading today
were July $80 puts, which fell 20 cents to 22 cents a barrel at
1:12 p.m. with 3,821 lots trading. July $130 calls were the
second-most active options with 2,560 lots changing hands as
they fell 1 cent to 3 cents a barrel.  Calls accounted for 63 percent of electronic trading
volume. The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on floor
trading, where the bulk of options trading occurs.  December $90 puts were the most active options in May 18
trading, rising 55 cents to $6.71 a barrel on 6,557 lots. July
$120 calls were next, falling 1 cent to 7 cents on volume of
6,491.  Open interest was highest for December $80 puts with
39,794, followed by December $150 calls with 35,723 and December
$70 puts with 35,211.  To contact the reporter on this story:
