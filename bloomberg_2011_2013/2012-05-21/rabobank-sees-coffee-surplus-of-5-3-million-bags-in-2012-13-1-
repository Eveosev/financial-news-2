Coffee supplies may outpace demand in
the season that starts in October in most countries, reversing
the current shortage, according to Rabobank International.  Coffee production will be 5.3 million bags higher than
consumption in 2012-13, up from a deficit of 2.7 million bags in
2011-12, the bank said in a monthly report e-mailed today.
Production will climb 7.7 percent to 146.2 million bags as
arabica trees in top grower  Brazil  enter the higher-yielding
half of a two-year cycle, Rabobank estimates. Global consumption
will rise to 141 million bags, an increase of about 2 percent.  “The coffee market shifts generally between surplus and
deficit depending on the production cycle of Brazilian output,”
Keith Flury, an analyst at the bank in  London , wrote in the
report. “The increase in production has also been supported by
the high coffee price.”  Brazil will produce 38.5 million bags of arabica beans in
the 2012-13 season that starts there in July and 17 million bags
of the robusta variety, according to the bank.  Colombia , the
second-biggest grower of arabica coffee, will produce 9 million
bags in the 2012-13 season, up from 7.2 million bags in 2011-12,
the bank estimates. Growers in  Vietnam , the biggest robusta
producer, will harvest 23.5 million bags in 2012-13, up from
22.5 million bags in the current season, Flury said.  “While expectations of better supply have resulted in
lower prices, the new season harvests will not be able to build
buffer stocks high enough for the next deficit year of
2013-14,” Flury said in the report. “Demand growth, especially
in robusta and the washed and semi-washed arabicas, will prevent
international prices from collapsing.”  Coffee Seen Rising  Robusta coffee will average $2,050 a metric ton in London
in the second quarter, up from last month’s forecast of $1,950 a
ton. Prices will rise to $2,100 a ton in the third, up from the
previous estimate of $1,850. The commodity will trade at $2,000
a ton in the final three months, up from $1,800.  “Certified Liffe stocks continue to fall and exports from
Vietnam are tailing off, supporting the market expectation that
robusta supplies are thin in  Europe  and the U.S. relative to
demand ahead of the next Vietnamese harvest,” Flury said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
