Tunisia’s justice minister vowed
reprisals against Salafis who forcibly closed two bars in the
country’s west, saying today the ultraconservative Islamists had
“crossed all red lines.”  The pledge by Noureddine Bouheri on Express FM radio
station came a day after state television quoted witnesses as
saying that a large group of Salafis, who adhere to a strict
interpretation of Islam, forced the shutdown of the two
nightspots in Sidi Bouzid, about 350 kilometers west of the
capital.  “The opening they were granted has ended,” Bouheri said,
referring to the Salafis who have grown in influence in the
country since the uprising that pushed longtime President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali from power. “They have cross all red lines
and will be strictly punished.”  While other Islamists have secured a hold on the parliament
and the new government, they have resisted the push by more
conservative Salafis to impose Islamic law in the country. Prime
Minister Hamadi Jbeli had said that his government will not
close bars and wine shops, a move that secularists worry could
harm the vital  tourism industry .  To contact the reporter on this story:
