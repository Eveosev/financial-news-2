U.S. stocks rose, giving the Standard
& Poor’s 500 Index its biggest rally in more than two months,
after China signaled it would support growth while German and
French officials said they will work to keep Greece in the euro.  Commodity,  technology  and industrial shares gained the most
among 10 S&P 500 groups. Apple Inc.,  Newmont Mining Corp. (NEM)  and
 Boeing (BA)  Co. added at least 3.8 percent.  Cooper Industries Plc (CBE) 
surged 25 percent as  Eaton Corp. (ETN)  agreed to buy the company for
$11.8 billion. Facebook Inc. tumbled 11 percent and closed below
its offer price of $38 in its second trading day.  JPMorgan (JPM)  Chase
& Co. and  Bank of America Corp. (BAC)  slumped more than 2.7 percent.  The S&P 500 added 1.6 percent to 1,315.99 at 4 p.m. New
York time, halting a  six-day drop . The Dow Jones Industrial
Average rose 135.10 points, or 1.1 percent, to 12,504.48. The
Nasdaq Composite Index gained 2.5 percent, the most this year,
to 2,847.21. About  6.9 billion  shares changed hands on U.S.
exchanges or almost in line with the three-month average.  “We’re in need of some rally after the pullback,” said
Eric Teal, chief investment officer at First Citizens Bancshares
Inc., which manages $4.5 billion in Raleigh, North Carolina.
“China’s comments were encouraging as it stands ready to
provide stimulus. That’s important for the global economy.”  Stocks rebounded from a four-month low as Chinese Premier
Wen Jiabao pledged to focus more on bolstering growth. Germany
and France agree that they will do “everything necessary” to
ensure Greece remains in Europe’s single currency, Finance
Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said after a meeting with French
Finance Minister Pierre Moscovici.  $1 Trillion  More than $1 trillion was erased from U.S. market values
this month on concern about Europe’s crisis. The decline took
the  S&P 500  down as much as 8.7 percent from an almost four-year
high. At the end of last week, the S&P 500 traded at 13.1 times
reported earnings, below the average since  1954 (SPX)  of 16.4.  Today’s rebound in equities extended this year’s gain in
the S&P 500 to 4.6 percent. The Morgan Stanley Cyclical Index of
companies most-tied to the economy rose 2.5 percent. Apple, the
most valuable company, added 5.8 percent to $561.28. Newmont
Mining climbed 3.9 percent to $47.37. Boeing jumped 3.8 percent
to $71.78 after Argus Research recommended buying the shares of
the biggest aerospace company.  Cooper Industries jumped 25 percent, the most in almost 11
years, to $69.88. Each Cooper share will be exchanged for $39.15
in cash and 0.77479 Eaton share. That offer is valued at $72 a
share based on Eaton’s May 18 closing price, 29 percent more
than Cooper’s price that day.  Yahoo Gains  Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO)  advanced 1 percent to $15.58. Alibaba Group
Holding Ltd., China’s largest e-commerce provider, agreed to
repurchase about a 20 percent stake in itself from the U.S. Web
portal for about $7.1 billion.  Radian Group Inc. (RDN)  led a rally of mortgage insurers after
investor Clinton Group Inc. pushed for a sale of the company.
Clinton “is aware of one former industry executive who has
expressed serious interest in acquiring Radian at a price
significantly above its current trading level,” the asset
management firm said today in a statement.  The Philadelphia-based insurer jumped 18 percent to $2.39.
 MGIC Investment Corp. (MTG)  climbed 6.3 percent to $2.36.  Genworth
Financial Inc. (GNW)  advanced 4.5 percent to $5.10.  Facebook tumbled 11 percent to $34.03. It rose 0.6 percent
in its first day of trading on May 18. The offering valued
Facebook at  107 times  trailing 12-month earnings, more than
every S&P 500 member except Amazon.com Inc. and Equity
Residential. Facebook is trying to attract more marketers to
boost sales as competition increases. General Motors Co. last
week announced plans to cut Facebook advertising.  ‘Valuation Is Rich’  “Valuation is rich,” said Mark Luschini, chief investment
strategist for Philadelphia-based Janney Montgomery Scott LLC,
which manages $54 billion. “You have a company like GM saying
they don’t see the utility in advertising on Facebook. That
collection of things has influenced the lack of enthusiasm.”  Zynga Inc., which makes games played on Facebook, lost 1
percent to $7.09. The shares tumbled 13 percent on May 18.
 LinkedIn Corp. (LNKD) , the professional-networking site, dropped 2.2
percent to $96.84.  Nasdaq OMX Group Inc. (NDAQ) , under scrutiny after shares of
Facebook were plagued by delays and mishandled orders on its
first day of  trading , said it will no longer accept
modifications to orders during the final stages of initial
public offering auctions, according to a statement.  Nasdaq’s chief executive officer said yesterday that
 Facebook Inc. (FB) ’s stock trading following its IPO was delayed May
18 because computer systems used to establish the opening price
were overwhelmed by order cancellations and updates.  ‘Highly Unattractive’  A gauge of diversified financial shares in the S&P 500
retreated. David Trone, an analyst at JMP Securities LLC,
downgraded some banks including JPMorgan and Bank of America. He
said risk/reward is “highly unattractive.” JPMorgan fell 2.9
percent to $32.51. Bank of America slumped 2.7 percent to $6.83.  JPMorgan suspended its daily stock repurchase program
because the bank needs the money to meet international capital
rules, not because of trading losses, Chief Executive Officer
Jamie Dimon said. JPMorgan revealed a $2 billion trading loss on
May 10. The firm may face even bigger losses on faulty bets in
credit markets if Europe’s crisis worsens, according to one of
the hedge funds that took the other side of the trades.  “They’re not out of those positions,” Michael Platt, co-
founder and chief executive officer of BlueCrest Capital
Management LLP, said today in an interview on Bloomberg
Television’s “Inside Track.”  BlackRock, Lowe’s  BlackRock Inc. (BLK)  retreated 2.4 percent to $167.73. Barclays
Plc, the U.K.’s second-largest bank by assets, will sell its
entire $6.1 billion  stake  in BlackRock before the latest round
of Basel rules stops it from counting the holding as capital.  Lowe’s Cos. (LOW)  slumped 10 percent, the most since 2009, to
$25.60. The second-largest U.S. home-improvement retailer
reduced its forecast for full-year earnings to a range of $1.73
to $1.83 from $1.75 to $1.85 because of a smaller increase in
profit margins than it had previously expected.  Campbell Soup Co. (CPB)  fell 2 percent to $32.75 after posting a
decline in third-quarter  profit  as the company works to revive
its struggling soup business.  Eastman Kodak Co. (EKDKQ)  lost a  ruling  in a legal fight against
 Apple (AAPL)  Inc. and  Research In Motion Ltd. (RIM)  over a patent for digital
image-preview technology, a decision that may hurt the value of
assets Kodak is selling. The shares, which have traded over the
counter since the bankruptcy, plunged 27 percent to 20 cents.  Avon Products Inc. (AVP)  retreated 1.1 percent to $16.77. The
world’s largest door-to-door  cosmetics seller  was downgraded to
sell from neutral at UBS AG.  To contact the reporter on this story:
