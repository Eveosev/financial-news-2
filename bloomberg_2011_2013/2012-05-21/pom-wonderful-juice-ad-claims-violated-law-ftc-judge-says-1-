POM Wonderful LLC’s advertising
claims about the health benefits of its pomegranate juice drink
violated the law, according to a U.S. Federal Trade Commission
administrative law judge.  POM Wonderful made “false or misleading” claims about the
effects of the drink, according to D. Michael Chappell, the
FTC’s chief administrative law judge in an initial decision
released today. The advertisements claimed the product would
treat or prevent  heart disease , prostate cancer and erectile
dysfunction.  Chappell rejected the agency’s position that the company
needed to conduct clinical trials, similar to what is required
for approval of medication, to make the health claims.  David Vladeck , director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer
Protection, said in a statement that he is “pleased” with the
ruling.  The decision takes effect after 30 days unless the FTC or
the company file an appeal.  POM has marketed its juice in “an honest manner, backed by
scientific research,” said Stewart A. Resnick, president of
Roll Global, an associated company that is also a defendant, in
a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
