Mardy Fish , the 10th-ranked men’s
tennis player, and women’s No. 15 Andrea Petkovic were among
eight players to withdraw from the French Open starting May 27.  Fish of the U.S. pulled out citing fatigue and his place
will be taken by Canada’s Frank Dancevic, organizers said on the
tournament’s website. Germany’s Petkovic, who has a right ankle
injury, will be replaced by Lesia Tsurenko of Ukraine.  Robin Soderling of Sweden, the 2009 and 2010 French Open
runner-up and the only man to beat six-time champion  Rafael Nadal  at Roland Garros, won’t play this year as he continues to
recover from mononucleosis. Pere Riba of Spain and Pablo Cuevas
of Uruguay also pulled out on the men’s side.  The other women to withdraw from the clay-court major are
world No. 18 Daniela Hantuchova of Slovakia, Agnes Szavay of
 Hungary  and Timea Bacsinszky of Switzerland.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
