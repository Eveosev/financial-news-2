JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  Chief Executive
Officer Jamie Dimon may give investors “a better explanation”
of how the bank lost $2 billion on trading and whether the
dividend is safe when he appears at an investor conference later
today, according to  Citigroup Inc. (C)  analysts.  “A lot of investors’ concerns have gotten to extreme
levels,” wrote Citigroup’s  Keith Horowitz  in a note to clients.
Dimon’s presentation may include “we would hope a very clear
statement that dividend is not at risk and that buybacks are
still expected in 2012.”  Citigroup called New York-based JPMorgan, the biggest U.S.
bank by assets, an “absolute buy,” saying that estimates on
the ultimate size of the trading loss “are getting a bit
carried away.” A dividend cut is very unlikely, Horowitz wrote.  Dimon is scheduled to speak at 9:30 a.m.  New York  time at a
conference sponsored by Deutsche Bank AG in lower Manhattan.
He’s under pressure from investors and regulators to explain how
the bank’s chief investment office, which is assigned to manage
excess cash while minimizing risk, wound up with a $2 billion
loss from trades in illiquid  credit derivatives .  Dimon announced the loss May 10 and said it could expand in
coming weeks. He assailed the bank’s handling of trading in
credit derivatives as “flawed, complex, poorly reviewed, poorly
executed and poorly monitored.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
