ITE Group Plc (ITE) , the London-based
international events organizer that does most of its business in
 Russia , is looking to make acquisitions in India,  Turkey  and
 southeast Asia .  The company expects to make further purchases in India and
possibly Turkey over the next year, Chief Executive Officer
Russell Taylor said today. The “right” acquisition in  China 
may take as long as three years to find, he said.  “We are planning to progressively invest our cash
balances,” Taylor said in a telephone interview. “We are
looking at countries like Indonesia and Malaysia and you can
never ignore the possibility of investing in China.”  ITE, which operates in more than 30 countries, bought two
companies in Ukraine and one in  India  in the fiscal first half
and is due to complete another purchases in India in the next
few days, Taylor said. Acquisitions accounted for two-thirds of
the increase in first-half revenue.  ITE had net cash of 16.4 million pounds on March 31,
compared with 5.5 million pounds on Sept. 30 after free cash
flow of 32.7 million pounds in the first half. Its biggest
acquisition in the past five years cost 33 million euros ($42
million), according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Net income in the six months ended March 31 surged 89
percent to 5.1 million pounds ($8.1 million), or 2.1 pence a
share, from 2.7 million pounds, or 1.1 pence, a year earlier,
the company said in a statement. Revenue rose 29 percent to 68.6
million pounds.  On a same-store basis revenue booked so far in the current
year is 6 percent ahead of this time last year.  The shares rose as much as 3.9 percent in London trading,
the most since March 14. They were up 2.2 pence, or 1.1 percent,
at 207.2 pence at 9 a.m., lifting the gain so far this year to
1.3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
