The Hungarian government will
purchase 8,000 properties this year from foreign-currency
mortgage holders who can’t service their debt, state news
service  MTI  said, citing Roland Natran, a deputy state secretary
at the  Economy Ministry .  The state will buy a total of 25,000 such properties
through 2014, compared with earlier plans for acquiring 5,000
homes, Natran said, according to MTI.  The necessary financing for this year’s purchases will
either come from general budget reserves or Parliament will
amend the budget without jeopardizing the  deficit  target of 2.5
percent of economic output, Natran said, MTI reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
