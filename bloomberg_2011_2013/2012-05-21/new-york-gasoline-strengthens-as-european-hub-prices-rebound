New York  gasoline strengthened as
European prices gained for the first time in four days,
decreasing the incentive to export to the U.S.  Gasoline barges for loading in the Amsterdam-Rotterdam-
Antwerp area changed hands from $1,004 to $1,011 a ton,
according to a survey of the Argus Bulletin Board. That compares
with a trade on May 18 at $986 a ton, which was the lowest since
Jan. 26.  The discount for regular, 87-octane gasoline in New York
Harbor narrowed 1.5 cents to 5 cents a gallon versus futures
trading on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 12:12 p.m.,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Prompt delivery rose
4.55 cents to $2.87 a gallon.  The same fuel in the  Gulf Coast  weakened 2.37 cents to 20
cents a gallon below futures.  The premium for ultra-low-sulfur diesel versus heating oil
futures in the Gulf also weakened 0.25 cent to 2.13 cents a
gallon.  The differential in  Chicago  for regular, 87-octane gasoline
dropped 4.5 cents to 3.5 cents over futures.  To contact the reporter on this story:
