Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO)  ex-Chief Executive
Officer  Scott Thompson  resigned from the board of  Splunk Inc. (SPLK) 
after a scandal about a false degree listed on his resume led to
his departure from Yahoo.  Thompson’s stepped down from the board May 18, Splunk said
today in a statement. The San Francisco-based company, which
makes software for analyzing Web data, plans to announce a
successor at a later date. He also resigned as a director of F5
Networks Inc. last week.  Thompson’s downfall at Yahoo stemmed from  references  in his
biography saying that he held a bachelor’s degree in computer
science from Stonehill College. The incorrect degree showed up
in the company’s  regulatory filings  and its  website . Yahoo
replaced Thompson with interim CEO Ross Levinsohn, head of its
global media, on May 13.  Before resigning as CEO, Thompson told directors he has
been diagnosed with thyroid cancer, according to a person
briefed on the matter.  “We thank Mr. Thompson for his contributions to the
company,” Splunk Chairman and CEO Godfrey Sullivan said in
today’s statement. “In regard to recent health issues, we wish
Scott all the best for a fast and full recovery.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
