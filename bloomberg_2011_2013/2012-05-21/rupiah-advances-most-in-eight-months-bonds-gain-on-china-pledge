Indonesia’s rupiah advanced the most
in almost eight months and bonds rose after  China  pledged to
boost its economy and world leaders sought to keep  Greece  in the
 euro zone , spurring demand for emerging-market assets.  The Bloomberg-JPMorgan Asia Dollar Index snapped six days
of losses after China’s Premier  Wen Jiabao  said on May 20 he
will give more priority to maintaining growth. Leaders of the
Group of Eight nations pushed for Greece to stay in the euro
area on May 19.  Bank Indonesia  continues to enter the rupiah
market and will use its “ammunition” carefully, Deputy
Governor Hartadi Sarwono said last week, adding that the central
bank doesn’t want the rupiah to weaken too fast.  “There’s relief in the market from all the news, which
gives room for the rupiah to strengthen,” said Nurul Eti Nurbaeti, the head of treasury research at PT Bank Negara
 Indonesia  in Jakarta. “We expect it to be temporary, however,
as it isn’t based on fundamentals.”  The rupiah gained 1.2 percent, the most since Sept. 27, to
9,250 per dollar as of 4:06 p.m. in Jakarta, according to prices
from local banks compiled by Bloomberg. The currency reached
9,396 on May 16, the weakest level since February 2010.  One-month implied volatility, which measures exchange-rate
swings used to price options, held at 10 percent for a third
day. The measure rose 450 basis points, or 4.5 percentage
points, this month.  The government’s 7 percent bonds due May 2022 snapped 11
days of losses, with the yield dropping six basis points, or
0.06 percentage point, to 6.54 percent, according to closing
prices from the Inter-Dealer Market Association. The yield
climbed 59 basis points this month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
