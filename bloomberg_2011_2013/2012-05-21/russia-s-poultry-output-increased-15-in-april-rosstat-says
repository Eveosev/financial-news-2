Russia’s production of poultry and
its byproducts increased 15 percent to 280,000 metric tons in
April compared with a year earlier, the Federal State Statistics
Service said.  Pork production rose about 11 percent to 75,000 tons and
beef output fell 8.7 percent to 12,800 tons, the Moscow-based
service, known as Rosstat, said today in an e-mailed statement.
Production of all meats and byproducts, excluding poultry,
gained 5.4 percent to 104,000 tons, it said.  Production of cattle and poultry in so-called live weight,
which includes meat, bones and byproducts, increased 9.1 percent
to 800,000 tons, Rosstat said.  Cattle numbers increased 1.2 percent to 21.2 million
animals by the end of April compared with a year earlier, the
service said. That number included 9.1 million cows. The hog
count rose 3.1 percent to 18.6 million, while sheep and goats
rose 9 percent to 26 million, Rosstat said.  Editors:  To contact the reporter on this story:
