U.S. cornfields are in the best
shape for this time of year since 2007 after warm, dry
weather led to early planting and recent rains gave plants
a good start, the government said. Soybean and wheat
planting moved closer to completion.  About 77 percent of the corn was in good or excellent
condition as of yesterday, the  U.S. Department of
Agriculture  said today in its first assessment of this
yearâ€™s crop. An estimated 96 percent was planted, compared
with 87 percent a week earlier, 75 percent a year earlier
and the previous five-year average of 81 percent. About 76
percent of the seeds had emerged from the ground, up from
56 percent a year ago and the prior five-year average of 48
percent, the USDA said.  About 76 percent of the  soybean  crop was planted,
compared with 46 percent a week earlier and the previous
five-year average of 42 percent, the USDA said. Plant
emergence rose to 35 percent from 10 percent a year
earlier.  Farmers had sown 99 percent of the spring-wheat  crop 
as of yesterday, up from 94 percent a week earlier, the
department said. The average for the date for the previous
five years is 78 percent.  The winter-wheat crop was  rated  58 percent good or
excellent, compared with 60 percent a week earlier and 32
percent a year earlier, after dry, hot weather stunted
growth from  Texas  to  Montana , the USDA said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
