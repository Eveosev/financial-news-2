Cellcom Israel Ltd. (CEL)  rose the most in
two weeks as  Israel ’s largest mobile-phone company was raised to
neutral at I.B.I.-Israel Brokerage & Investments Ltd. after the
shares tumbled 35 percent this month.  The  shares  advanced 0.7 percent, the most since May 7, to
30.80 shekels, at the 4:30 p.m. close in  Tel Aviv . They jumped
as much as 4.4 percent earlier. Cellcom tumbled in May as
competition increased and the company reported a 43 percent drop
in profit.  “The market is pricing a very pessimistic scenario, even
too pessimistic,” Ori Licht the head of research at IBI, said
in an e-mailed note today. He had a sell recommendation on the
shares.  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government is forcing
telecommunication providers to cut fees and is encouraging new
players to the market. Golan Telecom, partly owned by French
entrepreneur Xavier Niel, and Hot Telecommunications System Ltd.
started offering wireless services this month.  Discount Investment Corp. (DISI) , which holds a 47.04 stake in
Cellcom, increased 2.1 percent to 8.98 shekels.  To contact the reporter on this story:
