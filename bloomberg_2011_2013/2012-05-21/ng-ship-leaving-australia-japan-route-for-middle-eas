A ship that normally hauls liquefied
natural gas from Australia to Japan is sailing for the Middle
East, ship-tracking data compiled by Bloomberg show.  The Alto Acrux, owned by  Nippon Yusen K.K. (9101)  and capable of
holding 147,798 cubic meters (5.2 million cubic feet) of the
frozen fuel, is signaling for Das Island in the United Arab
Emirates. In the past year it brought 22 cargoes to Japan from
the Darwin LNG terminal in Australia, ship-tracking data show.  Christina Kavanagh, a spokeswoman for NYK in  London ,
declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
