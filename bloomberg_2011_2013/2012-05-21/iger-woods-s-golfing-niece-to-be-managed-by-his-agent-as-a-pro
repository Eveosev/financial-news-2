Cheyenne Woods  will share the same
agent as her uncle  Tiger Woods  in beginning her professional
golf career.  The younger Woods, who graduated from Wake Forest
University this month after becoming a three-time All-Atlantic
Coast Conference golfer, was signed by agent Mark Steinberg of
Excel Sports Management, the group said on its  website .  A 21-year-old from Phoenix, Cheyenne Woods averaged 73.7
strokes per round during her senior year at the Winston-Salem,
 North Carolina , school. She was named an All-American in 2011
and won two collegiate tournaments during her amateur career.  Woods will seek exemptions to play in LPGA events
throughout this season and attend tour qualifying school late in
the year, Excel said.  Her father, Earl Jr., is the half-brother of Tiger Woods,
the 14-time major champion who is currently  ranked seventh  in
the official world golf ranking.  U.S. PGA Tour member Matt Kuchar also is represented by
Excel, as is 19-year-old LPGA member Danielle Kang, who won the
U.S. Women’s Amateur in 2010 and 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
