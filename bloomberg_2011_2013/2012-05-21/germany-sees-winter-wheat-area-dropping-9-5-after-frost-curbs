Germany â€™s winter-wheat area is 9.5
percent smaller than a year ago after frost curbed plantings,
according to the Federal Statistical Office.  About 2.87 million hectares (7.1 million acres) are under
cultivation, the office in the western city of Wiesbaden said in
a  report  on its website today. The winter barley area shrank 8
percent to 1.08 million hectares.  Spring barley plantings are 30 percent higher than a year
