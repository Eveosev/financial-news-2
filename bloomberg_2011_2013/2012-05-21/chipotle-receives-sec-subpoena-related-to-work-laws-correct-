(Corrects year investigation began in third paragraph of
story published May 18.)  Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc. (CMG) , the
eatery that fired workers when an immigration investigation
began, received a subpoena from the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission regarding work authorizations.  Chipotle received the subpoena yesterday “requesting that
we provide information regarding our compliance with employee
work authorization requirements, our related public statements
and other disclosures, and related information,” the Denver-
based company said in an  SEC filing  today.  Last year, Chipotle said it was working with the criminal
division of the U.S. Attorney’s office in Washington, in
addition to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, to provide
certain documents as part of a review. The burrito chain fired
about 450 workers after an immigration investigation began in
2010 in Minnesota.  The shares  fell  0.6 percent to $392.13 at the close in  New
York . Chipotle has gained 16 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
