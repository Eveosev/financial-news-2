RAG Foundation’s head Wilhelm Bonse-
Geuking said Evonik Industries AG won’t be sold under value,
 Handelsblatt  reported, citing an interview  “If the price, which we consider fair, isn’t reached, the
shares won’t be sold,” Bonse-Geuking was quoted as saying.
There’s a chance few or no shares will reach the market as
capital needs of the foundation have risen in an environment of
lower interest rates, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
