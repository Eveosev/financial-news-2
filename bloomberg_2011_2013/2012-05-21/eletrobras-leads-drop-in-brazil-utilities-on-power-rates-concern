Centrais Eletricas Brasileiras SA (ELET6) 
fell to the lowest in seven years, leading a plunge in Brazilian
utilities, amid concern the government will seek to lower
electricity rates.  Voting shares of Eletrobras, as the largest Brazilian
utility is known, fell 4.7 percent to 18.45 reais at the close
in  Sao Paulo , the worst performer on the benchmark Bovespa
index, which rose 3.8 percent.  CPFL Energia SA (CPFE3)  lost 3.4 percent
to 24.50 reais. The MSCI Brazil/Utilities index slid 3 percent.  Mines and Energy Minister Edison Lobao told newspaper Valor
Economico in June that the government was looking for ways to
lower energy rates. A ministry press official declined to
comment on the matter today. Central bank President Alexandre Tombini told reporters at an event in Sao Paulo today that the
government is studying ways to cut taxes on energy. He didn’t
provide details.  “It is not so simple to understand how new actions from
the government could affect different companies,” Wagner Salaverry, director at Geracao Futuro Corretora, said by phone
from  Porto Alegre . “The impact for distributors would be
different from the impact on power generators, for instance. So
investors get a little cautious.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
