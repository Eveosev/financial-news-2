New Zealand ’s latest budget forecasts
 Europe  sliding into a recession, a downturn that doesn’t appear
deep enough to derail the Pacific nation’s projected 2015
surplus, Prime Minister John Key said.  The Treasury Department’s predictions “already factor in a
good deal of weakness and volatility in Europe, including a
sharp recession across the euro area,” Key told reporters in
Wellington today ahead of the May 24 budget release. “It’s true
the risk of something worse happening in Europe has increased.
We are closely monitoring developments.”  Key’s government is pledging spending restraint to return
to a  budget surplus  in 2014-15 from a record shortfall in the
year ended June 30, 2011. Eliminating deficits will help reduce
debt and preserve the nation’s credit rating, which was cut to
AA by  Standard & Poor’s  in September.  “The last thing we want to do is to abandon that target
unless we really have to,” Key said. “I’ve always said there’s
flexibility there if we absolutely need it and the global
economic situation demands that, but I don’t think that’s the
situation we are facing at the moment.”  Key said Europe has been in situations like this before
without sparking a global slump. New Zealand wants to maintain
its fiscal discipline to stay on the list of nations that are
seen as a good risk, he said.  “I’m as optimistic as you can be” on the outlook for
Europe, he said. “It is more volatile and risky than it was
three months ago. That doesn’t mean the situation won’t blow
over.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
