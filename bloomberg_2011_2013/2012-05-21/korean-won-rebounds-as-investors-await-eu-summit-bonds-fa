South Korea’s won rebounded from a
five-month low and government bonds fell on speculation European
leaders will come up with a strategy to ease the region’s debt
crisis when they meet this week.  German Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  will discuss the
17-nation currency with his French counterpart,  Pierre
Moscovici , today before European Union leaders meet for a summit
in Brussels on May 23. The  Kospi Index (KOSPI)  advanced in line with
regional  stocks , even as overseas investors  cut  their holdings
of Korean shares for a 14th day.  “The won is taking a breather after sharp losses,” said
Han Sung Min, a Seoul-based currency dealer at Busan Bank.
“Some investors think Europe-related negative issues were all
reflected in last week’s declines.”  The won gained 0.3 percent to 1,168.93 per dollar in Seoul,
after sliding 2.2 percent last week, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. The currency touched 1,175.30 on May 18, the
weakest since Dec. 20. One-month implied volatility for the won,
a measure of exchange-rate swings used to price options, climbed
20 basis points, or 0.20 percentage point, to 12.13 percent.  South Korea  has enough foreign-exchange reserves to cope
with the Greek crisis and will take “prompt” action if needed,
Vice Finance Minister Shin Je Yoon said last week. The  reserves 
increased $10.4 billion in the first four months of this year to
$316.8 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Leaders of the Group of Eight nations pushed for Greece to
stay in the euro area during the weekend and supported boosting
growth, even as Germany said  Europe  can’t spend its way out of
the debt crisis.  The yield on South Korea’s 3.25 percent bonds due December
2014 rose one basis point to 3.37 percent, Korea Exchange Inc.
prices show. Three-year debt futures fell 0.08 to 104.47 and the
one-year interest-rate swap climbed one basis point to 3.33
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
