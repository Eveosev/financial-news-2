Wheat futures fell for the first time
in six sessions in  Chicago  after climbing to the highest price
in more than eight months in earlier trading, as rain in Ukraine
and Russia may relieve drought concerns.  July-delivery wheat fell as much as 1.8 percent to $6.8275
a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade and was at $6.8725 at
12:40 p.m. Paris time. The contract earlier rose as high as
$7.22 a bushel, the highest level for the most active contract
since Sept. 13.  Wheat futures jumped 16 percent last week, the most since
the five days ended June 15, 2007, as dry weather threatened to
damage crops in the U.S. and Russia, two of the world’s three
biggest shippers this year.  Russia  and Ukraine will get showers
today and tomorrow, AccuWeather forecast.  “In the past days, numerous regions in Ukraine benefited
from scattered showers,” Paris-based farm adviser Agritel wrote
in a market report today. “These rains should continue in the
coming days and even reach the regions of southwest Russia,
where the production potential so worries the operators.”  Milling wheat for November delivery traded in the French
capital fell 1 percent to 213 euros ($272) a metric ton,
following a 9.7 percent gain last week.  Russia’s total grain harvest may drop 2.7 percent to 91
million metric tons from last month’s forecast of 93.5 million
tons because of drought in southern regions, according to the
Moscow-based Institute for Agricultural Market Studies.  The next wheat harvest in Russia, the world’s third-largest
shipper in 2011-2012, may total 54 million tons because of the
drought and total grain output may drop even further if a lack
of rain persists in the south, the institute, known as Ikar,
said. That compares with the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s
 forecast  of 56 million tons on May 10.  Corn for July delivery was 0.3 percent higher at $6.375 a
bushel, after rising 9.4 percent last week, the biggest weekly
gain for the most-active contract since the five days ended May
20, 2011.  Soybeans for July delivery climbed as much as 1.3 percent
to $14.23 a bushel, after ending little changed last week.
Futures last traded at $14.14.  To contact the reporter on this story:
