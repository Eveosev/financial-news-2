Global sugar supplies will outpace
demand in the season that starts in October in most countries, a
third consecutive surplus, according to Rabobank International.  Production will be 4.6 million metric tons higher than
consumption in 2012-13, the bank estimated in a monthly report
e-mailed today. That would follow surpluses of 8.1 million tons
in the current season and 1.7 million tons in 2010-11. Increased
supplies are likely to result in lower prices, said the bank,
which cut its price forecast for raw sugar in  New York  for the
second quarter to 21.3 cents from 22 cents in an April estimate.  “The fundamental outlook calls for further price downside
to encourage demand to absorb the current and new season
surplus,” wrote Keith Flury, an analyst at the bank in  London .  Global output will fall 0.9 percent in 2012-13 to 177.6
million tons, while consumption is forecast to rise by 1.5
percent to 169.5 million tons, according to the report. Sugar
consumption has been helped by lower prices, the bank said. The
commodity fell 27 percent last year, the most in a decade.  A falling Brazilian real alongside a lower  Indian rupee 
have “insulated the origins from the falling New York futures
prices and lowered support levels,” Flury said.  Brazil  is the
world’s largest sugar producer followed by India.  To contact the reporter on this story:
