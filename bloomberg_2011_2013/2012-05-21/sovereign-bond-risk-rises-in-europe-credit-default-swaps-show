The cost of insuring against default
on European sovereign debt rose for a seventh day, according to
BNP Paribas SA.  The Markit iTraxx SovX Western Europe Index of credit-
default swaps on 15 governments climbed four basis points to 315
at 8:08 a.m. in London, the highest since the current version
started trading in March. An increase signals deterioration in
perceptions of  credit quality .  The cost of insuring corporate debt was little changed,
with the Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 50 companies with
mostly high-yield credit ratings 0.5 basis points lower at
754.5. The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125 companies with
investment-grade ratings was unchanged at 182.5 basis points.  The Markit iTraxx Financial Index linked to senior debt of
25 banks and insurers rose 1.5 basis points to 306.5 and the
subordinated index rose 3.5 to 520.5.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($12.8 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer
face value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
