JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  Chief Executive
OfficerJamie Dimon said the firm doesn’t see any scenario in
which trading losses in its chief investment office would amount
to a disaster.  “We’re looking at all the potential outcomes” from the
unit’s trades, Dimon said at an investor conference today in
lower  Manhattan . “There’s no outcome that will be a disaster
for this company.”  The trade had resulted in about $2 billion in losses as of
May 10, an amount Dimon said at the time could widen by $1
billion this quarter. It remains “very volatile right now,”
though less so than previously, he said today, declining to
answer a question on how large it may get.  “I am not sitting here worried about the ultimate loss on
this thing,” Dimon said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
