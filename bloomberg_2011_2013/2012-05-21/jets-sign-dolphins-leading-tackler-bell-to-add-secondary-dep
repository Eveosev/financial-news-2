The  New York  Jets signed safety
Yeremiah Bell, the Miami Dolphins’ leading tackler the past four
seasons.  Terms weren’t disclosed. The Star-Ledger newspaper reported
it’s a one-year deal worth $1.4 million.  In eight seasons with the Dolphins, Bell has 537 tackles,
11 sacks, eight forced fumbles and six interceptions, according
to a statement distributed by the Jets. A Pro Bowl selection in
2009, he started all 16 games for Miami last season, recording a
team-high 107 tackles with two sacks and one interception.  Bell’s signing comes two months after the Jets added free-
agent safety LaRon Landry. New York is seeking a replacement for
 Jim Leonhard , who missed the final three games last season with
a knee injury. His backup, Brodney Pool, signed with the  Dallas
Cowboys  in March.  Jets safeties combined for three interceptions last season.
Bell, 34, will be reunited with former Dolphins coach Tony Sparano, now New York’s offensive coordinator.  -- Editors: Jay Beberman  To contact the reporter on this story:
