A BP Plc-led group pumped less crude
oil from the Azeri-Chirag-Guneshli field in Azerbaijan’s section
of the  Caspian Sea  in the first quarter than a year earlier.  ACG produced 8.8 million metric tons of oil (711,800
barrels a day), down from 9.6 million tons a year earlier, the
BP office in the Azeri capital of Baku said by e-mail today. It
didn’t give a reason for the decline.  Elshad Nasirov, vice president of State Oil Co. of
Azerbaijan, a partner in ACG, said in a May 1 interview that the
country cut oil output to ensure the peak period of production
continues for the next 10 to 15 years.  The Caspian natural-gas field of Shah Deniz, also operated
by BP, produced 2 billion cubic meters of gas, up from 1.84
billion cubic meters a year earlier, BP said.  Azerbaijan , the third-largest oil producer in the former
 Soviet Union  after Russia and Kazakhstan, pumped 45.6 million
tons of oil and 25.8 billion cubic meters of gas last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
