Taubman Centers Inc. (TCO) , the U.S.
luxury-mall owner, is close to announcing its first retail
investment in China, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Robert Taubman said.  “The growth of retail, the growth of the consumer, is
really on steroids in China,” he said today in an interview at
the International Council of Shopping Centers real estate
conference in Las Vegas. “We’re getting close to an
announcement.”  The company plans to develop retail properties in China as
more people move from rural areas to cities and have more
disposable income. Its Asia unit bought a 90 percent stake in
retail real estate consulting company TCBL Consulting Ltd. for
$23.7 million in December, according to a regulatory  filing  by
Bloomfield Hills, Michigan-based Taubman Centers.  The CEO declined to name the city it’s considering for the
mall project. It’s a large “second-tier” city in central
China, he said.  “Our focus of our efforts is in China and also in Korea,”
Taubman said. “The vast majority of work we do is going to be
in China.”  The company also plans to start construction this year on a
640,000-square-foot (59,000-square-meter) mall in  San Juan ,
 Puerto Rico , and a 900,000-square-foot center in Sarasota,
Florida. Both projects will have luxury retailer  Saks Inc. (SKS)  as an
anchor tenant, according to a regulatory filing.  Taubman rose 1.5 percent to $73.90 at 3:07 p.m. in  New York 
trading.  To contact the reporter on this story:
