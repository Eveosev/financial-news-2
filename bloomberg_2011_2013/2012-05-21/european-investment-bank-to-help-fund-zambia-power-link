The  European Investment Bank  will
provide $30 million toward a $100 million project to boost power
transmission capacity on the Kafue-Livingstone line in Zambia to
360 megawatts from 120 megawatts, it said on its website today.  The Bank did not say whether the money will be provided in
the form of a loan or a grant.  The rest of the money for the project will be provided by
the World Bank and the Zambia Electricity Supply Corp.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
