The Philippines reported a  budget
surplus  in April, reversing a deficit the previous month, after
the government collected more revenue.  The surplus was 31 billion pesos ($718 million), the
government said in an e-mailed statement in Manila today,
compared with a previously reported 28.6 billion peso-deficit
for March. Revenue rose 10.8 percent and spending increased 9.1
percent, the report said.  President  Benigno Aquino  plans to increase spending to a
record this year while seeking $16 billion of investments in
infrastructure projects to boost growth and counter the impact
of Europe’s debt turmoil and China’s slowdown. The government
has stepped up efforts to catch tax evaders and smugglers, and
has drawn up bills aimed at increasing revenue.  “The government has the space to provide pump-priming
measures as downside risks to growth for the region persist,”
Radhika Rao, an economist at Forecast Pte in Singapore, said
before the report. “Any front-loading of expenditure will be
positive for growth and the peso.”  The peso gained 0.2 percent to 43.17 per dollar, according
to Tullett Prebon Plc.  Growth in the $200 billion economy slowed to 3.7 percent
last year from 7.6 percent in 2010. The  World Bank  and the
 International Monetary Fund  have forecast expansion will
accelerate to 4.2 percent in 2012, aided by  government spending .  To contact the reporter on this story:
