Prime Minister  David Cameron  said the
U.K. will pledge 70 million pounds ($110.6 million) a year to
help support the Afghan army after British and allied forces
withdraw all combat troops at the end of 2014  “This is a significant contribution but it is a fraction
of the cost of a combat mission,” Cameron said at a news
conference in  Chicago  as a North Atlantic Treaty Organization
summit was concluding.  Cameron also expressed confidence that negotiations with
Pakistan to reopen NATO supply routes will lead to an agreement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
