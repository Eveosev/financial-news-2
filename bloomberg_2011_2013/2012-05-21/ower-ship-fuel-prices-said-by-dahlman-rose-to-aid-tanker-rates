Lower prices for ship fuel, or
bunkers, are supporting oil-tanker earnings, according to U.S.
investment bank Dahlman Rose & Co.  Hire rates for very large crude carriers, the biggest
vessels hauling the commodity, rose “significantly” for
cargoes loading in West Africa, New York-based analyst  Omar Nokta  said in a report today. The daily cost of chartering a
VLCC to carry crude from the region to the U.S. Gulf Coast
gained about $10,500 a day in the past week to $50,000, he said.  Daily VLCC rates for cargoes to be carried east from the
 Persian Gulf  climbed $3,500 a day to reach $40,000, boosted by a
drop in fuel prices of about $60 a metric ton since the end of
April, according to Nokta. Each VLCC can hold 2 million barrels
of crude.  To contact the reporter on this story:
