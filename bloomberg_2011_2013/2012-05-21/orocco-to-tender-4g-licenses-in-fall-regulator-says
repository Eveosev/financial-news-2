Morocco will launch a tender in the
fall to sell 4G licenses, the Moroccan telecommunication
regulatory agency said on its website, which may allow the entry
of a fourth operator in the market.  The agency will begin in a few weeks designing the
installation of 4G and plans for marketing the service by 2014,
it said.  -- Editors: Digby Lidstone, Andrew J. Barden  To contact the reporter on this story:
