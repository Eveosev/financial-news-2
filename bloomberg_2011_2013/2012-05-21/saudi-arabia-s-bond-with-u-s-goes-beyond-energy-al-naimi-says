The U.S. and  Saudi Arabia  have a
close relationship with a bond “that goes far beyond energy,”
Saudi Oil Minister  Ali al-Naimi  said.  The minister told graduates during his commencement speech
at  Lehigh University  in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, that “We seek
together a world of greater understanding, mutual tolerance, and
respect for human dignity and personal interdependence.”  Al-Naimi, who said he grew up as a nomadic Bedouin, studied
geology and graduated from Lehigh in 1962. The minister said he
was one of a very few Saudis who studied in the U.S., when he
came to Lehigh in 1959. Now, there are thousands, he said.  “I hope my visit here today is a further sign of that
enduring bond between our two peoples,” he said.  Al-Naimi, who will represent OPEC’s biggest oil producer
when the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries meets
next month in Vienna, has said in recent weeks that prices are
too high given that there is no lack of supply.  Brent crude 
should be at around $100 a barrel, he said in Adelaide,
Australia, on May 13.  Brent traded at $108.29 at 12:08 p.m. today on the London-
based ICE Futures Europe exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
