Four men face charges of manipulating
De Beira Goldfields Inc.’s stock price to make 38 million euros
($48.5 millon) in profits, German prosecutors said today.  The men recommended the stock in publications 62 times
between May and June 2006 without disclosing that they also
owned it, Claudia Krauth, a spokeswoman for prosecutors in
Stuttgart said in an e-mailed statement. Within four weeks, the
price rose from 1.40 euros to 18.50 euros and the men sold their
stakes, she said. The suspects weren’t identified.  German prosecutors have been cracking down on fraud with
so-called penny stocks. Munich investigators in March conducted
86 raids in  Germany  and other countries in a similar case.
Earlier this year, they won convictions concerning a scheme
using a newsletter for small investors.  Krauth said the pushing up the price of the De Beira
Goldfields stock plot came from a 32-year-old Austria-based
public relations manager and a 33-year-old Canadian accomplice.  The pair enlisted a 46-year-old German journalist from the
state of Baden-Wuerttemberg and a 39-year-old business manager
from Bavaria.  All the men except the Canadian, who is in custody, admit
taking part in the scheme to boost the price of the mineral
exploration company, according to Krauth. Austria has so far
denied a request to extradite the public-relations manager, she
said. De Beira Goldfields changed its name to  Panex Resources
Inc. (DBGF)  in September 2010.  To contact the reporters on this story:
