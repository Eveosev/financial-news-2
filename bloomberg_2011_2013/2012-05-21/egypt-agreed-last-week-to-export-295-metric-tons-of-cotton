Egypt  agreed in the week through May
17 to export 295 metric tons of cotton, the Alexandria Cotton
Exporters Association said today in its weekly bulletin.  The country has shipped 73,716 tons of cotton, valued at
$231.7 million, since the marketing year began last Sept. 1. Of
last week’s agreed sales, the Giza 88 variety accounts for 145
tons and Giza 86 for 150 tons, the association said.  Egypt produces the world’s finest extra-long staple cotton,
which is stronger and softer than shorter staple cotton, and is
used in high-quality clothing. Switzerland, Bangladesh and  India 
are the top importers of Egyptian cotton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
