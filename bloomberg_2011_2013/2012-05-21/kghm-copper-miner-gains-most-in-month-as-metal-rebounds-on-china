KGHM Polska Miedz SA (KGH) , the copper
producer with the biggest European mine output, climbed the most
in almost a month as the metal advanced after the Chinese
government pledged to focus more on spurring growth.  The shares jumped as much as 2.6 percent, the steepest gain
since April 24, and traded 1.8 percent higher at 121.5 zloty as
of 9:37 a.m. in Warsaw.  The metal for three-month delivery rose 1.2 percent to
$7,745 per metric ton on the London Metal Exchange after Chinese
Premier Wen Jiabao said over the weekend the government will
focus more on bolstering economic growth, boosting demand from
the worldâ€™s biggest consumer of industrial metals.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
