Dutch state guarantees on mortgages
may be limited to first-time buyers and other borrowers who
couldn’t purchase a home otherwise,  Het Financieele Dagblad 
reported, citing the head of the fund that administers the plan.  Stricter conditions would cut reliance on state guarantees
by half, Karel Schiffer said in an interview with the newspaper.
The Dutch state backs loans worth almost 140 billion euros ($180
billion), or about 70 percent of the market for mortgages of as
much as 350,000 euros, the program’s upper limit, Dagblad said.  The measures, which Schiffer said should be implemented
over a three-year period, would require the approval of the
Dutch cabinet and parliament, according to to the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
