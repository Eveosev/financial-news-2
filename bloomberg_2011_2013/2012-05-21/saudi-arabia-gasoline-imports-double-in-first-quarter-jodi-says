Saudi Arabia ’s gasoline imports
doubled in the first quarter as two of the kingdom’s refineries
were shut for planned maintenance, according to the Joint
Organization Data Initiative.  Saudi Arabia imported 81,000 barrels a day of gasoline in
the first three months of the year, up from 40,000 barrels a
year earlier, according to government data posted yesterday on
the website of the group known as JODI. Shipments rose to
104,000 barrels a day in January, the highest level since July
2010, the data show.  Saudi Arabian Oil Co. completed maintenance at  Ras Tanura ,
its largest refinery, in the middle of April, according to three
people familiar with the matter. Its Riyadh facility was
scheduled to halt in January.  JODI is overseen by the Riyadh-based International Energy
Forum, an organization that promotes discussions between 86
producing and consuming nations on international  energy
security .  To contact the reporter on this story:
