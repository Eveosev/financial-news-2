RioZim Ltd. (RIOTZ) , a Zimbabwean miner of
coal, gold and nickel, has delayed its annual general meeting
scheduled for tomorrow because its financial reports haven’t
been completed, the Zimbabwe Stock Exchange said.  There may also be “possible adjustments and or re-
classification resulting from information that has recently come
to light,” the Harare-based bourse said in an e-mailed
statement today without giving further details.  Calls to RioZim’s Harare headquarters weren’t answered when
Bloomberg News sought comment today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
