Warsaw Stock Exchange today. Stock symbols follow company names.  Bank Pekao SA (PEO)  , Poland’s second-largest lender,
jumped 2.6 percent to 136.4 zloty, the biggest gain since April

Rzeczpospolita. PKO Bank Polski SA (PKO PW), Poland’s biggest

biggest consumer of the metal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
