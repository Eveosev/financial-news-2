Switzerland ’s  consumer confidence 
increased to the highest in a year in April, as households grew
more optimistic about the economy and the labor market.  An index, based on a quarterly telephone survey, rose to
minus 8 from minus 19 in January, the  State Secretariat for
Economic Affairs  in Bern said in an e-mailed statement today.
Economists forecast a gain to minus 15, according to the  median 
of 11 estimates in a Bloomberg News survey.  Consumers are growing more confident as the economy shows
signs of regaining some strength, with companies including Cie.
Financiere Richemont SA, the second-largest luxury goods maker,
beating earnings estimates. The  International Monetary Fund  on
May 8 forecast growth to accelerate to 1.7 percent in 2013 from
0.8 percent this year, partly as consumers step up spending.  “These are very good numbers indeed, especially where the
economic outlook and expectations for the labor market are
concerned,” said  Reto Huenerwadel , a senior economist at UBS AG
in Zurich. “Confidence is also supported by an increase in real
income for consumers and a stable labor market.”  A sub-indicator of consumers’ assessment of the economic
situation over the coming year rose to minus 2 from minus 29 in
January and households also grew more confident about job
prospects, the statement showed. A measure of expected cost
developments over the coming 12 months rose to 34 from 25,
indicating more people project higher prices.  To contact the reporters on this story:
