The Serbian dinar weakened to a
record low against the euro, the biggest drop in three months,
after voters ousted President  Boris Tadic  in yesterday’s runoff
election.  The dinar depreciated as much as 1 percent to 114.4861 per
euro and traded 0.7 percent lower at 114.1976 by 4:56 p.m. in
Belgrade, the biggest slump on a closing basis since Feb. 24.
The BELEX15  index  of shares fell 1.3 percent to 469.30, the
steepest decline since April 17.  Tadic, who secured the Balkan nation’s candidacy to join
the European Union, lost to  Tomislav Nikolic , who advocated
closer economic ties with Russia, according to results from the
Electoral Committee. Nikolic’s victory may unnerve investors
with his “more nationalist” tone, Timothy Ash, head of
emerging-market research at Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc in
 London , said in a note to clients.  “The election of opposition rightist leader Nikolic
against incumbent president Tadic generates uncertainties
regarding the county’s political stability and economic
policies,”  Benoit Anne , London-based global head of emerging-
market research at Societe Generale SA, and colleagues wrote in
a research report today. The election outcome is “not
supportive” for the dinar in the short term, Anne said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
