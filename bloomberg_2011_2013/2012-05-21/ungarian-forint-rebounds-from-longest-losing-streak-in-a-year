The forint rebounded from the longest
losing streak in a year and  Hungary ’s government bonds gained as
 China  signaled it would support its economy and German and
French officials prepared to meet before a summit.  Hungary’s currency appreciated 0.3 percent to 297.4 per
euro by 2:45 p.m. in Budapest. The forint depreciated for six
days through May 18, the longest such series since April 2011.
The government’s benchmark 10-year  bonds  strengthened for a
second day, cutting yields 3 basis points, or 0.03 percentage
point, to 8.492 percent.  Demand for riskier assets rose after Chinese Premier Wen
Jiabao’s pledge to focus more on bolstering growth spurred
speculation the government will step up efforts to combat a
slowdown in the world’s second-largest economy. German Finance
Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble will, for the first time, discuss
the euro at a meeting with his newly installed French
counterpart,  Pierre Moscovici , in Berlin today as European Union
leaders prepare to meet in Brussels on May 23.  To contact the reporter on this story:
