smartphone maker said some products were delivered to customers
after passing U.S. customs inspection. The U.S. availability of

said in a statement on May 16.  Motech Industries Inc. (6244)  (6244 TT) surged 4.9 percent to
NT$47.60, the highest close since April 16. A U.S. anti-dumping
tariff will have no impact on the company as products from its
 China  plants are mostly sold in Europe and China, the  Central
News Agency  reported. Chief Financial Officer Jack Hsieh wasn’t
immediately available for comment at his office. The U.S.
Commerce Department ruled last week that Chinese companies sold
silicon-based solar cells at prices below cost and announced

percent to NT$35.20. Chief Financial Officer Everett Chu said
