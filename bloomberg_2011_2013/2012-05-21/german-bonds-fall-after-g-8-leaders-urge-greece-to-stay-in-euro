German bonds fell, pushing 10-year
yields up from an all-time low, amid speculation European
officials are moving closer to new measures to fight the spread
of the region’s debt crisis.  Benchmark bunds had their first back-to-back decline in
almost a month after Group-of-Eight leaders urged  Greece  to stay
in the euro and supported boosting growth. Italian notes rose as
German and French officials meet before a summit of regional
leaders on May 23. Irish two-year yields climbed to the highest
in four months even as the central bank head said it was a
“huge leap” to assume the nation would seek a new bailout.  “At the G-8 meeting the euro zone was one of the key
talking points, so it seems as though leaders are acknowledging
the scale of the problem and markets are moving on anticipation
we may see some sort of proactive action,” said  Brian Barry , an
analyst at Investec Bank Plc in London. “With bund yields at
such low levels, if there are any signs of a proactive change
you are likely to see some sharp moves.”  The 10-year bund yield rose two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 1.45 percent at 4:01 p.m. London time after
falling to a record 1.396 percent on May 18. The 1.75 percent
security due in July 2022 dropped 0.2, or 2 euros per 1,000-euro
($1,276) face amount, to 102.83.  ‘Cohesive Euro Zone’  German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  and French President
 Francois Hollande  are seeking to balance  France ’s desire to
jumpstart growth with  Germany ’s preference for spending cuts as
a way of resolving the debt crisis.  “We agree on the importance of a strong and cohesive euro
zone for global stability and recovery, and we affirm our
interest in Greece remaining in the euro zone while respecting
its commitments,” the G-8 said in a statement on May 19.  Italian bonds advanced on optimism the European leaders
meeting this week will make progress on containing the debt
crisis. The two-year note  yield  dropped three basis points to
3.72 percent, and 10-year yields declined three basis points to
5.78 percent.  Irish two-year notes fell for a 12th day even after central
bank Governor  Patrick Honohan  said “Plan A is still a good
one,” referring to the nation’s intention to exit its 67.5
billion-euro bailout at the end of 2013.  External factors are pushing up the cost of purchasing the
country’s debt in secondary markets, Honohan said, adding that
he hopes market conditions will improve “in time.”  Ireland’s two-year note yield climbed 17 basis points to
7.37 percent.  Belgian Auction  Belgian bonds advanced as the country sold 2.55 billion
euros of bonds maturing between June 2017 and March 2026.  The debt agency said it sold 1.015 billion euros of bonds
due in September 2022 at an average yield of 3.453 percent, down
from 3.737 percent at the most recent auction of the securities
on Feb. 27.  Belgium ’s benchmark 10-year yield dropped five basis points
to 3.28 percent after earlier climbing to 3.39 percent, the
highest level since April 27.  Germany’s two-, five-, 10- and 30-year yields fell to
records last week after Moody’s Investors Service lowered the
credit ratings of 16 Spanish banks, citing economic weakness and
the government’s mounting budget strain.  Spain  revised up its 2011  budget deficit  to 8.9 percent of
gross domestic product after accounting for the unpaid bills of
regional governments, the Budget Ministry said on May 18.  ‘Natural Appetite’  “The underlying problems in the euro zone will stay so
there will be a natural appetite for core bonds, at least for
the next few weeks,” saidPiet Lammens, head of research at KBC
Bank NV in Brussels. “Markets will be sidelined, and will wait
for Wednesday.”  Volatility on Ireland’s bonds was the highest in euro-area
markets followed by  Portugal , according to measures of 10-year
bonds, two- and 10-year yield spreads and credit-default swaps.  German debt has returned 2.9 percent this year, according
to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European Federation of
Financial Analysts Societies. Spanish bonds have lost 3.4
percent, and Italian debt gained 8.1 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
