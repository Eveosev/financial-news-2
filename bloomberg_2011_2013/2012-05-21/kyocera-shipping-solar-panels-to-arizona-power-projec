Kyocera Corp. (6971) , the Japanese
electronics company, began shipments of 34 megawatts of solar
panels for a 127-megawatt project in southwest  Arizona .  The company’s Kyocera Solar unit expects to complete the
order for the Arlington Valley Solar Energy II project in March,
Kyoto-based Kyocera said today in a statement.  LS Power Group is developing the solar farm, which will
span about 1,160 acres (469 hectares) and is scheduled to begin
producing electricity late next year.  Sempra Energy (SRE) ’s San Diego
Gas & Electric will purchase the power.  Kyocera is making the panels at its San Diego factory. The
statement didn’t identify other suppliers for the project.  To contact the reporter on this story:
