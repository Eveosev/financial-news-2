Syngenta AG (SYNN) , the world’s largest
crop-chemical business, will invest $500 million in Africa over
the next 10 years, with most of that earmarked for  South Africa ,
Business Day reported, citing Jan Suter, head of the company’s
Africa and Middle East operations.  The company will make acquisitions or partner local
companies to enter the seed market in the country and may
consider a deal with Pannar Seed (Pty) Ltd., the Johannesburg-
based newspaper cited Suter as saying. Pannar is appealing the
South African Competition Tribunal’s decision to prohibit a
merger with Hi-Bred International Inc.  To contact the reporters on this story:
