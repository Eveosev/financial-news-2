GSW Immobilien AG (GIB) , the German real
estate company formerly owned by Cerberus Capital Management LP
and funds managed by  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) , said first-
quarter profit increased on rising rents and lower vacancies.  Adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and
amortization climbed to 33.3 million euros ($43 million) from
28.8 million euros a year earlier, the Berlin-based company said
today in a statement. GSW said 2012 funds from operations
excluding divestments will be 59 million euros to 63 million
euros, confirming a previous statement.  Rental income rose to 39.7 million euros from 34.8 million,
while the vacancy rate fell 11 percent to 3.3 percent, the
company said. Without adjusting for the sale of cable-television
provider BMH Berlin Mediahaus GmbH for 25.4 million euros last
year, net income fell to 8.7 million euros, or 21 cents a share,
from 33.2 million euros, or 95 cents, a year earlier.  GSW, which operates only in Berlin, owns 53,000 apartments
valued at about 2.9 billion euros and manages 17,400 units for
third parties, according to its latest quarterly report. The
company will increase the number of homes it owns by as much as
13 percent this year to take advantage of the rising rents,
Chief Executive Officer Thomas Zinnoecker said May 9.  In its initial public offering in April 2011, GSW raised
about 468 million euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
