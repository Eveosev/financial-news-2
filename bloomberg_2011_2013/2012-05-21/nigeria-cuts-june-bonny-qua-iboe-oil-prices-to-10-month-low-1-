selling price for Bonny Light and Qua Iboe crudes to a 10-month
low, according to the Nigerian National Petroleum Corp.  The price for the two benchmark blends will be 60 cents
less than in May at a premium of $2.00 a barrel to Dated Brent,
the lowest since August, the state oil company said today in an
e-mailed price list.  The following table shows the selling prices of crudes from
