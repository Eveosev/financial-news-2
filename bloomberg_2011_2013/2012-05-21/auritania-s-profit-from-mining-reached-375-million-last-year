Mining in Mauritania earned the
country $375 million last year, including $281 million from
sales of iron ore, Oil, Energy and Mines Minister Taleb Ould
Abdivall said in an interview yesterday on state-owned
television.  Mauritania granted seven oil-exploration licenses which
generated $30 million after changes to the country’s oil code
were made at the end of 2011, he said.  Production at the offshore Chinguitt oil field is 8,000
barrels to 9,000 barrels a day and it has potential of 120
million tons during its life span, the minister said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
