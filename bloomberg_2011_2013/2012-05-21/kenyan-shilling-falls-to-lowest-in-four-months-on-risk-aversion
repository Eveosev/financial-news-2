Kenya ’s shilling retreated, heading
for its lowest level in more than four months, after risk-averse
investors bought dollars and yields on local debt fell.  The currency of East Africa’s biggest economy depreciated
as much as 0.5 percent and traded 0.1 percent weaker at 84.38
per dollar by 2:30 p.m. in Nairobi, the lowest since Jan 30.  “The shilling is under sustained pressure largely due to
the unresolved euro crisis and preference for safer assets,”
Bernard Matimu, chief dealer at Nairobi based  NIC Bank Ltd. (NICB) ,
said in a phone interview today.  The euro has lost 3.5 percent against the  U.S. dollar  this
month and almost $4 trillion has been wiped from equity markets
amid concerns over  Greece . German Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  said on May 18, the turmoil could last another two
years.  Kenya has lowered its local borrowing target to 62.1
billion shillings ($735 million) from 119.5 billion shillings
for the fiscal year ending June 30, replacing shilling-
denominated financing with a $600 million syndicated loan
arranged by Citigroup Inc.,  South Africa ’s Standard Bank Group
Ltd. and London-based Standard Chartered Plc.  Kenya’s three- and six-month yields fell for the 18th
straight week after the government halved borrowing. The yield
on 91-day Treasury bills declined to 10.075 percent at a sale
May 17 from 20.799 percent tagged on similar-maturity debt sold
Jan 12. On 182-day bills, borrowing costs slid to 12.078 percent
on May 16 from 20.914 percent realized on Jan 23, according to
the central bank’s  website .  Repo Auctions  Kenya’s central bank accepted 5.5 billion shillings of bids
for  repurchase agreements  at a weighted average rate of 17.636
percent after offering 10 billion shillings of the securities, a
Kenyan central bank official, who declined to be identified in
line with policy, commented in a phone interview today from
Nairobi, the capital. The central bank has withdrawn 40.8
billion shillings through repo auctions since May 2, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Tanzania’s shilling rose 0.1 percent to 1,583.50 per
dollar, while the Ugandan shilling appreciated 0.2 percent to
2,469 per dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
