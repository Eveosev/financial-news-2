Lance Armstrong  won his first Half
Ironman triathlon race in Florida, where the seven-time  Tour de
France  cycling champion finished more than 11 minutes ahead of
the runner-up.  It was the fourth event at the 70.3-mile (113-kilometer)
distance for the 40-year-old Armstrong, who is seeking to
qualify for the Ironman World Championship after quitting
professional cycling in February 2011. He finished second in his
Ironman debut in Panama in February, was seventh in Galveston,
Texas, in April and placed third in St. Croix last month.  Armstrong, who competed as a professional triathlete at age
18 before focusing on cycling, was in fifth place after the 1.2-
mile swim yesterday and took the lead about 20 miles into the
56-mile ride. He stayed in front throughout the 13.1-mile run to
finish in a time of 3 hours, 45 minutes and 38 seconds.  “I can’t deny or lie that I didn’t want to come back to
the sport and win some races,” Armstrong said, according to
 Ironman’s website . “I wasn’t sure what I was getting myself
into in  Panama , but in Galveston and St. Croix I wanted to be in
contention for the win and I wasn’t there.”  Maxim Kriat of  Ukraine  finished second to Armstrong in a
time of 3:56.56.  Armstrong, who won the Tour de  France  -- cycling’s most
prestigious race -- each year from 1999 to 2005, will next
compete in a 70.3-mile Ironman event in Hawaii on June 2. He’s
also scheduled to race a 140.6-mile full Ironman event June 24
in Nice, France, in his quest to earn enough points to qualify
for the World Championship in Hawaii on Oct. 13.  To contact the reporter on this story:
