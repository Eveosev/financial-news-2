Egypt ’s Criminal Court sentenced 12
people to  life imprisonment  for their involvement in last year’s
sectarian clashes in Abu Qurqas village which left three dead,
the state-run Middle East News Agency reported.  Eight of the 20 accused were acquitted of charges of
murder, creating sectarian sedition, possessing weapons and
endangering public peace, the news service provider said.  The clashes took place in April last year following a
dispute between Muslims and Christians in the community in
Egypt’s southern Minya province. The clashes, which erupted
after a collision between two cars, also left four people
injured, and those involved set fire to a number of houses.  To contact the reporter on this story:
