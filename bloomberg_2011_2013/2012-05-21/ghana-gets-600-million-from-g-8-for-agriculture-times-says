Ghana  will receive $600 million from
the Group of Eight countries to boost its agricultural output
over five years, the Ghanaian Times newspaper reported.  The amount represents Ghana’s share of a $3 billion
Alliance for Food Security and Nutrition Fund being championed
by the G-8 countries, the Accra-based newspaper said, citing
Ghana’s minister of food and agriculture, Kwesi Ahwoi.  The West African nation will use the money to implement its
medium-term agriculture investment plan, the newspaper said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
