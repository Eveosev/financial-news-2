OAO Rosneft,  Russia ’s biggest oil
producer, fell to a two-week low as MSCI Inc. canceled a
decision to increase the stock’s weighting in its Russia Index.  Rosneft dropped 1.4 percent to 194.99 rubles by the close
in Moscow, the lowest level since May 8. The 30-stock Micex
Index added 2.1 percent to 1,298.42.  MSCI will not increase Rosneft’s weighting until the
results of the company’s share buyback are known, MSCI said in
an e-mailed statement May 18. The company would have become the
fourth-biggest Russian stock on the index with a 6.4 percent
 weighting , according to a copy of MSCI’s initial report, e-
mailed on May 16.  “The uncertainty that has re-emerged is clearly
technically negative for Rosneft,” VTB Capital analysts led by
Alexey Zabotkin said in an e-mailed note today. The company had
been the “undisputed leader in this MSCI 10/40 race,” they
wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
