Siemens AG (SIE)  won an order to supply 115
megawatts of turbines for a project north of Santiago that will
be  Chile ’s largest wind farm when built.  Siemens will deliver, install and commission 50 turbines
at the El Arrayan park that’s being developed by Pattern Energy
Group LP, a San Francisco-based renewables company, and Houston-
based utility AEI, according to a statement today.  The order is the first wind-power deal for Munich-based
Siemens in Chile.  Europe ’s biggest engineering company joins
turbine makers such as Vestas Wind Systems A/S and Xinjiang
Goldwind Science & Technology Co in expanding in the nation
that’s seeking to boost renewables to curb reliance on
hydroelectric power.  “It is our goal to grow our presence in this region,”
Felix Ferlemann, chief executive officer of Siemens Wind Power,
said in the statement.  The mining unit of Antofagasta Plc, the Chilean group with
three copper mines, also has a stake in the project, according
to Siemens. Commissioning of the park 400 kilometers (249 miles)
north of the capital city of Santiago on the coast of the
Coquimbo IV Region is planned in early 2014. The project will
provide power for about 200,000 households when built, according
to Siemens.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
