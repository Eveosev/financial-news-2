OAO Mobile TeleSystems,  Russia â€™s
biggest mobile operator, raised first-quarter profit 59 percent
from a year earlier, beating estimates, as it cut financing
costs and payments to dealers and benefited from ruble gains.  Net income climbed to $512 million from $322 million a year
earlier, MTS, as the company is known, said today in a
statement. That beat the average estimate of $395 million of
nine analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Revenue rose 2.7 percent to $3.01 billion, the company
said. Revenue may rise 5 percent to 7 percent this year, Chief
Executive Officer Andrei Dubovskov said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
