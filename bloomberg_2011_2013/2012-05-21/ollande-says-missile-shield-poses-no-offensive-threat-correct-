 French President  Francois Hollande 
put his support behind a NATO missile defense system, saying it
poses no threat to other nations.  Hollande dismissed Russian objections and reversed his
“reticent” about the defense shield that he expressed during
his campaign for the presidency. At a summit of the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization in Chicago today, Hollande said his
concerns have been addressed.  He said the missile defense will complement nuclear
deterrence, there will be proper “political control,” French
industries will have a direct interest and costs will be
secured.  “I may that add that it is out of question for some
countries to feel threatened by this system, I am thinking to
Russia and the dialogue with  Russia  will have to continue,”
Hollande said at a news conference.  The U.S. says the missile defense system is intended to
guard against attacks from rogue states such as Iran. Russian
President  Vladimir Putin , who returned to the Kremlin for a
third term this month, opposes the U.S. plans to house parts of
a missile shield in eastern  Europe .  France, the U.K. and the U.S. are the three NATO-member
countries that have nuclear deterrence as a defense strategy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
