An Olympic torch achieved a price of
150,400 pounds ($238,000) on EBay as relay runners in the
buildup to the London games look to raise funds or cash in on
their participation.  Sophia Cowburn carried the Olympic flame on May 19 through
Liskeard, a town in southwestern  England . She bought the torch,
which sells for 199 pounds, and then decided to sell it on to
raise funds for the Invictus Trust, which helps teenagers with
mental-health problems.  The flame arrived in the U.K. from  Greece  on May 18, and
will be carried by 8,000 people in a relay that will take it
within 10 miles of 95 percent of the population. It will reach
the Olympic Stadium on the evening of July 27 for the opening
ceremony. Each runner can buy their torch. The bidding for
Cowburn’s started at 200 pounds on May 20, and went over 150,000
pounds in the last five minutes before the auction ended
yesterday.  “The torches are the torchbearers’ to do what they want
with,” London games organizers said today in an e-mailed
statement. “We hope they find a good home.”  Cowburn said on the EBay page that the money would go to
the Invictus charity.  At least three other torches are being sold on the Internet
site.  One , being sold with an official stand, has a starting bid
of 100,000 pounds, with offers being accepted until 10:38 p.m.
U.K. time today. No one has met the offer price.  Another torch  and an official uniform were being sold,
although no one had offered the starting bid of 95,000 pounds.  A third torch had one bid of 20,100 pounds at 4:20 p.m.
local time. It had about six hours to run.  To contact the reporter on this story:
