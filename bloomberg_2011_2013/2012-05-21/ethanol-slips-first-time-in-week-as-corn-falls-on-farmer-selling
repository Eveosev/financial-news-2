Ethanol slipped for the first time in
a week as corn declined on speculation that farmers will sell
reserves of the grain.  Futures dropped on speculation the highest average U.S.
 cash price for corn  in two months will prompt farmers to let go
of inventories, easing production costs for the biofuel.  “Ethanol was just down a little bit today,” said Matt Janney, a trader at Citigroup Global Markets Inc. in Chicago.
“Looking at cash corn, we’ll probably see some farmer
selling.”  Denatured ethanol for June delivery fell 0.5 cent to settle
at $2.212 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade, the first
decline since May 14. Ethanol has fallen 17 percent in the past
year.  In cash market trading, ethanol in  New York  increased 2
cents, or 0.9 percent, to $2.255 a gallon and in the U.S. Gulf
the additive rose 2 cents, or 0.9 percent, to $2.26, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol in  Chicago  gained 1.5 cents, or 0.7 percent, to
$2.19 a gallon and on the West Coast the biofuel slipped 0.5
cent to $2.35.  Corn for July delivery sank 2.5 cents, or 0.4 percent, to
$6.33 a bushel in Chicago. One bushel makes at least 2.75
gallons of ethanol.  To contact the reporter on this story:
