Former West Virginia University
football coach Bill Stewart died of a heart attack, the school
said on its website. He was 59.  Stewart was playing golf yesterday when he collapsed,
according to Clarksburg, West Virginia-based  WBOY-TV .  Stewart became the university’s interim head coach late in
the 2007 season after  Rich Rodriguez ’s departure, and received
the job outright after leading the team to a Fiesta Bowl
victory. He was 27-12 in three seasons with the team, and
resigned last June following reports that he asked members of
the media to “dig up dirt” on his successor, Dana Holgorsen.  Holgorsen had been hired by West Virgina as offensive
coordinator and head coach-in-waiting while Stewart was to serve
his final season in 2011.  Stewart also coached at the Virginia Military Institute and
served as an assistant at Air Force,  Arizona  State, North
Carolina, Navy, William & Mary and Marshall.  He is survived by his wife, Karen, and son, Blaine, WBOY
