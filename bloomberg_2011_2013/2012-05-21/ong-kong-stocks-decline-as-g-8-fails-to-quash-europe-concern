Hong Kong stocks  fell for a fourth
day after a gathering of the leaders of the Group of Eight
nations failed to deliver a unified strategy to quell the
European debt crisis.  The  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  declined 0.3 percent to 18,887.66 at
9:30 a.m. local time. The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index of
mainland stocks advanced less than 0.1 percent to 9.581.94 after
Chinaâ€™s Premier  Wen Jiabao  said the government will focus more
on supporting economic growth, fueling speculation that monetary
policy will be further eased.  To contact the reporter on this story:
