Hong Kong ’s most-popular initial
public offerings among retail investors since the start of 2010
have plunged an average of 54 percent from their offer price and
trail returns of the city’s IPOs.  The CHART OF THE DAY shows the 54 percent slump by the 10
companies with the most orders from individuals relative to
stock available, against an average 7 percent drop by the 10
most-undersubscribed IPOs and a 13 percent decline for all 186
companies completing Hong Kong IPOs. The data, showing returns
through May 18, are compiled by Bloomberg and Computershare Hong
Kong Investor Services Ltd. By contrast, the 435 IPOs in the U.S.
generated a loss of 5 percent in the same period.  “Retail investors are easily driven by  market sentiment 
and may crowd into over-priced deals if recent IPOs have been
profitable,” said Pamela Chung, managing director of
Computershare, a share registry that handled IPO applications
accounting for 90 percent of Hong Kong’s deal flow in the last
three years. “They may stay away from good deals if people
recently got burned.”  Milan Station Holdings Ltd. (1180) ’s May 2011 share sale drew the
highest IPO subscription rate in Hong Kong’s history, five weeks
after the benchmark  Hang Seng Index  rose to a two-month high.
The retailer of used handbags lured orders from individuals
worth about HK$59 billion ($7.6 billion), or 2,180 times the
HK$27 million of shares available, the data show. Shares in the
company, which issued a profit warning last month, plunged 54
percent since their debut through last week.  Citic Securities Co. (6030) , the biggest Chinese brokerage, is the
best performer among the 10 deals that drew the lightest demand
from individuals. The company received orders covering just 9
percent of the HK$660 million of stock available to retail
investors. The stock has rallied 13 percent since its Oct. 6
debut, which was two days after the  Hang Seng  fell to its lowest
level in more than two years.  The 10 most-popular IPOs received orders for 342 times to
2,180 times the stock available on these transactions, while
individual buyers ordered 2 percent to 23 percent of the shares
available on the least popular offers. The average size of a
Hong Kong IPO fell to $138 million this year, the smallest in
nine years, Bloomberg data show. That compares with $301 million
last year and $609 million in 2010.  To contact the reporters on this story:
