Turkish authorities foiled a plan to
kidnap the rebel Free Syrian Army’s founder and chief from a
refugee camp, Milliyet  reported .  Two Turks were collaborating with a Syrian spy to abduct
Riad al-Asaad, a former colonel in President Bashar al-Assad’s
army who fled to  Turkey  and started an opposition force,
according to the Istanbul-based newspaper. The three people
accused of planning the kidnapping were detained and freed
pending trial, Milliyet said, citing police and court records.  Turkey’s intelligence organization reportedly prevented
efforts to kidnap senior Syrian opposition commanders earlier
this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
