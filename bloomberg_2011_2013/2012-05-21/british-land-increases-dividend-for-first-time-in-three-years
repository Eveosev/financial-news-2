British Land Co. (BLND) , the U.K.’s second-
largest real estate investment trust, raised its quarterly
dividend for the first time in three years and indicated that
similar payouts will follow.  The company increased the  dividend  for its fourth quarter
through March to 6.6 pence a share and said it would stay at
that level in the coming fiscal year. London-based British Land
had paid 6.5 pence in the 12 preceding quarters.  “Good results today and confidence about future income”
prompted the increase, Chief Executive Officer Chris Grigg said
on a conference call today.  Full-year profit excluding one-time items and changes to
property values rose 3.9 percent to 265 million pounds ($419
million), or 29.7 pence a share. Net rental income excluding
acquisitions gained by 1.5 percent and the company reached
agreements with UBS AG, Debenhams Plc and Aon Corp. to lease
space in three of its central London office projects.  “British Land is firing on all cylinders,” Jefferies
Group Inc. analysts  Mike Prew  and  Robert Duncan  said in a note
to investors, reiterating their buy rating of the shares.  British Land rose 0.6 percent to 491.4 pence in London
trading at 491 pence as of 9:40 a.m. That gives the company a
market value of 4.37 billion pounds. The shares have advanced
6.9 percent in the six months through Friday, less than the 11-
member FTSE 350 Real Estate Investment Trust Index’s 8.6 percent
gain.  The company leased 5 million square feet (465,000 square
meters) of space in fiscal 2012, cut vacancies and charged more
to renew leases and rent new retail and office space.
It also made 371 million pounds of acquisitions, including 17
Virgin Active fitness centers, which generated additional
income.  Offices vs Retail  While operating earnings improved, net asset value
stagnated in the second half as gains on office developments
were matched by a drop in retail property values.  Net asset value  rose to 595 pence a share in the company’s
fiscal fourth quarter from 593 pence three months earlier,
company said in a statement today. Net income for the 12 months
through March fell to 480 million pounds from 840 million pounds
a year earlier the value of its real estate grew more slowly.  Britain entered a  double dip recession  in the first
quarter, making it harder for landlords to demand higher rents
and leading appraisers to lower the estimated values of shopping
centers. That was partly offset by rising values for office
developments in central  London , where British Land plans to
build 2.2 million square feet of space through 2014.  Retail makes up 61 percent of British Land’s real estate.
Big-box retail warehouses depreciated by 0.7 percent and
shopping centers by 0.6 percent in the second half of the
company’s financial year, reducing the value of British Land’s
retail assets to 6.32 billion pounds, the company said today.  Offices appreciated by 2.1 percent in the fiscal second
half, the company said.  Net debt  fell to 4.88 billion pounds from 4.91 billion
pounds three months earlier. Debt represented 45.3 percent of
the value of British Land’s real estate, from 45.6 percent at
the end of December.  To contact the reporter on this story:
