Germany ’s Ver.di labor union called
for a second round of strikes over pay at the nation’s banks,
starting May 23 in southern cities including Stuttgart,
Karlsruhe and Mannheim.  Ver.di is calling for a 6 percent wage increase as well as
other benefits such as better health care. On May 4, the union
rejected a 4.3 percent offer by the banks as “entirely
insufficient”.  “The offers made by the employers are not acceptable
looking at the wage deals in other sectors”, Rosemarie Bolte,
who leads the negotiations for Ver.di, said in the statement.  Ver.di represents 220,000 bank employees and workers from
Germany’s private and publicly owned banks. Among those asked to
strike were employees of  Commerzbank AG (CBK) ,  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) ,
Wuestenrot Bausparkasse, LBBW and Bausparkasse Schwaebisch Hall.  To contact the reporter on this story:
