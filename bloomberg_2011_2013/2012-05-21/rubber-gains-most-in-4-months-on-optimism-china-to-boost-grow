Rubber advanced by the most in four
months on optimism that  China  will boost economic growth,
improving demand for the commodity used for tires.  October-delivery rubber rose as much as 3.7 percent, the
biggest gain since Jan. 17, to 279.9 yen a kilogram ($3,531 a
metric ton) on the Tokyo Commodity Exchange, before settling at
278.7 yen. The most-active contract tumbled 15 percent in the
past two weeks as Europe’s debt crisis escalated.  Asian stocks rose, with the regional index rebounding from
its biggest drop in six months, after Premier  Wen Jiabao  said
China will focus more on bolstering growth, indicating policies
may be loosened further as inflation moderates.  “China’s focus on boosting growth and  Thailand ’s price-
support policy helped trigger the gains,” said Chaiwat Muenmee,
an analyst at Bangkok-based commodity broker DS Futures Co.  German and French leaders meet today in Berlin before a
European Union summit on May 23 to map out a revised plan after
 Greece ’s possible exit erased almost $4 trillion from global
stock markets this month.  Thailand, the biggest exporter, plans to buy more than
10,000 tons on the Tokyo and Shanghai exchanges and will keep
buying from farmers until prices reach appropriate levels,
Rubber Estate Organization Managing Director Chanachai
Plengsiriwat said May 18.  September-delivery rubber on the Shanghai Futures Exchange
gained 2.7 percent to close at 24,735  yuan  ($3,910) a ton. Thai
rubber on a  free-on-board  basis rose 1.1 percent to 116.05 baht
($3.70) a kilogram today, according to the Rubber Research
Institute of Thailand.  The Rubber Estate Organization kept the price at which it
will buy ribbed smoked sheets from farmers  unchanged  at 115.39
baht to 115.48 baht per kilogram, the agency said on its website
today.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
