Petra Solar Inc., a U.S. developer of
distributed solar projects, is developing 5 megawatts of power
systems in Bahrain.  Petra will also provide a network to monitor the
electricity grid and the solar panels that will be installed in
the township of Awali, the University of Bahrain and other parts
of the country, the South Plainfield, New Jersey-based company
said today in a statement.  The project is the first phase of a national effort to
promote renewable energy in Bahrain, said the Minister of Energy
and Abdul Hussain bin Ali Mirza.  Bahrain’s National Oil & Gas Authority is seeking “to
diversify the sources of energy needed to ensure the sustainable
development of the kingdom,” he said in the statement.  Petra is working with National Oil & Gas, Bahrain Petroleum
Co. and Caspian Energy Holdings for the solar project.  Petra is installing solar panels on 200,000 utility poles
in  New Jersey  as part of a project to develop 80 megawatts of
renewable power, under a contract with Public Service Electric &
Gas Co., the state’s largest utility.  To contact the reporter on this story:
