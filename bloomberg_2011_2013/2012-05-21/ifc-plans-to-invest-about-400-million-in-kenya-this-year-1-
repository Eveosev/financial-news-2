The International Finance Corp., the
 World Bank ’s private lending arm, said investments in  Kenya  will
surge to $400 million this fiscal year, mainly to help private
companies boost power supplies and build infrastructure.  Investments have risen from about $60 million two years
ago, Thierry Tanoh, vice-president for sub-Saharan  Africa  at the
IFC, said today at a media briefing in Kenya’s capital, Nairobi.  The investments include a $100 million loan to Equity Bank
Ltd., Kenya’s largest lender by market value, for lending to
small- and mid-sized businesses and agricultural producers,
according to a press release distributed to reporters. Gulf
Energy Ltd. and Thika Power Ltd. received $59 million, while
Kenya Power Ltd., the country’s sole electricity distributor, is
negotiating a $50 million loan to expand its power network.  Commitments to  East Africa ’s largest economy over the next
2012-13 fiscal year will remain about the same, said Jean Philippe Prosper, the IFC’s director for eastern and southern
Africa.  “I don’t see us doing less than $300 million or $400
million” in the financial year beginning July 1, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
