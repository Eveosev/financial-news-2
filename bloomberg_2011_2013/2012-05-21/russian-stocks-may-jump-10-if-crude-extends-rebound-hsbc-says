Russia’s  Micex Index (INDEXCF)  may rally almost
10 percent this week if oil extends its rebound, according to
HSBC Holdings Plc.  “The market is oversold,” Alexander Morozov, chief
economist at HSBC in Moscow, said by phone. “If oil continues
to rise, the market will gain.”  The Micex may rise to 1,420.05 if Brent crude advances to
$118.98 in the “next few days,” Morozov said. Brent traded up
1.3 percent at $108.48 a barrel in London.  The benchmark  stock index  jumped the most in more than two
months today, adding 2.1 percent to close at 1,298.42. The Micex
entered a bear market on May 17 after sliding more than 20
percent from a March 14 high.  To contact the reporter on this story:
