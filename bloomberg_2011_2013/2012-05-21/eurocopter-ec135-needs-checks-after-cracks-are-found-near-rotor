Eurocopter’s EC135 helicopters will
require regular visual inspections after cracks were found in an
area where rotor blades are attached,  Europe ’s air safety
authority said.  Cracks have been located so far on three helicopters, the
European Air Safety Agency said in an emergency airworthiness
directive issued May 17, though the cause hasn’t yet been
determined.  The EC135, which seats one or two pilots and five to six
passengers, is widely used by governmental organizations
including police forces, and by individuals and corporations.
There are more than 1,000 in operation today flown by 270
customers in 58 countries, according to Eurocopter, a unit of
European Aeronautic, Defence & Space Co.  A spokeswoman for Eurocopter said it was too early to judge
the seriousness of the cracks, given that the cause hasn’t yet
been identified.  “EASA is closing monitoring the outcomes of the
investigations performed by Eurocopter Deutschland, and any new
potential finding and will amend or mandate new airworthiness
actions as necessary,” EASA spokesman Jeremie Teahan said in an
e-mailed statement today. Since May 17, no additional cracks
have been found, he said.  For Related News and Information:  To contact the reporters on this story:
