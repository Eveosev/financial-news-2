Japan  is facing challenges from
volatility in currency markets and should be prepared to take
steps to halt the rise of the yen, the nation’s top currency
official said.  “We are still facing challenges from a very volatile
exchange-rate market,” Takehiko Nakao, vice finance minister
for international affairs, said at an event in Tokyo today.
“There has been an appreciation of the yen” he said. “It was
a kind of jump. I think this a very speculative excessive
movement. We are now closely monitoring it and we should take
action if necessary.”  The Japanese currency has strengthened more than 5 percent
against the dollar in the past two months. Nakao’s comments came
after Finance Minister  Jun Azumi  hinted at potential
intervention on the  currency market  on May 18, saying he’s ready
to take “appropriate action” if necessary.  The yen weakened today amid speculation the  Bank of Japan (8301) 
will add to stimulus measures this week to support growth and
weaken the currency. It fell 0.4 percent to 79.35 per dollar as
of 10:51 a.m. in London.  BOJ officials will gather for a two-day meeting starting
tomorrow. The central bank expanded its asset-purchase program
in February and April. Last week, two bond-buying operations
failed to attract the central bank’s target for sell offers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
