Natixis (KN)  SA, the investment-banking
unit of French lender Groupe BPCE, hired Vincent Berry from
Rothschild & Cie to oversee its mergers and acquisitions
business.  Berry, 38, will report to Virginie Banet, Natixis’s head of
coverage, the Paris-based bank said in a statement today. Berry,
who started his career in 1997 at ABN Amro Rothschild’s equity
capital-markets business, was a director within Rothschild’s
utilities, transport and infrastructures team since 2007,
Natixis said.  Natixis is among French corporate and investment banks
cutting jobs to reign in costs and reducing risk-weighted assets
as the European sovereign debt crisis reduced funding options,
especially in dollars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
