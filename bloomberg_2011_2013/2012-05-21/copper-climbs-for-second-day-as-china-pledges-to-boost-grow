Copper advanced for a second day as
Chinese Premier  Wen Jiabao  said the government will focus more
on bolstering economic growth, boosting demand.  The three-month delivery contract rose as much as 2 percent
to $7,799 a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange and was at
$7,776.25 by 5:32 p.m. Tokyo time. The price fell 4.5 percent
last week, declining for a third week. July-delivery metal
gained 1.2 percent to $3.51 a pound on the Comex.  China should implement a “proactive fiscal policy and a
prudent monetary policy” to maintain growth, Wen said over the
weekend. Asian stocks rose, with the regional index rebounding
from its biggest drop in six months, as Wen’s comment indicated
the country’s policies may be loosened further.  “After reassurances by  China  that it would promote growth
policies, we could see a quick burst to the upside,”  Mark Pervan  and Natalie Robertson, analysts at Australia & New
Zealand Banking Group Ltd., said in a report today. “We may
have to wait for the HSBC Flash PMI read later this week before
the market decides to move one way or the other.”  China’s manufacturing activity preliminary reading for May
will be released on May 24 by HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit
Economics. The purchasing managers’ index rose to 49.3 in April
from 48.3 the previous month. The reading still signaled a sixth
straight month of contraction.  Refined-copper imports by China declined to a eight-month
low while exports gained as high inventories prompted traders to
cut orders and urged smelters to move the metal out.  Inbound shipments were 272,903 tons in April, according to
data e-mailed by the General Administration of Customs today.
That was the lowest since August and compares with 345,667 tons
in March. Exports totaled 27,420 tons, up from 26,537 tons of
the previous month, customs data showed.  The September-delivery contract on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange climbed 1.2 percent to close at 55,890  yuan  ($8,834) a
ton. On the LME, aluminum was down 0.2 percent at $2,064 a ton,
while zinc rose 1.1 percent to $1,914 a ton and lead gained 0.6
percent to $1,977 a ton. Nickel advanced 0.9 percent to $16,978
a ton. Tin declined 0.7 percent to $19,500 a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
