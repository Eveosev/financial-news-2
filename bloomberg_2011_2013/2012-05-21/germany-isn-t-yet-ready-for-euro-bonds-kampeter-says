Europe ’s new budget treaty and
permanent rescue facility are a first step “but not yet the
final step” to the political union that  Germany  says is a
prerequisite before it will agree to joint euro-area bonds,
Deputy Finance Minister Steffen Kampeter said.  “We have always made clear that we completely oppose joint
financing via euro bonds as long as fiscal policy in Europe is
not integrated,” Kampeter said today in an interview with
Deutschlandfunk radio. Introducing euro bonds now would mean
bond interest that is “too low and takes the pressure off
adjustments to the European economy.” For years,  Greece  had
something similar to euro bonds and failed to seize the
opportunity provided, “that’s why I believe that prescription
comes at the wrong time and carries the wrong side-effects.”  “We need the fiscal pact, we need budget discipline, we
need future-oriented investment and we need a commonly agreed
policy for supply-side reforms” to make the economy more
competitive, he said. “And whether in a decade or more a form
of common financing is in place surely won’t be decided on
Wednesday evening” when EU leaders meet.  To contact the reporter on this story:
