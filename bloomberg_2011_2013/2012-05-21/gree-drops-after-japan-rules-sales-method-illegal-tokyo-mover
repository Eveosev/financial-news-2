Gree Inc. (3632) ,  Japan ’s second-biggest
social-gaming company, fell to the lowest in more than a year in
Tokyo trading after a sales method it uses was ruled illegal.  Gree dropped as much as 5.3 percent to 1,293 yen, the
lowest since March 16, 2011, and traded at 1,339 yen as of 9:29
a.m.  DeNA Co. (2432) , Japan’s largest social-gaming operator, fell as
much as 6.2 percent to 1,825 yen. The benchmark Nikkei 225 Stock
Average rose 0.6 percent.  Japan’s  Consumer Affairs Agency  announced May 18 it plans
to ban the sales starting in July for a method known as
“complete gacha” under a law against unjustifiable premiums
and misleading representations, saying it entices users with an
appeal similar to gambling. Social-gaming companies have plunged
in Tokyo trading since earlier this month, when the consumer
agency said it was considering restrictions.  A group of game operators including Green and DeNA have
already said they plan to abandon the feature by May 31.  In “complete gacha,” users pay about 300 yen ($3.79)
apiece for virtual tokens that can be converted to a more
valuable virtual item if the player obtains the right
combination or a “complete” set. The items allow users to make
faster progress in games.  DeNA, Gree and four other operators formed a group to
improve the social-gaming environment in March and are imposing
a ban on “real money trade,” where users sell those rare items
to other players, the companies  said  April 23. The operators
have limited monthly fees for users who are 19 years old or
younger.  Gacha is the Japanese word for vending machines that
dispense miniature toys or prizes in plastic capsules without
showing the contents beforehand. Buyers take a chance they will
receive a desired item after inserting coins and turning a knob.  To contact the reporter on this story:
