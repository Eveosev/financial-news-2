Egypt  agreed to export 295 metric
tons of cotton in the week through May 17, the Alexandria Cotton
Exporters Association said today in its weekly bulletin.  The country has shipped 73,716 tons of the fiber valued at
$231.7 million since the marketing year began Sept. 1. Last
week’s sales were split between 145 tons of the Giza 88 cotton
variety and 150 tons of Giza 86, the association said.  Egypt produces the world’s finest extra-long staple cotton,
which is stronger and softer than shorter staple cotton and used
in luxury clothing. Switzerland, Bangladesh and  India  are the
top importers of Egyptian cotton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
