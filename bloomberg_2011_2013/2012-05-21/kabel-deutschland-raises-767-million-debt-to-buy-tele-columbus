Kabel Deutschland  Holding AG got 600
million euros ($767 million) of short-term debt to fund its
acquisition of Tele Columbus Group, the German cable television
provider owned by creditors.  Morgan Stanley, Deutsche Bank AG and Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. provided the 12-month  bridge financing  that will be rolled
into long-term debt if it’s not replaced before maturity,
Unterfoehring, Germany-based Kabel Deutschland said on its
website.  Kabel Deutschland, Germany’s biggest cable company, said
today it agreed to buy Berlin-based Tele Columbus for 603
million euros plus accrued interest.  Tele Columbus would add about 1.7 million new customers to
Kabel Deutschland, Germany’s biggest cable company.  Kabel Deutschland said its goal to keep debt at between 3
and 3.5 times its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation
and amortization won’t be affected by the transaction, which is
subject to antitrust approval in  Germany .  To contact the reporter on this story:
