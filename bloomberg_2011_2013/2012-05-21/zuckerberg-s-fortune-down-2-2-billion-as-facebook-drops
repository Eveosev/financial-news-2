Mark Zuckerberg ’s fortune dropped
$2.1 billion as shares of  Facebook Inc. (FB) , the world’s largest
social-networking company, fell below the company’s $38 offer
price in its second day of trading.  The shares sank 11 percent to $34.03 at the close in New
York. Zuckerberg is worth $17.3 billion, according to the
 Bloomberg Billionaires Index .  “If you went out and spent on Friday, you’re not canceling
the order for the Lamborghini just yet,”  Martin Pyykkonen , an
analyst with Wedge Partners in Greenwood Village, Colorado, said
in a phone interview. “For the most part, those with a
substantial stake still have plenty of value.”  Facebook raised $16 billion in an initial public offering,
selling 421.2 million shares for $38 each on May 17. It was the
biggest technology IPO in history. The stock was little changed
at $38.23 at the close of May 18.  The IPO suffered from trading glitches on its first day.
 Nasdaq OMX Group Inc. (NDAQ)  Chief Executive Officer Robert Greifeld
said a “poor design” in software driving auctions for IPOs
caused issues with Facebook’s first trading day.  Moskovitz, Saverin  Dustin Moskovitz, 27, who started Facebook with Zuckerberg
from their dorm room at  Harvard University , owns 133.7 million
shares of the company’s Class B stock worth $4.55 billion, down
$560 million during the day.  Eduardo Saverin, 30, has a $1.8 billion stake, down $220
million since Friday’s close. According to a regulatory filing
dated May 17, he owns 53.1 million shares of the company.  Sean Parker  owns 66 million Facebook shares valued at $2.2
billion. The 32-year-old persuaded Zuckerberg to move to
California to focus on the company full time in 2004.  Facebook’s chief operating officer  Sheryl Sandberg , 42, who
was lured from Google in 2008, owns 27 million shares, including
25 million restricted stock units that have vested. They are
valued at $920 million. She also owns millions of unvested units
not counted in her net worth calculation.  Co-founder Christopher Hughes, 28, who was a billionaire
when the company began trading May 18, now commands a nine-
figure fortune. He owns about 22 million shares of Facebook,
according to a person familiar with his holdings who asked not
to be named because the matter is private. His stake is worth
$750 million.  Hughes, who bought the Washington, D.C.-based magazine the
New Republic in March 2012 for less than $5 million, has more
than $100 million in cash and real estate after selling some of
his Facebook hoard, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporters on this story:
