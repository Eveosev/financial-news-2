U.K. Prime Minister  David Cameron 
defended his decision to warn of the dangers that  Greece  poses
to the European single currency, saying Britain’s own prosperity
is at risk.  “This affects us -- 40 percent of Britain’s exports go to
euro-zone countries,” Cameron told reporters at the close of
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization summit in Chicago. “And
my judgment is that staying silent on the problems would
actually be more dangerous than speaking out. We need these
issues to be resolved.”  Cameron on May 20 urged European leaders to make
contingency plans for a Greek exit from the euro. Greeks go to
the polls again next month after their political leaders failed
to form a governing coalition following the last election.
Cameron said the vote would effectively decide whether the
country stayed in the euro.  There’s no mechanism for a country to leave the euro, and a
Greek exit would increase market pressure on other European
countries deemed to be vulnerable. Speaking during the Group of
Eight summit at Camp David on May 19, European Council President
 Herman Van Rompuy  and European Union President  Jose Barroso 
refused to discuss plans for a Greek exit. Barroso said “Plan
A” was for Greece to stay in.  To contact the reporter on this story:
