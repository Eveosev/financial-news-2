Bobby Godsell, the chairman of
Business Leadership  South Africa , said an independent commission
should be set up to investigate executive pay in South Africa,
which is excessive and lacked transparency, Business Day
reported.  South Africa needed an independent commission, similar to
one in the U.K., to look into income inequality, the
Johannesburg-based newspaper cited Godsell as saying.  To contact the reporters on this story:
