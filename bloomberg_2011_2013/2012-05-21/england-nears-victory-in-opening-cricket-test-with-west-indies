Ian Bell and  Alastair Cook  combined
for 74 runs to push England to 131-4 at lunch on the final day
of the opening cricket Test with West Indies at Lord’s in
London.  The hosts, which started the day on 10-2, need 60 runs to
win. Cook is on 53 and Bell on 34 after Jonathan Trott and  Kevin
Pietersen  were both out for 13, putting pressure on England.  Top-ranked England lost captain Andrew Strauss and
nightwatchman James Anderson at the end of day four. Kemar Roach
is 3-41, having taken both wickets yesterday and that of Trott
today. Pietersen was caught by Denesh Ramdin off Shannon
Gabriel.  Shivnarine Chanderpaul and Marlon Samuels shared a 157-run
partnership to help West Indies to 345 in its second innings.
Chanderpaul made 91, Samuels 86, while Denesh Ramdin scored 43.  West Indies hasn’t  won an away Test  in a country other than
bottom-ranked  Bangladesh  since winning in  South Africa  in
December 2007.  England needs to win the three-match series to stay atop
the International Cricket Council’s Test  rankings  ahead of South
Africa. It is undefeated in its last 12 Tests at Lord’s since a
defeat to Australia in the 2005 Ashes Test at the venue.  To contact the reporter on this story:
