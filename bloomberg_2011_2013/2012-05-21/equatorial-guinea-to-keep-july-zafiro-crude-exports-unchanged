Equatorial Guinea  will keep exports
of its Zafiro crude for July unchanged from June at four cargoes
of 1 million barrels each, according to a loading program
obtained by Bloomberg News.  Exports of  Chad â€™s Doba grade will be four 950,000-barrel
consignments in July, one more than next month, according to
another shipping plan.  Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude shipments
compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan
their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
