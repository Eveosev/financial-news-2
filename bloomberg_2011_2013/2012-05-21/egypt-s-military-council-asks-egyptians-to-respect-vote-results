Egypt ’s ruling military council urged
citizens to accept results of the North African country’s first
presidential race since the ouster of  Hosni Mubarak  last year
and said it was standing “at equal distance from all
candidates.”  The council, to which Mubarak ceded power following the 18-
day revolution which toppled him, called on all voters to take
part in choosing their next president “to which hopes of
crossing over to progress, prosperity and stability are tied,”
according to a statement posted on the council’s official
Facebook page.  The statement came after Islamists and some secular groups
threatened to take to the streets if alleged attempts to bring
back the ousted regime of Mubarak under a different leader
succeed. Former Arab League chief Amre Moussa and former premier
Ahmed Shafik are two of the leading candidates in the elections
which start May 23. Both have served under Mubarak.  To contact the reporter on this story:
