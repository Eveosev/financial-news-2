OAO Rosinter Restaurants Holding, a
Russian eatery chain, swung to a loss last year because of
higher food prices and salaries as well as write-offs relating
to closures.  The net loss was 281.2 million rubles ($9 million) compared
with profit of 257.5 million rubles a year earlier, Rosinter
said today in an e-mailed statement. Sales rose 6.4 percent to
10.4 billion rubles.  Rosinter’s gross profit margin fell to 20.3 percent from
23.8 percent a year earlier “resulting from an increase of food
and beverage costs and payroll expenses,” the company said. The
chain reported impairment provisions of 265 million rubles and
write-offs of 184 million rubles related to store closures.  Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization fell 68 percent to 335.1 million rubles, while net
debt rose 10 percent to 1.27 billion rubles, Rosinter said. That
pushed the ratio of net debt to Ebitda up to 3.8 as of Dec. 31
from 1.1 a year earlier, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
