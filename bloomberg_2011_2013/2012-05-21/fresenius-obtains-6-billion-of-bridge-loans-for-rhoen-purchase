 Fresenius SE said it obtained $6.1
billion of short-term loans to fund its bid for  Rhoen Klinikum
AG (RHK) , cementing its position as  Germany ’s biggest operator of
private hospitals.  The so-called bridge financing, which includes a 3.1
billion-euro ($3.96 billion) tranche and a $2.15 billion
portion, will be refinanced with long-term debt that includes
high-yield bonds and loans,  Bad Homburg , Germany-based Fresenius
said in an  offer document  on its website.  The long-term debt will include 700 million euros and $200
million in facility A, 500 million euros and $1.2 billion in
facility B, and a 400 million-euro revolving credit, all of
which will have maturities between five and seven years,
according to the filing. There will also be 1.5 billion euros
and $750 million of a high-yield bridge facility that can be
extended to seven years if it is not refinanced with senior
bonds within the first year, Fresenius said.  Fresenius set a June 27 deadline for Rhoen Klinikum
investors to tender their shares in its 3.1 billion-euro bid to
buy the German hospital operator. The nation’s financial
regulator approved the offer on May 18.  Deutsche Bank AG, JPMorgan Chase & Co., Societe Generale
SA, Credit Suisse Group AG and  UniCredit SpA (UCG)  underwrote the debt
financing.  Fresenius completed a 1 billion-euro capital increase on
May 11 to help finance the deal, which will build annual revenue
at the company’s hospital unit to 6 billion euros, about 8
percent of the German market.  To contact the reporter on this story:
