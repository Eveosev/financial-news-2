Tudou Holdings Ltd. (TUDO) , the Chinese
online video site being acquired by  Youku Inc. (YOKU) , gained the most
in 10 weeks in New York as first-quarter profit and sales beat
estimates.  American depositary receipts of Shanghai-based Tudou surged
12 percent to $33.44 at the close of trading in New York, the
most since Youku said on March 12 that it planned to acquire its
rival video site operator in a stock deal valued at about $880
million. Tudou shares have climbed 117 percent since the deal
was announced. Youku jumped 11 percent, also the biggest gain
since March 12, to $22.56.  Tudou is cutting costs in preparation for its merger with
Youku, said Andy Yeung, a New York-based analyst for Oppenheimer
& Co. Tudou in a statement reported first-quarter sales of $22.3
million, exceeding Yeung’s estimate of $21.4 million. Tudou
reported a loss of 75 cents per share on a GAAP basis compared
to a $1 loss forecast by Yeung.  “Tudou saw significant improvement on net income through
cost controls that were much better than expected,” Yeung said
in a phone interview. “This bodes very well for the acquisition
process and is good news for investors.”  Yeung has an outperform rating on Tudou.  To contact the reporter on this story:
