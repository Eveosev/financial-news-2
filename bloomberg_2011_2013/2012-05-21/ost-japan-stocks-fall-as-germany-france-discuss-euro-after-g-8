Japan’s　 Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  rose
from a four-month low as a weaker yen lifted the outlook for
exporters and on speculation shares were oversold. Gains were
limited after the Group of Eight nations failed to deliver a
unified strategy to tame the European debt crisis.  Sony Corp. (6758) , Japan’s No. 1 exporter of consumer electronics,
rose 0.7 percent, reversing an earlier loss.  Fanuc Corp. (6954) , the
country’s biggest maker of factory robotics, rose 1.5 percent on
a report it plans to boost production.  Renesas Electronics (6723)  Corp.
dropped to a record low after Goldman Sachs Group Inc. cut the
chipmaker’s investment rating.  The  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (TPX)  gained 0.3 percent to 8,633.89
at 3 p.m. in Tokyo, rebounding from its lowest close since Jan.
18. The Topix Index fell less than 0.1 percent to 725.15 after
swinging between gains and losses at least 27 times. The measure
fell 4.3 percent last week, capping its longest weekly losing
streak since September.  “To a degree, the market has priced in the risk of
 Greece ’s exit from the euro,” said Ichiro Yamada, general
manager of equities who helps manages about $3.8 billion in
stocks at Fukoku Mutual Life Insurance. “The euro’s rebound
stands out in the market, and that’s supportive of shares.”  The Nikkei 225 retreated 16 percent from this year’s high
on March 27 as China’s economic growth slowed and on renewed
concern about Europe’s debt crisis. The political gridlock in
Greece after an inconclusive election this month reignited fears
the nation will renege on austerity pledges required for 240
billion euros ($307 billion) in aid and exit the euro.  Yen Falls  Shares rose as the yen fell against all of its 16 major
counterparts, retreating from a three-month high against the
euro. A weaker yen enhances the value of overseas profit at
Japanese companies. The 14-day relative strength index for the
Nikkei 225 has fallen to 26, below the 30 threshold that some
traders say signals a rebound.  Sony added 0.7 percent to 1,108 yen.  Mitsubishi Motors Corp. (7211) 
rose 1.4 percent to 75 yen after the automaker’s 14-day RSI slid
to 19.  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPXL1)  added 0.5
percent today after the index slid 0.7 percent in  New York  on
May 18.  Gains in shares were limited as G-8 leaders over the
weekend pushed for Greece to stay in the euro area and supported
boosting growth, while Germany said Europe can’t spend its way
out of the debt crisis. They concurred at U.S. President  Barack
Obama ’s retreat outside Washington “that the right measures are
not the same for each of us.”  German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble will discuss the
future of the 17-nation euro with his newly installed French
counterpart,  Pierre Moscovici , in Berlin today as European Union
leaders prepare for a May 23 summit meeting in Brussels.  ’False Starts’  “It’s very important that a clear way forward is
established” for the  European debt crisis , said Tim Schroeders,
a portfolio manager who helps manage $1 billion in equities at
Pengana Capital Ltd. in Melbourne. “Given we had a number of
false starts until we reached this juncture, people will await a
lot more clarity before reverting to a risk-on stance.”  Among stocks that advanced, Fanuc added 1.5 percent to
13,050 yen after the Nikkei newspaper reported it will expand
its production capacity for equipment to control  machine tools 
by 30 percent.  Renesas Electronics slumped 10 percent to 269 yen after its
rating was cut to sell/neutral from neutral/neutral by Goldman
Sachs, which cited a slow earnings recovery. The stock has
plunged 36 percent since May 9, when the chipmaker said it
couldn’t provide an earnings outlook due to an uncertain market.  Trading volume on the Nikkei 225 Stock Average was 14
percent below the 30-day average. The  Nikkei 225 Volatility
Index (VNKY)  fell 6.3 percent to 26.75, indicating traders expect a
swing of 7.7 percent on the benchmark gauge over the next 30
days.  Stocks on the Nikkei are  valued  at 1.09 times book value,
compared with 2.05 for the Standard & Poor’s 500 and 1.31 for
the Stoxx Europe 600. A value of less than one means investors
can buy companies for less than the value of their assets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
