Theft of metals including copper and
lead costs the U.K. economy an estimated 770 million pounds
($1.2 billion) annually after doubling in five years, the
 Association of British Insurers  said.  Thefts are estimated at 1,000 a week, the London-based
industry group said today in a  statement  posted on its website.
Every week insurers are paying out more than 1 million pounds to
victims and train services are delayed by 117 hours in total
because of stolen metal, it said.  The association published the statement a day before a
conference on metals theft in which the government and British
Transport Police will participate along with insurers. Cable
thieves forced a hospital in Wales to cancel operations, and a
gas explosion that wrecked houses in northern  England  was linked
to stolen copper piping, the group said.  “We support government action to make it harder to sell on
stolen metal and tougher penalties for offenders,” Nick Starling, the association’s director of general insurance, said
in the statement. Elevated prices and ease of access to metals
are driving thefts, according to the group.  U.K. police said in May 2009 a stolen  Henry Moore  statue
valued at 3 million pounds may have been melted down for scrap
metal worth about 2,500 pounds. Thieves are attacking 23
churches every week, the association said.  The association has more than 300 members including
 Prudential Plc (PRU)  and Standard Life Plc that manage investments
equating to 26 percent of the U.K.’s total net worth, the
group’s website shows.  To contact the reporter on this story:
