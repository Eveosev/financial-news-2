Egyptian security forces intercepted
50 short-range surface-to-air missiles smuggled from Libya, the
military said, in the latest such seizure of weapons originating
from the North African nation.  A  border patrol  found the weapons when it stopped a sports-
utility vehicle passing through a western military zone without
license plates, the armed forces said today in a faxed
statement. Also seized were 96,000 rounds of ammunition and an
undisclosed amount of hashish, it said. Security forces said
yesterday they intercepted a shipment of more than 190 rockets.  Libya’s interim leadership has been unable to restore order
in the country since the uprising that led to the ouster and
subsequent death of the nation’s leader,  Muammar Qaddafi .
Egyptian officials have voiced concern about the weapons being
smuggled from the country, some of which have been destined for
Sinai and onward to the  Gaza Strip .  To contact the reporter on this story:
