Vodacom Group Ltd. (VOD)  said profit
increased 8.1 percent in the year through March as the largest
provider of mobile-phone services to South Africans boosted
customers by 30 percent.  Earnings per share after one-time items rose to 7.09 rand
($0.85), the Johannesburg-based company said in a statement
today. That compares with the  median estimate  for adjusted
earnings a share of 7.23 rand by 14 analysts in a Bloomberg
survey.  Vodacom, 65 percent owned by Newbury, England-based
 Vodafone Group Plc (VOD) , expanded its customer base to 47.8 million
as it spent 8.7 billion rand, 37 percent more than a year
earlier, on its networks in the five countries in which it
operates. The company raised the dividend paid to shareholders
54 percent to 7.10 rand.  “The 24 percent growth in group free cash flow supported a
higher dividend of 7.10 rand and helped us deliver a 45 percent
total shareholder return,” said Vodacom.  South African mobile-phone operators have been paying
higher percentages of earnings to shareholders as dividends as
the market has matured in  Africa ’s biggest economy.  MTN Group Ltd. (MTN) , the continent’s largest mobile-phone
operator, increased its dividend 36 percent to 4.76 a share in
the year through December, it said on March 7. The company
raised its payout ratio to 70 percent, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
