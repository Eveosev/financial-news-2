Anesco Ltd., a U.K. developer of
renewable energy projects, plans to help build about 50
megawatts of large-scale solar parks in Britain, its chief
executive officer said.  The company, which is backed by the utility  SSE Plc (SSE)  and
private equity firm Zouk Capital LLP, seeks to develop 25
megawatts on its own and is in talks to build another 25
megawatts with partners using either tariffs or green
certificates, Chief Executive Officer Adrian Pike said by e-
mail. It is already building a 5-megawatt solar park, he said.  U.K. energy-efficiency companies such as Anesco are
planning large solar parks again, aided by panel prices that
have dropped almost 50 percent in a year. No new U.K. megawatt-
scale plants have been completed since feed-in tariffs, or fixed
premiums for solar power, were cut in August.  The company, based in Reading, will build the projects
using either the tariffs or renewable obligation certificates.
Current support levels for solar are “correct” and the company
will use a combination of both incentives, depending on how
tariffs are changed and the forward-pricing of the certificates,
according to the chief executive.  “Generally the plants now need a good power purchase
agreement as well as the incentive schemes,” Pike said. “I
think the balance is now right.”  Anesco started building a 5-megawatt solar plant at a farm
in Fawley near Southampton last week and plans to complete it
within eight weeks. The plant’s final asset value will be about
7.5 million pounds, including the 25-year land lease, Pike said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
