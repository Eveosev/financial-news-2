Vietnam ’s one-year bonds advanced,
driving the yield to a 33-month low, on speculation the
government will lower local fuel prices, helping slow inflation
and increasing room for interest-rate cuts. The dong was steady.  The  finance ministry  will consider cutting gasoline prices
if global petroleum prices extend declines, online newswire
VnExpress reported today. Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung told
the central bank to “speed up” reductions in borrowing costs
to help businesses, the government said on May 9.  State Bank  of
Vietnam Governor Nguyen Van Binh said in March the monetary
authority would cut rates by 100 basis points in each of the
second, third and fourth quarters.  “The market thinks there will be rate cuts soon,” said
Nguyen Duy Phong, a Ho Chi Minh City-based analyst at Viet
Capital Securities Co.  The  yield  on one-year bonds fell two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 8.71 percent, according to a daily fixing
rate from banks compiled by Bloomberg. That’s the lowest level
since August 2009. Benchmark five-year bond  yields  were
unchanged for a third day at 9.5 percent.  Crude-oil prices in  New York  declined more than 12 percent
this month to $92.13 per barrel, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  The dong traded at 20,855 per dollar as of 2:07 p.m. in
Hanoi, compared with 20,848 on May 18, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The State Bank of Vietnam set its
 reference rate  at 20,828, unchanged since Dec. 26, according to
its website. The currency is allowed to trade up to 1 percent on
either side of the rate.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
