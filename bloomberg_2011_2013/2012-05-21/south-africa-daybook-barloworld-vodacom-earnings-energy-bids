Vodacom Group Ltd. (VOD) , the largest
provider of mobile-phone services to South Africans, reports
results for the year through March.  Basic earnings probably rose as much as 25 percent to 7.01
rand a share from 5.62 rand a year earlier, the Johannesburg-
based company said on May 2. Earnings per share excluding one-
time items increased as much as 10 percent to 7.22 a share from
6.56 rand a year earlier. That compares with the median estimate
for adjusted earnings a share of 7.23 rand by 14 analysts in a
Bloomberg survey.  Vodacom, controlled  Vodafone Group Plc (VOD) , said higher taxes
and impairments negatively affected earnings.  The company will release its results at 7:05 a.m.  (All events in Central African Time.)
