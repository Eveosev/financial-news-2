Les Laboratoires Servier and its
founder won their bid to suspend a trial over claims they hid
the risks of a diabetes drug, when a judge ruled their
constitutional challenge to the process was serious enough to
merit a higher courtâ€™s review, France 3 reported today, citing
the judge.  A procedural hearing is planned for Dec. 14 to reschedule
the trial, pending the outcome of the constitutional review,
France 3 said on its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
