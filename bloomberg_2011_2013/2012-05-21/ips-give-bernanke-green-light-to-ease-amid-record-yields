Bond traders are cutting expectations
for U.S. inflation by the most since December, providing Federal
Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke the scope for additional
stimulus as the central bank’s current effort winds down.  With six weeks left before the end of the Fed’s $400
billion swap of short-term debt for longer-term securities in a
program known as Operation Twist, everything from yields on
securities that protect against rising consumer prices to a
 measure  of the outlook for inflation in the forwards market show
diminished concerns. Traders are pricing in a 55 percent chance
that the central bank will begin new efforts to spur economic
growth, Bank of America Corp. says.  Speculation has risen that the central bank may need to add
to the $12.8 trillion already spent to avert a second recession
in three years after reports showed jobs are growing more slowly
than forecast and Bernanke said April 25 that the Fed remains
“prepared to do more as needed.” For first time since it
announced Operation Twist in September, the Fed’s preferred
 gauge  of measuring traders’ inflation expectations is poised to
fall for a second straight month.  “It’s not only a weak economy, but as inflation comes
down, it could be another reason for the Fed to implement some
more stimulus,” said Gary Pollack, head of fixed-income trading
at Deutsche Bank AG’s Private Wealth Management unit in  New
York , which manages $12 billion, in a May 14 interview.  Record Low Forecast  Deutsche Bank’s investment banking unit and JPMorgan Chase
Co. expect yields on the benchmark 10-year note will tumble to a
record 1.5 percent this year, from 1.72 percent last week and
this year’s high of 2.4 percent on March 20. The previous low of
1.67 percent was reached Sept. 23. It has averaged 3.82 percent
over the past 10 years.  “Growth concerns have increased, and with the drop in
commodity prices inflation concerns have decreased which has
kept the environment friendly for low rates,” said Michael Pond, co-head of interest-rate strategy in New York at Barclays
Plc, one of the Fed’s 21 primary dealers. “If growth stalls,
the employment rate stops falling and inflation remains no
concern, it won’t take much for another round of stimulus.”  Gross domestic product rose at a 2.2 percent annual rate
last quarter, according to the Commerce Department. That
followed a 3 percent pace in the three months ended Dec. 31. The
average was 2.6 percent from 2000 to 2007, before the financial
crisis.  Falling Yields  Yields on 10-year notes fell 12 basis points last week, or
0.12 percentage point, to 1.72 percent, Bloomberg Bond Trader
 prices  show. The 1.75 percent security due May 2022 rose 1 1/32,
or $10.31 per $1,000 face amount, to 100 7/32. The yield was two
basis points higher at 1.74 percent at 10:59 a.m. New York time.  Treasuries have rallied for nine straight weeks, the
longest stretch since October 1998, as  Europe ’s debt crisis
flared and concern rose that the recovery may be faltering.  Treasuries due in 10 years have returned 6.71 percent since
yields peaked this year on March 20, according to Bank of
America Merrill Lynch index data. That compares with a loss of
7.52 percent after dividends for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
and a plunge of 10.3 percent in the S&P Total Return Index of
metals, fuels and agricultural products.  Other benchmark bond markets are also reaching record low
yields. German 10-year bunds dropped to 1.396 percent on May 18.
U.K. gilts of similar maturity fell to 1.81 percent last week,
data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Breakeven Rates  Inflation in the U.S. last month grew at the slowest pace
since February 2011, the Labor Department said May 15 in
Washington. The  consumer price index  rose 2.3 percent in April
from a year earlier, down from 2.7 percent the previous month.  The  difference  in yields between 10-year notes and Treasury
Inflation Protected Securities, or TIPS, which represents
traders’ expectations for the rate of inflation over the life of
the bonds, fell to 2.04 percentage points on May 17. That’s the
least since Jan. 23, and down from the high this year of 2.45
percentage points on March 20.  “We’ll probably have to go below 2 percent on 10-year
break-evens for the Fed to say there’s a higher chance of
deflation priced in,”  Priya Misra , head of U.S. rates strategy
at primary dealer Bank of America Merrill Lynch in New York,
said in a May 14 telephone interview. ”This paves the way for
more stimulus, but we’re not there yet.”  Two Rounds  A  measure  of price-increase predictions used by the Fed to
set policy, the five-year, five-year forward break-even rate,
which gauges the average inflation rate between 2017 and 2022,
dropped to 2.43 percent on May 16, from a 2012 high of 2.78
percent on March 19. The rate slid nine basis points in April,
the biggest monthly decline since December.  The Fed purchased $1.4 trillion in mortgages and $900
billion of Treasury debt in two rounds of quantitative easing,
that have become known as QE1 and QE2, beginning in November
2008, to avert a prolonged decline in prices, or deflation, and
to boost the economy from the recession that ended in June 2009.  A  model  used by the Federal Reserve Bank of  Cleveland ,
which includes movements in Treasury yields, survey forecasts of
price increases and swap rates, predicts that inflation will
average 1.2 percent over the next five years and 1.4 percent
over the next 10 years.  “In late-2010, when the Fed implemented its second round
of quantitative easing, these measures of expected inflation had
also collapsed and were running well below 2 percent,” Sam Bullard, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo Securities LLC  in
 Charlotte ,  North Carolina , wrote in a May 16 note to clients.
“Policy makers will probably need to see more negative news
before acting, especially during an election year.”  Political Risks  Low  interest rates  have allowed President  Barack Obama ’s
administration to finance three years of budget deficits
exceeding $1 trillion without igniting price increases.  While the amount of marketable Treasuries outstanding has
more than doubled to $10.3 trillion from $4.4 trillion in mid-
2007, debt expense equaled 3 percent of the economy in fiscal
2011 ended Sept. 30, down from 4 percent in 1999, when the U.S.
ran budget surpluses.  Further stimulus carries political risks. Republican
lawmakers and economists wrote an “Open Letter to  Ben Bernanke ” on Nov. 15, 2010, opposing QE2 and disagreeing with
the view that inflation should be pushed higher. GOP
presidential contender  Mitt Romney  said in September he would
replace the Fed chief if elected.  ‘Difficult Decision’  Minutes of the Fed’s Open Market Committee April meeting,
published May 16, showed several policy makers said additional
action could be necessary if the recovery slips.  “It’s entirely possible the Fed will have a difficult
decision to make right around the time of the election and that
makes their job even trickier because of potential accusations
of politics playing a role,” Jeffrey Caughron, a partner at
Baker Group LP in  Oklahoma City  who advises community banks on
investments of more than $30 billion, said in a May 16 telephone
interview. “That puts both Bernanke and Obama in a difficult
position.”  The economy is already showing signs of weakening.
Employers in the U.S. added fewer jobs than forecast in April as
payrolls climbed by 115,000, the smallest gain in six months,
Labor Department figures showed May 4 in  Washington . The figure
compared with a 160,000 median estimate of 85 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg News.  More Action Needed  Even as the jobless rate fell to a three-year low, wage
growth slowed to 1.8 percent in April from a year earlier.
Hourly earnings have risen 1.9 percent on average since the
start of 2010, down from 2.7 percent in 2009, 3.2 percent in
2008 and 3.5 percent in 2007, Labor Department data show.  The U.S. faces a potential economic crunch at year-end when
tax increases and spending cuts to narrow the budget deficit are
slated to kick in unless Congress takes action to block them.  The combined impact of the changes amounts to about 4
percentage points of gross domestic product, Federal Reserve
Governor Elizabeth Duke said May 15 in Washington.  “The economy isn’t healing on its own,”  Mihir Worah , a
managing director at Pacific Investment Management Co. in charge
of $105 billion in investments aimed at generating returns
higher than inflation, said in a telephone interview May 15.
“More action from the Fed is needed. Without the Fed we are
likely to see more volatility and investor insecurity, all of
which takes us further from a self-sustaining path.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
