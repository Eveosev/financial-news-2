The Dutch caretaker Cabinet rejected
an ultimatum by Freedom Party leader  Geert Wilders , who opposes
aid to other euro-area countries, to postpone decisions on the
ratification of the European Stability Mechanism.  The lower house of parliament in The Hague will begin
debating the ESM tomorrow and a majority may approve it as early
as May 23. Wilders, who brought down the minority government
last month, will now take the Cabinet to court, he said in a
text message today.  The ratification of the treaty to allow the setting up the
permanent bailout fund is a transfer of power to the European
Union and has to be postponed until after early parliamentary
elections on Sept. 12, Wilders said last week, giving the
government until this afternoon to delay the proceeding.  Euro-area parliaments should not delay approval of the
single currency’s permanent bail-out fund to avoid market
turbulence, Klaus Regling, the chief executive officer of the
fund’s predecessor unit, the European Financial Stability
Facility, said May 7.  To contact the reporter on this story:
