OAO Novatek,  Russia ’s second-biggest
natural gas producer, may encounter a standoff with Turkish
authorities in its bid to explore in waters off Cyprus,
 Kommersant  said, citing a Turkish government statement.  On May 18  Turkey ’s foreign ministry warned all companies
planning to search for hydrocarbons in the island’s offshore
zone that there were tensions in the region, and they risked not
being allowed to join future energy projects in Turkey if they
participated in a tender announced by the Cypriot authorities,
the newspaper said.  Novatek did not comment when contacted by the newspaper on
Friday. The company plans to proceed with the tender despite
Turkey’s warning, the newspaper said, citing an unspecified
person familiar with the company plans.  To contact the reporter on this story:
