Brazil ’s tax revenue estimate for
2012 was reduced by 10 billion reais ($4.9 billion) to 690
billion reais, according to a report by the Planning Ministry
released May 18.  The previous estimate was for tax revenue of 700 billion
reais, according to the first budget monitoring report released
earlier this year.  Brazil’s total revenue estimate for 2012 was increased by
3.4 billion reais, with higher forecasts for dividends and
concessions revenues compensating for the drop in tax revenues,
according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
