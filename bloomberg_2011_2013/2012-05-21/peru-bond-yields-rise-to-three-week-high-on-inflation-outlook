Peruvian bonds fell, pushing up
yields to a three-week high, amid speculation above-target
inflation will lead the central bank to raise  interest rates .  The yield on the nation’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol-
denominated bond due August 2020 climbed two basis points, or
0.02 percentage point, to 5.21 percent at 2:37 p.m. in  Lima ,
according to prices compiled by Bloomberg. The security’s price
fell 0.14 centimo to 117.32 centimos per sol.  Investors are speculating that “inflation will still be
above the central bank’s target range at the end of this year,
prompting the bank to increase its benchmark rate,” said Diego Alvarez, a trader at Banco Internacional del Peru in Lima.  Consumer prices rose 0.5 percent last month, climbing 4.1
percent from a year ago, the national statistics agency said May
1. Analysts see inflation slowing to 3 percent this year, the
central bank said May 11 a day after keeping its benchmark rate
unchanged for a 12th month. The central bank targets inflation
in a range of 1 percent to 3 percent.  Scotiabank  Peru  raised its 2012 forecast for annual
inflation to 3.3 percent from 3 percent previously amid food and
fuel price increases and rising wages, according to a May 14
report.  The sol was unchanged at 2.67 per  U.S. dollar  at today’s
close, according to Deutsche Bank AG’s local unit.  The central bank didn’t  buy or sell dollars  in the  spot
market  today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
