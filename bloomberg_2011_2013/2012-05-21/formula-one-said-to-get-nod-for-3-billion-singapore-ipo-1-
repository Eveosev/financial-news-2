Singapore ’s stock exchange approved
Formula One’s plan to raise as much as $3 billion in an initial
public offering in the city-state, three people with knowledge
of the matter said.  The people asked not to be identified because the
information is private. Loh Wei Ling, a spokeswoman for
Singapore’s bourse, didn’t immediately answer a call to her
office seeking comment.  Formula One’s IPO may be Singapore’s largest since February
2011, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, helping it
challenge  Hong Kong  in drawing listings by brand-name companies.
Italian fashion house Prada SpA picked Hong Kong for its $2.1
billion IPO in June last year.  The owner of the Formula One racing series would have to
overcome a stocks selloff that’s pushed the MSCI World Index
down 9 percent this month amid concerns that  Greece  may exit the
euro.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Morgan Stanley and UBS AG are
lead managers for Formula One’s IPO, people with knowledge of
the matter said last month. DBS Group Holdings Ltd., CIMB Group
Holdings Bhd and Banco Santander SA have also been retained for
the sale, they said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
