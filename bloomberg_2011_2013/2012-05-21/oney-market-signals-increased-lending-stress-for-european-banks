A money-markets indicator is
signaling that banks are increasingly reluctant to lend to one
another as euro-area leaders discuss the future of the region’s
currency.  Predictions in the forward market for the three-month euro
interbank offered rate relative to overnight indexed swaps,
known as the  FRA/OIS spread , widened for the third day to 39.5
basis points at 8:50 a.m. in  London , data compiled by Bloomberg
show. The measure was 39 on May 18 and reached a three-month
high of 43 on May 14.  German and French leaders are gathering in Berlin before a
May 23 European Union summit amid concern  Greece  will exit
the euro. Group of Eight leaders urged Greece to stay within the
euro area on May 19 as polls in the country showed a close race
between parties supporting and opposing the EU’s bailout deal.  The  Euribor-OIS spread , a measure of banks’ current
willingness to lend to each other, held near 38 basis points for
the 12th day.  The three-month cross-currency basis swap, the cost for
banks to convert euro interest payments into dollars, was 50
basis points below Euribor from minus 53 on May 18. The one-year
 basis swap  was 69 basis points less than Euribor from minus 71.
A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  Lenders increased  overnight deposits  at the Frankfurt-based
 European Central Bank  on May 18, placing 790 billion euros ($1
trillion) with the bank from 762 billion euros the day before.  To contact the reporter on this story:
