Aldar Properties PJSC (ALDAR)  and  Sorouh Real
Estate Co. (SOROUH) , Abu Dhabi’s biggest developers, may appoint Credit
Suisse Group AG and  Morgan Stanley (MS)  to advise on their potential
merger, a person familiar with the matter said.  Aldar, the biggest developer in the United Arab Emirates
capital, may appoint Credit Suisse, the second-biggest Swiss
bank, while Sorouh may give the advisory mandate to Morgan
Stanley, owner of the world’s largest retail brokerage, the
person said, declining to be identified because the matter is
private. An agreement for the advisery mandate may be signed
this week, the person said.  Spokesmen for Aldar and Morgan Stanley said the companies
don’t comment on market speculation, while spokesmen for  Sorouh
and  Credit Suisse (CSGN)  declined to comment.  To contact the reporters on this story:
