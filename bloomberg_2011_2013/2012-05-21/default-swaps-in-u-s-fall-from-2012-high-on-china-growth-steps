A gauge of U.S. corporate credit risk
fell from the highest level of the year as China pledged to take
measures to boost economic growth.  The Markit CDX North America Investment Grade Index, a
credit-default swaps benchmark that investors use to hedge
against losses on corporate debt or to speculate on
creditworthiness, dropped 1.3 basis points to a mid-price of
122.1 basis points at 8:41 a.m. in  New York , according to prices
compiled by Bloomberg. The index had closed at 123.4 Friday, the
highest since Dec. 21.  The gauge declined after Chinese Premier  Wen Jiabao  said
over the weekend that the country will focus on bolstering
growth. Economic expansion in the worldâ€™s second-largest economy
is critical for American corporations relying on international
activity to expand sales and improve balance sheets.  The swaps index typically falls as investor confidence
improves and rises as it deteriorates. The swaps contracts pay
the buyer face value if a borrower fails to meet its
obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A basis point
equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10 million of
debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
