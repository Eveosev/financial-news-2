The ruble strengthened against the
dollar, snapping an 11-day decline, and yields on  Russia ’s
international debt fell as oil, the country’s main export, rose.  The Russian currency gained 0.3 percent to 31.1725 per
dollar by the close in Moscow, the first advance since May 2.
The country’s $3.5 billion of Eurobonds due 2020 rose for the
first day in six, lowering the yield by 11 basis points, or 0.11
percentage point, to 4.052 percent.  Brent crude  gained 1.3 percent to $108.51 per barrel after
the Xinhua News Agency reported Chinese Premier  Wen Jiabao 
saying his country will focus more on bolstering economic
growth, signalling stronger demand for the commodity. The
balance between supply and demand for crude is tightening,
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said in a report.  The ruble was little changed at 39.80 per euro and 35.0549
against the central bank’s target dollar-euro basket. Investors
pared bets on the currency weakening, with non-deliverable
forwards showing the ruble at 31.6689 per dollar in three
months, compared with expectations of 31.704 per dollar on May
18.  To contact the reporter on this story:
