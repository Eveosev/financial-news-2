The naira strengthened the most in
almost three weeks after the central bank sold dollars at an
auction today as reserves increased.  The currency of  Africa ’s largest oil producer appreciated
0.1 percent to 158.875 per dollar as of 4:34 p.m. in Lagos, its
biggest gain on a closing basis since May 2.  Nigeria  sold $150 million at a foreign-currency auction
today, with lenders buying the entire amount on sale, the Abuja-
based  Central Bank of Nigeria  said in an e-mailed statement. The
regulator offers dollars at twice-weekly auctions and on the
interbank market to support the naira by using reserves. The
country’s foreign-exchange reserves have gained  13 percent  this
year to 37.2 billion by May 17, data from the central bank show.  “We expect to see relative stability of the naira as the
central bank intervenes at the auctions and  interbank market  on
the back of growth in foreign-exchange reserves,” analysts at
Lagos-based Cowry Asset Management Ltd., led by Edgar Ebinum,
wrote in an e-mailed note to clients today.  The nation’s bonny light crude traded at $109.30 a barrel,
down from more than $128 in March, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. That compares with Nigeria’s $72 budget benchmark for
2012.  “The risk is obviously that a further decline in the oil
price leads to a deterioration in domestic confidence in the
naira and incremental dollar demand, but we are not there yet
since the Bonny Light is still trading in excess of $100 per
barrel,”  Samir Gadio , an emerging-markets strategist at
Standard Bank Group Ltd. in  London , said in an e-mailed response
to questions from Bloomberg. “The central bank will likely keep
rates on hold tomorrow.”  Rate Decision  Nigeria’s central bank will announce a rate decision
tomorrow. The lender raised its  policy rate  to a record 12
percent in October to check inflation and stabilize the naira.  Inflation in the West African country accelerated to 12.9
percent in April, the fastest since October 2010, from 12.1
percent in March, the  National Bureau of Statistics  said May 15.  The yield on Nigeria’s domestic bonds due 2015 fell two
basis points to 15.28 percent, according to the May 21 data on
the Financial Markets Dealers Association  website . Yields on
Nigerian Eurobonds due 2021 fell four basis points to 5.910
percent in London.  Ghana ’s cedi weakened 0.8 percent to 1.9050 per dollar as
of 3:42 pm in Accra, the capital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
