reinsurer, fell a second day, dropping 5.7 percent to 12.35

was overdone. The shares slipped 0.8 percent on Friday after
advancing 6 percent to 13.2 shillings on May 17, the strongest

some technical analysts a security is overvalued and set for a
reversal.  Oando Plc (OANDO)  , a Nigerian energy company, declined
for a second day, weakening 0.7 percent to 16.60 naira, the
lowest close since May 2. Net income for the year to December
