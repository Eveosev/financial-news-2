Bank of England Governor  Mervyn King ’s response to the financial crisis will be scrutinized
after lawmakers pushed for an inquiry as the central bank
prepares to take over financial regulation.  The Court, the Bank of England’s governing body, ordered a
review of some central bank actions, including its conduct after
the collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. The investigation
will cover the Emergency Liquidity Assistance program in 2008
and 2009, the framework for providing liquidity to banks, and
the Monetary Policy Committee’s forecasting capability, the
Court in London said yesterday.  The move follows a push by a cross-party committee of
lawmakers for an examination of the central bank’s performance
as Parliament debates a bill to give it new powers. While King
told the panel in January that reviews have been carried out of
all the  Bank of England ’s responsibilities, he said last month
he would “welcome” another one if it was deemed necessary.  “It didn’t seem reasonable that we’ve had a massive
financial crisis that required the bank to respond across a
number of fronts, and that its decisions and decision-making
process shouldn’t be reviewed in some independent way,” said
 David Tinsley , an economist at BNP Paribas SA in London and a
former central bank official. “Critics of the bank will say
this isn’t enough.”  Crisis ‘Mistakes’  Andrew Tyrie , who chairs the Treasury Select Committee that
oversees the central bank, said as recently as May 3 that an
examination of the handling of the financial crisis was still
needed because lawmakers “still do not have firm and agreed
conclusions about the mistakes that were made and which the
legislation is, presumably, seeking to address.”  He said yesterday that an inquiry should have been done
“much earlier, before the euro crisis deepened” to aid
lawmakers debating the bill to expand the central bank’s powers.  Tyrie has also criticized the Court, saying in October that
its refusal to disclose its discussions during the financial
crisis was “unsatisfactory” and prevented Parliament from
holding the central bank to account. He also said that he was
“very concerned” on their grasp of funding provided to the
bank’s financial-stability functions.  His panel’s inquiry into accountability at the central bank
included calls for lawmakers to have veto power over the
appointment or dismissal of the governor. Chancellor of the
Exchequer  George Osborne , who will appoint King’s successor when
he retires in June 2013, rejected the recommendation.  Independent Reviews  The reviews will be led by former Bank of England policy
maker Ian Plenderleith;  David Stockton , a former head of U.S.
research and forecasting at the  Federal Reserve ; and  Bill Winters , chief executive officer of Renshaw Bay LLP and a member
of the U.K.’s Independent Commission on Banking.  The Court said it expects to receive the report in October
and will publish it “soon” after that. It ordered the inquiry
because it is “important for the bank to learn practical
lessons from past experience in order to improve the way it
operates,” Chairman David Lees said.  “In the end, the chair of Court does have powers,” said
 Jens Larsen , chief European economist at  RBC Capital Markets  in
London and a former central bank official. “The governor is not
someone who would change his mind easily, but pressure from
Court might have changed his view.”  The inquiry will address the “most intense period of the
financial crisis,” which included the bailout of  Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc , HBOS Plc and Lloyds TSB Group Plc along with
the U.K.’s slide into recession, according to the court.  It will only cover areas where the bank had “sole
responsibility” and will set aside events involving the so-
called tripartite authorities that included the U.K. Treasury
and the Financial Services Authority. It also won’t address the
run on Northern Rock Plc in 2007 as these were covered in the
TSC’s report “The Run on the Rock.”  “I welcome this set of reviews,” King said in the
statement. “Major changes to the operations of the bank have
already been made in the light of the financial crisis. These
detailed, independent reviews will help to ensure that all the
important lessons for the future have been learned.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
