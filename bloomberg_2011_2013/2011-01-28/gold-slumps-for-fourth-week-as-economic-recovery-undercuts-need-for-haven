Gold may decline for a second day in  New York  after dropping to the lowest level in almost four
months on reduced demand for a protection of wealth.  Bullion is down 1.8 percent this week, set for a fourth
weekly loss and the longest losing streak in almost a year.
Prices have dropped as the MSCI World Index of shares yesterday
climbed to the highest level in more than two years and as
exchange-traded product holdings fell to a seven-month low. The  Federal Reserve  this week said the U.S. still needs stimulus to
cut unemployment.  “Optimism is generally rising at present and the risk
appetite of market players is also increasing,” said  Daniel Briesemann , an analyst at  Commerzbank AG  in  Frankfurt . “The
demand for safe haven has dropped considerably.”  Gold futures for April delivery lost $2.30, or 0.2 percent,
to $1,317.50 an ounce at 7:42 a.m. on the Comex in New York,
after earlier falling to $1,309.10, the lowest level since Oct.
1. The metal for immediate delivery in London was 0.2 percent
higher at $1,316.78.  Bullion fell to $1,316 an ounce in the morning “fixing”
in London, used by some mining companies to sell output, from
$1,334.50 at yesterday’s afternoon fixing.  Gold jumped 30 percent last year after governments spent
trillions of dollars and kept interest rates low to bolster
economies.  Europe ’s sovereign-debt crisis also boosted the
metal’s allure. The  MSCI World  Index gained after the Fed this
week said it would continue to support the recovery even as
growth accelerates. Gold reached a record $1,432.50 on Dec. 7.  ‘Reducing Investor Appetite’  Higher equities are “reducing investor appetite for safe-
haven gold,” Mark Pervan, head of commodity research at
Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd., said in a report
today. Appetite for gold has “waned as other markets looked
more attractive.”  Gold held through ETPs fell for a fourth day to 2,037.48
metric tons yesterday, data compiled by Bloomberg from 10
providers show. That’s the lowest level since June 11. Holdings
reached a record 2,114.6 tons last month.  Silver for March delivery in New York declined 0.9 percent
to $26.775 an ounce, after falling to $26.30, the lowest price
since Nov. 18. Silver ETP holdings slipped 21.27 tons to
14,605.08 tons yesterday, the lowest level since Nov. 9, data
from four providers show.  Palladium for March delivery lost 0.8 percent to $807 an
ounce. Platinum for April delivery was 0.6 percent lower at
$1,792.50 an ounce.  To contact the reporters on this story:
