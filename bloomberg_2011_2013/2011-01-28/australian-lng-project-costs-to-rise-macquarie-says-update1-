Liquefied natural gas projects on
 Australia ’s east coast face the risk of cost overruns and delays
because of rising competition for skilled workers,  Wood
Mackenzie  said.  A 10 percent to 30 percent cost increase would decrease the
value of a coal-seam-gas-to-LNG development by as much as 47
percent, Craig McMahon, the firm’s head of upstream research for
Australasia, said in a statement. McMahon is speaking in Perth
today at an oil and gas industry conference.  A one-year delay at an LNG project, without a cost overrun,
would trim a quarter of its value, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
