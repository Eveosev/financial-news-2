Poland’s fiscal situation is crucial
to the country’s international standing and critical perceptions
of the budget by investors could cause the zloty to weaken
rather than appreciate, central bank Deputy Governor Witold
Kozinski was quoted today as saying in an interview in the
newspaper  Gazeta Wyborcza .  The  budget deficit  will become easier to finance if
parliament approves the government proposal to reduce transfers
to private pension funds, Kozinski said, according to Gazeta.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
