  Ghana ’s stocks measure may rise as
much as 40 percent this year, buoyed by a stable currency and
strong economic growth, according to  Fidelity Bank Plc .  “It will grow 35 to 40 percent this year,” Michael Sarfo,
head of corporate finance at the Nigerian lender’s Accra office,
said by phone. “The Ghanaian market follows a heady mentality
and so when the stock market starts doing so much better than
the fixed-income market, everybody starts jumping in.”  Ghana’s currency, the cedi, will stabilize and begin to
strengthen against the U.S. dollar, recovering losses this month
to finish no more than 3 percent lower against the greenback in
2011, Sarfo said. The cedi has weakened 4.4 percent against the
dollar this month, the fourth of declines.  A stable  exchange rate  will give foreign investors
confidence to put capital in Ghanaian equities, knowing they can
remit any gains without a major currency loss, Sarfo said.  The Ghana Stock Exchange’s All Share Index rose 32 percent
last year. The Composite Index, which replaced the All Share
gauge at the start of the year, has risen 5.2 percent in 2011.  The West African nation, which is the world’s second-
biggest cocoa grower after Ivory Coast and the continent’s
largest producer of gold after  South Africa , is forecast to grow
12.3 percent this year from 5.9 percent in 2010 as it sees
returns from the first oil pumped from its offshore Jubilee
field, according to the  Finance Ministry .  To contact the reporter on this story:
