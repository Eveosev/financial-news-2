European retail sales increased at
the fastest rate in more than four years in January, led by
gains in France and  Germany .  A gauge of euro-area retail sales rose to 55.8 this month
from 52.9 in December when adjusted for seasonal swings, London-
based  Markit Economics  said today in a statement. That is the
highest since May 2006, Markit said. The index is based on a
survey of more than 1,000 executives and a reading above 50
indicates expansion.  Europeans’ confidence in the economic outlook held close to
the highest in more than three years in January and the region’s
services and manufacturing industries expanded faster than
economists forecast this month. Growth in the  U.S. economy , the
world’s largest, probably accelerated in the fourth quarter,
driven by consumer spending and exports, economists projected
ahead of a report due later today.  “The first month of 2011 data for euro-zone retailers is
very encouraging, pointing to further positive consumer momentum
in France and Germany and a long-awaited rise in Italian retail
sales,’’ Trevor Balchin, senior economist at Markit, said in the
statement. The “data signal that  consumer spending  will gain
further momentum in the first quarter.”  The January figure was the second-highest since the data
started in January 2004, short of the record 56.3 in May 2006,
Markit said.   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
