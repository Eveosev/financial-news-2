European retail sales increased at
the fastest rate in more than four years in January.  A gauge of euro-area retail sales rose to 55.8 this month
from 52.9 in December when adjusted for seasonal swings, London-
based  Markit Economics  said today in a statement. That is the
highest since May 2006, Markit said. The index is based on a
survey of more than 1,000 executives and a reading above 50
indicates expansion.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
