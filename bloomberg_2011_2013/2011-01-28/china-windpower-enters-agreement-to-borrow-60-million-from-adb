  China WindPower Group Ltd ., a Hong
Kong-listed renewable energy company, will borrow as much as
$240 million from the Asian Development Bank to develop wind
farms in China to meet rising demand.  Proceeds of a $120 million dual-currency loan from ADB will
be used to build and operate as much as 800 megawatts of wind-
power projects mainly in the northeastern province of Jilin by
2013, according to a joint statement handed out to reporters in
Beijing today. ADB has agreed to provide another loan of $120
million, they said.  China is tapping renewable energy like wind and solar power
to reduce its reliance on fossil fuels, targeting to install
150,000 megawatts of  wind turbines  by 2020, according to the
statement.  China  WindPower will increase its  capital spending 
this year, from at least $900 million in 2010, to develop new
plants, Chairman Liu Shunxing told reporters.  “We are very confident of our growth in China,” Liu said.
“Every project that we operate is generating profits and that’s
also why ADB wants to lend the money to us.”  China WindPower, listed in Hong Kong in 2007, operated 12
wind farms with a total capacity of 1,163 megawatts as of the
end of last year, according to the company.  The loans from ADB will meet a “substantial” part of
China WindPower’s financing demand and the company has no
“immediate” plan to borrow more, Liu said.  The shares declined 12 percent in Hong Kong trading last
year, compared with the 5.3 percent gain in the benchmark  Hang
Seng  index. The stock fell 2.6 percent to 76  Hong Kong  cents as
of the midday break.  China WindPower is also considering solar power projects in
the provinces of Gansu, Ningxia and Yunnan, Liu said, without
elaborating.  “As advancements in technology reduce development costs,
we see greater potential in solar than wind over the longer
term,” according to Liu.  To contact the Bloomberg staff on this story:
