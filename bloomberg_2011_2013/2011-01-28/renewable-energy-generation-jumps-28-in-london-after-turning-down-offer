  Renewable Energy Generation Ltd .
jumped as much as 28 percent in  London  after the U.K. power
project developer said it turned down a takeover offer valuing
the company at 67.7 pence a share.  The cash-and-share offer came from an unidentified company
that trades in Britain, Jersey-based Renewable Energy Generation
said today in a filing. Its shares traded at 56 pence, up 27
percent, at 8:51 a.m. local time.  After consulting with several large shareholders, the board
rejected the proposal because it “very significantly
undervalued” the company, it said. Through its wind unit, REG
operates nine wind farms in the U.K. totaling 37.15 megawatts of
capacity, the company said in December.  The board decided “the best way to enhance  shareholder
value ” was to keep to its strategy of investing 100 million
pounds ($159 million) into new U.K. renewable energy projects
during the next two years while “continuing to realize the
latent value in its 560-megawatt development pipeline,”
according to the statement.  To contact the reporters responsible for this story:
