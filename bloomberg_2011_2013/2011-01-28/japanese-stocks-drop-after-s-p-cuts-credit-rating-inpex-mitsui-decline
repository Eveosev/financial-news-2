Japanese stocks declined after the
nation’s credit rating was cut for the first time in nine years
by  Standard &amp; Poor’s , as persistent deflation and political
gridlock undermine efforts to reduce the nation’s debt burden.  Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc., Japan’s biggest
publicly traded bank, slid 2.7 percent. Nippon Steel Corp. fell
2.1 percent after cutting its profit outlook. Canon Inc., the
world’s No. 1 camera maker, sank 3.1 percent after reporting
operating profit that missed its estimate. Advantest Corp., the
world’s biggest maker of memory-chip testers, tumbled 7.4
percent after brokerages cut their stock-price estimates.  “The country’s rating cut had already been factored in by
the stock market, but it may trigger a pause in share
purchases,” said  Kenichi Hirano , general manager and strategist
at Tachibana Securities Co. in Tokyo. “Any impact from the
rating cut on Japanese stocks is limited, but it is negative for
banks that hold  government bonds .”  The Nikkei 225 Stock Average fell 1.1 percent to 10,360.34
as of the close in Tokyo. The Topix lost 1.1 percent to 919.69,
with more than 5 times as many shares declining as gaining. Both
gauges today dropped the most in a week. For the week, the  Nikkei 225  gained 0.8 percent, while the Topix rose 1 percent.  The Topix increased 2.3 percent this year and stocks in the
index were valued at 15.8 times estimated earnings on average,
compared with 13.6 times for the S&P 500 and 11.3 times for the
Stoxx 600.  Japan, the world’s most-indebted nation, had its rating cut
to AA-, the fourth-highest level, putting the country on a par
with  China , which likely passed Japan last year to become the
second-largest economy. The government lacks a “coherent
strategy” to address the nation’s debt of 943 trillion yen ($11
trillion), S&P said yesterday in a statement. The outlook for
the rating is stable, S&P said.  Crude oil for March delivery tumbled $1.69 to $85.64 a
barrel yesterday in New York, the lowest settlement price since
Nov. 30. Gold futures for April delivery fell 1.1 percent to
settle at $1,319.80 an ounce in  New York  yesterday. In after-
hours electronic trading, the price touched $1,311, the lowest
since Oct. 1.  The Baltic Dry Index of shipping costs for commodities
declined 3.9 percent yesterday, falling for an eighth
consecutive day to the lowest level since February 2009.  Next week is the peak for quarterly results in Japan, with
more than a third of the Topix’s 1,662 companies scheduled to
report. Of the 271 that have published net income for the last
quarter, 27 have exceeded analysts’ estimates and 32 have missed
them, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporters on this story:
