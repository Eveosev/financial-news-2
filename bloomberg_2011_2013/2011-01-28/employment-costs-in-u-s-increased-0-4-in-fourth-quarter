U.S. employment expenses rose 0.4
percent in the fourth quarter, less than forecast and capping a
year in which compensation posted the second-smallest increase
on record.  The 0.4 percent gain in the employment cost index from
October through December matched the rise in the prior three
months, Labor Department figures showed today. Labor costs last
year rose 2 percent after a 1.4 percent increase in 2009 that
was the smallest since record-keeping began in 1982.  Companies have been slow to add to their payrolls or offer
higher salaries until demand strengthens further. Unemployment
projected to remain above 9 percent this year and limited price
pressures explain why Federal Reserve policy makers this week
stuck to their plan to buy $600 billion in securities by June to
spur the world’s largest economy.  “Labor costs are very constrained as you’d expect with
high unemployment,” said Guy LeBas, chief fixed-income
strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott LLC in Philadelphia. “It
suggests a very low risk of inflation.”  Economists projected a 0.5 percent rise in labor costs,
according to the median of 51 estimates in a Bloomberg News
survey. Estimates ranged from increases of 0.3 percent to 0.6
percent.  The  U.S. economy  accelerated in the fourth quarter of 2010,
driven by the biggest gain in  consumer spending  in more than
four years and rising exports, the Commerce Department said
today.  Final Sales Surge  Gross domestic product climbed at a 3.2 percent annual pace
from October through December, falling short of the 3.5 percent
median forecast of 85 economists surveyed by Bloomberg and
restrained by the biggest drag from inventories in two decades.
Final sales, which includes all categories except stockpiles,
rose at a 7.1 percent pace, the most since 1984.  Stock-index futures rose after the reports and Treasuries
declined. The March contract on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
gained 0.2 percent to 1,298 at 8:48 a.m. in  New York . The yield
on the benchmark 10-year note increased to 3.43 percent from
3.39 percent late yesterday.  The employment cost index measures the expense to companies
of wages, benefits and employer-paid taxes such as Social
Security and Medicare.  Fed policy makers on Jan. 26 maintained a plan to complete
$600 billion in securities purchases by June, saying the
recovery “has been insufficient to bring about a significant
improvement in labor market conditions.” Longer-term inflation
expectations remain “stable,” they said.  Wages and Salaries  Wages and salaries, which account for about 70 percent of
company expenses, rose 0.4 percent in the fourth quarter, after
a 0.3 percent gain in the prior three months, today’s Labor
Department report showed. Wages increased 1.6 percent in 2010
following a 1.5 percent rise in the previous year that was the
smallest on record.  Benefit costs for all workers, which include some bonuses,
severance pay, health insurance and paid vacations, increased
0.4 percent last quarter. In 2010 they rose 2.9 percent, almost
double the 1.5 percent gain in the previous year and primarily
due to increases in retirement costs, the Labor Department said.  Employment costs for state and local governments rose 0.6
percent, following a third-quarter increase of 0.2 percent. Last
year, these costs climbed 1.8 percent after a 2.3 percent
increase in 2009. The slowdown reflected smaller gains in both
wages and benefits.  State and local governments are also trimming payrolls to
rein in budget deficits.  Private Compensation  Among companies, total compensation costs rose 0.4 percent
for a second quarter. Last year, private employment costs rose
2.1 percent after a 1.2 percent gain in 2009.  Benefit expenses for companies increased 2.9 percent in
2010, up from a 0.9 percent gain the previous year. Employer
costs for health benefits jumped 5 percent last year after
climbing 4.3 percent in 2009.  Lowe’s Cos., the second-biggest U.S. home-improvement
retailer, is among companies trying to use its workforce more
efficiently. The Mooresville, North Carolina-based chain plans
to cut 1,700 middle-management jobs and add 8,000 to 10,000
weekend sales positions to improve staffing at the busiest time
of the week.  In a Bloomberg survey earlier this month, economists
forecast the jobless rate will end 2011 at 9 percent and average
8.6 percent the following year. The rate has exceeded 9 percent
for 20 straight months, the most since monthly records began in
1948.  To contact the reporters on this story:
