  Volkswagen AG , the world’s third-
biggest carmaker, may bring back the Scirocco coupe and Phaeton
sedan to the U.S. as it aims to triple sales in the world’s
second-largest car market.  “We will be looking for opportunities” to return the
Scirocco to the U.S.,  Jonathan Browning , VW’s U.S. chief, said
yesterday in an interview in  Washington . “We will reconsider
bringing the Phaeton back to the U.S. in the next product
cycle,” he said, adding that a decision hasn’t been made yet.  Volkswagen withdrew the 67,400-euro ($92,360) Phaeton,
named after the son of the Greek god Helios, from the U.S. in
2006 after it flopped. The Scirocco, which sells in  Europe  for
22,500 euros, had a cult following in the U.S. during the 1970s
and 1980s and was featured at the time in movies and television
shows such as NBC’s “Saturday Night Live.”  VW targets sales of 1 million vehicles in the U.S. by 2018,
including models by the Audi luxury unit, to close the gap with  Toyota Motor Corp . and  General Motors Co ., the world’s two
biggest automakers. Wolfsburg, Germany-based VW introduced a
larger version of its Passat midsize sedan at the Detroit auto
show in January, its first car built specially for the U.S.  “VW wants to capture U.S. buyers by rolling out more
emotional cars and the Scirocco certainly fits that category,”
said Frank Schwope, a NordLB analyst in Hanover who recommends
buying VW stock. “In terms of volume sales, the Scirocco and
Phaeton are only decorative accents, they won’t be crucial for
VW’s goal to greatly increase deliveries.”  Shares Advance  Volkswagen’s preferred shares rose as much as 2.15 euros,
or 1.8 percent, to 120.20 euros and traded up at 119.35 euros as
of 11:36 a.m. in Frankfurt.  Volkswagen will open a factory in Chattanooga, Tennessee,
by April and start delivering the new Passat, priced at around
$20,000, in the third quarter. The carmaker closed a factory in
Westmoreland County,  Pennsylvania , in 1988.  “We were very, very encouraged by the reaction,” Browning
said of the new model.  The Phaeton has never met the company’s original sales
target of 20,000 vehicles annually. The model, which came on the
market in 2002, cost more than 1 billion euros to produce. VW
produced 7,500 Phaetons last year, the carmaker said Jan. 25.  VW decided in 2006 to build a new version of the Scirocco.
Almost 796,000 Sciroccos were sold worldwide between 1974 and
1992, when it was discontinued. VW has never sold the current
model in the U.S.  Volkswagen is trying to boost sales by capitalizing on
buyers’ memories of popular previous models. The carmaker in
2006 brought back the Rabbit to North America, renaming its
best-selling Golf model for the U.S. market. Volkswagen released
a new version of the Beetle in the late 1990s. The model is
built in  Mexico , primarily to sell in  North America .  To contact the reporters on this story:
