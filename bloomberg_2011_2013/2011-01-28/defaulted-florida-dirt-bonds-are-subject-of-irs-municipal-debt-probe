The  Internal Revenue Service  is
investigating whether districts set up to finance projects such
as real-estate developments with tax-exempt bonds ran afoul of
U.S. rules, according to a bond filing.  The IRS is auditing so-called dirt bonds sold in 2007 by
the Stoneybrook South Community Development District, a special
entity set up to finance infrastructure for a  development  by a
unit of  Lennar Corp . and a Florida partner, according to bond
filings. The securities, backed by assessments on property
owners, defaulted amid the real-estate crash.  The audit is part of a broader investigation into whether
so-called special districts complied with U.S. law concerning
tax-exempt bonds, according to the filing. The IRS has the power
to revoke the tax-free status of interest payments to investors.  The IRS didn’t disclose the precise nature of the
investigation. It asked for records from the district including
copies of property appraisals provided in connection with the  bond issue , and said it had no evidence of wrongdoing.  “Your debt issuance was selected for examination as part
of a project/initiative involving Independent Multi-Functional
Special Districts,” the IRS wrote in a Jan. 14 letter that
Stoneybrook disclosed yesterday. “At this time, we have no
reason to believe that your debt issuance fails to comply with
any of the applicable tax requirements.”  Clifford Gannett, the director of the IRS’s tax-exempt bond
division, didn’t return a phone call and e-mail seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:  William Selway  in  Washington  at
