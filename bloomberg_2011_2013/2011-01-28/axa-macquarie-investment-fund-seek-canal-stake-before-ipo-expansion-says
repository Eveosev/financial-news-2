More than 10 investment funds,
including some run by  Axa SA  and Macquarie Group Ltd., want to
buy stakes in the Madrid water supplier Canal de Isabel II
before its initial public offer, Expansion reported.  The French insurer and the Australian investment bank are
among money managers that made proposals to  Banco Bilbao Vizcaya
Argentaria SA  and Rothschild, the banks advising Madrid’s
regional government on a possible IPO, the Spanish newspaper
reported, citing unidentified people close to the deal.  The advisers have valued the 159-year-old  supplier of
drinking water  at 2.5 billion euros ($3.4 billion) to 3 billion
euros, including 1 billion euros in debt, the report said.  The plan to sell a 49 percent stake may not be carried out
until after elections are held by  Madrid ’s regional government,
owner of Canal de Isabel II, Expansion said. The law firm
Cuatrecasas is advising the water utility, the report said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
