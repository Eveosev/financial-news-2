Bank of  Canada  Governor  Mark Carney 
said “persistent strength” in his country’s dollar is a threat
to economic growth.  “One of the risks to the Canadian economy is persistent
strength in the Canadian dollar,” Carney said in a Bloomberg
Television interview at the World Economic Forum’s annual
meeting in Davos,  Switzerland  today.  The Canadian dollar has risen more than 5 percent against
its U.S. namesake since the start of last year, pushing toward
parity and pressuring exporters. That strength, alongside
ongoing weaknesses in the global economy, is among the “serious
headwinds” facing the economy and a reason the central bank has
kept its benchmark interest rate at 1 percent since September,
Carney said.  With Canada running its largest ever current account
deficit, Carney said policy makers need to boost the country’s
competitiveness. The central bank will take the dollar’s level
and volatility into account when deciding how best to reach its
inflation target. The currency traded at 99.34 cents per  U.S.
dollar  yesterday.  Signs of recovery in the  U.S. economy  are “very welcome”
and set to support Canadian growth, Carney said. He said a risk
to global expansion is that emerging market expansions become
unsustainable and some developing nations now need to implement
“additional tightening” of monetary policy. He didn’t specify
which economies he had in mind.  To contact the reporter on this story:
