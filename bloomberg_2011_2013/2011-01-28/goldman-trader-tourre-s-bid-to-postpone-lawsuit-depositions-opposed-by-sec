A bid by  Fabrice Tourre , the  Goldman
Sachs Group Inc . trader accused of misleading investors in a
product linked to subprime mortgages, to delay the start of
depositions in the lawsuit should be denied, regulators said.  Tourre yesterday asked a federal judge to postpone the Feb.
1 start of depositions in the lawsuit by the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission, partly because he is awaiting documents
from Dusseldorf, Germany-based  IKB Deutsche Industriebank AG , a
“purported ‘victim’ of the alleged fraud.” The SEC opposed
Tourre’s request.  “Tourre’s highly disruptive 11th-hour request for a stay
of depositions should be rejected,” the agency said yesterday
in a filing in federal court in Manhattan. “This action has
been pending for approximately nine months.”  The SEC sued Goldman Sachs and Tourre on April 16, accusing
them of failing to tell investors that hedge fund Paulson & Co.
helped pick underlying securities for a collateralized debt
obligation and planned to bet against them. The SEC reached a
$550 million settlement with New York-based Goldman Sachs in
July. Tourre denies wrongdoing.  The case is SEC v. Goldman Sachs, 10-CV-3229, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of  New York  (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
