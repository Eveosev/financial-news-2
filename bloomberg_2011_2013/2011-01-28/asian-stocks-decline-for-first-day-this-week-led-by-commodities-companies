Asian stocks fell, dragging a
regional benchmark index down for the first time this week, as
Japanese banks dropped after  Standard &amp; Poor’s  cut the nation’s
credit rating, and commodity shares declined.  Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. and Sumitomo Mitsui
Financial Group Inc., Japan’s two biggest publicly traded banks,
sank more than 1.5 percent in Tokyo.  BHP Billiton Ltd . declined
1.1 percent in Sydney.  Cnooc Ltd ., China’s No. 1 offshore oil
producer, slumped 7 percent in Hong Kong after forecasting
production growth will slow this year.  Canon Inc ., the world’s
biggest camera maker, slid 3.1 percent in Tokyo after reporting
lower-than-forecast operating profit.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index fell 0.6 percent to 137.42 as
of 7:26 p.m. in Tokyo, with about three times as many stocks
declining as advancing. Eight of 10 industry groups retreated.  “I would tend to see it as an overreaction because it’s
very hard to see Japan running into anything like the troubles
various European countries have run into,” said  Shane Oliver ,
head of investment strategy in Sydney at AMP Capital Ltd., which
manages about $93 billion. “Monetary tightening to combat
inflation is weighing on Asian shares and making them relatively
more vulnerable.”  The MSCI gauge had its first weekly drop in 1 1/2 months
last week amid concern faster-than-expected economic growth in
China will add pressure on policy makers to accelerate efforts
to tame inflation. The MSCI index is on course for a 0.7 percent
gain this week, and a 0.3 percent decrease this year.  Indexes Decline  Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average lost 1.1 percent today.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index and  South Korea ’s Kospi Index
declined 0.3 percent.  Australia ’s S&P/ASX 200 Index fell 0.7
percent. Malaysia’s FTSE Bursa Malaysia KLCI Index retreated 0.3
percent, completing its biggest weekly drop since May.    India ’s Sensitive Index declined for a third straight day,
on course for the biggest monthly drop since 2008, as lower-
than-estimated earnings from JSW Steel Ltd. fueled concern
rising prices will crimp profits.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell 0.2 percent
today. The index gained 0.2 percent yesterday in  New York ,
rising for a fifth straight day, as home sales and Qualcomm
Inc.’s forecast beat projections by economists and analysts,
offsetting higher-than-estimated jobless claims.  Mitsubishi UFJ sank 2.7 percent to 434 yen in Tokyo.
Sumitomo Mitsui, Japan’s second-biggest publicly traded bank,
lost 1.6 percent to 2,870 yen and Mizuho Financial Group Inc.,
the No. 3, retreated 1.2 percent to 162 yen.  Japan’s credit rating was cut yesterday for the first time
in nine years by Standard & Poor’s as persistent deflation and
political gridlock undermine efforts to reduce a 943 trillion
yen ($11 trillion) debt burden.  Rating Downgrade  Japan, the world’s most indebted nation, had its rating cut
to AA-, the fourth-highest level, putting the country on a par
with  China , which likely passed Japan last year to become the
second-largest economy. The government lacks a “coherent
strategy” to address the nation’s debt, S&P said yesterday in a
statement. The outlook for the rating is stable, S&P said.  Japan’s rating cut “is negative for banks that hold  government bonds ,” said  Kenichi Hirano , general manager and
strategist at Tachibana Securities Co. in Tokyo.  Separately, reports showed Japan’s consumer prices
excluding fresh food declined 0.4 percent in December from a
year earlier, the statistics bureau said today, while the  unemployment rate  fell to 4.9 percent from 5.1 percent.  Energy and material stocks fell the most among the MSCI
index’s industry groups after crude oil tumbled $1.69 to $85.64
a barrel yesterday in New York, the lowest settlement price
since Nov. 30, and gold futures fell 1.1 percent to settle at
$1,319.80 an ounce.  Energy, Materials    BHP Billiton , the world’s largest mining company and
Australia’s biggest oil producer, dropped 1.1 percent to A$44.69
in Sydney and Rio Tinto Group, the world’s No. 3 mining company,
lost 0.3 percent to A$85.82. Newcrest Mining Ltd, Australia’s
largest gold producer, decreased 3.6 percent to A$36.80. Inpex
Corp., Japan’s biggest oil and gas explorer, retreated 1.9
percent to 523,000 yen in Tokyo.  In  Hong Kong , Cnooc slumped 7 percent to HK$17.32. It was
the heaviest single drag on the MSCI index. The company said
yesterday that it plans to increase oil and gas production by 12
percent this year. Output rose about 44 percent last year,
boosting the company’s shares by 51 percent.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index increased 0.4 percent this year
to yesterday, compared with gains of 3.3 percent for the S&P 500
and 2.6 percent for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. Stocks in the
Asian benchmark were valued at 14.1 times estimated earnings on
average at the last close, compared with 13.6 times for the S&P
500 and 11.3 times for the Stoxx 600.  Canon, Advantest  Canon declined 3.1 percent to 4,065 yen in Tokyo. The
company reported operating profit of 387 billion yen for the
year through Dec. 31, lower than its own forecast of 390 billion
yen. Separately, Canon’s share-price target was lowered to 5,392
yen from 5,399 yen by Nomura Holdings Inc., Japan’s largest
brokerage.  Of the 106 companies in the MSCI index that have reported
earnings for the latest quarter, 48 have exceeded analysts’
estimates, while 45 have missed them, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. On Jan. 31, 86 of the 1,019 companies in the gauge
are scheduled to release results.  Advantest Corp. slid 7.4 percent to 1,709 yen in Tokyo, the
third-biggest drop on the MSCI Asia Pacific index. The world’s
largest maker of machines used to test memory chips fell after
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. lowered its share-price estimate to
1,350 yen from 1,410 yen. The brokerage has “sell/neutral” in
the stock.  Hynix, Samsung  Among stocks that climbed today, Hynix Semiconductor Inc.
advanced 5.4 percent to 29,500 won in  Seoul  after Mirae Asset
Securities Co. and Meritz Securities Co. raised their share-
price estimates on the world’s second-largest maker of computer-
memory chips, citing an expected price recovery for the devices.  Also in Seoul, Samsung Electronics Co., the world’s second-
largest maker of mobile phones, rose 1.6 percent to a record-
high close of 1.01 million won after the company reported
fourth-quarter profit that beat analysts’ estimates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
