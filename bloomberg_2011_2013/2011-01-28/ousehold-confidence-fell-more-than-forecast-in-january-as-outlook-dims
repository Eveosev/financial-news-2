Italian  consumer confidence  fell
more than economists forecast in January as households grew
pessimistic about the outlook for economic growth and jobs.  The consumer sentiment index dropped to 105.9 from 109.1 in
December, national statistics office Istat said in Rome today.
The decline was more than the 108.9 median forecast of 14
economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.  Joblessness held in November at the highest since monthly
records began in 2004 after the euro region’s third-biggest
economy expanded 0.3 percent in the third quarter.  Consumer
spending  won’t show a “real recovery” until 2012 after falling
during the worst recession since World War II, retailers’ lobby
 Confcommercio  said in a Jan. 10  report .  The drop in confidence “was due to greater pessimism about
the future economic situation of the country and of families,”
Istat said today. The outlook for the economy reached its lowest
level since March 2009 as households turned negative about their
jobs prospects after expressing optimism in December, according
to the report.  Istat began issuing the confidence survey this month after
Rome-based research institute  Isae  was closed last year as part
of government deficit-cutting measures.  To contact the reporter on this story:
