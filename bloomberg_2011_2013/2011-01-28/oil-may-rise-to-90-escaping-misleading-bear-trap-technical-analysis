Oil is likely to rise to between $88
and $90 a barrel in the coming weeks and yesterday’s decline
below a Bollinger Band support level may mislead investors into
seeking an extended price drop, Cameron Hanover Inc. said.  Crude, set for the biggest weekly decline in  New York  since
November, will rebound if futures settle above $86 a barrel,
said  Peter Beutel , president of the energy adviser in  New
Canaan ,  Connecticut . The market yesterday closed below that
level for the first time since Nov. 30, breaching technical
support on the daily chart indicated by the Bollinger Band.  “The question now is whether prices will eventually break
down,” Beutel said in an e-mailed note. “At this stage, we
could have a bear trap that will preface a renewed attempt to
move higher.”  Oil has fallen 3.9 percent this week on speculation high
prices may derail the economic recovery in the U.S., the world’s
largest crude user. Futures for March delivery on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange  were at $85.62 a barrel in electronic
trading, down 2 cents, at 5:31 p.m. Singapore time.  Bollinger Bands, which plot support and resistance levels
based on volatility, are used by investors to determine entry
points for buying or selling contracts. Crude rebounded in late
August after slipping below the lower band, which is at $85.87 a
barrel today.  Investors may start selling when oil reaches $87.85 a
barrel, with further resistance levels at $89.65 and $90.25,
according to Beutel. If prices fail to settle above $86, the
market may drop to as low as $83.55, a level last traded Nov.
30.  “The longer prices stay above $86, the more likely it is
for prices to stabilize and try to advance,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
