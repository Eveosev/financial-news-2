  Galp Energia SGPS SA , Portugal’s
biggest oil company, said crude production rose in the fourth
quarter as it expands in Angola and develops the Lula project in  Brazil .  Average interest working production gained 8.9 percent to
19,200 barrels a day from a year earlier and average net
entitlement output increased 9.7 percent to 13,400 barrels a
day, Lisbon-based Galp said today. Natural-gas sales rose 12
percent to 1.34 billion cubic meters while the volume of
refined-product sales fell 5.1 percent.  The company processed 15 percent less crude as it linked
new units at its Oporto refinery and carried out maintenance,
said a Galp spokesman who asked not to be named because of
company policy.  Galp is expanding exploration in regions such as Brazil’s
offshore  Santos Basin , where the Lula field is located, and  Angola  to improve access to supplies and rely less on refining
and sales of fuel in Portugal and  Spain .  Galp shares rose as much as 2.1 percent, and were up 25
cents at 14.75 euros as of 12:48 p.m. in Lisbon. The stock has
gained 3 percent this year, giving the company a market value of
12 billion euros ($16 billion).  Eni SpA , Italy’s biggest oil
company, and Portuguese holding company Amorim Energia BV each
control a third of Galp.  Galp plans to invest as much as 4.5 billion euros through
2014 in projects including Lula and refinery conversions to
raise diesel output and improve profit margins. Galp aims to
raise production 10-fold to 150,000 barrels a day in 12 years.
Galp is also investing in the Tombua-Landana project in Angola.  The company has stakes in four offshore blocks in Brazil’s
Santos Basin, including the Lula and Jupiter finds.  Petroleo
Brasileiro SA , Brazil’s state-controlled oil company, is
developing offshore deposits that include the Americas’ two
largest oil discoveries since  Mexico ’s Cantarell field in 1976.  The Rotterdam cracking refining margin, a measure of profit
from turning a barrel of crude into fuels, widened to $1.60 a
barrel in the fourth quarter from breakeven a year earlier, the
company said. Galp’s refinery in Oporto can process about 90,000
barrels a day, while its Sines site has a 220,000-barrel-a-day
capacity.  Galp is due to report fourth-quarter earnings on Feb. 11.  To contact the reporter on this story:
