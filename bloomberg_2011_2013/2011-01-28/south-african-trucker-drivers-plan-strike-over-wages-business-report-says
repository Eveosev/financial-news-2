South African truckers plan to
strike from Feb. 13 in a dispute over wages, Business Report
said, citing the South African Transport and Allied Workers’
Union.  Labor unions are demanding a 20 percent increase for 2011
and 2012, while the Road Freight Employers’ Association is
offering 15 percent, the Johannesburg-based newspaper said. The
work stoppage will be joined by the Transport and Allied
Workers’ Union of  South Africa  and the Professional Transport
Workers’ Union, it said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
