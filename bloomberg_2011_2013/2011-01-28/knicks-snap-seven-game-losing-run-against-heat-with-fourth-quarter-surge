Amar’e Stoudemire scored a team-high
24 points as the  New York Knicks  surged past the Miami Heat in
the fourth quarter to win 93-88.  Landry Fields hit a 3-pointer with 49 seconds left to give
the Knicks an 89-84 lead at Madison Square Garden in  New York 
last night. Raymond Felton added four free throws in the final
15 seconds of the National Basketball Association game to seal
the victory.  The Knicks outscored Miami 29-15 in the fourth quarter to
snap a seven-game losing streak against their opponent and
improve to 24-21. The win follows a pair of defeats against the
Heat in December.  “We lost two times against them and we wanted to get this
win,”  Danilo Gallinari  said. “Now we know we can beat them.”  Gallinari had 20 points and Fields added 19 as the Knicks
got their second straight win.  New York is second in the Eastern Conference Atlantic
Division behind the  Boston Celtics .  The Heat had a two-point halftime lead, which they extended
to 73-64 at the end of the third quarter.    Dwyane Wade  led Miami with 34 points, while LeBron James
got 10 of his 24 points in the final quarter. Chris Bosh missed
the game with a sprained left ankle.  The Heat dropped to 31-14 with their fifth loss in six
games and are now 1 1/2 games ahead of the Orlando Magic atop
the Eastern Conference Southeast Division.  To contact the reporter on this story:
