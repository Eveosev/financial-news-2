  Taiwan  reduced the feed-in tariffs
for solar power for 2011 contracts by about 30 percent from last
year’s level because of the falling cost of installing equipment
that converts sunlight into energy.  State-run Taiwan Power Co. will pay NT$7.33 (25 cents) a
kilowatt-hour for power generated from ground solar panels,
compared with NT$11.12 for 2010, the Ministry of Economic
Affairs said in a statement today. The 2011 price for roof-top
solar power is as high as NT$10.32.  Solar cell prices may decline 10 percent to 15 percent this
year, said Chang Ping-heng, chief executive officer of  Motech
Industries Inc ., Taiwan’s biggest solar cell maker by market
value. Global annual capacity to produce solar cells may climb
to as much as 30 gigawatts in 2011, Chang said Dec. 1. The
estimate exceeds 2011 global demand projection from technology
researcher Isuppli by about 35 percent.  “Solar power costs may fall further,” Hwang Jung-chiou,
vice minister of economic affairs, said in a press conference in
Taipei today.  The new floor price is NT$2.61 for electricity generated by
wind, the ministry said. The government aims to have 100
megawatts of onshore wind power capacity and 70 megawatts of
photovoltaic panels installed this year, it said.  Prices Paid  Feed-in tariffs, or the prices paid to generators by Taiwan
Power, the island’s monopoly grid operator, are at least
NT$11.12 per kilowatt-hour for photovoltaic solar panels
installed in 2010 and NT$2.38 for wind farms, the Bureau of
Energy said in a statement on its  website  in December 2009. That
compared with an average cost of NT$2.06 per kilowatt-hour for
fossil fuels such as coal and oil.  Taiwan’s government set feed-in tariffs for electricity
generated by solar panels and  wind turbines  at higher levels
than for those for power from fossil fuels to spur production of
renewable energy. President Ma Ying-jeou, who took office in May
2008, has pledged to cut emissions to 2000 levels by 2025.
Lawmakers approved the island’s Renewable Energy Development Act
in 2009.  To contact the reporter on the story:
