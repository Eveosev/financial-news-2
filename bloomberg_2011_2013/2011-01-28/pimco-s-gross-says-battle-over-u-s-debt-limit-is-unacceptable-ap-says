Treasuries are poised to fall as the
debate on increasing the  U.S. debt  limit intensifies,  Bill Gross ,
who runs the world’s biggest bond fund at Pacific Investment
Management Co., was quoted by  Associated Press  as saying.  Treasuries “will sell off as this get more press and with
more invective,” Gross said according to AP. “Investors like
us, we sell now.”  The battle over the debt limit sends the wrong message to
investors outside the U.S., Gross was quoted as saying.  This gives a signal to countries that own U.S. debt that
“their assets are hostage to a rogue Congress,” he said.
“It’s unacceptable.” Gross said he still favors a balanced
budget, according to AP.  To contact the reporter on this story:
