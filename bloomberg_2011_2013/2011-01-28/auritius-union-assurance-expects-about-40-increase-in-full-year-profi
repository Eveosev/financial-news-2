  Mauritius Union Assurance Co ., the
country’ biggest general insurance company by market value,
expects full-year profit to jump about 40 percent from a year
earlier, Chief Executive Officer Kris Lutchmenarraidoo said.  The increase in net income is partly due to the sale of
shares to help fund the purchase of La Prudence Mauricienne Ltd.
for 800 million rupees ($27.3 million) in May last year,
Lutchmenarraidoo said in an interview yesterday in Port Louis,
the Indian Ocean island nation’s capital.  “We expect profit for the financial year through December
2010 to exceed 450 million rupees,” he said. The company earned
316 million rupees in after-tax profit in 2009.  MUA held assets of 8.8 billion rupees at end of 2010 and
manages about 155,000 policy holders in life and general
insurance, according to the company. It also operates in
Seychelles. Lutchmenarraidoo succeeded Jacques de Navacelle as
chief executive officer on Jan. 1.  The company plans to boost its 6.5 billion-rupee investment
portfolio by 10 percent a year, Lutchmenarraidoo said.  It is seeking to buy a stake in a Madagascar insurer, after
that country’s government said it may sell one of its two state-
run insurance companies and will look for opportunities to
expand into other African markets, such as Botswana and  Uganda ,
he said.  “Partnership with local entities is the best option,”
Lutchmenarraidoo said. “We can bring the know-how.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
