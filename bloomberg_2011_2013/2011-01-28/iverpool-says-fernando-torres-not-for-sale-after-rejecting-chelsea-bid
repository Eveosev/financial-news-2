Liverpool striker  Fernando Torres 
isn’t for sale, the Premier League soccer club said after
rejecting a bid from Chelsea.  The Sun newspaper reported today that Chelsea may increase
its offer to 50 million pounds ($79.5 million) after having a 40
million pound bid turned down. Liverpool issued a statement
today reiterating its stance over the Spanish World Cup winner.  “Chelsea have made a bid for Fernando which was turned
down,” the  club’s statement  said. “The player is not for
sale.”  Torres, 26, has scored 81 goals in 142 games since joining
Liverpool from Atletico Madrid in 2007 for a club-record fee of
about 20 million pounds.  Chelsea also failed to reach an agreement with Benfica to
sign defender David Luiz, the Portuguese soccer team said in a
regulatory filing. Negotiations have ended for now, Benfica
said.  European soccer’s month-long midseason transfer period ends
Jan. 31.  To contact the reporter on this story:
