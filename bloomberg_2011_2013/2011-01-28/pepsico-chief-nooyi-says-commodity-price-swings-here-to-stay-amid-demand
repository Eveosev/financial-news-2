Commodity price swings are “here to
stay,” said  Indra Nooyi , chief executive officer of PepsiCo
Inc., the world’s largest snack-food maker.  As demand continues to grow east of the Middle East and
with “environmental shocks” in various parts of the world that
impact supply, there will be imbalances that lift prices, Nooyi
told Erik Schatzker on Bloomberg Television’s “In the Loop” at
the  World Economic Forum  in Davos,  Switzerland .  PepsiCo is “very careful” to hedge its raw-material
requirements, after oil prices surged five years ago before
falling, she said.  “Many of us hedged at those prices, and the next year the
prices crashed,” Nooyi said. “We are managing it very, very
carefully this time. We’re more selective in where we take a
hedge position and where we don’t, and we hedge strategically, a
little bit at a time as opposed to large hedge positions, which
we took about four years ago.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
