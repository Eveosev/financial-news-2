A European Union report next month
will show that moving to a stricter emissions-reduction target
will be cost-effective for the 27-nation bloc, Climate
Commissioner Connie Hedegaard said.  The European Commission, the EU regulatory, is due to
present a scenario in March for reaching its internal long-term
targets for cutting  greenhouse gases  that cause scientists say
cause global warming. The bloc, aiming to be a leader in the
worldwide fight against  climate change , is poised to meet its
2020 goal of cutting emissions by 20 percent from 1990 levels
and aims to reduce them by as much as 95 percent in 2050.  The coming report will set a mid-term target for 2030 and
“prove that it is cost-efficient, cost-effective to move up
more than 20 percent in the short term,” Hedegaard said in an
interview at the  World Economic Forum  in Davos,  Switzerland .  The EU has said it is ready to tighten its 2020 target to
30 percent if other countries follow suit. It has stopped short
of doing so in the past two years, citing a lack of comparable
effort by the U.S. and  China .  Member states remain at odds on whether the bloc should
pursue a more-ambitious target. French, German and U.K.
officials called on the EU last year to move to a 30 percent
target or risk falling behind the U.S. and China in developing
low-carbon technology. Countries including Hungary and  Poland 
have said the bloc should be cautious about stricter goals.  China wants to cut carbon emissions per unit of gross
domestic product by as much as 45 percent of 2005 levels by
2020. As part of its international  climate pledge , the U.S. said
it will cut greenhouse gases by 17 percent below their 2005
level by 2020, and a bill that has been shelved set a 42 percent
carbon-reduction for the world’s biggest economy in 2030.  “We do not have to do it as steep as that because we are
doing more in the short term, but in  Europe , we also have to do
substantially more up to 2030,” Hedegaard said today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
