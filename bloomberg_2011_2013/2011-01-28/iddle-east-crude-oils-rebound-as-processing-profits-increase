Middle East crude oils rebounded
against their benchmarks after falling earlier this week as
gains in processing profits for refiners supported prices.  Lower Zakum, produced by Abu Dhabi National Oil Co., for
March loading rose 2 cents to a premium of 10 cents a barrel
over its official selling price, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Qatar Marine climbed 2 cents to a premium of 8 cents
a barrel over its official level.  Both grades yield a large amount of gasoil, or  diesel fuel ,
after basic processing. Gasoilâ€™s premium to Dubai crude, a sign
of refiner profit, rose 14 cents today to $16.93 a barrel,
according to data from PVM Oil Associates Ltd.  Oman oil for immediate loading decreased 39 cents, or 0.4
percent, to $93.56 a barrel, according to Bloomberg data. Dubai
for loading in March was down 14 cents, or 0.2 percent, at
$93.32. Murban crude fell 0.2 percent to $96.20.  Oman futures for March delivery rose 6 cents to $93.21 a
barrel on the  Dubai Mercantile Exchange  at 4:49 p.m. Singapore
time, with 1,310 contracts traded. The settlement price was set
at $93.27 at 12:30 p.m. Dubai time.  The Brent-Dubai exchange for swaps for March, or EFS,
narrowed 10 cents to $4.30 a barrel, according to data from PVM
Oil Associates Ltd. A wider spread limits the ability of Asian
refiners to import Russian Urals or Nigerian crudes that are
priced versus the Brent benchmark. The exchange for swaps for
April decreased 1 cent to $4.05.  To contact the reporter on this story:
