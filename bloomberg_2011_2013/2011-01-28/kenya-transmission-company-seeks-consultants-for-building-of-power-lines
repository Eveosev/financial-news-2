Kenya Electricity Transmission Co. 
said it’s seeking consultants to supervise the construction of
six 132-kilovolt  power lines  and sub-stations.  The power lines will cover a distance of 403 kilometers
(250 miles), the state-owned power-grid operator said in a
statement published in the Nairobi-based Standard newspaper
today. Companies have until Feb. 18 to express an interest in
the project, it said.  “The government of  Kenya  has received a loan from the
African Development Fund and intends to apply part of the
proceeds of the loans to eligible payments under the contract
for consultancy services,” the company said.  Kenya, with a population of 39 million, plans to more than
double the number of people who have access to the national
electricity grid by 2020. About 23 percent of the population is
currently connected to the grid, compared with 6 percent in
2003, according to the Energy Ministry.  The East African nation further plans to increase installed
power capacity almost nine-fold to 9,000 megawatts over the next
20 years, Joel Kiilu, chief executive officer of Ketraco, said
Oct. 12.  To contact the reporter on this story:
