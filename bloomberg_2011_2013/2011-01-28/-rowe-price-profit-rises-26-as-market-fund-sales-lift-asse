T. Rowe Price Group Inc., the asset
manager that has posted a profit every quarter since going
public in 1986, said fourth-quarter earnings climbed 26 percent,
aided by rising markets and new client deposits.  Net income increased to $190.8 million, or 72 cents a
share, from $152 million, or 57 cents, a year earlier, the
Baltimore-based company said today in a statement. The average
estimate of 20 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was for earnings
of 68 cents a share, excluding certain items.  “They are very steady and consistent,” Jason Weyeneth, an
analyst in  New York  with Sterne, Agee & Leach Inc., said in a
telephone interview before the earnings were released. “They’re
well positioned to garner equity flows as demand improves.”
Weyeneth, who gives the company a “neutral” rating, expected
T. Rowe to earn 63 cents a share.  T. Rowe Price benefited as the average value of the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index in the quarter gained 11 percent
over the same period in 2009. Investors poured a net $6.9
billion into the firm’s mutual funds and institutional accounts,
helping increase the amount under management by 9.6 percent to a
record $482 billion.  Revenue rose 19 percent to $647.5 million, driven by a 21
percent increase in investment advisory fees. Expenses climbed
17 percent to $364.7 million as compensation-related costs
increased 11 percent.  Lehman Losses  T. Rowe spent $16.4 million to absorb realized,
undistributed losses in three  money market funds , decreasing
earnings by 4 cents a share. The losses stemmed from debt issued
by Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., which declared bankruptcy in
September 2008.  Investor deposits included $1.3 billion into target-date
retirement accounts, which gathered $7.5 billion in 2010. All
mutual funds attracted $3.2 billion, including $1.7 billion to
stock and blended funds and $1.4 billion to bond funds. Market
appreciation and income added $20.7 billion to funds in the
quarter.    BlackRock Inc ., the world’s largest money manager, said
Jan. 25 that fourth-quarter net income more than doubled to $657
million, driven by its 2009 acquisition of  Barclays Global
Investors . Asset managers  Invesco Ltd ., Franklin Resources Inc.
and Janus Capital Group all reported higher profit yesterday,
due largely to stock-market gains. Net income for the three
months through December rose 58 percent at Atlanta-based
Invesco, 41 percent at Franklin, based in  San Mateo ,  California ,
and 78 percent at Denver-based Janus.  T. Rowe and Franklin are the only of those firms to have
net deposits, with Franklin adding $3.2 billion. BlackRock had
$14.8 billion in withdrawals, while Invesco saw $17 billion.
Janus had its sixth straight quarter of redemptions.  Results were announced before the start of regular U.S.
trading. The company has risen 35 percent in the past year,
while the Standard & Poor’s 15-member index of asset managers
and custody banks rose 19 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
