  Ghana ’s cedi slumped to the
weakest level on record versus the dollar as offshore
lenders sold the currency amid uncertainty about the
government’s plans to sell debt this year.  The currency of the world’s second-biggest cocoa
producer depreciated as much as 0.5 percent to 1.5575 per
dollar and traded 0.1 percent weaker at 1.5513 by 1:03 p.m.
in Accra from a close of 1.5495 yesterday. That’s the
lowest level since July 2007, when the nation removed four
zeros from the cedi after inflation averaged almost 19
percent in the preceding six years.  “Offshore guys at the beginning of the year, they had
the expectation of a bond auction,” Chris Nettey, a
currency trader at Standard Bank Group Ltd.’s Ghanaian
unit, said in a telephone interview. “The central bank
never said anything about when it would hold that auction.
They just want to get out now. They don’t want to see what
happened in 2009 happen again.”  The currency depreciated 15 percent against the dollar
in the first half of 2009 as the global recession eroded
demand for commodities and curbed foreign earnings for so-
called frontier-market nations on the continent.  No one was immediately available to comment at the
Bank of Ghana’s treasury department, according to an
official who answered the phone and did not identify
himself. Kwabena Duffuor, Ghana’s finance minister, was
also unavailable, said a person who answered the phone in
his office in Accra.  To contact the reporter on this story:
