Japan’s government issued alerts
after a volcano on the southern island of Kyushu erupted for the
first time in 52 years, causing the evacuation of homes and
cancellation of more than 60 flights.  Shinmoedake, in the Kirishima range, erupted yesterday,
spewing ash as high as 2,500 meters (8,200 feet) into the air,
Japan’s Meteorological Agency said in a  statement  on its website.
A second eruption occurred today at about 1 p.m. local time,
national broadcaster NHK  reported . Ash from the volcano reached
Miyazaki city, 50 kilometers (30 miles) to the east, according
to the broadcaster.  Japan Airlines Corp. canceled 37 flights to or from nearby
Miyazaki airport, according to its website today. Three
additional flights will be scrapped tomorrow, it said. All
Nippon Airways Co.,  Asia ’s largest listed carrier, canceled 24
flights affecting 3,350 people, spokeswoman Nana Kon said by
phone today.  Japan’s weather agency issued a level 3 alert for
Shinmoedake and Sakurajima volcano to the south, indicating an
eruption “may seriously affect places near residential areas.”
Some residents near Shinmoedake left the area voluntarily
yesterday before returning to their homes, the Mainichi
newspaper reported. Areas are evacuated when the alert reaches
the maximum level 5.  Sakurajima had 1,026 incidents of volcanic activity in 2010,
the most since at least 1982, according to the Meteorological
Agency.  Active Volcanoes  Japan has 108 active volcanoes representing about 10
percent of the world’s total. Forty-three people died after
Mount Unzen, about 110 kilometers northwest of Shinmoedake,
erupted in 1991. About 15,000 people were evacuated after the
eruption of Mount Usu on the northern island of Hokkaido in 2000.  Around the world, 17 volcanoes are currently active
including three in Japan, three in  Russia ’s Kamchatka peninsula,
two in  Indonesia  and one in  Hawaii , according to the  Smithsonian
Institution’s Global Volcanism Program .  The eruption of Iceland’s Eyjafjallajökull volcano last
April grounded 100,000 flights in six days. An estimated 750
tons of volcanic material was released into the air every second
from the 5,466-foot mountain, according to the  Icelandic
Institute of Earth Sciences ’ website.  When Mount Pinatubo disgorged in the  Philippines  in 1991,
about 20 million tons of sulfur dioxide was sent into the
stratosphere, causing global temperatures to drop by about 1
degree Fahrenheit (0.6 degrees Celsius) until 1993, according to
the  U.S. Geological Survey .  To contact the reporter on this story:
