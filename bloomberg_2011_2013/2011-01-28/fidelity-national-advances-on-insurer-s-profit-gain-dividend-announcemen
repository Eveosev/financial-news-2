  Fidelity National Financial Inc .,
the largest U.S. title insurer, rose the most since October as
the insurer set a higher-than-expected dividend after fourth-
quarter profit climbed.  The quarterly payout will be 12 cents a share, compared
with the 10-cent estimate based on data compiled by Bloomberg.
The dividend for the Jacksonville, Florida-based company was
previously 18 cents.  The dividend change “enhances our longer-term liquidity
profile, continues our strategy of conservatively managing our
balance sheet and liquidity position during uncertain times and
provides additional holding company financial flexibility
throughout 2011,” the insurer said in a statement late
yesterday.  Fourth-quarter net income climbed 89 percent to $130.8
million, or 58 cents a share, from $69.3 million, or 30 cents, a
year earlier, the company said. Full-year profit increased 66
percent to $370 million. The insurer also said yesterday it
doubled a stock-repurchase program, allowing the buyback of 10
million shares through July 31, 2012.  The insurer climbed 49 cents, or 3.5 percent, to $14.64 at
9:33 a.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The
stock climbed about 9 percent in the past year through
yesterday.  Title insurers use their records and public documents to
verify a seller is the home’s true owner and that the property
is free from liens.  To contact the reporter on this story:
