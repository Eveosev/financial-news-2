Andy Murray beat  David Ferrer  in
four sets to reach his second straight Australian Open final.  Murray, the No. 5 seed from Britain, defeated the seventh-
seeded Spaniard 4-6, 7-6 (7-2), 6-1, 7-6 (7-2) at Melbourne
Park’s Rod Laver Arena. He’ll meet Serbia’s Novak Djokovic, who
took the title three years ago, in the Jan. 30 final.  It’s the third time Murray will be contesting a tennis
Grand Slam final, after losing to Roger Federer at both the 2008
U.S. Open and in Melbourne last year. The last man from the U.K.
to win one of the sport’s four major titles was  Fred Perry , in
the U.S. National Championships in 1936.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
