Morgan Stanley advised selling the
pound against the dollar, saying a contraction of gross domestic
product and Bank of England Governor  Mervyn King ’s reluctance to
raise interest rates will weigh on sterling.  The drop in GDP and this week’s speech by King are “game
changers that make us believe the pound will underperform in
coming weeks,” currency strategists Tim Davis in London and
Yilin Nie in  New York  wrote in an investor report yesterday.  Investors should bet the pound will weaken to $1.5475, the
analysts wrote. Sterling was 0.1 percent weaker at $1.5907 as of
6:48 a.m. in London.  Morgan Stanley analysts also wrote in the report they ended
a recommendation to sell the euro against the dollar after the
17-nation currency strengthened.  “We remain euro bears, but with more discretion,”
strategist Ronald Leven wrote in the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
