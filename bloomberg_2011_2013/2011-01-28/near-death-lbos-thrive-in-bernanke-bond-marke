The biggest leveraged buyouts from
the takeover boom, once seen as almost certain bankruptcies by
derivatives traders, are seeing borrowing costs tumble to the
lowest since 2007.  Credit-default swaps on Clear Channel Communications Inc.,
Univision Communications Inc., Freescale Semiconductor Inc. and
former Harrah’s Entertainment Inc., which in February 2009
priced in an average 99.8 percent chance of default, now imply
46.6 percent odds of a collapse, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Harrah’s bonds have soared to 97 cents on the dollar
from 13 cents two years ago.  As the  Federal Reserve  holds benchmark  interest rates  near
zero to stimulate the economy,  Blackstone Group LP , KKR & Co.
and other  private-equity  firms are taking advantage of record
investor demand for high-yield debt to refinance buyout-related
loans and bonds. Last year saw $93 billion worth of leveraged
buyouts worldwide, more than triple the figure in 2009,
according to Bloomberg data.  “You have a lot of money searching for yield, and when
that happens, a lot of folks can get money regardless of the
situation of their balance sheet and income statement,” said
Lon Erickson, a money manager who helps oversee $9 billion of
fixed-income assets for Thornburg Investment Management Inc. in  Santa Fe ,  New Mexico .  Yields on the bottom tier of junk debt, with ratings of CCC
and lower, declined to within 8.12 percentage points of
Treasuries this week, the least since November 2007, according
to Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data. The spread widened
to 44.3 percentage points in December 2008 in the aftermath of
Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.’s bankruptcy.  Distressed Sales  Realogy Corp. led $4.8 billion of sales this month by
companies graded Caa1 or lower by Moody’s Investors Service,
after $43.7 billion in 2010, Bloomberg data show. Last year’s
issuance was triple the $14.1 billion in 2009.  Some LBOs still face challenges to refinance debt,
including Energy Future Holdings Corp., the largest buyout in
history. Swap prices are 1,908.6 basis points on Energy Future
after natural gas prices slumped following KKR and TPG Capital’s
$43.2 billion takeover of the former TXU Corp. in 2007. That
implies an 81 percent chance of default within five years, CMA
data show.  Lisa Singleton, a spokeswoman for Dallas-based Energy
Future, declined to comment.  Relative Yields  Elsewhere in credit markets, the extra yield investors
demand to own company bonds worldwide instead of similar
maturity government debt was unchanged at 160 basis points, or
1.6 percentage points, according to Bank of America Merrill
Lynch’s Global Broad Market Corporate Index. Yields averaged
3.948 percent.  The risk of  Egypt  defaulting rose to the highest since May
2009 as protests against President Hosni Mubarak’s rule spread.  Credit-default swaps on the country’s bonds climbed 9 basis
points to 385, according to CMA. That added to a 26 percent
jump this week, the most since October 2008.  Bonds from New York-based Morgan Stanley were the most
actively traded U.S. corporate securities by dealers yesterday,
with 127 trades of $1 million or more, according to Trace, the
bond-price reporting system of the Financial Industry Regulatory
Authority.  Marathon Petroleum Corp. sold $3 billion of bonds, the
biggest non-financial U.S. offering in almost three months, as
it prepares to be spun off from Marathon Oil Corp.  The $750 million of five-year securities pay 155 basis
points more than similar-maturity Treasuries and the $1 billion
of 10-year notes yield 175 basis points more than benchmarks,
Bloomberg data show. The $1.25 billion of 30-year bonds pay a
200 basis-point spread.  Biggest Sale  The offering is the biggest by a non-financial U.S. company
since Coca-Cola Co. sold $4.5 billion of debt on Nov. 4,
Bloomberg data show. Petroleo Brasileiro SA issued $6 billion of
bonds last week, the largest non-financial offering this year,
the data show.  Commercial paper outstanding increased for the first time
since October, led by financial issuers as bank lending to
companies is poised to rise for a third straight month. The
seasonally adjusted market for short-term IOUs rose $71.1
billion to $988.4 billion, the biggest increase since January
2009, Bloomberg data show.  Leveraged Loans  The Standard & Poor’s/LSTA US Leveraged Loan 100 Index
gained for a fourth day yesterday, rising 0.11 cent to 96 cents
on the dollar, the highest level since November 2007. The index
tracks the 100 largest dollar-denominated first-lien leveraged
loans.  Leveraged loans and  junk bonds  are rated below Baa3 at
Moody’s or less than BBB- at S&P.  Continental AG,  Europe ’s second-biggest tiremaker, began
talks with lenders to refinance 5.3 billion euros ($7.3 billion)
in loans coming due next year, according to three people with
knowledge of the discussions, who asked not to be identified
because the negotiations are confidential.  Toyota Motor Corp. sold $1 billion of bonds through its
finance arm in an offering backed by auto loans, according to a
person familiar with the transaction. A $273 million slice
maturing in one year yields 17 basis points more than benchmark
rates, said the person, who declined to be identified because
terms aren’t public.  In emerging markets, relative yields increased 9 basis
points to 244 basis points, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.
index data.  Clear Channel Swaps  The average cost of default swaps on Clear Channel,
Univision, Freescale and Caesars Entertainment Corp., the Las
Vegas-based casino operator formerly called Harrah’s, declined
to 736 basis points from 8,963 in February 2009, as the economy
recovers from the worst recession since the 1930s and access to
debt markets opens for even the least creditworthy companies.  Current prices mean it would cost the equivalent of
$736,000 a year to protect $10 million of debt against default
for five years.  Swaps on Clear Channel’s debt dropped by 50 percent since
June to 922.3, the lowest level since May 2008, CMA data show.  At their peak, the contracts priced in 100 percent odds the
San Antonio-based company would default within five years, based
on an expectation that investors would recover 40 percent of
face value of the bonds if it failed to meet its obligations,
CMA data show. Prices now imply a 55 percent probability of
default for the company, bought by Bain Capital Partners LLC and  Thomas H. Lee Partners  LP for $17.9 billion in July 2008.  Swaps on Freescale dropped yesterday to 579.3 basis points,
the least since November 2007, CMA prices show.  ‘Never Missed Payment’  “Freescale did not default on its debt and we have never
missed an interest payment since going private in 2006,” said
Robert Hatley, a spokesman for the Austin, Texas-based company,
which was taken private by Blackstone,  Carlyle Group , Permira
Advisers LLP and TPG for $17.6 billion in 2006.  Contracts on Caesars, purchased by Leon Black’s Apollo
Management LP and TPG for $30.7 billion, fell to 901 basis
points on Jan. 3, the lowest since January 2008. The casino
operator’s $470.5 million of 10.75 percent notes due in 2016
rose to 97 cents on the dollar yesterday, after plunging to 13
cents in February 2009.  Swaps on U.S. Spanish-language broadcaster Univision,
bought for $13.7 billion in 2007 by investors including Madison
Dearborn Partners LLC, are down 56 percent from February 2010
and reached 533.2 basis points on Jan. 5, the least since
November 2007.  Credit-default swaps pay the buyer face value if a borrower
fails to meet its obligations, less the value of the defaulted
debt.  Univision Bonds  New York-based Univision issued $315 million of 8.5 percent
debt on Jan. 10, graded Caa2 by Moody’s and CCC+ by S&P,
Bloomberg data show.  Moody’s raised its outlook on Univision to stable from
negative in October after the company planned a refinancing and
resolved a licensing dispute with  Mexico ’s Grupo Televisa SA.  A so-called maturity wall of loans and bonds maturing
through 2014 that JPMorgan estimated in November at $756 billion
is being reduced as speculative-grade companies sell debt and
amend credit agreements to push out repayment schedules. High-
yield companies have issued $27.7 billion this year, following a
record $287.2 billion in 2010, Bloomberg data show. The maturity
wall was reduced by at least $393 billion since the start of
2009, according to JPMorgan.  Spreads Narrow  Relative yields on speculative-grade bonds declined 42
basis points this month to 499 basis points, Bank of America
Merrill Lynch index data show. It fell below 5 percentage points
on Jan. 26 for the first time since Nov. 8, 2007.  “A lot of this is happening because of the very
accommodative monetary policy by the Fed,” said Hans Mikkelsen,
an analyst at Bank of America Merrill Lynch Global Research in  New York . “The real test of this will be what happens when the
Fed gets closer to actually withdrawing some of this liquidity
from the markets.”  Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  and his colleagues said this
week they are maintaining plans to buy $600 billion of
Treasuries through June, as the central bank seeks to reduce
unemployment. The Fed left its benchmark interest rate in a
range of zero to 0.25 percent, where it’s been since December
2008, and retained a pledge in place since March 2009 to keep it
“exceptionally low” for an “extended period.”  Liquidity Grades  The number of companies with Moody’s lowest liquidity
grades declined to 29 in December, or 5.1 percent of rated
companies, from 8.6 percent a year earlier. The issuers, which
rely on external sources of financing with “highly uncertain”
availability, oversee about $64.9 billion of debt, Moody’s said
in a report this month.  LBOs “in general are obviously very dependent on
refinancing,” Moody’s analyst John Puchalla said. “The terms
of refinancing have gotten cheaper from a company perspective.”  The 12-month trailing speculative-grade default rate in the
U.S. declined for the 13th month in a row to 3.27 percent in
December from 11.1 percent at the end of 2009, S&P said in a
Jan. 25 report. The ratings company predicts that will fall to
2.4 percent in September.  Bond investors are also speculating that leveraged buyouts
will benefit from a rebound in equity values, as the  S&amp;P 500
Index  surges 92 percent from its 12-year low in March 2009. More
than half of the U.S. initial public offerings planned for this
year were from private-equity firms as of the start of this
month, Bloomberg data show.  Private Equity  Nielsen Holdings NV, the television company owned by
Blackstone, Carlyle, KKR and Thomas H. Lee Partners, raised $1.6
billion this week in the biggest private-equity backed U.S IPO
since 2006.  “You may see a stronger IPO market this year than you’ve
seen in the last couple of years,” Bank of America Merrill
Lynch’s Mikkelsen said. “That’s really a prerequisite for a lot
of these companies to improve their  capital structure , to issue
equity.”  The world’s largest buyout funds are planning a new round
of takeovers. KKR is seeking to raise $8 billion to $10 billion
for a new fund, while Blackstone’s co-founder  Stephen Schwarzman 
said in an interview with Bloomberg TV at the  World Economic
Forum  in Davos,  Switzerland , there is capital to fund leveraged
buyouts of as much as $10 billion as debt becomes more
available.  “We’re all absolutely shocked at how fast leverage snapped
back from where we were, say, two years ago,” said William Welnhofer, a managing director at Robert W. Baird & Co. in  Chicago . “I don’t think anyone who’s honest would have expected
such a move.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
