U.K. government ministers are
meeting with lenders and house-builders on Feb. 15 in a bid to
overcome a mortgage drought experienced by first-time
homebuyers, the London-based Times reported.  The meeting will be chaired by Housing Minister Grant Shapps, the newspaper said.  In the last three quarters of 2010, the proportion of
mortgages granted to first-time buyers with deposits of less
than 10 percent fell to two in 100, down from almost six out of
10 in 2005, the newspaper said, without indicating where it got
those figures.  The percentage of first-time buyers under 30 years of age
who were able to buy without help from relatives fell to 17
percent at the end of last year, from 63 percent five years ago,
the Times said, citing the  Council of Mortgage Lenders .  Richard Capie, the director of policy and practice at the
Chartered Institute of Housing, told the newspaper that the
deposits lenders now require have become “a mountain that more
and more potential homeowners simply can’t climb” without help
from their parents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
