Spanish  notes  led losses in European
sovereign debt markets after demand fell and borrowing costs
rose in the nation’s first auctions since announcing that public
debt will surge to a record this year.  The yield on  Spain ’s five-year securities climbed to the
highest in 12 weeks amid concern the boost from loans provided
under the  European Central Bank ’s longer-term refinancing
operations is waning. Italian, Portuguese and Greek bonds also
fell, underperforming benchmark German bunds. The ECB held its
main  refinancing rate  at 1 percent, and President  Mario Draghi 
said downside risks to the economic outlook prevail, including
the potential for renewed debt-market tension.  “There was a big pop in Spanish yields after the auction
results,” said Lyn Graham-Taylor, a fixed-income strategist at
Rabobank International in London. “There’s a concern that the
benefit to auctions and Spanish yields from the LTROs is
beginning to fade because of the consistently weak economic
picture. Some banks may be full up with what they want to buy.”  Spain’s five-year note yield climbed 26 basis points, or
0.26 percentage point, to 4.52 percent at 4:30 p.m.  London  time.
It reached 4.55 percent, the highest since Jan. 10. The 4.25
percent security due October 2016 fell 1.055, or 10.55 euros per
1,000-euro ($1,313) face amount, to 98.88.  Credit-default swaps insuring Spanish bonds jumped 18 basis
points to 460 basis points, the highest since Nov. 28. The euro
fell 0.8 percent to $1.3125.  Spanish Auction  Spain sold a total of 2.59 billion euros of bonds, compared
with a maximum target of 3.5 billion euros.  Yields on the five-year notes it sold rose to an average
4.32 percent from 3.38 percent in a sale on March 1. Investors
bid for 2.46 times the amount of debt allotted, compared with a
bid-to-cover ratio of 2.59 at the previous auction.  Volatility in Spanish government debt was the highest in
euro-area markets today, followed by  Italy , according to
measures of 10-year bonds, two- and 10-year yield spreads and
credit-default swaps.  Italy’s five-year note yield climbed 21 basis points to
4.55 percent. Greek bonds due in February 2023 fell, with the
yield jumping 66 basis points to 21.95 percent. Germany’s  10-
year bund  yield was little changed at 1.80 percent, after
earlier rising to as high as 1.87 percent.  ‘Extreme Difficulty’  Today’s Spanish sale was the first since Budget Minister
Cristobal Montoro presented the government’s 2012 spending plan
on March 30 and said public debt will rise to 79.8 percent of
gross domestic product.  Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy  told a party meeting in
Malaga, Spain today that the nation’s economic situation is one
of “extreme difficulty,” with some public institutions locked
out of  capital markets , preventing them from refinancing their
debt. Spain can recover if it takes the right measures, Rajoy
said.  The nation’s  10-year yield  dropped in December and January,
reaching a 16-month low of 4.83 percent on March 1, as the ECB
offered unlimited three-year loans to the region’s financial
institutions.  “Now that LTRO-driven demand is gone, markets have been
looking for any signs of reduced appetite setting in for Spanish
and Italian debt,” said  Brian Barry , a strategist at Investec
Bank Plc in London. “There is a concern that this may be a
potential indicator of funding fatigue setting in.”  ‘Structural Reforms’  Markets are demanding euro-region governments deliver
structural reforms and fiscal consolidation, Draghi said at a
press conference in  Frankfurt .  “Fiscal consolidation will eventually stabilize financial
conditions,” he said. “That’s why we said all along that
structural reforms are essential to produce long-term
sustainable growth.”  The ECB’s decision to leave its key interest rate unchanged
today was in line with the forecast of all 57 economists in a
Bloomberg News survey. Talk of an “exit strategy” for the
bank’s stimulus measures is premature, Draghi said.  The 10-year Spanish rate rose the most since Jan. 20,
climbing 25 basis points to 5.7 percent after increasing as much
as 26 basis points to 5.71 percent. The extra yield investors
demand to hold the securities instead of bunds jumped to as high
as 393 basis points, the widest since Dec. 12.  Draghi’s comments signal “his concerns that we may see a
resurgence of weakness in peripheral markets, a concern shared
with many in the market and heightened given recent performance
of Spanish debt,” Investec Bank’s Barry said. Only when
“sustained confidence returns to these funding markets are we
likely to see the desire for safe-haven assets recede, and bund
yields rise,” he said.  German Auction  Germany  sold 3.37 billion euros of notes due February 2017
at an average yield of 0.80 percent. Investors bid for 1.8 times
the amount of securities allotted. A previous auction of the
same securities held March 7 also garnered a bid-to-cover of 1.8
times and an average yield of 0.79 percent.  The nation’s five-year rate fell two basis points to 0.79
percent, with the two-year yield slipping one basis point to
0.19 percent.  The German two-year yield is consolidating below its 100-
day moving average at 0.242 percent, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. It may find support at the March 13 rate of 0.19
percent, with resistance at the February high of 0.289 percent.  A resistance level is an area on a chart where analysts
anticipate orders to sell a currency to be grouped and a support
level is an area where they anticipate buy orders to be
clustered.  Portuguese 10-year bonds fell for a fifth day, pushing the
yield 22 basis points higher to 12.06 percent.  Portugal ’s government debt agency sold 1 billion euros of
18-month bills due in October 2013 at a yield of 4.54 percent.
Investors bid for 2.6 times the amount of debt allotted.  German bunds have returned 0.2 percent in 2012, according
to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European Federation of
Financial Analysts Societies. Spanish debt gained 0.5 percent,
while Portuguese bonds rose 12 percent, the best performance of
the 26 sovereign markets tracked by the gauges.  To contact the reporter on this story:
