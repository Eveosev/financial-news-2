German 10-year bonds fell for a
third day after minutes of the  Federal Reserve ’s latest meeting
showed policy makers are backing away from additional debt
purchases, sapping demand for  government bonds .  Germany ’s  five-year  yields climbed to the highest level in
a week before it sells 4 billion euros ($5.28 billion) of the
securities. Spain plans to auction as much as 3.5 billion euros
of bonds due between January 2015 and October 2020, while
Portugal sells 192- and 556-day bills. The  European Central Bank 
will leave its main  refinancing rate  at a record low 1 percent
today, according to all 57 economists in a Bloomberg survey.  “The Fed minutes weighed on market expectations of
additional stimulus,” said  Richard McGuire , a senior fixed-
income strategist at Rabobank International in  London .
“Treasuries sold off sharply in the wake of the minutes, and
that prompted an initial bearish reaction in bunds.”  The 10-year bund yield rose two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 1.82 percent at 9:18 a.m. London time. It
reached 1.87 percent earlier, the most since March 28. The 2
percent bond due January 2022 fell 0.190, or 1.90 euros per
1,000-euro face amount, to 101.54.  The five-year note yield climbed two basis points to 0.82
percent after reaching 0.86 percent, matching the highest since
March 28.  Treasuries Decline  Treasuries fell yesterday after minutes from the Fed’s
March 13 meeting dashed speculation policy makers would hint at
more asset purchases, or quantitative easing.  Spain ’s five-year note yield climbed to the  highest  level
since Jan. 11 before today’s debt sales. The rate gained 10
basis points to 4.36 percent, after reaching 4.39 percent.  The nation’s  10-year yield  dropped in December and January,
reaching a 16-month low of 4.83 percent on March 1, as the ECB
offered unlimited three-year loans to the region’s financial
institutions through its so-called longer-term refinancing
operations. The 10-year rate rose nine basis points today to
5.54 percent.  Spain’s debt will reach 79.8 percent of gross domestic
product this year, up from 68.5 percent last year, the
government said yesterday in its 2012 budget plan.  “The auctions will be a key near-term indicator in terms
of risk sentiment within  Europe ,” McGuire said. “The overall
size is relatively small in total. It remains an important
indicator in gauging the relative ongoing strength of the LTRO-
related bid.”  Portuguese two-year notes held a four-day decline, leaving
the yield little changed at 9.99 percent.  German bunds have returned 0.2 percent in 2012, according
to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European Federation of
Financial Analysts Societies. Spanish debt gained 0.5 percent,
while Portuguese bonds rose 12 percent, the best performance of
the 26 sovereign markets tracked by the gauges.  To contact the reporters on this story:
