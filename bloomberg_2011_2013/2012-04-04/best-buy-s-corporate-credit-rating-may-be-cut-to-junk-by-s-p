Best Buy Co.’s credit rating may be
downgraded to junk, or below investment grade, by  Standard &
Poor’s  as the world’s largest consumer-electronics retailer
closes stores to reduce costs.  “These actions underscore that its current business model
is not working and that the steps taken to date have not been
enough to improve performance,” S&P said in a statement.  The company’s BBB- corporate credit rating was put on
CreditWatch with negative implications by S&P.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
