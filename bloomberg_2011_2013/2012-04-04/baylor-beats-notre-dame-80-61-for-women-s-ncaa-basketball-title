Baylor University defeated the
University of  Notre Dame  80-61 in the women’s basketball
national championship game to complete a perfect record and
become the first team, men or women, with 40 wins in one season.  Junior Brittney Griner had 26 points and 13 rebounds for
the Lady Bears (40-0) in the  National Collegiate Athletic
Association  final at the Pepsi Center in Denver.  “It was great,” Griner said in a televised interview.
“Everybody was a part of this win.”  It was the second national championship for Baylor, which
also won in 2005.  Odyssey Sims added 19 points for the Lady Bears, who had a
34-28 halftime advantage. Kayla McBride made a jump shot to
start the second half and put Notre Dame within four, the
closest the Fighting Irish would come.  “I just thought we were composed,” Baylor coach Kim
Mulkey said about her team with Notre Dame threatening. “We’ve
had teams make a run at us before.”  Skylar Diggins had 20 points and McBride added 11 for the
Fighting Irish (35-4).  To contact the reporter on this story:
