Jose Antonio Ocampo, a former
Colombian finance minister and one of three candidates to become
the next World Bank president, said the lender needs a capital
increase.  “The institution is a very successful, indeed profitable,
global financial co-operative,” Ocampo wrote in an op-ed piece
published in the Financial Times. “But its recent response to
the global financial crisis, in the absence of a substantial
capital injection, has diminished its lending capacity.”  The bank needs a capital injection that is based on “a
clear, shared set of priorities,” he wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
