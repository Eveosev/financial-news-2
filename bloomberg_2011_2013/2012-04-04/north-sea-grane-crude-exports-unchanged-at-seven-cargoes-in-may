Exports of North Sea Grane crude for
May will be unchanged from this month at seven cargoes of
600,000 barrels each, according to a loading program obtained by

Grane field. Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude
shipments compiled by field operators to allow buyers and
sellers to plan their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
