Wheat dropped for the second time
this week as rain in the U.S.,  Russia  and Ukraine boosted crop
prospects and investor appetite waned after U.S. Federal Reserve
minutes showed it may hold off more monetary stimulus.  Winter-wheat areas in the southern U.S. Great Plains had as
much as 1.25 inches (3.2 centimeters) of rain since yesterday,
with another inch forecast in the next five days, Bethesda,
Maryland-based Commodity Weather Group said today in an e-mailed
report. Showers in Russia and Ukraine also will aid crops,
Telvent DTN said. The Fed will refrain from increasing monetary
accommodation unless the U.S. economic expansion falters or
prices rise at a rate slower than its 2 percent target,
according to minutes of its March 13 meeting.  “U.S. weather conditions are favorable for the wheat
crop,” Adam Davis, a commodity trader at Melbourne-based
Merricks Capital Services Pty., said in an e-mail today. “Risk-
off sentiment is also affecting all commodities.”  Wheat for May delivery fell 1.1 percent to $6.505 a bushel
on the  Chicago  Board of Trade by 1:47 p.m. London time. The
price was down 0.4 percent in the first two days this week. In
Paris, milling wheat for November delivery lost 1 percent to
203.75 euros ($267) a metric ton on NYSE Liffe.  The U.S. is the largest wheat exporter, followed by
Australia and Russia, according to U.S. Department of
Agriculture data released March 9.  May-delivery corn rose 0.3 percent to $6.605 a bushel,
after earlier climbing as much as 0.8 percent. The price gained
a fourth day, the longest winning streak in more than a month,
as supply from the last U.S. harvest declined and cold weather
threatened to slow planting in the top grower and exporter.  Inventories (UGRSCNTO)  of corn in the U.S. on March 1 dropped from a
year earlier to 6.01 billion bushels, the lowest for the date
since 2004, the USDA said March 30. Nonghyup Feed Inc.,  South
Korea ’s biggest buyer of feed grains, purchased 118,000 tons of
U.S. corn for arrival in September yesterday, according to Lee
Tae Woong, a deputy general manager. The company has a corn
tender today to buy as much as 140,000 tons, he said.  Soybeans for May delivery fell 0.4 percent to $14.1175 a
bushel in Chicago. Yesterday, the price touched $14.3425, the
highest for a most-active contract since Sept. 7.  To contact the reporters on this story:
