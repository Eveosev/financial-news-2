Commerzbank AG (CBK)  attracted more than
100 prospective buyers for a $740 million U.S. real-estate loan
portfolio held by its Eurohypo unit, Reuters reported, citing
people it didn’t identify.  Bids were due yesterday, and Blackstone Group LP’s debt
fund, J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and  Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC)  are among
the interested parties, Reuters wrote. The portfolio is said to
include a dozen individual properties as well as groups of
properties, including offices, retail space, land, warehouses
and apartments. Many are located in  New York  but properties in
Boston, Miami, Houston,  Chicago  and  San Francisco  are also
included, Reuters reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
