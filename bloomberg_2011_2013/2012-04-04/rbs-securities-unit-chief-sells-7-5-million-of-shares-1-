Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc ’s
investment banking head John Hourican sold about 4.75 million
pounds ($7.5 million) of shares, Britain’s biggest government-
controlled bank said.  The 17.6 million shares, which were awarded to Hourican in
2009 as part of his long-term incentive plan and a bonus, vested
this month, a spokeswoman said today. He disposed of them at
about 27 pence apiece, the Edinburgh-based bank said in a
statement.  RBS said in January it would cut about 3,500 jobs at the
investment-banking unit and exit its unprofitable cash equities,
mergers advisory and equity capital markets divisions. RBS paid
its investment bankers an average of about 112,000 pounds last
year, a drop of 26 percent from the previous year.  RBS was down 3.6 percent to 25.93 pence at 4:08 p.m. in
London trading. The shares have rallied about 23 percent this
year, valuing the company at 28.5 billion pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
