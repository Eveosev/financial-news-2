     April 4 (Bloomberg) --  Vestas Wind Systems A/S (VWS) , the world’s
largest turbine maker, slumped in Copenhagen trading after ING
Groep NV said the company sent a joint letter with  Gamesa
Corporacion Tecnologica SA (GAM)  informing clients of manufacturing
defects that need repair.  The shares dropped 3.8 percent to 52.85 kroner as of 12:22
p.m. local time, making it the worst performer on the Copenhagen
benchmark index today, together with cement plant maker FLSmidth
A/S. Vestas shares have plunged 15 percent this year versus a 17
percent increase in the main  OMXC20 index .  According to ING, some blade components on older V47 and
G47 turbines of 660 kilowatt capacity need repairs. The turbines
are more than 10 years old and most aren’t covered by
warranties, the ING note said.  Vestas’ V47 turbine was introduced in 1997 and is no longer
in production.  To contact the reporter on this story:
