Small and medium-sized German
companies often fall victim to Chinese economic espionage,  Die
Welt  reported, citing the German intelligence service.  While companies such as  Siemens AG (SIE) ,  Volkswagen AG (VOW)  and  BASF
SE (BAS)  employ security personnel who often used to work for secret
services, smaller companies underestimate the threat and are
careless about protecting their know-how, the newspaper said.  Economic damage in Germany from such espionage amounts to
as much as 30 billion euros ($40 billion) a year, Die Welt said,
citing estimates from the DIHK national industry and trade
chambers.  Violations of intellectual property rights in the European
Union have climbed from 6,000 cases to about 80,000 in 10 years,
the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
