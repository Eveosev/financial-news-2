Investor  Jim Rogers , chairman of
Rogers Holdings, said he’s “not so optimistic” about gold and
silver prices.  “I expect the price to decline and when that happens I
will buy more,” Rogers said at a conference in Bucharest today.  Silver dropped as much as 4.2 percent today and gold
declined 2 percent after the  Federal Reserve  signaled it may
refrain from more monetary stimulus. The dollar rose as much as
0.6 percent against a  basket  of six currencies, curbing demand
for precious metals as an alternative investment.  Today’s declines pared gold’s gain for this year to 3.4
percent and silver’s advance to 13 percent. Rogers predicted a
global commodities rally in 1999.  To contact the reporter on this story:
