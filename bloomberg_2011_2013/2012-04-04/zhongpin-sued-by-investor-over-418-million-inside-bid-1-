Zhongpin Inc. (HOGS) , the Chinese pork
processor whose chief executive officer offered to buy the
shares he doesn’t already own for about $418 million, was sued
by an investor who says he’ll be shortchanged in the deal.  Philip Meeks contends in a Delaware Chancery Court lawsuit
made public today in Wilmington that shareholders deserve more
than the $13.50 per-share offer from Xianfu Zhu.  The offer “represents wholly inadequate consideration in
light of the company’s intrinsic value and future prospects,”
lawyers for Meeks said in court papers.  The Changge, China-based company’s CEO, who holds more than
17 percent of the stock, last month offered to pay cash for the
remainder at a 39 percent average premium at the time.  Shares of the company fell 34 cents or 3 percent to $10.62
in Nasdaq stock market trading in New York at 10:10 a.m.  Zhongpin distributes food to 20 provinces and 3,400 retail
stores in  China , and exports products to other parts of  Asia  and
to  Europe , according to the complaint.  Warren (Feng) Wang, chief financial officer of Zhongpin,
didn’t immediately return an e-mailed message and didn’t answer
a phone call seeking comment on the lawsuit after business hours
in Beijing.  The case is Phillip Meeks v. Xianfu Zhu, CA7393, Delaware
Chancery Court (Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
