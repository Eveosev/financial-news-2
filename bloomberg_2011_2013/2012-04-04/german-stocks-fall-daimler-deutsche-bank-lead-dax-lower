German (DAX)  stocks retreated for a second
day as the U.S. Federal Reserve said it will refrain from
providing further stimulus unless the recovery in the world’s
largest economy falters.  Daimler AG (DAI)  and  Volkswagen AG (VOW)  declined more than 1 percent
after a report showed that sales of cars and light trucks in the
U.S. rose at a slower pace than analysts had estimated.  Deutsche
Bank AG (DBK)  slid 1.3 percent.  The DAX Index fell 77.42, or 1.1 percent, to 6,904.86 at
10:14 a.m. in  Frankfurt . The benchmark measure has still  rallied
17 percent this year  as the European Central Bank lent more than
1 trillion euros ($1.3 trillion) to the region’s financial
companies and U.S. economic data topped estimates. The broader
HDAX Index retreated 1.2 percent today.  “Based on the minutes yesterday, there is a question
mark,” said  Russ Koesterich , the San Francisco-based global
chief investment strategist for the iShares unit of BlackRock
Inc. “Are we going to get another round of asset purchases this
year? For 2012, the economy continues to recover.” BlackRock
oversees $3.51 trillion as the world’s largest asset manager. He
spoke in a Bloomberg Television interview with  Mark Barton .  The Fed will avoid increasing monetary accommodation unless
U.S. economic growth falters or prices rise at a rate slower
than its 2 percent-target, minutes released yesterday from the
central bank’s March 13 policy meeting showed.  “A couple of members indicated that the initiation of
additional stimulus could become necessary if the economy lost
momentum or if inflation seemed likely to remain below” 2
percent, according to the minutes.  ECB’s Benchmark Rate  The  European Central Bank  will leave its  benchmark interest
rate  unchanged at a record low of 1 percent, economists in a
 Bloomberg News survey  forecast. The ECB will announce its
decision at 1:45 p.m. in Frankfurt and President Mario Draghi
will speak at a press conference at 2:30 p.m.  In  Germany , an Economy Ministry report at noon in Berlin
will show that factory orders increased 1.5 percent in February,
according to the  median estimate of economists  in a Bloomberg
News survey. Manufacturing orders declined 2.7 percent in
January.  Daimler slid 1.7 percent to 45.01 euros. Volkswagen,
 Europe’s largest carmaker , lost 1.1 percent to 131.55 euros.  Deutsche Bank, Germany’s biggest lender, decreased 1.3
percent to 35.94 euros, while  Commerzbank AG (CBK)  retreated 2.3
percent to 1.80 euros.  Augusta Technologie AG (ABE1)  rallied 19 percent to 21.30 euros as
TKH Group NV offered to buy the outstanding shares for 21 euros
each.  To contact the reporter on this story:
