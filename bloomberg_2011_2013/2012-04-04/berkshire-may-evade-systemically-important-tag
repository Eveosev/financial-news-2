Warren Buffett’s  Berkshire Hathaway
Inc. (BRK/A) , owner of the biggest U.S.-based reinsurer, may be spared
designation as a systemically important financial institution,
said  Jay Gelb , an analyst at Barclays Plc.  Berkshire’s “superior capital position and liquidity
profile” may convince U.S. regulators they don’t need to apply
the heightened supervision that comes with SIFI classification,
Gelb said today in a research report.  “Berkshire should ultimately be deemed exempt from SIFI
oversight because it does not pose a threat to U.S. financial
stability,” said Gelb. His  rating  of Berkshire is the
equivalent of buy.  U.S. insurers and reinsurers, which are overseen by the
individual states, are bracing for tighter federal scrutiny as
policy makers and regulators seek to prevent a repeat of the
2008 financial crisis. The SIFI designation may be applied to
 MetLife Inc. (MET) , the biggest U.S. life insurer, No. 2  Prudential
Financial Inc. (PRU)  and  American International Group Inc. (AIG) , Gelb said.  “For MET and PRU, we anticipate a SIFI designation would
not have a meaningful impact on earning power,” Gelb said.
“But we are now less confident as to whether these companies
will be restrained on share buybacks.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
