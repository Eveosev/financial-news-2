Gold traders are bearish for the
first time this year after the  Federal Reserve  signaled it may
refrain from more monetary stimulus and jewelers in  India , the
world’s biggest bullion market, shut to protest a new tax.  Fifteen of 29 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg expect prices
to decline next week and five were neutral, the highest
proportion since Dec. 30. Imports by India may have plunged as
much as 81 percent in March and could drop 40 percent in the
second quarter, the Bombay Bullion Association said April 2.
Indian jewelers, who sell more gold than Australian and U.S.
mines produce in a year, were closed today for a 20th day.  Slumping Indian demand comes as prices already erased more
than half of this year’s gains on mounting concern the Fed won’t
buy more debt. Gold rose about 70 percent as the central bank
bought $2.3 trillion of debt in two rounds of quantitative
easing ending in June 2011. Policy makers indicated they won’t
increase monetary accommodation unless the economy falters,
according to minutes of their March 13 meeting released April 3.  “Reduced prospects for quantitative easing, if you read
that as a strengthening U.S. economy, then it’s bad for gold,”
said Carole Ferguson, an analyst at Fairfax IS in  London . “Gold
has lost some of its safe-haven shine this year. The Indian
jewelry market is still very important. If strikes are a longer-
term thing it’s more of a worry.”  Expanding Payrolls  Gold had risen as much as 14 percent to $1,792.70 an ounce
by Feb. 28 on the Comex in New York. It traded at $1,631.90 by
11:07 a.m. today, for an annual gain of 4.2 percent. That
compares with a 6.6 percent jump in the Standard & Poor’s GSCI
gauge of 24 raw materials and a 9.7 percent increase in the MSCI
All-Country World Index of equities. Treasuries lost 1.4
percent, a Bank of America Corp.  index (MXWD)  shows.  A Labor Department report tomorrow may show employment rose
by more than 200,000 workers for a fourth consecutive month,
according to a Bloomberg survey of economists. U.S. growth will
accelerate to 2.2 percent this quarter and 2.5 percent in the
following three months, compared with 2 percent in the first
quarter, according to the median of 73 economist estimates
compiled by Bloomberg.  While the Fed is sticking to a plan to hold the benchmark
 interest rate  near zero at least through late 2014, federal fund
futures on the Chicago Board of Trade show an 11 percent chance
it will raise borrowing costs by the end of this year. The odds
for an increase were 4.5 percent two months ago. Gold generally
earns holders returns only through price gains. The metal will
trade at $1,550 within a month,  Edel Tully , an analyst at UBS AG
in London, said in a report yesterday.  Gold Council  Indian consumers bought 567.4 metric tons of gold jewelry
last year, according to the London-based World Gold Council.
 Australia  and the U.S. are the world’s biggest gold producers
behind  China , producing a combined 515 tons, according to CRU, a
research company in London. Indian jewelers closed stores to
protest a 1 percent excise duty on non-branded gold ornaments.
The nation remained the biggest gold market on an annual basis
last year even as China overtook it in the fourth quarter.  Investors in  exchange-traded products  backed by gold remain
bullish, holding 2,398.2 tons valued at about $125.4 billion,
data compiled by Bloomberg show. That’s about 0.5 percent below
the record reached March 13.  Hedge funds  and other speculators
increased  bets  on higher prices in the week ended March 27,
raising their net-long position by 15 percent to 130,472 futures
and options, Commodity Futures Trading Commission data show.  Fewer Bonds  “Markets seem to be assuming all is OK now, but any re-
emergence of problems --  Iran ,  Europe , U.S. economic front --
would see gold higher again,” said Adrian Day, the president of
Adrian Day Asset Management in Annapolis,  Maryland .  Spain  sold fewer bonds than its maximum target in auctions
yesterday and its borrowing costs rose, adding to concern that
Europe is struggling to contain its debt crisis. Finance
ministers from the 17-member  euro zone  agreed to a package last
weekend that included 500 billion euros ($657 billion) of new
bailout funds on top of 300 billion euros already committed.  Investors bought 62,500 ounces of American Eagle gold coins
from the  U.S. Mint  last month, almost three times the amount
sold in February, data on its website show. The 210,500 ounces
purchased in the first quarter is still at least 22 percent less
than in the first three months of the previous two years.  Spot gold’s 100-day moving average dropped below the 200-
day measure for the first time in three years last week,
reinforcing a bearish trend, UBS said in a report yesterday. Its
14-day relative-strength index is at 39.3, with a level of 30
indicating to some analysts that a rebound may be due.  Supply Surplus  Nine of 11 people surveyed expect raw sugar to drop next
week, the most bearish the traders have been since July.
Czarnikow Group Ltd., which traded sugar in more than 90
countries last year, anticipates the first supply surplus in
four years. The commodity gained 1.9 percent this year to 23.74
cents a pound on ICE Futures U.S. in  New York .  India, the world’s second-largest sugar producer after
 Brazil , will remain a net exporter of the commodity for a third
year in 2012-2013 as supplies exceed domestic demand, the Indian
Sugar Mills Association said on April 3.  Fourteen of 33 traders and analysts surveyed by Bloomberg
expect copper to fall next week and eight were neutral. The
metal for delivery in three months, the London Metal Exchange’s
benchmark contract, rose 11 percent to $8,402 a ton this year.  Thirteen of 27 people surveyed anticipate lower corn prices
next week, while 13 of 28 said soybeans will gain. Corn rose 1.4
percent to $6.555 a bushel this year as soybeans climbed 18
percent to $14.2775 a bushel.  “If you take out quantitative easing, the liquidity that
was one factor driving prices higher is not there anymore,”
said Bayram Dincer, an analyst at LGT Capital Management in
Pfaeffikon,  Switzerland . “The market right now is more about
confidence, but it’s too early to say there’s a recovery for
sure.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
