CPC Corp. (CPC)  will permanently shut its
No. 3 naphtha cracker at Kaohsiung,  Taiwan , at the end of May,
at least two months later than originally planned.  The state-owned Taiwanese refiner delayed closing the
cracker, which is capable of making 230,000 metric tons a year
of ethylene, to ensure steady supplies while it completes work
on a new plant, Jessica Tang, a company spokeswoman, said
yesterday by phone.  Showa Denko KK (4004)  postponed the start of its ethylene plant in
Oita,  Japan , to the end of May from March 30, the Tokyo-based
company said in a statement on its website March 28. The company,
which shut production lines at the plant for maintenance last
month, decided to extend the shutdown after it discovered a
fault in cooling equipment on March 18.  Formosa Petrochemical Corp. (6505)  is planning to halt its No. 1
naphtha cracker in  Mailiao, Taiwan (FOMACRUD) , for 45 days of maintenance
from June 19, Tsao Mihn, the companyâ€™s president, said at a
press conference in Taipei yesterday.  The following is a table of planned maintenance shutdowns
in Asia, excluding plants in China and India:  To contact the reporter on this story:
