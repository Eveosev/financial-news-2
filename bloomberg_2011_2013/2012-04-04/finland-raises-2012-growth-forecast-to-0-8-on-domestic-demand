Finland raised its forecast for
growth as consumer consumption is expected to support the
northernmost euro member’s economy, easing pressure on the
government to cut spending to rein in deficits.  Gross domestic product will expand 0.8 percent this year,
twice as fast as previously forecast, and 1.5 percent in 2013,
the Helsinki-based  Finance Ministry  said in a report today. It
had predicted growth of 0.4 percent for this year on Dec. 20.  “The economic outlook is somewhat brighter than it was at
the end of 2011,” the ministry said. “Growth is sustained by
private consumption.”  Finnish consumers have kept the economy growing as exports,
which account for 40 percent of the economy, falter amid
Europe’s struggles to overcome the debt crisis. Flexible lay off
plans have slowed unemployment growth, allowing households to
keep spending. Retail sales rose an annual 5.5 percent in
February,  Statistics Finland  said on March 26.  The growth rate of the AAA rated economy isn’t enough to
push government finances into a surplus by 2014, the ministry
said. Prime Minister  Jyrki Katainen ’s cabinet targets a balanced
budget by 2015.  The  budget deficit  will widen to 1.1 percent this year,
before narrowing to 0.5 percent next year as the government
plans 2.7 billion euros ($3.6 billion) in spending cuts and tax
increases. The deficit will be 0.1 percent in 2014. Government
debt will grow to 51.9 percent of GDP over the next three years,
compared with the European Commission’s forecast of a euro-area
average of 90.9 percent next year.  The commission in February estimated the whole 17-member
euro area would contract 0.3 percent this year amid a sovereign
debt crisis that has led to bailouts of  Greece , Ireland and
 Portugal . Concern over the debt crisis has eased after the
 European Central Bank  in December started injecting more than $1
trillion into  Europe ’s banks to avert a deeper economic slump.
Euro-area finance ministers over the weekend also agreed to
boost a bailout fund for the region.  Easy ECB  Today’s forecast assumes “easy” monetary policy by the
ECB through 2014 and sees Finnish 10-year government bonds
yielding “just over” 3 percent by end 2014, the ministry said.  The 10-year benchmark bond yielded 2.208 percent today,
compared with a high of 2.985 percent on Nov. 25. The difference
with a similar-maturity German bond rose 0.3 basis points to
40.6 basis points. One basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
