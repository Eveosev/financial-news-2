Ghana ’s cedi weakened to the lowest
since at least 1993 against the dollar, as companies bought the
U.S. currency to settle first-quarter debts.  The currency of the world’s second-biggest cocoa producer
depreciated 0.1 percent to 1.7860 per dollar as of 2:52 p.m. in
Accra the capital, the lowest since Bloomberg began compiling
the data.  “Robust demand from the corporate sector is the main
reason, given settlement of first-quarter invoices,” Angus Downie, a fixed income and currency strategist at Ecobank
Transnational Inc., said in an answer to e-mailed questions
today.  “Corporate demand has been the driver,” Zintathu Nqweni,
a currency trader at Absa Bank Ltd. in Johannesburg, said in an
e-mailed comment today. The market is not liquid, she said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
