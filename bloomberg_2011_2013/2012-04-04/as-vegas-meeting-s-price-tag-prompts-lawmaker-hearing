House Republicans  said they will
hold a hearing on spending by the U.S. General Services
Administration after the agency’s chief resigned because of a
conference at a Las Vegas area resort that cost $823,000.  “This outrageously lavish training conference, which was
held on the taxpayer’s dime, is only the tip of the iceberg when
it comes to the spending habits of GSA,” Representative  John Mica , chairman of the House Transportation and Infrastructure
Committee, said today in an e-mailed statement. “This agency is
sitting on thousands of underutilized and vacant properties
across the country which cost Americans $1.7 billion to operate
every year.”  Martha Johnson, President  Barack Obama ’s appointee as
administrator of the agency that manages federal property and
acquisitions, quit on April 2 as the GSA’s inspector general was
about to release a report on its investigation of the October
2010 event for 299 employees at the  M Resort Spa Casino  in
Henderson, Nevada.  The taxpayer-funded conference provided $44 daily
breakfasts for employees, almost four times the government’s $12
allowance for the morning meal in  Las Vegas , according to the
report. The agency also spent $6,325 on commemorative coins and
$8,130 to print “yearbooks” for participants.  ‘Dollars Were Squandered’  “Reports of an internal conference in which taxpayer
dollars were squandered led me to launch internal reviews, take
disciplinary personnel action and institute tough new controls
to ensure this incident is not repeated,” Johnson wrote in her
resignation letter. “I feel I must step aside as administrator
so that the agency can move forward at this time with a fresh
leadership.”  The GSA holds regional conferences for its staff. The
acting administrator of Region 9, covering the western U.S.,
instructed planners to make the 2010 conference in  Nevada  “over
the top,” bigger and better than previous events, according to
the inspector general.  “GSA spending on conference planning was excessive,
wasteful and in some cases impermissible,” the watchdog office
found. “GSA failed to follow contracting regulations in many of
the procurements associated with the conference and wasted
taxpayers’ dollars.”  Obama’s Response  Obama was “outraged by the excessive spending,
questionable dealings with contractors and disregard for
taxpayer dollars,”  Jacob Lew , the White House chief of staff,
said April 2 in an e-mailed statement.  Johnson, an Obama appointee, fired two senior officials of
the agency and disciplined others before resigning, according to
Lew. Each federal agency “has established tough internal
controls” to prevent wasteful conference spending, Lew said.  Mica of  Florida  had criticized the GSA’s property
management policies previously, saying yesterday that the agency
“costs the taxpayers billions because it’s sitting on its
assets.” He today said his panel will hold a hearing on April
19 after the House returns from a two-week recess.  Republican Representative  Darrell Issa  of  California  zeroed
in on the $6,325 for commemorative coins, which saluted the
GSA’s work on the stimulus spending backed by Obama.  “After President Obama lectured the private sector about
not wasting funds on Las Vegas conventions, it’s hypocritical
that such a large agency with critical management
responsibilities across government would hold this luxurious
conference at the height of the recession and even spend
thousands on custom-made coins touting the stimulus,” Issa, the
chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee,
said in an e-mailed statement on April 2.  ‘Scouting’ Trips  The regional GSA officials spent $136,504 on eight pre-
conference events, including two Las Vegas “scouting” trips
and a “dry run,” the inspector general’s report said. An
additional $686,247 was spent on conference travel, catering and
vendors.  The $146,527 food bill for the conference included a
cocktail reception and the meeting’s closing dinner, which
together cost $30,207.60. GSA personnel munched on $4 shrimp and
$5 Boursin Scalloped Potato with Barolo Wine Braised Short Ribs.
No tax dollars were spent on alcohol, according to the report.  A GSA event planner asked the M Resort’s conference
services manager to help arrange the purchase of a $98 purse she
“cannot live without,” according to the report.  The M Resort manager responded, “I can give you a $30
comp,” and the discount was promptly accepted, the report
found.  To contact the reporter on this story:
