OTP Bank Nyrt. (OTP) , Hungary’s largest
lender, extended the longest losing streak in almost five months
on concern the U.S. Federal Reserve may refrain from more
monetary stimulus to boost the world’s largest economy.  The shares fell 0.9 percent to 3,716 forint by 9:22 a.m. in
Budapest, a fourth day of losses and most days of decline since
the five sessions through Nov. 7. The benchmark BUX stock  index 
dropped 0.5 percent to 18,251.69.  Emerging-market assets fell after Fed officials called for
additional stimulus only if the  U.S. economy  “lost momentum”
or if inflation stays below their 2 percent inflation target,
according to minutes of their March 13 meeting released
yesterday in Washington.  To contact the reporter on this story:
