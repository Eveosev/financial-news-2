OAO Gazprom (GAZP)  may boost natural-gas
production to 1,644 million cubic meters a day by next winter
after starting production at new fields and increasing storage
capacity, said Deputy Chief Executive Officer Vitaly Markelov.  “That’s almost 2 percent more than last winter’s peak
production,” Markelov said today on the company’s  website .  The output capacity of Gazprom, the world’s biggest gas
producer, has been stretched this year and it failed to meet
requests for increased volumes from some European nations during
a cold snap in February. The gas producer plans to start the
Bovanenkovo and Samburgskoye fields this year, helping to offset
declines at traditional western Siberian deposits.  Gazprom will also increase gas reserves in storage by 1.2
percent to more than 66 billion cubic meters by the winter, and
increase peak daily withdrawal rates by about 3 percent to 667.7
million cubic meters, Markelov said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
