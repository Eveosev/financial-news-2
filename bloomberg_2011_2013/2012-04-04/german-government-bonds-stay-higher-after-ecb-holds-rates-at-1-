German  government bonds  stayed
higher after the  European Central Bank  held  interest rates  at a
record low.  The yield on the 10-year bund was two basis points higher
at 1.79 percent at 12:48 p.m. London time. The two-year note
rate was one basis point higher at 0.19 percent.  ECB officials meeting in  Frankfurt  today kept the benchmark
rate at 1 percent, as predicted by all 57 economists in a
