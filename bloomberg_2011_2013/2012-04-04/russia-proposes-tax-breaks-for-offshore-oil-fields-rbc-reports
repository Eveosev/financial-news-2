Russiaâ€™s Energy Ministry proposed
tax breaks for offshore oil and natural-gas fields depending on
their complexity,  RBC Daily  reported, citing a copy of the plan.  The deposits would be ranked according to how difficult
they are to develop, with fields in the Laptev Sea and northern
part of the Kara Sea in the Arctic deemed the most complex, the
newspaper said, citing the document.  The ministry also proposed to cancel export duties on oil
and gas produced offshore starting May 1, RBC Daily said. The
plan was signed by Deputy Energy Minister Pavel Fedorov, a
former first vice president of state-run oil producer OAO
Rosneft, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
