The Super Bowl-champion New York
Giants received a preseason schedule that includes the New York
Jets and the  New England Patriots , who they defeated in last
season’s National Football League title game.  The Giants, who beat New England 21-17 in February’s Super
Bowl, will open the preseason with a road game against the
Jacksonville Jaguars, followed by home games at MetLife Stadium
against the Jets, Chicago Bears and Patriots, according to the
schedule released yesterday by the league. The Jets also play
the Cincinnati Bengals, Carolina Panthers and  Philadelphia
Eagles .  The games open with the Aug. 5 Hall of Fame Game in Canton,
Ohio, between the Arizona Cardinals and New Orleans Saints.
Saints head coach Sean Payton is appealing his one-year league
suspension for the team’s bounty program, which included
financial bonuses for injuring opposing players.  The  Washington Redskins  will host the Indianapolis Colts
during the preseason’s third week in what could be a matchup of
the NFL draft’s top two picks, projected by most analysts to be
quarterbacks  Andrew Luck  and Robert Griffin III.  Exact dates and times for most games will be announced at a
later date, according to the release.  -- Editors: Rob Gloster, Dex McLuskey  To contact the reporter on this story:
