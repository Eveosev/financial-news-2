JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) , the biggest
and most profitable U.S. bank, could reap as much as $24 billion
in annual profit without losses on home loans, Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer  Jamie Dimon  said.  “The main difference between what we are earning and what
we should be earning continues to be high costs and losses in
mortgage and mortgage-related issues,” Dimon, 56, said in a
letter to shareholders released today. While mortgage losses
have abated, they will “persist at elevated levels for a while
longer,” he said.  JPMorgan faces higher  litigation  costs from its lending and
mortgage-bond business, even after settling some bigger cases in
the past year. The New York-based company earned a record $19
billion last year.  The lender agreed in February to pay $5.3 billion as part
of a $25 billion industrywide settlement with state and federal
officials over abusive foreclosure practices. JPMorgan also
agreed in June to pay $56 million and to reduce  mortgage rates 
for deployed military personnel to settle claims that it
overcharged active-duty soldiers and seized the homes of those
protected by the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act.  To contact the reporter on this story:
