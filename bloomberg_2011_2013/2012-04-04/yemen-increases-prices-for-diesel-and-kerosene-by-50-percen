Yemenâ€™s government is increasing the
price of diesel and kerosene by 50 percent, the state-run Saba
news agency reported today.  Diesel and kerosene, which sold for 50 Yemeni rials (25
cents) a liter will now cost 100 rials, the agency said. The
government also cut the price of gasoline from 175 rials per
liter to 125 rials, Saba said. The new prices will be effective
starting at 3 p.m. local time today.  There has been a shortage of fuel in Yemen following an
explosion last year at an oil pipeline in Marib province,
leading many people to resort to purchases on the black market,
where diesel sells for about 150 rials per liter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
