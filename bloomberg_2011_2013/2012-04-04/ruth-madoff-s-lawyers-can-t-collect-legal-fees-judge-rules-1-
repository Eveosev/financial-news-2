Lawyers who represented  Ruth Madoff 
in a partnership dispute in  New Jersey  federal court can’t
collect legal fees, a federal judge in New York ruled.  The firm  Epstein, Becker & Green PC (1366L)  in New Jersey filed a
third-party suit in federal court in New York, saying that it
was entitled to legal fees totaling $24,790 from Madoff’s
forfeited settlement funds.  Attorney Robert S. Gettinger sued Madoff in federal court
in Newark in 2007 alleging that he and Madoff entered into a
limited partnership that in 1993 with Magnetic Services Inc. to
buy a magnetic resonance imaging machine, lease offices in
Hoboken, New Jersey, and provide space for physicians. Dr. Mark
Berger, who ran Magnetic Services, is also a defendant.  Madoff and Gettinger, who each invested $150,000, said they
were entitled to 25 percent of the partnership’s profits. Madoff
and Gettinger filed a breach-of-contract complaint last year,
claiming Berger and the partnership didn’t pay them all they
were owed to end the arrangement in 2005. That lawsuit was
settled in May 2009.  After Madoff’s husband,  Bernard Madoff , 73, pleaded guilty
in 2009 to orchestrating what prosecutors called the biggest
 Ponzi scheme  in history, Denny Chin, the federal appeals court
judge who is still presiding over the Madoff case, issued a
criminal forfeiture judgment of $170.8 billion in June 2009 just
before he sentenced Madoff to serve 150 years in a federal
prison in North Carolina. Ruth Madoff also agreed to be bound by
the terms of the forfeiture order.  Chin said that Epstein Becker, which submitted the petition
last year, wasn’t entitled to the funds because “it cannot
assert a legal interest in the forfeited property.”  Daniel Levy, a lawyer representing the firm, didn’t return
a voice-mail message left at his office seeking comment about
the judge’s ruling.  The case is U.S. v. Bernard L. Madoff, 09-CR-213, Southern
District of  New York  ( Manhattan ).  To contact the reporter on this story:
