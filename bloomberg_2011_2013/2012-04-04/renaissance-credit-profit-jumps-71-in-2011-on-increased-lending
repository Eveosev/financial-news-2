Renaissance Credit, the Russian
consumer bank partly owned by billionaire  Mikhail Prokhorov ,
said full-year profit jumped 71 percent as lending soared and
bad loans declined.  Net income in 2011 rose to about 2.69 billion rubles ($92
million) from about 1.57 billion rubles a year earlier, the
Moscow-based lender said today in an e-mailed statement. New
loans to individuals grew more than threefold to 45.2 billion
rubles, while bad debts dropped to 5 percent of the total loan
book from 6 percent.  The bank increased lending after returning to profit in
2010 following a loss in 2009 when it was forced to stop
providing loans due the credit crisis and  Russia ’s first
economic contraction in a decade.  “We will be very conservative with our lending this year
and anticipate only 35 percent growth,” Chief Executive Officer
Alexey Levchenko said in a telephone interview yesterday. “We
could grow at a faster rate but it’s about the risk environment
and not losing control.”  Prokhorov’s Onexim Group last month acquired a 32 percent
stake in  Renaissance Capital , the consumer-banking unit of
Renaissance Group, for an undisclosed amount, Levchenko said.
Onexim also bought half of Renaissance Group’s investment bank,
Renaissance Capital, in 2008 for $500 million.  Renaissance Credit’s main competition will come from state-
owned banks expanding into consumer finance after some foreign
banks cut back their Russian operations, Levchenko said.
Britain’s Barclays Plc, Spain’s  Banco Santander SA (SAN) , Morgan
Stanley of the U.S. and Sweden’s  Swedbank AB (SWEDA) , are among foreign
competitors that have either quit or curtailed Russian consumer
operations since 2010.  To contact the reporters on this story:
