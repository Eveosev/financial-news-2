Qatar National Bank SAQ (QNBK) , the Persian
Gulf country’s largest lender, posted a 17 percent gain in
first-quarter profit, meeting analysts’ estimates, on increased
lending and foreign-exchange gains.  Net income  was 2 billion riyals ($549 million), or 2.9
riyals a share, compared with 1.71 billion riyals, or 2.8 riyals
a year ago, the Doha-based, state-controlled lender said in an
e-mailed statement today. The average estimate of four analysts
was for a profit of 2 billion riyals, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. Net foreign-exchange gains rose 71 percent to
163.3 million riyals.  The bank also said it had a new five-year plan to make
itself an “icon” in the  Middle East  and  Africa  by expansion
and “diversifying income sources,” without giving more
details. Like other Qatari lenders, QNB has benefited from loan
growth at home as the emirate boosts spending on infrastructure
including roads, an airport and petrochemical plants.  Net interest income and Islamic financing income rose 32
percent to 2.2 billion riyals, while fee and commission income
climbed 18 percent to 337.2 million riyals, the bank said. Loans
increased 43 percent from a year ago to 201.2 billion riyals,
and customer deposits grew 21 percent to 218.4 billion riyals.
Bad loans accounted for 1.1 percent of gross loans.  The lender, which is bidding to buy Dexia SA’s Turkish
unit, raised $1 billion from the sale of five-year bonds in
February, paying a coupon of 3.375 percent.  Shares of Qatar National Bank fell 0.7 percent to 135.9
riyals in Doha trading today before the results were announced
after markets closed. The shares are down 1.7 percent this year.  Qatar’s central bank says the nation’s total credit
facilities, including loans, rose an annual 31 percent in
February while deposits rose 5.5 percent. The country plans to
spend as much as $88 billion to prepare for hosting soccer’s
 World Cup  in 2022, according to Qatar National Bank.  To contact the reporter on this story:
