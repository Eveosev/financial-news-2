Treasuries rose, rebounding from
yesterday’s biggest slide in almost three weeks, as weaker-than-
expected European bond auctions added to concern the region’s
sovereign-debt crisis wasn’t resolved, spurring haven demand.  Ten-year yields dropped from the highest level in almost
two weeks as investors speculated yesterday’s rise in reaction
to minutes of the  Federal Reserve ’s March 13 meeting that
reduced expectations for quantitative easing, or additional
asset purchases, won’t be sustained without stronger-than-
forecast economic data. The Fed bought $6.62 billion of
Treasuries maturing from April 2018 to February 2042 in two
operations today.  “The problems in  Europe  aren’t over,” said  Sean Murphy , a
trader at  Societe Generale  in New York, one of the 21 primary
dealers that trade with the Fed. “We’re getting a re-think of
the reaction to the FOMC minutes. It’s not as hawkish as was
feared. The reality is that it’s more data dependent from
here.”  The 10-year  yield  fell eight basis points, or 0.08
percentage point, to 2.22 percent at 4:59 p.m.  New York  time,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The 2 percent note
due February 2022 rose 21/32, or $6.56 per $1,000 face amount,
to 98 1/32. The yield jumped 12 basis points yesterday, the most
since March 14.  The  Stoxx Europe 600 index  dropped 2 percent and the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index declined 1 percent.  Spanish Bonds  The yield on Spanish 10-year bonds rose as much as 26 basis
points, to 5.71 percent, after it sold 2.59 billion euros ($3.41
billion) of bonds, compared with a maximum target of 3.5 billion
euros. The yield on Italian 10-year securities gained as much as
25 basis points to 5.40 percent.  “It shows the fragile state of what’s going on in
Europe,” said  Brian Edmonds , head of interest rates at the
primary dealer Cantor Fitzgerald LP in New York.  Treasuries remained higher as investors speculated the Fed
may still follow through with more purchases.  QE3 might still be on the table if data shows signs of a
significant near-term slowdown, although Operation Twist 2 is
probably a more viable option,  Vincent Reinhart , chief U.S.
economist at primary dealer Morgan Stanley, wrote in a note to
clients. Operation Twist is a Fed program that replaces shorter-
term debt with longer-term securities.  The odds of QE3 over the next few months are 33 percent,
down from as high as 75 percent, as Fed minutes released
yesterday indicate sentiment for more accommodation has faded,
Reinhart wrote.  Lacker’s View  Fed Bank of Richmond President  Jeffrey Lacker  said
financial markets had assigned too high a probability that the
Fed would begin a new round of asset purchases.  “While further easing is obviously something that’s
conceivable, I wouldn’t favor it unless conditions deteriorated
quite substantially,” Lacker, a voting member of the  Federal
Open Market Committee , told reporters and editors today at the
Bloomberg News Washington bureau.  The strengthening U.S. economy is reducing the odds that
the central bank will need to add to its monetary accommodation,
Fed Bank of  San Francisco  President  John Williams  said today
after delivering a speech in San Francisco.  Volatility rose today to the highest in a week, a day after
Fed minutes dashed speculation policy makers would hint at more
asset purchases. Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s  MOVE index ,
which measures Treasury price swings based on options, rose to
84.6 basis points. It touched 69.9 basis points on March 12, the
least since July 2007. It rose to 93.3 basis points on March 20,
the highest this year.  Not ‘Big Buyers’  “We weren’t big buyers of the notion that there would be
another round of QE,” said  Chris Ahrens , head interest-rate
strategist in  Stamford ,  Connecticut , at primary dealer UBS AG.
“The odds of something like that happening were more on the
order of 25 percent, 30 percent.”  The  volume  of Treasury trades handled through ICAP Plc, the
biggest broker between banks, dropped to $324 billion from
yesterday’s $360 billion, the most since March 15. It rose to a
2012 high of $439 billion on March 14 and touched a 2012 low of
$141 billion on Jan. 9.  Figures from ADP Employer Services showed U.S. employment
increased by 209,000 last month, compared with a forecast of a
gain of 206,000 in a Bloomberg News survey. A gain of 216,000 in
February was the biggest in two months.  Payrolls Report  U.S. payrolls climbed by more than 200,000 in March for a
fourth month, economists said before the Labor Department report
on April 6.  Ten-year yields will be 2.25 percent by June 30, according
to the average forecast in a Bloomberg survey of financial
companies with the most recent projections given the heaviest
weightings.  Valuation measures show government debt has become more
expensive. The term premium, a model created by economists at
the Fed, reached negative 0.44 percent today after closing at
negative 0.36 percent yesterday, the least expensive since March
22. It reached negative 0.26 percent on March 19, the least
expensive since October. A negative reading indicates investors
are willing to accept yields below what’s considered fair value.  Bill Gross , co-chief investment officer and founder of
 Newport Beach , California-based Pacific Investment Management
Co., weighed in on monetary policy in a Twitter post today.  Gross Tweets  “Central banks are where bad bonds go to die,” he wrote.
“Without QE, the financial markets and then the economy will
falter.”  The Fed will probably shift focus to mortgage securities to
keep borrowing rates low when Operation Twist ends in June,
Gross said March 28 during an interview on Bloomberg
Television’s “InBusiness with  Margaret Brennan .”  Gross lowered the proportion of U.S. government securities
in the fund to 37 percent of assets in February from 38 percent
in January, according to a report on the company’s website. He
raised mortgages to 52 percent from 50 percent.  The Fed bought $2.3 trillion of securities to lower
borrowing costs and spur the economy in two rounds of
quantitative easing from December 2008 to June 2011. It has kept
its target rate for the so-called federal funds rate that banks
charge each other on overnight loans, to a range of zero to 0.25
percent since December 2008.  The European Central Bank today left  interest rates 
unchanged at a record low of 1 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
