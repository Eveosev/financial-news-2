Indonesia’s rupiah fell, snapping a
two-day rally, after the  Federal Reserve  damped speculation for
additional monetary stimulus that would boost the supply of
dollars.  Minutes released yesterday of the Fed’s March policy
meeting indicated it will refrain from stepping up asset
purchases unless economic expansion falters or prices rise at a
rate slower than its 2 percent target. Global funds  reduced 
their holdings of Indonesian bonds by 2.26 trillion rupiah ($247
million) in March to 224.7 trillion rupiah, official data show.  “The Fed minutes yesterday gave the market a negative
sentiment because without stimulus, there will be less dollar
liquidity,” said Artanavaro Gasali, the Jakarta-based head of
global markets at PT Bank ICBC Indonesia.  The rupiah dropped 0.1 percent to 9,140 per dollar as of
4:05 p.m. in Jakarta, according to prices from local banks
compiled by Bloomberg. It declined as much as 0.6 percent
earlier, the most since March 12.  The currency’s one-month implied volatility, which measures
exchange-rate swings used to price options, rose 25 basis
points, or 0.25 percentage point, to 6.75 percent. The measure
reached 6.5 percent yesterday, the lowest level since Sept. 9.  Indonesia  sold 9 trillion rupiah of debt at an auction
yesterday, exceeding its target of 6 trillion rupiah, as
investors bid for more than twice the amount offered. The
strength of demand suggests the rupiah and the nation’s bonds
will rebound, Societe Generale SA strategist Wee-Khoon Chong
wrote in a note to clients yesterday.  The yield on the government’s 7 percent bonds due May 2022
rose three basis points to 5.90 percent, according to closing
prices from the Inter-Dealer Market Association. It has fallen
four basis points this month after increasing 38 in March and 15
in February.  To contact the reporters on this story:
