Hungary needs to obtain an
 International Monetary Fund  loan before the central bank can
lower the highest benchmark  interest rate  in the European Union,
Dow Jones reported, citing policy maker Ferenc Gerhardt.  “Monetary-policy easing may only come after successful
conclusion of an agreement with the IMF/EU,” the news service
reported yesterday, citing an interview with Gerhardt.  “Any future cuts must be gradual,” Gerhardt said. “Rash
movements should be avoided; a one-off big cut may mean
overdoing it.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
