Hovnanian Enterprises Inc. (HOV) , the
largest homebuilder in  New Jersey , had its biggest decline in
New York trading since January after disclosing plans to sell 25
million shares to buy debt.  The company will use proceeds from the sale to buy some of
its senior unsecured notes in a private transaction, the  Red
Bank , New Jersey-based company said in a statement yesterday
after the close of regular U.S. trading. Hovnanian also may use
money from the offering for general corporate purposes,
including debt payment or refinancing.  Hovnanian, whose debt burden and lack of profitability have
helped send its shares down 36 percent over the past year,
reported a narrower first-quarter loss on March 7 as sales rose
and the company reduced writedowns. The builder had $1.64
billion of debt as of Jan. 31, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  “While this transaction represents a step in the right
direction, it is just that -- a step -- and does not alleviate
the liquidity constraints the company faces,” David Goldberg,
Susan Maklari and Michael Clerico, analysts at  UBS AG (UBS) , wrote in
a note to investors today.  Hovnanian fell 8.5 percent to $2.15 as of 4:15 p.m. in New
York, the most since Jan. 17, when it dropped 9.4 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
