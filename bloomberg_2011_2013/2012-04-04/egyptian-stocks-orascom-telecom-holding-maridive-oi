Egypt’s benchmark  EGX30 Index (EGX30)

Cairo, the lowest level in almost two months.  The following shares were active on the Egyptian Exchange.
Stock symbols follow company names.  Maridive & Oil Services SAE (MOIL)  , an offshore oil
support services provider, retreated as much as 1.6 percent to

electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange.  Orascom Telecom Holding SAE (ORTE)   lost the most in more

Negotiations between the Algerian government and  VimpelCom Ltd. (VIP) ,
which merged with Orascom last year, to buy Orascom’s local unit
Djezzy may take many months because of a “big disparity”
between the prices each side is seeking,  Al Bayan  newspaper
reported, citing Algerian Finance Minister Karim Djoudi.  To contact the reporter on this story:
