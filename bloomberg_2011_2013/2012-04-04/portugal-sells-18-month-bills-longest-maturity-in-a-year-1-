Portugal  sold 1 billion euros ($1.3
billion) of 18-month bills, the longest debt maturity auctioned
since the country requested a bailout from the European Union
and the  International Monetary Fund  last year.  The securities due in October 2013 were issued at an
average yield of 4.537 percent and attracted bids for 2.6 times
the amount offered, the country’s debt management agency said.
The bills are the longest maturity Portugal has sold since
March, 9, 2011, when the agency sold bonds due in September 2013
at an average yield of 5.993 percent.  The government approved on Feb. 9 a change to the maximum
maturity allowed for new issues of treasury bills, extending it
to as much as 18 months. The country’s aid plan was requested in
April 2011 and assumes Portugal will regain access to medium
and long-term sovereign-debt markets in 2013.  Portugal’s two-year note yield was little changed at 9.98
percent as of 11:28 a.m. in  London . Ten-year bond  yields  were at
11.88 percent.  Borrowing costs declined at a sale of six-month bills
today. The debt agency sold 500 million euros of bills due in
October 2012 at an average yield of 2.9 percent, attracting bids
for 5 times the amount offered. That compares with an average
yield of 4.332 percent and a bid-to-cover ratio of 2.5 at a Feb.
15 auction.  The IGCP, as the agency is known, said on March 29 that the
total indicative amount for today’s auctions was between 1.25
billion euros and 1.5 billion euros.  Portugal plans to sell as much as 4.5 billion euros of
bills in the second quarter. It sold 10 billion euros of bills
in the first quarter, more than the 6.5 billion euros planned.  The  European Central Bank  approved in February the
temporary use of additional collateral in funding operations by
seven euro-area members’ central banks including Portugal. It
offered loans of up to three years against eligible collateral
on Feb. 28 that can be used to finance purchases of assets
including higher-yielding government debt.  To contact the reporters on this story:
