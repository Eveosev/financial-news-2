Investors are underestimating the
effect on junk-rated debt of the European Central Bank’s
injection of more than $1.3 trillion into the region’s financial
companies, according to  Bank of America Corp. (BAC)   Speculative-grade bonds returned 12.7 percent in the first
quarter this year, the best start since at least 1998, Bank of
America Merrill Lynch index data show. Investors should increase
their holdings to as much as 30 percent more than recommended by
indexes they follow, strategists including Barnaby Martin wrote
in April 2 report.  “The ECB’s critical backstop should keep systemic risk at
bay, leaving the reach for yield as an important positive driver
for high-yield over the next few months,” the strategists
wrote. “The outlook for the European economy is challenging,
but the chances of a severe contraction look to have
diminished.”  Yields on the debt tumbled 3.6 percentage points this year
to 8.8 percent, Bank of America Merrill Lynch data show, as
central bank loans and  Greece ’s debt restructuring boosts
confidence in the riskiest debt. Junk, or speculative-grade,
bonds are ranked below Baa3 by Moody’s Investors Service and
BBB- at Standard & Poor’s and Fitch Ratings.  “The ECB’s operations have bought time for countries to
improve their fiscal accounts, addressed concerns over bank
funding, and importantly, have kept the Greek banking system
afloat amidst a sovereign debt restructuring,” the analysts
wrote in the note.  To contact the reporter on this story:
