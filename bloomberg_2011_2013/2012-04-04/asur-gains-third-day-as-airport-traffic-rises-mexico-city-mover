Grupo Aeroportuario del Sureste SAB
climbed for a third day after the operator of airports in
southern  Mexico  said passenger traffic is rising.  The  stock  added 0.4 percent to 92 pesos at 1:15 p.m. Mexico
City time, the highest level since the company listed shares on
the exchange in September 2000. Asur, as the Mexico City-based
company is known, climbed for a third day, boosting the stock by
4.5 percent, even as the country’s benchmark gauge slipped 1.1
percent.  March passenger traffic jumped 9.1 percent, while passenger
volumes in Cancun, Asur’s biggest airport, climbed 8.2 percent,
the company said today in a statement sent to the Mexican Stock
Exchange. Visits to its terminals rose 12.3 percent in February
and 10 percent in January.  “With all the growth that we’ve seen in the first three
months, it shows you that a good first-quarter report is
coming,”  Gerardo Copca , an analyst with Metanalisis SA, said in
a telephone interview from Mexico City.  Asur shares are up 17 this year, headed for the biggest
annual gain since 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
