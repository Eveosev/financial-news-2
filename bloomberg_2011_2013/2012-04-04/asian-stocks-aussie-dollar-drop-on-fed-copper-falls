European  stocks  and commodities fell
and the dollar strengthened after the  Federal Reserve  signaled
it may refrain from more monetary stimulus to boost the  U.S.
economy . Treasuries rebounded from the biggest slide in almost
three weeks and Asian shares tumbled the most this year.  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index lost 0.7 percent as of 9:50 a.m.
in London. Standard & Poor’s 500 Index futures slid 0.6 percent
and the  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  lost 1.5 percent. The dollar
advanced against 14 of its 16 major counterparts, while 10-year
Treasury yields fell four basis points to 2.26 percent. The S&P
GSCI Index of commodities retreated 0.5 percent.  The Fed will refrain from increasing monetary accommodation
unless economic expansion falters or prices rise at a rate
slower than its 2 percent target, according to minutes released
yesterday from its March 13 policy meeting. Data later today may
show U.S. employment increased by 206,000 last month, according
to economists surveyed by Bloomberg. The European Central Bank
will leave its main refinancing rate at a record low 1 percent
today, according to all 57 economists in a Bloomberg survey.  “The perception is that you’re taking away the safety net
of excess liquidity that lifted asset prices,” said  Tim Schroeders , who helps manage $1 billion at Pengana Capital Ltd.
in  Melbourne . “Given the exceptionally good run we’ve had year-
to-date, people are reassessing their risk-reward scenarios.”  Autos Retreat  More than 10 shares fell for each that advanced in the
Stoxx 600. Automakers led declines as U.S. sales of cars and
light trucks in March missed the average estimate in a Bloomberg
survey of analysts.  PSA Peugeot Citroen (UG)  slid 3.3 percent and
Volkswagen AG fell 1.5 percent. Petropavlovsk Plc, a producer of
gold in  Russia , sank 5 percent as the precious metal retreated
for a second day.  Spain’s five-year note yield climbed 11 basis points to
4.37 percent after the nation sold 2.59 billion euros ($3.41
billion) of bonds due between January 2015 and October 2020,
compared with a maximum target of 3.5 billion euros. The rate
earlier rose as high as 4.39 percent, the most since Jan. 11.  The decline in S&P 500 futures indicated the U.S. gauge
will drop for a second day. SanDisk Corp. slid 7.2 percent in
German trading after the biggest maker of flash-memory cards cut
its forecast for first-quarter sales and profitability, citing
weaker-than-expected pricing and demand for components that
store data in mobile phones.  Service Industries  U.S.  service industries  expanded at a slower pace in March,
a report at 10 a.m. in  New York  may show. The Institute for
Supply Management’s  non-manufacturing index  fell to 56.8 from
57.3 in February, according to the median estimate in a
Bloomberg News survey of 68 economists. Readings greater than 50
signal growth. ADP Employer Services data may show U.S. jobs
increased by 206,000 last month, down from 216,000 in February.  U.S. equities fell yesterday as the Fed minutes showed less
urgency to add stimulus. The Fed last month affirmed its plan,
first announced in January, to hold  interest rates  near zero
through late 2014 as the economy may fail to grow fast enough to
continue bringing down the unemployment rate.  The dollar rose 0.3 percent to $1.3189 against the euro. It
earlier reached $1.3176, the strongest since March 22.  “There’s no justification for the Fed to ease monetary
policy further,” Vasu Menon, vice president for wealth
management at Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp., said in a Bloomberg
Television interview from  Singapore . “The market has run up at
a very heavy pace, so I think a breather or a correction would
be a welcome change for now.”  Brent Crude  Brent crude for May fell 0.3 percent to $124.55 a barrel on
 London ’s ICE Futures Europe exchange on forecasts for an
increase in U.S. crude inventories in a government report later
today. European Union carbon permits for December 2012 delivery
traded at 6.48 euros a metric ton on ICE after falling yesterday
to 6.05 euros, a record low for that contract. Copper dropped
1.1 percent to $8,524 a ton and nickel slumped 2.4 percent.  China  accelerated the opening of its capital markets by
more than doubling the amount foreigners can invest in stocks,
bonds and bank deposits. The China Securities Regulatory
Commission increased quotas for qualified investors to $80
billion from $30 billion, according to a statement yesterday.

billion yuan ($7.95 billion) of local currency into the country,
up from 20 billion yuan.  Emerging Markets  Markets in China and Taiwan were shut for holidays. The

Shares Index (JALSH)  slid 0.9 percent in Johannesburg and Turkey’s  ISE

the nation had an unexpected trade deficit. The so-called Aussie

since Jan. 16. Australia posted a trade deficit for a second
month in February, completing the first consecutive shortfalls
in two years.  To contact the reporters on this story:
