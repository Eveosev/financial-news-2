South Stream Transport AG, an OAO
Gazprom-led venture planning to build a natural-gas pipeline
under the  Black Sea , hired financial advisers for the project.  Gazprom and its partners in the venture,  Eni SpA (ENI) ,  EDF SA (EDF) 
and Wintershall Holding, appointed  Credit Agricole (ACA)  Corporate and
Investment Bank,  ING Bank N.V. (VYSB) , and Russia’s RPFB Project
Finance Ltd., South Stream said today in an e-mailed statement.  The partners plan to build a 10 billion-euro ($13.1
billion) offshore pipeline with a capacity of 63 billion cubic
meters a year from the Russian Black Sea Coast to Bulgaria,
where the route will continue onshore to central and southern
 Europe . The funding of the marine link will include equity and
debt from international lenders, including banks and export
credit agencies, South Stream said.  “The appointment of our advisors formally kicks off the
financing process,” Marcel Kramer, chief executive officer of
South Stream Transport, said in the statement. “We are very
keen to start the mobilization of the financial markets this
year, so that the financing can be closed in a timely manner.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
