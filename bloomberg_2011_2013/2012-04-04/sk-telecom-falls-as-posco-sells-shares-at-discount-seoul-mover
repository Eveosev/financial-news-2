SK Telecom Co. (017670) ,  South Korea ’s
largest mobile-phone operator, fell the most in more than three
months in Seoul trading after  Posco (005490)  sold shares in the carrier
at a discount.  SK Telecom declined 3.2 percent, the biggest drop since Dec.
28, to 138,000 won as of the 3 p.m. close. South Korea’s
benchmark Kospi index dropped 1.5 percent.  Posco, the world’s third-biggest steelmaker by output, sold
about 2.3 million shares in SK Telecom at about 4 percent less
than yesterday’s closing price, Chung Jae Woong, a Seoul-based
spokesman for Pohang-based Posco, said by phone today. Some
investors may be selling the stock on concern the carrier’s
earnings will worsen, said Choi Nam Kon, an analyst at Tong Yang
Securities Inc. in  Seoul .  “The fact that there’s a selloff right after the deal
shows investors’ forecasts on this company aren’t so
optimistic,” Choi said by phone from Seoul today. “Typically,
investors immediately sell shares they bought in a block deal if
they see an arbitrage opportunity.”  Seoul-based SK’s parent-based operating profit may drop
about 20 percent in the first quarter after the company offered
discounts on phone rates to lure smartphone subscribers and to
help the government stem inflation, Choi said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
