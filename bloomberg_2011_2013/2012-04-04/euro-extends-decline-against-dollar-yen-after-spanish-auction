The euro extended its decline
against the dollar and the yen after  Spain  sold fewer bonds than
its maximum target at an auction.  Europe â€™s shared currency weakened 0.4 percent to $1.3175 at
9:49 a.m. London time and depreciated 0.6 percent to 108.91 yen.  Spain sold 2.59 billion euros of bonds, the Bank of Spain
said, compared with a maximum target of 3.5 billion euros. The
minimum amount the Treasury planned to sell was 2.5 billion
euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
