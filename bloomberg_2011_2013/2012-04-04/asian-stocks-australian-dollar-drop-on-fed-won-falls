Stocks and commodities slid for a
second day as weaker demand at a Spanish debt auction and the
U.S. Federal Reserve’s reluctance to add more monetary stimulus
fueled concern the global economic recovery will slow. The euro
fell and Spanish, Italian and Portuguese bond yields surged.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index lost 1 percent as of 4 p.m.
in New York, its second-worst drop of the year, and the  Dow (INDU) 
Jones Industrial Average slid 124.8 points to 13,074.75. The
Stoxx Europe 600 Index tumbled 2.1 percent. The euro depreciated
against 12 of 16 major peers, while 10-year Treasury yields fell
seven basis points to 2.23 percent. Spanish 10-year yields
surged 24 basis points to 5.69 percent. Silver and gold plunged
more than 3 percent and oil extended losses after U.S. supplies
grew by the most since 2008.  The S&P 500 has tumbled 1.4 percent from an almost four-
year high of 1,419.04 on April 2 following a 12 percent rally in
the first three months of the year, the best first-quarter gain
in 14 years. The Fed will refrain from increasing monetary
accommodation unless the economic expansion falters or prices
rise at a rate slower than its 2 percent target, minutes of a
March 13 policy meeting released yesterday showed.  “I can’t remember a time where knowing where you are in
the trading cycle is as almost important as the news that’s
coming,” Wayne Wilbanks, chief investment officer at Wilbanks,
Smith & Thomas Asset Management LLC in Norfolk,  Virginia , which
oversees about $2 billion, said in a telephone interview. “When
you are at the top of a  trading range  between 1,100 and 1,400,
it will take very little bad news -- and maybe some news about
quantitative easing, which is not bad news -- for the market to
go down.”  Economic Data  U.S. stocks retreated even after an ADP Employer Services
report showed companies expanded payrolls by 209,000 following a
revised 230,000 gain in February. The median estimate in the
Bloomberg News survey called for a 206,000 increase. Economists
project a government report in two days will show private
employers added 215,000 jobs and total payrolls, including
government positions, increased by 205,000.  Service industries  in the U.S. expanded less than forecast
in March as orders grew at the slowest pace in three months. The
Institute for Supply Management’s non-manufacturing index
dropped to 56 from a one-year high of 57.3 in February. Readings
above 50 signal expansion, and economists surveyed by Bloomberg
News projected 56.8 for the gauge, according to the median
estimate.  SanDisk Tumbles  Losses in U.S. stocks today were led by financial,
technology and commodity companies, with gauges of each group
dropping at least 1.2 percent as nine of the 10 main industry
groups in the  S&P 500  retreated. Bank of America Corp., Alcoa
Inc. and Microsoft Corp. lost more than 2 percent for the
biggest declines in the Dow.  SanDisk Corp. slid 11 percent, the most since January,
after the biggest maker of flash-memory cards cut its forecast
for first-quarter sales and profitability, citing weaker-than-
expected pricing and demand for components that store data in
mobile phones.  General Electric Co. fell 1.1 percent after its debt rating
was cut by Moody’s Investors Service because of “heightened
risk” from its finance unit, whose own grade was cut below the
parent company’s for the first time in two decades.  U.S. equities retreated yesterday as the Fed minutes showed
less urgency to add stimulus. Policy makers last month affirmed
the plan, first announced in January, to hold interest rates
near zero through late 2014 on concern the economy may fail to
grow fast enough to continue bringing down unemployment.  ‘Welcome Change’  “There’s no justification for the Fed to ease monetary
policy further,” Vasu Menon, vice president for  wealth
management  at Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp., said in a Bloomberg
Television interview from  Singapore . “The market has run up at
a very heavy pace, so I think a breather or a correction would
be a welcome change for now.”  Almost 50 shares fell for each that advanced in the Stoxx
600. Automakers slumped after U.S. sales of cars and light
trucks in March missed the average estimate in a Bloomberg
survey of analysts.  PSA Peugeot Citroen (UG)  slid 5.8 percent and
Volkswagen AG fell 2.7 percent. Petropavlovsk Plc, a producer of
gold in  Russia , sank 6.5 percent as the precious metal retreated
for a second day.  Germany ’s DAX Index slumped 2.8 percent and Sweden’s OMX
Stockholm 30 Index tumbled 3.6 percent to lead losses among
major European national indexes. German factory orders increased
in February less than economists had forecast. Orders, adjusted
for seasonal swings and inflation, increased 0.3 percent from
January, the Economy Ministry in Berlin said. Economists had
predicted a gain of 1.5 percent, according to the median of 35
estimates in a Bloomberg News survey.  Euro Weakens  The euro weakened 0.7 percent to $1.3142, falling for a
third straight day and reaching the weakest level since March
16. Yields on Italian and Portuguese 10-year bonds surged 21
basis points each.  The cost of insuring sovereign debt rose, with the Markit
iTraxx SovX Western Europe Index of credit-default swaps linked
to 15 governments climbing 6.1 basis points to 271. Swaps on
 Spain  jumped 22 basis points to 461, the highest since November,
according to CMA.  Spain sold 2.59 billion euros ($3.41 billion) of bonds due
between January 2015 and October 2020, compared with a planned
maximum of 3.5 billion euros.  ECB Holds Rates Steady  European Central Bank officials meeting in Frankfurt today
kept the benchmark  interest rate  at a record low of 1 percent,
as predicted by all 57 economists in a Bloomberg News survey.
ECB President  Mario Draghi  said while a moderate economic
recovery is expected this year, the outlook is subject to
“downside risks” as the debt crisis damps momentum. Draghi
also said any talk of an exit strategy from stimulus measures is
premature for now.  Oil tumbled 2.4 percent to $101.47 a barrel, extending
losses after the U.S. Energy Department said stockpiles rose
9.01 barrels to 362.4 million. Gold plunged 3.5 percent to
$1,614.10 an ounce, the lowest since January, silver sank 6.7
percent and copper dropped 3.3 percent to $3.7905 a pound as 21
of 24 commodities tracked by the S&P GSCI Index retreated,
sending the gauge down 2 percent for its biggest drop of the
year.  Emerging Markets  Markets in  China  and Taiwan were shut for holidays. The
 MSCI Emerging Markets Index (MXEF)  fell 1.7 percent, halting a three-
day, 2.2 percent climb. The  Micex Index (MICEX)  fell 2.4 percent in
Moscow and the  FTSE/JSE Africa All Shares Index (JALSH)  slid 2.3 percent
in Johannesburg as oil and metals fell. Turkey’s  ISE National
100 Index (XU100)  retreated 1.3 percent. South Korea’s  Kospi Index (HSCEI)  slid
1.5 percent, the biggest loss since Dec. 19.  China accelerated the opening of its  capital markets  by
more than doubling the amount foreigners can invest in stocks,
bonds and  bank deposits . The China Securities Regulatory
Commission increased quotas for qualified investors to $80
billion from $30 billion, according to a statement yesterday.
Offshore investors will also be allowed to pump an extra 50
billion yuan ($7.95 billion) of local currency into the country,
up from 20 billion yuan.  Australia ’s dollar sank to an 11-week low as data showed
the nation had an unexpected trade deficit. The Aussie slid 0.7
percent to $1.0257 after Australia posted a trade deficit for a
second month in February, completing the first consecutive
shortfalls in two years.  To contact the reporters on this story:
