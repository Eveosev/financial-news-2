InvenSense Inc., (INVN)  which makes motion
tracking devices for consumer electronics, fell after  SanDisk
Corp. (SNDK)  cut its sales forecast.  InvenSense slipped 4.8 percent to $17.05 at the close in
 New York . The shares earlier fell as much as 10.2 percent, the
most since last week. They have gained 71 percent this year.  SanDisk, the biggest maker of flash memory cards, said
yesterday that it faced weaker than expected pricing and demand
for components that store data in mobile phones. InvenSense,
which started publicly trading in November, makes products for a
similar set of  customers , said Auguste Richard, an analyst with
Piper Jaffray in Sacramento, California.  “They’re in the same neighborhood, and people think it
must be bad,” said Richard, who has an overweight rating on the
stock, meaning investors should buy the shares.  InvenSense’s top competitor in making motion-sensing
devices is Geneva-based  STMicroelectronics NV. (STM)  That company
makes a wider range of products and is able to produce them more
cheaply, said Srinivasan Sundararajan, an analyst with
Oppenheimer & Co Inc. in New York.  InvenSense’s largest customers include Nintendo Co.,  HTC
Corp. (2498)  and Samsung Electronics Co. HTC and Samsung are competing
with Apple Inc. for market share and investors are still waiting
for Nintendo’s next-generation platform, he said.  “The customers have got problems of their own,” said
Sundararajan, who  downgraded  InvenSense to perform, the
equivalent of hold, from outperform last week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
