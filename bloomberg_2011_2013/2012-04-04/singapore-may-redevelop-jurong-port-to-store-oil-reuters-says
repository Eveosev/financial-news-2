Singapore is seeking bids to
redevelop bulk-cargo space at Jurong Port into a terminal for
storing oil and chemicals, Reuters reported.  The project involves building capacity to store as much as
4 million barrels of oil and chemicals at the port, Reuters said,
citing industry people it didnâ€™t identify. Liew Chin Beng, a
spokesman for Jurong Port, declined to comment on the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
