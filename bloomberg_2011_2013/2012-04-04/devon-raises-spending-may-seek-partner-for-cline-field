Devon Energy Corp. (DVN) , the third-
largest U.S. independent oil and natural-gas producer, raised
planned exploration and production spending 18 percent to as
much as $6.5 billion this year, including projects in which it
may sell a stake.  Devon budgeted $500 million for an undisclosed oil play and
$350 million for the Cline Shale in  Texas ’ Permian Basin, Chief
Executive Officer John Richels said today at an analyst meeting
in Houston. Another $220 million will be spent on other
undisclosed locations where Oklahoma City-based Devon is still
acquiring leases.  Stakes in the Cline Shale, where Devon’s 500,000 acres may
contain the equivalent of 3.6 million barrels of oil, and the
undisclosed areas may be  sold  next year for $1.35 billion to an
unidentified joint-venture partner, Richels said. Devon expects
to get $450 million in cash and $900 million in development
spending from the partner, Richels said.  The agreement will be about “half the size” of its
venture with  China Petroleum Corp. (386) , according to Vince White,
Devon’s senior vice president for  investor relations . That
company agreed in January to buy a one-third stake in five Devon
exploratory projects in the U.S. for $900 million in cash and as
much as $1.6 billion in development costs.  “We’re very excited about the Cline,” Andy Coolidge,
Devon’s vice president for the Permian Basin, said at the
meeting. “We expect to deliver highly economic and robust
production growth.”  No ‘Big’ Acquisitions  Devon will reinvest its cash in exploration and production
and won’t do “big, dilutive” acquisitions, Richels said.  The company’s spending plan of $6.1 billion to $6.5 billion
was boosted $1 billion from a February estimate for exploration
and production this year. Devon sees production at the
equivalent of more than 710,000 barrels a day by the end of the
year.  In the undisclosed oil play, Devon currently holds 250,000
acres and wants to double that to 500,000 acres, Richels said.  Devon  rose  0.2 percent to $71.28 at the close in  New York .
The shares have gained 15 percent this year.  Independent oil and gas producers have no refineries or
retail outlets.  Apache Corp. (APA)  produced the equivalent of 748,000
barrels of oil a day in 2011 followed by  Anadarko Petroleum
Corp. (APC)   To contact the reporter on this story:
