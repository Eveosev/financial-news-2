Deutsche Post AG (DPW)  is not planning to
carry out acquisitions through its DHL express-package and
freight business,  Handelsblatt  said, citing an interview with
Ken Allen, the management board member responsible for the
business.  “At the moment, I’d rather swallow razor blades than buy
any sizable rivals,” the newspaper cites Allen as saying.
Deutsche Post will focus on expanding its express business
organically, and the company last year outgrew rivals in terms
of volumes moved, Allen was cited as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
