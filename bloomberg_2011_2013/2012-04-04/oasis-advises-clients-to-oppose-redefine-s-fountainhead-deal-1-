Oasis Group Holdings, a Cape Town-
based  money manager , advised clients not to support  Redefine
Properties Ltd. (RDF) ’s plan to buy  Fountainhead Property Trust (FPT) ,
saying it will dilute the income from their investment.  On March 30, Redefine said it had reached an agreement with
Standard Bank Properties (Pty) Ltd. and Liberty Holdings Ltd. to
acquire Fountainhead’s management company for 660 million rand
($85 million). The Johannesburg-based property company said it
also intends to make an offer for all of Fountainhead’s assets
in exchange for Redefine and Hyprop Investment Ltd. shares.  “The price paid for control of the Fountainhead management
company was excessive and would undoubtedly be recovered from
its investors,” Oasis analyst Hassan Motala said in an e-mailed
statement today.  Redefine and Hyprop shares also had worse debt and yield
profiles than those of Fountainhead, while Redefine had a
relatively poor track record of growing its recurring cash flow
and distributions, he said.  “This proposed transaction by Redefine will be very
negative for Fountainhead unit holders,” Motala said. “We urge
Fountainhead unit holders not to support this proposed
transaction.”
