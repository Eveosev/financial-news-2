Contact Energy Ltd. (CEN) , New Zealand’s
biggest publicly traded power company, said it is waiting for
electricity demand to recover before committing to build a new
wind farm.  The company is in talks with landowners and potential
turbine suppliers, and also monitoring wind patterns at the
Hauauru ma Raki site near Raglan on the nation’s  North Island ,
spokeswoman Janet Carson said in a telephone interview from
Wellington. She denied a report yesterday by Rechargenews.com
that work had halted.  “Work absolutely has not stopped,” she said. “We are
continuing to progress it to get it ready for construction when
the economic environment is right.”  Contact got consent to build the 504-megawatt capacity
generator in May last year, and has yet to make an  investment
decision  to proceed with the 168-turbine project because
electricity demand is slowing. The project isn’t economic until
demand improves, Carson said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
