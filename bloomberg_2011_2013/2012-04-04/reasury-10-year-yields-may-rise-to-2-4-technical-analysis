Treasury 10-year  yields  may rise to
2.4 percent, the highest level since October, after staying
above the 200-day moving average, CIBC World Markets Inc. said,
citing trading patterns.  Treasury yields on March 14 advanced above the average for
the first time since July and on March 20 touched 2.40 percent,
the highest level since Oct. 28, after trading in a range from
1.8 percent to 2.1 percent for most of this year. Rates will
probably climb after they failed to decline to their previous
range, according to Kazuaki Oh’e, a debt salesman at the unit of
Canada’s fifth-largest lender.  “Yields are more likely to test 2.4 percent again, rather
than falling below” the 200-day moving average, he said.  Ten-year yields were little changed at 2.30 percent at 9:12
a.m. in  Tokyo , according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The 2
percent note due in February 2022 was at 97 11/32. The yield
climbed 12 basis points, or 0.12 percentage point, yesterday.
The average over the past decade is 3.86 percent.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
