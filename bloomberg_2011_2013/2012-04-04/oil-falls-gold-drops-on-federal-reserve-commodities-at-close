The Standard & Poor’s GSCI  gauge  of
24 commodities fell 0.7 percent to 692.79 at 5:23 p.m. Singapore
time. The UBS Bloomberg CMCI  index  of 26 raw materials declined
0.8 percent to 1,606.7983.  CRUDE OIL  Oil fell for a second day in New York on signs that U.S.
crude stockpiles rose and speculation the Federal Reserve may
refrain from more monetary stimulus to boost the U.S. economy.  Oil for May delivery declined as much as 49 cents to
$103.52 a barrel in electronic trading on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange . It was at $103.57 at 2:26 p.m. Singapore
time. The contract yesterday lost $1.22, or 1.2 percent, to
$104.01. Prices are 4.8 percent higher this year.  NATURAL GAS  Natural gas gained for a second day in  New York  on
forecasts for cold Midwest weather next week that may boost
heating-fuel demand.  OIL PRODUCTS  Japan naphtha swaps for May declined $1, or 0.1 percent, to
$1,053 a ton, at 10 a.m. Singapore time, according to data from
PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a broker. Naphtha swaps were at a
premium of $114.33 a ton to London-traded Brent crude futures
from $113.30 a ton yesterday.  Singapore gasoil’s premium to Dubai crude fell 21 cents, or
1.3 percent, to $15.70 a barrel, PVM data showed. The product’s
swaps for May were unchanged at $136.70 a barrel.  PRECIOUS METALS  Gold fell for a second day in  London , extending the biggest
drop in four weeks, as the dollar strengthened on signs the
Federal Reserve may refrain from providing more stimulus for the
 U.S. economy .  The Fed plans to hold off from more monetary accommodation
unless the economic expansion falters or price growth is below
its target, minutes of a March 13 policy meeting showed
yesterday. The dollar advanced against the euro for a third day
today. Bullion and the greenback tend to move inversely.  Bullion for immediate delivery dropped 0.6 percent to
$1,635.47 an ounce by 9:14 a.m. in London. Prices slid 1.9
percent yesterday, the most since March 6, and today reached the
lowest level in almost two weeks. Futures for June delivery fell
2.1 percent to $1,636.50 on the Comex in New York.  Platinum for immediate delivery dropped 0.6 percent to
$1,632.50 an ounce. Prices touched the highest level since March
20 yesterday, when Autodata Corp. figures showed U.S. sales of
cars and light trucks rose 13 percent in March.  BASE METALS  Copper declined as policy-meeting minutes from the  Federal
Reserve  damped expectations for further monetary stimulus and
increasing stockpiles signaled weaker demand. Nickel, zinc and
lead fell.  Three-month copper fell as much as 1.3 percent to $8,500 a
metric ton on the London Metal Exchange and traded at $8,517.25
at 3:18 p.m. in  Tokyo . The May-delivery contract lost 1.2
percent to $3.8715 a pound on the Comex. Markets in  China , the
world’s biggest user, are shut today for a holiday.  GRAINS, SOFT COMMODITIES  Wheat dropped as rains in parts of the U.S.,  Russia  and
Ukraine helped improve crop prospects and investor appetite
waned after the minutes of a meeting showed the U.S. Federal
Reserve may hold off more monetary stimulus.  Wheat for May delivery lost as much as 0.7 percent to
$6.5375 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade and was at
$6.5425 at 3:16 p.m. Singapore time.  Corn prices gained a fourth day, the longest winning streak
in more than a month, as supply from the last U.S. harvest
declined and cold weather threatened planting in the world’s
largest grower and exporter.  May-delivery corn rose as much as 0.8 percent to $6.6375 a
bushel, before trading at $6.6175. Soybeans for May-delivery
were little changed at $14.18 a bushel.  Palm oil  climbed to the highest level in more than a year
on speculation that buying from China, the biggest user of
cooking oils, may increase when local markets reopen tomorrow
after a three-day holiday.  June-delivery palm oil advanced as much as 1.2 percent to
3,574 ringgit ($1,167) a metric ton on the Malaysia Derivatives
Exchange, the highest price for the most-active contract since
March 9 last year, before trading at 3,545 ringgit at 4:34 p.m.  Rubber declined for a second day after the Federal Reserve
damped expectations for monetary stimulus, sending the dollar
higher and weakening investor demand for commodities as
alternative assets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
