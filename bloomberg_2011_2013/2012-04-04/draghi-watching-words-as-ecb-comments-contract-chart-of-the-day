European Central Bank President
 Mario Draghi  is controlling word inflation.  The CHART OF THE DAY shows that the opening statements
Draghi delivered after the central bank’s monthly policy-setting
meetings have averaged 1,422 words since he took office on Nov.
1. That includes a low of 1,128 words at yesterday’s briefing
and marks a decline from an average of 1,870 words his
predecessor,  Jean-Claude Trichet , used in his final six months
at the helm of the Frankfurt-based central bank.  Central banks around the globe are using language to signal
policy changes and steer market expectations. Draghi made the
longest introductory statement in December, exceeding Trichet’s
average by just five words, after the ECB lowered its benchmark
 interest rate  a second time in as many months to a record low
and introduced unprecedented liquidity measures to aid banks.  Draghi “has clearly got a different style of doing
things,” said  Howard Archer , chief European economist at IHS
Global Insight in  London . “When I went to the printer today
there were only two pages.”  In the U.S., Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke, who
began giving press conferences last year, used 1,971 words to
explain the central bank’s monetary policy thinking in January.
Six months into his new job, Draghi indicated yesterday that
he’s already under pressure to limit his remarks.  “I’ve been told I should give short answers,” he said
after responding to a reporter’s question.  To contact the reporters on this story:
