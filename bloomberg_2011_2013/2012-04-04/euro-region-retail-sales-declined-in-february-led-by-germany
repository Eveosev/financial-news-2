Euro-area  retail sales  declined in
February, led by  Germany , as rising oil prices and government
budget cuts prompted consumers to pare spending.  Sales fell 0.1 percent from January, when they rose a
revised 1.1 percent, the European Union’s statistics office in
Luxembourg said today. Economists had forecast a drop of 0.2
percent, the median of 22 estimates in a Bloomberg News survey
showed.  Sales (RSWAEMUY)  declined 2.1 percent from a year earlier.  In Germany, Europe’s largest economy, retail sales fell 1.1
percent from January, when they slipped 1.2 percent, today’s
report showed. Sales in  France  rose 1.2 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
