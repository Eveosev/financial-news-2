Erste Group Bank AG (RBAG)  dropped, leading
Czech shares to a two-month low as concern that the U.S. Federal
Reserve may refrain from more monetary stimulus hurt demand for
riskier assets.  The stock fell 3.6 percent to 408 koruna by 10:23 a.m. in
 Prague , poised for its lowest close since Jan. 25. The 14-member
 PX (PX)  equity gauge, where Erste has an 18 percent weighting, slid
0.9 percent to 956.50, headed for the lowest since Jan. 30.  To contact the reporter on this story:
