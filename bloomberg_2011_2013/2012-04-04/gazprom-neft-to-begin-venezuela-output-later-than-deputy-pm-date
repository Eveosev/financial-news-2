OAO Gazprom Neft (SIBN)  will begin output
at a joint venture with Petroleos de Venezuela SA in the South
American nation in August, three months later than a target set
by the Russian Deputy Prime Minister  Igor Sechin  last October.  “We have gained all permits and begun drilling,” said
Alexander Dyukov, chief executive officer of the oil arm of
 Russia ’s natural-gas export monopoly, on state-run Rossiya 24
television today. “In August we will produce first oil and in
the summer of 2013 reach 50,000 barrels a day.” By 2018
production should reach a daily 450,000 barrels, he said.  Sechin, the deputy prime minister in charge of energy, said
in October on a trip to  Venezuela  that Consorcio Ruso, the
Gazprom Neft-led Russian group in the Junin 6 venture, would
begin output in May and reach 50,000 barrels a day this year.  The group includes Russia’s top five oil producers; Gazprom
Neft, OAO Rosneft, OAO Lukoil, TNK-BP and OAO Surgutneftegas.  Venezuela, the largest oil producer in  South America , is
seeking to boost waning output and develop the tar-like fields
of the Orinoco, which boosted reserves to 296.5 billion barrels.  Before Sechin’s comments, Gazprom Neft’s project chief Yuri
Lyovin said on the company’s website in December 2010 that the
project would begin production in 2013 at 40,000 barrels a day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
