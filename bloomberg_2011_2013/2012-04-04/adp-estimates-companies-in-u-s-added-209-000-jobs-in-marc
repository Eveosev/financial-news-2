Companies in the U.S. expanded
payrolls in March, showing the labor market is strengthening,
according to data from a private report based on payrolls.  Employment increased by 209,000 for the month after a
revised 230,000 gain in February, figures from ADP Employer
Services showed today. The median estimate in the Bloomberg News
survey called for a 206,000 increase.  Faster job growth may lead to the wage gains needed to
sustain  consumer spending , which accounts for about 70 percent
of the world’s largest economy. Businesses added 215,000 jobs in
March, and the unemployment rate held at 8.3 percent, economists
project a Labor Department report will show in two days.  “Labor market conditions continue to improve at a moderate
pace,”  Joel Prakken , chairman of Macroeconomic Advisers LLC in
St. Louis, which produces the report with ADP, said in a
statement. “Employment grew in all major sectors of the economy
tracked.”  Estimates in the Bloomberg survey of 38 economists ranged
from increases of 170,000 to 250,000.  Stock-index futures held earlier losses after the report.
The contract on the Standard & Poor’s 500 contract maturing in
June dropped 0.8 percent to 1,397.1 at 8:47 a.m. in  New York ,
depressed by a drop in demand for Spanish bonds and after the
 Federal Reserve  signaled yesterday it may refrain from
additional monetary stimulus.  ADP Accuracy  Over the previous six reports, ADP’s initial figure was
closest to the Labor Department’s first estimate of private
payrolls in October, when it overstated the gain in jobs by
6,000. The estimate was least accurate in December, when it
overestimated the employment gain by 113,000. In January, ADP
underestimated the figure by 87,000.  Today’s ADP report showed an increase of 45,000 workers in
goods-producing industries, which includes manufacturers and
construction companies. Employment at factories rose by 23,000.  Service providers added 164,000 workers, ADP said.  Companies employing more than 499 workers expanded their
workforces by 22,000 jobs. Medium-sized businesses, with 50 to
499 employees, created 87,000 jobs and small companies increased
payrolls by 100,000, ADP said.  “We think improving performance in the U.S. should support
economic and labor-market growth,”  Carl Camden , president and
chief executive officer of the staffing firm  Kelly Services
Inc. (KELYA) , said March 12 during a conference in Scottsdale, Arizona.
“We believe the  U.S. economy  has now reached the level of
growth needed to support continuous  job creation .”  Payroll Forecast  Total payrolls, which include government workers, probably
rose by 201,000 in March, according to the median forecast of
economists surveyed by Bloomberg before the Labor Department’s
April 6 report.  “A wide range of indicators suggests that the job market
has been improving, which is a welcome development indeed,”
Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said last week. “Still,
conditions remain far from normal, as shown, for example, by the
high level of long-term unemployment and the fact that jobs and
hours worked remain well below pre-crisis peaks.”  The ADP report is based on data from about 340,000
businesses employing more than 21 million workers. Macroeconomic
Advisers LLC in  St. Louis  produces the data with ADP.  To contact the reporter on this story:
