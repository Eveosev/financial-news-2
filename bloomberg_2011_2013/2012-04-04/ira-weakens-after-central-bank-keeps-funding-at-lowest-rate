The lira depreciated to its lowest
level in more than two weeks after the central bank offered
funding at its lowest lending rate for a fourth day, reversing
monetary tightening last week that bolstered the currency.  The lira weakened 0.5 percent to 1.7916 per dollar at 5:02
p.m. in Istanbul, dropping for a second day to the lowest level
since March 20.  Yields (BENCH)  on two-year benchmark bonds climbed four
basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 9.38 percent.  “The central bank again eased and is funding the market,”
Burcin Metin, chief currency trader at ING Bank AS in Istanbul,
said. “People had expected that the bank may not provide
funding today.”  Central bank governor Erdem Basci stopped lending at 5.75
percent, the lowest end of his rates corridor, between March 22
and March 30 to help stem inflation and a decline in the lira.
The bank adjusts its lending rates between 5.75 percent and
11.50 percent under a dual rates regime introduced last year.
The bank plans to tighten monetary policy as a result of
increases in energy prices, according to Mehmet Yorukoglu and
other deputy governors of the bank at a meeting with economists
in Ankara yesterday.  Basci is offering less funding to banks at the benchmark
5.75 percent rate and more at rates as high as 11.5 percent in
regular auctions to help stem loan growth, inflation and the
current account deficit.  Inflation (TUCPIY)  was 10.4 percent in March,
near a three-year high, the statistics agency said yesterday.  Turkey  imports more than 98 percent of the energy it
consumes and the price of  Brent crude  was at $124.8 per barrel
today from about $108 at the end of last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
