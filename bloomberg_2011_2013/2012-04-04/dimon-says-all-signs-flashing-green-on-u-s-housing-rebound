Jamie Dimon, chairman and chief
executive officer of  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) , said  population
growth  and the addition of U.S. jobs are fueling a rebound in
the nation’s housing market.  “If one looks at the leading indicators, all signs are
flashing green -- the turn is coming if it is not here
already,” Dimon said today in a letter today to shareholders of
New York-based JPMorgan, the largest U.S. bank by assets. “We
don’t want to be blindly optimistic, but the facts are the
facts.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
