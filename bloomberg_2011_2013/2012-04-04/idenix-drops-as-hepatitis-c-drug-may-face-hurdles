Idenix Pharmaceuticals Inc. (IDIX)  sank the
most in eight months as investors speculated the company’s
experimental hepatitis C treatment may face development hurdles.  Idenix dropped 12 percent to $9 at 4 p.m. New York time,
for the biggest one-day decline since Aug. 9. The shares of the
Cambridge, Massachusetts-based company had tripled in the 12
months before today as larger drugmakers made a series of
takeovers of companies developing hepatitis C therapies.  Roche Holding AG (ROG)  reported an “unacceptable relapse rate”
for patients on a combination of medicines today that Brean
Murray Carret & Co. analyst Brian Skorney called a “good
surrogate for any oral combination that includes IDX184,”
Idenix’s experimental medicine.  “We believe Idenix will need to explore regimens with
durations of greater than 12 weeks to be effective,” Skorney
wrote in a note to clients today. “We believe this could
significantly delay clinical development and makes IDX184
substantially less attractive as a potential backbone therapy.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
