OAO Mechel (MTL) , Russia’s largest
producer of coal for steelmakers, retreated in U.S. trading as
concern the  Federal Reserve  may refrain from more monetary
stimulus sent commodity prices lower.  Mechel’s  American depositary receipts  slid 4.1 percent to
$9.01 at 11:55 a.m. in  New York , leading declines on the
Bloomberg Russia-US Equity Index of Russian companies traded in
New York.  Steel, nickel, aluminum and copper fell in London after the
minutes from the March 13 meeting of the Federal Open Market
Committee showed a decreased urgency for further monetary
stimulus. The Fed will refrain from increasing monetary
accommodation unless economic expansion falters or prices rise
at a rate slower than its 2 percent target, the minutes,
released yesterday, showed.  “This is the market’s negative first reaction to the
report that the Fed may not continue with the monetary easing,”
Oleg Petropavlovskiy, a metals and mining analyst at Moscow’s
Broker Credit Service, said by phone today. “All commodities
fell today on this fear.”  Mechel (MTLR)  lost 4.7 percent to 266.30 rubles on Moscow’s Micex
Index, or the equivalent of $9.04. One ADR represents one
ordinary share.  To contact the reporters on this story:
