PDG Realty SA Empreendimentos &
Participacoes (PDGR3) ,  Brazil ’s second-biggest homebuilder by revenue,
headed to its lowest price in 2 1/2 years after fourth-quarter
profit plunged 85 percent and trailed analysts’ estimates.  Shares dropped 2.7 percent to 5.80 reais at 11:04 a.m. in
Sao Paulo. A close at that level would be the lowest since July
2009. The benchmark Bovespa index declined 1 percent.  Adjusted net income was 31.2 million reais ($17.1 million)
in the quarter, compared with 213.1 million reais a year
earlier, the company said in a statement yesterday. The result
 missed  the average estimate of 174.9 million reais among 10
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  “PDG’s results disappointed,” Bradesco Corretora analysts
including Luiz Mauricio Garcia wrote in a note to clients today.
They recommended investors take a “cautious approach” to the
stock, citing concerns about a “combination of lower growth
with lower margins.”  PDG’s net sales fell 3 percent to 1.76 billion reais in the
fourth quarter. Costs of units sold increased 5 percent and
capitalized interest expenses rose 32 percent. PDG registered a
one-time charge of 222 million reais caused by higher expenses
for some projects.  The homebuilder also lowered its forecast for new projects
this year to a range of 8 billion reais to 9 billion reais, from
a previous forecast of 9 billion reais to 11 billion reais.  The target “seems more realistic in view of all the
operational challenges” to integrate Agre Empreendimentos
Imobiliarios SA with PDG, Credit Suisse Group AG’s analysts
wrote in a note to clients yesterday. PDG acquired Agre in 2010
for 2.44 billion reais in stock to create what at the time was
the country’s largest homebuilder.  To contact the reporter on this story:
