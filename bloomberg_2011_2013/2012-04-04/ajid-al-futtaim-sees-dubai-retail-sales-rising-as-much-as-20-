Majid Al Futtaim Holding LLC, the
operator of malls and hotels in the  Middle East , expects retail
sales to rise between 15 to 20 percent this year as more
visitors shop in Dubai.  Sales at malls operated by the company, including one with
an indoor ski slope, returned to levels last seen in 2008 in the
first quarter, as shoppers from the Gulf, mainly  Saudi Arabia ,
 Russia  and  Europe  traveled to the emirate, Peter Walichnowski,
Chief Executive Officer Majid Al Futtaim Properties, said in a
phone interview today.  Dubai’s international airport, home to the world’s largest
airline by international traffic Emirates, saw passenger traffic
grow 19 percent in February from a year ago to 4.56 million, it
said March 27. The emirate, which has the Middle East’s largest
mall and the world’s tallest skyscraper, received 9.3 million
tourists last year, up 10 percent from 2010, its tourism
department said March 7.  “Dubai has certainly come back,” said Walichnowski. “Our
foot traffic and sales are higher than they were in 2008 pre-
crash, which was the peak year. We benefited from the Arab
Spring as Dubai has seen more tourists coming in.”  Majid Al Futtaim opened a 400 million dirhams ($109
million) mall in Fujairah, one of the  United Arab Emirates ’
northern sheikhdoms, today with 105 retail outlets, the CEO
said. The company also aims to build four to five large malls in
Saudi Arabia over five to seven years and may announce the first
development in the next 12 to 18 months, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
