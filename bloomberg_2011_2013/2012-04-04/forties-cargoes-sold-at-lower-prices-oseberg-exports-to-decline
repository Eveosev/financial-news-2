Three cargoes of  North Sea   Forties (EUCSFORT) 
crude were sold at lower prices than yesterday. Total SA failed
to buy Russian Urals in the Mediterranean at a narrower discount
to Dated Brent.  Exports of North Sea Oseberg grade for May will drop by two
lots from this month to seven cargoes, a loading program
obtained by Bloomberg News showed.  North Sea  Royal Dutch Shell Plc bought one Forties cargo for loading
on April 14 to April 16 from Vitol Group at 20 cents a barrel
less than  Dated Brent (EUCRBRDT) , and a second lot for April 21 to April 23
from BP Plc at 25 cents more than the benchmark, according to a
Bloomberg survey of traders and brokers monitoring the Platts
trading window. Yesterday, Shell bought one shipment at a
premium of 40 cents for April 23 to April 25.  Morgan Stanley bought a cargo for April 17 to April 19 from
Trafigura Beheer BV at 10 cents more than Dated Brent, the
survey showed.  Total was unable to sell at 30 cents a barrel more than
Dated Brent for April 18 to April 20, while Vitol failed to sell
one lot for loading on the same dates at a premium of 50 cents,
according to the survey.  Shell didn’t manage to buy a third cargo for April 25 to
April 29 at 30 cents more than Dated Brent, the survey showed.  Reported North Sea trading typically occurs during the
Platts window, which ends at 4:30 p.m.  London  time. Before the
session, Forties loading in 10 to 25 days was 22 cents a barrel
more than Dated Brent, compared with a premium of 40 cents
yesterday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Brent for May settlement traded at $122.96 a barrel on the
ICE Futures  Europe  exchange in London at the close of the
window, down from $125.50 yesterday. The June contract was at
$122.49, a discount of 47 cents to May.  Shipments of Oseberg will total 4.2 million barrels, or
135,484 barrels a day, down from 180,000 barrels a day in April,
according to the plan.  Exports of Troll crude in May will drop by two lots to 15
cargoes, while loadings of Grane will be unchanged from this
month at seven shipments of 600,000 barrels each, shipping
schedules showed.  One cargo of Forties for loading in April was delayed to
May, bringing total deferrals for this month to nine shipments,
according to two people with knowledge of the export program.  The consignment with parcel number F0420 was postponed to
May from April 26, the first to be delayed to the next month,
said the people, who declined to be identified because the
information is confidential.  Mediterranean/Urals  Total failed to buy 80,000 metric tons of Urals for April
14 to April 18 delivery to Augusta,  Italy , at $2.50 a barrel
less than Dated Brent, compared with its previous bid at a
discount of $2.70 on April 2, the survey showed.  No bids or offers were made for  Urals (EUCSURNW)  in northwest Europe
for the sixth session. The grade was at an 11-month low of $3.65
a barrel less than Dated Brent in the region, unchanged from
yesterday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “The current weakness is largely due to the April export
program promising the highest Urals export levels since August
2010, while lower demand from refiners and steady inflows of
Middle Eastern barrels have also been weighing on the regional
sour crude market,”  Johannes Benigni , Vienna-based managing
director at JBC Energy GmbH, said today in an e-mailed report.  OAO Surgutneftegas sold three 100,000-ton cargoes of Urals
via a tender to Shell and BP for loading from the Baltic Sea
port of Primorsk, said three traders, who declined to be
identified because the information is confidential.  BP won the consignment for loading on April 21 to April 22,
while Shell got one shipment for April 23 to April 24 and
another for April 26 to April 27, according to the people.  Saudi Arabian Oil Co. cut differentials used in determining
its official selling prices for Arab Light to customers in
Northwest Europe and the  Mediterranean Sea  for May shipments, a
person familiar with the pricing decision said.  West Africa  Bharat Petroleum Corp.,  India ’s second-largest state
refiner, bought 1 million barrels of Nigerian Akpo crude for
loading in May from Glencore International Plc, according to
three traders who declined to be identified because the
information is confidential.  Nigeria ’s benchmark  Qua Iboe (AFCSQUA1)  blend was at a premium of
$2.53 a barrel to Dated Brent, up 2 cents from yesterday,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
