Rural Electrification Corp., an
Indian state-controlled lender to power projects, has increased
the size of its yen-denominated loan and expects to borrow as
much as $230 million, Finance Director Hari Das Khunteta said.  The New Delhi-based lender signed the five-year facility
for $150 million, arranged by Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd.,
Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp. and  Mizuho Financial Group Inc. (8411) ,
last month, Khunteta said in a telephone interview.  Syndication to other lenders is expected to close as early
as tomorrow and a mix of Japanese and Taiwanese banks are
expected to lend the balance, Khunteta said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
