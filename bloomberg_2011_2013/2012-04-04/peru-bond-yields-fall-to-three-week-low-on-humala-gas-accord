Peruvian dollar bonds rose, pushing
yields to a three-week low, after the government reached an
agreement with operators of the Andean nation’s largest gas
fields to boost domestic supply.  The yield on the nation’s benchmark 6.55 percent bond due
March 2037 fell two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to
4.65 percent at 3:17 p.m. Lima time. The price rose 0.41 cent to
127.95 cents per dollar.  The Camisea Group agreed to devote one of its natural gas
blocks to the domestic market, President  Ollanta Humala  said
yesterday. The accord allows Humala to meet pledges made during
last year’s campaign to give priority to the domestic energy
market, boosting support for his government while spurring
investment, said Felipe Hernandez, an analyst at RBS Securities
Inc.  “He has done well by keeping promises made during the
election campaign while at the same time maintaining a friendly
environment for foreign investment,” Hernandez said by phone
from  Stamford ,  Connecticut . “There’s a lot of potential to
develop a petrochemical industry in  Peru  after this agreement.”  The sol was little changed at 2.666 per U.S. dollar at
today’s close, from 2.667 yesterday, according to Deutsche Bank
AG’s local unit.  The central bank bought $56 million in the spot currency
market today to stem gains in the sol. It paid an average 2.6668
soles per  U.S. dollar , according to a statement on its website.  The yield on the nation’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol-
denominated bond due August 2020 fell one basis point to 5.45
percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The price rose
0.06 centimo to 115.76 centimos per sol.  To contact the reporter on this story:
