Shore Capital Group Ltd. (SGR) , a U.K.
investment bank and stockbroker, swung to a full-year net loss
after writing down the value of its investments in Puma Hotels
and Spectrum Investments.  The net loss was 1.1 million pounds ($1.8 million),
compared with a 4.5 million-pound profit the previous year, the
London-based firm said in a statement today. The loss includes a
4.8 million-pound writedown on Shore’s investment in Puma and a
1.3 million-pound loss on Spectrum.  “2011 proved to be one of the most challenging years for
our industry since the establishment of our business in 1985,”
Executive Chairman Howard Shore said in the statement.
“Activity levels so far in 2012 have picked up well from the
quieter months of last year’s second half but are still behind
the comparable period last year.”  The European debt crisis, which heightened in the third
quarter of last year, crimped the pace of transactions such as
share sales and acquisitions as companies sought to hoard cash
and reduce risk-taking. Shore bought Spectrum, the owner of a
telecommunications business, to increase its presence in
 Germany , where the company already manages property assets.  The company will pay a second-half dividend of 0.25 pence a
share, compared with 0.625 pence in the same period in 2010.
That brings the full-year dividend to 0.5 pence a share,
compared with 0.875 pence the previous year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
