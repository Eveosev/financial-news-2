Bayer AG (BAYN)  may sell two research
stations where it tests the tolerance of experimental drugs on
healthy volunteers,  Financial Times Deutschland  said, citing

Andreas Busch to executive staff and works council members.  Bayer has approached four or five companies it works with
that may be interested in purchasing the German businesses,
which employ a total of 25 people, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
