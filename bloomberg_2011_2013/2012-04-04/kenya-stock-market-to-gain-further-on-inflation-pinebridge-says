Kenya ’s stock market, which has
risen  11 percent  this year, will continue to gain in the second
quarter as the inflation rate falls and boosts consumption,
PineBridge Investments LLC said.  “We are likely to see a bit of positive sentiment driving
performance on improved macroeconomic indicators,” Joel
Warutere, an investment manager at PineBridge Investments East
Africa Ltd., told reporters today in Nairobi.  Kenya’s inflation rate declined for a fourth month to 15.61
percent in March from 16.69 percent in the previous month, the
Nairobi-based Kenya National Bureau of Statistics said in an e-
mailed statement March 30. Stocks rebounded in the first quarter
of the year following “strong earnings” announced by companies
listed on the Nairobi Securities Exchange, Warutere said.  Kenyan stocks plunged 30 percent last year, the second-
worst performer in sub-Saharan  Africa  after  Egypt , as drought
drove inflation and sent the shilling 5.2 percent weaker in the
year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The yield on the benchmark 91-day Treasury bill fell to
16.728 percent at the latest weekly auction on March 28 from
19.91 percent at the last auction of 2011.  The declining yields of fixed-income securities and an
increase in risk appetite will also boost the performance of
Kenyan stocks, Warutere said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
