The Serbian central bank said it
sold euros today to add liquidity to the local foreign-exchange
market and support the dinar.  The Belgrade-based Narodna Banka Srbije sold 10 million
euros ($13.12 million) to “enable the smooth functioning of the
foreign-exchange market,” it said in a statement posted on its
