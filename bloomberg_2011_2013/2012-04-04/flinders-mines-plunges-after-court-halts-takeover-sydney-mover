Flinders Mines Ltd. (FMS) , the Australian
iron ore developer being taken over by  OAO Magnitogorsk Iron &
Steel (MAGN) , plunged the most in three and a half years after a
Russian court blocked the transaction.  Flinders fell as much as 21.6 percent to 23.5 Australian
cents, the most since Oct. 10, 2008, and traded at 25 cents as
of noon in Sydney. The key S&P/ASX 200 Index fell 0.4 percent.  Elena Egorova, who owns less than 0.001 percent of MMK, won
an order from the arbitration court of Chelyabinsk on March 30
preventing the Russian steelmaker from implementing the board’s
decisions on the A$554 million ($569 million) deal. The
transaction is against shareholder interests, she argued.  The Federal Court of  Australia  adjourned a second hearing
of the case to a “date to be advised,” Flinders said in a
separate statement yesterday.  MMK agreed in November to buy Flinders, which has rights to
an untapped Pilbara field in  Western Australia . The transaction
was approved by Flinders shareholders on March 30 and was
expected to be cleared yesterday by the Australian court.  To contact the reporter on this story:
