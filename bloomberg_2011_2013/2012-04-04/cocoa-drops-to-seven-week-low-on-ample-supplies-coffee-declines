Cocoa fell to the lowest since
January on signs of improved crop prospects in  Ivory Coast , the
world’s top producer. Coffee dropped, and sugar gained.  Rainfall in Ivory Coast was “pretty much normal for late
March and early April,” and the region will have more showers
this week, bolstering the production potential, Paul Markert, a
meteorologist at MDA Information Systems Inc. in Gaithersburg,
 Maryland , said in an e-mail yesterday. The commodity rose 5.2
percent in the first quarter on speculation that dry weather
would trim the country’s yields.  There’s a “better outlook for Ivory Coast’s mid-crop,”
that will be collected from April to September, Judy Ganes- Chase, the president of J. Ganes Consulting in Katonah, New
York, said today in an e-mail. “Rains are spreading.”  Cocoa futures for May delivery dropped 2.8 percent to
settle at $2,083 a metric ton at 12:05 p.m. on ICE Futures U.S.
in  New York . Prices have fallen for six straight sessions, the
longest slide since Dec. 9. Earlier, the commodity touched
$2,060, the lowest since Jan. 9.  Arabica-coffee futures for May delivery fell 0.3 percent to
$1.8475 a pound in New York.  Raw-sugar futures for July delivery climbed 0.3 percent to
23.54 cents a pound on ICE.  In London futures trading, cocoa and robusta coffee slid on
NYSE Liffe. Refined sugar rose.  To contact the reporters on this story:
