Three parties expressed interest in
a 90-year lease for the International Broadcast Center property
built for the 2004 Athens  Olympic Games , the Hellenic Republic
Asset Development Fund said.  Parties that meet the relevant criteria will be disclosed
next week and invited to submit binding offers, the fund said in
an e-mailed statement today.  “Three strong investor groups with significant experience
in commercial real estate decided to compete, bringing their
funding and ideas to further develop this Olympic property,”
fund Executive Director Andreas Taprantzis said in the
statement.  The property includes the Golden Hall commercial center,
offices and parking areas. Expressions of interest are due from
investors by April 4, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
