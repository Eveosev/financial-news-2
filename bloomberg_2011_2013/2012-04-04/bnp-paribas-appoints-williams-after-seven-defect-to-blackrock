BNP Paribas Investment Partners
named Guy Williams to lead its global developing-market
fixed-income team a day after  BlackRock Inc. (BLK)  announced that it
hired away seven of its emerging-debt specialists.  BNP Paribas, which manages more than 4.5 billion euros
($5.9 billion) of emerging-market debt, said today in an
e-mailed statement that it appointed London-based Williams to
the position from within its ranks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
