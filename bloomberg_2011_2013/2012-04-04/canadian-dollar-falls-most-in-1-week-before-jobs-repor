Canada ’s dollar depreciated against
its U.S. counterpart before a report tomorrow that forecasters
predict will show the nation’s job growth slowing as the global
recovery remains tepid.  The currency dropped by the most in almost two weeks versus
the greenback, which rose against all but one of its 16 most-
traded counterparts after diminished demand at a Spanish auction
crimped appetite for risk, sending global stocks lower. The
 European Central Bank  left  interest rates  unchanged before U.S.
payroll data are released April 6.  “Absent a strong catalyst in the short- or medium-term,
the Canadian dollar looks to me very rich at these levels,”
 Shaun Osborne , chief currency strategist at  Toronto-Dominion
Bank (TD) , said in an interview. “It will be difficult to break out
of this range.” The floor for the Canadian dollar is 98 cents
per  U.S. dollar , he said.  Since January, the Canadian dollar has been stuck in a 210
point trading range between C$99.49 and C$1.016. It has gained
2.5 percent against the U.S. dollar this year and trailed seven
other major currencies led by Mexico’s peso, up 9 percent.  Canada’s currency, nicknamed the loonie for the image of
the waterfowl on the C$1 coin, declined 0.5 percent to 99.63
cents per U.S. dollar at 5 p.m. in Toronto, after falling as
much as 0.6 percent, the most since March 22. One Canadian
dollar buys $1.0037.  Government bonds rose, pushing the benchmark 10-year note
yield down seven basis points, or 0.07 percentage point, to 2.13
percent. The 3.25 percent securities maturing in June 2021
traded at C$109.32, up 62 cents.  Jobs Reports  Canadian employers added 10,500 jobs to payrolls last
month, according to the median of 24 forecasts compiled by
Bloomberg News.  Statistics Canada  is due to release the report
tomorrow at 8:30 a.m. in Ottawa. If the data match forecasts, it
would mean  jobs  have increased by 10,000 in the first quarter,
compared with 74,600 in the same quarter in 2011.  U.S. payrolls climbed by more than 200,000 in March for a
fourth month, economists said before the Labor Department report
on April 6, the Good Friday holiday.  “Payrolls on a bank holiday is a good enough reason to
take risk off for anybody,” Kit Juckes, head of foreign-
exchange research at Societe Generale SA, said by phone from
London.  The loonie is up 0.6 percent this week, according to
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes, the most among the 10
currencies tracked. The U.S. dollar has strengthened 0.01
percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
