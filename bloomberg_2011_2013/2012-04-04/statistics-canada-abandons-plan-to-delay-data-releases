Statistics Canada  said it wonâ€™t
delay the release of economic data, after announcing earlier
this week it would implement changes to its dissemination
process.  Data will be released at exactly 8:30 a.m. on its website
and from the media lock-up, the Ottawa-based agency said in an
e-mail to news agencies. The agency earlier this week said it
would delay its releases to the public by as much as 16 seconds
because of a new data-loading process.  To contact the reporter on this story:
