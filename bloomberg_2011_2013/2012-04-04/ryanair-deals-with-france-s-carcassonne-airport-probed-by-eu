Ryanair Holdings Plc (RYA) ’s agreements
with Carcassonne airport in  France  will be probed by European
Union regulators, adding to earlier investigations into
government funding for regional airports.  The European Commission’s in-depth probe will assess
financial arrangements between the French government and the
state-owned airport as well as rebates and marketing agreements
between the airport and Ryanair, the EU executive said in a
statement today.  Regulators have “doubts” over state subsidies for the
airport’s current operator Veolia Transport and government
pledges to pay for airport infrastructure to be used by the
operator free of charge, the commission said. Subsidies of at
least 11 million euros ($14.5 million) paid to the airport’s
previous operator, a local chamber of commerce, between 2000 and
2010 as well as 8 million euros of other subsidies may also
violate state aid rules.  The EU is probing government subsidies for several regional
airports across  Europe  that may have benefited Ryanair and other
low-cost rivals. The Brussels-based commission must approve
large state subsidies to airports and airlines and can order
companies to pay back government funding if it can’t be
justified for providing a public service.  To contact the reporter on this story:
