Russian stocks fell the most in a
month as commodities dropped after Spain sold less debt than
targeted at auction and the  Federal Reserve  signaled it may
refrain from more monetary stimulus.  The  Micex Index (INDEXCF)  of 30 shares declined 2.4 percent to
1,512.88 by the 6:45 p.m. close in Moscow, its biggest one-day
loss since March 6. OAO Surgutneftegas, Russia’s fourth-biggest
oil producer, declined 3.4 percent.  OAO Mechel (MTLR) , the coalmaker,
sank 4.7 percent while OAO Novatek, the nation’s second-biggest
gas producer, retreated 3.7 percent.  Stocks snapped three days of gains as oil, Russia’s main
export earner, fell as much as 2.4 percent after U.S. crude
stockpiles rose and the Fed said it will refrain from increasing
monetary accommodation unless the economic expansion falters or
prices rise at a rate slower than its 2 percent target. Stocks
extended declines as demand dropped at a Spanish bond auction
and the European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  said the
euro-area’s outlook remained subject to “downside risks.”  “The Spanish news is the worst as it brings back memories
of the European debt debacle,”  Ovanes Oganisian , an equity
strategist at Troika Dialog in Moscow, said by phone. “Russia
is the riskiest market in emerging markets and its getting hit
by this tide of bad news.”  Factory orders in  Germany ,  Europe ’s biggest economy,
increased less than economists forecast in February, the
government said today. The European Union is Russia’s largest
trading partner. The HSBC Russia Services PMI fell to 54.4 last
month from 55.3 in February, HSBC Holdings Plc said in a report
today.  Metals  Copper for May delivery slid 1.9 percent to $3.8445 a pound
on the Comex in  New York . The three-month contract fell 1.8
percent to $8,460 a metric ton on the  London  Metal Exchange.
Zinc, lead, nickel, aluminum and tin also fell in London.  OAO GMK Norilsk Nickel, the world’s largest producer of the
metal, sank 2.9 percent to 5,339 rubles, its biggest one-day
loss since March 21.  OAO Rosneft (ROSN) , Russia’s biggest oil company, fell 1.3 percent
to 209.36 rubles. OAO Gazprom, Russia’s gas export monopoly,
retreated 2.1 percent to 181.13 rubles.  OAO Sberbank, Russia’s biggest lender, retreated 1.8
percent to 96.18 rubles a share.  The ruble depreciated 1.2 percent to 29.500 per dollar.  The decline in the Micex trimmed this year’s advance to 7.8
percent. The benchmark gauge is valued at 5.9 times analysts’
earnings estimates for member companies, compared with a 10.6
ratio for Brazil’s Bovespa equity index, which has climbed 12
percent in 2012.  The  Russian Depositary Index (RDXUSD)  of London-traded shares of
Russia’s companies slid 3.3 percent. The MSCI  Emerging Markets 
Index lost 1.7 percent today, the most since March 6 on a
closing basis, to trade at 10.6 times estimated earnings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
