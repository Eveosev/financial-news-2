Copper declined as policy-meeting
minutes from the  Federal Reserve  damped expectations for further
monetary stimulus and increasing stockpiles signaled weaker
demand. Nickel, zinc and lead fell.  Three-month copper fell as much as 1.3 percent to $8,500 a
metric ton on the London Metal Exchange and traded at $8,517.25
at 3:18 p.m. in Tokyo. The May-delivery contract lost 1.2
percent to $3.8715 a pound on the Comex. Markets in  China , the
world’s biggest user, are shut today for a holiday.  Minutes from the March 13 meeting of the  Federal Open
Market Committee , or FOMC, showed that policy makers are holding
off on increasing stimulus unless the economic expansion falters
or prices rise at a rate slower than the Fed’s 2 percent target.
Asian  stocks  fell the most in seven weeks today after U.S.
shares slid and the dollar rallied yesterday.  Copper was “down mildly as disappointment after the U.S.
FOMC minutes offset the positive U.S. manufacturing and factory
orders data over the last couple of days,”  Mark Pervan  and
Natalie Robertson, analysts at Australia & New Zealand Banking
Group Ltd., said in a report today.  Stockpiles monitored by the LME rose for a third session
yesterday after falling to the lowest level since 2008 last
month. Inventories tracked by the Shanghai Futures Exchange were
close to the highest level since at least 2003 in March.  LME  stockpiles  advanced 1.2 percent to 260,650 tons,
exchange figures showed, as supplies increased at the U.S. ports
of Baltimore and  New Orleans  and at Incheon,  South Korea . SME-
tracked holdings peaked at 227,276 tons last month.  Nickel dropped 2.5 percent to $17,985 a ton on the LME,
declining for the first time in four days. Zinc fell 1.3 percent
to $1,995.75 a ton, while lead lost 1.5 percent to $2,040 a ton,
falling for the first time in six days. Aluminum fell 0.5
percent at $2,114.50 a ton and tin slumped 1.1 percent to
$22,775 a ton.  To contact the reporter for this story:
