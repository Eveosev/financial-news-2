The Federal Reserve Bank of  New
York ’s survey of primary dealers conducted before policy makers
met last month showed that the firms saw the probability of
another round of bond buying declining from January.  The median respondent saw a 50 percent chance that the Fed
would expand its balance sheet through securities purchases
within one year, down from 55 percent odds in the survey
conducted before the  Federal Open Market Committee ’s Jan. 24-25
meeting, results released today by the New York Fed showed.  Fed policy makers last month voted to maintain their plan
to keep  interest rates  low through at least late 2014 while
upgrading their assessment of the economy. They called for
additional stimulus only “if the economy lost momentum” or if
inflation stays below their 2 percent inflation target,
according to minutes of the FOMC’s March 13 meeting released
yesterday in  Washington .  Bond dealers pushed back their expectations for the Fed to
raise its benchmark interest rate. The median among the
predictions for the timing of the first increase was during the
third quarter of 2014, compared with the second quarter of 2014
in the January survey, the results showed.  The Fed has kept its  benchmark rate  near zero since
December 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
