American Airlines and regional
partner American Eagle canceled about 500 flights to and from
 Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport  today in the aftermath
of a hailstorm that battered planes.  American had 62 aircraft out of service because of hail
damage late in the day, down from 66 earlier, said Tim Smith, an
American spokesman. Eagle had 20 grounded by hail, compared with
28 previously. Both airlines are units of  Fort Worth , Texas-
based  AMR Corp. (AAMRQ)   Today’s cancellations represent about one-third of American
and American Eagle operations at D-FW, the company’s biggest
hub, and 15 percent of its total system operations for one day,
Smith said. About 50 flights have been canceled to and from the
airport tomorrow, he said.  More than 100 aircraft were damaged by hail at the airport,
said  David Magana , a D-FW spokesman. About 1,400 passengers
spent last night at the airport, while “thousands” more went
to hotels or made other lodging arrangements, he said in a
statement today.  The airport is situated midway between Dallas and Fort
Worth. American and Eagle canceled about 460 flights yesterday
after  tornadoes,  hail and thunderstorms moved through the
region.  Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV)  is operating a normal schedule today
from Dallas Love Field, said Paul Flaningan, a spokesman. The
hailstorm that pounded D-FW missed Love, which is closer to
downtown Dallas.  To contact the reporter on this story:
