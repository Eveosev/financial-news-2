JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) , the largest
and most profitable U.S. bank, gave Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer  Jamie Dimon  $23 million in pay and bonuses for 2011,
about the same as the previous year.  Dimon’s base salary was raised to $1.5 million beginning in
March 2011 from $1 million and he received $17 million in
restricted stock and options for his performance in 2011, down
from $17.4 million the previous year, the New York-based company
said today in a proxy statement. His cash bonus was $4.5
million, down from $5 million in 2010, the bank said.  JPMorgan capped its second straight year of  record profit 
in 2011 with $19 billion in net income. The European sovereign-
debt crisis, mortgage losses and litigation weighed on the
company’s shares, which slumped  22 percent  for the year --
beating the 25 percent drop by the 24-company KBW Bank Index.  Dimon, 56, received restricted shares valued at $12
million, according to the proxy. He also received options valued
at $5 million, based on the company’s calculations.  The CEO took a salary of $1 million for 2009 and gave up
bonuses that year and in 2008 after receiving $49.9 million in
total compensation for 2007. Dimon and his wife control almost
5.2 million shares valued at more than $209 million as of March
2, when his total holdings were last disclosed.  Best-Paid Bankers  Dimon is among the nation’s best-paid bankers.  Bank of
America Corp ., the second-largest U.S. lender by assets, cut CEO
 Brian T. Moynihan ’s 2011 total compensation 30 percent to $7
million.  Citigroup Inc. (C) , ranked third, awarded CEO Vikram Pandit
$14.9 million.  Jes Staley, the CEO of JPMorgan’s investment bank, had his
compensation cut 6 percent to $16 million, including a $5.3
million cash bonus, $7.95 million in restricted stock units and
$2 million in options, according to the proxy.  Mary Erdoes, the CEO of asset management, got $14.5
million, a cut of 3.5 percent, and Chief Investment Officer Ina Drew received $14 million, a 6.8 percent reduction, JPMorgan
said. Chief Financial Officer Doug Braunstein’s compensation
totaled $9.5 million, down 21 percent from 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
