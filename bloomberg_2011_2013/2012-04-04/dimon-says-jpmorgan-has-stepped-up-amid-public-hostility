Jamie Dimon , chairman and chief
executive officer of  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) , said banks face
public ire after the economic slump and European debt crisis.  “The frustration with -- and hostility toward -- our
industry continues,” Dimon said today in a letter to
shareholders of New York-based JPMorgan, the largest U.S. bank
by assets. “We have not retrenched. Just the opposite -- we
have stepped up.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
