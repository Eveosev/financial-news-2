Nissan Motor Co. Chief Executive
Officer  Carlos Ghosn  said sales of the company’s Leaf electric
car will rise by the middle of the year.  “The Leaf will get a boost from local production in the
 United States  starting this summer,” Ghosn said at the New York
International Auto Show. “Not only the environment but also
economic concerns will move people to the Leaf.”  Ghosn also repeated his prediction that electric vehicles
will capture 10 percent market share by 2020 in the markets
where they are on sale.  “I am not at all changing my very bullish approach to
zero-emission cars,” Ghosn said. “The electric car will hold
its promise. All the stars are lining up to make it a very
important segment.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
