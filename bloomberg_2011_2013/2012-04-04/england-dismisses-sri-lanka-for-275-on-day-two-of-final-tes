England  bowled  Sri Lanka  out for 275
before reaching 11 without loss in reply at lunch on day two of
the series-deciding cricket Test in Colombo.  Sri Lanka added 37 runs to its overnight score of 238-6 as
spin bowler Graeme Swann took three wickets to complete figures
of 4-75. Swann removed Suraj Randiv and Angelo Mathews before
Tim Bresnan dismissed Rangana Herath, then wrapped up the
innings by bowling Suranga Lakmal without scoring.  England, which has only got past 275 runs once in its past
eight innings, must win at the P. Sara Oval to retain the No. 1
Test ranking after losing last weekâ€™s opening Test by 75 runs.
 South Africa  will take the top spot should England fail to tie
the two-match series.  Alastair Cook was 7 not out at the interval, with England
captain Andrew Strauss on 4. Home skipper Mahela Jayawardene top
scored with 105 for Sri Lanka, which is seeking its first Test
series victory since August 2009.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
