A URL Pharma Inc. unit sued  Par
Pharmaceutical Cos. (PRX)  alleging infringement of 10 patents with its
plans to market a generic version of the  Colcrys  gout treatment.  AR Holding Inc. contends in a complaint filed today in
federal court in Wilmington, Delaware, that Par has wrongly
applied to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for approval to
sell its copies before the patents expire.  The Wilmington-based holding company “will be irreparably
harmed by Par’s infringing activities” unless misuse of the
technology is stopped by a judge, it said in court papers.  AR Holding seeks a ruling that Par, of Woodcliff Lake,  New
Jersey , infringes the patents and asks for unspecified damages
and legal fees.  A spokeswoman for Par, Allison Wey, didn’t immediately
return a call seeking comment.  Par fell 57 cents, or 1.4 percent, to $39.05 in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading at 2:52 p.m.  The case is AR Holding Co. v. Par Pharmaceutical, 12-cv-
419, U.S. District Court, District of  Delaware  (Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
