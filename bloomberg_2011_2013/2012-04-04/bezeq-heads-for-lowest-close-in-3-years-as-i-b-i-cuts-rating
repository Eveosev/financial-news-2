Bezeq Israeli Telecommunication
Corp. (BEZQ)  headed for the lowest close in more than three years,
after Israel’s largest fixed-line phone company was lowered to
neutral by I.B.I.-Israel Brokerage & Investments Ltd.  The  shares  retreated 3.1 percent to 5.90 shekels, poised
for the lowest close since December 2008, at 11:59 a.m. in Tel
Aviv. I.B.I. lowered the stock from buy and cut the share-price
estimate to 6.7 shekels, citing possible regulatory changes that
may force Bezeq to cut fees.  Protests since July against rising prices for everything
from housing to cottage cheese have spurred Israeli policy
makers to zero in on cutting the cost of living. Prime Minister
 Benjamin Netanyahu ’s government is forcing telecom providers to
cut fees and is encouraging new players to break up a market
where the three biggest companies control 95 percent of sales.  “Regulatory changes so far have focused mainly on the
cellular sector,” Ori Licht, head of equity research at I.B.I.,
wrote in an e-mailed note today. “We think the full thrust of
this drive will now be trained on the fixed-line.”  Psagot Investment House Ltd. reinitiated coverage of the
stock with a sell recommendation and a share-price estimate of 5
shekels, analyst Ilanit Sherf said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
