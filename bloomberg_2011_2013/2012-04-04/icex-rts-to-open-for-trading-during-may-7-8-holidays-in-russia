The Micex-RTS exchange will open for
trading during the May 7-8 national holidays in  Russia , the
bourse said on its website.  Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin  last month designated May 7
and May 8 holidays, extending the time off around Victory Day on
May 9, which celebrates the  Soviet Union â€™s triumph over  Germany 
in World War II.  April 30 and May 1, 7, 8 and 9 are holidays in Russia this
year, while three Saturdays in a row -- April 28, May 5 and May
12 are working days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
