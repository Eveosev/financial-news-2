Croatia ’s central bank said it is
considering lowering the mandatory reserve ratio for lenders to
free up about 5 billion kuna ($877 million) that companies could
use for financing operations.  The reserve ratio would be lowered to 13.5 percent from 15
percent, freeing up some 4.1 billion kuna and the equivalent of
900 million kuna in foreign reserves, the Hrvatska Narodna Banka
in the capital Zagreb said on its website today. The bank will
debate the proposal next week and take effect as early as this
month, it added.  Commercial banks would add an additional 8 billion kuna to
the program that is meant to support an  economic recovery , it
said.  Croatia’s economy, which has been struggling to emerge from
a two-year recession, will contract about 1 percent this year,
 Standard & Poor’s  said yesterday in affirming the country’s
credit rating at BBB- with a negative outlook.  To contact the reporter on this story:
