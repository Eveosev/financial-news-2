French Socialist Francois Hollande,
the leading candidate to win next month’s presidential vote,
said that were he to win he would seek support from  CAC 40 (CAC)  chief
executives the day after the election.  “The day after the presidential election I would meet the
CAC 40 companies, even if most of their managers didn’t vote for
me,” Hollande said, according to an advance copy of an
interview to be published tomorrow in  Paris Match  magazine.
“I’ll tell them they need to be the tip of the spear of the
French economy, that we need you and you need the state. We must
face the challenges of restoring  France  together.”  Hollande has consistently led President  Nicolas Sarkozy  in
voter support, with  13 polls  since mid-March giving him a lead
of between 6 and 12 points in the decisive second round of the
election. French voters will cast their ballots among 10
candidates on April 22. The top two face off on May 6.  To contact the reporters on this story:
