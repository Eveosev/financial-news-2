South Sudan  shot down a Sudanese MiG
jet fighter while it was flying over its Unity state, a sign of
heightening tensions between the former civil war foes.  “This is proof of what we were talking about for the past
month: that the Republic of Sudan was invading our airspace and
bombing our villages and towns,” Minister of Information
Barnaba Marial Benjamin said today by phone from Juba, the
capital. Sudan army spokesman al-Sawarami Khaled didn’t answer
calls seeking comment in Khartoum, the capital of Sudan.  The incident occured a week after troops from the countries
fought for two days along their disputed border. The clashes
prompted expressions of concern from the  United Nations , the
U.S. and the  African Union .  Sudan’s government is fighting insurgent forces in its
border states of Blue Nile and oil-rich Southern Kordofan. South
Sudan seceded from the north in July, assuming control of about
three-quarters of the formerly unified nation’s daily production
of 490,000 barrels a day. The north and south fought a two-
decade civil war that ended in 2005.  Negotiators from the two countries met today in the
Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa, in the latest attempt to reach
agreement on issues such as border demarcation and how much
South Sudan should pay Sudan to ships its crude to an export
terminal on the  Red Sea .  To contact the reporter on this story:
