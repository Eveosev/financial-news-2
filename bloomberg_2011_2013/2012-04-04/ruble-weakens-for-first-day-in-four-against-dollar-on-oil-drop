The ruble weakened for the first
time in four days against the dollar as oil,  Russia ’s chief
export earner, fell in  New York .  The Russian currency lost 0.9 percent to 29.4198 per dollar
as of 10:38 a.m. in Moscow. The ruble gained 0.2 percent to
38.85 per euro and weakened 0.4 percent to 33.6589 against the
central bank’s target dollar-euro basket.  Crude futures lost 0.4 percent to $103.56 per barrel in New
York after data from the  American Petroleum Institute  showed
U.S. supplies climbed the most since December last week, a sign
of weaker demand in the world’s largest consumer of the
commodity. Federal Reserve minutes from March indicated no need
for more monetary stimulus unless economic growth slows.  Investors increased bets on the ruble weakening, with non-
deliverable forwards showing the currency at 29.8074 per dollar
in three months, compared with expectations of 29.6540 per
dollar yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
