European winter wheat output will be
4.7 percent smaller than forecast last month because of freeze
damage, according to farm adviser Offre & Demande Agricole.  Production will be 126.7 million metric tons, down from 133
million tons forecast last month and 129.9 million tons last
year, the Bourges, France-based company said at a press
conference in Paris today. Limited rainfall may mean another
reduction in the estimate, the company said.  “Western  Europe  has had rainfall 30 to 50 percent lower
than normal,” Benoit Labouille, ODA’s general director, said at
the conference. “We can’t say today that this has affected
grains but it does pose a risk for grains that have already been
affected by the cold.”  Production in  France  will be 34.5 million tons in 2012, up
from 34 million last year, Labouille estimated. About 330,000
hectares (815,448 acres) were damaged because of cold in
February and lack of snow cover to protect plants, Labouille
said. Farmers in France planted an estimated 5.1 million
hectares of soft wheat, ODA said. That compares with a
government estimate of 5.05 million hectares in February.  To contact the reporter on this story:
