Rain will start falling in sugar-
cane growing areas in  Brazil , the world’s biggest producer of
the sweetener, as of April 6 and will become heavier by the
middle of next week, according to Somar Meteorologia.  The absence of regular rainfall in February’s second half
and last month reduced soil moisture, hampering new plantings’
development, Marco Antonio dos Santos, an agronomist at the Sao
Paulo-based weather forecaster, wrote in a report e-mailed
yesterday. Dry weather will also delay replanting of cane
fields, he said.  The predicted rains “will be enough to raise soil moisture
and allow the cane to develop reasonably,” dos Santos said.  Growers in center south, Brazil’s main producing region,
are set to harvest 510 million to 520 million metric tons of
cane in the 2012-13 season, he said. The harvest, which usually
starts at the beginning of April, will be delayed to the month’s
last week or even May, according to Somar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
