Yields on  Nigeria ’s dollar-
denominated bonds due 2021 rose from record lows as rising crude
stockpiles caused a decline in oil prices.  The yield on the $500 million of Eurobonds of Africa’s
biggest oil producer rose seven basis points, or 0.07 percent,
to 5.385 percent by 12:48 p.m. in London, after reaching 5.312
percent yesterday, the lowest since the debt was issued in
January 2011, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Oil for May delivery declined as much as $1.18 to $102.83 a
barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile
Exchange. It last traded at $103.07 after losing 1.2 percent
yesterday. U.S. crude inventories probably increased 2.5 million
barrels in the week ended March 30 to 355.9 million, the highest
since August, according to the median estimate of 11 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg News.  “Movement in  oil prices , being Nigeria’s key revenue
earner will at any point impact the country’s reserves and the
outlook of its debt,” Sewa Wusu, analyst at Lagos-based
Sterling Capital Ltd., said by phone today.  The naira appreciated less than 0.1 percent to 157.65 per
dollar on the  interbank market  in Lagos, the commercial capital.
The currency of sub-Saharan Africa’s second largest economy has
risen 3 percent this year.  “The naira is likely to be supported by oil flows in
coming days and offshore inflows into treasury bill auction next
week, while we see it trading in a 157.5 to 158 range over the
next few trading sessions,”  Samir Gadio , an emerging-markets
strategist at Standard Bank Group Ltd. in  London , said in an e-
mailed response to questions.  Nigeria’s borrowing costs for domestic bonds due 2015 fell
three basis points to 15.10 percent, according to the Financial
Markets Dealers Association website.  Ghana’s cedi declined 0.1 percent at 1.7860 per dollar in
Accra, the capital, the lowest since at least 1993, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
