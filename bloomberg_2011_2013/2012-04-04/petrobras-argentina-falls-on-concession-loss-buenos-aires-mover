Petrobras Argentina SA (PESA)  fell the most
in a month after its parent company lost an oil field concession
in the country.  Petrobras Argentina, a unit of Brazil’s state-controlled
oil company  Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4) , fell 6.4 percent to 6.30
pesos at the close in Buenos Aires, the biggest drop since March
6.  The government of the province of Neuquen yesterday revoked
a concession held by Petroleo Brasileiro for the Veta Escondida
oil field, citing lack of investment. The decision comes after
 YPF SA (YPFD) , Argentina’s largest oil producer, lost 12 licenses in
five provinces since March 14 as President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner’s government demanded higher investment to curb
declines in output and rising fuel imports.  “Petrobras Argentina is falling as people see that what
began as a war between YPF and the government is extending to
other companies,” Carlos Aszpis, an equity strategist at
Schweber & Cia., said in phone interview from  Buenos Aires .  To contact the reporter on this story:
