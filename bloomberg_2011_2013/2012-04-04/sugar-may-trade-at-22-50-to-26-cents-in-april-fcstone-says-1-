Raw sugar prices may trade at 22.50
cents to 26 cents a pound in New York this month on uncertainty
over the size of the crop in  Brazil , the world’s top producer,
according to broker INTL FCStone Inc.  Sugar climbed 2.2 percent in the first quarter on
speculation Brazil’s output would be smaller than initially
anticipated and the start of the harvests would be delayed.
Archer Consulting in  Sao Paulo  lowered its sugar-cane crop
estimate for the country’s main producing region to 512 million
metric tons on March 31 from 521 million tons a month earlier.  FCStone expects “to see a bit more clarity set in once
Brazilian uncertainties start to lift,” the New York-based
company said in a monthly report e-mailed yesterday.  Coffee prices may ease “over the weeks ahead” on improved
supplies from Brazil and  Vietnam , the world’s biggest producers,
according to the report. The coffee season in Brazil usually
starts in July and harvesting may begin in May.  “The robusta complex is not awash with coffee and, indeed,
the market’s supply and demand numbers are expected to be in a
rough cumulative balance for both this year and next,” FCStone
said in the report. The variety is grown mainly in  Asia  and
parts of Africa and is used to make instant drinks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
