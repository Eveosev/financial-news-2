Wolfgang Eder,  Voestalpine AG (VOE) ’s
chief executive officer, said the capacity of the European Union
steel industry exceeds demand by 45 million tons and must be
cut,  Handelsblatt  reported.  Excess capacity is weighing on profitability and preventing
a sustainable recovery by the industry, the newspaper cited Eder
as saying.  Voestalpine doesn’t exclude “larger acquisitions´´ as it
strives to increase sales to 20 billion euros ($26 billion) by
2020, from about 12 billion euros today, Eder told Handelsblatt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
