Russiaâ€™s inflation remained
unchanged in March at the slowest annual rate since the  Soviet
Union  collapsed two decades ago.  Consumer prices  rose 3.7 percent from a year earlier and
 grew  0.6 percent in the month, the Federal Statistics Service in
Moscow said in an e-mailed statement today. Economists estimated
increases of 3.7 percent and 0.5 percent, two surveys showed.  Core inflation , which excludes volatile costs such as
energy, was unchanged at 0.5 percent on a monthly basis,
bringing the full-year increase to 1.4 percent, according to the
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
