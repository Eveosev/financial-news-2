Selcuk Ecza Deposu Ticaret & Sanayi
AS (SELEC) , a Turkish distributor of pharmaceuticals, snapped two days
of gains in Istanbul trading after reporting 2011 profit that
missed estimates.  The shares dropped 2.7 percent to 1.79 liras at the close
in Istanbul.  Selcuk Ecza earned 138.6 million liras ($77.5 million) in
2011, less than the average estimate of 146.1 million liras by
12 analysts on Bloomberg.  Government price cuts on medicines introduced in November
had effects that “came stronger than the forecasts,” and were
the “main reason” for lower earnings in the fourth quarter,
according to a report today by Istanbul-based brokerage Ekpres
Invest.  To contact the reporter on this story:
