Russian Foreign Minister  Sergei Lavrov  warned Western and Arab nations against arming Syrian
rebels, saying this will lead to a prolonged conflict, Interfax
reported.  “It’s clear as daylight that even if you arm the
opposition to the teeth, it won’t defeat the Syrian army, but
there will simply be a war for many, many years, there will be
mutual destruction,” Lavrov said in Baku, Azerbaijan, according
to the Russian news service.  Persian Gulf nations agreed last weekend in Istanbul to
provide funds allowing the Syrian opposition to pay cash to
fighters battling government forces. The decision came during
the second “Friends of  Syria ” conference, where the 83 nations
represented in Istanbul, including the U.S., Arab states and the
European Union, recognized the opposition Syrian National
Council as the leading negotiator for the Syrian people.  Russia  is backing the peace plan promoted by  United Nations 
and Arab League special envoy Kofi Annan, who told the UN
Security Council on April 2 that Syria had agreed by April 10 to
halt troop advances, stop using heavy weapons and withdraw
forces from population centers. Opposition groups say the
fighting has continued unabated since Syria accepted the plan in
principle on March 27. Two Syrian opposition delegations are
expected in Moscow in the coming days, RIA Novosti cited Lavrov
as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
