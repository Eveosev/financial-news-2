Ethanol futures fell for a second
day in  Chicago  on lower corn prices and a government report that
signaled a surplus of the fuel additive.  Futures fell 0.7 percent as corn, the primary ingredient
used to make the biofuel in the U.S., slipped and after the
Energy Department report showed that  stockpiles  of ethanol last
week totaled 22.6 million barrels, 12 percent higher than a year
earlier.  The U.S. is required to use 13.2 billion gallons of ethanol
this year under a 2007 energy law.  Production (DOETFETH)  last week averaged
873,000 barrels a day, the report showed.  Denatured ethanol for April delivery fell 1.5 cents to
$2.266 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade. Prices have
climbed 2.9 percent this year.  In cash market trading, ethanol was unchanged in the U.S.
Gulf at $2.315 a gallon and in  New York  the additive dropped 1.5
cents, or 0.6 percent, to $2.33, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Ethanol on the West Coast increased 3.5 cents, or 1.5
percent, to $2.42 a gallon and in Chicago the biofuel slipped
0.5 cent to $2.26.  The biofuel is blended with gasoline to stretch supply and
meet federal mandates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
