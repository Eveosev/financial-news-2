Denizbank AS (DENIZ) , the Turkish bank owned
by Belgium’s  Dexia SA (DEXB) , rose the most in more than four months
after Chief Executive Officer Hakan Ates was cited by

22, to 14 liras by the close of trading in Istanbul.  The public may see an announcement that “a sale has been
made” at any time, Ates was quoted as saying in an  interview 
published today by the financial website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
