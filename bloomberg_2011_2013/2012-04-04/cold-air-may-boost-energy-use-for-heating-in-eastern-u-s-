A blast of cold air along in the
eastern U.S. may mean energy used for heating homes and
businesses will be 10 to 30 percent above normal through the
weekend, said  David Salmon , owner of Weather Derivatives.  Demand will exceed normal from the Ohio Valley to the East
Coast as cold hangs on from April 5 to April 11, Salmon said.  In his 6- to 10-day outlook, Salmon also predicts
temperatures will drop 6 to 10 degrees Fahrenheit (3.3 to 5.6
Celsius) below normal from Missouri to the East Coast from April
10 to April 14. Lows may be in 30s as far south as Georgia and
Alabama, he said.  Commodities traders watch temperature predictions to gauge
energy use and demand. Natural gas futures gained the past two
days as forecasters predicted colder weather in the Midwest.
About 51 percent of U.S. households use gas for hearing,
according to the Energy Department.  The normal average temperature for April 11 in  New York  is
about 51, according to MDA EarthSat Weather in Gaithersburg,
Maryland. Itâ€™s 47 in Boston, 46 in Chicago, 56 in  St. Louis , 61
in Atlanta, 64 in Dallas, 68 in Houston, 50 in Seattle and 61 in
Burbank,  California .  To contact the reporter on this story:
