U.S. Treasury Secretary  Timothy F. Geithner  said the economy is making progress while tough
challenges lie ahead.  “The balance sheet of the business sector is exceptionally
strong, and the economy as a whole is more productive than
before the crisis,” Geithner said in remarks prepared for
delivery to the Economic Club of Chicago today. “These are
promising developments, but we still face some very tough
challenges.”  Geithner said the challenges to the American economy are
about barriers to economic opportunity, economic security and
political constraints while “ Europe  and oil still present
risks.”  “These challenges can only be addressed by government
action to help speed the recovery and repair the remaining
damage from the crisis and reforms and investments to lay the
foundation for stronger future growth,” Geithner said.  The  Federal Reserve  said it would refrain from increasing
monetary accommodation unless the economic expansion falters or
prices rise at a rate slower than its 2 percent target,
according to minutes of the March 13 policy meeting released
yesterday.  To contact the reporters on this story:
