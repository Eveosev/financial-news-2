Aaron Heilman signed with the  Texas
Rangers , the pitcher’s sixth Major League Baseball organization
since leaving the  New York Mets  after the 2008 season.  Heilman, 33, agreed on a minor-league contract with the
two-time defending American League champions and was assigned to
the Rangers’ AAA-affiliate Round Rock Express, the team said
today in a statement on its website. The right-hander was
released by the  Seattle Mariners  on April 1.  Heilman spent the first six years of his career with the
Mets, first as a starter and later working out of the bullpen.
He pitched for the Chicago Cubs in 2009, and the Arizona
Diamondbacks in 2010 and 2011 before minor-league stints with
the Philadelphia Phillies and Pittsburgh Pirates at the end of
last season, according to the release.  He is 35-46 with 4.40 earned-run average and 16 saves in
nine MLB seasons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
