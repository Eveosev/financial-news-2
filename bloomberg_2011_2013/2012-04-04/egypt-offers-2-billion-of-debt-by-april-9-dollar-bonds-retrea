Egypt  plans to sell 12.5 billion
Egyptian pounds ($2 billion) of treasury securities over the
next week amid investor demand for longer-term notes. The
nationâ€™s dollar bonds dropped.  The North African country will seek bids for 2 billion
pounds of six-month bills and 3.5 billion pounds of 12-month
notes at an auction tomorrow, according to central bank data on
Bloomberg. It will also offer 3.5 billion pounds of nine-month
notes on April 8 and a combined 3.5 billion pounds of three- and
five-year bonds the following day.  Demand for longer-term securities helped the  Finance
Ministry  raise 16 billion pounds from debt sales over the past
week, the best start to a three-month period since protests last
year. The government sold 10-year bonds this week for the first
time since the ouster of President  Hosni Mubarak  in 2011 at an
average yield of 17.03 percent after receiving bids for 1.8
times the 1 billion pounds on offer, central bank data show.  The average debt maturity of domestic debt fell to 1.3
years at the end of 2011 from 1.7 years a year earlier,
according to finance ministry data. The government plans to
raise 18 percent of a targeted 150 billion pounds this quarter
from the sale of notes with maturities of more than one year.  The yield on the 5.75 percent dollar bonds due April 2020
rose one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, 6.605 percent at
12:20 p.m. in Cairo, according to prices compiled by Bloomberg.
The rate is at the highest level since March 12. The Egyptian
pound was little changed at 6.0398 a dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
