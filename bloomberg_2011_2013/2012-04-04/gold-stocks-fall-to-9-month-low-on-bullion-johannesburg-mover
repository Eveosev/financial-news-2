South Africa’s gold mining index
fell the most in more than six months after the metal retreated
for a second day as the dollar strengthened on signs the  Federal
Reserve  may refrain from providing more stimulus for the  U.S.
economy .  The  FTSE/JSE Africa Gold Mining Index (JGOLD)  dropped 4.5 percent,
the most since Sept. 23, to 2298.10, the lowest since July, as
of the 5 p.m. close in Johannesburg.  AngloGold Ashanti Ltd. (ANG) ,
Africa’s biggest producer of the metal, fell 4.2 percent to
269.50 rand, the weakest in more than two years.  Gold Fields
Ltd. (GFI) , the world’s fourth-biggest gold producer, dropped 5
percent to 100.73 rand, the lowest since July 11.  Gold futures for June delivery slumped 2.9 percent to
$1,623.40 an ounce at 10:09 a.m. on the Comex in  New York , the
biggest drop for a most-active contract since March 14. Earlier,
prices plunged to $1,618.80, the lowest since Jan. 10. Bullion
and the greenback tend to move inversely. Gold also declined as
jewelers in India extended a nationwide strike for a 19th day
today to protest a tax on non-branded ornaments.  AngloGold and Gold Fields’ slump pushed them into
“oversold territory,”  Ferdi Heyneke , a trader at Afrifocus
Securities, said by phone today. “On a technical basis it does
look like they are very oversold at the moment, but they are not
getting any momentum on the rallies.”  AngloGold’s 14-day relative strength index, which shows how
rapidly prices advanced or dropped during a specified time
period, reached 20.7 today, the lowest in almost two years. A
reading of 30 or below signals to some investors that shares are
set to increase. Gold Field’s RSI dropped to 24.1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
