GCM Global Energy Plc plans to
invest $100 million this year in building a potash plant in
Belarus, the country’s Council of Ministers  said  today, citing
the Russian company’s owner  Mikhail Gutseriev .  “The company Slavkali has been created, mining allotments
have been received, staff hired, a budget approved, and an
engineering contract signed,” the Council cited Gutseriev as
saying in a posting on its website after the businessman met
Prime Minister Mikhail Myasnikovich today in the capital, Minsk.  Gutseriev’s company has already invested “tens of millions
of dollars” in the venture, with construction scheduled to
begin after all project work is completed in the second half of
2013, the Council cited him as saying.  GCM Global Energy expects to invest a total of $1.5 billion
into the project, the website cited Gutseriev as saying. The
plant will be the country’s second for production of the soil
nutrient and will have a capacity of 1.1 million metric tons a
year, the website posting shows.  To contact the reporter on this story:
