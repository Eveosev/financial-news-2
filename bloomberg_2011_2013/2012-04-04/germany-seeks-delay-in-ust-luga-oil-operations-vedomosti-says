Germany ’s parliament asked Russia to
postpone operations of billionaire Gennady Timchenko’s oil
terminal in Ust Luga on the Baltic Sea because of ecological
concerns,  Vedomosti  reported.  The newspaper cited a letter by Katrin Goering-Eckhardt, a
vice president of the German Bundestag, who represents the  Green
Party , to Russian Prime Minister and President-elect Vladimir Putin. Test loading at the terminal started last month after
engineering problems in November, Vedomosti said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
