The Vale Beijing, an ore carrier
that leaked after its ballast tank cracked while loading its
first cargo in  Brazil  more than four months ago, is going to
 South Korea , where it was built, for inspections.  The ship, one of eight of the world’s biggest dry-bulk
vessels, is expected to arrive at Jinhae, South Korea on April
21, vessel-tracking data on Bloomberg shows. After loading its
first shipment and being repaired, Vale Beijing left Ponta da
Madeira, Brazil on Feb. 19 and delivered the cargo in Oman on
March 28.  Vale Beijing is heading to Jinhae for inspections, STX Pan
Ocean, the vessel’s owner, said today in an e-mailed response to
questions from Bloomberg.  Jinhae, South Korea-based STX Offshore & Shipbuilding Co.
is building another seven ore carriers for STX Pan Ocean,
according to both companies’ websites.  The Vale Beijing’s leak on Dec. 3 was probably related to
the strength of frames used to reinforce the ship’s hull around
the ballast tank and not any general structural problems, Det
Norske Veritas, an Oslo-based classification society, said Jan.
16. The ship was certified as being safe by DNV which monitors
compliance with design and structural rules for vessels.  To contact the reporter on this story:
