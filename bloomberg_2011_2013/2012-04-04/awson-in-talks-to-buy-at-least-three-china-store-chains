Lawson Inc. (2651) , Japan’s second-largest
convenience-store chain, is in talks to buy at least three
operators in  China  in its first overseas acquisition as the
company looks to faster growing markets to increase sales.  “There will be a huge opportunity to acquire businesses in
China,” Chief Executive Officer Takeshi Niinami said in an
interview in  Tokyo  April 3, declining to name any targets. “We
are negotiating with more than three or four parties.”  Niinami is in discussions with an operator of an 800-store
chain and another with 150 in China, to help meet his target of
opening 10,000  outlets  in the country by 2020. Rival chains are
also expanding outside Japan in  Asia , where relatively young
populations are boosting demand for neighborhood stores, as
demand eases in their home market with a  falling population .  “The growth potential for  convenience stores  is far bigger
in China than in Japan,” said  Naoki Fujiwara , who helps oversee
$6 billion at Shinkin Asset Management Co. in Tokyo. “Lawson
seems more aggressive than 7-Eleven as far as expanding in China
and I think it’s possible for them to achieve their target of
10,000 stores.”  Lawson had about 355 outlets in China’s Shanghai, Chongqing
and Dalian cities as of February, according to Shin Ichikawa, a
Lawson spokesman. Seven & I Holdings Co.’s 7-Eleven chain,
Lawson’s bigger Japanese rival, has about 1,792 stores in China
and more than 7,000 in the U.S., according to its website.  Lawson has set aside about $300 million for overseas
acquisitions, Niinami said. The Tokyo-based company had 73.5
billion yen ($894 million) in cash and and near-cash items as of
Nov. 30, 3.7 percent less than a year earlier, according to  data 
compiled by Bloomberg.  ‘Want to Sell’  “There are a lot of domestic players with stores, but they
don’t have the supply chain,” Niinami said, referring to China.
“They don’t know what to do. But they want to sell
eventually.”  FamilyMart Co. (8028) , the third-biggest convenience-store chain
in Japan, has most of its outlets overseas. Chiba, Japan-based
 Ministop Co. (9946)  said last month it will enter Kazakhstan as its
fifth overseas market.  Lawson is scheduled to report earnings on April 12.  Net income  probably fell about 7 percent to 23.5 billion
yen in the 12 months ended Feb. 29 from 25.4 billion yen a year
earlier, according to the company’s own  forecast . Sales rose
about 7 percent to 473 billion yen, based on the estimate.  Lawson declined 1.7 percent to 5,080 yen at the close in
Tokyo trading yesterday, paring its gain this year to 5.7
percent. The stock advanced 20 percent in 2011.  Japan ’s population, on the decline since 2006, is poised to
reach 125.7 million next year, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The nation’s population stood at 126.5 million in
2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
