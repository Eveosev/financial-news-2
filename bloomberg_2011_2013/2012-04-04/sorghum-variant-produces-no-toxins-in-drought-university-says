Danish and Australian researchers
developed a “breakthrough” variety of sorghum that produces no
toxins under protracted drought conditions, the University of
Copenhagen said.  A patent application has been filed, the university  said  on
its website today. Researchers led by Birger Lindberg Moeller,
professor of plant biochemistry at the school, together with
 Australia ’s  Monash University  developed the variant by regular
plant-breeding methods, it said.  Sorghum produces more biomass than corn and better
withstands lengthy periods of drought, according to the
university. Regular sorghum produces toxins in arid conditions,
making the crop unsuitable as livestock feed, it said.  “The fact that the sorghum plant produces large amounts of
the natural cyanogenic glycoside dhurrin when exposed to drought
is a serious problem for farmers,” Lindberg Moeller was cited
as saying. “This is a breakthrough.”  The grain is a dietary staple for more than 500 million
people in 30 nations, according to the  website  of the
International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid
Tropics. Sorghum is one of “the few resilient crops” able to
adapt to  climate change , the site shows.  To contact the reporter on this story:
