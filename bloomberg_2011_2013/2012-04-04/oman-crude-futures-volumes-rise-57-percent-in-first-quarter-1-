The Dubai Mercantile Exchange, which
started trading Oman crude futures in 2007, said average daily
volume for the contract rose 57 percent in the first three
months of this year.  Volumes averaged 4,832 contracts in the first quarter, the
exchange said today in a statement. The average daily volume for
March was 5,136 transactions as a record 112,993 contracts were
traded in the month, it said.  About 12.1 million Brent crude contracts changed hands on
ICE Futures  Europe  in  London  last month, according to its
website. Thatâ€™s an average of 550,000 lots a day, based on 22
trading days last month.  The DME, based in Dubai in the United Arab Emirates, has
been seeking to establish the Oman contract, which gives
investors the option of taking physical deliveries of crude, as
the pricing standard for oil sales to  Asia .  To contact the reporter on this story:
