Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW) , the
world’s largest luxury-auto maker, set a first-quarter sales
record as it builds on gains in emerging markets, the company’s
sales and marketing chief said.  Global sales totaled more than 400,000 for the January-to-
March period, the Munich-based company said today. BMW plans to
release a final tally on April 11. The company yesterday
reported that U.S. deliveries including the Mini brand climbed
17 percent to 75,729 for the quarter.  While major markets such as the U.S., China and Germany are
important, BMW has boosted annual deliveries in the key emerging
markets of Brazil, Russia, India, South Korea and Turkey to more
than 100,000,  Ian Robertson , the sales and marketing executive,
said in interview at the New York auto show. The company is
establishing another tier of 10 target countries, he said.  “We’re very focused on having that balance around the
world,” Robertson said.  BMW expects sales growth throughout the year in the U.S.,
the biggest luxury market, with increases for its best-selling
3 Series line and the introduction of the X1 compact sport-
utility vehicle, Robertson said.  The company’s BMW brand is leading  Daimler AG (DAI) ’s Mercedes-
Benz in U.S. sales by 36 vehicles through March. BMW unseated
 Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) ’s Lexus as the top-selling luxury-auto brand
in the U.S. last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
