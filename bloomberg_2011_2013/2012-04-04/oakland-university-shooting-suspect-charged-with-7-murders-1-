One Goh, the man arrested as a
suspect in the shooting deaths of seven people at Oikos
University in Oakland, was charged with seven counts of murder,
 California  prosecutors said.  Alameda County District Attorney Nancy O’Malley said
yesterday in an e-mailed statement that her office also charged
Goh with three counts of attempted murder.  Seven people were killed and three people were wounded in
the April 2 shooting, which started at about 10:30 a.m. that
morning, according to the statement.  Goh was detained after police received a call from a
Safeway security officer reporting that a man there admitted to
the shooting, according to a statement filed today along with
the charges in state court in Oakland. In an interview with
police, Goh admitted to going to the school with a .45-caliber
handgun and four fully loaded magazines of ammunition.  “He admitted to kidnapping a woman and forcing her from
her office into a class room at gunpoint,” Officer Robert
Trevino said in the statement. “He admitted to shooting and
killing several people inside the classroom, before taking one
of the victim’s car keys and fleeing the scene in the victim’s
car.”  The case is People of the State of California v. One L.
Goh, 2319790, Alameda County Superior Court (Oakland).  To contact the reporter on this story:
