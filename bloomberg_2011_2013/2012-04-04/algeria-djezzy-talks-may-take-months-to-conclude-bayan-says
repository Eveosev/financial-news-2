Algeria’s negotiations to buy the
local unit of  VimpelCom Ltd. (VIP)  may take many months to conclude
because of a price disagreement,  Al Bayan  reported, citing
Algeria’s Finance Minister Karim Djoudi.  There is a “big disparity” between the price the
government is willing to pay and that sought by the seller, the
Dubai-based newspaper cited Djoudi as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
