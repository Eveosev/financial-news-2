Catcher Chris Stewart will rejoin
the  New York Yankees  after being obtained in a trade from the
 San Francisco Giants .  The Yankees said yesterday in an e-mailed release that they
acquired Stewart in exchange for right-handed pitcher George Kontos. After trading for Stewart, New York optioned catcher
 Francisco Cervelli  to the minor leagues.  Stewart, 30, caught 63 games for the Giants last season
after starter Buster Posey was lost for the season with a leg
injury.  Stewart had a catcher’s ERA of 2.70 for the Giants last
season, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, while the
Giants’ CERA when he wasn’t catching was 3.43.  Catcher’s ERA is the earned run average of pitchers when
being caught by a specific catcher. Just as with pitchers’ ERA,
a lower CERA is better.  Stewart, who played in one game for the Yankees in 2008,
also has had stints with the  Chicago White Sox , Texas Rangers
and San Diego Padres during a five-season Major League Baseball
career.  Stewart became expendable when the Giants decided to keep
rookie Hector Sanchez as their backup catcher. The Yankees’
acquisition of Stewart pushed Cervelli, 26, who had been with
New York since 2008, to the minors.  Cervelli found out he was being demoted after hitting a
two-run homer in the Yankees’ 8-3 preseason win yesterday
against the  New York Mets .  “What can I say?” Cervelli told reporters. “It’s not my
decision. I’m disappointed with this.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
