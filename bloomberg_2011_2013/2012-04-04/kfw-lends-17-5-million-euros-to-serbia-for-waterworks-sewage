Kreditanstalt fuer Wiederaufbau,
 Germany ’s development bank, will lend 17.5 million euros ($23
million) to six Serbian cities to improve water supplies and
sewage.  The 12-year loan with three-year grace period has an
interest rate of “slightly more than 3 percent” and
complemented with a 7.5 million euro-grant from the German
government, said Juergen Welschof, KfW representative in  Serbia ,
who signed the arrangement with Serbian officials in Belgrade
today.  Economy Minister Nebojsa Ciric said the state is backing
borrowing for the projects, which are to begin in June.  KfW is preparing another 90 million euros for the same
purpose in another 11 municipalities of the Balkan country,
Welschof said. Germany previously provided 58 million euros to
seven other Serbian cities where such upgrades are almost
completed, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
