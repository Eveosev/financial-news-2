More than 1 million U.S. pay-
television customers dropped subscriptions in 2011, prompted by
a flood of films and TV shows available online at services like
 Netflix Inc. (NFLX) , according to a research  report .  About 2.65 million subscribers to traditional cable or
satellite TV service have canceled since 2008 to rely solely on
Web-based choices, according to the estimate yesterday from
Toronto-based Convergence Consulting Group Ltd. The dropouts
include an estimated 1.05 million in 2011.  “It’s pretty obvious that there’s actual cord-cutting
going on in the U.S.,”  Brahm Eiley , president of Convergence
Consulting, said in an interview.  The pace of defections may slow this year as content owners
tighten online access to shows and prices increase, Eiley said.
The researcher estimates about 930,000 customers will cut the
cord this year, for a total of 3.58 million by the end of 2012.
That equates to about 3.6 percent of subscribers.  Pay-TV services, including traditional cable and satellite
as well as those from telephone companies  Verizon Communications
Inc. (VZ) ’s FiOS and  AT&T Inc. (T) ’s U-verse, will add a net 185,000
accounts this year, up from 112,000 in 2011, Convergence
Consulting estimates.  In  Canada , where online alternatives are fewer and less
robust, an estimated 222,000 TV subscribers were added in 2011,
an amount that will shrink to 180,000 this year.  Netflix ended 2011 with 21.7 million U.S. streaming
subscribers. Programming costs have skyrocketed this year,
Convergence Consulting estimates.  Netflix declined 0.9 percent to $112.96 at the close in  New
York  yesterday. The shares have gained 63 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
