HarvEast, a Ukrainian agricultural
company founded by  Rinat Akhmetov  and Vadim Novinsky, will post
its first profit this year, according to Chief Executive Officer
Simon Cherniavsky.  Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization will climb to at least 100 million hryvnia ($12.5
million) in 2012 from 49 million hryvnia a year earlier,
Cherniavsky told reporters in Kiev today.  The company’s main products are grain and milk. Grain and
oilseed production will probably rise to more than 465,000 tons
from 410,000 tons last year, said Dmytro Skornyakov, first
deputy chief executive officer of HarvEast.  The company will export around 30 percent of its grain
harvest, said Cherniavsky. He added that 30,000 tons of feed
wheat and barley were exported from January through March.  HarvEast plans to invest 160 million hryvnia in machinery
this year to boost grain production and profitability,
Cherniavsky said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
