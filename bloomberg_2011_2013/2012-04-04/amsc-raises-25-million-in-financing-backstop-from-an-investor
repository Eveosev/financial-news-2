  American Superconductor Corp. (AMSC) , a
U.S. maker of wind-turbine components, received a $25 million
investment to fund operations while it pursues lawsuits seeking
more than $1.2 billion in damages from its former largest
customer.  The company sold senior convertible notes and warrants to
an institutional investor that wasn’t identified in a statement
today. Devens, Massachusetts-based AMSC issued $25 million in 7
percent notes at $4.85 a share, 21 percent more than yesterday’s
closing price. The warrants to buy 3.1 million shares may be
exercised at a price of $5.45 until October 2017.  AMSC reported a net  loss  of 186.3 million for the fiscal
year that ended March 31, 2011, after Sinovel Wind Group Co.
refused to accept contracted shipments that month. AMSC has
accused its former customer of stealing its intellectual
property in lawsuits filed in Chinese courts.  The financing provides “an added backstop for our business
as we pursue our growth and diversification strategy,” AMSC
President and Chief Executive Officer Daniel McGahn said in the
statement. McGahn said the company is meeting objectives and
“significantly reducing” cash usage.  AMSC, which  fell  0.1 percent to $3.99 at 10:39 a.m. in  New
York , also has the right to require the investor to purchase as
much as $15 million in additional convertible notes and
warrants.  To contact the reporter on this story:
