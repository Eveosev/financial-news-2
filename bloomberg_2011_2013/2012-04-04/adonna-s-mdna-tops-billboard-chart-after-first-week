Madonna’s “MDNA” sold 359,000
copies in its first week, giving the pop star her eighth No. 1
Billboard 200  debut album  and best retail performance in 12
years, as some concert fans got the album with ticket purchases.  “MDNA” sold 28 percent more copies in its first week than
Madonna’s last album, 2008’s “Hard Candy,” Nielsen SoundScan
said yesterday in an e-mailed statement. Madonna is signed with
 Live Nation Entertainment Inc. (LYV)  and releases her music through
Interscope Records, a unit of  Vivendi SA (VIV) ’s Universal Music.  U.S. buyers of tickets to Madonna’s 66-date worldwide tour
could choose to receive “MDNA” as part of their purchase,
Nielsen SoundScan said. Billboard counts those as sales. Jon Bon Jovi and Tom Petty used similar promotions, leading to No. 1 and
No. 2 debuts, respectively, on the Billboard 200 chart.  “Sales were aided by a successful album-sales promotion
involving Madonna’s upcoming world tour,” said Nielsen
SoundScan, which supplies Billboard’s data.  The tour starts May 29 in  Tel Aviv .  Live Nation, based in Beverly Hills, California, had no
immediate comment. The world’s biggest concert promoter, Live
Nation acquired Ticketmaster, the world’s largest ticket
retailer, in 2010.  Madonna signed an accord with Live Nation in 2007 that
covers new releases, concerts and merchandise. In December, the
artist and Live Nation reached an agreement with Interscope
Records to release “MDNA” and two more albums.  Album sales have climbed 1 percent this year, according to
Nielsen SoundScan. “MDNA” is the biggest debut of 2012, while
Adele’s “21,” released in 2011, sold 730,000 copies the week
after the Grammy awards show in February.  Live Nation fell 1.5 percent to $9.21 yesterday in  New
York . The shares have gained 11 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
