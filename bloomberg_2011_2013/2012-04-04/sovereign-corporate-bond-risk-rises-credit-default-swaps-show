The cost of insuring against default
on European sovereign and corporate debt rose, according to BNP
Paribas SA prices for credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx SovX Western Europe Index of swaps on 15
governments climbed six basis points to 271 at 2:15 p.m. in
London. An increase signals deterioration in perceptions of
 credit quality .  Contracts on the Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 50
companies with mostly high-yield credit ratings rose 22.5 basis
points to 632.5. The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125 companies
with investment-grade ratings was up 5.25 basis points at 129.75
basis points.  The Markit iTraxx Financial Index linked to senior debt of
25 banks and insurers increased 10.5 basis points to 227.5 and
the subordinated index jumped 14 to 371.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($13.2 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer
face value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
