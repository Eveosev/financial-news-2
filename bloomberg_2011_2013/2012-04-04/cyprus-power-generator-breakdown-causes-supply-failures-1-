Cyprus restored most of its power
supply after failures caused by the breakdown of a generator at
a plant on the southeast coast of the island, less than a year
after an explosion knocked out its biggest power station.  The unit at the Dekelia plant failed for unspecified
reasons at 4:45 a.m, Costas Gavrielides, a spokesman for the
Cyprus Electricity Authority, said in a phone interview today.
While EAC had difficulty getting other units online after the
failure, it did not have a capacity problem, he said.  EAC was generating 459 megawatts of electricity at 10:45
a.m. in Nicosia, compared with EAC’s prior forecast of 517
megawatts for that time, the transmission system operator said
on its website.  The country’s power generation dropped to 123 megawatts
when the failure happened, from 311 megawatts at 4:30 a.m.,
according to EAC’s website. Total installed capacity is 963
megawatts.  Only one of six 60-megawatt units was operational at
Dekelia, Gavrielides said earlier today. More power was being
supplied by the Moni station, the country’s oldest plant.  Dekelia is the largest operational power plant in Cyprus
after an explosion at a munitions dump last July knocked out the
767-megawatt Vasilikos plant, which accounted for half the
island’s capacity.  To contact the reporter on this story:
