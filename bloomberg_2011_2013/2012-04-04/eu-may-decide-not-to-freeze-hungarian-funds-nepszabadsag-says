A European Union decision to
partially freeze  Hungary ’s infrastructure-development aid as of
2013 may be taken off the agenda,  Nepszabadsag  said, citing
Laszlo Andor, EU commissioner for employment.  The government “seems to have put in place” measures
needed to bring the budget  deficit  below the level demanded by
the EU, Andor said, according to the Budapest-based daily.  EU officials would rather avoid “a prolonged conflict,”
Andor said, referring to infringement procedures started against
Hungary over laws on the central bank, the judiciary and data
protection, according to the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
