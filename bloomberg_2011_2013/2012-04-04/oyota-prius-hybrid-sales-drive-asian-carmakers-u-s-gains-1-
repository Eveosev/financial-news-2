Toyota Motor Corp. (JDCSTYTA) ’s Prius hybrid
was the third best-selling U.S. car line last month, helping
Asian automakers post a 10 percent sales increase amid improving
consumer demand for new vehicles.  Sales of Prius, now a four-model “family,” climbed 54
percent to a record 28,711 in March, trailing only  Toyota (7203) ’s
Camry sedan and  Nissan Motor Co. (7201) ’s midsize Altima. Total Toyota
deliveries rose 15 percent, Nissan sales increased 13 percent
and  Hyundai Motor Co. (005380)  had a 13 percent gain.  Honda Motor Co. (7267) 
sales fell 5 percent, the only drop among large Asian brands,
based on figures separately released by the carmakers yesterday.  “There’s still some residual demand out there for Prius,
and Toyota now has the volume to meet it,” said Alan Baum,
principal of Baum & Associates, a provider of auto-industry
analysis in West Bloomfield, Michigan. “They’re going to hit
this while demand is strong.”  Job gains and buyers who put off car purchases during the
recession countered a  20 percent  increase in average U.S.
unleaded gasoline prices this year through March. Industrywide
car and truck sales rose 13 percent last month, sending the
industry to the best quarterly pace since 2008.  “When gasoline prices are high, what makes carmakers
competitive is whether they have a fuel-efficient car like the
Prius,”  Kohei Takahashi , a Tokyo-based auto analyst at JPMorgan
Chase & Co., said by telephone today. “The trend is to
downsize, too, which makes the Prius even more competitive.”  Shares Climb  Toyota rose 0.8 percent to 3,585 yen as of 10:03 a.m. in
Tokyo trading, Nissan declined 0.3 percent to 897 yen, and Honda
dropped 0.3 percent to 3,190 yen. Hyundai rose 2 percent to
260,000 won in Seoul trading.  “In the  United States , consumers are replacing aging cars
and volumes are likely to increase to 14 million or 14.5 million
units this year,”  Carlos Ghosn , chief executive officer of
Nissan and  Renault SA (RNO) , said yesterday at an automotive forum in
New York.  U.S. deliveries accelerated to a 14.4 million seasonally
adjusted annual rate from 13.1 million a year earlier, according
to researcher Autodata Corp. U.S. automakers  General Motors Co. (GM) ,
 Ford Motor Co. (F)  and Chrysler Group LLC reported respective
increases of 12 percent, 5 percent and 34 percent.  Japanese and South Korean automakers sold 668,385 vehicles
last month, up from 604,943 a year ago, to give a market share
of 47.6 percent, according to Autodata.  Higher Projections  Analysts at Morgan Stanley, Deutsche Bank AG, Citigroup
Inc. and TrueCar.com last month increased their estimates for
full-year sales by an average of 550,000 vehicles to 14.5
million. IHS Automotive said yesterday it estimates 14.2 million
light-vehicle deliveries in the U.S. this year, up from a
previous estimate of 14 million.  Toyota,  Asia ’s largest automaker, sold 203,282 Toyota,
Lexus and Scion vehicles in March, its highest U.S. volume since
2008. The percentage increase for the Toyota City, Japan-based
company matched an expected 15 percent gain for the month, the
average of seven analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News.  Camry, the top-selling U.S. car for the past 10 years, had
a 35 percent jump in deliveries to 42,567, Toyota said. Sales of
the model grew in part because of higher fleet business during
the month than average, Jeff Bracken, vice president of U.S.
Toyota brand sales, said on a conference call yesterday.  Above Average  Toyota’s fleet sales were 13.7 percent of its total in
March and may remain at that level in April, higher than an
average monthly rate of about 10 percent, he said.  The elevated fleet sales rate in the first quarter is the
result of Toyota fulfilling orders to rental-car companies it
couldn’t meet last year after  Japan ’s earthquake and tsunami cut
vehicle production, Bracken said.  Toyota’s U.S. market share rose to 14.5 percent in March
from 14.1 percent a year earlier, according to  Woodcliff Lake ,
New Jersey-based Autodata.  Honda (7267) ’s sales decline in March missed an estimate for a 5.3
percent increase for the Tokyo-based company, the average of
seven analysts’ forecasts. Combined sales of Honda- and Acura-
brand autos were 126,999, down from 133,650 a year ago.  Deliveries of the Accord model, Honda’s biggest-volume U.S.
vehicle, fell 15 percent, ranking it eighth among the market’s
top-selling cars last month. Honda’s market share in the U.S.
shrank to 9 percent in March from 10.7 percent a year ago.  Bright Spot  The CR-V compact sport-utility vehicle was the bright spot
for the carmaker, rising 40 percent to a record 30,868 units.  “Sometimes when a company has lost its footing, it takes a
while to get its mojo back,”  Jeremy Anwyl , vice chairman of
researcher Edmunds.com, said in an interview in  New York 
yesterday. “Sometimes the old formula doesn’t work for you
anymore and you’ve got to find a new one.”  Nissan and Infiniti brand sales rose 13 percent to a record
136,317, exceeding the average of seven analysts’ estimates for
an 11 percent gain. Yokohama-based Nissan outsold Honda, which
it’s seeking to top in U.S. deliveries on an annual basis for
the first time since 1987. The gain was led by Altima sales,
which surged 27 percent to 41,050.  Nissan’s market share was 9.7 percent in March, unchanged
from a year ago, according to Autodata.  “Nissan should increase sales by at least 14 percent to
1.2 million units in the U.S.” in 2012, Ghosn said. Nissan’s
global sales will rise 12 percent this year to 5.4 million
vehicles, giving the company a global market share of 6.8
percent, he said.  Japan’s Earthquake  While Honda and Toyota slowed output at North American
plants for months after Japan’s earthquake in March last year,
Nissan restarted full production in the region within weeks.  Hyundai and affiliate  Kia Motors Corp. (000270) , South Korea’s two
largest automakers, each said U.S. sales in March were at record
highs of 69,728 and 57,505 units, respectively.  Combined sales of the partner companies, which operate
separately, rose 20 percent last month to 127,233 cars and light
trucks. That exceeded an expected 18 percent increase, the
average of seven analysts’ estimates.  Subaru, the auto brand of Fuji Heavy Industries, said its
sales rose 20 percent, and  Mazda Motor Corp. (7261) ’s increased 4.8
percent. Japan’s  Mitsubishi Motors Corp. (7211)  reported a 5.3 percent
decline and  Suzuki Motor Corp. (7269) ’s sales gained 5.4 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
