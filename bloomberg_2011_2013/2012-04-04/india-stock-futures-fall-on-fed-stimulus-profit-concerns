Indian stocks dropped for the first
time in four days after Federal Reserve minutes showed central
bankers saw no need for more U.S. stimulus, and on concern
quarterly earnings at Indian companies may slow.  State Bank of India , the nation’s biggest lender, declined
1.2 percent.  Larsen & Toubro Ltd. (LT) , the largest engineering
company, retreated 1.3 percent.  The BSE India  Sensitive Index (SENSEX) , or Sensex, retreated 0.5
percent to 17,509.47 at 9:23 a.m. in Mumbai. The 30-stock gauge
is up 13 percent this year. The markets are closed tomorrow and
April 6 for public holidays.  Minutes released yesterday from the March 13 Fed policy
meeting showed it was holding off on increasing monetary
accommodation unless economic growth faltered or prices rose at
a rate slower than its 2 percent target. India’s economy has
slowed for four straight quarters and output has decelerated as
Europe’s debt crisis curbs demand for Asian exports, threatening
profit growth. A total of 47 percent of Sensex companies missed
earnings forecasts in the December quarter, compared with 40
percent three months earlier.  “On the western side of the planet, in the U.S. and to
some extent in  Latin America , you find that earnings are doing
much better than they are in places like Asia, and India in
particular,”  Arjuna Mahendran , the Singapore-based head of Asia
investment strategy at HSBC Private Bank, which oversees about
$499 billion, said in a Bloomberg UTV interview yesterday.  The Sensex has risen 14 percent this year as foreign funds
have  bought  a net $9.1 billion of domestic shares, a record for
the period, even as company-profit growth slows,  interest rates 
remain at a three-year high, oil prices jump and the government
struggles to tackle a widening fiscal gap.  The 30-stock measure trades at 13.5 times future earnings,
 compared with  the MSCI Emerging Markets Index’s 10.7 times.  The S&P CNX  Nifty (NIFTY)  Index on the National Stock Exchange of
India Ltd. decreased 0.7 percent to 5,355.30. The  BSE 200 Index (BSE200) 
fell 0.4 percent to 2,180.37.  Foreigners bought a net 13 billion rupees ($254 million) of
local stocks on March 30 and April 2, raising their investment
this year to 452.5 billion rupees, according to the nation’s
market regulator.  To contact the reporter on this story:
