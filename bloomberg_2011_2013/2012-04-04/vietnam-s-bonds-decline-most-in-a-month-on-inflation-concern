Vietnam ’s bonds fell the most in
more than a month on concern inflation will accelerate after the
nation raised fuel prices last month. The dong was steady.  Vietnam increased prices of petroleum products, including
gasoline, by as much as 12 percent on March 7. The nation’s
consumer-price index rose 14.15 percent last month from a year
earlier, the least in a year, official data showed March 24.  “Investors still worry that the fuel price increases will
fan inflation this month as March CPI figures may not have fully
reflected those,” said Tran Kieu Hung, a Hanoi-based bond
trader at Bank for Investment & Development of Vietnam.  The  yield  on benchmark five-year notes rose five basis
points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 11.51 percent, according to
a daily fixing from banks compiled by Bloomberg. That’s the
biggest increase since Feb. 23.  The dong traded little changed at 20,828 per dollar as of
3:27 p.m. in Hanoi, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
central bank set the daily reference rate at 20,828, unchanged
since Dec. 26, its website showed. The currency is allowed to
trade up to 1 percent on either side of the rate.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
