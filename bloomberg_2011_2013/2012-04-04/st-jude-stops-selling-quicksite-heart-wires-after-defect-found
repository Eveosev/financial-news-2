St. Jude Medical Inc. (STJ)  will stop
selling the QuickSite and QuickFlex left-ventricular leads,
wires that help pace the heart in patients with heart failure,
after 39 reports of the wires protruding from their insulation.  No one has been harmed by the defect, first seen in wires 
removed from patients because of infection or other unrelated 
issues, said Mark Carlson, chief medical officer of  St. Paul , 
Minnesota-based St. Jude. The flawed wires were covered by 
another layer of insulation and worked properly, he said in a 
telephone interview.  St. Jude has been grappling with the same problem in its
recalled Riata wires that connect life-saving defibrillators to
the heart. All three products have been supplanted by newer 
wires from St. Jude that are coated with Optim insulation.  “Even when the outer insulation, the silicone itself, is
breached, the other insulation has been intact,” according to
Carlson, who said the company was sending a letter to doctors
about the finding and removing the leads from the market as a
proactive measure.  The company confirmed 39 cases out of 171,000 leads sold, a
rate of 0.023 percent. Based on imaging of leads still in use
and an analysis of the returned leads, the company estimated
that 3 percent to 4 percent of QuickSite and QuickFlex leads may
have the flaw. The risk is underreported among patients since
there is no damage, signs or symptoms that call the issue to
doctors’ and patients’ attention.  To contact the reporter on this story:
