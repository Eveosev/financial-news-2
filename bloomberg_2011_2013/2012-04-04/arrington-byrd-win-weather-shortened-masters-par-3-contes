Padraig Harrington  and Jonathan Byrd
were declared co-champions of the Masters Tournamentâ€™s annual
par-3 contest, which was suspended because of dangerous weather
conditions, including lightning.  Harrington and Byrd finished tied with a score of 5-under-
par over nine holes on the short course at Augusta National Golf
Club in Augusta, Georgia. There were 35 golfers yet to finish in
the field of 78 when play was suspended.  No player has gone on to win the Masters after a victory in
the par-3 contest, which began in 1960. The only other time
there were dual winners was 2003.  Adam Scott  finished 4-under par, while Webb Simpson and
Jerry Pate were on the course and one behind the leaders when
play was halted because of thunderstorms in the area.  Phil Mickelson  finished 3-under par.  To contact the reporter on this story:
