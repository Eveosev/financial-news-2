Safaricom Ltd. (SAFCOM) ,  Kenya ’s biggest
mobile-phone network operator, gained for the first time in six
days on speculation the company will maintain its dividend at
the same level as last year.  The stock climbed as much as 3.2 percent and traded 1.6
percent higher to 3.2 shillings by 1:55 p.m. Nairobi.  “People are speculating on getting the same level of
dividend as last year,” Renaldo d’Souza, a research analyst
with Genghis Capital Ltd., said in a phone interview today.  Safaricom’s financial year ended March 31 and second-half
earnings are expected to grow after it increased calling rates
in October, d’Souza said. Growth in second half-profit will not
be sufficient to avoid a decline in full-year earnings, he said.  The  dividend  payout ratio for the year ending March 2011
was increased to 61 percent from 53 percent a year earlier,
according to Safaricom’s website. The total spent on dividends
last year was 8 billion shillings ($96 million), steady from
2010.  First-half profit through September fell 47 percent as
costs increased and after the company revalued its foreign debt
following the Kenyan shilling’s plunge against the dollar,
Safaricom said Nov. 9.  To contact the reporter on this story:
