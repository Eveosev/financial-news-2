The government will probably lower
its estimates for the recent U.S. cotton crop and unsold
supplies at the end of the marketing year, according to a survey
of six analysts by Bloomberg News. The forecast for exports in
the year ending July 31 will be raised, most analysts said.  The estimates are listed below in millions of bales, each
weighing 480 pounds, or 218 kilograms. The  U.S. Department of
Agriculture  will update its outlook on April 10 at 8:30 a.m. in
 Washington . The U.S. is the worldâ€™s biggest exporter of the
fiber.  To contact the reporter on this story:
