Kuzbass Fuel Co. (KBTK) , a Russian producer
of coal for power stations, rose to the highest in a week after
reporting a 73 percent jump in fourth-quarter profit.  Shares rose 4.1 percent to 177 rubles at 12:34 p.m. in
Moscow, the highest intraday level since March 28.  Net income advanced to 776 million rubles ($26 million) on
higher coal prices and sales, the Kemerovo-based company said in
a statement today. The company increased coal output 29 percent
last year to 8.74 million metric tons and became Russiaâ€™s fifth-
largest coal exporter.  Kuzbass Fuel plans to build a new coal-washing plant with
capacity of 4 million metric tons a year by the end of 2012,
Chief Executive Officer Igor Prokudin said in the statement. It
also arranged a 10-year, 10 billion-ruble  credit line  at OAO
Gazprombank to buy railcars for coal shipments, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
