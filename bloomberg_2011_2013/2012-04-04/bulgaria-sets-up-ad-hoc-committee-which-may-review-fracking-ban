Bulgariaâ€™s parliament set up an ad-
hoc committee to look at how other countries regulate the
exploration of  mineral resources , which may lead to a review of
a ban on hydraulic fracturing imposed in January.  The 13-member panel has two months to study the practices
of other European Union states on how they regulate oil and gas
exploration, including fracking, and present their conclusions
to lawmakers, Deputy Energy and Economy Minister Valentin
Nikolov told reporters in Sofia today.  Bulgaria is the second country in the EU after  France  to
ban hydraulic fracturing of shale rocks, a process using a
mixture of water, sand and chemicals to open fissures in shale
rocks and release gas and oil.  The government withdrew an exploration license from  Chevron
Corp. (CVX)  in January after protests and criticism from environmental
groups concerned about potential water contamination from the
process.  The Bulgarian ban imposed a pressure limit that hinders
conventional fuel exploration and prevents the country from
diversifying its energy sources, Nikolov said.  Bulgaria relies on imports from  Russia  for all of its
natural-gas needs. The Balkan country may hold as much as 300
billion to 1 trillion cubic meters of shale gas, according to
Energy & Economy Ministry estimates. It consumes about 4 billion
cubic meters of gas a year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
