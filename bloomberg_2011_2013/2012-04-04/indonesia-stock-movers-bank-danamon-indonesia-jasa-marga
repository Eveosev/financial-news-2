Shares of the following companies
had  unusual  moves in  Indonesian trading . Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of the close in Jakarta.  The  Jakarta Composite Index (JCI)  fell 1.9 percent to 4,134.04,
its first decline in seven days and the biggest since Nov. 21.  PT Astra International (ASII)  ,  Indonesia ’s largest
automotive retailer, fell 3.6 percent to 74,000 rupiah, the
sharpest drop since Feb. 24. Investors “took profit” in shares
such as Astra after the market’s six-day rally, said Chandra
Pasaribu, head of equity research at PT Danareksa Sekuritas in
Jakarta. Astra advanced 7.3 percent in a four-day rally from
March 29 through yesterday.  PT Jasa Marga (JSMR)  , Indonesia’s biggest tollroad
operator, fell 3.4 percent to 4,925 rupiah, the biggest loss
since Oct. 3. Jasa Marga plans to sell its remaining 81.6
million shares in rival  PT Citra Marga Nusaphala Persada (CMNP) , the
company said, without providing a timeframe. The sale will
reduce Jasa Marga’s revenue from Citra Marga sales, leading to
“negative sentiment,” PT Recapital Securities wrote in a note
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
