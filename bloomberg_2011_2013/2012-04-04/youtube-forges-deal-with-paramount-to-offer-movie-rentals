Google Inc. (GOOG) ’s YouTube announced a
deal to offer online movie rentals from  Viacom Inc. (VIAB) ’s Paramount
Pictures, adding a fifth major studio partner to the video-
sharing site’s lineup.  Paramount will begin providing almost 500 titles to YouTube
and Google Play, which delivers content to Android devices,
YouTube said today in  a blog post . The new movies, which include
“Ferris Bueller’s Day Off,” “Transformers” and “The Godfather”
trilogy, will be available in the next few weeks in the U.S. and
Canada, typically priced at $2.99 to $3.99 for a 48-hour rental.  The move may represent a thawing of relations between
YouTube and Viacom, which sued the site in 2007 for copyright
infringement. Since then, YouTube has expanded beyond free
upload-it-yourself videos into rentals of professional content.
Google is counting on richer programming to compete with  Apple
Inc. (AAPL) , Amazon.com Inc. and  Netflix Inc. (NFLX) , three of the top
providers of digital entertainment.  “It’s still early days for us,” Malik Ducard, director of
content partnerships at YouTube, said in the post. “We’ll
continue adding new titles and expanding our service to more
countries this year.”  Google’s stock  fell 1.2 percent to $635.15 at the close in
New York. Shares of the Mountain View, California-based company
have declined 1.7 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
