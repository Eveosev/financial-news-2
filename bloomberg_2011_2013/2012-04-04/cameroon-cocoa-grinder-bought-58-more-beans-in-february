Cocoa purchases by a major bean
grinder in Cameroon rose 58 percent in February, the seventh
month of the 2011-12 season, the Cocoa and Coffee Board and the
Cocoa and Coffee Interprofessional Board said in a joint report.  Sic-Cacao bought 668 metric tons of beans, compared with
424 tons a year earlier, the institutions said in an e-mail from
the port city of Douala today. Chococam, another main buyer,
bought no beans, according to the report.  The two grinders have bought 27,665 tons since the season
started on Aug. 1. Cameroon is  Africa â€™s fourth-largest producer
of the crop after  Ivory Coast , Ghana and Nigeria.  To contact the reporter on this story:
