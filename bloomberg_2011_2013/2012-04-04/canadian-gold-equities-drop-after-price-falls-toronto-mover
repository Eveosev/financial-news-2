Canadian gold stocks fell to a 2-
year low after bullion declined for a second consecutive day, as
the dollar strengthened on signs the  Federal Reserve  may refrain
from increasing monetary stimulus.  The  S&P/TSX Global Gold Index (SPTSGD)  fell 3.6 percent to 315.79 at
4:20 p.m. in Toronto, the lowest since March 31, 2010.  Barrick
Gold Corp. (ABX) , the world’s largest gold producer, declined 3.2
percent to C$41.16, and Vancouver-based  Goldcorp Inc. (G) , the
second-biggest gold miner by market value, fell 5 percent to
C$40.98.  Gold futures for June delivery fell 3.5 percent on the
Comex in  New York  to $1,614.10 an ounce. .  “The interpretation of the comments from the Fed yesterday
that quantitative easing is not in the near term plans for the
Federal Reserve in the United States has really been very much a
driver for the gold price, and for the equities as well,” Paul Burchell, a Toronto-based analyst at Dundee Securities Corp.,
said in a telephone interview.  “We are seeing a movement of capital away from materials
largely because of that statement.”  Lower  gold prices  will put pressure on gold producers’ cash
flows, Pawel Rajszel, a Toronto-based analyst at Veritas
Investment Research Corp, said in a telephone interview.  “The problem is that as the gold price falls, the
producers’ costs are still going up, so those margins are
getting squeezed on both ends.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
