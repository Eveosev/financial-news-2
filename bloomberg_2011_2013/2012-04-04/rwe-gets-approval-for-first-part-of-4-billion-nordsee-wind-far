RWE AG (RWE) , Germany’s second-largest
utility, won permission to begin building the first phase of
what may become the country’s biggest wind farm at sea.  German authorities approved the 330-megawatt Nordsee 1 wind
farm, Essen-based RWE said today in a  statement . It also expects
to get permits for the two other sections, Nordsee 2 and Nordsee
3. RWE hasn’t made a final decision on investing in the project
because of delays with connecting offshore farms to the grid, it
said, adding that work may potentially begin in 2014.  Once completed, the 3 billion-euro ($4 billion) project
will have 162 turbines with a total 1,000-megawatt capacity.  The permit “is an important milestone for us which we have
been pursuing for about three years,” said Fritz Vahrenholt,
chief executive officer of RWE renewables unit Innogy.  RWE plans to invest about 5 billion euros on renewable
energy, mainly offshore wind farms, in four years as  Germany 
shuts nuclear reactors after last year’s Fukushima disaster.  To contact the reporter on this story:
