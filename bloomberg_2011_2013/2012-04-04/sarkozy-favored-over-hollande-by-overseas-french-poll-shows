President  Nicolas Sarkozy  is likely
to win the French expatriate vote over Socialist challenger
 Francois Hollande , though by a narrower margin than in 2007, a
poll showed.  French living overseas, of whom 1 million are registered
voters, would back Sarkozy over Hollande by 51 percent to 49
percent in the expected May 6 run-off between the two
candidates, according to the survey by OpinionWay-Fiducial.  In 2007, Sarkozy won the overseas vote by 55-45 over
Socialist Segolene Royal.  All polls taken in France have shown Hollande leading
Sarkozy in the second and decisive round, generally by about
eight percentage points.  Among overseas voters, Sarkozy leads Hollande for the April
22 first round by 37 percent to 27 percent, with centrist
candidate  Francois Bayrou  third on 13 percent. Under the French
system, the top two vote-getters go into a run-off.  The survey, for online newspaper lepetitjournal.com and
TV5Monde, was carried out March 12-23 among a sample of 2,031
people interviewed via the Internet. The margin of error is 1-2
percentage points.  A separate Opinionway poll of foreign decision makers in
 France  showed that 52 percent think that Hollande will be the
next president. The poll, for consultants Apco Worldwide and
online newspaper EurActiv.fr, questioned 182 diplomats, foreign
correspondents and chief executives of foreign companies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
