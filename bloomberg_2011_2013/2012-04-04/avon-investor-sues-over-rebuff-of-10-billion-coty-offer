An  Avon Products Inc. (AVP)  investor sued
the company over its rejection of a $10 billion takeover offer
by Coty Inc.  Jeffrey Feinman contends Avon directors violated their
duties to enhance  shareholder value  in rejecting the bid, which
represents a recent average premium of about 20 percent.  The board members’ “utter refusal to engage in
negotiations or any substantive dialogue with Coty” has
“deprived Avon’s shareholders of substantial value,” Feinman’s
lawyers said today in a New York state court complaint.  Coty “approached Avon” April 2 with the offer, at $23.25
a share in cash, and the target company “flatly rejected” the
proposal “within an hour,” according to the complaint.  Both cosmetics companies are based in  New York .  Feinman asked that the case be given class-action or group
status on behalf of all outside shareholders, that directors be
ordered to negotiate in good faith, and that a judge award
unspecified damages.  Jennifer Dwyer Vargas, a spokeswoman for Avon, said the
company doesn’t comment on litigation.  Shares of Avon rose 56 cents or 2.5 percent to $22.75 at
4:15 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.  The case is Feinman v. Avon Products Inc., 651087/2012, New
York State Supreme Court, New York County (Manhattan).  To contact the reporters on this story:
