Japanese  stocks  plunged, with the
 Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average dropping the most in five months and
closing below 10,000 for the first time since March 13, as the
U.S. Federal Reserve signaled it may not offer more stimulus and
Fast Retailing Co. slid.  Sony Corp., Japan’s biggest exporter of consumer
electronics, fell 2.9 percent.  Softbank Corp. (9984)  lost 2 percent
after saying a storm disrupted its phone and e-mail services for
customers in Northern Japan. Fast Retailing, Asia’s biggest
clothing retailer, sank 5.7 percent after Credit Suisse Group AG
said sales at its Uniqlo stores failed to recover from the March
11 earthquake last year.  The Nikkei 225 fell 2.3 percent to 9,819.99 at the 3 p.m.
close in  Tokyo , with losses accelerating after the gauge slipped
below the key level of 10,000 during the morning trading session.
All except 11 stocks on the gauge closed lower. Volume was about
8 percent below the 30-day average. The broader Topix  Index (VNKY) 
retreated 1.8 percent to 835.36.  “Today the big question was whether the Nikkei would be
able to hold above 10,000,” said Kenichi Hirano, general
manager and strategist at Tachibana Securities Co. in Tokyo.
“Once the market fell below that level, investors started to
sell. Negative signals on monetary easing also weighed on
stocks.”  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPXL1)  slid 0.4 percent
today. The gauge fell 0.4 percent in  New York  yesterday as the
Federal Reserve said it’s holding off on increasing monetary
accommodation and U.S. factory orders climbed less than expected
in February.  Exporters Decline  Sony dropped 2.9 percent to 1,657 yen.  Canon Inc. (7751) , a camera
maker that gets almost 30 percent of its sales from the Americas,
lost 1.9 percent to 3,900 yen.  Honda Motor Co. (7267)  Japan’s second biggest carmaker by market
value, dropped 3.1 percent to 3,100 yen after a report its U.S.
sales fell 5 percent in March, compared with estimates for a 5
percent gain.  Fast Retailing dropped 5.7 percent to 17,800 yen after
Credit Suisse said the clothier’s 5.1 percent rise in domestic
same-stores sales last month failed to recover from last year’s
earthquake. The Yamaguchi-based retailer is the most heavily
weighted stock on the Nikkei 225.  “As Fast Retailing shares slid further, there was concern
it would take the Nikkei down another notch by triggering
selling in futures,” said  Mitsushige Akino , who oversees about
$600 million at Ichiyoshi Investment Management Co. in Tokyo.  Softbank, Japan’s third-largest mobile phone company by
sales, lost 2 percent to 2,349 yen after saying users in
Northern Japan are unable to make calls or send e-mails after
widespread storms caused power blackouts.  Asahi Rises  Among shares that gained today,  Asahi Group Holdings Ltd. (2502) 
rallied 2 percent to 1,832 yen, the brewer’s biggest gain in
four months. Shares advanced after  Molson Coors Brewing Co. (TAP) 
yesterday agreed to purchase a European beverage company that
Asahi was reportedly close to buying.  Credit Suisse said Asahi’s withdrawal from the bidding on
Starbev removed concern about the deal’s impact on its earnings.
The investment bank maintained its “outperform” rating on the
Japanese brewer and said it expects the shares will rise to
2,200 yen in the next 12 months.  The Nikkei Stock Average Volatility Index, a measure of
Japanese option prices, leapt 6.9 percent to 20.23 today,
suggesting a possible 5.8 percent swing in the Nikkei 225 in the
next 30 days.  To contact the reporters on this story:
