French soil-water reserves fell
across the country in March on warmer-than-usual temperatures
and below-normal rain, the  Agriculture Ministry  reported.  March was on average 2.3 degrees Celsius (4.1 degrees
Fahrenheit) warmer than normal for the month, while rainfall was
57 percent less than the long-term average, the ministry wrote
in  report  on its website today.  France  on average has received 28 percent less rain since
Sept. 1 than normal, according to the ministry. Soil-water
reserves are “especially low” in the Paris region, the Alsace,
parts of the southwest and Corsica, the report showed.  “After a February that was already particularly dry, all
of the country, with the exception of the northernmost tip, has
a rainfall deficit,” the ministry wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
