Mexico ’s peso dropped for a second
day as an increase in  Spain ’s borrowing costs at an auction
intensified European debt concern, overshadowing job gains in
the U.S., the Latin American country’s biggest trading partner.  “It’s the fear factor from  Europe , which is outplaying
what are essentially a decent set of U.S. numbers from Mexico’s
perspective,”  Mike Moran , a currency strategist at Standard
Chartered Bank, said by phone from New York. “Investors are
looking at the long weekend as an opportunity to reduce risk.”  The peso depreciated 0.4 percent to 12.8184 per dollar at
12:46 p.m. in Mexico City, from 12.7632 yesterday. Local markets
in Mexico will be closed tomorrow and April 6 ahead of the
Easter holiday.  The  Mexican peso  has rallied 8.7 percent this year in the
best performance among the 16 most-traded currencies tracked by
Bloomberg on improved economic prospects for the U.S., the
destination for 80 percent of Mexico’s exports.  America’s companies increased payrolls in March by 209,000
after a revised gain of 230,000 in the previous month, figures
from ADP Employer Services showed today. The median estimate
among analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News was for an increase of
206,000 last month.  The U.S. jobs data came in “slightly better than
forecast,” helping the peso pare losses fueled by the Fed
yesterday, according to Pepe Curiel, a currency trader at
Intercam Casa de Bolsa SA in Mexico City.  Fed Stance  The peso declined 0.2 percent yesterday after minutes of
the  Federal Reserve ’s March 13 policy meeting indicated the
central bank didn’t see a need for more monetary stimulus unless
growth slows, sapping demand for higher-yielding assets.  Spain sold 2.6 billion euros ($3.4 billion) of bonds today,
just above the minimum target, and borrowing costs rose in its
first auction since the country said public debt will surge to a
record this year. The Treasury had set a range of 2.5 billion
euros to 3.5 billion euros for the sale.  Concern that Europe’s debt crisis would drag on Mexican
exports helped make the peso  Latin America ’s worst-performing
currency in 2011.  The yield on Mexico’s peso-denominated debt due in 2024
rose one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 6.46 percent,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The price dropped 0.14
centavo to 130.52 centavos per peso.  To contact the reporter on this story:
