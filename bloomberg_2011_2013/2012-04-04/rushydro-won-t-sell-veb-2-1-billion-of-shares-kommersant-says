OAO RusHydro,  Russia ’s biggest
hydropower generator, scrapped a plan to sell 63 billion rubles
($2.1 billion) of its treasury shares to state-run
Vnesheconombank,  Kommersant  reported today.  The bank, of which  Vladimir Putin  is chairman and which is
also known as VEB, was scheduled to approve the purchase this
week to help RusHydro fund new power stations after the
government curbed tariff growth, the newspaper said. Deputy
Prime Minister  Igor Sechin  urged indefinite postponement of the
plan, Kommersant said, citing unidentified people.  RusHydro may use funds from state-run OAO Sberbank instead
and has cut two power stations from its investment program, the
newspaper said, citing RusHydro.  To contact the reporter on this story:
