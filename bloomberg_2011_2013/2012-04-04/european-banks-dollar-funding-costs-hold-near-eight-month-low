The cost for European banks to
borrow in dollars held near the lowest in eight months,
according to a money-markets indicator.  The three-month cross-currency  basis swap , the rate banks
pay to convert euro interest payments into dollars, was 51 basis
points below the euro interbank offered rate at 12:30 p.m. in
London, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The measure reached
minus 49.5 on March 26, the cheapest cost since Aug. 1.  The one-year basis swap was little changed at 45 basis
points less than Euribor. The cost of the  currency swap  has
declined from 98.5 basis points below the benchmark at the end
of 2011. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  The Euribor-OIS spread, the difference between the
borrowing benchmark and overnight indexed swaps, was little
changed at 41 basis points, the lowest since Aug. 1. The measure
of banks’ reluctance to lend to one another has declined from 95
basis points at the start of the year.  Lenders increased  overnight deposits  at the  European
Central Bank  for the second day yesterday, placing 786 billion
euros ($1 trillion) with the Frankfurt-based bank, up from 783
billion euros on April 2.  Three-month Euribor, the rate banks say they pay for three-
month loans in euros, fell to 0.768 percent from 0.77 percent.
One-week Euribor was unchanged at 0.317 percent.  The London interbank offered rate, or Libor, for three-
month dollar loans was unchanged at 0.469 percent.  Three-month dollar Euribor, a gauge of dollar funding costs
started by the Brussels-based European Banking Federation on
April 2, rose to 0.957 percent from 0.956 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
