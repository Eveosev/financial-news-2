The wife of ousted Tunisian
President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali has finished writing her
memoir which is expected to be published in May, Tunisian
newspaper Al Maghreb reported today.  Titled “Ma Verite,” or “My Truth,” Leila Trabelsi’s
book will be published by a French publishing house and will
respond to accusations made against her and her family, the
newspaper said.  Trabelsi fled to  Saudi Arabia  with her husband who was
forced out of power last year. Tunisia’s uprising ushered in the
so-called Arab Spring which has ended the rule of leaders in
Egypt, Libya and Yemen. Trabelsi was sentenced on June 20 in
absentia to 35 years in prison on charges of corruption.  Trabelsi and members of her family are alleged by opponents
to have controlled much of the country’s economy through
holdings including an airline, hotels and real estate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
