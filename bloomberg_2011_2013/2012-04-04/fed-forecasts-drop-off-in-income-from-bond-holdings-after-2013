The  Federal Reserve Bank of New York 
said that net income from its bond portfolio is likely to
“remain near its recent levels” this year and next, and then
decline to 2016 as monetary policy returns to normal levels.  “Income is expected to decline notably from current
elevated levels as the outlook for the economy and monetary
policy normalizes,” according to the System Open Market
Account, often referred to as SOMA,  annual report  posted on the
New York Fed’s website today.  The Fed paid $75.4 billion to the  U.S. Treasury  for 2011 as
its expanded bond portfolio generated interest income, according
to financial statements released by the central bank on March
20. The SOMA portfolio had net income of $83 billion in 2011,
the New York Fed said. That may fall to less than $60 billion in
2014 and about $30 billion in 2016 under the baseline scenario,
the report said.  The projections were based on assumptions from private-
sector forecasts, including the beginning of interest rate
increases “towards the end of 2013,” the annual report said.
Rates would climb to about 4 percent by the first quarter of
2018, and the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note would
increase to almost 5 percent by the first quarter of 2017 under
the scenario, the report said.  The forecasts assume SOMA holdings would remain at about
$2.6 trillion until mid-2013, and then “fall steadily” during
about the next four years through redemptions and asset sales,
the report said. That would bring the balance sheet “to a
normalized size” by early 2017, and by mid-2019 the holdings
would be only Treasuries, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
