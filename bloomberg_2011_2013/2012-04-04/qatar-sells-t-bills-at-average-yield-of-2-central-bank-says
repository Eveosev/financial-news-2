Qatar is offering the highest yields
in the Gulf Cooperation Council on treasury bills as the nation
hosting the 2022 soccer  World Cup  seeks to deepen its  debt
market .  The Qatar Central Bank paid an average yield of 2 percent
on the 4 billion riyals ($1.1 billion) of notes issued at its
monthly auction yesterday, its governor, Sheikh Abdullah Saud Al Thani, said by telephone from Doha today. The world’s biggest
exporter of liquefied natural gas sold 2 billion riyals of
three-month securities and 1 billion riyals each of six-month
and nine-month bills. That’s above yields on similar-maturity
bills in  Saudi Arabia (KSTBY91) ,  Kuwait  and Bahrain, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  “The yield on the T-bills was 2 percent on Tuesday, and
was 2 percent the previous month,” Sheikh Abdullah said. The
central bank pays an average of 1 percent on overnight deposits,
he added.  Qatar’s  central bank  began selling treasury bills in May
and started listing them on the country’s bourse on Dec. 29 “as
a first step toward starting a secondary market” for debt, the
bank said at the time.  To contact the reporters on this story:
