U.S. stocks are showing weakness
even though the performance of benchmark indexes would suggest
otherwise, according to Ari H. Wald, a Brown Brothers Harriman &
Co. analyst.  The CHART OF THE DAY tracks a market indicator that shaped
his view: the number of new 52-week highs for companies listed
on the New York Stock Exchange after subtracting 52-week lows.
The chart compares a 10-day moving average of net new highs,
which Wald cited in a report this week, with the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index.  Net new highs peaked on Feb. 8 and tumbled 63 percent
through the end of the first quarter as measured by the moving
average, based on data compiled by Bloomberg. The  S&P 500  rose
4.3 percent during the period and exceeded 1,400 for the first
time in almost four years.  The contrast suggests investors are favoring larger
companies at the expense of smaller ones, which leaves the
market vulnerable to declines, Wald wrote in the report.  “Fewer stocks are doing the heavy lifting,” the New York-
based analyst wrote. “The longer it persists, the more
worrisome it becomes.”  Declines in new highs were primarily responsible for the
lower net figures. The 10-day moving average fell by about 118
stocks from Feb. 8 through March 30, the first quarter’s final
trading day. While the comparable figure for new lows more than
doubled, the increase was only about nine stocks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
