Essar Oil Ltd. (ESOIL)  lost a bid to
overturn an order that it pay 63 billion rupees ($1.2 billion)
in sales tax to the Gujarat state government, with  India ’s top
court today rejecting the request. The shares plunged.  There is no legal ground to challenge the verdict, Supreme
Court Judges A.K. Patnaik and Jagdish Singh Khehar said in New
Delhi today.  The unit of London-listed  Essar Energy Plc (ESSR)  sought a review
of the Jan. 17 ruling ordering it to pay sales tax for not
finishing the construction of its refinery at Vadinar in the
western state before Aug. 15, 2003. Completing the crude oil
processing plant before that would have made the refiner
eligible to defer the  sales tax  payment by 17 years.  The  shares  declined as much as 6 percent, the most since
March 22, to 56.15 rupees and traded at 57.15 rupees as of 2:12
p.m. in Mumbai. Essar Oil has dropped 9.1 percent since Jan. 16,
the day before the court overturned a Gujarat court order that
entitled Essar Oil to the tax incentive.  Essar Oil has already set aside 40.2 billion rupees toward
the liability and is in talks with the Gujarat state government
to decide on the terms of the tax payment, according to an e-
mailed statement after the petition was rejected. The provision
resulted in a  loss  of 39.9 billion rupees in the quarter ended
Dec. 31, the company said Feb. 17.  In its petition, Essar Oil argued the refinery was delayed
because of a cyclone and a stay order secured by a civil society
body.  Essar said March 29 it completed an 83 billion rupee
expansion of the Vadinar refinery, increasing the plant’s
capacity by 29 percent to 375,000 barrels a day.  To contact the reporters on this story:
