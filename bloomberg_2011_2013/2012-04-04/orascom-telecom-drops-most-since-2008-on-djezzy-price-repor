Orascom Telecom Holding SAE (ORTE)  headed
for the biggest drop in more than three years after a report
said it may take months for the Algerian government to conclude
talks to buy the company’s local Djezzy unit.  Shares of North Africa’s biggest mobile phone company
plunged 9.5 percent to 3.44 Egyptian pounds at 1:18 p.m. in
Cairo, poised for the biggest daily decline since November 2008.
The benchmark  EGX 30 Index (EGX30)  fell 1.1 percent.  The negotiations between Algeria and  VimpelCom Ltd. (VIP) , which
merged with Orascom last year, may take many months because of a
price disagreement, Al Bayan reported, citing Finance Minister
Karim Djoudi. There is a “big disparity” between the price the
government is willing to pay and that sought by the seller, the
Dubai-based newspaper cited Djoudi as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
