Spain  sold 2.6 billion euros ($3.4
billion) of bonds, near the minimum planned, and borrowing costs
rose as the impact of European Central Bank’s emergency lending
waned. Bonds and the euro declined.  The Treasury auctioned bonds maturing in January 2015 at an
average 2.89 percent, up from 2.44 percent on March 15, while
bonds due in October 2016 yielded 4.319 percent, up from 3.376
percent on March 1. Securities maturing October 2020 were sold
at 5.338 percent, Madrid-based Bank of Spain said today. The
Treasury had set a range of 2.5 billion euros to 3.5 billion.  Spain’s financing costs had been held down by the ECB’s 1
trillion euros of three-year loans to banks, known as the LTRO,
some of which have been recycled into high-yielding government
debt. Yields had declined as much as 95 basis points after ECB
President  Mario Draghi  announced the policy on Dec. 8 and
Spanish banks’ holdings of government debt jumped to 220 billion
euros in January from 178 billion euros in November.  “It’s back to reality now, the auction shows the LTRO
effect has been exhausted and now demand for Spanish paper is
becoming much more price sensitive,”  Peter Chatwell , a London-
based fixed-income strategist at Credit Agricole Investment
Bank, said in a telephone interview.  Bonds Decline  The yield on the October 2016 bond, which acts as the five-
year benchmark, rose to 4.48 percent from 4.26 percent yesterday
and the gap between Spanish 10-year borrowing costs and German
equivalents widened to 386 basis points, the most since
December. The euro weakened after the sale, losing 0.8 percent
to trade at $1.3132.  The Spanish Treasury has covered 47 percent of the bond
issuance it plans for 2012, the  Economy Ministry  said in an e-
mailed statement today. “The Treasury has enough liquidity and
doesn’t need to force the market,” it said.  Spain’s 10-year benchmark bond yield rose to 5.64 percent,
from 5.45 percent yesterday. That compares with 4.87 percent on
March 1, before Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy  announced Spain
would miss its deficit target for a second year in 2012.  “Today’s auction almost certainly presages a turning of
the tide for Spain,” Nicholas Spiro, managing director of Spiro
Sovereign Strategy, said in an e-mail. “That the level of
issuance was low to begin with makes the result all the more
disappointing.”  Record Debt  Demand for the 2015 debt was 2.41 times the amount sold,
compared with 4.96 in March. The bid-to-cover ratio for the 2016
bonds was 2.46 times, compared with 2.59 times on March 1, and
2.96 times for the 2020 bonds, which hadn’t been auctioned since
September.  The sale is the first since Budget Minister Cristobal Montoro presented the government’s 2012 spending plan on March
30 and said  public debt  will rise to 79.8 percent of gross
domestic product, the highest since at least 1980, even as the
government makes the deepest budget cuts in three decades.  That leaves the gap between Spain’s debt load and the
European Commission’s projected average for the euro area at
10.6 percentage points, compared with 30.1 points in 2007 when
Spain began using budget surpluses to reduce borrowing. In its
forecast in November, the commission put Spain’s debt burden at
73.8 percent of GDP this year.  The Treasury will favor medium-term securities over 15-year
and 30-year bonds this year as it seeks to sell 36.8 billion
euros of net debt, or 186.1 billion euros in gross terms. That
will reduce the average maturity of outstanding debt to between
6.2 and 6.4 years, according to a spending plan sent to
Parliament yesterday.  Spain plans to make almost 29 billion euros of interest
payments in 2012, up from 22 billion euros a year earlier.
That’s equivalent to about 2.7 percent of GDP and is about the
same amount as the budget cuts announced last week to reorder
public finances.  To contact the reporters on this story:
