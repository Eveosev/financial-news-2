Four men were arrested and charged
with running a black-market prescription drug scheme and
defrauding the  New York  Medicaid program of $155 million, the
state attorney general said.  The operation was distributing HIV prescription drugs
obtained on the black market and dispensing them to Medicaid
recipients, Attorney General  Eric Schneiderman  said in a
statement today. The state’s Medicaid program was then billed
for the drugs.  The group “preyed on some of New York’s most vulnerable
patients just to make a quick buck,” Schneiderman said in the
statement.  The four charged are Stephen Costa of Miami, Ira Gross of
Babylon, New York, Glenn Schabel of Melville, New York, and
Harry Abolafia of San Antonio, the attorney general said.
Charges include grand larceny and money laundering.  The indictment was unsealed today in New York State Supreme
Court in Suffolk County.  To contact the reporters on this story:
