Genworth Financial Inc. (GNW)  cut Chairman
and Chief Executive Officer Michael Fraizer’s annual bonus to a
third of his target as the life insurer and mortgage guarantor
failed to meet its goals.  Fraizer was awarded $750,000 in annual incentive
compensation for 2011, or 33 percent of his $2.25 million
target, according to a proxy statement today. The CEO hasn’t
qualified for his full bonus since 2006 and got $1 million in
2010, filings show.  The worst U.S. housing crash in seven decades drained
capital at mortgage insurers, which pay lenders when homeowners
default and foreclosures fail to recoup costs. A $507 million
net operating loss at Genworth’s U.S. home-loan guaranty
business helped spur a lower-than-forecast return on equity last
year, which contributed to the board’s decision on executive
pay. The insurer’s stock plunged 50 percent in 2011.  “We recognize that it was a difficult year for
shareholders and are humbled by that,” Fraizer, 53, said in a
 letter  dated March 2012 in the Richmond, Virginia-based
company’s annual report.  Genworth said in a presentation in February that its
mortgage-guaranty business may rebound next year on the strength
of policies sold after 2008. The same month, the company said it
hired  Ray Romano , previously of  Freddie Mac , as chief risk
officer for U.S. mortgage insurance and promoted Dean Mitchell
to chief financial officer of the unit.  The insurer fell 2 percent to $8.01 at 1:24 p.m. in New
York, trimming its gain this year to 22 percent. That compares
with the 20 percent advance of the 81-company Standard & Poor’s
Financials Index since Dec. 31.  Fraizer was paid $1.12 million in salary, the same as in
2010, in addition to his annual bonus. His total compensation,
including option awards, totaled $4.29 million, a 38 percent
decrease from a year earlier, according to the proxy statement.  Al Orendorff, a spokesman for the insurer, declined to
comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
