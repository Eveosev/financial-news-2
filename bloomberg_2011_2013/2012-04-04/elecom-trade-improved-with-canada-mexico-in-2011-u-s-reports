Relations with  Canada  and Mexico on
trade in telecommunications equipment and services improved in
the past year, U.S. Trade Representative  Ron Kirk  said in
releasing a review of global commercial barriers.  Phone-service providers in Mexico resolved access disputes
with U.S.-affiliated competitor Marcatel SA, and Canada may lift
foreign investment limits on companies that control less than 10
percent of the market, Kirk said in a statement.  “Approval of such a proposal” by Canadian lawmakers
“could be a step toward bringing more competition and foreign
participation into the Canadian market,” Kirk said.  Trade in all merchandise among Canada, Mexico and the U.S.
reached $1 trillion in 2011 for the first time, U.S. President
Barack Obama said April 2 during a Washington news conference
with Canadian Prime Minister  Stephen Harper  and Mexican
President Felipe Calderon.  Local content requirements for trade in equipment in
countries including Brazil and India may put U.S. manufacturers
at a disadvantage, Kirk’s agency said in a statement with the
annual report on the effectiveness of telecommunications trade
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
