Gasoline increased after an
industry-funded report showed U.S. inventories of the fuel
dropped to a two-month low.  Futures gained for a third day after stockpiles of the
motor fuel fell 2 percent to 221.8 million barrels, the lowest
level since January 6, American Petroleum Institute data showed
yesterday.  “The API numbers  in gasoline  have a nice size draw that
doesn’t show that supplies are building as we approach the
driving season,”  Gene McGillian , an analyst and broker at
Tradition Energy in  Stamford ,  Connecticut . “We need
confirmation” of the decrease from Energy Department data
released today at 10:30 a.m. in Washington, he said.  Gasoline for May delivery advanced 0.6 cent to $3.4014 a
gallon at 9:15 a.m. on the  New York Mercantile Exchange ,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Prices have risen 27
percent this year, the best-performing contract in the Standard
& Poor’s GSCI index of 24 commodities.  The Energy Department will release its report today at
10:30 a.m. in Washington.  The report will probably show that total U.S. gasoline
inventories dropped 1.4 million barrels to a 13-week low,
according to the median estimate of 11 analysts in a survey by
Bloomberg News. Distillate supplies fell 500,000 barrels,
according to the survey.  May-delivery heating oil fell 1.31 cents, or 0.4 percent,
to $3.2144 a gallon on the Nymex. Prices have risen 9.5 percent
this year.  Regular gasoline  at the pump, averaged nationwide, rose 0.5
cent yesterday to $3.928, according to AAA, the nation’s biggest
motoring club. Prices have gained 20 percent this year, and are
7.3 percent above a year ago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
