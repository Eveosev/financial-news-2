The pound extended an advance
against the euro as a report showed U.K. services growth
unexpectedly accelerated in March.  Sterling climbed 0.3 percent to 82.91 pence per euro at
9:36 a.m. London time. It was little changed at $1.5904, after
earlier weakening as much as 0.3 percent.  The 10-year gilt yield rose three basis points to 2.20
percent. The two-year note yield also advanced three basis
points to 0.44 percent.  A gauge of  services activity  based on a survey of
 purchasing managers  rose to 55.3 from 53.8 in February, Markit
Economics and the  Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply 
said. The median forecast of 29 economists in a Bloomberg News
survey was for a reading of 53.4. A measure above 50 indicates
expansion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
