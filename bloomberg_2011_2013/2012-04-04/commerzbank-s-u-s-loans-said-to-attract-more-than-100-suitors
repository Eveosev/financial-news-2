Commerzbank AG (CBK) ,  Germany ’s second-
largest bank, attracted more than 100 prospective buyers for
$740 million of U.S. real-estate loans held by its Eurohypo
unit, according to two people with knowledge of the matter.  The loans are on high-profile properties in  New York  and
other U.S. cities such as Boston, Miami, Chicago and  San
Francisco , said the people who declined to be identified because
discussions are confidential. Officials at Commerzbank and
Eurohypo declined to comment.  Commerzbank will wind down Eurohypo, its real estate and
public finance lender, to comply with European Union state aid
conditions. The bank said March 30 that only 10 billion euros
($13.2 billion) of Eurohypo retail assets and 25 billion euros
of commercial real-estate assets in Germany, the U.K.,  France 
and Poland, will gradually be transferred to Commerzbank. The
U.S. loans will be wound down.  Eurohypo stated in its annual report for 2011 that its
commercial real-estate loans outside Germany amounted to 28.9
billion euros. New business in the U.S. in that sector in the
period was 340 million euros. Reuters reported the story earlier
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
