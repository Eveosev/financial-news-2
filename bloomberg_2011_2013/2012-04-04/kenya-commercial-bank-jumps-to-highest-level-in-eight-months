Kenya Commercial Bank Ltd. (KNCB) , the East
African nation’s largest lender by assets, headed for its
highest level in eight months on speculation earnings will
improve.  The stock jumped 2.2 percent to 23 shillings, the highest
since Aug. 4, by the 3 p.m. close in Nairobi, the capital, as
four times the average daily volume of shares in the past three
months changed hands.  KCB, as the lender is known, currently has outlets in
Uganda,  Tanzania , Rwanda and  South Sudan , and plans to start
operations in Burundi this month, Chairman Peter Muthoka said
March 1. KCB’s full-year profit through to December jumped 53
percent to 11 billion shillings ($132.4 million).  “Most of the trades are by foreign investors and they have
been interested in KCB since the results,” George Bodo, an
equity strategist at Nairobi-based Apex Africa Capital Ltd.,
said by phone today. “They are quite bullish about the bank
going forward because they see the regional businesses as a
major driver.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
