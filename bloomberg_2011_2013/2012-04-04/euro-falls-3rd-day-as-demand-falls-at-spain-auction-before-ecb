The euro fell to the lowest in
almost a month against the dollar after demand declined at a
Spanish bond auction, adding to concern the region is struggling
to overcome its sovereign-debt crisis.  The 17-nation currency weakened after the  European Central
Bank  kept its benchmark rate at a record low and President  Mario Draghi  said the economic outlook remained subject to “downside
risks.” The yen and dollar strengthened versus all their most-
traded peers tracked by Bloomberg amid demand for the relative
safety of the nations’ debt. Sterling rallied as U.K.  services
growth  accelerated last month and  house prices  increased.  “The large selloff that you saw in euro relative to other
currencies is the desire of a lot of the market to be short euro
right now given that people are starting to turn back to the
euro crisis driven by  Spain ,” said David Grad, a foreign-
exchange strategist at Bank of America Corp. in  New York . “The
market focus is shifting and so there is downside risk for the
euro.” A short position is a bet than an asset will decline in
value.  The euro depreciated 0.7 percent to $1.3142 at 5 p.m. in
New York after dropping to $1.3107, the weakest level since
March 16. The shared currency fell 1.1 percent to 108.37 yen. It
earlier declined to 107.91, the lowest since March 13. The yen
advanced 0.4 percent to 82.46 per dollar.  Pound Advance  The pound rose against most of its major peers before the
 Bank of England  meets tomorrow.  Sterling gained 0.6 percent to 82.71 pence per euro after a
gauge of U.K.  services activity  based on a survey of  purchasing
managers  increased to 55.3 from 53.8 in February. A separate
report showed house prices climbed 2.2 percent in March from the
previous month, Lloyds Banking Group Plc’s Halifax division
said.  The euro has declined 0.8 percent in the past week, the
worst performance among the 10 developed-nation currencies
tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The dollar
appreciated 0.6 percent, the yen has gained 0.6 percent and
sterling is little changed.  The shared currency is poised to extend declines after
falling below its 50- and 100-day moving averages, currently at
$1.3218 and $1.3157, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Spain’s Debt  Spain sold 2.59 billion euros of bonds today, less than its
maximum target of 3.5 billion euros, the central bank said.
Demand for notes maturing in 2015 was 2.41 times the amount
allotted, down from 4.96 at the previous sale of the maturity in
March. It also sold securities due in 2016 and 2020.  Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy  said Spain’s situation is one
of “extreme difficulty” and signaled that his budget cuts are
less painful than a bailout would be, as demand for the nation’s
debt slumped at an auction.  “Governments are tightening the budgets and imposing
austerity but they’re struggling to do so in a way that allows
growth,” said Eric Viloria, senior currency strategist for Gain
Capital Group LLC in New York. “We could test $1.30 in the next
few days and if it does not find support there it would mean
another big leg down.”  Spanish 10-year  bond yields  jumped as much as 26 basis
points to a 12-week high of 5.71 percent, approaching the levels
seen in December, before the European Central Bank said it would
make unlimited three-year loans to banks. Some of the 1 trillion
euros taken in the so-called LTROs has been recycled into high-
yielding government debt, which initially helped shave as much
95 basis point off Spanish yields before they began to rise
again in March.  ECB View  “The remaining tensions in euro area sovereign-debt
markets are expected to damp economic momentum,” Draghi said at
a press conference in  Frankfurt . The ECB left its main
refinancing rate at a record low 1 percent, as forecast by all
57 economists in a Bloomberg News survey.  Switzerland ’s franc advanced to the strongest since Sept.
19 against the euro as sovereign debt-crisis concern boosted
demand for the perceived safety of the Swiss currency.  The currency strengthened as much as 0.1 percent to 1.20313
per euro before trading at 1.20360. The  Swiss National Bank  set
a limit of 1.20 francs per euro in September last year.  The dollar’s gains were supported as a report showed U.S.
companies expanded payrolls in March, adding to speculation the
 Federal Reserve  will refrain from further steps to cap borrowing
costs. U.S. payrolls climbed by more than 200,000 in March for a
fourth month, economists said before the Labor Department report
on April 6.  Dollar Measure  The  Dollar Index (DXY) , which Intercontinental Exchange Inc. uses
to track the currency against those of six major trading
partners, rose 0.3 percent to 79.744. Treasury 10-year  yields 
fell eight basis points, or 0.08 percentage point, to 2.22
percent and benchmark Japanese bonds  traded  at 1.03 percent.  Australia ’s dollar slid after the central bank said imports
outpaced exports by A$480 million in February. Economists
forecast a surplus of A$1.1 billion, a Bloomberg survey showed.  “Australia came out with a second consecutive trade
deficit last night, that’s going to hit it pretty hard,” said
Kit Juckes, head of foreign-exchange research at Societe
Generale SA, by phone from  London .  The Aussie slid 0.6 percent to $1.0270 after falling to
$1.0244, the weakest since Jan. 13. It fell 1 percent to 84.69
yen.  To contact the reporters on this story:
