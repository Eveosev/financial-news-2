Oil options volatility rose as the
underlying futures tumbled after the Energy Department said
crude stockpiles surged the most since 2008.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
May, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge
of options prices, was 24.74 percent as of 3:35 p.m. on the  New
York Mercantile Exchange  versus 23.5 yesterday.  Crude for May delivery dropped $2.54, or 2.7 percent, to
settle at $101.47 a barrel on the Nymex after the report that
inventories rose 9.01 million barrels to 362.4 million barrels
last week. U.S. production gained 2.9 percent to 6.05 million
barrels a day, the Energy Department said.  The most-active options in electronic trading today were
May $100 puts, which rose 48 cents to $1.10 a barrel at 4:19
p.m. with 3,169 contracts trading. May $95 puts were the second-
most active with 2,553 lots changing hands. They rose 10 cent to
23 cents a barrel.  Puts accounted for 59 percent of electronic trading volume.
One contract covers 1,000 barrels of crude.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on floor
trading, where the bulk of options trading occurs.  Bearish options accounted for 54 percent of the 96,699
trades today. June $95 puts were the most actively traded, with
5,333 lots changing hands as they rose 11 cents to 92 cents a
barrel. The next-most active options, May $100 puts, rose 10
cents to 62 cents on volume of 5,322.  Open interest was highest for December $80 puts with 45,672
contracts. Next were December $150 calls with 39,033 lots and
December $100 calls with 34,927.  To contact the reporter on this story:
