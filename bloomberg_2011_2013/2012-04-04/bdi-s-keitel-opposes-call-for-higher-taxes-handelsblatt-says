Hans-Peter Keitel, president of the
German BDI industry federation, said it is the wrong time to
increase taxes,  Handelsblatt  reported, citing an interview.  Keitel was responding to comments from  Peer Steinbrueck ,
the former German finance minister, who said earlier this week
he considers tax cuts in  Germany  unrealistic. It would be wrong
to increase the burden on companies and their “high
performers” as they were the ones who brought Germany out of
the crisis, the newspaper quoted Keitel as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
