New World Resources Plc (NWR) , the biggest
Czech producer of coking coal, fell after the  Federal Reserve 
signaled it may refrain from more monetary stimulus for the
worldâ€™s largest economy, driving investors from commodities.  The stock slid 1.4 percent to 131.2 koruna by 2:43 p.m. in
 Prague , extending its loss over the past month to 16 percent.
Benchmark  coal  derivatives retreated 0.8 percent to $113.75 a
metric ton in the Netherlands, a third day of declines.  To contact the reporter on this story:
