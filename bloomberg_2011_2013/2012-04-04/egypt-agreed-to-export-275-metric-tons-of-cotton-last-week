Egypt  agreed to export 275 metric
tons of cotton in the week ending March 30, the Alexandria
Cotton Exporters Association said today in its weekly bulletin.  The country has shipped 66,620 tons of cotton valued at
$209.7 million since the marketing year began on Sept 1. Of last
week’s sales, Egypt will ship 225 tons of the Giza 88 cotton
variety, and 50 tons of Giza 86, the association said.  Egypt produces the world’s finest extra-long staple cotton,
which is stronger and softer than shorter staple cotton. The
longer staple is used in high-end clothing. Switzerland,
Bangladesh and  India  are the largest importers of Egyptian
cotton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
