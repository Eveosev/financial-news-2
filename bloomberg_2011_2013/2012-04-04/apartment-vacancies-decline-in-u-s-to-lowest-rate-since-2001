Apartment vacancies in the U.S. fell
to their lowest level since 2001 as home seizures and a growing
pool of young adults forming households boosted rental demand,
according to  Reis Inc. (REIS)   The vacancy rate fell to 4.9 percent in the first quarter
from 6.2 percent a year earlier, the New York-based property-
research company said in a report today. It was only the third
time since Reis began gathering the data 31 years ago that the
rate was less than 5 percent.  Renters are competing for a tightening supply of units as
more homeowners are displaced by  foreclosures , stricter
mortgage-lending standards block purchases and young people move
out on their own. In the three months ended March 31, 7,342
 apartments  became available, the fewest number of completions
since Reis began publishing such data in 1999.  When vacancies drop below 5 percent, “effective rents tend
to spike as landlords perceive that tight market conditions
allow for greater pricing power,” Reis said in the report.  Effective rents, which take into account such landlord
concessions as a free month, climbed almost 1 percent from the
previous quarter to an average $1,018, the largest increase
since the last recession began, according to Reis.  While low vacancies are helping to boost the performance of
apartment properties nationwide, “risks may manifest later in
the year” as multifamily developers pick up the pace of
construction to take advantage of rising rents, Victor Calanog,
head of research and economics at Reis, said in the report.  Reis expects about 70,000 units to open for leasing this
year, about double the supply growth in 2011. Next year, the
firm forecasts 150,000 to 200,000 new units in the 79 primary
markets it tracks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
