(Corrects story that moved yesterday to show that GE’s
credit rating was cut one step, not two, in 16th paragraph.)  U.S. stocks fell, with the Standard
& Poor’s 500 Index posting this year’s second-biggest decline,
as demand dropped at a Spanish bond auction and  SanDisk (SNDK)  Corp.’s
lower forecast dragged down technology shares.  Computer and software makers fell 1.4 percent as a group
and were the  biggest drag  on the S&P 500 among 10 industries as
SanDisk, the biggest maker of flash-memory cards, tumbled 11
percent. Alcoa Inc. lost 2.5 percent, pacing declines among
material companies, as investors sold shares of companies most-
tied to the economy after a report on U.S. service industries
missed estimates.  Bank of America Corp. (BAC)  and  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) 
slumped at least 2.2 percent as financial stocks slid.  The S&P 500 lost 1 percent to close at 1,398.96 at 4 p.m.
in  New York  today, retreating the most since March 6, when the
benchmark index plunged 1.5 percent in its worst drop of the
year. The  Dow Jones Industrial Average  slid 124.8 points, or 1
percent, to 13,074.75.  The Spanish auction “serves as a reminder to the market
that  Europe  is still with us,”  Mark Freeman , chief investment
officer at Westwood Holdings Group Inc. in  Dallas , said in a
telephone interview. His firm oversees about $13 billion. “We
still have a long way to go before things get worked out,” he
said. “The market has now moved significantly higher. But guess
what, expectations are now much higher. What ultimately it’s
going to take is much stronger corporate profits.”  Fed Minutes  The  S&P 500 dropped  0.4 percent yesterday as the minutes
from the March 13 meeting of the  Federal Open Market Committee 
showed a decreased urgency for further monetary stimulus. The
 Federal Reserve  will refrain from increasing monetary
accommodation unless economic expansion falters or prices rise
at a rate slower than its 2 percent target. The  S&P 500  rallied
to its highest level since May 2008 on April 2 after a gauge of
 U.S. manufacturing  climbed more than estimated.  Spain  sold 2.59 billion euros ($3.4 billion) of bonds at an
auction today, the Bank of Spain said. That was less than the
maximum target of 3.5 billion euros. It auctioned 973 million
euros of five-year notes at an average yield of 4.32 percent.
Investors bid for 2.46 times the amount of debt allotted. That
compared with a bid-to-cover ratio of 2.59 at the previous
auction of the securities on March 1.  Stocks extended losses after the  Institute for Supply
Management ’s  non-manufacturing index  dropped to 56 from a one-
year high of 57.3 in February. Readings above 50 signal
expansion, and economists surveyed by Bloomberg News projected
56.8 for the gauge, according to the median estimate.  ‘Excuse to Pause’  Companies added 209,000 jobs last month after a revised
230,000 gain in February, figures from ADP Employer Services
showed today. The median estimate in the Bloomberg News survey
called for a 206,000 increase.  “It doesn’t matter what the news is today, I don’t think
it’ll stem a decline,” said Richard Weeks, the Vienna,
Virginia-based managing director and partner at HighTower’s VWG
Wealth Management. His firm oversees more than $20 billion.
“The market is showing signs that it’s ready for a little
consolidation. You could make a case that the market is looking
for an excuse to pause and digest some of its gains.”  Technology and financial shares in the S&P 500 have risen
21 percent and 20 percent this year respectively, the most among
the 10 industry groups.  The S&P 500 Information Technology Index tumbled 1.4
percent today, the biggest decline since Dec. 21. SanDisk sank
11 percent, the most in the S&P 500, to $44.51 after predicting
revenue in the quarter that ended April 1 of about $1.2 billion.
That compared with an earlier forecast for sales of $1.3 billion
to $1.35 billion. Gross margin, a measure of profitability, will
be less than the company’s previous prediction of 39 percent to
42 percent, SanDisk said.  Micron, KBW  Micron Technology Inc. (MU) , the largest U.S. maker of computer
memory, lost 4.1 percent to $7.66.  Investors sold shares of companies most-tied to economic
growth, sending raw-material producers to a 1.4 percent drop,
the third-biggest loss in the S&P 500. Alcoa Inc., the largest
aluminum producer in the U.S., slumped 2.5 percent to $9.81 for
the second-biggest retreat in the Dow.  All groups in the S&P 500 except phone companies slumped
today. The Morgan Stanley Cyclical Index fell 1.4 percent.  The KBW Bank Index retreated 1.8 percent. Bank of America
slumped 3.1 percent to $9.20 while JPMorgan declined 2.2 percent
to $44.41.  GE’s Rating  General Electric Co. (GE) , the maker of  jet engines , power
generation equipment, health-care imaging equipment and
locomotives, fell 1.1 percent to $19.74. Moody’s Investors
Service cut GE’s credit rating by one step and reduced GE
Capital Corp. by two steps, citing “heightened risk” from the
finance unit.  St. Jude Medical Inc. slipped 4.9 percent to $41.67. The
medical-device maker will stop selling the QuickSite and
QuickFlex left-ventricular leads, wires that help pace the heart
after 39 reports of the wires protruding from their insulation.  WebMD Health Corp. (WBMD)  fell 9.4 percent to $23.29, the lowest
since April 2009. The medical information company said it will
purchase 5.77 million shares, or about 10 percent of outstanding
equity, for $26 each.  To contact the reporters on this story:
