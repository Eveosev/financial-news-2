Alistair Cook and captain  Andrew Strauss  both scored half centuries as England reached 154-1,
bring the visitors to within 121 runs of  Sri Lanka ’s first
innings total of 275 on day two of their second cricket Test.  The openers combined for 122 runs before Strauss fell for
61 in Colombo. Cook, on 77, and  Jonathan Trott , on 15, were
batting at the end of the day. Sri Lanka could only add 37 runs
to its overnight total of 238-6 as Graeme Swann took four
wickets.  England is trying to avenge a 75-run loss in the first
match in Galle. The visitors must win at the P. Sara Oval to
retain the No. 1 Test ranking after losing last week’s opening
Test.  South Africa  will take the top spot should England fail to
tie the two-match series. Sri Lanka is seeking its first Test
series victory since August 2009.  Swann, who had one wicket yesterday, added three more and
conceded just four runs in the 6.1 overs he bowled, finding grip
from the slow surface. Angelo Matthews who started the day
unbeaten on 41 added 16 to his overnight total before being
caught at mid-wicket. Suraj Randiv was caught in the deep before
Swann ended the innings by bowling Suranga Lakmal for a second-
ball for no runs.  Strauss and Cook batted patiently to put together their
biggest partnership of the winter. They shared a 51-over stand
before the England captain edged  Tillakaratne Dilshan  to
wicketkeeper Prasanna Jayawardene.  To contact the reporter on this story:
