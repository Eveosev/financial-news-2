MagicJack VocalTec Ltd. (CALL) , whose
founders invented the technology to make phone calls over the
Internet, fell the most in two months in U.S. trading after Ilan Rosen resigned as chairman.  Shares of Netanya, Israel-based MagicJack slid 7.2 percent
to $20.73 as of 2:52 p.m. in New York. They earlier lost as much
as 9 percent, the most intraday since Feb. 1.  Rosen resigned as chairman of MagicJack as of April 1, and
Gerald Vento, currently a board member, will probably replace
him, Chief Executive Officer Dan Borislow said in a telephone
interview. Rosen didn’t have any disputes with the company,
Borislow added.  “Gerald has a tremendous amount of telecom experience,”
Borislow said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
