Russia ’s central Tver region
northwest of Moscow set check points along highways to stop
hunters from bringing in wild hogs that may spread African swine
fever to private pig farms.  African swine fever was found twice in wild hogs in Tver
region so far this year, Russia’s food safety agency
Rosselkhoznadzor said on its website today. It is a viral
disease that’s lethal for pigs and harmless to people, according
to the  United Nations ’ Food & Agriculture Organization.  To contact the reporter on this story:
