Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  will shut the
Mars deep-water platform in the U.S. Gulf of  Mexico  in the
second quarter for planned work, according to a company
spokeswoman.  Shell, based in the Hague, will perform maintenance on the
site, located about 130 miles (209 kilometers) south of  New
Orleans , and conduct work related to a second platform, the
Olympus, that the company is building in the  Mars (USCSMARS)  field, Emily Oberton, a Houston-based spokeswoman, said in an e-mail.  “This is normal maintenance along with some work in
preparation for the Mars B Olympus development,” Oberton said.  Shell says it expects to begin production at Mars B Olympus
beginning in 2015, according to a statement posted on the
company’s website when the project was announced in 2010.
Olympus will be able to process about 100,000 barrels of oil
equivalent per day, the statement shows.  The existing Mars platform produces about 190,000 barrels
of oil equivalent a day, according to a separate statement on
Shell’s  website .  Shell has a 71.5 percent working interest in Mars, with
London-based  BP Plc (BP/)  holding the rest, according to the
statements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
