Commodities fell for a second day as
oil tumbled after U.S. stockpiles surged the most since 2008 and
as the  Federal Reserve  signaled it may refrain from more
monetary stimulus.  The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot Index of 24 commodities
dropped as much as 2 percent as West Texas Intermediate oil
futures, which has a weighting of 30.25 percent in the  index ,
fell after the Energy Department reported inventories rose 9.01
million barrels last week. Gold and silver tumbled as the dollar
strengthened after the Fed’s statement.  Oil inventories gained as U.S.  domestic output  rose 2.9
percent to 6.05 million barrels a day, the most since 1999,
department data showed. The Fed will refrain from increasing
monetary accommodation unless the economic expansion falters or
prices rise at a rate slower than its 2 percent target,
according to minutes of the March 13 meeting released yesterday.  “The fundamentals for the energy sector are bearish,”
said John Caruso, a Chicago-based commodities broker at RJO
Futures. “Commodities are falling and it’s a direct result from
what we’ve heard yesterday with the Fed minutes. Investors are
worried and they are parking their money on the sidelines.”  The GSCI declined 1.6 percent to 686.35 at 12:02 p.m. Oil
for May delivery fell $2.31, or 2.2 percent, to $101.70 a barrel
on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  after touching $101.20, the
lowest level since Feb. 16.  Silver Slips  Silver was the biggest decliner in the index. The most
active May contract plunged 5.7 percent to $31.385 an ounce on
the Comex in New York. Gold for June delivery slumped 3.1
percent to $1,619.60 an ounce on the Comex.  The Dollar Index (DXY) , which tracks the U.S. currency against
six counterparts including the euro and the yen, gained 0.4
percent, rising for a second day. A stronger dollar erodes
demand for raw materials as alternative assets.  Crude  stockpiles  increased 9.01 million barrels to 362.4
million barrels last week, the highest level since June 17,
according to the Energy Department. Inventories were projected
to increase 2.5 million barrels, according to the median
estimate of 11 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  “Today’s report is evidence that there is sufficient oil
supply out there,” said  James Williams , an economist at WTRG
Economics, an energy-research firm in  London ,  Arkansas .  To contact the reporter on this story:
