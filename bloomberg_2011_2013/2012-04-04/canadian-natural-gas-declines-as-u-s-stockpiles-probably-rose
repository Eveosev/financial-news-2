Canadian natural gas fell amid
expectations that U.S. inventories of the fuel rose for a third
straight week.  Alberta  gas declined 2.3 percent. Stockpiles probably rose
33 billion cubic feet last week, the median of 31 analyst
estimates compiled by  Bloomberg (DOENUSCH) . The increase has averaged 8
billion in the past five years, according to U.S.  Energy
Department (DOENUST5)  data.  “The market is really struggling here,” said Kyle Cooper,
director of research at IAF Advisors in Houston. “The price is
already low. Inventories are bearish and the weather forecast
remains bearish.”  Alberta gas for May delivery dropped 4 cents to C$1.71 a
gigajoule ($1.63 per million British thermal units) as of 3:40
p.m. New York time on  NGX , a Canadian Internet market.  Gas traded on the exchange is shipped to users in  Canada 
and the U.S. and priced on  TransCanada Corp. (TRP) ’s Alberta system.
NGX gas is down 43 percent this year.  Natural gas for May delivery on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  fell 4.6 cents, or 2.1 percent, to settle at $2.141 per
million Btu.  Spot gas at the Alliance delivery point near Chicago gained
6.56 cents, or 3.1 percent, to $2.1707 per million Btu on the
 Intercontinental Exchange . Alliance is an express line that can
carry 1.5 billion cubic feet a day from western Canada.  Spot Prices  At the Kingsgate point on the border of  Idaho  and British
Columbia, gas advanced 7.71 cents, or 3.9 percent, to $2.0522
per million Btu. At Malin,  Oregon , where Canadian gas is traded
for California markets, prices increased 7.66 cents, or 3.8
percent, to $2.1186.  Volume on TransCanada’s  Alberta system , which collects the
output of most of the nation’s gas wells, was 16.7 billion cubic
feet, 87 million below target.  Gas was flowing at a daily rate of 1.93 billion cubic feet
at Empress, Alberta, where the fuel is transferred to
TransCanada’s main line, at 2 p.m. New York time.  At McNeil, Saskatchewan, where gas is transferred to the
Northern Border Pipeline for shipment to the  Chicago  area, the
daily flow rate was 1.85 billion cubic feet.  Available capacity on TransCanada’s British Columbia system
at  Kingsgate  was 759 million cubic feet. The system was forecast
to carry 1.9 billion cubic feet today, or 72 percent of its
capacity of 2.65 billion.  The volume on  Spectra Energy’s  British Columbia system,
which gathers the fuel in northeastern British Columbia for
delivery to Vancouver and the Pacific Northwest, totaled 2.99
billion cubic feet at 2:35 p.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
