Colombia,  South America ’s third-
largest oil supplier, said crude production rose 7.2 percent in
March after the government increased security in response to
rebel attacks on infrastructure.  Output rose to an average of 951,000 barrels a day in March
from 887,000 barrels a day a year earlier, after the government
increased military presence in drilling areas, the Mines and
Energy Ministry said in a statement. In February, output fell
4.8 percent to 896,000 barrels a day after pipeline sabotage.  “The creation of new battalions in oil areas, and
coordination between national police, the Armed Forces and
regional and municipal authorities allowed the restoration of
operations,” Mines and Energy Minister  Mauricio Cardenas  said
in the statement.  Sabotage of energy towers, pipelines, roads and bridges
rose last year for the first time since 2008, according to
 government statistics .  Ecopetrol SA (ECOPETL) , Colombia’s largest oil company, expects to
meet production targets this year as the government tightens
security after an increase in guerrilla attacks, Chief Executive
Officer  Javier Gutierrez  said in an interview last month.  The government is making additional investments to
guarantee security, Cardenas told oil executives in March in
Cartagena, Colombia. The nation is the largest oil supplier in
South America after Venezuela and Brazil.  To contact the reporter on this story:
