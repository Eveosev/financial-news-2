Iraq ’s national meeting to resolve
internal political disputes was postponed indefinitely on
concern it would worsen tensions in the country, Parliament
Speaker Usama al-Nujaifi said.  Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki had invited all political
parties to what he termed a “national meeting” on April 5 to
resolve disputes hindering the country’s rebuilding.  Violence and political clashes in Iraq have increased since
December when the U.S. pulled out its remaining troops from the
country. The Sunni Muslim-backed al-Iraqiya coalition has
boycotted parliament and Cabinet sessions for weeks to press
demands for more power-sharing with the Shiite Muslim prime
minister’s alliance.  Iraqiya, led by former Prime Minister  Ayad Allawi , has
warned that if talks to resolve the disputes fail, it will join
other politicians in efforts to dissolve parliament and hold
early elections.  Iraq is seeking investment and expertise to develop the
world’s fifth-largest crude oil reserves. The central government
and the semi-autonomous Kurdistan authority are also locked in a
dispute over oil revenue that prompted the Kurds to halt
shipments of their crude through the country’s main export
pipeline in the north on April 1. The two sides have also traded
accusations about suspected crude oil smuggling to neighboring
 Iran .  To contact the reporter on this story:
