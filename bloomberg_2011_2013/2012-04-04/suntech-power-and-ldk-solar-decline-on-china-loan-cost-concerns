Suntech Power Holdings Co. (STP)  and  LDK
Solar Co. (LDK)  sank in U.S. trading on concern new lending
initiatives in China may increase borrowing costs for the
world’s largest solar companies.  Suntech, the world’s biggest maker of solar panels, dropped
2.1 percent to $2.79. LDK, the second-biggest maker of solar
wafers, retreated 3.3 percent to $3.49.  Trina Solar Ltd. (TSL) ,
China’s third-biggest maker of solar panels, fell 3.1 percent to
$6.54 per share.  Solar companies’ borrowing costs will rise if policies by
China’s Premier Wen Jiabao to boost the country’s non-bank
lending are put in place, said Hari Chandra Polavarapu, an
analyst at Auriga USA in New York.  “Their banking system lends an enormous amount to the
Chinese solar players, and if the screws are tightened on those
banks, they’d have to raise rates on the solar companies,”
Chandra Polavarapu said in a phone interview.  China needs to break a banking “monopoly” of a few big
lenders that make easy profits because it’s hard to borrow money
elsewhere, Wen said yesterday, as cited by China National Radio.  To contact the reporter on this story:
