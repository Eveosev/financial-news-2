Corn futures fell the most in almost
two weeks and wheat declined on speculation that demand may slow
from importers, processors and investors after prices jumped
last week. Soybeans also dropped.  About 35.8 million bushels of corn were inspected for
export in the week ended May 19, 5 percent less than a week
earlier, while wheat inspections were little changed, the
government said yesterday. Last week, wheat and corn futures
both surged 11 percent on signs that wet weather in the U.S.
delayed planting and may hurt crop yields.  “We had good gains in wheat and corn,” said  Tom Leffler ,
the owner of Leffler Commodities LLC in Augusta,  Kansas . “We’ve
got some profit-taking taking place off of the higher prices. It
doesn’t seem like anybody’s willing to step in and do more
buying.”  Corn futures for July delivery sank 20.75 cents, or 2.8
percent, to settle at $7.3325 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the
Chicago Board of Trade, capping the biggest drop since May 11.
The commodity has almost doubled in the past year.  Wheat futures for July delivery fell 23.25 cents, or 2.9
percent, to $7.7975 a bushel. The price is up 67 percent in the
past year, as drought cut output in  Russia  and damaged crops in
the U.S. Great Plains, while excessive rainfall slowed planting
in the northern U.S. and  Canada .  Soybean futures for July delivery slipped 1.5 cents, or 0.1
percent, to $13.7225 a bushel. Prices fluctuated between gains
and losses today and earlier climbed as much as 1.1 percent.  Export inspections of the oilseed rose 43 percent to 7.77
million bushels in the week ended May 19. That was still six
times lower than this year’s high of 49.219 million set in
February, according to the  U.S. Department of Agriculture .  Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, valued at $66.7 billion in
2010, followed by soybeans at $38.9 billion, government figures
show. Wheat was fourth at $13 billion, behind hay.  To contact the reporter on this story:
