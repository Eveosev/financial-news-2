Ethanol declined a second day in
 Chicago  on speculation that supply is ample and as lower corn
prices signaled cheaper production costs.  The grain-based gasoline additive slumped amid output at
900,000 barrels a day, or the highest level since the week ended
April 1, according to Energy Department data. Separately, corn,
which is used to make ethanol, declined the most in almost two
weeks on demand concerns.  “There’s not a lot of places that are screaming for
gallons,” said Ronnie Virissimo, a trader at SCB & Associates
LLC in Chicago. “There’s a pretty well-supplied market right
now. Anyone looking to sell has to change their expectations for
the type of premium they’re looking for.”  Denatured ethanol for June delivery fell 3.9 cents, or 1.5
percent, to $2.611 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade, the
largest decline since May 11 and the first back-to-back losses
since May 6.  In cash market trading, ethanol was unchanged in the U.S.
Gulf at $2.765 a gallon and on the West Coast at $2.775,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol in  New York  slipped 2 cents, or 0.7 percent, to
$2.735 a gallon and in Chicago the biofuel lost 1 cent, or 0.4
percent, to $2.65.  Corn futures for July delivery slipped 20.75 cents, or 2.8
percent, to $7.3325 a bushel in Chicago. The commodity has
nearly doubled in the past year. One bushel can be used to make
at least 2.75 gallons of ethanol.  Average ethanol mills in  Iowa  are earning 3 cents on every
gallon produced, while plants in  Illinois  are earning 5 cents on
a spot basis, according to Ag Trader Talk, an online grains
information service in Clive, Iowa.  To contact the reporter on this story:
