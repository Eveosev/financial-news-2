Hyundai Motor Co. (005380)  and  Kia Motors Corp. (000270) 
shares fell in Seoul trading as a strike by a piston-ring
supplier disrupted diesel-engine production in South Korea.  Hyundai, the nation’s largest automaker, declined as much
as 2.9 percent to 221,500 won on the Korea Exchange. Its
affiliate Kia dropped as much as 3.5 percent.  Hyundai, Kia, GM Korea Co., Renault Samsung Motors Co. and
Ssangyong Motor Co. will lose 276,000 units worth 4.7 trillion
won ($4.3 billion) should the strike run through next month,
according to a group statement the automakers released today.
Workers at  Yoosung Enterprise Co.  have been on strike since May
18, the Korea Automobile Manufacturers Association, a group
representing the country’s automakers, said in an e-mailed
statement today.  “We urge the workers’ union at Yoosung to stop the factory
occupation and return to the assembly lines, considering the
impact on  South Korea ’s auto industry and economy,” the
automakers’ group said in the statement.  Three calls to Yoosung’s headquarters in Asan, South Korea
were unanswered.  Kia rose 0.7 percent, erasing the earlier loss, to 69,600
won at 1:08 p.m. in Seoul. Hyundai gained 0.2 percent to 228,500
won.  Hyundai has halted output of some  diesel engines  at a plant
in Ulsan, the company said in an e-mail today. Vehicle
production has not been affected because the automaker has an
inventory of engines, the Seoul-based company said.  Kia suspended output of its diesel Carnival minivan as of
the night shift on May 20 because of the parts supply disruption,
according to an e-mail from the automaker.  Workers at Yoosung, a South Korean maker of diesel vehicle
parts, seek changes in working hours and the salary system,
according to the statement from the manufacturers’ association.  To contact the reporter on this story:
