PPR (PP)  SA has hired Rothschild & Cie. to
arrange so-called staple financing that could be used by
private-equity firms to fund a buyout of online retailer
 Redcats , according to two people with knowledge of the matter.  PPR has started work on the sale of the fashion and home-
furnishings unit, which is slated for the second half of 2011,
said the people, who asked not to be identified because the
matter is confidential. Redcats has an enterprise value, equal
to the sum of its stock and debt minus cash, of 1.35 billion
euros ($1.9 billion) and is seen as an ideal target for private-
equity investors, according to Sanford C. Bernstein.  PPR, based in Paris, plans to dispose of Redcats as well as
the Fnac electronics and media chain to focus on its luxury
division, which includes Gucci, and a sports and lifestyle unit
headed by Puma. The company plans to hire bankers in the coming
weeks to sell at least one of the assets, Chief Executive
Officer Francois-Henri Pinault said in a May 2 interview.  Redcats, whose brands include La Redoute and OneStopPlus,
reported sales of 3.43 billion euros ($4.8 billion) in 2010 and
so-called recurring operating income of 165 million euros.  Staple financing is a pre-arranged funding package offered
to potential bidders in order to make an acquisition.  To contact the reporter on this story:
