The installation of new photovoltaic
panels in  Germany , the world’s biggest solar power producer,
likely peaked last year, Deutsche Bank AG said.  German developers probably will plug in 3.5 gigawatts of
new solar generators each year over this decade compared with
7.4 gigawatts in 2010, the bank said in a research report
published on its website.  “We expect that the rate of growth will slow from the
hyperbolic 2008-2010 period, but that Germany is still set to
remain one of the dominant solar energy markets for at least the
next 10 years,” Deutsche Bank’s Global Head of Climate Change
Mark Fulton wrote in the report. “Growth in 2010 likely
represented the peak.”  German officials are reducing subsidies for solar power as
they press manufacturers to cut the cost of harnessing energy
from the sun. Photovoltaic power may supply more than 7 percent
of the country’s electricity by 2020 as  Chancellor Angela Merkel 
looks to phase out nuclear generators.  To contact the reporter on this story:
