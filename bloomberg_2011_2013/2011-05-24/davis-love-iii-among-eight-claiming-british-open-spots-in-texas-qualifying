U.S. Ryder Cup captain  Davis Love III 
is among eight golfers earning a spot in the British Open at
final international qualifying event in America.  England ’s Brian Davis shot 6-under-par 66 yesterday to win
the event at Gleneagles Country Club in Plano, Texas, by one
shot over Chad Campbell. Play was cut to 18 holes from 36
because severe thunderstorms caused a six-hour suspension to
play.  Sergio Garcia  withdrew because of an infected fingernail on
his left hand that made it difficult to grip the club. The
Spaniard can still qualify through U.S. PGA Tour events leading
up to the Open, which will be played July 14-17 at Royal St.
Georges in England.  Love shot 66 to earn a 25th consecutive start at golf’s
oldest major championship. His best finish in the tournament was
a tie for fourth at Royal St. Georges in 2003.  Nathan Green, Spencer Levin, Chris Tidland and Bob Estes
all matched Love to qualify from the 78-player field. The final
place went to Jerry Kelly, who won a playoff with Justin Hicks,
Brandt Snedeker, Marc Leishman, D.A. Points and Chris DiMarco,
after all finished 3-under.  To contact the reporter on this story:
