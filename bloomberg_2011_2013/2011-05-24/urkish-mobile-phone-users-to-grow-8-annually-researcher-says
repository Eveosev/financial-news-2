Turkey  will have a compound annual
growth rate of 8 percent in its mobile-phone subscribers from
2011 through 2014, a market-research company said.  The mobile penetration rate, or the ratio of mobile
subscribers in the population in the country, will exceed 108
percent by the end of 2014 from 85 percent at the end of 2010,
Dublin-based Research & Markets predicted in a  report  on its
website. Turkey’s mobile penetration was 83.7 percent at the end
of the first quarter, according to the country’s
 telecommunications regulator .  Turkcell Iletisim Hizmetleri AS, Turkey’s biggest mobile-
phone operator, had a subscriber market share of 54 percent at
the end of the first quarter, according to the regulator.
Turkcell competes with  Vodafone Group Plc (VOD) ’s Turkish unit, which
had a market share of 27 percent, and Avea Iletisim Hizmetleri
AS, a unit of  Turk Telekomunikasyon AS (TTKOM) , which controlled 19
percent of the country’s mobile users, the regulator said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
