European jet fuel imports are poised
to increase this month before the start of peak summer travel
season, according to reports from three shipbrokers including
Delhi-based Interocean Shipping.  About 1.6 million tons of  aviation fuel  were shipped or
provisionally booked to sail to the region from the Middle East
or  India  this month, compared with 1.2 million tons in April,
according to the reports.  Stockpiles of the product in independent storage at
 Europe â€™s Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp oil-trading hub fell to the
lowest level in more than two years last week, according to
Netherlands-based researcher PJK International BV. Inventories
dropped 7 percent to 491,000 tons in the week to May 19, the
least since October 2008.  The following table list a selection of ships scheduled or
provisionally booked in April to carry jet fuel to Europe from
