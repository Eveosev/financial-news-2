Putnam Investments LLC Chief
Executive Officer Robert L. Reynolds urged lawmakers to reject
any plan to cut the U.S. budget that would cap or eliminate tax
incentives for workers to save for retirement.  “We absolutely need to take steps to balance the federal
budget,” Reynolds said today in a speech to the Greater Boston
Chamber of Commerce, according to excerpts of a prepared text.
“But nothing we do to achieve national solvency should come at
the expense of personal solvency.”  Congressional Republicans and the Obama administration have
been trading proposals for reducing the government’s debt, which
is approaching the statutory limit of $14.3 trillion. The tax
deferral on contributions to 401(k)s and similar retirement
savings plans costs the federal government $118 billion
annually, according to data from the  Tax Policy Center  and the
Joint Committee on Taxation.  Reynolds said reducing the amount workers can save without
paying taxes would hurt low- and middle-income people the most.
He said workers earning less than $100,000 annually received 62
percent of all retirement-related tax expenditures.  Putnam managed about $130 billion as of April 30. It also
administers retirement assets worth about $20 billion, Jon
Goldstein, a spokesman for the Boston-based company, said in an
e-mail.  To contact the reporter on this story:
