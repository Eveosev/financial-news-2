The National Basketball Association
players union filed an unfair labor practice charge alleging
that the league failed to bargain in good faith with a contract
expiring next month.  The complaint, filed with the  New York  office of the
 National Labor Relations Board , accuses the NBA of “making
harsh, inflexible and grossly regressing ‘takeaway’ demands”
while negotiating a new collective bargaining agreement without
offering reasonable concessions to the players.  The league also bypassed the union to deal directly with
players and threatened an unlawful lockout, the  National
Basketball Players Association  said in an e-mailed news release,
citing the complaint.  The NBA’s collective bargaining agreement with its players
expires on June 30.  “There is no merit to the charge filed today by the
players association with the  National Labor Relations Board , as
we have complied -- and will continue to comply -- with all of
our obligations under the federal  labor laws ,” the NBA said in
an e-mailed statement responding to the charge. “It will not
distract us from our efforts to negotiate in good faith a new
collective bargaining agreement with the players association.”  The charge also accuses the NBA of refusing to provide
financial information relevant to the negotiations and of
threatening union employees that the NBA will force them to pay
for the cost of a lockout with harsher negotiating demands.  To contact the reporter on this story:
