Russian stocks rebounded from their
lowest in almost six months after crude advanced on speculation
unrest in the Middle East will reduce supply and Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. increased its oil price forecast.  The Micex Index of 30 stocks gained 1.6 percent to 1,598.82
by the 6:45 p.m. close in Moscow, paring yesterday’s 1.9 percent
slide. OAO Rosneft,  Russia ’s biggest oil producer, and OAO
Gazprom, the country’s gas export monopoly, both rallied more
than 2.5 percent. OAO Sberbank, Russia’s largest bank, rose 2.2
percent. The dollar-denominated RTS Index added 2 percent to
1,800.04.  Crude for July delivery rose as much as $2.39 to $100.09 a
barrel in  New York  after Goldman and Morgan Stanley increased
their oil-price forecasts as conflict in Libya prolonged the
loss of output. U.S. inventories probably dropped last week,
according to a Bloomberg News survey before an Energy Department
report tomorrow.  The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries will
“very likely” raise production to make up for an estimated 1.5
million barrels a day shut in by  Libya ’s civil unrest, Morgan
Stanley analysts said today.  Goldman, which correctly advised investors to sell crude
oil and copper last month before a price slump, boosted its 12-
month prediction for  Brent crude  to $130 a barrel from $107,
analysts led by  Jeffrey Currie  said in a report today.  Morgan Stanley raised its Brent estimate by 20 percent to
average $120 a barrel this year.  Taking Heart  Rosneft jumped 2.8 percent to 228.06 rubles as Goldman
analysts increased its recommendation to “buy” from
“neutral,” citing potential tax relief.  “Russia and crude have both taken heart from a revision to
Goldman Sachs’ oil estimates as OPEC’s spare capacity is eaten
up by continued supply disruptions from Libya and elsewhere,”
Julian Rimmer, a trader of Russian shares at CF Global Trading
in  London , said in e-mailed comments today.  Russian stocks have slumped 8.2 percent this month as
global commodity prices fell. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index
has dropped 6.8 percent over the same period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
