AS Premia Foods, the largest Baltic
frozen-food producer, said its first-quarter loss widened
because of plant relocation costs and dwindling fish stocks.  The net loss rose to 1.98 million euros ($3.2 million) from
1.1 million euros a year earlier, the Tallinn-based company said
today. Revenue rose 11 percent to 16.7 million euros.  Selling expenses rose 28 percent from a year earlier to 3.8
million euros and administrative costs increased 44 percent to
1.1 million euros, Premia said.  Relocation of the companyâ€™s production unit in  St.
Petersburg ,  Russia , raised costs by 280,000 euros and decreasing
fish stocks reduced earnings by 700,000 euros, Premia said. It
raised prices for customers in the Baltic countries at the start
of the quarter because of higher raw material prices.  To contact the reporter on this story:
