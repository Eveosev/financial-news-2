Wheat and cotton crops in  Texas  are
in an “extremely dire” situation, as soil moisture remains
short even after recent rains, according to an agricultural
program at Texas A&M University in  College Station .  “In most areas, wheat grown for grain has been lost or
yields severely reduced,” the university’s AgriLife Extension
Service said today in an e-mailed  statement . Cotton crops have
“largely failed” in south Texas, and “plantings are at risk”
in central areas, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
