Dagong Global Credit Rating Co., one
of  China ’s official ratings firms, cut its credit ranking for
the U.K. citing the nation’s deteriorating ability to repay
debt, the company said in an e-mailed statement today.  Beijing-based Dagong lowered the nation’s rating by one
level to A+, its fifth highest, with a negative outlook, the
statement said. It ranks China three grades higher at AA+.  “The downgrade reflects the true status of the
deteriorating debt repayment capability of the U.K.,” the
company said in its statement.  The nation’s deficit will remain at a high level, it said.
The company forecasts the economy will grow by 1.3 percent next
year and 1.5 percent the year after, the statement said.  “The U.K. government has adopted measures and policies to
actively cut fiscal expenditures; however its effect is offset
by the complicated social problems, continuous high inflation
and relatively low economic growth,” it said.  The firm reduced its rating on the U.S. to A+ from AA on
Nov. 10, citing a deteriorating intent and ability to repay
debt.  -- Henry Sanderson . Editors: Hugh Chow, Ed Johnson  To contact Bloomberg News staff on this story:
