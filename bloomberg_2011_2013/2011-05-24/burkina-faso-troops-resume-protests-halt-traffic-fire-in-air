Soldiers in  Burkina Faso ’s National
Guard protested yesterday in the capital, Ougadougou, shooting
in the air and blocking traffic.  “They begin shooting at about 8 p.m. and stopped at 9
p.m.,” said Nelson Congo, a witness, by phone yesterday.  Burkina Faso,  Africa ’s biggest cotton producer, has been in
turmoil since February, when five people were killed during
demonstrations against the police following the death of a
student in their custody. Soldiers in the West African nation
mutinied last month, forcing President Blaise Compaore, who has
ruled the country since seizing power in a coup in 1987, to
dissolve the government and fire the head of his presidential
guard and the chiefs of the army, air force and police.  “The government is making an effort to negotiate with
every sector of our society and we are very surprised by this
new shooting,” Minister of Communications Alain Edouard Traore
told reporters yesterday in Ouagadougou. It wasn’t clear what
the soldiers are demanding, he said.  In other demonstrations, students protested in support of
striking teachers today, burning the local office of the ruling
Congress for Democracy and Progress party in Gaoua, 400
kilometers (248 miles) southwest of Ouagadougou, said resident
Sie Kambou by phone. They also marched in Bobo Dioulasso, the
second-biggest city, and in Ouagadougou, according to residents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
