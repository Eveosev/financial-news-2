Police in Somalia detained two
Americans, two Britons and two Kenyans at the airport in the
capital, Mogadishu, after they arrived carrying $3.6 million,
 Somalia Report  said, citing police spokesman Abdullahi Hassan
Barise.  The six were arrested after making an unscheduled landing
at the Aden Adde International Airport, possibly to refuel, the
Nairobi-based online  news agency  said on its website today.
Police donâ€™t know where the planes departed from, it said.  At least two ships held by pirates off the coast of Somalia
are due to receive ransom money following negotiations for their
release, the agency said, citing unidentified sources.  To contact the reporter on this story:
