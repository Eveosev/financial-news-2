Stefan Nilsson, the executive
director of capital introduction at JPMorgan Securities Japan
Co., resigned from the U.S. bank’s Japan prime brokerage
business this month.  Nilsson, 37, said he finished three months of gardening
leave this month and has not decided on the next job. In 2006,
Nilsson joined Bear Stearns, which was later bought by JPMorgan.

and introduce them to potential investors as part of the prime
brokerage business, which provides services such as stock- and
cash-lending, and trade clearing.  To contact the reporters on this story:
