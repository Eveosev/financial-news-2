European Union regulators will
investigate whether Hungarian low-cost airline Wizz Air Ltd.’s
agreements with  Romania ’s Timosoara airport gave the carrier an
unfair advantage that forced out a rival company.  The European Commission said it will also probe Romanian
state subsidies for the country’s “loss-making” regional
airports. Regulators approved state investment aid for airports
in Cardiff in the U.K. and Friuli Venezia Guilia in  Italy .  To contact the reporter on this story:
