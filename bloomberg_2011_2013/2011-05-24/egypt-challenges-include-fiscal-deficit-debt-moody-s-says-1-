Egypt  faces challenges including
stretched public finances and high public debt, Moody’s
Investors Service said today after earlier cutting its ratings
on the North African nation’s debt.  “Egypt suffers from deep-seated political, socio-economic
challenges,” Moody’s said in a statement. “These include
chronic high rate of unemployment, elevated inflation,
widespread poverty.”  Moody’s on March 16 downgraded Egypt’s foreign and local
currency government bond ratings by one notch to Ba3 from Ba2.
The outlook on these ratings remains negative.  “Public finances in Egypt, already stretched, are
significantly weaker than Ba rating peers,” Moody’s said.  Countering the negative trends, Egypt has a relatively
diversified economy, is a small net exporter of hydrocarbons,
retains a significant level of foreign exchange reserves and
most government debt is denominated in local currency and held
by domestic creditors, Moody’s said.  Financial support from “well-disposed” donors, especially
the U.S., and discussions with the  International Monetary Fund 
concerning a possible loan package also support Egypt’s ratings,
Moody’s said.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
