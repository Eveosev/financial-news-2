Plains Midstream Canada LP expects to
reopen the portion of its Rainbow pipeline in  Alberta  that
transports oil from Nipisi to  Edmonton  today.  The process of restarting the 24-inch diameter line, which
was shut last week after wildfires cut power to the crude line,
has begun, said Rina Blacklaws, a Plains Midstream spokeswoman.  “I’m still waiting to hear that it’s actually started, but
we are expecting it for today,” she said.  A 20-inch diameter segment of the Rainbow pipeline that
runs from Zama to Nipisi remains shut after an April 29 leak
spilled 28,000 barrels of crude. The 220,000-barrel-a-day line
will be restarted pending regulatory approval.  Plains will resume full-scale operations at the clean-up
site at 7 a.m. tomorrow, Blacklaws said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
