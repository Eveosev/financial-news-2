Grain planting in  Canada  is about 53
percent complete, trailing the normal pace of 75 percent at this
time of year, the Canadian Wheat Board said.  Temperatures that were as much as 5 degrees Celsius above
normal allowed farmers to “make significant headway,” the
board said today in a  statement  on its website. Planting is
“nearing completion” in  Alberta . Farmers in southern
Saskatchewan and Manitoba still “are struggling to get crops in
the ground,” after storms brought as much as 6.5 centimeters
(2.6 inches) of rain over the weekend, the board said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
