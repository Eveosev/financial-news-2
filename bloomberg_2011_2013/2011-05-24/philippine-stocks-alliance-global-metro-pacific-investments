Shares of the following companies had
unusual moves in Philippine trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of noon in Manila.  The Philippine Stock Exchange Index fell 0.9 percent to
4,227.08, closing at the lowest level since May 6.  Mining companies:  Atlas Consolidated Mining & Development (AT) 
Corp fell 2.7 percent to 17.12 pesos, the sharpest loss
since April 7, after copper prices sank.  Philex Mining Corp. (PX)  , the nation’s largest metals producer, decreased 2.7 percent
to 19.08 pesos, the steepest retreat since May 17.  Copper futures plunged 3.2 percent in  New York  yesterday,
the biggest loss for a most-active contract since May 11.  Alliance Global Group Inc. (AGI)  , which has investments
in property development and casino, tumbled 3.8 percent to 10.78
pesos, the lowest close since Oct. 20. The stock was lowered to
“underperform” from “buy” by Leo Venezuela, analyst at CLSA
Asia Pacific Markets.  Its 12-month share-price estimate was reduced to 12.44
pesos from 14.74 pesos by  Venezuela , who cut earnings estimates
for the company’s casino venture due to weaker-than-expected
gaming revenue and the entry of competition.  Metro Pacific Investments Corp. (MPI)  , which has
investments in tollroad, water and energy distribution, fell 1.8
percent to 3.36 pesos, the lowest level since March 31.  Metro
Pacific Tollways Corp. (TOL)  , a unit of the company, said it
agreed to review in 60 days a contract awarded by Bases
Conversion and Development Authority for the company to manage
the Subic-Clark-Tarlac Expressway, a stock exchange filing
showed. The government wants the contract, awarded in November,
terminated, the filing showed. Shares of Metro Pacific Tollways
weren’t traded.  To contact the reporter on this story:
