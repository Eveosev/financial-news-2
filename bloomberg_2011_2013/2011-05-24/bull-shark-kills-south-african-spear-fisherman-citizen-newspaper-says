A 28-year old South African spear
fisherman was attacked by a bull shark near Leven Point on  South
Africa â€™s north east coast and later died of his injuries, the
Citizen reported, without saying where it got the information.  The bull shark, known locally as a Zambezi shark, was
pursuing a fish caught by the fisherman, Warren Smart, before it
attacked him, the Johannesburg-based newspaper said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
