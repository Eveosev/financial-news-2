The cost of insuring Japanese
corporate and sovereign bonds against non-payment rose,
according to traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx  Japan  index climbed 1 basis point to
124.5 basis points as of 9:11 a.m. in Tokyo, according to
Citigroup Inc. The index is headed for its highest since April
21, according to data provider CMA.  Five-year swaps on Japanese government debt increased 1
basis point to 85, Citigroup prices show. Thatâ€™s on course for
its highest since April 19, CMA data show.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index fell 0.25 basis point to
111.25 basis points as of 10:09 a.m. in Sydney, Credit Agricole
CIB prices show. The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 50 investment-
grade borrowers outside Japan decreased half a basis point to
111 basis points as of 8:09 a.m. in  Singapore , according to
Credit Agricole.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
investors in bonds against default, and traders use them to
speculate on  credit quality . A drop signals improving
perceptions of creditworthiness.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
