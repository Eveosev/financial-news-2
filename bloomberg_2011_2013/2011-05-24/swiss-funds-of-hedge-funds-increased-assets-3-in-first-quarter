Swiss funds of  hedge funds , which
suffered losses to  Bernard Madoff ’s  Ponzi scheme , reported a 3
percent increase in assets under management in the first
quarter, according to the Zurich University of Applied Sciences.  Assets rose to $12 billion by March 31 from about $11.65
billion three months earlier, according to a report published
today by the university’s Centre for Alternative Investments and
Risk Management.  “The stabilization of the asset base suggests the doors
are open for growth again,” said Regina Anhorn, co-author of
the study. “There was a significant restructuring process in
the industry after the financial crisis and the Madoff affair.”  Union Bancaire Privée, Banco Santander SA’s Optimal
Investment Services and Notz, Stucki & Cie. are among at least
seven Geneva-based firms that suffered $7 billion of losses from
the Madoff fraud.  Switzerland  has more than 30 percent of the
global funds of funds industry, even as the number of registered
distributors in the country fell to 181 at the end of 2010 from
224 a year earlier, according to the report.  Geneva’s banks helped pioneer the model, where managers
invest in outside funds as opposed to directly in the markets,
in the 1960s.  Madoff is serving a 150-year sentence in a federal prison
in  North Carolina  after admitting he directed the biggest Ponzi
scheme in history. At the time of his arrest, his account
statements reflected 4,900 accounts with $65 billion in
nonexistent balances.  To contact the reporter on this story:
