South Africa  culled 10,000 ostriches
and may need to slaughter more to contain an outbreak of avian
flu in the Western Cape province that has affected an area
covering 70 percent of the ostrich industry, the Department of
Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries said.  No movement of ostriches is allowed in the Klein Karoo
valley except to the abattoir for controlled slaughter, the
ministry said in an e-mailed statement today.  “The impact in the Klein Karoo valley is quite serious as
this is the hub of ostrich production and the economy of the
area is based on this,” it said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
