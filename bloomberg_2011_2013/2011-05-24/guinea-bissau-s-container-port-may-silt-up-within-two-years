Guinea-Bissau,  Africa ’s fifth biggest
exporter of cashew nuts, may lose its primary container port
within two years as sediment builds up, said an official from
the World Bank.  Water levels at the capital city port, Bissau, are becoming
too shallow for  container ships , World Bank Liaison Officer
Carmen Pereira said in an interview in Bissau on May 20.  “It’s not going to take much time before it becomes
unnavigable,” Pereira said. “There’s hasn’t been one dredging
of any single river since the early 70s.”  The port of Guinea-Bissau, a West African state of 1.7
million people, competes with the neighboring ports of Banjul,
Gambia and Dakar,  Senegal , where unloading costs are one third
less due to better infrastructure, Pereira said. Bissau handles
85 percent of the country’s exports and 95 percent of imports,
according to a  World Bank  report.  Built to handle ships holding 5,000 containers, the port
currently manages ships with 20,000. Most of the country’s fuel
is now trucked across more than 400 kilometers (249 miles) from
the port of Dakar, the report added.  The government has expressed an interest in pursuing a
public-private partnership to manage the port with the
International Finance Corp., a branch of the World Bank.  The state is also working with Angolan mining company
 Bauxite Angola  to build a port at Buba to the south of Bissau,
Pereira said. The depth of the port and its distance from the
capital mean it may not be a substitute for Bissau, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
