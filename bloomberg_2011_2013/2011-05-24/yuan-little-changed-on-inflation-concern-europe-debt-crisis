China ’s yuan was little changed as
speculation policy makers will allow gains to curb inflation was
offset by signs that  Europe ’s sovereign-debt crisis is
worsening.  China’s monetary tightening may continue into the third
quarter as inflation will likely peak around the middle of the
year,  Ba Shusong , a researcher at the State Council’s
Development Research Center, wrote in the Economic Information
Daily today. Standard & Poor’s cut  Italy ’s credit-rating outlook
to negative from stable on May 20, and Spanish Prime Minister
Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero’s Socialist party suffered losses
in local elections amid a backlash over austerity measures.  “Investors still anticipate currency appreciation, given
the high inflation,” said Kenix Lai, a foreign-exchange analyst
at Sun Hung Kai Securities Ltd. in Hong Kong. “However,  market
sentiment  remains poor as even the credit outlook of Italy was
questioned.”  The yuan traded at 6.5028 per dollar as of 10:18 a.m. in
 Shanghai , compared with 6.5050 yesterday, according to the China
Foreign Exchange Trade System. The currency reached 6.4892 on
April 29, the strongest level since 1993.  The People’s Bank of China set its reference rate 0.06
percent weaker at 6.5038 per dollar. The yuan isn’t allowed to
move more than 0.5 percent either side of the daily fixing.  Consumer Prices  Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards traded at 6.3965 per
dollar, compared with 6.3960 yesterday. The contracts reflected
a 1.7 percent premium over the spot rate, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  In  Hong Kong ’s offshore market, China’s currency gained
0.06 percent to 6.5025 per dollar.  The nation should get used to price increases of between 5
percent and 10 percent for an extended period of time, the
official Xinhua News Agency reported on May 22, citing Wang
Jian, secretary general of the National Development and Reform
Commission’s China Society of Macroeconomics.  Consumer prices rose 5.3 percent in April from a year
earlier following a 5.4 percent increase in March that was the
biggest since July 2008. The government aims to limit inflation
to 4 percent this year. A stronger currency helps tame inflation
by reducing the cost of imports.  To contact the reporter on this story:
