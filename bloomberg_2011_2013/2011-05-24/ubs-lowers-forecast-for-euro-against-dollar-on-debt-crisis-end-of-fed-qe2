UBS AG, the third-biggest currency
trader, cut its one-month forecast for the euro against the
dollar, citing the deepening European sovereign-debt crisis and
the end of the  Federal Reserve ’s asset purchases.  “We expect the euro to stay under pressure for longer,”
currency strategists including  Geoffrey Yu  in London wrote in a
client report yesterday. “A quick return in confidence seems
unlikely in the current environment, especially with growth
momentum in larger euro-zone member states also showing
weakness. The Fed will end QE2 as planned, and officials appear
to have set a high hurdle for any further easing.”  UBS cut its one-month forecast to $1.40 from $1.48. The 17-
nation currency was at $1.4069 as of 6:38 a.m. in London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
