Zambia  will allow  Barrick Gold Corp. (ABX) 
to buy the Lumwana copper mine as part of a C$7.3 billion ($7.5
billion) takeover of  Equinox Minerals Ltd. (EQN) , the mines minister
said, adding management plans to tie up the deal this weekend.  “We, as government, will not stand in Barrick’s way,”
Mines and Minerals Minister Maxwell Mwale said today in a phone
interview from Lusaka. “Lumwana is an attractive mine and they
have won the bid to buy it, so we can only give them all the
support they need. I’m informed that Barrick’s directors will be
arriving in Lusaka this weekend to finalize the transaction.”  Zambia, the largest African copper producer, will increase
output to 2 million metric tons a year by 2015 as prices more
than doubled since 2009, Finance Minister  Situmbeko Musokotwane 
said in April. The nation produced 819,159 tons last year, up 17
percent, according to the Bank of Zambia. The nation’s antitrust
agency is studying the proposed purchase of Equinox by Barrick.  “The decision will be made soon,” Brian Lingela, a
spokesman for the Competition and Consumer Protection
Commission, said by phone from Lusaka, capital of Zambia, which
earns about 70 percent of its foreign currency from copper.  Barrick is the world’s biggest gold producer.  “Several department heads are there to begin preliminary
internal discussions on integration,” Andy Lloyd, a spokesman
for the company in Toronto, said by e-mail today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
