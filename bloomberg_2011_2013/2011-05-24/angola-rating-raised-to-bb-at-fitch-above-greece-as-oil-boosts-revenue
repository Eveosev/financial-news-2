Angola ’s long-term foreign-currency
rating was raised one step above Greece’s by Fitch Ratings as
higher  oil prices  boost state revenue and debt arrears decline.  The southern African nation’s assessment of BB-, equal to
Gabon’s, is Fitch’s third-highest junk rating and one level
above Greece’s B+. The outlook on the rating is stable, Fitch
said in a statement today.  The upgrade reflects a “strengthened macro-policy
framework” under Angola’s International Monetary Fund program,
 Veronica Kalema , a director in Fitch’s sovereign group, wrote in
the statement. Higher oil prices boosted income and arrears on
debt to contractors were reduced further in the first quarter of
this year, allowing foreign reserves to increase.  Angola, sub-Saharan  Africa ’s second-biggest oil producer
after Nigeria, has a $1.4 billion loan facility with the IMF and
has cut debt to contractors that helped rebuild the country
following two decades of civil war.  “Angola’s rating remains supported by the country’s
substantial natural resources endowment, a strong growth record
as a result of rising oil production and high public investment
since 2004 and moderate public and external debt ratios,” Fitch
said.  The southern African nation intends to sell its debut
dollar bond of $500 million in September, Finance Minister
Carlos Alberto Lopes said on April 20.  To contact the reporter on this story:
