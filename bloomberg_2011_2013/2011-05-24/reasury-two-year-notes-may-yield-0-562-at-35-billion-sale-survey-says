The Treasury Department’s $35 billion
sale of two-year notes may draw a yield of 0.562 percent,
according to the average forecast in a Bloomberg News survey of
nine of the  Federal Reserve ’s 20 primary dealers.  The securities, which mature in May 2013, yielded 0.570
percent in pre-auction trading. Bids are due by 1 p.m. New York
time.  The size of the offering is the same as at the past seven
sales of the maturity after peaking at $44 billion in auctions
from October 2009 through April 2010.  Last month’s two-year note sale drew a yield of 0.673
percent. The record low yield of 0.40 percent was reached at the
October auction.  The April 26 offering’s bid-to-cover ratio, which gauges
demand by comparing the amount bid with the amount offered, was
3.06, versus an average of 3.38 for the past 10 auctions.  Indirect bidders, a class of investors that includes
foreign central banks, bought 37.9 percent of the notes at the
April auction, compared with an average of 33.1 percent for the
past 10 sales.  Direct bidders, non-primary-dealer investors that place
their bids directly with the Treasury, purchased 13.4 percent of
the notes at the last offering, compared with the 10-auction
average of 13.5 percent.  Two-year notes have returned 0.6 percent this year, after
gaining 2.3 percent in 2010, according to Bank of America
Merrill Lynch indexes. The overall Treasury market has returned
2.1 percent this year after rising 5.9 percent last year.  The Fed’s primary dealers trade  government securities  with
the central bank and are obligated to participate in Treasury
auctions.  Today’s offering is the first of three sales of U.S. notes
this week totaling $99 billion. The Treasury will sell $35
billion of five-year debt tomorrow and $29 billion of seven-year
securities on May 26.  To contact the reporter on this story:
