Mauritius is considering importing
35,000 metric tons of raw sugar a year rather than refined
product for local consumption to boost refiners, said Jean-Noel
Humbert, chief executive officer of the Mauritius Sugar
Syndicate.  “We want to take full advantage of the industrial capacity
of local refiners, namely Flacq United Estates Ltd. and Omnicane
Ltd.,” Humbert said by phone today from  Port Louis , the
capital. The plan “is still at an early stage,” he said.  The Indian Ocean Island nation,  Africa ’s fifth-largest
sugar producer, exports all of its own output and imports
refined sugar to meet local demand. The Sugar Syndicate is
responsible for the country’s trade in sugar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
