U.S. Senator Chuck Grassley asked the
Securities and Exchange Commission for information relating to
its stock-trading inquiry into hedge fund SAC Capital Partners
LP.  In a letter sent today, Grassley of  Iowa , the senior
Republican on the Judiciary Committee, asked SEC chairman  Mary Schapiro  to explain how the regulator has handled allegations of
suspicious trading. Grassley’s office has said he has received
about 20 examples from the Financial Industry Regulatory
Authority of possible insider trading involving SAC Capital.  His letter asks the SEC how it resolved the referrals, how
the number of referrals compares to similar firms, and whether
the agency drafted a Wells Notice related to the situation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
