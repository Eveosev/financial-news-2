Tunisia’s interim government rejected
a proposal to delay the first national elections in the North
African nation since a popular uprising forced its president
from power, Tayeb Baccouche, the government’s spokesman, said.  “The transitional government confirmed that balloting for
a national constituent assembly will be on July 24 despite calls
from the election committee for a delay until October,”
Baccouche told reporters in Tunis today.  Kamel Jandoubi, the head of the electoral commission, had
proposed postponing the elections until October 16, saying there
was not enough time to ensure transparent elections.  Tunisia’s caretaker government is trying to bring stability
to the North African country, where protests over unemployment,
high food prices and political repression forced President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali from power on Jan. 14.  To contact the reporter on this story:
