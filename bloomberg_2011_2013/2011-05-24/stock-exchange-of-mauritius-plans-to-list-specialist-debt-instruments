The Stock Exchange of Mauritius will
introduce trading of Eurobonds, corporate debt and credit notes
issued by local and foreign investors and plans to have 10
listed by the end of the year, Chief Executive Officer Sunil
Benimadhu said.  “It’s in line with our objective of moving away from an
equity-based, domestic exchange to a multiproduct,
internationally oriented exchange,” Benimadhu told reporters
today in Port Louis, the capital. “We are responding to
demands.”  The Indian Ocean island nation’s bourse is the fourth-
biggest in sub-Saharan  Africa  by market value after those in
 South Africa ,  Nigeria  and  Kenya . The exchange started operations
in 1989, and has a 37-member official market and a 56-member
domestic and enterprise market, according to data on its
website.  “All major local companies are listed, and we can add only
about 10 more,” Benimadhu said. The exchange is operating at
“20 to 25 percent” of its capacity and is therefore able to
handle more listings, he said.  Listing of debt instruments that are aimed at banks, funds
and asset managers puts the Mauritian bourse on par with the
Irish Stock Exchange and the Luxembourg Stock Exchange, with the
“local advantages of trading in dollars, euros and pounds,
albeit cheaper,” Benimadhu said. New rules have been introduced
to favor such listings, he said.  “On international markets, such fund-raising starts from
$50 million,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
