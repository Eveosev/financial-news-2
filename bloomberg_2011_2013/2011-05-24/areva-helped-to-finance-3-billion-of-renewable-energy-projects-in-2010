Areva SA (CEI) , the world’s largest
producer of nuclear equipment, may seek loans to back 3 billion
euros ($4.2 billion) of renewable energy projects this year, the
head of the company’s renewable unit said today.  Europe ’s second-largest developer of offshore wind projects
is “on track” to exceed a record set in 2010, when it arranged
$3 billion of financing for clean-energy projects, mostly in
offshore wind, Anil Srivastava, chief executive of Areva
Renewables, said in an interview in New Delhi today.  The Paris-based company has bid to build its first hybrid
solar plants in India at a  Siemens AG (SIE)  facility in Madhya Pradesh
state and another site operated by a private coal operator in
Gujarat state, Srivastava added. Hybrid plants produce power
from a combination of fossil fuels and solar energy, helping to
reduce emissions and lower consumption of natural gas and coal.  Areva operates a pilot 3-megawatt solar-coal hybrid plant
in Liddell, Australia. India, along with  South Africa , is among
the largest potential markets in the world for such technology,
Srivastava said after attending the Euromoney Renewable Energy
Finance Forum in New Delhi.  To contact the reporter on this story:
