A Greek labor union threatened
strikes after the government said it may sell its holdings in
the country’s two biggest ports.  The government is looking at selling its entire holdings in
 Piraeus Port Authority (PPA)  SA and  Thessaloniki Port Authority SA (OLTH)  by
the end of the year and will seek buyers for between 43 percent
and 66 percent of other ports in which it has stakes in 2012 and
2013, the  Finance Ministry  said yesterday.  “The total sell-off of all profitable public companies is
an incomprehensible and criminal political act,”  Greece ’s Union
of Port Workers said in an e-mailed statement today. The union
said it’s ready to take mass action to fight the decision.  The government announced yesterday that it will accelerate
state asset sales and real-estate development to raise 50
billion euros ($70.4 billion) by 2015. Its debt is expected to
reach 166 percent of gross domestic product next year, according
to European Commission estimates released on May 13.  Cosco Pacific Ltd. (1199) , an Asian container terminal operator,
won a 35-year concession in 2009 to run operations at Piraeus
Port’s Pier II and to build and run a third pier.  Piraeus Port Authority reported a first-quarter net loss of
2.9 million euros, compared with a profit a year earlier, as
sales slipped 33 percent. Last year, Piraeus Port had 13.3
million euros in revenue from services provided to Pier II,
according to an  Athens bourse  filing today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
