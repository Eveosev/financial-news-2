South Africa’s stocks increased for
the first day in three, led by  BHP Billiton Plc (BIL) ,  Anglo American
Plc (AGL)  and  Sasol Ltd. (SOL) , as copper, other metals and oil rebounded on
a buy recommendation from Goldman Sachs Group Inc.  The FTSE/JSE Africa All Share Index advanced 180.14, or 0.6
percent to 31,524.67 at 10:25 a.m. in Johannesburg.  BHP
Billiton , the world’s largest mining company, rallied the most
in more than a week, jumping 3.45 rand, or 1.3 percent, to
264.60 rand. Anglo American added as much as 1.2 percent, and
Sasol, the world’s biggest maker of motor fuel from coal,
snapped two days of losses.  Copper gained as much as 1.6 percent to $8,937.75 a metric
ton today, rebounding from yesterday’s 3.1 percent drop, after
Goldman Sachs turned “more bullish” and told investors to buy
oil, copper and zinc as sustained economic growth will tighten
supplies. Oil supplies fell for a second week after flooding
along the  Mississippi River  limited imports and refineries
increased the amount of crude they processed, a Bloomberg News
survey showed. Crude jumped as much as 1.3 percent.  Anglo American rose 2.80 rand, or 0.9 percent, to 325.25
rand. Sasol increased 5.2 percent to 352 rand.  To contact the reporter on this story:
