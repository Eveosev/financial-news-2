London Mayor  Boris Johnson ’s 2011
annual survey found that more police on the capital’s streets
has made residents feel safer, Johnson’s office said in an e-
mailed statement today.  Almost three-quarters -- 73 percent -- of respondents said
that increased police presence has helped reduce crime, and 81
percent said it has helped them feel safer, while 64 percent
said they’re not worried about crime in their neighborhoods,
compared with 54 percent last year, the statement cited the poll
as finding.  To contact the reporter on this story:
