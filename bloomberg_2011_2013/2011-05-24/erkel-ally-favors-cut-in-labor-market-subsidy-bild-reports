German Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s
Free Democratic coalition partner wants to reduce a labor market
subsidy introduced in 2008 during the banking crisis to help
companies keep workers on their books,  Bild  newspaper said.  The FDP wants to reduce the so-called short-time work
facility that’s available to companies to six months from 12
months, the newspaper said, citing lawmaker Johannes Vogel.  The instrument allows companies to keep workers on call
until sales pick up, paying their wages and social security
contributions with the help of Federal Labor Agency aid.  To contact the reporter on this story:
