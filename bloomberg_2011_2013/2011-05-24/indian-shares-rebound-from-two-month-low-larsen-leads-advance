Indian shares rebounded from the
lowest level in two months after a drop in crude prices eased
concern that fuel prices will stoke inflation and as some
investors judged declines as excessive.  Larsen & Toubro Ltd. (LT) , the nation’s largest engineering
company, advanced 2.3 percent.  ICICI Bank Ltd. (ICICIBC) , the country’s
second-biggest lender, rose 1.4 percent. Crude oil declined 2.4
percent yesterday in  New York  as  Europe ’s sovereign debt crisis
deepened, bolstering concern that economic growth in the region
will slow, curbing consumption.  The Bombay Stock Exchange Sensitive Index gained 19.03, or
0.1 percent, to 18,012.36, according to preliminary closing
prices at 3:30 p.m. in Mumbai. The gauge yesterday fell to the
lowest close since March 22. The index swung between gains and
