Oil rose in  New York  as the dollar
declined, boosting commodities’ appeal as an alternative
investment, and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Morgan Stanley
increased their price outlooks for crude.  Futures jumped 1.9 percent as the dollar slipped from a
nine-week high against the euro after German business confidence
unexpectedly stayed near a record in May. Goldman Sachs and
Morgan Stanley raised their estimates for Brent oil futures,
saying the conflict in  Libya  is eating into OPEC spare capacity.  “The dollar’s under pressure,” said  Gene McGillian , an
analyst and broker at Tradition Energy in Stamford,  Connecticut .
“The upward revisions to some of the investment-bank oil
forecasts may be lending a certain positive sentiment to this
market.”  Crude for July delivery rose $1.89 to $99.59 a barrel on
the  New York Mercantile Exchange , the highest settlement since
May 18. Prices have climbed 42 percent in the past year. Futures
have switched direction each day for the past five sessions.  Prices pared gains from the settlement after the  American
Petroleum Institute  reported at 4:30 p.m. that U.S. crude-oil
stockpiles decreased 860,000 barrels to 368.1 million. July oil
rose $1.70, or 1.7 percent, to $99.40 a barrel in electronic
trading at 4:31 p.m.  Brent crude  for July settlement gained $2.43, or 2.2
percent, to $112.53 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures
Europe exchange. Prices are up 58 percent in the past year.  The dollar fell 0.4 percent to $1.4105 per euro at 4:29
p.m. in New York after the German confidence report fueled bets
that the  European Central Bank  will resume boosting borrowing
costs. Yesterday, the dollar touched $1.397 per euro, the
highest level since March 17.  Commodities Rise  Commodities surged after Goldman Sachs said it’s turning
“more bullish” on raw materials, spurring a jump in sugar,
copper, oil and other commodities.  The Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of 19 commodities
advanced as much as 1.2 percent. It was up 0.7 percent at 339.10
at 4:29 p.m. in New York. Twelve of the commodities climbed.  Goldman Sachs raised its three-month outlook for Brent oil
to $115 a barrel, its six-month view to $120 and its 12-month
price estimate to $130. Morgan Stanley increased its average
forecast for Brent this year by 20 percent to $120 a barrel and
by 24 percent for 2012 to $130 a barrel.  “It is only a matter of time until inventories and OPEC
spare capacity will become effectively exhausted, requiring
higher  oil prices  to restrain demand, keeping it in line with
available supplies,” Goldman Sachs analysts led by New York-
based David Greely said in a note e-mailed today.  Libyan Supply  Crude exports from Libya, holder of Africa’s biggest
reserves, slumped 79 percent in March from February, as
political unrest curbed shipments, official data posted on the
Joint Organization Data Initiative website showed May 18.  “Oil fundamentals remain extremely constructive,” Amrita Sen, an analyst at  Barclays Capital  in  London , said in a
Bloomberg television interview with Francine Lacqua. “Libyan
supply is not going to come back to the market anytime soon.”  The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries is
unlikely to increase crude production quotas at its next meeting
June 8 in Vienna, said  Richard Jones , deputy executive director
of the  International Energy Agency , the Paris-based adviser to
28 nations.  “I would be skeptical,” he said today at a press
conference in Brussels. “Knowing OPEC politics, it would be
difficult to make a decision in June.”  The IEA said last week that there is a “clear, urgent need
for additional supplies.” The statement suggests it may
coordinate the release of emergency oil stockpiles if OPEC
doesn’t raise production, the London-based Centre for Global
Energy Studies said in a report yesterday.  U.S. Inventories  U.S. crude-oil inventories probably fell 1.5 million
barrels, or 0.4 percent, in the seven days ended May 20 from
370.3 million the prior week, according to the median of 13
analyst estimates before an Energy Department report tomorrow.
Supplies dropped after flooding along the  Mississippi River 
limited imports and refineries increased the amount of crude
they processed, the survey showed.  “Three times this year we’ve seen crude stocks fall,”
said  Matt Smith , a commodities analyst for Summit Energy
Services Inc. in Louisville,  Kentucky . “We’re not willing to
move down and test the lows we’ve seen around $94 because of
continued supply concerns and intermittent bouts of
bullishness.”  Gasoline supplies probably gained 450,000 barrels last week
from 205.9 million in the prior week, the survey showed.
Consumption of the motor fuel jumped 2.5 percent to 9.05 million
barrels a day during the second week in May, the biggest weekly
increase since April 8.Gasoline demand typically peaks during
the summer months in the U.S.  Gasoline for June delivery rose 5.47 cents, or 1.9 percent,
to settle at $2.9928 a gallon on the Nymex. Futures have
advanced 52 percent in the past year.  Oil volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was 523,203
contracts as of 4:29 p.m. in New York. Volume totaled 493,860
contracts yesterday, the lowest level in three weeks. Open
interest was 1.53 million contracts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
