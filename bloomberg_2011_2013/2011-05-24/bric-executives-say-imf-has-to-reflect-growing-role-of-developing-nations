The International Monetary Fund need
to reform to reflect “the growing role of developing countries
in the world economy,” executive directors representing  Brazil ,
 Russia ,  India ,  China  and  South Africa  in the IMF said in a
letter to the Financial Times.  The convention of choosing by nationality undermines the
fund’s legitimacy and a decision should be taken after broad
consultation with the membership, Russia’s Aleksei Mozhin,
India’s Arvind Virmani, China’s Jianxiong He, South Africa’s
Moeketsi Majoro and Brazil’s Paulo Nogueira Batista Jr. said in
the letter.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
