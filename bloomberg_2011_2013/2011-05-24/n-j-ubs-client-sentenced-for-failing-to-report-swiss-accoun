Former  UBS AG (UBSN)  client Harry Abrahamsen
avoided prison when he was sentenced to three years probation
for concealing more than $1 million in Swiss bank accounts,
federal prosecutors said.  Abrahamsen, who pleaded guilty last year to charges that he
failed to file required Reports of Foreign Bank or Financial
Accounts, or FBARs, from 1999 to 2007, was sentenced today in
federal court in  Newark , New Jersey, U.S. Attorney Paul J. Fishman said in an e-mailed statement. The probation includes 12
months of home confinement.  Abrahamsen’s daughter Lucille Abrahamsen Jackson, 42, was
sentenced to one year of probation yesterday for a similar
offense.  Abrahamsen, of Oradell, New Jersey, and his daughter are
among more than two dozen former UBS clients who pleaded guilty
to tax crimes. Zurich-based UBS avoided U.S. prosecution in
February 2009 by paying $780 million, turning over the names of
U.S. account holders and saying it helped Americans hide assets
from the  Internal Revenue Service .  Jackson, who pleaded guilty in November, said her father
set up a Swiss bank account in her name in 1992 to evade U.S.
taxes. The account’s value reached $759,376 in 2003. Abrahamsen
admitted opening one UBS account in 1992 and a second in 2000
and funding them with about $1.3 million in false and inflated
expenses from his printing business, SJT Imaging Inc.  In addition to probation, U.S. District Judge Dennis Cavanaugh ordered Abrahamsen to pay back more than $600,000 in
taxes, interest and penalties. As part of his guilty plea,
Abrahamsen also agreed to pay an FBAR penalty of more than
$300,000, according to Fishman’s statement.  The case is USA v. Harry Abrahamsen, U.S. District Court,
District of  New Jersey  (Newark).  To contact the reporter on this story:
