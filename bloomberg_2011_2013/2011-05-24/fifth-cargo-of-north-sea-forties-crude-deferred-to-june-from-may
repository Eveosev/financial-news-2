A fifth cargo of North Sea Forties
crude was deferred from the export program for May to June, a
revised shipping schedule obtained by Bloomberg News showed.  The latest shipment to be postponed was originally planned
for May 27 to May 29. The other four cargoes were deferred two
weeks ago and were for loading in three-day periods starting
from May 15, May 20, May 26 and May 29.  Earlier this month, four consignments were dropped from
loading programs for May and June. Forties exports for May will
decline to 18 lots from an originally planned 27 and June
shipments will increase to 25 from 24, the plans showed.  The 220,000 barrel-a-day Buzzard field, the biggest blend
in the Forties crude stream, will be running at a rate of about
80,000 barrels of a day until the cooling system is replaced by
the end of this month, operator Nexen Inc. said May 19.  “We expect to increase production beyond current levels
through June and July and reach full capacity of over 200,000
barrels of oil equivalent a day toward the end of July as
upgraded coolers are installed and commissioning of the fourth
platform is completed,” the company said.  Forties is one of four North Sea crude grades used to price
more than half of global oil. The other blends are Brent,
Ekofisk and Oseberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
