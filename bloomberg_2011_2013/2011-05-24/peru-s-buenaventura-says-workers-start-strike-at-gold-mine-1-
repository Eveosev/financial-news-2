Cia. de Minas Buenaventura SA,  Peru ’s
biggest precious-metals producer, said workers went on strike at
its largest gold mine today seeking better pay.  Peru’s Labor Ministry declared the strike at the Orcopampa
mine illegal and will broker talks between the company and labor
officials this week, Chief Financial Officer Carlos Galvez said.  “The Orcopampa plant has completely halted,” Galvez said
today in a telephone interview. “It’s a shame, because we were
very, very close to reaching an agreement, with a difference of
pennies.”  Miners in Peru, the world’s sixth-largest gold producer,
plan a national strike May 30 to seek a bigger share of record
earnings after both gold and copper rose to records. Copper has
almost doubled in the past two years, while gold reached a
record $1,577.40 an ounce on May 2.  Buenaventura’s American depositary receipts, each
representing one ordinary share, gained for a seventh session,
adding 50 cents, or 1.2 percent, to $41.70 in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading. The share has gained 11 percent in
the past month.  To contact the reporters on this story:
