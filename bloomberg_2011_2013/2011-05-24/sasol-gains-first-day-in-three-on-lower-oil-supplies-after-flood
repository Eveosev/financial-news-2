Sasol Ltd. (SOL) , the worldâ€™s biggest maker
of motor fuel from coal, headed for the biggest gain in two
weeks as flooding in the U.S. sent oil supplies lower.  Sasol snapped two days of losses, jumping 5.16 rand, or 1.5
percent, to 352 rand at 9:58 a.m. in Johannesburg. A close at
that level would be the biggest advance since May 10.  Oil supplies fell for a second week after flooding along
the  Mississippi River  limited imports and refineries increased
the amount of crude they processed, a Bloomberg News survey
showed. U.S. inventories dropped 1.9 million barrels, or 0.5
percent, in the seven days ended May 20 from 370.3 million the
prior week, according to the median of 11 analyst estimates
before an Energy Department report tomorrow in  Washington .  Crude increased as much as 1.3 percent to $98.92 a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
