Australia ’s canola crop may rise to a
record in the 2011-12 marketing year as higher prices spur
expanded planting and European production drops, Oil World said.  Production may climb 15 percent from the prior year to 2.44
million metric tons, Oil World said in a report today, citing
the Australian Oilseeds Federation. The harvest starts in
November, it said. Growers will sow canola, also called
rapeseed, on as much as 1.9 million hectares (4.7 million
acres), up 19 percent, Oil World said.  “The current high world market prices and the prospective
rapeseed crop failure in  Europe  are encouraging Australian
farmers to further expand plantings,” Oil World said.
“Plantings have started with very good subsoil moisture
throughout most of the eastern states, according to the AOF,
while dry conditions still persist in western Australia.”  Rapeseed for November delivery rose for an eighth straight
day today on NYSE Liffe in Paris. The contract surged 54 percent
in the past year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
