The U.K. finance regulator won a
permanent court order preventing a man from committing market
abuse for the first time and fined him 1,094,900 pounds ($1.77
million) for inflating the price of Global Brands Licensing Plc.  Samuel Nathan Kahn, whose Chesteroak Ltd. and Bingen
Investments Ltd. were put into liquidation by the Financial
Services Authority in 2008 after they found that they helped
boiler rooms defraud as many as 800 investors, inflated the
price of GBL last year, the regulator said in  a statement  today.  Kahn “orchestrated and controlled the vast majority of the
trading in GBL’s shares” in March and April of last year by
impersonating other people when he placed orders to hide his
involvement, the FSA said.  “Kahn undertook a month-long campaign of market abuse,
manipulating 85 percent of the buy trades and 91 percent of the
sell trades of GBL for his own financial benefit as well as to
facilitate tax relief fraud and boiler room activities,” said
Tracey McDermott, the FSA’s acting director of enforcement.  At a court hearing last week, FSA lawyer Andrew George told
Judge Guy Newey that Kahn didn’t oppose the injunction barring
him from committing market abuse. Kahn wasn’t at the hearing,
nor was a lawyer for him.  He received the regulator’s standard 30 percent discount on
the fine for cooperating.  “There is ample reason to conclude that Mr. Kahn has in
the past engaged in market abuse and that such behavior will be
repeated in the future,” Newey said at the hearing.  To contact the reporter for this story:
