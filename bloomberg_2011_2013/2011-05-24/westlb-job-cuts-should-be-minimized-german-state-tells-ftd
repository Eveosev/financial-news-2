WestLB AG’s savings bank owners
should minimize job cuts at the lender, Financial Times
Deutschland reported, citing the finance minister of another
shareholder, the German state of North-Rhine Westphalia.  The state expects the savings banks to take a “responsible
attitude” toward staff and not seek an “employment
minimization program,” Norbert Walter-Borjans told the FTD.  To contact the reporter on this story:
