Vale SA (VALE5) , the world’s biggest iron-ore
producer, said it will invest $2.9 billion to increase the
capacity of the Ponta da Madeira terminal in northern  Brazil ,
making it the largest port in the country by volume.  Vale, which last year shipped 294.4 million metric tons of
iron ore and pellets, will increase the terminal’s capacity to
150 million tons next year, the Rio de Janeiro-based company
said  today  in a statement. The expansion will allow the terminal
in the state of Maranho to receive and load two ships at once,
the company said.  “The port will be an alternative to the three major ports
of the South and Southeast regions” of the country, Vale said
in the statement. “Besides handling more  iron ore , Ponta da
Madeira will become an important transport hub for soy and
corn.”  The company loaded its Vale Brasil ship, the world’s
largest ore carrier, for the first time earlier today at the
same terminal, Vale said in a separate  statement . The ship,
which transports 391,000 tons of iron ore, will sail for the
Chinese port of Dalian, it said.  Vale gained 21 centavos, or 0.5 percent, to 43.91 reais in
Sao Paulo trading at 12:43 p.m. New York time. The stock dropped
about 9 percent since the beginning of the year, more than the
9.1 percent decline for the benchmark Bovespa Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
