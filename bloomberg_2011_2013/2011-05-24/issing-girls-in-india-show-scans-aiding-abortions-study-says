India ’s ratio of boy to girl babies
is widening, aided by illegal tests that help parents
selectively abort female fetuses, a study found.  As many as 600,000 girls are selectively aborted annually
in India, compared with as many as 410,000 terminations a decade
ago and 200,000 in 1991, according to a  study  today in the
medical journal  The Lancet.  There are now 914 girls for every
1,000 boys ages 0-6 years, down from 945 per 1,000 20 years ago.  “Selective abortion of girls in India has grown in the
past two decades and accounts for most of the large and growing
imbalance,” Prabhat Jha of the Centre for Global Health
Research at the University of Toronto and colleagues wrote in
the study. “Increases in selective abortion of girls are
probably because of persistent son preference.”  The findings suggest a 1996 ban on testing fetuses to
identify sex is being flouted partly because the financial
incentive for doctors to perform scans is greater than the fines
they face if caught, S.V. Subramanian of the Harvard School of
 Public Health  in  Boston  and Daniel J. Corsi of  McMaster
University  in Hamilton, Ontario, wrote in an accompanying
commentary. The market for sex determination and selective
abortion may be worth at least $100 million annually, they wrote.  “The demand for sons among wealthy parents is being
satisfied by the medical community,” Subramanian and Corsi
wrote. “There is little evidence that the law is accomplishing
its goal,” they said, adding that 800 court cases against
doctors in 17 states have led to only 55 convictions.  Son Demand  The authors assessed sex ratios by birth order in 250,000
deliveries in national surveys from 1990 to 2005 and estimated
selective abortions of girls by assessing the birth cohorts of
children aged 0-6 years in the 1991, 2001, and 2011 censuses.  There were 4.2 million to 12.1 million selective abortions
of girls from 1980 to 2010, the authors estimate. Proportionally
fewer girls are born in urban areas compared with rural regions,
with little differences occurring between Hindu and Muslim
households, they said.  Son preference varies little by education or income, though
selective abortion of girls is more common in educated or
wealthier households, presumably because they can afford
ultrasound and abortion services more readily than uneducated or
poorer households, the authors wrote.  “Recent increases in literacy and Indian per-person income
might have thus contributed to increased selective abortion of
girls,” they said. Women with one of more girls were more
likely to abort a female fetus, the researchers said.  “Our results are consistent with reports that ultrasound
and abortions are far more common in second-order and third-
order births than in firstborns,” they said.  The study received funding from the Fogarty International
Centre of the U.S. National Institutes of Health, the
International Development Research Centre, the Canadian
Institute of Health Research and the Li Ka Shing Knowledge
Institute at St Michael’s Hospital and  University of Toronto .  To contact the reporter on this story:
