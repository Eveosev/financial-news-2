Duke Energy Corp. (DUK) ’s renewable energy
unit picked  Siemens AG (SIE) , Europe’s largest engineering company, to
supply 73 turbines for a 168-megawatt wind farm it is building
in Kansas.  Duke Energy Renewables will begin construction on the
Ironwood Windpower Project in Ford County in late 2011, the
Charlotte, North Carolina-based utility said in a statement
today.  Duke, which will be the biggest U.S. energy utility once
its acquisition of  Progress Energy Inc. (PGN)  is completed at the end
of the year, will own and operate Ironwood and sell the power
and associated renewable energy credits to Topeka-based Westar
Energy Inc. under a 20-year power purchase agreement.  The project is Duke’s first in Kansas and will bring its
total installed wind power capacity to more than 1 gigawatt, it
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
