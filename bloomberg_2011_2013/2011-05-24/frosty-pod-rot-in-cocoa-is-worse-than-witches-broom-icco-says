The frosty pod rot fungus spreading
in Latin American cocoa crops represents a potentially
“enormous” threat, according to the International Cocoa
Organization’s Laurent Pipitone.  The fungus is affecting the crop in  Colombia , Ecuador, the
western part of Venezuela and Peru. It also spread to Central
America and reached  Mexico  in 2005, Pipitone, director of the
economics and statistics division at the ICCO, said today by
phone from London.  “While in a global cocoa context the current annual loss
from frosty pod is small, the potential threat presented by the
disease is enormous,” he said in an earlier e-mail. The fungus
is “more destructive and difficult to control” than black pod
rot and witches’ broom, he added.  The fungus hasn’t yet been detected in Brazil, he said.
Witches’ broom, a fungus that damages the branches of plants,
slashed production by 70 percent over a 10-year period after it
emerged in the country’s Bahia region, the ICCO said on its
 website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
