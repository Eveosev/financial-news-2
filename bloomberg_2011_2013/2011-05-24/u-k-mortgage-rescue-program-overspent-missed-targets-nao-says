A program set up to stop Britons
losing their homes in the recession went over budget and helped
fewer than half the number of people planned, auditors said.  The  Mortgage Rescue Scheme  directly assisted 2,600 families
at a cost of 240 million pounds ($388 million), the National
Audit Office said in a report published in London today. The
program had been expected to help 6,000 households and cost 205
million pounds when it was created by  Gordon Brown ’s Labour
government in 2009.  The government also expected 60 percent of those helped to
take up an option where the state bought a share of their homes.
In the event, only 1.5 percent did so, with the rest choosing to
sell their houses and then rent them back, the NAO said.  The program was one of at least nine announced by the
Labour government during the recession to help people keep their
homes and businesses under the slogan “Real Help Now.” At the
time, lawmakers and lobby groups complained they weren’t
delivering as promised. Labour lost power in the May 2010
general election.  “If the Department for Communities and Local Government
had tested its assumptions properly, it would have been clear
that the Mortgage Rescue Scheme was aiming at the wrong
targets,” said Richard Bacon, a Conservative lawmaker on
Parliament’s Public Accounts Committee, which scrutinizes NAO
reports. “Despite its noble intent, the scheme was far too
costly and future initiatives of this kind must be based upon
solid assumptions and rigorous testing.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
