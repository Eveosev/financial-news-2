Coffee production in  Indonesia , the
world’s third-largest grower, may drop 15 percent this year
because of above-average rainfall in the previous season, a unit
of the U.S. Department of Agriculture said.  Output will fall to 7.885 million bags in the year that
began on April 1 from an estimated 9.305 million a year earlier,
the USDA’s Foreign Agricultural Service said today in a  report 
on its website. Exports will decline 20 percent to 5.925 million
bags, the agency said.  Brazil is the biggest producer, followed by  Vietnam . A bag
weighs 60 kilograms or 132 pounds.  To contact the reporters on this story:
