Sonae (SON)  SGPS SA’s relationship with
 France Telecom SA (FTE)  is “very good,” an official at the
Portuguese company said in a telephone interview.  France Telecom ’s Chief Executive Officer Stephane Richard
said in an interview yesterday that the company is reviewing the
future of its European portfolio, focusing on minority stakes in
Portugal and Austria.  Sonae doesn’t have any first-hand knowledge of this review,
the company official said, adding that it views this with
“maximum tranquillity.” France Telecom owns a 20 percent
holding in Sonae’s telecommunications unit Sonaecom SGPS SA,
which runs Portugal’s smallest mobile-phone company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
