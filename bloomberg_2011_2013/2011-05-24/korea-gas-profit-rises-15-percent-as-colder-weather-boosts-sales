Korea Gas Corp. (036460) , the worldâ€™s biggest
importer of liquefied natural gas, posted a 15 percent gain in
first-quarter profit from a year earlier as colder weather
increased demand for the fuel.  Net income was 417.2 billion won ($381 million) in the
three months ended March 31, compared with 361.7 billion won a
year earlier, the company known as Kogas said in a regulatory
filing today. That compares with the mean estimate of 408
billion won in a survey of 10 analysts compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
