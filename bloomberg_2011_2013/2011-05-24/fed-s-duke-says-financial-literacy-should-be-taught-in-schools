Federal Reserve Governor Elizabeth Duke said that school-age children should be taught financial
literacy concepts to help prepare them for the complicated
financial decisions they’ll need to make later in life.  “It is important that these skills be included in
curriculum and measured in student achievement tests,” Duke
said in remarks prepared for a speech in  Boston  today. “If our
schools can’t spare the resources to provide financial literacy
as a subject unto itself, I believe that the concepts required
for sound financial decision-making should, at a minimum, be
incorporated into existing subject areas.”  Duke didn’t comment on the U.S. economic outlook or
monetary policy in her remarks at a conference on saving and
investing, sponsored by the Boston University School of
Management and the Boston Fed.  Duke said that little is known about how effectively
financial education can improve individuals’ economic well-
being.  “While much attention and many resources have been devoted
to financial education, we still have surprisingly little
information about the effectiveness of financial literacy
efforts,” she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
