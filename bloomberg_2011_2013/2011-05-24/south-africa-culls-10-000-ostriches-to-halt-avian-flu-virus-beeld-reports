South Africa  is culling as many as
10,000 ostriches after the bird flu virus spread to five farms
in the Western Cape province,  Beeld  reported, citing Anton
Kruger of the South African Ostrich Business Chamber.  This follows the killing of 5,700 birds in April after the
virus was detected at one farm in the province, the
Johannesburg-based newspaper said, citing Kruger. Three of the
farms where the new outbreaks occurred bordered the farm where
the virus was found in April, the newspaper cited Kruger as
saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
