Irakli Okruashvili, a former Georgian
defense minister living in asylum in  France , canceled a planned
visit to join anti-government protesters in Tbilisi because of a
disagreement among opposition groups, opposition leader Nino Burjanadze said.  Okruashvili, a former ally of President Mikheil Saakashvili, who is now an opponent, was due to arrive on May 25
to join the protests. France granted Okruashvili asylum in 2008
after a Georgian court convicted him of extortion and sentenced
him to 11 years in prison.  Georgia’s Deputy Prime Minister Giorgi Baramidze said in an
interview with Radio Tavisupleba that Burjanadze’s approval
rating was as low as 2 percent, according to recent polls,
the Georgian-language service of Radio Free  Europe  cited
Baramidze as saying.  Protests continued for a fourth day in Tbilisi today as
several dozen people gathered in the streets for a rally in the
capital, Shota Utiashvili, an Interior Ministry spokesman, said
in a phone interview from the capital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
