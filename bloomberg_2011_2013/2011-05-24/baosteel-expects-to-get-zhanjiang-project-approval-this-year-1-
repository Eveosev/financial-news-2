Baosteel Group Corp.,  China ’s second-
biggest steelmaker, said it expects to get approval for a 10
million metric ton mill this year, two years after a government
plan to curb overcapacity stalled the project.  Baosteel formed a unit this week for the mill, to be
located in Zhanjiang in the southern province of Guangdong,
Baosteel President He Wenbo told reporters today in Shanghai. A
raw-material dock is being built at the site, he said.  The National Development and Reform Commission delayed
approving projects planned by Baosteel and Wuhan Iron & Steel
Group in 2009 because of overcapacity. The planned mill will
help Baosteel to meet demand from the Chinese units of Japan’s
Honda Motor Co., Nissan Motor Co. and Toyota Motor Corp.  Guangzhou Iron & Steel Co., part of Baosteel, and the local
government will shut 15 million tons of obsolete capacity as
part of the plan to proceed with the Zhanjiang project,
Guangzhou Steel said in May last year.  Baosteel will seek to consolidate steelmakers in Guangdong,
He said today, without elaborating.  --Helen Yuan. Editors: Indranil Ghosh, Keith Gosman  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
