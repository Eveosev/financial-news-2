Frutarom Industries Ltd. (FRUT) , a maker of
flavors and fragrances, said first-quarter profit rose 18
percent as an improving global economy helped sales.  Net profit increased to $13.1 million from $11.1 million,
the Haifa, Israel-based company said in an e-mailed statement.
Revenue rose 6.7 percent to $121 million.  Frutarom, which bought two companies in the quarter, plans
additional acquisitions, President Ori Yehudai said in an e-
mailed statement. The company is also taking steps to offset
rising prices for raw materials by widening the number of
suppliers, Yehudai said.  Frutarom shares dropped 0.9 percent to 35.47 shekels at the
4:30 p.m. close in  Tel Aviv . The shares have increased 18
percent over the past 12 months compared with a 10 percent gain
for the TA-100 Index.  To contact the reporters on this story:
