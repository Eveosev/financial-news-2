Shares of the following companies had
unusual moves in  China  trading. Stock symbols are in parentheses
as of 3 p.m. close.  The Shanghai Composite Index, which tracks the bigger of
China’s stock exchanges, fell 25.32 points, or 0.9 percent, to
2,741.74. The  CSI 300 Index (SHSZ300)  declined 1.2 percent to 2,990.34.  Agricultural stocks: Heilongjiang Agriculture Co. (600598
CH) gained 0.7 percent to 13.67 yuan, its biggest advance in a
week. Yuan Longping High-tech Agriculture Co. (000998 CH), a
seed producer, added 1.3 percent to 26.82 yuan.  A worsening drought in south China may push up rice prices,
the National Business Daily reported, citing an unidentified
statistics official at Beijing Xinfadi Agricultural Product
Center. Rainfall was less than average in Hunan and Jiangxi
provinces, which produce half of the country’s early indica
rice, it said.  Guangzhou Iron and Steel Co. (600894 CH) jumped 2.4 percent
to 8.07 yuan, its biggest gain since May 18. Baosteel Group
Corp., which owns the steelmaker’s parent company, said it
expects to get approval for a 10-million-metric-ton mill this
year.  Xi’an Aircraft International Corp. (000768)  (000768 CH), a Chinese
supplier of parts to Boeing Co. and Airbus SAS, dropped 1.6
percent to 9.90 yuan. The reason one of the aircraft maker’s
MA60 passenger planes crashed in  Indonesia  is under
investigation, the company said in a statement on the Shenzhen
Stock Exchange. Other similar MA60s are operating normally and
no customers have cancelled or changed contracts so far, the
statement said.  ZTE Corp. (000063)  (000063 CH), China’s second-biggest phone-
equipment maker, slid 3 percent to 25.51 yuan, its lowest close
since Jan. 27. The company said today it expects sales this year
to expand at about the same pace as 2010. Sales rose 17 percent
last year and analysts’ consensus forecast is for 23 percent
growth in 2011.  --Zhang Shidong. Editor: Allen Wan  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
