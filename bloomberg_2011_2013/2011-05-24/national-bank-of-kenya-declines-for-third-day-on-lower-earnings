National Bank of Kenya Ltd. (NBKL) , a state-
owned lender, declined for a third day in Nairobi after it said
earnings in the first quarter fell 30 percent.  Shares of  NBK  retreated as much as 50 cents, or 1.4
percent, to 35 shillings and traded at 35.25 shillings, down 0.7
percent, at 10:24 a.m.  Net  income fell to 231.5 million shillings ($2.7 million)
from 330.6 million shillings. Net interest income, the money
banks make from issuing loans, climbed to 1.31 billion shillings
from 914.6 million shillings a year earlier, the company said in
a statement e-mailed yesterday by the  Nairobi Stock Exchange .  “Government securities held for trading by the bank
represent 18 percent of the asset base,” Nairobi-based Sterling
Investment Bank Ltd. said in an e-mailed note to clients today.
“Should the trend in  interest rates  persist it may attract
cautious trading on the stock in the near term.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
