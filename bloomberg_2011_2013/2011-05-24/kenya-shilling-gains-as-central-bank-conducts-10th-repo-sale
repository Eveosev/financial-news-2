Kenya ’s shilling rebounded from the
biggest drop in more than two months against the dollar after
the central bank sought to remove supply of the local currency
for a 10th trading session today.  The currency of East Africa’s biggest economy appreciated
as much as 0.4 percent to 86.40 per dollar and traded 0.1
percent stronger at 86.70 by 1:20 p.m. in the capital, Nairobi.
Yesterday, the currency slumped 1.1 percent to 86.78 per dollar,
the biggest decline since March 11.  The Central Bank of Kenya sold 4.91 billion shillings ($57
million) of  repurchase agreements  today, the biggest amount
since it started sales on May 11. In a repurchase agreement an
investor agrees to sell a security to another trader, while at
the same time arranging to buy it back at a future date and at a
pre-determined price.  “The mopping up by central bank has curbed supply,
providing relief to the local unit, a situation that is likely
to see the shilling trade within the 86 to 86.50 range in the
coming days,” Jeremiah Kendagor, head of trading at Nairobi-
based  Kenya Commercial Bank Ltd. (KNCB) , said in a phone interview
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
