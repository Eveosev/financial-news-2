Cox Communications Inc., the third-
largest U.S. cable operator, will stop building its 3G network
and offer wireless service exclusively using  Sprint Nextel
Corp. (S) ’s infrastructure.  “We believe this approach is good for our customers,
allowing us to take the necessary steps to fulfill our promise
to deliver a Cox experience that customers expect from us,”
Atlanta-based Cox said in an e-mailed statement.  Cox never began operating the 3G network it was building on
its own. The closely held company has introduced 3G wireless
voice and data service using Sprint’s network in areas of
California, Oklahoma, Virginia and Nebraska. Cox said in the
statement that it plans to offer wireless service to “more than
50 percent of our footprint this year.”  Cox is the first U.S. cable company to offer wireless phone
and mobile high-speed  Internet service , according to its
 website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
