Treasuries rose, pushing two-year
note yields toward the lowest level this year, after the U.S.
government’s $35 billion auction of the securities had the
highest level of demand since January.  Treasuries have gained on concern Europe’s debt crisis is
worsening and signs the  U.S. economy  is weakening. Two-year
notes drew a yield of 0.560 percent at today’s sale, compared
with an average forecast of 0.562 percent in a Bloomberg News
survey of nine of the  Federal Reserve ’s 20 primary dealers. The
bid-to-cover ratio, a gauge of demand that compares total bids
with amount of securities sold, was 3.46, the highest since it
measured 3.47 four months ago.  “The data’s been a little weak in the U.S., and the
uncertainty in Europe is leading to a flight-to-quality bid in
Treasuries,” said Jason Rogan, director of U.S. government
trading at Guggenheim Partners LLC, a New York-based brokerage
for institutional investors. “The fear in the world economy is
slowly but surely beginning to build up again.”  The yield on the current two-year note dropped two basis
points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 0.50 percent at 5:20 p.m.
in  New York , according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The
price of the 0.625 percent security maturing in April 2013
gained 1/32, or 31 cents per $1,000 face amount, to 100 7/32.  The two-year note yield touched 0.495 percent yesterday,
the lowest level since Dec. 7. The benchmark 10-year note yield
fell two basis points today to 3.11 percent after touching 3.09
percent on May 18, the lowest level since Dec. 7.  Bill Shortage  A shortage of Treasury bills and the low rate of those
still in the market have led some investors to move out the
yield curve into two-year notes, adding to the demand at today’s
auction, according to Dan Mulholland, a Treasury trader in New
York at RBC Capital Markets LLC, one of 20 primary dealers
required to bid at government debt auctions.  The Treasury sold $27 billion of three-month bills and $24
billion of six-month bills at almost record low rates yesterday.
The three-month securities sold at a rate of 0.055 percent,
compared with the record low 0.025 percent on May 9, while the
six-month bills were priced at 0.100 percent, compared with the
record 0.065 percent on May 9.  “Every basis point is a lot at this point,” Mulholland
said. “The lack of supply in the bill market is probably
forcing” some investors to buy two-year notes, he said.  Bill supply has slid since February after the Treasury
eliminated $195 billion in short-term debt it sold on behalf of
the Fed to help avoid exceeding the U.S. debt limit.  At today’s two-year note auction, indirect bidders, a class
including foreign central banks, purchased 31.3 percent of the
notes, compared with 37.9 percent at the April 26 offering and
an average of 33.1 percent for the past 10 sales.  Direct Bidders       Direct bidders, non-primary dealer investors that place
their bids directly with the Treasury, purchased 19.1 percent of
the notes, compared with 13.4 percent last month and an average
of 13.5 percent at the last 10 auctions.  The offering is the first of three note sales this week
totaling $99 billion. The Treasury is scheduled to sell $35
billion in five-year debt tomorrow and $29 billion of seven-year
notes on May 26.  Portuguese 10-year yields surged to a record high of 9.85
percent on concern  Europe ’s debt crisis is worsening. Greek
yields fluctuated between gains and losses after the government
endorsed yesterday plans to sell stakes in state-owned companies
and cut more than 6 billion euros ($8.5 billion) in spending.  “Treasuries aren’t going to lose a lot of their premium
because I don’t think any of these issues have been solved,”
said  John Briggs , a U.S. government bond strategist in  Stamford ,
 Connecticut , at Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc’s RBS
Securities unit, a primary dealer.  Manufacturing Gauge  Two-year note yields slid earlier as a Richmond Fed gauge
of manufacturing in the Carolinas, the  District of Columbia ,
 Maryland ,  Virginia  and  West Virginia  dropped this month more
than economists forecast to negative 6.  Sales of U.S. new homes unexpectedly increased 7.3 percent
in April to a 323,000 annual pace, a four-month high, the
Commerce Department reported. The median forecast of 75
economists in a Bloomberg News survey was for no change.  The yield on 10-year Treasuries has fallen below the annual
inflation rate this month for the first time since 2008, making
the securities less attractive. The spread, known as the real
yield, was negative six basis points today.  Consumer Prices  The  consumer price index  increased 3.2 percent in the 12
months ended in April, the biggest gain since October 2008,
figures from the Labor Department showed this month. The so-
called core measure excluding food and energy rose 1.3 percent
from April 2010.  The central bank purchased $6.4 billion of bonds due from
November 2013 to May 2015 today to support the economy under the
$600 billion program of debt purchases ending next month  Fed funds futures indicated a 15 percent chance the central
bank will raise its target lending rate by December, down from a
24 percent probability a month ago. The benchmark has held at
zero to 0.25 percent since December 2008.  To contact the reporters on this story:
