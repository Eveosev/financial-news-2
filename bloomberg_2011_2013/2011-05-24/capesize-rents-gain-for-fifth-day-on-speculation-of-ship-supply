Rents for capesize ships that haul
 iron ore  climbed for a fifth day on speculation owners had taken
vessels off the market because of low hire rates.  Daily hire rates gained 7.2 percent to $8,642, data from
the  Baltic Exchange  in London show, bringing the gain to 53
percent in five days. Rents fell to a 2011-low of $4,567 a day
in March. Operating costs for the vessels are between $7,500 and
$8,000 a day, according to estimates from London-based Simpson
Spence & Young, the world’s second-biggest shipbroker. Capesizes
were below that level from April 11 to May 19.  “No owner’s going to continue doing business at $4,000 a
day or $6,000, below operating costs,” said Hendrik Leusink,
division executive for capesize and panama vessels at Island
View Shipping SA,  South Africa ’s biggest commodities shipping
line. “People will put ships into temporary lay-up or idle
ships.”  The capesize fleet outgrew demand after rates more than
doubled in 2006 and 2007. Carrying capacity of the capesize
fleet will increase 16 percent this year, faster than a 7
percent rise in demand for iron ore, according to forecasts from
Clarkson Plc, the biggest shipbroker.  Daily rents for panamaxes that compete with capesizes for
cargoes and also transport grains gained 2.6 percent to $14,079
a day. Supramaxes rose 0.9 percent to $14,937 and handysizes
fell 0.1 percent to $11,637.  -- Editors: Claudia Carpenter, Sharon Lindores  To contact the reporter on this story:
