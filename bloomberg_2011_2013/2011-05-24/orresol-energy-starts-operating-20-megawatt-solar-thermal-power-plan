Torresol Energy SA began operating
the world’s first solar-thermal tower with heat storage,
allowing it to sustain generating power through the night near
Seville in southern  Spain .  The 19.9-megawatt Gemasolar plant will produce power 24
hours a day during the sunnier parts of the year by stockpiling
heat in molten salt to power turbines after sundown, the company
said today in an e-mailed statement. Its 2,650 mirrors arrayed
over 185 hectares (457 acres) can generate temperatures of up to
900 degrees centigrade (1,652 degrees Fahrenheit) in the
receptor mounted on a central tower while its salt-based storage
system will exceed 500 degrees, it added.  Torresol is a joint venture backed 60 percent by Las
Arenas, Spain-based SENER Ingeneria y Sistemas SA and 40 percent
by Masdar, the Abu Dhabi government’s clean energy company. The
project was financed by a 171 million-euro ($241 million) loan
from  Banco Popular SA (POPULA) , the  European Investment Bank  and Spain’s
Official Credit Institute.  The Gemasolar plant, which will produce enough power for
25,000 homes, produces hotter steam than rival installations,
making it more efficient, the company said.  Torresol plans to commission two more plants with 50
megawatts of capacity each in the southern region of Andalucia
later this year. Those plants will use rows of parabolic mirrors
to focus the sun’s energy on pipes of oil rather than a central
tower.  To contact the reporter on this story:
