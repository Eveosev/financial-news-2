The U.K.’s spell of dry weather isn’t
likely to cause restrictions in water use, according to  Pennon
Group Plc (PNN) , which provides water in the country’s southwest.  Additional reservoirs, reductions in leakage and increased
use of water meters mean hose pipe bans and other forced
conservation measures aren’t likely for the company’s customers,
Chris Loughlin, chief executive officer of Pennnon’s South West
Water unit, said in an interview.  The U.K. has had about 61 percent of its normal rainfall in
the last three months, the Department for Environment, Food and
Rural Affairs said on May 17.  To contact the reporter on this story:
