business in  India , two people with knowledge of the matter said.  Krishna, who was an executive director in charge of equity
capital markets at Morgan Stanley, will join Goldman Sachs in
August as a managing director after completing three months of
so-called gardening leave, the people said, declining to be

billion) in domestic share sales in 2011, about half of the
total for the same period last year, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. Morgan Stanley was ranked seventh in arranging
such offerings in the past 12 months, while Goldman Sachs was
11th, the data show.  Noel Cheung, a spokeswoman for Morgan Stanley in  Hong Kong ,
confirmed that Krishna is leaving the firm. Connie Ling, a
