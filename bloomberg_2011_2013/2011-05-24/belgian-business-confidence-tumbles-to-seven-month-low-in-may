Belgian business confidence dropped
more than economists forecast in May and reached a seven-month
low, led by a deterioration of demand expectations and a build-
up of inventories in the manufacturing industry.  The confidence index for  Belgium  fell to minus 0.5 from 2.8
in April, the  National Bank of Belgium  in Brussels said today in
an e-mailed statement. That’s a second consecutive decline and
the lowest reading since October 2010. Economists expected a
drop to 2.5, according to the median of 16 forecasts compiled by
Bloomberg.  The decline marks a deviation from German business
confidence, which unexpectedly held at 114.2 in May, even as a
sub-indicator of expectations slipped to 107.4 from 107.7 in the
previous month. A gauge of demand expectations among Belgian
executives in the manufacturing industry fell to minus 6.6, the
lowest value since August, and their assessment of stock levels
was the worst in two years.  “Confidence among business leaders weakened in all four of
the branches of activity surveyed,” the central bank said in
the statement. “With the exception of the building industry,
prospects on the demand side are still clearly weak in all the
various sectors.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
