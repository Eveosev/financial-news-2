Asian stocks will return just 2
percent to investors over the next three months amid “duller”
economic and earnings prospects and higher energy prices,
according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc.  The brokerage, which didn’t specify a target for the MSCI
 Asia  Pacific excluding Japan Index over the next three months,
expects the gauge to climb to 575 by mid-2012, according to a
report today. It had previously predicted the measure will reach
that level at the end of this year. The index was little changed
at 475.62 as of 11:35 a.m. in Singapore, following a 2.7 percent
slump yesterday. The gauge has lost 0.7 percent this year and is
valued at 12.4 times estimated profits.  “We continue to hold a strategically positive equity
stance, but believe that returns will not be as strong as we
earlier expected given shifts in the macro environment,”
Goldman Sachs analysts led by Timothy Moe wrote in the report.  China ’s preliminary purchasing managers’ index compiled by
HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics fell to its lowest level
in 10 months, a report yesterday showed, adding to signs that
economic growth is cooling and government measures to tame
inflation may damp corporate earnings.  The Goldman Sachs analysts said Asia excluding Japan
economies will expand 7.8 percent between 2011 and 2012,
compared with an earlier forecast of 8.2 percent. They cut their
2012 per-share earnings growth forecasts to 12 percent from 14
percent, while maintaining a 15 percent estimate for this year.  Oil Outlook  The forecast for earnings compare with those of Citigroup
Inc., which said last week global per-share earnings will rise
18 percent this year, faster than an earlier forecast, amid
stronger revenue growth and sustained margins.  Goldman Sachs, which last month suggested selling copper
and oil, said in a separate report investors should return to
raw materials in anticipation of tighter supplies. The brokerage
raised its three-month outlook for  Brent crude  oil to $115 a
barrel and lifted the six- and 12-month forecasts to $120 and
$130, respectively.  “We believe that the risk/reward once again favors being
long commodities,” analysts led by London-based  Jeffrey Currie 
said. “Economic growth will likely be sufficient to tighten key
supply-constrained markets in the second half of 2011, leading
to higher prices from current levels.”  The Standard & Poor’s GSCI spot index of 24 commodities has
lost 9.3 percent after New York-based Goldman Sachs first told
investors April 11 to sell a basket of commodities including
oil, copper and cotton, and in the same week to stay
“underweight” in raw materials. The index gained 0.5 percent
today, while Brent crude rose 0.6 percent to $110.71 a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
