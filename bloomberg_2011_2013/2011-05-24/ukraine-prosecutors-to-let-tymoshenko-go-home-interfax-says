Ukraine’s prosecutor-general’s office
will let former Prime Minister  Yulia Tymoshenko  go home after
questioning today, the Interfax-Ukraine news agency reported,
citing First Deputy Prosecutor-General Renat Kuzmin.  Ukraine prosecutors opened a criminal case in April against
Tymoshenko, accusing her of abuse of power related to natural-
gas contracts her government signed with Russia in 2009.  To contact the reporters on this story:
