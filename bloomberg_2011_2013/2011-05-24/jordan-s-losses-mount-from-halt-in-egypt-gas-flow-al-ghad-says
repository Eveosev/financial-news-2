Jordan  is losing about 3.5 million
dinars ($4.9 million) a day because of the halt in supply of
natural gas from  Egypt ,  Al Ghad  reported, citing Minister of
Industry and Trade Hani Mulki.  Power stations in Jordan, which imports almost all of its
energy needs, are using more expensive fuels such as diesel
instead of Egyptian gas, according to the newspaper. The plants
were forced to switch fuels after saboteurs attacked Egypt’s
gas-pipeline network in Sinai in February and again on April 27,
causing a suspension in exports.  To contact the reporter on this story:
