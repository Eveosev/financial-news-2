The  California Public Employees’
Retirement System , the largest U.S. pension, said it’s
cooperating with a state investigation into whether its top
staff and board members failed to properly disclose gifts.  The California Fair Political Practices Commission is
investigating 49 current and former Calpers employees and board
members, including  Joe Dear , the fund’s chief investment
officer, and Rob Feckner, the $235 billion fund’s board
president, for either failing to report gifts or valuing them
properly, according to a list provided by the commission’s
executive director, Roman Porter.  “Calpers has been fully cooperating with the FPPC on this
investigation over the last several months,” Anne Stausboll,
the fund’s chief executive officer, said in a statement
yesterday. “These matters are still pending and our staff
involved have due-process rights.” Stausboll’s name is not on
the list of those included in the inquiry.  Calpers was roiled by a pay-to-play scandal last year
involving middlemen hired by firms seeking to win the fund’s
business. California law requires anyone involved in investing
taxpayer money to file a statement of economic interest each
year describing their income and listing any gifts they were
given. The value limit on gifts is $420.  The commission can fine violators as much as $5,000 for
each offense, Porter said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
