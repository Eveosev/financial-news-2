Guinea ’s president,  Alpha Conde , must
investigate crimes committed by security forces in 2007 and 2009
and strengthen the country’s judicial system, according to New
York-based Human Rights Watch.  The West African nation should have “zero tolerance” toward
crimes perpetrated by the army, the group said in a report
released in Conakry, the capital, today. The military ruled for
two years before Conde’s election in November that marked a
return to civilian leadership in the world’s top bauxite
exporter.  In 2007, 137 people were killed and 1,700 wounded when
security forces opened fire on protesters demonstrating against
deteriorating economic conditions and bad governance in the
country then ruled by Lansana Conte, who seized power in 1984,
according to the HRW report.  In September 2009, 150 opposition supporters were killed
and scores of women raped during a protest calling for an end to
the rule of Moussa Dadis Camara, the army captain that seized
power following the death of Conte in 2008.  Guinea should form a Truth and Reconciliation Commission to
investigate the abuses, said  Corinne Dufka , a senior West
African researcher with  Human Rights Watch .  “Guinea’s future is at stake,” she told reporters today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
