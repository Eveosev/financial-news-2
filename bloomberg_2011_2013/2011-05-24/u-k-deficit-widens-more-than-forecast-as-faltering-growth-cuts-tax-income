Britain posted its largest budget
shortfall for any April since monthly records began in 1993 as
 tax revenue  fell and spending climbed, casting doubt on whether
the government can meet its deficit-reduction target this year.  Net borrowing was 10 billion pounds ($16.2 billion),
compared with 7.2 billion pounds a year earlier, the  Office for
National Statistics  said in London today. The median of 12
forecasts in a Bloomberg News survey was for a shortfall of 6.5
billion pounds. Revenue fell 0.8 percent, partly reflecting a
one-time boost from a bank bonus tax a year ago, and spending
rose 5 percent.  Chancellor of the Exchequer  George Osborne  may find it hard
to meet his deficit-cutting goals as the economy struggles to
gain momentum, the opposition  Labour Party  and some economists
say. Growth stagnated in the six months through March and the
government will step up its program of cuts this year.  “This is a disappointing start to the new fiscal year,”
said Nida Ali, economic adviser to the Ernst & Young ITEM Club.
“Given that the worst of the pain is yet to come, the
chancellor’s target of reducing borrowing by 30 billion pounds
in 2011/12 looks more stretching than ever, especially with
economic growth looking likely to disappoint.”  The pound depreciated as much as 0.3 percent to 87.43 pence
per euro, before trading 0.2 percent weaker at 87.27 pence as of
11:47 a.m. in  London . Sterling climbed 0.2 percent to $1.6157,
after depreciating as much as 0.4 percent to $1.6058.  Bonus Tax  The fall in tax receipts partly reflected a year-earlier
gain from the bank payroll tax that brought in 3.5 billion
pounds. Revenue in April 2010 was also boosted by “relatively
high bonuses being paid and share options being exercised,” the
statistics office said.  Osborne has vowed to stick to his plans to eliminate the
bulk of the deficit by April 2015. Labour says the cuts, the
deepest since World War II, risk derailing the recovery.  The budget shortfall, which reached a record 156.5 billion
pounds -- 11.1 percent of gross domestic product -- in the
aftermath of the recession, is forecast to narrow to 122 billion
pounds in the current fiscal year, or 7.9 percent of GDP,
according to the Treasury’s fiscal watchdog.  In the year through March, the deficit was 139.4 billion
pounds, 1.7 billion pounds lower than estimated last month. The
Treasury had predicted a gap of 145.9 billion pounds.  ‘Making Headway’  “One-off factors affected borrowing this month, but it is
clear from the downward revision to last year’s borrowing
figures that the government’s deficit-reduction strategy is
making headway in dealing with our unsustainable deficit,” the
Treasury said in a statement.  The cash measure of the deficit was 3.3 billion pounds last
month, compared with a median forecast of 2.5 billion pounds.
The shortfall including government support for banks was 7.7
billion pounds.  Labour says the pace of spending cuts is sapping  consumer
confidence  and economic growth, making the task of cutting the
deficit harder. More than 300,000 public-sector jobs will be
axed in the coming years as  government spending  falls to 40
percent of GDP by 47 percent last year.  The average of independent forecasts compiled by the
Treasury this month is for growth of 1.6 percent in 2011, down
from 1.7 percent in April. In March, the Treasury predicted 1.7
percent growth.  To contact the reporters on this story:
