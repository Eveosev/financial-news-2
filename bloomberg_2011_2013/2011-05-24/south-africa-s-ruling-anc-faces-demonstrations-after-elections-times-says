Supporters of  South Africa ’s ruling
African National Congress party demonstrated yesterday in the
Eastern Cape and KwaZulu-Natal provinces to demand that
councilors elected in last week’s municipal elections be
removed, Johannesburg’s Times newspaper reported, citing
demonstrators.  The demonstrators want President  Jacob Zuma  to keep a
promise made before the elections to remove councillors who were
improperly nominated within the party, the newspaper said. The
demonstrations were at Bizana and Mthatha in the Eastern Cape
and Waterloo in KwaZulu-Natal, the newspaper said.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
