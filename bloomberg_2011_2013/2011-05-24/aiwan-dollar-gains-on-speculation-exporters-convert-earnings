Taiwan ’s dollar strengthened on
speculation exporters took advantage of yesterday’s decline to
repatriate overseas income at a more-favorable  exchange rate .  The currency fell to the weakest level in a month yesterday
as overseas investors sold $432 million more local shares than
they bought, exchange data showed.  “From time to time these companies have to sell the dollar
to pay suppliers and workers,” said Suan Teck Kin, an economist
at United Overseas Bank Ltd. in  Singapore . “Yesterday’s closing
price was a pretty good level.”  The  Taiwan dollar  gained 0.2 percent to NT$28.961 against
its U.S. counterpart as of 9:27 a.m. local time, according to
Taipei Forex Inc. It closed at NT$29.009 yesterday, the weakest
level since April 21.  The currency was trading 0.5 percent weaker at NT$28.938
four minutes before the end of trading yesterday and extended
losses on suspected intervention by the central bank, according
to two traders who declined to be identified as the monetary
authority doesn’t disclose such details.  The island’s industrial output rose 6.85 percent in April
from a year earlier, the least since September 2009, the
government reported toward the end of trading yesterday.  Government bonds  were little changed. The yield on the
1.375 percent security due March 2021, the most-traded
government debt, was 1.420 percent, from 1.424 percent
yesterday, according to Gretai Securities Market. That was the
lowest level for benchmark 10-year debt in a week.  To contact the reporters on this story:
