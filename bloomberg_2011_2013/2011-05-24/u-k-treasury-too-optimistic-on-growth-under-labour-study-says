The U.K. Treasury was too optimistic
about economic growth under the previous Labour government and
forecasting errors were magnified during the financial crisis, a
research group said.  In the first six years of the decade, the average forecast
of growth one year ahead was 0.3 percentage point higher than
the eventual outturn, the London-based Centre for Policy Studies
said in an analysis published today. Between 2007 and 2010, the
Treasury was too optimistic by 1.6 points. The average error
over the whole period was 0.75 point.  Chancellor of the Exchequer  George Osborne  created the
 Office for Budget Responsibility  after the Conservative-led
government took office a year ago, saying he wanted to rid
forecasting of political interference. The watchdog, which
produces forecasts for the Treasury and monitors fiscal policy,
expects the economy to expand 1.7 percent this year, below a 2.6
percent prediction made in June.  “At best, this evidence shows the difficulty of accurate
macroeconomic growth forecasting,” Ryan Bourne, who compiled
the figures, said in the report. “At worst, it provides strong
justification for setting up the independent Office for Budget
Responsibility.”  Between 2000 and 2006, the average error of forecasts made
two years ahead was 0.5 point and it was 2.8 points during the
crisis, according to his calculations. The average error was 1.3
points over the decade.  To contact the reporter on this story:
