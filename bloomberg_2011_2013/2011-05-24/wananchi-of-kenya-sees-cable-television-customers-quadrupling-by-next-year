Wananchi Group Holdings , a Kenyan
provider of media and telecommunications services, expects to
quadruple its number of cable-television subscribers by next
year after raising $57.5 million from international investors.  The company, which currently has 50,000 customers, expects
to increase that number to 200,000 by the end of 2012, Chief
Executive Officer Richard Bell told reporters today in Nairobi,
the capital. Wananchi also plans to start satellite-television
services in  Tanzania  and Ethiopia within six to 18 months, Bell
said. The service is currently available in Kenya and Uganda.  “Our goal is to become the leading telecommunications and
home entertainment company in the region,” Bell said. “Through
our various platforms, we can offer customers Internet, voice
and pay TV.”  Wananchi, which means common man in the Swahili language,
said last week it raised funds for its expansion from companies
including  Liberty Global Inc. (LBTYA) , the cable operator controlled by
U.S. billionaire  John Malone ; New York-based OppenheimerFunds
Inc.; and Sarona Asset Management, a Canadian-based emerging-
markets fund manager.  The company plans to roll out its satellite-TV service to
10 African countries including Kenya,  Uganda , Tanzania,
Ethiopia, Eritrea, Southern Sudan, Rwanda, Burundi, Malawi and
Somalia, Emerging Capital Partners, a shareholder in Wananchi,
said last week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
