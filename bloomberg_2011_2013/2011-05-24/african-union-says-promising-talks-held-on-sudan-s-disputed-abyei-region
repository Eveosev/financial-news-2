The  African Union  said Sudanese
President Umar al-Bashir and his Southern Sudanese counterpart
Salva Kiir agreed to work toward withdrawing unauthorized forces
from the disputed Abyei region.  Thabo Mbeki, head of the African Union High-Level
Implementation Panel, traveled to both countries over the past
two days and held “promising discussions” with the two
leaders, the continental body said in an e-mailed statement
today from  Addis Ababa , the Ethiopian capital where it is based.  Bashir and Kiir “reaffirmed their willingness to work out
modalities for the withdrawal of all unauthorized forces from
the Abyei area,” it said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
