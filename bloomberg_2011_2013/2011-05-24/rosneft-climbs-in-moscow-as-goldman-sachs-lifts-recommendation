OAO Rosneft gained the most in more
two weeks after Goldman Sachs Group Inc. increased its
recommendation on the Russian oil producer’s shares to “buy”
from “neutral,” citing potential tax relief.  The shares rallied 2.8 percent to 228.06 rubles by the 6:45
p.m. close in Moscow, the largest increase since May 6.  “Rosneft is well-positioned to benefit from potential tax
relief in upstream production,” Goldman Sachs analysts said in
an e-mailed report.  Goldman raised Rosneft’s price estimate to $11.80 a share
from $8.80.  To contact the reporter on this story:
