Cameroon plans to boost gold output
by 70 percent in an effort to increase the reserves it holds at
the Bank of Central African States, the  Cameroon Tribune  said,
citing Lele L’afrique Tchoffo, governor of the East Region.  Increased production of the precious metal will also
improve Cameroon’s special drawing rights at the  International
Monetary Fund , the Yaounde-based newspaper said.  Cameroon produces about 1,800 kilograms (57,870 troy
ounces) of gold a year, according to the  U.S. Geological Survey .  To contact the reporter on this story:
