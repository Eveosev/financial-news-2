Bawag PSK’s former Chief Executive
Officer Helmut Elsner’s imprisonment while awaiting trial on 1.7
billion euros ($2.4 billion) in losses at the Austrian bank
didn’t violate human rights laws.  Elsner’s detention throughout the criminal proceedings
because he was deemed a flight risk, even while having heart
surgery, was “reasonable,” the  European Court of Human Rights 
ruled today.  “Without a doubt there had been a reasonable suspicion
that Mr. Elsner had committed criminal offenses,” the
Strasbourg, France-based court said in an e-mailed statement.
“The mere fact that following his operation Mr. Elsner had been
in intense medical care had not as such eliminated all risk of
him absconding.”  The 76-year-old former banker was sentenced to 7 1/2 years
in jail in December for his role in the losses in the late
1990s, according to the court ruling. The losses, mostly run up
with wrong-way bets on the Japanese yen, weren’t uncovered until
U.S. futures broker Refco Inc., a Bawag affiliate, collapsed in
2005. The discovery eventually forced Bawag’s sale to private
equity firm Cerberus Capital Management LP in 2007.  While Karl Bernhauser, one of Elsner’s lawyers in Vienna,
said there wouldn’t be an appeal, Juergen Stephan Mertens, his
lawyer dealing with the human rights case, said he was
considering an appeal and a new case, which may focus on other
aspects of the trial.  Elsner was arrested in  France  after charges of breach of
trust and fraud were filed in 2006 in  Austria  related to the
Bawag losses. He was brought to Austria the following February
and held until his conviction 15 months later. The sentence was
upheld by the  Supreme Court  in 2010.  The  European Court  of Human Rights cases are: Elsner v.
Austria, nos. 15710/07, 31805/07, 36230/07, 40937/07 17239/08
and 41402/08.  To contact the reporter on this story:
