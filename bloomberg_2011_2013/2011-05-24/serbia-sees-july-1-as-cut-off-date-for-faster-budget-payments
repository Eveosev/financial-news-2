The Serbian government may eliminate
delays as of July 1 in paying state contractors and other
businesses from the budget while rescheduling its previous
obligations.  Long accused of being the biggest debtor in the country and
source of a chronic lack of liquidity in the public and the
private sectors, the state aims to “discipline itself” by
reducing the payment deadlines to 60 days as of July 1, Economy
Minister Nebojsa Ciric said at a business forum in Belgrade
today.  For overdue payments accumulated until that date “we will
come up with a form of reprogramming,” Ciric said without
elaborating or assessing the impact of the new measures on the
budget. The payments currently take an average of 130 days, the
head of  Serbia ’s Chamber of Commerce, Milos Bugarin, said last
week.  Serbia has to keep its 2011 fiscal gap below 4.1 percent of
gross domestic product and trim it to 3.2 percent next year, as
agreed with the  International Monetary Fund , whose delegation is
currently in Belgrade discussing a new precautionary arrangement
with the country.  The Balkan nation needs to raise economic growth to at
least 4 percent annually in order to plan balanced budgets,
Ciric said. The economy expanded 2.4 percent in the first
quarter after output rose 1.7 percent in the previous three-
month period, according to Serbia’s central bank, which expects
2011 growth at 3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
