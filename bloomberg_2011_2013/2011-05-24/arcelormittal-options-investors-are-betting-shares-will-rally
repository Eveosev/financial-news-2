Options investors placed bets today
that shares of  ArcelorMittal (MT) , the world’s largest steelmaker,
will rise more than 4 percent by next month.  More than 19,000 calls to buy the stock changed hands as of
4 p.m. in New York, seven times the four-week full-day average
and 17 times the number of puts to sell. The June $33 calls were
the most active after a block of more than 6,100 traded at 9:50
a.m. Shares of Luxembourg-based  ArcelorMittal (MT)  rose 0.7 percent
to $32.34.  “These new option positions will need ArcelorMittal to
rise more than 4.1 percent over the next four weeks before any
profits will be seen,”  Patrick Mortimer , director of options
trading at Pipeline Trading Systems LLC in  New Hope ,
Pennsylvania, said in a report this morning.  ArcelorMittal is planning to hold an individual-investor
event on June 15, the week the June options expire, and will
present at a Deutsche Bank AG conference in Chicago that same
day. The shares have fallen 12 percent since May 10, the day the
company held its annual meeting and the day before the
steelmaker said in its first-quarter profit report that it
expects a drop in demand during the second half of 2011.  The June $33 calls had an open interest of 1,879 before
today and 83 percent traded on the ask price, a sign that buyers
of new bullish positions initiated most of today’s transactions.
They rose 21 percent to 82 cents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
