Manchester United  is close to signing
David De Gea from  Atletico Madrid  as a successor for record-
breaking Dutch goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar, who will retire
after the May 28 Champions League final against Barcelona.  “We’ve been working on it for quite a while,” United
manager  Alex Ferguson  told the English Premier League soccer
champion’s website late yesterday. “We identified him quite a
while back as one we should go for.”  De Gea, 20, made 45 appearances for Atletico Madrid this
season, shutting out the opposition on 24 occasions. He helped
the club win  Europe ’s second-tier Europa League last year,
though is yet to play for Spain’s senior team.  United had also been linked with Schalke keeper  Manuel
Neuer , though the German international has said he wants to stay
in his homeland.  De Gea’s speed, composure and presence make him an
“outstanding replacement” for Van der Sar, Ferguson said.  The 40-year-old Dutchman, who played a record 130 games for
the Netherlands, has helped United win four English league
championships, one Champions League title and the FIFA Club
World Cup since joining from Fulham in June 2005.  He didn’t allow a goal for 1,311 minutes during the 2008-09
Premier League season, a European record in a domestic league.  “We were looking for the same type of qualities as Edwin,
because the one great quality Edwin always had was his composure
and organizational ability,” Ferguson said. “With David De Gea,
he is very similar that way.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
