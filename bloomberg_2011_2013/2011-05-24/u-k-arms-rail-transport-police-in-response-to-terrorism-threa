Transport Secretary Philip Hammond
said the U.K. will arm British Transport Police officers
patrolling railways and  London ’s underground network as part of
counter-terrorism measures.  “The timing is not the result of any specific threat,”
Hammond said in a written statement to Parliament in London
today. By doing so “we will reduce the burden on other police
forces which currently provide armed support to the British
Transport Police.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
