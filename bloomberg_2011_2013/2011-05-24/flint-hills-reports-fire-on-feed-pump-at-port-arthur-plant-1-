Flint Hills Resources LLC reported a
fire on the C3 hydrogenation feed pump, according to a filing
with the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality.  Workers noticed the fire at 10:45 p.m. local time
yesterday, the filing showed. The plant’s emergency operations
center was activated and the in-house fire brigade reported. The
light olefins unit was shut down and process gases were routed
to that unit’s flare.  The fire’s cause is unknown and under investigation, the
company said in the filing. The resulting emissions haven’t
stopped, the filing showed.  Katie Stavinoha, a Flint Hills spokeswoman based in
Houston, declined to comment on plant operations.  To contact the reporter this story:
