Portugal ’s port of Sines is scheduled
to receive a shipment of liquefied natural gas from  Nigeria  on
May 28.  The LNG Rivers is sailing from Bonny in Nigeria, according
to the website of  Administracao do Porto de Sines SA , the port’s
management company.  The Sines LNG terminal, with a capacity of 5.26 billion
cubic meters of natural gas a year, is managed by REN-Redes
Energeticas Nacionais SA, the nation’s power and gas grid
operator. LNG is gas cooled to a liquid for shipment by tanker
and then converted back at terminals for distribution to users.  Galp Energia SGPS SA (GALP) , Portugal’s biggest oil and gas
company, receives LNG at Sines as well as gas from  Algeria 
through a pipeline crossing Morocco and Spain. Galp also
operates Portugal’s largest refinery at Sines. EDP-Energias de
Portugal SA, the country’s biggest power utility, runs a coal-
fired electricity plant at the site.  Other ships expected at Sines include Lia, a tanker
carrying crude that’s sailing from Malabo in Equatorial Guinea
and is scheduled to arrive on May 26. Cap Theodora, a ship
carrying crude from Luanda in Angola, is due to arrive in Sines
on May 30.  Sines is one of the European Union’s biggest deepwater
harbors, according to the port’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
