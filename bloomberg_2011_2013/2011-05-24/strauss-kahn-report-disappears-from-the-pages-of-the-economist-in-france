The Economist  magazine’s “Briefing”
section on “The Downfall of  Dominique Strauss-Kahn ”
disappeared from the May 21st edition distributed in France, as
the publication skips from page 24 to page 37.  The omission is a printing error confined to France,
according to Kate Cooke, marketing director for The Economist in
Geneva. It has affected “no more than several hundred copies,”
she said in an e-mail today, adding that the magazine has 51,500
subscribers in France.  The London-based magazine isn’t free of news on the New
York arrest of the head of the  International Monetary Fund  on
charges he sexually assaulted and attempted to rape a hotel maid
in  Manhattan . Strauss-Kahn, who has since resigned from his post
at the IMF, is the subject of a front-of-the-magazine piece
titled “Damned” that says: “Whatever the man did, do not
forsake his ideas.”  Strauss-Kahn’s lawyers, who warned French media last week
to be wary of broadcasting images that might undermine the
presumption of innocence after footage appeared of him
handcuffed and unshaven en route to his May 16 arraignment,
weren’t behind The Economist’s omission, Dominique de Leusse de
Syon, one of his lawyers in  France , said by telephone today.  Strauss-Kahn, now free on bail, has denied the charges and
pledged to defend himself.  The Economist has received “very few” complaints from
subscribers about the missing pages and will send new copies to
those it knows didn’t get the full issue, Cooke said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
