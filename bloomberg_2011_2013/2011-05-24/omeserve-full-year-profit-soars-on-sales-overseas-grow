HomeServe Plc (HSV) , a U.K.-based emergency
service provider with more than 10 million policies worldwide,
said full-year profit more than doubled as its overseas
operations expanded.  Net income rose to 76.9 million pounds ($124 million) in
the 12 months to March 31, from 30.7 million pounds a year
earlier, the Walsall, England-based company said today in a
Regulatory News Service statement. So-called underlying revenue
increased 15 percent to 425.4 million pounds.  “The biggest growth in profits was in the international
business,” Chief Executive Officer Richard Harpin said in a
telephone interview today. “It’s also a combination of
continued growth in the U.K. This year has got off to a good
start, we are confident we will get good momentum out of the
international business.”  HomeServe won six service contracts in the period and
revenue in  France  and  Spain  also increased. In the U.K., which
accounts for 85 percent of the company’s profits, the number of
customers rose 4 percent to 3 million.  The company said it wants to expand its overseas
activitiess by acquiring utility policies. “Our principal focus
is in the U.S.,” Harpin said. “We would like to go and buy any
utility that is running its own services. There are 35 targets.
We are talking to a significant number of those. The pipeline of
new potential deals is looking strong.”  Adjusted operating profit in the U.S. grew to 6.1 million
pounds in the period, from 1.5 million pounds a year earlier,
the company said in today’s statement.  HomeServe fell as much as 6.5 pence, or 1.27 percent, to
505 pence in London trading, before recovering. It was trading
at 512.5 pence at 8:50 a.m. The stock has gained 15.6 percent
this year, giving the company a market value of 1.69 billion
pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
