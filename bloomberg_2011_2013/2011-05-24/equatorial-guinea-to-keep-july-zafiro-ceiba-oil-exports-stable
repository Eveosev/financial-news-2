Equatorial Guinea will keep exports
of its Zafiro and Ceiba crude unchanged in July, according to
loading programs obtained by Bloomberg News.  The country will ship four cargoes of Zafiro crude and
three lots of Ceiba in July, unchanged from June, the programs
showed. All cargoes are 1 million barrels each.  Chad will export three 950,000-barrel shipments of Doba
crude in July, one less than June, according to the plans.  All three grades are low-sulfur, or sweet.  Exxon Mobil
Corp. (XOM)  operates the Zafiro and Doba fields and  Hess Corp. (HES)  runs
the Ceiba field.  To contact the reporter on this story:
