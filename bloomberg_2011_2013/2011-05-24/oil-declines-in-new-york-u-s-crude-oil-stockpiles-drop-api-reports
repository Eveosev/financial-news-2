Oil dropped from the highest in
almost a week in  New York  after an industry-funded report showed
gasoline inventories surged in the U.S., the world’s largest
crude user, signaling demand may falter.  Futures slipped as much as 1.1 percent today, switching
direction for a sixth straight session. Stockpiles of motor fuel
climbed 2.44 million barrels in the week ended May 20, the most
since Feb. 4, the  American Petroleum Institute  said. Demand slid
1.5 percent. An Energy Department report today may show supplies
increased 450,000 barrels, according to a Bloomberg News survey.  “Gasoline stockpiles rose significantly at a time when the
market is expecting a decline ahead of the peak demand season,”
said Serene Lim, a commodity and energy strategist at Australia
& New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. in  Singapore , who predicts oil
will average $105 a barrel this year. “The market is looking
for the Energy Department data to confirm these API numbers.”  Crude for July delivery fell as much as $1.09 to $98.50 a
barrel in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . It was at $98.57 at 1:20 p.m. Singapore time.
Yesterday, the contract rose $1.89, or 1.9 percent, to $99.59,
the highest since May 18. Prices have gained 43 percent in the
past year.  Brent crude  for July settlement on the London-based ICE
Futures Europe exchange dropped as much as $1.03, or 0.9
percent, to $111.50 a barrel. The contract yesterday gained
$2.43, or 2.2 percent, to $112.53, the highest settlement since
May 16.  Gasoline Prices  U.S. gasoline stockpiles rose to 211.2 million barrels last
week, according to the API report. Pump prices of almost $4 a
gallon, the highest since 2008, are deterring motorists just as
the country’s vacation season starts. Retail demand for the fuel
was down 2 percent last week from a year earlier, MasterCard
Advisors said yesterday.  The amount of motor fuel supplied by refiners fell 148,000
barrels to 9.6 million barrels a day, reversing two weeks of
gains, the API said.  Gasoline futures for June delivery declined as much as 1.2
percent today to $2.9582 a gallon. Prices climbed 1.9 percent
yesterday to settle at $2.9928. The fuel has dropped 14 percent
in May.  U.S. crude inventories shrank 860,000 barrels last week to
368.1 million, ending a six-week increase, based on the API
report. The Energy Department report may show stockpiles fell
1.5 million barrels, according to the median estimate of 13
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News.  Crude Supplies  Oil-supply totals from the API and the Energy Department
have moved in the same direction 72 percent of the time over the
past year, according to Bloomberg calculations. Gasoline-supply
totals in the two reports have moved in the same direction about
74 percent of the time.  Japan , the world’s third-largest crude consumer, cut oil
imports last month after the March 11 earthquake shut refineries
and disrupted factories. Overseas purchases fell 14 percent from
a year earlier to 16.97 million kiloliters in April, the  finance
ministry  said in a preliminary trade report today.  Brent futures rose yesterday after Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
and Morgan Stanley increased their price forecasts. The conflict
in Libya has reduced spare production capacity in the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, the banks said.  Brent Premium  The European benchmark crude has advanced 18 percent this
year as unrest in the Middle East and North Africa toppled
leaders in Tunisia and  Egypt  and spread to  Libya , Iran and
 Syria . North Atlantic Treaty Organization aircraft struck
targets in Tripoli as the coalition intensified its attacks on
forces loyal to Libyan leader  Muammar Qaddafi .  Brent was at a premium of $12.96 a barrel to  New York- 
traded West Texas Intermediate grade today. The difference
between front-month contracts in  London  and New York surged to a
record $19.54 on Feb. 21. It averaged 76 cents last year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
