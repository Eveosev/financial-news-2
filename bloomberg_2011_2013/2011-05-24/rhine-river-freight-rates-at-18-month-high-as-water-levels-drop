The cost of shipping oil products on
the Rhine River advanced to the highest in 18 months as low
water levels cut the amount that can be shipped on barges.  The cost of shipping gasoil to Duisburg in  Germany  from
Rotterdam or Amsterdam rose to 9 euros ($12.66) a metric ton
yesterday, the highest price since November 2009, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg News. Gasoil is used in heating.  “Barges are loading much less than usual, half capacity at
the most,” said Juergen Neumann, a Duisburg-based operations
manager at logistics company Rhenus AG & Co. “Two barges are
being used when one would normally do.”  The Rhine links industrial sites including BP Plc’s
Gelsenkirchen refinery and BASF SE’s Ludwigshafen chemicals site
to Rotterdam,  Europe ’s busiest port. A canal system running into
Poland, the  Czech Republic  and  Austria  joins the Rhine at
Duisburg, west of the Gelsenkirchen plant.  The barge clearance level at Cologne, south of Duisburg,
dropped for a second day to 153 centimeters (60 inches)
yesterday, according to German government data available on
Bloomberg. Clearance levels mark the depth at which a barge can
travel without the risk of running aground.  Water levels farther upstream are also falling. The
clearance level at Rheinfelden, Germany, near the Swiss border,
declined for a fifth day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
