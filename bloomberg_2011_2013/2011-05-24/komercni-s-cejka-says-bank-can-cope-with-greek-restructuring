Komercni Banka AS (KOMB) , the Czech unit of
 France ’s  Societe Generale (GLE)  SA, can cope with an eventual
restructuring of Greek debt, Chief Financial Officer Pavel Cejka
said.  The bank’s holdings of Greek state bonds have been marked
to market and exposure amounts to 7.5 billion koruna ($431
million), he said in an interview for the  Patria Online  website.
Exposure to Portuguese, Irish and Spanish debt is negligible, he
said.  A restructuring of Greek debt “can by no means” affect
Komercni’s stability, its capital and lending capacity, Cejka
said. The bank expects revenue to increase “several percent”
this year, mainly because of loan growth, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
