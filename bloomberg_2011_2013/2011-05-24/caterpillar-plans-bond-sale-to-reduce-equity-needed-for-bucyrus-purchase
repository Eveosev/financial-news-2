Caterpillar Inc. (CAT) , the world’s largest
maker of construction equipment, sold $4.5 billion of bonds in
its biggest corporate debt sale on record to help fund its $8.6
billion acquisition of Bucyrus International Inc.  The balance of the acquisition will be paid for with $800
million in commercial paper and $3.3 billion of cash on hand,
Moody’s Investors Service said in a note today, assigning A2
ratings to the debt.  Caterpillar stockpiled almost $4.9 billion of cash and
short-term investments at the end of March as the Peoria,
Illinois-based company seeks to minimize equity needed to buy
U.S. mining-equipment maker Bucyrus, investor relations director
 Mike DeWalt  said on an April 29 earnings call. Caterpillar is
purchasing South Milwaukee, Wisconsin-based Bucyrus to expand
the range of mining equipment it offers and to tap into booming
demand for commodities.  From a debt-to-capital perspective, Caterpillar “finished
the first quarter with the strongest balance sheet we’ve had in
more than 20 years,” Chief Financial Officer Ed Rapp said on
the call.  The original funding plan for the acquisition contemplated
issuing as much as $2 billion of equity, Moody’s said.  Jim Dugan , a Caterpillar spokesman, declined to comment.  The offering, Caterpillar’s largest, was the company’s only
offering of floating-rate securities in records dating to 1991,
Bloomberg data show.  Relative Yields  Caterpillar’s sale included 18-month and two-year floating-
rate notes and three-, 10-, and 30-year fixed-rate bonds,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The $500 million of 18-month floating-rate debt pays 10
basis points more than the three-month London interbank offered
rate, and the $750 million of two-year floating-rate securities
pay a spread of 17 basis points. The $750 million of 1.375
percent, three-year notes pay 50 basis points more than similar-
maturity Treasuries, the $1.25 billion of 3.9 percent, 10-year
debt pay a spread of 85 basis points, and the $1.25 billion of
5.2 percent, 30-year bonds offer 98 basis points more than
benchmarks, Bloomberg data show.  Three-month Libor, a lending benchmark for banks, was set
at 0.255 percent today, the lowest since March 8, 2010. A basis
point is 0.01 percentage point.  JPMorgan Chase & Co.,  Barclays Capital  and Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc managed the sale, according to a regulatory
filing today.  Costs Spiked  Caterpillar hasn’t issued debt at the parent-company level
since 2008, Bloomberg data show. The company typically sells
bonds through Caterpillar Financial Services Corp., a unit that
offers equipment financing and loans for customers and dealers.  Its $900 million of 7.9 percent notes issued in December
2008 traded on May 18 at 129.7 cents on the dollar at a spread
of 26 basis points, according to Trace, the bond-price reporting
system of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. The 10-
year bonds priced at a spread of 525 basis points, as borrowing
costs spiked following the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc.  The 4 percentage point difference between the 10-year notes
issued then and those offered today mean the company could save
an average $40 million a year in interest on $1 billion of
bonds.  The maker of trucks, wheel loaders and excavators issued
the senior notes in lieu of drawing on its unsecured bridge loan
from JPMorgan, which allows financing of up to $8.6 billion,
according to today’s filing. The bridge lender commitments will
be reduced by the amount of bonds sold.  The company has $19.9 billion of long-term debt maturing
after one year, according to today’s filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
