Food, beverages, health care and
other industries less dependent on economic growth may fail to
provide the stock-market leadership that many investors expect
for some time, according to Jeffrey Palma, a global strategist
at UBS AG.  This conclusion is drawn from the performance of stocks
after historical highs in the  Institute for Supply Management ’s
manufacturing index, which Palma analyzed in a report published
two days ago.  The CHART OF THE DAY shows the ISM gauge’s monthly swings
since 1973, along with 10 “cyclical peaks” that were
highlighted in the study and this year’s high of 61.4, reached
in February. Readings of more than 50 signal expansion.  Palma compared the moves in so-called defensive stocks and
cyclical shares, whose sales and earnings are most closely tied
to economic expansion, on a global basis around each peak. The
tracking began one year before each high was reached and ended
18 months afterward.  For the 10 months following the ISM’s peaks, there was
almost no difference between these two categories of stocks on
average, according to the report. Defensive industries were the
leaders afterward.  Investors ought to stay “balanced between cyclical and
defensive sectors,” Palma wrote. He recommended that holdings
of health care, technology and telecommunications shares exceed
the groups’ weighting in global benchmarks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
