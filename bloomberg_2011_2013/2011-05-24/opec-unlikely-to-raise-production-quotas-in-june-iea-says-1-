The Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries is unlikely to increase crude production
quotas at its June 8 meeting, said  Richard Jones , deputy
executive director of the  International Energy Agency .  “I would be skeptical,” he said today at a press
conference in Brussels. “Knowing OPEC politics, it would be
difficult to make a decision in June.”  Crude markets are “pretty tight” due to production
outages in Libya, and the IEA is urging producers to add more
supply to the market, Jones said.  “We know they are likely to get even tighter, so we are
trying to get people to think ahead,” he said. “We are urging
all producers to see what they can do. We want them to look at
the situation and we are prepared to help too.”  The agency’s  governing board  last week said there was a
“clear, urgent need for additional supplies” to be added to
the oil market.  -- With assistance from Lananh Nguyen in  London . Editors: Rob
