Cotton futures rose for the first
time in four sessions as a drought in Texas and storms across
the Great Plains threatened crops in the U.S., the world’s
leading exporter.  Orange juice  fell.  Parts of Texas, the biggest U.S. cotton grower, are in
“extreme” or “exceptional” drought, the most-severe  rankings 
on the University of Nebraska at Lincoln’s U.S. Drought Monitor.
Violent thunderstorms with hail and tornadoes may hit areas from
Kansas to Texas today, the  National Weather Service  said.  “Parts of Texas are running out of water, and storms are
threatening other crops,” said Louis Barbera, a broker at VIP
Commodities in New York. “The fact of the matter is there is
still a shortage” of cotton, he said.  Cotton futures for July delivery rose 2.79 cents, or 1.8
percent, to $1.5668 at 9:23 a.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in  New
York . The fiber dropped 3.7 percent in the previous three
sessions. Before today, the price gained 85 percent in the past
year on increased demand from  China , the biggest user.  Orange-juice futures for July delivery dropped 0.1 cent to
$1.8075 a pound in New York.  To contact the reporters on this story:
