Dow Chemical Co. (DOW) , the largest U.S.
chemical maker, said it’s facing “headwinds” in the second
quarter including adverse weather that probably eroded sales of
agriculture products and house paint.  Sales at Dow AgroSciences, which makes pesticides and
seeds, and at the coatings unit were hurt “a little bit” by
unusually wet and cold weather in the U.S., Chief Financial
Officer William H. Weideman said today on a webcast presentation
from the Goldman Sachs Basic Materials Conference in New York.  “Demand is still on a steady recovery in the U.S.,”
Weideman said. “There are some headwinds we are seeing in the
second quarter.”  Sales to carmakers have been hurt by a parts shortage
stemming from the March earthquake and tsunami in  Japan , he
said. Dow, based in Midland, Michigan, supplies plastics, wire
coatings and foams to the auto industry. Asian demand for
polyethylene plastic dipped for three weeks in the quarter in
anticipation of lower prices, Weideman said.  Total demand is “strong” in  Latin America , Asia and
northern and eastern  Europe , Weideman said. Dow, which got two-
thirds of revenue last year from outside the U.S., plans to
boost production of ethylene, a key plastics ingredient, by 20
percent within three years. The plastics business has “upward
momentum” as supplies tighten and U.S. natural gas remains
inexpensive relative to oil, he said.  Dow fell 14 cents to $35.47 at 4:15 p.m. in  New York  Stock
Exchange composite trading. The shares have gained 3.9 percent
this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
