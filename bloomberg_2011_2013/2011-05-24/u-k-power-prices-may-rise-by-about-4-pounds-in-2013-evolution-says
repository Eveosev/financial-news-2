U.K. power may rise by about 4 pounds
a megawatt-hour in 2013 as power stations are required to buy
all their carbon permits, according to Evolution Securities.  Costs to generate power may rise as utilities must purchase
all emissions allowances rather than have a portion given to
them for free, Lakis Athanasiou, a London-based Evolution
Securities analyst, said in an e-mailed note ahead of a
presentation today in  London . This may lead to negative earnings
before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization for fossil-
fueled power stations unless permanent plant closures are
announced, he said.  U.K. power for winter 2013 traded at 62 pounds a megawatt-
hour yesterday, according to broker data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
