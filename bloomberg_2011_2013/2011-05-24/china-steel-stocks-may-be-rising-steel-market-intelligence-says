Steel inventories may be rising in
China, the world’s biggest producer of the metal, as economic
growth slows and output climbs before potential power cuts,
Steel Market Intelligence said.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. today cut its forecast for Chinese
gross domestic product growth in 2011 to 9.4 percent from 10
percent. GDP gained 9.8 percent last year, according to
government figures. The reduction underscores increasing concern
among investors about the effect of Premier Wen Jiabao’s efforts
to curb credit and rein in inflation in the world’s fastest-
growing major economy.  “Logic would dictate that there are invisible Chinese
inventories piling up ahead of cutbacks, which worries us about
the direction of the global market,”  Michelle Applebaum ,
managing partner at Chicago-based Steel Market Intelligence,
said in a note yesterday. She cited rising steel production in
the country, a weakening economy and possible power rationing
this summer.  China may face an electricity shortfall of 30 million
kilowatts during this year’s summer peak that might reduce
industrial output by 3.6 percentage points, analysts including
Lu Yanjin at Industrial Securities wrote in a report on May 20.
The country made about 47 percent of the world’s crude steel in
April, according to the World Steel Association.  National steel production rose 9.1 percent from a year
earlier to 232.6 million metric tons in this year’s first four
months, according to the  China  Economic Information Network.  To contact the reporter on this story:
