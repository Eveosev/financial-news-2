Digital libraries may be able to
include more copyrighted works under European Union rules
proposed today.  The  European Commission  is seeking to bolster the EU-funded
Internet library  Europeana , a rival to the  Internet book service 
operated by  Google Inc. (GOOG) , owner of the most popular Internet-
search engine.  Some so-called orphan works, including newspapers and video
footage for which no one can be identified to authorize digital
use, may be included in digital libraries after a “diligent
search” can’t trace the author, the commission said.  Some 40 percent of the British Library’s copyrighted works
cannot be digitized because authors can’t be located, the
commission said. Google has said it doesn’t scan copyrighted
material in European libraries.  Michel Barnier , the EU’s internal market commissioner, said
he will also fulfil a promise to submit proposals later this
year to simplify music rights, in a move that may aid  Apple
Inc. (AAPL) ’s iTunes and other music services to open EU-wide stores.  Music services must currently seek permission from each of
the EU’s 27 nations before they can sell a track across the
bloc.  Barnier said he would examine how levies are charged
on electronic devices and blank disks in some European countries
to compensate copyright holders for private copying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
