A car exploded outside a Kazakh
National Security Committee detention center in the Kazakh
capital of Astana, Interfax reported, citing Kenzhebulat
Beknazarov, a spokesman for the successor agency to the Soviet-
era KGB.  The car caught fire and exploded, Interfax said, citing
Beknazarov. An investigation will be completed soon, the Russian
news service said.  One or two people were sitting inside the car, a red BMW,
Interfax said, citing unidentified eyewitnesses.  Beknazarov wasn’t available for comments when Bloomberg
News called his office and mobile phones.  A suicide bombing in the Kazakh town of Aktobe caused
several casualties, Interfax said May 17. The blast occurred
opposite a building that houses the National Security
Committee’s local branch, Interfax said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
