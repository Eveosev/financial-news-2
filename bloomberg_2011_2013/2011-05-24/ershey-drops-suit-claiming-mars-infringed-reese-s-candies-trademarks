Hershey Co. (HSY) , the maker of Reese’s
candies, dropped a lawsuit against Mars Inc. in which it claimed
Mars’s packaging for its Dove peanut butter and chocolate bars
infringed trademarks for Reese’s.  Hershey and Mars agreed to “dismiss with prejudice all
claims asserted in this action,” according to a filing
yesterday in federal court in Harrisburg,  Pennsylvania . No
details were given for the dismissal.  Hershey sued in November, claiming that Mars used an orange
background for its Dove candies that had been trademarked for
Reese’s Peanut Butter cups and Reese’s Pieces. The use of the
color would “confuse consumers” about the source of the
product, Hershey claimed.  Jeff Beckman, a spokesman for Hershey, Pennsylvania-based
Hershey, and Lauren Nodzak, a spokeswoman for McLean, Virginia-
based Mars, didn’t immediately return calls seeking comment.  Mars filed an action against Hershey in federal court in
 Virginia  in November seeking a ruling that it wasn’t infringing
Hershey’s trademarks. That action is also dismissed.  Hershey fell 6 cents to $55.08 at 12:31 p.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading. The stock has risen 17 percent
this year. Mars’s shares don’t trade publicly.  The Hershey case is The Hershey Co. v. Mars Inc., 10-02417,
U.S. District Court, Middle District of Pennsylvania
(Harrisburg). The Mars case is Mars Inc. v. The Hershey Co.,
10-01325, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Virginia
(Alexandria).  To contact the reporter on this story:
