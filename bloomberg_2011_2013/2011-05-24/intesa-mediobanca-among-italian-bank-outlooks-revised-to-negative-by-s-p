Intesa Sanpaolo SpA (ISP) ,  Mediobanca SpA (MB) 
and two other Italian banks had their credit outlook lowered to
negative by Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services after a similar
change at the country level four days ago.  “Our outlook revision on the four banks and their core
subsidiaries follows the weakening we see in the
creditworthiness of the sovereign, as reflected in our outlook
revision on the Republic of Italy,” S&P said today in a report.
The ratings company also revised the outlook for Banca Nazionale
del Lavoro SpA and Findomestic to negative.  Italy’s credit outlook was revised on May 20 to negative
from stable by S&P, which cited the country’s persistently high
debt ratio and weak growth prospects. The economy expanded less
than economists forecast in the first quarter as export gains
were offset by weak domestic demand.  “The negative outlook on these banks reflects the fact
that we would lower their ratings in the case of a sovereign
downgrade, given their predominantly domestic business
profiles,” S&P said.  Intesa,  Italy ’s second-biggest bank, fell 2 percent to 1.66
euros as of 12:31 p.m. in Milan trading, cutting the company’s
market value to 27.1 billion euros ($38.2 billion). Mediobanca,
the country’s largest publicly traded investment bank, declined
1.2 percent to 7.33 euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
