Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY)  and  Royal
Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS)  are among 14 U.K. lenders whose debt
Moody’s Investors Service is considering downgrading as
withdrawal of government support may increase credit risk.  Santander U.K. Plc and customer-owned lenders including
 Nationwide Building Society  also had debt ratings put on review
for a possible downgrade. The outlook on  Barclays Plc (BARC) ’s senior
debt and deposit ratings was changed to negative from stable,
Moody’s said.  British banks accepted about 1 trillion pounds ($1.6
trillion) in government bailouts and guarantees following the
2008 financial crisis, support that Moody’s said accounts for
between two and five credit grades for larger U.K. lenders and
one to five levels for smaller lenders. The review comes as
stocks slump globally amid concern  Europe ’s debt crisis is
worsening and the global economic recovery is waning.  The reassessment was initiated in response to guidance from
U.K. authorities “that banks that fail in the future should not
expect capital injections from the public purse,”  Elisabeth Rudman, a senior credit officer at Moody’s, said in the
statement. It “is not driven by either a deterioration in the
financial strength of the banking system or that of the
government.”  Politicians and business groups have criticized British
lenders for failing to boost credit and fuel the nation’s
economy even after receiving government support.  To contact the reporter on this story:
