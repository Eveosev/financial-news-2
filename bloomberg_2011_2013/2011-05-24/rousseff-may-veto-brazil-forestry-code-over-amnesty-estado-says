Brazilian President  Dilma Rousseff 
may veto a forestry code scheduled for a vote in Congress today
should the new legislation include an amnesty for deforestation,
O Estado de S.Paulo newspaper  reported .  Rousseff may veto the bill if it pardons deforestation in
the Amazon or if allows a reduction in the size of protected
areas near rivers and mountains, the newspaper said, citing an
interview with Environment Minister Izabella Teixeira.  The federal government also opposes transferring to states
responsibility for the enforcement of environmental policies,
the newspaper said, citing Workers Party Congressman Candido
Vaccarezza, leader of the government coalition in the Lower
House.  To contact the reporter on this story:
