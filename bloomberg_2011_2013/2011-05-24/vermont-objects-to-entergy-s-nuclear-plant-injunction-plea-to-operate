Entergy Corp. (ETR)  lost a bid to stop
 Vermont  from closing its Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Station
after a judge ruled that it hadn’t shown any irreparable harm
would occur pending the outcome of a trial scheduled to start in
September.  U.S. District Judge J. Garvan Murtha in Brattleboro,
Vermont, said blocking the proposed March closing wouldn’t
ameliorate any harm that may occur between now and a decision at
Entergy’s trial challenging Vermont’s efforts to prevent the
company from continuing operations, according to a ruling today.  “Our request for a preliminary injunction was about
keeping the plant’s workers employed, the plant running safely
and the electric grid reliable until this case is resolved,”
Alex Schott, a company spokesman, said in an e-mail. “In the
upcoming days, we will be evaluating Judge Murtha’s opinion and
assessing the company’s near-term options.”  New Orleans-based Entergy, the second-largest operator of
nuclear  power plants  in the U.S., sued Vermont in April,
claiming that the state breached an agreement with the company.  Exelon Corp. is the largest U.S. nuclear plant operator.  The case is Entergy Corp. v. Shumlin, 11-00099, U.S.
District Court, District of Vermont (Brattleboro).  To contact the reporter about this story:
