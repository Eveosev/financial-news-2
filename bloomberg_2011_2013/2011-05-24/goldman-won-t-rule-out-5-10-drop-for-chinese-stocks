Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  said it
wouldn’t “rule out” a further decline of up to 10 percent for
Chinese stocks as growth in the world’s second-biggest economy
slows and inflation accelerates.  The U.S. bank cut its forecasts for  China ’s gross domestic
product growth for this year and next to 9.4 percent and 9.2
percent respectively, while raising its inflation forecasts to
4.7 percent and 3 percent, without specifying its previous
projections. Goldman Sachs also lowered its end-2011 target for
the Hang Seng China Enterprises Index, which tracks Chinese
companies listed in Hong Kong, to 14,500 from 16,500 amid
“policy intervention” and higher  oil prices . The index rose
0.1 percent to 12,635.30 at 10:09 a.m. in  Hong Kong .  “We would not rule out a correction of up to 5 percent to
10 percent near term, triggered by earnings per-share cuts, but
would buy on such dips given low earnings risks, valuation,
likely policy inflection,” Goldman Sachs analysts led by Helen Zhu and Timothy Moe said in a report today. It expects inflation
to peak in June and forecasts “normalization of policy sometime
in the third quarter in 2011,” according to the report.  The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index has dropped 7.6
percent from a five-month high on April 11 amid concern the
government measures to cool inflation will hurt growth and erode
companies’ earnings. The gauge is trading at 10.3 estimated
earnings, compared with an average 14.3 times for the past five
years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg News.  The Chinese government has increased  reserve requirements 
for banks 11 times and boosted interest rates four times since
the start of 2010 to cool consumer prices, which exceeded
economists’ estimates in April with a 5.3 percent increase.
China should get used to an inflation rate between 5 percent and
10 percent for an extended period of time, the official Xinhua
News Agency reported May 22, citing Wang Jian, secretary general
of the National Development and Reform Commission’s China
Society of Macroeconomics.  A-Share Plunge  Goldman Sachs downgraded Chinese steel, aluminum and
industrial stocks to “underweight” from “neutral,” while
keeping property and bank shares as top picks.  China’s benchmark stock index may extend declines after
erasing all of its gains for 2011 yesterday as higher  interest
rates  slow economic growth without cooling inflation, ICBC
Credit Suisse Asset Management Co. said.  The Shanghai Composite Index slumped 2.9 percent yesterday,
the most since Jan. 17, after a preliminary reading of a
purchasing managers’ index showed China’s manufacturing may
expand at a slower pace this month. The gauge, which tumbled 9.7
percent from a five-month high on April 18, fell 0.5 percent to
2,759.58 today.  “We remain cautious in the near term and we haven’t seen
the bottom yet,” said Hao Kang, a Beijing-based  fund manager  at
ICBC Credit Suisse Asset, which oversees $8.7 billion. “The
economy’s definitely slowing but we’ve yet to see inflation
easing. Although a short-term bounce is possible, it’s not the
time for bottom fishing. We need to see a clearer policy
signal.”  --Irene Shen. Editors: Allen Wan, Reinie Booysen  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
