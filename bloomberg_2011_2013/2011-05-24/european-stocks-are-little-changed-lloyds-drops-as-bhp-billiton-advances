European stocks were little changed
before reports on German business confidence and U.S. new-home
purchases. Asian stocks swung between gains and losses and U.S.
futures advanced.  Lloyds Banking Group Plc led financial shares lower,
declining 1.1 percent, after Moody’s Investors Service said it
might consider downgrading the debt of some British lenders. BHP
Billiton Ltd, the world’s biggest mining company, gained 0.9
percent as metal prices rose. BT Group Plc climbed 1.1 percent
after UBS AG raised its recommendation on the stock.  The benchmark Stoxx Europe 600 Index rose less than 0.1
percent to 274.82 at 8:03 a.m. in  London . The index fell last
week after Greek 10-year bond yields climbed to a record and
Fitch Ratings cut  Greece ’s credit rating to B+, four notches
below investment grade. The Stoxx 600 yesterday erased its gains
for the year after Spain’s ruling Socialist Party suffered its
worst election defeat in 30 years and  Standard & Poor’s  said it
may downgrade Italy’s debt.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
