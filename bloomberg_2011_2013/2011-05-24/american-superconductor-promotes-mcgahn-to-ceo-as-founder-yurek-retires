American Superconductor Corp. (AMSC) , a
maker of wind-turbine components, promoted Daniel McGahn to
chief executive officer, effective June 1.  McGahn will succeed founder Gregory Yurek, 64, who is
retiring after more than two decades with the Devens,
Massachusetts-based company. The promotion is part of a
succession plan the board has been considering since late 2010,
American Superconductor said today in a statement.  McGahn, 39, is currently American Superconductor’s
president and chief operating officer, and was also appointed to
its board. Yurek will remain chairman until the company’s annual
shareholder meeting in August and will serve as an advisor for
two years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
