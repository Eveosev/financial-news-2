U.S. Gulf oil grades strengthened as
the spread between the West Texas Intermediate and Brent
widened.  The gap between WTI and its European counterpart for July
delivery increased 50 cents to $12.90 a barrel at 2:50 p.m. in
 New York . The differential for the contract nearest to
expiration reached a record $15.94 on Feb. 16.  When Brent gains versus WTI, it strengthens the value of
low-sulfur U.S. grades that compete with West African oil priced
against the European benchmark.  Light Louisiana Sweet’s premium gained 25 cents to $14.75
over WTI at 2:24 p.m. in New York, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Heavy Louisiana Sweet’s premium to WTI strengthened
30 cents to $14.25 a barrel.  Among sour, or high-sulfur, grades, the premium for Mars
Blend added 55 cents to $8.25 a barrel over WTI. Poseidon’s
premium widened 60 cents to $7.85.  Thunder Horse’s premium lost 50 cents to $12.50 a barrel
over WTI. Southern Green Canyon’s premium added 75 cents to
$7.25 a barrel.  West  Texas  Sour’s discount was unchanged at $2.55 a barrel.
It has tracked more closely to its historical average discount
versus WTI because it’s delivered in Midland, Texas, away from
the  Gulf Coast  and close to Cushing,  Oklahoma , the delivery
point for oil traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange .  The premium for Syncrude gained 50 cents to $10.25 a
barrel. Syncrude is a light, low-sulfur synthetic oil derived
from the  tar sands  in Alberta.  The discount for Western Canada Select widened 25 cents to
$17.25 a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
