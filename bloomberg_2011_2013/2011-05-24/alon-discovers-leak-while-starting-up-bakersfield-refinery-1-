Alon USA Energy Inc. (ALJ)  is trying to
identify the source of a hydrogen sulfide leak at its
Bakersfield, California, refinery that was discovered while
operators were starting up production.  The company has evacuated all contractors from the units,
said Gordon Leaman, the refinery’s general manager. According to
a  notice filed with state regulators , the leak was discovered at
8:10 a.m. local time today.  Alon said in March that it expected to start the
hydrocracker at the refinery by mid-2011. The company plans to
process vacuum gas oil produced from its other California
refineries. Alon bought the refinery from Flying J Inc.  “We don’t know yet” whether the leak will affect
production start-up at the plant, Leaman said. Firefighters and
a hazmat team are on site, he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
