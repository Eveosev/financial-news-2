More than 250 Colombians have been
blockaded by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of  Colombia  as the
rebels surround a farming area in western Choco Province and
obstruct rivers to prevent boats passing through,  Radio Caracol 
reported.  Food is beginning to run out in the area, Caracol cited
Luis Moreno, mayor of Medio Atrato, as saying. Colombian army
troops are trying to clear the area of the FARC, as the drug-
funded guerrillas are known.  To contact the reporter on this story:
