Colombia ’s peso held near a one-month
low on speculation the government is buying dollars in the spot
market as it seeks to ease gains in the local currency.  The peso was little changed at 1,826.10 per  U.S. dollar  at
11:09 a.m. New York time, from 1,826.80 yesterday. It touched
1,831.20 on May 17, its weakest level since April 19. The peso
has gained 4.3 percent this year, the second-best performance
after the Mexican peso among six Latin American currencies
tracked by Bloomberg.  “Traders don’t want to bet on gains in the peso knowing
the Treasury may intervene in the market,” said Daniel
Velandia, head analyst at Bogota-based brokerage Correval SA.  Finance Minister Juan Carlos Echeverry said in April that
the government would create an overseas fund with as much as
$1.2 billion from dollars bought in the local  spot market 
through the end of 2011, and forgo repatriating funds from
abroad for the rest of the year. That comes on top of the
central bank’s plans to buy a minimum of $20 million daily until
at least June 17.  The yield on the nation’s 10 percent bonds due July 2024
fell two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 8.22
percent, according to Colombia’s stock exchange. The security’s
price rose 0.137 centavo to 113.954 centavos per peso.  To contact the reporter on this story:
