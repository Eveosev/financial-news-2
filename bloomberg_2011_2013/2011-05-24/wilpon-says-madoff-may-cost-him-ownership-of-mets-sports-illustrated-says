New York Mets owner  Fred Wilpon  says
the $1 billion lawsuit filed by  Irving Picard  on behalf of
people who lost money in the Bernard Madoff scandal may cost him
ownership of the team, Sports Illustrated reported.  Former New York Governor  Mario Cuomo  is acting as mediator
between Picard and Wilpon, who says he is willing to negotiate a
settlement for the $295 million in fictitious profits from his
account with Madoff but not the $700 million he and his partners
invested in the six years before the financier was arrested, the
magazine said, quoting from an interview with the team owner.  Amanda Remus, a spokeswoman for Picard’s firm, Baker &
Hostetler LLP, said the firm declined to comment.  Wilpon told Sports Illustrated that investments his group,
Sterling Partners, made with Madoff returned 10 to 12 percent
and he was convinced that it was legitimate.  Wilpon is seeking to sell between 25 percent and 49 percent
of the Major League Baseball team, which was valued by Forbes
magazine at $858 million. Picard has said Wilpon and his
partners should have known about the fraud given “red flags”
and should have investigated the arrangement more. He is seeking
as much as $1 billion in what he says are illegitimate profits.  To contact the reporter on this story:
