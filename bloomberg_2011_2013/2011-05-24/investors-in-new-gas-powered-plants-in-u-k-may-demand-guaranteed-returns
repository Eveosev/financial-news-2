Investors in all types of U.K. power
plants may demand guaranteed government returns in the wake of
new rules for the electricity market, Evolution Securities said.  Britain has  proposed  shifting its  energy policy  to rein in
the free-market structures imposed in the early 1990s to help
replace aging fossil-fueled and nuclear plants with low-carbon
alternatives. The Department of Energy and Climate Change
recommended guaranteeing long-term prices for low-carbon energy
such as nuclear and wind power and setting a minimum price for
CO2 emissions.  Some 50,000 megawatts of new “thermal capacity,” stations
that burn fossil fuels such as coal and gas, is required by
2030, Lakis Athanasiou, a London-based Evolution Securities
analyst, said in an e-mailed note ahead of a presentation in
 London  today. Developers won’t agree to build this without long-
term government contracts, given the support it has already
committed for nuclear and renewable generation, he said.  “Government will have to enter into long-term contracts”
for what is known as combined cycle gas-turbine generation,
Athanasiou said.  A panel of lawmakers on May 16 criticized the government’s
so-called  electricity market  reform for favoring nuclear power.
The energy and climate change committee said the changes
amounted to a subsidy for nuclear. It suggested changes in
trading power contracts to improve future pricing transparency
and attract new entrants to build power stations.  To contact the reporters on this story:
