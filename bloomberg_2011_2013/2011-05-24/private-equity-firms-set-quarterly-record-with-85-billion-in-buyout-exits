Private-equity firms exited buyout
investments at a record volume in the second quarter as managers
took advantage of equity markets to sell assets, according to
 Preqin Ltd.   Buyout firms have sold 201 stakes valued at $85 billion so
far this quarter, 5 percent more than the record established in
the last three months of 2010, when companies exited 325 deals
worth $81.3 billion, the London-based research firm said in a
statement today.  Transactions were particularly active in  Europe , where 82
sales valued at $57.9 billion have taken place in the second
quarter, double the previous quarter’s $28.6 billion, Preqin
said. Globally, half of the 10 largest exits so far this quarter
were from deals made during the buyout boom of 2005 to 2007,
Preqin said.  “Exit values are at record levels as fund managers take
advantage of current market conditions to exit investments made
both during the buyout-boom era and post-financial crisis,”
Manuel Carvalho, manager of private-equity deals at Preqin, said
in the statement. “Capital is increasingly being returned to
investors, and this will be committed to new funds if investors
intend to maintain their current allocation levels.”  The largest exit this quarter is the sale of Zurich-based
Nycomed by  Nordic Capital  and Credit Suisse Group AG’s private-
equity group to Takeda Pharmaceutical Co. for 9.6 billion euros
($15.53 billion), Preqin said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
