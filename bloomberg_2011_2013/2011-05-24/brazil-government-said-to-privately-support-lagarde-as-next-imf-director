Brazil  will privately support French
Finance Minister  Christine Lagarde ’s candidacy to run the
 International Monetary Fund , a Brazilian government official
familiar with the negotiations said.  The Brazilian government sees no point in backing Mexican
central bank Governor Agustin Carstens’s bid for the job given
that Lagarde will have enough votes to win, said the official,
who requested anonymity because he isn’t authorized to speak
publicly about the issue.  In exchange for its private support for the European
candidate, Brazil will push for Lagarde to run the IMF only
until the end of next year, when former head Dominique Strauss- Kahn’s term would have expired, the official said. Brazil
doesn’t plan to declare that support openly, he said  Brazil also wants to ensure the that an overhaul giving
emerging markets countries more votes at the IMF is pushed
forward and that there is an agreement to end  Europe ’s monopoly
on the top job at the fund, the official said.  The Washington-based IMF is seeking to find a replacement
by June 30 for Strauss-Kahn, who resigned last week following
his arrest on sexual assault charges in New York.  Strauss-Kahn’s five-year term had 17 months remaining. In
past successions, some managing directors were appointed to
fresh five-year tenures.  To contact the reporter on this story:
