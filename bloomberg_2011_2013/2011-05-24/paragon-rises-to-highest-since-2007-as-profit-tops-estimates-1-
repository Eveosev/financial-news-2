Paragon Group Cos. shares rose to the
highest since November 2007 in London trading after fiscal
first-half earnings beat analysts’ estimates and the U.K.’s
third-largest mortgage provider to landlords reported its first
six-month increase in revenue since before the credit crunch.  Net income for the six months ended March 31 increased 35
percent to 28.5 million pounds ($46 million), or 9.3 pence a
share, from 21.1 million pounds, or 7 pence, a year earlier, the
Solihull, England-based company said in a statement today.  Net
income beat the median estimate of 24.6 million pounds according
to four analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  “The good news is apparent,” RBC Capital Markets analyst
Peter Lenardos, who rates the stock “top pick,” said in a note
to clients today. The “results exceeded both our and consensus
forecasts, and in most cases by double digit percentages.”  Paragon re-entered the lending market in the fourth quarter
of 2010. Chief Executive Officer Nigel Terrington today
reiterated Paragon’s intention to do its first securitization
since 2007 during the third quarter.  The shares rose as much as 6.4 percent to 200.3 pence, the
highest since November 2007 and were up 3.4 pence, or 1.8
percent, at 191.6 pence at 10:32 a.m., lifting its market value
to about 573 million pounds. The stock has gained 38 percent
over the past year.  Net Interest Income  Net interest income fell 2.9 percent to 67.4 million pounds
from a year earlier, Paragon said. It rose 5.3 percent from the
six months ended September 30. The company forecast “strong”
loan growth in the second half.  “It marks a point of inflexion,” Terrington said in an
interview. “It has changed the business from one which was
contracting to one that is actually growing. The next crucial
point will be when the balance sheet starts growing.”  Paragon increased its first-half dividend by 12.5 percent
to 1.35 pence a share.  “We see clear potential estimates beyond the level of
first-half performance,” JPMorgan Cazenove analyst Paul
Measday, who rates the stock “overweight,” said in a note to
clients today. Measday may raise his estimate for full-year
pretax profit by as much as 10 percent, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
