European stocks advanced, with the
benchmark Stoxx Europe 600 Index rebounding from a one-month
low, as commodities rallied and a report showed that U.S. new-
home sales increased more than forecast last month.  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , the world’s biggest mining company, and
 Rio Tinto  Group, the third largest, both gained more than 1.5
percent as metal prices rose.  Travis Perkins Plc (TPK)  climbed 2.7
percent after Jefferies Group Inc. recommended buying the
company’s shares.  Renewable Energy  Corp. slumped 17 percent to
the lowest price since its initial public offering in 2006.  The Stoxx 600 rose 0.2 percent to 275.39 at the 4:30 p.m.
close in  London . The index fell last week after Greek 10-year
bond yields climbed to a record and Fitch Ratings cut  Greece ’s
credit rating to B+, four notches below investment grade. The
Stoxx 600 yesterday erased its gains for the year after  Spain ’s
ruling Socialist Party suffered its worst election defeat in 30
years and  Standard & Poor’s  said it may downgrade Italy’s debt.  “Even if economic growth isn’t as strong, in the long term
commodity stocks always tend to go higher,” said Jacques Porta,
a Paris-based  fund manager  at Ofi Patrimoine, who helps oversee
about $425 million in stocks. “I’m overweight on them. Everyone
is. It’s a story of supply and demand. Emerging markets are big
consumers of commodities.”  German business confidence remained unexpectedly unchanged
in May as booming exports and rising company spending boosted
economic growth. The Ifo institute in Munich said its business
climate index, based on a survey of 7,000 executives, held at
114.2, the same as in April. Economists had forecast a decline
to 113.7, the median of 24 predictions in a Bloomberg News
survey showed.  U.S. Home Sales  In the U.S., a Commerce Department report showed that
purchases of new houses rose in April to the most so far this
year. Sales climbed 7.3 percent to a 323,000 annual pace last
month. The median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey of
economists called for sales at a 300,000 annual rate, unchanged
from the prior month. Housing prices rose from a year earlier.  National benchmark indexes gained in 14 of the 18 western
European markets.  France ’s  CAC 40 Index (CAC)  climbed 0.3 percent.
 Germany ’s  DAX Index (DAX)  and the U.K.’s  FTSE 100 Index (UKX)  both increased
0.4 percent.  Of the 314 Stoxx 600 companies that have reported earnings
since April 11, 58 percent have beaten analysts’ estimates,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  BHP, Rio, Xstrata  BHP Billiton  climbed 1.8 percent to 2,345 pence as copper,
lead, zinc and aluminum advanced in London. Rio Tinto increased
2 percent to 4,115 pence and  Xstrata Plc (XTA)  rose 1.7 percent to
1,381 pence. A gauge of basic-resource shares was the second-
best performing of the 19 industry groups in the Stoxx 600.
Commodities rebounded from their biggest drop in almost two
weeks after Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said it’s turning “more
bullish” on raw materials.  Anglo American Plc (AAL)  increased 1.5 percent to 2,873.5 pence.
 Kazakhmys Plc (KAZ) , a Kazakh copper miner listed in London, gained
2.3 percent to 1,235 pence.  Antofagasta Plc (ANTO) , the copper producer
controlled by Chile’s Luksic family, jumped 3.1 percent to 1,196
pence.  Travis Perkins jumped 2.7 percent to 1,028 pence. The
shares were initiated with a “buy” rating at Jefferies, which
said the stock has 30 percent upside potential.  Arkema SA (AKE)  surged 3.1 percent to 74 euros. The stock was
raised to “overweight” from “neutral” at HSBC, which said
its valuation is the cheapest among European chemical companies.  Mitie, Gas Natural  Mitie Group Plc (MTO)  rallied 5.2 percent to 231.9 pence, its
second day of gains, after the company yesterday reported
results that showed “an encouraging pick-up in organic
growth,” according to a report from UBS AG analyst Alex Hugh,
who raised his price estimate on the shares 7.7 percent to 280
pence each. Royal Bank of Scotland Group analyst Kean Marden
wrote in a report today that the company’s organic sales growth
guidance may be “conservative.”  Gas Natural SDG SA (GAS)  added 1 percent to 13.06 euros. The
company plans to increase its capital and give  Algeria ’s
national oil company Sonatrach a 10 percent stake as part of a
compensation deal, Cinco Dias reported, citing unidentified
people close to the matter.  Gas Natural will make an additional payment in cash,
settling the remaining money it owes Sonatrach in future price
accords for gas supplies, the newspaper said. The Spanish
company said it has yet to reach an agreement with Sonatrach.  Greek Privatizations  Greek stocks advanced after the government announced a
stepped-up plan to sell holdings in companies including  Hellenic
Telecommunications Organization SA. (HTO)   Hellenic Telecom soared 4.3 percent to 6.77 euros. Hellenic
Postbank SA surged 5 percent to 2.95 euros after the government
said it may sell all its 34 percent stake in the lender this
year.  Marks & Spencer Group Plc (MKS)  declined 2.9 percent to 385.6
pence. The U.K.’s largest clothing retailer said the outlook for
the economy remains challenging as consumers continue to
experience a squeeze on their disposable incomes. The company
reported fiscal full-year underlying pretax profit of 714.3
million pounds ($1.2 billion). That beat the average analyst
estimate of 711 million pounds.  Renewable Energy slumped 17 percent to 12.66 kroner, its
largest drop since February 2010, after the company forecast
that it will make a smaller second-quarter operating profit than
it did in the first quarter. Renewable Energy also said it will
cut its output of wafers, cells and modules in response to
current market conditions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
