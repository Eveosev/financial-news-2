Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni
named ruling party loyalists as vice president and prime
minister, indicating there may be few concessions to a growing
protest movement.  Former parliamentary speaker Edward Kiwanuka Ssekandi will
be vice president, while ex-security minister Amama Mbabazi
becomes prime minister, Ofwono Opondo, deputy spokesman of the
ruling party, said by phone today from the capital, Kampala.  Museveni said Mbabazi was “one of the most ideologically
reliable” of the National Resistance Movement’s members, while
Ssekandi “is a clean, trustworthy and consistent person,”
according to an e-mailed statement from the presidency.  Uganda  has seen a wave of protests against rising prices in
the last two months, with the security forces repeatedly
arresting opposition leader  Kizza Besigye . After winning
elections on Feb. 18, Museveni said at his inauguration on May
12 that he would defeat “disruptive schemes.”  “Ssekandi has been very rigid as speaker, while serving
the interest of the NRM party, while Mbabazi has been loyal to
Museveni since the 1970s,” Yusuf Msibambi, a Kampala-based
attorney, said by phone today. “They will stifle progressive
ideas.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
