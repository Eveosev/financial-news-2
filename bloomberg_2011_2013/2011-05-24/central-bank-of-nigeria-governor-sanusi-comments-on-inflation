Central Bank of Nigeria Lamido Sanusi
made the following comments on inflation after a meeting of the
bank’s monetary policy committee in the capital, Abuja, today.  “Food inflation declined to 10.7 percent in April from
12.2 percent in March.  “ Core inflation  at 12.9 percent in April was slightly
higher than 12.8 percent in March.  “Not withstanding the slight decline in inflation in
April, inflation expectations remain high.”  “The decline in headline inflation was primarily due to
the decline in the prices of food and non-alcoholic beverages
and imported goods.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
