Russia may hold a tender this year
for the rights to explore an offshore deposit near an oil field
developed by the  Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM) .-led Sakhalin-1 project,  RIA
Novosti  reported, citing a government statement.  The deposit, in the Sea of Okhotsk, may hold more than 16
million metric tons of oil and 9.93 billion cubic meters of
natural gas, the Moscow-based  news agency  said, citing the
document.  The Sakhalin-1 partners, which also include OAO Rosneft,
Russia’s largest oil producer, ONGC Videsh Ltd., and  Japan ’s
Sakhalin Oil & Gas Development Co., started producing oil at
Chayvo in 2005. The project also includes the Odoptu field,
which started output last year, and Arkutun-Dagi, which isn’t in
production yet.  To contact the reporter on this story:
