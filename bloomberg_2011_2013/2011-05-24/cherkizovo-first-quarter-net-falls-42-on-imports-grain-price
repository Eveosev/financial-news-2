OAO Cherkizovo Group,  Russia â€™s
largest meat producer, said profit dropped 42 percent in the
first quarter as imports depressed prices and feed grain prices
jumped, compared with a year earlier.  Net income declined to $18.4 million from $31.9 million the
previous year, Cherkizovo said today in a statement. Sales rose
16 percent to $308 million, Cherkizovo said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
