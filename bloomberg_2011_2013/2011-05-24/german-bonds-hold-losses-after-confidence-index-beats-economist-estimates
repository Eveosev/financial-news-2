Germany government bonds stayed lower
after a report showed business confidence was unexpectedly
unchanged in May as booming exports and rising
company spending boosted economic growth.  The yield on the 10-year German bund was four basis points
higher at 3.05 percent as of 9:07 a.m. in  London . The two-year
note yield added three basis points to 1.72 percent.  The Ifo institute in Munich said its business climate
index, based on a survey of 7,000 executives, held at 114.2 from
April. Economists forecast a decline to 113.7, the median of 24
forecasts in a Bloomberg News survey showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
