Mauritius  requires another 10 billion
rupees ($355 million) to modernize its water distribution
network and reduce leakages,  lexpress.mu  said, citing Public
Utilities Minister Rashid Beebeejaun.  From 2005 to date, about 2.3 billion rupees was spent on
the system, the Port Louis-based online newspaper said. About 50
percent of drinking water is currently lost through leakages, it
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
