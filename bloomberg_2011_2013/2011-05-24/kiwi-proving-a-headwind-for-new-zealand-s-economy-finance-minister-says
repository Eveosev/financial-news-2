The  New Zealand  dollar, which has
risen against all its major counterparts in the past three
months, is slowing the nation’s recovery, according to Finance
Minister Bill English.  “It’s a headwind for an economy that needs to grow its
export base significantly,” English said today at a conference
in  Singapore . “Our exporters are adapting to the fact that
rates have been there for a while now, and don’t show too much
sign of abating.”  English said the impact of the rising currency is being
muted by the fact it remains historically low versus that of
 Australia , New Zealand’s largest market.  “It is pretty competitive for New Zealand to be able to
help service this resources boom,” he said. “It’s positive for
us.”  The  New Zealand dollar  traded at 79.44 U.S. cents as of
11:19 a.m. in Singapore, having advanced 6.3 percent in the past
three months. The currency was at NZ$1.3261 versus Australia’s,
after weakening 1.1 percent this year.  The so-called kiwi has advanced 4.9 percent over the past
three months, according to Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted
Currency Indexes, which track 10 developed-nation currencies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
