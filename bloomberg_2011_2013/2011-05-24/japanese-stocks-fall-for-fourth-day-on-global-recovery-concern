Japanese stocks rose for the first
time in four days as investors bought utilities amid increasing
uncertainty about the strength of the global economic recovery
after reports signaled growth is slowing in the U.S. and Europe.  Electricity and gas suppliers had the biggest gain on the
Topix index. Chubu Electric Power Co. increased 3.6 percent.
Nippon Yusen K.K., the country’s largest shipping line by sales,
jumped 3.4 percent after cargo rates increased yesterday and a
SMBC Nikko Securities Inc. analyst maintained his bullish stance
on  Japan ’s shipping line sector.  Toshiba Corp. (6502) , an electronics
maker, increased 2.1 percent after the company said it will
target operating profit of 500 billion yen ($6.1 billion) for
fiscal 2013.  The Nikkei 225 Stock Average rose 0.2 percent to 9,477.17
at the 3 p.m. close of trading in Tokyo. The broader Topix index
gained 0.2 percent to 819.16 with four stocks advancing for
every three that fell.  “Because the state of affairs abroad is opaque, defensive
stocks are rising as they are less risky,” said Yutaka Yoshii,
a strategist at Tokyo-based Mito Securities Co.  The Topix has lost 12 percent since March 10, the day
before a magnitude-9 earthquake and tsunami devastated Japan’s
northeast coast, crippling four of Tokyo Electric Power Co.’s
nuclear reactors and disrupting supply chains at companies from
 Toyota Motor Corp. (7203)  to chipmaker Renesas Electric Corp. Shares in
the gauge traded at 0.98 times estimated book value, compared
with 2.1 for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  Defensive Stocks  So-called defensive stocks including utilities, food
producers and drugmakers, which are less affected by economic
swings, advanced. Chubu Electric gained 3.6 percent to 1,270 yen.
Tokyo Gas Co., a supplier of liquefied natural gas, advanced 2.4
percent to 344 yen.  Japan Tobacco Inc. (2914) , the world’s third-
largest publicly traded maker of cigarettes, rose 1.6 percent to
314,000 yen.  Astellas Pharma Inc. (4503) , Japan’s second-biggest
drugmaker, increased 0.7 percent to 3,065 yen.  The Federal  Reserve Bank  of Chicago’s gauge of U.S.
economic activity unexpectedly dropped below zero in April. The
national index, which draws on 85 economic indicators, was minus
0.45 in April versus 0.32 in March. A reading below zero
indicates below-trend-growth in the national economy.  In  Europe , services and manufacturing growth slowed more
than economists forecast in May. Expansion in a composite index
based on a survey of euro-area purchasing managers in both
industries fell to a seven-month low, London-based Markit
Economics said yesterday.  Domestic Stocks  Belgium had the outlook on its AA+ credit rating lowered to
negative from stable at  Fitch Ratings , which cited concern over
the pace of structural reform.  “People are worried that demand will weaken outside Japan
as the economy slows, so it’s difficult to buy stocks of
companies which rely on overseas demand, and that’s leading to
gains in domestic stocks today,” said  Yoshihiro Okumura , who
helps manage the equivalent of $365 million at Chiba-Gin Asset
Management Co. in　Tokyo.  Shipping lines had the second-biggest gain after utilities
on the Topix as the Baltic Dry Index, a measure of shipping
costs for commodities, rose for a third day yesterday.  Nippon Yusen jumped 3.4 percent to 301 yen and Mitsui O.S.K.
Lines Ltd., the second-largest shipper, increased 0.7 percent to
427 yen.  Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha Ltd. (9107) , the No. 3, advanced 1.2
percent to 265 yen.  Sony Boost  SMBC Nikko Securities analyst Osuke Itazaki maintained his
bullish stance on Japan’s shipping line sector, saying the
share-price levels are low and that car transport and dry-bulk
businesses should start improving.  Toshiba, Japan’s biggest maker of nuclear reactors, rallied
2.1 percent to 432 yen. The company said it plans capital
spending of 1.45 trillion yen in the next three years on
computer chips, hard disks and smart grids.  Sony Corp. (6758)  climbed 2.7 percent to 2,270 yen after Nomura
Holdings Inc. and Credit Suisse Group AG said profit at Japan’s
No. 1 exporter of consumer electronics will likely beat what the
company has forecast for this year.  Sony said operating income in the 12 months to March 2012
will be similar to the 200 billion yen ($2.5 billion) last
fiscal year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
