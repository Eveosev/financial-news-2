Egypt ’s central bank accepted 6
billion Egyptian pounds ($1 billion) in seven-day  repurchase
agreements , or repos, at an auction today, according to data it
published on Bloomberg.  The central bank said it received 6.1 billion pounds in
bids for the agreements, which it offers weekly at an interest
rate of 9.25 percent. Last week, it awarded 8.21 billion pounds
instead of the 10 billion pounds it sought.  The North African country’s central bank started the repo
facility in March to allow banks to sell  government securities 
back in order to access more liquidity.  The yield on Egypt’s 5.75 percent dollar bond due in April
2020 rose two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 5.94
percent at 3:41 p.m. in Cairo. The pound was little changed at
5.9514 per dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
