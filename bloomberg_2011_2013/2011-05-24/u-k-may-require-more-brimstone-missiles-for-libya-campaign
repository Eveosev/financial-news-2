Britain is to develop a Royal Navy
missile-defense system capable of intercepting and destroying
missiles travelling at supersonic speeds, the Ministry of
Defence said.  The system, known as Sea Ceptor, will be developed under a
483 million-pound ($759 million) contract with missile-maker
MBDA, which is jointly owned by European Aeronautic, Defence &
Space Co.,  BAE Systems Plc (BA/)  and  Finmeccanica SpA (FNC) , the defense
ministry said in a statement in London today. The contract will
sustain about 500 jobs, it said.  “The introduction of this cutting edge missile system will
not only ensure that the Royal Navy will be able to continue
protecting our interests wherever they be, but is also highly
significant in sustaining and developing the U.K.’s skill in
building complex weapons,” said  Peter Luff , the defense
procurement minister.  Sea Ceptor has been designed for initial use on the Type 23
frigate to replace the Sea Wolf air-defense system when it goes
out of service in 2016 and is planned to be used on the Type 26
Global Combat ship. It could be adapted for use by the Army and
the Royal Air Force in the future, the defense ministry said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
