Jordanian journalists held a one-hour
demonstration in the capital, Amman, today to protest attacks
against members of the press.  The demonstrators called on Prime Minister  Marouf Bakhit  to
start an independent inquiry to investigate physical assaults on
journalists during a May 15 rally.  The protest earlier this month marked the annual observance
of what Palestinians call the “nakba,” meaning catastrophe, a
reference to their displacement as a result of the 1948
establishment of the state of  Israel .  To contact the reporter on this story:
