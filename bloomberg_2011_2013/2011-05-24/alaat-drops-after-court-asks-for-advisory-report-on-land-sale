Talaat Moustafa Group (TMGH)  Holding,
 Egypt ’s biggest publicly traded real-estate developer, fell to
the lowest level in a week after a Cairo court delayed until
next month a ruling on a land sale case pending a panel report.  The shares dropped 1.4 percent to 4.2 Egyptian pounds at
the 2:30 p.m. close in Cairo, the lowest level since May 17.
That valued the company at 8.46 billion pounds ($1.4 billion).  The administrative court delayed its ruling until June 21
on the case against the government’s land sale to Talaat
Moustafa for its  Madinaty project  to allow an advisory panel of
judges to issue a recommendation first. Hamdy El Fakharany, who
filed the suit, wants the government to implement a prior ruling
annulling the deal and offer the land at a public auction.  “We don’t expect the advisory panel to rule in favor of
Talaat Moustafa,” said Hany Samy, a director of research at
Cairo-based investment bank CI Capital Holdings. “Today’s
share-price drop was minor compared with what we expect if the
panel recommends the cancelation of the sale, which will likely
influence the court’s final decision.”  Judge Hassan Abdel Aziz, who is presiding over the case, on
April 26 annulled the government’s sale of 966,000 square meters
of land to  Palm Hills Developments SAE (PHDC)  after a report by an
advisory judges panel recommended cancelling the transaction
because it wasn’t sold at a public auction.  To contact the reporter on this story:
