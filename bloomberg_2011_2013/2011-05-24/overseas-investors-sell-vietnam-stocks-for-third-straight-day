Overseas investors sold  Vietnamese
stocks  for the third day, the longest sequence of withdrawals
since December, as the fastest inflation in 29 months fueled
speculation interest rates will rise further.  Foreign investors have sold a net 107.9 billion dong ($5.2
million) of Vietnamese shares since May 20, according to data
from the  Ho Chi Minh City  Stock Exchange’s website yesterday.
The three days of selling were the longest series since Dec. 2
to Dec. 6, the data show.  The benchmark VN Index in Ho Chi Minh City sank 3.7 percent
to 402.59 yesterday, capping a nine-day, 17 percent plunge that
was the longest streak since February 2009.  Asia ’s worst-
performing benchmark index has tumbled 23 percent from its 2011
high on Feb. 9, exceeding the 20 percent drop that marks a  bear
market  for some investors.  “Inflation figures were higher than expected and people
are afraid that the consumer price index gains may accelerate to
more than 20 percent this year,” said Nguyen Duy Phong, a Ho
Chi Minh City-based analyst from ACB Securities Inc. “There are
also rumors that the central bank may raise the reserve ratio,
and that will hurt money inflows into the market.”  The  State Bank  of  Vietnam  on May 17 boosted the repurchase
rate for the sixth time this year to curb inflation. Prices rose
19.78 percent in May from a year earlier, compared with 17.51
percent in April, according to data released by the General
Statistics Office in Hanoi yesterday. That’s the quickest pace
since December 2008.  Economic Growth  The economy grew 5.43 percent in the three months through
March from a year earlier, slowing from a 7.34 percent pace in
the previous quarter. Lending rates as high as 28 percent are
hampering business, according to VinaCapital Investment
Management Ltd., Vietnam’s largest fund manager.  “Rising inflation expectations will keep the pressure on
the central bank to tighten further,”  Prakriti Sofat , a
Singapore-based economist at  Barclays Capital , wrote in a note
yesterday, predicting that the refinancing rate will rise by a
further 100 basis points to 15 percent in “coming weeks.”  Inflation will probably reach 22 percent to 23 percent by
mid-year before easing “as policy tightening weighs on credit
growth,” Sofat wrote.  --Nguyen Kieu Giang. Editors: Darren Boey, Richard Frost  To contact Bloomberg News staff on this story:
