Eveready East Africa Ltd. (EVRD) , the
biggest dry-cell battery maker in the region, fell the most this
year in Nairobi trading after  Business Daily  reported that the
manufacturer plans to close its Kenyan plant.  Eveready East Africa slumped 6.5 percent to 2.15 shillings,
the biggest drop since Dec. 30, as of the 3 p.m. close of
trading in the Kenyan capital. The stock has fallen 28 percent
this year.  The company may contract out manufacturing to nations with
lower operating costs, which may result in 170 employees losing
their jobs, the Nairobi-based newspaper cited designated
Managing Director Jackson Mutua yesterday as saying. Mutua, who
was appointed on May 20 to succeed Managing Director  Steve Smith 
at the end of this month, declined to comment immediately when
contacted by Bloomberg News.  “I don’t see any rally until there is a massive
restructuring of the company, because they are not able to
compete with the Chinese imports,”  Aly-Khan Satchu , an
independent analyst, said in a phone interview from Nairobi.  Net income in the year through September dropped 70 percent
to 8.7 million shillings ($100,900), the company said on March
30, citing “unfair” competition and an increase in zinc
prices.  To contact the reporter on this story:
