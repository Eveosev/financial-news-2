Hungarian March retail sales
unexpectedly declined for the first time in three months, led by
food items, underscoring the fragility of domestic demand
revival following years of austerity.  Sales dropped an annual 0.9 percent after rising a revised
0.1 percent in February, the  statistics office  in Budapest said
today in an e-mailed statement. The median estimate of seven
economists in a Bloomberg survey was for 0.2 percent growth.  Retail sales dropped for 41 consecutive months through June
2010 as five years of austerity budgets took their toll on
domestic demand. Rising exports helped  Hungary â€™s economy grow
2.4 percent in the first quarter, the fastest annual pace in
four years. The government targets growth of 3.2 percent this
year and as much as 5.2 percent by 2014.  Retail sales of food items fell 1.6 percent from a year
earlier, the statistics office said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
