Purchases of new houses rose in April
for a second month as the market struggled to recover from a
record low.  Sales climbed 7.3 percent to a 323,000 annual pace last
month, figures from the Commerce Department showed today in
 Washington . The median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey of
economists called for sales at a 300,000 annual rate. New houses
sold at a 278,000 rate in February, matching the pace in August
as the lowest in data going back to 1963.  Job gains and increased affordability may be starting to
help underpin a housing market that’s lagged behind the rest of
the economy. Nonetheless, the prospect that foreclosures will
keep driving down property values means that buyers may continue
to favor previously owned dwellings, indicating it will take
years for builders like D.R. Horton Inc. to see a full recovery.  “We’re looking at a modest upward trend, with some bouncing
around at this level,” said Bricklin Dwyer, an economist at BNP
Paribas in  New York . “Housing will bounce around near these
levels in terms of new and existing sales, with a bit of further
declines in prices. We should see a pickup later in the year.”  Another report today showed manufacturing, which led the
economy out of the recession, may be cooling. The Federal Reserve
Bank of Richmond’s factory index dropped to minus 6 this month,
the lowest reading since April 2009. Negative numbers indicate
manufacturing was shrinking.  Shares Climb  Stocks held earlier gains after the reports. The Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index rose 0.4 percent to 1,323.11 at 10:27 a.m. in
New York. The S&P Supercomposite Homebuilding Index climbed 0.9
percent.  Estimate in the Bloomberg survey of 75 economists ranged
from 280,000 to 320,000. Sales in March were revised to a 301,000
annual rate from a 300,000 previously reported.  The median sales price increased 4.6 percent from the same
month last year, to $217,900, today’s report showed.  The gain may reflect a change in the mix of sales to higher-
priced homes in the West, where demand jumped 15 percent. The
other three regions also saw purchases increase.  The supply of homes at the current sales rate dropped to 6.5
month’s worth in April, the lowest in a year, from 7.2 months in
March. There were 175,000 new houses on the market at the end of
April, the fewest since records began in 1963.  Executives Dour  Building executives are still concerned about the outlook.
Demand for new houses will remain weak into next year, said Bill Wheat, chief financial officer of  Fort Worth , Texas-based D.R.
Horton Inc., the second-largest U.S. home builder by revenue.
“We feel it could still be a struggle in 2012.”  Builders are cutting back as a result. Housing starts fell
11 percent in April to a 523,000 annual pace, the second-weakest
reading since April 2009’s record low, figures from the Commerce
Department showed last week.  One reason for the slump is growing interest from investors
in buying distressed properties. Previously owned homes sold at a
5.05 million annual rate in April, down 0.8 percent from the
prior month, data from the National Association of Realtors
showed May 19. All-cash deals accounted for 31 percent of
transactions, and distressed properties, including foreclosures
and short sales, made up 37 percent, the group said.  As distressed transactions have played a bigger role, new-
home sales have shrunk as a share of total sales. They accounted
for just under 6 percent of the market in March, down from 16
percent at their peak in July 2005.  More Foreclosures  The supply of existing houses will probably remain an issue.
CoreLogic Inc. in March estimated about 1.8 million homes were
more than 90 days delinquent, in foreclosure or bank-owned, a so-
called “shadow inventory” set to add to the unsold supply of
3.87 million previously owned homes already on the market.  Foreclosures have weighed on  home prices . The S&P/Case-
Shiller index of property values in 20 cities fell 3.3 percent in
February from a year earlier, the biggest 12-month decrease since
November 2009, the group said last month. The gauge is down 33
percent from its July 2006 peak.  In addition to the drop in values, persistent joblessness
may be making some potential buyers hesitate. The 9 percent
unemployment rate last month, almost two years into an economic
recovery, compares with an average of 4.8 percent in the three
years before the recession began.  Douglas Yearley Jr., chief executive officer at  Toll
Brothers Inc. (TOL) , the largest U.S. luxury-home builder, last week
said the spring home-selling season has been “disappointing”
and that “people are still scared.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
