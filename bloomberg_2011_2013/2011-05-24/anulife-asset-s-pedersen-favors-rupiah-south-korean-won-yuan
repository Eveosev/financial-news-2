Endre Pedersen, the Hong Kong-based
managing director of fixed income at Manulife Asset Management,
who helps oversee $28 billion of Asian bonds, comments on Asian
currencies in a media briefing.  The unit of  Canada ’s largest insurer launched a new Asian
bond fund in  Singapore  today, called the Manulife Asia Total
Return Fund, which aims to generate returns from a mixture of
Asian currencies,  interest rates  and corporate debt.  “We see the main opportunities for the rest of this year
being in the Indonesian rupiah, South  Korean won  and renminbi-
denominated assets.  “Indonesian sovereign bonds are delivering strong yields
and we believe there is potential for the country to be upgraded
to investment-grade status, which could further increase the
country’s attractiveness to fixed-income investors. Foreign
reserves reaching north of $100 billion is basically unheard of
for a BB+ rated country.  “There is room for the Korean won to appreciate as it is
currently undervalued compared to the currencies of export
competitors such as Japan and Taiwan.  “As the Chinese renminbi appreciates, we expect  South
Korea  to feel more comfortable to let its currency follow suit
without impacting the competitiveness of its exports.  “We expect the won to trade below 1,000. Give it nine
months, that’s where we expect it to be. For the renminbi, what
we said at the beginning of the year still stands true. We
expect the renminbi to move north of 5 percent” in terms of
appreciation, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
