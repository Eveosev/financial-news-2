Oil options volatility decreased as
the underlying futures rose after the dollar declined and
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Morgan Stanley increased their oil-
price outlooks.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
July, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge
of options prices, was 33.9 percent as of 3 p.m. in  New York ,
down from 35.8 percent yesterday. Futures prices have switched
direction each day for the past five sessions.  Crude for July delivery gained $1.89, or 1.9 percent, to
$99.59 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , the highest
settlement since May 18. Prices have climbed 42 percent in the
past year.  The most active contracts in electronic trading today were
July $90 puts, with 2,036 lots changing hands. They lost 47
cents to 66 cents a barrel. July $95 puts, the next-most active
option, dropped 85 cents to $1.58 a barrel with 1,910 lots
trading. One contract covers 1,000 barrels of crude.  Nymex distributes real-time data for electronic trading and

trading occurs, the next business day.  July $90 puts were the most active options traded
