AboveNet Inc. (ABVT) , a provider of fiber-
optic lines for businesses, surged the most in more than two
years after a report that the company is exploring a possible
sale.  AboveNet, based in White Plains, New York, rose $5.90, or
9.3 percent, to $69.31 at 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange
composite trading, its biggest one-day gain since May 5, 2009.
The company has retained  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  to find a buyer,
DealReporter said.  Telecommunications companies including  AT&T Inc. (T) ,  Verizon
Communications Inc. (VZ)  and  CenturyLink Inc. (CTL)  could be potential
acquirers, according to Mark Kelleher, an analyst at Dougherty &
Co. in Boston.  “They all have large metro fiber assets, but AboveNet
would be a great augmentation,” Kelleher said in an e-mail.  Possible buyers may also include broadband provider  Level 3
Communications Inc. (LVLT)  and TW Telecom Inc., a provider of telephone
and Internet service to businesses, according to an unnamed
banker cited by DealReporter.  Level 3 agreed to buy  Global Crossing Ltd. (GLBC)  in an all-stock
deal valued at $1.9 billion at the time of its announcement on
April 11. That’s a combination AboveNet Chief Executive Officer
William LaPerch said “makes great sense” during a conference
call on May 5.  Jeff Garte, director of corporate development for AboveNet,
could not immediately be reached today for comment.  Private equity firms with telecommunications and fiber
holdings may also be interested, including Abry Partners LLC,
Oak Hill Capital Partners LP and Madison Dearborn Partners LLC,
DealReporter said. LaPerch said on the conference call that
AboveNet’s 2011 priorities included building out and enhancing
their network.  AboveNet shares have increased 19 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
