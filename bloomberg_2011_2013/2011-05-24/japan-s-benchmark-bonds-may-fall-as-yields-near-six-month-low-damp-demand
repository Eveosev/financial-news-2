Japan ’s 10-year bond yields were less
than two basis points from a six-month low before a report
forecast to show U.S. durable goods orders fell in April, adding
to signs the global economic recovery may be losing momentum.  Bond futures rose toward a 10-week high as stocks dropped
and a report showed Japan switched to a trade deficit in April,
boosting demand for safer assets. The Ministry of Finance will
sell 1.1 trillion yen ($13.4 billion) of 20-year bonds tomorrow.  “It remains to be seen whether the  U.S. economy  will
maintain the status quo or deteriorate and need further
measures,” said Shinji Hiramatsu, senior investment manager in
Tokyo at Sompo Japan Nipponkoa Asset Management Co. Ltd., which
oversees about $49 billion. “Investors don’t have a reason to
sell bonds, but they can’t keep buying due to low yields.”  The yield on the 1.1 percent bond due March 2021 was
unchanged at 1.12 percent at 3:09 p.m. in  Tokyo  at Japan Bond
Trading Co., the nation’s largest interdealer debt broker. The
price was 99.823 yen.  The yield touched 1.105 percent on May 16, the lowest since
Nov. 24. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  Ten-year bond futures for June delivery gained 0.07 to
140.89 as of the close at the Tokyo Stock Exchange. The
contracts reached 140.97 on May 16, the highest since March 15.  Durable Goods  Orders for U.S. durable goods dropped 2.5 percent in April,
reflecting less demand for aircraft and disruptions in supplies
of auto parts stemming from the earthquake in Japan, economists
said before a report today.  Japan’s trade deficit was 463.7 billion yen in April from a
revised surplus of 189.4 billion yen in March, the  Finance
Ministry  said in Tokyo today. The median estimate of economists
in a Bloomberg News survey was 703.7 billion yen.  The  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average fell 0.6 percent.  Bonds fell earlier on speculation yields near the lowest
level since November damped investor demand.  “Yield levels are making people hesitant to buy,” said
Shinichi Horikawa, who helps to manage the equivalent of $12.2
billion at Mitsui Sumitomo Kirameki Life Insurance Co. “There
should be enough demand for tomorrow’s auction as long as yields
are above 1.9 percent.”  Twenty-year yields fell 1.5 basis points to 1.91 percent.
The prior 20-year sale on April 21 drew bids worth 2.92 times
the amount on offer, compared with a ratio of 4.13 at the March
sale.  To contact the reporter on this story:
