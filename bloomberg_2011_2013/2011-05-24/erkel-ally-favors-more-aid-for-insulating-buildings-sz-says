German Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s
Free Democratic Party coalition partner wants to boost subsidies
for improving the heating efficiency of buildings after the aid
was cut last year, the  Sueddeutsche Zeitung  reported.  The FDP wants to increase annual subsidies by as much as 2
billion euros ($2.8 billion) per year after the aid was reduced
to 500 million euros this year, the newspaper said, citing FDP
parliamentary deputy leader Michael Kauch.  Merkel’s coalition has said it is exploring ways to speed
up the development of renewable energy and improve the energy
efficiency of buildings amid plans to phase out nuclear power.  To contact the reporter on this story:
