Greece  could raise between 250
billion euros ($353 billion) and 300 billion euros in the sale
of its state-owned assets, more than the 50 billion euros it has
pledged to raise, the Financial Times reported, citing
unidentified officials involved in the discussions. The country
may be forced to allow an international agency to manage the
divestments as part of new conditions imposed by European
leaders, the Financial Times also reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
