Vietnam ’s three-year bonds declined,
pushing yields to the highest level since November 2008, after
inflation accelerated to a 29-month high in May. The dong gained.  Prices rose 19.78 percent from a year earlier, compared
with 17.51 percent in April, according to data released by the
General Statistics Office in Hanoi today. That’s the quickest
pace since December 2008.  “Given quickening inflation, banks will demand higher bond
yields, especially in the primary market,” said Pham Minh Hoang,
a fixed-income dealer at Ocean Commercial Joint-Stock Bank in
Hanoi.  The yield on the three-year bonds rose eight basis points,
or 0.08 percentage point, to 12.74 percent, according to a daily
fixing from banks compiled by Bloomberg. The dong strengthened
0.4 percent to 20,630 per dollar as of 3:35 p.m. in Hanoi,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The central bank fixed the reference rate at 20,668 today,
compared with 20,673 yesterday, according to its website. The
currency is allowed to trade up to 1 percent on either side of
that rate.  --Diep Ngoc Pham in Hanoi. Editors: Andrew Janes, Simon Harvey  To contact the Bloomberg News staff on this story:
