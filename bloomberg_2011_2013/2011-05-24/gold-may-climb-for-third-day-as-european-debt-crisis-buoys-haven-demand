Gold futures rose to a three-week
high as concern mounted that  Europe ’s sovereign-debt crisis will
escalate, and the dollar drop’s spurred demand for the metal as
an alternative asset. Silver jumped 3.5 percent.  The greenback fell for the first time in three sessions
against a basket of major currencies. The Greek government
endorsed an accelerated asset-sale plan and 6 billion euros
($8.4 billion) of budget cuts to win extra aid. Gold priced in
euros climbed to a record for the second straight day.  “People see the whipsaw in the  currency market , and they
want to buy gold and call it a day,” said  Adam Klopfenstein , a
senior market strategist at Lind-Waldock in Chicago.  Gold futures for June delivery gained $7.90, or 0.5
percent, to settle at $1,523.30 an ounce at 1:41 p.m. on the
Comex in  New York , the highest closing price for a most-active
contract since May 3.  The metal has gained 28 percent in the past year, climbing
to a record $1,557.40 on May 2. Gold in euros reached an all-
time high of 1,082.69 today.  “People view gold as a store of value and an alternative
to the dollar,” said  Jeff Sherman , who helps manage $11 billion
at DoubleLine Capital LP in New York. “We are still long on
gold.”  ‘Bullish’ Goldman  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) , after recommending selling
commodities last month, said it is turning “more bullish” on
raw materials.  “There’s a move in commodities across the board,” said
Klopfenstein at Lind-Waldock. “Gold and silver are getting
well-bid.”  Silver futures for July delivery rose $1.224 to $36.128 an
ounce. The price has tumbled 28 percent from a 31-year high of
$49.845 on April 25.  Silver has been “very volatile,” Sherman of DoubleLine
said. He said that he bet on a price decline in the high $30s.  “People have not stepped back,” Sherman said. “We think
that the low $30s is probably the fair value.”  Palladium futures for June delivery rose $3.45, or 0.5
percent, to $735.25 an ounce on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange .  Platinum futures for July delivery climbed $6.60, or 0.4
percent, to $1,762.50 an ounce.  To contact the reporters on this story:
