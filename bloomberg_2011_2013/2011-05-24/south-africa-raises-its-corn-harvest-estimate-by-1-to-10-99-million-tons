South Africa , the biggest corn
producer on the continent, increased its forecast for this
season’s total corn harvest by 1 percent, the government’s Crop
Estimates Committee said.  South African farmers will probably reap 10.99 million
metric tons of the grain this season, up from an earlier
forecast of 10.88 million tons, spokeswoman Marda Scheepers said
by phone from  Pretoria  today. The white corn forecast was raised
1.8 percent to 6.37 million tons and the yellow corn estimate
was left unchanged at 4.62 million tons, she said.  The  Crop Estimates Committee  was expected to reduce its
forecast to 10.85 million tons of corn, according to the median
estimate of 13 traders surveyed by Bloomberg. Forecasts ranged
from 10.6 million tons to 10.9 million tons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
