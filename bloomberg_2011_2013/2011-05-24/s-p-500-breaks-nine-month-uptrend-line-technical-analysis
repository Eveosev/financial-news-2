The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell
below its “uptrend line” since August, suggesting the gauge of
U.S. equities is more likely to make new lows for the year
before reaching new highs, Dahlman Rose & Co. said.  The index fell 1.2 percent to 1,317.37 yesterday, breaking
below the trend line that’s established by connecting the lows
on August 26 and March 16, Bloomberg data show. That breakdown
put the  S&P 500  at risk of falling toward a cloud support on the
ichimoku chart for a third time this year, said Rick Bensignor,
chief market strategist at Dahlman Rose. The bottom of the cloud
support sat at 1,296.56 recently, which would represent a 1.6
percent decline.  “We believe that odds begin to increase -- far more than
generally expected -- for new 2011 lows to occur before new
highs,” Bensignor wrote in a note yesterday. “It could be the
kick-off of more selling to come.”  The S&P 500 has dropped 3.4 percent from an almost three-
year high on April 29 as economic data missed economists’
estimates and investors prepared for the  Federal Reserve  to
complete its $600 billion bond-purchase program, known as
quantitative easing or “QE,” at the end of June. The index has
rallied 26 percent since Aug. 26, the day before Fed Chairman
 Ben S. Bernanke  said he was prepared to take action to help the
economy.  The bottom of the cloud support served as a stem to the S&P
500’s decline on March 16, when the index reached its 2011 low,
and again on April 18.  “Further clarification should come on a qualified downside
breach of the bottom of the daily cloud,” Bensignor said. “We
raise the yellow caution flag, amidst a market that is still
predominated by an absence of true substantial long-only
selling.”  Technical analysts study charts of trading patterns and
prices to predict changes in a security, commodity, currency or
index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
