Turkey ’s banks will urge the
government to exempt energy project and export loans from a
proposed credit growth ceiling of 25 percent,  Vatan  newspaper
reported.  The government is seeking to slow a boom in lending that
has helped expand the current account deficit to record levels,
and has warned that banks may be penalized for breaching the
limit. The lenders argue that energy and export loans shouldn’t
count because they help to reduce the current account gap, and
will present their case to Deputy Prime Minister  Ali Babacan  in
Ankara on May 31, Vatan said.  The central bank is also looking into the banks’ request,
Vatan said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
