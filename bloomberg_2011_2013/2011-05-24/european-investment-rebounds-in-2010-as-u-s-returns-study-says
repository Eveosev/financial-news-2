European foreign-direct investment
rebounded in 2010 as U.S. investors returned to the region,
according to an Ernst & Young LLP study.  Investment in  Europe  rose 14 percent to a record 3,757
projects as companies such as  General Electric Co. (GE) ,  FedEx Corp. (FDX) 
and  Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ)  added jobs in the region, the New York-
based accountancy company said in an e-mailed report today.
Investment fell 11 percent in 2009. The number of projects
backed by U.S. investors surged 24 percent last year.  “Following a significant decline in investment during the
worst of the global recession, investors are now coming back in
force to Europe,” said Mark Otty, Ernst & Young’s area managing
partner for Europe, Middle East, India and Africa. “The
challenge for Europe will be to maintain this momentum.”  The gain in investment in western Europe was led by Ireland
and Germany with a 36 percent and a 34 percent increase in the
number of projects respectively, the report found. Russia,
Poland and  Hungary  also posted gains, reflecting “the strong
economic recovery” in central and eastern Europe, Ernst & Young
said. Portugal, Greece and Spain all recorded declines.  The data covers investment projects by overseas companies
in manufacturing or services operations that resulted in new
facilities, or the creation of jobs, Ernst & Young said. It
excluded portfolio investments, mergers and acquisitions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
