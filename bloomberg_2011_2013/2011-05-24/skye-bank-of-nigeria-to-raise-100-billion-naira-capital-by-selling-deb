Skye Bank Plc (SKYEBANK) , a Nigerian lender,
plans to raise 100 billion naira ($636.9 million) through a debt
sale to fund business expansion, Chief Executive Officer Kehinde
Durosinmi-Etti said.  “It is long-term debt capital which we have to raise this
year,” he said in an interview today in Lagos, the commercial
capital. “We intend to open offices in Ghana and also raise the
volume of our business in areas such as oil and gas.”  Skye’s expansion into Ghana “is to increase our presence
in West Africa, after operating successfully in  Nigeria ,  Sierra
Leone , Gambia and Guinea. The debt option, rather than equity,
is the better thing to do at present,” he said.  “We are divesting non-core areas to concentrate on
commercial banking and grow our international business,” he
said.  Skye Bank lost 1.2 percent to 8.4 naira by the 2:30 p.m.
close in Lagos, bringing the stock’s decline this year to 4.6
percent, compared with a 3.9 percent gain in the  Nigerian Stock
Exchange  All Share Index over the same period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
