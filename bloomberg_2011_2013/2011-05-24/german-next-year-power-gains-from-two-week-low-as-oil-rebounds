German electricity for next year rose
from its lowest in two weeks as  oil prices  rebounded, signaling
higher costs at power stations in Europe’s biggest market.  Baseload power for 2012 gained as much as 30 cents, or 0.5
percent, to 58.50 euros ($82.42) as of 10:04 a.m. Berlin time,
according to broker data compiled by Bloomberg. The contract
earlier fell to 58.05 euros, the lowest since May 6. Baseload is
delivered around the clock.  The region’s benchmark contract closed as high as 60.55
euros on April 4, its strongest level since June 2009, as
Germany shut reactors for a safety review following the nuclear
disaster in Japan.  Brent crude  for July settlement rose for a second day in
three as speculation that Libyan supply cuts will reduce OPEC’s
spare production capacity countered concern Europe’s debt crisis
is spreading.  The contract advanced 1.2 percent to $111.43 a barrel on
 London ’s ICE Futures Europe exchange. Crude affects the cost of
natural gas and coal, used at power stations to generate
electricity.  Bloomberg tracks power prices from brokers including  GFI
Group Inc. (GFIG) , ICAP Plc, Spectron Group Ltd., Tradition Financial
Services and Tullet Prebon Plc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
