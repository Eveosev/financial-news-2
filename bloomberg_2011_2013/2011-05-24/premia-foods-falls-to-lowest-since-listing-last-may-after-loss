AS Premia Foods, the biggest Baltic
frozen-food producer, fell to the lowest level since listing
last May after it reported a wider first-quarter loss.  The stock fell as much as 6.8 percent in Tallinn and was
5.5 percent down, at 0.77 euros, at 12:54 p.m. The stock has
shed 18 percent this year, compared with a 6.7 percent decline
for the Nasdaq OMX Tallinn index and a 7.2 percent gain for
eastern European consumer goods businesses as a whole, according
to Bloomberg data.  Premia said after the end of trading yesterday that its net
loss for the three months to March 31 was 1.98 million euros
($3.2 million) against 1.1 million euros a year earlier. It
cited plant relocation costs in  Russia  and dwindling fish
stocks.  Last May, shortly after listing in Tallinn, Premia acquired
Russiaâ€™s OOO Khladokombinat No. 1, the second-largest ice-cream
producer in  St. Petersburg . The company earned 34 percent of
revenue from ice-cream last year, Russia being its biggest
market. Fish products, mostly sold in  Finland , accounted for
38.5 percent of revenue.  To contact the reporter on this story:
