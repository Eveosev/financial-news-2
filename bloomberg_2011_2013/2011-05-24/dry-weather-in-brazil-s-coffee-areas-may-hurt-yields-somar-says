Dry weather in coffee-producing
regions in  Brazil , the world’s largest grower, may hurt yields
of beans in the initial phase of maturation, according to
Brazilian weather forecaster Somar Meteorologia.  “A lack of rains in the coffee regions of  Sao Paulo , Minas
Gerais and Parana has already started to cause concerns for
coffee farmers,” Marco Antonio dos Santos, an agronomist at the
company, said in an e-mailed report yesterday.  Beans that are in the early stages of maturation may have
reduced yields as the lack of water will make them lighter, dos
Santos said in the report.  There will be no rain during the next 10 days in the
coffee-producing regions of the southeast, which includes the
states of Sao Paulo and  Minas Gerais , the country’s largest
arabica-producing state, the forecaster said.  Milder temperatures are resulting in slower maturation and
fermentation processes, which may lead to better quality beans,
Somar said. Temperatures will vary between 6-10 degrees Celsius
(43-50 degrees Fahrenheit) in the southern part of Minas Gerais
and in Sao Paulo.  There are no signs of frost, at least in the next 10 days,
the forecaster said.  Arabica coffee for July delivery was up 2.65 cent, or 1
percent, at $2.6520 a pound by 7:45 a.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in
 New York . Robusta coffee for July delivery advanced $15, or 0.6
percent, to $2,554 a metric ton in London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
