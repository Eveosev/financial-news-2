Repsol YPF SA (REP) ,  Spain ’s biggest oil
company, shut an alkylation unit yesterday at its Petronor
refinery in Bilbao, Spain, for maintenance.  Work, which was expected to take place last month, was
delayed, the Madrid-based company said today in an e-mailed
response to questions. Repairs aren’t expected to take more than
two weeks, it said. Alkylation plants make blending components
for gasoline.  The refinery said on April 8 it was proceeding to halt the
AK3 unit to carry out maintenance. A statement on its  website  on
April 27 said the unit would be restarted that day. Petronor has
the capacity to process 220,000 barrels of crude a day,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporters on this story:
