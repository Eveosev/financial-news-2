A Gambian court sentenced the West
African country’s former chief of defense staff and ex-head of
naval staff to prison terms after convicting them of treason for
their involvement in an abortive coup in 2006.  Lieutenant-General Lang Tombong Tamba was sentenced to 60
years in jail, while Rear-Admiral Sarjo Fafana was imprisoned
for 50 years, Justice Joseph Enwa Ikpala of the Special Criminal
Court ruled yesterday in the capital, Banjul.  Tamba has already been sentenced to death by Gambia’s  High
Court  for seeking to end President Yahya Jammeh’s 17-year rule
in a coup attempt in 2009.  Jammeh, 45, seized power in a military coup in 1994. The
country is scheduled to hold presidential elections on Nov. 24.  To contact the reporter on this story:
