Poland’s WIG20 Index gained 7.31, or
0.3 percent, to 2,824.01 at the 5:30 p.m. close in Warsaw.  The following are among the most active stocks on the
 Warsaw Stock Exchange  today. Stock symbols follow company names.  Globe Trade Centre SA (GTC)  , Poland’s biggest property
developer by market value, jumped 0.62 zloty, or 3.5 percent, to
18.2 zloty, rising for the first time in three days. Its 14-day
relative strength index, which shows how rapidly prices advanced
or dropped in a given period, was at 28.7 yesterday. A reading
of 30 or below signals to some investors that shares are set to
rise.  KGHM Polska Miedz SA (KGH)  , the copper producer with the
biggest European mine output, climbed 2.4 zloty, or 1.3 percent,
to 182.1 zloty, the highest close since May 11. Copper rose in
 London , rebounding from the biggest retreat in almost three
weeks, as Goldman Sachs Group Inc. advised investors to buy the
metal.  PKN Orlen SA (PKN PW),  Poland ’s biggest oil company, rose
0.2 zloty, or 0.4 percent, to 51.3 zloty. Oil gained on signs of
shrinking crude inventories and as a drop in the dollar
heightened oil’s appeal for protecting against inflation.  Separately, Goldman Sachs lifted its price estimate for
Orlen 7.5 percent to 57 zloty.  To contact the reporter on this story:
