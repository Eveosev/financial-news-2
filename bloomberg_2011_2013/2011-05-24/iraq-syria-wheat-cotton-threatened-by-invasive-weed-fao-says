Wheat and cotton in  Iraq  and  Syria 
are at risk from an invasive weed called silverleaf nightshade
that saps water and nutrients needed by the crops, the United
Nations Food and Agriculture Organization said in a  report .  The weed, which probably arrived in the countries through
global trade, has deep roots and is covered in thorns, making it
difficult to pull from the ground, the FAO said today. Olive
groves in Syria are also at risk, according to the report. In
northwestern Iraq and parts of Lebanon and Jordan, infestations
of the weed have been reported, the FAO said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
