Chrysler Group LLC, the U.S.
automaker operated by  Fiat SpA (F) , has repaid the U.S. Treasury
$5.1 billion in debt ahead of schedule.  The payment “marks a significant milestone for the
turnaround of Chrysler and the countless communities and
families who rely on the American  auto industry ,” President
Barack Obama said in a statement sent by e-mail today. “This
announcement comes six years ahead of schedule and just two
years after emerging from bankruptcy, allowing Chrysler to build
on its progress and continue to grow as the economy recovers.”  Chrysler has returned more than $10.6 billion of its $12.5
billion from the Troubled Asset Relief Program, the  Treasury
Department  said in a separate statement today in Washington. The
Treasury still holds a 6.6 percent common equity stake in
Chrysler and is unlikely to fully recover the remaining $1.9
billion investment in the company, according to the statement.  “Chrysler’s early repayment of its outstanding TARP loans
is an important step in the turnaround of this company and the
resurgence of the auto industry,” Treasury Secretary  Timothy F. Geithner  said in the department’s statement.  “Chrysler will again regain its independence,” Chrysler
Chief Executive Officer  Sergio Marchionne , who is also the CEO
of Fiat, said yesterday at the opening of a Fiat dealership in
Macomb, Michigan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
