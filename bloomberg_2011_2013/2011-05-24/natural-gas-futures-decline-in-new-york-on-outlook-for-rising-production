Natural gas futures fell, heading for
their first monthly decline since February, on speculation that
demand from  power plants  won’t be strong enough to surpass
rising supplies of the fuel.  Gas dropped for the first time in three days as the Energy
Department forecasts record gas production in 2011. Output may
rise 2.3 percent to 63.2 billion cubic feet a day this year, the
department’s May 10 Short-Term Energy Outlook showed. Prices had
risen as a drop in the number of active drilling rigs spurred
speculation that production would decline.  “We’ve had a move down in gas rigs, but generally speaking
we’re well above the 800 to 825 number where you’d actually see
an impact to natural gas production,” said Carl Neill, an
energy consultant at Risk Management Inc. in Atlanta. “The
expectation is that we’ll have plenty of gas in storage at the
end of the summer.  Natural gas for June delivery fell 0.1 cent to settle at
$4.345 per million British thermal units on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange . The futures have declined 7.5 percent this
month.  “Near-term demand growth aside, robust gas supply should
remain a headwind for gas prices,” analysts including  Cameron Horwitz  at Canaccord Genuity in Houston said in a note to
clients today.  Gas rigs fell by 8 to 866 last week, the lowest level since
the week ended Jan. 29, 2010, according to data from Houston-
based Baker Hughes Inc.  Stockpile Report  The Energy Department may report May 26 that 93 billion
cubic feet of gas were added to inventories in the week ended
May 20, according to the median of six analyst estimates
compiled by Bloomberg. The five-year average injection is 95
billion cubic feet.  Last year, stockpiles grew by 100 billion cubic feet for
the week, department data show. Inventories totaled 1.919
trillion in the week ended May 13, 1.8 percent below the five-
year average and 11 percent below year-earlier levels.  Inventories may rise near 3.9 trillion cubic feet at the
end of October because of higher production and a mild summer
relative to last year, the department said. Stockpiles totaled a
record 3.84 trillion in November 2010, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Gas Capacity  Demonstrated peak working gas capacity was 4.049 trillion
as of April 2010, according to the department. The measure is
the sum of the highest inventory level in each storage facility
over the previous five years, excluding supplies needed to
maintain adequate pressure.  Last week, the  National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration  predicted that 12 to 18 named storms, with winds
of 39 miles per hour (63 kilometers per hour) or higher, would
form during the six-month Atlantic season. Of those storms, six
to 10 may become hurricanes with winds of at least 74 mph.  The average  Atlantic hurricane season  produces 11 named
storms, according to the hurricane center.  Gas futures volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was
232,293 as of 2:44 p.m., compared with the three-month average
of 308,000. Volume was 302,925 yesterday. Open interest was

944,000.  The exchange has a one-business-day delay in reporting open
interest and full volume data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
