The U.K.’s  Independent Commission on
Banking , chaired by  John Vickers , may oblige banks to hold a
minimum amount of bond-funded capital as well as equity in its
final report due in September, the FT reported, citing people
familiar with the commission’s thinking.  The amount banks will be required to hold may be 4 percent
or 5 percent, the FT said, citing people close to the
commission. This requirement would be in addition to the minimum
equity capital requirement equivalent to 10 percent of the risk-
weighted assets, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
