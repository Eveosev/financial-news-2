OAO Surgutneftegas rose the most in
almost a week after  Hungary  paid 1.88 billion euros ($2.66
billion) for the Russian oil producerâ€™s 21.2 percent stake in
Mol Nyrt.  The shares advanced 1.3 percent to 26.58 rubles as of the
6:45 p.m. close in Moscow, the biggest jump since May 18.  The funds to buy the stake in Mol Nyrt, a Hungarian
refiner, will come from  International Monetary Fund  loans the
country has obtained, Development Minister Tamas Fellegi said in
Budapest today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
