Indonesia ’s rupiah rose, rebounding
from a one-week low, on speculation the central bank is
tolerating gains to manage rising prices.  The currency has strengthened 4.7 percent this year and
 Bank Indonesia  said May 12 that exchange-rate movements are
helping policy makers suppress inflation without derailing
economic growth. Consumer-price gains moderated for a third
month in April, having exceeded 7 percent in January for the
first time since April 2009.  “The rupiah is following the regional currencies after the
decline yesterday,” said Lindawati Susanto, head of treasury at
PT Bank Resona Perdania in Jakarta. “The central bank uses the
currency as a weapon to control inflation. Bank Indonesia is
comfortable with the level below 8,600 per dollar.”  The rupiah advanced 0.2 percent to 8,573 against the dollar
as of 8:32 a.m. in Jakarta, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The currency dropped 0.5 percent yesterday, touching
8,594, the weakest level since May 17.  Consumer prices in  Southeast Asia ’s largest economy rose
6.16 percent last month from a year earlier, compared with 6.65
percent in March. Southeast Asia’s largest economy grew 6.5
percent last quarter, after expanding 6.9 percent in the
previous three months. Gross domestic product may increase by 6
percent to 6.5 percent this year, the central bank said May 12.  To contact the reporter on this story:
