Dish TV India Ltd. (DITV)  is bound for the
highest close in more than five months on report the country’s
information ministry approved a proposal to lift the overseas
investment limit in direct-to-home television service providers
to 74 percent from 49 percent.  The stock rose 4 percent to 72.9 rupees at 11:14 a.m. in
Mumbai. A close at that price would be the highest since Dec. 6.
About 4.6 million shares changed hands, 78 percent more than the
three-month average daily, data on the Bloomberg show. The
shares are the best-performers on the BSE 200 Index today.  “It is a growing industry and companies need funds, now or
later, to finance expansions,” Beraam Gazdar, an analyst at
Mape Securities Pvt., said from Mumbai. “Most of the funds will
be used to finance costs incurred to get subscribers.”  Dish TV had more than 10 million customers as on March 31,
according to the company’s recent earnings report.  India ’s information and broadcasting ministry approved the
recommendation by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India to
increase the foreign direct investment limit for direct-to-home
and internet-television service providers, the Economic Times
reported today, citing a note from the ministry. The proposal
has been sent back to the telecom regulator, the paper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
