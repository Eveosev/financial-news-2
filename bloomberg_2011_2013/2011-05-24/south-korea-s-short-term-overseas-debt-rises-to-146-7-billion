South Korea ’s overseas short-term
debt rose the most in two-and-a-half years during the first
quarter as banks borrowed more to cover their positions in
currency derivatives and foreign-currency denominated bonds.  Overseas debt maturing in one year or less gained $11.7
billion to $146.7 billion as of the end of March from a quarter
earlier, the  Bank of Korea  said in a statement today. Long-term
external debt increased by $10.2 billion to $235.2 billion.  The  finance ministry  will “preemptively” act against any
external risks while closely monitoring changes in external debt
and capital flows, the ministry said in a separate statement
today.  The ministry said last week it will tighten the limits on
the amount of currency derivatives banks can hold by 20 percent
as it seeks to curb swings in capital flows and the won.  To contact the reporters on this story:
