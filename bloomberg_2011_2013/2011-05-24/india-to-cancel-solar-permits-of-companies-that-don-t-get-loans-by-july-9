India  will cancel licenses for solar
projects awarded to companies under its first auction if they
don’t obtain loans to build their plants by July 9, an official
said today.  “That’s it. They’ll be over,” Deepak Gupta, secretary at
the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy, said in an interview
in New Delhi today when asked what would happen to projects that
don’t meet the deadline.  Rather than fining companies for delays, their project
licenses will be revoked, he said.  India awarded permits to companies, including  Lanco
Infratech Ltd. (LANCI)  and  Reliance Power Ltd. (RPWR) , in December to build the
first 620 megawatts of solar plants in a national program that
calls for 20,000 megawatts by 2022.  Companies were given six months from the date of signing
power purchase agreements to line up financing for their
projects. Commercial banks have been reluctant to lend to the
new industry on concerns the technology may not perform as
expected and that projects may not get paid for the power they
generate by financially troubled state electricity distribution
companies.  India currently has  less than 18 megawatts  of grid-
connected solar power, according to the Ministry of New and
 Renewable Energy .  To contact the reporter on this story:
