Islamic Development Bank , the Jeddah-
based multilateral lender, will lend $140 million to Bangladesh
to build a bridge connecting the country’s southwest region with
the capital, Dhaka.  “It’s the biggest participation by IDB in a single project
in Bangladesh,” Ahmad Mohamed Ali, president of the lender,
said today in an interview.  The loan agreement follows one with the Japan International
Cooperation Agency last week to lend more than $400 million for
the construction of the 6.15 kilometer (3.8 mile) long bridge,
which will cut travel time between Dhaka and Khulna city to
three hours from 12 hours. The project, which will eliminate
dependence on ferry services for transport, is expected to boost
Bangladesh’s annual economic growth by half-a-percentage point,
the Japanese agency said.  The  World Bank  and  Asian Development Bank  are the other
lenders to the project, which will cost $2.91 billion to build,
according to the website of Bangladesh Bridge Authority.  To contact the reporter on this story:
