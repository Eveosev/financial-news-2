Notre Voie, a newspaper in  Ivory
Coast  that supports ex-President  Laurent Gbagbo , restarted
publication following a disputed presidential election that
installed his rival in power.  Cesar Etou, the editor of the Abidjan-based paper, halted
printing for 53 days over security concerns, he said by phone
yesterday.  “Our offices have been ransacked” and some Notre Voie
journalists are working while in hiding, Etou said. The paper is
the first of the press that supported Gbagbo during his decade-
long rule to restart printing. It also favored the leader during
the impasse that followed the November vote, which ended with
Gbagbo’s capture on April 11.  Alassane Ouattara  won the poll and
was installed as president on May 21.  “Journalists from all sides in the country’s four-month
civil war have been threatened, harassed and prevented from
doing their job,” Paris-based media advocacy group Reporters
Without Borders said in a  statement  April 19.  On March 1, eight newspapers that support Ouattara and one
independent paper suspended publication to protest harassment by
Gbagbo’s supporters. They resumed printing on March 7.  To contact the reporter on this story:
