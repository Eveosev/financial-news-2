Drake & Scull International (DSI)  PJSC, a
Dubai-based construction and engineering company, expects
revenue to increase as much as 30 percent this year.  “We are expecting 25 to 30 percent growth in revenue this
year,” Chief Executive Officer Khaldoun Tabari said at the
Arabian World Construction Summit in  Abu Dhabi  today.  Drake & Scull has expanded in the Middle East and North
Africa since 2008 after Dubai’s property crisis cut orders in
its home market. First-quarter profit rose 21 percent to 51
million dirhams ($13.9 million) and revenue surged 67 percent to
645 million dirhams, the company said earlier this month.  The company won a 10 million-euro ($14 million) contract to
build wind turbines in  India  and is bidding for electrical and
mechanical work at the Abu Dhabi airport, Tabari said. Drake &
Scull exited Syria about a month ago, he said, as security
forces cracked down on anti-government protesters.  To contact the reporters on this story:
