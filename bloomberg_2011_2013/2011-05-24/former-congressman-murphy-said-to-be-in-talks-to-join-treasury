Former Democratic Congressman Scott Murphy of  New York  is in talks to join the U.S. Treasury
Department, two people with knowledge of the matter said.  One option being considered would be to hire Murphy, 41, as
a counselor to Treasury Secretary  Timothy F. Geithner . Murphy
could also be nominated as assistant secretary for financial
institutions, a position left open by the departure of  Michael Barr , said the people, who declined to be identified because the
appointment isn’t final.  While he’s likely to have some role in domestic financial
policy, talks are continuing, and Murphy’s exact position may
change, the people said. Murphy, reached by telephone today,
declined to comment.  Treasury Department spokeswoman Colleen Murray declined to
comment on Murphy.  He served as a congressman for one term from 2009 to 2011.
As a member of the Agriculture Committee, he helped the Obama
administration write provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act that deal
with derivatives trading.  Murphy was also a member of the pro-business New Democrat
Coalition. He won a special election to fill the seat left open
by Kirsten Gillibrand when she was appointed to the Senate.
Murphy was defeated in his bid for re-election by Republican
Chris Gibson.  Murphy had previously worked at Advantage Capital Partners
and as president of the Board of Directors for Upstate Venture
Association of New York.  The assistant secretary for financial institutions oversees
Treasury policy on  Wall Street  and banking.  To contact the reporters on this story:
