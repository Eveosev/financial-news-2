Greek private money is being shifted
to other countries as a consequence of the economic crisis, with
about 280 billion euros ($394 billion) invested in  Switzerland 
alone,  Handelsblatt  reported, citing Dimitris Kouselas, a state
secretary at  Greece ’s finance ministry.  The amount deposited in Switzerland is equal to 120 percent
of Greece’s gross domestic product, the newspaper said. The two
biggest Swiss banks manage 20 billion euros in funds owned by
Greek private customers, Handelsblatt said, citing people in the
Swiss finance industry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
