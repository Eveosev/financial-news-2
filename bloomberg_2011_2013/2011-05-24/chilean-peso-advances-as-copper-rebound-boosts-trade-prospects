Chile ’s peso strengthened against the
 U.S. dollar  as a rebound in copper prices signaled an increased
trade surplus and gains in global equities bolstered investor
appetite for riskier, emerging market assets.  The peso gained 0.3 percent to 471.95 per U.S. dollar from
473.24 yesterday when it weakened 1.4 percent.  Copper, Chile’s main export, regained some of the ground
lost yesterday in London trading as Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
advised investors to buy the metal on economic growth prospects.
The euro gained against the dollar for the first time in three
days as German business confidence unexpectedly remained near a
record in May. The benchmark Stoxx Europe 600 Index rebounded
from a one-month low.  “The peso is trading in line with foreign markets, with
copper up on the comments from Goldman Sachs and with European
stocks slightly higher,” said Rodrigo Sarria, a trader at
Celfin Capital SA in Santiago.  Copper for delivery in three months rose 0.8 percent to
$8,861 a metric ton in  London  and gained as much as 1.8 percent.
The MSCI World Index of stocks climbed 0.2 percent.  Chile’s central bank paid an average of 471.39 per U.S.
dollar for $50 million today, as part of a $12 billion effort to
limit the peso’s gains, according to data published on the
bank’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
