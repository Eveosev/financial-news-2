Romania ’s wheat harvest may rise 23
percent this year, helped by favorable weather and higher
investment in fertilizers, Agriculture Minister Valeriu Tabara
said.  The eastern European country may harvest as much as 7
million metric tons of the grain, up from 5.7 million tons last
year, he said today in an interview in Bucharest. The government
wants to increase exports of all cereals so farmers can
capitalize on higher international prices, Tabara said.  “The prospects for the wheat harvest so far look extremely
good,” the minister said. “We hope the weather will continue
to be favorable. The total land sowed with wheat is about 2
million hectares (4.9 million acres), less than last year, but
the technology was better used, so the yields should be
higher.”  Wheat jumped 70 percent in the past year in Chicago trading
and corn, also grown in Romania, more than doubled.  To contact the reporter on this story:
