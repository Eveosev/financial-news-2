Coal will be an “unavoidable”
energy source for at least the next 30 years and cutting it off
would bring “economic and social chaos,” the Australian
Associated Press cited the country’s Climate Commissioner Roger
Beale as saying.  It’s best for countries such as  China  to buy their coal
from Australia, where it is mined efficiently, the newswire
cited Beale as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
