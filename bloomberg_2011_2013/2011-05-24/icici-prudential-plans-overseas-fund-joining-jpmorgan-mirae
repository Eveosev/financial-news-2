ICICI Prudential Asset Management
Co.,  India ’s third-largest  money manager , plans to sell a fund
that will allow locals to invest in assets overseas within the
next 12 months, Managing Director Nimesh Shah said today.  “We’re looking at completing our product bouquet,” Shah,
who is also the money manager’s chief executive officer, said in
an interview at his office in Mumbai today.  India’s central bank in 2004 allowed residents to invest up
to $200,000 overseas annually, or $1 million for a family of
five. That’s encouraged asset managers including JPMorgan Asset
Management India, Mirae Asset Global Investment (India) and DSP
Blackrock Investment Managers to sell products similar to the
one being planned by ICICI Prudential.  ICICI Prudential Asset Management, a venture between  ICICI
Bank Ltd. (ICICIBC) , India’s largest non-state lender and U.K.-based
Prudential Plc., had 735.52 billion rupees ($16.3 billion) in
assets at the end of March. The money manager offers 22 equity
funds, 19 debt plans and four hybrid funds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
