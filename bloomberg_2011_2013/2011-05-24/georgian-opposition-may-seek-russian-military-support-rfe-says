Georgian opposition groups expect to
get military support from Russian forces deployed in  Georgia ’s
two breakaway regions,  Radio Tavisupleba  reported, citing an
interview with Deputy Prime Minister Giorgi Baramidze.  Opposition leader Nino Burjanadze is using anti-government
protests to boost her approval rating, the Georgian-language
service of U.S.-funded Radio Free  Europe  cited Baramidze as
saying in an interview.  President Mikheil Saakashvili’s government acted
“legitimately” in preventing the protesters from entering the
state television headquarters in Tbilisi and Batumi, Baramidze
said, according to the radio station.  The accusations are “nothing but a black PR campaign from
Baramidze,” Burjanadze told reporters in Moscow today via video
link from Tbilisi.  “If any party in Georgia is relying on the Russian army,
then it’s nothing but betrayal of your own country,” Burjanadze
said. “They need to present reliable documents to prove such a
thing.”  Protests continued for a fourth day in Tbilisi today as
several dozen people gathered in the streets for a 3 p.m. rally
in the capital, Shota Utiashvili, an Interior Ministry
spokesman, said today in a phone interview from the capital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
