Hypo Alpe-Adria-Bank International
AG, the lender nationalized by  Austria  in 2009, won temporary
European Union approval for an extra 200 million euros ($282
million) in government aid, as the EU regulator expanded its
probe into the bank’s restructuring plan.  The plan “does not allay all the doubts” the EU has
concerning the bank’s return to long-term viability, the
European Commission said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
