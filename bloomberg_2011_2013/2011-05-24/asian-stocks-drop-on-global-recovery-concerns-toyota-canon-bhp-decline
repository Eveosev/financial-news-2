Asian stocks rose, snapping three
straight days of losses, as commodity prices advanced after
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. suggested buying oil, copper and zinc
and as  Sony Corp. (6758)  said it expects to turn to profit.  Korea Zinc Co., which also produces gold and silver, jumped
6.6 percent in Seoul. Jiangxi Copper Co., China’s No. 1 producer
of the metal, advanced 1.4 percent in  Hong Kong . Sony gained 2.7
percent after saying it expects to turn to profit in fiscal
2011. Li & Fung Ltd., a supplier to retailers including Wal-Mart
Stores Inc., slid 2.7 percent in Hong Kong as reports signaled
economic growth in the U.S. and  Europe  is slowing.  “Markets are quite twitchy,” said Nader Naeimi, a Sydney-
based strategist for AMP Capital Investors Ltd., which has
almost $100 billion under management. “The data is blowing hot
and cold, so for a while it’s going be a case of two steps up,
one step down.”  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index added 0.3 percent to 131.95 as
of 7:10 p.m. in Tokyo, after dropping as much as 0.4 percent
earlier. More than five stocks rose for every four that fell on
the gauge. The index slid last week for the third straight week
as Greece’s debt crisis intensified,  Japan ’s economy contracted,
and disappointing U.S. economic data fueled concern about the
global recovery.  Japan’s  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average rose 0.2 percent and South
Korea’s Kospi Index gained 0.3 percent. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng
Index added 0.1 percent. The Shanghai Composite dropped, ending
the day 9.5 percent below a five-month high reached on April 18,
near the 10 percent level that marks a so-called “correction.”
Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index decreased 0.3 percent.  Europe Debt Crisis  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index climbed 0.2
percent. The index retreated 1.2 percent in  New York  yesterday,
the most since March 16, as commodities slumped amid concern
Europe’s debt crisis is worsening and the global economic
recovery is losing momentum.  Korea Zinc surged 6.6 percent to 374,000 won in  Seoul .
Jiangxi Copper advanced 1.4 percent to HK$24.65 in Hong Kong.
Cnooc Ltd., China’s biggest offshore oil producer, climbed 1.1
percent to HK$18.06 in Hong Kong.  Goldman Sachs suggested buying oil, copper and zinc even as
it cut forecasts for Asian earnings and economic growth.  The brokerage advised a return to raw materials after
suggesting to investors last month to sell copper and oil.
Goldman raised its three-, six- and 12-month forecasts for Brent
crude futures as Libyan supply cuts lead to the “effective
exhaustion” of spare production capacity in the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries.  Oil, Copper  Oil futures climbed as much as 1.5 percent in New York
today, reversing earlier declines, while copper rose as much as
1.8 percent on the London Metal Exchange.  Sony rallied 2.7 percent to 2,270 yen in  Tokyo , leading the
region’s technology stocks higher. Japan’s No. 1 electronics
exporter, which reported a full-year net loss of 260 billion yen
($3.2 billion) for the past fiscal year, said it expects to turn
to profit in fiscal 2011.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index lost 4.4 percent this year
through yesterday, compared with a gain of 4.8 percent by the
 S&P 500  and a drop of 0.4 percent by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.
Stocks in the Asian benchmark were valued at 13.2 times
estimated earnings on average, compared with 13.3 times for the
S&P 500 and 11 times for the Stoxx 600.  Li & Fung slid 2.7 percent to HK$17.38 in Hong Kong.  LG
Electronics Inc. (066570) , the world’s third-largest maker of mobile
phones that counts  North America  as its biggest market, lost 1.5
percent to 101,000 won in Seoul.  Billabong International Ltd. (BBG) ,
the world’s No. 1 surfwear maker, dropped 1.5 percent to A$5.87.  Below-Trend Growth  The Federal  Reserve Bank  of Chicago’s gauge of economic
activity unexpectedly dropped below zero in April. The national
index, which draws on 85 economic indicators, was minus 0.45 in
April versus 0.32 in March. A reading below zero indicates
below-trend growth in the national economy.  “Recovery in the  U.S. economy  is coming to a halt,” said
 Fumiyuki Nakanishi , a strategist at Tokyo-based SMBC Friend
Securities Co. “Momentum lacks strength in Europe, and in  China 
and there’s a sense of caution against the global economy.”  In Europe, services and manufacturing growth slowed more
than economists forecast in May. A composite index based on a
survey of euro-area purchasing managers in both industries fell
to a seven-month low of 55.4 from 57.8 in April, London-based
Markit Economics said yesterday.  That’s the largest drop since November 2008 and less than
the median forecast of 17 economists surveyed by Bloomberg for a
reading of 57.3. A reading above 50 indicates expansion.  Belgium had the outlook on its AA+ credit rating lowered to
negative from stable at  Fitch Ratings , which cited concern over
the pace of structural reform.  “You have a contagion issue from the European debt crisis,
while on the other hand you have indications that the global
recovery is broadly strengthening but has hit a soft patch,”
said AMP Capital’s Naeimi.  To contact the reporters on this story:
