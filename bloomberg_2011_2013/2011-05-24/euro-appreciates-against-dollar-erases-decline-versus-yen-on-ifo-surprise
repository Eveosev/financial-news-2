The euro rose versus the dollar for
the first time in three days as the Ifo index of German business
confidence unexpectedly held near a record high, fueling bets
the  European Central Bank  will resume raising  interest rates .  New Zealand’s dollar climbed against all of its 16 most-
traded peers after a central-bank report showed company
executives in the nation raised their inflation outlook. The
dollar and yen fell versus most major peers after being the top
performers yesterday. The euro rose versus Canada’s dollar even
after Greek Prime Minister  George Papandreou  said the nation
won’t be able to tap the  debt market  next year.  “Ifo has given the euro some steam,” said  Joe Manimbo , a
market analyst in  Washington  at Travelex Global Business
Payments, a currency-exchange network. “We are seeing a little
bit of profit-taking on the dollar’s rally yesterday, which has
helped stocks, commodities and higher-yielding currencies find
some footing.”  The euro strengthened 0.4 percent to $1.41 at 5 p.m. in  New
York , from $1.4048 yesterday. The currency slipped below $1.40
yesterday for the first time since March 18. It rose 0.3 percent
to 115.56 yen today, from 115.20 yen. The dollar was little
changed at 81.95 yen, compared with 82.01 yesterday.  Commodities rallied after tumbling yesterday. The Thomson
Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of raw materials increased 0.7
percent after falling as much as 1.6 percent yesterday. The MSCI
World Index of stocks rose 0.2 percent.  Dollar Index  IntercontinentalExchange Inc.’s Dollar Index fell 0.2
percent to 75.931 after a report showed U.S. manufacturing in
the mid-Atlantic region fell to the lowest level in two years.
The gauge, which tracks the greenback against the currencies of
six major U.S. trading partners, is weighted 57.6 percent to
movements in the euro. It touched 76.366 yesterday, its
strongest level since April 1.  The Federal  Reserve Bank  of Richmond’s manufacturing index
slid to negative six in May, compared with a reading of 10 the
April and a forecast of nine in a Bloomberg News survey.  The euro has dropped almost 5 percent from its 2011 high of
$1.4940, reached May 4. It weakened on concern  Greece  may have
to restructure its debt as it struggles to contain its  budget
deficit  and meet the conditions of a 110 billion-euro ($155
billion) rescue package.  Papandreou said in  Athens  today Greece won’t be able to
access markets for financing in 2012 because the European Union
has failed to convince investors it’s successfully tackling the
debt crisis. The prime minister is trying to build support in
parliament for new budget measures and state-asset sales.  Business Climate  The Ifo institute in Munich said its German business
climate index, based on a survey of 7,000 executives, stayed at
114.2 this month from last, after touching a record of 115.4 in
February. A Bloomberg survey forecast a decrease to 113.7.  “It’s probably enough to confirm the ECB’s own thinking
that the core of  Europe  is still strong and they need to move
away from some of that accommodative policy,” said  Richard Franulovich , a senior currency strategist at Westpac Banking
Corp. in New York. “The mentality of the marketplace has
shifted to ‘sell euro on rally’ mode.”  The ECB lifted its main refinancing rate to 1.25 percent in
April in the first increase since 2008. The Fed’s target rate
has been in a range of zero to 0.25 percent since 2008. There’s
a 15 percent chance the U.S. central bank will increase the rate
at its December meeting, according to CME Group Inc. data,
compared with a 24 percent likelihood a month ago.  Kiwi Climbs  New Zealand ’s dollar, nicknamed the kiwi, appreciated 0.8
percent to 79.65 U.S. cents after touching 80.16, the highest
level since May 3. It gained 0.8 percent to 65.29 yen.  Inflation will average 3 percent in two years, according to
the 75 business managers surveyed for the Reserve Bank of New
Zealand. Expectations rose from 2.6 percent in the previous
survey in February and are the highest since the third quarter
of 2008, the central bank said on its website.  Sterling earlier snapped two days of gains versus the euro
after Moody’s Investors Service placed U.K. financial
institutions on review for downgrades and a central-bank
official said further stimulus may be needed.  Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY)  and Royal Bank of Scotland Group
Plc are among 14 U.K. lenders whose debt Moody’s is considering
downgrading as withdrawal of government support may increase
their credit risk.  ‘Further Loosening’  “Until underlying growth resumes, we can’t be certain that
it will, of its own accord,” Bank of England Markets Director
Paul Fisher said in the text of a speech delivered in Edinburgh
yesterday and released by the central bank in  London  today. “At
the very least, that makes me pause to consider when policy
should start to be normalized, or even whether further loosening
might be justified.”  The pound was little changed at 87.15 pence per euro after
falling earlier as much as 0.4 percent. Sterling rose 0.3
percent to $1.6177.  The Norwegian krone climbed against all the most-traded
currencies except New Zealand’s dollar as crude oil for July
delivery increased as much as 2.5 percent to $100.09 a barrel in
New York. Norway is the world’s seventh-largest oil exporter.
The currency strengthened 0.6 percent to 5.5641 per dollar.  Canada ’s dollar dropped versus most major peers, falling
0.2 percent to C$1.3772 per euro. It gained 0.1 percent to 97.67
cents per  U.S. dollar .  To contact the reporters on this story:
