Joakim Noah of the  Chicago Bulls  was
fined $50,000 by the  National Basketball Association  for using a
term the league said was “derogatory and offensive” during an
exchange with a fan.  The incident during the first quarter of the Bulls’ 96-85
loss at Miami in Game 3 of the NBA’s Eastern Conference finals
occurred two days ago. The NBA announced the fine last night in
a statement after meeting with Noah.  “I got caught up,” the Bulls’ fourth-year center told
reporters after the game. “A fan said something and I said
something back. I apologize.”  Noah’s discipline comes just more than a month after  Kobe Bryant  of the  Los Angeles Lakers  was fined $100,000 by the NBA
for directing a similar comment toward a referee.  Bryant’s penalty included a fine for verbal abuse of a game
official, the NBA said.  Noah, who has a salary of about $3.1 million this season,
said he was frustrated after picking up two early fouls and
reacted improperly when the opposing fan shouted at him.  “A fan said something to me and I was really upset about
it. I said some things I shouldn’t have said,” Noah, who had
one point in Game 3, said in an interview on the team’s website.
“It wasn’t right and I’m going to deal with the consequences. I
don’t want to be a distraction to the team.”  The Bulls have lost two straight games and trail the Heat
2-1 in the best-of-seven Eastern Conference finals. Miami hosts
Game 4 tonight.  To contact the reporter on this story:
