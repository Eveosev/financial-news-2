Ukraineâ€™s corn harvest will probably
be higher than previously forecast after plantings reached a
record, UkrAgroConsult said.  The harvest forecast may be raised to 13.2 million metric
tons from the current estimate of 12.7 million tons, the Kiev-
based researcher said today in an e-mailed statement. Farmers
sowed a record 3.24 million hectares (8 million acres), the
researcher said.  UkrAgroConsult is scheduled to update its crop forecasts
formally early next month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
