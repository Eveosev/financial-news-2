Great Portland Estates Plc (GPOR)  is in
talks to cut its stake in 100 Bishopsgate, a development in the
City of London financial district, to as little as 25 percent
from 50 percent.  Great  Portland , the best performing U.K. real estate
investment trust in the last six months, is in discussions with
more than one company about the stake, Chief Executive Officer
Toby Courtauld said in a telephone interview today. Brookfield
Properties Corp. owns the rest of the project, a skyscraper that
will cost about 600 million pounds ($968 million) to build.  “We would need to put in about 300 million pounds, which
is a lot for a company with a market capitalization of about 1.3
billion pounds,” Courtauld said.  Four other office towers are under construction in central
 London , including the buildings known as the Walkie-Talkie and
the Cheesegrater. Developers aim to capitalize on a shortage of
 office space  in London that’s driving up rents.  Brookfield bought its stake in 100 Bishopsgate for 43
million pounds in March 2010. Demolition work on the project
started last month. When its completed, the 40-story building
will have more than 950,000 square feet (88,300 square meters)
of space.  Great Portland may buy development sites in the London
neighborhoods of Hammersmith, Paddington and Euston for the
first time because properties in the West End district have
become too expensive, Courtauld said. About 79 percent of Great
Portland’s real estate is in the  West End .  To contact the reporter on this story:
