Turkish stocks climbed to one-week
high and the lira gained the first time in four days as some
traders speculated the central bank may not raise lenders’
 reserve requirements  at a meeting tomorrow.  The  ISE National 100 index (XU100) , in which banks have a 39
percent weighting, advanced 2.1 percent to 64,561.40 at the 5:30
p.m. close in Istanbul, the highest level since May 17. Turkey’s
currency strengthened 0.4 percent to 1.5968 per dollar.  “A group of investors are possibly betting on no hike in
reserve requirement,” Bali Ekin, head of equity trading at
Credit Europe Bank NV in Amsterdam, said in e-mailed comments.
No increase would make the market “really rally,” and “a 100
basis point hike won’t hurt,” he said.  The central bank is trying to slow economic growth, which
swells the country’s import bill and  trade gap , without raising
the benchmark rate and risking inflows of short-term capital.
Policy makers have raised reserve requirements for lira deposits
four times since December. The bank will announce its decision
at 2 p.m. in Ankara tomorrow.  An index of lenders, including  Akbank TAS (AKBNK) , part-owned by
Citigroup Inc., and  Turkiye Garanti Bankasi AS (GARAN) , the country’s
second-biggest lender by market cap, snapped a four-day losing
streak to jump 3.2 percent. Garanti added 4.1 percent to 7.18
liras, the steepest advance since April 4.  Yields on two-year benchmark debt climbed for a third day,
adding one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 8.97
percent, the highest since April 1, according to the TEB Local
Benchmark Bond Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
