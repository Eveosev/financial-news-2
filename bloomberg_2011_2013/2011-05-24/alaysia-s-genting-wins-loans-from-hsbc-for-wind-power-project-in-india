Genting Bhd. (GENT) , the Malaysian gaming
company that is Asia’s third-biggest casino operator by market
value, won loans from HSBC Holdings Plc to develop a wind power
project in India.  HSBC and one other bank have agreed to lend to the 92-
megawatt project being built in western Gujarat state, Manav
Futnani, associate director of project and export finance at
HSBC, said in an interview in  New Delhi  during the Euromoney
Renewable Energy Finance Forum today.  The project will use turbines made by Denmark’s Vestas Wind
Systems A/S, the world’s biggest wind-turbine maker. Denmark’s
export credit agency Eksport Kredit Fonden will back part of the
debt, Futnani said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
