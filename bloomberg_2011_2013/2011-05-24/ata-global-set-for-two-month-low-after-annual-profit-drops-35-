Tata Global Beverages Ltd. (TGBL) ’s shares
are headed for the lowest closing in more than two months after
the beverage unit of  India ’s second-biggest industrial group
reported a 35 percent decline in group annual profit.  The stock fell 3.3 percent to 92.4 rupees, bound for the
lowest price since March 7, and is the third-worst performer on
the BSE 100 Index today, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Group net income for the year ended March 31 dropped to
2.54 billion rupees, or 4.1 rupees a share, from 3.9 billion
rupees, or 5 rupees, the company said in an exchange filing.
Sales climbed 3.5 percent to 59.8 billion rupees.  “The declining margin indicate that the company has not
been able to pass on commodity inflation to the consumer,” said
Himani Singh, an analyst at Elara Securites Pvt. in Mumbai. The
brokerage has a “reduce” rating on the stock.  To contact the reporter on this story:
