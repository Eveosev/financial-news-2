Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY)  has hired
Toby Strauss, chief executive officer of  Aviva Plc (AV/) ’s U.K. life
insurance business, as group director for insurance, the bank
said in an e-mailed statement yesterday.  Strauss, who takes over from Archie Kane, who is retiring,
will join Lloyds on Oct. 3 and be responsible for running the
bank’s life and pensions unit as well as overseeing the
insurance division, Lloyds spokesman Ross Keany said by phone
yesterday. Rosie Harris, divisional risk officer, insurance,
will take on the role of managing director, general insurance,
according to the statement.  “Both of these appointments will further strengthen the
senior team and build on the foundations that will enable us to
deliver on our longer-term plans,” CEO Antonio Horta-Osorio
said in the statement.  The appointment of Strauss may be a sign that the bank
plans to retain its Scottish Widows insurance arm, the Financial
Times reported earlier. Horta-Osorio is due to announce the
results of a strategic review at the end of June, the FT said.  Strauss’s appointment follows an announcement in March that
Kane would be retiring. Harris will report to Strauss, while
Strauss will report to Horta-Osorio, the statement said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
