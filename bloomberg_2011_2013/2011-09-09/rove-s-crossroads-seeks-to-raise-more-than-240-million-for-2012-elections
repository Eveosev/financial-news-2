Former White House aide  Karl Rove ’s
independent Crossroads political groups will seek to raise more
than $240 million for the 2012 elections, more than doubling
their previous fundraising goal, the groups said today.  American Crossroads, which discloses its donors, and
Crossroads GPS, which doesn’t, raised $71 million for the 2010
elections to help Republicans win control of the U.S. House and
narrow the Democratic majority in the Senate. The two groups
last week said they had raised $24.5 million through Aug. 31.  Helping Rove with fundraising will be Mississippi Governor
 Haley Barbour , a former Washington lobbyist who was chairman of
the Republican National Committee from 1993 to 1997. Barbour was
chairman of the Republican Governors Association when it raised
$117 million for the 2010 elections, according to the Center for
Responsive Politics, a Washington-based research group that
studies the influence of money on politics.  Earlier this year Barbour had been considered a possible
contender for the Republican presidential nomination in 2012; he
announced in April that he wouldn’t run. “Both Governor Barbour
and Karl Rove are prodigious fundraisers and brilliant
strategists, and we are honored to have them both engaged with
us,” said Steven Law, the former U.S. Chamber of Commerce
official who is president of the two Crossroads groups. “We are
reaching high in our fundraising goals because we believe this
is going to be a destiny-shaping election for our country.”  Rove and  Ed Gillespie , another former aide to President
 George W. Bush , helped set up the Crossroads groups.  Big Donations  American Crossroads, which has spent $255,360 on behalf of
Republican nominee Mark Amodei for the Nevada congressional seat
vacated by Dean Heller when he became a U.S. senator, received
$2 million last month from Texas home builder Bob Perry and
$300,000 from Kenneth Griffin, chief executive of Citadel
Investment Group LLC in Chicago. Perry donated $7 million to
Rove’s group, while Griffin and his wife, Anne, each gave
$250,000 last year.  Democrats have set up their own outside groups to counter
the Republicans, including one led by  Bill Burton , a former aide
to President Barack Obama. The groups said they had raised more
than $10 million through June 30.  To contact the reporter on this story:
