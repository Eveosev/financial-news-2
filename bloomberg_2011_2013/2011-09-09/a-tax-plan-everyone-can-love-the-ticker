There was something for everyone in the much-anticipated jobs plan that President Barack Obama laid out to Congress tonight. Its centerpiece is a proposed reduction of the  payroll tax  to 3.1 percent. That's a 50 percent cut for companies, which currently pay a 6.2 percent rate. It's a little less of a boost for employees, whose rate had already been slashed to 4.2 percent in the stimulus package passed in December. That provision, though, only would apply to the first $5 million in payroll, squarely aimed at the small businesses that both Democrats and Republicans tout as the vibrant heart of the  U.S. economy . That may be why the president devoted much less time to explaining a proposal that could prove enticing to a larger swath of the business community -- and the voting public. He is also calling for the elimination of the payroll tax for companies that add workers or increase the wages of those they already have, with a cap on the first $50 million of new spending. Note to CEOs: Giving yourself a $50 million bonus probably won't be allowed.
