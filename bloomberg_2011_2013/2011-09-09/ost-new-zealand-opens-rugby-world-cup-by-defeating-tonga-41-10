New Zealand opened the Rugby  World
Cup  with a 41-10 win over Tonga as the top-ranked All Blacks
seek to end a 24-year title drought.  New Zealand got two tries each from Israel Dagg and Richard
Kahui, and led 29-3 at halftime after Tonga scored its first
points on a penalty just before the whistle. Second-half tries
from  Jerome Kaino  and Ma’a Nonu put the match out of reach.  Alisona Taumalolo scored Tonga’s second-ever try against
New Zealand in the 74th minute after a long buildup.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
