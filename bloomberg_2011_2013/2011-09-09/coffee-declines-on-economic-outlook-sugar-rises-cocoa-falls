Coffee fell to a two-week low on
concern that slowing economies will dent demand as supplies
climb. Sugar advanced, while cocoa slid.  The Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of 19 commodities dropped
as much as 1.5 percent on mounting concern the global economy is
faltering. In the new crop season starting in October, coffee
supplies will increase in  Colombia  and Central America, the U.S.
 Department of Agriculture  has forecast. Before today, prices
jumped 19 percent since the end of July as inventories dwindled.  “Coffee is one of the most economically sensitive
commodities out there, and prices had gotten well above where
the fundamental values say they should be,” Spencer Patton, the
chief investment officer at Chicago-based Steel Vine Investments
LLC, said in a telephone interview. “We’ll see coffee continue
lower through the end of the year.”  Arabica coffee for December delivery fell 7.4 cents, or 2.6
percent, to $2.767 a pound at 10:42 a.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in
New York. Earlier, the price touched $2.758, the lowest since
Aug. 26.  Raw-sugar futures for October delivery rose 0.08 cent, or
0.3 percent, to 28.81 cents a pound on ICE. Cocoa futures for
December delivery retreated $24, or 0.8 percent, to $2,887 a
metric ton in  New York .  In  London , robusta coffee declined, while refined sugar and
cocoa were little changed on NYSE Liffe.  To contact the reporters on this story:
