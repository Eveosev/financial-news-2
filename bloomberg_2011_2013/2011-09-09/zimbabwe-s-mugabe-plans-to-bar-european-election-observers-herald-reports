Zimbabwean President  Robert Mugabe 
won’t invite observers from the U.K. and other European nations
to monitor the country’s next election, the Herald reported,
citing unidentified government officials.  Mugabe wants to stop them coming to the southern African
nation because of sanctions imposed on himself and members of
his Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front party, the
Harare-based newspaper reported.  Zimbabwe will probably hold elections next year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
