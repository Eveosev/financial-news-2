OAO ChelPipe advanced for a fourth
day after the Kommersant newspaper reported today that  France ’s
Vallourec SA is in talks to buy a 25 percent stake in the
Russian pipemaker, citing two people it didn’t identify.  The shares added as much as 6.3 percent before closing 0.1
percent higher at 80.1 rubles by 6:45 p.m. in Moscow.  While ChelPipe’s majority shareholders may sell a stake to
a strategic partner after consolidating full ownership of the
company, there are no “active” talks with investors now,
Chairman Sergei Moiseyev said by phone today in Moscow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
