excluding  South Africa . Stock symbols are in parentheses.  Ashaka Cement Plc (ASHAKACE)  , a Nigerian unit of Lafarge
SA, fell 40 kobo, or 2 percent, to 19.18 naira, after FBN
Capital Ltd. initiated coverage of the stock with an
“underperform” rating.  Dangote Sugar Refinery Plc (DANGSUGA)  ,  Nigeria ’s biggest
producer of the sweetener by market value, snapped two days of
gains, losing 10 kobo, or 1 percent, to 9.5 naira. Vetiva
Capital Ltd. reduced its recommendation to “neutral” from
“accumulate” with a price-estimate cut to 11.33 naira per
share from 16 naira per share.  Fan Milk Ghana Ltd. (FML GN), a maker of ice cream and
dairy products in the West African nation, fell 12 pesewas, or
4.4 percent, to 2.6 cedis, the lowest since May 12, as investors
speculate the company won’t post a profit gain in the third
quarter.  “Our expectation is for earnings to be flat in the third
quarter, at best a 5 percent increase in profit over the prior
year,” Randy Mensah, a stock trader at Accra-based Databank
Financial Services Ltd., said by phone. “The company increased
prices for some of its products at the beginning of the year and
it is taking time for demand to adjust. The weather too has not
played favorably for the products.”  Uchumi Supermarket Ltd. (UCSP)  , Kenya’s only publicly
traded retailer, jumped 45 cents, or 5.7 percent, to 8.35
shillings, the highest since Aug. 25, after the Nairobi-based
company said full-year revenue increased 12 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
