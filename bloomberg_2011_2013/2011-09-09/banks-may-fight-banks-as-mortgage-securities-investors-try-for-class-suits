A suit against  Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. (GS)  may go forward as a class action on behalf of all investors
in a $698 million mortgage-backed securities offering, a federal
judge in  Manhattan  ruled.  U.S. District Judge Harold Baer Jr. granted a request by
the Public Employees’ Retirement System of Mississippi to let it
represent more than 150 investors in the offering, according to
an opinion Baer gave to the parties yesterday. The opinion
hasn’t been released publicly, and a clerk in Baer’s chambers
declined to provide a copy today.  The plaintiffs say New Century Financial Corp., which
originated the mortgages underlying the securities, failed to
adhere to its underwriting standards and overstated the value of
the collateral backing the loans. They say Goldman Sachs didn’t
conduct proper due diligence when it bought the loans in 2005.
The plaintiffs are seeking unspecified damages.  Michael Duvally, a spokesman for New York-based Goldman
Sachs, didn’t immediately return a call seeking comment on the
ruling.  Class-action status allows the investors to pool financial
and legal resources, giving them greater leverage to win a
favorable settlement or verdict. In his ruling, Baer appointed
the New York-based  Bernstein Litowitz Berger & Grossman LLP  as
class counsel.  The case is Public Employees’ Retirement System of
 Mississippi  v. Goldman Sachs Group Inc., 09-01110, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of  New York  (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
