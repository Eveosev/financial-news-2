U.S. Gulf crude premiums weakened
after the U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate’s discount to
Brent narrowed the third day in a row.  The gap between WTI and Brent October contracts dropped 18
cents to $25.29 a barrel at 2:53 p.m. in  New York . The spread
settled Sept. 6 at a record margin of $26.62.  When Brent decreases versus WTI, it weakens the value of
low-sulfur U.S. grades that compete with West African oil priced
against the European benchmark.  Heavy Louisiana Sweet’s premium to West Texas Intermediate
decreased 50 cents to $31.75 a barrel at 2:21 p.m. in New York,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Light Louisiana Sweet’s
premium lost 40 cents to $29.  Among sour, or high-sulfur, grades, the premium for Mars
Blend lost $1.05 to $26.80 while Poseidon weakened $1 to $26.75
a barrel over WTI.  Southern Green Canyon’s premium lost $1 to $25.50 a barrel.
West Texas Sour’s discount narrowed 5 cents to 75 cents. Thunder
Horse’s premium decreased 50 cents to $29 above the benchmark.  Western Canada Select’s discount to WTI narrowed 25 cents
to $8.75 a barrel.  The premium for Syncrude was unchanged at $12 a barrel.
Syncrude is a light, low-sulfur synthetic oil derived from the
tar sands in  Alberta .  To contact the reporter on this story:
