German, Dutch and Finnish  government
bonds  jumped, while Italian, Spanish and Greek securities fell
amid concern  Europe ’s debt crisis is deepening as growth slows.  German 10-year and two-year yields declined to all-time
lows after the  European Central Bank  acknowledged the euro-
region economic outlook has worsened, boosting demand for the
safest assets. Bunds extended gains as the ECB said  Juergen Stark  resigned from the Executive Board, suggesting policy
makers are divided over the best way to address the crisis.
Greek 10-year yields climbed to a record, widening the spread
over similar-maturity bunds to the most since the euro began.  “There is a lot of  risk aversion  in the market,” said
Mohit Kumar, head of European interest-rate strategy at Deutsche
Bank AG in  London . “Trichet yesterday acknowledged that there
is a risk to growth and opened the door to monetary easing by
the ECB. There is a bid for any AAA rated paper.”  The German 10-year yield fell nine basis points to 1.78
percent at 4:21 p.m. in London, after falling to a euro-era
record 1.777 percent. The 2.25 percent security due September
2021 rose 0.820, or 8.20 euros per 1,000-euro ($1,372) face
amount, to 104.250. Two-year yields slid five basis points to
0.39 percent, after reaching 0.377 percent, also the least since
the euro was introduced in 1999.  Trichet, Stark  President Jean-Claude Trichet yesterday left the door open
for the ECB to reverse the rate increases it implemented this
year and add new liquidity lines to the region’s troubled banks.
The central bank left its main refinancing rate on hold at 1.5
percent and cut its growth forecasts for 2011 and 2012.  Stark, also the central bank’s chief economist, informed
Trichet he would resign his board position “for personal
reasons,” the ECB said in a statement.  Euribor futures rose, pushing the implied yield on the June
contract down six basis points to 0.96 percent, signaling
traders added to wagers for lower borrowing costs.  A Credit Suisse Group AG index based on swaps shows traders
are betting the ECB will lower its refinancing rate by 34 basis
points over the next 12 months. As recently as Aug. 1, they
forecast an increase of 25 basis points.  The Netherlands’ 10-year bond yields fell to 2.218 percent,
the least since at least 1999 when the euro was introduced.
Finland’s 10-year yields dropped nine basis points to 2.26
percent, after reaching a record low 2.257 percent.  Greek Bonds  Greek securities extended seven weeks of losses as
bondholders weighed whether to participate in a debt exchange
that’s crucial to the nation’s second bailout.  Greece  is seeking preliminary responses today from
investors to the proposed swap, part of a 159 billion-euro
European Union rescue plan agreed upon in July. Responses to the
inquiry, which is not a formal offer, are nonbinding and will be
aggregated by regulators on a country-by-country basis,
according to the Greek government.  Ten-year Greek yields climbed as much as 47 basis points to
a record 20.60 percent. The spread between the nation’s 10-year
yields over similar-maturity German bunds widened 52 basis
points to a euro-era record 1,878 basis points, or 18.78
percentage points. The nation’s two-year notes fell, pushing the
yield up as much as 203 basis points, or 2.03 percentage points,
to a euro-era record 57.08 percent.  Credit-default swaps insuring Greek sovereign debt jumped
212 basis points to a record 3,238, according to CMA. The five-
year contracts signal there’s a 92 percent probability the
country won’t meet its debt commitments.  Italian Bonds  Italian 10-year bonds fell, with yields increasing 11 basis
points to 5.39 percent. Two-year note yields climbed 26 basis
points to 4.18 percent.  The nation plans to sell 18.5 billion euros of debt on
Sept. 12 and 13, while Spain will auction securities maturing in
2019 and 2020 on Sept. 15. The ECB began buying Spanish and
Italian bonds on Aug. 8 to curb a surge in yields as contagion
from the debt crisis that engulfed Greece, Ireland and  Portugal 
spread to the region’s third- and fourth-largest economies.  “Next week’s supply is causing some headaches,” said
 David Schnautz , a fixed-income strategist at Commerzbank AG in
London. “It’s getting harder and harder to get the same
investors to step up to the plate and pick up these bonds. There
is still a lot of uncertainty and there are many reasons why the
market might try to push bund yields lower.”  Italy’s gross domestic product rose 0.3 percent in the
second quarter from the previous three months, when it grew 0.1
percent, a government report showed today. The economy expanded
0.8 percent from a year earlier, according to the data.  Spain ’s 10-year bond yields advanced 12 basis points to
5.16 percent, and two-year yields gained 18 basis points to 3.58
percent.  German government bonds have returned 7.4 percent this
year, according to indexes compiled by the European Federation
of Financial Analysts Societies and Bloomberg, while Treasuries
gained 8.3 percent. Italian bonds have lost 1.1 percent, Spain’s
have risen 5.4 percent and Greece’s have slumped 30 percent, the
indexes show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
