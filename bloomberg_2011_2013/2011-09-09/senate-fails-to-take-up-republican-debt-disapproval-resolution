The Senate refused to take up a
Republican resolution that would bar a $500 billion increase in
the U.S. debt limit.  Senators voted 52-45 today not to consider the measure.
Senate Minority Leader  Mitch McConnell , a Kentucky Republican,
offered the resolution under a procedure set up by legislation
approved last month to raise the debt limit by at least $2.1
trillion.  The procedure allows Congress to try to avert phased-in
rises in the limit through disapproval resolutions. Even if
Congress approved the resolution, there would be little chance
of it mustering the two-thirds majority in both chambers needed
to override a veto by President  Barack Obama .  The debt-limit measure Obama signed into law Aug. 2 also
calls for $2.4 trillion in spending reductions over the next
decade.  To contact the reporter on this story:
