The rate at which London-based banks
say they can borrow for three months in dollars climbed to the
highest level in more than a year.  The  London  interbank offered rate, or Libor, for dollar
loans rose to 0.33794 percent from 0.33683 percent yesterday,
according to the British Bankers’ Association. That’s the
highest level since Aug. 19, 2010.  The dollar Libor-OIS spread, a gauge of banks’ reluctance
to lend, was at 26.09 basis points as of 11:44 a.m. in London,
from 25.68 basis points yesterday. That’s the most since July
30, 2010, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
