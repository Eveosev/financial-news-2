India’s 10-year bonds completed a
weekly advance on speculation the central bank will keep
borrowing costs unchanged at a policy review next week.  The  Reserve Bank  of India has increased its repurchase rate
eleven times since March 2010 to damp inflation, last raising it
by 50 basis points to 8 percent on July 26. The next policy
review is on Sept. 16. Concern that global growth is stalling
may prompt the central bank to hold rates, said Vivek Rajpal, a
Mumbai-based fixed-income strategist at Nomura Holdings Inc.  “There is a fair chance of a pause in rates,” Rajpal
said. “The RBI has already hiked borrowing costs aggressively
and it may want to see the impact of those increases on the
economy.”  The yield on the 7.8 percent bonds due April 2021 fell
three basis points, or 0.03 percentage points, this week to 8.31
percent at the 5 p.m. close in Mumbai, according to the central
bank’s trading system. It rose two basis points today.  India ’s inflation may slow to less than 7 percent by the
end of March 2012, Planning Commission Deputy Chairman  Montek Singh Ahluwalia  said yesterday. The wholesale-price index rose
9.22 percent in July from a year earlier, with gains exceeding 9
percent each month since December.  The  finance ministry  sold 110 billion rupees ($2.4 billion)
of bonds today, which is part of the government’s 4.17 trillion-
rupee borrowing target for the fiscal year ending March 2012.  The cost of one-year interest-rate swaps, or derivative
contracts used to guard against fluctuations in borrowing costs,
fell 19 basis points to 7.66 percent, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
