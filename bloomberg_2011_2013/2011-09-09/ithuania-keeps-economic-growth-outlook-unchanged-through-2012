Lithuania kept its economy growth
forecast unchanged through next year, the  Finance Ministry  said
today.  Gross domestic product will rise 5.8 percent this year, the
same as seen in the March forecast, the Vilnius-based  ministry 
said in an e-mailed statement. Economic output will slow to 4.7
percent in 2012.  The Baltic nationâ€™s economy is expanding at the second-
fastest pace in the European Union after  Estonia . GDP rose 6.3
percent in the second quarter driven by exports and recovering
domestic demand.  Inflation will average 4.5 percent this year, compared with
a previous estimate of 3.3 percent, the ministry said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
