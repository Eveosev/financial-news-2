Oleoducto de Crudos Pesados Ecuador
SA, the Ecuadorean heavy-crude pipeline operator, received
approval to ship Colombian oil to its coastal port facilities.  The Quito-based company, known as OCP, also signed an
accord with PetroEcuador to store the state-owned oil company’s
excess crude during planned repairs to the Esmeraldas refinery
next year, an OCP press official, who can’t be named because of
company policy, said today in a telephone interview.  OCP is in talks with at least four Colombian oil producers
to connect its Ecuadorean pipeline to their fields and may begin
transporting Colombian oil by next year, Chief Executive Officer
Andres Mendizabal said in a June 28 interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
