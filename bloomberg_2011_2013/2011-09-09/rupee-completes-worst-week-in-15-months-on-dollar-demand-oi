India ’s rupee completed its biggest
weekly decline in 15 months, on speculation importers stepped up
dollar purchases amid an increase in  oil prices .  The local currency reached the weakest level in a year
after crude climbed 2 percent from Sept. 2, raising costs for
importers in a nation that brings in more than 75 percent of its
fuel requirement from abroad. The Dollar Index, which tracks the
currency against six major trading partners, rose a second week.  “There’s genuine demand for dollars from  oil companies ,
which is putting pressure on the rupee,” said  Paresh Nayar ,
head of money markets and currency at Mumbai-based FirstRand
Ltd. “The second reason is the dollar has rallied.”  The rupee dropped 0.8 percent today and 1.7 percent this
week to 46.5650 per dollar at the 5 p.m. close in Mumbai, the
steepest weekly fall since the period to May 21, 2010, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. It touched 46.59 today, the
lowest level since Sept. 9, 2010.  Offshore forwards indicate the rupee will trade at 47.11 to
the dollar in three months, compared with expectations of 46.75
yesterday and 46.31 a week ago. Forwards are agreements to buy
or sell assets at a set price and date. Non-deliverable
contracts are settled in dollars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
