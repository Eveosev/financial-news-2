House Republican lawmakers asked for
a briefing from the  Justice Department  on its effort to stop
 AT&T Inc. (T) ’s purchase of T-Mobile USA Inc.  “We would like to know what the DOJ’s specific concerns
are and how these concerns relate to the impact on jobs and
economic growth,” the Republicans said in a letter yesterday to
Attorney General Eric Holder and Julius Genachowski, chairman of
the Federal Communications Commission.  The letter was signed by representatives  Fred Upton , of
Michigan, chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee; Greg Walden, of Oregon, chairman of the Subcommittee on
Communications and Technology; and  Joe Barton , of Texas, a
former chairman of the committee.  The Justice Department filed a lawsuit seeking to block the
$39 billion deal on Aug. 31, saying the transaction would lessen
competition by eliminating one of the four largest wireless
carriers in the U.S. The department has “received the letter
and will respond appropriately,”  Gina Talamona , a spokeswoman,
said in an interview.  The FCC is continuing its review, and had no comment on the
letter, Neil Grace, an agency spokesman, said in an e-mail
today.  “It is important that government officials reserve
judgment until all the facts have come to light,” the lawmakers
said in their letter.  The lawmakers asked for a briefing from both agencies for
congressional members and staff, describing “the extent to
which each agency has been considering the impact on jobs and
economic growth.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
