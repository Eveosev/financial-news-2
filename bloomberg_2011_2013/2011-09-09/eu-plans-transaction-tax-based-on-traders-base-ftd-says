The European Commission plans to
prevent banks and other investors from avoiding a planned tax on
trades by imposing it in the trader’s home country rather than
the place of the transaction,  Financial Times Deutschland 
reported, citing unidentified people close to the Commission.  The Commission will propose rates close to 0.1 percent for
trades in stocks and bonds and 0.01 percent for dealing in
derivatives, FTD said. The tax would apply to companies based
anywhere in the European Union and would also count for
transactions done in the U.S., according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
