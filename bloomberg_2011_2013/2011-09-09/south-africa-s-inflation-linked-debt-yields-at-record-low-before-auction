Yields on South African inflation-
linked bonds fell to a record low before today’s auction of the
debt after the rand weakened and consumer prices climbed at the
fastest pace in 17 months.  The Pretoria-based  Reserve Bank  is selling 600 million rand
($84 million) of inflation-linked securities, which pay interest
linked to the  consumer price index , maturing in 2022, 2028 and
2033. The secondary-market yield on the 2022 bonds dropped two
basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 2.25 percent
yesterday, the lowest since the notes were issued June 7, 2010.
The bonds yielded as much as 2.61 percent on July 6, the highest
this quarter.  Consumer inflation accelerated 5.3 percent in July, more
than the 5.2 percent forecast by 19 economist in a Bloomberg
survey, according to a government report Aug. 24. The rand has
dropped 6.5 percent versus the dollar since the start of August,
increasing the cost of imports including oil.  “We still see inflation ticking up this year,” Nomvuyo Guma, a Johannesburg-based analyst at Standard Bank Group Ltd.,
said by phone. “The rand’s movements are going to be crucial in
determining the inflation trajectory.”  Rising food and fuel costs will probably push inflation
higher than the central bank’s upper target of 6 percent in the
fourth quarter, Governor Gill Marcus said when keeping the
bank’s key interest rate on hold at 5.5 percent. Inflation is
expected to average 6.3 percent in the first three months of
2012 and remain at the upper end of the target range for the
following two quarters, the central bank said July 21.  Producer inflation accelerated at the fastest pace in more
than a year in July, the statistics agency reported on Aug. 25,
while borrowing by companies and households unexpectedly
accelerated.  Inflation is ticking higher even after economic growth
cooled to an annual 1.3 percent in the second quarter, its
slowest pace in almost two years, from 4.5 percent the previous
quarter, government data showed Aug. 30.  Tomorrow’s auction is at 11 a.m. and the results will be
announced at about 11:30 a.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
