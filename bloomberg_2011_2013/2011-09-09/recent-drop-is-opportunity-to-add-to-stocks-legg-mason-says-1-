The recent decline in global stock
markets is an opportunity for investors to add to their existing
holdings, said William Hench, manager of the Legg Mason Royce
U.S. Small Cap Opportunities Fund.  Investors still lack “conviction” in the global market,
Hench said to reporters in  Singapore . Still, share prices will
be higher a year from now, he said.  “The indiscriminate selling is allowing us to re-enter
some of our favorite names at very attractive absolute
valuations,” Hench said. “We are adding risk as the market is
removing it by reducing valuations.”  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index has dropped 5.7 percent
this year amid concern the global economic recovery is
faltering. President Barack Obama yesterday urged Congress to
pass a $447 billion proposal to spur hiring.  “They had to do something, but I don’t think it will
change the overall picture,” Hench said. The  U.S. economy  still
needs auto sales and the housing market to recover, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
