U.K.  government bonds  rose, snapping
a three-day decline, as a slide in European stocks and concern
the global economic recovery is faltering spurred demand for
safer securities.  Ten-year gilts extended a second weekly gain after a report
showed producer prices increased last month at the slowest pace
in a year, boosting the case for more economic stimulus from the
 Bank of England . The Stoxx Europe 600 Index declined 1.7 percent
and the FTSE 100 Index slid 1.9 percent. The pound fell to an
eight-week low against the dollar and gained versus the euro.  “Risk markets are off and therefore gilts and bunds are
outperforming,” said Vatsala Datta, an interest-rate strategist
at Lloyds Bank Corporate Markets in  London . “Demand for core
paper will remain in the near term. Clearly while the near-term
risks to inflation are on the upside, longer-term risks are
definitely to the downside.”  Ten-year gilt yields fell seven basis points to 2.28
percent at 4:13 p.m. in London, extending their decline this
week to 16 basis points. The yield slid to a record 2.237
percent Aug. 18. The 3.75 percent bond due September 2020 rose
0.61, or 6.10 pounds per 1,000-pound ($1,597) face amount, to
111.90. Two-year yields slid two basis points to 0.54 percent.  The spread between two- and 10-year yields shrank to 1.74
percentage points from 1.80 percentage points yesterday and 1.89
percentage points last week. The so-called flattening of the
yield curve suggests investors favor longer maturities on
speculation slower growth will reduce inflation.  Factory Prices  U.K. producer prices rose 0.1 percent from July, when they
gained a revised 0.3 percent, the  Office for National Statistics 
said in London. The increase is the smallest since September
2010. Prices rose 6.1 percent from a year earlier.  “Producer-price inflation remains high but there are signs
of moderation,” Blerina Uruci, a U.K. economist at  Barclays
Capital  in London, wrote in a client note today. “Weak demand
might also push firms toward accepting a squeeze in margins,
further containing output price inflation.”  Short-sterling futures rose, with the implied yield on the
June 2012 contract falling two basis points to 0.93 percent,
signaling that investors reduced wagers on higher rates. The
Bank of England kept interest rates unchanged at a record low
yesterday. Policy makers also decided to maintain their asset-
purchase program, or quantitative easing, at 200 billion pounds
($319 billion).  Gilts have returned 2.2 percent this month, compared with
2.1 percent for German government bonds and 1.1 percent for U.S.
Treasuries, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the
European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies.  The pound weakened 0.5 percent to $1.5880, after falling to
$1.5894, the lowest level since July 12. The currency climbed
0.9 percent to 86.61 pence per euro on speculation the  European
Central Bank  will cut  interest rates  this year as the economic
outlook deteriorates.  Sterling fell 6 percent in the past 12 months against a
basket of nine major peers, according to Bloomberg Correlation-
Weighted Currency Indexes, making it the second-worst performer
after the  U.S. dollar .  To contact the reporters on this story:
