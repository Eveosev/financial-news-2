Mexican President Felipe Calderon
proposed a smaller-than-requested increase to the investment
budget for  Petroleos Mexicanos , presenting a funding plan of 301
billion pesos ($24.1 billion) to federal lawmakers.  The proposal sent yesterday to the lower house allocates a
5.2 percent increase for the Mexico City-based company’s
investments next year, up from this year’s 286 billion pesos,
according to the Finance Ministry’s  website . The proposal is 9
percent less than what the company asked for.  The board of Pemex, as the company is known, had requested
331 billion pesos for investments, member Fluvio Ruiz said July
27. The company’s total budget, including capital investments,
would be 442.5 billion pesos under Calderon’s proposal, compared
with 418 billion pesos in 2011. Last year, Congress trimmed the
total budget by 2 billion from the 420 billion pesos requested
by Calderon.  The  Finance Ministry  expects Pemex’s oil output to fall
next year to 2.55 million barrels a day, compared with the
government’s estimate of 2.593 million barrels a day for this
year.  As of July 31, Pemex had invested 106.7 billion pesos, or
37 percent, of its 2011 budget, according to a monthly company
report. Last year’s budget proposal was cut to 286 billion pesos
from 300 billion pesos by the finance ministry before being sent
to Congress for final approval.  Calderon’s budget plan assumes exported oil will sell in
2012 for an average of $84.9 a barrel, $19.5 more than this
year’s budgeted $65.4 a barrel price.  The lower house of congress must approve the income portion
of the budget by Oct. 20 and the spending portion by Nov. 15.
The senate will have until Oct. 31 to approve the income portion
of the budget.  To contact the reporter on this story:
