Hin Leong Trading Pte and Glencore
International AG bought gasoil cargoes in  Singapore  at lower
prices than yesterday. Refining profits for naphtha fell.  Middle Distillates  Hin Leong bought 150,000 barrels of gasoil with 0.5 percent
sulfur from BP Plc at a discount of 25 cents to benchmark
prices, according to a Bloomberg News survey of traders
monitoring transactions on the Platts window today. The closely
held Singapore trader bought 180,000 barrels from Royal Dutch
Shell Plc at parity to spot prices. That compares with the
premium of 10 cents that Hin Leong paid for 180,000 barrels
yesterday.  Glencore bought 150,000 barrels of the same grade from
ConocoPhillips at a discount of 35 cents to benchmark prices,
and bought 175,000 barrels from Shell at a discount of 20 cents.  Gasoil’s crack spread compared with Dubai crude, a measure
of profit for refiners from the fuel, rose 48 cents, or 2.8
percent, to $17.70 a barrel this week, according to data from
PVM Oil Associates Ltd.  Light Distillates  Glencore sold 50,000 barrels of 92-RON gasoline to Arcadia
Petroleum Ltd. at $126 a barrel. ConocoPhillips sold 50,000
barrels of 95-RON to PetroChina Co. at $127.40 a barrel.  Naphtha’s premium to London-traded Brent crude futures rose
to $114.06 a ton at 5:45 p.m. Singapore time from $117.36 a ton
at the end of trading in  Asia  on Sep. 2, based on data compiled
by Bloomberg.  Shanghai Secco Petrochemical Co., a venture between BP and
 China  Petroleum & Chemical Corp., shut China’s biggest naphtha
cracker following a fire. The blaze yesterday evening was
caused by a pipeline leak, Angela Qian, a public affairs manager
at Shanghai Secco, said today.  Fuel Oil   Total SA bought 20,000 metric tons of 180-centistoke fuel
oil from BP at a premium of $4.50 a ton over benchmark prices,
the survey showed.  Fuel oil’s discount to Dubai crude narrowed by 43 cents, or
6.8 percent, to $5.96 a barrel at 7 p.m. Singapore time,
according to PVM Oil. The smaller spread indicates refining
losses from the fuel are smaller.  To contact the reporter on this story:
