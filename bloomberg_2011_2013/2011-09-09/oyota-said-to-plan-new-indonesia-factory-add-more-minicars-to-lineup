Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) , Asia’s biggest
carmaker, will build a new factory in  Indonesia  to meet growing
demand for minicars in the country, according to a company
official familiar with the matter.  The automaker will spend about 30 billion yen ($387
million) on the facility to be built in Karawang, where Toyota
already operates one factory, said the official, who declined to
be identified as the plan hasn’t been announced.  Toyota is expanding in Indonesia, where its Daihatsu Motor
Co. unit operates two plants making Avanza minivans, as part of
a plan to increase emerging market sales to about half the total
by 2015. Economic growth expected to reach 7 percent next year
is spurring car demand in  Southeast Asia ’s biggest economy.  A spokesman for Toyota declined to comment on the planned
factory in Karawang. The Nikkei newspaper reported Toyota’s
plans to build the plant earlier today.  Toyota fell 0.74 percent to 2,680 yen at the 3 p.m. close
of Tokyo trading.  Karawang Plant  Toyota in May said it would invest 16.5 billion yen to
expand output capacity at its Karawang plant 70 kilometers (43
miles) outside Jakarta. The new plant would open as early as
2013, according to the official.  The automaker sold 281,055 units last year in Indonesia,
where sales by all makers reached a record 745,000 units. Toyota
is the biggest carmaker in Indonesia, controlling about 60
percent of the market when sales from its Daihatsu unit are
included.  Vehicle sales in Indonesia by all makers will probably
exceed 1 million units by 2013, Yasuhiro Takahashi, Toyota’s
group manager of operations for  Asia  and Oceania, said Sept. 5.  Indonesia’s gross domestic product increased 6.49 percent
in the three months to June from a year earlier, the  Central
Bureau of Statistics  said Aug. 5. This was the third straight
quarter where GDP was more than 6 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
