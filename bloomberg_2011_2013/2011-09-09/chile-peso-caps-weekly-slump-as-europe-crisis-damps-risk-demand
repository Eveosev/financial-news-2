Chile ’s peso fell the most since the
first week of the year, when the central bank announced a $12
billion dollar-buying program, as European debt concern eroded
demand for riskier assets such as emerging-market currencies.  The peso depreciated 2 percent to 469.45 per  U.S. dollar  at
12:29 p.m. New York time from 460.06 on Sept. 2. All but one of
25 emerging-market currencies tracked by Bloomberg fell this
week. Copper, which accounts for half of Chile’s exports, fell
as much as 3.6 percent today.  The European currency lost 3.8 percent against the dollar
this week and stocks worldwide tumbled as officials said
 Germany ’s government is bracing for a Greek default and a
European Central Bank board member resigned.  “Compared with the movement in the euro, the peso has
still not moved much,” said Juan Pablo Castro, an economist at
Banco Santander SA in Santiago. “At another moment it would
have reacted more, but copper remains near historically high
levels and Chile’s terms of trade improved during August. That
compensates for high  risk aversion  and falling rates.”  Yields on Chilean bonds have fallen in the last month on
the expectation the central bank would raise rates. Bond yields
were mixed this week after the central bank said it expected
rates to remain stable.  Chile’s central paid an average of 468.24 per dollar for
$50 million today as part of the $12 billion effort to limit the
peso’s gains, according to data posted on its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
