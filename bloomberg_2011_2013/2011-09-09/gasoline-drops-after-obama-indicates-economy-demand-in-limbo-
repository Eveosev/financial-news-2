Gasoline dropped along with equities
for a second day on concern that the U.S. economic recovery is
at a standstill and fuel demand may shrink.  Futures tumbled as much as 3.9 percent after President
 Barack Obama  late yesterday detailed his $447 billion plan to
boost hiring and policy makers failed to signal how they will
rescue the economy. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slipped 1.4
percent at 10:22 a.m. in New York, the fifth drop in the past
six trading days.  “We don’t see enough signs of demand from economic
growth,” said  Gene McGillian , an analyst and broker at
Tradition Energy in  Stamford , Connecticut. Obama’s remarks
indicated that the economy is “in limbo” unless measures are
taken by Congress, he said.  Gasoline for October delivery fell 9.27 cents, or 3.2
percent, to $2.7925 a gallon at 10:22 a.m. on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange .  Obama called on Congress to pass his package after jobs
growth stalled last month, fueling concern the U.S. recovery is
faltering.  U.S. gasoline inventories rose 199,000 barrels to 208.8
million last week, the Energy Department reported. Analysts
forecast a drop of 1.4 million, according to the median estimate
of a Bloomberg survey.  Stockpiles of heating oil and diesel increased 709,000
barrels to 156.8 million in the week ended Sept. 2, according to
the government report.  Heating oil for October delivery dropped 6.01 cents, or 2
percent, to $2.9842 a gallon.  Regular gasoline at the pump, averaged nationwide, rose 0.4
cent to $3.659 a gallon yesterday, according to AAA data. It’s
the first increase this week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
