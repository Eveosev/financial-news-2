Slovakia’s central bank said the
euro area member shouldn’t resist deeper economic integration in
the region, contradicting Finance Minister Ivan Miklos.  “Within the tendency of where the euro zone’s integration
process is heading, Slovakia shall strive to remain a part of a
bigger economic entity even in the case of initiatives to deepen
economic integration,” the Bratislava, Slovakia-based bank said
in an e-mailed statement today.  Earlier today Miklos rejected plans for creating a deeper
fiscal union of the countries sharing the euro as well as an
idea of joint bond issuance. Such proposals won’t solve the debt
crisis and would reduce pressure on individual countries to
improve their public finances and hurt the region’s
competitiveness, he said at a conference in Krynica, Poland.  European leaders and central banks are seeking to stop the
fiscal crisis, which began more than a year ago in  Greece , from
spreading. A closer fiscal union of countries as well as the
joint issuance of bonds have been voiced by officials among
proposals to solve the debt crisis.  The Slovak central bank said today that such a union may
include harmonization of direct taxes, a move that has been
fiercely opposed by Slovakia. The country’s 19 percent flat
income tax, criticized by western peers as unfair tax
competition, has helped the country to lure investors and kick-
start growth last decade.  The bank also called upon the government to as soon as
possible adopt measures that would allow achieving a balanced
budget inthe ‘ medium-term horizon.  To contact the reporter on this story:
