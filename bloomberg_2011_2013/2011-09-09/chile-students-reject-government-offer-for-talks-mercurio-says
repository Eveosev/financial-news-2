Chilean student leaders said the
government must suspend bills to reform the education system
that it has sent to congress before they will accept an offer to
join a negotiating table,  El Mercurio  reported.  The students, who have organized three months of protests
to demand more state spending on education, made the
announcement following a meeting in the city of Talca yesterday,
the Santiago-based newspaper reported on its website.  The student movement will make a counteroffer on
negotiations on Sept. 12,  El Mercurio  reported, citing Patricio
Contreras, president of the Federation of Students at the
Universidad de Los Lagos.  To contact the reporter on this story:
