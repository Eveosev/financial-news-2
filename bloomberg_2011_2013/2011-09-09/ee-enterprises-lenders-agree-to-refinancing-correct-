(Corrects second-lien rate in third paragraph.)  Lee Enterprises Inc., the news and
advertising publisher that owns the St. Louis-Dispatch, will pay
lenders as much as 15 percent to refinance $904.5 million of
debt as it tries to avoid bankruptcy.  A $689.5 million first-lien  term loan  will mature in
December 2015, instead of 2012, the company said yesterday in a
 press release . The debt will pay 6.25 percentage points more
than the London interbank offered rate and the lending benchmark
will have a 1.25 percent floor.  A $175 million, second-lien credit, which will mature in
April 2017 rather than 2015, will pay a fixed rate of 15
percentage points, the company said.  “The refinancing will remove a cloud that has obscured
Lee’s formidable strengths in our markets,” Mary Junck,
chairman and chief executive officer of Lee, said in the
statement.  Lee, based in Davenport,  Iowa , also amended a $40 million
revolver that will mature in 2015 and pay five percentage points
more than Libor with a 1.25 percent floor.  As a condition of the transaction, Lee must refinance its
bonds that are due in April 2012 with a separate $175 million
financing, the company said.  The $175 million could come in the form of a bond or
leveraged loan, Chief Financial Officer Carl Schmidt said in a
telephone interview. The timing and arranger of the new
financing hasn’t been determined, he said.  Deutsche Bank AG is agent for the bank loans. The
Blackstone Group advised Lee.  Deutsche Bank and SunTrust Banks Inc. arranged the original
loans for Lee Enterprises in 2005, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
