The liquidator of  Bernard Madoff ’s
firm is planning an initial distribution of $272 million to
investors holding allowed claims as of Sept. 15, according to a
court filing.  Trustee Irving Picard intends to issue payments by the end
of the third quarter, after reviewing allowed claims against the
jailed con man, he said in July. The average check, arriving
almost three years after the Ponzi scheme collapsed, will be
$222,551, he said.  Holders of claims against Madoff that were sold or
transferred will only receive distributions from Picard if the
21-day notice and objection period on the transfer has expired
by Sept. 15, according to the filing.  Picard, who has filed more than 1,000 lawsuits seeking
money for Madoff investors, in May allotted $2.6 billion to a
fund for victims of the  Ponzi scheme . Because of court
challenges, most of the $8.6 billion he has raised isn’t
currently available to put in the customer fund or distribute to
claimholders who lost an estimated $17.3 billion in principal,
he has said.  Madoff, 73, is in a federal prison in  North Carolina ,
serving a 150-year sentence for the fraud. Picard and his  law
firm , Baker & Hostetler LLP, have made about $179 million in
fees since Madoff’s 2008 arrest.  The main case is Securities Investor Protection Corp. v.
Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC, 08-ap-1789,  U.S.
Bankruptcy Court , Southern District of  New York  ( Manhattan ).  To contact the reporter on this story:
