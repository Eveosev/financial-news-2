Royale Furniture Holdings Ltd. (1198) , a
Hong Kong-based maker of home furniture, hired Hang Seng Bank
Ltd. to help it arrange a HK$300 million ($38.5 million) loan,
according to a person familiar with the matter.  The three-year debut loan will likely be signed this month,
said the person, asking not to be identified as details are
private.  The facility, which can be drawn in U.S. and Hong Kong
dollars, pays a so-called top-level all-in of 370 basis points
more than the London interbank offered rate or the Hong Kong
interbank offered rate, the person said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
