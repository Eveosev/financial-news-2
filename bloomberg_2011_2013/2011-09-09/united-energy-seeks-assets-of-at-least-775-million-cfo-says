United Energy Group Ltd. (467) , a Hong
Kong-based oil and gas explorer, said it aims to acquire assets
valued no less than the $775 million it agreed to pay BP Plc for
fields in Pakistan.  “We are unwilling to buy anything that’s below the size of
the BP assets,” Chief Financial Officer Thomas Pang told
reporters in Hong Kong today.  The BP deal in December gave United Energy its first assets
in Pakistan as the company controlled by billionaire Zhang
Hongwei expands overseas to meet demand in the world’s fastest-
growing major economy. The explorer, which owns assets in China
and Indonesia, said Dec. 18 it got a $5 billion  loan  from state-
owned  China  Development Bank Corp. to fund future acquisitions.  With support from China’s biggest overseas lender, United
Energy is looking at “a number of very good opportunities” and
would pay for assets in cash, Executive Director Leo Kirby said
without giving details.  While United Energy’s search is “truly global,” the
company will avoid investing in  Russia , as well as Iran, Sudan
and  North Korea , as the three countries face international trade
sanctions, Kirby told reporters.  United Energy has fallen 46 percent in Hong Kong trading
this year, compared with the 14 percent decline in the benchmark
Hang Seng Index. The stock rose 1.2 percent to close at 83 Hong
Kong cents today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
