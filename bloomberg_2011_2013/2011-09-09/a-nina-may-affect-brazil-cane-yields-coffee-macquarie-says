The return of La Nina weather
conditions may hurt coffee flowering and sugar-cane yields in
 Brazil , the world’s largest producer of both commodities,
according to Macquarie Group Ltd.  La Nina conditions are back and will strengthen and persist
into the Northern Hemisphere’s 2011-12 winter, the U.S. National
Weather Service said in an advisory posted on its website
yesterday.  “There are concerns that dryness in Brazil caused by La
Nina may affect the coffee flowering before next year’s crop,”
 Kona Haque , a London-based analyst at Macquarie, said by e-mail
today. “For sugar, if the La Nina strengthens, it may
exacerbate the poor cane yields for both the remainder of this
season as well as next season.”  Coffee trees usually flower in September, and rains are
needed to induce blossoming, Margarete Boteon, an analyst at
University of Sao Paulo research group Cepea, said in a report
dated Sept. 6. Cane production in Center South, Brazil’s main
producing area, will fall for the first time in a decade after
dry weather last year hurt yields, along with frost and
flowering this year, according to industry group Unica.  In West Africa, where La Nina helped boost cocoa crops in
the 2010-11 season, “no immediate discernable impact” is
expected, Haque said.  La Nina conditions, when the equatorial  Pacific Ocean 
remains cooler than normal, tend to cause winter temperatures
that are higher than normal in the U.S. Southeast and cooler
than normal in the Northwest, the weather service said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
