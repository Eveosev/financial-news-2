Federal Reserve Bank of  San
Francisco  President John C. Williams said the worldwide
financial system is under severe “stress” and regulators need
to restore public confidence in their ability to contain crises.  “The challenge we now face is to make sure the global
financial system is strong enough to weather periods of extreme
stress and volatility,” the regional bank chief said today in
prepared remarks delivered at a symposium in San Francisco. He
didn’t address the path of future policy for the Fed.  Regulators are grappling with the best way to set new
 capital requirements  for the largest, most interconnected
financial institutions. The challenge is to create standards
“high enough to ensure that failure is extremely unlikely,”
while giving banks enough leverage to achieve reasonable
shareholder returns, Williams said.  “The global financial system is experiencing great stress
as it adapts to the new, post-crisis rules of the game,”
Williams, 49, said at the conference held at the bank on Asian
banking and finance. “On both the public and private-sector
side, we have much work to do to restore confidence in the
financial system and reassure the public that financial crises
can be contained.”  Williams, who has worked in the Fed system since 1994, was
a senior economist for the  Council of Economic Advisers  during
the Clinton administration. The Sacramento native succeeded
 Janet Yellen , now the Fed board’s vice chairman, and will become
a voting member of the rate-setting FOMC next year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
