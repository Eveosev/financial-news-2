Safaricom Ltd. (SAFCOM)  may increase mobile-
phone call tariffs to offset increased operating costs, Business
Daily reported, citing Chief Executive Officer Bob Collymore.  A 27 percent increase in the cost of running diesel-
generated base stations since January and the shilling’s decline
against world currencies were the main drivers of higher
operating costs, the Nairobi-based newspaper said.  Safaricom would be the first mobile-phone company to
increase tariffs in the industry’s 11-year history in  Kenya , the
newspaper said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
