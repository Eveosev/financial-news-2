The following companies had unusual
price changes in Mexico trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of 4:45 p.m. New York time.  The IPC index fell 2.6 percent to 33,812.62.  Grupo Elektra SA (ELEKTRA* MM), the retail and banking
company controlled by billionaire  Ricardo Salinas , dropped 6.5
percent, its largest decline in two weeks, to 1,103.22 pesos
amid concern the  U.S. Congress  won’t pass President  Barack Obama ’s $447 billion plan to boost the economy.  Cemex SAB (CEMEXCPO MM), the largest cement maker in the
Americas, retreated 4.2 percent, its biggest decline in three
weeks, to 6.32 pesos on concern U.S. growth will remain weak and
 Europe ’s financial crisis may be worsening, said Gerardo Roman,
a trader with Mexico City-based Corp. Actinver SAB, in a
telephone interview. U.S. sales accounted for about 18 percent
of Cemex’s 2010 revenue while Europe comprised around 34 percent
of the northern Mexico-based company’s revenue last year.  Compartamos SAB (COMPARC* MM), the holding company that
controls microlender Banco Compartamos, slid 5.4 percent to 18
pesos, its lowest price in a month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
