Oil options volatility increased as
the underlying futures tumbled the most in a week after the euro
dropped against the dollar on concern that  Greece â€™s
deteriorating debt crisis will lead to a default.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
November, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a
gauge of options prices, was 44.2 percent at 3 p.m. in  New York ,
up from 40.6 percent yesterday and 39.5 percent a week ago.  Oil for October delivery dropped $1.81, or 2 percent, to
settle at $87.24 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange ,
the biggest one-day decline since Sept. 2. Prices have fallen
4.5 percent this year and rose 0.9 percent this week.  The most active contract in electronic trading today was
October $80 puts, with 4,674 lots changing hands. The options
gained 8 cents to 41 cents a barrel. October $75 puts, the next-
most active contract, edged up 1 cent to 15 cents a barrel with
2,532 lots trading. One contract covers 1,000 barrels of crude.  October options expire Sept. 15.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information on floor trading, where the
bulk of options trading occur the next business day.  October $85 puts were the most active options traded in the
previous session, with 7,754 lots changing hands. They rose 8
cents to 92 cents a barrel. The next-most-active options,
December $105 calls, advanced 3 cents to $1.15 a barrel on
volume of 5,871.  Open interest was highest for December $100 calls with
50,545 contracts. Next were December $70 puts with 46,008 and
December $120 calls with 43,356.  To contact the reporter on this story:
