The Indonesian government increased
the amount of coal that producers must set aside in 2012 to meet
domestic demand by 4 percent from this year.  The producers’ domestic market obligation was raised to
82.07 million metric tons, or 25 percent of the country’s
estimated output of 332 million tons in 2012, according to a
 decree  signed by Energy and Mineral Resources Minister Darwin Saleh on Aug. 25 and published on the ministry’s website today.
The obligation this year is 78.97 million tons, the ministry
said on Oct. 4.  Indonesia is boosting the use of coal as crude oil output
declines because of aging fields.  Southeast Asia ’s biggest
economy is adding 20 gigawatts of power capacity by 2014, of
which 70 percent will use coal as fuel, Saleh said on May 30.  PT Perusahaan Listrik Negara, the state utility, will need
57.2 million tons of coal with gross heating value of between
4,000 and 5,200 kilocalories per kilogram next year, or about 70
percent of the total allocation, according to the decree.  Private power generators will take 10.8 million tons, while
cement producers will use 8.4 million tons.  PT Arutmin Indonesia and PT Kaltim Prima Coal, units of the
country’s biggest producer PT Bumi Resources, will set aside a
total of 19.3 million tons, according to the decree.  PT Adaro  Indonesia , the mining unit of PT Adaro Energy, and
PT Kideco Jaya Agung, will allocate 11.7 million tons and 8.03
million tons, respectively. Adaro and Kideco are the country’s
second and third-largest producers of the fuel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
