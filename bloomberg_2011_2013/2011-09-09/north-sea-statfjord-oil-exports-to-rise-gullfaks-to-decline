Daily exports of North Sea Statfjord
crude oil will increase by 35 percent in October from September,
while Gullfaks shipments will decline by 12 percent, according
to loading programs obtained by Bloomberg News.  The Statfjord program for October comprises seven 855,000-
barrel cargoes, totaling 5.985 million barrels, or 193,065
barrels a day, the plans showed. This compares with 142,500
barrels a day this month.  Exports of Gullfaks will be four cargoes of 855,000 barrels
each, according to the plan. It amounts to 3.42 million barrels,
or 110,323 barrels a day, compared with 125,000 barrels a day
this month.  Grane exports for October will total 3.6 million barrels,
or 116,129 barrels a day, the schedules showed. No cargoes were
exported this month due to planned maintenance.  Statoil ASA (STL) ,  Norway â€™s largest oil and gas producer,
operates the three fields.  Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude shipments
compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan
their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
