Colombia’s peso bonds gained,
sending benchmark yields to record lows, amid lower inflation
expectations and as investors speculated the central bank will
leave  interest rates  unchanged.  The yield on Colombia’s 10 percent bonds due in July 2024
fell two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 7.16 percent
at 10:48 a.m. New York time. The bond’s price rose 0.189 centavo
to 123.292 centavos per peso.  Yields on the benchmark bond due July 2024 have fallen
eight basis points since a Sept. 5 government report showed
consumer prices fell 0.03 percent in August from the previous
month, compared to the median estimate for a 0.13 percent
increase in a Bloomberg survey.  “Bonds have had a big rally and there is still room for
gains,” said Marisol Torres, an analyst at Bogota-based Helm
Bank SA. “The surprising inflation number and concern a global
recession is imminent is leading to bets the central bank will
remain on hold at least this month.” She expects the yield on
the security due July 2024 to fall to 7.10 percent in September.  Banco de la Republica last month unexpectedly left its
overnight lending rate unchanged at 4.5 percent on concern that
global market turmoil may hurt growth in the South American
country. The central bank’s next monetary policy meeting is
scheduled for Sept. 30.  Peso Declines  Colombia ’s peso fell, following declines in global
equities, after President Barack Obama’s plan to boost jobs
failed to bolster confidence and concern about  Greece ’s debt
crisis escalated.  The peso dropped 0.3 percent to 1,793.81 per dollar, from
1,788.50 yesterday. The currency is down 0.6 percent so far this
week.  Obama yesterday detailed a $447 billion plan to boost
hiring and called on Congress to pass his package after job
growth stalled last month in the U.S., fueling concern the
recovery in the world’s biggest economy is faltering. European
Central Bank President  Jean-Claude Trichet  said yesterday that
“downside risks” for the region’s economies have risen and
U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  stopped short of
providing details on new plans to boost growth.  To contact the reporter on this story:
