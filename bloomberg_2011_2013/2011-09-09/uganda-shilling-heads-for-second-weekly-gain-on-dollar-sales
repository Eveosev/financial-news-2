Uganda ’s shilling headed for its
second weekly increase as banks sold dollars to meet local-
currency requirements for their customers.  The currency of  East Africa ’s third-biggest economy
appreciated 0.8 percent to 2,770 per dollar by 3:13 p.m. in the
capital, Kampala, extending its advance this week to 1.6
percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The five-day
increase makes it the best performer worldwide over the period.  “The gains of the shilling are driven by interbank selling
of the dollar to cater for local shilling demands by
companies,” Timothy Muzoora, a currency trader at Cairo
International Bank Ltd., said by phone from Kampala. “It won’t
be a surprise to see the shilling depreciating after this brief
gain because of low dollar inflows.”  The shilling has slumped 1.6 percent this year against the
dollar, making it the world’s worst-performing currency after
Suriname’s dollar and Maldives’ rufiyaa, which fell 16.8 and
16.9 percent respectively.  A surge in food and fuel prices pushed inflation to a more
than 18-year high of 21.4 percent in August from 18.8 percent in
July, the Uganda Bureau of Statistics said on Aug. 31.  To contact the reporter on this story:
