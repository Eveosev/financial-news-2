Belgium , which has been without a
full-time government for 15 months, faces slower economic growth
next year that will compound its difficulty in meeting a budget-
deficit reduction target even as borrowing costs soar.  The Federal Planning Bureau cut its 2012 growth forecast to
1.6 percent from 2.2 percent, the agency said on its  website 
today. That may swell a deficit that the bureau earlier
projected to reach 16.9 billion euros ($23.2 billion) next year.  The Brussels-based L’Echo newspaper  reported  today that
Belgium’s budget gap will widen to 17.7 billion euros under the
lower growth forecast and leave the government 6.9 billion euros
short of reaching its goal of trimming the deficit to 2.8
percent of gross domestic product in 2012.  In cutting its forecast, the bureau followed Belgium’s
biggest banks, which last month lowered their projection to 1.6
percent, De Tijd reported on Aug. 9, citing a survey of Dexia
SA, KBC Groep NV, ING Groep NV and BNP Paribas Fortis.  The  National Bank of Belgium  today left its 2.2 percent
growth forecast for 2012 unchanged.  The planning bureau raised its 2011 growth forecast to 2.4
percent from 2.2 percent. The central bank retained its 2.6
percent projection.  To contact the reported on this story:
