Canadian stocks fell for a third
day as financial companies dropped amid intensifying concern
that Greece may default while mining companies slumped after the
 U.S. dollar  touched the highest level since February.  Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD) ,  Canada ’s second-largest lender by
assets, declined 2.1 percent as Greek two-year bond yields
surged above 69 percent.  Goldcorp Inc. (G) , the world’s second-
biggest gold producer by market value, decreased 4.3 percent as
the metal slipped.  Suncor Energy Inc. (SU) , Canada’s largest oil and
gas producer, lost 3.2 percent after an analyst at Bank of
Montreal cut his rating on the company.  The Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index retreated 238.71
points, or 1.9 percent, to a three-week low of 12,148.83 after
falling 2.3 percent on Sept. 9. The index last dropped at least
238 points on consecutive days in November 2008.  “It could lead to not only a big crisis for banks over
there but also a potential crisis for  North America , because of
the interconnectedness of all of the financial institutions
around the world,” Brian Huen, a managing partner at Red Sky
Capital Management Ltd. in Toronto, said in a telephone
interview. The firm oversees C$52.5 million ($52.7 million).
“If  Greece  goes down, it’s not going to be one domino falling.
There’s a lot of dominoes falling behind it.”  The S&P/TSX has slumped 15 percent since April 5 as the
European debt crisis worsened. On Sept. 9, three officials with
German Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s coalition said the government
is preparing plans to shore up banks in the event that Greece
defaults. The officials declined to be named because the
deliberations are private.  French Banks  Moody’s Investors Service may cut the ratings of BNP
Paribas SA, Societe Generale SA and Credit Agricole SA this week
because of their Greek holdings, two people with knowledge of
the matter said. The people declined to be identified because
the matter is confidential.  All eight S&P/TSX banks dropped. TD lost 2.1 percent to
C$72.65.  Royal Bank of Canada (RY) , its larger domestic rival,
decreased 2.7 percent to C$46.20 after closing at a two-year low
Sept. 9.  Manulife Financial Corp. (MFC) , North America’s fourth-
biggest insurer, retreated 2.4 percent to C$12.02 as the S&P/TSX
Insurance Index fell from the lowest close since April 2009.  Dundee Corp. (DC/A) , Ned Goodman’s holding company, rallied 9
percent, the most since November, to C$22.51 after saying it
will buy back up to 10 million shares at C$23.75 a share.  Gold, Silver  Gold and silver futures fell as retreating world equity
markets forced some investors to sell commodities to cover
losses.  “You can’t buy groceries with gold,”  Barry Schwartz , a
 money manager  at Baskin Financial Services Inc., said in a
telephone interview. The firm oversees C$420 million. “If you
think things are going to get worse, you’re going to liquidate
all your assets.”  The S&P/TSX Materials Index retreated the most since Aug.
4. Goldcorp dropped 4.3 percent to C$52.55.  Barrick Gold Corp. (ABX) ,
the world’s largest producer of the metal, slipped 2.8 percent
to C$52.87.  China Gold International Resources Corp Ltd. (CGG)  sank 14
percent to C$4.25.  First Majestic Silver Corp. (FR) , which operates in  Mexico ,

 Latin America , slumped 9.6 percent to C$26.57.  Silvercorp Metals
Inc. (SVM) , which operates in  China , declined 7.3 percent to C$7.78

dropped 5.2 percent to C$19.72, extending its three-day tumble
to 15 percent.  Downgrades  Suncor and  Canadian Natural Resources Ltd. (CNQ)  declined after
Randy J. Ollenberger, an analyst at BMO, reduced his ratings on
the shares to “market perform” from “outperform.” In notes
to clients, Ollenberger said crude prices may fall due to the
“uncertain economic environment.”  Suncor lost 3.2 percent to C$28.51, the lowest close since
March 2009. Canadian Natural decreased 1.8 percent to C$33.53.
 Trican Well Service Ltd. (TCW) , the country’s largest oilfield-
services company, retreated 5.9 percent to C$18.56 after Alan Laws, another analyst at BMO, cut his rating on Trican’s
industry to “market perform.”  Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan Inc., the world’s biggest
fertilizer producer by market value, fell 2 percent to C$55.96
after the U.S. cut its corn-stocks forecast by less than most
analysts in a Bloomberg survey had estimated.  To contact the reporter on this story:
