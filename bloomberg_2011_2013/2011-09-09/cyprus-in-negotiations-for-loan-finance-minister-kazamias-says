Cyprus is in negotiations for a loan
of an unspecified amount to repay maturing debt and finance the
 budget deficit , Cypriot Finance Minister Kikis Kazamias said.  “Consultations continue and they are not directed in just
one direction,” Kazamias told reporters in Nicosia today. “If
we find something that is in our interest we are obliged to take
advantage of it. A possible deal will not alter the government’s
fiscal-consolidation plans.”  Kazamias declined to specify whether Cyprus is negotiating
with the Russian government, a bank or some other foreign
organization. “All three possibilities are open,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
