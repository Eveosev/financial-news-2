Canadian  labor productivity  fell at
the fastest pace in five years between April and June, with
companies increasing hours worked as production declined,
government figures showed.  Productivity fell 0.9 percent in the second quarter as
business output decreased 0.3 percent and hours worked rose 0.6
percent, Statistics Canada said today in Ottawa. Economists
predicted the measure would fall 0.7 percent, based on the
median of 11 estimates in a Bloomberg survey.  “The decline comes against a backdrop of temporary factors
which affected output more than labor, including wildfires in
Northern Alberta and tsunami in  Japan ,” the report said.  Productivity is a measure of how much an employee produces
in an hour of work, and lower efficiency limits how fast the
economy can grow without sparking inflation. Bank of Canada
Governor  Mark Carney  has said companies need to use a rising
currency to boost investment and regain competitiveness.  Unit labor costs rose 0.9 percent in the second quarter,
 Statistics Canada ’s report said.  Measured in U.S. dollars, unit labor costs rose 2.8
percent.  Labor productivity was 0.3 percent higher in the second
quarter than the same period a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
