Nigerian stocks fell for a second
straight day, extending the longest run of weekly losses since
2008, as oil declined and concern deepened the global economic
recovery is faltering.  The Nigerian Stock Exchange All-Share Index, which tracks
the performance of 198 shares in  Africa ’s biggest oil producer,
tumbled 1.2 percent to 21,104.1 by the 2:30 p.m. close in Lagos,
according to a statement on the bourse’s website. The gauge has
dropped 2.3 percent this week, the seventh straight decline and
the longest slump since a nine-week rout ended Nov. 7, 2008,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Emerging-market stocks retreated after U.S. President
Barack Obama’s $447 billion jobs plan failed to ease concern
that the global economy is slowing. European Central Bank
President Jean-Claude Trichet said yesterday “downside risks”
for the region’s economies have risen.  Global  risk aversion  is causing investors to shun Nigerian
equities, Bunmi Asaolu, head of equity research at FBN Capital
Ltd., said in e-mailed comments today.  Oil dropped 2.4 percent, the most in a week, to $86.95 a
barrel in  New York .  Dangote Cement Plc (DANGCEM) , Nigeria’s largest company by market
value, slid 2.9 percent.  Dangote Sugar Refinery Plc (DANGSUGA) , Nigeria’s biggest producer of
the sweetener by market value, fell for the first time in three
days after Vetiva Capital Ltd. cut its recommendation to
“neutral” from “accumulate.” The stock lost 10 kobo, or 1
percent, to 9.5 naira.  To contact the reporter on this story:
