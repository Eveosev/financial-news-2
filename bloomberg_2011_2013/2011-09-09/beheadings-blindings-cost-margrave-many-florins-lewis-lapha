After his father ran up huge debts,
German Margrave Casimir forced him to abdicate and took over. He
put the creditors in charge of running Brandenburg-Bayreuth, and
they began squeezing the peasants, many of whom soon became
hopelessly indebted themselves.  (To listen to the podcast, click  here .)  In 1525, riots broke out and bands of armed villagers began
to loot castles, cathedrals and monasteries. Unable to raise an
army, Casimir hired mercenaries, who swept across his realm
killing women and children and pillaging towns.  After the uprising was put down, Casimir received an
itemized bill for the help: 80 beheaded, 69 eyes put out and
fingers cut off costing a grand total of 114 1/2 florins.  I spoke with David Graeber, author of “Debt: The First
5,000 Years,” on the following topics:  1. First Credit, Then Barter  2. Military Cash Markets  3. Debt and Morality  4. Human vs. Market Economics  5. The Scourge of Debt  To buy this book in  North America , click  here .  ( Lewis Lapham  is the founder of  Lapham’s Quarterly  and the
