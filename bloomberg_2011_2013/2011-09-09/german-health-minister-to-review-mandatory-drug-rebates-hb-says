German Health Minister Daniel Bahr
will review whether the mandatory discounts the government
requires from drug companies for innovative medicines should
continue until 2013 as planned,  Handelsblatt  reports, citing a
spokesman for the ministerâ€™s office.  The government wants to wait until a budget forecast for
the public health insurers for 2012 has been completed before
making a decision on the rebates, the newspaper said. The review
comes after a pharmaceutical industry group claimed the rebates
should be abolished after German drug spending declined and
public health insurers had a surplus of 2.4 billion euros ($3.3
billion) during the first half of the year, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
