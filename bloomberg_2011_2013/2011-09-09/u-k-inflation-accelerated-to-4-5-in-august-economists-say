U.K. inflation probably accelerated
in August as companies passed on rising raw material prices such
as oil and wheat to consumers.  Consumer prices rose an annual 4.5 percent, up from 4.4
percent in July, according to the median estimate of 34
economists in a Bloomberg News survey. The  Office for National
Statistics  will publish the data at 9:30 a.m. in  London  on Sept.
13.  Price gains are accelerating as companies such as Iberdrola
SA-owned Scottish Power pass along higher commodity costs to
consumers. The Bank of England held its benchmark interest rate
at a record-low 0.5 percent yesterday and bond-purchase plan at
200 billion pounds ($320 billion) to stoke the recovery even as
inflation remains at more than double its 2 percent target.  “Energy and food prices are pushing up inflation this
month,” said  Alan Clarke , an economist at Scotia Capital Europe
Ltd. in London. “We’ll get to just above 5 percent this year
and then down to close to 2 percent next year. We see no rate
hike until 2013.”  The  Bank of England ’s key rate has been set at 0.5 percent
since March 2009. Investors don’t expect an increase until at
least the second half of 2012, data from Tullett Prebon Plc on
forward contracts for the sterling overnight interbank average
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
