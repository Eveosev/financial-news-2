STX Pan Ocean Co.,  South Korea â€™s
largest commodities shipping company, got a $510 million loan
from Export-Import Bank of Korea and eight overseas lenders to
pay for some of the vessels it ordered.  The shipping line signed the deal today with Export-Import
Bank,  China  Development Bank Corp., ABN Amro Bank NV, DnB NOR
Bank ASA, Deutsche Schiffsbank AG, BNP Paribas SA, ING Bank NV,
Standard Chartered Bank Plc and Credit Industriel et Commercial,
STX Pan Ocean said in an e-mailed statement.  The funds will be used to pay for 16 of the 20 vessels it
will deploy for service starting next year under a 25-year
contract with  Fibria Celulose SA (FIBR3)  of Brazil, which STX Pan Ocean
says may generate $5 billion in sales. The company said it
expects to secure financing for the remaining ships.  STX Pan Ocean awarded a $912 million contract to STX
Offshore & Shipbuilding Co. in December to build 20 57,000-
deadweight vessels at its yards in Jinhae, South  Korea  and
Dalian in China.  Shares of STX Pan Ocean dropped 2.7 percent to 8,650 won as
of 1:01 p.m. in Seoul. The stock has lost 24 percent this year,
compared with an 11 percent decline in the benchmark Kospi
Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
