NewPage Corp., the Cerberus Capital
Management LP-owned coated paper maker that filed for  bankruptcy
protection , reduced the rate it will pay on a $250 million
debtor-in-possession  term loan , according to a person with
knowledge of the matter.  The company will pay seven percentage points more than the
London interbank offered rate and the lending benchmark will
have a 1.5 percent floor, said the person, who declined to be
identified because the terms are private. NewPage initially
proposed to pay 7.5 percentage points more than Libor on the
debt, according to court documents.  NewPage may sell the piece at 99 cents on the dollar,
reducing proceeds for the borrower and boosting the yield for
investors, the person said.  Lenders must let JPMorgan Chase & Co., Barclays Plc, and
 Wells Fargo & Co ., the banks arranging the financing, know by
Sept. 19 if they will participate in the deal, the person said.  Shawn Hall , a NewPage spokeswoman, didn’t immediately
return a phone call seeking comment.  NewPage, based in Miamisburg, Ohio, is also seeking a $350
million asset-backed revolver as part of the $600 million
bankruptcy financing.  The company yesterday was granted interim approval by the
 U.S. Bankruptcy Court  for the District of Delaware for the debt
facilities, which will provide the company with liquidity to
continue to operate during the restructuring.  To contact the reporter on this story:
