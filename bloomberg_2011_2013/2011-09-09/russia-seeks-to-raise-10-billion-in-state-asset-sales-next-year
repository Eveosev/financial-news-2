Russia plans to raise 300 billion
rubles ($10 billion) next year by selling stakes in state
companies such as OAO Rosneft, the country’s biggest oil
producer, and VTB Group, its second-biggest lender, a government
official said.  The government may sell 15 percent of Rosneft for more than
200 billion rubles and 10 percent of VTB for at least the price
it sold a stake for this year, Alexei Uvarov, director of the
Economy Ministry’s property department, told reporters today in
Moscow.  The target price for the Rosneft stake would mean a 44
percent discount to its current value. A 15 percent of the  oil
company  is worth 357 billion rubles based on a share price of
224.85 rubles at 4:43 p.m. in Moscow. A 10th of VTB is valued at
79.4 billion rubles at today’s share price of 7.6 kopeks.  Russia aims to raise a total of 1.16 trillion rubles from
state asset sales between 2012 and 2014, Uvarov said. The
forecast is “conservative,” taking into account the current
volatility in financial markets, he said. The target assumes
asset-sales revenue of 380 billion rubles in 2013 and 475
billion rubles in 2014, he said.  Russia may offer a 25 percent stake in energy shipper OAO
Sovcomflot this December, should market conditions be favorable,
Uvarov said. Shares in OAO Federal Grid Co. and OAO RusHydro may
also be sold next year, according to Uvarov.  The three-year plan also includes holdings in oil-pipeline
monopoly OAO Transneft, diamond-miner OAO Alrosa, Russian
Agricultural Bank, a lender to farms and food producers, United
Shipbuilding Co., power generator OAO Inter RAO UES, OAO Russian
Railways, United Grain Co. and oil producer OAO Zarubezhneft,
according to the  Economy Ministry .  To contact the reporter on this story:
