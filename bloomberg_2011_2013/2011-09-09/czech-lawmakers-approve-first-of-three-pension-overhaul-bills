The Czech lower house of parliament
today approved bills aimed at overhauling the pension system and
boosting private savings for retirement, a part of the
government’s plan to curb future public-finance deficits.  The legislation, which now goes to the upper house, the
Senate, will allow people to redirect part of compulsory pension
payments into personal accounts managed by pension funds from
2013. Plans including an overhaul of the deficit-making pay-as-
you-go pension system and a reduction of the budget gap helped
Czech bonds outperform debt of other eastern  European Union
members  in the past year.  Premier Petr Necas, who last year assembled the largest
majority in the lower house since independence in 1993, pledged
to cut the public-finance shortfall to less than the EU limit of
3 percent of gross domestic product, calling the overhaul of the
pension and health-care systems the key goals for his Cabinet.
The government plans to narrow the gap to 3.5 percent in 2012
from the planned 4.2 percent in 2011.  The  Social Democrats , the largest opposition party that
holds a majority in the Senate, rejected the pension changes.
The three-party ruling coalition has a majority in the lower
house to override Senate vetoes.  While the deficits of the pension system wouldn’t exceed 1
percent of GDP in the next 20 years without “substantial
changes,” they may eventually reach about 4 percent without an
overhaul, the government said in a document accompanying the
bills.  To contact the reporter on this story:
