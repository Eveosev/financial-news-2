Universal Corp.’s Italian unit
Deltafina and  Alliance One International Inc. (AOI)  lost European
Union court appeals against antitrust fines totaling 54 million
euros ($75 million) for colluding on prices they paid tobacco
growers.  The  EU General Court , the 27-nation region’s second-highest
tribunal, ruled today that the penalties were valid.  The European Commission, the EU’s antitrust regulator,
fined four companies, including two Alliance One units, 56
million euros for unlawfully rigging prices for more than six
years in a cartel that ended in 2002. Deltafina was fined 30
million euros while Alliance One was held jointly liable with
its two units for a 24 million-euro penalty.  The ruling follows decisions by the court in a similar case
concerning the Spanish market last year in which Deltafina  won  a
reduction in an 11.9 million-euro antitrust fine for fixing the
prices it paid Spanish growers for tobacco. Alliance One last
October lost an appeal over its fine in the cartel.  Spokespeople for the companies in the U.S. didn’t
immediately respond to calls outside normal office hours.  The cases are: T-12/06, Deltafina v. European Commission;
T-25/06, Alliance One v. European Commission.  To contact the reporter on this story:
