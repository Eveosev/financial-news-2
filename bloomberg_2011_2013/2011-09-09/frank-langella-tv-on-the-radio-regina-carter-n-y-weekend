Rock anthemist Ian Hunter helped
launch Mott the Hoople at the end of the 1960s and had gone solo
by 1975. He brings his pithy, cosmic and reliably literate
sensibility (and trademark wild hair) to City Winery, where, as
the name implies, the wine list is as seriously considered as
the guest artists.  Downtown at 155 Varick St. Information: +1-212-608-0555;
 http://citywinery.com .  Emily Bergl  Or perhaps some standards instead? Consider Emily Bergl’s
“Kidding on the Square,” at the  Oak Room .  Poured into a slinky silver gown that eventually gives way
to, well, not much, the actress breezily moves from  Noel
Coward ’s “Mad About the Boy” to  Peter Brown  and Robert Rans’s
“Material Girl.” Highlights include Dave Frishberg’s “Peel Me
a Grape” and Lieber and Stoller’s killer Sprechstimme for Peggy
Lee, “Is That All There Is?” Best augmented by a dry  Manhattan 
-- or two.  Algonquin Hotel, 59 W. 44th St. Information: +1-212-419-
9331;  http://www.algonquinhotel.com .  Saturday  Frank Langella  plays a financier on the brink of bankruptcy
in “Man and Boy,” beginning Broadway previews this weekend at
the American Airlines Theatre. Though the plot suggests it’s
been ripped from the headlines, the playwright (Terence
Rattigan) and the time (1963) say otherwise. The  Roundabout
Theatre Company  revival is staged by Maria Aitken.  AT 227 W. 42nd St. Information: +1-212-719-1300;
 http://www.roundabouttheatre.org .  ‘In Performance’  Many of the city’s bedrock performing arts institutions are
commemorating the 10th anniversary of 9/11. The Joyce Theatre
Foundation has organized a dance program that includes the
mesmerizing  Alvin Ailey  dancer Matthew Rushing in “A Song for
You.” The  Limon Dance Company  offers the 1958 “Missa Brevis”
and  Paul Taylor ’s troupe will present “Brandenburgs.”  Starting at 5 p.m., Rockefeller Park, River Terrace at
Warren St. Information: +1-212-691-9740;  http://www.bpcparks.org   ‘Concert for New York’  The  New York Philharmonic ’s free Concert for New York
features music director  Alan Gilbert  conducting Mahler’s epic
Symphony No. 2, “Resurrection.” The concert is tonight at
 Avery Fisher Hall . On Sunday, it will be telecast around the
world (locally on PBS).  Lincoln Center , Broadway at West 66th Street. Information:
+1-212-875-5656;  http://www.nyphil.org .  Later, head downtown to hear the seductive jazz violinist
Regina Carter play with her Reverse Thread quintet.  At the  Blue Note , 131 W. 3rd St. Information: +1-212-475-
8592;  http://www.bluenote.net .  Sunday  Don’t pass up the rare chance to hear folkie Pete Seeger
and friends at “Love Wins: An Afternoon of Music, Stories, and
Film.” The 9/11 commemorative concert, organized by Gardens of
Forgiveness, will run from 2 p.m. to 4:30 p.m. at the New York
University Rosenthal Pavilion, Kimmel Center, 60 Washington
Square South. Information:  http://gof91111.eventbrite.com   Close the weekend with  Fiasco , the loose-limbed, tight-knit
theater troupe of ex-Brown University students. Their charming
production of Shakespeare’s loopy romance “Cymbeline” has
begun a long residence at  Greenwich Village ’s Barrow Street
Theatre, courtesy of  Theatre for a New Audience .  The six actors play all the roles in this tale about an
evil step-mother queen, a faithful princess and her exiled
husband, not to mention a pair of brothers presumed dead, a
cretinous suitor and a couple dozen completely ridiculous
revelations as the curtain falls (if there were a curtain).  Adding to the maximalist wit (most of it, aptly, of the
collegiate variety) and minimalist economy (the entire set
comprises two cubes and a steamer trunk) is the resonant
original music, written and beautifully performed by the
company.  27 Barrow Street at Seventh Avenue. Information: +1-212-
