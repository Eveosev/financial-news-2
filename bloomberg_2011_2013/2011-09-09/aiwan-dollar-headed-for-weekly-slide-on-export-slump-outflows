Taiwan ’s dollar was set for its
biggest weekly loss in more than two months as a slowing global
recovery hurt exports and cooled demand for emerging-market
assets.  Government bonds  advanced.  Overseas sales rose 7.2 percent in August from a year
earlier, the least since they last declined in October 2009, the
Ministry of Finance reported yesterday shortly before the close
of trading in the local  currency market . Economists expected a
15.5 percent increase, a Bloomberg survey showed. Global funds
sold $1.2 billion more Taiwanese shares than they bought in the
last four days, bringing net sales for the year to $8.8 billion,
according to exchange data.  “Taiwan’s dollar has been weak because foreign investors
sold the currency,” said Tarsicio Tong, a Taipei-based currency
trader at Union Bank of Taiwan. Demand for the U.S. currency is
“relatively strong” as global recovery concerns are mounting,
he said.  Taiwan’s dollar fell 0.6 percent this week to NT$29.19
versus its U.S. counterpart as of 10:06 a.m. local time, the
biggest weekly decline since June, according to Taipei Forex Inc.
It touched NT$29.21 earlier, the weakest level since April 6.
The currency slipped 0.14 percent today.  The yield on the 1.25 percent bonds due September 2021, the
re-issued benchmark 10-year debt and most-traded  government
securities , fell 1.4 basis points to 1.30 percent today, prices
from Gretai Securities Market show. No trading details were
available for prior dates.  The overnight money-market rate, which measures interbank
funding availability, was steady at 0.388 percent, according to
a weighted average compiled by the Taiwan Interbank Money Center.
It declined 0.6 basis point during the five-day period.  Taiwan’s central bank last boosted its benchmark rate on
June 30 by 12.5 basis points to 1.875 percent. The policy board
is due to meet again on Sept. 29.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
