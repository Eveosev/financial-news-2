Record earthquake losses following
the temblors in Japan and  New Zealand  may make 2011 the second-
costliest year in history for insured catastrophe losses,
according to Swiss Re Ltd.  Total insured losses from natural catastrophes and man-made
disasters reached about $70 billion in the first half of this
year, more than double the losses in the same period in 2010,
according to estimates by the Zurich-based reinsurer.  The figure was only surpassed in 2005 after hurricanes
Katrina, Wilma and Rita caused claims of more than $90 billion,
the world’s second-biggest reinsurer said. Catastrophe claims
usually increase in the second half of the year with the
hurricane season in the North Atlantic and typhoons in the
northwest Pacific.  “Additional claims from the ongoing U.S.  hurricane season 
or expensive winter storms in  Europe  have the potential to bring
figures for the full year even closer to the record claims” of
2005, Thomas Hess, Swiss Re’s chief economist, said in an e-
mailed statement.  Hurricane Irene, which made landfall Aug. 27 as a Category
1 hurricane in North Carolina before striking  New York  the next
day as a tropical storm, may result in insured damages of up to
$6.6 billion, Aon Benfield, the world’s biggest reinsurance
broker, said yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
