Siemens AG (SIE) ,  Europe ’s largest
engineering company, said its delayed high-speed train order to
Deutsche Bahn AG has been given "absolute priority" after a
meeting with German Transport Minister Peter Ramsauer yesterday.  “We very much regret the delivery delays of the new Inter
City Express and are working hard on the project," Hans-Joerg Grundmann, head of Siemens’s mobility division said in an e-
mailed statement last night. ‘‘All 2,000 workers at our factory
in Krefeld know that this has absolute priority.’’  Germany ’s VDB rail industry association yesterday called
for the Federal Rail Authority, EBA, to improve its licensing
process. Specifications are sometimes changed during train
construction and licensing stops can be imposed, which leads to
delays and losses for train operators and makers, the
association said in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
