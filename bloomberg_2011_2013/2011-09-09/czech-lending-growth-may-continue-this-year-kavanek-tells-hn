Lending growth in the  Czech Republic 
may continue in the second half of the year at a “moderate”
pace, Pavel Kavanek, the chief executive officer of
Ceskoslovenska Obchodni Banka AS, told  Hospodarske Noviny .  The Czech unit of  KBC Groep NV (KBC)  aims to continue to outpace
the market growth in lending to small and medium-sized companies
this year, he said in the interview. CSOB has a “huge”
appetite to increase its market share, Kavanek said.  KBC realized that CSOB is “too good” to be sold when the
Belgian lender scrapped an initial public offering of a stake in
its Czech banking unit in July and chose to sell its Polish
business instead, Kavanek told Hospodarske.  To contact the reporter on this story:
