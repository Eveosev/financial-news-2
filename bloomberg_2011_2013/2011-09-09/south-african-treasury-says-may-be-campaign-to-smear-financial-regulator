South Africa ’s National Treasury
said there may be a campaign to “deliberately and publicly
smear” the country’s Financial Services Board.  “The National Treasury rejects the accusations and
insinuations made against the integrity of the executive officer
of the FSB and the FSB,” the Pretoria-based ministry said in an
e-mailed statement today.  The Treasury was referring to allegations made by
individuals facing fraud charges.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
