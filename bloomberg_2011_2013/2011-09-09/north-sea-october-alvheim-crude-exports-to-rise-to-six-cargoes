Exports of  North Sea  Alvheim crude
for October are scheduled at six cargoes, two more than this
month, a loading program obtained by Bloomberg News showed.  The October program comprises six 780,000-barrel shipments,
including one for loading from the end of September to early
October, the plan showed. This amounts to 4.68 million barrels,
or 150,968 barrels a day, compared with 104,000 barrels a day
this month, according to the plan. Houston-based Marathon Oil
Corp. operates the  field  in the Norwegian North Sea.  Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude shipments
compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan
their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
