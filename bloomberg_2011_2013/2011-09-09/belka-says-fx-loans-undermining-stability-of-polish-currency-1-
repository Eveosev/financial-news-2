The Polish zloty’s stability is
being undermined by lending in foreign currencies and the
central bank will “do everything” it can to lessen the risk
poised by foreign-exchange lending by domestic banks, central
bank Governor Marek Belka said.  “Foreign-exchange lending is one of the most destabilizing
factors in the economy,” Belka said during a panel discussion
at the Krynica Economic Conference in southern  Poland  today. It
“undermines the stability of the Polish currency and we will do
everything to curtail it.”  Foreign-exchange lending “poisons the market and
undermines the stability of the banking system,” he said.  Parent banks behaved very responsibly toward their Polish
units in the first phase of the crisis and the central bank is
now watching the situation very closely, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
