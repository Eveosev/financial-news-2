Tsai Ing-wen, the presidential
candidate of  Taiwan ’s opposition  Democratic Progressive Party ,
will name Su Jia-chyuan as her running mate, the Liberty Times
reported, without saying where it got the information.  Su, 54, is the DPP’s secretary general and was interior
minister from 2004 to 2006 and agriculture minister from 2006 to
2008. He was also a magistrate for Pingtung County, an
agricultural and fishing region in Taiwan’s south.  Tsai will announce her running mate at a briefing at 2 p.m.
local time today, her spokeswoman Hsu Chia-ching said by phone.
She earlier declined to comment on the report about the choice
of Su as running mate.  President Ma Ying-jeou, seeking re-election in January, is
running about even with DPP Chairwoman Tsai, who has accused him
of selling Taiwan short with a policy of rapprochement “boxed
in a frame set by  China .”  Ma, who in June named Premier  Wu Den-yih  as his running
mate, would get 39.6 percent of votes to Tsai’s 38.1 percent, a
poll by the Global Views Survey Research Center published Aug.
