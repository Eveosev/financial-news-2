Djibouti plans to deploy a battalion
of peacekeeping forces in  Somalia  next month, Xinhua reported,
citing Djiboutian Foreign Minister Ali Abdi Farah.  Djibouti would be the third African country to contribute
soldiers to Somalia, where about 9,000 peacekeepers are
currently stationed, the  news agency  said. While Guinea has also
pledged troops, they have yet to arrive, it said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
