Oil tankers that can carry about 7.6
million barrels a day went to  Saudi Arabia ’s  Ras Tanura , the
world’s largest export facility for crude oil, last week, ship-
tracking data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Vessels with a combined capacity of at least 7.3 million
deadweight tons were at the facility from Aug. 28 to Sept. 3. To
estimate what that equates to in barrels a day, the figure was
first multiplied by 7.33 to calculate the total barrels, and
then divided by seven, the number of days in the period.  Japan  will get the largest share of shipments loaded this
week. Supertankers with a combined capacity of 2.4 million tons,
carrying about 17.6 million barrels of crude, are sailing to the
country after going to the terminal.  China ,  South Korea  and the
U.S. will get three tankers each, according to data captured by
satellites and shore-based antennae.  Following are the ships loading in Saudi Arabia and the
companies that hired them and their estimated time of arrival,
where data are available. Drafts are expressed as a percentage
of maximum sailing depth and are an indication of cargo size.  To contact the reporter on this story:
