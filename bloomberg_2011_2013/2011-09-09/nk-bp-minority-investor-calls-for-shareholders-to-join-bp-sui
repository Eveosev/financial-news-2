OAO  TNK-BP Holding (TNBP)  minority
shareholder Andrei Prokhorov called for investors to join a
class action suit against  BP Plc (BP/)  directors on the Moscow-traded
oil producer’s board, according to an advertisement in the
Kommersant newspaper today.  Minority shareholders led by Prokhorov are suing the U.K.
explorer for 87 billion rubles ($2.9 billion) in damages, which
they are related to the failure of BP’s planned share swap and
Arctic exploration deal with state-run OAO Rosneft. TNK-BP
Holding is the traded unit of the Russian oil venture that BP
owns 50-50 with a group of billionaires.  “Prokhorov’s claims have no basis in law and real fact,
and we will dispute them in court”  Vladimir Buyanov , a
spokesman for BP Russia, said by telephone. “The TNK-BP group
suffered no losses and could not have suffered losses because
Rosneft never considered TNK-BP as a potential partner.”  Thomas Kiehn, a TNK-BP spokesman, declined to comment.  Rosneft agreed to explore three Kara Sea blocks in the
Arctic with Exxon Mobil Corp. after the alliance with BP
collapsed. AAR, which represents the billionaire partners, had
challenged that deal, saying the U.K. explorer was violating the
TNK-BP shareholder agreement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
