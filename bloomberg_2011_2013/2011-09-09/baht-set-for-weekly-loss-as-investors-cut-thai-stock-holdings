Thailand ’s baht headed for a weekly
decline after global funds cut holdings of local equities amid
concern the U.S. economic recovery is faltering and  Europe ’s
debt crisis is deepening.  The currency touched the weakest level since July 18 as
exchange data showed international investors sold $103 million
more Thai shares than they bought this week through yesterday.
The University of the Thai Chamber of Commerce said yesterday
consumer confidence fell in August for the first time in four
months.  Japan , Thailand’s biggest export market in the first
half, reported today its economy contracted more than the
government initially estimated in the second quarter.  “With the global growth risk and signs of a spreading
European sovereign debt crisis, demand for the dollar is
increasing, weighing on Asian currencies,” said Minori Uchida,
senior analyst in  Tokyo  at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd.
“However, when sentiment or risk appetite recovers,  Asia  will
receive fund inflows especially as the European and the U.S.
economies aren’t doing well.”  The baht dropped 0.1 percent today and 0.4 percent this
week to 30.05 per dollar as of 8:30 a.m. in Bangkok, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. The currency touched 30.10
earlier, the lowest level since July 18. It may trade between
29.70 and 30.30 by the end of this month, Uchida said.  Japan bought 10.9 percent of goods shipped from Thailand in
the first half of 2011, official data show. Exports account for
about two-thirds of  Southeast Asia ’s second-largest economy.  The yield on the 5.25 percent debt due May 2014, little
changed today, added eight basis points from a week ago, or 0.08
percentage point, to 3.4 percent.  The one-year onshore interest-rate swap, the fixed cost
needed to receive a floating payment, dropped 18.5 basis points
this week to 3.2 percent. The rate was unchanged today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
