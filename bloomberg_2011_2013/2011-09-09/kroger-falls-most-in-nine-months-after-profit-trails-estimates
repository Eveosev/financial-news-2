Kroger Co. (KR) , the largest U.S.
grocery-store chain, dropped the most in more than nine months
after reporting second-quarter profit that trailed analystsâ€™
estimates.  Kroger fell $1.64, or 7 percent, to $21.71 at 10:27 a.m. in
New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares earlier
slid as much as 7.2 percent, the biggest intraday decline since
Dec. 2.  Second-quarter profit excluding some items was 41 cents a
share, the Cincinnati-based company said today in a statement.
The average estimate of 15 analysts in a Bloomberg survey was 43
cents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
