Argentina â€™s government expects the
trade surplus to halve to about $5.1 billion in 2012 from this
year, newspaper El Cronista Comercial reported, citing a draft
of the budget proposal for next year.  The government also forecasts inflation of 9.3 percent in
2012 and a depreciation of the peso to 4.38 per  U.S. dollar  by
the end of the year, the Buenos Aires-based newspaper said
today. The government will send its budget proposal to Congress
in six days, El Cronista said.  Exports are forecast to rise 7.8 percent and imports to
increase 12.8 percent, El Cronista said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
