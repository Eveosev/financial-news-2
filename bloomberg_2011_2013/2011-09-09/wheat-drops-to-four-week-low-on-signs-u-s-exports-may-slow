Wheat futures fell to a four-week
low on speculation that demand for supplies from the U.S., the
world’s top exporter, will ebb as countries including  India  and
 Russia  boost shipments.  India, the second-largest grower, lifted a four-year ban on
exports, allowing companies to ship 2 million metric tons, Food
Minister K.V. Thomas said yesterday. Russia has stepped up sales
after a drought slashed production last year. The dollar jumped
to the highest since March against a basket of six currencies,
eroding the appeal of U.S. goods.  “The focus is on the demand side of the balance sheet,”
 Jeff McReynolds , the owner of McReynolds Marketing & Investments
said by telephone from Hays, Kansas. “The dollar keeps going up
every day, which hurts our competitiveness.”  Wheat futures for December delivery fell 8.25 cents, or 1.1
percent, to settle at $7.2975 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the
Chicago Board of Trade. Earlier, the price touched $7.27, the
lowest for a most-active contract since Aug. 11. The grain
declined 5.9 percent this week, the second straight drop.  China  is the largest grower. Wheat is the fourth-largest
U.S. crop, valued at $13 billion in 2010, behind corn, soybeans
and hay, government data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
