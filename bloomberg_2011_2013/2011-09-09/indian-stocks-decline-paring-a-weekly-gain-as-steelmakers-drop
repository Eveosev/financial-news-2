Indian stocks retreated, paring the
benchmark index’s second weekly advance, as steelmakers dropped
after the ministry lowered its forecast for demand growth.  Tata Steel Ltd. (TATA) , the nation’s largest producer, fell 1.8
percent.  India ’s steel demand this fiscal year will probably
grow at half the pace forecast in May as soaring interest rates
damps purchases of cars, homes and stalls public works, G.K.
Basak, executive secretary of the  steel ministry ’s joint plant
committee, said today.  Jindal Steel & Power Ltd. (JSP)  lost 1.5
percent.  “Growth is slowing and we could possibly see a situation
where economic expansion for the current fiscal year is below 8
percent,” said David Pezarkar, head of equities at Daiwa Asset
Management (India) Pvt. in Mumbai.  The BSE India Sensitive Index, or Sensex, declined 324.94,
or 1.9 percent, to 16,840.60, according to preliminary closing
prices in  Mumbai . The gauge has risen 0.1 percent this week. The
S&P CNX Nifty Index fell 1.8 percent to 5,059.5 while the
BSE-200 Index slid 1.9 percent to 2,085.8.  Steel consumption may rise 6 percent in the year ending
March 31, Basak said in a phone interview. Higher  government
spending  and rising demand for cars and home appliances would
increase demand by 12 percent in the current fiscal year, Steel
Secretary P.K. Misra had said on May 4.  To contact the reporter on this story:
