Gulf Coast  gasoline weakened on
speculation that Tropical Storm Nate won’t impair production by
U.S. refiners in the region.  The government of Mexico issued hurricane watches for the
southeastern coast from Tampico to Veracruz as Tropical Storm
Nate moved northwest through the Bay of Campeche toward an
expected landfall in Mexico as soon as Sept. 11, the U.S.
National Hurricane Center said in an  advisory  at about 10:40
a.m. East Coast time.  “The storm headed into Mexico is unlikely to affect
refinery operations here,” said  Andy Lipow , president of Lipow
Oil Associates LLC in Houston.  The discount for reformulated 87-octane gasoline in the
Gulf Coast widened 0.62 cent to 1 cent a gallon versus futures
traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 12:38 p.m.,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Prompt delivery fell
12.13 cents to $2.7602 a gallon.  The same fuel in New York Harbor fell 2 cents to 14.5 cents
a gallon. It’s the lowest premium since Aug. 31.  To contact the reporter on this story:
