California revenue surpassed budget
estimates in August by 2.1 percent, helping offset previous
shortfalls as the sluggish economic recovery retards tax
collections needed to prevent $4 billion in spending cuts.  The most populous U.S. state collected $134.9 million more
in August than projected in the budget for the fiscal year that
began July 1, Controller John Chiang said in a statement today.
For the year, revenue is $403.8 million below estimates.  Governor  Jerry Brown  signed the financial plan in June
after failing to get Republican support for a referendum that
would have extended expiring taxes and fees. To balance the
budget, lawmakers cut spending by $12 billion. They also counted
on an equal amount of higher revenue, including $4 billion Brown
and fellow Democrats said the recovering economy would deliver.  The $86 billion general-fund spending plan includes a
series of triggers in case the extra revenue doesnâ€™t materialize
by mid-December. The first would cut spending if revenue falls
$1 billion short. A $2 billion gap could mean a seven-day
reduction in the school year and an end to busing subsidies.  Personal income taxes in August were $127.4 million higher
than projected, according to Chiang. Sales taxes were $8.6
million above estimates, while corporate taxes exceeded the
budget by $46.7 million.  Revenue in  July  was $538.8 million, or 10.3 percent, less
than forecast, Chiang said Aug. 9.  To contact the reporters on this story:
