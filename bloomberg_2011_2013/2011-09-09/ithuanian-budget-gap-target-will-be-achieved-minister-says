Lithuania will meet its budget-
deficit target for this year, Finance Minister  Ingrida Simonyte 
said today.  “There’s no risk to the budget-deficit target,” Simonyte
told reporters after a meeting with lawmakers in parliament in
the capital, Vilnius. “The deficit target will be achieved.”  The government is aiming to narrow the 2011 budget
shortfall to 5.3 percent of the Baltic nation’s gross domestic
product from 7.1 percent last year.  Tax revenue exceeded the government target in the first
half, driven by higher collection of income and value-added
taxes, Simonyte said. Excise tax was below target and is likely
to miss full-year estimates, she said.  Budget revenue from taxes grew 12.5 percent from last year
in the first eight months, reaching 11.48 billion litai ($4.56
billion) and exceeding the plan by 0.2 percent, the  Finance
Ministry  said in a statement on its website today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
