Sacramento County, home to
 California ’s capital, had its  credit rating  lowered one level to
A2 by Moody’s Investors Service because of its “precarious”
finances.  Moody’s also downgraded by one step the ratings on
Sacramento County’s pension-obligation bonds to A3, and on its
lease obligations to Baa1. The outlook is stable. The county is
scheduled to offer $238.3 million in taxable pension-obligation
bonds on Sept. 21, Moody’s said in a report today.  “The downgrade reflects the county’s weakened financial
position which remains precarious despite important steps taken
by the county to restore its financial health,” the report
said. “The pace of projected improvement has slowed
substantially, a factor also incorporated into the downgrade.”  Sacramento County, with 1.4 million residents, had a 12.6
percent unemployment rate in June, above the state level of 12.1
percent and the national rate of 9.3 percent, according to the
Moody’s report.  Moody’s said that even with the county’s economic
challenges, including a depressed housing market, it assigned a
stable outlook because managers are working to simplify its debt
structure and improve its finances.  To contact the reporter on this story:
