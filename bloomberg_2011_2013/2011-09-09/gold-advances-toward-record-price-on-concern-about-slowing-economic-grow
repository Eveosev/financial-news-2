Gold gained for a second day in
 London  and climbed toward a record as concern about slowing
growth spurred demand for the metal as a protection of wealth.  President Barack Obama yesterday proposed a $447 billion
plan to create jobs and boost the  U.S. economy , while Federal
Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said policy makers will discuss
the tools they may need to use to aid the recovery at their
meeting this month. European equities fell today after the
European Central Bank yesterday cut its growth forecasts for
this year and next.  “Given the lack of other reliable safe-haven assets, gold
is the best alternative in investors’ eyes,”  Andrey Kryuchenkov , an analyst at VTB Capital in London, wrote today in
a report. “Given the ongoing uncertainty and constant fear of
global growth risks, the downside in gold remains limited.”  Immediate-delivery gold gained $13.25, or 0.7 percent, to
$1,883.43 an ounce by 9:45 a.m. in London. The metal touched a
record $1,921.15 on Sept. 6 and is little changed this week.
Gold for December delivery was up 1.5 percent at $1,886.20 on
the Comex in  New York .  Bullion is in the 11th year of a  bull market , the longest
winning streak since at least 1920 in London, as investors seek
to diversify away from equities and some currencies. The metal
is up 33 percent this year, outperforming global stocks,
commodities and Treasuries.  Infrastructure Spending  Obama, speaking before a joint session of Congress,
demanded six times that lawmakers act “right away” on a plan
that would boost spending on infrastructure, stem teacher
layoffs and cut in half the payroll taxes paid by workers and
small business owners. Job growth stalled last month and the
 unemployment rate  has hovered at or above 9 percent for more
than two years.  “The plan reflects the government’s deep concern about the
economy, raising the real possibility of another round of
quantitative easing, which is supportive of gold,” said Duan
Shihua, head of corporate services at Haitong Futures Co. in
 Shanghai .  Gold exchange-traded-product holdings fell yesterday,
declining 3.2 metric tons to 2,137.9 tons, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. Assets reached a record 2,216.8 tons on Aug. 8.  Silver for immediate delivery rose 0.6 percent to $42.575
an ounce. Platinum was little changed at $1,862.50 an ounce.
Palladium gained 0.4 percent to $761.75 an ounce.  To contact the reporters on this story:
