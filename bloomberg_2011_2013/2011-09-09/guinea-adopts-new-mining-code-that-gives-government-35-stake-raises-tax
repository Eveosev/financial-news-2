Lawmakers in  Guinea , the world’s
biggest exporter of bauxite, adopted a new mining code that will
give the West African nation a 35 percent stake in commodity
companies.  “The code gives a correction to the old one for  Guinea ’s
interests,” Mines Minister Lamine Fofana told reporters after
the policy was approved by members of the National Transitional
Council, the country’s legislative body. Investors will have to
show feasibility studies before mining concessions are granted,
Fofana said in the capital, Conakry, today. “Permit holders must
work in transparency,” he said.  Guinea, whose President  Alpha Conde  pledged mining-sector
reforms as part of his election campaign last year, holds as
much as half of the world’s bauxite reserves, more than 4
billion metric tons of “high-grade”  iron ore  and has deposits of
gold and diamonds, according to the U.S. State Department.
United Co. Rusal,  AngloGold Ashanti Ltd. (ANG) , and  Vale SA (VALE3)  are among
the companies that operate in Guinea.  Customs duties will be increased to 8 percent from 5.6
percent, Fofana said today. Guinea should have an increased role
in bauxite sales and previous mining rights should not be
challenged, according to a copy of the code handed to reporters
on Aug. 31.  To contact the reporter on this story:
