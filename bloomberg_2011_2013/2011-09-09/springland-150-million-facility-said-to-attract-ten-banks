Springland International Holdings
Ltd. (1700) , an operator of retail stores and supermarkets in  China ,
received commitments from ten banks so far for a $150 million
loan, a person familiar with the matter said.  Banks that have joined the three-year facility in general
syndication include Bank of East Asia Ltd., Chang Hwa Commercial
Bank, First Commercial Bank Co., Hua Nan Commercial Bank Ltd.
and Taiwan Business Bank, the person said, asking not to be
identified as details are private. The loan is being arranged by
DBS Group Holdings Ltd.  General syndication of the loan is expected to be completed
next week and signing will likely be by the end of September,
the person said.  The loan will pay a so-called top-level all-in payment of
306 basis points more than the London interbank offered rate, a
person familiar with the matter said last month. The loan, with
an average life of 2.6 years, also pays a 15 basis-point “early
bird” fee, that person said on Aug. 29. Cleavebury Ltd. is
taking out the loan, which Springland will guarantee.  Veronica Hui, a spokeswoman with Springland’s external
public relations agency in  Hong Kong , declined to comment on the
financing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
