SThree Plc (STHR) , a U.K.-based recruitment
company, fell to the lowest in more than a year in London
trading on concern that the global economic slowdown will affect
earnings.  The shares fell 8.3 pence, or 3.5 percent, to 231.8 pence,
the lowest since August 2010. The stock has plunged 47 percent
in the past six months as the economic recovery falters.  “The macroeconomic situation deteriorated in the third
quarter,” Chief Financial Officer  Alex Smith  said in a
telephone interview. “People are concerned that may affect
recruitment companies.”  A selloff of equities during the first four trading days of
the month erased $2.5 trillion from global equities on investor
concern that the stalled U.S. economic recovery and the
sovereign debt crisis in  Europe .  Gross profit in the three months ended Aug. 28 rose 18
percent to 50.2 million pounds from a year earlier, SThree said
in a statement. Gross profit climbed 23 percent in the previous
three months. SThree reiterated an earlier statement about the
slowdown in recruitment by investment banks, which pay high
fees.  Investment banking jobs accounted for about 12 percent of
transactions in the period, compared with 15 percent three
months earlier and 17 percent a year earlier.  Richard Bennett, an analyst at Altium Securities Ltd. who
rates the shares “buy,” plans to lower his earnings estimate
for 2011 “modestly” and for 2012 “significantly” in the wake
of today’s statement, he said in a note to clients today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
