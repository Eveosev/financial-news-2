Swedish industrial production
rebounded more than expected in July, signaling an expansion in
the largest Nordic economy may be stronger than anticipated in
the third quarter.  Industrial production rose 2.8 percent on the month, after
a revised 2.8 percent drop the previous month, Stockholm-based
 Statistics Sweden  said today. Production was expected to gain 
0.4 percent, according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg
survey of eight economists. Output rose an annual 8.2 percent,
compared with an expected 3.7 percent, the agency said.  “Despite the uptick in July, production was only back to
the same level seen in May, and much suggests that production is
leveling out,” said Torbjoern Isaksson, an economist at Nordea
Bank AB, in a note. “Indicators have worsened and order data
for July was weak.”  Sweden ’s central bank Sept. 7 raised its 2011 growth
forecast to 4.5 percent this year and predicted the expansion
will slow to 3.8 percent in the third quarter and 2.6 percent in
the fourth, as exports, which account for about half of Swedish
economic output, will be hurt by the global economic slowdown.  Confidence among Swedish manufacturers slumped to the
lowest in 16 months in August, while a survey indicated
manufacturing contracted for the first time since May 2009 the
same month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
