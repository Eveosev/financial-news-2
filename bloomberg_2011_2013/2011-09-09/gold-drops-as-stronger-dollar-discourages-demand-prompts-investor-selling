Gold futures rose for the second
straight day in  New York  as renewed concern that the Greek debt
crisis will worsen and signs of a slowing global economy spurred
demand for the metal as a store of value.  The MSCI All-Country World Index fell as much as 3.1
percent, and the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slipped 3.1 percent
after German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s government said it is
preparing plans to shore up banks in the event that  Greece  fails
to meet the terms of its aid package and defaults. President
Barack Obama yesterday proposed a $447 billion plan to create
jobs and boost the  U.S. economy .  “The Greece problem is huge, and people also are skeptical
about how much of Obama’s plan will be translated into action,”
 Frank Lesh , a trader at FuturePath Trading, said in a telephone
interview from  Chicago . “Equities are tumbling, and the flight
to safety has begun.”  Gold futures for December delivery gained $2, or 0.1
percent, to settle at $1,859.50 an ounce at 1:49 p.m. on the
Comex in New York. This week, the price fell 0.9 percent after
the metal surged to a record $1,923.70 on Sept. 6. After today’s
close, the metal slid to $1,847.30 in electronic trading.  Budget-Cutting Plans  Obama, speaking before a joint session of Congress,
demanded six times that lawmakers act “right away” on a plan
that would boost spending on infrastructure, stem teacher
layoffs and cut in half the payroll taxes paid by workers and
small business owners. Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke 
said policy makers will discuss the tools they may need to use
to aid the recovery at their meeting this month.  Canadian Finance Minister  Jim Flaherty  said Greece may have
to leave the euro if it fails to press ahead with its budget-
cutting plans.  Gold is in the 11th year of a  bull market , the longest
winning streak since at least 1920 in London, as investors seek
to diversify away from equities and some currencies. The metal
has rallied 31 percent this year, outperforming global stocks,
commodities and Treasuries.  Yesterday, CME Group Inc., the parent company of the Comex,
raised the margin requirement for the Cleared OTC  London  Gold
Forwards contract to $9,450 per contract, the same level as that
for New York gold futures. The OCT contract had no trading
volume or open interest, according to data on the CME  website .  Silver futures for December delivery fell 90.6 cents, or
2.1 percent, to settle at $41.624 an ounce on the Comex. The
price slid 3.4 percent this week, narrowing this year’s gain to
35 percent.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , platinum futures for
October delivery declined $16.60, or 0.9 percent, to $1,837.90
an ounce. Palladium futures for December delivery retreated
$26.70, or 3.5 percent, to $738.60 an ounce.  To contact the reporter on this story:
