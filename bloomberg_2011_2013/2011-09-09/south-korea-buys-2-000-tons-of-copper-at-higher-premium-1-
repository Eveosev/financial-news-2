South Korea ,  Asia ’s third-biggest
consumer of copper, bought 2,000 metric tons of copper cathodes
at a higher premium than its purchase in May, according to an
official at the state-run stockpiling agency.  The Public Procurement Service, which stockpiles strategic
commodities, bought the grade-A copper with more than 99.99
percent of purity from LS-Nikko Copper Inc. at $93 a ton more
than the London Metal Exchange official cash settlement price on
a cost, insurance and freight basis, agency official Bae Cheol
Gyu said by phone from Daejeon, south of the capital  Seoul . The
LME-registered cathode of Korean origin is due for delivery by
Nov. 9, according to the agency’s website.  The price compares with the $88-a-ton premium over the same
benchmark price that the service paid LS-Nikko Copper for 2,000
tons in a May 20 tender.  In today’s tender, the second-lowest price offer was made
by LG International Corp. at $101 a ton over the benchmark price
for worldwide origin, the website showed.  Copper for three-month delivery traded on the LME fell 0.6
percent to $9,063.75 per ton at 2:42 p.m. in Seoul. The metal,
used in cables, wires and pipes, has fallen 5.6 percent this
year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
