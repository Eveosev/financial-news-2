Hong Kong ’s banks face no urgent
reasons to raise capital as a debt crisis grips Europe, said
Nelson Man, executive director of banking supervision of the
city’s monetary authority.  “Hong Kong’s banks are well capitalized, so there is no
immediate need for Hong Kong’s banks to raise capital,” he said
in an interview at a Sept. 8 symposium on Asian banking and
finance held at the Federal Reserve Bank of  San Francisco . The
average capital ratio is “well above” the standards required
by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, Man said.  The city’s banks have “minimal” vulnerability to Europe,
the woes of which are unlikely to have an impact on Hong Kong’s
overall financial stability, Man said. Even so, the challenge
would become more serious if countries such as Germany and
 France  become engulfed in trouble, he said.  “We don’t have any reason to believe this will spread out
to those countries, but we are monitoring the situation very
closely,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
