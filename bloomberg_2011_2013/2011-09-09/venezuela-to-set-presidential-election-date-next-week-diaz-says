Venezuela ’s  electoral council  will
meet Sept. 13 to decide the date for next year’s presidential
election, said Vicente Diaz, a council rector.  Diaz, one of five members of the committee, denied
speculation that the council will set a date in March on the
orders of President  Hugo Chavez . March would be too early, given
that the opposition plans to hold primaries on Feb. 12, Diaz
said in a phone interview.  “We’re going to discuss it and I hope that on Tuesday
we’ll be able to announce it,” he said. “It wouldn’t make
sense to have primary elections on Feb. 12, to then have
presidential elections a month afterwards.”  Nelson Bocaranda, a columnist for the Caracas daily El
Universal, wrote on his  Twitter account  today that an order had
been sent from the presidential palace, Miraflores, to hold the
elections in March.  “I have found out that the presidential elections will
definitely be in March through a decision from Miraflores,”
Bocaranda wrote.  Presidential elections traditionally take place in
December, although there is no law to prevent them from being
before then, Diaz said.  Chavez, who is receiving chemotherapy treatment for an
undisclosed cancer, said on Sept. 7 he will appear more often in
public by the end of October and will launch his presidential
campaign at the start of 2012.  The self-declared socialist will seek a third consecutive
six-year period in office after winning a referendum in 2009 to
abolish  term limits .  To contact the reporter on this story:
