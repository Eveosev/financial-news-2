Ireland’s budget-cutting program is
on track and the third installment of international aid should
be paid out by the end of October, the European Union said.  “Important progress has been made” in cutting the
deficit, bolstering the Irish banking industry and implementing
structural reforms, the EU said today in an e-mailed statement.
The third review of Ireland’s progress under its international
aid program shows “a gradual return to positive growth in
2011,” it said.  “The determination of the government to fully implement
the program and the July 21 announcements have enabled a
noticeable reduction of yields on Irish sovereign bonds on the
secondary markets in recent weeks,” the EU said.  The EU welcomed Ireland’s plan to issue a budget strategy
for the years 2012-2015, saying “early specification” of the
proposed measures would “help sustain the recent improvements
in  market sentiment  toward Ireland.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
