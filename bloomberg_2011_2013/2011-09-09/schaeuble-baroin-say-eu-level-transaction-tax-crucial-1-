Germany and  France  urged the
European Union to press ahread with plans to set up a financial
transaction tax, saying that a levy on stocks, bonds derivatives
and currencies could generate “significant revenue.”  “We believe the European Union should lead the global
mobilization on this issue and we asked the Council Presidency
to put it on the European agenda in the coming months,” German
Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble and French Finance Minister
 Francois Baroin  said in a letter dated today to EU commissioner
for taxation, Algirdas Semeta.  Britain, home to Europe’s largest financial-services
industry, already has its own bank levy and won’t take part in
any euro-area financial tax, a U.K. Treasury official said after
Schaeuble and Baroin released their letter.  Britain levies a charge on bank balance sheets as part of
its efforts to cut the  budget deficit . The tax is forecast to
raise 2.4 billion pounds ($3.8 billion) in the fiscal year that
began in April.  To contact the reporter on this story:
