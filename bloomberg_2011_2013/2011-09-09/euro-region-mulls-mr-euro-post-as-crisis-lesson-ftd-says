Euro-region leaders including
Luxembourg Prime Minister  Jean-Claude Juncker  will propose
creating a post of “Mr. Euro” to better address the currency
bloc’s woes, the  Financial Times Deutschland  reported.  Juncker, who heads the euro-area group, would be prepared
to step down to make way for a new group “finance minister,”
the newspaper said, without saying where it got the information.  The Netherlands favors setting up a new European
commissioner with powers to impose sanctions on euro states that
violate deficit rules.  German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  and French President
Nicolas Sarkozy have proposed that European Union President
Herman van Rompuy chair regular euro group meetings, FTD said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
