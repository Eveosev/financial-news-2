Porsche SE’s third-quarter earnings
may be reduced by about 1.6 billion euros ($2.2 billion) because
of effects from a revaluation of put/ call options  on the holding
company’s remaining stake in its car-making operations, a person
familiar with the matter said.  The exact impact of the non-cash adjustment of the auto
unit’s valuation on Porsche’s books will be released when the
Stuttgart, Germany-based holding company publishes results in
late October, the person said, declining to be identified
discussing the matter before an official announcement.  Net income at the holding unit, which has investments in
the auto-making operations of Porsche and  Volkswagen AG (VOW) , was 149
million euros in the first half of the year. Porsche and VW
yesterday abandoned plans to complete a merger by the end of
this year as lawsuits left them unable to agree on the value of
the maker of the 911 sports car, raising doubts over whether a
merger will take place.  To contact the reporter on this story:
