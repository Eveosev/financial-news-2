Sony Financial Holdings Inc. (8729) , the
insurance and banking unit of  Sony Corp. (6758) , said profit will fall
over the next three years as it expects gains on securities
holdings to decline.  Sony Financial forecasts group net income of 39 billion yen
($503 million) for the year ending March 2014, compared with the
41.7 billion yen it posted in the year ended March 2011, the
Tokyo-based company said in its midterm business plan today.
Revenue will be 1.16 trillion yen for the period, compared with
1 trillion yen last fiscal year, it said.  Japanese insurers suffered losses on their securities
holdings in the aftermath of a record earthquake in March,
prompting them to seek new means of growth at home and overseas.
Sony Financial, which derives almost 90 percent of revenue from
its life insurance unit, has built its business by coming up
with new strategies such as selling auto insurance online.  “We expect profit decline due to our securities holdings
to hit a bottom in the current fiscal year,” Chief Executive
Officer Katsumi Ihara said at an investor relations meeting held
in  Tokyo  today. “We are continuing to look for opportunities
and deals that will allow us to enter new realm of business and
will contribute to our profits.”  Sony Financial plans to expand its business in  Asia ,
possibly through mergers and acquisitions, as an aging
population constrains growth at home, Ihara said in an interview
with Bloomberg News last year. Alliances and merger and
acquisitions will be “very possible means” for expansion, he
said at the time, declining to elaborate.  Sony Financial shares declined 1.1 percent to 1,110 yen at
the 3 p.m. close on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, reversing an
earlier gain of as much as 1.2 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
