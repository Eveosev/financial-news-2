(Corrects name in headline.)  Osama bin Laden  wanted al-Qaeda to
attack  France , weekly magazine Paris Match reported on its
website, citing an unidentified U.S. Central Intelligence Agency
official.  Documents found in bin Ladenâ€™s belongings show he wanted to
draw up a list of targets in France, including monuments and
tourist attractions, according to the magazine. The CIA sent the
documents to the French security services, Paris Match said.  They found no evidence of a firm plan linked to the
documents, the magazine said, citing an unidentified diplomatic
official.  Click here for web link  To contact the reporter on this story:
