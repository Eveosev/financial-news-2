U.S. stocks fell, driving the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index to the sixth drop in the past seven
weeks, as concern Greece’s finances are deteriorating
overshadowed President  Barack Obama ’s $447 billion plan to
stimulate growth.  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  and Hewlett-Packard Co. decreased more
than 6.9 percent on concern about a global financial crisis as
27 of 30 Dow Jones Industrial Average companies retreated.
 McDonald’s Corp. (MCD)  slumped 4.6 percent as August sales trailed
analysts’ estimates. Financial and materials companies in the
S&P 500 fell 2.4 percent or more, the most among 10 industries.
Yahoo! Inc. added 13 percent after the most-visited U.S. Web
portal ousted Chief Executive Officer  Carol Bartz .  The S&P 500 fell 1.7 percent to 1,154.23 this week, the
second straight weekly loss and the lowest level since Aug. 22.
The Dow retreated 248.13 points, or 2.2 percent, to 10,992.13.  “The market is very jittery,” Jason Hsu, who oversees $83
billion as chief investment officer at Research Affiliates LLC
in  Newport Beach , California, said in a telephone interview.
“It’s hoping for good news, but it’s responding very quickly to
anything that doesn’t indicate a path to recovery.”  The  S&P 500  and Dow wiped out their weekly gains yesterday
after three German officials said Chancellor Angela Merkel’s
government is preparing plans to shore up banks if Greece
defaults. The European Central Bank said  Juergen Stark  resigned
from the executive board, suggesting policy makers are divided
over how to fight the debt crisis. Stocks also fell after Obama
called on Congress on Sept. 8 to pass a $447 billion plan to
boost employment after jobs growth stalled last month.  Bear Market  Between April 29 and Aug. 8, the S&P 500 fell 18 percent
amid concern about the European debt crisis and after S&P
downgraded the U.S. government’s credit rating. The measure has
risen 3.1 percent since then. It closed as low as 1,119.46 on
Aug. 8, within 29 points of a bear market, or a 20 percent drop.  The European debt crisis may mimic the events that led to
Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.’s bankruptcy in September 2008,
which spurred the biggest financial crisis since the 1930s,
according to Eric Upin, chief investment officer at Makena
Capital Management LLC.  “The problems in  Europe  are the same kind of problems we
had in the U.S.,” Upin, who oversees $14.5 billion at the  Menlo
Park , California-based money manager, said on Sept. 8 at the
Bloomberg Global Inflation Conference in  New York . “The
problems in Europe border on -- we don’t know the magnitude -- a
solvency crisis, and there may not be the political system to
solve those problems.”  ‘Downside Risks’  European Central Bank  President Jean-Claude Trichet said
Sept. 8 that “downside risks” to the euro area intensified,
giving officials the option to take further action to stimulate
the economy should the debt crisis worsen. The ECB cut its
growth forecasts for this year and next.  Stocks also fell as Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  disappointed investors by not detailing new plans to
stimulate growth. He stopped short of signaling what he thinks
is the Fed’s best option to aid the world’s largest economy when
he spoke this week to economists in Minneapolis before an
expanded two-day Fed meeting that ends Sept. 21.  “It seems like every move up is encountered with
resistance and further selling,”  Larry Peruzzi , senior equity
trader at Cabrera Capital Markets Inc. in Boston, wrote in an e-
mail. “Traders are hoping for a major announcement or policy
from the Fed on Sept. 21. There is lots of concern that either
 Greece  gets shown the gate in euro-land or Washington fails to
pass anything of substance until 2014.”  Banks, Commodities  Financial companies lost the most in the S&P 500,
decreasing 2.6 percent as a group. A gauge of raw-material
producers fell the second-most, dropping 2.4 percent as the S&P
GSCI index of 24 commodities lost 0.3 percent.  JPMorgan lost 7.4 percent, the most in the Dow, to $32.08.
 Bank of America Corp. (BAC)  declined 3.7 percent to $6.98.  The Morgan Stanley Cyclical Index of companies most-tied to
economic growth slipped 1.6 percent this week, while the Dow
Jones Transportation Average of 20 stocks, also considered a
proxy for the economy, slumped 1.7 percent.  General Electric Co. (GE) , the world’s biggest maker of
electricity-generating equipment, decreased 4.3 percent to
$15.09.  Alcoa Inc. (AA) , the largest U.S. aluminum producer,
retreated 3.8 percent to $11.58.  McDonald’s slumped 4.6 percent to $85.03. The world’s
largest restaurant chain said sales at stores open at least 13
months rose 3.5 percent in August. Analysts projected a gain of
5 percent, the average of seven estimates compiled by Bloomberg.
U.S. sales advanced 3.9 percent, missing analysts’ estimates for
a 4.5 percent gain.  Pall, Whirlpool  Pall Corp. (PLL)  fell the most in the S&P 500, losing 12 percent
to $42.47. The producer of water-filtration and purification
systems reported fiscal fourth-quarter earnings that missed
analysts’ estimates as operating profit at its industrial
division was $52 million, $18 million less than a year earlier.  Whirlpool Corp. (WHR)  fell 10 percent, the second-biggest slump
in the S&P 500, to $52.54. The world’s largest appliance maker
was cut to “neutral” from “buy” at Goldman Sachs Group Inc.,
which cited a possible “sharp earnings deceleration from 2011
to 2013.”  Yahoo rose 13 percent to $14.48. Bartz said in a memo to
staff on Sept. 6 that she was fired by Chairman Roy Bostock by
telephone. The company said Chief Financial Officer Tim Morse
will be interim CEO and announced a strategic review to boost
growth. Under Bartz, who took over as CEO in January 2009, Yahoo
failed to keep Google Inc. and Facebook Inc. from siphoning off
Internet users and advertising revenue.  To contact the reporter on this story:
