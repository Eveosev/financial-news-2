An Australian judge plans to
consider a media request today for access to documents in a
lawsuit against Gina Rinehart,  Australia ’s richest person, filed
by her daughter Hope Rinehart Welker.  New South Wales Supreme Court Judge Paul Brereton scheduled
the hearing for 3 p.m. in Sydney, according to the clerk’s
office.  Welker’s lawsuit was mentioned in a Sydney court yesterday,
although the motivation of the case remains a “mystery”
because the file is sealed, the Australian newspaper  said . The
documents should remain sealed because of the “impact on
commercial negotiations,” said Rinehart’s lawyer, Alan
Sullivan, according to the newspaper. Sullivan wasn’t
immediately available for comment today.  Rinehart became the first woman to top Forbes Asia’s list
of Australia’s richest people this year as surging  iron ore 
prices and exports more than quadrupled her fortune to $9
billion from a year earlier.  Rinehart, who inherited iron ore mining assets from her
father, Lang Hancock, owns the Roy Hill iron ore deposit in
Western Australia through Hancock Prospecting Ltd. and has an
equal share in the Rio Tinto Group-operated Hope Downs mines.
She is also developing two coal projects worth an estimated $15
billion to meet rising demand from China and  India , according to
Forbes. Last year she bought a 10 percent stake in  Ten Network
Holdings Ltd. (TEN) , Australia’s third-biggest television broadcaster.
She also gained a seat on Ten’s board.  The case is Hope Rinehart Welker v Gina Rinehart.
