UniCredit SpA (UCG)  Chief Executive
Officer Federico Ghizzoni doesn’t think the crisis of confidence
in the banking system is similar to the one after Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc. collapsed,  Handelsblatt  reported.  The short-term interbank lending market is still
functioning and the main concern is that U.S.-based
institutional creditors are cutting credit lines or freezing
funds, the newspaper said, citing an interview with the banker.  That doesn’t pose a problem for UniCredit, which is storing
its surplus in dollars at the  Federal Reserve , Handelsblatt
cited him as saying.  UniCredit is looking to invest in Poland, Russia and Turkey
and evaluating whether to withdraw from markets where its
business is either too small or not profitable enough,
Handelsblatt reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
