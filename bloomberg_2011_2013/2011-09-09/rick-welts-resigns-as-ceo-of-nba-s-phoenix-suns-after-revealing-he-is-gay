Rick Welts said he’s stepping down
as president and chief executive officer of the  Phoenix Suns ,
four months after disclosing that he’s gay.  “I’m at a point in my life where my focus is to align my
personal life in a way I’ve never been able to achieve before,”
Welts said in a statement from the National Basketball
Association team. “The most important people in my personal
life are not in Phoenix.”  Welts joined the franchise as president in 2002. He added
CEO duties two years ago.  The search for a replacement will begin immediately, owner
Robert Sarver said in the statement.  Welts made his disclosure in a front-page New York  Times 
story, becoming the most senior professional sports executive to
say he’s homosexual.  “The response from fans, co-workers, players and ownership
of the Suns to my announcement has been the most gratifying
experience of my life,” said Welts, who will leave his job
Sept. 15.  Welts began his affiliation with the NBA as a ball boy with
the  Seattle SuperSonics  in 1967. He spent 17 years at the league
office, leaving in 1999 as chief marketing officer.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
