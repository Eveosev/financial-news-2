The FTSE/JSE Africa All Share Index
snapped two days of gains, retreating 477.13, or 1.5 percent, to
30,440.87 by the 5 p.m. close in Johannesburg and paring its
advance this week to 0.3 percent.  The following were among the most active stocks in the
South African market today.  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP)  , the world’s largest mining
group, snapped two days of increases, losing 5.72 rand, or 2.4
percent, to 228.76 rand. Industrial metals slumped in  London 
amid concern that a slowdown in global economic growth will damp
demand.  Anglo American Plc (AAL)  , the mining company that makes
up about 9 percent of the benchmark  stock index , lost 5.28 rand,
or 1.8 percent, to 281.50 rand.  Investec Plc (INVP)  , a private bank and wealth manager,
fell the first day in three, losing 74 cents, or 1.5 percent, to
48.66 rand. Investec agreed to buy Evolution Group Plc in a
transaction valuing the British stockbroker at 233.2 million
pounds ($371.8 million).  Pick n Pay Stores Ltd. (PIK)  ,  South Africa ’s second-
biggest food retailer, retreated for a second day, falling 33
cents, or 0.9 percent, to 38.50 rand. The company is “deeply
disappointed” by the Australian anti-trust authority’s decision
to appeal Pick n Pay’s sale of the Franklins supermarkets
business to Metcash, Chairman Gareth Ackerman said in a
statement today.  Ububele Holdings Ltd. (UBU)  , a food-processing company,
dropped to its lowest level since at least May 1999, slumping 13
cents, or 31.7 percent, to 28 cents. Ububele said earnings per
share excluding extraordinary items will be from 1.2 cents to
1.4 cents in the year through June, or as much as 89 percent
lower than a year earlier, according to a trading update
published yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
