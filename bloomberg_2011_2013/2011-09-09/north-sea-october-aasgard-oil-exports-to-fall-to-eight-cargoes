Exports of North Sea Aasgard crude
will drop to eight cargoes of 855,000 barrels each in October,
one less than this month, according to a loading program
obtained by Bloomberg News.  October loadings will total 6.84 million barrels, or
220,645 barrels a day, the plan showed. That compares with
256,500 barrels a day this month.  Statoil ASA (STL) ,  Norway â€™s largest oil and gas producer,
operates the Aasgard field.  Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude shipments
compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan
their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
