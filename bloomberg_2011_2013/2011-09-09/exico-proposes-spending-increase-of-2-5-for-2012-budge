Mexican President Felipe Calderon’s
government proposed to boost spending by 2.5 percent in real
terms for next year, when  Latin America ’s second-biggest economy
will elect a new head of state.  The  Finance Ministry  submitted yesterday a proposal to
congress for 2012 spending of 3.62 trillion pesos ($290 billion)
and no changes to the  tax code , according to a presentation on
the agency’s  website .  The plan would create a budget deficit of 36.7 billion
pesos, or 0.2 percent of the country gross domestic product,
excluding investments in state-owned oil company  Petroleos
Mexicanos . This year’s proposed deficit was 42 billion pesos, or
0.3 percent of GDP. If approved, 2012 will be Mexico’s third
consecutive year with a deficit.  By not including drastic changes, “the government took the
safest road,” Sergio Luna, head of economic research at
Citigroup Inc.’s Banamex unit in  Mexico  City, said in a
telephone interview. “The budget seeks to minimize the level of
controversy in congress.”  The initiative proposes 2012 total income of 3.28 trillion
pesos with a forecast oil price of $84.9 a barrel. Taxes on oil
sales provide about a third of Mexico’s government income.  The government is forecasting that growth will slow to 3.5
percent in 2012 after expanding 4 percent this year, according
to the document. The peso will trade at an average of 11.9 per
U.S. dollar this year and an average of 12.2 per dollar next
year, according to the ministry.  “It’s a conservative and well-balanced proposal, coherent
with fiscal discipline,” said Delia Paredes, chief economist at
Grupo Financiero Banorte in a telephone interview from Mexico
City.  The initiative seeks to “avoid a contagion from the
confidence problems that are afflicting developed economies due
to the irresponsible management of their finances and financial
systems,” Finance Minister  Ernesto Cordero  said yesterday. He
spoke in Mexico City after presenting the initiative to
lawmakers.  Lowered Expectations  The government and economists have cut Mexican GDP
forecasts in recent weeks on concerns the  U.S. economy , which
buys about 80 percent of Mexico’s exports, is losing steam.  Mexico’s economy will expand 3.9 percent in 2011 and 3.5
percent in 2012, according to the median estimates of a survey
released by Citigroup Inc.’s Banamex unit Sept. 6. Economists
had previously forecast 2011 growth of 3.95 percent and 2012
growth of 3.7 percent.  “Mexico needs an income law and spending budget that’s
responsible and promotes economic growth and long-term social
development,” Cordero said. “We can’t take any risks and we
can’t make any mistakes.”  Banorte’s Paredes said the deficit could widen from the
proposed amount following negotiations in Congress.  Debt Sales  To finance the deficit, the government plans 395 billion
pesos of domestic debt sales next year and will favor domestic
bond offerings, according to the ministry’s presentation. Mexico
will sell $7 billion of debt overseas, the ministry said.  Security spending under Calderon’s plan would rise 10.7
percent to 147.2 billion pesos. Calderon vowed on Sept. 2 to
continue fighting criminal groups until the end of his term.  Drug-gang violence has accelerated this year, including an
arson attack on a casino that killed 52 people in Monterrey on
Aug. 25. The death toll related to organized crime has surpassed
35,000 since Calderon took office in December 2006. The
president’s six-year term ends Nov. 30, 2012.  The lower house of congress must approve the income
portion of the budget by Oct. 20 and the spending portion by
Nov. 15. The senate will have until Oct. 31 to approve the
income portion of the budget.  Mexico will hold presidential elections in July next year.  The peso posted its first decline in three days yesterday,
weakening 0.4 percent 12.5146 per  U.S. dollar  at 5 p.m. New York
time, from 12.4638 yesterday. The benchmark IPC stock index fell
1.3 percent to 34,712.38.  To contact the reporter on this story:
