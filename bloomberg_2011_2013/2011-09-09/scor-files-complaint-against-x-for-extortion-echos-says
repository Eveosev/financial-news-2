Scor SA filed a complaint with Paris
prosecutors against an unnamed party for fraud after the
reinsurer’s data was used to try and extort money from its
accountants,  Les Echos  said, citing a lawyer for the company.  Scor is one of several French companies targeted for fraud,
the French daily said, naming hamburger chain Quick as another
victim. The newspaper said a Scor accountant dealing with
special operations was sent an e-mail, asking that an amount be
paid to a third party urgently, and with “total discretion.”  The complaint filed the complaint against ”X,” a common
practice in  France  when the perpetrator hasn’t been identified.
Scor spokesman Jean-Charles Simon couldn’t immediately be
reached for comment.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
