The Polish economy’s weakening is
“very visible” so there are “no reasons to increase interest
rates even if inflation is high,” central banker Andrzej

Telewizja Trwam.  The Warsaw-based  Narodowy Bank Polski  kept the seven-day
interest rate at 4.5 percent at its meeting Sept. 6-7.  To contact the reporters on this story:
