Overseas funds bought a net 294
million rupees ($6.36 million) of Indian equities yesterday,
raising total investment in equities this year to 29.1 billion
rupees, the nation’s market regulator said.  Foreigners bought 22.3 billion rupees of shares and sold 22
billion rupees, the  Securities and Exchange Board of India  said
 today . They sold a net 1.64 billion rupees of bonds, paring
their flows into debt this year to 206.9 billion rupees.  Overseas investors bought a record 1.33 trillion rupees of
shares in 2010, helping fuel a 17 percent rally in the Bombay
Stock Exchange’s Sensitive Index, the best performer among the
world’s 10 biggest equity markets last year. They invested 464
billion rupees in bonds last year.  The previous record was in 2009 when flows reached 834.2
billion rupees, sparking the biggest rally in 18 years. Funds
pulled out a record 530 billion rupees from equities in 2008,
setting off the worst annual slump. Foreign funds have placed
4.5 trillion rupees in stocks and 992.8 billion rupees in bonds
since they were allowed into the country in 1993.  The regulator provides data on shares bought and sold by
large investors, including trades in the primary and secondary
markets, with a delay of at least a day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
