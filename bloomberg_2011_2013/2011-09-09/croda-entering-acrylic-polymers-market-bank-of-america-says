Croda International Plc is planning
to enter the 500 million-pound ($798 million) acrylic polymers
business serving the personal-care products market with an
investment due to come on stream in the second quarter of 2012,
Bank of America Merrill Lynch said in a note.  The company is targeting 50 million pounds of sales over
the mid-term, the move could provide a “reasonable share of
incremental growth” for the company, said Bank of America
analyst Andrew Stott in a note, following an investor day hosted
by the company. Croda is investing 10 million pounds to enter
the market, he said.  Croda will likely engage in more share buybacks next year
to soak up excess cash as major acquisition opportunities are
“potentially thin on the ground,” Stott said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
