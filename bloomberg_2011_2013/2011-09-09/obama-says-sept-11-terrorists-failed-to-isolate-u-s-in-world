President  Barack Obama  said the
Sept. 11 terrorists “failed” in their attempt to isolate the
U.S. from the rest of the world.  “Those who attacked us on 9/11 wanted to drive a wedge
between the United States and the world,” Obama wrote in an
opinion article for newspapers outside the U.S. “They failed.”
The U.S. is fighting al-Qaeda, Obama said, and “is not and
never will be at war with Islam.”  Since the attacks, the U.S., working with international
partners, disrupted al-Qaeda plots, killed Osama bin Laden and
other terrorists and “put al-Qaeda on the path to defeat,”
Obama said. While the U.S. is struggling economically, it “will
continue to play a unique leadership role in the world.”  On the 10th anniversary of the terrorist strike that killed
almost 3,000 people in  New York , Washington and a rural field in
Pennsylvania, “we remember that 9/11 was not only an attack on
the United States, it was an attack on the world and on the
humanity and hopes that we share,” Obama said. Those who died
came from more than 90 nations. “On this solemn anniversary we
join with their families and nations in honoring their memory.”  Civil uprisings against regimes in the Middle East and
North Africa, he said, show that “violent extremists are being
left behind and that the future belongs to those who want to
build, not destroy.”  Obama will take part in ceremonies on Sept. 11 at the site
where the World Trade Center stood in  New York City , at the
Pentagon outside Washington and in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.  To contact the reporter on this story:
