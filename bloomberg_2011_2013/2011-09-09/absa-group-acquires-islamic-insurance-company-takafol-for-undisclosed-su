Absa Group Ltd. (ASA) , the South African
bank controlled by  Barclays Plc (BARC) , agreed to buy Takafol  South
Africa  Ltd., an Islamic insurer, for an undisclosed sum.  By combining Takafol’s South African products into Absa
Insurance there will be “more direct control” over
underwriting and pricing, Johannesburg-based Absa said in an e-
mailed statement today. This new operation will comply with
Islamic Shariah law, the company said.  Takafol, which started in 2003, will be rebranded Absa
Takafol. Uwaiz Jassat, Takafol South Africa’s current managing
director, will head the new division.  Absa, South Africa’s biggest retail bank, introduced
investment products that comply with Islamic law in 2005.
Barclays, the U.K.’s third-biggest lender, owns 56 percent of
Absa.  To contact the reporter on this story:
