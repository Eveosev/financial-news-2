Honda Motor Co. is recalling 310,773
Pilot SUVs to fix seat-belt stitching that can unravel during a
crash, the company said.  Honda discovered a manufacturing error on a small number of
front seat belts, the Tokyo, Japan-based company said in a
 statement  on its website today. The recall affects vehicles from
model years 2009 through 2011 in the  United States , it said.  Pilot owners will be notified by mail in early October,
Honda said. They can also call 1-800-999-1009 or check the
website,  http://www.recalls.honda.com . The only way to check for
the manufacturing defect is to allow a dealer to inspect the
belts, Honda said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
