Belarus’s ruble will begin to trade
freely on the Belarusian Currency and Stock Exchange from Sept.
14, the central bank said today.  Outside the exchange, Belarusian companies won’t be allowed
to trade more than 1,000 units of any foreign currency a day
with commercial banks,  Natsionalnyi Bank Respubliki Belarus  said
in an e-mailed statement. Banks will still be able to trade
currency among themselves and with non-resident banks, it added.  Belarus, which is grappling with a balance-of-payments
crisis that forced a 36 percent devaluation of the ruble in May,
will allow the market to determine the currency’s exchange rate,
scrapping official government rates, President  Alexander Lukashenko  said Aug. 30. While the ruble’s value may decline 30
percent to 50 percent against the dollar, the move will help
address the country’s trade deficit, Moody’s Investors Service
said Sept. 5.  To contact the reporter on this story:
