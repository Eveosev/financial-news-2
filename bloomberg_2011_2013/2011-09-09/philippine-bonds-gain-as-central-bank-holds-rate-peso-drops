Philippine bonds advanced this week
after the central bank refrained from raising borrowing costs
yesterday and signaled its willingness to keep  interest rates 
steady. The peso declined.  Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas sees “no urgency to change the
course” of its monetary policy stance, Deputy Governor Diwa Guinigundo said yesterday, after policy makers left the
benchmark rate at 4.5 percent for a third straight meeting.
Inflation is “less of a concern” while growth is “more of a
concern,” Guinigundo said.  “The central bank’s inclination toward growth worries
rather than inflation should be bond supportive,” said Rafael Algarra, treasurer at Security Bank Corp. in Manila. “It should
sustain the view of no more interest-rate hikes and even a
possibility of monetary loosening should growth deteriorate.”  The yield on the 8 percent bonds due July 2031 dropped 27
basis points, or 0.27 percentage point, this week to 7.10
percent as of 4 p.m. in  Manila , according to Tradition Financial
Services. The rate fell five basis points today.  Inflation eased for a second month in August, with consumer
prices increasing 4.7 percent from a year earlier, a report
showed this week. Growth in the  Philippines ’ $200 billion
economy slowed for a fourth straight quarter to 3.4 percent in
the three months through June from a year earlier, compared with
4.6 percent in the first quarter.  The peso fell 0.8 percent this week to 42.497 per dollar,
according to Tullett Prebon Plc, the biggest loss in five weeks.
The currency dropped 0.1 percent today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
