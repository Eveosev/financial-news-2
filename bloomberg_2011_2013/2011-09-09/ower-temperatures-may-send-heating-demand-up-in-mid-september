Temperatures may be low enough in
the Midwest and  New England  by mid-September to send residents
turning up the thermostats in their homes and businesses, said
 Matt Rogers , president of Commodity Weather Group LLC.  In his 6- to 10-day forecast, Rogers said low temperatures
in the 40s Fahrenheit (about 4 Celsius) may spread through those
areas from Sept. 14 to Sept. 18. At the same time, he predicts
the upper  Rocky Mountains  and Texas will be warmer.  From Sept. 19 to Sept. 21, Rogers, based in Bethesda,
Maryland, forecasts more moderate weather across the U.S. except
a pocket of cool air in the Carolinas and warmth from Texas into
the Rockies.  Natural gas traders use long-range temperature predictions
to gauge energy use and market fluctuations. Hot or cold weather
can increase demand for heating and cooling, and power plants
use about 30 percent of the nationâ€™s gas supplies, according to
Energy Department data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
