     Sept. 9 (Bloomberg) --Bank of Italy Governor  Mario Draghi 
called for quick approval of the government’s austerity package
in a meeting with Prime Minister  Silvio Berlusconi  late
yesterday, Corriere della Sera reported without saying where it
got the information.  Draghi told Berlusconi that speedy passage of the plan is
important to show markets that Italy is serious about taming its
deficit, as the European Central Bank’s purchases of Italian
bonds are temporary, Corriere reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
