The Czech inflation rate was
unchanged in August, holding below the central bank’s 2 percent
target as policy makers deliberate when to raise  interest rates .  Inflation was 1.7 percent, the same as in July, the
Statistics Office in  Prague  said today on its website. The
median estimate of 18 economists in a Bloomberg survey was 1.9
percent. The central bank said the result was 0.4 percentage
points below its forecast. Consumer prices fell 0.3 percent in
the month.  The Ceska Narodni Banka in Prague has delayed until around
the end of the year raising the benchmark two-week repurchase
rate after keeping it a record low 0.75 percent since May last
year. The  European Central Bank  kept its main rate at 1.5
percent yesterday. ECB President  Jean-Claude Trichet  said
threats to the euro region have worsened and inflation risks
have eased.  Inflation “remains roughly in line” with our overall
prognosis for price growth, the bank said in a statement.  Annual inflation was affected mainly by slowing growth in
food and non-alcoholic beverages, declining 1.4 percent from a
month ago, the office said.  The central bank board’s members have expressed differing
views on inflation risks, with two policy makers demanding a
quarter-point increase at the last three monetary meetings. One
of the advocates of higher rates,  Eva Zamrazilova , was quoted on
Sept. 5 as saying that economic uncertainty is clouding outlook
for monetary policy and that she doesn’t know how she will see
the situation at the next policy meeting on Sept. 22.  To contact the reporter on this story:
