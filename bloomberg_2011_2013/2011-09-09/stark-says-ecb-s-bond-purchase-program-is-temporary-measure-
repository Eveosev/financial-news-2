European Central Bank Executive
Board member Juergen Stark said the bank’s government bond
purchases are a temporary measure to restore transmission of
monetary policy.  “As long as we see the risk that this transmission
mechanism is impaired, that our low  interest rates  aren’t
transformed or translated into the lending rates, as long as
this is the case, we are prepared to intervene,” Stark told TV
 Tokyo  in an interview. “However, this is a temporary measure.
It is not a permanent measure. It is one of our non-standard
measures.”  The ECB last month started buying Italian and Spanish
government bonds after  Europe ’s debt crisis pushed their yields
to euro-era records. Banks in the region are also becoming more
reluctant to lend to each other, prompting the ECB to offer them
an emergency six-month loan and extend its unlimited liquidity
provision through the end of the year.  Stark said the ECB is “of a very optimistic and positive
view” regarding Ireland’s efforts to restore its
creditworthiness. He said the  International Monetary Fund ,
European Commission and the ECB “have been very clear in the
messages that were sent to the Greek authorities: Greece has to
deliver.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
