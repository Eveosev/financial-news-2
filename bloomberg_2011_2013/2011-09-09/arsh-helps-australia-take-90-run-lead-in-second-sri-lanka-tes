Shaun Marsh’s unbeaten 87 helped
Australia take a 90-run lead over  Sri Lanka  on day two of the
second cricket Test in Kandy.  Michael Hussey is 76 not out as Australia reached 264-3 at
stumps in replay to the host’s first-innings 174 all out. Marsh
is making his Test debut in place of former captain  Ricky
Ponting , who returned to Australia for the birth of his second
child.  Australia won the opener of the three-match series by 125
runs. It can move above Sri Lanka to fourth in the International
Cricket Council Test rankings by winning the series.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
