The U.S. energy rig count fell for a
second week as producers shut rigs in Texas, according to data
published by  Baker Hughes Inc. (BHI)   The count fell by 10 to 1,958, Baker Hughes said on its
website. The oil rig count also fell for the second time in 20
weeks, by 7 to 1,057.  Before last week, the oil rig count had risen 19 straight
weeks to reach the highest level since Baker Hughes separated
oil and natural gas rig counts in 1987. Crude oil for October
delivery rose 79 cents, or 0.9 percent, this week to $87.24 a
barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange .  “Most of the rig drop was in the Permian Basin,”  James Williams , an economist at WTRG Economics in  London , Arkansas,
said in a telephone interview. “The bottleneck at Cushing has
really had an impact on prices relative to the world, but I
don’t know if the price explains it. Sometimes, they’re just
moving rigs.”  Texas lost 14 rigs, falling to 884, while  Oklahoma  gained
eight to 203, Baker Hughes said.  Natural gas rigs fell by three to 892. Natural gas for
October delivery rose 4.3 cents, or 1 percent, this week to
$3.915 per million British thermal units on the Nymex.  Miscellaneous rigs, which primarily drill for geothermal
energy, were unchanged at nine.  Rigs on land fell by 10 to 1,907, while rigs in inland
waters increased by one to 19.  The offshore rig count fell by 1 to 32.  Canadian rig counts fell for the first time in seven weeks,
by two to 515.  To contact the reporter on this story:
