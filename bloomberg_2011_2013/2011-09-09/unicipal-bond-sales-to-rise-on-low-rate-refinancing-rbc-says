Low interest rates will encourage
municipal borrowers to refinance debt in the last four months of
2011, said RBC Capital Markets LLC, which raised its forecast
for long-term bond sales in the period to $100 billion.  As much as $275 billion of municipal bonds will be sold
this year because of the increase, up from a previous estimate
of $260 billion, Chris Mauro, an RBC analyst, said in a report
today.  There is $166 billion of municipal debt currently eligible
to be refunded, up from $140 billion in the same period last
year, Mauro wrote. More issuance could mean higher yields if a
weakening economy hurts the credit of borrowers and investors
accelerate their exit from tax-exempt mutual funds, he wrote.  “An increase in average monthly issuance to $25 billion
through year-end from $20 billion year-to-date could potentially
put significant pressure on the municipal market,” he said.  The yield on top-rated 20-year tax-exempts was 3.4 percent
today, the lowest since Oct. 27, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Low yields had prompted investors to withdraw money from
municipal-bond mutual funds for six straight weeks through Aug.
30, according to Lipper US Fund Flows. Investors added about
$565 million in the week through yesterday, Lipper said, the
first inflow since July.  State and local governments sold about $129 billion of
fixed-rated municipal debt in the fourth quarter of 2010, the
most in a three-month period since at least 2003, Bloomberg data
show. The flurry came as issuers took advantage of the Build
America Bonds program, which provided a 35 percent federal
subsidy on interest costs, before it ended Dec. 31.  If issuance reaches $275 billion this year, it would
represent 83 percent of the tax-exempt debt sold for all of
2010, Mauro wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
