At least 13 people were killed in
 Nigeria  in an attack in the central Plateau state village of
Tsohuwan Forom, a region racked by fighting between Christian
and Muslim ethnic groups, said Pam Ayuba, a spokesman for the
state government.  “Eight people from one family were killed and two of their
neighbors while three others were killed at Gashishi,” a nearby
settlement, Ayuba said today by phone from Jos, the state
capital. The attacks happened around midnight local time
yesterday, he said.  At least 70 people have been killed in  Plateau state  in
less than two weeks in the latest violence between Christians
and Muslims. Nigeria,  Africa ’s top oil producer and most
populous nation of about 140 million people, is roughly split
between a mainly Muslim north and a predominantly Christian
south.  More than 14,000 people died in ethnic and religious
clashes in the West African nation between 1999 and 2009,
according to the Brussels-based  International Crisis Group .  To contact the reporter on this story:
