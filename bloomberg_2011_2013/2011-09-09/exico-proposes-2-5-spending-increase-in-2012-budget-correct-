(Corrects spending figure proposed in second paragraph.)  The administration of Mexican
President Felipe Calderon is proposing to increase spending in
real terms by 2.5 percent in 2012 while narrowing the deficit to
0.2 percent of gross domestic product.  The  Finance Ministry  submitted a proposal to Congress for
2012 spending of 3.62 trillion pesos ($290 billion),
representing a nominal increase of 9 percent over 2011,
according to a presentation on the ministry’s  website  published
today.  “Mexico needs an income law and spending budget that’s
responsible and promotes economic growth and long-term social
development,” Finance Minister  Ernesto Cordero  said today in
Mexico City after presenting the proposal to lawmakers. “We
can’t take any risks and we can’t make any mistakes.”  Latin America ’s second-biggest economy will expand 4
percent in 2011 and 3.5 percent next year, the ministry’s
document said. The government sees the peso trading at 11.9 per
 U.S. dollar  this year and 12.2 per U.S. next year.  The proposal estimates a  budget deficit  of 36.7 billion
pesos for next year, excluding investments in state-owned oil
company Petroleos Mexicanos, which compares to an proposed
deficit of 42 billion pesos this year.  The government is proposing 395 billion pesos of domestic
debt sales next year and will favor domestic sales to finance
its budget deficit, according to the presentation. Mexico will
sell $7 billion of debt overseas, the ministry said.  Mexico’s government is not proposing any tax changes for
2012, according to the document.  Mexico’s peso posted its first decline in three days today,
weakening 0.4 percent 12.5146 per U.S. dollar at 5 p.m. New York
time, from 12.4638 yesterday. The benchmark IPC stock index fell
1.3 percent to 34,712.38.  To contact the reporter on this story:
