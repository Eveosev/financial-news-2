Central bank chiefs from five
countries in southeastern  Europe  warned of a double-dip
recession in the region and called for fiscal responsibility to
avoid excessive growth of public debt.  The governors of central banks in Macedonia, Montenegro,
Albania,  Serbia  and Bosnia-Herzegovina noted that their
countries still expect growth of the respective economies “but
the growth rates will be significantly lower than in the pre-
crisis years,” they said in a joint statement after a meeting
today in Becici, Montenegro.  “In such conditions, the key challenge is to ensure fiscal
sustainability. In the crisis years so far, the public debt grew
too fast in all countries except in Bosnia-Herzegovina,” they
said in the statement e-mailed by Serbia’s central bank.  To contact the reporters on this story:
