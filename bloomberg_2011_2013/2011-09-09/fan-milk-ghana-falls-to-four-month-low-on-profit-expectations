Fan Milk Ghana Ltd., a maker of ice
cream and dairy products in the West African nation, fell to the
lowest in almost four months as investors speculate the company
won’t post a profit gain in the third quarter.  The shares fell 12 pesewas, or 4.4 percent, to 2.6 cedis by
2:45 p.m. in the capital, Accra, the lowest since May 12.  “Our expectation is for earnings to be flat in the third
quarter, at best a 5 percent increase in profit over the prior
year,” said Randy Mensah, a stock trader at Accra-based
Databank Financial Services Ltd., by phone. “The company
increased prices for some of its products at the beginning of
the year and it is taking time for demand to adjust. The weather
too has not played favourably for the products.”  Fan Milk’s net income for the six months to June 30 was
little changed at 9.9 million cedis ($6.4 million) from 9.8
million cedis a year earlier. Revenue rose to 52.1 million cedis
from 49.2 million cedis, it said on Jul. 22.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
