A basket of emerging-market
currencies that includes the Indian rupee and Indonesian rupiah
followed the Swiss franc’s appreciation against the euro over
the past 20 months, according to Citigroup Inc.  The basket, which also includes the  Singapore dollar  and
Colombian peso, tracked the performance of the franc versus the
euro from January 2010 better than combinations of developed-
world currencies, the analysts including Steven Englander, head
of the Group of 10 foreign-exchange strategy in  New York , wrote
in an e-mailed report.  The franc appreciated 34 percent against the euro from the
start of last year until Sept. 5, before the Swiss authorities
said they would buy unlimited amounts of foreign currency in
order to keep their exchange rate no stronger than 1.20 against
the euro. Investors seeking a haven from concerns over debt in
the euro region have since turned to other currencies including
the Norwegian krone and the Swedish krona, Citigroup said.  “The market has started to look for Swiss-like
currencies” since Switzerland set a limit for the  exchange
rate , the analysts wrote. A basket of developed world currencies
was “disappointing” as a franc substitute, while “the
performance improves a lot” with emerging markets, they said.  The basket for emerging markets was composed of buying the
rupee, rupiah, Singapore dollar and Colombian peso while selling
the Mexican peso, Malaysian ringgit, Turkish lira, Hungarian
forint and the  U.S. dollar .  To contact the reporter on this story:
