Tanzania’s shilling headed for the
biggest weekly drop in four against the dollar.  The currency of East Africa’s second-biggest economy lost
0.1 percent to 1,626.5 per dollar by 12:42 p.m. in  Dar es
Salaam , the commercial capital, taking its depreciation to 0.3
this week, the most since the five days through Aug. 12  Tanzania’s shilling has slumped 8.7 percent this year,
making it Africa’s third-worst performer against the dollar
after Uganda and  Kenya ’s currencies. Tanzania’s inflation rate
climbed to 13 percent in July, the fastest in 15 months, as
energy and food costs surged, the National Bureau of Statistics
said Aug. 15. Higher prices of imports have weakened the
currency.  To contact the reporter on this story:
