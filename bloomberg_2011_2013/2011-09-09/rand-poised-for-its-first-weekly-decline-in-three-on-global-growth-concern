The rand declined to its lowest
level in more than two weeks versus the dollar, set for its
first weekly drop in three, as concern the global economy is
slowing curbed demand for riskier assets.  The currency of  Africa ’s biggest economy depreciated for a
second day, declining 1.1 percent to 7.2436 per dollar at 2:39
p.m. in Johannesburg, extending its retreat this week to 2.5
percent. The rand slipped to 7.2686 per dollar earlier, the
weakest since Aug. 25. Against the euro, the rand slumped for
the first day in four, falling 0.3 percent to 10.0168 per euro.  South African and emerging-market stocks fell for the first
day in three after U.S. President  Barack Obama ’s $447 billion
jobs plan failed to ease global growth concerns. Federal Reserve
Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  warned that policy makers should not
disregard the “fragility” of the economic recovery and
European Central Bank President  Jean-Claude Trichet  said
yesterday that “downside risks” for the region’s economies
have risen.  “There are still a number of headwinds facing the global
growth outlook over the coming quarters,” Standard Bank Group
Ltd. strategists, led by Johannesburg-based Michael Keenan,
wrote in a research note today. “We still believe in selling
into rand strength over the medium term.”  Slower global growth may add to pressure on the central
bank to cut borrowing costs, eroding the rand’s yield advantage.
The Pretoria-based  Reserve Bank  will react “appropriately” to
a global slowdown that threatens growth in the local economy,
Governor Gill Marcus said on Aug. 23.  Rate-Cut Bets  Manufacturing in Africa’s biggest economy slumped 6 percent
in July, the government’s statistics agency reported yesterday.
Gross domestic product growth slowed to 1.3 percent in the
second quarter.  “As the data become more consistently weak through year-
end the Reserve Bank may well have to act,” Peter Attard Montalto, an analyst at Nomura International Plc, said in an e-
mailed note to clients. Nomura sees a 40 percent chance of a
rate cut in the first quarter.  Bonds declined. The 6.75 percent government securities due
2021 weakened 67 cents to 94.08 rand, driving the yield up 10
basis points, or 0.1 percentage point, to 7.629 percent. The
13.5 percent bonds due 2015 fell 42 cents to 124.61 rand,
pushing the yield up 10 basis points to 6.432 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
