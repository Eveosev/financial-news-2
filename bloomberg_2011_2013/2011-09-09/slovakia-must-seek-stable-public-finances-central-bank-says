Slovakia’s government needs to
achieve stable public finances to ensure a balanced or surplus
budget in the “mid-term horizon,” the central bank said.  The government needs to implement structural changes and
aim to increase the flexibility of the economy and support
growth in the long-term, the bank said today in a statement.  To contact the reporters on this story:
