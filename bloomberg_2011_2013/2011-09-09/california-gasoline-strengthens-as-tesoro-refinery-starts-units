California-blend gasoline in  Los
Angeles  strengthened for a second day as  Tesoro Corp. (TSO)  started
units at its Wilmington refinery following a power failure
yesterday.  Carbob in Los Angeles rose 1.25 cents to a premium of 21.25
cents a gallon above gasoline futures traded on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange  at 1:59 p.m. East Coast time, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Prompt delivery fell 8.66 cents to
$2.9986 a gallon.  Tesoro’s 97,000-barrel-a-day Wilmington refinery, south of
Los Angeles, was ramping up to targeted rates after
malfunctioning electrical equipment caused a power failure at
the plant yesterday, Mike Marcy, a spokesman for the San
Antonio-based company, said in an e-mail. The incident affected
“several” units at the refinery, he said.  “Tesoro does not anticipate that the foregoing will have
any impact whatsoever on its ability to fulfill its regional
product supply obligations,” said Marcy, who is based in
Martinez, California.  The premium for Carbob in  San Francisco  widened 4.25 cents,
also to a premium of 21.25 cents over futures.  Conventional, 87-octane gasoline in Portland, Oregon, was
unchanged at 24.25 cents a gallon over futures.  To contact the reporter on this story:
