Tsai Ing-wen, the presidential
candidate of  Taiwan ’s opposition  Democratic Progressive Party ,
named Su Jia-chyuan as her running mate for January’s election.  Su, 54, DPP’s secretary-general, was Taiwan’s interior
minister from 2004 to 2006 and agriculture minister from 2006 to
2008. He was also a magistrate for Pingtung County, an
agricultural and fishing region in Taiwan’s south.  “Su has outstanding performances in his past positions and
has a strong track record,” Tsai said at a news conference in
Taipei today. “He has the ability to touch the hearts of the
grassroots class.”  President Ma Ying-jeou, 61, seeking re-election in January,
is running about even with DPP Chairwoman Tsai, 54, who has
accused him of selling Taiwan short with a policy of
rapprochement “boxed in a frame set by China.” Ma, who in June
named Premier  Wu Den-yih  as his running mate, would get 39.6
percent of votes to Tsai’s 38.1 percent, a poll by the Global
Views Survey Research Center published Aug. 22 shows.  Ma, also KMT chairman, returned his party to power in 2008
after eight years of DPP rule saw increased tensions with China.
The KMT had governed Taiwan for more than 50 years after
retreating to the island in 1949 following defeat at the hands
of Mao Zedong’s communists.  “In the past 30 years, I’ve worked very hard to fight for
the rights of farmers and the agricultural industry,” Su said
at today’s news conference.  2008 Election  In the 2008 presidential election, the KMT beat the DPP 58
percent to 42 percent by pledging direct flights to  China , the
lifting of investment restrictions by Taiwanese companies and
allowing more Chinese visitors to travel to Taiwan.  A separate poll by TVBS Poll Center said Ma has support
from 46 percent of the electorate, against Tsai’s 39 percent.
Tsai has more support from voters aged between 20 and 39. Ma
leads by between 6 percentage points and 18 percentage points
among older groups of voters, who outnumber the under 40s by
10.7 million to 7.3 million, government data show.  The TVBS poll of 1,234 adults between Aug. 11 and Aug. 15
had a margin of error of 2.8 percentage points. The voting age
is 20.  To contact the reporters on this story:
