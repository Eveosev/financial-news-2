Peru ’s benchmark bonds rose, pushing
yields to the lowest in more than two years, after the central
bank signaled it’s ready to cut interest rates for the first
time since 2009 amid slowing global and domestic growth.  The yield on the nation’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol-
denominated bond due August 2020 fell two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 5.41 percent, according to prices compiled
by Bloomberg. That’s the lowest yield since May 2009. The
security’s price rose 0.11 centimo to 116.92 centimos per sol.  The central bank kept its benchmark lending rate at 4.25
percent for a fourth straight month yesterday, citing slowing
domestic growth and the deterioration in global financial
markets. The bank said it will change its policy stance if the
trends continue.  “They left open the possibility of a cut in rates,” said
Manuel Aldave, head of investments at Banco Internacional del
Peru in  Lima . “Prices in the middle part of the curve are still
attractive.”  The central bank forecasts  Latin America ’s sixth-biggest
economy will expand 6.3 percent in 2011, and 6 percent in 2012,
down from previous forecasts of 6.5 percent for both years.
Peruvian growth averaged 7.2 percent over the past five years.  The government has drafted what Finance Minister Miguel Castilla on Sept. 1 called “conservative” 2012 spending plans
in case metal prices drop, and is ready to shore up demand if a
slowdown threatens metal exports and a projected $73 billion of
private investment over the next five years.  Peru’s monthly inflation rate, which touched a three-year
high of 0.79 percent in July, will now stay below 0.25 percent,
the central bank’s research director, Adrian Armas, said today.  The central bank is concerned about a global slowdown that
leads to a fall in commodity prices and reduced demand for
Peru’s exports, Armas told reporters on a conference call.  “This would point to a stronger deceleration in inflation
that could result in a decision by the central bank to lower
 interest rates ,” he said.  The sol fell 0.1 percent to 2.7272 per  U.S. dollar , from
2.7247 yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
