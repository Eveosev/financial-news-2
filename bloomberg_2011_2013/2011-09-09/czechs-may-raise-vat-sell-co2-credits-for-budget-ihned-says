The Czech government may consider
raising value-added tax and selling some of the state’s carbon-
dioxide permits to boost budget revenue next year,  Ihned.cz 
reported, citing Premier Petr Necas.  The Cabinet would debate raising the VAT to 19 percent and
selling between 25 percent and 35 percent of the state’s carbon
emissions allowances if the state budget revenue lags behind
projections and threatens fiscal targets next year, the news
website said, cited Necas as saying in an interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
