The rate London-based banks say they
can borrow at in Swiss francs for three months climbed to the
highest level in two weeks, according to the British Bankers’
Association.  The rate increased to 0.00667 percent today from 0.00500
percent yesterday, the BBA said. That’s the highest level since
Aug. 25. It fell to a record low 0.00333 percent on Sept. 5, the
data show. No lender among a panel of 12 contributors submitted
a rate below zero today, the data show.  The  Swiss National Bank  lowered its target for three-month
franc Libor to “as close to zero as possible” on Aug. 3.  To contact the reporter on this story:
