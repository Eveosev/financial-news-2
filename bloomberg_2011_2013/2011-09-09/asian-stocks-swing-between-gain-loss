Asian stocks fell, with the regional
benchmark index headed for its first weekly loss in three weeks,
after Japanese machinery orders declined, and as  China  reported
inflation remained above 6 percent and growth in industrial
production slowed.  Fanuc Corp. (6954)  led Japanese machinery makers lower after an
industry group said yesterday that machine orders fell.
 Industrial & Commercial Bank of China (601398)  Ltd. slumped 0.8 percent.
Unimicron Technology Corp. jumped 6.9 percent in Taipei after
saying sales rose last month.  China Yurun Food Group Ltd. (1068) , the
nation’s second-biggest listed meat processor, advanced 1.6
after addressing a report over pork additives.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index fell 0.9 percent to 120.89 at
7:54 p.m. in Tokyo after rising as much as 0.4 percent. The
gauge slumped 8.6 percent last month, the most since May 2010,
amid concern global economic growth is slowing as  Europe ’s
sovereign-debt crisis spreads and after  Standard & Poor’s  cut
the U.S. credit rating.  “The inflation controls have curbed industrial growth,”
in China, Richard Chen, a strategist at Jianghai Securities Co.,
said in  Shanghai . “This will hurt the outlook for companies’
earnings as tightening measures won’t ease in the near term.
Investors are selling into rallies as concerns over the economic
slowdown may drag the index lower.”  On Course to Decline  The MSCI Asia Pacific index is on course to fall 2.6
percent this week, its first weekly decline since Aug. 19. All
10 industry groups on the measure fell. About five stocks fell
for every four that climbed on the 1,017-member index.  Japan ’s  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average slid 0.6 percent after the
Cabinet Office said the nation’s economy contracted more than
the government initially estimated.  South Korea ’s Kospi Index fell 1.8 percent, the biggest
decline among benchmark measures in the region. South Korean
financial markets will close on Sept. 12 and 13 for a holiday.  Australia ’s S&P/ASX 200 Index advanced 0.2 percent. Hong
Kong’s Hang Seng Index declined 0.2 percent, reversing an
earlier gain of 0.9 percent. China’s Shanghai Composite Index
sank 1.19 points to decline less than 0.1 percent.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index lost 0.4 percent
today. In  New York , the index fell 1.1 percent yesterday as
Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke warned that policy
makers should not disregard the “fragility” of the economic
recovery and must put the federal government’s finances on a
“sustainable trajectory” over the long term.  ‘Better Than Nothing’  Obama’s plan “is certainly better than nothing,” said
Matt Riordan, who helps manage almost $6.6 billion in Sydney at
Paradice Investment Management Pty. “But it has to be kept in
mind that this is a package being implemented in a period of
forced fiscal austerity.”  In Japan, Fanuc led machinery stocks lower, dropping 7.6
percent to 10,730 yen. The Japan Machine Tool Builders’
Association said machinery tool orders fell 12.7 percent in
August to 98.96 billion yen ($1.3 billion) from July.  Komatsu Ltd. (6301)  slid 4.5 percent to 1,797 yen. Toshiba Machine
Co. sank 7.9 percent to 328 yen. Industrial stocks posted the
biggest drop among the 10 industry groups on the MSCI Asia
Pacific Index, and were also the biggest drag on the measure.  China Data  Chinese stocks declined today after the country’s National
Bureau of Statistics said inflation for August stood at 6.2
percent after rising 6.5 percent in July. Industrial production
in August rose 13.5 percent from a year earlier, the statistics
bureau said, down from a 14 percent increase the previous month
and also less than the 13.7 percent median estimate in a
Bloomberg News survey.  Industrial & Commercial Bank slumped 0.8 percent to HK$4.95
in  Hong Kong , the third-biggest drag on the Hang Seng index.
Belle International Holdings Ltd., a Chinese retailer of women’s
shoes, dropped 1.9 percent to HK$14.60. Aluminum Corporation of
China Ltd., the nation’s biggest producer of the metal by market
value, lost 1.7 percent to HK$4.65.  Inflation is “down but not out,” said Alistair Thornton,
a Beijing-based economist with IHS Global Insight. “It may have
peaked but it will remain elevated for significant period of
time and this will complicate monetary policy.”  Among stocks that gained, Unimicron Technology jumped 6.9
percent to NT$42.35 in Taipei, the third-biggest increase on the
MSCI Asia Pacific Index. The company yesterday said sales in
August rose 4.1 percent on last year.  In Hong Kong, China Yurun increased 1.6 percent to
HK$14.16, after plunging 16 percent yesterday. The company
issued a statement addressing a newspaper report yesterday that
its pork products contained an illegal additive.  To contact the reporter on this story:
