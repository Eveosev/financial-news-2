Indonesia ’s government bonds
completed a third weekly advance on speculation foreign
investors will add to holdings of the nation’s debt to take
advantage of the country’s growth outlook and relatively high
yields.  Bank Indonesia left its benchmark  interest rate  unchanged
at 6.75 percent yesterday to boost growth, as predicted by all
10 economists surveyed by Bloomberg. Benchmark rates are a
maximum 0.25 percent in the U.S. and  Japan . Overseas holdings of
Indonesia’s sovereign bonds rose 26 percent this year to 247.2
trillion rupiah ($28.8 billion) through Sept. 5, debt management
office data show.  “If you look at BI’s stance yesterday, they are not
alarmed about negative shocks from  Europe  and the U.S.,” said
Emmanuel Ng, a currency strategist at Oversea-Chinese Banking
Corp. in  Singapore . “Indonesia is a story of growth and that is
supporting inflows into bonds.”  The yield on the 8.25 percent securities due July 2021
declined 43 basis points, the biggest weekly decline this year,
to 6.42 percent today, according to prices from the Inter-Dealer
Market Association. Onshore financial markets were shut from Aug.
29 to Sept. 2 for the Id-ul-Fitr holidays.  Gross domestic product will increase 6.5 percent this year,
the most since 1998, President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono said
last month.  The rupiah was little changed from Aug. 26 at 8,573 per
dollar as of 3:25 p.m. in Jakarta, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The currency dropped 0.1 percent from yesterday.  The rupiah has climbed 4.7 percent this year, the second-
best performer among Asia’s 10-most traded currencies excluding
the yen. The currency will continue to strengthen on capital
inflows,  Bank Indonesia  said in a statement after its rate
decision yesterday. Overseas investors bought $64 million more
Indonesian stocks than they sold in the first four days of the
week, according to exchange data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
