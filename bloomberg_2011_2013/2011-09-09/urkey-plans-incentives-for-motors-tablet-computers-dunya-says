Turkey  is planning incentives for
local production of motors and tablet computers, Deputy Prime
Minister Ali Babacan was quoted as saying by  Dunya  newspaper.  Turkey imports too many motors and should encourage local
production for sustainable growth and competitiveness, the
Istanbul-based business newspaper quoted Babacan as saying.
Local production of tablet computers should also be encouraged
as the country plans to distribute the devices to students
nationwide, Babacan said.  The incentive program should be completed near the end of
the year, he said, according to Dunya.  To contact the reporter on this story:
