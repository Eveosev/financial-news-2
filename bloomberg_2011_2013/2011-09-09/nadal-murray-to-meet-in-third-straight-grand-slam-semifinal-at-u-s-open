Defending champion  Rafael Nadal  of
Spain defeated American Andy Roddick in straight sets today to
reach the semfinals of the U.S. Open.  Nadal won 6-2, 6-1, 6-3 and moved on to face  Andy Murray  of
Britain in their third straight Grand Slam semifinal. Murray
earlier today defeated John Isner of the U.S. in four sets,
leaving the U.S. Open without an American man in the semifinals
for the fifth straight year.  Nadal won both of the earlier Grand Slam semifinals with
Murray this year at the French Open and Wimbledon.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
