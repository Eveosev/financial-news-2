MetLife Inc. (MET) , the U.S. life insurer
expanding its mortgage business, had the servicer-quality rating
on its home-loan business cut by Moody’s Investors Service.  “The rating downgrade is mainly due to deterioration in
call-center metrics for the  customer-service  department,
indicating an insufficiently staffed customer-service call
center,” Moody’s said today in a statement. “Abandonment rates
in 2010 reached 30 percent for customer service, performance
levels that are significantly worse than its peers.”  MetLife is adding to its lending and mortgage-servicing
businesses as near-record low  interest rates  pressure returns on
insurance sales. New York-based MetLife, the biggest U.S. life
insurer, uses television ads to sell so-called reverse mortgages
to older homeowners. In June, the company agreed to supply KB
Home with loans for first-time buyers.  MetLife’s servicer-quality rating was cut to SQ3+ from SQ2-
by Moody’s. The rating firm said it also withdrew the grade at
MetLife’s request.  “MetLife Bank consistently has received high servicing
quality ratings from the Department of Housing and Urban
Development and  Freddie Mac ,” said David Hammarstrom, a MetLife
spokesman, in an e-mailed statement. “MetLife Home Loans had
been rated by Moody’s because it had sub-serviced private label
mortgage backed securities on behalf of First Tennessee Bank,
N.A. Given that we are no longer sub-servicing these securities,
we requested that Moody’s withdraw its rating.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
