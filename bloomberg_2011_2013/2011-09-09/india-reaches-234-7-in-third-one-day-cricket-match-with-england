India  rebounded from a poor start to
reach 234-7 in the third one-day cricket international against
 England  at the Oval in London.  Ravindra Jadeja and captain MS Dhoni teamed for a 112-run
sixth wicket stand for the visitors, who recovered from 25-4.
Jadeja was top scorer with 78, while Dhoni had 69 and
Ravichandran Ashwin was 36 not out.  James Anderson  took 3-48 for England and also dismissed
Rahul Dravid on a runout.  England won the rain-shortened second game in the five-
match series by seven wickets after the opener was abandoned
because of rain. Itâ€™s already swept a four-match Test series and
won a Twenty20 match.  To contact the reporter on this story:
