Asian stocks fell this week,
snapping a fortnight of advance, as exporters dropped on
speculation the world’s largest economy is headed toward
recession and banks slid amid concern  Europe  may fail to contain
its sovereign debt crisis.  Honda Motor Co., a carmaker with more than 40 percent of
its revenue in North America, plunged 6.4 percent in  Tokyo  after
a report showed the U.S. job market stalled in August.  BHP
Billiton Ltd. (BHP)  sank 2.9 percent in Sydney.  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) ,
Europe’s largest lender by market value, slumped 3.3 percent in
 Hong Kong  after the cost of insuring against default on European
sovereign and financial debt surged to records.  Fanuc Corp. (6954) 
tumbled 15 percent after an industry group said growth in
machine-tool orders slowed.  “It’s clear the  U.S. economy  needed more stimulus as
there’s a limit to what monetary policy can do,” said  Stephen Halmarick , Sydney-based head of investment markets research at
Colonial First State Global Asset Management, which oversees
about $150 billion. “There’s growing concern that the
sovereign-debt crisis in the EU is now manifesting into a sharp
slowdown in the economy and a banking crisis,”  The MSCI  Asia  Pacific Index fell 2.7 percent this week to
120.78, snapping a 3.9 percent two-week advance. The gauge
tumbled 8.6 percent last month amid escalating concern over
Europe’s debt crisis and after  Standard & Poor’s  downgraded the
U.S.’s credit rating. Stocks in the Asian benchmark are valued
at about 11.9 times estimated earnings on average, compared with
11.5 times for the S&P 500 and 9.3 times for the Stoxx 600.  Nikkei, Kospi  Japan ’s  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average dropped 2.4 percent in a
week when the Cabinet Office also said Japan’s economy
contracted more than an initial government estimate. Australia’s
S&P/ASX 200 Index slipped 1.1 percent after a statistics bureau
report showed the nation’s employers unexpectedly cut jobs for a
second straight month in August.  South Korea’s  Kospi Index (KOSPI)  slid 2.9 percent and Hong Kong’s
 Hang Seng Index (HSI)  retreated 1.7 percent. The Shanghai Composite
Index slid 1.2 percent this week.  Honda, which counts North America as its biggest market for
sales, plunged 6.4 percent to 2,347 yen in Tokyo.  Canon Inc. (7751) ,
which earns more than 80 percent of its sales overseas, declined
2.9 percent to 3,490 yen.  James Hardie Industries SE (JHX) , a building
materials supplier that gets almost 70 percent of sales from the
U.S., sank 4.2 percent to A$5.78 in Sydney.  A report Sept. 2 showed U.S. payrolls were unchanged in
August, the weakest reading since September 2010. The median
forecast in a Bloomberg News survey called for an increase of
68,000.  ‘Scary Report’  “It was a scary report,” Dan North, chief U.S. economist
at Euler Hermes ACI in Owings Mills, Maryland, said in an
interview from  Singapore  with Susan Li on Bloomberg Television
on Sept. 5. “When you get to negative job growth, which we’re
very close to now, it means you’re already in a recession.”  Stocks fell even as U.S. President Barack Obama outlined a
jobs plan that would inject $447 billion into the economy, and
Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said policymakers will
discuss ways to boost growth at their next meeting.  Fed officials gather for a two-day meeting on Sept. 20 that
was expanded from the one day originally scheduled to “allow a
fuller discussion” of the economy and the central bank’s
possible policy response.  BHP, Jiangxi  BHP Billiton, the world’s No. 1 mining company and
Australia’s biggest oil producer, fell 2.9 percent to A$37.91 in
Sydney. Rio Tinto Group, the second-largest miner by sales, slid
1.1 percent to A$71.25. In Hong Kong, Jiangxi Copper Co.,
 China ’s No. 1 producer of the metal, slumped 4.6 percent to
HK$20.95, while Chinese oil explorer  Cnooc Ltd. (883)  tumbled 9.3
percent to HK$14.  Belle International Holdings Ltd. (1880) , a Chinese retailer of
women’s shoes, plunged 10 percent to HK$14.60 in Hong Kong and
 Tencent Holdings Ltd. (700) , a Shenzhen-based Internet company, lost
1.5 percent to HK$184.50.  China’s inflation eased in August from a three-year high,
the National Bureau of Statistics said in Beijing on Sept. 9.
Still, consumer prices climbed 6.2 percent from a year earlier.
A separate report showed industrial output growth in China
trailed estimates.  Asian stocks also slipped this week after an election loss
for German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s party and reports of a
rift between Greece and the  International Monetary Fund  fueled
concern that support for bailing out indebted European nations
is waning. Later in the week, European Central Bank President
Jean-Claude Trichet said “downside risks” for the region have
risen, while resisting calls to lower  interest rates .  Financial Stocks  HSBC fell 3.3 percent to HK$64.95 in Hong Kong.  Korea
Exchange Bank (004940)  retreated 4.3 percent to 7,590 won in Seoul.
 Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. (8306) , Japan’s biggest lender by
market value, declined 2.9 percent to 332 yen in Tokyo after the
cost of insuring against default on European sovereign and
financial debt surged to records.  Investors drove yields higher on the bonds of Greece,
Portugal, Spain and Italy early in the week on doubts Europe’s
leaders will be able to stop the crisis spreading. The yield on
the Greek two-year note rose above its price for the first time
on Sept. 5, indicating mounting concern the nation will default
on the debt.  Lasting Solution  “Volatility is likely to remain high until there’s clarity
around Europe’s ability to work out a lasting solution,” said
Nader Naeimi, a Sydney-based strategist for AMP Capital
Investors Ltd., which manages almost $100 billion. “Right now,
it seems policy makers are going in the opposite direction.
While the fundamentals in Asia are in better shape than
elsewhere, shares here will get caught up in the crossfire.”  Fanuc, Japan’s No. 1 maker of controls used to run machine
tools, fell 15 percent to 10,730 yen, after the Japan Machinery
Tool Builders’ Association said growth in Japanese orders slowed
in August, falling 12.7 percent from July. A separate Cabinet
Office report this week said Japanese machinery orders fell 8.2
percent in July after rising 7.7 percent in June.  Komatsu Ltd. (6301) , the world’s No. 2 maker of construction
equipment and Japan’s largest construction machinery maker, sank
14 percent to 1,797 yen.  Technology Shares  Among stocks that advanced this week,  Hynix Semiconductor
Inc. (000660) , the world’s second-largest maker of computer memory,
jumped 4.2 percent to 19,900 won in Seoul, leading some
technology stocks higher on speculation chip prices will recover.
Samsung Electronics Co. gained 1.4 percent to 780,000 won.  The price of the benchmark DDR3 2-gigabit DRAM has fallen 3
percent this month after falling 14 percent in August, according
to data from Taipei-based Dramexchange Technology Inc., operator
of Asia’s largest spot market for semiconductors.  “There’s some consensus that the chip market is near its
bottom,” Ahn Seong Ho, an analyst at Hanwha Securities Co. who
covers technology stocks, said in Seoul.  To contact the reporters on this story:
