Ceramic Industries Ltd. (CRM)  suspended a
plan to build a 500 million-rand ($70 million) tile plant
because of difficulties getting prospecting and mining permits
from  South Africa â€™s Department of Mineral Resources,  Business
Report  said, citing Chief Executive Officer Nick Booth.  The license would ensure the company secures clay deposits,
the Johannesburg-based newspaper reported. The project is on
hold for another year, Booth told Business Report.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
