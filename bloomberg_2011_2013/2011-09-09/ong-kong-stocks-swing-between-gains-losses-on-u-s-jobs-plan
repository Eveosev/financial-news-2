Hong Kong stocks fell, sending its
Hang Seng Index to its first weekly decline in three, as
expansion of  China ’s industrial output slowed, overshadowing
optimism about U.S. economic growth.  China Railway Construction Corp., a builder of the nation’s
rail links, fell 1.1 percent. Aluminum Corp. of China Ltd., the
nation’s biggest producer of the metal by market value, slid 1.7
percent.  Belle International Holdings Ltd. (1880) , a Chinese retailer
of women’s shoes, slid for a second day, losing 1.9 percent,
after saying management staffs plan to sell existing shares.  “The inflation controls have curbed industrial growth,”
said Richard Chen, a strategist at Jianghai Securities Co., said
in  Shanghai . “This will hurt the outlook for companies’
earnings as tightening measures won’t ease in the near term.”  The Hang Seng Index slid 0.2 percent to 19,866.63 at the
close, with about twice as many stocks falling as advancing in
the 46-member gauge. The index fell 1.7 percent for the week.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index of Chinese companies
listed in Hong Kong declined 0.3 percent to 10,468.89.  The  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  tumbled 14 percent this year on concern
global growth will stall amid China’s monetary policy tightening
measures, slowing U.S. economic growth and  Europe ’s debt crisis.
Shares on the index traded at 10.6 times forecast earnings,
compared with 11.9 times for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  China Railway Construction slid 1.1 percent to HK$3.64.
Aluminum Corp. of China dropped 1.7 percent to HK$4.65. Anhui
Conch Cement Co., the nation’s biggest producer of the building
material by market value, retreated 0.9 percent to HK$26.70.  China’s industrial production slowed for a second month,
rising 13.5 percent in August from a year earlier, according to
the statistics bureau. That compared with the 13.7 percent
median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey.  Consumer prices climbed 6.2 percent in August from a year
earlier, matching the 6.2 percent median forecast in a Bloomberg
News survey of 31 economists. Prices gained 6.5 percent in July.  Belle International dropped 1.9 percent to HK$14.60. The
shares fell the most in more than 2 1/2 years yesterday after
saying managers including Chief Executive Officer Sheng Baijiao
planned to sell shares.  Among stocks that rose,  Yue Yuen Industrial Holdings Ltd. (551) ,
which makes shoes for Nike Inc., gained 1.6 percent to HK$21.80.
Li & Fung Ltd., a supplier of toys and clothes to Wal-Mart
Stores Inc., advanced 1.5 percent to HK$14.84.  President  Barack Obama  called on Congress to pass a jobs
plan that would inject $447 billion into the economy through
infrastructure spending, subsidies to local governments to stem
teacher layoffs, and cutting in half the payroll taxes paid by
workers and small-business owners.  “The amount of the U.S. stimulus package was bigger than
market expectation, which should be positive for the market,”
said  Castor Pang , head of research at Core-Pacific Yamaichi
International Ltd. in Hong Kong.  Futures on the Hang Seng Index dropped 0.7 percent to
19,723. The HSI Volatility Index sank 1.1 percent to 31.49,
indicating options traders expect a swing of 9 percent in the
Hang Seng Index in the next 30 days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
