Stanley Black & Decker Inc. (SWK) , the
largest U.S. toolmaker, completed its 7.6 billion kronor ($1.2
billion) acquisition of Niscayah AB, bolstering its presence in
video surveillance and fire-alarm systems.  The purchase will generate savings of $80 million annually
and may boost earnings per share by 20 cents in the first year
and 45 cents in the third year,  New Britain , Connecticut-based
Stanley Black & Decker said today in a statement.  Stanley Black & Decker in June outbid  Securitas AB (SECUB) , which
offered $910 million. With the purchase of Stockholm-based
Niscayah, Stanley Black & Decker aims to boost sales of
electronic security doors and alarms in  Europe .  The deal received backing by an independent committee of
Niscayah’s board, shareholders with about 19.5 percent of the
stock and  Melker Schorling AB (MELK) , the second-biggest shareholder by
votes in Securitas and Niscayah.  Securitas spun off three of its divisions between 2006 and
2008, including Niscayah, then called Securitas Systems.  Stanley Black & Decker already offers electronic security
services in Europe. In March 2010, it bought ADT France, an
acquisition that was an “indication” of its “continuing
strategic intent to expand the security segment
internationally,” according to its annual report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
