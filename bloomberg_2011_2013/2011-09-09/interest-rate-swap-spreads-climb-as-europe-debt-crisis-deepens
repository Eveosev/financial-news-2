Two-year interest-rate swap spreads,
a gauge of fear in the debt markets, rose to the highest since
July 2010 as the cost to protect European financial and
sovereign debt surged.  The difference, or spread, between the two-year swap rate
and the comparable-maturity Treasury note yield climbed 3.13
basis points to 34.32 basis points as of 12:02 p.m. in  New York .
The measure has climbed from 23.37 since the end of July as
investor concern has mounted that  Europe â€™s fiscal imbalances
will spread and harm bank balance sheets.  The Markit iTraxx Financial Index of credit-default swaps
on 25 banks and insurers increased 18 basis points to 282,
according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. at 2:30 p.m. in  London . The
gauge, which is up from 246 basis points Sept. 2, is heading for
the biggest weekly increase since March 2009. The Markit iTraxx
SovX Western Europe Index of swaps on 15 governments climbed six
basis points to 328.5.  To contact the reporter on this story:
