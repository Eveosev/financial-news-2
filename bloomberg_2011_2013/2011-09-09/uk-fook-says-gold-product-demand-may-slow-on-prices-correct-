(Corrects to refer to gold product instead of jewelry in
headline and first paragraph in story dated Sept. 7.)  Demand for gold products may slow if
prices surge, Luk Fook Holdings (International) Ltd. Chief
Financial Officer Paul Law said in an interview with
Bloomberg Television.  Some consumers may delay purchases, he said. Others may buy
on expectations of further price gains, he said.  The Hong Kong-based jewelry maker sometimes adjusts prices
“a few times” a day because of volatility in gold’s value, he
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
