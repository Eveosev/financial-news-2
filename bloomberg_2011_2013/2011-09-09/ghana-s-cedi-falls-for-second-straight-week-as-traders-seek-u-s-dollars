Ghana ’s cedi headed for its second
straight weekly decline against the dollar as traders bought the
U.S. currency to import goods for resale in West Africa’s
largest economy after  Nigeria .  The currency of the world’s second-biggest cocoa producer
depreciated 0.6 percent to 1.5424 by 11:43 a.m. in Accra, the
capital, for a weekly drop of 1 percent, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  “It is running to the end of year so you see the small-
and medium-sized enterprises trying to buy the dollars to take
stock of goods before Christmas shopping begins,” Abdoulaye
Karamoko, a currency trader at the local unit of Standard
Chartered Bank Plc, said in a telephone interview today.  The cedi may close at 1.5450 today if the central bank
refrains from selling dollars, Lourens Harmse, a currency trader
at Absa Capital Ltd. in Johannesburg, said by phone. “I see no
selling interest,” he said. “There’s actually demand
onshore.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
