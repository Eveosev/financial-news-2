Following is the text of
 Canada 's
labor force survey released by  Statistics Canada .  Employment was little changed for the second
consecutive month in August and the unemployment rate
edged up 0.1 percentage points to 7.3%.  In the past 12 months, employment has grown by 1.3%
(+223,000), primarily in Ontario and  Alberta , and among
private sector employees. Over this period, full-time
employment increased 2.2% (+300,000), part-time work
declined 2.3% (-77,000) and total actual hours worked rose
by 2.6%.  In August, there were employment losses in
construction; transportation and warehousing; and natural
resources. These declines were offset by an increase in
health care and social assistance.  Employment increased in Nova Scotia in August, while it
declined in Newfoundland and Labrador and Saskatchewan.  There were employment increases among people aged 25 to
54, but these gains were offset by losses among those aged
55 and over.  This summer, the average unemployment rate for students
aged 15 to 24 was 17.2%, slightly above the rate of 16.9%
recorded in the summer of 2010. In comparison, the rates
in the summers of 2006 to 2008 were below 14%.  Declines in several industries  Employment in construction fell by 24,000 in August.
Compared with 12 months earlier, however, employment in
this industry is up 3.0% (+37,000).  In transportation and warehousing, employment declined
by 14,000. Despite the loss in August, this industry has
posted the highest growth rate of all industries at 6.3%
(+51,000) in the past 12 months.  Employment in natural resources declined for the second
consecutive month in August, down by 12,000. With these
recent declines, employment is 26,000 below its level of
August 2010.  In health care and social assistance, employment rose
by 50,000 in August, more than offsetting the decline in
July. This industry has grown by 2.9% over the past 12
months, continuing a long-term upward trend.  Employment in manufacturing was little changed in
August. Over the past 12 months, employment in the
industry has risen by 40,000 (+2.3%).  Provincial summary  Employment declined by 3,400 in Newfoundland and
Labrador in August, leaving employment up slightly from 12
months earlier (+0.7%). As more people searched for work
in August, the unemployment rate increased by 1.8
percentage points to 13.7%.  In Saskatchewan, employment declined by 3,000 in
August. The unemployment rate fell 0.4 percentage points
to 4.5%, as fewer people participated in the labour
market. Employment levels in the province were down 0.5%
compared with 12 months earlier.  Employment increased by 4,100 in Nova Scotia, pushing
the unemployment rate down 0.6 percentage points to 8.9%.
Compared with 12 months earlier, employment is up 0.6%.  In  Quebec , while employment was little changed in
August, the unemployment rate increased by 0.4 percentage
points to 7.6%, the result of more people searching for
work. Over the past 12 months, employment increased by
1.0%, lower than the national average of 1.3%.  There was little employment change in Alberta and
Ontario in August, and their unemployment rates remained
unchanged at 5.6% and 7.5%, respectively. However, over
the year, both Alberta and Ontario had employment growth
above the national average, with Alberta leading the way
at 4.2% (+86,000) and Ontario posting the second highest
growth rate of 1.5% (+102,000).  Increases among core-aged workers offset by declines among
older workers  Employment increased among workers aged 25 to 54 years
in August, up 23,000. This brings employment gains from 12
months earlier to 116,000 (+1.0%).  Employment declined by 25,000 among workers aged 55 and
over. Despite this decline, employment for this age group
was up 3.2% (+94,000) in the past 12 months.  Employment among youths aged 15 to 24 was little
changed in August, with employment 0.6% (+14,000) higher
than in August 2010.  Summer labour market for students  From May to August, the Labour Force Survey collects
labour market information about young people aged 15 to 24
who were attending school full time in March and intend to
return to school in the fall. The published estimates are
not seasonally adjusted; therefore, comparisons can only
be made on a year-over-year basis.  This summer, the average unemployment rate between May
and August for students aged 15 to 24 was 17.2%, slightly
above the rate of 16.9% recorded in the summer of 2010. In
comparison, the rates in the summers of 2006 to 2008 were
below 14%.  Compared with the previous summer, the unemployment
rate was virtually unchanged for 17 to 19 year-olds and
for 20 to 24 year-olds, at 16.4% and 10.3%, respectively.
However, the unemployment rate of 15 to 16 year-olds was
30.7%, up 2.6 percentage points from the summer of 2010.  The average number of hours worked at all jobs during
the summer of 2011 by students aged 15 to 24 was 24.0
hours per week, slightly higher than for the summer of
2010 at 23.7 hours and among the lowest since data were
first collected in 1977.  Note to readers  Labour Force Survey (LFS) estimates are based on a
sample, and are therefore subject to sampling variability.
Estimates for smaller geographic areas or industries will
have more variability. For an explanation of sampling
variability of estimates, and how to use standard errors
to assess this variability, consult the "Data quality"
section of the publication Labour Force Information (71-
001-X, free).  Seasonal adjustment and educational services  Unless otherwise stated, this release presents
seasonally adjusted data, which facilitates comparisons by
removing the effects of seasonal variations.  The LFS seasonal adjustment process removes the
"average" seasonal pattern in the monthly data, according
to trends seen in the previous few years. While there have
been large movements in educational services employment in
summer months in recent years, there has not been a
consistent pattern in the direction or magnitude of these
changes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
