Taiwan paid 47 percent more to
import liquefied natural gas in August while purchases rose 1.7
percent from a year earlier, according to data from the
 Directorate General of Customs.   Asia’s third-biggest LNG buyer imported about 1.17 million
metric tons of the fuel in August and paid an average $747 a ton
for the fuel, according to the data on the customs website. That
is equivalent to about $14.36 per million British thermal units,
or almost four times the benchmark gas price in the U.S.  Term supplies, typically indexed to crude- oil prices , from
Indonesia in the month were the most expensive at about $979 a
ton, according to customs data. Oil prices in New York have
climbed about 20 percent in the past year to $89 a barrel.  Taiwan bought three spot cargoes from Nigeria and
 Equatorial Guinea  for an average price of $785 a ton, according
to the data. That’s about $4.75 per million Btu higher than
front month U.K. gas prices, used to price spot supplies to
 Asia , according to calculations based on Bloomberg data.  Taiwan purchased six spot shipments from the Atlantic Ocean
area in August 2010 for an average $424 a ton, according to
customs data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
