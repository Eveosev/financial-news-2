The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index may
sink to as low as 970 because Wall Street analysts’ earnings
estimates are too optimistic, according to MKM Partners LLC’s
Michael Darda.  The 2012 forecast for  S&P 500  company profits of about $108
a share may have to come down by as much as 30 percent, said
Darda, chief market strategist at the Stamford, Connecticut-
based research and trading firm. He cited the history of U.S.
business cycles and the relationship between bond yields and
earnings in making the prediction.  “We believe the S&P 500 will fall to 970-1,030 before
bottoming,” Darda wrote in today’s report titled “Profit
Squeeze Coming.” He added, “If conditions are less favorable
than average, the S&P 500 could surely fall more.”  The S&P 500 has declined as much as 18 percent from a
three-year high in April amid concern  Europe ’s debt crisis is
spreading and the  U.S. economy  is stalling. The benchmark index
for U.S. equities fell today on speculation Greece could default
on its debt and deepen an economic slowdown. The gauge declined
3.1 percent to 1,149.76 as of 2:56 p.m. in  New York .  The average length of a U.S. business cycle is five years,
and at the peak earnings estimates on average overshoot by 27
percent, Darda said. Profits at S&P 500 companies last peaked at
$84.67 a share in 2007 and are forecast to reach $99.96 this
year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The  bond market  also points to a potential drop in
earnings, Darda said. Investors demanded about 400 basis points
more to hold high-yield debt than owning AAA-rated debt,
compared with a spread of about 150 basis points earlier in the
year, he said. A basis point is one one-hundredth of a
percentage point.  “That magnitude of the rise tends to be associated with
about a 30 percent fall in earnings estimates during the
quarters that follow,” Darda said.  -- Editors: Joanna Ossinger,  Jeff Sutherland   To contact the reporters for this story:
