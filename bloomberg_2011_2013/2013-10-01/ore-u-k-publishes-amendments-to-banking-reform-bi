to the failure of a bank, and more stringent approval regime for

in prison and/or unlimited fine

failures  through tools including “electrified” ringfence and a
“bail-in” mechanism
* Government to bring forward amendments, during House of Lords
committee stage, to establish utility-style regulatory regime
for payments systems to tackle barriers to new entrants

financial system that supports the British economy, businesses
and consumers,” Treasury says  To contact the reporter on this story:
