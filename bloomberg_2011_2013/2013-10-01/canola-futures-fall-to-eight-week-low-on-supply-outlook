Canola futures fell to the lowest in
almost eight weeks on signs that farmers will harvest a record
crop in  Canada , the world’s largest grower.  Canada’s agriculture agency on Sept. 18 boosted its
production  forecast  to 14.78 million metric tons from 14.6
million tons projected in August. In provincial yield reports,
 Saskatchewan , the largest grower, cited above-average results,
and  Alberta  said findings were “exceptional with the quantities
being the highest ever.”  “Production is going to be huge, and yields are going to
be through the roof,” Tony Tryhuk, a branch manager of the
commodity futures-trading division at  RBC Dominion Securities ,
said in a telephone interview from Winnipeg. “There are some
people who are floating numbers” as high as 18 million tons of
production, he said.  Canola futures for November settlement fell 0.9 percent to
close at C$477.40 ($462.33) a ton at 1:36 p.m. on ICE Futures
Exchange in Winnipeg. Earlier, the price touched $476.70, the
lowest for a most-active contract since Aug. 7. The oilseed has
declined 19 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
