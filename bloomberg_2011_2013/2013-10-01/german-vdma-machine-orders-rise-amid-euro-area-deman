German plant and machinery orders
rose in August as demand from the 17-nation euro area surged,
the VDMA machine-makers’ association said.  Orders, adjusted for inflation, increased 6 percent from a
year earlier, VDMA said today in an e-mailed statement. Domestic
orders rose 2 percent and orders from abroad surged 9 percent,
with those from the euro area jumping 31 percent.  The euro region,  Germany ’s biggest export market,  emerged 
from its longest-ever recession in the second quarter and
European Central Bank president  Mario Draghi  expects the
currency bloc’s economy to further recover by the end of the
year. Economic confidence rose more than forecast in September.  Today’s numbers “are largely affected by orders in the
large-scale business,” VDMA chief economist  Ralph Wiechers  said
in the statement. “The increase is encouraging but, in general,
one shouldn’t overestimate the results from the August holiday
month.”  Over the three-month period from June to August orders fell
1 percent from a year ago, VDMA said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
