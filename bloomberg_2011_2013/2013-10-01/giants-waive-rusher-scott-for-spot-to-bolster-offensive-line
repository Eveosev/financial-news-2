The winless New York Giants used a
roster opening created when they waived running back Da’Rel Scott to add center Dallas Reynolds to an offensive line
depleted by injuries.  Offensive linemen David Baas and Chris Snee both missed the
Giants’ Sept. 29 loss to the Kansas City Chiefs due to injury
and David Diehl hasn’t played this season as he recovers from
thumb surgery. Snee probably will have season-ending surgery to
repair an injured hip, the Star-Ledger of  Newark , New Jersey,
reported yesterday, citing unidentified people familiar with the
guard’s situation.  Reynolds, 29, started 14 games at center last year with the
Philadelphia Eagles after two seasons on the team’s practice
squad, the Giants said in an e-mailed release yesterday.  A seventh-round selection by the Giants in the 2011
National Football League draft, Scott carried the ball a career-high 16 times this season for 56 yards, second on the team
behind David Wilson. Scott also caught a touchdown pass in a
loss to the Denver Broncos this year.  The Giants host the Eagles (1-3) on Oct. 6 at MetLife
Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey.  To contact the reporters on this story:
