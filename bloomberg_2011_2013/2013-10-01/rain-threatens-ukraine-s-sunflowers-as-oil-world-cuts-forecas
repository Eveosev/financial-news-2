Global sunflower seed production may
be less than expected as wet weather delays the harvest in
Ukraine and  Russia  and leaves crops at risk of damage, Hamburg-based Oil World said.  World production of sunflower seed may be 39 million metric
tons or less in the 2013-14 season, below a previous forecast
for a record 40.2 million tons, the researcher said in an e-mailed report today. The harvest in Ukraine, the world’s top
producer, is progressing at the slowest pace in at least four
years. Only 2 percent of crops were collected in Russia’s Volga
valley, the main growing region, compared with 33 percent at the
same time last year. Russia is the second-biggest grower.  “The situation could become critical as there is the risk
of more or less sizable crop damage in Russia and  Ukraine  if too
wet conditions further delay harvesting,” Oil World said. “The
unfavorable moist conditions have weakened the plants and there
is the risk that the stems break under the weight of the top
carrying the seed.”  Prices of  sunflower oil  from the Black Sea region climbed
as high as $870 a ton as of Sept. 26, compared with $850 a ton
in mid-September, Oil World said. Lack of seed-drying facilities
delayed crushing in the region, so supplies of sunflower oil and
meal have tightened at export locations, it said.  Oil World cut its forecast for Spain’s sunflower seed
production to 880,000 tons from a projection of 1.03 million
tons after crops in Andalucia were damaged by birds. Total
output in the European Union may be 8.4 million tons, 200,000
tons less than estimated two weeks ago, while “sharply” higher
than last year’s harvest.  Argentina  Production prospects have “deteriorated significantly” in
Argentina, where farmers in northern areas may plant 250,000 to
300,000 fewer hectares than originally intended because of dry
weather, Oil World said. National output may be 3.2 million
tons, 300,000 tons less than previously expected.  Rapeseed and canola production worldwide may be as much as
1.5 million tons larger than a previous projection of 65 million
tons because of improving prospects in  Canada , Oil World said.
The researcher also raised its estimate for production in the EU
to 20.9 million tons in the 2013-14 season as higher output in
eastern Europe made up for a smaller harvest in  France .  To contact the reporter on this story:
