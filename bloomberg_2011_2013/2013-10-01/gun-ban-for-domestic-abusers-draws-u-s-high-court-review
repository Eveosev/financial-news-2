The U.S. Supreme Court will consider
the reach of the federal gun ban for people convicted of
misdemeanor domestic violence, agreeing to review a ruling the
Obama administration says would nullify the prohibition in much
of the country.  The justices will hear the administration’s appeal in the
case of James Alvin Castleman, who was convicted under  Tennessee 
law of assaulting the mother of his child. A federal appeals
court said that conviction couldn’t serve as the basis for a
later prosecution of Castleman for illegal gun possession.  At issue is a 1996 federal law that bars gun possession by
people convicted of domestic violence, a crime the measure
defines as involving “the use or attempted use of physical
force.”  In Castleman’s case, a Cincinnati-based federal appeals
court said Tennessee’s domestic-violence law doesn’t meet that
definition because “violent” force isn’t required for a
conviction.  “Castleman may have been convicted for causing a minor
injury such as a paper cut or a stubbed toe,” the appeals court
said.  In its appeal, the administration said many states have
domestic-violence laws that are similar to Tennessee’s. Under
the appeals court’s reasoning, the 1996 law “would be rendered
largely inoperative,” the administration said.  The case is  United States  v. Castleman, 12-1371.  To contact the reporter on this story:
