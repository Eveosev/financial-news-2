Thailand ’s baht rose for a second day
after the nation posted its first monthly current-account
surplus since March. Government bonds declined.  Southeast Asia’s second-largest economy posted a $1.3
billion  excess  in the broadest measure of trade in August, more
than the median forecast in a Bloomberg survey for a $653
million surplus, central bank data showed yesterday. Inflation
slowed to an almost four-year low of 1.4 percent in September,
the Commerce Ministry said today. Asian currencies rose as the
shutdown of the U.S. government reduced demand for the dollar.  “The fact that the current-account balance was turning to
surplus and the excess was bigger than expected was supportive
for the baht and encourages some fund inflows,” said Tohru Nishihama, an economist covering  emerging markets  at Dai-ichi
Life Research Institute Inc. in  Tokyo .  The baht strengthened 0.5 percent, the most since Sept. 19,
to 31.16 per dollar as of 4 p.m. in Bangkok, after gaining 2.7
percent last month, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected swings in
the exchange rate used to price options, climbed 32 basis points,
or 0.32 percentage point, to 7.74 percent.  Global funds bought $3.1 billion more Thai bonds than they
sold in September and pumped a net $300 million into stocks,
official data show, contributing to the currency’s biggest
monthly advance since July 2011.  The U.S. government began its first shutdown in 17 years
today amid a deadlock in Congress over government spending plans
and President  Barack Obama ’s health-care law.  The yield on the 3.625 percent bonds due June 2023 rose one
basis point to 3.94 percent, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
