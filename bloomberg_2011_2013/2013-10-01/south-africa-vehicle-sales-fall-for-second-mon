South African vehicle  sales  fell for
a second month in September and exports dropped as strikes hit
carmakers’ operations.  Sales fell 1.5 percent from a year earlier to 54,281, the
Pretoria-based National Association of Automobile Manufacturers
of  South Africa  said in an e-mailed statement today. Vehicle
exports dropped 75 percent to 6,622.  Workers at seven South African carmakers, including
Bayerische Motoren Werke AG and  Ford Motor Co. (F) , went on strike
in August and September, resulting in an estimated 20 billion
rand ($2 billion) loss to manufacturers. This was followed by a
stoppage by workers in the auto component and retail industries.  The labor disputes “had a devastating effect on the
industry,” and may “negatively affect future export contracts
being awarded to South African automotive manufacturers,”
Naamsa said.  Passenger-car sales rose 0.8 percent in September from a
year earlier to 39,792, while the sales of light commercial
vehicles, such as pick-up trucks and minivans, dropped 9.6
percent to 12,014, the association said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
