Ukraine is in talks with China to
receive a $3 billion loan under government guarantees from the
Export-Import Bank of China to resume irrigation of farmland in
the south of the former communist  Black Sea  country.  The talks are “in the final stage,” Ukrainian Agriculture
Minister Mykola Prysyazhnyuk said today in Kiev. The project
will begin in the middle of 2014 and will help supply water to
1.2 million to 1.4 million hectares of farm land, he said.  Ukraine is seeking to increase agricultural output and
boost its grain harvest. The country, which has 41.6 million
hectares of farm land and 32.5 million hectares of arable land,
expects a record grain crop this year of 60 million metric tons
and record grain exports of 28 million tons in the marketing
year starting from July 1.  The loan, which was discussed during a visit by Ukraine’s
First Deputy Prime Minister Serhiy Arbuzov to  China  last week,
will cost 6.5 percent, including all expenses and insurance, the
minister said. There will be five-year payment-free period, and
the body of the loan is to be paid back in 10 years,
Prysyazhnyuk said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
