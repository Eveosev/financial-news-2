The Ibovespa advanced for the first
time in six sessions, with homebuilder MRV Engenharia &
Participacoes SA leading gains, amid speculation that recent
losses for Brazilian equities may have been excessive.  Ultrapar Participacoes SA (UGPA3) , the holding company that runs
gas stations under the Ipiranga brand, advanced after it agreed
to buy drugstore chain Extrafarma for 1 billion reais ($450
million). Mining company MMX Mineracao & Metalicos SA led
declines in raw-material producers as metal prices dropped.  The Ibovespa climbed 0.3 percent to 52,479.51 at 10:59 a.m.
in Sao Paulo. The benchmark  stock index  capped its longest
losing streak in six months yesterday on concern a political
deadlock over the U.S. budget will hurt the global recovery. The
real climbed 0.4 percent today to 2.2088 per dollar.  “We’ll probably keep seeing the global economy showing
signs of a stronger recovery, which means the outlook is still
positive for equities,” Rogerio Freitas, a partner at hedge
fund Teorica Investimentos, said by phone from  Rio de Janeiro .
“The shutdown in the U.S. is a risk to the recovery, but for me
it’s more of a short-term issue. It shouldn’t change the big
picture, which is still for faster growth around the world.”  Lawmakers in  Washington  failed to agree on a  federal budget 
by a midnight deadline, starting a shutdown that will put as
many as 800,000 federal employees out of work temporarily and
halt some government services. Congress now faces a dispute over
raising the $16.7 trillion debt ceiling this month.  MRV rose 2.9 percent to 9.37 reais. Ultrapar climbed 0.3
percent to 54.97 reais. MMX dropped 1.3 percent to 1.53 reais.  To contact the reporter on this story:
