The  International Criminal Court 
unsealed an arrest warrant for Charles Ble Goude, the former
leader of a youth militia loyal to ex-President  Laurent Gbagbo ,
for his role in the 2011 post-election crisis in Ivory Coast
that left at least 3,000 people dead.  Ble Goude “allegedly bears individual criminal
responsibility, as indirect co-perpetrator, for four counts of
crimes against humanity,” The Hague-based court said today in
an e-mailed statement. He is suspected by the ICC of murder,
rape, persecution and other violence from Dec. 16, 2010 to April
12, 2011. The warrant, issued in December 2011, was  unsealed
yesterday, the statement said.  Known as “The Street General” and for his rhetoric
against foreigners in Ivory Coast, Ble Goude, 40, was appointed
youth minister by Gbagbo during the crisis that followed a 2010
presidential election. He was arrested in January in  Ghana  and
extradited to Ivory Coast where he has been charged with  war
crimes , murder and robbery in a local court.  Ivory Coast authorities refused last month to transfer
Simone Gbagbo, the wife of the former president, to the ICC,
saying the local judicial system can handle her trial. Her
husband is detained at the Hague since Nov. 2011 where he faces
charges of crimes against humanity.  Ivory Coast is the world’s biggest cocoa producer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
