Soybeans reached a six-week low in
 Chicago  after government reports showed improving prospects for
the U.S. harvest and bigger-than-expected inventories. Corn fell
to the lowest level since 2010.  Fifty-three percent of soybeans were in good or excellent
condition as of Sept. 29, up from 50 percent a week earlier that
got the top ratings, the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  said
yesterday. Harvesting is about 11 percent complete. The USDA
said separately U.S. soybean inventories totaled 141 million
bushels on Sept. 1, more than analysts expected and bigger than
the 125 million bushels projected on Sept. 12.  “Reports for the grains yesterday were quite surprising,”
economist  Dennis Gartman  said in his daily Gartman Letter.
“Beans are again under pressure.”  Soybeans for delivery in November slid 0.8 percent to
$12.7275 a bushel by 6:46 a.m. on the Chicago Board of Trade.
The oilseed touched $12.72, the lowest for a most-active
contract since Aug. 16. Prices tumbled 2.8 percent yesterday and
are down 9.7 percent this year on the expectation that U.S.
production would recover from drought last year.  Corn for delivery in December dropped 0.3 percent to the
day’s low of $4.40 a bushel, the lowest for most-active futures
since Sept. 1, 2010. Stockpiles in the U.S., the world’s top
grower of the grain, were 824 million bushels on Sept. 1, more
than the 661 million estimated earlier this month, the USDA
said. Analysts in a Bloomberg survey before the report expected
694 million bushels, on average.  Wheat Premium  The data will probably push corn and soybeans lower and
widen wheat’s premium to corn, Damien Courvalin, a Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. analyst, said in a report dated yesterday.  Wheat for delivery in December fell 0.4 percent to $6.7575
a bushel, extending yesterday’s 0.7 percent loss. Stockpiles
were 12 percent smaller than a year earlier at 1.86 billion
bushels, the USDA said, less than analysts expected.  Total U.S. wheat production will be 2.13 billion bushels in
the marketing year begun June 1, down from 2.27 billion
harvested a year earlier, the USDA said yesterday. Analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg expected supplies to be smaller at 2.02
billion bushels.  Milling wheat for delivery in November slid 0.9 percent to
191.50 euros ($259.36) a metric ton on NYSE Liffe in Paris.  To contact the reporters on this story:
