Ethanol’s discount to gasoline
widened as corn fell to a three-year low, signaling lower
production costs to make the biofuel.  The spread, or price difference, expanded 0.74 cent to
93.96 cents a gallon after corn, the primary ingredient in U.S.-
made ethanol, touched the lowest level since August 2010. One
bushel makes at least 2.75 gallons of the fuel additive.  “The falling corn prices will support ethanol margins,”
said  Shawn McCambridge , senior grain analyst for Jefferies Bache
LLC in Chicago.  Denatured ethanol for November delivery slipped 2.5 cents,
or 1.5 percent, to $1.671 a gallon on the Chicago Board of
Trade. The October contract, which expires Oct. 3, fell 4 cents,
or 2.1 percent, to $1.91.  Gasoline for November delivery dropped 1.76 cents, or 0.7
percent, to $2.6106 a gallon on the New York Mercantile
Exchange. The contract covers reformulated gasoline, made to be
blended with ethanol before delivery to filling stations.  Prices for the motor fuel sank on concern that the economy
will weaken and demand will decline as the U.S. government
begins its first partial shutdown in 17 years.  Corn stockpiles in the U.S., the world’s biggest grower,
totaled 824 million bushels, down from 989 million a year
earlier, the Agriculture Department said yesterday. Analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg predicted 694 million.  Corn Prices  Corn for December delivery fell 2.5 cents, or 0.6 percent,
to settle at $4.39 a bushel in  Chicago . It reached an intraday
low of $4.3525. The December corn crush spread of corn to
ethanol was 1 cent, unchanged from yesterday.  Ethanol  production  has averaged 835,000 barrels a day
through Sept. 20, down 4.7 percent from the same period in 2012,
data from the Energy Information Administration show. Stockpiles
of the biofuel were 15.6 million barrels, 19 percent lower than
a year ago.  Imports of the biofuel have averaged 22,000 barrels a day
this year through Sept. 20, up from 21,000 barrels a day the
same period in 2012, said the EIA, the Energy Department’s
statistical arm.  Ethanol is part of U.S. plans to reduce dependence on
fossil fuels. The government maintains compliance with
consumption targets with Renewable Identification Numbers, or
RINs, tracking certificates attached to each batch of biofuel.
They can be traded among refiners and later submitted to the
Environmental Protection Agency.  RINs Prices  Corn-based RINs rose 2 cents to 44 cents, while  advanced
RINs , which cover biodiesel and Brazilian sugarcane-based
ethanol, gained 2 cents to 53 cents, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  In cash market trading, ethanol tumbled 12.5 cents to
$2.275 a gallon in New York, 9 cents to $2.265 on the West
Coast, 7.5 cents to $2.375 on the Gulf Coast and 6 cents to
$2.31 a gallon in Chicago, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Chicago’s premium to New York was 3.5 cents, compared with
a discount of 3 cents yesterday, while the West Coast’s deficit
to the Gulf widened 1.5 cents to 11 cents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
