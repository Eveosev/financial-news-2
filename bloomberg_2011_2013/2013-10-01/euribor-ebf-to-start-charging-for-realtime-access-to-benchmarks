Euribor-EBF said it will start
charging users for realtime access to benchmarks including
Euribor, Eonia, and Eurepo, citing the increased cost of
overseeing the rates.  “This cost needs to be transferred to the end-users of the
benchmarks on a user-pays basis,” Guido Ravoet, chief executive
officer of the Brussels-based industry group that manages the
rates, said in a statement today.  The fees will be introduced in January and range from 500
euros ($678) to as much as 40,000 euros annually, depending on
the size of the user, Euribor-EBF said. Delayed benchmark data
will still be available at no charge to all market participants
through the group’s website.  Authorities around the world are investigating the
abuse of financial benchmarks such as the London interbank
offered rate, forcing the bodies that oversee the rates to step
up oversight of the submissions used to compile them.  Barclays
Plc (BARC) ,  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc  and  UBS AG (UBSN)  have been fined
more than $2.5 billion for rigging the benchmark.  To contact the reporter on this story:
