The territorial dispute between oil-exporting Azerbaijan and neighboring  Armenia  may soon escalate
amid rising violence and weapons buildup, according to a non-profit group dedicated to resolving global conflicts.  Until the 2011 breakdown in peace talks, “there was a
process,” Lawrence Scott Sheets, project director for the South
Caucasus at the International Crisis Group, said today by phone
from Tbilisi, the Georgian capital. “It was not a successful
process but just the existence of a process acted as a
restraining factor.”  Armenia seized Nagorno-Karabakh, a mountainous enclave
about the size of Rhode Island with a population of more than
100,000, and seven adjacent districts from Azerbaijan in a war
after the Soviet Union’s collapse in 1991. Although major
fighting ended with a cease-fire in May 1994, the two countries
haven’t reached a peace agreement and clashes are common along
the heavily militarized cease-fire line.  Peace talks mediated by  France ,  Russia  and the U.S. since a
1994 cease-fire broke down at the end of 2010. Azerbaijan, the
third largest oil producer in the former Soviet Union, also has
used oil revenue to boost military spending almost 30-fold in
the past decade to $3.7 billion this year.  Possible political unrest in both countries has added to
the risk of an escalation, Sheets said. Azeri President Ilham Aliyev will seek a third term in office in elections next week,
while Armenia faces possible political turbulence as a result of
planned opposition protests this autumn, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
