VTB Capital, the investment arm of
 Russia ’s second-largest bank, plans to increase fixed income and
equity-market businesses in  Africa  and said the region offers it
the best expansion opportunities.  “We see Africa as our biggest growth market in the near
future,” Makram Abboud, VTB Capital’s chief executive officer
for the  Middle East  and Africa, said in an interview in Moscow.  While most of VTB Capital’s underwriting business comes
from ruble notes and sales for parent VTB Group, the brokerage
is expanding beyond Russia, hiring more than 100 employees in
London, New York, Hong Kong, Dubai and other financial centers.  VTB Capital last month helped manage Mozambique’s issue of
a $350 million bond due in September 2020. It was also one of
four Russian lenders that provided $278 million of loans to
Angola in 2011. The African country’s government later picked
VTB to manage its $1 billion bond. Parent VTB Group has a bank
in Angola,  VTB Africa Bank SA .  VTB Capital has a “few” fixed-income transactions closing
in Qatar, one in Saudi Arabia and one in Dubai, Abboud said
today, without disclosing details.  Herbert Moos , VTB’s deputy chairman, said in 2012 that the
bank wanted to become the first Russian borrower to sell
Shariah-compliant debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
