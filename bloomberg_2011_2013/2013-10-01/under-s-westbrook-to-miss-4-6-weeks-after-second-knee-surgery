Oklahoma City Thunder guard  Russell Westbrook  will  miss the first four to six weeks of the National
Basketball Association season after undergoing a second surgery
on his right knee.  A three-time All-Star and the team’s second leading scorer,
Westbrook had surgery earlier this year to repair a torn
meniscus he suffered in the playoffs. Thunder General Manager
Sam Presti said Westbrook had a second procedure today because
he was experiencing swelling that had not subsided.  “During the procedure it was determined that the source of
swelling was due to a loose stitch, and fortunately we were also
able to confirm that the meniscus has healed properly,” Presti
said in the statement on the team’s website.  Westbrook, 24, injured the knee in an April 24 postseason
game against the Houston Rockets.  Oklahoma City, the Western
Conference’s top seed, eliminated Houston but lost to the fifth-seeded  Memphis Grizzlies  in the following round.  Westbrook averaged 23.2 points per game during the regular
season, sixth-best in the league and second on the team to
forward  Kevin Durant . Westbrook also contributed 7.4 assists per
game, 1.8 steals and a career-high 5.2 rebounds.  -- Editor: Jay Beberman  To contact the reporters on this story:
