Fabrice Tourre, the ex- Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. (GS)  vice president found liable for his role in a failed
$1 billion investment, asked for a reversal of the verdict and a
new trial of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission case.  Tourre, 34, is entitled to a judgment in his favor under
civil rules if a court finds that a reasonable jury wouldn’t
perceive enough evidence against him, one of his lawyers,  Pamela Chepiga , said in a memorandum filed with U.S. District Court in
Manhattan yesterday.  “The SEC has failed to adduce evidence” of liability,
including “any intent to defraud,” Chepiga said in the filing
while asking U.S. District Judge Katherine Forrest to dismiss
the SEC claims. “Mr. Tourre testified that he never intended to
mislead anyone.”  The SEC accused Tourre, a native of  France , of
intentionally misleading investors in a subprime mortgage entity
called Abacus about the role played by Paulson & Co., the hedge
fund of billionaire John Paulson which helped choose the
portfolio of securities, then made a billion-dollar bet it would
fail.  Jurors in the case determined Aug. 1 that Tourre couldn’t
hide behind his age and relative lack of stature within Goldman
Sachs to avoid responsibility. Tourre faces unspecified fines
and potential exclusion from the securities industry.  The case is SEC v. Tourre, 10-cv-03229, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York ( Manhattan ).  To contact the reporters on this story:
