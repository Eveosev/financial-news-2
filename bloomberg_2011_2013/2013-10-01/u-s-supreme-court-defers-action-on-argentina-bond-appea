The U.S. Supreme Court deferred
action on  Argentina ’s appeal of a lower court ruling that may
force the country to pay holders of billions of dollars of
defaulted bonds.  The justices today released a list of new cases they will
hear, without mentioning the Argentina appeal. Today’s action
doesn’t preclude the court from agreeing later to hear the
country’s arguments. The court is scheduled to issue its next
list of orders on Oct. 7, the day its new term formally opens.  Argentina’s opponents in the legal fight include NML
Capital Ltd., a unit of billionaire hedge-fund manager Paul
Singer’s Elliott Management Corp.  The Supreme Court case is Argentina v. NML Capital,
12-1494.  To contact the reporter on this story:
