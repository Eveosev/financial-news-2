Coffee shipments from  Indonesia ’s
southern Sumatra, the main grower in the third-largest producer
of robusta beans, climbed close to a four-year high in September.  Shipments from the provinces of Lampung, South Sumatra and
Bengkulu rose 72 percent to 55,470.50 metric tons from 32,263
tons in August, when the country had a week-long holiday, the
Lampung trade and industry office said in a statement today.
That compares with 55,709 tons shipped in July, the most since
June 2009, and 18,488 tons in September 2012. The data for
September include 85.56 tons of instant coffee.  Prices in  London  declined to a three-year low last week on
expectations that global supplies of robusta used by  Nestle SA (NESN) 
will outpace demand. Farmers in  Vietnam , the biggest producer,
have the largest stockpiles of unsold beans in four years as
they prepare for a record crop in the season that started today,
according to a Bloomberg survey. Indonesia was closed for a week
in August to celebrate the Eid festival that marks the end of
the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan.  “Exporters are trying to meet their commitments after
trade slowed due to Eid,” said Mochtar Luthfie, head of
research and development at the Lampung chapter of the
Association of Indonesian Coffee Exporters and Industries.
“People are also releasing stocks, trying to make some profit
or at least break even.”  Robusta for delivery in November closed at $1,642 a ton on
NYSE Liffe yesterday after dropping to $1,596 on Sept. 27, the
lowest intraday level for a most-active contract since October
2010. Futures fell 12 percent in the past two months.  Shipments from Indonesia may reach 530,000 tons in 2013,
unchanged from a year earlier, according to Irfan Anwar,
chairman of the exporters association. Beans would account for
about 85 percent of the shipments, he said Sept. 12. The harvest
in the country usually runs from April to July, with a smaller
crop through September.  The provinces of Lampung, South Sumatra and Bengkulu
account for about 75 percent of the country’s supplies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
