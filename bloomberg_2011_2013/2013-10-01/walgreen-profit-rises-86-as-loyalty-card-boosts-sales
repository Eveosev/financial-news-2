Walgreen Co. (WAG) , the largest U.S.
drugstore retailer, said fiscal fourth-quarter profit rose 86
percent after its customer-loyalty card boosted sales.  Net income  increased to $657 million, or 69 cents per
share, in the quarter ended Aug. 31 from $353 million, or 39
cents per share, a year earlier, the Deerfield, Illinois-based
company said today in a statement. Excluding certain items,
profit was 73 cents a share, matching the average of 20
analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Chief Executive Officer Gregory Wasson has used data from
loyalty-card holders’ purchases to improve the selection of
merchandise in the front of Walgreen’s stores. Sales at
locations open at least 12 months advanced 4.6 percent in the
quarter as the average purchase size increased 3.6 percent. The
number of customers slipped 1.9 percent.  “While customer traffic remains challenged, we believe we
are starting to see the benefit of Balance Rewards,”  Deborah Weinswig , an analyst at Citigroup Inc. in  New York , wrote in a
note today. She recommends buying Walgreen shares.  Sales rose 5.1 percent to $17.9 billion.  Walgreen climbed 4.5 percent to $56.24 at the close in New
York. The  shares  have advanced 52 percent this year compared
with a 19 percent gain by the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
