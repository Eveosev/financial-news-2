Burial options in  Japan  are expanding
beyond the traditional Buddhist ceremony. You can now send a
loved one’s ashes into space.  Closely held  Elysium Space Inc.  is offering a service in
Japan to send a portion of a person’s cremated remains in a
capsule that will circle the earth for several months for
$1,990. Relatives and friends can track the spacecraft’s
trajectory on a mobile phone app. Like a meteorite, the remains
disintegrate upon entering the earth’s atmosphere, “blazing as
a shooting star,” according to a company statement.  About one gram of a person’s remains are placed into an
individual “space-grade” aluminum capsule, Benjamin Joffe, a
spokesman for the company said in an e-mail. Missions will carry
between 100 to 400 individual capsules, he said.  The service will give a new option for Japanese looking to
reduce the size and expense of funerals as relatives become
fewer and traditional ties weaken in one of the world’s fastest
aging societies. The cost of a renting a burial plot and buying
a tomb stone in  Tokyo  is about 2.7 million yen ($27,400),
according to Japan Institute of  Life Insurance .  The market for  funeral services  in Japan rose 0.7 percent
to 1.3 trillion yen in the year ended March 2010 from a year
earlier as the number of aged Japanese increased, according to
the marketing and credit research firm Teikoku Databank Ltd.
based in Tokyo.  Elysium Space began taking U.S. space burial reservations
in the U.S. in August. The San Francisco company’s first launch
is scheduled for next summer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
