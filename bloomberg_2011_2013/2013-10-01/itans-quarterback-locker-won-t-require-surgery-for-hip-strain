Tennessee Titans quarterback Jake Locker’s hip injury was diagnosed as a sprain and won’t require
surgery.  Locker had a second set of tests today and probably will
miss “a few weeks” the National Football League team said
today in a statement on its website. The 25-year-old was carted
off the field after sustaining hip and knee sprains on Sept. 29
against the  New York  Jets.  “The area will need time to heal and strengthen, but he
won’t require surgery and he has already begun a rehab routine
for both his hip and knee,” the team said in the statement.  Locker was injured in the third quarter two days ago on a
hit from Jets defensive linemen Muhammad Wilkerson and Quinton
Coples. He lay motionless on the field for several minutes
before being removed on a motorized cart and taken to a hospital.  Locker has completed 62.2 percent of his passes this year
for six touchdowns and no interceptions. He’s already been ruled
out for the team’s next game against the  Kansas City Chiefs ,
according to coach  Mike Munchak , and Ryan Fitzpatrick will start
in his absence.  To contact the reporters on this story:
