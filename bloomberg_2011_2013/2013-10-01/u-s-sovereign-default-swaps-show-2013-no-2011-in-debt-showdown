Credit-default swaps insuring against
losses on U.S. Treasuries cost about half as much as during the
last Congressional showdown on speculation that lawmakers will
agree to raise the nation’s debt limit by Oct. 17.  Swaps contracts dropped three basis points to 31 basis
points today as Congress remains mired in a partisan deadlock.
That compares with a peak of 56 basis points in July 2011, when
a political standoff threatened to shutter programs and delay
bond payments, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The amount of debt protected by default swaps has fallen to
$3.1 billion dollars from $5.6 billion two years ago and
compares with $13 billion of outstanding insurance on German
bunds. Failure by President  Barack Obama  and Congressional
leaders to reach agreement may force the government to delay
bond payments, causing a  credit event  that would trigger
insurance payouts.  “We’ve been here before and there’s this confidence that
no matter how divided and extreme Congress is, we’re not going
to end up with a U.S. default,” said Steven Englander, global
head of G-10 currency strategy at Citigroup Inc. in  New York .
“Every time we go there, the assumption is that it gets
resolved closer to the deadline.”  In a default, the derivatives would be settled based on the
value of bonds that is determined at an auction. While U.S.
Treasury debt typically trades at or above par, some longer-dated bonds are quoted below face value.  Contract Settlement  The government’s $42 billion of bonds due in November 2042
are quoted at about 82 percent of face value, meaning swaps
buyers would be paid the difference to settle the contracts.  There are 847 credit-default swaps contracts linked to  U.S.
debt  outstanding, according to the Depository Trust & Clearing
Corp. Ten trades covering $290 million of Treasuries took place
in the week through Sept. 20, compared with a daily average of
12 trades covering $175 million from June 2011 to September
2011.  The debt ceiling debate is unlikely to change the U.S.
government’s AA+ grade,  Standard & Poor’s  said yesterday. The
world’s biggest economy lost its top AAA standing with the
rating company in July 2011.  “You can have a gentle government shutdown,” Englander at
Citigroup said. “It’s hard to have a gentle default.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
