BC Partners Ltd. and Permira Advisers
LLP, two of  Europe ’s largest private-equity firms, cut
compensation for employees last year as revenue declined.  Salaries at London-based BC Partners, which employs about
108 people, fell to 41.3 million pounds ($67 million) for 2012
from 50.3 million pounds a year earlier, according to filings at
the U.K.’s Companies House. At Permira, which owns stakes in
companies including retailer New Look Retail Group Ltd., pay for
its 16 U.K. partners dropped to 21.9 million pounds from 25
million pounds.  Revenue for both companies comes from fees investors pay
the firms to manage the private-equity funds on their behalf.
The payments typically decline over the 10-year lifetime of a
fund as it ceases to make new investments. Both Permira and  BC
Partners  charge an annual management fee of about 2 percent and
get to keep 20 percent of the profit from investments.  BC Partners’s revenue from continuing operations, which
excludes profit from asset sales, fell to 84.6 million pounds
from 95.2 million pounds. Permira’s revenue dropped to 45
million pounds from 49 million pounds, the filings show.  Private-equity firms typically pool money from pension
plans and endowments with a mandate to buy companies within five
to six years, then sell them and return the money and a profit
after 10 years.  The average number of staff employed at BC Partners, which
holds a stake in U.K. mobile phone retailer Phones 4U Ltd.,
dipped from 110 in 2011, the filing shows. A spokesman for the
firm in  London  declined to comment.  Largest Payment  The single largest payment made to a partner at London-based Permira fell to 2.3 million pounds from 3.4 million
pounds. The recipient was Co-Managing Partner Kurt Bjorklund,
said a person with knowledge of the matter, who asked not to be
identified because the information is private. Bjorklund didn’t
immediately return an e-mail seeking comment, while officials at
Permira declined to comment.  BC Partners raised 6.5 billion euros ($8.8 billion) in 2012
for its ninth fund, while Permira is targeting 5 billion euros
for its latest pool.  Permira’s accounts reflect its U.K. operation and exclude
global revenue and, like BC Partners, don’t include fees derived
from asset sales, said one other person briefed on the matter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
