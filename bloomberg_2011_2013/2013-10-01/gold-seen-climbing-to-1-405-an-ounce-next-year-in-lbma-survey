Gold may advance 8.8 percent to
$1,405 an ounce in about a year, according to the average
response in a survey of attendees at the London Bullion Market
Association’s conference in  Rome .  The estimate is 27 percent below the record $1,921.15 set
in September 2011. Silver, platinum and palladium will also rise
by the time of the LBMA’s gathering in  Lima  in November 2014,
today’s survey showed.  Bullion is set for the first annual drop in 13 years as
some investors lose faith in the metal as a store of value amid
signs economies are strengthening. Holdings in gold-backed
exchange-traded products are the lowest in three years on
speculation the  Federal Reserve , which maintained monetary
stimulus last month, will begin to curb its bond purchases.  “The monetary and investment argument for gold is
negative, but the physical side is generally positive,”  James Steel , a HSBC Securities (USA) Inc. commodities analyst, said in
an interview in Rome. “Continued high levels of Chinese demand
will be supportive. Expectations for Fed tapering are largely
digested. Pressures will be if tapering is faster and more
severe than expected.”  Gold for immediate delivery traded at $1,291.88 by 4:23
p.m. in London, set for a 23 percent decline this year. A survey
of attendees at last year’s conference in  Hong Kong  in November
forecast bullion would increase to $1,849 by this year’s
gathering.  More Evidence  The Fed said on Sept. 18 it wants more evidence of an
economic recovery before slowing its $85 billion-a-month of bond
buying. Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  surprised analysts who
predicted a $5 billion cut, saying he was concerned that market
interest rates, driven higher by his own suggestion he would
scale back stimulus, would curb growth.  Gold advanced as much as 21 percent from a 34-month low in
June through late August as lower prices boosted demand for
jewelry, bars and coins, particularly in  Asia .  Fifty percent of those surveyed said exchange-traded
product investors will be net buyers in 2014. Holdings fell 27
percent this year as of Sept. 27.  Among those surveyed, 17% percent said gold would be the
best performing precious metal next year; 16% said silver; 33%
said platinum; and 34% said palladium.  Silver will climb 20 percent to $25 an ounce by the next
annual meeting, according to the survey. Platinum will increase
22 percent to $1,675 an ounce and palladium will advance 17
percent to $837 an ounce, it showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
