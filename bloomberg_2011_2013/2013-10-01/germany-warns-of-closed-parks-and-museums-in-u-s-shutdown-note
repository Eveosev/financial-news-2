Germany  issued a travel advisory for
the U.S., citing the risk of closed museums and national parks
as the federal government partially shuts down in a budget
impasse.  The update,  posted  on the German Foreign Ministry’s website
today, said waiting times at U.S. immigration posts may be
longer. Travelers to the U.S. “must expect U.S. national parks,
national museums and public facilities to be closed until
further notice,” according to the advisory.  The U.K. government, in a separate  notice , said travelers
may experience delays in  air travel  and at immigration.  U.K. citizens made up 6.1 percent of  foreign visitors  to
the U.S. last year, the biggest share from Europe, followed by
Germans at 2.9 percent, according to the Commerce Department.  To contact the reporter on this story:
