Chicago  diesel fuel tumbled to the
lowest level in more than  eight months  after  BP Plc (BP/)  was said to
restart units at its Toledo, Ohio, refinery.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel  in Chicago slipped 6 cents to 11.5
cents a gallon below futures at 4:19 p.m. on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange , the biggest discount since Jan. 23.
Conventional, 85-octane gasoline in the region, or CBOB, dropped
1 cent to 6.5 cents below Nymex gasoline futures.  Differentials widened as BP was said to ramp up rates at
its Toledo refinery after restarting a sulfur recovery complex.
The plant had been running at reduced levels since Sept. 24,
according to a person familiar with operations, who asked not to
be identified because the information isn’t public.  The  Toledo refinery , jointly owned by  BP (BP)  and  Husky Energy
Inc. (HSE) , produces mostly gasoline, including low-sulfur fuels,
according to the company’s website. The plant has the capacity
to process about 160,000 barrels a day.  The  3-2-1 crack spread  in Chicago, a rough measure of
refining margins based on West Texas Intermediate oil in
Cushing,  Oklahoma , slipped $1.55 to $9 a barrel. The crack
spread in  New York , based on Brent oil in  Europe , widened $1.27
to $7.15 a gallon, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Northeast Turnarounds  Spot gasoline in the U.S. Northeast strengthened to the
highest in more than two weeks after  Phillips 66 (PSX)  said it was
carrying out planned work at its 238,000-barrel-a-day Bayway
plant, the largest single plant in the U.S. Northeast.  Conventional, 84-octane gasoline , or RBOB, in New York
Harbor added 2.13 cents to a premium of 1.13 cents a gallon
versus Nymex futures at 3:53 p.m., the strongest level since
Sept. 13. The conventional, 83.5-octane grade  known as CBOB 
gained 1.51 cents to 0.38 cent above Nymex futures.  PBF Energy Inc. (PBF)  was expected to carry out maintenance on a
coker and two sulfur units in  Delaware  City, Delaware, starting
this week. Michael Karlovich, a spokesman for PBF in Parsippany,
 New Jersey , declined to comment on operations.  The Delaware City site, on the  Delaware River , processes a
diverse slate of heavy crudes and distributes clean products,
according to the company’s website. The plant has a capacity of
about 182,2000 barrels a day, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
