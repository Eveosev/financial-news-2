The Dominican Republic’s  economy 
accelerated in the second quarter as the opening of the
country’s biggest mine boosted production in the Caribbean
nation.  Gross domestic product expanded 2.8 percent in the quarter
compared with 0.3 percent in the first three months. First half
growth of 1.6 percent was buoyed by a 223 percent surge in
mining activity, while financial services climbed 8.8 percent,
the central bank reported today.  Economic growth is likely to slow to 2.8 percent this year
from 4.5 percent in 2012 as policy makers attempt to keep
inflation under control amid higher deficits, said Alejandro Arreaza, an analyst at Barclays. The Caribbean nation, which
shares the island of Hispaniola with  Haiti , has averaged 6
percent annual growth since 2004.  “We expect slower growth this year partly because of the
tighter fiscal policy by the government and increased interest
rate,” Arreaza said.  The government late last year raised the sales tax to 18
percent from 16 percent as part of policy changes to rein in a
widening public sector deficit. Consumer prices rose 5.67
percent in July, the most since February 2012.  The central bank raised the overnight rate to 6.25 percent
from 4.25 percent in August, the first increase since April 2011
and the biggest since establishing the rate in 2008. Policy
makers held the rate at their meeting yesterday. Barclays cut
the country to underweight from neutral on Sept. 27, citing the
current account deficit and “erratic” monetary policy.  The $4 billion Pueblo Viejo mine, operated by  Barrick Gold
Corp. (ABX)  and  Goldcorp Inc. (G)  has helped boost Dominican exports since
beginning commercial production this year. The project, 60 miles
(97 kilometers) north of the capital of Santo Domingo, could
produce as many as 1 million ounces of gold next year, the
government has said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
