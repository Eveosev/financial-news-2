CA Immobilien Anlagen AG (CAI)  agreed to
sell two thirds of its most valuable property,  Frankfurt ’s Tower
185, to two German pension funds to reduce the Austrian
developer’s debt and increase its ability to pay a dividend.  The funds will each buy a third of the office tower, which
is valued at about 500 million euros ($680 million), CA Immo
said in a  statement  today. The Vienna-based company will keep
the remaining stake through its German unit.  The transaction “enables us to reap further benefits from
both the location’s growing popularity and the special quality
of this property,” Chief Executive Officer Bruno Ettenauer said
in the statement.  CA Immo is cutting a portfolio that had more than doubled
in value between 2006 and 2012 to become more profitable,
provide a regular dividend and increase its equity ratio, a
measure of financial strength. Another goal of the partial sale
of Tower 185,  Germany ’s fourth-tallest office building, was to
allocate its capital in a more balanced way, CA Immo  said  in
January.  The company’s  shares  were up 4.8 percent to 11.25 euros at
the 5:30 p.m. close of trading in Vienna, the highest since
March 14. CA Immo was the third-best performer among the 75
members of the Bloomberg EMEA Real Estate Index.  Tower 185 was completed in January 2012, according to the
statement. The tower has a height of 200 meters (656 feet) and
has 100,000 square meters (1.1 million square feet) of space.  Last week, CA Immo agreed to sell 36 German office
properties valued at about 800 million euros to Augsburg-based
 Patrizia Immobilien AG (P1Z)  in what would be the country’s biggest
commercial real estate transaction this year.  “The 40 percent equity ratio targeted by the company will
be reached with the two latest transactions,” Thomas Neuhold, a
Vienna-based analyst at Kepler Cheuvreux, said via telephone.  The deal announced today is “very good news” after some
CA Immo investors criticized the company for the size of its
debt, Neuhold said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
