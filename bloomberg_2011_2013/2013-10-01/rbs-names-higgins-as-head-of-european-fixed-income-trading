Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc ,
Britain’s biggest publicly owned lender, hired former  Nomura
Holdings Inc. (8604)  executive Kieran Higgins as head of fixed-income
trading for Europe, the  Middle East  and  Africa .  The 41-year-old will take up the job in London immediately
and report to Michael Lyublinsky, head of global trading, and
Peter Nielsen, co-head of the markets unit, Edinburgh-based RBS
said in a statement today. Higgins, who left Nomura last year,
didn’t immediately return a telephone call seeking comment.  “He brings a wealth of expertise to this new role and is
one of the most experienced interest rates traders in the London
market,” Nielsen said in the statement.  RBS, which received the biggest bailout of any bank in the
world during the financial crisis, is closing its equities and
mergers-advisory units to focus on rates, foreign exchange,
asset-backed products, credit and debt capital markets.  Higgins was formerly co-head of fixed income in  Europe  at
Nomura, following a 13-year career at Lehman Brothers Holdings
Inc. which included a stint running exotic interest rate and
options trading in Europe.  To contact the reporters on this story:
