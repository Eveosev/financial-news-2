Cool Planet Energy Systems Inc., a
closely held developer of biofuel refineries, agreed to license
its technology to Acritaz Greentech for “multiple” commercial-scale facilities in  Malaysia .  Construction on the first biofuel plant is expected to
begin next year, according to a joint statement today from
Selangor, Malaysia-based  Acritaz  and Greenwood Village,
Colorado-based Cool Planet. Acritaz will commit as much as $60
million to the facility.  Cool Planet’s technology uses a chemical-mechanical process
to convert non-food biomass into fuel. The company said Sept. 17
that it raised $19.4 million for its first production facility
in Louisiana.  To contact the reporter on this story:
