Servicing  California ’s general-fund
debt will take a smaller chunk of the state budget -- 7.7
percent -- this fiscal year compared with the 9.8 percent
estimated in 2009 by Treasurer Bill Lockyer, who cited lower
 interest rates .  The state paid about $8.6 billion for debt service out of
$98.2 billion of revenue in fiscal 2013, which ended June 30,
Lockyer said today in his  Debt Affordability report . The amount
should drop to $7.5 billion in the current fiscal year, out of
$97.1 billion, he said, citing refinancings at lower rates and
“more prudent debt-management practices.”  Governor  Jerry Brown , 75, and Lockyer, both Democrats,
curbed state bond sales when Brown took office in 2011 as a way
to reduce borrowing costs. Before that, Lockyer, 72, had
forecast debt payments as a percentage of the general fund at
almost 10 percent by now. A lower debt-service to general-fund
revenue ratio is a common measure of fiscal health, he said.  Lockyer is planning on selling an estimated $2 billion of
general-obligation bonds the week of Oct. 21,  Tom Dresslar , a
spokesman, said by telephone. A portion of the funds raised will
be used to refinance higher-yielding debt, though the specific
amounts of the sale and the refunding haven’t been set, he said.  As of Sept. 1, California had $79.4 billion in long-term
bonds, out of $147.8 billion authorized by voters, according to
 Lockyer’s website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
