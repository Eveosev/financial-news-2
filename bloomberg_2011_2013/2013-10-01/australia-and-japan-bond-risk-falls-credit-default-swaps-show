The cost of insuring corporate bonds
in Australia and Japan against non-payment declined, according
to traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index slid 3 basis points to
121 basis points as of 10:21 a.m. in Sydney, according to
 Westpac Banking Corp. (WBC)  prices. The measure climbed for the past
two months, closing yesterday at the highest level since Aug.
28, according to data from CMA, which is owned by McGraw-Hill
Cos. and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the private
market.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index fell 2 basis points to 95.5
as of 9:11 a.m. in  Tokyo , according to Citigroup Inc. prices.
The gauge, which rose 2.5 basis points last month, closed lower
for the fourth straight quarter yesterday, CMA data show.  Financial markets in  Hong Kong  are closed today for a
public holiday.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
