Gasoline fell to a nine-month low on
concern that the economy will weaken and fuel demand will
decline as the U.S. government begins its first partial shutdown
in 17 years.  Prices sank as much as 1.4 percent. The shutdown, which
comes after Congress failed to break a budget impasse by a
midnight deadline, may idle as many as 800,000 federal
employees, close national parks and halt some services. The
shutdown will cost the U.S. at least $300 million a day in lost
economic output at the start, according to IHS Inc.  “The market is waiting to see if there will be a quick
resolution,” said  Andy Lipow , president of Lipow Oil Associates
LLC in Houston. “If the stalemate continues the market will
come under greater bearish pressure as the effects start to
filter through the economy.”  Gasoline for November delivery fell 2.1 cents, or 0.8
percent, to $2.6072 a gallon at 10:12 a.m. on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange  and touched $2.5987, the lowest intraday
level since Dec. 11. Trading volume was 32 percent below the
100-day average for the time of day.  The shutdown follows Congress’s failure to pass a stopgap
spending bill before the country’s fiscal year ended yesterday.
Congressional leaders have scheduled no further budget
negotiations, raising concerns among some lawmakers that the
shutdown could bleed into the more consequential fight over how
to raise the U.S. debt limit to avoid a first-ever default after
Oct. 17.  Crack Spreads  The motor fuel’s  crack spread  versus West Texas
Intermediate crude narrowed 14 cents to $7.91 a barrel. The
fuel’s  premium  over Brent fell 26 cents to $1.75.  Pump prices , averaged nationwide, fell 0.6 cent to $3.393 a
gallon, the lowest level since Jan. 28 and 38.9 cents below a
year ago, Heathrow, Florida-based AAA said today on its website.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel for November delivery fell 1.4
cents, or 0.5 percent, to $2.9575 a gallon on trading volume
that was 4.2 percent BELOW the 100-day average.  ULSD’s  crack spread  versus WTI widened 13 cents to $22.60 a
barrel. The  premium  over Brent increased 3 cents to $16.46.  To contact the reporter on this story:
