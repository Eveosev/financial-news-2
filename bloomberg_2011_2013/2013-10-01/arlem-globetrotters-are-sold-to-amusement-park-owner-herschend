Harlem Globetrotters  International
Inc., which includes the namesake touring basketball team known
for comedy showmanship, was purchased by the Herschend Family
Entertainment Corp., a Georgia-based amusement park owner and
operator  Herschend, which calls itself the largest family-owned
themed attractions company in the U.S. with 26 properties,
bought the team from Los Angeles-based Shamrock Capital Advisors
LLC, according to a statement on the HFE website. Terms weren’t
disclosed.  Herschend’s parks include Dollywood in Pigeon Forge,
 Tennessee , and Silver Dollar City in Branson,  Missouri .  Founded in 1926 as the Savoy Big Five, the Globetrotters
have played in 122 countries, according to the statement. The
team performs 400 live events a year, and was inducted into
 Basketball Hall of Fame  in 2002.  “For nearly nine decades, the Harlem Globetrotters have
had a rich tradition of creating family memories through sports
and entertainment,” HFE Chief Executive Joel Manby said in the
statement. “The team is coming off its best touring year ever,
and this acquisition helps HFE diversify into a new but
complementary business.”  The Globetrotters produced all-time highs for sponsorships
partners and merchandise sales last year without giving figures,
according to the statement.  To contact the reporters on this story:
