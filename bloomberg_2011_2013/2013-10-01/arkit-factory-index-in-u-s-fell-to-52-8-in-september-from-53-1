The Markit Economics  final index  of
U.S. manufacturing decreased to 52.8 in September from 53.1 the
previous month, the London-based group said today.  The median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of 8 economists
was 53.1. It matched the preliminary reading. Forecasts ranged
from 52.5 to 53.8. A reading greater than 50 for the  purchasing
managers ’ figure indicates expansion.  In  China , the manufacturing rebound is gaining little
traction. A Purchasing Managers’ Index reached 51.1 in September
after 51 a month earlier, according to the National Bureau of
Statistics and China Federation of Logistics and Purchasing.  Euro-area factory output expanded for a third month in
September. An index based on a survey of purchasing managers in
the manufacturing industry slipped to 51.1 from 51.4 in August,
in line with an estimate published on Sept. 23, London-based
Markit said today.  The Markit U.S. purchasers index is based on responses from
85 percent to 90 percent of companies in a poll of more than 600
American manufacturers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
