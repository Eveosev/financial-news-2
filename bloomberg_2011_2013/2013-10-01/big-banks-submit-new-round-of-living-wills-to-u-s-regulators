The largest banks have begun
submitting a second round of plans to U.S. regulators outlining
how they could be safely taken apart if they fail.  Eleven banks including  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  and  Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  faced a deadline today to submit so-called
living wills, and some have started to file, said  Andrew Gray , a
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. spokesman. The plans required by
the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act must describe hypothetical orderly
bankruptcies for the global financial giants. The FDIC and
 Federal Reserve  will assess the plans for credibility.  The financial overhaul included this process to counter the
market perception that some banks are so big that their failure
would demand a government rescue. A bank that can’t show how it
could pass through bankruptcy without threatening the wider
financial system could be forced by regulators to restructure
and sell off units. The FDIC was also given power to take a firm
over and wind it down if its failure would still pose too great
a threat.  As the two agencies gather the plans today, they are
preparing to release limited public portions on their websites.
The rest of the documents will remain private.  To contact the reporter on this story:
