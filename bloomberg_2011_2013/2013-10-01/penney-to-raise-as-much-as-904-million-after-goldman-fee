J.C. Penney Co. (JCP)  may raise as much
as $904 million from a stock sale after deducting expenses
including a fee by Goldman Sachs Group Inc., the manager of the
offering.  The Plano, Texas-based department-store chain is selling 84
million shares at $9.65 apiece and underwriters may sell an
additional 12.6 million under a 30-day option. The New York-based investment firm is charging 29 cents a share for handling
the offering, which would give it $28 million if all the shares
are sold.  The department store chain, which hasn’t been profitable
since 2011, announced the stock sale last week, as it raises
more cash to get through the holiday season and quell concerns
that its liquidity will be strained this quarter. A day after it
announced the share sale, the company stoked those concerns
again by saying it would have $1.3 billion in liquidity at the
end of the year, $200 million less than previously forecast.  Since Chief Executive Officer Mike Ullman returned as CEO
in April, J.C. Penney has borrowed about $3.1 billion to help
fund its attempt to rebound from  Ron Johnson ’s failed
transformation into a destination for younger, wealthier
shoppers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
