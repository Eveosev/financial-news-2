Ghana , the second-biggest producer of
cocoa, will probably keep paying farmers the same rate for the
beans even after world prices fell, the nation’s regulator said.  “We are likely to be maintaining the price we pay to
farmers although world market prices have dipped,” Said Noah
Amenyah, spokesman for the country’s cocoa board, said today.  Farmers will get as much as 78 percent of the free on board
rate, with the rest divided between buyers, hauliers and
research and administration, he said in an interview. They would
normally get 70 percent, Amenyah said in the capital, Accra.  Growers will receive 3,392 cedis ($1,600) a metric ton for
the 2013-14 season, which will start after an announcement by
the finance minister between Oct. 11 and Oct. 18, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
