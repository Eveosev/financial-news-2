Arizona  regulatory staff recommended
rejecting a proposal to reduce the price the state’s largest
utility must pay for solar power produced by its customers.  Arizona Corporation Commission staff said changes to
Arizona Public Service’s solar policies that affect customers
with rooftop solar plants should be considered in a formal rate
case, according to a memo yesterday.  Arizona Public Service, a Phoenix-based unit of  Pinnacle
West Capital Corp. (PNW) , said the staff’s recommendations “are a
starting point but don’t go far enough,” in a statement today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
