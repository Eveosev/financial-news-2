Enbridge Inc. (ENB)  expects earnings per
share to grow as much as 12 percent through 2017 as  Canada ’s
largest oil-pipeline owner develops more infrastructure
projects, said Chief Executive Officer Al Monaco.  Enbridge has C$36 billion ($34.9 billion) worth of projects
through 2017, Monaco said today at an investor meeting in
Toronto. The company sees natural gas and power projects as a
growing share of Enbridge’s business, he said.  Enbridge, based in Calgary, is expanding and reversing
pipeline routes to the U.S. Gulf Coast as well as to Canada’s
eastern provinces. The company is also proposing a conduit
called Northern Gateway to transport bitumen to Canada’s Pacific
coast, allowing oil-sands producers to access markets in Asia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
