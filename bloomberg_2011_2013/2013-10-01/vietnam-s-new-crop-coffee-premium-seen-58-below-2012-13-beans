Buyers of coffee from Vietnam, the
world’s largest producer of the robusta variety, are paying a 58
percent smaller premium for beans from the new harvest compared
to the old crop, according to NC Group Ltd.  Beans from the 2013-14 crop for shipment from November
onwards are trading at a premium of $50 a metric ton to the
price on the NYSE Liffe exchange in  London , the company, which
has offices in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, said by e-mail today.
Coffee from the old crop for prompt shipment was at a premium of
about $120 a ton to the exchange price, it said.  The “new crop harvest will start from around end of
October, and the first possible shipment of new crop is not
until mid-November,” said Nguyen Chi Cuong, chief executive
officer at the trading company. Old crop stockpiles held by
farmers are “very thin at the moment.” Robusta coffee is used
in instant drinks and espresso.  Robusta coffee futures fell 7.7 percent last month as
traders anticipated a record crop in  Vietnam . Production there
will be 1.7 million tons in 2013-14, an all-time high and 13
percent more than last season’s, according to the median of nine
trader and shipper estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Money
managers more than doubled  bearish bets  on robusta coffee
futures and options in the four weeks to Sept. 24.  The physical market in Vietnam is “very thin and premiums
are high,” Volcafe, a unit of commodities trader ED&F Man
Holdings Ltd., said in a Sept. 27 report. Harvesting of the new
crop is in “early stages” and rains are making bean drying
difficult, says the Winterthur, Switzerland-based trader.  Robusta coffee for delivery in November fell 0.7 percent to
$1,630 a ton by 1:50 p.m. in London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
