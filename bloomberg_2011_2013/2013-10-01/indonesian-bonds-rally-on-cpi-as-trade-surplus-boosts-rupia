Indonesia ’s 10-year bonds rallied and
rupiah forwards surged as the government reported slower
inflation and the first monthly trade surplus since March.  The notes due 2023 snapped a six-day decline as data showed
consumer prices rose 8.4 percent in September from a year
earlier, slower than 8.79 percent the previous month and the 9
percent median estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg. The
August trade excess was $132 million, compared with a record
$2.3 billion deficit in July.  “The inflation and trade balance are positive for the
rupiah,” said Handy Yunianto, head of fixed-income research at
PT Mandiri Sekuritas in Jakarta. “When foreign investors expect
the rupiah to strengthen from current levels, then fund flows
can trigger the bond yields to decline.”  The government’s 5.625 percent notes due May 2023 fell four
basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 8.46 percent as of
3:37 p.m. in Jakarta, according to prices from the Inter Dealer
Market Association. The yield rose 63 basis points over the
previous six days to a two-week high.  One-month non-deliverable forwards on the rupiah advanced
1.3 percent to 11,461 per dollar, the biggest gain since Sept.
19, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The contracts are 0.6 percent stronger than the spot rate,
which appreciated 0.4 percent to 11,533 per dollar, prices from
local banks show. The rupiah lost more than 16 percent this year,
the worst performance among 24 emerging-market currencies
tracked by Bloomberg.  A daily fixing used to settle the forwards was set at
11,391 per dollar, compared with 11,429 yesterday, according to
the Association of Banks in  Singapore . One-month implied
volatility, a measure of expected moves in the exchange rate
used to price options, declined 48 basis points to 16.48 percent,
data compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
