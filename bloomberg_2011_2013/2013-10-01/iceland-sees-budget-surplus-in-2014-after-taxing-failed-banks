Iceland’s government predicted it
will be able to balance its budget next year raising taxes on
the lenders that failed in its 2008 collapse.  The budget will show a surplus of 500 million kronur ($4.2
million) in 2014, the  Finance Ministry  in Reykjavik said today.
Income will reach 587.6 billion kronur and spending 587.1
billion kronur. The ministry expects a surplus of 2.6 billion
kronur, or 0.1 percent of gross domestic product, in 2015. That
compares with an estimated 31.1 billion-krona deficit this year.  The new government, which was elected in April on pledges
to boost economic growth and complete the island’s re-emergence
from the 2008 economic collapse, also said it will cut income
taxes next year. Iceland is struggling to remove  capital
controls  put in place in 2008 after the krona plunged as much as
80 percent against the euro offshore. The restrictions are
stopping as much as $8 billion in kronur assets from being
exchanged, according to an estimate by Arion Bank hf.  “The main theme of the Treasury’s financial policy is to
reduce the state’s debts and thereby the interest burden,” the
ministry said. “It’s important to constantly review the size of
the foreign reserves, which are mostly borrowed.”  The government will raise the tax on bank assets to 0.145
percent, which will also be imposed on the failed banks in
winding-up proceedings, increasing revenue by 13 billion kronur.
Kaupthing Bank Hf, Glitnir Bank Hf and Landsbanki Islands hf all
defaulted on a combined $85 billion in 2008, forcing the island
to seek an economic bailout.  Iceland’s $14.1 billion economy will expand 1.9 percent
this year, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development estimates. That compares with a 0.6 percent
contraction in the 17-member euro area, according to the Paris-based group’s May forecast.  Finance Minister Bjarni Benediktsson introduced his
proposed 2014 budget to parliament today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
