Spanish sovereign bonds advanced,
pushing 10-year yields to a four-month low, as stocks rose on
speculation a partial shutdown of the U.S. government will deter
the  Federal Reserve  from slowing its stimulus program.  Portuguese securities also climbed as investors bet the Fed
would maintain asset purchases under its quantitative-easing
plan as a bulwark against any slowdown in the economy caused by
the first U.S. shutdown in 17 years. U.S. politicians also need
to agree on increasing the debt ceiling this month. Italian
bonds rose as Prime Minister Enrico Letta fought Silvio Berlusconi’s efforts to overthrow his ruling coalition. German
bonds declined as demand for safer assets waned.  “The market is assessing what the shutdown might mean and
what the impact on the debt ceiling might be,” said Soeren Moerch, head of fixed-income trading at  Danske Bank A/S (DANSKE)  in
Copenhagen. “This could lead to the Federal Reserve adding more
QE to counter any potential slowdown in economic recovery, and
that would benefit risky assets, including peripheral bonds.”  Spain ’s 10-year  yield  fell nine basis points, or 0.09
percentage point, to 4.21 percent at 1:14 p.m. London time after
touching 4.20 percent, the least since May 23. The 4.4 percent
security due October 2023 rose 0.73, or 7.30 euros per 1,000-euro ($1,354) face amount, to 101.555.  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index of shares climbed 0.2 percent.
The MSCI Asia Pacific Index added 0.4 percent.  Debt Ceiling  The partial U.S. shutdown will put as many as 800,000
federal employees out of work today after Congress failed to
break a partisan deadlock. Lawmakers earlier voted against a
funding bill linked to changes in President  Barack Obama ’s
health-care legislation.  No further negotiations were immediately planned. The
shutdown may lead to further confrontation on how to raise the
U.S. debt limit before an Oct. 17 deadline to avert a default.  Germany ’s 10-year bund yield climbed three basis points to
1.81 percent after dropping to 1.74 percent yesterday, the
lowest level since Aug. 13.  The rate on similar-maturity Portuguese debt declined 14
basis points to 6.54 percent after reaching 6.51 percent, the
least since Aug. 28.  Berlusconi withdrew his support for  Italy ’s five-month-old
administration on Sept. 28 and five ministers from his People of
Liberty party quit the Cabinet. Letta defied Berlusconi’s
attempts to force early elections and said he’ll request a
confidence vote for tomorrow to save his government.  The yield on Italy’s 10-year  bond  maturing in March 2024
slid six basis points to 4.52 percent.  Irish Volatility  Volatility on German bonds was the highest in euro-area
markets today, followed by those of Ireland and and  Finland ,
according to measures of 10-year debt, the yield spread between
two- and 10-year securities, and credit-default swaps.  Ireland’s bonds rose as the National Treasury Management
Agency said in statement on its website that the nation had
deferred a decision on selling debt until early 2014.  The yield on Ireland’s 3.9 percent security due March 2023
slid six basis points to 3.82 percent.  Spain’s bonds rose 9.2 percent this year through yesterday,
according to Bloomberg World Bond Indexes. Italian securities
returned 3.7 percent and German debt lost 1.4 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
