Argentina , which has no long-term
contracts to import liquefied natural gas, is set to receive a
spot cargo from  Trinidad & Tobago , shipping data show.  The SCF Polar, with a capacity of about 72,000 cubic
meters, is en route to Recalada port near  Buenos Aires ,
according to transmissions captured by IHS Fairplay on
Bloomberg. It was scheduled to dock yesterday at Recalada near
Argentina’s capital.  The vessel loaded the supercooled natural gas at Atlantic
LNG Co.’s Point Fortin terminal and departed on Sept. 16, the
data show.  Argentina imports LNG through YPF SA, the country’s largest
energy company, and state-run Energia Argentina SA, known as
Enarsa. YPF opened a qualifying process Sept. 26 for potential
sellers in its tender to buy spot cargoes for 2014. Enarsa and
YPF have issued seven spot tenders seeking as many as 150
shipments since December.  To contact the reporter on this story:
