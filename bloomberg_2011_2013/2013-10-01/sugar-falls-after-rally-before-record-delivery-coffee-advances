(Corrects date in second paragraph.)  Sugar fell in  New York , paring the
biggest gain in almost three weeks, on speculation of a record
delivery against expiring October futures. Coffee climbed.  Sugar amounting to about 1.5 million metric tons, an all-time high, will be delivered to settle the expiration on ICE
Futures U.S., James Cassidy, head of sugar trading at Newedge
Group in New York, said yesterday, mostly coming from leading
producer  Brazil . Raw sugar for delivery in March rose as much as
2.4 percent yesterday, the most since July. The October futures
settled 3.6 percent higher at 17.48 cents a pound.  “The market found support yesterday at the March mid-Bollinger Band and recovered well, but physical demand has not
been keeping pace, as evidenced by a large and weak October
expiry,”  James Kirkup , a London-based broker at ABN Amro
Markets U.K. Ltd., said by e-mail today. “The market is
obviously digesting the news on the delivery.”  Raw sugar for delivery in March slid 0.2 percent to 18.11
cents a pound by 6:43 a.m. on ICE in New York after gaining the
most since 2010 in the third quarter. Refined, or white, sugar
for delivery in December slid 0.3 percent to $484.70 a ton on
NYSE Liffe in London.  Prices fell 7.2 percent this year in New York and are set
for a third annual drop, the longest losing streak since 1992.
Supplies outpaced demand by a record 10 million tons in the
2012-13 season ended yesterday and another surplus is forecast
for the year starting today, according to the  International
Sugar Organization . The excess will be 4.66 million tons in
2013-14, says Green Pool Commodity Specialists Pty.  “It’s a natural correction from the hike we’ve seen,”
Jonathan Bouchet, a trader at Boman Capital SA in Geneva, said
by e-mail. “The surplus is substantial enough that any
important rise like yesterday’s will give the opportunity for
bears to sell more.”  Arabica coffee for delivery in December rose 0.4 percent to
$1.141 a pound in New York. Robusta coffee for delivery in
November added 0.4 percent to $1,648 a ton in London.  Cocoa for delivery in December slid 0.5 percent to $2,626 a
ton on ICE. Cocoa for the same delivery month fell 0.9 percent
to 1,691 pounds ($2,745) a ton on NYSE Liffe.  To contact the reporter on this story:
