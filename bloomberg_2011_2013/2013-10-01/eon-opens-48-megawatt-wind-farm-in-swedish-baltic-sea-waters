EON SE,  Germany ’s largest utility,
opened a Baltic Sea wind farm equipped with  Vestas Wind Systems
A/S (VWS)  turbines.  The 48-megawatt Karehamn project near the Swedish island of
Oeland cost 120 million euros ($163 million) and took 19 months
to build, EON said today in an e-mailed statement. The farm’s 16
Vestas machines will produce enough electricity for about 28,000
homes, the Dusseldorf-based utility said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
