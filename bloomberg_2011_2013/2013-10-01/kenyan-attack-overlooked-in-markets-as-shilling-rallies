Prospects for faster growth in  Kenya 
are overshadowing concern that the nation’s worst attack in 15
years will undermine confidence in the economy as the benchmark
stock index climbs the most in  Africa  and the shilling rallies.  Kenya’s currency has advanced 1.1 percent to 86.40 per
dollar since the day before the Sept. 21 raid on a shopping mall
in Nairobi, the most of 24 African currencies tracked by
Bloomberg after the Guinean Franc. Kenyan shares advanced for a
fifth day on the Nairobi Securities Exchange with the FTSE NSE
25 Index index increasing 2.8 percent since the incident.  At least 61 civilians and six soldiers died when gunmen
from Somalia’s al-Qaeda-linked al-Shabaab militia entered the
upscale Westgate shopping mall, the worst death toll since the
U.S. Embassy in Nairobi was blown up in 1998. Kenya’s $37
billion economy, the largest in East Africa, is forecast to grow
as much as 6 percent in 2013 compared with 4.6 percent last
year, according to the Treasury.  “The shilling is a bullish signifier that this is a very
resilient economy in the face of such an event,”  Aly-Khan Satchu , chief executive officer of Nairobi-based Rich Management
Ltd., an adviser to companies and wealthy individuals, said by
phone yesterday. “The performance of the shilling speaks to a
lot of demand for Kenyan assets.”  The government sold 12-year infrastructure bonds on Sept.
25 at a yield of 12.36 percent, down from 16.64 percent at the
last sale of similar securities in February 2012, after luring
almost double the demand than was offered. Kenyan  consumer
inflation  was 8.3 percent in September, compared with 6.7
percent in August, and has fallen from a peak of 19.7 percent in
November 2011.  Eurobond Sale  Kenya’s Treasury said as recently as Sept. 27 it will go
ahead with plans to sell as much as $2 billion of Eurobonds by
December.  Moody’s Investors Service said last week the attack may
curb government revenue, mostly from tourism, and is “credit
negative.” Kenya earns about $1 billion a year from the
industry, the second-biggest generator of foreign currency after
tea sales. Kenya’s long-term, foreign currency debt has been
assigned a B1 rating by Moody’s, four steps below investment
grade and on par with Zambia.  Tourism revenue fell to 96 billion shillings ($1.1 billion)
in the 12 months through June from 103 billion shillings a year
earlier as visitors stayed away before and after elections in
March, concerned about a repeat of violence after a disputed
vote in 2007, Tourism Secretary Phyllis Kandie said on Sept. 11.
Kenya’s budget shortfall may reach 7.9 percent of gross domestic
product in the fiscal year through June 2014, compared with 6.7
percent in 2012-13, the Treasury said in June.  Index Gains  While tourism may be hit, “there’s no reason to
anticipate, as Moody’s has suggested, that everything
automatically looks very negative after the attack,” said Razia Khan, the head of African economic research at Standard
Chartered Plc in  London .  On the NSE, the FTSE NSE 25 Index advanced 0.4 percent to
close at 169.25 today. The gauge’s gain of 6.9 percent in
September was the biggest since May. The Kenyan bourse has
advanced 32 percent this year, Africa’s second-best performing
stock exchange after  Ghana . The shilling traded at a record low
of 106.75 per dollar on Oct. 11, 2011.  Al-Shabaab threatened to attack Kenya after the country
invaded southern Somalia in October 2011 to fight the militants
who have been trying to establish an Islamic state in the Horn
of Africa nation since at least 2006. The militia has warned of
further bloodshed unless Kenya withdraws its forces.  “The attack didn’t necessarily erode broader market
confidence because security challenges are to an extent embedded
in the political risk scenario,” said Nema Ramkhelawan-Bhana,
Africa analyst at  FirstRand Ltd. (FSR) ’s Rand Merchant Bank in
Johannesburg. “There is a level of caution that’s broadly
priced in to the market.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
