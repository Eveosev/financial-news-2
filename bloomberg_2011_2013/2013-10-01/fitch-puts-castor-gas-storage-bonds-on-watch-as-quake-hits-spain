Fitch Ratings put 1.4 billion euros
($1.9 billion) of secured bonds issued by Spain’s Castor Gas
Storage facility on rating watch negative as an earthquake hit
an area of  Valencia  near the offshore site.  Spain’s Industry Ministry ordered the underground facility,
which is still carrying out tests, to stop injecting and
extracting gas at the site on Sept. 26 and commissioned a study
into seismic activity that had been detected in the area, the
ministry said in an e-mailed statement last week. Today, an
earthquake of magnitude 4.2 was detected at 5:32 a.m., the
National Geographic Institute said on its website.  “In a worst case scenario the project may be terminated by
the government authorities on the risk of repeated seismic
occurrences of high magnitude,” Fitch said in a statement
today.  The project, which started in 2008, is run by Escal UGS,
which is part-owned by  ACS (ACS)  SA. ACS had no comment today when
contacted by Bloomberg News. No one was immediately available to
comment at Escal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
