The U.S. Justice Department wants to
suspend proceedings in its lawsuit seeking to block the proposed
merger of  AMR Corp. (AAMRQ)  and US Airways Group Inc. because of the
federal government shutdown.  The Justice Department asked the judge overseeing the
lawsuit to stay the case until Congress restores funding, saying
its attorneys are “generally prohibited” from working except
in “very limited circumstances,” according to a filing today
in federal court in Washington.  “This is creating difficulties for the department to
perform the functions necessary to support its litigation
efforts and, accordingly, the department’s policy is to seek a
stay in all pending civil litigation,” it said.  The airlines oppose the proposed stay, the Justice
Department said in its filing. The U.S. sued the airlines in
August, saying the proposed merger would reduce competition.
Trial is scheduled to begin on Nov. 25. A hearing in the case is
set for today.  The case is U.S. v.  US Airways Group Inc. (LCC) , 13-cv-01236,
U.S. District Court,  District of Columbia  (Washington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
