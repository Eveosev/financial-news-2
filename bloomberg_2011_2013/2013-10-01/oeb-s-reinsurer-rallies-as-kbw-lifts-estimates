Dan Loeb’s Third Point Reinsurance
Ltd., which had an initial public offering in August, rallied as
analysts at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods raised their earnings
estimate on better-than-expected investment results.  The reinsurer climbed 3.1 percent to $14.94 at 4:05 p.m. in
New York after reporting that its investments managed by Loeb’s
Third Point LLC  gained 2.5 percent  in September, and 17 percent
in the first nine months of the year. Those results led the KBW
analysts to boost their earnings estimate for the third quarter
to 31 cents a share from 20 cents.  “We project annualized performance of 15 percent, but
actual results will almost certainly be much more volatile,”
analysts led by  Meyer Shields  wrote in a note yesterday.  Third Point Re highlighted Loeb’s track record when
promoting the IPO, which raised $276 million, selling shares at
$12.50. Almost all the Bermuda-based company’s investments are
managed by his hedge fund, giving investors a chance to
participate in his results without being directly invested with
Third Point LLC.  Loeb focuses on so-called event-driven investing, buying
and selling stocks or bonds of companies going through changes
like spinoffs or mergers. He has pushed Yahoo! Inc. and Sony
Corp. to make changes with the goal of driving up share prices.  His main fund returned 15 percent this year through August
and has averaged annual returns of about 17.8 percent since
inception in late 1996, according to an online  report .  To contact the reporter on this story:
