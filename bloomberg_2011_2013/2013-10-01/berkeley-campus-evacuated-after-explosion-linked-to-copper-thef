The campus of the  University of
California at Berkeley  was evacuated after a  power failure  and
explosion linked to the theft of copper wire, a university
spokesman said.  Four to six people received minor burns in the blast
yesterday and one was treated at a hospital, said Dan Mogulof,
the spokesman. About 20 people were temporarily trapped in
elevators by the failure, he said. It wasn’t clear whether
classes would be affected today.  The campus-wide blackout began about 4:30 p.m. local time.
It was followed about two hours later by the explosion in an
underground electrical vault outside California Hall, which
houses the university  chancellor’s office  near the center of
campus, as engineers were restoring power, Mogulof said.  Investigators believe the outage and explosion were linked
to the theft of copper wire “at a remote location not on the
Berkeley campus,” Mogulof said. Police are investigating the
theft and trying to find those responsible, he said.  An ammonia leak was reported in Latimer Hall, where the
Chemistry Department is located, that was probably related to
the power failure, the campus newspaper, the  Daily Californian ,
reported on its website, citing university police Lieutenant
Marc DeCoulode.  Power was being restored at about 9 p.m. local time
yesterday, Mogulof said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
