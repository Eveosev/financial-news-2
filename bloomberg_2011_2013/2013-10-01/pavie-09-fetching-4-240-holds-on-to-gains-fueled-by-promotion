A case of 2009 Chateau Pavie, a wine
estate promoted in last year’s Saint-Emilion classification,
fetched 2,610 pounds ($4,240) in the past week on Liv-ex,
consolidating a level around which it has traded since April.  Pavie prices have risen since its elevation to the ranks of
the top four Bordeaux growers in Saint-Emilion in September last
year. It now rates as a Premier Grand Cru Classe A alongside
Chateau Cheval Blanc, Chateau Ausone and Chateau Angelus in the
classification, which replaced one dating from 1996.  The 2009 vintage of Pavie has outpaced the Liv-ex Fine Wine
50 Index, which has risen 2 percent this year. While Bordeaux
wines have slipped during the past six months after the sales
campaign for the region’s 2012 vintage, some Saint-Emilion
producers have performed better than left-bank rivals.  In the year since the promotion of Pavie and Angelus,
“both have seen solid activity on the secondary market and
substantial price moves across all recent vintages,” Liv-ex
said in a market commentary blog on its Cellar Watch website.  Pavie 2009 has climbed 21 percent from the 2,150 pounds at
which it traded in August 2012, before its promotion gave a
boost to prices, according to data on Cellar Watch. The Liv-ex
50 is up 4 percent over the same period.  Merlot Grapes  A total of about 50 cases of Pavie ’09 traded on Liv-ex in
August, none for less than 2,600 pounds, while two trades last
month both took place at 2,610 pounds a case.  The estate, on the right bank of the Dordogne, was acquired
by Gerard and Chantal Perse in 1998 and has about 35 hectares
(86 acres) under vines, predominantly Merlot with some Cabernet
Franc and Cabernet Sauvignon.  The 2009 Pavie was awarded a perfect 100 points by U.S.
critic  Robert Parker , who described it in an online tasting note
in February last year as having “wonderful notes of
blackberries, crushed rocks, roasted meats, spring flowers,
cedar, blueberries, graphite and a hint of vanillin.”  The wine is the estate’s most expensive vintage since 2000,
according to merchant data compiled by Liv-ex.  To contact the reporter on this story:
