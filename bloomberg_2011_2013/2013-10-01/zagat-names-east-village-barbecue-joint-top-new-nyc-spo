Mighty Quinn’s, an East Village barbecue spot run by a former hedge funder, was named New York’s best new restaurant by the Zagat survey today.  The affordable cafeteria-style venue, where diners stand in line for brisket, pulled pork, or “Brontosaurus ribs,” is co-owned by Micha Magid, previously of  JPMorgan Chase (JPM)  and Basswood Partners.  Briskettown, a Williamsburg barbecue spot, was also named among the top newcomers, along with Jean-Georges Vongerichten’s ABC Cocina, Harold Dieterle’s The Marrow, and others.  The 2014 survey is based on the responses of 48,114 participants.  “Younger people are obviously taking over the market,” said Tim Zagat, the guide’s co-founder. “They’re looking for good food that costs less.”  Last year, the  top newcomer  was Danny Meyer’s North End Grill, a high-end American restaurant near the headquarters of  Goldman Sachs. (GS)   Eric Ripert’s seafood temple, Le Bernardin, kept its top spot in the food and popularity categories, while Thomas Keller’s uber-expensive Per Se retained its rating as having the city’s best service. Asiate at the Mandarin Oriental was again ranked as having top decor.  Red October  Zagat, owned by  Google Inc. (GOOG) , is one of the two red-hued restaurant guides releasing its yearly New York City restaurant recommendations today, along with the Michelin Guide.  While Michelin doles out one, two or three stars on the basis of reports filed by anonymous inspectors, Zagat collects its rankings from survey participants. Venues are ranked on a scale of 0-30 according to food, service and decor.  Carbone, the expensive new Italian-American restaurant by the team behind Torrisi, received a food score of 21, a lower ranking than Midtown’s Harry Cipriani, though the guide said Carbone received a low number of survey responses, rendering that score “less reliable.”  Two new French spots -- Andrew Carmellini’s Lafayette and Gabe Stulman’s Montmartre -- both received scores of 19 for their food, although the guide again noted that those ratings were based on a lower number of responses.  “I was surprised it didn’t do better,” Tim Zagat said of Lafayette.  The low-vote Guy’s American Kitchen & Bar, owned by Food Network personality Guy Fieri, and The Beatrice Inn, owned by Vanity Fair’s Graydon Carter, received food ratings of 17. Both restaurants have been the subject of negative reviews from local critics.  Zagat reported 42 closings, down from 60 in the previous guide. The count of restaurant openings fell to 111, down from last year’s 119 and the previous year’s 135.  Ratings and reviews from the “2014 NYC Restaurant Survey” will available at Zagat.com.
