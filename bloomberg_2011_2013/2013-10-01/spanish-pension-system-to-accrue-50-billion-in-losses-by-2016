Spain’s pension system will generate
36.5 billion euros ($50 billion) of losses by the end of 2016,
adding to the stress on public finances, Labor Minister Fatima Banez said today.  The social-security system has lost 3.2 million
contributors since 2007 and has been running an annual deficit
since 2010, Banez told the parliamentary pensions committee in
 Madrid . The system’s reserve funds are set to cover 23.6 billion
euros of losses for 2012 and 2013, she said.  Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy  is trying to limit  liabilities 
to retirees by establishing a link between benefits and revenue
in the pension system after being forced to bail out the banking
system last year. The government may also be on the hook to
rescue a network of privately owned highways around Madrid and
has twice been forced to put up money to cover losses in the
electricity system.  The pension-reserve fund was set up to provide a buffer to
cover the effects of the ageing population and the Rajoy has
used it to fund higher pensions as the number of contributors
paying in slumped. The fund holds 59 billion euros at present
and will pay out 6.1 billion euros by the of this year to cover
payments to retirees, Banez said.  The number of pensioners is increasing at 100,000 per year
and  Spain  will have 9 million fewer people of working age to
support retirees by 2050, Banez said. By then, 30 percent of the
population will be over 50.  Banez presented the draft pension reform law to Parliament
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
