The U.S. Supreme Court will hear two
appeals that would make it easier for targets of patent suits to
collect attorneys’ fees, agreeing to consider steps that some
companies say would deter groundless litigation.  The court today said it will hear arguments from Octane
Fitness LLC, which is seeking $1.3 million in fees after
defeating a patent suit over exercise equipment. The justices
also accepted an appeal by Highmark Inc., a Pennsylvania insurer
asking for $5 million from a company that unsuccessfully sued
for patent infringement.  Companies targeted by patent suits, including  Google Inc. (GOOG) ,
say fee awards are needed to stem a costly trend of frivolous
litigation. A White House report said more than 100,000
companies were threatened last year with infringement suits by
businesses whose sole mission is to extract royalty revenue.
Those entities, dubbed “patent trolls” by critics, filed 19
percent of all patent lawsuits from 2007 to 2011,  according  to
the Government Accountability Office.  “With the average patent case costing millions of dollars
to litigate, the threat of paying the prevailing party’s
attorney’s fees is a powerful deterrent to frivolous claims and
litigation mischief,” the Blue Cross and Blue Shield
Association, a Washington-based trade group, argued in court
papers urging the high court to intervene in the Highmark case.  ‘Exceptional Cases’  The U.S. Patent Act says fees can be awarded “in
exceptional cases.” Octane contends the federal appeals court
that handles patent cases, the  U.S. Court of Appeals  for the
Federal Circuit in  Washington , has developed a “rigid and
virtually insurmountable test” for implementing that statutory
language.  Under the Federal Circuit test, a suit must be
“objectively baseless” and have been filed in bad faith.
Octane says trial judges instead should be able to award fees
when a patent holder “unreasonably pursues a case having an
objectively low likelihood of success.”  Octane was sued by Icon Health & Fitness Inc., a rival
exercise equipment maker, over a component in elliptical
machines. Icon urged the Supreme Court not to take up the case,
saying Octane is seeking a standard that “is nowhere to be
found in historical precedent or the legislative history” of
the Patent Act.  Icon said its suit against Octane, while unsuccessful, was
“not exceptional by any precedential measure.”  Allcare Health  Highmark raises a related issue, saying the Federal Circuit
should have deferred to a trial judge’s conclusion that the suit
was so frivolous that fees were warranted.  The Federal Circuit said it wouldn’t accept U.S. District
Judge Terry Means’s assessment of the suit by Allcare Health
Management Systems Inc. Voting 2-1, the panel reversed part of
the judge’s finding that the suit was objectively baseless. The
appeals court ordered recalculation of the fee award.  Allcare’s patent, which it acquired from an inventor for
$75,000, covers a method of using a computer to generate a list
of possible treatments based on symptom data entered by a
doctor.  Allcare contended the patent also covers a method for
determining whether a proposed treatment will require pre-approval from the insurer. In rejecting Means’s conclusion, the
Federal Circuit said Allcare’s reading of the patent, while
wrong, was “not unreasonable.”  Icon, the company that makes NordicTrack machines, is based
in Logan,  Utah . Octane is based in Brooklyn Park,  Minnesota .  Retail Federation  Google and its allies, including the  National Retail
Federation , are also pushing Congress to make it easier for
penalties to be imposed. One proposal, by House Judiciary
Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte, a Virginia Republican, would
force the losers of patent cases to pay the winners’ expenses in
most cases.  Judges rarely order patent owners who lose their cases to
pay the other side, and the Federal Circuit has been grappling
with the issue. In December, it ordered a federal judge in  Texas 
to impose sanctions against a company for making unreasonable
claims of what its patent covered.  Chief Judge Randall Rader, co-authoring an opinion piece
published by the  New York  Times in June, urged courts to impose
more penalties.  The high cost of litigation often prompts companies to pay
the patent owner even if they think it is a spurious claim, the
GAO found.  The  Supreme Court  will hear arguments and rule by early
July in the two cases. The cases are Octane Fitness v. Icon
Health & Fitness, 12-1184, and Highmark v. Allcare Health
Management Systems, 12-1163.  To contact the reporter on this story:
