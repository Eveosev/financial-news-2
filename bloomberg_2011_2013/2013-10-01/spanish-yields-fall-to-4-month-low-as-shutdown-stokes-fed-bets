Spanish sovereign bonds rose, pushing
10-year yields to the lowest level in four months, amid
speculation a partial shutdown of the U.S. government will deter
the  Federal Reserve  from slowing its debt-purchase program.  Portuguese securities advanced for a fourth day as
investors bet the Fed will keep buying assets under its
quantitative-easing plan as a bulwark against any slowdown in
the economy caused by the first U.S. shutdown in 17 years. U.S.
politicians also need to agree on increasing the debt ceiling
this month. Italian bonds gained as Prime Minister Enrico Letta
fought Silvio Berlusconi’s efforts to overthrow his ruling
coalition. German bonds fell as demand for safer assets waned.  “The market is assessing what the shutdown might mean and
what the impact on the debt ceiling might be,” said Soeren Moerch, head of fixed-income trading at  Danske Bank A/S (DANSKE)  in
Copenhagen. “This could lead to the Federal Reserve adding more
QE to counter any potential slowdown in economic recovery, and
that would benefit risky assets, including peripheral bonds.”  Spain ’s  10-year yield  fell 13 basis points, or 0.13
percentage point, to 4.17 percent at 4:53 p.m. London time after
dropping to 4.16 percent, the lowest since May 22. The 4.4
percent bond due in October 2023 rose 1.035, or 10.35 euros per
1,000-euro ($1,354) face amount, to 101.86. The rate decline was
the steepest since July 1.  The yield on 10-year  Portuguese securities  declined nine
basis points to 6.59 percent after falling to 6.51 percent, the
least since Aug. 28.  Partial Shutdown  The partial U.S. shutdown will put as many as 800,000
federal employees out of work today after Congress failed to
break a partisan deadlock. Lawmakers voted against a funding
bill linked to changes in President  Barack Obama ’s health-care
legislation. The shutdown may lead to further confrontation on
how to raise the U.S. debt limit before an Oct. 17 deadline to
avert a default.  Fed policy makers maintained their monthly bond purchases
at $85 billion at their most recent meeting on Sept. 17-18. Fed
Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said in May the central bank could slow
the pace of stimulus if the labor market improved.  Italy ’s bonds advanced even amid concern Letta’s five-month
old government is on the verge of collapse.  Berlusconi withdrew his support for the administration on
Sept. 28 and five ministers from his People of Liberty party
quit the Cabinet. Letta said he’ll request a confidence vote for
tomorrow to save his government.  The yield on Italy’s 10-year 4.5 percent  bond  maturing in
March 2024, which became the new benchmark security today,
dropped 14 basis points to 4.43 percent.  Bunds Decline  Germany ’s  10-year bund yield  climbed two basis points to
1.80 percent after dropping to 1.74 percent yesterday, the
lowest level since Aug. 13.  Ireland’s bonds rose for a second day as the National
Treasury Management Agency said the nation had deferred a
decision on selling debt until early 2014.  The yield on Ireland’s 3.9 percent security due in March
2023 dropped six basis points to 3.83 percent.  Volatility on Spanish bonds was the highest in euro-area
markets today, followed by those of Italy and Ireland, according
to measures of 10-year debt, the yield spread between two- and
10-year securities, and credit-default swaps.  Spanish bonds returned 9.2 percent this year through
yesterday, according to Bloomberg World Bond Indexes. Italian
securities rose 3.7 percent and Germany’s lost 1.4 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
