Warren Buffett ’s  Berkshire Hathaway
Inc. (BRK/A)  will get 13.1 million shares of Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
after exercising a warrant tied to a 2008 investment in the Wall
Street bank.  The shares will be delivered on Oct. 4 to Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire, according to a Business Wire statement today
from the bank. The stake is valued at about $2.1 billion based
on the $159 closing price today of Goldman Sachs stock.  Berkshire becomes the seventh-largest shareholder of
Goldman Sachs, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Buffett,
Berkshire’s chairman and chief executive officer, also got a $5
billion preferred stake for the original investment, which
Goldman redeemed in 2011 at a 10 percent premium.  Berkshire can’t sell its shares until after the investment
bank reports third-quarter results this month. Buffett and
Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd C. Blankfein have said that Berkshire
intends to remain a long-term investor.  To contact the reporter on this story:
