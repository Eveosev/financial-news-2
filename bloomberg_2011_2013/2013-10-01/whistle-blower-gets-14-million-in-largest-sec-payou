The U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission awarded more than $14 million to a whistle-blower
whose tip allowed regulators to recover investor funds through
an enforcement case, the agency said in a statement today.  The award is the largest ever made by the SEC, which was
given authority in the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial regulation law
to reward people who come forward and provide original
information that leads to successful enforcement actions. The
agency can issue awards that are between 10 and 30 percent of
the money collected from the wrongdoer.  “Our whistle-blower program already has had a big impact
on our investigations by providing us with high quality,
meaningful tips” SEC Chairman Mary Jo White said in a
statement. “We hope an award like this encourages more
individuals with information to come forward.”  The SEC’s announcement didn’t name the whistle-blower or
the case that resulted from the tip.  The agency received 3,001 whistle-blower complaints last
year. It made its first payment to a whistle-blower in August
2012, when it gave $50,000 to a tipster who helped the SEC stop
a multi-million dollar fraud scheme, the SEC said in its most
recent report on the program.  To contact the reporter on this story:
