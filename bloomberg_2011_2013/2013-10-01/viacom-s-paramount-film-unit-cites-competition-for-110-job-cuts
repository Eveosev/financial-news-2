Viacom Inc. (VIA) ’s Paramount Pictures
plans to eliminate 110 jobs across several departments, citing a
competitive climate for moviemaking.  The cuts will come in finance, human resources, information
technology, international home-media distribution, legal and
marketing, the Los Angeles-based studio said in an e-mailed
statement yesterday. Paramount has about 2,200 employees.  “We are confident that these changes will allow us to
manage our business with greater speed and flexibility and fully
capitalize on opportunities in the global entertainment
market,” Chief Operating Officer Frederick Huntsberry said in
the statement. “We have an extraordinary team at Paramount, a
strong slate of upcoming films and exciting plans for re-entry
into television production.”  The business,  founded  in 1912, ranks last among the six
largest studios this year, with $727.8 million in domestic
ticket sales, according to researcher Box Office Mojo. Its top-grossing pictures so far in 2013 are “Star Trek Into Darkness”
and “World War Z.”  Movie releases later this year include the Martin Scorsese-
directed “The Wolf of Wall Street” in November and “Anchorman
2: The Legend Continues” in December. The Wrap.com reported on
the cuts earlier.  Viacom, also parent of the Nickelodeon and MTV cable
networks,  lost  1.8 percent to $82.83 at the close in New York.
Class B shares of the company, which is controlled by Sumner Redstone, have gained 57 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
