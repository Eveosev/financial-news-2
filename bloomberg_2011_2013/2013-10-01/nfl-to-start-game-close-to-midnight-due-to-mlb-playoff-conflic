The  National Football League  will
kick off its final Week 5 game just before midnight Eastern time
because of a conflict with the Major League Baseball playoffs.  The NFL last night moved the Oct. 6 game between the
Oakland Raiders and San Diego Chargers in Oakland, California,
to an 8:35 p.m. local start time. For those East Coast football
fans who plan to watch the game on the NFL Network, kickoff is
now scheduled for 11:35 p.m. New York time.  The game at the O.co Coliseum had been set to start at 4:25
p.m. New York time.  The Raiders share the stadium with the  Oakland Athletics ,
who are hosting an MLB playoff game against the Detroit Tigers
at night on Oct. 5. Because the stadium requires time to convert
to host a football game, the NFL said it had to change the start
time for the Raiders-Chargers matchup.  To contact the reporter on this story:
