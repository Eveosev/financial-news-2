Captain Michael Clarke will miss
Australia’s one-day cricket tour of  India  after his chronic back
injury failed to respond to its usual treatment program.  George Bailey will replace Clarke as captain for the seven-game series starting Oct. 10 in Rajkot, with Callum Ferguson
taking his batting spot, Cricket Australia said today.  “Michael Clarke has a longstanding low back injury that
requires ongoing management,” Australia team physiotherapist
 Alex Kountouris  said in an e-mailed statement. “During the
recent England series his injury flared up again and
has been slow to improve with his regular treatment regime.”  Clarke will require a “more extensive rehabilitation
period” before he returns to competitive cricket, Kountouris
added. Australia is scheduled to host England in a five-Test
Ashes series starting Nov. 21 in Brisbane.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
