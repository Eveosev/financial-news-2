Bob Kurland, who was one of the first
centers in college basketball to be almost 7 feet (2.13 meters)
tall and helped Oklahoma A&M win back-to-back national
championships in 1945-46, has died. He was 88.  Kurland passed away in his sleep at his home in south
 Florida  on Sept. 29 following a long illness, the school -- now
Oklahoma State University -- said in a statement.  Kurland played for Hall of Fame coach Henry Iba at Oklahoma
A&M and was a consensus first-team All-American for three
straight seasons from 1944 through 1946. He helped the Aggies
become the first school to win consecutive titles while being
named the outstanding player of the National Collegiate Athletic
Association tournament both years.  “We are deeply saddened by the passing of one of the
greatest college basketball players to ever play the game,”
Oklahoma State men’s basketball coach Travis Ford said in a
 statement . “Bob Kurland was instrumental in putting Oklahoma
State on the college basketball map.”  Kurland was the nation’s leading scorer in 1946, yet was
best known for his defensive presence. The NCAA in 1944
instituted goaltending in part because of Kurland’s ability to
grab or block opposing shots in the air as they were headed
downward toward the basket.  Kurland was enshrined in 1961 by the Naismith Memorial
Basketball Hall of Fame, which lists his size at 6-foot-10.
Oklahoma State identifies him as a 7-footer.  Kurland, who didn’t pursue a professional basketball
career, later led the U.S. to two Olympic gold medals at the
1948 London Games and the 1952 Helsinki Games. He was the first
basketball player to win two Olympic gold medals.  To contact the reporter on this story:
