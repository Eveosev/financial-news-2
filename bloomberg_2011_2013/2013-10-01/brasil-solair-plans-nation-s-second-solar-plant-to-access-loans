Brasil Solair , a Brazilian developer
of rooftop power plants, is building the nation’s second solar-panel factory to help customers qualify for state financing
that’s available for purchases of locally produced equipment.  The 9 million-real ($4 million) facility, in the
northeastern city of Joao Pessoa, will be completed in December
and have annual production capacity of 300,000 panels, Nelson
Silveira, the company’s president, said today in a telephone
interview. It will also make inverters to convert direct-current
electricity from panels into alternating-current power that’s
transmitted on a grid.  Brazilian homeowners are eligible for low-cost loans from
the country’s development bank Banco Nacional de Desenvolvimento
Economico & Social for solar systems with at least 60 percent
domestic components, he said.  “With this factory we can meet the requirement,” he said.
“BNDES offers loans with annual interest rates of 6 percent
compared to 13 or 14 percent for loans from commercial banks.”  The company, based in Rio de Janeiro, has set aside 11
million reais to buy raw materials and build up four months of
inventory, he said.  Brazil ’s first solar-panel factory is owned by Tecnometal
Equipamentos Ltda. and began production at the end of 2011,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg New Energy Finance.  To contact the reporter on this story:
