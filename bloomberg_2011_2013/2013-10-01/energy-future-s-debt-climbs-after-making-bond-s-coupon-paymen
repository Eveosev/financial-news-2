Bonds of Energy Future Holdings Corp.
climbed after the electricity provider that’s approaching
bankruptcy made a planned coupon payment.  The former TXU Corp.’s $1.23 billion of 15 percent notes
due April 2021 rose 1 cent to 23.5 cents on the dollar as of
3:50 p.m. in  New York , according to Trace, the bond-price
reporting system of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.
That’s the highest intraday price since Aug. 20.  Those second-lien securities pay interest four times each
year, including Oct. 1, according to an Oct. 8, 2010, regulatory
filing. The power generator owed as much as $59 million in
interest payments today, according to a Sept. 29 report by debt-researcher CreditSights Inc.  Texas’s largest electricity provider made the coupon
payment today as scheduled, according to a person with knowledge
of the transaction who asked not to be identified, citing lack
of authorization to speak publicly  Adam McGill, a spokesman for the Dallas-based company,
declined to comment on the interest payment.  Texas’s largest electricity provider has struggled with its
debt load since it was taken private in 2007 by KKR & Co., TPG
Capital and Goldman Sachs Capital Partners for a record $48
billion.  Creditors are working on a bankruptcy proposal to cut the
company’s $43.6 billion of obligations before it has to make
$270 million of coupon payments Nov. 1. Lenders turned down an
initial proposal advanced by the company, according to an April
15 regulatory filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
