A wastewater project that consists of
building two treatment plants, expanding three and almost 700
kilometers (435 miles) of sewers in the northern delta part of
the Nile River’s western branch will receive European Investment
Bank funding.  More than half, or 77 million euros ($104 million), of the
164 million-euro project’s costs in Kafr El Sheikh governorate
will come from the European Union’s lending arm. The volume and
quality of fish in Lake Burullus where 70 percent of the
country’s fishing industry occurs and improved conditions for
tourism on the Mediterranean coast will be among the benefits,
the Luxembourg-based bank said today in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
