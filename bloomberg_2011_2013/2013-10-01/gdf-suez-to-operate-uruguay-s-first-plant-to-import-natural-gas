GDF Suez (GSZ) , France’s biggest supplier
of  natural gas , agreed to operate a floating liquefied natural
gas import terminal in Uruguay.  The platform, which will be the South American nation’s
first, is scheduled to start operating in 2015 and GDF will
operate it for the Uruguay government, according to a statement
from GDF Suez today. The plant will have a storage capacity of
263,000 cubic meters of gas, and will be built by Mitsui OSK
Lines Ltd.  The tender process for the LNG plant started last year, as
Uruguay, which doesn’t produce oil or gas, seeks to cut its
dependency on gas shipments from  Argentina .  Uruguay has started opening tenders for offshore oil
exploration in 2010, with companies including Petroleo
Brasileiro SA, YPF SA and Galp Energia SGPS SA winning
exploration licenses. Total SA, BG Group Plc, Tullow Oil Plc and
BP Group Plc were awarded contracts last year in a second
tender.  Signing the agreement with GDF is a “landmark in Uruguay’s
energy strategy as it will allow to reduce energy costs and
vulnerabilities,” Industry Minister Roberto Kreimerman told
reporters in Montevideo today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
