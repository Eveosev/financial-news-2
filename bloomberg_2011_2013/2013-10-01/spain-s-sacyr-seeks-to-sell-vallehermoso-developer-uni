Sacyr (SYV)  SA, a Spanish builder, plans to
sell its Vallehermoso property-development unit after receiving
expressions of interest from potential buyers.  The  board  decided at a meeting yesterday to put
Vallehermoso up for sale, the Madrid-based company said in a
regulatory filing today. None of the expressions of interest
have been confirmed yet, Sacyr said. Shares rose as much as 5
percent in Madrid trading today.  “If there are people willing to buy this asset, then it
may be good news,” said Juan Carlos Calvo, an  analyst  at Banco
Espirito Santo in Madrid with a buy rating on Sacyr. “It
carries a lot of debt and doesn’t generate much revenue.”  Spanish banks and companies are seeking buyers for real
estate assets as the country’s  bad bank  steps up efforts to sell
assets backed by soured property loans. Vallehermoso, which has
a stock of 620 homes, accounted for 1.2 billion euros ($1.63
billion) of Sacyr’s 8.4 billion euros of net debt in June and
had a first-half net loss of 40.1 million euros on sales of 56
million euros.  Sacyr was up 4.2 percent at 3.55 euros as of 12:59 p.m. in
 Madrid . The shares, which more than doubled this year, are down
from a peak of 54 euros in November 2006.  To contact the reporter on this story:
