Ecolab Inc. (ECL) , the largest provider of
chemicals and services for water and wastewater treatment, is
raising prices at its Nalco unit in response to higher raw
material costs.  Prices for most Nalco water and process services programs
will rise by 5 percent to 15 percent with immediate effect,  St.
Paul , Minnesota-based Ecolab said today in a statement. It also
cited rising energy and transport costs for the increase.  Ecolab is a water, cleaning supplies and energy technology
company which reported $12 billion in revenue last year. Its
shares have  risen  52 percent in the past year.  Nalco is contacting customers directly to discuss the price
increases which will vary by country and product, the statement
showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
