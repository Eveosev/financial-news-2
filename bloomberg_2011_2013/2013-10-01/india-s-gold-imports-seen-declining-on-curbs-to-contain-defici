Gold purchases by India, the world’s
largest user, may fall 5.3 percent this year as the government
curbs imports to contain a record current-account deficit.  Inbound shipments are seen at 800 metric tons in the 12
months through March, compared with 845 tons a year earlier,
Economic Affairs Secretary Arvind Mayaram told reporters in New
Delhi today. Falling bullion imports may help the nation cap the
 current-account deficit  at $70 billion this year, he said.  India raised the tax on imports for a third time this year
in August to curtail gold demand and tackle the record deficit
that weakened the rupee to an all-time low. Higher taxes and
tighter rules on financing imports have reduced demand,
prompting analysts including Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to predict
a moderation in the nation’s broadest measure of trade.  “It is estimated that gold imports could be restricted”
with the measures announced in August, Mayaram said. “The
current account deficit will be contained at $70 billion.”  The deficit was $21.8 billion in April through June,
compared with $18.1 billion in the previous quarter, the Reserve
Bank of  India  said in a statement in Mumbai yesterday. The gap
was a record $87.8 billion in the year ended March 31. Imports
fell for three straight months through August. Exports climbed
13 percent in August from a year earlier and the trade deficit
narrowed to $10.9 billion, from $20.1 billion in May.  “We expect an improvement in the current account due to a
falling trade deficit,” Goldman Group analysts Tushar Poddar
and Vishal Vaibhaw said in a note. The current-account shortfall
will narrow to 3.5 percent of  gross domestic product  in the year
ending March 2014, from 4.8 percent of GDP the previous fiscal
year, they said.  Declining Trend  Gold  imports  were 58.37 tons between July 1 and Sept. 25
compared with 335.31 tons in the three months ended June 30, the
finance ministry said in a statement today. The declining trend
will continue, it said.  Purchases may not be more than 150 tons in the six months
through December, according to Bachhraj Bamalwa, a director at
the All India Gems & Jewellery Trade Federation. The central
bank on July 22 made it mandatory for importers to set aside 20
percent for re-exports as jewelry, almost halting imports by by
traders and banks.  Spot gold gained 0.2 percent to $1,331.04 an ounce at 3:47
p.m. in Mumbai, paring losses to 21 percent this year. Gold for
delivery in October fell 0.4 percent to 30,315 ($487) rupees per
10 grams on the  Multi Commodity Exchange of India Ltd. (MCX)   Gold consumption in India, which ships in almost all the
bullion it uses, accounted for 20 percent of global demand in
2012, according to data from the World Gold Council.  To contact the reporters on this story:
