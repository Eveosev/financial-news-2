The Pentagon today suspended
intercollegiate athletic competition at its service academies
because of the federal government shutdown, leaving this
weekend’s Navy-Air Force football game in doubt, according to
the  U.S. Naval Academy .  The Naval Academy’s soccer game against  Howard University 
scheduled for tonight has been canceled, the Academy said in a
statement. The Navy’s undergraduate college said it will
announce a decision on the scheduled Oct. 5 football game
against the Air Force Academy by noon on Oct. 3.  Asked how the shutdown is affecting civilian workers at the
service academies, Frank DeMaro, a spokesman for the U.S.
Military Academy at  West Point , said the institution was waiting
to hear from Army headquarters on how to proceed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
