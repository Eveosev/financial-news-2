Facebook  Inc., operator of the
world’s most popular social-networking service, unveiled a
mobile-advertising tool aimed at encouraging people to use
applications already installed on their smartphones.  The new service links users to other apps via promotions
that appear within Facebook’s main news feed, directing them to
a specific product, such as a song or hotel booking.  Facebook is stepping up efforts to lure advertisers on
mobile as more members access the service from smartphones and
tablets. More than 40 percent of ad dollars came from wireless
devices in the second quarter, up from about 30 percent in the
previous period. While software developers have used Facebook
ads to drive more than 145 million downloads of their apps, they
need to keep users engaged and coming back, Menlo Park,
California-based Facebook said in a  blog posting  yesterday.  “Our aim is to provide an end-to-end mobile solution that
helps app developers reach the right people, acquire new users,
keep those users engaged, and measure the performance of their
campaigns,” Facebook said on its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
