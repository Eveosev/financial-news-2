Canadian  stocks  rose the most in
almost two weeks as investors speculated the impact of the first
U.S. government shutdown in 17 years would be limited.  Air Canada (AC/B)  increased 6.2 percent to pace gains among
industrial stocks. Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc.
climbed 4 percent after one of its units agreed to a licensing
deal for a skin product.  Airboss of America Corp.  surged 9.3
percent after agreeing to acquire Flexible Products Co. Semafo
Inc. and Barrick Gold Corp. dropped more than 3.4 percent as the
price of gold slumped below $1,300 to a seven-week low.  The  Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index (SPTSX)  rose 60.25
points, or 0.5 percent, to 12,847.44 at 4 p.m. in Toronto, the
biggest gain since Sept. 18. The index rallied 5.4 percent in
the last quarter, the best quarterly gain in a year. Trading
volume was 9.9 percent higher than the 30-day average today.  “Part of it may be the market has priced in a short
shutdown of the U.S. government, but if it’s extended and you
run into the debt impasse as well it could get messy,” said
 Irwin Michael , portfolio manager with ABC Funds in Toronto. The
firm manages about C$800 million ($775 million). “Investors
want to get through one roadblock at a time so hopefully the
shutdown will be short.”  The U.S. government started a shutdown that will idle as
many as 800,000 federal workers as Republicans and Democrats
failed to negotiate a resolution over spending legislation.
Congress now faces a dispute over raising the $16.7 trillion
debt ceiling this month. The Treasury has said measures to avoid
exceeding the borrowing limit will be exhausted on Oct. 17.  Political Suicide  “It would be political suicide for the Republicans to risk
being seen as pushing the shutdown beyond October,” said  Avery Shenfeld , chief economist with  CIBC World Markets , in a note to
clients. “Markets could still become more fretful if we
actually cross the debt ceiling deadline, but ultimately any
market moves would be reversed as the crisis passed.”  National Bank of Canada  gained 0.7 percent to C$85.69 and
Bank of Montreal rose 0.6 percent to C$69.18. The S&P/TSX
Financials Index added 0.6 percent, for the highest close in
more than five years.  Pacific Rubiales Energy Corp. climbed 4.1 percent to
C$21.17 and Talisman Energy Inc. increased 4.9 percent to
C$12.40 as  energy stocks  closed at the highest level since July.  Crude for November delivery slipped 0.3 percent to $102.04
a barrel in New York for a third day of declines.  “Crude remains above $100.  Oil companies  will do quite
well in this environment if you believe the economy is slowly
improving,” Michael said.  Management Shuffle  Encana Corp. (ECA)  rose 0.8 percent to C$17.94 after
restructuring its senior  management  team. Greg Pardy, analyst
with Royal Bank of Canada, said in a note the changes are
“positive” as establishing senior leadership is important to
Encana’s game plan.  Valeant Pharmaceuticals jumped 4 percent to C$111.66, a
record high, after unit Obagi Medical Products said yesterday it
has acquired a global exclusive license to market a skin
lightening compound from Sirona Biochem Corp.  Air Canada, the  top-performing  stock in the S&P/TSX this
year, climbed 6.2 percent to C$3.75 as industrial shares added
1.5 percent as a group. Air Canada, the nation’s largest
airline, has jumped 114 percent this year.  Airboss, a rubber-based products maker, soared 9.3 percent
to C$7.20, the highest since July 2011. The company said
yesterday it will acquire Flexible Products in a deal worth
about $51 million.  Semafo sank 9.3 percent to C$2.25 and Barrick Gold
retreated 3.4 percent to C$18.60 as gold for December delivery
tumbled 3.1 percent to $1,286.10 an ounce in  New York . Gold has
slumped 23 percent this year, headed for the first annual loss
since 2000.  To contact the reporter on this story:
