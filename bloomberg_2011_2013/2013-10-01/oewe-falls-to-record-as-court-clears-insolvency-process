Loewe AG (LOEK) , the German maker of high-end televisions that applied for creditor protection more than
two months ago, fell to a record after a court in Coburg
approved a plan for a self-administered insolvency process.  Loewe  plunged  as much as 48 percent to 3.20 euros and was
trading down 35 percent at 3.97 euros at 11:39 a.m. in
Frankfurt, the lowest since the company’s July 1999 initial
public offering, based on closing prices. Volume was seven times
the three-month daily average.  The manufacturer was founded in Berlin in 1923 by Siegmund
and David Ludwig Loewe, and presented the world’s first
electronic TV transmission at the Berlin Radio Show eight years
later. In recent years, Kronach-based Loewe has struggled to win
buyers for its home entertainment systems as the European
sovereign-debt crisis eroded consumer demand. The company filed
for protection from lenders on July 16.  Loewe “will remain fully operational” as it reorganizes,
the company said today in a statement to the stock exchange.
“The restructuring process initiated by the executive board
will also continue as before, focusing entirely on concluding
the meetings with investors.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
