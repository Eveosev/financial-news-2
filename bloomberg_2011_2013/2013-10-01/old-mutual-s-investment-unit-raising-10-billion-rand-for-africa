Old Mutual Plc (OML) ’s investment arm plans
to raise as much as 10 billion rand ($994 million) for
agriculture, infrastructure and private-equity funds in Africa.  “There are a lot of opportunities and a lot of optimism
about Africa,” Diane Radley, chief executive office of Cape
Town-based Old Mutual Investment Group, said in an interview
today. “The Africa investments are still in their infancy. It’s
a five- to 10-year journey.”  The private-equity fund has raised 2 billion rand and will
probably close within two years after reaching a target of 3.5
billion rand, said Radley. Old Mutual’s investment unit also
plans a fund that will invest in African mutual funds, an impact
fund targeting development initiatives, including housing, and
possibly health funds, she said.  “Private equity is a great African opportunity because
 capital markets  can be illiquid,” said Radley, who was
attending the United Nations Principles of Responsible
Investment conference in  Cape Town .  Africa is attracting private-equity firms, including
 Carlyle Group LP (CG)  and Actis LLP, with faster economic growth
rates than developed nations. The potential generated by the
continent’s 1 billion consumers has created a $25 billion
private-equity industry.  Old Mutual, Africa’s largest insurer, has separately set
aside 5 billion rand to buy assets in Africa.  To contact the reporter on this story:
