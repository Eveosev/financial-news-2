Former Wimbeldon finalist David Nalbandian announced his retirement from tennis because of
injury problems.  Nalbandian, a 31-year-old from Argentina, reached a career-high ranking of third in the world and was runner-up to
 Australia ’s Leyton Hewitt in the 2002 Wimbledon final. He
reached the semifinals of tennis’s other three grand slams
during a 13-year professional career.  Nalbandian, speaking at a press conference in Buenos Aires,
cited a persistant shoulder injury for his exit from the game.
He’ll play two exhibition games in November against 13-time
major champion Rafael Nadal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
