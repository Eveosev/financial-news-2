Kraft Foods Group Inc. (KRFT) , the North
American packaged foods company that split off its snacks
business last year, said it will boost its quarterly dividend by
5 percent to 52.5 cents a share.  “Today’s dividend increase reflects our commitment to
return cash to our shareholders and is consistent with our plans
to consistently grow our dividend at a mid-single digit rate
over time,” Chief Executive Officer Tony Vernon said in a
statement.  Kraft, based in Northfield, Illinois, split off its snacks
division, now called  Mondelez International Inc. (MDLZ) , a year ago. In
June, the company said it would expand to six business units in
order to reduce the complexity of managing a disparate portfolio
while also increasing focus on brand-building.  The stock rose 0.9 percent to $52.96 at the close in  New
York  today, taking its gain for the year to 16 percent.  This dividend is payable on Oct. 25 to shareholders of
record as of Oct. 11, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
