The Federal Reserve Bank of New York
drained $4.507 billion in reserves from the banking system in a
test of a fixed-rate reverse repo facility.  The program may be used to aid the central bank when it
tightens monetary policy. The operation at a fixed-rate of 0.01
percent is open to the Fed’s 139 tri-party reverse repo
counterparties, which includes 94 money market mutual funds, six
government-sponsored entities, 18 banks and the Fed’s 21 primary
dealers. The collateral for the transactions has been limited to
Treasury debt.  Fed policy makers, while still buying bonds to support the
economy, have also been developing methods to eventually help
withdraw record monetary accommodation. Along with raising the
overnight bank lending rate, Fed officials have said they may
use tools including reverse repos to withdraw or neutralize cash
in the banking system.  In a reverse repo, the Fed lends securities for a set
period, temporarily draining cash from the banking system. At
maturity, the securities are returned to the Fed, and the cash
to its counterparties.  To contact the reporters; on this story:
