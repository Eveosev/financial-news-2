India ’s rupee rose, halting a two-day
loss, after the current-account deficit widened by less than
economists predicted, helping offset concern that a U.S.
government shutdown will damp capital inflows.  The  shortfall  in the broadest measure of trade was $21.8
billion in the quarter ended June compared with $18.1 billion in
the previous three months, the  Reserve Bank  of India said in a
statement in Mumbai yesterday after markets closed. The median
of 26 estimates in a Bloomberg News survey was for a $23 billion
gap. The U.S. began its first shutdown in 17 years today amid a
deadlock in Congress over government spending plans and
President  Barack Obama ’s health-care law.  “The current-account deficit will continue to show
improvement and this leads us to believe that significant
depreciation bias for the rupee is over for now,”  Indranil Pan ,
an economist at  Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd. (KMB)  in Mumbai, wrote in a
research report yesterday. Risks to the view include worsening
global risk sentiment due to the  Federal Reserve ’s tapering and
the impact of the U.S. debt-ceiling impasse, he wrote.  The rupee advanced 0.2 percent to 62.4650 per dollar in
Mumbai, according to prices from local banks compiled by
Bloomberg. It surged 4.9 percent last month, the biggest gain in
a year and the best performance among the 11 most-traded Asian
currencies. Financial markets in Mumbai will be closed tomorrow
for a public holiday.  India’s current-account deficit will narrow to 3.4 percent
of gross domestic product in the 12 months through March 2014
from a record 4.8 percent the previous year, helping the rupee
stay in a range of 61 to 65 per dollar, according to the Kotak
Mahindra report.  U.S. Debt  U.S. lawmakers now have to debate ways to raise the
nation’s debt limit and avoid a first-ever default after Oct.
17. The Bloomberg U.S. Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback
against 10 leading global currencies, fell 0.2 percent to
1,009.93, adding to a 0.3 percent loss in the past two days.  The rupee’s one-month implied volatility gauge, a measure
of expected moves in the  exchange rate  used to price options,
rose 27 basis points, or 0.27 percentage point, to 15.71
percent.  One-month onshore rupee forwards climbed 0.3 percent to
63.92 per dollar, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Offshore non-deliverable contracts advanced 0.4 percent to 63.09. Forwards
