Aquis Exchange Ltd., a London-based
trading system founded by Alasdair Haynes, plans to hold two
“dress rehearsals” in the coming weeks before starting
operations, according to a notice sent to clients.  The practice sessions will take place on Oct. 19 and Nov.
9, according to the notice dated today and obtained by  Bloomberg
News . The document did not indicate a date for when full trading
would begin.  Haynes, the ex-chief executive officer of alternative
trading venue Chi-X Europe Ltd., founded Aquis last year as a
rival to his former employer and traditional exchanges. The
 Warsaw Stock Exchange  agreed to buy a 30 percent stake in the
company for 5 million pounds ($8.1 million) in August.  The European Union’s Markets in Financial Instruments
Directive in 2007 allowed alternative trading systems to compete
with exchanges such as  Deutsche Boerse AG (DB1)  and NYSE Euronext,
sparking a fight for market share. Many of the new platforms
have since merged, shut down or been bought by rivals.  To contact the reporters on this story:
