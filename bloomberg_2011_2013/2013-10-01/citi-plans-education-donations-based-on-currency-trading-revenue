Citigroup Inc. (C)  will make donations to
six nonprofit groups aimed at improving education in the U.S.
and emerging markets based on a percentage of volume from 
foreign-exchange trading on its electronic platform.  The third-biggest U.S. bank said for the next three months
it will donate $1 for every $1 million it executes for clients
on its Citi Velocity trading platform, according to Bapi Maitra, 
Global Head of Institutional e-Commerce Sales.  The nonprofit groups include Civic Builders, which helps
neighborhoods in the nation with insufficient resources to build
low-cost charter schools in North America, and EMpower, which
supports the health and wellness of youths in emerging markets,
including Argentina, Brazil and China.  Citigroup is the second biggest currency trader after
Deutsche Bank AG, according to  Euromoney Institutional Investor
Plc. (ERM)   To contact the reporter on this story:
