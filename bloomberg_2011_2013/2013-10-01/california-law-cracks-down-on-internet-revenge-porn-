California  Governor  Jerry Brown 
signed a bill that would make it illegal for people to humiliate
ex-lovers by posting indecent photos or videos online.  Under the new law targeting “revenge porn,” distributing
sexual images “with the intent to cause serious emotional
distress” would carry a fine of as much as $1,000 and as long
as six months in jail -- even if the pictures were originally
taken with consent. The law bans only images taken by the person
posting them, meaning that self-photos aren’t protected.  California, a center of Internet technology, becomes the
second U.S. state to criminalize the act, though as a
misdemeanor.  New Jersey  considers it a felony.  To contact the reporter on this story:
