BullionVault , an online service for
investors to buy and sell physical gold and silver, said its
Gold Investor Index fell in September.  The gauge dropped to 53 from 53.8 in August, the London-based company said today in an e-mailed report. A reading above
50 means more buyers than sellers. The index climbed in August
from a 10-month low of 52.6 in July. Customers’ gold holdings
were unchanged last month.  Gold is heading for its first annual drop in 13 years after
some investors lost faith in the metal as a store of value. The
 Federal Reserve  unexpectedly left its bond-purchase program
unchanged last month, saying that restrictive fiscal policies
pose risks for the economy. The U.S. government began today its
first partial shutdown in 17 years after Congress failed to
break a partisan deadlock by a midnight deadline.  “September failed to deliver gold’s typically strong start
to autumn,” Adrian Ash, head of research at BullionVault, said
in the report. “That gave new investors the chance to buy the
dip.”  Gold for immediate delivery traded at $1,333.71 an ounce by
7:29 a.m. in London, for a 20 percent decline this year. Prices
fell 4.7 percent in September after rising the previous two
months.  BullionVault said customers own 32.3 metric tons of gold.
Customers liquidated 1.2 tons in the second quarter and bought
back 40 percent of that in the third quarter, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
