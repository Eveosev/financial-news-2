Gold futures posted the biggest loss
since July, dropping to a seven-week low, on bets that a U.S.
government closure will be short-lived, damping demand for the
metal as a haven. Silver also slumped.  The U.S. government began its first partial shutdown in 17
years, idling as many as 800,000 federal employees, closing
national parks and halting some services after Congress failed
to break a partisan deadlock. Parts of the economy that depend
on the government “would be hamstrung,” President  Barack Obama 
said before the deadline. The MSCI All-Country World Index of
equities climbed as much 0.7 percent.  Gold prices tumbled 23 percent this year, heading for the
first annual loss since 2000, after low U.S. inflation and a
rally in the stock market to a record prompted investors to lose
faith in bullion as a store of value. The slump spurred losses
for billionaire  John Paulson  and forced  Newcrest Mining Ltd. (NCM)  and
other  mining companies  to announce at least $26 billion in
writedowns.  “While the standoff is not a great thing, the effects seem
to be limited, and we are not seeing investors rush to gold for
its safe-haven quality,”  Frank Lesh , a trader at FuturePath
Trading in  Chicago , said in a telephone interview. “Riskier
assets like equities seem to be in favor.”  Gold futures for December delivery fell 3.1 percent to
settle at $1,286.10 on the Comex in New York at 1:38 p.m., the
biggest drop since July 5. Earlier, prices touched $1,282.40,
the lowest since Aug. 8. Trading was 19 percent above the
average in the past 100 days for this time of the day, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. At about 7:15 a.m., 1,200 contracts
changed hands, the biggest trade today.  Paulson’s Stake  Bullion holdings in exchange-traded  products  fell 27
percent this year to the lowest since May 2010, erasing about
$61.8 billion from the value of the assets. Paulson, the biggest
investor in the  SPDR Gold Trust (GLD) , the largest gold ETP, cut his
stake in the product by 53 percent in the second quarter, a
government filing showed.  Billionaires  George Soros  and  Daniel Loeb  sold their entire
SPDR stakes in the fund in the quarter ended June, data showed.  The U.S. faced an impasse over raising the  debt  ceiling in
2011 before Congress approved a plan to head off a default. Gold
reached a record $1,923.70 on Sept. 6, 2011.  “Any shutdown will not last long because the actual event
would put significant pressure on the two sides to find a
compromise,” Georgette Boele, a commodity strategist at ABN
Amro Group NV, said in a note before the midnight deadline
passed.  Goldman Outlook  Gold rebounded 8.4 percent last quarter, snapping three
straight losses, as a slump in late June to a 34-month low
attracted buyers of coins, jewelry and bars. Prices will resume
declines into next year as the  U.S. economy  improves, banks
including Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Citigroup Inc. and Morgan
Stanley say.  The  Federal Reserve  refrained from trimming its $85 billion
in monthly bond purchases last month as policy makers wait for
more signs of economic improvement. The decision on tapering was
only “deferred,” and bullion may average $1,270 in the last
quarter of 2014, Barclays Plc said Sept. 27.  Twenty-four of 41 economists surveyed by Bloomberg on Sept.
18-19 said the Fed will take the first step in slowing debt
purchases in December. Prices surged 70 percent from the end of
December 2008 to June 2011 as the Fed pumped more than $2
trillion into the financial system by buying assets.  India Imports  Purchases by  India , the world’s largest consumer, may fall
5.3 percent this year to 800 metric tons in the 12 months
through March, compared with 845 tons a year earlier, Economic
Affairs Secretary Arvind Mayaram said today. The nation raised
the tax on gold imports for a third time this year in August to
curtail demand and tackle a record current-account deficit.  “While there has been some short-term support for gold the
overall trend remains bearish,” Sterling Smith, a Chicago-based
commodity futures specialist at Citigroup Inc., said in a
telephone interview. “The market does not see the need for any
safe haven, even when the government of the largest economy is
in a state of partial shutdown.”  Investors amassed a record 2,632.5 tons of ETP gold
holdings in December amid concern that stimulus would spur
inflation. U.S. consumer prices grew at a 1.5 percent annual
rate in August, compared with a 10-year average of 2.4 percent,
Labor Department data showed Sept. 17.  Paulson Fund  Paulson’s PFR Gold Fund rose 12 percent in August,
according to a person familiar with the matter who asked not to
be identified because the information is private. The gain pares
the $400 million fund’s loss this year to 55 percent. Futures
climbed 6.3 percent in August amid concern that the U.S. would
launch a military strike against  Syria , and prices fell 4.9
percent last month as tensions eased.  Physical demand from  Asia  remains subdued and prices
probably won’t gain much unless the buying returns, VTB Capital,
a unit of  Russia ’s second-largest lender, wrote in a report last
month. The  U.S. Mint  sold 13,000 ounces of American Eagle gold
 coins  in September. That’s down from this year’s high of 209,500
ounces in April and compares with 68,500 a year earlier, data on
its website show.  Silver futures for December delivery fell 2.5 percent to
$21.175 an ounce. Earlier, the price touched $20.63, the lowest
since Aug. 12. The metal has plunged 30 percent this year.  The precious metals led the decline in the Standard &
Poor’s GSCI Spot Index of 24  raw materials , which touched a
seven-week low.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , platinum futures for
January delivery fell 1.9 percent to $1,385.30 an ounce, the
largest decline since Sept. 20. Earlier, prices dropped to
$1,375, the lowest since July 10.  Palladium futures for December delivery slipped 1.1 percent
to $718.90 an ounce on the Nymex, the biggest loss since Sept.
