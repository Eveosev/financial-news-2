Jungsik, a New York restaurant whose $155 menu includes mysteriously-named dishes like “Scent of Jeju Island” and “ Champs Elysees ,” has become the first stateside Korean spot to receive two Michelin stars, the famed Red Guide announced.  An outpost of a Seoul-based establishment with the same name, Jungsik is the only new two-star addition to Michelin’s list of New York restaurants, which was released today.  There were losers today as well. Michelin stripped  Gordon Ramsay  at The London of its two stars.  “There’s been quite a bit of instability at the restaurant quite frankly,” said Michael Ellis, the director of the guides, in a phone interview. “We’ve had issues with consistency, and consistency is a huge thing for us”  “We don’t really know what’s going on in the kitchen,” he said. “It was a difficult decision. I personally went there; we’ve had some very erratic meals. We thought it was the right thing to do.”  Terrance Brennan’s Picholine, which had two stars a few years ago, now has none. “It was a great table for a long time but it just went into decline,” said Ellis.  The ranks of single-star spots include three new Italian additions: Jonathan Benno’s Lincoln,  Mario Batali ’s Babbo (which lost its star years ago) and  Carbone , an expensive homage to old-school red saucery by the team behind Torrisi.  Tasting Menus  Many of the new one-star venues feature pricey tasting menus.  Aska  serves set Scandinavian meals for $79-$125, Ichimura has a $160-and-up sushi bar, Le Restaurant offers a $100 prix-fixe venue in Tribeca and at Caviar Russe, dinner can cost anywhere from $95-$395.  Among the more affordable one-star selections are The Musket Room, an a la carte New Zealand-theme spot (it also sells tastings for $75-$115) and Telepan, Bill Telepan’s recently-renovated American restaurant on the Upper West Side.  Three stars mean exceptional cuisine, worth a special journey; two are for excellent cooking, worth a detour; one denotes a very good restaurant in its category. No  New York  restaurants were upgraded to three stars, a category occupied by Per Se, Eleven Madison Park, Masa, The Chef’s Table at Brooklyn Fare, Le Bernardin, Jean-Georges and Daniel.  Japan, France  Michelin’s three-star venues include 28 in Japan, 27 in  France , 10 each in the U.S. and  Germany , seven each in the Iberian Peninsula and in  Italy  and five in  Hong Kong  and Macau.  Michelin & Cie (ML) ,  Europe ’s largest tiremaker, produced its first guide in 1900. It was free of charge until 1920 and was intended for chauffeurs. The volume contained practical information, including street maps and tips on repairing tires. The company is based in Clermont-Ferrand, France.  The “Michelin Guide New York 2014” will be available for sale starting on Oct. 2.  (Ryan Sutton reviews restaurants for Muse, the arts and leisure section of  Bloomberg News .
