The U.S. attorney’s office in
Manhattan is seeking a court order authorizing the delay of some
civil cases because “nearly all” of the group’s employees are
unable to work because of the lack of federal funding, said Sara
Shodofsky, head of the office’s civil division.  To contact the reporter on this story:
