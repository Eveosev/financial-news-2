U.K. Prime Minister  David Cameron 
defended his decision to bring forward the Help-to-Buy program
by three months, saying there were “very robust” controls in
place to prevent a  housing bubble .  “The mortgage market today isn’t working,” Cameron said
in a BBC Radio 4 interview in Manchester,  England . “There’s a
market failure going on which the government is helping
correct.”  Cameron this week said he would bring forward the second
phase of the plan, which allows people to buy a home costing as
much as 600,000 pounds ($971,000) with a 5 percent deposit. The
program had already drawn warnings from the  International
Monetary Fund  and U.K. Business Secretary Vince Cable that it
could over-inflate  house prices , prompting the government to
announce the  Bank of England  will review it on an annual basis.  “The controls in place with the Bank of England are very,
very robust,” Cameron said today. The current system only
allows people to buy homes if they have rich parents and that
“is simply not fair,” he said.  The first phase, interest-free loans for buyers of newly
built homes, began in April and has already contributed to the
strongest housing market since the financial crisis. The second
phase, which extends to all homes, was initially due to start in
January. A report by London-based property researcher Hometrack
showed yesterday that U.K. house prices increased the most since
May 2007.  To contact the reporter on this story:
