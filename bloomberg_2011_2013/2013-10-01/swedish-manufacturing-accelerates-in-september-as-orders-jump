Sweden’s manufacturing  expanded at
the fastest pace in more than two years in September as orders
and employment grew.  An index based on responses from about 200 purchasing
managers rose to a seasonally adjusted 56 last month, the
highest since May 2011, from 52.2 the previous month, Stockholm-based  Swedbank AB (SWEDA) , which compiles the data, said today. A
reading above 50 indicates an expansion. It was seen easing to
52.1, according to the  median estimate  of eight economists
surveyed by Bloomberg.  The reading “suggests that the Swedish industrial economy
has stabilized,” Swedbank said in a statement. “The sub-indexes for orders and production made the biggest
contributions” to the rise, it said.  Sweden ’s central bank on Sept. 4 decided to keep its main
lending rate at a two-year low of 1 percent for at least another
year to support the export-reliant economy, which has been
suffering from weak demand from Europe. Sweden’s economy looks
set to recover as demand from abroad picks up, central bank
Governor Stefan Ingves said yesterday in a speech.  The PMI production sub-index rose to 57.6 from 53.9, while
the order index increased to 59.9 from 54.5. The employment
index rose to 51.8 from 48.2.  To contact the reporter on this story:
