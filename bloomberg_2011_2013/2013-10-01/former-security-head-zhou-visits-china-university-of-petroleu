Zhou Yongkang, the former head of
 China ’s security apparatus, visited the China University of
Petroleum today, according to the Beijing-based university’s
website.  Zhou met students and professors of the university where he
had graduated, according to an article on the website. There
were also pictures of a smiling Zhou posted on the site.  Chinese Communist Party leaders agreed to investigate
retired Politburo Standing Committee member Zhou on corruption
allegations, the South China Morning Post reported on Aug. 30,
citing people it didn’t identify. The probe would examine if
Zhou and his family benefited from oil and property deals
facilitated by people including his son, Zhou Bin, according to
the report.  An investigation of Zhou would be the first targeting a
current or former Standing Committee member since the 1966-1976
Cultural Revolution, and would follow the corruption-related
trial of ousted Politburo member Bo Xilai. Bo was sentenced last
month to life in prison.  Three calls to the China University of Petroleum’s press
office went unanswered. Today is a National Day holiday in
China.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
