Drew Brees  threw four touchdown
passes as the New Orleans Saints beat the Miami Dolphins 38-17
in a National Football League matchup of undefeated teams.  The Saints scored four touchdowns in five possessions
spanning the second and third quarters to open a 35-10 lead.
Both teams entered last night’s game at the Superdome in New
Orleans at 3-0 after finishing with losing records last season.  Brees connected on 30-of-39 passes for 413 yards for the
Saints, who joined the Seattle Seahawks, Denver Broncos, Kansas
City Chiefs and New England Patriots with 4-0 records.  “We found our rhythm there mid-second quarter and it just
felt like every time we touched the ball we were going to go
down and get points,” said Brees, who won his ninth straight
“Monday Night Football” start.  Darren Sproles and  Jimmy Graham  scored two touchdowns
apiece for New Orleans, which has opened with four straight wins
for the fourth time in franchise history and for the first time
since their 2009 Super Bowl-winning season.  Brees had at least 25 pass completions for the 10th
straight game and more than 300 passing yards for the ninth game
in a row, tying his own NFL records in both cases, ESPN said.  The Saints’ 34-year-old quarterback also surpassed Hall of
Fame member  John Elway  for the fourth-most career completions in
NFL history. Brees now trails only  Brett Favre ,  Peyton Manning 
and  Dan Marino .  After Sproles gave the Saints an early 7-0 lead with a
five-yard touchdown run, Brees threw scoring passes of 27 yards
to Graham and 13 yards to Sproles during the second quarter to
give the Saints a 21-10 halftime lead.  Brees then threw a pair of touchdowns less than two minutes
apart in the third quarter -- a four-yarder to Benjamin Watson
and a 43-yarder to Graham --that pushed New Orleans’s lead to
35-10.  To contact the reporter on this story:
