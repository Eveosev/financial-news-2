Billionaire investor  George Soros 
repeated his support for euro bonds to fight  Europe ’s sovereign
crisis, saying joint debt liability would lower the cost of
borrowing for individual euro member states.  Common euro-area bonds alone can’t solve the crisis, now in
its fourth year he said at the Global Economic Symposium in
Kiel, North Germany.  “We need both, euro bonds and structural reform in
individual countries,” said Soros.  German Chancellor  Angela Merkel , whose Christian Democratic
bloc last month recorded its best election result in 23 years,
repeatedly rejected the notion of debt mutualization in the euro
area, arguing that these would create the wrong incentives for
debt-laden states and damp their appetite for economic-policy
changes.  “Euro bonds are a powerful taboo,” said Soros. A
guarantee to borrow at a fixed euro-bond rate would reduce the
need to transfer aid to debt-laden southern European states
because the guarantee would never be called, he said.  “The danger of default would disappear,” he said.
“That’s the free lunch you don’t have” at the moment. Transfer
payments create “a disequilibrium” that is “unacceptable in
the long term,” he said.  Soros, who has been one of the most outspoken critics of
 Germany ’s austerity policies for the euro area, made $1 billion
betting against the British pound in 1992.  To contact the reporter on this story:
