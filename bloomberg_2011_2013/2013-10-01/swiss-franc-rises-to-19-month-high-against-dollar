The Swiss franc rose to the highest
level against the dollar in 19 months as a partial shutdown of
the U.S. government boosted demand for Switzerland’s currency as
a haven.  The franc, which investor seek at times of heightened
global stress, climbed against all but two of its 16 major
peers. Against the greenback it strengthened through 90 cents
per dollar for the first time since Feb. 29, 2012.  “That really is the safe haven, reserve currency move,”
Michael Plavnik, head of the STIRT desk at Citigroup Inc. in
 London , said in an interview on Bloomberg Television’s “On the
Move” with Manus Cranny. “We’ve also actually have seen the
Swiss economy do quite well relatively so there’s maybe some
pressure on the SNB. They’ve gotten pretty much a free ride on
the 1.20 peg so we may begin to actually test it. I don’t think
we’ll get there but we might make it uncomfortable for the
SNB.”  The Swiss currency rose 0.3 percent to 90.23 centimes per
dollar at 10:50 a.m. in Zurich, after rising to as much as 89.93
centimes. Against the euro it was little changed at 1.2225.  The Swiss National Bank set a cap of 1.20 per euro on the
franc in September 2011, after it nearly touched parity with the
euro amid the 17-member bloc’s debt crisis. The Zurich-based
central bank cited the risk of deflation and a recession as its
justification for the step.  This is the first U.S. shutdown in 17 years as House and
Senate lawmakers failed to agree on a spending plan for the new
fiscal year that started today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
