Crude oil volatility declined as
futures fell on the first day of a partial government shutdown
that threatened the economic recovery and fuel demand.  Implied volatility for at-the-money November options, a
measure of expected futures swings and a key gauge of value,
fell to 21.02 percent on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  from
21.51 percent yesterday.  Puts accounted for 53 percent of electronic trading volume
today. Four of the five most active options in electronic
trading were November puts for $100, $95, $92 and $98.  “If we don’t get a bullish story on the oil market pretty
soon, the market is getting convinced if we take out $100 it can
open the flood gates to the downside,” said  Phil Flynn , senior
market analyst at Price Futures Group in  Chicago .  West Texas Intermediate crude for November delivery fell 29
cents to settle at $102.04 a barrel on the Nymex, the lowest
settlement since July 3. Prices have dropped $8.49, or 7.7
percent, since Sept. 6 when they reached $110.53, the highest
since May 2011.  The current fiscal year expired at midnight and Congress
hasn’t passed a spending bill for fiscal 2014.  November $100 puts rose 2 cents to $1.04 a barrel with
2,496 lots trading as of 4:03 p.m. November $110 calls fell 3
cents to 8 cents on volume of 2,471.  In the previous session, calls accounted for 57 percent of
the 84,343 lots traded.  November $110 calls were the most-active options yesterday,
with 4,916 contracts changing hands as they lost 3 cents to 11
cents a barrel. June $85 puts, the next-most active, increased 4
cents to $2.46 on volume of 3,110 lots.  Open interest was highest for December $90 puts, with
41,890 contracts. Next were December $80 puts with 41,300 lots
and December $100 calls with 32,658.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on open-outcry volume, where the bulk of options activity occurs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
