South Africa ’s purchasing managers’
 index  unexpectedly dropped below 50 in September for the first
time in six months, indicating a contraction in manufacturing,
as strikes hit output, Kagiso Tiso Holdings said.  The seasonally adjusted index fell to an eight-month low of
49.1 from 56.5 in August, Johannesburg-based  Kagiso  said in an
e-mailed statement today. The median estimate of seven
economists surveyed by Bloomberg was 54.  Manufacturers including  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) ,  Volkswagen AG (VOW) 
and General Motors Co., face a loss in revenue of about 20
billion rand ($2 billion) after 30,000 workers held a 15-day
strike in August to demand higher wages. Labor stoppages have
also disrupted output in the gold mining and construction
industries in the past two months.  Threats of future  strike action  may be “weighing on
manufacturers,” Abdul Davids, head of research at Kagiso Asset
Management, said in the statement.  Members of the Association of Mineworkers and Construction
Union halted work on Sept. 27 at Anglo American Platinum Ltd.
mines to protest planned jobs. Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan
said on Sept. 27 that prolonged strikes are damaging to the
economy and job creation.  The index measuring business activity dropped 12.5 points
to 46.7, Kagiso said. The new sales orders index lost 9.4 points
to 48.1 and the index measuring expected business conditions in
six months’ time fell 4 points to 51.8.  The Bureau for Economic Research, based at the University
of Stellenbosch near  Cape Town , conducts the PMI survey on
behalf of Kagiso.  To contact the reporter on this story:
