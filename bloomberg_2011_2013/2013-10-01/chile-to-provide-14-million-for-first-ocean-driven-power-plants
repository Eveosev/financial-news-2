Chile plans to solicit bids from
developers this year for as much as $14 million in grants to
build the nation’s first two projects that will produce
electricity from the movement of tides and waves.  The winners will be required to match the investment in the
pilot projects, according to Christoph Tagwerker, an engineer in
the climate change and sustainability division of the  Inter-American Development Bank , which will provide an additional $2.4
million in grants for the facilities.  Chile has the potential to host 200 gigawatts of marine-power plants along its lengthy coastline, he said in a telephone
interview today. That’s more than 10 times the size of the
country’s grid.  “If the country can use just a small portion of this
potential it could strongly influence the country’s power
matrix,” he said.  The country is planning a tidal-power plant that will have
at least 800 kilowatts of capacity and cost as much as $20
million, and a wave-energy project will be smaller and may cost
about half that amount, he said.  Chile’s Ministry of Mines and Energy didn’t immediately
reply to a phone call and e-mail seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
