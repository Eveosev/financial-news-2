The House Committee on Oversight and
Government Reform’s lawsuit seeking documents on Operation Fast
and Furious can proceed after a federal judge denied the Justice
Department’s request to dismiss the case.  “The fact that this case arises out of a dispute between
two branches of government does not make it non-justiciable,”
U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson in  Washington  said
yesterday. “Supreme Court precedent establishes that the third
branch has an equally fundamental role to play, and that judges
not only may, but sometimes must, exercise their responsibility
to interpret the Constitution and determine whether another
branch has exceeded its power.”  The Republican-controlled House committee sued to enforce a
subpoena in the panel’s inquiry into so-called gun walking. That
practice allowed illegal gun purchases in the U.S. in an effort
to link the weapons to Mexican gangs.  The committee is seeking documents describing internal
Justice Department discussions about a February 2011 letter to
lawmakers that U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder later said
mistakenly contained incorrect information.  Representatives of the Justice Department didn’t
immediately respond to a phone call seeking comment on the
ruling.  The case is Committee on Oversight and Government Reform v.
Holder, 1:12-cv-01332, U.S. District Court, District of Columbia
(Washington).  To contact the reporters on this story:
