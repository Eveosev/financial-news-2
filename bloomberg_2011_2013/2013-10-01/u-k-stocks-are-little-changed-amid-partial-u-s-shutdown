U.K. stocks  declined for a third day
as consumer-goods companies tumbled after Unilever reported a
slowdown in quarterly sales, and as investors assessed a partial
shutdown of the U.S. government.  Unilever slid 3.8 percent, contributing the most to the
benchmark FTSE 100 Index’s decline.  SABMiller Plc (SAB)  dropped 2.9
percent after a South African union said as many as 3,000 of the
company’s workers may join a strike for higher wages. Rolls-Royce Holdings Plc added 2 percent as Bank of America Corp. said
the aircraft-engine maker’s share price is attractive.  The FTSE 100 slipped 22.07 points, or 0.3 percent, to
6,440.15 at 1:49 p.m. in London. The gauge gained 4 percent in
the third quarter as the  Bank of England  gave forward guidance
on  interest rates  for the first time and as the  Federal Reserve 
held off cuts to its monthly bond purchases. The broader FTSE
All-Share Index fell 0.3 percent today, while Ireland’s ISEQ
Index rose 0.5 percent.  “Investors are disappointed with the weak sales growth
numbers from Unilever and the problems from SABMiller,” said
Jacques Porta, who helps oversee $780 million as a  fund manager 
at Ofi Gestion Privee in Paris. “What’s bad for Unilever is bad
for the market, so there is concern that other consumer staples
stocks may also be affected.”  The number of shares changing hands today in FTSE 100-listed stocks was 15 percent lower than the average of the past
30 days, data compiled by Bloomberg showed.  800,000 Employees  The U.S. government began its first partial shutdown in 17
years after Democrats and Republicans failed to agree upon
emergency funding measures before a midnight deadline. The
shutdown places as many as 800,000 federal employees on
temporary unpaid leave, and closes national parks, museums and
Internal Revenue Service call centers.  The halt began as Congressional leaders continued a
standoff over a call to delay President  Barack Obama ’s
healthcare law by a year. A partial shutdown would cost the U.S.
at least $300 million a day in lost economic output at the
start, according to IHS Inc.  Lawmakers have not scheduled further negotiations, raising
concern the dispute may affect talks to increase the debt limit
by Oct. 17 to avoid a default.  In the U.K., manufacturing in September expanded less than
forecast. The  purchasing managers’ index  declined to 56.7 from a
revised 57.1 in August, London-based Markit Economics said. The
median forecast of economists in a Bloomberg survey had called
for a gain to 57.5.  Unilever Drops  Unilever slipped 3.8 percent to 2,348 pence, shaving 4.3
points from the  FTSE 100. (UKX)  Underlying revenue for the third
quarter rose 3 percent to 3.5 percent, Unilever said late
yesterday. The world’s second-biggest consumer-goods maker
reported 5 percent growth in the first half and second quarter.  A gauge of food and beverage stocks posted the  second-worst 
performance of the 19 industry groups in the Stoxx Europe 600
Index.  Diageo Plc (DGE)  dropped 1.5 percent to 1,936.5 pence and
 Reckitt Benckiser Group Plc (RB/)  retreated 2 percent to 4,431 pence.  SABMiller lost 2.9 percent to 3,052.5 pence as a South
African workers’ union vowed to continue  strike action 
indefinitely until wages are increased by 9 percent, instead of
the 7 percent offered by the world’s second-biggest brewer. The
Food and Allied Workers Union said as many as 3,000 employees at
SABMiller’s plants in Cape Town, East London and Durban will
walk out of work today.  Randgold Resources Ltd. (RRS)  declined 4.1 percent to 4,270 pence
as precious metals tumbled.  Fresnillo Plc (FRES) , which produces gold
and silver in Mexico, retreated 4.9 percent to 925 pence.  Rolls-Royce  Rolls-Royce (RR/)  advanced 2 percent to 1,134 pence as Bank of
America’s Merrill Lynch unit recommended that investors buy the
stock, saying it has lagged peers after posting first-half
results on July 25. Rolls-Royce  has dropped  10 percent since
then through yesterday’s close, compared with a 5.9 percent gain
for the Stoxx Europe 600 Industrial Goods & Services Index.  “The management team is focused on improving margins and
cash generation to world class standards as they benefit from
significant volume growth, especially in civil aerospace,”
analysts led by Celine Fornaro wrote in a note. “This should
lead to further re-rating in the share price.”  Experian Plc (EXPN)  added 1.4 percent to 1,193 pence after
agreeing to buy U.S. fraud-detection services provider 41st
Parameter Inc. for $324 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
