HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA)  sold $27.5 million
of one-year notes tied to LinkedIn Corp., the largest such
offering linked to the professional networking business that’s
more than doubled its share price this year.  The securities, issued Sept. 26, yield 11 percent a year
plus an additional 3.77 percent if the stock is above 111
percent of its initial value, according to a prospectus filed
with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The notes also
protect against 5 percent of losses with 95 percent of capital
at risk. Bank of America Corp. distributed the offering for a
1.75 percent fee.  LinkedIn, owner of the world’s most popular professional-networking website, rose 121 percent this year to $254.01 when
the notes were sold. That’s more than five times the price of
its initial public offering of $45 in May 2011.  The company gets most of its revenue from its talent-solutions product, aimed at helping recruiters fill jobs, said
Blake Harper, an analyst at Wunderlich Securities Inc. in
Baltimore. “We’ve seen a pretty strong willingness from
recruiter customers to absorb price increases.”  Wunderlich Securities  raised  its 12-month target price for
 LinkedIn (LNKD)  to $280 on Sept. 26 from $250.  HSBC estimated the securities’ initial value at 97.3 cents
on the dollar, according to the prospectus.  Banks previously sold $8.95 million of notes tied to
LinkedIn in nine offerings since April 19, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Juanita Gutierrez, a spokeswoman for HSBC in New York,
declined to comment.  Banks create structured notes by packaging debt with
derivatives to offer customized bets to retail investors while
earning fees and raising money. Derivatives are contracts whose
value is derived from stocks, bonds, commodities and currencies,
or events such as changes in  interest rates  or the weather.  To contact the reporter on this story:
