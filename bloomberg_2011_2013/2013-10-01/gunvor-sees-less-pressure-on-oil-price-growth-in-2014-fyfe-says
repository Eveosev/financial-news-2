Gunvor Group Ltd. sees pressure for a
higher crude price easing next year as more production from
outside the Organization of Petroleum Producing Countries
compensates for growing world demand.  “You’re not looking at a market in which the fundamentals
are tightening appreciably,”  David Fyfe , the head of market
research and analysis at Gunvor, said in an interview at the Oil
& Money conference in London today. “You may get a little less
impetus for higher prices.”  West Texas Intermediate crude rose to a two-year high of
$112.24 on Aug. 28 amid concern that a U.S.-led assault on  Syria 
would widen the conflict and disrupt Middle East supplies. Syria
borders Iraq, the second biggest OPEC producer. Next year, oil
demand will grow by about 1 million barrels a day, according to
Fyfe.  Continuing instability in the region, including in Syria
and  Libya , may prevent prices from “any dramatic falloff,”
Fyfe said.  Brent crude  will probably trade at a premium of $6 to
$8 a barrel to WTI over the long term, he said.  “When geopolitical concerns ebb and flow, you would
normally expect Brent to reflect that,” Fyfe said.  Brent for November settlement slipped $1.18, or 1.1
percent, to $107.19 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures
Europe exchange. The European benchmark was at a premium of
$5.85 to WTI.  To contact the reporters on this story:
