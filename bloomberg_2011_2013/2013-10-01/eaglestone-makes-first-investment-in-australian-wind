Eaglestone NV , an investor in
renewable energy, struck its first private-equity deal by
backing a portfolio of Australian wind-power projects alongside
Denham Capital Management LP.  The planned wind farms include the 100-megawatt Glen Innes
project in New South Wales, the 250-megawatt Lincoln Gap venture
and the 240-megawatt Cattle Hill site in Tasmania, Eaglestone
said today in an e-mailed statement. All are due to have their
financing in place this year and next.  It’s the first investment by Eaglestone’s Infraventus
Holdings venture with Infraventus Capital Partners, for which
Eaglestone plans to raise 100 million euros ($135 million). The
company declined to say how much it has invested in the
Australian projects, or what share of the portfolio it bought.  “The investment will give our investors an excellent
portfolio of projects that are close to reaching financial
completion,” Eaglestone Chief Executive Officer Pedro Neto said
in the statement. “ Australia  already produces over 10 percent
of its energy from renewable sources, but it has a way to go
before it reaches its 2020 target of producing 20 percent.”  The package of projects, called the OneWind Australia
portfolio, has the potential to expand to 1,000 megawatts of
capacity, according to the statement. Denham Capital said in  May 
it was putting $75 million of equity into OneWind Australia.  Eaglestone, founded in December 2011, is based in Amsterdam
and has offices in London, Lisbon and  Cape Town , as well Luanda
and Maputo, the capitals of Angola and  Mozambique .  To contact the reporter on this story:
