  PT Garuda Indonesia (GIAA)  will lease as
many as 35 ATR 72-600 turboprop aircraft from Nordic Aviation
Capital to modernize its regional fleet amid rising travel
demand in Southeast Asia’s largest economy.  Garuda has signed a firm commitment for 25 of the planes,
with options for 10 more, ATR said in a statement today. The
deal is worth more than $840 million, and deliveries of the
aircraft will start next month.  ATR, as the Avions de Transport Regional joint venture of
 European Aeronautic, Defence & Space Co. (EAD)  and  Finmeccanica SpA (FNC)  is
known, has booked 83 aircraft sales this year including the
turboprops for Garuda it previously listed as being purchased by
an undisclosed customer. The Toulouse, France-based aircraft
maker is outselling rival  Bombardier Inc. (BBD/B)   The turboprop planes will help Garuda increase its services
to remote areas of  Indonesia  as the ATRs can land on airports
with shorter runways, the carrier said in a separate statement.  The aircraft, which can seat up to 74 passengers, will
accommodate 70 in Garuda’s configuration, said ATR, which has
also sold its planes to Indonesia’s PT Lion Mentari Airlines.  About a 100 ATR aircraft will be operating in Indonesia in
the next two years as the planemaker has won more than 85 orders
from the country since 2008, it said in the statement.  State-controlled Garuda and rival Lion Air are ordering
more planes as economic growth enables more of Indonesia’s 253
million people to travel by air. Domestic carriers flew 70
million passengers in 2012, up from 37 million in 2008,
according to CAPA Centre for Aviation.  NAC, based in Billund,  Denmark , in June placed an order for
90 of the European turboprops, including the smaller ATR 42-600
model. With the addition of the new aircraft, the company will
manage a fleet of about 150 ATRs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
