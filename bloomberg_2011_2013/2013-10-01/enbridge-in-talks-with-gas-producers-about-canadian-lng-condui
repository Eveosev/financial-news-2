Enbridge Inc. (ENB) , Canada’s largest oil
transporter, is talking with natural gas producers in British
Columbia about building a pipeline to carry supplies to the
coast where they will be exported to Asia.  “We’re pretty bullish on the whole area of natural gas,”
Chief Executive Officer Al Monaco said in a briefing with
journalists today from Toronto. “What you find is a big
disconnect between North American pricing and global pricing.”  Royal Dutch Shell Plc, Chevron Corp., BG Group Plc and
Cnooc Ltd. are among international energy companies proposing or
considering liquefied natural gas export projects in Western
Canada, including pipelines across British Columbia’s mountains
to link gas supplies in shale formations to Pacific Coast
facilities.  Exxon Mobil Corp., the world’s largest energy company by
market value, asked  Canada  in June for permission to export 30
million metric tons of LNG a year from the nation’s westernmost
province of British Columbia.  Monaco didn’t provide details on the talks or the names of
producers.  Japan  paid an average price of $15.74 per million British
thermal units for LNG in July, according to data from LNG Japan
Corp. That compares with an average of about $3.64 for U.S.
natural gas futures traded in New York.  Calgary-based Enbridge has C$36 billion ($35 billion) worth
of projects through 2017, Monaco said today at an investor
meeting in Toronto. The company sees natural gas and power
projects making up a larger share of Enbridge’s business, he
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
