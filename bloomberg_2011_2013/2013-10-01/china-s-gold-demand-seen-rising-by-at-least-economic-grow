Consumer gold demand in China, last
year’s second-biggest user after  India , may increase by at least
the same pace as the country’s economic growth, according to the
World Gold Council.  Economic expansion may slow to 7.4 percent next year and
7.2 percent in 2015, from 7.6 percent this year, according to
economist estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Chinese gold demand
growth may at least match those increases and could rise further
as a rising population has more disposable income,  Albert Cheng ,
Far East managing director at the council, said in an interview
at a London Bullion Market Association conference in  Rome .  China’s consumption may reach 1,000 metric tons this year
as it vies to match India’s demand, the council said in August.
Gold rose 13 percent from a 34-month low in June as lower prices
boosted jewelry, coin and bar buying in  Asia . Economic growth in
Asia that’s bigger than in western nations and rising
populations aided demand that led Australia & New Zealand
Banking Group Ltd., Deutsche Bank AG and UBS AG to open vaults
in the region this year.  “The number of cities and rising population are sources of
future gold jewelry consumption in  China ,” Cheng said.
“There’s a rising middle class. There are not many alternative
investments. Gold is a good alternative to consider for
protecting wealth.”  Gold’s Drop  Gold for immediate delivery traded at $1,331.41 an ounce by
11:54 a.m. in London. It’s set for a 21 percent drop in 2013
after climbing the past 12 years. Prices rebounded from
$1,180.50 in June. They reached a record $1,921.15 in September
2011.  Global sales of bullion bars and coins surged 78 percent to
an all-time high in the second quarter as demand more than
doubled in India and China amid lower prices, according to the
producer-funded council. China’s population will reach 1.43
billion in 2020, 5.4 percent more than in 2010, according to
United Nations estimates.  “The Chinese consumer was on the sideline, waiting for
gold to pull back,” Cheng said. “Gold has an intrinsic value.
They thought it’s a good time to get in.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
