Ford Motor Co. (F)  and Chrysler Group LLC
overcame a quirk in the industry sales calendar to post surprise
U.S. gains for September while others, including  General Motors
Co. (GM) , slumped more than predicted.  Analysts had forecast a 2.8 percent drop in sales for Fiat
SpA-controlled Chrysler, which would’ve been the company’s first
drop in 42 months. That didn’t happen, as Chrysler deliveries
climbed 0.7 percent to 143,017.  Ford said sales of its cars and light trucks rose 5.7
percent to 184,452. Analysts surveyed by  Bloomberg News  had
estimated little change. In total, analysts predicted industry
sales slipped 3.8 percent in September, the first drop in 27
months. Deliveries for the first two days of September,
including the Labor Day holiday, don’t contribute toward
automakers’ tallies because they were counted in August figures.  “That speaks to underlying strength and confidence in the
consumer which is continuing to improve,” said Warren Gibbon, a
Boston-based vice president for Standard Life Investments, which
has $271 billion under management and holds GM shares.  Now the industry is watching warily the U.S. government
shutdown, concerned that it could affect  consumer confidence  --
and this month’s sales.  Deliveries of cars and light trucks last month probably
slid to 1.14 million, the average of 10 estimates in the
Bloomberg survey. The annualized industry  sales rate , adjusted
for seasonal trends, may climb to 15.4 million, the average of
16 estimates, from 14.8 million a year earlier. While the pace
is slower than August’s 16.1 million, carmakers this year are
still on track for the most U.S. deliveries since 2007.  GM’s Decline  GM sales tumbled 11 percent,  Toyota (7203) ’s dropped 4.3 percent
and  Nissan Motor Co. (7201) ’s slid 5.5 percent. All three declined more
than analysts had estimated.  GM deliveries to retail customers declined 6 percent and
sales to fleet buyers plunged 27 percent as the Impala large
sedan is repositioned away from rental fleets. Sales of mass-market Chevrolets fell 15 percent, while Cadillac luxury brand
deliveries rose 9.9 percent.  Chrysler, which filed for an initial public offering last
month, today forecast a 15.7 million industry sales pace for
September, including medium- and heavy-duty vehicles, which
typically account for at least 200,000 deliveries per year. The
Auburn Hills, Michigan-based carmaker that extended its run of
monthly sales gains to 3 1/2 years. GM estimated a September
sales rate of 15.3 million light vehicles.  ‘Incredible Streak’  “Chrysler’s had this incredible streak of sustained year-over-year growth, getting through several months like this,”
Alec Gutierrez, an analyst for auto-pricing website Kelley Blue
Book, said in a telephone interview. “If they’re able to do so
again this month, it says a heck of a lot.”  Sales of Chrysler’s Dodge Dart compact surged 51 percent to
7,922. Deliveries of the Ram pickup climbed 8.4 percent to
28,145 while the Jeep Grand Cherokee sport-utility vehicle
increased 19 percent to 14,906.  Ford sales of its Fusion family car surged 62 percent to
19,972 and deliveries of F-Series pickups rose 9.8 percent to
60,456, the Dearborn, Michigan-based carmaker said in a
statement.  If the government shutdown lasts three or four weeks,
economists estimate it could reduce gross domestic product by as
much 1.4 percentage points and drag on confidence. Deliveries of
new cars and light trucks may rise to 16.1 million next year,
the average estimate of 13 analysts in a survey by Bloomberg
last month.  ‘Fragile’ Economy  “We are optimistic that our government leaders will come
together in support of a solution that funds the U.S. government
and avoids significant disruptions to our still-fragile  U.S.
economy ,”  Erich Merkle , Ford’s U.S. sales analyst, said in an
e-mail.  GM sales were predicted to decline 4.2 percent, the average
of nine estimates. The Detroit-based automaker was raised to
investment grade for the first time in eight years by Moody’s
Investors Service on Sept. 23. The company purchased 120 million
preferred shares held by the United Auto Workers retiree medical
trust for about $3.2 billion. The  U.S. Treasury  also began
selling down the rest of its 101.3 million  shares .  The average estimate of seven analysts was for September
declines of 2.5 percent by Toyota City, Japan-based Toyota, 0.6
percent by Tokyo-based Honda Motor Co. and 4.8 percent by
Yokohama, Japan-based Nissan.  Hyundai Motor Co. (005380)  and affiliate  Kia Motors Corp. (000270) ’s combined
deliveries probably plunged 14 percent, the average of seven
estimates. The Seoul-based carmakers have trailed industrywide
sales growth in every month since September 2012.  Volkswagen AG (VOW) ’s combined September sales for its VW and
Audi brands slipped 7.5 percent, better than the 12 percent
decline that was the average of four estimates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
