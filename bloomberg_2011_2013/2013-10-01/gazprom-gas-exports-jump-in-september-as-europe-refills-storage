OAO Gazprom (GAZP) , the supplier of a
quarter of  Europe ’s natural gas, boosted exports by 25 percent
in September from a year earlier as European utilities rushed to
refill depleted storage before the winter heating season.  Gazprom exported 13.2 billion cubic meters of natural gas
to Europe and  Turkey  last month, the most for September since at
least 2010 and compared with 10.6 billion cubic meters a year
earlier, according to preliminary data released by the export
unit of the Moscow-based gas producer by e-mail today. Supplies
jumped 16 percent in the first nine months of the year to 118.4
billion cubic meters, Gazprom Export said.  Russian gas exports have rebounded after a slump in 2012 as
a colder-than-usual start to this year depleted inventory
levels. Stores were 78 percent full as of yesterday, the last
day of the six-month summer period, compared with 88 percent a
year earlier, according to data from Gas Infrastructure Europe,
a lobby group in Brussels. Availability of gas in storage fell
to a record-low 21 percent full on April 13.  Flows from Norway , Europe’s second-biggest supplier,
averaged 7.2 billion cubic meters last month, compared with 6.4
billion cubic meters a year earlier, data from Gassco AS,
 Norway ’s gas pipeline network operator, show.  October may be warmer than usual in Europe, according to
four out of five weather forecasters surveyed by Bloomberg,
which may damp demand for gas and power this month.  Gazprom plans to increase exports by 10 percent this year
to at least 152 billion cubic meters, Deputy Chief Executive
Officer  Alexander Medvedev  said on June 4.  To contact the reporter on this story:
