A prolonged U.S. government shutdown
would mean some home loans won’t be completed because lenders
won’t be able to verify borrowers’ income and other data with
the  Internal Revenue Service  and the  Social Security
Administration , according to mortgage industry participants.  Fannie Mae (FNMA)  and  Freddie Mac (FMCC)  require proof of borrowers’
income for the mortgages they buy and package into securities
and direct verification from the IRS is considered the safest
way to do it, Pete Mills, senior vice president of the Mortgage
Bankers Association, said today.  “If we go beyond a week, it’ll start to get dicey,
particularly for small lenders,” Mills said in a telephone
interview. Alternative methods, such as calling a borrowers’
employer, would leave banks open to the risk that they will have
to repurchase loans from the companies, he said.  Mortgage Network Inc. planned for the shutdown and ordered
government documents for closings currently in its pipeline,
said Brian Koss, executive vice president of the Danvers,
Massachusetts-based retail lender. Delays could begin to happen
as soon as next week, he said.  “It stops our ability to have the best execution,” Koss
said in a telephone interview. “It’s a place we don’t like to
be.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
