Indian (SENSEX)  stocks advanced as the
current-account gap widened by less than economists forecast,
countering concern that a U.S. government shutdown will reduce
capital inflows.  ICICI Bank Ltd. (ICICIBC)  and  HDFC Bank Ltd. (HDFCB) , the nation’s largest
non-state lenders, increased more than 3 percent.  Bharat Heavy
Electricals Ltd. (BHEL)  climbed the most in a week. Property developer
DLF Ltd. surged 6.9 percent, halting a seven-day slide.  Maruti
Suzuki India Ltd. (MSIL)  rose the most in two weeks after sales gained
12 percent last month. The rupee gained 0.3 percent, ending a
two-day loss. The market is closed tomorrow for a holiday.  The S&P BSE Sensex climbed 0.7 percent to 19,517.15 at the
close. The shortfall in the broadest measure of trade was $21.8
billion last quarter, less than the $23 billion median estimate
in a Bloomberg survey. The U.S. began its first shutdown in 17
years amid a deadlock in the Congress over government spending
plans and President  Barack Obama ’s health-care law.  “The deficit number is providing some comfort as it was
the biggest overhang on the rupee,”  Gajendra Nagpal , chief
executive officer at Unicon Financial Intermediaries Ltd. in New
Delhi, said by telephone. “The U.S. shutdown can disrupt flows
to  emerging markets , including India. Markets will remain
volatile until the crisis is resolved.”  The fiscal and current-account shortfalls have driven the
rupee down 12 percent in 2013 and last month prompted Standard &
Poor’s to say there is more than a one-in-three chance India
will lose its investment-grade rating within two years.  Net Buyers  Foreign funds bought a net $2.1 billion of local equities
in September, the first monthly net inflow since May, after the
central bank Governor Raghuram Rajan outlined plans to bolster
the rupee when he took charge Sept. 4 and the Federal Reserve
decided to maintain economic stimulus. The currency has jumped
10 percent from a record low of 68.845 per dollar on Aug. 28.  ICICI Bank and HDFC Bank increased 3.1 percent to 910.75
rupees and 611.65 rupees. State Bank of India rose 1.8 percent
to 1,643.35 rupees. The S&P BSE Bankex Index of 13 lenders rose
2.7 percent, ending a two-day, 4.6 percent decline.  Bharat Heavy surged 2.7 percent to 141.2 rupees.  Larsen &
Toubro Ltd. (LT) , the largest engineering company, added 1.4 percent
to 800 rupees. DLF rallied 6.9 percent to 136.90 rupees, paring
this year’s loss to 41 percent. Maruti Suzuki rose 1.6 percent
to 1,380.20 rupees.  The Sensex has risen 0.5 percent this year and trades at
13.5 times estimated 12-month profits, compared with the five-year average of 14.1 times. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index is
trading at 10.4 times.  Global funds sold a net $84 million of domestic shares on
Sept. 30, according to data released from the regulator today.
They have purchased a net $13.4 billion of Indian equities this
year, the second-highest among 10 Asian markets tracked by
Bloomberg, after Japan.  The CNX  Nifty (NIFTY)  on the National Stock Exchange increased 0.8
percent to 5,780.05. India VIX, which gauges the cost of
protection against losses in the Nifty, fell 3.3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
