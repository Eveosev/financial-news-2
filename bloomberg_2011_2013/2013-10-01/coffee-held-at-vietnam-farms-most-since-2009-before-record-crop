Coffee farmers in  Vietnam , the
biggest producer of robusta used in instant drinks, have the
largest stockpiles of unsold beans in four years as they prepare
for a record harvest, according to a survey. Prices advanced.  Growers hold 120,000 metric tons from the previous crop, 45
percent more than 83,000 tons a year earlier, according to the
median of eight trader and shipper estimates compiled by
Bloomberg. They are keeping the beans to await a price rally and
as exporters slow purchases because of tax-refund delays.
Farmers will reap 1.7 million tons in the coming season, 13
percent more than a year earlier, the survey showed.  Futures traded in London slumped 12 percent in the past two
months and touched a three-year low last week on expectations
global supplies of beans used by  Nestle SA (NESN)  will outpace demand.
Growers in  India  are also holding back sales, said Volcafe Ltd.
on Sept. 20. Most of the crop in Indonesia, the largest robusta
producer after Vietnam and  Brazil , has already been harvested,
according to Amsterdam-based trader Nedcoffee BV.  “I still have some coffee left from the old crop but I
don’t want to sell,” said Nguyen Van Tap, a farmer who owns
about 2.5 acres (1 hectare) in  Dak Lak  province, which supplies
30 percent of the country’s harvest. “Prices aren’t good and I
don’t need the money right now.”  Bean prices in Dak Lak rallied 1.7 percent to 35,900 dong
($1.70) a kilogram (2.2 pounds) from 35,300 dong yesterday, the
lowest level since December 2010,  data  from the Trade & Tourism
Center show. Futures rose 0.1 percent to $1,644 a ton on NYSE
Liffe at 3:34 p.m.  London  time, extending yesterday’s 1.9
percent jump. The price dropped to $1,596 on Sept. 27.  Refund Delays  Exporters can normally claim a refund of the 5 percent
value-added tax on coffee trade. Rebates are being delayed
because authorities are checking documentation along the supply
chain after reports some local traders are avoiding the tax,
newspaper Nong Nghiep reported Sept. 25, citing Nguyen Nam Hai,
general director of state-owned Vietnam National Coffee Corp.  The holdup is “really causing us a headache,” said Le
Tien Hung, Dak Lak-based deputy director of Sept. 2nd Import-Export Co. “Exporters don’t dare to buy coffee from the market
because they’re afraid they may not get their tax money back if
someone in the supply chain didn’t pay.”  The Ministry of Finance will discuss the issue with
companies and the Vietnam Coffee and Cocoa Association this
week, Do Hoang Anh Tuan, deputy minister, said in an interview
Sept. 27. The ministry will consider allowing about 130 “good”
companies, which represent 90 percent of exports, to get VAT
refunds before authorities check their documentation, he said.  Shipments Drop  “If the government listens to our proposal, the government
will be able to resolve the issue,” said Nguyen Xuan Thai, a
board member of Vicofa, which asked for the tax to be scrapped
because most production is for export. Shipments from Vietnam
dropped 23 percent to 1.04 million tons in the first nine
months, the General Statistics Office said Sept. 25.  Global robusta harvests will expand 3.8 percent to 65.3
million bags (3.92 million tons) in 2013-2014, exceeding a 1.6
percent gain in demand to 63.8 million bags,  Macquarie Group
Ltd. (MQG)  said in August. A bag weighs 60 kilos (132 pounds).  Farmers in  Indonesia ’s southern Sumatra, the main growing
region, harvested 92 percent of the crop, Nedcoffee BV said
Sept. 17. Bean deliveries from farms slowed to 7,000 tons last
week, 5,000 tons less than in the previous seven-day period,
according to Volcafe, the coffee unit of commodities trader ED&F
Man Holdings Ltd.  Shipments from southern Sumatra jumped 72 percent to
55,470.50 tons in September from a month earlier, when Indonesia
had a week-long holiday, the Lampung trade and industry office
said in a statement today. That compares with 55,709 tons
shipped in July, the most since June 2009, and 18,488 tons in
September 2012.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
