Capital City Builders LLC, a closely
held luxury-home builder based in McLean,  Virginia , is including
outlets for electric-vehicle chargers as a standard feature in
new houses.  Capital City has built a $3.7 million home with a 240-volt
charger-ready outlet in the metropolitan Washington area,
Managing Partner Ali Khazai said in a telephone interview today.
U.S. sales of EVs doubled in the first half of this year as
carmakers expanded their offerings, according to the U.S. Energy
Department.  “After looking at the Teslas and some of the products Ford
and Chevy are bringing out, they’re here to stay,” Khazai said.
“It’s time to make this a standard thing.” The company is
planning at least two additional homes that will support
chargers.  Capital City’s decision to include EV-ready garages comes
as more home builders offer clean-energy options including solar
panels. Two cities in  California , Lancaster and Sebastopol, have
passed measures requiring solar panels on new homes.  The city council of  Palo Alto , California, on Sept. 23
supported a proposal  requiring  new homes include wiring for
electric-vehicle chargers. The council may vote on rules by the
end of this year that would go into effect in 2014, Claudia
Keith, a city spokeswoman, said in an interview today. The
council may consider a similar measure for commercial buildings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
