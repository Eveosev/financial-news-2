South African yellow corn futures
dropped the most in more than 11 weeks.  Yellow corn for delivery in December, the most active
contract, declined 2.3 percent to 2,141.80 rand ($213) a metric
ton, the most since July 15 by the midday close on the South
African Futures Exchange. The white variety for delivery in the
same month fell 1.7 percent to 2,336.80 rand a ton, the most
since Aug. 14.  South Africa is the continent’s largest corn producer. Meal
made from the white variety is one of the nation’s staple foods
and yellow corn is mostly fed to animals.  Wheat for December delivery fell 0.8 percent to 3,412 rand
a ton, the most since Sept. 2.  To contact the reporter on this story:
