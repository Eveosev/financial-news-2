Daimler AG (DAI) ’s Mercedes-Benz sold more than 2,300 of its $29,900 CLA coupe in its first week of availability, helping the brand post a 6.7 percent September gain and widen its U.S. luxury-vehicle lead.  The CLA has been promoted in a television spot featuring actor Willem Dafoe as the devil. Mercedes also boosted E-Class deliveries by 17 percent to 5,647 last month. Mercedes sold 24,697 vehicles, according to a statement yesterday from Stuttgart, Germany-based Daimler. The CLA is Mercedes’s first car in the U.S. with a starting price under $30,000.  “As the bargain entrance into the Mercedes portfolio, we weren’t sure how luxury buyers would react,” said Alec Gutierrez, auto analyst for Kelley  Blue Book . “Through one week, it looks like they’re scooping it up.”  Deliveries for  Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW) ’s BMW brand rose 8.3 percent in September from a year earlier to 23,568, helped by demand for its 7 Series, whose deliveries more than tripled, and 5 Series sedans, the Munich-based automaker said.  The September results expanded Mercedes’s lead for 2013 to 2,491 vehicles, 215,056 to 212,565, up from a margin of 1,362 through August. BMW has sold the most  luxury vehicles  in the U.S. the past two years. Daimler Chief Executive Officer  Dieter Zetsche  said in July he expected his company to come up short again in 2013.  The figures don’t include Daimler’s cargo vans and Smart cars and BMW’s Mini brand, which aren’t luxury vehicles.  Lexus Lags  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) ’s  Lexus , the top-selling luxury-auto brand in the U.S. for 11 years through 2010, posted a 4.2 percent decrease in September.

By vehicle registrations, Mercedes topped BMW last year, according to researcher R.L. Polk & Co.
