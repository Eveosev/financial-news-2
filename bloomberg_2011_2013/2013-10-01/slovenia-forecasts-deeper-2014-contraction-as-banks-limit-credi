Slovenia’s economy will shrink more
than previously forecast next year as the ailing banking
industry and austerity measures prevent the euro member’s
recovery, the government’s economic institute said.  Gross domestic product will shrink 0.8 percent in 2014, the
institute said today in the capital Ljubljana, revising its June
estimate for a 0.2 percent contraction, while maintaining its
prediction for a 2.4 percent slump this year. The economy will
expand 0.4 percent in 2015, the institute predicted.  “The lower estimate for next year is mainly due to the
delay in repairing the banks and the fact that the government is
extending its austerity measures,”  Bostjan Vasle , the
institute’s director, told reporters. “The credit shortage is
set to ease by the end of next year, while the main risk to the
2015 recovery is a possible delay in fixing the banks.”  Slovenian banks, burdened by bad loans worth more than a
fifth of the country’s economic output, pushed the nation to the
brink of a bailout in March after a  crisis in Cyprus  prompted
investors to sell the Balkan nation’s assets. Speculation about
a rescue intensified in recent days after officials, including
Prime Minister Alenka Bratusek, said the country may turn to the
European Stability Mechanism, the euro-region rescue fund, for
aid to prop up the banks.  Non-performing loans overdue for 90 days surged to 7.9
billion euros ($10.7 billion) at the end of July, the central
bank said in a report today. That accounts for 17 percent of all
outstanding loans, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
