The pound advanced for a third day
versus the dollar, erasing this year’s decline, as an industry
report showing U.K. manufacturing expanded in September added to
evidence the recovery is gaining momentum.  Sterling climbed to the highest level in nine months versus
the U.S. currency after a partial shutdown of America’s federal
government undermined demand for the dollar. The pound
appreciated to the strongest since January versus the euro
before reports this week that economists said will show
Britain’s construction and services both expanded last month.
U.K. government bonds were little changed.  “Manufacturing activity continues to accelerate but at a
slower pace, which is good,” said  Gavin Friend , a currency
strategist at National Australia Bank Ltd. in  London . “There’s
an underlying bid to sterling that’s coming from the negative
impact on the dollar from the U.S. situation. There was a period
when we started 2013, when people assumed that things were
looking pretty bad for the U.K., but since July the data’s
turned around and things are looking better.”  The pound advanced 0.2 percent to $1.6215 at 4:42 p.m.
London time after rising to $1.6260, the highest level since
Jan. 2. The U.K. currency ended last year at $1.6255 and then
fell as much as 8.9 percent to its 2012-low of $1.4814 on July
9. Sterling appreciated 0.1 percent today to 83.52 pence per
euro after climbing to 83.33 pence, the strongest since Jan. 17.  Manufacturing Expands  A  manufacturing index  based on a survey of  purchasing
managers  fell to 56.7 last month from a revised 57.1 in August,
according to Markit Economics and the  Chartered Institute of
Purchasing and Supply . A reading above 50 indicates growth. A
gauge of construction output will climb to 59.5 from 59.1,
economists said before a report tomorrow, while an index of
services the following day will stay at a six-year high of 60.5,
a separate survey showed.  “The pound has continued to outperform,” Morgan Stanley
analysts led by head of global currency strategy Hans Redeker in
London, wrote in a note to clients. “We maintain a near-term
bullish stance.”  After breaching $1.62 yesterday, the U.K. currency may now
extend gains toward January’s high, Redeker wrote. The pound
climbed to $1.6381 on Jan. 2, the strongest since August 2011.  The pound fell versus 28 of its 31 major counterparts in
the first quarter of 2012, sliding 6.5 percent against the
dollar, amid speculation a stuttering recovery would spur the
 Bank of England  to keep expanding bond purchases that tend to
weaken a currency.  Growth signs have since convinced the central bank to leave
its stimulus target at 375 billion pounds, with Governor  Mark Carney  saying last week there was no case for more quantitative
easing unless the economy falters.  Best Performer  The pound rose 6.7 percent in the past six months, the best
performer among 10 developed-nation currencies tracked by
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The euro gained 5.5
percent, while the dollar weakened 0.5 percent.  The U.S. currency weakened against most major counterparts
today as wrangling between  Senate Democrats  and  House
Republicans  threatened to curb economic growth.  U.K. Prime Minister  David Cameron  underscored the dangers
stemming from the partial shutdown.  “It is a risk to the world economy if the U.S. can’t
properly sort out its spending plans,” Cameron told BBC Radio
4’s “Today” program in Manchester, where his  Conservative
Party  is holding its annual conference.  The yield on the benchmark 10-year gilt fell one basis
point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 2.71 percent. The 2.25
percent bond due in September 2023 rose 0.07, or 70 pence per
1,000-pound face amount, to 95.995.  The Debt Management Office said today it will sell 1.75
billion pounds of index-linked securities maturing in November
2019 on Oct. 8.  Gilts handed investors a loss of 3 percent this year
through yesterday, according to Bloomberg World Bond Indexes.
German bunds dropped 1.4 percent, and U.S. Treasuries declined
2.4 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
