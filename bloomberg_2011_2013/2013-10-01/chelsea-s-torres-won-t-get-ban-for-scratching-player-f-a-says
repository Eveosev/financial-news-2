Chelsea’s  Fernando Torres  won’t be
banned for scratching Tottenham’s Jan Vertonghen in the cheek
during the clubs’ 1-1 draw on Sept. 28, English soccer’s
governing body said.  Torres, who is serving a one-match suspension after being
sent off for other incidents in that match, could have faced
another three games out for putting his hand to Vertonghen’s
face early in the second half. An official saw the confrontation
as it happened and didn’t take action, making it impossible for
a retrospective suspension, the F.A. said today on its website.  Television replays showed Torres raking his fingers across
the Belgian’s face.  “One of the match officials saw the coming together of the
two players, albeit not in its entirety,” the F.A. said.  The Spaniard got a second yellow in the match in the 81st
minute, and was dismissed. The F.A. can only review incidents
for further penalties where the referee and the other officials
are too far away or have their view completely obstructured.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
