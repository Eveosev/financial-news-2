An underground fuel reservoir
exploded at a Czech Lukoil petrol station on a highway north of
 Prague  this afternoon, killing one person and injuring two, the
fire brigade said.  The 10,000 liter reservoir at the station about 10
kilometers (6 miles) north of the Czech capital wasnâ€™t
completely full when it exploded, fire brigade spokeswoman Lenka
Kostkova said by phone today. Authorities partially closed the
highway, she said.  Lukoil  Czech Republic  is a unit of Russian OAO Lukoil. It
has 44 gas stations in the central European country. The company
is looking into the matter and could not immediately provide
further details, spokeswoman Dana Bratankova said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
