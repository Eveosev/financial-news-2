Electricite de France SA ,  Europe ’s
biggest power generator, is in exclusive talks with Dalkia
France to acquire the urban lighting company Citelum SA.  Citelum , which manages traffic lights and surveillance
cameras and the illumination of monuments, including the Eiffel
Tower, would “enhance the services EDF offers to local
authorities,” the Paris-based utility said in a statement. EDF
didn’t give a value for the transaction.  Citelum is owned by energy-services company Dalkia, the
object of a dispute between EDF and  Veolia Environnement SA (VIE) ,
Europe’s biggest water company. EDF and Veolia are vying for
control of Paris-based Dalkia. The international division is
split equally between the two utilities and its French
activities are 34 percent-owned by EDF and the rest by Veolia.  EDF sued Veolia a year ago, saying a 2000 agreement allowed
for 50-50 control of Dalkia  France , the domestic operation.
Veolia rejected the claim.  Spokeswomen for both companies declined to comment today on
whether there are talks to resolve the dispute.  Citelum, created by EDF in 1993, reported 2012 sales of 343
million euros ($465 million) last year compared with 221 million
euros four years earlier.  The sale is part of Veolia’s plan to sell 6 billion euros
of assets in 2012 and 2013 to lower debt.  Citelum staged an LED light show at the Eiffel Tower in
2009 for the 120th anniversary, according to the  website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
