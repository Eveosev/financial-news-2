Gold climbed as the first U.S.
government shutdown in 17 years began, increasing demand for a
protection of wealth on concern that the impasse may endanger
the recovery in the largest economy. Silver increased.  U.S. lawmakers failed to forge an agreement in budget talks
for the new fiscal year that started at midnight, triggering the
shutdown that risks curbing growth. Parts of the economy that
depend on the government “would be hamstrung,” President
 Barack Obama  said before the deadline. No further negotiations
between the two main parties are scheduled.  “We’ve never seen such a breakdown like we’re seeing at
the moment and it’s happening during the middle of a very slow
recovery from a fairly deep recession,” Justin Smirk, senior
economist at Westpac Banking Corp., said from Sydney. “You’ve
got people going for gold as a hedge.”  Bullion for immediate delivery rose as much as 0.6 percent
to $1,337.49 an ounce, and was at $1,331.91 at 10:27 a.m. in
 London . Silver advanced as much as 1.2 percent to $21.9515 an
ounce, before trading at $21.769.  Gold futures for December delivery rose 0.3 percent to
$1,331.10 an ounce on the Comex in New York in trading that was
42 percent below the average for the past 100 days for this time
of day, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  The U.S. Congress, which has stumbled to fiscal deadlines
in the past three years, failed to break the deadlock, putting
as many as 800,000 federal employees off work from today. The
Bloomberg U.S. Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against
10 major currencies, fell 0.2 percent.  Bullion dropped 4.7 percent in September even as U.S.
Federal Reserve policy makers decided not to slow their $85
billion-a-month of bond buying, preferring to wait for further
signs of improvement in the economy.  Platinum rose 0.1 percent to $1,405.24 an ounce, after
earlier falling as much as 0.6 percent to $1,395.13, the lowest
level since July 11. Palladium advanced 0.3 percent to $725.58
an ounce.  To contact the reporter on this story:
