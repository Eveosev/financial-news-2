Nouriel Roubini , the New York
University economist who predicted the financial crisis, said
Greece will probably leave  Europe ’s single currency within 12
months and could soon be followed by Portugal.  “The euro zone is a slow-motion train wreck,” Roubini
said in a panel discussion in Davos, Switzerland today. “Not
only Greece, other countries as well are insolvent.”  Roubini said he sees a severe recession in Europe and a 50
percent probability “that over the next three to five years the
euro zone will break up.”  “Not all the members are able to stay,” he said. “Greece
and maybe Portugal may exit the euro zone --Greece within the
next 12 months.  Portugal  may take a while longer.”  Bondholders agreed with European officials three months ago
to implement a 50 percent cut in the face value of more than 200
billion euros ($263 billion) of debt by voluntarily swapping
bonds for new securities.  A worsening  economy  since then has made it more difficult
to achieve a goal of cutting Greece’s debt to 120 percent of
gross domestic product by 2020. An accord with bondholders is
tied to a second bailout from Greece’s European partners and the
 International Monetary Fund  for the country, which faces a 14.5
billion-euro bond payment March 20.  Greece and its private creditors said they made
“important” progress during talks in  Athens  on a debt-swap
accord needed to lower the country’s debt and pave the way for a
second package of international aid.  To contact the reporters on this story:
