Inflation in  Belgium  accelerated to
the fastest rate in more than two years in February as the cost
of electricity and heating oil jumped.  The inflation rate in Belgium, the sixth-largest economy in
the euro region, quickened to 3.4 percent, the highest since
October 2008, from 3.2 percent in January, the Ministry of
Economic Affairs in Brussels said in an e-mailed statement today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
