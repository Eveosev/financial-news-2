Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT) , the world’s
largest defense company, said first-quarter profit rose by 5.6
percent, aided by higher sales of its Patriot anti-missile
interceptors, and it boosted its full-year profit estimate
because of a favorable tax settlement.  Profit from continuing operations increased to $548
million, or $1.55 a share, from $519 million, or $1.38, a year
earlier, Bethesda, Maryland-based Lockheed said today in a
statement. That beat the $1.51 average estimate of 20 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg. Sales increased 2.9 percent to $10.6
billion.  Full-year profit will be in the range of $6.95 to $7.25 a
share -- an increase of 25 cents at both ends of the range from
its previous estimate in January -- because of a favorable U.S.
tax settlement, Lockheed said in the statement.  Chief Executive Officer  Robert Stevens  and other defense
company executives face the prospect of a steeper decline in
U.S. defense spending beyond the $78 billion, five-year
reduction proposed in January by Defense Secretary  Robert Gates .
President  Barack Obama  on April 13 announced $400 billion of
additional cuts in national security spending through 2023.  “Lockheed, as well as its peers, continue to struggle to
find growth amongst a backdrop of declining demand by its
biggest customer, and we believe that will eventually lead to
further consolidation in the sector,”  Joel Levington , a bond
analyst at Brookfield Investment Management Inc. in New York,
said in an e-mail.  Joint Fighter Proposal  Lockheed’s and the Pentagon’s largest weapons program, the
 F-35 Joint Strike Fighter , is delayed and facing cost overruns.
The Pentagon’s shift to fixed-price contracts also means that
Lockheed is facing a squeeze on the stealthy jet’s profits.  Lockheed yesterday submitted its proposal to the Pentagon
for the next trial production lot of F-35 jets, Bruce Tanner,
the company’s chief financial officer, said in an interview. The
offer was for 32 jets for the so-called low-rate initial
production Lot 5 and the order is expected this year, he said.  The plane has completed 199 flight tests, or 40 percent
more than the planned 142 tests, Tanner said. Defense officials
overseeing the F-35 program are scheduled to meet in May to
review progress.  Award Fees  Lockheed can potentially earn $52.5 million in award fees
this year for the F-35 program if it meets five goals the
Pentagon has set for it, Stevens said during a conference call
today.  Last year, Lockheed earned only $7 million out of a
possible $35 million for the program because the company met
only one out of five goals, he said.  The money is part of $614 million in fees that Gates
ordered the Pentagon to withhold from the company in February
2010 because the program was behind schedule. The remainder of
the money is subject to negotiation, Stevens said.  The  United Arab Emirates  has postponed the planned purchase
of 12  C-130J  transport planes, Stevens said in a conference call
with analysts today.  The planned direct-commercial sale of the airplanes to the
UAE was announced by the Pentagon in December 2009 and was
valued at about $119 million.  The UAE, which also has expressed an interested in buying
Lockheed’s Terminal High Altitude Air Defense System, or  Thaad ,
continues to be interested in the system, Stevens said.  The “air defense system will hold out,” he said,
referring to the UAE’s interest amid delays in concluding a
sale. The potential sale, announced by the Pentagon in September
2008, is valued at about $6.95 billion.  Iraq Sales Postponed  Iraq , which had sought a fleet of 18  F-16  jets that were
valued by the Pentagon at about $4.2 billion in September 2010,
has decided to postpone the purchase, Stevens said.  Iraqi officials recently traveled to  Fort Worth ,  Texas ,
where Lockheed builds the F-16s, and told company executives
that the government was shifting the airplane funds to other
domestic programs, Stevens said.  Still, Iraqi officials told Lockheed that there was “a
long-term recognition” of “a need for more than 18 tactical
aircraft” and the country may buy more F-16s in the future,
Stevens said.  Defense Budget  Stevens also has said the lack of an approved 2011 defense
budget for the first six months of the fiscal year, which began
in October, may hurt programs.  Still, the company maintained its 2011 revenue goal in the
range of $45.7 billion to $47.2 billion. Analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg forecast profit of $6.98 a share on sales of $46.5
billion.  Lockheed’s programs weren’t affected by Congress’s delay in
approving the 2011 defense budget until April, Tanner said.  “Most programs are tracking according to the plan and I
haven’t heard of anything slipping,” because of the late
passage of the budget, he said.  Lockheed rose $1.60, or 2.1 percent, to $79.04 in  New York 
Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares have gained 13
percent this year.  Sales at two of Lockheed’s four units rose during the
quarter, led by a 8.2 percent gain in Aeronautics, which
includes the F-16, F-22 and F-35 fighter jets as well as the
C-130J transport planes. Sales at the unit rose to $3.18
billion, while profit remained unchanged at $331 million.  Space Systems sales declined 4.7 percent to $1.8 billion,
Lockheed said. Unit profits rose 4.8 percent to $217 million.  Patriot Gains  Electronic Systems, the unit that makes anti-missile
systems including the Patriot Advanced Capability-3 or PAC-3
missile, and oversees the Navy’s Littoral Combat Ship, reported
a 6.4 percent gain in sales to $3.4 billion. Unit profits
increased 10 percent to $417 million, aided by higher volume of
PAC-3 work, the company said.  Sales at the Information Systems and Global Solutions unit
fell by 3.6 percent to $2.15 billion. Profit at the unit, which
provides information technology services to U.S. agencies
including the Pentagon, remained about the same at $194 million.  Lockheed’s discontinued operations for the quarter include
the Enterprise Integration Group, which was sold to Veritas
Capital for $815 million. The sale of the Pacific Architects &
Engineers unit to private-equity firm Lindsay Goldberg was
completed April 4, and no sale terms were disclosed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
