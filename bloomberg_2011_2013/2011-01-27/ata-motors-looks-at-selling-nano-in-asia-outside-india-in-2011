  Tata Motors Ltd . may expand sales of
the Nano, the world’s cheapest car, to countries such as  Thailand ,  Sri Lanka  and  Bangladesh  as early as this year as
demand for the egg-shaped vehicle rebounds in India.  “We will go after these markets one after another,” Tata
Chief Executive Officer Carl-Peter Forster said yesterday at an
auto-industry event in Bochum, Germany. “The Nano is a raw
diamond that needs polishing.”  Nano sales are likely to climb to 8,000 to 10,000 cars a
month “soon” from a current rate of 6,000 to 7,000 deliveries
as the Mumbai-based automaker expands marketing for the model
and continues to offer 100 percent financing to customers who
can’t afford a down payment, Forster said.  The Nano’s registrations in December rose to 5,784 cars
from a record low of 509 in November, Tata Motors said on Jan. 1.
The manufacturer has more than doubled warranties and offered
easier financing to promote the model. The December tally, a 60
percent increase from a year earlier, was below the 9,000-car
monthly sales record reached in July.  Tata delivered the Nano to its first customer in July 2009.
The car, which  costs  as little as 137,555 rupees ($3,000) in  New
Delhi , went on sale in  India  nationwide on Jan. 3 through Tata’s
874 dealerships. Deliveries had been limited to 12 states as the
company worked through initial orders and ramped up production
at a new factory that opened in June with annual capacity to
build 250,000 of the car.  Maintenance Packages  Tata Motors fell 3.8 percent to 1,150.3 rupees at the 3:30
p.m. close in Mumbai trading. The shares gained 65 percent last
year, the second-best performance on the benchmark Sensitive
Index of the Bombay Stock Exchange.  The automaker is also offering maintenance packages,
including one for 99 rupees a month, and inviting prospective
customers to meetings with Nano owners to overcome the concerns
of first-time car buyers.  The model’s sales fell on a month-on-month basis from July
through November because of price increases and safety concerns
following reports of at least three fires with the model. In
response to the drop, Tata began a television advertising
campaign and added sales points in smaller towns in December,
the same month it lengthened warranties to four years or 60,000
kilometers (37,300 miles) and introduced the maintenance plan.  The carmaker said in November that it would retrofit Nanos
with additional protection in exhaust and electrical systems
after the fires. Investigations concluded that reasons for the
fires were “specific” to the vehicles involved, Tata Motors
has said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
