European Union oilseed output will
rise 5.2 percent in the 2012-13 marketing year, Copa-Cogeca
said.  Oilseed output in the 27-nation bloc will climb to 30.3
million metric tons, the farm-lobby group said in a report
today. The planted area will gain 0.8 percent to 11.6 million
hectares (28.7 million acres), according to the report. Rapeseed
output will rise 7.7 percent to 20.8 million tons as the seeded
area gains 1.3 percent to 6.9 million hectares, Copa-Cogeca
said.  “Despite the bad weather conditions,” EU oilseed
production will rise, the group said. “This is a result of new
improved productive varieties and demonstrates the need for
research and innovation.”  Soybean prices on the Chicago Board of Trade have dropped
19 percent this year and rapeseed futures on ICE Futures Canada
are down 14 percent.  EU sunflower production will gain 0.2 percent to 8.15
million tons as soybean output remains little changed at 1.26
million tons, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
