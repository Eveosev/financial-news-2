Scotland ’s  government  told schools to
shut or finish early today as winds reaching up to 90 miles per
hour batter the country and disrupt road, rail and air travel.  Hurricane-force gusts arrived in the Western Isles and are
expected to hit central and southern Scotland during the day.
The  Met Office  issued a red alert, its highest warning, and
forecast the winds would increase in strength, with the
strongest gales reaching central Scotland at about midday.  Network Rail said on its  website  it would operate a speed
restriction across Scotland from 10 a.m. and services would be
“thinned out” because of longer journey times. Glasgow Airport
said it  expected delays  and cancellations throughout the day,
while Edinburgh Airport is monitoring the situation. Road
bridges are expected to close to some or all traffic.  “It is clear that there will be widespread disruption
across the transport network,” Deputy First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in an e-mailed statement.  All schools in Edinburgh, the Scottish capital, will be
closed today from midday, the local authority said on its
 website . In Glasgow, Scotland’s largest city, all council-run
schools will be closed today, said the local municipality. The
winds may cause structural damage, according to police.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
