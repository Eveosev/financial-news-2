Oil prices  may surge if Europe
resolves its sovereign debt crisis, bolstering demand while
stockpiles are down, said  David Greely , head of energy research
at  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  in New York.  “The physical markets are telegraphing severe tightness,”
Greely said at the Inside Commodities conference today in New
York.  Supplies have declined on speculation that the European
debt crisis may lead to a global economic slowdown that
undermines crude demand, he said. Falling inventories leave the
market vulnerable to bullish surprises like supply disruptions
because of tension in the  Middle East , he said.  Oil for January delivery dropped $1.89, or 1.9 percent, to
$98.60 as of 12:33 p.m. on the New York Mercantile Exchange.  Goldman raised its  New York Mercantile Exchange  oil price
forecast for the first quarter of 2012 to $102 a barrel from
$99.50 in October, according to an e-mailed report on Nov. 23.  Goldman increased its second-quarter price projection to
$113.50 a barrel from $107.50 and its third-quarter estimate to
$115 from $111, Greely said in the report. The fourth-quarter
forecast was increased to $120 from $118.50 projected on Oct. 4.  Supplies in  Cushing, Oklahoma , the delivery point for the
Nymex contract, have declined 26 percent to 31.1 million barrels
the week ended Dec. 2 from a record 41.9 million in April.  Oil advanced to a 31-month high of $113.93 a barrel in
April after uprisings toppled leaders in Tunisia and  Egypt  and
fighting to oust Muammar Qaddafi erupted in Libya, disrupting
exports from a country that is home to Africa’s largest proved
crude reserves.  To contact the reporters on this story:
