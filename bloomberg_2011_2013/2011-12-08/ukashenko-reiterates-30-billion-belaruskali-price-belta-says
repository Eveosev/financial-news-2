President  Aleksandr Lukashenko 
reiterated that Belarus won’t sell state-controlled fertilizer
producer Belaruskali for less than $30 billion, Belta  reported .  “We don’t have to sell this company, neither a single
share, nor two shares, nor 10, nor the whole 100 percent,”
Lukashenko said today during a meeting on the potash industry in
the capital, Minsk, according to the news agency.  Belaruskali’s output will reach 11 million metric tons or
more in 2015 after new mines are started, Belta cited Lukashenko
as saying. Production of 15 million tons a year will be possible
after the development of additional deposits begins and a second
potash plant is opened, Lukashenko said, according to Belta.  To contact the reporter on this story:
