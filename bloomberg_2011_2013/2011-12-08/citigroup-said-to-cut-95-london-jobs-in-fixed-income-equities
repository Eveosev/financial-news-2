Citigroup Inc. (C) , the third-biggest
U.S. bank by assets, is cutting about 95 jobs in its markets
business in London to reduce costs, two people with knowledge of
the plan said.  The cutbacks, part of the 4,500 reductions announced this
week, are taking place today in fixed income, currencies, rates
and commodities, as well as equities, said the people, who
declined to be identified because the talks are private.
Citigroup officials in London declined to comment.  Financial firms globally have announced more than 200,000
job losses this year, up from about 58,000 last year and 174,000
in 2009, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Citigroup
Chief Executive Officer Vikram Pandit is cutting staff as banks
prepare for regulations on minimum capital levels and the
European sovereign-debt crisis persists, threatening revenue
from trading and  investment banking .  Bank of America Corp. (BAC)  CEO Brian T. Moynihan said in
September that the Charlotte, North Carolina-based lender plans
to cut 30,000 jobs in the next few years.  Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN)  said last month it would eliminate
1,500 jobs after its investment bank posted its first quarterly
loss since 2008 in the third quarter.  BNP Paribas (BNP)  SA, France’s
biggest bank, said in the same month that it will trim about
1,400 jobs at its securities unit, with most coming from the
lender’s capital markets and structured-finance teams.  To contact the reporter on this story:
