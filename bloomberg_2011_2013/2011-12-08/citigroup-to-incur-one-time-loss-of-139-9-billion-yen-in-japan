Citigroup Inc. (C)  said its  Japan  unit
will incur a one-time loss of 139.9 billion yen ($1.8 billion)
for the nine months ended Sept. 30 after it increased funds set
aside as reserves for the consumer-finance business.  Citigroup Japan Holdings Corp.  will deduct 95.6 billion yen
from its deferred tax assets, which will reduce consolidated
earnings, the company said in a financial report filed to
Japan’s Ministry of Finance today.  This is due to “the recent harsh business environment in
the consumer-finance industry,” the bank said in the filing.  Citigroup Japan Holdings, which owns a consumer-finance
unit and a brokerage, will disclose earnings “soon,” said
Chikako Oki, a spokeswoman in Tokyo at New York-based Citigroup.  “These results are presented under local Japanese
accounting standards and have no impact on Citigroup’s U.S.
financial statements,” Jon Diat, a New York-based spokesman for
the bank, said in an e-mailed statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
