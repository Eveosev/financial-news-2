DGF Investimentos plans to raise a
$200 million private equity fund outside  Brazil  to invest in
companies with revenue of $10 million to $100 million,  Valor
Economico  reported, citing Founding Partner Sidney Chameh.  DGF hired Mercury Capital Corp. as placement agent for the
fund, whose fundraising process will likely be completed in
October 2012, according to the Sao Paulo-based newspaper.  DGF is also considering raising a fund in Brazil but hasnâ€™t
yet made a decision, Valor said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
