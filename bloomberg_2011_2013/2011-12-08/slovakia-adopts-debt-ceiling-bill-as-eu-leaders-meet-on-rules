Slovak lawmakers approved a
constitutional bill imposing a cap on state debt as the eastern
euro-area country steps up efforts to strengthen public finances
amid a lingering debt crisis in the region.  All except one of the 147 lawmakers present in Bratislava,
Slovakia, today backed the bill, which would trigger an
automatic freeze in spending and other sanctions should state
debt near 60 percent of gross domestic product. The ceiling is
set to decline gradually to 50 percent of GDP.  The debt crisis that started in  Greece  last year has spread
to other euro-area members, underscoring a need to put public
finances for all the region’s countries onto a sustainable path.
Passage comes as European Union leaders meet to discuss a
French-German proposal to amend the bloc’s treaties to toughen
the rules on fiscal discipline.  The bill assumes tougher sanctions as debt gets closer to
the limit. Should it exceed 57 percent of GDP, the government
must prepare a balanced budget, while crossing the limit would
result in a confidence motion against the government. Penalties
can be avoided in case of a significant  recession , a banking-
industry bailout and a natural disaster.  To contact the reporter on this story:
