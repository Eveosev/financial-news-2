Dutch Prime Minister  Mark Rutte  said
sanctions against countries that break European Union fiscal
rules should be as automatic as possible.  “We need to do everything to ensure sanctions that are as
automatic as possible for countries that are not meeting
agreements,” Rutte told reporters in Brussels today before a
meeting of EU leaders.  “At the same time we need to make sure that countries that
run into trouble come up with a credible program to address the
problems,” he said. “And we also have to be prepared to help
them.”  Rutte said it’s essential to hold together the 27-nation
EU. “It’s not only a union of the 17 euro states,” he said.
“It is very important for the Netherlands, which is growth
oriented and thinks it’s important there are jobs, that we keep
countries like the U.K.,  Sweden ,  Poland  and the Baltic states on
board.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
