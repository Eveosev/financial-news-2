Bahraini state prosecutors dropped
cases against athletes accused of taking part in anti-regime
protests, state-run Bahrain News Agency reported, citing General
Attorney Abdulrahman al-Sayyed.  Al-Sayyed said the prosecution will inform the court of its
decision, BNA reported late yesterday. He said the cases lost
their importance after King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa asked that
those who defamed him be forgiven, according to BNA.  Al-Sayyed said the case against teachers accused of
exploiting their profession to perform illegal political
activities will continue.  At least 35 people were killed during the clashes earlier
this year. Shiites represent about 70 percent of Bahrainâ€™s
population, according to the U.S. State Department, and have
been demanding rights equal to those of Sunnis, including
appointments to senior government and military posts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
