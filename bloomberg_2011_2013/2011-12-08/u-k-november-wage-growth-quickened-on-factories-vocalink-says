Take-home pay growth at Britainâ€™s
largest publicly traded companies accelerated in November, led
by manufacturing companies, VocaLink Ltd. said.  Incomes after tax and other deductions climbed 2.6 percent
in the three months through November from a year earlier, the
group said in a statement in  London  today. That compares with
2.5 percent in the quarter through October.  Wage growth at manufacturers picked up to 4.1 percent, the
highest in three years, from 2.7 percent, according to the
report. Pay growth slowed 0.1 percentage point to 2.4 percent at
service companies and dropped to 2 percent from 2.2 percent in
the public sector. VocaLink said the increase in manufacturing
pay may be due to a number of pay awards linked to retail-price
inflation, which was at 5.4 percent in October.  The company, which processes 90 percent of British salaries
paid directly to bank accounts, used salary-payment data from
more than 200 members of the  FTSE 350 Index (NMX)  and more than 600
government-related organizations for the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
