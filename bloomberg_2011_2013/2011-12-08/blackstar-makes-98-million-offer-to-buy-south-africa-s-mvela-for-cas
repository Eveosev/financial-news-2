Blackstar Group SE  announced its firm
intention to buy  Mvelaphanda Group Ltd. (MVG) , the largest shareholder
in South African media company  Avusa Ltd. (AVU) , for as much as 1.9
billion rand ($194 million).  Mvela Group investors would choose either cash, Blackstar
shares, or a combination of these in return for their stake, the
companies said in a statement today. Blackstar, a Luxembourg-
based  investment company , has secured support from Mvela Group’s
largest shareholder, Mvelaphanda Holdings Ltd., which owns 20
percent, it said. The maximum cash portion of the offer is 800
million rand.  “The cash consideration is just 45 percent of the purchase
price,” Blackstar Executive Chairman Andrew Bonamour said by
phone from Cape Town today. “The total consideration is about
1.9 billion rand, or about 3.77 a share.”  Mvela Group’s biggest assets are a 3 percent stake in  Absa
Group Ltd. (ASA) , Barclays Plc’s South African bank, and a 21.3
percent stake in Avusa, the South African media company that has
a joint venture with the Financial Times and publishes the
nation’s largest weekend broadsheet newspaper.  “The Blackstar board believes that Mvela Group’s assets
represent an attractive investment portfolio to which it can add
significant value in the medium term and provides an excellent
fit as part of Blackstar’s growth strategy,” the company said
in the statement.  Mvela Group shares closed 1.2 percent up at 3.34 rand each,
giving the company a market value of 1.9 billion rand.  To contact the reporter on this story:
