Hedge funds  went out of business at
the fastest pace in more than a year in the third quarter, hurt
by the market volatility triggered by the European sovereign
debt crisis, according to a report.  The number of funds liquidating rose to 213, the worst
three-month period for the industry since the first quarter of
2010, Chicago-based Hedge Fund Research Inc. said in the report
released today. In the second quarter, 191 hedge funds shut.  Hedge funds posted investment losses of 6.2 percent on
average in the three months through September, the industryâ€™s
biggest quarterly decline since the collapse of Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc. in September 2008 triggered a global economic
crisis.  The MSCI World Index (MXWO)  plunged 17 percent in the third
quarter of 2011 as investors became increasingly concerned
 Europe  would fail to stop the debt crisis spreading from Greece.  The number of hedge funds started in the period declined to
265 from 280 in the second quarter, Hedge Fund Research said. In
total, money managers have founded 843 hedge funds in 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
