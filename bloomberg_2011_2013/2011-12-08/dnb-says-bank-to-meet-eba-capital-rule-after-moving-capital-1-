DNB ASA  said its banking unit is
meeting a 9 percent capital requirement under a European Banking
Authority test after it injected capital from the parent.  The EBA’s calculations showed that DNB Bank ASA had a
common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 7.82 percent and DNB
raised the level to the required 9 percent with immediate effect
by using available internal funds, the bank said today on its
 website . The EBA today said DNB Bank had a capital shortfall of
1.52 billion euros ($2.02 billion).  “We had about double the amount of the capital needed for
the bank at the group level, so it was just a matter of moving
it around,” Per Sagbakken, head of  investor relations  at Oslo-
based DNB, said today by phone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
