A 32-year-old man pleaded guilty to
plotting an attack in June, with machine guns and grenades, on a
military center in  Seattle  where enlistees are screened and
processed.  Walli Mujahidh, also known as Frederick Domingue Jr., of
 Los Angeles , faces as long as 32 years in prison under the terms
of his plea agreement, the  Justice Department  said today in a
statement. The other defendant in the case, Abu Khalid Abdul-
Latif, also known as Joseph Anthony Davis, of Seattle, is
scheduled to go on trial in May.  Law-enforcement officials were tipped off by an informer
who was approached by the defendants to participate in the
attack and to supply weapons, prosecutors said. The two men were
arrested when they took possession of disabled firearms supplied
by the informer, according to prosecutors.  “Today’s plea underscores the threat posed by homegrown
violent extremists and the need for continued vigilance to
detect and dismantle their plots,” Lisa Monaco, assistant
attorney general for national security, said in the statement.  Mujahidh’s lawyers, Lee Covell and Michele Shaw, didn’t
immediately return calls to their offices for comment on the
guilty plea.  The case is U.S. v. Abdul-Latif, 11-228, U.S. District
Court, Western District of  Washington  (Seattle).  To contact the reporter on this story:
