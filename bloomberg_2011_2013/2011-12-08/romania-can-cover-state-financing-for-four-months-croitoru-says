Romania ’s Finance Ministry has enough
funds to cover state financing for at least four months, said
Lucian Croitoru, a monetary-policy adviser to central bank
Governor Mugur Isarescu.  The Balkan nation, which has a two-year, 5 billion-euro
($6.6 billion) precautionary accord with the  International
Monetary Fund  and the European Union, has a good standing and
its government debt yields remain at normal levels amid the euro
area’s debt crisis, Croitoru told reporters today at a seminar
in the central Romanian town of Sinaia.  The news service Mediafax quoted unidentified officials
earlier today as saying the ministry has a buffer totaling 3
billion euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
