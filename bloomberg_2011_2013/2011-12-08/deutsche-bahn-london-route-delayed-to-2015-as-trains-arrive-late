Deutsche Bahn AG  said its planned
rail service from  Frankfurt  to  London  via the Channel Tunnel has
been put back from 2013 to 2015.  Delays in the delivery of 16 new high-speed trains from
 Siemens AG  mean that the planned three-times-daily service won’t
now start as scheduled, according to a spokeswoman who declined
to be named, citing policy at Berlin-based Deutsche Bahn.  Eurostar Group Ltd., the only passenger-express operator
through the tunnel on routes linking London with Paris and
Brussels, is planning expanded services of its own, with trains
reaching Amsterdam, Cologne and Frankfurt as early as 2014.  Production of the latest Velaro-D trains to be used for
Deutsche Bahn’s ICE or Intercity-Express service to the U.K. has
been held up by delays at components suppliers, said Peter Gottal, a spokesman for Munich-based Siemens. Eurostar e320
trains also based on the Velaro series are unaffected, he said.  “The trains ordered by Eurostar are currently being
produced and will be delivered in 2014 as planned,” Gottal said.  Sueddeutsche Zeitung  and  Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung 
reported the  Deutsche Bahn  delay in previews of articles to be
published tomorrow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
