Russia may sell 20 state-owned banks
and companies by 2017,  Vedomosti  reported, citing the latest
draft of a privatization program.  The program assumes that state-controlled oil, gas and
energy companies, which already have shares trading on market,
canâ€™t be privatized at a price less that they got in the initial
share sale, Vedomosti says.  OAO Rosneft, OAO Rushydro, OAO Zarubezhneft and OAO Inter
RAO Ues are among the companies, the Moscow-based newspaper
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
