Amgen Inc. (AMGN) , the worldâ€™s largest
biotechnology company, will buy back about 83.3 million shares
at $60 each in a modified Dutch auction, amounting to about 9.5
percent of the stock outstanding.  About 98 million shares were tendered at or below $60 each,
 Thousand Oaks , California-based Amgen said today in a statement.
The $5 billion auction, announced last month, is part of a $10
billion buyback program.  The offer, which enabled investors to specify a price at
which they were willing to sell, is part of a push by the
drugmaker to return at least 60 percent of net income to
investors. Amgen, with $15.1 billion in 2010 revenue, declared
its first quarterly dividend this year, of 28 cents a share.  Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Credit Suisse managed the
tender offer, Amgen said in the statement.  Amgen rose less than 1 percent to $58.41 at the close of
trading in  New York . The shares have increased 6.4 percent this
year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
