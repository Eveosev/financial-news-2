U.S. stock futures, European equities
and the euro fell, erasing earlier gains, after European Central
Bank president  Mario Draghi  said he didn’t signal plans to
purchase more bonds.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index expiring this
month fell 0.7 percent to 1,255.0 at 9:05 a.m. in  New York  after
climbing as much as 0.6 percent. The Stoxx Europe 600 Index lost
0.4 percent, reversing a 1 percent advance. The euro slipped 0.4
percent to $1.3363. The S&P GSCI Index of commodities rose 0.1
percent, paring a gain of as much as 0.9 percent.  Equities and the euro  headed lower  after Draghi said the
ECB’s bond-purchase program was not eternal or infinite, damping
speculation that the central bank will increase purchases of
debt of struggling European nations. Stocks and the shared
currency had rallied earlier as Draghi said the ECB was pursuing
more non-standard measures to fight the crisis, including three-
year loans and looser collateral criteria.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
