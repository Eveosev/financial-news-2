Stichting Pensioenfonds ABP , the
Netherlands’ biggest retirement fund, sued  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) ,
alleging violations of securities laws and fraud involving sales
of residential mortgage-backed securities.  The suit, filed in New York state court in Manhattan
yesterday, accused the New York-based bank of negligent
misrepresentation, alleging the sales were based on false and
misleading statements. The damages should be determined at
trial, according to the suit.  “ABP purchased securities that were far riskier than had
been represented, backed by  mortgage loans  worth significantly
less than had been represented and that had been made by
borrowers who were much less creditworthy than had been
represented,” Stichting Pensioenfonds said in the lawsuit.  Jennifer Zuccarelli , a spokeswoman for JPMorgan, declined
comment about the lawsuit.  The Heerlen, Netherlands-based pension fund also sued
Deutsche Bank AG over similar allegations in  New York  State
Supreme Court in September. Stichting serves as the pension fund
for Dutch public educational and government workers and has more
than 250 billion euros ($332.8 billion) in assets under
management, according to the complaint.  The case is Stichting Pensioenfonds ABP v. JPMorgan Chase &
Co., 653383/2011, New York State Supreme Court (Manhattan)  To contact the reporter on this story:
