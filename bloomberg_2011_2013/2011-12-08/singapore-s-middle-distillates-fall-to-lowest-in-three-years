Singapore ’s stockpiles of middle
distillates declined to the lowest level in more than three
years for the week ended Dec. 7, government figures show.  Inventories of  middle distillates , a category that includes
gasoil and kerosene, dropped 17 percent to 7.85 million barrels,
the lowest since the week ending May 7, 2008, according to data
released today by the Ministry of Trade and Industry.  Light distillates  such as naphtha, reformate and gasoline
fell 6.6 percent to 11.42 million barrels, a three-week low.  Onshore stocks of  residues , a category that includes  fuel
oil  and low-sulfur waxy residue and excludes bitumen, dropped
2.6 percent to 17.17 million barrels, a two-week low, according
to data e-mailed by  International Enterprise Singapore , a unit
of the ministry.  The trade ministry unit surveys refiners,  oil companies  and
storage terminals on a voluntary basis. The results may exclude
some offshore storage capacity, International Enterprise said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
