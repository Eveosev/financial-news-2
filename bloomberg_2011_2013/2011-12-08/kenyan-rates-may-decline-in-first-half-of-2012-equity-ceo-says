Kenyan  interest rates  may decline in
the first half of 2012 as inflation in East Africa’s biggest
economy slows, said James Mwangi, chief executive officer of
 Equity Bank Ltd. (EQBNK) , the nation’s largest lender.  Equity raised its effective lending rate to 25 percent last
month from 19 percent previously after the central bank
increased Kenya’s  benchmark rate  to rein in surging inflation
and as the shilling dropped to a record low against the dollar.  “The  exchange rate  has now been dealt with decisively, I
expect that inflation will show very positive positions by
March,” Mwangi said in an interview on the sidelines of a
conference in Nairobi, the capital. “It will be single digits,
and following thereafter I expect interest rates to have
positively responded by June.”  Kenyan  consumer inflation  surged to 19.7 percent last month
as the worst regional drought in 60 years drove up food prices
and the shilling’s slump raised import costs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
