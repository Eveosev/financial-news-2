The  U.S. Treasury  will sell $12
billion in 4-year 4-month inflation-indexed notes on Dec. 15.  The notes will be dated Oct. 15, settle Dec. 30, and mature
April 15, 2016. The CUSIP number, or identification, will be
912828QD5. The offering will raise all new cash, the Treasury
said.  Inflation-indexed securities are intended to provide
investors with a hedge against inflation. The securities rise or
fall in value with movements in the Labor Department’s consumer
price index, with a three-month lag.  The securities also let the Treasury lower its cost of
borrowing in periods of tame inflation. Inflation adjustments
will be added to the notes’ principal and be payable at maturity.  To contact the reporter on this story:
