Germany and  France  are pushing back
against a British demand to shield the City of London as part of
European Union treaty negotiations designed to end the debt
crisis, a German government official said.  Chancellor Angela Merkel  and President  Nicolas Sarkozy  see
British Prime Minister David Cameron’s push for concessions at
an EU summit in Brussels as a distraction from their effort to
enforce government spending limits through EU treaties,
according to the official who spoke on condition of anonymity
because the summit negotiations in Brussels are ongoing.  The divisions open up the possibility that any treaty
agreement may only be possible among euro members and not all 27
EU members. Merkel and Sarkozy’s drive for treaty change also
means that proposals to funnel central bank loans through the
 International Monetary Fund  may be put to one side until the
euro area can agree on the legal amendments needed to lock in
budget prudence.  “There are obviously proposals circulating, but it’s not
certain yet if there will be any agreement on Thursday and
Friday this week,” Dutch Finance Minister Jan Kees de Jager said
of the IMF plans in an interview in the French port of Marseille
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
