Moscow authorities closed the square
where political activists plan to gather to protest the Dec. 4
parliamentary elections, Vedomosti reported, citing
Mosvodokanal, operator of the capitalâ€™s water pipeline network.  As many as 20,000 people are planning to demonstrate at
Revolution Square on Dec. 10, the Moscow-based newspaper
reported today, citing its own estimates from data posted on
social networks. City authorities gave approval for a
demonstration of no more than 300 people.  To contact the reporter on this story:
