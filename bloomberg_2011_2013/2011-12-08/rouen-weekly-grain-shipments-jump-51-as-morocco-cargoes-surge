Grain exports from the French port of
Rouen,  Europe ’s biggest cereal-shipping hub, jumped 51 percent
in the week ended yesterday as Morocco took the most wheat in
more than a year.  Outbound grain amounted to 175,735 metric tons from Dec. 1
to Dec. 7 compared with 116,172 tons a week earlier, the  Seine
River port  said today in an e-mailed report. Cargoes included
166,235 tons of wheat and 9,500 tons of malting barley.  Morocco was the leading destination with 151,805 tons of
wheat, the most shipped to the country in a week since at least
August 2010.  Algeria , the biggest importer of French grain,
didn’t take any cargoes in the most recent period.  Rouen accounted for 45 percent of  France ’s maritime grain
exports in 2009-10, ahead of La Pallice on the Bay of Biscay,
which shipped out 19 percent, according to data from national
crops office FranceAgriMer.  Rouen grain loadings by destination, in tons:  To contact the reporter on this story:
