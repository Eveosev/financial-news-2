Television Broadcasts Ltd. (511) ’s 104-
year-old co-founder Run Run Shaw will retire as chairman after
more than 40 years at Hong Kong’s biggest television company.  Shaw will step down Dec. 31 and be replaced by Executive
Deputy Chairman Norman Leung, 71, who will become chairman 
Jan. 1, the company known as TVB said in a filing yesterday.  TVB accounted for more than 80 percent of Hong Kong’s free-
to-air television market by advertising sales in 2009, according
to consultant Media Partners Asia. It is one of the world’s
biggest producers of Chinese-language programming, distributing
shows in more than 40 countries, according to its  website .  Shaw, knighted by  Queen Elizabeth II  in 1977, was also a
producer behind the 1982 hit movie  Blade Runner . He set up  Hong
Kong ’s dominant free-to-air broadcaster in 1967 after a
filmmaking career that started in  Shanghai  in the 1920s. Chow
Yun-fat, Andy Lau and Stephen Chow all acted in dramas produced
by TVB before going on to movie stardom.  TVB advanced 0.1 percent to HK$46 at the midday break in
Hong Kong trading. The stock has gained 9.5 percent this year,
compared with a 17 percent decline for the city’s  Hang Seng
Index .  The average board member age at TVB is about 70, the oldest
for a Hong Kong-listed company, according data compiled by
Bloomberg. The company was founded by eight people including
Shaw and Lee Hsiao-wo. Lee’s widow, Christina Lee, is a non-
 executive director .  Shaw’s Shaw Brothers (Hong Kong) Ltd. sold its 26 percent
stake in TVB to ITC Corp. Chairman Charles Chan, Cher Wang and
 Providence Equity Partners , according to a March 31 filing.
Shaw’s foundation donated its 2.59 percent interest in TVB to
educational and charitable institutions, according to the
statement, which didn’t give price details.  He will be given the title of chairman emeritus following
his retirement as chairman, non-executive director and member of
the executive committee of the board, TVB said in the filing
yesterday. Shaw won’t receive any pay under his new role.  To contact the reporter on this story:
