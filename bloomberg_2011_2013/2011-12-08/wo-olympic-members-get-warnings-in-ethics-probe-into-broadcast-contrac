Two International Olympic Committee
members from  Africa  got warnings after an ethics probe. Former
FIFA President Joao Havelange, who was also being investigated,
resigned three days ago.  Lamine Diack of Senegal received a warning and Issa Hayatou
of Cameroon was given a reprimand following the investigation by
the IOC’s ethics commission, President Jacques Rogge said today
at a press conference in Lausanne, Switzerland.  “It’s always sad when you have to discipline colleagues,
but we have to take care of the needs of the organization,”
Rogge said after the IOC’s executive board meeting.  A British Broadcasting Corp. program last year said Diack,
head of track and field’s governing body, and Hayatou, president
of the African soccer federation, received money from ISL, the
former marketing agency of soccer ruling body FIFA. Both men,
who were not IOC members at the time, denied the allegations.  Havelange was the longest-serving member of the IOC before
resigning. The BBC program said the Brazilian, who had been an
IOC member since 1963, received $1 million from ISL, which owned
television rights to soccer’s  World Cup  and collapsed with debts
of $300 million in 2001, prompting the IOC ethics investigation.  Rogge refused to comment on Havelange today because the 95-
year-old is no longer an IOC member. Havelange has denied the
allegations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
