Lima , Peru’s capital city, plans to
sell debt in international markets for the first time by issuing
$500 million worth of bonds denominated in soles over the next
two years, Mayor Susana Villaran said.  The sale would help finance $1.8 billion in infrastructure
projects in the city of 7.5 million people, such as the
expansion of a Pacific Ocean beach park called Costa Verde and
the building of a highway to better connect commercial and
residential areas, Villaran said in an interview at Bloomberg’s
headquarters in New York.  “The big picture is how to renew Lima,” Villaran said.
“Lima produces almost 50 percent of the national gross domestic
product and we have a lack of infrastructure.”  Lima  aims to sell bonds maturing in 10 years to 20 years,
city Chief Financial Officer Jose Miguel Castro said in the same
interview. He and Villaran are in New York to discuss the
capital’s financing plans with officials from JPMorgan Chase &
Co., UBS AG, Deutsche Bank AG and Morgan Stanley. They are also
meeting with potential investors.  “They know Peru, know its potential and are interested in
Lima, though it’s still unusual for  capital markets  to finance
bonds issued by municipal governments” in emerging markets,
Villaran said. “Lima will be a pioneer in a certain way.”  Fitch Ratings  started coverage of Lima’s foreign and local
currency debt Sept. 21, assigning a BBB- rating, the lowest
investment grade. Fitch rates  Peru ’s federal-government debt one
step higher, at BBB.  Existing Bonds  Lima sold 20 million soles ($7.43 million) of a 7.19
percent bond due 2013 in July 2008, and an additional 40 million
soles of the domestic-market notes a year later. Prices for the
securities aren’t available. The municipality’s total debt is
less than $200 million, Castro said.  Moscow, rated BBB by Standard & Poor’s and Fitch, sold 407
million euros ($543 million) of 10-year bonds to yield 5.064
percent in 2006. The yield on the notes has since declined 23
basis points, or 0.23 percentage point, to 4.83 percent,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The city of  Buenos Aires  sold $475 million of five-year
bonds in March 2010. The yield on the 12.5 percent notes has
declined 115 basis points to 11.35 percent. The city is rated B2
by Moody’s Investors Service, five levels below investment
grade.  To contact the reporter on this story:
