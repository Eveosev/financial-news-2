Petroplus Holdings AG , Europe’s
largest independent refiner, is working to reduce use of rare-
earth elements in its catalysts after prices advanced, its chief
executive officer said  “ Prices  of rare earth have been skyrocketing,” Jean-Paul Vettier said today on a webcast from Ingolstadt,  Germany . Rare
earths averaged $101,000 a metric ton in 2011, compared with
less than $10,000 in the middle of last year, according to a
 presentation  on the company’s website. Prices rose after  China 
cut its export quotas.  Petroplus is using 300 tons a year of rare earths in
catalysts that typically contain 3 percent of the metals,
Vettier said. The company has taken steps to cut that to 2
percent at its  Petit Couronne  refinery in  France  and is using a
type of catalyst at its U.K. Coryton plant that doesn’t contain
the material, he said.  Rare earths used in fluid catalytic cracker catalysts
include lanthanum, cerium, praseodymium and neodymium, according
to  Lynas Corp. , an Australian developer. Catalytic crackers are
used in making gasoline.  Demand for rare earths used in cracker catalysts rose to
18,400 tons a year in 2010, Lynas said on its website. That’s 23
percent more than in 2004 as crude from  oil sands  and shale are
increasingly used at refineries, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
