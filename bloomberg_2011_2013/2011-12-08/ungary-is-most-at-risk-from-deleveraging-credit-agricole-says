Hungary, Romania and Bulgaria are
most threatened by western European banks reducing lending in
emerging Europe, while risks for the  Czech Republic  and Poland
are the smallest, according to  Credit Agricole  SA.  “Hungary is the weakest link, with high external debt and
an open economy mainly driven by European exports,” Guillaume Tresca, a strategist in Paris, wrote in a report dated Dec. 7.
“Foreign-currency lending has been muted in the Czech Republic,
which means that it is less reliant on cross-border funding, and
leveraging has been reasonable. In Poland, the resilient growth
outlook should allow the war for deposits to be calmer.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
