China  executed a 35-year-old Filipino
convicted of drug trafficking, its fourth drug-related capital
punishment case involving the Philippines this year.  The unidentified man was put to death by lethal injection
in southern Guangxi province today, Philippine Vice President
Jejomar Binay said in televised comments from Indonesia, citing
Philippine diplomats in Beijing. China handled the case in
accordance with domestic laws, Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong
Lei said, without confirming the execution.  The man was caught carrying 1.5 kilograms of heroin on
Sept. 13, 2008, at Guilin International Airport in southern
China, where trafficking of at least 50 grams of any prohibited
drug is punishable by death. There are 208 Filipinos either
serving sentences or facing trial for drug-related crimes in
China, the Philippines Foreign Affairs department said.  Philippine President  Benigno Aquino  last week appealed for
the last time to Chinese President  Hu Jintao  to stop the
execution on humanitarian grounds. China turned down a visit
from Binay, who was supposed to deliver Aquino’s letter seeking
to commute the convict’s sentence to  life imprisonment .  “Drug related crime is a universally recognized felony,”
Hong told reporters today in Beijing.  In March, China executed three Filipinos -- a man and two
women -- on drug charges. The punishment was delayed by a month
after appeals by the Philippines.  To contact the reporter on this story:
