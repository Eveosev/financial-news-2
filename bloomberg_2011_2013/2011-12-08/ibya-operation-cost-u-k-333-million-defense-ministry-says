The U.K. contribution to the NATO
operation in  Libya  cost 212 million pounds ($333 million),
Defence Secretary Philip Hammond said.  The mission formally ended on Oct. 31, seven months after
NATO took control of military operations under a United Nations
resolution to protect civilians from Muammar Qaddafi. Qaddafi’s
42-year rule ended in August and the dictator was killed on Oct.
20.  Hammond announced the total in a speech in London today,
saying it was made up of 145 million pounds of operating costs
and 67 million pounds to replenish munitions.  “This is almost a third lower that the estimate my
predecessor provided to Parliament in October,” he said. “This
is due to the speed with which operations were concluded and a
reassessment of the cost of replenishing munitions used. A
successful outcome in every respect.”  Former Defence Secretary Liam Fox said on June 23 that the
cost of the Libya operation would be met from the Treasury
reserve rather than the Ministry of Defense budget.  To contact the reporter on this story:
