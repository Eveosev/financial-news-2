European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  said the ECB will offer banks as much money as they need
for three years and loosened collateral rules at refinancing
operations as officials try to ease strains in credit markets.  The ECB also cut banksâ€™ reserve ratios to 1 percent from 2
percent and will stop fine tuning operations at the end of each
reserve maintenance period, Draghi said at a press conference in
 Frankfurt  today. The 36-month loans will be conducted as a fixed
rate with full allotment, Draghi said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
