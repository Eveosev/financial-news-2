Hong Kong ’s Air Pollution Index was
“very high” at the city’s Central roadside-monitoring
station, the Environmental Protection Department said on its
website today.  The index was 101 in Central, 98 in  Causeway Bay  and 78 in
 Mong Kok  as of 9 a.m. local time, the department said. Roadside
pollution of more than 100 triggers a government warning for
people with heart or respiratory illnesses to avoid prolonged
stays in heavy-traffic areas.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
