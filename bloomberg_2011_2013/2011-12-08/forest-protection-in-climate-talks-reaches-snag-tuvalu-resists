Climate delegates in Durban
negotiating ways to protect forests as a means of storing carbon
have snagged on disagreements over private financing after the
Pacific island of  Tuvalu  balked at the use of market mechanisms.  “It has been some tough negotiations, with another
obstacle appearing just when one was overcome,” Andrew Hedges,
a partner at the legal firm  Norton Rose , said from Durban by e-
mail. “Tuvalu remains entrenched in its resistance to any
mention of markets.”  Representatives from almost 200 nations were working on the
finance text for forestry until early yesterday at the climate
change conference in Durban, South Africa, according to lobby
group Ecosystems Climate Alliance. The negotiations are part of
wider talks aimed to advance negotiations on a global climate
treaty to succeed the  Kyoto Protocol .  There’s “considerable disagreement on market mechanism and
whether to include or exclude offsets and carbon markets” under
the  United Nations ’ program of Reducing Emissions from
Deforestation and forest Degradation or REDD+, Donald Lehr, a
spokesman for the alliance, said by e-mail from the talks in
Durban. There’s “at least five options on the table regarding
finance,” he said.  The REDD+ program was designed to offer extra community and
biodiversity benefits alongside emissions savings from
preserving forests. It helps finance tree-protection projects by
awarding them with tradable credits.  To contact the reporter on this story:
