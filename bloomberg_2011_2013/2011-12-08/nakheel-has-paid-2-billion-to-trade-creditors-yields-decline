Nakheel PJSC, the developer of man-
made islands off Dubai’s coast, paid 7.3 billion dirhams ($2
billion) to trade creditors to date, the company said in an e-
mailed statement today.  Nakheel, which restructured debt in August, issued Islamic
bonds to its contractors and suppliers that month as part of an
8.5 billion-dirham program. The yield on Nakheel’s 3.8 billion-
dirham sukuk maturing August 2016 dropped three basis points, or
0.03 percentage points, to 18.83 percent at 4:46 p.m. in Dubai.  The developer will issue another 1 billion dirhams of
bonds, or sukuk, before the end of this year as part of its
$16.1 billion restructuring deal with trade creditors, Chairman
Ali Rashed Lootah said on Sept. 27.  Nakheel is also set to pay a 5 percent return on its sukuk
within days and all payments will be made on due dates, a
spokesman for the company confirmed in an e-mail to Bloomberg
News yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
