Canada ’s dollar fell for the first
time in four days after European Central Bank President  Mario
Draghi  said he didn’t signal stepping up bond purchases, sapping
demand for higher-yielding assets.  The loonie, as Canada’s dollar is also known, dropped from
the highest level in a month against its U.S. counterpart as the
ECB damped expectations that it will act to stem the region’s
sovereign-debt turmoil. The Canadian currency also weakened as
crude oil fell.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
