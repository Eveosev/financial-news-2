German  Chancellor Angela Merkel  said
she seeks a “significant step” toward a fiscal union to
restore the euro’s credibility at a European Union summit that
began in Brussels today.  “The euro has lost credibility, which has to be
restored,” Merkel told reporters as she arrived for the talks.
“We have to clarify that we accept more commitment and here
it’s for the 17 euro nations to make this clearer.”  The European Commission and the  European Court  of Justice
“will get more responsibility,” Merkel said. “That’s how it
will be clear that in the future we will stick to the
arrangements, to the stability and growth pact. We’ll take an
important step toward a stability union, a fiscal union.”  The 17 euro nations have to do this “as a favor to all of
 Europe ,” she said. “Whether it will be the 17 plus X, or all
27 countries together, will become clearer in the discussions.”  The euro can only regain credibility in the markets “if we
change the treaties in a way that develop in the direction of a
stability union,” Merkel said. “That’s what at the core here
for me. I hope we can be successful.”  After EU leaders meet, euro leaders may hold a separate
meeting on the crisis, she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
