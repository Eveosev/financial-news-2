China ,  India  and Arab nations are
among those seeking a decision from the  United Nations  to stop
developed countries introducing measures to limit trade because
of climate protection.  “Developed country parties shall not resort to any form of
unilateral measures, including tariff, nontariff, and other
fiscal and non-fiscal border-trade measures, against goods and
services from developing country parties on any grounds related
to climate change,” the group said in a  submission  yesterday on
the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change’s website.  Climate envoys entered the final two days of UN talks this
week in Durban,  South Africa . The European Union said in 2008 it
may force importers to buy emission allowances to protect its
industries from nations with no greenhouse gas limits.  The region should “be ready to continue to give the
energy-intensive industries their emissions trading system
allowances free of charge, or to require importers to obtain
allowances alongside European competitors,” European Commission
President Jose Manuel Barroso said at the time, noting that new
rules must comply with World Trade Organization regulations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
