Gasoline  declined in northwest  Europe 
as Petroplus Holdings AG started a unit today at its Coryton
refinery in the U.K. following a fault three weeks ago. The
fuel’s crack, or difference to Brent, widened.  Gasoil on  London ’s ICE Futures Europe exchange rose as
crude increased. The heating fuel’s crack, or premium to Brent
oil, expanded.  Light Products  Gasoline barges for immediate loading in Amsterdam-
Rotterdam-Antwerp changed hands at $918 to $921 a metric ton,
according to a survey of traders and brokers monitoring the
Argus Bulletin Board. That compares with yesterday’s deals at as
much as $927 a ton yesterday morning.  Royal Dutch Shell Plc, Total SA and North Sea Group were
the buyers. BP Plc, Chevron Corp. and Mabanaft BV were the
sellers. The deals are for Eurobob to which ethanol is added to
make finished fuel and are typically for 1,000 to 2,000 tons.  Petroplus started a fluid catalytic cracker at  Coryton 
following a compressor fault that forced its closure three weeks
ago, Chief Executive Officer Jean-Paul Vettier said on a webcast
from Ingolstadt,  Germany .  Gasoline’s  crack widened to a 3-cent premium to Brent from
a discount of 6 cents yesterday, according to PVM Oil Associates
Ltd., a crude and products broker in London.  Naphtha’s  discount to Brent narrowed to $9.47 a barrel from
$9.54 yesterday, PVM data shows.  Middle Distillates  Gasoil for December gained 0.4 percent to $961.25 a ton as
of 12:50 p.m. London time on the ICE exchange. The contract for
January also rose 0.4 percent to $951.75 a ton.  That leaves the backwardation unchanged at $9.50 a ton. A
market is in backwardation when near-term deliveries are more
expensive than future supplies and may signal an immediate
shortage or increase in demand.  The fuel’s  crack , a measure of refining profitability,
increased to $17.84 a barrel from $17.42 at 4:30 p.m. yesterday,
according to ICE data. Front-month Brent advanced 0.4 percent to
$109.94 a barrel on ICE.  To contact the reporter on this story:
