Komercni Banka AS (KOMB) , Societe Generale
SA’s Czech unit, gained the first day in three as optimism
European policy makers will tackle the debt crisis offset a
warning from Standard & Poor’s on the region’s lenders.  The stock increased as much as 3 percent and traded up 0.5
percent at 3,211 koruna as of 10:55 a.m. in  Prague . Komercni has
declined 28 percent so far this year.  European stocks climbed on speculation the  European Central
Bank  will reduce funding costs today to boost growth as leaders
meet to resolve the European Union’s sovereign crisis. S&P
yesterday put several banking groups, including SocGen and its
units, on “CreditWatch with negative implications,” after
issuing the same warning about 15 euro nations on Dec. 5.  “After the warning on eurozone states, it was clear that
S&P must take the same step with European banks,”  Milan Vanicek , head of research at J&T Banka AS in Prague, said in
response to e-mailed questions from Bloomberg. “There are now
more important expectations in the market for the EU summit,
which should also determine S&P’s rating view of the countries
and hence also the banks.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
