Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (LEHMQ) , which
won court approval this week for a $65 billion liquidation plan
that would pay creditors less than 18 cents on the dollar in the
next three years, failed in 2008 after increasing its investment
risks by 74 percent, according to a report by Seton Hall
University in Newark,  New Jersey .  Lehman had a “license to fail” that could be repeated by
other financial firms because it broke no laws, according to the
study, which based its findings on a report by bankruptcy
examiner Anton Valukas.  Once the fourth-largest investment bank, Lehman inflated
assets in a declining market, concealing its leverage from
investors, according to the report released today.  Lehman failed because of too much debt and risky real
estate investments, according to the examiner’s report. The firm
filed for bankruptcy in  New York  with
$613 billion in debt.  Lehman has winnowed down claims from 67,000 filed
originally demanding about $1.2 trillion from what was once the
fourth-largest investment bank. Through Oct. 31, it raised $13.8
billion from derivatives. Real estate sales fetched $3.9 billion
through June 30.  The case is In re Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., 08-13555,
 U.S. Bankruptcy Court , Southern District of New York
(Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
