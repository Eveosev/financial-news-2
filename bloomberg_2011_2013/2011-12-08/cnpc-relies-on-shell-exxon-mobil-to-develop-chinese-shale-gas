China  National Petroleum Corp. will
rely on help from  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  and  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) 
amongst others to develop its shale gas resources.  CNPC is working with Shell on a project in central China to
develop shale gas, its president Zhou Jiping told reporters
today in Doha, Qatar. The company has already made shale gas
discoveries and it needs more time to develop them, he said.  “The tectonic movement in China is even stronger than in
the U.S., and it’s making the structure more complex,” he said.
China has more potential gas resources than the U.S., according
to his estimates.  Chinese gas shale development will be more complex than in
the U.S. because of a different geological formation, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
