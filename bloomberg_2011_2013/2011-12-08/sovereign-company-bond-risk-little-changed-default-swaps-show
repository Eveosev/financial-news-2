The cost of insuring against default
on sovereign debt rose the most in five months after European
Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  failed to signal the lender
will buy more bonds.  The Markit iTraxx SovX Western Europe Index of credit-
default swaps on 15 governments climbed 31 basis points to 363
at 5 p.m. in London, the biggest jump since July. The Markit
iTraxx Crossover Index of 50 companies with mostly high-yield
credit ratings increased 48.5 basis points to 763, the highest
in more than a week, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.  The ECB cut its main rate a quarter percentage point today
to 1 percent and offered unlimited three-year loans to banks,
while dashing investor hopes for increased debt purchases to
ease governments’ access to funding. The Frankfurt-based central
bank acted as  Europe ’s leaders prepared to meet in Brussels for
the latest attempt to come up with a solution to the euro
crisis.  “Mr. Draghi was less encouraging than we had expected
regarding the potential for beefing up ECB asset purchases,”
BNP Paribas SA analysts wrote in a note.  The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125 companies with
investment-grade ratings rose 10.5 basis points to 176.75 basis
points. The Markit iTraxx Financial Index linked to senior debt
of 25 banks and insurers increased 30 basis points to 297 and
the subordinated index rose 51 to 530. An increase signals
deterioration in perceptions of  credit quality .  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($13.3 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer
face value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
