Indonesia ’s average oil export price
rose 3.4 percent in November from the previous month, boosted by
strong regional demand before winter in the north.  The Indonesian Crude Price, or ICP, rose to $112.94 a
barrel in November from $109.25 in October because of increasing
demand as cold weather came early in northern hemisphere, the
energy and mineral resource said on its website.  “ Japan ’s winter consumption for direct-burning crude is
also increasing because some nuclear power plants there have
remained idle after the earthquakes,” the ministry said in its
press release.  Asian refineries in  China  and India also resumed operations
after completing regular maintenance, adding to demand for
Indonesian crude, the ministry said. Indonesia’s Minas grade
rose 5 percent to $116.04 in November from $110.51 in October,
it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
