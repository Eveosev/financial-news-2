(Corrects Temasek’s stake in third paragraph.)  Temasek Holdings Pte. , Singapore’s
state-owned investment company, is selling as much as S$600
million ($467 million) of bonds exchangeable into  Li & Fung Ltd. (494) 
shares at a 40 percent premium to yesterday’s closing price.  The company sold S$500 million of the zero-coupon bonds
that will mature in 2013 and gave sale manager  Credit Suisse
Group AG (CSGN)  the option of offering a further S$100 million within
30 days of settlement, according to a Singapore stock exchange
filing today. IFR reported the transaction yesterday.  The sale lets Temasek generate money from its investment in
Li & Fung, the world’s biggest supplier of clothes and toys to
retailers. The investment firm has a 3 percent stake in Li &
Fung, according to its latest annual report for the 12 months to
March 31 this year. The  Singapore  company bought HK$3.88 billion
($499 million) of new shares in 2008.  Temasek said it will use the proceeds from the bonds to
fund its “ordinary course of business.” The sale is scheduled
to close about Dec. 14.  The bonds are exchangeble HK$23.80 a share, Temasek said.
Li & Fung gained 0.5 percent to HK$16.98 in Hong Kong trading
yesterday. The stock has declined 25 percent this year, compared
with the 16 percent decline in the city’s benchmark  Hang Seng
Index .  Should Temasek issue S$600 million of bonds, they will be
exchangeable for as many as 152.9 million shares, according to
the filing. Temasek has the right to settle exchanges with cash,
and will redeem unexchanged bonds at par on maturity.  The company’s American depositary shares were unchanged at
$4.32 at 1:27 p.m. in  New York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
