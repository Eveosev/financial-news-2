Shares of gold-mining companies that
have lagged behind the broader market will rebound as equity
investors gain confidence that the surging price of the metal
doesn’t signal a bubble, according to Peter Schiff, the chief
executive officer of Euro Pacific Capital Inc.  The share performance “shows a high degree of skepticism
among investors” on gold prices, Schiff said today at the
Inside Commodities conference in  New York . “That’s the
antithesis of a bubble. When investors figure out what’s going
on, they’ll be buying up gold shares.”  Demand for gold has been fueled by individuals and central
banks that want an alternative to currencies devalued by
expansions in money supplies, Schiff said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
