California  tax collections since the
start of the fiscal year have trailed projections by about $1
billion, less than the amount reported last month, the state
controller’s office said.  Revenue from July 1 to Nov. 30 was $1.02 billion less than
forecast in the state’s budget, Controller John Chiang’s office
reported in a financial statement for last month. On Nov. 10, he
reported the deficit was almost $1.52 billion through Oct. 31.  To contact the reporter on this story:
