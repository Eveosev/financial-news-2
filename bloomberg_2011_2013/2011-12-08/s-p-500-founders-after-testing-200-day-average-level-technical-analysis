The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX) 
failed to stay above its 200-day average for a third time since
October and the proportion of stocks trading above that level
fell, signs the rally may falter, StockCharts.com Inc. said.  The benchmark index for U.S. equities closed below its
average price in the past 200 days after surpassing the level
for three consecutive days this week. About  34 percent  of the
securities on the  New York  Stock Exchange trade above their 200-
day average, down from 83 percent in February, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The proportion has averaged 59 percent
since the S&P 500 started its rally from a 12-year low in March
2009, the data show.  The  S&P 500  failed to remain above its 200-day average at
the end of October, and again on Nov. 9 as the rally that drove
the index up 20 percent from its 2011 low fizzled amid concern
that  Europe ’s crisis was intensifying. The gauge stayed below
its 200-day average from Aug. 2 through Oct. 26, the longest
streak since the 358 days ended May 29, 2009, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  “The 200-day average is viewed as the line that best
determines whether a market or stock is in a major uptrend or
major downtrend,” John Murphy, the chief technical analyst at
Redmond, Washington-based StockCharts.com, wrote in a note
today. As for the percentage of stocks trading above the
average, 50 percent is “the minimum requirement to signal that
a major upturn is starting,” he said. The current level is
“not enough to support a  bull market .”  The benchmark measure fell 1.5 percent to 1,241.63 as of
3:20 p.m. in New York as the  European Central Bank  damped
speculation that it would buy more bonds to fight the region’s
sovereign debt crisis. Its 200-day average, which has been
falling since Aug. 5, is 1,263.68, Bloomberg data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
