Airbus SAS is competing to sell its
A330 refueling-tanker aircraft to the  Indian Air Force , a
marketing director for the model said at an air show in
Malaysia.  Airbus Military , an arm of the  European Aeronautic, Defence
& Space Co. (EAD)  planemaker that markets the A330 airliner’s tanker
version, has bid in a tender that  India  started at the end of
2010, Maggie Bergsma, a spokeswoman for the division, said in an
e-mail from the show in Langkawi, confirming comments made
yesterday by the executive, Pablo Quesada, to Agence France-
Presse.  The only company offering a competitor to the A330 in the
Indian contract would be Moscow-based United Aircraft Corp. with
its Ilyushin 78 model, as Boeing Co. hasn’t responded to the
request for proposals, AFP reported, citing unidentified people
in the aerospace industry.  “Boeing did not submit a proposal in 2011 for India’s
tanker requirement. If there is interest from our Indian
customers, we will be happy to evaluate any future
requirements,” the Chicago-based company said in an e-mailed
response to questions about its participation.  Indian government spokesmen didn’t immediately respond to
messages seeking comment.  Russia’s arms export monopoly submitted a bid “a long time
ago,” for the Ilyushin plane, Vyacheslav Davidenko, a spokesman
for Rosoboronexport, said today by phone.  Airbus so far has won orders for 28 A330 tankers from
Australia, the U.K.,  Saudi Arabia  and the United Arab Emirates.
The plane lost a competition in the U.S. to Boeing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
