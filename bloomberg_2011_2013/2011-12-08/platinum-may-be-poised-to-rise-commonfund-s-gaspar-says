Platinum may be poised to rise with
increased auto sales, said Jess Gaspar, the managing director of
Commonfund Asset Management.  “I like platinum,” Gaspar said today at the Inside
Commodities conference in  New York . “There’s some sentiment out
there that platinum has underperformed because of auto sales and
the earthquake in  Japan ,” which disrupted car-parts production,
he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
