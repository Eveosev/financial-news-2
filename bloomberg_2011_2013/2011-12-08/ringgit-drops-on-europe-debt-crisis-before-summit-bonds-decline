Malaysia’s ringgit declined on
concern  Europe ’s debt crisis will damp the Southeast Asian
nation’s growth outlook. Government bonds fell.  Malaysia’s industrial  production  growth eased in October as
slowing global demand led mining companies to decrease output.
Production rose 2.8 percent from a year earlier after gaining a
revised 3 percent the previous month, the statistics department
said today. Pressure on European leaders to halt the spread of
the crisis at a summit that starts today in Brussels intensified
after the European Union had its AAA long-term rating put on
“creditwatch negative” by  Standard & Poor’s .  “Everyone is just looking at the European Union summit,”
said Suresh Kumar Ramanathan, a currency strategist at CIMB
Investment Bank Bhd. in  Kuala Lumpur . “People are not
interested in aggressive positioning. The external factors are
driving sentiment rather than internal factors.”  The ringgit dropped 0.1 percent to 3.1330 per dollar as of
4:13 p.m. in Kuala Lumpur, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The currency declined as much as 0.3 percent earlier.  The yield on the 3.434 percent notes due August 2014 added
two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 3.05 percent,
according to Bursa Malaysia.  To contact the reporters on this story:
