London  police investigating phone
hacking at News Corp.’s now-defunct News of the World tabloid
said they won’t pursue further legal action against a 31-year-
old former reporter who was arrested last month.  Bethany Usher, who was detained Nov. 30, denied involvement
in phone hacking in an e-mailed statement the day after her
arrest. The Metropolitan Police will take “no further action”
against a woman arrested in the case on Nov. 30, according to a
statement today that didn’t name Usher.  Usher, who now teaches journalism classes at  Teesside
University , didn’t work at the tabloid’s headquarters, spending
most of her time on the road reporting in the northern part of
 England , she said in a Dec. 1 statement. She worked for
newspapers including the tabloid between 2005 and 2008 and
didn’t immediately respond to an e-mail seeking comment today.  Police have made 20 arrests this year in three separate
probes of phone hacking, computer hacking and police bribery by
journalists at the News of the World and possibly other U.K.
publications.  News Corp. (NWSA)  shuttered the tabloid in July to help
contain the five-year-old scandal after it was revealed
journalists hacked the voice mail of a murdered school girl in
2002, while she was still missing.  To contact the reporters on this story:
