Precious-metals prices are likely to
rise as central banks expand their balance sheets, said  David Kotok  of Cumberland Advisors.  “The size of central-bank balance sheets is only headed
up,” Kotok, the chairman and chief investment officer at
Cumberland, said at the Inside Commodities conference today in
 New York . “That would suggest precious metals are going to be
higher. They are not likely to go lower.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
