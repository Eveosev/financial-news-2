Invacare Corp. (IVC) , maker of home and
long-term care medical products, plunged the most in 27 years
after saying U.S. regulators proposed suspending some operations
at its headquarters and a wheelchair plant in  Ohio .  Invacare sank 29 percent to $14.70 at the close of trading,
the biggest single-day decline since Dec. 27, 1984. The  Food and
Drug Administration  proposed a consent decree requiring the work
shutdown based on previously disclosed violations found during
inspections, the Elyria, Ohio-based company said in a statement.
Invacare said it intends to enter into talks with the FDA on the
decree.  Operations wouldn’t resume until the FDA concludes Invacare
is in compliance, Invacare said. The company said it’s tried to
improve compliance processes in the past year with the help of
outside medical device consultants.  “Invacare is committed to full compliance with FDA
regulations, and it intends to work cooperatively with the FDA
to resolve the agency’s concerns,” according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
