Romania may obtain 20 million euros
($27 million) to 60 million euros from the sale of a minority
stake in national air carrier Tarom SA,  Mediafax  reported,
citing an internal document from the Transport Ministry.  Carpatica Invest and Swiss Capital are among brokerages
selected by the ministry to manage the sale of a 20 percent
stake in Tarom on the  Bucharest Stock Exchange  next year,
according to the Bucharest-based news service.  The ministry reversed an earlier decision to cancel the
auction for the Tarom sale manager after the brokerages cut the
requested fee in half, Mediafax said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
