Cocoa fell, capping the longest slump
in 50 years, on speculation that supplies from West Africa, the
world’s biggest producing region, will exceed initial estimates.  Cocoa for March delivery dropped 0.5 percent to settle at
$2,131 a metric ton at 12:02 pm. on ICE Futures U.S. in  New
York . The price dropped for the 11th straight session, the
longest slump since at least 1961, according to Bloomberg data.
Earlier, the commodity touched $2,078, the lowest for a most-
active contract since November 2008.  Output in  Ivory Coast , the world’s top producer, may be
1.43 million tons in the year ending Sept. 30, up 3.2 percent
from its prior forecast, Ecobank Transnational Inc., based in
Lome, Togo, said. Global supplies will exceed demand for the
second straight year, Marex Spectron Group Ltd, a London-based
broker, has said.  “In addition to external factors such as the euro-zone
debt crisis and associated concerns about demand, the current
supply surplus is also weighing on prices,”  Carsten Fritsch , an
analyst at Commerzbank AG in Frankfurt, said in a report.
“Supply estimates for the current crop year are likewise being
revised upward.”  Cocoa has dropped 44 percent from a 32-year high of $3,775
a ton on March 11. In 2011, the price has slumped 30 percent,
and only cotton has posted a bigger drop among 24  raw materials 
in the Standard & Poor’s GSCI index.  The commodity “is falling on ample supplies and economic
contraction,” in  Europe , Fain Shaffer, the president of
Infinity Trading Corp. in Medford,  Oregon , said in an e-mail.
“The next objective may be $1,761, which is the 200-day moving
average on a monthly chart.”  In  London , cocoa futures for March delivery dropped 1
percent to 1,369 pounds ($2,139) a ton on NYSE Liffe. The price
has dropped 32 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
