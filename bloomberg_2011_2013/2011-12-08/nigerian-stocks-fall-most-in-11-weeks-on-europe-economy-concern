Nigeria stocks fell the most in
almost 11 weeks as foreign investors withheld funds on concern
about possible recession in Europe, Assur Asset Management Ltd.
said.  The Nigerian Stock Exchange  All-Share Index (NGSEINDX)  lost 365.14, or
1.8 percent, to 19,464.15 the 2:30 p.m. close in Lagos, the
biggest drop since Sept. 23.  “Locals are selling and foreigners are buying but they
themselves are under pressure now,” Victor Inyang, deputy
general manager at Lagos-based Assur, said by phone today.  Foreign investors are also waiting to see if the naira, the
Nigerian currency, will weaken further before buying equities,
Inyang said.  The naira fell 0.22 percent to 162.05 to the
dollar in the  interbank market  by 3:34 p.m., its lowest value
since Oct. 21.  European leaders are meeting today and tomorrow in Brussels
for talks to frame the fifth “comprehensive” solution in 19
months to a debt crisis that’s left Germany and  France  facing
the threat of losing their AAA rating from Standard & Poor’s.  To contact the reporter on this story:
