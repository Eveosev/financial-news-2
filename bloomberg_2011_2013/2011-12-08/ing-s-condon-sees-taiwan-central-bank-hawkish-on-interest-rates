Tim Condon , head of Asian research
for ING Groep NV, comments in a report on the chances of
Taiwan’s  central bank  cutting the  discount rate  on 10-day loans
as government exports data due today will probably show a
slowdown. The Central Bank of China (Taiwan) will meet on Dec.
30. Policy makers refrained from raising  interest rates  in the
Sept. 30 meeting after five straight quarters of increases.  “We consider the CBC the BOJ of Asia ex-Japan: ultra
hawkish and unlikely to cut barring a much more serious export
downturn.  ‘‘November export data is due. Consensus is 8.6 percent
year-on-year growth. The fourth quarter is seasonally the
second-strongest growth quarter but this year’s best months are
probably behind us. Exports have consolidated since March 2011
with the softness concentrated in electronics, 47 percent of
2010 exports.’’  To contact the reporter on this story:
