Russia’s United Aviation Corp. and
 Finmeccanica SpA (FNC)  may set up a new joint venture to produce a
long version of the Sukhoy Superjet plane with 130 seats that
would compete with  Boeing Co. (BA) ,  Kommersant  reported.  Finmeccanica may take as much as a 49 percent stake in the
new alliance, the newspaper said, citing people with the
knowledge of situation.  The Sukhoy Superjet is now produced by the two companies
under a joint venture in which Alenia, Finmeccanica’s parent,
holds a 25 percent stake.  The venture was barred from producing a longer version of
the plane after Boeing, which served as a consultant on the
project, banned the two partners from building one, Kommersant
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
