The  International Energy Agency  hopes
that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries will make
a “responsible decision” on oil production at its meeting in
Vienna next week, Chief Economist  Fatih Birol  said.  Demand remains strong, driven by China and the Middle East,
crude stockpiles in Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development countries are coming to “low levels” and high  oil
prices  are risky for the global economy, he said today in
Warsaw. “There’s disappointing news from non-OPEC producing
countries,” he said, without giving more details.  “Producers need clients with healthy economies and I hope
my colleagues from producing countries will make responsible
decisions considering those facts,” Birol said. He didn’t
specify whether the IEA hopes OPEC will limit or boost output.  The producer group will discuss output targets in Vienna on
Dec. 14.  To contact the reporter on this story:
