Sasini Ltd. (STCL) , a Kenyan tea and coffee
grower, retreated the first day in three after tea prices fell
during the latest auction of the leaf yesterday.  Shares of  Kenya ’s biggest tea company by market value
declined 2.7 percent to 12.55 shillings as of 12:09 p.m. in the
capital, Nairobi.  African tea prices fell to an average of $2.60 per kilogram
at a sale in the Kenyan port city of Mombasa, according to Tea
Brokers East Africa Ltd. The average price declined from $2.61 a
kilogram a week earlier, the tea trader said in an e-mailed
report yesterday.  Kenya is the world’s biggest producer of black tea, which
is its biggest foreign-exchange earner followed by tourism.  To contact the reporter on this story:
