Indian authorities have charged
Tibetan Buddhism’s third-most important spiritual leader for
offenses linked to the January recovery of more than $1 million
in foreign currency from his monastery headquarters.  Ogyen Trinley Dorje , the 17th Karmapa, is accused with nine
others of possessing 60 million rupees ($1.1 million) in
banknotes issued by 26 countries in contravention of foreign
currency rules, Sumedha Dwivedi, superintendent of police in
Una, a town in the northern state of  Himachal Pradesh  where the
charges were introduced in a court, said by phone.  The Karmapa’s office said at that time that the money was
donated by followers to fund its programs. “All our dealings
across the world are honest and completely transparent --
anything else would be contrary to the Buddhist principals that
we live by,” it said in Jan. 29  statement .  “We have found evidence following investigations,” said
Dwivedi, adding police may seek further charges. The court will
now consider the evidence and decide whether there will be a
trial, she said.  The Karmapa, 26, has been living near  Dharamshala , the
Indian headquarters of the Tibetan government-in-exile, since
his arrival from  Tibet  in 2000. He is seen as a possible
candidate to succeed the  Dalai Lama  as the spiritual leader of
Tibetan Buddhists.  To contact the reporter on this story:
