Traccr Ltd. said it started an
electronic brokerage for trading credit-default swaps and
credit-linked notes.  The platform provides live quotes from dealers, allows
investors to bilaterally negotiate terms and enables “real-
time” execution and confirmation, London-based Traccr said in a
statement.  Credit-default swaps pay the buyer face value in exchange
for the underlying securities or the cash equivalent should a
borrower fail to adhere to its debt agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
