South  Korea ’s growth is set to slow
and inflation may ease next year, the  Bank of Korea  said a day
after leaving borrowing costs unchanged on concern  Europe ’s debt
crisis poses risks to  Asia ’s fourth-biggest economy.  Gross domestic product  is likely to expand 3.7 percent in
2012 and 4.2 percent in 2013, compared with 3.8 percent this
year, the central bank forecast in a statement released in Seoul
today. Consumer prices may increase 3.3 percent next year after
a 4 percent gain in 2011, it said.  Governor Kim Choong Soo left the  seven-day repurchase rate 
at 3.25 percent for a sixth month yesterday, the longest pause
since tightening began in July 2010. Downside risks to growth
are “high” because of the European turmoil, possible slumps in
major economies and unrest in international financial markets,
the central bank said in its statement yesterday.  “The BOK will likely use a rate cut as the last resort
only when the economy faces a risk of recession,” Kong Dong Rak, a fixed-income analyst at Taurus Investment & Securities
Co. in  Seoul , said before the release. “It will likely stay pat
well into the first half of next year, opting to wait for a
clearer picture in Europe.”  The won fell 0.7 percent to 1,138.90 per dollar as of 9:46
a.m. in Seoul, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
Kospi stock index dropped 2 percent.  Growth Forecast Cut  The Bank of Korea may have to cut its forecast for 2012 GDP
again if the crisis in Europe worsens beyond the first quarter
of next year, which seems unlikely at the moment, Lee Sang Woo,
director-general of the Bank of Korea’s research department,
told reporters in Seoul today.  Quarterly economic growth may slow to 0.7 percent in the
first quarter before rebounding to 0.9 percent in the second and
1.1 percent each in the third and fourth, Lee said. He projected
1 percent growth for this quarter from the previous.  The central bank in July projected economic expansion of
4.6 percent and 3.4 percent inflation for next year.  Consumer
price s rose 4.2 percent in November compared with a year ago,
breaching the bank’s target limit of 4 percent.  Producer prices climbed 5.1 percent in November from a year
earlier, the slowest pace in a year, as vegetable and fruit
prices declined on increased output amid warm weather, according
to a central bank report today.  The central bank today forecast that the jobless rate will
drop to 3.4 percent next year from 3.5 percent this year. The
nation’s current-account surplus is expected to narrow to $13
billion in 2012 from $27.2 billion this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
