Mediobanca SpA (MB)  sent a letter to
 Fondiaria-SAI SpA (FSA)  this week asking for more details on the state
of the insurerâ€™s finances and how it planned to raise capital,
newspaper Il Sole 24 Ore reported, citing the letter.  Mediobanca, the biggest creditor of Fondiaria, has a 1.1
billion-euro ($1.5 billion) subordinated loan with the company,
the Italian newspaper said.  Fondiaria said yesterday it was still considering a plan to
set up a holding company to group assets for possible sale. The
insurer put out the e-mailed statement after a meeting between
Chief Executive Officer Emanuele Erbetta and Giancarlo Giannini,
head of Italian insurance regulator ISVAP, who expressed doubts
about the plan, Il Sole said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
