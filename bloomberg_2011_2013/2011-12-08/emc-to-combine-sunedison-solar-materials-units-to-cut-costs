MEMC Electronic Materials Inc. (WFR) , the
second-largest U.S. maker of polysilicon, said it will fire 20
percent of its workforce and cut production after prices for the
main raw ingredient used in solar cells and semiconductors plunged.  MEMC will combine its SunEdison project development unit and
solar materials business, cutting more than 1,300 jobs worldwide,
including 250 in the U.S., the St. Peters, Missouri-based company
said today in a statement. It will idle a facility in Italy,
reduce capacity at a plant in  Portland , Oregon, and scale back a
factory it’s building in Malaysia.  The company is seeking to lower its costs after a global glut
of polysilicon  drove  down prices 63 percent this year.  “Because of oversupply in the solar industry, you can buy
polysilicon and wafers below production costs, so it’s cheaper for
them to just shut down those facilities and buy it on the  spot
market ,” said Jeffrey Bencik, an analyst with Kaufman Brothers LP
in New York, who rates MEMC shares a “hold.”  MEMC will take a $700 million charge in the current quarter
and lowered its forecast. The company expects sales of $789
million to $861 million in the fourth quarter, compared with a Nov.
2 forecast of $800 million to $1.1 billion.  “We are reducing capacity and solar materials to take
advantage of lower cost product alternatives and achieve a more
balanced manufacturing model,” Chief Financial Officer  Mark Murphy  said today on a conference call.  MEMC shares fell 1 cent to $4.20 at the close in New York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
