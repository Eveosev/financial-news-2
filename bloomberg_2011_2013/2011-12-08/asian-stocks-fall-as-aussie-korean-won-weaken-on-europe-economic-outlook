Stocks slid, while the euro weakened
and Spanish and Italian bonds tumbled, as the  European Central
Bank  damped speculation it would boost sovereign-debt purchases.
U.S. equities extended losses amid a report Germany rejected
some proposals to fight the debt crisis at a summit of leaders.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index lost 2.1 percent to close
at 1,234.35 at 4 p.m. in New York, its worst drop in two weeks.
The Stoxx  Europe  600 Index sank 1.5 percent,  reversing  a 1
percent advance. The euro slid 0.5 percent to $1.3349. Yields on
10-year Italian and Spanish bonds jumped at least 38 basis
points. The S&P GSCI Index of commodities lost 1.2 percent,
erasing an early gain of 0.9 percent. Ten-year Treasury yields
fell six basis points to 1.97 percent.  European equities and the euro turned lower as ECB
President  Mario Draghi  said he did not necessarily signal the
central bank would increase government bond purchases when he
spoke last week, adding that the program was not eternal or
infinite. Stocks also fell as the European Banking Authority
said the region’s banks will need to raise 114.7 billion euros
($152.7 billion) in fresh capital, up from a previous estimate
of 106 billion euros.  “The pessimism is coming from the fact that the ECB didn’t
go any further on the possibility of buying debt,”  Peter Jankovskis , who helps manage about $2.4 billion at Oakbrook
Investments in Lisle, Illinois, said in a telephone interview.
“They continue to do things to Band-Aid the banking sector, but
they aren’t getting at the fundamental issue here, which is that
some of these underlying countries are nearing insolvency.”  EU Summit  U.S. equities slid to their lows of the day in the final
hour of trading as Reuters reported that  Germany  reiterated its
opposition to some of the debt-crisis fighting measures being
discussed at a summit in Brussels, including issuing common
euro-zone debt or running the temporary and permanent bailout
funds simultaneously.  Stocks and the shared euro currency had rallied earlier as
Draghi said the ECB was pursuing more non-standard measures to
fight the crisis, including unlimited three-year loans to banks
and looser collateral criteria. The Frankfurt-based ECB also
today reduced its benchmark rate by a quarter percentage point
to 1 percent, matching a record low.  The  S&P 500  snapped a  three-day rally (SPX)  as concern about
European efforts to fight the debt crisis overshadowed a bigger-
than-forecast decrease in jobless claims. Initial claims dropped
by 23,000 to 381,000 last week, the fewest since February, Labor
Department figures showed. The median forecast of 47 economists
in a Bloomberg News survey called for a drop to 395,000. Other
data showed inventories at U.S. wholesalers rose 1.6 percent,
the most in five months.  Market Leaders  JPMorgan Chase & Co., Bank of America Corp. and Alcoa Inc.
led declines in 29 of 30 stocks in the  Dow Jones Industrial
Average (INDU) , which retreated from the highest level since October
with a drop of 198.67 points, or 1.6 percent, to 11,997.7.  Morgan Stanley and Citigroup Inc. fell at least 7 percent
as financial shares tumbled 3.7 percent as a group, the biggest
drop among the 10 main industries in the S&P 500. Hartford
Financial Services Group Inc. slid 8.2 percent after the insurer
said it is targeting additional cost cuts as it copes with a
“fragile economic recovery.” Costco Wholesale Corp. declined 2
percent as the largest U.S. warehouse-club chain said profit
margin shrank because of rising costs.  200-Day Average  The S&P 500 is more than 2 percent below its average price
in the last 200 days after briefly surpassing it in each of the
previous three sessions, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The
index hasn’t closed above the trend line since Nov. 8, the day
before a decline of 3.7 percent. It fell 5.2 percent in the two
days after it rose above the 200-day average on Oct. 28.  Silver, oil and zinc slid more than 2 percent to help lead
declines in 18 of 24 commodities tracked by the S&P GSCI. Crude
tumbled 2.1 percent to $98.34 a barrel.  Automobile producers, banks and commodity companies led
losses in 18 of 19  industries  in the  Stoxx 600 .  Italy’s 10-year bond yield surged 47 basis points to 6.46
percent, sending their spread above benchmark German bunds up 55
basis points to 4.44 percentage points. Spain’s 10-year yield
climbed 38 basis points to 5.81 percent, trading 3.80 percentage
points above bunds.  ‘Devious Plan’  Euro-area leaders meeting today and tomorrow in Brussels
may agree to provide 150 billion euros ($201 billion) in loans
through the  International Monetary Fund  to shore up European
finances, a European Union diplomat said. Germany hasn’t taken a
public stance on the proposal.  Chancellor Angela Merkel  has
insisted that the rest of Europe first bow to tighter rules on
budget deficits in order to reassure central bankers about the
euro region’s longer-term economic health.  Germany is “still driving the bus and they are driving it
off a cliff,”  Sebastian Mallaby , director of geoeconomic
studies at the Council on Foreign Relations, told Bloomberg
Television. “It’s almost as though if they had a plan, a
secret, devious plan to blow up Europe, this is sort of what
they would be doing.”  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  retreated 0.7 percent as
 Australia ’s S&P/ASX 200 slipped 0.3 percent and  Japan ’s Nikkei
225 fell 0.7 percent. Australian employment fell by 6,300 after
a revised increase of 16,800 in October, compared with the
median estimate of a 10,000 advance in a Bloomberg survey of 22
economists. Japanese machinery orders unexpectedly slipped 6.9
percent from a month earlier, the Cabinet Office said in  Tokyo .  The MSCI Emerging Markets Index tumbled 1.4 percent, the
most in two weeks. The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index dropped
0.9 percent in  Hong Kong .  India ’s Sensex slumped 2.3 percent,
the most since Nov. 21, after the central bank signaled it may
not lower  reserve requirements  for lenders. Russia’s Micex Index
rose 0.6 percent after losing more than 4 percent in the
preceding two sessions following protests against the results of
parliamentary elections. Brazil’s Bovespa tumbled 2.1 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
