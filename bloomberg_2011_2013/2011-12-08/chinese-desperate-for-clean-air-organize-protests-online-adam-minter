On Nov. 19,  Yu Ping , a Beijinger and concerned father of one, mailed a simple request to officials at the Beijing Environmental Protection Agency. He asked if they would publicly disclose all of the air-pollution data they collect. After mailing his letter, Yu tweeted about it on Sina Weibo, China's most popular microblog. Two years ago, Yu's petition might have been the end of the matter: Chinese government officials are notorious for their lack of responsiveness to the public. But that was before the advent of the Chinese microblogs that now have hundreds of millions of followers. Despite rumors and evidence of Internet and media  crackdowns , ordinary Chinese are using microblogs as platforms for activism. Beijing's air quality is  worsening by the day . At the moment, there are two scales for measuring it. One quantifies relatively large particulates, like dust. This standard is called  PM10 , and it’s been used by Beijing's Environmental Protection Agency since 1982. The second takes into account the much smaller, but deadlier, particulates that actually cause smog. This standard is known as PM2.5, which is used by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. In 2008, the U.S. embassy in Beijing installed a PM2.5 monitor on its compound and began posting its measurements, on an hourly basis, to Twitter. This  didn't please Chinese authorities : What Beijing labeled a “good” air day under PM10 turned out to be an  unhealthy air day  under PM2.5. Alas, Twitter is blocked in China, and thus the embassy data is available only to those who know how to get around the government's Internet controls, or who know where to find the data that is re-posted elsewhere. As it happens, Beijing’s EPA also claims to collect PM2.5 data and says it is willing to share it with the Chinese people –-  in the future . Yu found the fact that the Beijing EPA and foreigners have access to PM2.5 data and Chinese citizens don’t infuriating. Not surprisingly, many of his fellow citizens did too. In his written request to the Beijing EPA, Yu asked for PM2.5 data from Oct. 1 to Nov. 18. Yu's tweet to his modest number of followers about his request included an  image  of the express mail airbill, along with the comment: “The data isn’t just for foreigners to know.” The post was forwarded a couple of hundred times, with almost universally supportive comments. Two days later, Yu returned to Weibo to post an  update : This post was forwarded 763 times. These responses, too, were mostly supportive, with many expressing outrage at the suggestion that the PM2.5 data isn’t being collected on a regular basis. “That’s too messed up!” exclaimed  Justice1222 , a Weibo user in Anhui Province. “Not only will they not disclose the data, they won’t disclose the corruption of the data, either.” Later that evening, Yu  tweeted  again on Weibo that, in his conversation with the EPA, they also claimed to monitor PM2.5 “only when it is needed.” This, he said, made him laugh. Finally, on Dec. 2, Yu received a document from the EPA officially denying his request. Yu  posted it  on Weibo, along with a note: A civil lawyer in  Shanghai  who uses the handle “Administrative and People’s Welfare Lawyer” -- and whose bio asks followers to “please find me a lawsuit” -- responded quickly with  advice : Yu replied that he would follow this advice, step-by-step. Other Weibo users responded too, signaling the beginning, possibly, of a grassroots movement to force local governments across  China  to disclose their own PM2.5 data. By Dec. 4, Beijing’s  declining air quality  was the top trending topic on Sina Weibo. That day, a Weibo user in Shanghai who goes by the handle "Riu Jiang FDU" (FDU stands for the elite Fudan University),  posed a question  to the Shanghai lawyer: “Is there anyone in Shanghai who has applied for the disclosure?” Half an hour later, the lawyer responded: On Dec. 5, Beijing’s air quality had deteriorated so much that highways were closed, and most flights out of Beijing were cancelled. Another Weibo user, going by the handle “ Coley ," posted a link to where users could file a petition for the Shanghai government's disclosure of PM2.5 data. Minutes later, Weibo users piled on, giving further instructions about how to press for air-pollution data. As political movements go, this is a modest start toward a modest goal. But in contemporary China, where any attempt to politically organize is considered suspicious and threatening by the authorities, it’s a notable step. Will it matter? Will Yu be successful? And will those inspired by him, and his informal lawyer, accomplish anything with their local governments? Probably not. In fact, the very public nature of this campaign will more likely serve to embarrass government officials, and lead them to dig in their heels further. But the failure of these requests shouldn’t obscure the quiet but unmistakable evidence that Weibo and other Chinese microblogs have provided lone petitioners like Yu with the means to organize and network on a national scale. Of course, it’s one thing to pursue data, and another to pursue policy changes. But Yu’s quest and inadvertent campaign, coming during a season of media crackdowns, is a humble sign that perhaps China’s Internet might remain a force for civil -- if not political -- change.
