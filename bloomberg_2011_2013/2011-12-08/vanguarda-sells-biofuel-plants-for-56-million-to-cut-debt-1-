Vanguarda Agro SA , a Brazilian farm
company backed by Spanish billionaire Enrique Banuelos, agreed
to sell two biodiesel plants to Oleoplan SA for 100 million
reais ($55.9 million) to pay off loans.  The two facilities, located in the Brazilian cities of
Iraquara and Porto Nacional, will cut Vanguarda’s net debt by 29
percent compared to Oct. 30, the New Mutum, Brazil-based company
said today in a regulatory filing.  Vanguarda is selling off unprofitable assets and shifting
its focus from biofuels to soybean, cotton and corn production,
according to Erick Hood, an analyst at SLW Corretora brokerage,
who spoke today in a telephone interview from Sao Paulo.  Vanguarda fell 1 centavo, or 1.9 percent to 53 centavos at
12:02 p.m. in  Sao Paulo .  “It’s part of a general restructuring of the company to
concentrate more on agriculture,” Hood said. Making biodiesel
“doesn’t provide good returns and is dragging down margins.”  The company agreed to sell two plants in the southern state
of  Rio Grande  do Sul for 58 million reais to agribusiness Camera
Agroalimentos SA on Oct. 24, according to a filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
