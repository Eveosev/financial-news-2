China  sold the second-biggest net
amount of Japanese debt on record as the yen retreated from a
postwar high against the dollar and benchmark  yields  approached
their lowest levels in a year.  The world’s largest holder of foreign-exchange reserves cut
Japanese debt by 853 billion yen ($11 billion) in October,
Japan’s Ministry of Finance said in a statement today. China’s
sold a net 2.02 trillion yen of Japanese debt in August 2010, a
record based on MOF data going back to January 2005.  “China may have sold to profit from the currency,” said
 Ayako Sera , a market strategist in Tokyo at Sumitomo Trust &
Banking Co., which manages the equivalent of $298 billion.
“Japanese debt isn’t attractive in terms of yields.”  Japan ’s 10-year yields have dropped 12 basis points since
the start of this year to 1.045 percent as of 10:15 a.m. Tokyo
time, and are about one percentage point  below  rates on  U.S.
Treasuries  with a similar maturity. Japan’s yields declined to
0.94 percent on Nov. 17, the lowest level since Nov. 8, 2010.  The yen surged to a postwar record of 75.35 per dollar on
Oct. 31 and was at 77.66 today. The currency underperformed all
of its 16 major counterparts in October.  China sold a net 391.6 billion yen in Japanese bonds and
notes in October, while it cut holdings of money-market
securities by 461.4 billion yen, today’s MOF data showed.  To contact the reporters on this story:
