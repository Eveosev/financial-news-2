Zimbabwean President  Robert Mugabe 
called for an end to violence in the southern African nation and
said elections to end a power-sharing government should be held
in 2012.  “We in Zanu-PF must renounce violence, reject it,” Mugabe
told delegates at his  Zimbabwe  African National Union-Patriotic
Front party’s annual congress today in Bulawayo, Zimbabwe’s
second-biggest city.  Mugabe, 87, told party members to prepare for elections in
2012, saying the power-sharing government wasn’t “democratic.”  In a speech that lasted almost two hours, Mugabe repeated
that Zimbabwe would not back down on a law that forces foreign
and white-owned companies to cede or sell 51 percent of their
shares to black Zimbabweans.  “We no longer accept that these big mining firms continue
to exercise their ownership over us, we no longer accept that
our people are just workers in these multinational companies,”
said Mugabe, adding that the law won’t be reversed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
