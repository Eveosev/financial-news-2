France Telecom SA (FTE) ,  France ’s largest
phone company, lost an appeal at the European Union’s highest
court against an EU order that forced it to pay about 1.02
billion euros ($1.37 billion) in back taxes to the French
government.  The EU regulator’s “decision finding that that aid existed
and ordering its recovery is valid,” the  EU Court of Justice  in
Luxembourg said in a ruling today. It upheld a lower EU court’s
ruling in 2009 “that the special tax regime to which France
Telecom was subject constituted state aid.”  The European Commission, which checks whether government
aid distorts competition, had probed France’s support for the
phone company when it was close to bankruptcy in 2002. It
decided that  France Telecom  received improper tax benefits from
1994 through 2004. A lower EU court in 2009 sided with the
regulator.  The Brussels-based commission won a separate case at the EU
high court in 2007 over France’s failure to recoup the tax
breaks. The court in that case rejected France’s arguments that
the commission should have given a more precise figure when it
ruled in 2004 that France Telecom must pay back as much as 1.1
billion euros, plus interest.  France Telecom fell as much as 0.9 percent and traded at
12.54 euros in Paris trading at 1:26 p.m.  ‘No Financial Consequences’  “We take note of the decision, which has no financial
consequences for the group because the full amount was paid to
the French state at the beginning of 2010,” Sebastien Audra, a
Paris-based spokesman for France Telecom, said by phone today.  The commission’s probe focused on the French state’s role
in supporting France Telecom at the end of 2002. When the
commission started investigating whether the promise of loans to
France Telecom constituted state aid, it also opened a probe
into whether the company benefited from unfair tax breaks.  The tax system dates back to a French law from 1990 when
the company, which was formerly part of a government department,
was set up.  Mario Monti , EU antitrust commissioner at the time, said in
2004 that the estimate of 800 million euros to 1.1 billion euros
in back taxes will probably rise to between 1.2 billion euros
and 1.7 billion euros once interest is added.  The case is: C-81/10 P, France Telecom v. European
Commission.  To contact the reporter on this story:
