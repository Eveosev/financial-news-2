Jean-Claude Trichet , the former
president of the  European Central Bank , said Europeans demand
that their currency is a stable one.  “It’s a currency whose stability is insisted on by all our
citizens,” Trichet said today in Marseille after accepting an
award for his work from the European People’s Party.  Trichet, who retired from his role as president of the
Frankfurt-based central bank on Oct. 31, said he wouldn’t give
advice to the ECB Governing Council or new president Mario Draghi on how to cope with the euro area’s sovereign debt
crisis. After the ceremony, Trichet grew impatient waiting for a
taxi and said he would take the metro to Mareille’s Saint
Charles train station.  To contact the reporters on this story:
