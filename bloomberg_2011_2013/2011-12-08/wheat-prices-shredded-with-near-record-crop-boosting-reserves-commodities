The biggest slump in wheat prices in
three years may have further to go as expanding harvests from
Russia to Canada bolster inventories to the most in a decade.  The  U.S. Department of Agriculture  will predict tomorrow a
3.4 percent gain in stockpiles to 202.89 million metric tons by
June, according to the average of 16 analyst estimates compiled
by Bloomberg. Prices that fell 35 percent from a 29-month high
of $9.1675 a bushel in February will drop 11 percent more to
$5.30 in the next 12 months, Credit Suisse Group AG forecasts.  Global food costs tracked by the  United Nations  have
declined 9.6 percent from a record in February, helping to
contain inflation as economic growth slows. Corn and soybeans
are also tumbling after farmers responded to record-high prices
by planting more crops. Combined output of wheat, corn and soy
will jump 3.4 percent to a record 1.8 billion tons this season,
32 percent more than a decade ago, the USDA said last month.  “Every country that can plant more corn and wheat has done
so,” said Alex Bos, the manager of agricultural commodities at
Macquarie Group Ltd. in  New York . “It’s an incredible shift,
and there’s still spare farmland capacity that can be put into
production.”  Wheat has fallen 25 percent to $5.97 on the Chicago Board
of Trade this year, heading for the biggest annual drop since
2008. It is the fifth-worst performer in the Standard & Poor’s
GSCI gauge of 24 commodities behind cotton, cocoa, sugar and
nickel. The index has risen 2.2 percent as the MSCI All-Country
World Index of equities declined 9.6 percent. Treasuries have
returned 9.1 percent, a Bank of America Corp. index shows.  Money Managers  Hedge funds  and other money managers have held a net-short
position, or bets on lower prices, in wheat since September,
with a record bearish holding of 50,582 contracts on Nov. 22,
data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission show. The
most widely held option gives holders the right to sell wheat at
$6 by the end of February, according to CBOT data.  Global wheat production will advance 5.3 percent to 683.3
million tons in the 12 months ending May 31, according to the
USDA, which releases its new estimates at 8:30 a.m. in
 Washington  tomorrow. Rabobank said  production  will rise to 685
million tons, topping the record of 684.3 million in 2010.
Demand will expand 3.3 percent to 673.3 million tons. The USDA
will probably increase its inventory estimate by 290,000 tons,
the Bloomberg survey showed.  The department also will raise its estimate of the global
soybean inventory by 0.9 percent to 64.15 million tons and its
corn stockpiles prediction by 0.5 percent to 122.13 million
tons, the survey showed.  Eight Commodities  Soybeans have fallen 19 percent to $11.325 a bushel this
year on the CBOT as corn retreated 4.6 percent to $6.0025 a
bushel.  The S&P GSCI  Agriculture  Index of eight commodities has
dropped 19 percent. Corn may decline 10 percent to $5.40 in the
next 12 months, Credit Suisse analysts led by  Tobias Merath 
wrote in a Dec. 6 report.  Investors may be skeptical about the USDA’s figures. It
reduced the corn-crop estimates in 2010 and 2011 by the most for
any two-year period since 1984, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
The estimates changed as rain delayed planting and hot, dry
weather disrupted the growing season in the U.S. Midwest. The
USDA cut its forecast four times in as many months this year,
leading critics such as Darrel Good, an agricultural economist
at the  University of Illinois , to question their reliability.  Record High  In June, at the start of the hottest Midwest summer in 50
years, corn futures for July delivery touched a record $7.9975
in  Chicago . The grain then tumbled 17 percent that month as the
government said U.S. farmers planted more than analysts were
expecting and June 1 stockpiles were 12 percent larger than
anticipated.  Even after this year’s declines, grain prices remain costly
historically. Wheat has averaged $7.30 this year, about 58
percent more than the 10-year average. Corn averaged $6.83, the
most in records going back to 1958. While the UN’s food index
has declined for five consecutive months, the gauge is still 48
percent above its average over the past decade.  Speculators are anticipating further declines. They turned
 bearish  on soybean prices at the end of November for the first
time since June 2010, CFTC data show. Money managers pared their
net-long position in corn to 141,017 futures and options in the
week ended Nov. 29, from as many as 408,854 contracts in
January, the data show.  Supply Surge  Surging global grain output is compensating for a decline
in the U.S., the world’s biggest agricultural exporter. Farmers
will reap a smaller wheat crop for a third consecutive year in
2012, and less corn for a second year, the USDA estimates. The
nation’s wheat exports are down 22 percent from a year earlier
at 18.1 million tons, a sign that this year’s record farm income
of $100.9 billion predicted by the USDA may not be repeated next
year.  “In the past, basically the U.S. has totally dominated the
world export market, but we’re starting to see increased
competition,” said  Shawn McCambridge , a senior grain analyst
for Jefferies Bache Commodities LLC in Chicago.  Nations that were absent from the export market for almost
a year have now returned, ensuring global grain supply keeps
expanding even as U.S. shipments contract.  Russia  lifted an
almost yearlong export ban in July as its crop recovered from
the drought that had decimated it a year earlier. Exports may
double in the next 15 years, Russian Deputy Agriculture Minister
Alexander Solovyev said Dec. 7.  Ukraine, Canada  Ukraine also eased export quotas and its cargoes will
almost double in the year to June, the USDA predicts. Kazakhstan
will ship 8.5 million tons of wheat this season, almost 3
million tons more, the department forecasts. Canadian sales will
advance 9.1 percent to 18 million tons.  India , the world’s second-biggest wheat consumer, will be a
net exporter this year for the first time since 2009, according
to the USDA. On Dec. 6,  Australia  boosted its crop estimate to a
record 28.3 million tons, while  Canada  said its harvest was 9
percent larger than last year.  “High prices have brought on a dramatic increase in global
grain production,” said David Smoldt, the  West Des Moines ,
Iowa-based vice president of operations at INTL FCStone Inc., a
trader and adviser to commodity producers and consumers.
