Gasoline shipments to the U.S. from
 Europe  are set to gain 4 percent over the next two weeks as
the surplus of available tankers may narrow, a survey showed.  Twenty-six tankers were booked or due to be chartered for
loading to Dec. 22, according to the median estimate in a
Bloomberg News survey yesterday of four shipbrokers, two traders
and one owner, all of whom specialize in shipping gasoline.
That’s one more cargo hired than for the two weeks to Dec. 15,
according to the survey data.  Higher prices and a weaker economy have slowed gasoline
demand in the U.S.,  Barclays Capital  said yesterday. Gasoline
futures traded on the Nymex in  New York  have climbed 6.1 percent
this year. Some refineries are set to close early next year on
the U.S. East Coast, boosting imports, Barclays said.  There are 20 vessels likely to be available to carry
gasoline across the Atlantic Ocean, six less than for the prior
two-week period, the survey showed.  Daily rental income  for
tankers on the voyage gained 13 percent to $10,312 yesterday as
charter rates advanced 3.5 percent to 170.63 Worldscale points,
according to the Baltic Exchange in London  Of the vessels chartered or due to be hired, 15 have been
booked and 11 more will probably be arranged, the survey showed.
The ships, known in the industry as medium-range tankers, will
be able to carry about 8.18 million barrels of gasoline, or
584,000 barrels a day over the next two weeks. That’s 71 percent
of the 819,000 barrels the U.S.  imported  daily over the past
year, according to the  Department of Energy .  The survey is based on so-called single-voyage, or spot,
charters and excludes loadings under longer-term contracts. It
assumes shipments to the U.S. East Coast from northwestern
Europe. Each  tanker  would normally haul about 37,000 tons of
cargo, or 315,000 barrels.  To contact the reporter on this story:
