The  Democratic Republic  of Congo’s
main opposition party rejected the results of the country’s
presidential elections and urged its supporters to demonstrate
over the outcome.  “The results are illegal and based on fraud and cheating,”
Jacquemain Shabani, head of the Union for Democracy and Social
Progress, told reporters today in Kinshasa, the capital. The
Congolese people have a right to protest and “they don’t need to
wait for our order,” he said.  Congo’s electoral commission said in an e-mailed statement
today that results of the Nov. 28 vote, in which incumbent
President  Joseph Kabila  faced 10 challengers, will be announced
tonight. Kabila leads his main rival, Etienne Tshisekedi, 49
percent to 33 percent with 89 percent of polling stations
reporting, the commission said on Dec. 6.  Congo is Africa’s second-largest copper producer and has
about 30 percent of the world’s cobalt deposits, as well as
reserves of diamonds, gold, and tin ore.  To contact the reporter on this story:
