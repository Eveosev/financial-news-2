Carrefour SA (CA) , Europe’s largest
retailer, said it’s in talks on a possible combination with
 Guyenne et Gascogne SA (GG) , its main French franchiser.  Negotiations are being held with Guyenne and “certain of
its shareholders,” though no final decision has been taken,
Boulogne-Billancourt, France-based Carrefour said today in a
statement.  The Beau family, which holds 21.3 percent of Guyenne and
33.1 percent of the voting rights, wants to sell its stake, Le
Figaro reported yesterday. Four funds, which together hold about
40 percent of Guyenne, threatened to partner with rival Auchan
if Carrefour doesn’t buy their holding, another newspaper,  Les
Echos , said today.  Guyenne shares rose as much 4.6 percent to 88.90 euros in
Paris and traded at 88 euros as of 10:05 a.m., valuing the
company at 585.1 million euros ($785 million). Carrefour rose
0.3 percent.  Guyenne operates six Carrefour hypermarkets and 27
Carrefour Market supermarkets in southwestern  France , its
website shows. It also holds 50 percent of a joint venture with
the retailer that owns 13 Carrefour hypermarkets in France as
well as having a stake in Carrefour’s Spanish business.  To contact the reporters on this story:
