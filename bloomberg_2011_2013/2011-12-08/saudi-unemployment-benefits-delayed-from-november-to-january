Saudi Arabia , which announced it
would begin to pay unemployment benefit for the first time
starting in November, has delayed payments until Jan. 1,
according to a statement on the Ministry of Labor website.  The benefits will be paid for 12 months to Saudi nationals
between 20 and 35 years old, the Ministry said.  The largest Arab economy will seek to encourage the hiring
of more Saudi nationals starting next year and reduce the
 unemployment rate  which reached 10.8 percent in July.
Demonstrations in the Middle East and North Africa have partly
stemmed from rising unemployment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
