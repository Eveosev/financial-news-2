Pinnacle Airlines Corp. (PNCL) , an operator
of regional flights for larger carriers, fell the most in almost
three years after saying it will seek to renegotiate debt
agreements, flying contracts and union accords to cut costs.  The shares tumbled 23 percent, the biggest daily decline
since February 2009, to $1.48 at 3:59 p.m. in New York. They
have dropped 81 percent this year.  The airline has begun a “comprehensive program” to boost
liquidity, which also calls for reworking terms with lessors and
vendors and shuffling management, according to a statement
today. Pinnacle said it hired Seabury Group LLC’s consulting
division,  Barclays Capital  and  Davis Polk & Wardwell  LLP as
advisers.  “Pinnacle Airlines Corp. is facing a convergence of events
that, if left unaddressed, will make 2012 an extremely
challenging year,” Chief Executive Officer Sean Menke said in
the statement.  Delta Air Lines Inc. (DAL)  was Memphis, Tennessee-based
Pinnacle’s biggest airline partners in 2010, followed by  United
Continental Holdings Inc. (UAL)  predecessor United Airlines, the
company said in its annual report.  Pinnacle has reported losses in each of the past four
quarters, and analysts surveyed by Bloomberg project that losses
will continue for two more quarters.  To contact the reporter on this story:
