Sudan’s parliament approved an
amendment to a law to give the  Finance Ministry  the right to
take over a percentage of South Sudan’s oil or any other company
that refuses to pay transportation fees, SUNA reported.  “We will take our share from July until now,” the state-
owned  news agency  cited Ahmed Ibrahim al-Taher, head of Sudan’s
National Assembly, as saying.  The law will apply to South Sudan and any other country
that wants to “abuse Sudan’s infrastructure,” the Khartoum-
based agency cited Justice Minister Mohamed Bushara Dosa as
saying.  South Sudan seceded from Sudan on July 9 following a peace
agreement in 2005 that ended a two-decade war between the north
and south. South Sudan’s oil shipments are still shipped through
northern pipelines to  Port Sudan  on the Red Sea.  To contact the reporter on this story:
