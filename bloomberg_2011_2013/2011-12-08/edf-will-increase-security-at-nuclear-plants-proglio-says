Electricite de France,  Europe ’s
biggest power generator, will heighten security at nuclear sites
“quickly” after Greenpeace acivitists broke into two plants
this week, Chief Executive Officer  Henri Proglio  said.  “These were irresponsible acts that should be punished,”
Proglio told reporters today in Belfort in eastern France. “We
will reinforce our security systems so that this type of action
will become much more difficult to carry out.”  Greenpeace campaigners broke into two plants on Dec. 5 to
highlight what the environmental group said was a lack of
security.  The French government and EDF have announced investigations
into how the activists were able to penetrate the grounds of the
Nogent-sur-Seine plant southeast of Paris and the Cruas
installation in the south. EDF operates 58 reactors in  France 
from which more than three-quarters of the country’s power needs
are met.  “No sensitive zones were impacted,” Proglio said. “We
have already started analyzing the reasons why this happened and
what will be done so it doesn’t happen again.”  New security measures will be put in place “quickly,” he
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
