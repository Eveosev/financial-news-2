Cyprus will make cuts in public
spending worth 923 million euros ($1.2 billion) over three years
if the budget is approved by lawmakers on Dec. 15, said
government spokesman  Stefanos Stefanou .  Revenue will increase by 249 million euros next year and
spending will be cut by 461 million euros, narrowing its deficit
by 710 million euros, Stefanou said in an e-mailed statement.
Spending will be cut by 158 million euros in 2013 and by 2014
revenue will rise by 264 million euros while spending will be
reduced by 659 million euros.  The east Mediterranean island aims at reducing the fiscal
deficit to 2.5 percent of gross domestic product next year from
“around 6 percent” this year, Stefanou said. The budget gap
will narrow to 0.5 percent of GDP in 2013 and will be eliminated
in 2014, he said. The budget cuts are aimed at preventing the
euro area’s third smallest economy from resorting to an
international bailout.  “The challenges our banking system faces because of the
negative developments in the Greek economy are expected to
affect growth,” the island’s finance minister Kikis Kazamias
told lawmakers today, according to an e-mailed transcript of his
budget speech. “Following the writedowns in Greek debts,
Cypriot banks will throw less liquidity to the market in an
attempt to maintain adequate capital.”  The Cypriot economy will grow 0.2 percent next year, he
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
