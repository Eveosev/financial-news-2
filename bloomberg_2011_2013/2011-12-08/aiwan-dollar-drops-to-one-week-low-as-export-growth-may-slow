Taiwan ’s dollar fell to a one-week
low before a finance ministry report that showed export growth
cooled the most since 2009. Bonds were steady.  Overseas shipments rose 1.3 percent in November from a year
earlier, compared with an 11.7 percent gain the previous month,
the government reported before the market closed. The median
estimate of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News was for an 8.6
percent gain. Taiwan’s currency has lost 4.6 percent this half
as Europe’s worsening debt crisis sapped export demand.  “The global economy is not stable,” said  Henry Lin , a
Taipei-based foreign-exchange trader at Taiwan Shin Kong
Commercial Bank. “Exports will slow down. Investors want to
hold the  U.S. dollar , which has more liquidity.”  Taiwan’s dollar closed 0.04 percent lower at NT$30.179
against its U.S. counterpart, according to Taipei Forex Inc. The
currency touched NT$30.239 earlier, the weakest level since Dec.
1. It may decline to NT$30.50 by year-end, Lin said.  Machinery orders in Japan, Taiwan’s fourth-largest export
market, fell 6.9 percent in October from September, data showed
today. That compared with the median forecast for a 0.5 percent
gain in a Bloomberg News survey of economists.  Government bonds  were little changed. The yield on the 2
percent bonds due July 2016 was 0.993 percent, compared with
0.992 percent yesterday, according to Gretai Securities Market.  To contact the reporter on this story:
