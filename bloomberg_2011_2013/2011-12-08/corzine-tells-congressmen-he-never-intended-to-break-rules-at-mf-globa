Jon S. Corzine told lawmakers that he
never intended to break any rules in his role as chairman and
chief executive officer at MF Global Holdings Ltd., the New York
brokerage that sought bankruptcy protection on Oct. 31.  “I’m not in a position -- given the number of transactions
-- to know anything specifically about the movement of any
specific funds,” Corzine said today at a House Agriculture
Committee hearing in  Washington . “I certainly would never
intend to direct” misuse of segregated client funds, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
