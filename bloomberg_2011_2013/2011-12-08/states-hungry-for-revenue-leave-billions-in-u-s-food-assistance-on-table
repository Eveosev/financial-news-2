A $231 million increase in the
forecast for fourth-quarter  tax revenue  will allow the state to
restore planned cuts to public schools,  Colorado  Governor John Hickenlooper’s budget director said today.  The gains in income, sales and use taxes will help
officials plug gaps in funding for the 2012 and 2013 fiscal
years, said Henry Sobanet, director of the Governor’s Office of
State Planning and Budgeting at a presentation to the
legislature’s  Joint Budget Committee .  “We’re seeing a lot of activity that simply was not evident
during the summer, when there was a lot of turbulence and
uncertainty,” Sobanet told the committee. “Now we’re seeing
stronger employment and business activity.”  Sobanet said his office is preparing a supplemental budget
request for fiscal 2012 that will ask for $22 million to
accommodate increasing enrollment in public schools.  Gains in job growth and income tax revenues will allow the
Governor to withdraw a $30-million reduction he proposed to
higher-education funding for the 2013 fiscal year, Sobanet
added.  Hickenlooper will also restore $67 million in funding in
fiscal 2013 for public education, Sobanet said.  “The cuts to K-12 education in next year’s budget were the
last and hardest to make,” Hickenlooper said in a statement.
“That’s why we want those cuts to be the first restored.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
