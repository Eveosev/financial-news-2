Oesterreichische Volksbanken AG (VBPS) ’s
shortfall to meet additional  capital requirements  set by
European Union regulators widened to 1.05 billion euros in the
three months ended Sept. 30, it said today.  The gap determined by the European Banking Authority
compares to 972 million euros as of June 30, Volksbanken said in
a statement. The EBA said Oct. 26 that Volksbanken’s shortfall
“should be considered as pro-forma” because the lender is
“under deep restructuring.”  Volksbanken missed EBA’s stress test in July already and
has since abandoned plans to repay state aid and is planning a
cross-guarantee alliance with regional banks. It expects a full-
year loss of at least 825 million euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
