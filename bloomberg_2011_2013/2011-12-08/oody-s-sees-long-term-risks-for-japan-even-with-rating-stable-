Moody’s Investors Service said  Japan 
may face “long-term key challenges” to its  credit rating ,
already lowered in August because of a swelling debt load.  Japan’s ability to finance its debt at low cost remains
strong, Moody’s said in a statement today, adding that the
outlook for the nation’s Aa3 rating is stable. At the same time,
frequent changes in leadership have weakened the government’s
ability to improve its finances and the March 11 earthquake has
weighed on growth, it said.  “The effectiveness and credibility of fiscal policy,
especially in articulating long-term targets, have suffered
since the end of the administration of  Junichiro Koizumi ,” who
stepped down in 2006, Moody’s said. Japan has had six prime
ministers in the past five years.  Domestic savings, low exposure to non-resident investors
for financing government debt and a current-account surplus are
among factors that have supported the government’s funding
capabilities, according to Moody’s.  To contact the reporter on this story:
