New York  lawmakers approved Governor
 Andrew Cuomo ’s plan to overhaul the state tax code by raising
rates on the wealthiest residents and cutting them for millions
of married couples earning less than $300,000 a year.  The measure passed the Assembly early today after winning
Senate approval yesterday. The deal was announced Dec. 6 in a
joint statement by Cuomo, Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, a
Democrat, and Senate Majority Leader  Dean Skelos , a Republican.  Cuomo, 54, had vowed not to raise levies, and his
opposition to extending a so-called millionaire’s tax --
actually a surcharge on income above $200,000 for individual
filers -- drew criticism from fellow Democrats, unions and the
Occupy Wall Street protest movement. The governor changed his
stance after a midyear report showed a budget deficit of 
$350 million this year and a $3.5 billion gap in the fiscal year
beginning April 1.  “This is a different economic reality than anyone could
have anticipated,” Cuomo said during a press conference in
 Albany  last night after the Senate approved the tax plan. “For
this new reality that we’re facing, this is the best decision.”  The plan will raise about $1.9 billion in new revenue, less
than the $4 billion generated by the millionaire’s tax, which
expires Dec. 31. About $400 million will be spent on flood
recovery and a youth-employment program, and the remaining $1.5
billion will be put toward the deficit, said Morris Peters, a
Budget Division spokesman.  Legislative Victories  The votes signaled yet another legislative victory for
Cuomo, who took office in January. During the session that ended
in June, he pushed through an on-time budget that closed a $10
billion gap, an ethics package, a property-tax cap and a bill to
permit same-sex marriage in the third-most-populous U.S. state.  Last week, the governor said revenue is “collapsing” amid
shrinking Wall Street bonuses and job cuts in the finance
industry, which accounted for more than 20 percent of wages paid
by businesses in 2010.  New York  is one of four states, along
with California, Missouri and  Washington , to report midyear
budget deficits, according to the Denver-based  National
Conference of State Legislatures .  Without the expiring surcharge, individuals who earn
$21,000 are taxed at 6.85 percent, the same as someone who makes
$21 million. The plan creates new income brackets. The first,
from $40,000 to $150,000 for joint filers, will be taxed at 6.45
percent. Those who earn $150,000 to $300,000 will have a 6.65
percent rate, while there will be no change for those making
$300,000 to $2 million.  Top Bracket  The tax on the top bracket, $2 million or more for couples,
will rise to 8.82 percent and expire in December 2014. For
individual filers, the top rate will start at $1 million.  Including the surcharge, those earning more than $500,000
had been taxed at 8.97 percent. New York’s new top rate is lower
than the 8.97 percent levy in  New Jersey , though higher than the
6.7 percent rate in  Connecticut .  “New York has left the middle class with an undue burden
which also hinders economic recovery,” Cuomo said in a Dec. 5
statement. “Fairness dictates that the more you make, the more
you pay and the higher your income, the higher your rate.”  Also under the plan, employers in the 12 counties
surrounding  New York City  will see a cut in the portion of their
payroll taxes used to support the  Metropolitan Transportation
Authority .  To contact the reporter on this story:
