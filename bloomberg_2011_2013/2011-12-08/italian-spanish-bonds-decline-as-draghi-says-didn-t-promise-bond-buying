Italian and Spanish bonds declined
after European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  said he did
not necessarily signal the ECB would step up government bond
purchases last week when speaking before lawmakers in Brussels.  The yield on  10-year Italian bonds  climbed 28 basis points
to 6.28 percent at 2:27 p.m. London time.  Spain ’s 10-year bonds
advanced 23 basis points to 5.66 percent.  Draghi told reporters in Frankfurt today he was “kind of
surprised by the implicit meaning” that was given to his
comments last week when he said the ECB could follow faster
fiscal union with “other elements.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
