Farmers in  France , the European
Union’s largest grain producer, are expected to boost planting
of winter soft wheat for next year’s harvest by 1.2 percent to
match the record area in 2008, the  Agriculture Ministry  said.  The grain will be sown on 5.06 million hectares (12.5
million acres) from 5 million acres this year, the ministry
said in a  report  on its website today. Planting of durum wheat,
winter barley and winter rapeseed is also forecast to climb.  Milling wheat for delivery in November next year, after
the 2012 harvest, was at 175 euros ($233.87) a metric ton at
4:02 p.m. in Paris. The average cost to produce a ton of wheat
in France next year is estimated at 140 to 145 euros, based on
average yields, according to Alexandre Marie, an analyst at
Bourges, France-based farm adviser Offre et  Demande Agricole .  “Wheat is at a high level, rapeseed slightly expands,
barley stabilizes,” the ministry said. “The sowing, at a high
level, didn’t encounter any major difficulties.”  Winter wheat typically accounts for more than 99 percent
of production in France, the EU’s largest grower of
the grain. Planting was 98 percent completed as of Dec. 1,
according to the ministry.  Soft Wheat  The ministry put the 2011 soft-wheat crop at 34 million
tons, falling 4.6 percent from the previous year after a spring
drought cut yields by 6.2 percent to 6.79 tons per hectare.  French wheat production costs averaged about 143 euros per
ton this year, hurt by low yields, and would have been between
125 and 130 euros based on normal yields, Marie said. Rising
fertilizer prices are adding to costs for next year, he said.  Winter rapeseed is estimated to cover 1.58 million
hectares, climbing 1.6 percent from this year, according to the
ministry. Planting was 99 percent done, the report showed.  Sowing of winter-barley is expected to advance to 1.07
million hectares, rising 0.8 percent from this year and 11
percent below the five-year average. The crop was 99 percent
planted, the ministry said.  Durum-wheat sowing will rise 3.3 percent to 425,000 tons,
with 92 percent planted as of Dec. 1, the report showed.  The government estimates for winter barley and durum wheat
planting are too low, Marie said, citing comments from about
1,000 farmers surveyed by Offre et Demande. The analyst
forecasts winter-barley planting will increase 8 percent to 12
percent and the durum area will rise about 8 percent.  France’s corn crop will climb 10 percent to 15.4 million
tons, the ministry said, unchanged from a November forecast.  To contact the reporter on this story:
