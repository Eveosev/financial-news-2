Poland’s  WIG20 Index (WIG20)  declined 1.9
percent to 2,211.83 at 5:30 p.m. close in Warsaw, having earlier
risen as much as 0.9 percent.  The following are among the most active stocks on the
Warsaw Stock Exchange today. Stock symbols follow company names.  PKO Bank Polski SA (PKO)  , the country’s biggest lender,
lost 3.2 percent to 33.11 zloty and  Bank Pekao SA (PEO)  ,
majority-owned by UniCredit SpA, declined 2.7 percent to 144
zloty.  PZU SA (PZU)  , the country’s biggest insurer, slid 4.5
percent to 311 zloty.  Financial shares fell after European Central Bank President
 Mario Draghi  said he didn’t signal plans to purchase more bonds
last week.  Central European Distribution Corp. (CDC)  , the vodka
producer that owns Zubrowka and Parliament brands, rallied 19
percent to 19.8 zloty, the highest close in six weeks, after
largest shareholder Russian Standard Corp. proposed a plan to
cut the company’s debt and buy more shares.  Jefferies Group Inc. upgraded the stock to “buy” from
“underperform,” saying Russian Standard’s involvement is
“game-changing” for CEDC and that some form of an agreement
will probably be reached between the companies.  PKN Orlen SA (PKN)  , Poland’s biggest oil company, fell
2.6 percent to 37.99 zloty.  Grupa Lotos SA (LTS)  , the second-
largest refiner, dropped 1.6 to 24.6 zloty as crude oil fell.  To contact the reporters on this story:
