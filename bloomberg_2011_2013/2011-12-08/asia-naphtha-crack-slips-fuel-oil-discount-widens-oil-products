Asia ’s naphtha crack spread narrowed.
 Fuel oil ’s discount to crude widened, signaling refiners’ losses
from turning oil into residual products are growing.  Light Distillates  Naphtha’s premium to London-traded Brent crude futures fell
to $75 a ton from $85 a ton at the end of Asian trading
yesterday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Japan ’s open-specification naphtha forward contracts for
second-half January delivery were bid at $909 a ton against
offers at $912, based on data from Ginga Petroleum Singapore Pte,
a broker. The petrochemical feedstock closed yesterday at
$919.75. Prices have gained for eight days, the longest rising
streak since April.  Gasoline’s premium to naphtha yesterday dropped to $12 a
barrel, the lowest since May 27, Bloomberg data showed. A
narrower  reforming margin  indicates it is less profitable to
produce motor fuel.  Middle Distillates  The  premium  of gasoil, or diesel, to Asian marker Dubai
crude fell 37 cents to $18.58 a barrel, according to PVM Oil
Associates Ltd., a broker. This crack spread narrowed for the
third time in four days.  Gasoil  swaps for January dropped $1.35, or 1.1 percent, to
$125.10 a barrel, PVM said. That’s the largest decline since Nov.
21. Jet fuel’s premium to gasoil lost 15 cents to 95 cents, the
lowest so far this month. A narrower  regrade  shows it is less
profitable to make  aviation fuel  over diesel.  Fuel Oil  Fuel oil’s  discount  to Dubai crude widened 14 cents to
$6.14 a barrel, according to PVM. That’s the biggest gap since
Sept. 14.  January  high-sulfur fuel oil  swaps decreased $7.25, or 1.1
percent, to $652.50 a ton, based on PVM data. Prices are the
lowest since Nov. 22. The premium of 180-centistoke fuel oil to
380-centistoke grade, or the  viscosity spread , was unchanged
after climbing to $14.25. This means bunker, or marine fuel,
moved in tandem with higher-quality fuel oil.  To contact the reporter on this story:
