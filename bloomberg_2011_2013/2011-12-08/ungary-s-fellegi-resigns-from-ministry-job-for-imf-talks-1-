Hungarian Development Minister Tamas Fellegi will offer to resign to focus on the country’s talks
with the  International Monetary Fund , which are set to formally
begin in January.  “I can’t continue leading the ministry and also head the
negotiations at the same time,” Fellegi told reporters in
Budapest today.  Prime Minister  Viktor Orban  is still to decide whether to
accept Fellegi’s resignation and his possible successor,
Government Spokesman Andras Giro-Szasz told the same news
conference.  Hungary, the European Union’s most indebted eastern member,
last month reversed more than a year of shunning further aid to
ask for assistance from the IMF after the forint fell to a
record low against the euro.  Christoph Rosenberg from the IMF and Barbara Kauffmann from
the European Union will travel to Budapest next week to start
“informal” talks before the formal negotiations, Fellegi said.  Fellegi also plans to meet representatives of credit rating
companies and investors in  London , he said. He can’t comment on
the government’s strategy for the talks before they begin, he
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
