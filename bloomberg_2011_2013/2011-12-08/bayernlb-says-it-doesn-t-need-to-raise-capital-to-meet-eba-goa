Bayerische Landesbank , the second-
biggest German state-owned lender, said it doesn’t need to raise
additional capital to meet new rules set by the European Banking
Authority to withstand losses on euro-area sovereign debt.
BayernLB’s core tier 1 ratio stood at 10 percent in the EBA’s
stress scenario, the Munich-based lender said in a statement on
its website today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
