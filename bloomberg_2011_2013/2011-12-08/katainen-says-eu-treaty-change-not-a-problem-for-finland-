Finnish Prime Minister  Jyrki Katainen 
said amending European Union treaties wouldn’t be a problem for
his country, though he stressed that this isn’t the only way to
reach the goal of stricter fiscal rules.  “We are in favor of stricter rules, but treaty change is
not the only way to get the stricter rules,” Katainen told
reporters before a European Union summit in Brussels today.
“Hopefully we can achieve a good solution. If there’s a
necessity to change the treaty we are in favor of it, it’s not a
problem for  Finland .”  Markets are “more interested in the firepower of
mechanisms” and especially the role of the  International
Monetary Fund  in a crisis solution, he said.  The summit “will be very, very tough,” he said. “I don’t
know how long it will take.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
