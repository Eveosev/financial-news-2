Luxembourg Prime Minister  Jean-Claude Juncker , who leads the group of euro-area finance ministers,
said he won’t oppose a change to the euro-region treaty, as long
as it is done “fast and well,” the  Sueddeutsche Zeitung 
reported, citing an interview.  He said any change will have to be “limited” so that it
doesn’t result in a long debate and ratification process, the
newspaper said, according to an e-mailed preview of an article
to appear in today’s edition.  To contact the reporter on this story:
