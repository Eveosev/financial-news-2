Copper may drop for a third day on
concern that European leaders meeting today may fail to outline
steps to contain the region’s debt crisis and as economic growth
slows in  China , the largest consumer.  Three-month delivery copper swung between gains and losses
before trading little changed at $7,820.50 a metric ton on the
London Metal Exchange at 3:15 p.m. Shanghai time. Copper for
February delivery on the Shanghai Futures Exchange closed 0.9
percent lower at 57,860 yuan ($9,094) a ton.  The European leaders will convene in Brussels for talks to
frame the fifth “comprehensive” solution in 19 months to a
debt crisis that’s left Germany and  France  facing the threat of
losing their AAA rating from  Standard & Poor’s . European Central
Bank policy makers are expected to cut the benchmark  interest
rate  by a quarter percentage point to 1 percent in their meeting
in  Frankfurt  today, according to 53 of 58 economists in a
Bloomberg News survey.  “Investors are cautious ahead of the European leaders’
meeting and the ECB decision,” said Xu Liping, an analyst at
HNA Topwin Futures Co. “There are also uncertainties in terms
of China’s macro policies ahead of the annual central economic
meeting.”  The central economic meeting, which is usually held in
December every year, sets the tone for China’s macro-economic
policies for next year. The statistics bureau will release key
economic data for November tomorrow. Industrial output may have
increased 12.6 percent last month, the slowest pace since August
2009, according to the median forecast of economists surveyed by
Bloomberg.  On the LME, aluminum rose 0.5 percent to $2,087.50 a ton,
zinc gained 0.3 percent to $2,032 a ton, and nickel added 0.5
percent to $18,134 a ton. Lead fell 0.7 percent to $2,133.75 a
ton, and tin dropped 0.5 percent to $20,400 a ton.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
