Three-time National League Most
Valuable Player  Albert Pujols  agreed on a 10-year contract worth
between $250 million and $260 million with the Los Angeles
Angels, who also came to terms with All-Star pitcher C.J. Wilson, according to media reports.  Pujols turned down offers to return to the St. Louis
Cardinals or sign with the Miami Marlins by choosing a move to
the  American League , Yahoo Sports reported, citing a person it
didn’t identify.  Wilson, who’s spent his seven-year Major League Baseball
career with the  Texas Rangers , will earn $75 million over five
years from the Angels, ESPN reported, citing a person it didn’t
identify. A 2011 All-Star, Wilson finished sixth in the Cy Young
Award voting for the AL’s best pitcher after going 16-7 with a
2.94 earned run average in 223.1 innings pitched.  Pujols, 31, has spent his 11-year career with the
Cardinals, helping them win two  World Series  championships,
including this year. The first baseman has a career .328 batting
average with 445 home runs.  He and Wilson join a team that has made the playoffs six
times in the past 10 years, winning the World Series in 2002.
Arturo Moreno, who once was a co-owner of the advertising
company Outdoor Systems Inc., bought the Angels from the Walt
Disney Co. in 2003 for about $180 million, which would be $70
million to $80 million less than what the team has committed to
Pujols, according to the Yahoo Sports report.  The Angels may be expecting more revenue from a new
television agreement. In an October court filing on behalf of
 Major League Baseball  related to the bankruptcy case of the  Los
Angeles Dodgers , television consultant Ed Desser said the Angels
were close to a new broadcast agreement, the Los Angeles Times
reported.  TV Contract  The Angels’ current contract with News Corp.’s Fox, which
runs through 2015, pays about $50 million a season, the
newspaper said. The Rangers last year got a 20-year, $1.6
billion contract from Fox.  Pujols hit .299 with 37 homers and 99 runs batted in last
Season, when he made about $14.5 million in 2011. His average
annual salary of $25 million to $26 million would have made him
the third highest-paid player last season, behind  Alex Rodriguez 
of the  New York Yankees  ($32 million) and Vernon Wells of the
Angels ($26.2 million). The Angels’ opening day payroll of
$138.5 million ranked fourth in baseball last season.  The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported that the Cardinals’
last offer was for a 10-year, $220 million contract, with nine
years guaranteed. Pujols also negotiated with the Marlins at
baseball’s Winter Meetings this week in  Dallas .  The nine-time All-Star has finished in the top 10 of MVP
voting each of his 11 years in Major League Baseball. He has hit
32 or more home runs each season, and 2011 was the first time
that Pujols had fallen below 100 RBIs in a season.  Pujols Leadership  New Cardinals manager Mike Matheny, who replaced the
retired  Tony La Russa , said Pujols’s impact on a team goes far
beyond the hits and home runs he compiles each season.  “You start with the intangibles, the leadership and the
comfort of the guys on the team in having a stable guy who’s
done what he’s done,” Matheny told reporters at the Winter
Meetings. “And nobody else has done what he’s done in his 11
years in the league.”  Wilson, 31, reached the World Series with Texas the last
two years. He has a 43-35 career record with a 3.60 earned run
average.  To contact the reporter on this story:
