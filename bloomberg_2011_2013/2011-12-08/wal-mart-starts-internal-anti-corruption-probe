Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT) , the world’s
largest retailer, has begun an internal investigation into
whether some of its actions violated U.S. anti-corruption laws.  The company is probing permitting, licensing and
inspections of stores, according to a regulatory filing today,
and has disclosed the investigation to the U.S. Department of
Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission.  The filing didn’t say where the actions in question took
place. Wal-Mart, based in Bentonville,  Arkansas , has also hired
legal counsel and other advisers to assist in the probe, the
filing said.  “We cannot reasonably estimate the potential liability, if
any, related to these matters,” the filing said. “However,
based on the facts currently known, we do not believe that these
matters will have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.”  Wal-Mart said the investigation came out of information
gleaned earlier this year from an internal review of policies
for its global anti-corruption compliance program.  “This is consistent with our desire to be transparent to
all of our stakeholders,”  David Tovar , a Wal-Mart spokesman,
said in a telephone interview. He declined to provide further
information.  Wal-Mart fell 0.9 percent to $57.98 today in  New York . The
shares have gained 7.5 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
