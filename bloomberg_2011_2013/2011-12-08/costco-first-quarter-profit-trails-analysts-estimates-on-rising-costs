Costco Wholesale Corp. (COST)  declined after
the largest U.S. warehouse-club chain said profit margin shrank
in the first quarter because of rising costs.  Costco fell 2 percent to $85.76 in  New York . The shares
have advanced 19 percent this year.  Net income advanced to $320 million, or 73 cents a share,
in the quarter ended Nov. 20, from $312 million, or 71 cents, a
year earlier, the Issaquah, Washington-based company said today
in a statement. Profit excluding some items was 80 cents a
share, meeting the average of 19 analysts’ estimates compiled by
Bloomberg.  Costco increased all membership fees by 10 percent last
month, the first widespread boost since 2006, after rising costs
of commodities narrowed profit margin. The chain of 596 stores
has been preparing for a change in leadership as Chief Operating
Officer Craig Jelinek will become chief executive officer on
Jan. 1, replacing retiring co-founder Jim Sinegal.  “Not a high-quality quarter,”  David Strasser , an analyst
for Janney Montgomery Scott in New York, wrote today in a note
to clients. The decline in gross margin is an issue, said
Strasser, who recommends buying Costco shares.  The retailer’s in-store gross margin, or the percentage of
sales left after subtracting the cost of goods sold, narrowed to
10.62 percent from 10.97 percent a year earlier. That marked a
third-straight decline. Strasser had projected 10.69 percent.  Sales Gain 13%  Net sales gained 13 percent to $21.18 billion with
membership fees advancing 7.5 percent to $447 million. Total
revenue rose to $21.6 billion.  Costco said it took a $24 million charge in the quarter
related to the settlement of an income-tax audit of a 50
percent-owned joint venture in  Mexico . The retailer also had a
$17 million charge for contributions to a successful campaign to
reform alcoholic beverage laws in Washington state. The charges
reduced diluted earnings per share by 7 cents.  The company said it will open two more warehouses in  Japan 
by the end of 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
