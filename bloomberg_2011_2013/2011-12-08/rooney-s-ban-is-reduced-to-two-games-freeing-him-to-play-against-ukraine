Wayne Rooney ’s ban was reduced to two
games by UEFA at an appeal hearing today, making him eligible
for England’s final group match at next year’s European
Championship.  European soccer’s governing body ruled Oct. 13 the
Manchester United striker should miss three matches for his
country after being dismissed for kicking out at Montenegro’s
Miodrag Dzudovic six days earlier.  The suspension would have caused him to sit out all three
of England’s group matches at Euro 2012. Rooney won’t have to
serve the ban for the third game unless he is sent off in
another European match. The reduction means England manager
 Fabio Capello  is likely to include the striker in his squad.  Rooney will miss matches against  France  on June 11 and
Sweden four days later. He’s eligible to return for the final
group game against Ukraine on June 19.  “There was the possibility of having Wayne miss the whole
group phase, which would have been a huge challenge for Fabio
and the whole team,” England managing director Adrian Bevington
said after the three-person panel’s decision. “To have him
available in the final group game against Ukraine is obviously a
positive result for us.”  Rooney has scored 28 goals for England, more than any
player in its most recent squad. Jermain Defoe,  Darren Bent ,
 Ashley Young  and Rooney all scored three goals for England in
Euro 2012 qualifying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
