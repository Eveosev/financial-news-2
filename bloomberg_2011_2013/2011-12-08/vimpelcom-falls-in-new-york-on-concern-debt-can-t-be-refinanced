VimpelCom Ltd. (VIP)  fell the most since
September in U.S. trading on a report that Bank of America
Merrill Lynch downgraded the stock and on speculation the
European debt crisis will drive up the Russian mobile-phone
company’s financing costs.  American depositary receipts for VimpelCom dropped 5.7
percent to $10.42 in  New York , the biggest drop since Sept. 22.  VimpelCom was downgraded to “neutral” from “buy” by
Bank of America Merrill Lynch today, Theflyonthewall.com website
reported. The bank has a policy of not releasing its research
reports to the media, Rinat Rond, a spokeswoman at the bank’s
office in New York, said by phone today.  The  European Central Bank  damped speculation that it would
boost sovereign debt purchases today and regulators said that
the region’s lenders need to raise more capital than previously
estimated. The Amsterdam-based phone company has $1.42 billion
worth of debt coming due next year and in 2013, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  “Further significant deterioration on credit markets can
hurt VimpelCom a lot, because its debt is pretty high and needs
refinancing,” Victor Klimovich, an analyst in Moscow at VTB
Capital, the investment banking arm of  Russia ’s second-largest
lender, said by phone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
