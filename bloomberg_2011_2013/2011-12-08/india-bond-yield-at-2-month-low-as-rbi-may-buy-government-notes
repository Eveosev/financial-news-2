India ’s 10-year bonds gained, pushing
yields to a two-month low, on speculation the central bank will
offer to buy more securities to ease a  shortage  of cash in the
banking system.  The  Reserve Bank  of India purchased 91 billion rupees ($1.8
billion) of government debt through an auction today, according
to a statement from the monetary authority. RBI Deputy Governor
Subir Gokarn signaled yesterday that the central bank prefers to
inject funds through open-market auctions, after purchasing 152
billion rupees of notes in two operations since Nov. 24.  “Yields have eased as the RBI’s bond purchases may stoke
demand,” said R.S. Chauhan, Mumbai-based chief dealer of fixed
income and currencies at  State Bank  of Bikaner & Jaipur. “More
open-market operations may take place in coming weeks.”  The rate on the 8.79 percent bonds due November 2021 fell
seven basis points, or 0.07 percentage point, to 8.52 percent in
Mumbai, according to the central bank’s trading system. That’s
the lowest level for a benchmark 10-year note since Sept. 30,
data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Lenders borrowed 742 billion rupees on average per day from
the central bank this quarter, compared with 428 billion rupees
a day in the previous three months, official data show.  The cost of one-year interest-rate swaps, or derivative
contracts used to guard against fluctuations in borrowing costs,
fell nine basis points to 7.81 percent, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
