Petroliam Nasional Bhd. ,  Malaysia ’s
state oil company, reduced a price adjustment for its flagship
 Tapis  crude as the measure of regional demand capped a second
annual gain.  Petronas, as the Kuala Lumpur-based company is known, set
the so-called  alpha  at $7.50 a barrel for December, an official
said today, asking not to be identified because of company
policy. It was $7.60 in November.  The Tapis factor, used to reflect demand for low-sulfur or
“sweet” crude in  Asia ,  averaged  $5.90 this year, up from $3.84
in 2010 and 59 cents in 2009, as refiners’ profit from making
distillate fuels increased. Gasoil’s premium to Asian-marker
Dubai crude, or the  crack spread , averaged $18.95 a barrel so
far this year, from $11.52 in 2010, according to PVM Oil
Associates Ltd., a London-based broker.  Petronas includes the Tapis adjustment factor in its
monthly calculations of official selling prices. The formula is
tied to Brent produced in the  North Sea , a benchmark crude for
 Europe , the Mediterranean and Africa.  To contact the reporter on this story:
