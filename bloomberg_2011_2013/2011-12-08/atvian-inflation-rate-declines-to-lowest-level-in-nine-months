Latviaâ€™s inflation rate fell to the
lowest level in nine months in November as health-care costs
eased.  Consumer prices rose 4.2 percent from a year earlier, the
smallest increase since March, compared with an advance of 4.4
percent in October, the Statistics Office, based in the capital,
Riga, said today in an e-mailed statement. Prices were unchanged
from the previous month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
