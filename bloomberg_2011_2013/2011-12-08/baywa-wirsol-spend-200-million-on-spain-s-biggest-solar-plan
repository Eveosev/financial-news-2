BayWa AG , a German agricultural
products and building-materials maker, and developer  Wirsol
Solar AG  are investing 150 million euros ($200 million) in what
would become  Spain ’s biggest solar park.  The companies will start building the 70-megawatt
photovoltaic facility near Alicante, in eastern Spain, in April,
Stefan Weber, a spokesman for Wirsol, said by phone today.  Yingli Green Energy Holding Co. will likely supply the
modules for the plant that secured a feed-in-tariff of 11.71
euro cents per kilowatt-hour, Weber said. The plant will be
connected to the grid in sections starting in June, the
developer said in an e-mailed statement.  “The Alicante project has caused quite a sensation in
crisis-ridden Spain,” said Andre Oechsler, head of Wirsol’s
Spanish unit.  Spain, which installed more than 2,500 megawatts in solar
capacity in 2008, capped its yearly market to about 500
megawatts starting in 2009. The project developed by Baywa and
Wirsol underpins the interest of investors for a share of that
market even if rates were sharply reduced as of the second
quarter of this year.  The Alicante plant would be 10 megawatts larger than
Spain’s biggest solar park at Olmedilla de Alarcon and is likely
to be one of the 10 largest in  Europe  when completed in January
2013, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance data.  To contact the reporters on this story:
