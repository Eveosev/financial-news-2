Oil options volatility rose as
underlying futures declined the most in three weeks to settle
below $100 a barrel.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
January, a measure of expected swings in futures and a gauge of
options prices, increased to 36.7 at 5 p.m. in New York from 33
yesterday. Futures dropped 2.1 percent after European Central
Bank President  Mario Draghi  signaled the ECB wonâ€™t increase
government bond purchases to end the debt crisis.  The most active options contracts in electronic trading
today were January $95 puts, with 2,321 lots changing hands as
of 5:10 p.m. in New York. The options gained 51 cents to 90
cents a barrel. January $93 puts traded 2,201 lots, gaining 29
cents to 50 cents. One contract covers 1,000 barrels of crude.  Oil for January delivery fell $2.15 to settle at $98.34 a
barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . It was the biggest
decline since Nov. 17.  January $90 puts were the most active options traded in the
previous session, with 4,635 lots changing hands. They fell 1
cent to 9 cents a barrel. The next-most active options, January
$95 puts, declined 2 cents to 39 cents on volume of 4,510.  Open interest was highest for December 2012 $150 calls with
38,023 contracts. Next were December 2012 $80 puts with 35,453
contracts, and December 2012 $100 calls with 32,312.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
