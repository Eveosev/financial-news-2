Laos  agreed to delay construction of
a $3.7 billion hydropower dam on the Mekong River because of
concerns among neighboring countries that the project would
disrupt fisheries and rice production downstream.   Laos,  Cambodia ,  Vietnam  and  Thailand  will approach the
Japanese government “and other international development
partners to support the conduct of further study,” according to
a joint statement after representatives met in Siem Reap,
Cambodia today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
