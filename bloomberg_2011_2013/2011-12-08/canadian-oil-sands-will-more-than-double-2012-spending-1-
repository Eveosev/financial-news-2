Canadian Oil Sands Ltd ., the largest
partner in Syncrude  Canada  Ltd., will more than double its
 capital spending  next year to C$1.46 billion ($1.45 billion) to
help increase production as much as 9.3 percent.  Total production from Syncrude will be 106 million barrels
to 117 million barrels in 2012, Calgary-based Canadian Oil Sands
said in a statement today. That compares with a 2011 output
forecast of 105 million to 107 million barrels, which the
company reiterated two days ago.  The company owns 36.74 percent of Syncrude, which held an
estimated 4.8 billion barrels of proved and probable reserves as
of the end of last year, according to its website. Oil sands
account for about 97 percent of Canada’s reserves and were 54
percent of daily production last year, according to the  Canadian
Association of Petroleum Producers .  Canadian  Oil Sands  had planned as much as C$978 million in
2011 capital spending, Siren Fisecki, a spokeswoman, said in a
telephone interview today. It cut the budget to C$691 million in
October by deferring some work, she said.  Sales next year are expected to total C$3.684 billion,
based on oil prices of $85 a barrel, Canadian Oil Sands said.
The company was expected to have 2012 sales of C$3.832 billion,
based on the average of six  analysts’ estimates  compiled by
Bloomberg.  The company plans to maintain its dividend at the current
level and will remain unhedged, Chief Executive Officer Marcel Coutu said in the statement.  The production estimate includes a turnaround on Syncrude’s
Coker 8-3 during the first half of 2012, according to the
statement. Planned work on the Coker 8-1 may also be required
following the unit’s “recent operational interruption,”
Canadian Oil Sands said.  ‘Disappointed’ With Pace  “We are disappointed with the pace of utilization
improvement at Syncrude,” Coutu said.  Imperial Oil Ltd. (IMO) ,  Suncor Energy Inc. (SU) ,  China Petroleum &
Chemical Corp. (600028)  and  Nexen Inc. (NXY)  also own stakes in Syncrude,
according to Canadian Oil Sands.  Canadian Oil Sands  fell  0.5 percent to C$20.24 at 9:31 a.m.
in Toronto. It has fallen 23 percent this year before today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
