The European Union will import
100,000 metric tons of raw sugar for refining at a reduced duty,
according to the European Commission, the blocâ€™s regulatory arm.  The duty to be paid will be 252.5 euros ($336.36)
to 255 euros a ton, lower than the usual 339 euros a ton, the
commission said in a statement e-mailed today.  The bloc awarded the import licenses today at a tender
which was part of a series of measures approved on Nov. 24 to
increase supplies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
