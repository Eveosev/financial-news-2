The forint declined the most in more
than two months after European Central Bank president  Mario
Draghi  damped speculation that the central bank will increase
purchases of debt of struggling European nations.  The currency of Hungary, the European Union’s most indebted
eastern member, depreciated 2 percent to 306.35 per euro by 5:12
p.m. in Budapest, the biggest slide on a closing basis since
Sept. 19. The government’s benchmark 10-year bonds slumped,
lifting the yield 27 basis points to 9.05 percent.  The Frankfurt-based ECB today reduced its benchmark rate by
a quarter percentage point to 1 percent, matching a record low
and Draghi denied he had hinted that the ECB would step up bond
purchases to fight the region’s crisis. Hungary is one of the
countries most threatened by western European banks reducing
lending in eastern  Europe , Credit Agricole SA wrote in a
research report dated Dec. 7.  “The ECB decision and press conference sent the euro into
a tailspin versus the dollar, and in tandem with that the zloty,
the forint and the koruna too,” said Akos Ruzsonyi, a Budapest-
based currency trader at Commerzbank AG. “ Risk aversion  is
rising and hence emerging-market currencies are weakening.”  The benchmark BUX  index (BUX)  of shares fell 1.9 percent as  OTP
Bank Nyrt. (OTP) , Hungary’s largest lender, retreated 6.2 percent to
3,075 forint.  Hungary raised less than the target in a sale of Treasury
bills today as the yield demanded by investors increased.  To contact the reporter on this story:
