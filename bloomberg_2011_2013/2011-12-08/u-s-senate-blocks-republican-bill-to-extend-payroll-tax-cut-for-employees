The  U.S. Senate  blocked a Republican
proposal to extend into 2012 a payroll  tax cut  for workers and
cover the $119.6 billion cost by freezing pay for federal
workers and reducing the government workforce by 10 percent.  With 22 senators voting for the measure and 76 against it,
the bill fell short of the 60 votes needed to advance the
legislation. The Senate blocked the same measure on Dec. 1.  Unless Congress acts, the 3.1 percent Social Security
payroll tax for the first $110,000 of income will rise to 6.2
percent on Jan. 1.  The bill is S. 1931.  To contact the reporter on this story:
