Mediobanca SpA (MB) , one of the biggest
creditors of Italian insurer  Fondiaria-Sai SpA (FSA) , is urging the
company to raise as much as 600 million euros ($799 million) in
capital to improve ratios and strengthen finances, two people
with knowledge of the matter said.  Mediobanca, which has lent more than 1 billion euros to
Fondiaria, sent a letter to the firm calling for a
recapitalization of the insurer after its solvency margin fell
below the current minimum requirement of 120 percent, said the
people, who asked not to be named because the letter is private.
Spokeswomen at Mediobanca and Fondiaria declined to comment.  Fondiaria dropped as much as 5.9 percent, and was down 5.4
percent at 1.01 euros at 3:25 p.m. in Milan trading, giving the
company a market value of 435 million euros. That’s the biggest
intraday decline since Nov. 30.  Chief Executive Officer Emanuele Erbetta is selling assets
and real estate to boost capital as the insurer’s solvency ratio
fell to 111 percent at the end of September. The firm raised
about 450 million euros through a share sale in July.  The Mediobanca letter was early reported by Il Sole 24 ore.  To contact the reporter on this story:
