(Corrects name spelling in last paragraph of story first
published on Dec. 9.)  Nine months after the worst nuclear
disaster in decades, the world’s atomic-energy watchdog has yet
to dedicate additional money to improve reactor safety.  The delay has prompted the U.S. to call for the
 International Atomic Energy Agency  to prepare a budget for its
so-called action plan and to clarify how it will respond to
future nuclear emergencies. The United Nations-funded agency
said the allocation will be determined after a team draws up the
“main activities associated with the  action plan ,” according
to a Dec. 5 statement to Bloomberg News. Money wasn’t included
in the IAEA’s budget agreed to in September.  The agency classifies safety as one of its top three
priorities, yet is spending 8.9 percent of its 352 million-euro
($469 million) regular budget this year on making plants secure
from accidents. As it focuses resources on the other two
priorities -- technical cooperation and preventing nuclear-
weapons proliferation -- the IAEA is missing an opportunity to
improve shortcomings in reactor safety exposed by the Fukushima
disaster, said  Trevor Findlay , a former Australian diplomat.  “The IAEA did not seize the opportunity of this dreadful
event to advance the agency’s role in nuclear safety,” said
Findlay, who is finishing a two-year study of the Vienna-based
agency at  Harvard University . Director General Yukiya Amano
“has been tough on  Iran  and  Syria , but not when it comes to
nuclear safety.”  The IAEA was founded in 1957 as the global “Atoms for
Peace” organization to promote “safe, secure and peaceful”
nuclear technology,  according  to its website. A staff of 2,300
work at the IAEA’s secretariat at its headquarters.  Conflicting Role  Its mission statement encapsulates the same conflict as
Japan’s failed nuclear-safety regime: playing the role of both
promoter and regulator of atomic power, according to scientists,
diplomats and analysts interviewed by Bloomberg News.  About half of the IAEA’s budget is devoted to restricting
the use of nuclear material for military purposes, and the
agency has spent a decade investigating Iran’s atomic program
because of suspicion the country is developing weapons.  As the agency targeted weapons, the meltdowns at  Tokyo
Electric Power Co. (9501) ’s Fukushima Dai-Ichi nuclear plant capped
years of faked safety reports and fatal accidents in Japan’s
atomic-power industry. The country’s  Nuclear and Industrial
Safety Agency  was in a conflict of interest because it was under
the control of the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry,
which had a mandate to promote nuclear power.  Accepting Overlaps  The IAEA “accepted for years the overlap between
regulation and industry in Japan,” said Johannis Noeggerath,
president of  Switzerland ’s  Society of Nuclear Professionals  and
safety director for the country’s Leibstadt reactor. “They have
a safety culture problem.”  The agency encourages “safe, secure and responsible use of
nuclear energy in those countries that independently decide to
embark on a nuclear power program,” said Gill Tudor, an IAEA
spokeswoman. “Part of the agency’s mandate is to advise and
work with independent national regulators.”  Since coming to office in 2009, Amano has spent five times
more money fighting terrorism and preventing proliferation than
on making the world’s 450 nuclear reactors safer, UN data show.  The agency’s safety division garnered little respect in
U.S.  diplomatic cables  that described the department as a
marketing channel for countries seeking to sell atomic
technology.  Credentials Questioned  They also questioned the credentials of  Tomihiro Taniguchi ,
the IAEA’s former head of safety who helped create the
regulatory regime in Japan, which is being blamed for failings
that led to the Fukushima disaster.  “The department of safety and security needs a dedicated
manager and a stronger leader,” U.S. IAEA Ambassador Glyn Davies wrote in December 2009 in a cable released by Wikileaks,
the anti-secrecy website. “For the past 10 years, the
department has suffered tremendously because of Deputy Director
General Taniguchi’s weak management and leadership skills.”  The U.S. backed Amano’s bid to replace  Mohamed ElBaradei  in
2008 because he was believed to be supportive on confronting
Iran. ElBaradei was accused by the U.S. and its allies of
overstepping his IAEA mandate in seeking compromise solutions to
resolve the Iranian nuclear issue. Amano was “solidly in the
U.S. court,” according to a U.S. cable in  October 2009  released
by Wikileaks. The U.S. IAEA mission declined to comment on the
cables.  Threat Downplayed  By the time Amano reached office, the IAEA’s nuclear-safety
division had downplayed the threat from natural disasters. In
2010, the director general’s first full year in office, anti-
terrorism spending rose at three times the rate of safety
expenditure.  “Tsunamis, floods, hurricanes and earthquakes have
affected many parts of the world and nuclear installations
everywhere responded admirably,” Taniguchi said in a December
2005 speech. “The design and operational features ensured that
extreme natural conditions would not jeopardize safety.”  Taniguchi was also an executive of  Japan ’s Nuclear Power
Engineering Corp., which promotes public acceptance of the
operation of atomic-power plants, before joining the IAEA.  “I made contributions to significantly improving safety
systems around the world,” Taniguchi said when asked about the
U.S. cables. Now a professor at the Tokyo Institute of
Technology, he lectures graduate students on nuclear security.  Promoting Atomic Power  The IAEA’s own mission to promote atomic power may also
contradict the Convention on Nuclear Safety.  “Each contracting party shall take the appropriate steps
to ensure an effective separation between the functions of the
regulatory body and those of any other body or organization
concerned with the promotion or utilization of nuclear energy,”
says article 8.2 of  the convention .  In the U.S., the  Nuclear Regulatory Commission  reports to
Congress and is responsible for the licensing and oversight of
atomic power operators, according to its website.  The IAEA has been tarnished by a series of nuclear-safety
mishaps, including the combustion of plutonium in 2009 at an
Austrian lab and a mishandled vial that contaminated part of a
Belgian facility in 2011, according to the agency.  One IAEA plant inspector fell into a Czech nuclear-fuel
cooling pond in 2007, according to four officials who declined
to be identified. The agency won’t make public a full list of
incidents involving its own staff.  “IAEA inspectors and field workers are largely on their
own when it comes to safely carrying out their jobs,” said
Robert Kelley, a former IAEA director who led inspections in
 Iraq . “They receive little guidance or support and they are
very dependent on the facilities they are inspecting to protect
their health.”  Fukushima Failure  The agency’s failure on Fukushima is due to its timid
leadership and an over-reliance on Japanese data, said Findlay,
who will present the Center for International Governance
Innovation’s report on the IAEA in Vienna in April. “The
agency’s self-promotion led outsiders to naturally expect the
agency to leap into action, so it only has itself to blame for
that.”  Japan’s public remains uneasy about the reactors at
Fukushima, which are still exposed to damage from earthquakes,
said Akio Matsumura, a former diplomat and chairman of the World
Business Academy. The absence of independent information about
the meltdown compounds those fears, he said.  “The IAEA has disseminated reports on updates at
Fukushima, but the source of the information is the Japanese
government,” Matsumura said. “If the Japanese government
chooses to remain opaque in its dealings, then the IAEA reports
will be useless.”  Deflecting Criticism  The IAEA had to deflect criticism from its members for
weeks following the Fukushima disaster because it refused to
analyze risks from the meltdown. The U.S. NRC provided more risk
assessments than the IAEA by independently widening the areas it
labeled dangerous around the reactors beyond where Japanese
officials set limits.  The Fukushima meltdowns have already spread more radiation
over Japan than the Hiroshima and Nagasaki nuclear bombs
combined, Arnie Gundersen, a U.S. nuclear engineer who testified
before the NRC on the Fukushima meltdowns, wrote in an e-mail.
The stricken plant is expected to be brought under control
before the end of the year, according to Tepco.  To contact the reporter on this story:
