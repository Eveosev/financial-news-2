The U.S. House voted to prevent the
Environmental Protection Agency from tightening air-pollution
controls on farm dust, a regulation the agency said it has no
plans to issue.  The Republican-led House passed the legislation 268-150
today. President  Barack Obama ’s administration said it opposes
the bill and issued a veto threat yesterday. Republicans said
they don’t trust the EPA to hold off on new standards and worry
a lawsuit could force the agency to act.  “Many of the environmental decisions made in America today
come as outside groups file lawsuits, and EPA runs and enters
into” an agreement to comply with that request,  Representative
Ed Whitfield, Kentucky Republican, said before the vote.  EPA Administrator  Lisa Jackson  said in a letter to Senator
 Debbie Stabenow , a Michigan Democrat and chairwoman of the
Senate Agriculture Committee, that the EPA would keep intact the
current standard for particulate-matter pollution for farms,
construction and demolition work.  Jackson, in the Oct. 14 letter, said that she decided to
maintain the 1987 standard after a review of the science, an
analysis by agency scientists and recommendations from an
outside advisory panel.  “This is a bad solution to an imaginary problem,”
Representative  Diana DeGette , a Colorado Democrat, said during
debate. “With one week left in the legislative session, we are
spending a day on a bill that addresses a problem that doesn’t
exist.”  The bill is H.R. 1633  To contact the reporter on this story:
