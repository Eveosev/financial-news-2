Australian employers cut 6,300
workers in November from the previous month, the statistics
bureau said in Sydney today. That compared with the median
estimate for a 10,000 increase in a Bloomberg News survey of 22
economists. The jobless rate was 5.3 percent last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
