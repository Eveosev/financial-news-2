Uruguay’s monetary policy committee
will “balance” its “concern” about inflation and global
uncertainties at its meeting at the end of this month, said
central bank President Mario Bergara.  “The central bank will take steps to make credible its
policy of  price stability , but we are in a very volatile and
increasingly uncertain context,” Bergara said. “Therefore, we
must balance inflationary pressures with productive and
competitive aspects,” he said to reporters in Montevideo.  Uruguay has kept its  benchmark rate  at 8 percent since
June, when it boosted the rate from 7.5 percent. The central
bank targets inflation of 4 percent to 6 percent. In the year
through November,  prices  were up 8.4 percent, according to the
National Statistics Institute. The monetary council next meets
on Dec. 29.  “We will take steps to maintain a balance between the
objectives of price stability and growth,” Bergara said, adding
that he will “wait” to see the data on the evolution of gross
domestic product in the third quarter next week to determine
what to do with the  interest rate .  Bergara expressed “concern” because inflation is “two
percentage points above the target range.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
