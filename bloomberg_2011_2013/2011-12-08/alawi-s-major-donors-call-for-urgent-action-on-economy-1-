Malawi’s major donors said the
country needs to urgently address economic and political
concerns for them to resume aid to the southern African nation.  The donors called for "a swift restoration of macroeconomic
stability and a revival of the IMF Extended Credit Facility as a
critical step towards the resumption of budget support,’’
according to a statement from the Common Approach to Budget
Support group.  The group, which includes the  African Development Bank , the
European Union,  Germany ,  Norway , the U.K. Department for
International Development and the World Bank Group, issued the
statement via e-mail after a meeting with the government in
Lilongwe today.  The donors suspended aid last year as a result of concerns
about the country’s economic and political policies. Malawi
relies on donor support for 40 percent of its national budget.  The government announced yesterday it referred some
legislation deemed oppressive to the Malawi Law Commission for
review.  To contact the reporter on this story:
