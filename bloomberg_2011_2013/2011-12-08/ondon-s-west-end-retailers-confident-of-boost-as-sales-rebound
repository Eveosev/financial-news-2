Retailers in London’s  West End 
shopping district are “optimistic” about Christmas sales after
business rebounded in the first week of December.  Shopper numbers rose 1 percent in the week ended Dec. 4 as
Britons received their monthly pay and colder weather spurred
sales of winter clothes, according the  New West End Company ,
which represents more than 600 fashion-led brands on  Bond
Street , Oxford Street and Regent Street. That followed a 2.6
percent drop in November sales, the organization said.  The improvement in business for London’s retailers was
echoed by John Lewis Partnership Plc, which said today that
department-store sales in the four days ended Dec. 7 rose 3.7
percent. Shoppers are seeking out Christmas trees and party-
preparation products such as nail varnish, the national retailer
said. The Arndale shopping center in northwest  England  said
232,000 shoppers came through its doors on Dec. 3, up 10 percent
on last year and its strongest Saturday on record.  Retailers in the West End are “confident sales will gain
further momentum” this weekend as the district restricts
streets to pedestrians. Sales of 150 million pounds ($235
million) are forecast, according to the New West End Company.  “In November, which saw above-average temperatures
hindering winter fashion sales, and impact from major roadworks,
it is not surprising that sales took a dip in the West End, but
December is already looking brighter,” said Richard Dickinson,
chief executive officer of the trade group.  To contact the reporter on this story:
