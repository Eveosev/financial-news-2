U.S. stocks fell, snapping a three-
day gain, as the  European Central Bank  damped speculation it
would boost debt purchases and amid a report Germany rejected
some proposals to fight the crisis at a summit of leaders.  Banks tumbled as  Morgan Stanley (MS) ,  Citigroup Inc. (C)  and
 JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  retreated at least 5.2 percent. Alcoa Inc.,
Intel Corp. and General Electric Co. dropped more than 2.5
percent, pacing declines among the biggest American companies.
 Hartford (HIG)  Financial Services Group Inc. decreased 8.2 percent
after the insurer said it is targeting additional cost cuts as
it copes with a “fragile economic recovery.”  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index retreated 2.1 percent to
1,234.35 at 4 p.m.  New York  time as 487 out of 500 stocks
declined. The  Dow Jones Industrial Average  lost 198.67 points,
or 1.6 percent, to 11,997.70. The Russell 2000 Index of small
companies tumbled 3.1 percent to 722.68.  “There’s a temptation to take capital out of the market,”
 Michael Shaoul , chairman of Marketfield Asset Management in New
York, which oversees $1 billion, said in a telephone interview.
“You have the concern that the last few times Europe leaders
have sat down and talked about this they made a mess of it.
People are preparing for the worst.”  Comments from ECB President  Mario Draghi  roiled the global
markets. He kept the onus on European leaders meeting in
Brussels to solve the debt crisis by repeating his call for a
“fiscal compact” and denying he had hinted the ECB would
automatically support such an initiative with more bond
purchases.  German Opposition  Equities extended losses in the final hour of trading as
Reuters reported that  Germany  reiterated its opposition to some
of the debt-crisis fighting measures being discussed at the
summit in Brussels, including issuing common euro-zone debt or
running the temporary and permanent bailout funds
simultaneously. The European Banking Authority said European
Union banks must raise 114.7 billion euros ($152.8 billion) in
fresh capital, up from a previous estimate of 106 billion euros.  Today’s decline sent the  S&P 500  lower for 2011. It has
pared its decline from the end of April to 9.5 percent after
dropping as much as 19 percent from this year’s high in April.
The gauge has erased its year-to-date loss six times since the
beginning of October amid speculation Europe’s steps to tame its
crisis would avert a global recession.  All 10 industries in the S&P 500 declined as financial
shares tumbled 3.7 percent as a group. The  KBW Bank Index (BKX)  sank
3.9 percent as all of its 24 stocks retreated. Morgan Stanley
declined 8.4 percent, the most in the S&P 500, to $15.88.
Citigroup dropped 7 percent to $27.75. JPMorgan fell 5.2 percent
to $32.22, for the biggest decline in the Dow.  Alcoa, Intel, GE  The Morgan Stanley Cyclical Index retreated 2.9 percent,
while the Dow Jones Transportation Average sank 2.5 percent amid
concern about economic growth. Alcoa slid 4.3 percent to $9.47.
Intel lost 3.7 percent to $24.71. GE fell 2.6 percent to $16.31.  Hartford tumbled 8.2 percent to $17.20. Core earnings,
which exclude some investment results, will be $3.30 to $3.60 a
share next year, according to a presentation today from the
company. That compares with the $3.51 average estimate of 18
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Costco Wholesale Corp. (COST)  declined 2 percent to $85.76 after
the largest U.S. warehouse-club chain said profit margin shrank
in the first quarter because of rising costs.  McDonald’s Corp. (MCD)  rose 0.5 percent to $96.92, a record. The
shares had the only gain in the Dow. The world’s largest
restaurant chain said sales at stores open at least 13 months
rose 7.4 percent globally last month, driven by demand in Japan
and China.  Stocks May Gain  The U.S. stock market may gain in coming months as economic
prospects for the country improve, said  Dennis Gartman , an
economist and the publisher of the Gartman Letter. At the Inside
Commodities conference today in New York, Gartman said he’s
starting to get more “bullish” on U.S. equities.  Stock-futures rallied earlier today after the ECB cut
 interest rates  and offered banks unlimited cash for three years.
In the U.S, data showed that fewer Americans than forecast filed
 applications  for unemployment benefits last week, reflecting a
drop in firings that may signal the job market is on the mend.  “We have two positives and a question mark,”  David Kelly ,
who helps oversee $394 billion as chief market strategist for
JPMorgan Funds in New York, said in a telephone interview. “The
unemployment claims show the U.S. continues to decouple from
Europe’s problems. The second thing is the ECB’s further
commitment to stabilize the bank system. The question mark is
left to European leaders. We need to see more of a commitment to
enforce fiscal discipline and a plan for economic growth.”  200-Day Average  The S&P 500 today is more than 1 percent below its average
price in the last  200 days (SPX)  after briefly surpassing it in each
of the last three days, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The
index hasn’t closed above the chart line since Nov. 8, the day
before a decline of 3.7 percent. It fell 5.2 percent in the two
days after it rose above the 200-day average on Oct. 28.  “It isn’t encouraging for the bulls to see the S&P 500
continue to find trouble near its 200-day moving average,”  Ryan Detrick , senior technical strategist at Schaeffer’s Investment
Research, said in a telephone interview from Cincinnati. “Then,
consider the year-to-date break-even is around 1,257, and you
have two logical areas of potential resistance that are clearly
holding the market back here.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
