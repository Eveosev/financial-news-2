Deutsche Post AG ,  Europe ’s largest
postal service, lost a challenge against a regulator’s decision
to re-open a probe into possible state aid after complaints from
competitors.  The  EU General Court , the region’s second-highest court
based in Luxembourg, today dismissed the challenge by Deutsche
Post as “inadmissible.” The ruling can be appealed to the EU
Court of Justice.  Deutsche Post in 2007 sought to ban a decision by the
European Commission, the EU’s executive agency, to investigate
“all public measures, such as transfers of public money and
tariff income” granted to the Bonn-based company and its
predecessor Postdienst since 1989.  The probe followed a commission decision in June 2002 that
 Germany  must recover 572 million euros ($767 million) of illegal
aid to Deutsche Post because the postal service had improperly
used the money to cover losses in its parcel-delivery business.  Deutsche Post in 2008 won a lower EU court ruling to
overturn the EU’s June 2002 decision that it misused 572 million
euros in state subsidies. The decision was upheld by the EU’s
top court in 2010, by which time the original amount had
increased to 1.15 billion euros with the addition of interest.  Deutsche Post will have to study the ruling before deciding
whether to appeal, Dirk Klasen, a spokesman for the company,
said by phone.  The case is: T-421/07, Deutsche Post v. European
Commission.  To contact the reporter on this story:
