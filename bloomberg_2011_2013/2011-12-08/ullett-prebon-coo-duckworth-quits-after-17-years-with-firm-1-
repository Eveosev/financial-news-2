Tullett Prebon Plc , a British inter-
dealer broker, said Chief Operating Officer Steph Duckworth has
resigned after 17 years with the firm.  A departure date for Duckworth, 45, has not yet been agreed
and Tullett may not replace him after hiring in their regional
offices, a person with knowledge of the matter said. Duckworth
has been COO since November 2008 and was chief executive officer
of Tullett’s European business before that. A spokesman for
Tullett in  London  declined to comment beyond the statement.  “He has now decided to move on and do something else and
is not expected to move to another inter-dealer broker,” wrote
Phil Dobbin, an analyst at Espirito Santo Investment Bank in
London in a note to investors today. “We don’t see this as a
significant management change,” wrote Dobbin, who has a “buy”
rating on the stock.  Inter-dealer brokers such as Tullett act as a go-between
for banks that trade bonds, stocks, currencies, energy and
derivatives. They typically handle more trades between banks
during periods of greater market volatility. Tullett, which
split off from U.K. stockbroker  Collins Stewart  in 2006,
competes against ICAP Plc, the biggest broker of transactions
between banks.  The shares gained 0.2 percent to 290.3 pence at 9:02 a.m.
in London, valuing the company at 625 million pounds ($982
million).  To contact the reporter on this story:
