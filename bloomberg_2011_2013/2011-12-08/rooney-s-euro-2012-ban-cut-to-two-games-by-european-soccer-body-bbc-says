England  striker  Wayne Rooney ’s ban
was reduced to two games by European soccer’s ruling body after
the player appealed his suspension, the British Broadcasting
Corp. said.  UEFA had ruled Oct. 13 that the England and Manchester
United striker should miss three matches after he was dismissed
for kicking out at Montenegro’s Miodrag Dzudovic six days
earlier. The suspension would have caused him to miss England’s
three opening group matches in next year’s regional
championship.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
