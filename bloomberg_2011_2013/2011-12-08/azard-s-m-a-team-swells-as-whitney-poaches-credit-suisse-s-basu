Lazard Ltd. (LAZ) , the investment bank that
advised on BASF SE’s $7 billion styrene joint venture, said it
has hired Atish Basu from  Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN)  to expand its
chemical deals team.  Basu will remain in  New York , where he was working for
Credit Suisse, said Richard Creswell, a spokesman for Lazard in
London.  The appointment follows Lazard’s hiring of New York-based
Richard Whitney as a managing director and global co-head of
chemicals in mid-October. Whitney previously held the same
position at Credit Suisse. Lazard has been building out its
worldwide chemical M&A team, adding Frank Balhorn, a former
JPMorgan Chase & Co. chemicals banker, to its office in
Frankfurt.  The pace of mergers and acquisitions in the $3.1 trillion
 chemical industry  slumped to the slowest since 2009 in the third
quarter, quashing earlier predictions that the year may be a
record. Transactions announced in the three months through
September fell 64 percent to $6.46 billion from the second
quarter and slumped from $48.5 billion in the year-earlier
period, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It’s the lowest
volume since the fourth quarter of 2009.  Lazard hired energy investment banker Mark Renton from
Citigroup Inc. to boost market share in oil and gas takeovers,
two people with knowledge of the matter said on Dec. 5.  To contact the reporter on this story:
