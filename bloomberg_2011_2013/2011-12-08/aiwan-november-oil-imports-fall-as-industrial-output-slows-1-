Taiwan , which imports more than 99
percent of its crude oil needs, purchased less of the fuel in
November after industrial output slowed, cutting energy demand.  Shipments declined 33 percent from a year earlier to 19.7
million barrels last month, the  Ministry of Finance  said in
Taipei today. The islandâ€™s November oil bill dropped 11 percent
to $2.14 billion, the ministry said in a statement.  Industrial production increased the least in more than two
years in October, a Ministry of Economic Affairs report showed
Nov. 23. Output by petroleum and coal-product companies fell a
combined 4.6 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
