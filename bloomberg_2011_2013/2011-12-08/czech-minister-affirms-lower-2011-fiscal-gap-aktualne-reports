The Czech 2011 public-finance deficit
will be less than the target even as lagging inflows of European
Union funds widen the central state budget gap,  Aktualne.cz 
reported, citing Finance Minister Miroslav Kalousek.  Kalousek reiterated the public-finance shortfall, the
fiscal yardstick for assessing an EU memberâ€™s readiness to adopt
the euro, will be 3.7 percent or 3.8 percent of economic output,
compared with the original target of 4.6 percent, the news
website reported. The central  budget deficit  may be as much as
150 billion koruna ($8 billion), compared with the 135 billion
koruna goal, Aktualne cited Kalousek as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
