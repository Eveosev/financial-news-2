Ukraineâ€™s central bank will start
currency-swap contracts with lenders from Dec. 16,
 Ekonomicheskie Izvestia  reported, citing a letter sent to banks.  The minimum amount for swaps will be 10 million hryvnia
($1.25 million), according to the newspaper. The central bank
will set annual interest rates for such operations on the basis
of the key discount rate and currency-market conditions,
Izvestia reported.  The central bank stipulates its right to terminate swap
agreements prematurely, Izvestia said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
