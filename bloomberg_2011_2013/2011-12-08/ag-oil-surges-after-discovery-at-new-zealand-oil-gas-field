producing at some of them, the company said in a statement on PR
newswire. The company recently won approval to drill an
additional 18 wells in the Cheal field.  TAG Oil, based in Vancouver, is focused on oil exploration
on New Zealandâ€™s North Island, which the company said has
similar oil-rich formations to the Bakken region in North
America.  The shares rose C$1.15 to C$7.40 at the close in Toronto.
