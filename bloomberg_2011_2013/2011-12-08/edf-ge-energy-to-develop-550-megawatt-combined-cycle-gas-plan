(Corrects capacity in headline and first paragraph of
story first published yesterday.)  Electricite de  France  SA and  GE
Energy  will develop a 510-megawatt combined-cycle gas power
generator in northern France.  The new-generation GE model will be built at an existing
plant at Bouchain by 2015, when an existing coal-fired thermal
power plant is scheduled to be shut down, according to a
statement from the Paris-based utility.  The plant will cost 400 million euros ($536 million), EDF
Chief Executive Officer  Henri Proglio  said. The project is part
of a “strategic partnership” with GE and aimed at modernizing
EDF’s thermal plants by 2023, EDF said.  The new power plant will be able to reach maximum output
within 30 minutes compared with about an hour for existing
fossil-fuel plants, according to the utility.  To contact the reporter on this story:
