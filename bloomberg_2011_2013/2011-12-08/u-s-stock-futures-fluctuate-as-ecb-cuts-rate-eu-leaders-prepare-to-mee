U.S. stock futures remained little
changed after the  European Central Bank  cut  interest rates  for a
second straight month and investors awaited announcements from
the region’s leaders on plans to tame the debt crisis.   Standard & Poor’s 500 Index futures expiring this month
declined less than 0.1 percent to 1,263.8 at 7:49 a.m. in  New
York . Futures on the  Dow Jones Industrial Average  rose 9 points,
or less than 0.1 percent, to 12,223. The Dow rose to its highest
level since October yesterday amid optimism that the leaders of
the European Union will announce further efforts to halt the
sovereign-debt crisis at a summit in Brussels that starts today.  ECB policy makers meeting in Frankfurt lowered the
benchmark interest rate by a quarter percentage point to 1
percent to match a record low, as expected by 55 of 58
economists in a Bloomberg News survey. They may also loosen
collateral criteria to give banks greater access to cheap cash
and offer longer-term loans, said three euro-area officials with
knowledge of the deliberations.  The leaders of the EU convene at 7:30 p.m. in Brussels for
talks to implement the fifth solution in 19 months to the
crisis. S&P put Germany and  France  on review for potential
downgrades of their AAA ratings on Dec. 5. The ECB says that
governments must address the cause of the turmoil as it focuses
on getting banks lending again.  In the U.S., a Labor Department report due at 8:30 a.m. in
 Washington  will show that jobless claims fell to 395,000 last
week from 402,000 the previous week, economists in a Bloomberg
News survey predicted.  The  S&P 500  has struggled to make any headway this year,
climbing 0.3 percent from the end of last year, as the euro
area’s debt crisis spread to the 17-nation currency’s larger
economies. The index dropped 19 percent between this year’s high
on April 29 and this year’s low on Oct. 3. The gauge has pared
its decline from the end of April to 7.5 percent. It has erased
its 2011 loss six times since the beginning of October.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
