The  Federal Reserve  said that Steven B. Kamin will officially become the director of the central
bank’s chief international economic advisory division.  Kamin became acting director in August following the
departure of Nathan Sheets, who led the office after almost four
years and became the global head of international economics at
 Citigroup Inc. (C)  Kamin’s appointment is effective Dec. 11, the Fed
said in a statement today in Washington.  As director of the Division of International Finance, Kamin
briefs Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  and other officials on
economic developments outside the U.S. and represents the Fed at
international meetings.  “Steve’s deep understanding of international economic and
financial matters make him uniquely qualified to lead the
division during this pivotal time for the global economy,”
Bernanke said in a statement.  Kamin’s appointment completes the turnover of all three of
Bernanke’s top staff advisers in the last two years. Brian Madigan, former director of the Division of Monetary Affairs,
retired last year and was replaced by William English in July
2010. David Wilcox replaced  David Stockton  as director of the
Division of Research and Statistics on Oct. 1.  Kamin -- like English, Wilcox and Bernanke -- earned his
doctorate in economics from the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology.  To contact the reporter on this story:
