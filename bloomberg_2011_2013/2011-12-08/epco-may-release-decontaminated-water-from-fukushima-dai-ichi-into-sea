Tokyo Electric Power Co. is
considering releasing decontaminated water from its wrecked
Fukushima Dai-Ichi nuclear plant into the sea as early as March
because storage capacity is reaching its limits, a company
official said.  Tokyo Electric would release the water after
“sufficiently” lowering its radiation levels, Junichi
Matsumoto, a general manager at the utility, told reporters
today. The company explained the plan to a local fishery
association on Dec. 5, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
