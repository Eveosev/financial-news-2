A total of 2,359 workers at
 Telefonica SA (TEF)  accepted voluntary redundancy in 2011, exceeding
the companyâ€™s forecast,  Cinco Dias  reported.  The company, which anticipated that 2,246 employees would
accept the plan this year, expects an additional 2,000 workers
will do so next year and a similar number in 2013, the newspaper
said, without citing anyone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
