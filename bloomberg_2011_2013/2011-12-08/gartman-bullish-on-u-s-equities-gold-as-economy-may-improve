The U.S. stock market may gain in
coming months as economic prospects for the country improve,
said  Dennis Gartman , an economist and the publisher of the
Gartman Letter.  “I’m starting to get more bullish on the U.S. stock
market,” Gartman said at the Inside Commodities conference
today in  New York . “I also like gold, but I’m very bearish on
the euro.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
