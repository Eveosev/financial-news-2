BCE Inc. (BCE) ,  Canada ’s largest phone
company, raised its dividend 5 percent and said it plans to buy
back as much as C$250 million ($248 million) of shares to make
use of surplus cash.  The annual dividend will rise to C$2.17 a share from
C$2.07, starting with a first-quarter payment on April 15, the
Montreal-based company said today in a statement.  BCE, which has been gaining mobile subscribers at a faster
rate than larger wireless rival  Rogers Communications Inc. , made
the seventh increase to annual dividend in three years. Last
year, BCE raised the dividend by 7.7 percent.  BCE said today it also plans to make a voluntary pension
plan contribution of C$750 million. The move will result in tax
savings and increase earnings per share, excluding some costs,
by about 3 Canadian cents a share.  “In a financial climate of declining interest rates and
weak equity returns, accelerating the cash funding” of the
pension plan “is a prudent action,” Chief Financial Officer
Siim Vanaselja said in the statement.  BCE rose 1.1 percent to C$40.60 at the close in Toronto.
The stock had climbed 15 percent this year as Rogers gained 6.8
percent.  The company reiterated that 2011 earnings per share will be
C$3.10 to C$3.15 and revenue at its main Bell phone business
will grow 9 percent to 11 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
