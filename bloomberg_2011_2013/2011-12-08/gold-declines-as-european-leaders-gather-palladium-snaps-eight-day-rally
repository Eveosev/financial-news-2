Gold fell the most in more than two
weeks after European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  said he
didn’t signal plans to purchase more bonds to spur growth.  Equities and the euro retreated after Draghi said the ECB’s
bond-purchase program was not eternal or infinite, damping
speculation that the central bank will increase debt buying to
fight the region’s crisis. The U.S. Dollar Index, a six-currency
gauge, climbed for the first time in four days.  “The market is once again completely focused on what’s
going on in the euro zone,”  Matthew Zeman , a strategist at
Kingsview Financial in  Chicago , said in a telephone interview.
“Gold has been acting like any other risk asset. When people go
into risk-off mode, gold suffers the consequences, like
everything else, while the dollar and Treasuries benefit.”  Gold futures for February delivery declined 1.8 percent to
close at $1,713.40 an ounce at 1:42 p.m. on the Comex in  New
York , the biggest loss for a most-active contract since Nov. 21.  Bullion has retreated 11 percent since reaching a record
$1,923.70 on Sept. 6. Prices are still up 21 percent this year,
heading for an 11th straight annual gain.  The  interest rate  for lending gold in exchange for dollars
has dropped to the lowest on record as European banks try to
secure U.S. currency, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The  one-month lease  rate fell to minus 0.57 percent on Dec. 6,
the lowest based on data going back to January 1998.  Silver futures for March delivery fell 3.3 percent to
$31.538 an ounce on the Comex. The metal is up 1.9 percent in
2011.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , palladium futures for
March delivery declined 1.5 percent to $675.30 an ounce, the
first drop in nine sessions.  Platinum futures for January delivery fell 1.8 percent to
$1,494.40 an ounce, the biggest loss since Nov. 21.  To contact the reporter on this story:
