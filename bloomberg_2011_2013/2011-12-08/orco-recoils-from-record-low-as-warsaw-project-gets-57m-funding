Orco Property Group (ORC)  SA rebounded from
the lowest on record after the developer secured an additional
loan to complete the construction of a 54-story apartment block
in central Warsaw.  The stock jumped as much as 10 percent before paring its
gains to 6.1 percent at 87.5 koruna as of 2:20 p.m. in Prague,
the biggest rise in the  PX (PX)  equity benchmark today. Orco
yesterday fell to the lowest since it began trading on the Czech
bourse in February 2005.  Bank Pekao SA (PEO)  has agreed to extend a supplementary 190
million-zloty ($57 million) loan for Zlota 44, a tower in
central Warsaw designed by Daniel Libeskind, Luxembourg-
registered Orco said today in statement. The project will be
completed in 2013, with a total investment of “more than” 700
million zloty, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
