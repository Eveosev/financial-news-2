The wreckage of an unmanned U.S.
reconnaissance aircraft, which  Iran  said it shot down in the
country’s east on Dec. 4, will be put on display, a state-run
Tehran-based newspaper said.  Journalists will soon be able to see the RQ-170 Sentinel
drone, an unidentified military official was cited as saying by
the newspaper, Iran, without providing details.  The North Atlantic Treaty Organization’s force in
neighboring  Afghanistan  said last week that the drone may have
been a U.S. aircraft that was brought down by a malfunction
while on a mission over western Afghan territory.  To contact the reporter on this story:
