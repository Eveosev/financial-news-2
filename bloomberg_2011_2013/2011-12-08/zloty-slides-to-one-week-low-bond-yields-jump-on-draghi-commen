The Polish zloty slumped to one-week
low against the euro after European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  said he didn’t signal the central bank would step up bond
purchases to spur growth.  The zloty lost 1 percent to 4.5051 per euro as of 5 p.m. in
Warsaw. The yield on 10-year bonds rose eight basis points to
5.98 percent.  Draghi said during a press conference in  Frankfurt  that he
was “kind of surprised by the implicit meaning” that was given
to his comments last week when he said the ECB could follow
faster fiscal union with “other elements.” The bank cut its
benchmark  interest rate  by a quarter percentage point to 1
percent, as expected by 55 of 58 economists in a Bloomberg News
survey, before European Union leaders meet in Brussels for a
summit to combat the bloc’s sovereign-debt crisis today.  “The ECB has giveth and taketh away today, leaving the
market pessimistic about the outcome of tomorrow’s summit,”
 Marc Chandler , chief currency strategist at Brown Brothers
Harriman & Co. in  New York , wrote in a note to clients.  There is a “real threat” that the summit meeting of
European Union leaders starting today will fail “if we don’t
wake up” and take decisive action rather than making “empty
declarations,” Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said in the
French port of Marseille today. Poland relies on the euro region
for 54 percent of its exports and 59 percent of its bank assets
are owned by western European lenders, according to government
data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
