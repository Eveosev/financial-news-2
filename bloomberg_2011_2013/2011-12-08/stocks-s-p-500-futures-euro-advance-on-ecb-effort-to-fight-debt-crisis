U.S. stock futures, European equities
and the euro rallied after European Central Bank President  Mario
Draghi  said policy makers will adopt further non-standard
measures to fight the debt crisis.  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index futures expiring this month
climbed 0.5 percent to 1,270.5 at 8:40 a.m. in  New York . The
Stoxx Europe 600 Index jumped 0.9 percent and the euro was up
0.2 percent at $1.3443. The S&P GSCI Index of commodities
increased 0.8 percent.  Draghi said the ECB will offer three-year loans to banks
and ease collateral criteria. The  Dow Jones Industrial Average 
rose to the highest level since October yesterday amid optimism
that the leaders of the European Union will announce further
efforts to halt the sovereign-debt crisis at a summit in
Brussels that starts today.  ECB policy makers meeting in  Frankfurt  also lowered the
benchmark  interest rate  by a quarter percentage point to 1
percent to match a record low, as expected by 55 of 58
economists in a Bloomberg News survey.  The leaders of the EU convene at 7:30 p.m. in Brussels for
talks to implement the fifth solution in 19 months to the
crisis. S&P put Germany and France on review for potential
downgrades of their AAA ratings on Dec. 5. The ECB says that
governments must address the cause of the turmoil as it focuses
on getting banks lending again.  The  S&P 500  has struggled to make any headway this year,
climbing 0.3 percent from the end of last year, as the euro
area’s debt crisis spread to the 17-nation currency’s larger
economies. The index dropped 19 percent between this year’s high
on April 29 and this year’s low on Oct. 3. The gauge has pared
its decline from the end of April to 7.5 percent. It has erased
its 2011 loss six times since the beginning of October.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
