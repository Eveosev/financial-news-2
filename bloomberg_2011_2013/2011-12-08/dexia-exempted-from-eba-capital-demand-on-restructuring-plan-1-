Dexia SA (DEXB) , the French-Belgian lender
that’s being broken up, said it won’t have to comply with
capital rules set by the European Banking Authority because it’s
planning to “radically shrink in size.”  The EBA,  Europe ’s banking regulator, said today that Dexia
would need to raise 6.3 billion euros ($8.4 billion) by mid-2012
to reach a 9 percent target for core Tier 1 capital after
markdowns of sovereign-debt holdings, a figure the company said
shrank to 4.2 billion euros after the Belgian government’s
takeover of Dexia Bank Belgium SA on Oct. 20. In any event, the
company’s break-up plan means it will be exempt.  “The group will not further develop significant cross-
border activity and will radically shrink in size,” Dexia,
based in Brussels and Paris, said in the statement today.
“Given those elements, Dexia does not have to comply with the
recapitalization requirement of the EBA capital buffer exercise
and will not remain in the EBA sample.”  Dexia put its banking units in Luxembourg and  Turkey (DENIZ) , its
asset-management division and a 50 percent stake in a custody
joint venture with Royal Bank of Canada up for sale to reduce
the need for regulatory capital. The lender also obtained
government guarantees on as much as 90 billion euros of loans
and bonds, which still need to be approved by the European
Commission.
