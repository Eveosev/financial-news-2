Iran , OPEC’s second-largest oil
producer, plans to raise daily crude output by 45,000 barrels a
day next year,  Press TV  reported, citing Mehdi Fakour, managing
director of the Iranian Central Oil Fields Co.  The increase would occur once the Sarvestan, Saadatabad and
Khesht oil fields in southern Iran come on stream in March,
Fakour said, according to the state-run news channel. Khesht has
proven crude reserves of more than 1 billion barrels, and the
other two fields together hold more than 1.4 billion barrels,
the report said.  Iran pumped an average of 3.56 million barrels of crude a
day in November, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
country’s oil output has stagnated amid international economic
sanctions that have deterred foreign energy companies from
investing there. The U.S., European Union and  United Nations  say
Iran is trying to develop nuclear weapons technology, a charge
the government denies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
