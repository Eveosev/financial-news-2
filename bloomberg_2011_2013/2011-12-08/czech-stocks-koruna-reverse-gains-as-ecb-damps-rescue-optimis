Czech shares declined for a third day
and the koruna weakened after the  European Central Bank  damped
speculation it would step up government bond purchases to stem
the debt crisis in the main market for Czech exports.  The koruna slid 0.5 percent to 25.371 per euro by 4:50 p.m.
in Prague, reversing an earlier gain of as much as 0.4 percent.
The  PX (PX)  equity gauge declined 0.4 percent, after earlier rising
as much as 0.5 percent.  While the ECB cut funding costs and offered banks unlimited
cash for three years today, President Mario Draghi said he did
not necessarily signal that the bank would increase bond
purchases when he spoke last week. The statement sent global
stocks and Italian and Spanish bonds tumbling while most
emerging-market currencies weakened.  To contact the reporter on this story:
