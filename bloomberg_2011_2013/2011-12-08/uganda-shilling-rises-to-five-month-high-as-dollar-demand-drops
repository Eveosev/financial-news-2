     Dec. 8 (Bloomberg) -- Uganda ’s shilling advanced for a third
day, rising to the highest in more than five months, as demand
for dollars dropped.  The currency of East Africa’s third-largest economy rose
1.1 percent to 2,461.50 per dollar and traded 0.8 percent higher
at 2,468 at 12:24 p.m., the strongest since June 21.  “Limited dollar demand is driving the shilling gains,”
Faisal Bukenya, the head of  currency trading  at  Barclays Bank  of
Uganda Ltd., said by phone from Kampala. “We also have a
Treasury bills auction next week which is attracting in
dollars.”  The nation’s central bank will auction 95 billion shillings
($39.5 million) worth of three-, six- and 12-month Treasury
bills on Dec. 17, the bank said today by e-mail. The three-month
bills attracted a yield of 23.389 percent at the previous
auction on Nov. 30, the bank said.  Kenya ’s shilling gained for a second day on improved dollar
inflows from the sale of coffee and tea. The currency of East
Africa’s biggest economy strengthened as much as 0.4 percent and
was up 0.1 percent at 89.50 per dollar at 12:18 p.m. in Nairobi.  Kenya’s coffee prices climbed 21 percent at an auction as
buyers replenished their stocks before the year-end holidays,
the Nairobi Coffee Exchange said yesterday. The average price
for all the coffee sold rose to $340.95 for a 50-kilogram (110-
pound) bag from $280.70 two weeks ago, the Nairobi exchange
said, with supplies rising 56 percent to 16,610 bags from 10,616
bags at the previous auction.  African tea prices fell to an average of $2.60 per kilogram
at a sale in the Kenyan port city of  Mombasa , the Tea Brokers
East Africa Ltd. said in an e-mail yesterday.  Tanzania’s shilling climbed for the third time this week,
gaining 1.8 percent to 1,615 per dollar, on increased inflows
from the  tourism industry  and non-governmental organizations.  “Inflows are coming in from the tourism sector, and some
non-governmental organizations today,” Eric Chijoriga, a dealer
with National Bank of Commerce Ltd., ABSA Group’s Tanzanian
unit, said by phone from  Dar es Salaam , the commercial capital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
