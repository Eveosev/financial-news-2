Shares of the following companies had
 unusual (VNINDEX)  moves in Vietnam trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses, and prices are as of the 11 a.m. local-time close.  The VN Index, the benchmark measure of the Ho Chi Minh City
Stock Exchange, fell 1.4 percent to 381.63, the biggest drop in
two weeks.  Danang Rubber Joint-Stock Co. (DRC)   dropped 3.7 percent
to 18,000 dong, the biggest decline since Sept. 14.  Rubber retreated from its highest level in a month as
Japan’s machinery orders unexpectedly fell in October and before
European leaders meet to discuss the region’s sovereign-debt
crisis.  Phu Nhuan Jewelry Joint-Stock Co. (PNJ)  , Vietnam’s only
listed jewelry manufacturer, slumped 4.4 percent to 38,800 dong,
the most since Oct. 11.  Gold declined after holdings in exchange-traded products
fell from a record and the European Central Bank was seen
cutting interest rates today before a regional leaders’ summit
intended to tackle the debt crisis.  Sao Ta Foods Joint-Stock Co. (FMC)  , which processes
food, gained 0.9 percent to 11,300 dong. The company plans to
pay a dividend of 1,500 dong per share on Jan. 10, according to
an exchange statement.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
