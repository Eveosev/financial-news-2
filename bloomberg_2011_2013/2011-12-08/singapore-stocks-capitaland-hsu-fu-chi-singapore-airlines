Singapore ’s  Straits Times Index 
declined 1.7 percent to 2,736.10 as of 10:20 a.m. local time.
Eight stocks fell for each that rose in the benchmark gauge of
30 companies.  The following shares were among the most active in the
market. Stock symbols are in parentheses after the company
names.  Developers: Singapore imposed additional taxes on purchases
of private residential property to curb excessive investment
that may spur economic and banking-industry risks, sending
shares of real estate companies plunging by the most in more
than two years.  CapitaLand Ltd. (CAPL)  , Southeast Asia’s biggest
developer, slumped 6.9 percent to S$2.43, heading for its
biggest decline since April 2009.  City Developments Ltd. (CIT)  , Singapore’s second-biggest homebuilder, tumbled 7.4 percent
to S$9.28, poised for its worst performance since September
2009.  Keppel Land Ltd. (KPLD)   decreased 7.6 percent to
S$2.43.  Hsu Fu Chi International Ltd. (HFCI)  , a China-based
snack and candy maker, gained 2.4 percent to S$4.34. The company
said Chinese regulators approved the proposed acquisition by
Nestle SA, the world’s largest food company, of a 60 percent
stake Hsu Fu Chi. Nestle in July offered S$2.07 billion ($1.6
billion), or S$4.35 a share, for the stake.  Singapore Airlines Ltd. (SIA)  , the world’s second-
biggest carrier by market value, slipped 1.4 percent to S$10.24.
The airline industry’s profit next year will fall 49 percent to
$3.5 billion as the sovereign-debt crisis in Europe hurts
economic growth, the International Air Transport Association
said yesterday. The trade group forecast in September that
global airline earnings in 2012 would total $4.9 billion.  Tiger Airways Holdings Ltd. (TGR)  , the budget carrier
partly owned by Singapore Airlines, dropped 2.3 percent to 64.5
Singapore cents. The company said it and partners, including
Thai Airways International Pcl and Ryanthai Ltd., decided not to
proceed with setting up a venture in Thailand after failing to
acquire approvals from the Thai authorities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
