The housing market collapse,
historically low interest rates and corporations stingy with
dividends helped cut the median household income in two of every
three U.S. counties, the U.S. Census Bureau reported today.  The number of American households that made money from
rent, interest or dividends fell by one-third to 24.2 percent in
2010, even in affluent counties including those that encompass
 New York City  and  San Francisco .  The census figures capture the lost financial opportunity
experienced by Americans during a decade that saw the dot-com
bust and then the worst recession since the Great Depression.  “We were expecting back in 2000 that our 401(k) would grow
4 to 6 percent a year,” said Gayle Thompkins, 68, a resident of
 Green Valley , Arizona, whose husband used to work for  Dow
Chemical Co. (DOW)  when the couple lived in  Michigan . “Right now, if
we break even, we’ll feel lucky.”  The plunge in the number of households with dividend,
interest or rental income spanned the country, falling to 29.8
percent from 39 percent in 2000 in  Manhattan ; dropping to 13.1
percent from 23.5 percent in Miami; and declining to 50.3
percent from 69.6 percent in Anchorage.  “Over the last decade, income provided by financial market
returns has declined, and pretty meaningfully,” Guy LeBas,
chief fixed-income strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott LLC in
Philadelphia, said in a telephone interview. “Consumer incomes
are beginning the decade off at a lower starting point.”  Alaska Cushion  The census figures were released as part of the five-year
version of the American Community Survey, an annual poll of 3.5
million U.S. households that replaced the decennial census long-
form survey.  In 2000, 16 counties with more than 100,000 households had
a majority report they received income from interest, dividends
or rentals. Anchorage, where full-time residents last year
received an average $1,281 dividend from a state fund created by
oil revenue, was the only one in 2010.  Nationwide, median household income fell to $51,914, a
$2,678 drop over the decade when adjusted for inflation. Black
households lost the most, with median household income falling 8
percent to $35,194. Hispanics reported $41,354, a 5.5 percent
drop. The figure for white, non-Hispanic households fell to
$56,466, a 4.3 percent decrease over the decade. Asian
households reported $68,950, a 2.2 percent gain.  Impact on Affluent  Households in traditionally affluent areas, such as the  New
Jersey  suburbs of Hunterdon, Somerset and Morris counties -- the
sixth, ninth and 10th-wealthiest in the nation -- showed median
income losses over the decade. Incomes fell in Westchester
County,  New York , to $79,619, a $3,037 drop; Putnam County, to
$89,218, a $4,744 decline; and $82,534 in Rockland County, a
$5,828 fall.  The greatest declines occurred in Great Lakes states and
southern Appalachia. People in 82 of Michigan’s 83 counties
reported household incomes dropping between 2000 and 2010.
Households in Livingston County, about 45 miles northwest of 
 Detroit , registered the largest drop in the nation, with incomes
falling to $72,129, a $15,491 decrease from the 2000 real median
of $87,620.  “This is the absolute nadir for us,” said Lou Glazer,
president of Michigan Future Inc., an Ann Arbor-based non-profit
research group. During the last decade, 94 percent of the
state’s income growth came from government payments rather than
private-industry sources, Glazer said.  Declining Dividend Payouts  Dividend payouts declined for the broader U.S. market
between 2003 and 2010. The amount of dividends paid out as a
percent of net income declined to 55.5 percent from 80.5 percent
in that period, according to Russell 3000 Index data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Prices for existing U.S. homes fell over the decade in one
of five U.S. counties, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Pitkin County,  Colorado , homeowners were hardest hit. The median
value of a home in the central  Colorado  county, home to the
Aspen/Snowmass ski complex, fell $304,800, almost 10 times the
decline in Oakland County, Michigan, the second-biggest loser.  The median sales price was $1.2 million for the 63 homes
sold during the third quarter of 2010 in the Aspen area, said
Ryan McMaken, chief economist for the Colorado Division of
Housing. During the third quarter of 2011, 68 homes were sold
with a median sales price of $637,000, he said.  “There aren’t a lot of fire sales, but there hasn’t been
the sort of demand that existed prior to the financial crisis,”
McMaken said. “It’s pretty clear there have been some
declines.”  Real-Estate Hangover  Even counties that gained the most during the real estate
boom didn’t end the decade much better. The median value of a
home in Maricopa County,  Arizona , climbed to $238,600 from an
inflation-adjusted $167,960 in 2000, a 4.2 percent annual return
over the decade.  The next decade isn’t starting well for the next generation
of workers, the census data showed. Civilian  unemployment  among
16 to 24 year olds rose to 16.7 percent in 2010, almost double
the November U.S. jobless rate of 8.6 percent and a 23.7 percent
increase from a decade ago.  In 2000, two counties had a young adult unemployment rate
that topped 50 percent. Ten years later, 18 counties reported a
majority of unemployed among 16 to 24 year olds. Carroll County
in  Mississippi ’s Delta region reported the nation’s highest
youth unemployment rate in 2010, rising to 81.7 percent from
22.4 percent in 2000.  The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported in June 2010 that
younger workers made up 13.9 percent of the total  labor force 
and 19.5 percent of all workers unemployed for 27 months or
more.  “The fact that a huge portion of the unemployed have been
out of work for more than a year really suggests that the income
stagnation is a long-term phenomenon,” said LeBas of Janney
Montgomery Scott.  To contact the reporters on this story: Frank Bass in Washington
