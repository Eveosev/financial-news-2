Canadaâ€™s new home  price index  rose
for a seventh month in October, led by gains in  Edmonton  and
Toronto, the government statistics agency said.  The index advanced 0.2 percent, unchanged from a 0.2
percent gain in September,  Statistics Canada  said today in
Ottawa. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg News expected a 0.2
percent gain, the median estimate in a Bloomberg  survey  with 10
responses.  The increase was driven by a 0.6 percent gain in Edmonton,
and a rise of 0.4 percent in Toronto and Oshawa. Prices in
Victoria dropped 0.6 percent, while they fell 0.3 percent in
Saskatoon and 0.1 percent in  Vancouver .  From a year earlier, new-home prices increased 2.5 percent
in October.  To contact the reporter on this story:
