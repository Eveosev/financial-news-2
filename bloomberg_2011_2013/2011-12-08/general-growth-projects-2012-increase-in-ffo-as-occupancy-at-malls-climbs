General Growth Properties Inc. (GGP) , the
second-largest U.S. mall owner, said that its funds from
operations excluding some items may rise to as much as $1.03 a
share next year as occupancies rise.  The forecast, which has a low end of 99 cents, compares
with expected 2011 “core” FFO of 93 cents to 95 cents, the
real estate investment trust said in an investor presentation
filed today with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  General Growth, which left  bankruptcy protection  13 months
ago, is refinancing debt to cut expenses and plans to expand,
redevelop and refurbish properties to boost growth. In October,
the Chicago-based company sold Faneuil Hall Marketplace in
Boston, the office and garage components of Westlake Center in
 Seattle  and a shopping center in Provo,  Utah , as it focuses on
regional malls.  Occupancy probably will rise to 92 percent in 2012 from
90.5 percent this year, according to General Growth, which is
holding an investor conference today in Chicago. The company’s
properties include Water Tower Place on Michigan Avenue in
Chicago and Fashion Show in  Las Vegas .  The REIT was expected to have 2012 FFO of 98 cents a share,
the average estimate of 10 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. FFO
is a measure of a property owner’s ability to generate cash.  General Growth is planning to spin off 30 malls to
shareholders through a special dividend. They will be
transferred to a new publicly traded REIT, Rouse Properties Inc.
General Growth spent $11.3 billion to buy developer Rouse Co. in
2004. Excluding properties to be included in Rouse, core FFO is
likely to be 90 cents to 94 cents next year, General Growth
said.  General Growth rose 0.6 percent to $14.29 in New York
trading yesterday.  Simon Property Group Inc. (SPG) , based in Indianapolis, is the
only U.S. mall owner larger than General Growth.  To contact the reporter on this story:
