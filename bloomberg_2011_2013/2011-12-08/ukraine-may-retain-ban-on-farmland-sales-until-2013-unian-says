Ukraine may retain a ban on the sale
of farmland until 2013,  Unian  reported, citing lawmaker Hryhoriy
Kaletnyk, head of the parliamentary committee for agriculture
and land.  The committee has prepared a draft bill on the farmland
market and sees sales from 2013, the Kiev-based  news agency 
said. Lawmakers may vote on the bill today. President  Viktor Yanukovych  said in April that Ukraine would start farmland sales
from Jan. 1 next year.  The sale of agricultural land is now banned in Ukraine, and
food production companies lease plots from individual owners.
Ukraine has 41.6 million hectares (103 million acres) of
agricultural land, according to the Agriculture Ministry
data, of which arable land accounts for 32.48 million hectares.
About 7 million plots of land are individually owned, according
to the Ukrainian Grain Association.  To contact the reporter on this story:
