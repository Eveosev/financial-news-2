Ethanol futures advanced, snapping a
four-day skid in  Chicago  after a report showed increased export
demand for corn.  Futures jumped after the Agriculture Department reported
sales of corn for delivery before Aug. 31 more than doubled from
a week earlier to 695,497 metric tons, signaling increased
competition for U.S. ethanol producers to secure the primary
feedstock for the fuel.  “It made a little push following corn up,” said Matt
Royer, a trader at Biofuelsconnect, a Jupiter, Florida-based
alternative energy broker. “We actually made a move up for the
first time in a while.”  Denatured ethanol for January delivery rose 0.8 cent, or
0.4 percent, to $2.133 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade,
the first gain since Dec. 1. Prices have fallen 10 percent this
year.  In cash market trading, ethanol on the West Coast dipped
7.5 cents, or 3 percent, to $2.425 a gallon and in Chicago the
additive declined 4 cents, or 1.7 percent, to $2.305, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol in the U.S. Gulf slipped 2.5 cents, or 1 percent,
to $2.45 a gallon and in  New York  the biofuel lost 2 cents, or
0.8 percent, to $2.425.  Corn for March delivery increased 7.5 cents, or 1.3
percent, to $6.0025 a bushel in Chicago. One bushel makes at
least 2.75 gallons of ethanol.  To contact the reporter on this story:
