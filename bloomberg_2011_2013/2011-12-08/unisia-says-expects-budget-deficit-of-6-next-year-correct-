(Corrects budget deficit in headline.)  Tunisia ’s budget deficit is likely to
reach 6 percent of gross domestic product next year, Finance
Minister Jaloul Ayad said.  “This year the budget deficit is going to end up at 4
percent,” Ayed told a news conference today, adding “the
country will be lucky if the deficit will not increase to 6
percent next year.”  The government is trying to avoid a deficit increase to
protect its  credit rating , Ayed said. He said that if the
deficit increases to eight, nine or 10 percent, Tunisia could
lose its investment grade.  The draft budget, submitted to the cabinet in November,
estimates that the economy will recover and grow 4.5 percent in
2012. Tunisia’s GDP grew 3.7 percent in 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
