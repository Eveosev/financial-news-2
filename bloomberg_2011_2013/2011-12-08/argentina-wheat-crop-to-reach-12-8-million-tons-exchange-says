Argentina ,  Latin America â€™s largest
wheat grower, will produce 12.8 million metric tons of the grain
during the 2011-2012 harvest, 3.2 percent more than previously
estimated, the Rosario Cereals Exchange said.  Better weather conditions in the Southeast part of the
Buenos Aires province is boosting productivity, the Exchange
said in a  release  on its website yesterday.  The wheat crop was previously estimated at 12.4 million
tons, according to a Nov. 11  report  from the Exchange.  To contact the reporters on this story:
