Oxford University defeated Cambridge
University 28-10 in rugby union’s 130th  Varsity Match , giving
the Dark Blues consecutive victories for the first time since
they won three straight in 2000-02.  Will Kane, Karl Outen and Tom Mitchell touched down as
 Oxford  outscored Cambridge three tries to one at Twickenham
Stadium in  London . Cassian Bramham-Law kicked 11 points.  “I think it’s pretty hard to discount every effort from
one to 15 today,” Outen, who was named the Man of the Match,
told Sky Sports. “Today was easily our best effort of the
year.”  Steve Townend kicked a penalty for  Cambridge , which also
was awarded a penalty try. The Light Blues hold a 61 to 55
advantage in the series, with 14 ties.  Townend opened the scoring with a third-minute penalty
before Kane went over and Bramham-Law converted to give Oxford a
7-3 lead. Bramham-Law added a penalty in the 17th minute to push
the advantage to seven points.  Oxford’s John Hudson denied Cambridge a try in the 22nd
minute when he dived between two Light Blues to touch a loose
ball that had crossed the goal line. Cambridge, however, was
awarded a penalty try less than a minute later with Townend’s
conversion tying the score 10-10.  Bramham-Law kicked his second penalty in the 30th minute to
give Oxford a 13-10 lead, which it took into halftime after
Townend missed a late penalty attempt.  15-0 Run  Oxford dominated after the break by outscoring Cambridge
15-0. Outen followed the pack in for a try after a line-out
early in the second half and Bramham-Law booted a penalty to
make it 21-10 after 56 minutes.  Tom Mitchell then closed the scoring with a 71st-minute
try, which was converted by Matt Janney, to seal Oxford’s third
Varsity Match victory in four years.  “I’m exhausted, but elated,” Oxford captain John Carter,
his left eye almost closed by a large welt after being punched
by Cambridge’s Dave Allen in the first half, told  Sky Sports .
“It’s a team spirit. Cambridge were aggressive but you just
have to want it more. It’s awesome.”  Today’s match marked the return of the series tradition of
former captains serving as assistant referees.  Ross Blake, who captained Cambridge to victory in 2007, and
his Oxford counterpart in that game Joe Roff, who won the  Rugby
World Cup  with  Australia  in 1999, assisted referee Dave Pearson.
It was the first time since the 1997 game that ex-captains ran
the touchline, with a professional referee and assistants
handling the duties since.  To contact the reporter on this story:
