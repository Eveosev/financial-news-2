Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA (BBVA) ,
 Spain ’s second-biggest lender, is cutting 150 employees in its
wholesale banking division as it trims staffing in line with
reduced business levels.  The cuts are equivalent to 4 percent of the staff employed
in the unit, a spokesman for the Bilbao, Spain-based lender said
in a phone interview today.  Profit from BBVA’s wholesale banking unit fell 13 percent
in the first nine months of the year from the same period of
2010, the bank said in October.  To contact the reporter on this story:
