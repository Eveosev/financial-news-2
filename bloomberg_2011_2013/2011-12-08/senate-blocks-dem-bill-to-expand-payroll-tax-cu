The  U.S. Senate  blocked a Democratic
proposal to expand a payroll tax cut for workers in 2012 and pay
for it in part by imposing a 1.9 percent surtax on income
exceeding $1 million.  With 50 senators voting for the measure and 48 against it,
the bill fell short of the 60 votes needed to advance the
legislation.  The legislation would have cut the Social Security payroll
tax paid by workers from 4.2 percent to 3.1 percent on the first
$110,100 of income in 2012.  The billâ€™s $185 billion cost also would have been covered
by raising the guarantee fees  Fannie Mae (FNMA)  and Freddie Mac charge
to lenders and by means-testing eligibility for unemployment
compensation and  food stamps .  Unless Congress acts, employees will begin paying 6.2
percent of their wages in a Social Security payroll tax on Jan.
