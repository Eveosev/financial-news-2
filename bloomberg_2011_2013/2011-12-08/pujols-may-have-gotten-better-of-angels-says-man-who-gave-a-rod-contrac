Albert Pujols  may have gotten a
better deal than the  Los Angeles Angels  with his new contract,
said  Michael Cramer , who was president of the  Texas Rangers  when
they gave  Alex Rodriguez  $252 million over 10 years.  Pujols, a three-time National League Most Valuable Player
with the  St. Louis Cardinals , agreed to a 10-year deal with the
Angels yesterday that’s worth between $250 million and $260
million, according to Yahoo Sports. Pujols turns 32 next month
and would be 42 at the end of the deal in 2021.  “A long-term contract for this kind of money for somebody
in that age bracket is off the wall,” Cramer, the director of
the  Texas  Program in Sports and Media at the University of Texas
at Austin, said in a telephone interview. “I don’t think it’s a
good investment.”  Pujols, who spent his first 11 seasons with the Cardinals
and won two World Series titles, may be getting a deal with an
average annual value that rivals the Major League Baseball-
record 10-year, $275 million deal Rodriguez signed with the  New
York Yankees  in 2007.  “It was all about getting an A-Rod type of a deal and
going on the mantle as a guy who deserves this type of money,”
Wayne McDonnell, who created the “Business of Baseball” course
at  New York University , said in a telephone interview.  Pujols, a Gold Glove-winning first baseman with a
career .328 batting average and 445 home runs, would be only the
third player in baseball history with a contract worth more than
$200 million, after Rodriguez’s two deals.  Tulowitzki, Braun  Colorado Rockies shortstop Troy Tulowitzki got a 10-year,
$157 million contract in December 2010, while Milwaukee Brewers
outfielder  Ryan Braun  agreed last year on a reworked deal that
would pay him $145.5 million over 10 seasons. Tulowitzki is 27
years old and Braun is 28.  Rodriguez was 25 when he signed his 10-year contract with
the Rangers. That agreement was reached at baseball’s Winter
Meetings held in  Dallas , which was also the site of this week’s
gathering. Rodriguez was 32 and coming off a third American
League MVP award and a 54-home run season when he landed his
record deal with the Yankees in 2007.  “When we signed him in Texas he was in his 20s and he
hadn’t missed a game,” Cramer said. “He was playing 159, 160,
161 games a year and the guy was almost indestructible. Pujols
has been pretty sound physically but doesn’t even have the
staying power that A-Rod did, and A-Rod broke down.”  Rodriguez, now 36, was limited to 99 games last season
because of injuries and hit a career-low 16 home runs after 30-
home run campaigns in 2009 and 2010. In 2009, he admitted to
using performance-enhancing drugs over a three-year period
beginning in 2001.  Breaking Down  “We can speculate whether it was the drugs, or the lack of
drugs, that has caused A-Rod to break down and lose some of his
skills,” Cramer said. “He was as solid an athlete and
consistent performer as anyone I’ve ever seen, and he broke down.
Would you pay $20 million a year for A-Rod now for the next six
years if you had the choice?”  Dave Roher, the outgoing president of the Harvard Sports
Analysis Collective, said statistics for Hall-of-Fame caliber
players such as Pujols and Rodriguez can be harder to compare or
project against their peers.  “If you look at the aging curves of Hall of Famers, they
have some of the most productive seasons when they’re older,”
Roher said in a telephone interview. “These really great
players tend to stick around a little bit longer.”  Aaron’s Dropoff  Hank Aaron , who ranks second in baseball history with 755
home runs, hit 40 homers at age 39. He dropped to 20 the
following season and 12 in 1975 at age 41.  Babe Ruth  is third all-time in home runs and hit at least
40 every season for the Yankees from 1926 until 1933. He dropped
to 34 at age 38 and then 22 the following season, his last full
year in the majors.  Pujols, a nine-time All-Star and the 2001 NL Rookie of the
Year, has yet to hit fewer than 32 home runs in a season since
coming up in 2001.  The 2010 season was Pujols’s first without 100 runs batted
in, as he finished with 99 for the World Series-champion
Cardinals and missed about two weeks after breaking a bone in
his forearm. Even with his offensive production, McDonnell, an
associate professor of sports management at NYU, said he’s
surprised Angels owner Arturo Moreno is spending so much.  “When you’re paying a player that much, you know you’re
going to lose at some point,” McDonnell said. “It’s completely
surprising and uncharacteristic of Moreno, a guy who has
developed a reputation of being an aggressive owner, but a very
smart owner.”  Age Not a Concern  Angels General Manager Jerry Dipoto, speaking at a news
conference in Dallas yesterday, said he wouldn’t discuss the
length or financial terms of the contract.  “Pujols’s age is not a concern,” Dipoto said. “He hits
like he’s 27.”  Moreno, who once was a co-owner of the advertising company
Outdoor Systems Inc., bought the team from the  Walt Disney Co. (DIS) 
in 2003 for about $180 million. The purchase price would be $70
million to $80 million less than what the team has committed to
Pujols, according to the Yahoo Sports report.  “We could be dealing with a situation where Pujols could
be very productive for five years, but they’re going to be
grossly overpaying for a ballplayer into his 40s,” McDonnell
said.  The Angels have missed the playoffs the past two years
after making the postseason six times in an eight-year span and
winning the 2002 World Series. At 86-76, they finished second in
the AL West this year behind a Rangers team that’s made back-to-
back trips to the  World Series .  “They’re used to winning and I think they’re smarting a
little bit over the last couple of years,” Cramer said of the
Angels. “I just don’t think it’s a good move, and historically
I don’t think it bodes well for the last few years.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
