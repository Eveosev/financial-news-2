Asia ’s naphtha crack fell. Royal
Dutch Shell Plc paid a reduced premium for low-sulfur gasoil in
 Singapore , the region’s largest oil-trading center.  Light Distillates  Naphtha’s  premium  to London-traded Brent crude futures, a
measure of the profit from the petrochemicals and gasoline
feedstock, fell to $82.40 a metric ton at 6:25 p.m. Singapore
time from $85 at the end of Asian trading yesterday.  Middle Distillates  Shell bought 150,000 barrels of  gasoil , or diesel, with 10
parts-per-million of sulfur from Gunvor Group Ltd. in Singapore,
according to a Bloomberg survey of traders monitoring
transactions on the Platts window. The price was $3.30 a barrel
above benchmark quotes, the smallest premium reported for ultra-
low-sulfur diesel since Oct. 14.  Shell sold 250,000 barrels of gasoil with 0.5 percent
sulfur to Total SA at 50 cents a barrel over quotes, the survey
showed. The cargo is for Dec. 23 to Dec. 27, the earliest
loading period.  Gasoil’s premium to Asian marker Dubai crude dropped 12
cents to $18.83 a barrel at 3:02 p.m. Singapore time, based on
data from PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a broker. Yesterday, this
 crack spread  was the widest in two weeks.  Jet fuel’s premium to gasoil fell 15 cents to 95 cents a
barrel, PVM data showed. This  regrade  is the narrowest so far
this month, indicating it is less profitable to produce  aviation
fuel  over diesel.  Fuel Oil  PetroChina Co. bought 20,000 tons of  180-centistoke  fuel
oil from China International United Petroleum & Chemical Corp.
in Singapore, paying $13 a ton over benchmark quotes, according
to the Bloomberg survey. The cargo will load between Dec. 23 and
Dec. 27. PetroChina sold a similar cargo for Jan. 3 to Jan. 7
loading to Hin Leong Trading Pte at a $5 premium to December
prices, the survey showed.  Fuel oil ’s  discount  to Dubai crude narrowed 18 cents to
$5.82 a barrel at 3:02 p.m. Singapore time, based on PVM data.
Yesterday, the gap was the biggest since Sept. 15, signaling
losses for refiners turning oil into residual products.  The premium of 180-centistoke fuel oil to  380-centistoke 
grade, or the  viscosity spread , was unchanged after rising to
$14.25 a ton, PVM said. This means bunker, or marine fuel, moved
in tandem with higher-quality fuel oil.  To contact the reporters on this story:
