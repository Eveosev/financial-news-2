A benchmark gauge of U.S. company
credit risk snapped an eight-day decline, the longest stretch
this year, after European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi 
damped speculation of further bond purchases.  The Markit CDX North America Investment Grade Index of
credit-default swaps, which investors use to hedge against
losses on company debt or to speculate on creditworthiness rose
1.8 basis points to a mid-price of 121.4 basis points as of 9:22
a.m. in  New York , according to data provider Markit Group Ltd.
The index, which typically falls as investor confidence improves
and rises as it deteriorates, had declined from 146 on Nov. 25.  The measure rose after Draghi said the ECBâ€™s bond-purchase
program was not eternal or infinite, curbing optimism that the
central bank will increase purchases of debt of struggling
European nations.  Traders pushed the index higher even as fewer Americans
than forecast filed applications for  unemployment benefits  last
week. Jobless claims dropped by 23,000 to 381,000 in the week
ended Dec. 3, Labor Department figures showed today in
 Washington . The median forecast of 47 economists in a Bloomberg
News survey called for a drop to 395,000.  To contact the reporter on this story:
