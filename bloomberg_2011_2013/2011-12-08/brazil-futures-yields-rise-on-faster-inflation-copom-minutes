Yields on most Brazilian interest-
rate futures contracts rose for the first time in three days
after inflation quickened in November and policy makers signaled
they will maintain their pace of cuts to borrowing costs,
spurring traders to pare bets on deeper reductions.  Yields on the futures contract due in January 2013 rose
eight basis points, or 0.08 percentage point, to 9.82 percent at
9:59 a.m. in  Sao Paulo . The real snapped two days of losses,
rising 0.2 percent to 1.7965 per dollar, from 1.7996 yesterday.  The central bank targets inflation of 4.5 percent, plus or
minus two percentage points. Policy makers expect it to slow to
“around” that target next year as the global crisis damps
domestic activity and commodities prices, according to the
minutes of their meeting last month. Consumer prices, as
measured by the IPCA index, rose 0.52 percent in November, the
national statistics agency said today. That exceeded the median
0.5 percent estimate of 54 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  “The minutes indicate the continuation of moderate
adjustments,” Mauricio Nakahodo, senior economist at CM Capital
Markets, said by phone from Sao Paulo. “The market understands
that the pace of cuts is not going to intensify.”  Inflation has exceeded the upper limit of the target range
since April. Since August, the central bank has cut the Selic
rate three times, bringing it down to 11 percent from 12.5
percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
