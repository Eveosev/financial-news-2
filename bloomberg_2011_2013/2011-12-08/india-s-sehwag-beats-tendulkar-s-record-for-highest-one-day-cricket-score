India ’s Virender Sehwag scored 219
runs today to break the record for highest individual score in
one-day international cricket, surpassing the mark of teammate
 Sachin Tendulkar .  The 33-year-old right-hand batsman hit 32 boundaries in his
149-ball innings which helped lift India to 418-5 against the
West Indies in Indore, its highest one-day total. India won by
153 runs after the West Indies were bowled out for 265.  Sehwag, playing his 240th one-day international, was
dropped on 170 by West Indies captain Darren Sammy before going
on to surpass Tendulkar’s 200 not out set against South Africa
in Gwalior in February 2010.  “It was a true batting wicket, and when I was hitting the
ball into the gaps, it was going for four,” Sehwag was cited as
saying by the British Broadcasting Corp. “When Sammy dropped
the catch I thought ‘God is with me.’”  The Delhi-born Sehwag now has more than 8,000 runs for his
country in 50-overs matches and 7,980 from 92 Test matches. He
has also represented India in 14 Twenty20 matches.  Today, he shared a 176-run opening partnership with  Gautam Gambhir , who was run out for 67. Suresh Raina was also run out,
for 55, to end another century partnership.  Ravindra Jadeja scored 10, Rohit Sharma 27, with Virat
Kohli and Parthiv Patel making an unbeaten 23 and 3 not out
respectively. The West Indies used seven bowlers as they
struggled to contain Sehwag.  In reply, Denesh Ramdin top-scored with 96 for the
visitors, who recovered from 145-7 but never came close to
matching the required run rate and failed to complete their 50
overs. Rahul Sharma and Jadeja each took three wickets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
