Germany ’s Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  might be forced to submit a supplementary budget for
2012 if the European Stability Mechanism is activated next year,
 Sueddeutsche Zeitung  reported, citing Carsten Schneider, the
 Social Democratic Party ’s spokesman in parliament.  Schneider said that if the ESM is activated, Schaeuble will
be missing about 4.3 billion euros ($5.7 billion), according to
the budget that was approved last week, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
