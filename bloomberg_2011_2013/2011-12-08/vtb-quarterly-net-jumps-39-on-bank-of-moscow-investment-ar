VTB Group (VTBR) ,  Russia ’s second-largest
bank, posted a 39 percent rise in third-quarter profit as the
volume of delinquent loans declined,  investment-banking  revenue
increased and it acquired Bank of Moscow.  Net income reached 20.4 billion rubles ($637 Million) from
14.7 billion rubles in the year-earlier period, the state-run
lender said in a statement today. Bad loans declined to 5.9
percent of overall lending from 7.7 percent at the start of the
quarter.  “We are now seeing the positive results of our
acquisitions,”  Herbert Moos , VTB’s deputy chairman, said in a
conference call with analysts today. “They are adding to our
fee income commission and we are also seeing organic growth.”  The acquisition of Bank of Moscow added 587 billion rubles
of corporate loans and 66.4 billion rubles of consumer loans to
VTB’s business in the third quarter, the company said. Russian
regulators in July agreed to a 395 billion-ruble bailout for
Bank of Moscow after VTB bought the city government’s 46.5
percent stake in the lender and uncovered bad debts.  VTB fell 0.2 percent to 6.66 kopeks by 6:05 p.m. in Moscow,
erasing an earlier advance of as much as 2.8 percent.  Investment and corporate banking pretax profit jumped 77
percent to 69.9 billion rubles in the first nine months of the
year from 39.5 billion a year earlier, Moscow-based VTB said.  The based bank had a net trading loss of 10.5 billion
rubles in the quarter and 1.0 billion rubles for the first nine
months of the year. Net profit guidance for 2012 is “lower”
than this year, Moos added.  “The stock is likely to take the news as marginally
positive,”  Luis Saenz , chief executive officer of the U.S. unit
of Moscow-based brokerage Otkritie Financial Corp., wrote in e-
mailed comments today. “Trading losses are hard to predict and
were expected to be substantial.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
