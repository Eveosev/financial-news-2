Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (TEVA) ’s
Cephalon unit won an appeals court decision that prevents  Watson
Pharmaceuticals Inc. (WPI)  from selling a generic copy of the
painkiller Fentora until 2019.  The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in
 Washington  today upheld the validity of a Cephalon patent on
Fentora and backed a lower court ruling that Watson infringed
the patent. The appeals court posted a  notice  of the decision on
its website without a formal opinion explaining its findings.  Fentora is approved to relieve sudden episodes of cancer
pain in adults already taking opioids, or morphine-like drugs.
Cephalon has said the patent that was upheld expires in 2019 and
is for a process of making the tablet dissolve.  The drug generated $81 million in U.S. sales in the first
half, Cephalon said in August.  Petah Tikva , Israel-based Teva
bought Cephalon in October.  The case is Cephalon Inc. v. Watson Pharmaceuticals Inc.,
09cv724, U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware
(Wilmington).  To contact the reporters on this story:
