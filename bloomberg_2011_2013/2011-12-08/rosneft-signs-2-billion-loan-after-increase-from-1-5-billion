OAO Rosneft (ROSN) , Russia’s biggest oil
producer, signed a five-year  credit line  and increased it to $2
billion from $1.5 billion.  The facility is split between $1.4 billion and 470 million-
euro ($627 million) portions, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Both loans pay 1.85 percentage point more than
benchmarks rates.  The euro portion was designed for European lenders with
dollar funding difficulties, said a person with direct knowledge
of the deal, who declined to be identified as the deal is
private. The three-month cross-currency basis swap rate banks
pay to convert euro payments into dollars is 1.165 percentage
point less than the euro interbank offered rate, 14 times more
expensive than on May 4, Bloomberg data show.  Barclays Capital  led the financing and was joined by 14
banks. The Moscow-based oil exporter started talks with lenders
in October to borrow $1.5 billion.  Rustam Kazharov, a spokesman for the Moscow-based exporter,
wasn’t immediately available for comment.  -- Editors: Cecile Gutscher, Faris Khan  To contact the reporter on this story:
