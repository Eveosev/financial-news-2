Green Bay  Packers Inc. might have
kept pace with publicly traded U.S. companies in the past 88
years if the club’s stockholders could buy and sell shares
without restrictions.  The CHART OF THE DAY compares prices at which the Packers
have sold shares since 1923, when the National Football League
team was incorporated, with the  Dow Jones Industrial Average .  Packers fans can buy stock in the only publicly owned U.S.
sports franchise at $250 a share until Feb. 29. The sale got
under way two days ago and raised $400,000 in the first 11
minutes for the team, based in Green Bay,  Wisconsin .  The current sale is the first since 1997, when the stock
fetched $200 a share. Earlier sales were made in 1950 and 1935,
as well as 1923. The prices depicted in the chart are adjusted
for a 1,000-for-1 split, completed before the 1997 sale.  Owners of Packers shares can only transfer them to members
of their immediate family, according to the sale’s  prospectus .
The team can buy back any shares that change hands improperly
for 2.5 cents each, or 1/10,000th of the current sale price.  The Packers are organized as a non-profit company, so
shareholders aren’t entitled to dividends on their investment or
proceeds from a sale of the team. The prospectus adds this
warning: “It is virtually impossible for anyone to realize a
profit on a purchase of Common Stock.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
