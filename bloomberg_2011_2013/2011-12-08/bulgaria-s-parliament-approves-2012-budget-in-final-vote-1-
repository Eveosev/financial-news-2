Bulgaria’s Parliament approved a 2012
budget aimed at cutting the deficit and weathering the effect of
the euro area’s sovereign-debt crisis.  The budget envisages economic expansion of 2.9 percent,
while spending and revenue are calculated on a 1 percent-1.5
percent growth assumption as a precaution against the euro
crisis, Menda Stoyanova, head of the Budget and Finance
Committee, said today.  “This is a tight budget, intended to withstand potential
shocks from current developments in the euro area,” Stoyanova
told Parliament in the capital, Sofia.  Bulgaria, the  European Union’s  poorest country in terms of
 economic  output per capita, withstood the global recession in
2009 without an international bailout. Its economic growth
slowed to 1.6 percent from a year earlier in the third quarter,
the weakest in five quarters, as demand for exports among the
country’s main trading partners dwindled.  The government will target a  budget deficit  of 1.35 percent
of gross domestic product and average inflation of 3.2 percent
in 2012, according to the budget. This year, growth is estimated
at 2.8 percent and the budget deficit at 2 percent.  Export growth is estimated to shrink to 5.4 percent in 2012
after a planned increase of 11.7 percent this year. The
government will leave corporate and personal taxes unchanged at
10 percent, an EU low, to attract foreign investment.  International Bonds  Bulgaria may sell securities worth as much as 2 billion lev
($1.37 billion) on international markets to repay 1.8 billion
lev of global bonds maturing in January 2013, Finance Minister
 Simeon Djankov  said in October. The same option existed in the
2011 and 2010 budgets and wasn’t used.  Next year’s public debt may rise to 15.3 billion lev, 18.7
percent of GDP, from an estimated 16 percent this year,
according to the budget.  The government plans to sell 1.2
billion lev of bonds domestically. It sold 514 million lev of
bonds in the year through July.  Spending in 2012 is planned at 35.4 percent of GDP, or 29
billion lev, compared with 35.7 percent this year, while revenue
is estimated at 28.7 billion lev, or 35.2 percent of GDP,
compared with 34.2 percent in 2011, according to the budget.  Lawmakers also approved a plan to increase the pension age
in increments of four months per year starting in 2012 until it
reaches 65 for men and 63 for women, compared with 63 and 60
now. That would help save 30 million lev next year, Bisser
Petkov, head of the state pension fund, told reporters in Sofia
today.  Raiffeisen Bank International AG  cut Bulgaria’s 2012
economic growth forecast today to 1.2 percent from a previous
estimate of 2 percent on expectations that a possible recession
in the euro area will reduce demand for the nation’s exports.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
