KME Group SpA (KME)  and Greek metals
processor  Halcor SA (XAKO)  lost European Union top court appeals over
cartel fines.  The antitrust penalties against the companies should stand,
the EU Court of Justice in Luxembourg said in rulings today.  KME appealed fines levied in two separate cartels in 2003
and in 2004, respectively. A lower EU court in 2009 rejected the
company’s first challenge to the 2003 fine of 39.8 million euros
($53.3 million). In 2004, KME was fined 67.1 million euros and
Halcor 9.16 million euros in another cartel. Halcor’s fine was
cut to 8.25 million euros by a lower EU court in 2010.  The European Commission, the 27-nation EU’s antitrust
regulator, fined three companies in 2003, including  Outokumpu
Oyj (OUT1V)  and Wieland-Werke AG, a total of 79 million euros for a
cartel between 1988 and 2001 in the market for copper tubes used
in air conditioning and refrigeration. A few months later, the
regulator levied a 222.3 million-euro penalty on companies
including KME and Halcor in the water, heating and gas tubes
market.  Today’s ruling confirms the lower court’s decision which
largely backed the EU antitrust authority, the Brussels-based
regulator said in an e-mailed statement.  Halcor will examine the ruling and has already set
aside 5 million euros to cover part of the fine, according to a
filing the company made to the Athens bourse. Francesco
Giubilei, a spokesman for Florence, Italy-based KME said he
couldn’t comment because it’s a national holiday.  The cases are: C-272/09 P, KME and Others v. European
Commission, C-389/10 P, KME  Germany  and Others v. Commission.  To contact the reporter on this story:
