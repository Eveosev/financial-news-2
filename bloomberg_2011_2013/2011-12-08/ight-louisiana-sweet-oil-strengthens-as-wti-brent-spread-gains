U.S. Gulf Coast oil premiums were
little changed as the difference between West Texas Intermediate
and Brent narrowed.  The gap between the two benchmark crude futures for January
delivery decreased 56 cents to $9.21 a barrel. The spread has
narrowed 67 percent since reaching a record of $27.88 a barrel
Oct. 14.  When Brent decreases versus WTI, it weakens the value of
low-sulfur U.S. grades that compete with West African oil priced
against the European benchmark.  Light Louisiana Sweet ’s premium to WTI increased 15 cents
to $11.45 a barrel at 3:46 p.m. in  New York , according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Heavy Louisiana Sweet’s  premium added 15
cents to $11.90.  Poseidon  lost 5 cents to $6.20 a barrel over WTI.  Southern
Green Canyon ’s premium decreased 10 cents to $5.90 a barrel and
 West Texas Sour ’s discount narrowed 5 cents to 80 cents.  Thunder Horse’s premium to WTI added 25 cents to $9.50. The
premium for Mars Blend increased 30 cents to $7.10 a barrel.  The discount for  Western Canada Select  was unchanged at
$14.75.  Syncrude ’s premium narrowed 40 cents to $2.30 a barrel, the
smallest since January. Syncrude is a light, low-sulfur
synthetic oil derived from the tar sands in  Alberta .  To contact the reporter on this story:
