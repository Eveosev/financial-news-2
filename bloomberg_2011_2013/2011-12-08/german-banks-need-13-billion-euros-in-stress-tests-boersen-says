German banks will need to boost their
capital levels by about 13 billion euros ($17.3 billion) instead
of the previously estimated 9.6 billion euros to meet
regulatorsâ€™ stress-test requirements,  Boersen-Zeitung reported ,
citing unidentified people in the market.  The reason for the increase is that measures taken to
strengthen equity were only recognized if completed by the end
of September, the German newspaper said. Norddeutsche Landesbank
Girozentrale will need to boost capital by 2.3 billion euros to
2.6 billion euros instead of 660 million euros, according to a
preliminary report, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
