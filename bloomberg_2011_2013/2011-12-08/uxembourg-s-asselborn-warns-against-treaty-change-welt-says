Luxembourg Foreign Minister Jean Asselborn warned the German government against pushing for a
change to the European Union treaty,  Die Welt  reported, citing
an interview.  The “vital and effective short-term objective” should be
to stabilize the euro region, while large-scale amendments to
the treaty would be cumbersome and difficult to implement and
should be “secondary,” the newspaper cited Asselborn as saying
in an e-mailed preview of an article to be published today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
