Eni SpA (ENI) ,  Italy ’s largest oil company,
can run its refineries without Iranian crude if the European
Union decides to ban fuel imports from the Persian Gulf state,
its chief executive officer said.  “In terms of the use of our own refineries I don’t see
major problems,”  Paolo Scaroni  said today in Doha, Qatar.
“Yes, there is a problem of quality of crude, so we should make
some shift, but our refineries will be certainly able to cope
with these issues.”  The EU agreed this month to tighten sanctions on Iran,
blacklisting certain individuals and companies, while falling
short of authorizing an immediate ban on Iranian crude imports
amid reservations from  Greece . The U.S. approved additional
curbs on Iran’s oil industry on Nov. 21.  Eni is more concerned about the crude it receives from Iran
as payment for past production there, Scaroni said. The company
is owed less than $2 billion from the Islamic Republic for past
activities, he said.  “We feel this kind of transaction will be exempted from
any ban,” Scaroni said at a press conference at the World
Petroleum Congress in the Qatari capital. “There is a
difference between importing crude and receiving crude as
payment for previous activity.”  Scaroni’s comments echo those of  Total SA (FP) ’s CEO Christophe de Margerie. A ban would only create a temporary disruption as
buyers of Iranian crude adjusted their refineries to alternative
grades, de Margerie said yesterday in Doha. An oil ban wouldn’t
hurt Iran, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
