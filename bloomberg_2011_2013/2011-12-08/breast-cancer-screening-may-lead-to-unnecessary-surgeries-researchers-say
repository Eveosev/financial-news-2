Screening for  breast cancer  may cause
more harm than good because it leads to unnecessary surgery,
British researchers said.  Screening may lead to abnormal results that turn out to be
normal and treatment of harmless cancers that would never have
caused symptoms or death, according to  research  led by James
Raftery, a professor of health-technology assessment at the
University of Southampton. The study, published in the British
Medical Journal, analyzed 100,000 women ages 50 and over and
found that the inclusion of false positives and unnecessary
surgery reduced the benefits of screening by half.  The study follows the Forrest report of 1986, which
measured costs and benefits from screening in quality-adjusted
life years. That study omitted harmful effects from screening,
the researchers said.  “Harms largely offset the gains up to 10 years, after
which the gains accumulate at an increasing rate,” Raftery
wrote in the published paper. “The meaning and implications of
overdiagnosis and overtreatment need to be much better explained
and communicated to any woman considering screening.”  More research is required on the extent of unnecessary
treatment and the impact on quality of life, the researchers
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
