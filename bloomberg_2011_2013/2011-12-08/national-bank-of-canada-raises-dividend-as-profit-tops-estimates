National Bank of Canada (NA) , the last of
 Canada ’s eight main banks to report quarterly results, said
profit climbed 2.4 percent on consumer banking and asset
management. The bank increased its dividend for the second time
in a year.  Net income for the period ended Oct. 31 rose to C$294
million ($291.4 million), or C$1.74 a share, from C$287 million,
or C$1.66, a year earlier, the Montreal-based bank said today in
a statement. It was the fifth straight quarter of profit growth.  Asset-management profit climbed 18 percent to C$39 million,
bolstered by the company’s July purchase of Toronto-based
Wellington West Holdings Inc. Canada’s sixth-largest bank has
also agreed to buy the investment-advisory business in Canada of
HSBC Holdings Plc. Domestic banking profit rose 6 percent to
C$156 million.  “Like its peers, earnings in the quarter were not of
terribly high quality,”  John Aiken , an analyst at  Barclays
Capital , wrote in a note to clients.  Before one-time items, profit was C$1.80 a share, beating
the C$1.66-a-share estimate of 15 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg
News.  Dividend Boost  The bank increased its quarterly dividend 6 percent to 75
cents a share. National Bank was expected to increase its payout
to 76 cents a share, according to the Bloomberg Dividend
Forecast, which had an 83 percent accuracy rate in the third
quarter.  For the year, profit climbed 17 percent to a record C$1.21
billion.  National Bank rose 1.1 percent to C$67.18 in 9:59 a.m.
trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange. The shares have fallen 2
percent this year.  National Bank is the last Canadian lender to release
results in the fourth quarter. Seven of the lenders topped
analysts’ estimates.  (National Bank will hold a conference call at 1:30 p.m.
