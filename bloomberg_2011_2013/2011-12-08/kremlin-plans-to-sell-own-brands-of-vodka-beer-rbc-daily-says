The Kremlin plans to sell alcoholic
and soft drinks under its own brand to increase revenue, RBC
Daily reported, citing Victor Khrekov, an official in President

Kremlin Vodka, Kremlin Beer and Kremlin Lemonade, and plans to
license the rights to make those drinks to producers and collect
royalties on sales, the Moscow-based newspaper said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
