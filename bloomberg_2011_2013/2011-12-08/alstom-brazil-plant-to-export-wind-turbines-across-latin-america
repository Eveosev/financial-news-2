Alstom SA (ALO) , the third-largest power-
equipment maker, expects to sell 100 million euros ($133
million) worth of wind turbines a year from its new Brazil
factory to other Latin American countries that are promoting
renewable energy.  The company may export as much as a third of the factory’s
output, Marcos Costa, the Levallois-Perret, France-based
company’s vice president of renewable and thermal power for
 Latin America , said in a telephone interview yesterday, the
first forecast for the plant since it  opened  Nov. 30 in the
northeastern state of Bahia.  “We’ve made progress in Argentina, Chile and Uruguay and
intend to start next year to spread our activities to all Latin
American countries,” he said. “Uruguay and  Argentina  both have
set government auctions” for contracts to sell power from
renewable energy projects.  The facility may complete in 2012 its first turbine
contract with a buyer outside Brazil, he said.  Alstom has eight Latin American factories, all in Brazil.
This is its first turbine plant in the region.  To contact the reporter on this story:
