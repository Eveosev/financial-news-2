The lira depreciated the most in two
weeks after  European Central Bank  reduced speculation that it
would increase debt purchases to fight the region’s crisis,
dampening demand for riskier emerging market assets.  The lira weakened 0.8 percent to 1.8441 per dollar at 5:47
p.m. in Istanbul, heading for the biggest decline since Nov. 25
and raising this year’s losses to 16.3 percent.  European equities and the euro headed lower as ECB
President  Mario Draghi  said he didn’t necessarily signal that
the bank would step up government bond purchases when he spoke
last week, adding that the program was not eternal or infinite.  The lira’s decline is “completely related to Draghi,”
 Murat Toprak , chief emerging market currency strategist for the
region, said in e-mailed comments. “The pressure on the lira
can somewhat increase but the central bank is standing by” the
currency.  The central bank sold at least $9.2 billion since Aug. 5 to
shore up the lira and contain inflation after the currency
became the worst performer among more than 20 emerging market
currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  Yields on the two-year benchmark debt fell five basis
points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 10.28 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
