Cantor Fitzgerald LP increased the
yields on portions of commercial-mortgage bonds it’s marketing
privately, according to a person familiar with the transaction.  The firm may sell $28 million of bonds rated BBB-, the
lowest investment-grade ranking, to yield 950 basis points more
than the benchmark swap rate, said the person, who declined to
be identified because terms aren’t public. The New York-based
broker dealer had been marketing the debt at a spread of 850
basis points, the person said.  A basis point is 0.01 percentage
point.  Wall Street banks arranged about $27.2 billion in bonds
linked to hotel, skyscraper and shopping malls this year,
compared with $11.5 billion in 2010, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. Sales plummeted from a record $232 billion in
2007. Deals arranged since August, including $541.8 million of
the debt sold by Cantor on Dec. 6., have included public
portions to attract broader pools of buyers.  The extra yield investors demand to own top-ranked
commercial-mortgage bonds rather than Treasuries has risen to
261 basis points from this year’s low of 178 basis points on
April 26, according to a Barclays Capital index. The spread has
narrowed from 323 on Oct. 4, the widest since February 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
