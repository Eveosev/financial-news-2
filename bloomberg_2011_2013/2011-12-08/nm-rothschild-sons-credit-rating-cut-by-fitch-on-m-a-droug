NM Rothschild & Sons Ltd., the
family-owned investment bank, had its credit ratings cut by
 Fitch Ratings , which cited the prospects for reduced work
advising on mergers and acquisitions.  Fitch cut NM Rothschild’s long-term rating to BBB+ from A-,
according to its statement today. The bank’s short-term rating
was trimmed to F2 from F1.  The “downgrade reflects the increased exposure of NMR’s
business model to activity levels in the  capital markets ,
especially relating to mergers and acquisitions,” it said.
Fitch sees the “prospect of strong headwinds from the
macroeconomic and operating environment as a source of
vulnerability for the bank’s earnings.”  The deepening debt crisis in  Europe  has discouraged
companies from pursuing deals, with M&A in Europe dropping about
20 percent in the past six months to $253.7 billion from $318.7
billion in the same period a year ago, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
