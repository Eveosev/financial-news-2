The Czech Republic’s  PX (PX)  stock index
fell for a third day, sliding 0.4 percent to 876.3 at its 4:28
p.m. close in Prague.  The following were among the most active equities on the
Prague Stock Exchange today. Stock symbols follow company names.  Komercni Banka AS (KOMB)   dropped 0.8 percent to 3,170
koruna, its biggest three-day decline in a month. The Czech unit
of Societe Generale SA reversed an earlier advance of as much as
3 percent after the  European Central Bank  damped speculation
that it would step up bond purchases to fight the region’s debt
crisis, hurting demand for riskier assets worldwide.  Orco Property Group SA (ORCO)   increased 3 percent to 85
koruna, the biggest gain on the PX benchmark today. The stock
earlier jumped as much as 10 percent after the Czech developer
said it has secured additional financing from Bank Pekao SA for
the Zlota 44 apartment building in Warsaw.  To contact the reporter on this story:
