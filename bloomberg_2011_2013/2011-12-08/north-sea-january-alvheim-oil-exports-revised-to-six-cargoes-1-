Exports of  North Sea  Alvheim crude
for January are revised to six cargoes of 780,000 barrels each,
one more than this month after a shipment was deferred, a
loading program obtained by Bloomberg News showed.  The program totals 4.68 million barrels, or 150,968 barrels
a day, compared with 125,806 barrels a day this month, according
to the plan. One consignment was deferred to early January from
the end of December.  Houston-based Marathon Oil Corp. operates the  field  in the
Norwegian North Sea. Loading programs are monthly schedules of
crude shipments compiled by field operators to allow buyers and
sellers to plan their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
