The ruble weakened for a sixth day
against the dollar, its longest losing streak in four months,
after the  European Central Bank  damped bets it will boost debt
purchases to keep the economy on track, curbing appetite for
riskier assets.  The Russian currency lost 0.2 percent to 31.37 per dollar
at the 7 p.m. close in Moscow. The ruble was little changed at
41.84 per euro, leaving it steady at 36.0815 against the central
bank’s target dollar-euro basket.  ECB President  Mario Draghi  said today he did not
necessarily signal that the central bank would step up
government bond purchases when he spoke last week, adding that
the program was not eternal or infinite. Thousands of people
took to the streets in Moscow earlier this week to protest the
results of parliamentary elections Dec. 4 amid allegations of
vote-rigging.  Today’s rates decision was “a negative signal in terms of
the EU crisis, and that will hit risk appetite,”  Benoit Anne ,
the London-based head of emerging-markets strategy at Societe
Generale SA, said by e-mail. “The only way out is an ECB policy
bazooka, and there’s no signs of that right now.”  As many as 10,000 may attend a rally in Moscow on Dec. 10
near the Kremlin, a spokeswoman for umbrella opposition group
Solidarity said yesterday.  The protests “point to risks of a weaker ruble -- it’s a
one-way street in the short term,” Anne said. “The ruble’s
subject to double-whammy risks -- global risk appetite damaged
by the poor ECB signal, and adverse news flow domestically.”  Investors increased bets the ruble would weaken further,
with non-deliverable forwards showing the currency dropping to
31.8392 per dollar in three months, compared with expectations
of 31.6798 per dollar yesterday.  Russia’s $3.5 billion of bonds due 2020 rose, pushing the
yield down 20 basis points to 4.413 percent. Ruble notes due
July 2015 yielded nine basis points less at 7.76 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
