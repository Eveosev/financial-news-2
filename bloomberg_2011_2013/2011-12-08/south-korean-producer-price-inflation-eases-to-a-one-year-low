South Korean producer prices rose at
the slowest pace in a year in November as vegetable and fruit
costs declined on increased output.  Prices  climbed 5.1 percent from a year earlier, after a 5.6
percent increase in October, the Bank of  Korea  said in a
statement from  Seoul  today. They fell 0.2 percent from October.
The cost of fruit and vegetables dropped 20.5 percent last month
from a year earlier.  The Bank of Korea left its benchmark rate unchanged at 3.25
percent yesterday for a sixth straight month, saying that
downside risks to growth are high. Consumer inflation
accelerated to a three-month high of 4.2 percent last month,
breaching the central bankâ€™s target limit of 4 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
