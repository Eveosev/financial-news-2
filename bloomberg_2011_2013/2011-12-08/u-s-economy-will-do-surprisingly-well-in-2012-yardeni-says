The  U.S. economy  will perform
“surprisingly well” in 2012 as corporate profits and  cash flow 
spur hiring, said Ed Yardeni of Yardeni Research Inc.  “Companies will have to hire or they’ll miss a lot of
business,” Yardeni said today at the Inside Commodities
conference in  New York . He said the U.S. may be a “safe haven”
as  Europe  endures a “mild recession.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
