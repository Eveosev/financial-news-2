Heating oil and gasoline fell after
European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  said he didn’t
signal plans to purchase more bonds, increasing concern that the
region’s debt crisis can’t be contained.  Futures slipped along with equities and the euro after
Draghi spoke as  Europe ’s leaders began talks in Brussels today
to hammer out a solution to the crisis. A weaker European
economy threatens the global recovery and fuel demand. Futures
rose earlier after a report that U.S. jobless claims decreased
to the lowest level since February.  “The jobs report is a bullish sign, but right now the
market is very dependent on events in Europe and questions
surrounding the sovereign debt,” said  Peter Beutel , president
of trading advisory company Cameron Hanover Inc. in  New Canaan ,
 Connecticut .  January-delivery heating oil sank 5.26 cents, or 1.8
percent, to settle at $2.9298 a gallon on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange . Prices have gained 15 percent this year and
peaked at $3.3197 on April 8.  Heating oil’s premium to gasoline narrowed 3.23 cents to
36.32 cents. The spread had narrowed 42 percent since reaching
62.69 cents on Nov. 14.  Stockpiles of heating oil and diesel rose 2.53 million
barrels last week to 141 million, a the most in five weeks, as
production reached a record high for the second straight week.
Output jumped 4.3 percent to 5.03 million barrels a day, the
report showed.  Gasoline for January delivery fell 2.03 cents, or 0.8
percent, to settle at $2.5666. Futures have increased 4.6
percent in 2011.  Dollar Rises  The dollar gained 0.6 percent against the euro at 2:55 p.m.
in  New York , reducing the investment appeal of commodities. The
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index declined 1.9 percent.  “I think Draghi spooked equities and we followed suit,”
said Fred Rigolini, vice president of Paramount Options Inc. in
New York. “As soon as something negative comes out of Europe
that’s the end of everything. Everyone is selling risk.”  Markets extended losses as regulators said European banks
need to raise more capital than previously estimated to in
response to the euro area’s sovereign debt crisis. Europe’s
banks must raise 114.7 billion euros ($152.7 billion) in fresh
capital, according to documents from the region’s banking
regulator obtained by Bloomberg News.  Higher Capital  European leaders are demanding the region’s banks bolster
their capital to withstand losses after financial firms agreed
to accept losses on Greek bonds.  Gasoline touched $2.6184 earlier after the Labor Department
reported that jobless  claims  dropped by 23,000 to 381,000 in the
week ended Dec. 3.  Gasoline fell yesterday after the Energy Department
reported that  inventories  of the motor fuel rose last week the
most in 10 months. Demand, or  deliveries  to wholesalers, slipped
2.2 percent to 8.57 million barrels a day, a five-week low.  “Yesterday’s report was about as bearish as you could get
for gasoline,” Beutel said.  Regular gasoline  at the pump, averaged nationwide, rose 0.9
cent to $3.295 a gallon yesterday, according to AAA data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
