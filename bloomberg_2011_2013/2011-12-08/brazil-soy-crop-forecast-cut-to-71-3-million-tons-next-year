Soybean growers in  Brazil , the
world’s second-largest producer after the U.S., will harvest
71.3 million metric tons next year, less than estimated in
November, the country’s Agriculture Ministry said.  The forecast was lowered from a Nov. 9 estimate of as much
as 73 million tons, the ministry’s crop-forecasting agency,
known as Conab, said today in an e-mailed report. Output will
fall from 75.3 million tons this year.  The corn forecast was raised to 60.3 million tons from a
previous estimate of as much as 59.5 million tons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
