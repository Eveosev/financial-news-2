Cooper Tire & Rubber Co., (CTB)  a U.S.
tiremaker, will buy a Serbian maker of car tires and pledged to
increase production sixfold within a few months.  Cooper will take over a unit of  Trajal Korporacija AD (TRAY)  from
 Brikel EAD  of  Bulgaria  for $13 million and invest as much as $50
million, Serbian Economy Minister Nebojsa Ciric said today after
signing the agreement, mediated by the government, in Belgrade
today.  Current annual production of 500,000 car tires will
increase to 3 million tires a year by the end of the first
quarter as Cooper plans a swift takeover, said Vice President
Harold Miller, in charge of the Findlay, Ohio-based company’s
international tire segment. Employment will rise eventually to
700 from 500 initially.  The other, smaller part of Trayal that makes tires for
trucks and bicycles will remain majority-owned by Brikel, with
the government becoming a 24 percent owner as it agreed to
convert what Brikel owes in back taxes into equity.  Trayal’s net loss widened to 1.2 billion dinars ($15.47
million) in 2010 from 947 million dinars in the previous year,
on operating revenue of almost 3 billion dinars. It’s the
second-biggest tiremaker in  Serbia  after Michelin & Cie.-owned
Tigar Tyres in Pirot.  To contact the reporter on this story:
