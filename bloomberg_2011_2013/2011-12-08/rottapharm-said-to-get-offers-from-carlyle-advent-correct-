(Corrects company name in first paragraph.)  Private-equity firms  Carlyle Group ,
Charterhouse Capital Partners LLP, Avista Capital Partners and
Advent International Corp. submitted bids for Italian drugmaker
 Rottapharm Madaus , four people familiar with the situation said.  One or two drugmakers also may have submitted an offer, one
person said, declining to identify the companies. Bids were due
this week and a decision could be made as soon as this month,
the person said. The family that owns the drugmaker may only
sell a minority stake, one person said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
