Jet fuel  consumption will grow at a
faster rate than diesel worldwide through to 2050 while demand
for gasoline will decline in a “radical change” for the
transport sector, the  World Energy Council  said.  The use of jet fuel may double by 2050 compared with last
year, the London-based researcher said in its Global Transport
Scenarios 2050 report, published today. Diesel and fuel oil
use are forecast to climb 46 percent, while gasoline demand is
expected to drop 63 percent in the next four decades, based on
WEC’s Tollway scenario, which assumes government intervention
to stimulate alternative technologies and public transport.  “Global transport will remain heavily dependent on fossil
fuels with a strong rise in demand for diesel, fuel oil and jet
fuel compared to gasoline,” Ayed Al-Qahtani, a senior project
manager for the report, said in an e-mailed  statement . Rising
diesel consumption is largely driven by demand from the heavy
transport, agriculture, and mining sectors, WEC said.  Biofuels use will expand fourfold over the period, the
council said. The council carries out research for 93 member
countries.  To contact the reporters on this story:
