American Laser Centers LLC, a
provider of hair-removal, cellulite-reduction, and skincare
services at 156 clinics in 27 U.S. states, sought bankruptcy
court protection from creditors.  The closely held company, based in Farmington Hills,
 Michigan , listed assets of $80.4 million and $105 million in
unsecured debt in its Chapter 11 filing today in U.S. Bankruptcy
Court in Wilmington, Delaware.  “The economic downturn has had a severe negative impact on
the overall demand for aesthetic procedures,” resulting in
reduced sales and profits for the company, with 1,263 employees,
said Chief Financial Officer Andrew Orr in court papers. He said
officials plan to auction the company.  Among the largest unsecured creditors listed in the filing
were Integrated Media Solutions of  New York , owed $1.98 million;
and the law firm of Glancy Binkow & Goldberg of Los Angeles,
with a $1.9 million claim.  The case is In Re: ALC Holdings LLC, et al., 11-13853, U.S.
