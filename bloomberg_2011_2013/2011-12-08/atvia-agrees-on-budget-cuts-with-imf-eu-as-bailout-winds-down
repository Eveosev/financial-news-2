Latvia agreed with the  International
Monetary Fund  and the European Commission to cut its 2012 budget
gap as the Baltic nation’s 7.5 billion-euro ($10.1 billion)
bailout program organized by the two lenders draws to a close.  Completion of the fifth and final review of the lending
program “will unlock remaining tranches of support from both
institutions,” the Washington-based IMF said today in an e-
mailed statement. “However, given its strong financial
position, the Latvian government does not intend to draw the
funds available to them.”  Latvia turned to a group led by the IMF and the Commission
in late 2008 after its second-biggest bank needed a state rescue
and a real-estate bubble burst. Next year’s budget envisages a
deficit of 2.5 percent of gross domestic product, which would
enable Latvia to adopt the euro in 2014. Parliament began
debating the plan today.  The IMF’s share of the loan program ends this month, with
the Commission’s part to follow in January.  To contact the reporter on this story:
