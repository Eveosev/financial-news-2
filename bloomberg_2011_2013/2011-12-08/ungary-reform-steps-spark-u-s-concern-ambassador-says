The Hungarian government’s measures
to overhaul the judiciary, media regulation, and parliament, and
their impact on democracy, are a cause of concern for the  United
States , U.S. Ambassador to Hungary Eleni Tsakopoulos Kounalakis
wrote in an article in  Heti Valasz .  “My embassy’s staff and my colleagues have carried out
very thorough work to understand the impact of cardinal laws on
democracy. We remain concerned,” Kounalakis wrote in the
article published in the weekly newspaper today.  The government of Prime Minister  Viktor Orban  should
“consider” its measures before the new constitution comes into
force next year as “a number of credible voices have raised
questions,” Kounalakis wrote.  The ambassador questioned whether “appropriate checks and
balances” are built into the system to “preserve the
independence of democratic institutions for future
generations.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
