Dexia SA (DEXB)  said talks on the sale of
its Luxembourg unit are continuing and the bank will have no
comment until a binding offer has been made.  Luxembourg Finance Minister Luc Frieden told his nation’s
parliament yesterday that Luxembourg will pay about 100 million
euros ($134.2 million) for 10 percent of Dexia Banque
Internationale à Luxembourg SA. Frieden said on Nov. 23 that
talks to sell the unit to an investment group that includes
members of Qatar’s royal family were “in the final stages.”  Dexia, which is being broken up after running out of short-
term funding, said today that the bank “does not wish to
comment on the disposal process,” according to an e-mailed
statement. “Discussions are going on and Dexia will communicate
on that disposal once a binding offer has been made.”  Once the world’s largest municipal lender, Dexia was
rescued by the governments of Belgium, France and Luxembourg in
October for the second time in three years. The three countries
this week submitted a draft agreement for temporary guarantees
to the European Commission.  Dexia obtained as much as 45 billion euros in guarantees
from the three nations to cover its financing needs through May.
The support will help complete its planned asset sales, the
Paris- and Brussels-based bank said on Dec. 5.  Shares of lender fell as much as 5.3 percent today and were
down 3.3 percent at 35 cents at 10:04 a.m. in Brussels. The
stock has fallen more than 85 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
