New York  gasoline slipped to the
lowest level since August after the government reported imports
of the fuel to the East Coast increased and shipments are
expected to rise.  Gasoline imports  to the region rose 282,000 barrels, or 59
percent, to 761,000 barrels a day last week, according to the
Energy Department. Shipments of the fuel to the U.S. from  Europe 
are set to gain 4 percent over the next two weeks as the surplus
of available tankers may narrow, a Bloomberg News survey showed.  Conventional gasoline to be blended with ethanol, or CBOB,
in New York Harbor was at an 0.8 cent discount versus futures
traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 3:24 p.m.,
compared with a 0.38-cent premium yesterday, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. It’s the lowest level since Aug. 25.
Prompt delivery dropped 3.21 cents to $2.5586 a gallon.  Twenty-six vessels were booked or scheduled to be chartered
for loading to Dec. 22, according to the median estimate in a
Bloomberg News survey yesterday of four shipbrokers, two traders
and one owner, all of whom specialize in shipping the auto fuel.
That’s one more cargo hired than for the two weeks to Dec. 15,
according to the survey data.  The discount for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in the
 Gulf Coast  narrowed 0.75 cent to 6.5 cents a gallon.  To contact the reporter on this story:
