Tropical Cyclone Alenga has formed
off  Australia ’s north-west coast, moving east southeast over
open waters across the central Indian Ocean, the Bureau of
Meteorology said on its website. Alenga is near peak intensity
and is expected to weaken from tonight, it said. It is expected
to weaken below cyclone intensity without reaching the coast and
is not expected to affect island or coastal communities. The
cyclone’s path may see it cross off-shore energy projects in the
region, according to its forecast track map.  Forecast track map:
