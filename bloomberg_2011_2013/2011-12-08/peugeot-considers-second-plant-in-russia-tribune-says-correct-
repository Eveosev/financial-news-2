(Corrects spelling of name in first paragraph.)  PSA Peugeot Citroen (UG)  may set up a
second plant in  Russia , in partnership with a carmaker already
operating in the country,  La Tribune  reported, citing Didier
Aleton, who heads PSMA Rus, a partnership between Peugeot and
Mitsubishi Motors Corp. in Russia.  It’s too early to talk about expanding production capacity
in Russia, said Bernd Schantz, who heads Peugeot’s business in
Russia and the Community of Independent States, the newspaper
reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
