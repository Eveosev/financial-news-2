Michael Fuchs , the Christian
Democratic Union’s deputy leader in Germany’s parliament, and
 Rainer Bruederle , parliamentary leader of Germany’s Free
Democratic Party, want Europe to create an independent European
debt-rating company,  Passauer Neue Presse  reported, citing
interviews.  Fuchs said the existing ratings companies appear to be
“making policy” and “that is not their job,” according to
the newspaper.  Both Fuchs and Bruederle suggested a European ratings body
could operate in the same way as a foundation, the newspaper
said in an e-mailed preview of articles to appear in today’s
newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
