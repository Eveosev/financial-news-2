New  China  Life Insurance Co., the
nation’s third-largest life insurer, raised $1.9 billion from an
initial public offering in Hong Kong and Shanghai, after selling
shares near the bottom of a marketed range, according to people
with knowledge of the matter.  The state-backed company sold 358.4 million shares at
HK$28.50 apiece in Hong Kong, to raise about HK$10.2 billion
($1.3 billion), said two people, who asked not to be identified
because the information is private. New China Life sold another
158.5 million shares in Shanghai at 23.25 yuan apiece, to raise
3.7 billion yuan ($580 million), two people said.  Investors have cooled on new equity offerings as the Hang
Seng Index has  dropped (HSI)  about 17 percent this year, amid concerns
that  China’s economy  is slowing and over  Europe ’s debt crisis.
New China Life’s rivals China Life Insurance Co. and Ping An
Insurance (Group) Co. are down more than 30 percent, with  Fitch
Ratings  saying that the nations insurers face “solvency
pressure” because of investment losses.  The insurer originally offered the Hong Kong shares at
HK$28.20 to HK$34.33 apiece, according to a prospectus filed to
the city’s stock exchange on Dec. 1. The Shanghai shares were
offered at 23 yuan to 28 yuan each. Phone calls to New China
Life’s media office weren’t answered. Reuters earlier reported
the IPO price.  Baoxin Auto Group Ltd., a Chinese luxury car dealer, raised
$415 million in a  Hong Kong  IPO today after selling shares at
the low end of the marketed range, two people with knowledge of
the matter said.  New China Life was the nation’s third-largest life insurer
by premium income last year, after China Life and Ping An
Insurance (Group) Co., according to data from the China
Insurance Regulatory Commission.  To contact the reporter on this story:
