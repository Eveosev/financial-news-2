Affymetrix Inc. (AFFX) , the developer of DNA
chip technology for the pharmaceutical industry, set the
interest rate on a $170 million  term loan  it’s seeking to
finance its acquisition of eBioscience Inc., according to a
person with knowledge of the transaction.  The five-year debt will pay 6 percentage points more than
the London interbank offered rate, said the person, who declined
to be identified because the terms are private. Libor, a rate
banks charge to lend to each other, will have a 1.5 percent
floor.  Affymetrix is proposing to sell the loan at 98 cents on the
dollar, the person said, reducing proceeds for the company and
boosting the yield to investors.  GE Capital Markets, the lending unit of General Electric
Co., Silicon Valley Bank and CIT Group Inc. are arranging the
financing and lenders must submit commitments by Dec. 22.  The  Santa Clara , California-based company is also seeking a
$20 million revolving line of credit, the person said.  Affymetrix agreed to acquire eBioscience for $330 million,
according to a Nov. 30 statement distributed by Business Wire.  Doug Farrell, vice president of  investor relations  at
Affymetrix didn’t respond to an e-mail seeking comment.  In a revolving credit facility, money can be borrowed again
once it’s repaid; in a term loan, it can’t.  To contact the reporter on this story:
