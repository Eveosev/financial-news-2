MF Global Holdings Ltd. (MF) ’s U.K.
administrators will hold their first meeting with the failed
brokerage’s clients and creditors on Jan. 9.  The meeting will allow those owed money by the firm to vote
on “the special administrators’ proposals and to consider the
appointment and composition of any creditors’ committee,”
administrators KPMG LLP said in a statement on the firm’s
website. Creditors seeking to vote at the meeting should provide
details of their claim against MF Global U.K. by Jan. 6, KPMG
said.  New York-based MF Global was the fifth-largest financial
company to file for bankruptcy in the U.S. when it sought
protection on Oct. 31 after placing losing bets on European
sovereign debt.  KPMG LLP was appointed to supervise the special
administration of the broker’s London unit, in the first use of
a new U.K. system designed to quickly unwind collapsed financial
firms.  To contact the reporter on this story:
