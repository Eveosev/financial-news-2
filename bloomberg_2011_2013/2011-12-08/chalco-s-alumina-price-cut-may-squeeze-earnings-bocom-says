Aluminum Corp. of China Ltd. (2600) ’s cut of
alumina prices may reduce its profit by about 300 million yuan
($47 million) a year, BOCOM International Holdings Co. said.  The nation’s biggest producer of aluminum, also known as
Chalco, set its alumina price at 2,800 yuan per metric ton,
according to a  statement  posted on the company’s website. That’s
the first adjustment since March when the company raised prices
to 3,000 yuan, and the first price cut since July last year,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “The price cut would squeeze profits as the company’s
margin is already thin,” BOCOM analyst Luo Rongjin said today
in an e-mail. The cut was made on Nov. 28, he said. Shen Hui, a
spokeswoman for Chalco, did not answer calls to her mobile
phone.  Alumina, a white powder used to make aluminum, accounted
for more than 70 percent of Chalco’s profit last year as the
smelter struggled to break even in the metal unit, Luo said.
 Aluminum prices  in  London  have slumped 25 percent from a record
in May to $2,088 a ton as of 4:54 p.m. Shanghai time today amid
concerns that the European sovereign-debt crisis and a slowdown
in the  U.S. economy  may curb demand for commodities.  BOCOM’s Luo cut his estimate for Chalco earnings this
calendar year to about 0.07 yuan per share from 0.08 yuan
following the alumina price cut, he said. Earnings per share may
be 0.091 yuan according to the median of 13 analyst estimates
compiled by Bloomberg. The company posted earnings of 778
million yuan, or 0.06 yuan a share, for 2010.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
