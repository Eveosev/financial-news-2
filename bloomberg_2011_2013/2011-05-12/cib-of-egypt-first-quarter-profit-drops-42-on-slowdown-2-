Commercial International Bank,
Egypt’s biggest publicly traded lender, said first-quarter
profit fell 42 percent because of a slowdown in the economy
following the revolt that toppled President  Hosni Mubarak .  Net income fell to 308 million Egyptian pounds ($52
million) from 528 million pounds a year earlier, the Cairo-based
bank said in an e-mailed statement. The median estimate of five
analysts was for a profit of 460 million pounds, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Net interest income rose 22 percent to 633 million pounds
while non-interest income fell 35 percent to 308 million pounds.
Operating expenses increased 18 percent to 429 million pounds
and provisions surged to 123 million pounds from 2 million
pounds, the bank said.  “For the most part of the quarter the core economic
activities were severely disrupted as a result of massive
demonstrations throughout the country, lack of security, labor
demands and the imposed curfew,” CIB said.  CIB shares rose 1.2 percent to 28.88 Egyptian pounds at the
close of trade today, valuing the bank at 17 billion pounds.  “CIB will continue to face growth challenges over the next
6-18 months, depending on the economic and political
developments in  Egypt , but the pressure might not be as high as
its peers, given the bank’s market leadership,” Nancy Fahmy, a
Cairo-based analyst at investment bank Beltone Financial, wrote
in a report today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
