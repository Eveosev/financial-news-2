Acciona SA (ANA)  net income rose to 56
million euros ($75 million) in the first quarter as wind power
output climbed.  Profit increased 53 percent from the year-earlier period as
the company’s international installations experienced more wind
and it increased wind generating capacity by 150 megawatts to
6,380 megawatts including jointly-owned plants, the company said
today in a regulatory filing.  Madrid-based Acciona is ramping up its energy business and
its international activity to reduce its exposure to the Spanish
 construction industry  which is struggling to emerge from a
three-year economic slump.  The shares rose as much as 1.8 percent in Madrid and traded
1.1 percent higher at 75.94 euros at 1:21 p.m.  The energy unit contributed 84 percent of earnings before
interest, tax, depreciation and amortization compared with 75
percent a year earlier. Ebitda rose 12 percent to 308 million
euros while sales slipped 4.7 percent to 1.45 billion euros due
to the slowdown in Spanish construction.  Construction work began in March on a 38-megawatt wind park
in  Poland  and the 45-megawatt Lameque plant in  Canada  will begin
generating commercially this month. It sold 15 percent of
Spanish solar-thermal business, which owns four plants, to
Mitsubishi Corporation for 45.8 million euros in February.  Acciona owns 5,514 megawatts of wind plants, 912 megawatts
of hydro and 214 megawatts of solar thermal generators as part
of 6,738 megawatts of attributable power production capacity.  The company’s construction order book increased to 7.6
billion euros compared with 7 billion euros a year earlier, with
the share of international order rising to 41 percent from 28
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
