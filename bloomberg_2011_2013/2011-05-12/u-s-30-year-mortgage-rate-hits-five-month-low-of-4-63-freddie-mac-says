Mortgage rates  in the U.S. decreased
for a fourth week, sending borrowing costs to the lowest level
since December.  The average rate for a 30-year loan dropped to 4.63 percent
in the week ended today from 4.71 percent, according to  Freddie
Mac . That is the lowest since the week ended Dec. 9. The 15-year
rate slipped to 3.82 percent from 3.89 percent a week ago, the
McLean, Virginia-based mortgage-finance company said.  Falling rates helped drive demand for mortgages last week
and encouraged homeowners to reduce their monthly payments. The
Mortgage Bankers Association’s measure of refinancing rose 9
percent in the week ended May 6, the biggest increase in two
months. Purchase applications climbed 6.7 percent, the
Washington-based group said yesterday.  “Housing is more affordable than it was in several
decades,” said  Patrick Newport , an economist at IHS Global
Insight in Lexington,  Massachusetts . “On the other hand, the
number of people who can qualify for these great rates isn’t
that large.”  The U.S. housing market is struggling to recover as
unemployment hovers at 9 percent.  Home prices  dropped in 118 of
153 cities as foreclosures that sell at cut-rate prices devalued
real estate, the National Association of Realtors said May 10.  The average rate for a 30-year fixed loan is below where it
was last year at this time, when it was 4.93 percent, according
to Freddie Mac. It fell to a record 4.17 percent in November.  To contact the reporter on this story:
