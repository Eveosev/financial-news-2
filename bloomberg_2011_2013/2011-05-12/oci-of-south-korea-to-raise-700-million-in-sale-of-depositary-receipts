OCI Co., the world’s second-biggest
polysilicon maker, said it plans to raise as much as $700
million this month selling global depositary receipts to
overseas investors.  The  Seoul , South Korea-based company will offer receipts
for 360,719 existing and 1.2 million new shares. It’ll use the
proceeds to increase production capacity, OCI said in a
regulatory filing today.  The manufacturer may gauge investor interest from May 20 to
May 26 and list the depositary receipts on the Singapore stock
exchange on June 1, according to the filing. Ten GDRs will
represent one share.  OCI is expanding its annual output capacity for
polysilicon, used to make solar cells, to 62,000 metric tons by
2012 from the current 27,000 tons. Its shares fell 3.9 percent
to 550,000 won today, while the Kospi index dropped 2 percent.
The stock is up 67 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
