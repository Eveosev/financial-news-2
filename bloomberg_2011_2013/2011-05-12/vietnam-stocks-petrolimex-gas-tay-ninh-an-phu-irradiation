Shares of the following companies had
unusual moves in Vietnam trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses, and prices are as of the 11 a.m. local-time close.  The VN Index, the benchmark measure of the Ho Chi Minh City
Stock Exchange, dropped for the first day in four, retreating
0.2 percent to 482.14.  Petrolimex Gas Joint-Stock Corp. (PGC VN), a petrochemical
company, declined 1.2 percent to 8,100 dong. The company will
start trading 7.95 million additional shares on the exchange on
May 26, according a statement on the bourseâ€™s website.  Rubber Stocks: Tay Ninh Rubber Joint-Stock Co. (TRC VN),
the third-biggest listed rubber producer, slid 4.8 percent, the
most since April 26, to 47,500 dong. Danang Rubber Joint-Stock
Co. (DRC VN) dropped 1.3 percent to 30,200 dong.  Rubber declined for the first day in four as a slump in oil
reduced the appeal of the commodity and amid concern that  China 
may boost borrowing costs to curb inflation, weakening demand
for the raw material used in tires. October-delivery rubber
tumbled as much as 4.5 percent to 366 yen per kilogram ($4,506 a
metric ton) before trading at 369 yen on the Tokyo Commodity
Exchange at 10:42 a.m.  An Phu Irradiation Joint-Stock Co. (APC VN), an irradiater
of fruit to be exported to the U.S., rose 3.7 percent, the most
since March 23, to 13,900 dong. An Phu will pay a 2010 dividend
of 2,000 dong a share in June, according to a statement on its
website.  Hung Vuong Corp. (HVG)  , the third-largest listed seafood
company, jumped 4.9 percent to 17,200 dong, the biggest gain
since Feb. 14. The company based in the Mekong Delta province of
Tien Giang reported first-quarter profit climbed 49 percent to
106.1 billion dong ($5.2 million), according to a filing with
the exchange.  --Nguyen Dieu Tu Uyen. With assistance from Diep Pham. Editor:
