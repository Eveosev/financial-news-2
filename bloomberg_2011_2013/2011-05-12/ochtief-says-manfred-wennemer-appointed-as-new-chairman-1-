Hochtief AG (HOT)  said Manfred Wennemer was
appointed chairman of the supervisory board and Ulrich Best was
appointed deputy chairman, following a shareholders meeting
today.  Wennemer, 63, a former chief executive officer of
 Continental AG (CON) , was proposed by majority investor Actividades de
Construccion & Servicios SA.  New board members also proposed by ACS included ACS board
members Pedro Lopez Jimenez, 68, and Jose Luis del Valle Perez,
60. Also new to the board and proposed by ACS are Eggert Voscherau, 67, supervisory board chairman of  BASF SE (BAS) , Abdulla Abdulaziz Turki Al-Subaie, 36, managing director of Qatar
Railways, and Thomas Eichelmann, 45, CEO of Aton GmbH.  Former Chairman Detlev Bremkamp and members Hans-Peter Keitel, Heinrich von Pierer, and Wilhelm Simson, decided shortly
before today’s meeting not to seek re-election.  ACS acquired 43.1 percent of Essen-based Hochtief, giving
it an effective majority voice in the appointment of board
members at today’s meeting.  To contact the reporter on this story:
