Russian Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin ’s administration approved the appointment of deputy
premier Sergei Ivanov’s son to replace a first deputy prime
minister at a state-run bank, a presidential adviser said.  Arkady Dvorkovich, the Kremlin’s top economic adviser,
declined to say whether President  Dmitry Medvedev  supported the
decision to name the younger Ivanov, also named Sergei, to head
the supervisory board at Russian Agricultural Bank. He will
replace First Deputy Prime Minister Viktor Zubkov, who is
leaving after Medvedev ordered eight top officials to resign
from the boards of state companies in industries they regulate.  The Kremlin opposes Ivanov’s appointment, Vedomosti
reported earlier today, citing an unidentified presidential
official.  The younger Ivanov, who used to work at OAO Gazprombank,
the lending arm of  Russia ’s natural-gas export monopoly, earlier
this year took over as head of insurance company Sogaz.  Medvedev’s spokeswoman, Natalya Timakova, declined to
comment when contacted by Bloomberg News. Dmitry Peskov, Putin’s
spokesman, also declined to comment. The bank’s press service
declined to comment.  To contact the reporters on this story:
