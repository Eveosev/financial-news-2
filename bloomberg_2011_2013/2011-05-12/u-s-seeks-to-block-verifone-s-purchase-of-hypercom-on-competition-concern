The U.S.  Justice Department  sought to
block  VeriFone Systems Inc. (PAY) ’s proposed acquisition of Hypercom
Corp., saying in a civil antitrust lawsuit the deal would
substantially reduce competition in the market for point-of-sale
terminals that are used by retailers to accept credit and debit
card payments, according to an e-mailed statement.  Verifone shares fell $5.28, or 11 percent, to $44.72 at 3
p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
