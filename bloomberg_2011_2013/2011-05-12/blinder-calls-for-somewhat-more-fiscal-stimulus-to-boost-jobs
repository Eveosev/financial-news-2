Former Federal Reserve Vice Chairman
Alan Blinder said there’s a need for additional fiscal stimulus
to combat 9 percent unemployment in the U.S.  “What we should be doing in an ideal world is somewhat
more fiscal expansion now, not a titanic amount more, but
somewhat more and very targeted on job creation,” Blinder, a
professor at  Princeton University  in New Jersey, said today in
an interview with  Tom Keene  on Bloomberg Television’s
“Surveillance on the Road.”  Blinder said the government should simultaneously be
“legislating into law, fiscal consolidation in the future.” He
said he sees “very remote” odds of a “very substantial fiscal
consolidation” this year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
