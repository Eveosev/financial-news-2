Netflix Inc. (NFLX) , operator of the movie
streaming service, will offer films and TV shows on five
smartphones that use  Google Inc. (GOOG) ’s Android operating system.  Four phones from  HTC Corp. (2498)  and the Nexus S from Samsung
Electronics Co. are the first Android devices to get the Watch
Instantly service, Los Gatos, California-based Netflix said
today on its  blog . Others will follow as the company tests
individual handsets to determine if they have playback support,
Roma De, a product support specialist, said in the posting.  Netflix’s $7.99 monthly streaming plan is available on TVs,
game consoles, Blu-ray players and Apple Inc.’s iPad and iPhone.
The addition of Android was hampered by “significant
challenges” from working with an operating system that has been
updated frequently in the past two years, De said.  Netflix rose $5.10, or 2.1 percent, to $245.77 at 4 p.m.
New York time in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. The shares have
risen 40 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
