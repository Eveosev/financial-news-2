Polish day-ahead electricity rose in
the past week as higher exports and maintenance trimmed supply.
Forecasts for colder and cloudy weather may support prices.  Next-day baseload power climbed 4.8 percent to 217.64 zloty
($78.80) a megawatt-hour in the week ending today, according to
Bloomberg calculations based on Polish Power Exchange data.  Average daily electricity demand was as high as 17,659
megawatts this week, down 0.3 percent from last week’s maximum
daily average, according to  system load data .  As much as 1,500 megawatts of Polish electricity was
scheduled to be exported to  Germany ,  Czech Republic , and
Slovakia on Friday morning, outweighing power imports via cable
from  Sweden , according to data from PSE Operator. More than
3,000 megawatts remained idled for maintenance.  Mid-day temperatures in Warsaw may fall to 13 degrees
Celsius (55 Fahrenheit) on May 16 from today’s 25 degrees, while
skies are forecast to be mostly cloudy, according to
CustomWeather Inc. data on Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
