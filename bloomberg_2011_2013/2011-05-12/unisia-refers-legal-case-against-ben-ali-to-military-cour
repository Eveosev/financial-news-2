Tunisian authorities referred the
case against former President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali to a
military court, the state-run Agence Tunis Afrique Presse
reported.  Ben Ali has been charged with crimes including the murder
of protesters and conspiring against the internal security of
the state, officials said last month.  Protests against Ben Aliâ€™s rule culminated in his Jan. 14
flight to  Saudi Arabia  and inspired a wave of popular uprisings
in the Middle East that led to the ouster of Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak and revolts in  Libya , Syria, Bahrain and Yemen.  The case against former Interior Minister Rafik Belhaj
Kacem also will be referred to a military court, TAP said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
