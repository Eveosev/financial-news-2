Metinvest Holding LLC,  Ukraine ’s
largest steelmaker, slowed production at its Mariupolsky
Metallurgical Plant of Ilyich (MMK) after an iron receiver
ruptured on May 9, said Serhiy Magera, a company spokesman.  The accident at the second blast furnace, which damaged the
cooling system, is being investigated, Magera said in a phone
interview from Mariupol, in southern Ukraine, where the
 steelmaker  is based.  The furnace can produce  pig iron  at a very slow pace,
Magera said, declining to comment on how much production has
been lost. No one was injured in the blast and no layoffs are
planned, he said.  The company plans to get the furnace fixed and back into
operation, Magera said, declining to say when it would be done.  To contact the reporters on this story:
