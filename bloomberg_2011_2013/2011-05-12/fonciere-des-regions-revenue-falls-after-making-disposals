Fonciere des Regions (FDR)  SA, the French
office landlord with stakes in five other real estate investment
trusts, said first-quarter revenue fell after property sales
reduced rental income.  Revenue fell to 131.8 million euros ($187.5 million) from
142 million euros a year earlier, the Metz-based company said in
a statement today.  FDR sold 626 million euros of real estate last year to
reduce debt, acquire properties with greater scope for rental
growth and to finance a 1 billion euros of longer-term projects.
The company predicted in February that earnings, excluding
changes in asset values and other items, will probably be little
changed this year.  FDR released the report after the Paris market closed. The
shares declined 1.1 percent to 71.79 euros, lowering the
companyâ€™s market value to 3.94 billion euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
