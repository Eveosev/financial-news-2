Nemiroff , a Ukrainian vodka maker,
plans to increase international sales 14 percent in volume this
year and expand shipments to additional countries, according to
Serhiy Bleskun, commercial director of the company.  Volume sales rose 3 percent in 2010 to 8.29 million
decaliters (22 million gallons), Bleskun told reporters in Kiev
today. The company plans to start selling to  Brazil ,  Argentina ,
 Chile  and three African nations and increase the number of
countries it does business with to 78 from 72, he said.  Revenue should increase around 27 percent this year after a
13.6 percent rise in 2010 to $473.6 million, he said. Ukraine
and  Poland  posted the biggest increase in sales volume and
revenue, Bleskun said.  Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization in 2010 climbed to $50.3 million from $45.8 million
a year earlier, according to Klim Neretin, financial director.
Ebitda may decline this year on higher costs and foreign-
exchange losses, he said.  Net income, which the company doesn’t disclose, may also
decline in 2011, Neretin said at the same event.  To contact the reporter on this story:
