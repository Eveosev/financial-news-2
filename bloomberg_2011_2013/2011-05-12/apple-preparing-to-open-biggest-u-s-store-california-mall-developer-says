Apple Inc. (AAPL)  is preparing to open a
store at the Americana at Brand retail center in Glendale,
 California , said Rick Caruso, the property’s developer.  Caruso announced the plans during a speech today at a Town
Hall Los Angeles luncheon, without giving additional details.
The Americana at Brand, an open-air mall and apartment complex
that opened in 2008, is about 8 miles (13 kilometers) from
downtown Los Angeles.  Apple, which is marking the 10th anniversary of its retail
stores this month, is increasingly relying on the outlets to
market products, such as the iPhone and iPad. Apple’s stores had
a record 71.1 million visitors last quarter, and retail revenue
jumped 90 percent to $3.19 billion in the period.  The store would be the second in Glendale for the
Cupertino, California-based company.  Apple fell 66 cents to $346.57 today in Nasdaq Stock Market
trading. The shares have climbed 7.4 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
