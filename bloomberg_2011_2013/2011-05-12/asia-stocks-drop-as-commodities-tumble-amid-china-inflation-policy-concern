Asian stocks fell, with the key
regional index set for its biggest slide since markets crashed
in the wake of  Japan ’s record earthquake in March, as commodity
prices tumbled amid concern that China will further tighten
monetary policy.  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , the world’s largest mining company,
dropped 2.6 percent in Sydney after oil and metal prices sank
yesterday in  New York . Jiangxi Copper Co., China’s No. 1
producer of the metal, declined 2.2 percent in Hong Kong. Korea
Zinc Co. slid 5.7 percent in  Seoul , while Mitsubishi Corp.,
Japan’s biggest commodities trader, fell 2 percent. Olympus
Corp., an optical-equipment maker, lost 5.6 percent in  Tokyo 
after reporting an 85 percent slump in profit.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index declined 1.6 percent to 136.14
as of 7:44 p.m. in Tokyo after commodity prices tumbled
yesterday as  China  reported faster-than-estimated inflation and
as the U.S. Federal Reserve gets closer to ending a $600 billion
asset-purchase program, known as quantitative easing, in June.  “Markets always struggle with tightening cycles,” said
 James Holt , Sydney-based director of BlackRock Investment
Management ( Australia ) Ltd., which oversees about $40 billion in
assets. “The China inflation data yesterday shows that the
country will need to do more tightening. This comes at the same
time as investors pre-empt the end of the second round of
quantitative easing, which has pumped up asset and commodity
markets.”  Nikkei, Kospi  The gauge is headed for its steepest drop since March 15,
when it fell 5 percent as Japanese stocks plunged amid a nuclear
crisis triggered by a magnitude-9 earthquake and ensuing tsunami
on March 11.  Japan’s  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average fell 1.5 percent and  South
Korea ’s Kospi Index lost 2 percent. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index
retreated 0.9 percent. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index decreased
1.8 percent on a day the statistics bureau reported that the
nation’s employers unexpectedly cut workers in April by the most
since 2009.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index lost 0.6 percent
today. In New York yesterday, the index slumped 1.1 percent, its
biggest decline since March 16.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index rose 0.5 percent this year
through yesterday, compared with gains of 6.7 percent by the S&P
500 and 2.9 percent by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. Stocks in the
Asian benchmark were valued at 13.6 times estimated earnings on
average at yesterday’s close, compared with 13.6 times for the
S&P 500 and 11.3 times for the Stoxx 600.  BHP, Korea Zinc  The Asia-Pacific gauge has risen close to 5 percent and
commodity prices have surged since Nov. 3 when a U.S. plan to
buy Treasuries was unveiled. The Fed said last month it won’t
need to extend the $600 billion program beyond its scheduled end
next month.  BHP Billiton , also Australia’s No. 1 oil producer, lost 2.6
percent to A$44.13 in Sydney, while Rio Tinto Group, the world’s
No. 2 mining company by sales, retreated 2 percent to A$79.79.
Jiangxi Copper slumped 2.2 percent to HK$24.10 in  Hong Kong .  Korea Zinc slid 5.7 percent to 367,500 won in Seoul and
Mitsubishi Corp. declined 2 percent to 2,112 yen in Tokyo.  China Growth Risk  “The volatility in commodity prices and concerns about
future policy direction in China have increased investor
uncertainty,” said  Tim Schroeders , Melbourne-based manager at
Pengana Capital Ltd., which oversees about $1 billion. “Any
perception that risks to the Chinese growth story are increasing
will see investors react swiftly to adjust.”  Material and energy stocks led today’s declines after crude
oil for June delivery plunged 5.5 percent to settle at $98.21 a
barrel yesterday in New York. Copper fell to the lowest price in
five months after China reported inflation remains above the
government’s target, signaling further  monetary-policy 
tightening that may curb metal demand.  The London Metal Exchange Index of six metals including
copper and aluminum lost 1.9 percent yesterday, its first drop
in four days.  “The inflation concern is causing investors to avoid risk
assets,” said  Mitsushige Akino , who oversees about $600 million
in Tokyo at Ichiyoshi Investment Management Co. “That is the
underlying reason for a slump in the commodity market.”  Consumer Prices  Consumer prices in China rose 5.3 percent from a year
earlier and banks extended 740 billion yuan ($114 billion) of
local-currency loans, according to reports yesterday from the
statistics bureau and central bank.  Inflation is “the most pressing problem” facing the
world’s second-biggest economy, Vice Premier Wang Qishan said
this week. Monetary policy will remain “prudent” and focus on
removing “inflationary monetary elements,” Chinese officials
said in a statement in Washington after talks with the U.S.  Oil refiners dropped today after gasoline prices yesterday
sank the most since February 2009 in New York.  S-Oil Corp. (010950) 
slumped 6.3 percent to 134,000 won in Seoul, while SK Innovation
Co. fell 4.7 percent to 215,500 won. In Sydney, Caltex Australia
Ltd., Australia’s largest oil refiner, slid 1.3 percent to
A$14.35.  Olympus dropped 5.6 percent to 2,281 yen in Tokyo. The
company said full-year net income tumbled 85 percent to 7.38
billion yen as sales fell and did not disclose a profit forecast
for this year.  Also in Tokyo, Citizen Holdings Co. decreased 7.3 percent
to 459 yen. The watchmaker booked 5.12 billion yen ($63 million)
in net income for the year ended March 31, missing its forecast
by 27 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
