The Miami Heat scored 16 unanswered
points at the end of the fourth quarter to beat the Boston
Celtics 97-87 and clinch their National Basketball Association
playoff series.  Also last night, the Oklahoma City Thunder defeated the
 Memphis  Grizzlies 99-72 to lead their best-of-seven Western
Conference semifinal by three games to two.  LeBron James scored the last 10 points and had two 3-
pointers in the closing four minutes at AmericanAirlines Arena
in Miami as the Heat took control to finish off their Eastern
Conference series by four games to one.  “They make you fight for everything,” James said. “You
can never take the foot off the gas. You can never take a second
off against that team.”  Miami will play the  Chicago Bulls  or  Atlanta Hawks  for a
place in the NBA Finals. That series resumes today with the
Bulls leading 3-2 in games.  It’s the first time Miami has reached the conference finals
since its championship-winning run in 2006. The series win
avenges a first-round exit to the Celtics in last year’s
playoffs.  The Celtics led 87-81 with 4 minutes, 15 seconds left in
the game.  Dwyane Wade  began Miami’s run with a free throw.  James Jones  added a 24-foot 3-pointer and Miami tied it on a Chris Bosh dunk. James followed with a pair of 3-pointers and two
field goals to secure the win.  Wade led the Heat with 34 points and 10 rebounds, James
contributed 33 points and Bosh had 14 points and 11 rebounds.  Ray Allen  had 18 points for the Celtics, while Kevin Garnett had 15 points and 11 rebounds.  At Oklahoma City Arena, Kevin Durant scored 19 points and
Daequan Cook added 18 to lead the Thunder, who travel to Memphis
for Game 6 tomorrow.  Marc Gasol was the high scorer for the Grizzlies with 15
points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
