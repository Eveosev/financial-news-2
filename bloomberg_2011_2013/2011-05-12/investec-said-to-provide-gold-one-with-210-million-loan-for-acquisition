Investec Plc (INVP) , a South African bank,
agreed to provide a $210 million facility to gold producer  Gold
One International Ltd. (GDO)  for its proposed acquisition of Rand
Uranium Ltd., two people with knowledge of the accord said.  The facility is subject to conditions, including the
results of Gold Oneâ€™s due-diligence study of Rand Uranium, said
the people, who declined to be identified because the conditions
are yet to be met.  Gold One said April 28 it plans to buy Rand Uranium, a gold
producer with uranium assets, as it seeks to increase and
diversify its output. Johannesburg-based Gold One will acquire
the company from a group including Harmony Gold Mining Ltd. for
$250 million in cash.  Investec, a private bank and wealth manager listed in
Johannesburg and  London , said Feb. 3 it expects full-year profit
to be constrained by the slow recovery in non-performing loans
and the number of banking transactions.  To contact the reporters on this story:
