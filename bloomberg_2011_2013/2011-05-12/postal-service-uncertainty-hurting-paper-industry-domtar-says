Domtar Corp. (UFS) , the largest North
American maker of paper for printers and copiers, is among
companies hurt by uncertainty about the future of the U.S.
 Postal Service , which may run out of money in September, an
executive said.  Domtar may see less of its printed paper sent as
advertising mail if mailers don’t know what sort of future the
Postal Service has, Rob Melton, vice president of converting
papers and strategic accounts, said today in  Washington . The
company has shut down paper machines at four mills since 2007.  “Uncertainty about the viability of the Postal Service
will negatively impact mailer and marketer decisions to choose
mail, so the urgency to restore confidence that the Postal
Service is a dependable partner is great,” Melton, whose
company is based in  Montreal , today told the House Subcommittee
on Federal Workforce, U.S. Postal Service and Labor Policy.  The Postal Service, which this week posted a loss of $2.6
billion for its fiscal second quarter, is asking Congress to
allow it to delay a required $5.5 billion payment for health
benefits of future retirees. That payment is due in September.  The service is also seeking permission to more easily close
post offices and other facilities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
