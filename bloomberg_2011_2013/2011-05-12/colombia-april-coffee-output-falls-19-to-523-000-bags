Colombia , the second-largest producer
of arabica beans, said production fell 19 percent to 523,000
bags in April after storms last year hampered plants from
flowering.  Output was 647,000 bags in April 2010, according to an e-
mailed statement today from Colombiaâ€™s National Federation of
Coffee Growers.  Exports last month declined 2.4 percent 574,000 bags from
588,000 bags a year earlier, the group said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
