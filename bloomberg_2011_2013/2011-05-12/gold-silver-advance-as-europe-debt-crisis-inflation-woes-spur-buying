Gold futures fell for the second
straight day and silver tumbled to a 10-week low as the dollar’s
rebound eroded demand for the precious metals as an alternative
asset.  The greenback rose to a three-week high against a basket of
major currencies. Most industrial metals fell in London, and the
MSCI World Index of equities declined for the second day.  China 
raised reserve requirements for banks for the fifth time this
year to stem inflation.  “China is still taking steps to rein in its economy, and
that’s bearish for commodities,” said  Adam Klopfenstein , a
senior market strategist at Lind-Waldock in Chicago. “The easy
money has been made in the metals.”  Gold futures for June delivery fell $11.10, or 0.7 percent,
to $1,490.30 an ounce by 11:12 a.m. on the Comex in New York.
The prices reached a record $1,577.40 on May 2.  Accelerating inflation has increased speculation that
central banks will raise  interest rates . Last week, gold fell
4.2 percent and silver plunged 27 percent, leading a slide in
raw materials.  “Investors are taking profit with gold to compensate for
losses with other assets,”  Carsten Fritsch , an analyst at
Commerzbank AG in Frankfurt, said in a report.  Crude oil and gasoline dropped for a second day on bets
that demand will ease.  As commodity prices fall, “even the most ardent metals
bull has to stand back, take a deep breath and worry about
margin liquidation,” said Dennis Gartman, an economist and the
editor of the Suffolk, Virginia-based Gartman Letter.  Silver futures for July delivery fell $1.905, or 5.4
percent, to $33.61 an ounce. Earlier, the price touched $32.30,
the lowest since Feb. 25. The meal has plunged as much as 35
percent from a 31-year high of $49.845 on April 25.  To contact the reporters on this story:
