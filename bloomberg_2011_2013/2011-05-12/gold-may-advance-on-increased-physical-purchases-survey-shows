Gold may gain as investors and
consumers boost physical purchases of the metal, a survey found.  Eleven of 16 traders, investors and analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg, or 69 percent, said bullion will rise next week.
Three predicted lower prices and two were neutral. Gold for June
delivery was up 0.3 percent for this week at $1,496.10 an ounce
by 11:35 a.m. yesterday on the Comex in  New York . It reached a
record $1,577.40 on May 2.  Gold dropped 5.2 percent from its all-time high as
commodities including copper and oil slipped on speculation of
slowing economic growth as governments raise  interest rates  to
contain inflation. UBS AG on May 11 said its bullion sales to
 India , the biggest buyer, are more than 10 percent higher so far
this year, compared with the same period last year.  “Since the start of May, physical gold demand has been
strong,” said Walter de Wet, an analyst at Standard Bank Plc in
London. “While consistent physical buying interest has come
from India specifically, we are witnessing a broader interest
from  Asia  in general.”  The attached chart tracks the results of the Bloomberg
survey, with the red bars derived by subtracting bearish
forecasts from bullish estimates. Readings below zero signal
that most respondents expect a decline. The green line shows the
gold price. The data are as of May 6.  The weekly gold survey, that started about seven years ago,
has forecast prices accurately in 208 of 362 weeks, or 57
percent of the time.  This week’s survey results: Bullish: 11 Bearish: 3 Neutral: 2  To contact the reporter on this story:
