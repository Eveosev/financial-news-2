(Corrects series score in second paragraph.)  The Miami Heat beat the  Boston
Celtics  97-87 to clinch their National Basketball Association
playoff series.  The Heat advance to the Eastern Conference finals after
winning the best-of-seven series by four games to one.  Miami will play the  Chicago Bulls  or Atlanta Hawks for a
place in the NBA Finals. That series resumes tomorrow with the
Bulls leading 3-2 in games.  It’s the first time Miami has reached the conference finals
since its championship-winning run in 2006. The series win
avenges a first-round exit to the Celtics in last year’s
playoffs.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
