LyondellBasell Industries NV (LYB) , the
second-biggest North American producer of ethylene, said global
demand for the raw material used in plastics will outpace supply
additions through 2015, leading to shortages.  Ethylene demand will rise by at least 70 billion pounds
through 2015, driven mostly by  Asia , requiring 35 new crackers,
as ethylene plants are known, Chief Executive Officer Jim Gallogly said today in a webcast presentation. No more than 24
crackers will be built in that period, leading to shortages and
wider margins for producers such as Rotterdam-based
LyondellBasell, he said.  “That is a lot of crackers and you haven’t seen anything
close to that being announced,” Gallogly said at the Barclays
Chemical ROC Stars Conference in  New York .  “There should be a demand kick-up and a supply shortage
and, as a result, a peak” in profit margins, he said.  Low natural-gas prices relative to oil will continue to
benefit LyondellBasell’s U.S. factories as more ethane is
extracted from shale gas through 2013, providing enough raw
materials to supply five new crackers, Gallogly said.
LyondellBasell is focusing on getting more ethylene from
existing crackers and may partner with others to build more
capacity, Gallogly said.  LyondellBasell fell 89 cents, or 2.1 percent, to $41.33 at
4:15 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The
shares have gained 20 percent this year.  Dow Chemical Co. (DOW)  is the largest ethylene producer in  North
America .  To contact the reporter on this story:
