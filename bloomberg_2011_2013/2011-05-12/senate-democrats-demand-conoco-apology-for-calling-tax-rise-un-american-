Senate Democrats  Charles Schumer  of
 New York  and  Robert Menendez  of  New Jersey  pressed
 ConocoPhillips (COP)  Chief Executive Officer James Mulva to apologize
for calling their tax change proposal “un-American.”  Mulva, asked if the statement yesterday was meant to say
the plan’s supporters, such as Menendez or President Barack
Obama, aren’t patriots, said today the statement wasn’t directed
at any lawmaker.  To contact the reporter on this story:
