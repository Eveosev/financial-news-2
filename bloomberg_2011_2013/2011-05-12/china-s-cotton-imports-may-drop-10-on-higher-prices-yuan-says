China , the world’s largest cotton
importer, may cut purchases by as much as 10 percent this year
because of higher prices and borrowing costs, said Yuan Haiying,
a Beijing-based consultant who advises companies.  Demand will decline as the government seeks to curb
inflation and mills use more man-made textiles, according to
Yuan, who has been tracking the agriculture industry in China
for the past 20 years. The central bank has raised  interest
rates  four times since October to curb inflation.  Cotton imports plunged 35 percent in April from a year
earlier, data from the China National Cotton Exchange show. The
country canceled orders for more than 100,000 bales last month,
the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  said. A bale weighs 480
pounds, or 218 kilograms. Prices in New York have plunged 34
percent since touching a record high of $2.197 a pounds in
March, mainly on higher demand from the Asian nation.  “Demand was bound to slowdown as that kind of growth was
not sustainable,” Yuan said today during an interview in
 Washington  while attending an industry conference. “We could
see prices come down further.”  China’s imports totaled 2.84 million metric tons last year,
according to customs data. That’s the most since 2006, when
purchases were a record 3.47 million tons, Bloomberg data show.
The Asian nation is the largest grower and user of the
commodity.  To contact the reporter on this story:
