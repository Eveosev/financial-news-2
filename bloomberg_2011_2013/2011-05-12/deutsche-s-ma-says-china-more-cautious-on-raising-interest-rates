Ma Jun, chief  China  economist for
Deutsche Bank AG, comments on the People’s Bank of China’s
decision to raise the reserve requirement for the nation’s
lenders by 0.5 percentage points from May 18.  “The decision to hike the reserve requirement ratio may
also suggest that the People’s Bank of China is relatively more
cautious in raising  interest rates , which have a direct impact
on the real economy.  “After this hike, the reserve requirement ratio for large
banks will reach 21%. This reflects the need for the central
bank to sterilize the liquidity from the maturing of PBOC bills,
resumption of trade surpluses from a deficit in the first
quarter to a surplus of $11 billion in April, and continued
capital inflows.  “The deceleration of IP growth reported yesterday as well
as the views from within the government calling for ‘avoiding
policy overtightening’ should have some influence on interest
rate decisions. We expect one more rate hike in the remainder of
this year.”  --Zheng Lifei. Editor:  John Liu   To contact Bloomberg News staff on this story:
