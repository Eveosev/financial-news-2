Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY)  Chairman Win Bischoff isn’t planning to step down before the U.K. begins to
sell its 41 percent stake back to the public and said he will
still be at the bank “in one or two years,” the Financial
Times reported, citing an interview.  Lloyds, which the U.K.’s Independent Commission on
Banking’s April report suggested should divest “substantially”
more branches than the 600 it was ordered to shed by the
European Commission, “firmly” believes that 600 branches “is
enough,” Bischoff said, according to the FT.  To contact the reporter on this story:
