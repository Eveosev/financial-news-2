The outperformance by utilities over
energy stocks suggests the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index may
extend a decline from its 2011 peak, StockCharts.com said.  The  S&P 500 Utilities Index (S5UTIL) ’s relative price ratio to its
energy counterpart climbed to 0.31 yesterday, the highest level
since Jan. 25, Bloomberg data show. A rising ratio indicates
utilities shares are performing better than energy stocks.  “Recent rotations out of economically-sensitive sectors
like energy and materials, and into defensive sectors like
consumer staples, health care and utilities, is usually a sign
of a market in need of a correction or consolidation,”  John Murphy , chief technical analyst at StockCharts.com, wrote in a
note yesterday.  The  S&P 500  has dropped 1.6 percent from a 35-month high on
April 29 amid concern accelerating global inflation will lead to
higher interest rates, hurting economic growth. During this
period, energy shares and raw-materials producers were the worst
performers, slumping 7.8 percent and 4.3 percent as a group,
respectively. Utilities and health-care shares gained the most,
rising 1.6 percent and 1.5 percent, respectively.  Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. (FCX) , the largest publicly
traded copper producer, crossed below its average price during
the past 200 days yesterday for the first time since May 2010.
At the same time, companies that sell necessities such as  Dr
Pepper Snapple Group Inc. (DPS)  had “bullish breakouts,” Murphy
said. Dr Pepper, maker of 7Up and Canada Dry soda-pop brands,
climbed to $40.75 yesterday, the highest price since it was spun
off from Cadbury Plc in 2008.  “The downside correction in commodities probably has more
to go,” Murphy said.  Technical analysts study charts of trading patterns and
prices to predict changes in a security, commodity, currency or
index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
