Braskem SA (BRKM5) ,  Latin America ’s largest
petrochemicals producer, rose to the highest price in two weeks
after first-quarter net income increased 13-fold.  The shares gained 4 percent to 22.75 reais at the close of
Sao Paulo trading at 4:15 p.m. New York time, the highest level
since April 29. The Bovespa index rose 0.4 percent to 64,003.16.  “Higher  oil prices  helped boost revenues,” said Nelson Rodrigues de Matos, an analyst at Banco do Brasil SA, in a
telephone interview. “Even with a stronger real, domestic
prices for oil derivates increased, which was positive for the
company.”  Braskem reported first-quarter net income excluding
minority interest of 308 million reais ($190 million), from 23
million reais a year earlier, according to a regulatory filing.
Net revenue increased 57 percent to 7.4 billion reais, the
company said in the filing.  Braskem also benefitted from a stronger real as it has more
debts than assets linked to foreign currencies, the company said
in the filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
