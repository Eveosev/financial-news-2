Benetton Group SpA (BEN) ,  Italy ’s largest
clothing company, said the impact on profitability of higher
garment costs will become more evident in the second quarter
amid consumer “uncertainty” in western economies.  “The strong growth in costs, especially of cotton and
wool, is leading to a significant erosion of margins,” the
Ponzano, Italy-based company said in a statement today.  Higher cotton prices and labor costs in  Asia  have increased
the amount clothing companies have to pay suppliers. Benetton
said today that first-quarter net income fell to 19.4 million
euros ($27.5 million) from 20 million euros a year earlier. That
beat the 17.6 million average estimate of five analysts in a
Bloomberg survey. Sales eased 0.9 percent to 453 million euros.  “For the rest of the year, the contribution of the more
recently developed countries will be fundamental to maintain
group revenue, in the face of continued uncertainty of demand in
western economies,” said Benetton, which makes about 80 percent
of its sales in  Europe .  The shares fell as much as 2.7 percent and traded down 11
cents, or 2 percent, at 5.54 euros as of 4:11 p.m., giving the
company a market value of about 1 billion euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
