Amlin Plc (AML) , the biggest Lloyd’s of
London insurer by market value, said revenue in the first four
months of the year rose 14 percent, boosted by its U.K.
commercial unit.  Gross written premiums climbed to 1.1 billion pounds ($1.8
billion) in the four months to April 30, compared with 964
million pounds in the year earlier period, the London-based firm
said today in a statement. Rates charged for renewed policies
declined 0.4 percent in the period, Amlin said.  Rival Lloyd’s insurer  Hiscox Ltd. (HSX)  this week said first
quarter sales dropped 8 percent as the prices paid by customers
fell in a “tough” market. Insurers face claims from the
biggest Japanese earthquake on record in March which is
estimated to cost the industry between $21 billion and $34
billion, according to catastrophe modeler Risk Management
Solutions Inc.  “Rates are now showing signs of improvement, particularly
in loss-affected territories,” Chief Executive Officer Charles Philipps said in the statement. “The combination of
international loss events and loss modeling changes made by a
major catastrophe modeling firm is resulting in increasing
rates,” in the U.S., he said.  Amlin’s revenue was driven by its U.K. commercial division
where sales were up 60 percent to 102.6 million pounds. The
insurer’s Lloyd’s revenue, which covers companies against
natural catastrophes, rose 4.9 percent to 512.1 million pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
