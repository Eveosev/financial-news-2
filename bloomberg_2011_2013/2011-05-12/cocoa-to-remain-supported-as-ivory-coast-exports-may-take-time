Ivory Coast , the world’s largest
cocoa grower, may not be able to ship all of the beans put in
storage during months of unrest in the short term, Friedberg
Mercantile Group Ltd. said.  Shipments from the country were disrupted during a five-
month power struggle as President Alassane Ouattara imposed an
export ban in a bid to cut off funds to former leader  Laurent Gbagbo , who refused to step down after a disputed Nov. 28
election. Ouattara was sworn in last week and the ban was lifted
last month.  “We remain bullish and advise hanging on to
long positions,” Sholom Sanik, an analyst at Toronto-based
Friedberg wrote in a report e-mailed yesterday.  “Ivorian exports have resumed, but it seems that the
existing infrastructure cannot accommodate shipping 500,000 tons
of cocoa in a short period of time,” Sanik said.  Monthly exports during the main crop, which runs from
October to March, are usually about 100,000 tons, he said. “In
the short term the market will remain somewhat squeezed,” even
as beans start reaching chocolate manufacturers, he said.  Barry Callebaut AG (BARN) , the world’s largest maker of bulk
chocolate, resumed exports of cocoa products from Ivory Coast on
May 8. Its first vessel left the port of  San Pedro  and was
destined for  Europe , Raphael Wermuth, a spokesman for the
company, said on May 10. Other container shipments headed for
the U.S.,  Mexico  and Europe will leave San Pedro and the port of
Abidjan this week, he said.  Mid-Crop Forecast Cut  A reduced mid-crop, the smaller of two harvests in Ivory
Coast, will also help support prices. The total Ivorian crop is
unlikely to reach the 1.3 million tons forecast for the 2010-11
season as beans were smuggled into Ghana, Sanik said.  “A good chunk has made its way to ports in  Ghana  and is
being counted as that country’s output,” he said, commenting on
the main crop. “The Ivorian mid-crop which was expected to
reach 300,000 tons, is now estimated to reach only 200,000 tons
because of labor problems.”  Cocoa rallied as much as 34 percent this year on the ICE
Futures U.S. exchange in New York, touching $3,775 on March 4,
the highest since 1979. Beans for July delivery are still about
55 percent above the 10-year average.  Cocoa for July delivery dropped 17 pounds, or 0.89 percent,
to 1,895 pounds ($3,089) a ton by 10:45 a.m. on NYSE Liffe in
 London . Cocoa for July delivery slid $50, or 1.6 percent, to
$3,069 a ton on ICE Futures U.S. in  New York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
