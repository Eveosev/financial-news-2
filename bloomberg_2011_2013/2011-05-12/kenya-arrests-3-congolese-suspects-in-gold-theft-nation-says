Kenyan police arrested three
Congolese men allegedly involved in the theft of an estimated
$113 million of gold from Democratic Republic of Congo, the
 Daily Nation  said, without saying how it got the information.  Authorities had been trailing the group of suspects and
apprehended them yesterday at an alleged hideout in the capital,
Nairobi, the Nairobi-based newspaper reported today. Police
seized laptops and several vehicles, the newspaper said.  In March, Kenyaâ€™s President Mwai Kibaki and his Congolese
counterpart Joseph Kabila ordered a joint probe into speculation
that 2.5 tons of the metal were allegedly smuggled from Congo to
the East African nation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
