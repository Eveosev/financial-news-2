Mabey Bridge Ltd., a U.K. bridge
engineer, opened a 38 million-pound ($62 million) wind turbine
tower factory in south  Wales , the company said.  The plant in Chepstow, the only one in the U.K., was opened
today by Minister for Energy and Climate Change  Charles Hendry ,
the company said today in an e-mailed statement. The facility
can produce 300 tubular steel towers a year, each 80 meters (262
feet) long and weighing 150 metric tons, the company said.  The engineering company is already making nine towers for
Hamburg-based turbine-maker  Repower Systems AG (RPW) , to be installed
at two wind farms in Yorkshire. The factory has created 240
jobs, Mabey Bridge said.  “This is exactly the kind of investment, generating green
jobs, that we want to see as the U.K. supply chain develops,”
Hendry said in the statement. “Today’s inauguration is a huge
step forward for the renewables industry in Wales, and the UK
sector as a whole.”  The move marks the “culmination” of  Mabey Bridge ’s move
into renewables, according to the company, which has been
building bridges for 162 years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
