The United Nations and African Union
 mission  in  Darfur  said it will work with  Sudan ’s government to
try to raise $1.43 billion for water projects in the western
Sudanese region at a donors conference in June.  “The scarcity of water and lack of water management in
Darfur, compounded with a fast-growing population, has
contributed to conflict in Darfur,” the peacekeeping mission,
based in El Fasher in North Darfur state, said today in an e-
mailed statement.  The conference, organized by the UN and the Sudanese
government, aims to attract more than 200 participants to fund
56 water projects, according to the statement. The event will be
held in the capital, Khartoum, June 27 and 28, it said.  The  Organization of the Islamic Conference , the Muslim
world’s biggest group, raised $850 million at a donors
conference for Darfur reconstruction in Cairo in March last
year, less than its aim of $2 billion.  Fighting in Darfur exploded in 2003 when insurgents took up
arms, accusing the government of neglecting the region. The
conflict has led to the deaths of as many as 300,000 people,
mainly due to illness and starvation, and forced about 2.7
million to flee their homes, according to UN estimates. The
Sudanese government has put the death toll at about 10,000.  To contact the reporter on this story:
