31,613.55 at 1:44 p.m. in Johannesburg.  The following were among the most active stocks in the
South African market today.  Anglo American Plc (AGL)  , the diversified miner that
makes up 10 percent of the index, fell for a second day, losing
8.19 rand, or 2.4 percent, to 326.81 rand. Copper dropped to a
five-month low, while zinc and lead declined on concern that
 China  may continue monetary tightening after inflation spread
beyond food, damping the demand outlook in the world’s largest

biggest mining company, lost 5.80 rand, or 2.2 percent, to
263.50 rand, heading for the lowest since March 28.  Eastern Platinum Ltd. (ELR)  , a producer of the metal in
 South Africa , headed for the weakest close since Aug. 31,
falling 54 cents, or 6.8 percent, to 7.40 rand. Ongoing
unprotected industrial action, including an unlawful blockade at
the entrance of its Crocodile River Mine, may require the
commencement of legal action from today, the company said in a
regulatory filing.  Impala Platinum Holdings Ltd. (IMP)  , the world’s second-
biggest producer of the metal, fell for a second day, losing
3.47 rand, or 1.9 percent, to 181.26 rand. Platinum dropped 1.2
percent to $1,755.22 an ounce.  Old Mutual Plc (OML)  , the third-biggest insurer in the

quarter through March, the company reported in a regulatory
filing today.  Sasol Ltd. (SOL)  , the world’s biggest maker of motor
fuel from coal, snapped two days of gains, losing 7.51 rand, or
2.1 percent, to 352.99 rand. The  International Energy Agency 
trimmed its 2011 global oil demand forecast for the first time
as this year’s price rally begins to weigh on consumers. The
