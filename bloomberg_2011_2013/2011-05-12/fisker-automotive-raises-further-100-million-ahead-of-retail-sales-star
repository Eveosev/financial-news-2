Fisker Automotive Inc., a maker of
luxury plug-in hybrid sports cars, is raising an additional $100
million as the startup company prepares to deliver its first
production vehicles to retail customers.  Fisker disclosed the additional funds today in a filing
with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, without
identifying the investors. The company, based in Irvine,
 California , completed a $190 million financing round in March.  The company, founded by auto designer Henrik Fisker, began
making the $88,000 rechargeable Karma sports car in March at
Valmet Automotive Oy’s plant in Uusikaupunki,  Finland . Full
production of the vehicle, capable of traveling 50 miles solely
on electricity before a gasoline engines powers the wheels, is
set to begin after the first 3,000 customers receive their cars.  Roger Ormisher, a company spokesman, didn’t immediately
return a call seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
