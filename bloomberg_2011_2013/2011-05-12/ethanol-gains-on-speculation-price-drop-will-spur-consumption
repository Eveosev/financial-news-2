Ethanol futures gained in  Chicago 
amid speculation that the fuel’s 5.9 percent price drop this
month and its discount to gasoline will spur demand.  The biofuel followed corn higher on optimism that exports
will rise for the grain and that refiners will use more ethanol,
whose discount to gasoline has been at least 50 cents since
April 11. Refiners also collect a 45-cent tax credit per gallon
mixed into the motor fuel.  “People jumped in with a chance to do some hedging,” said
Matt Janney, a trader at Citigroup Global Markets Inc. in
Chicago. “All of a sudden people want to take advantage of the
prices here. With the break in the market, you saw a pickup in
demand.”  Denatured ethanol for June delivery rose 1.1 cents, or 0.4
percent, to $2.492 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade.
Futures have gained 4.8 percent this year. The discount to
gasoline was 57.19 cents.  Ethanol had fallen in May before today after separate
government reports showed ample supply of the fuel against
lagging gasoline demand and a higher-than-expected forecast for
corn stockpiles.  Prices also gained as the dollar weakened against the euro,
boosting investor appeal for raw materials, Janney said.  Corn futures for July delivery gained 3.25 cents, or 0.5
percent, to $6.805 a bushel in Chicago. One bushel makes at
least 2.75 gallons of ethanol.  To contact the reporter on this story:
