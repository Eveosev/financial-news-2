Italy’s finance police seized 17
million euros ($24 million) of assets from  BNP Paribas (BNP)  SA’s
Italian unit as part of a probe into the sale of derivatives to
the cities of Messina and Taormina.  BNP’s Banca Nazionale del Lavoro SpA allegedly committed
fraud by misleading the cities on swaps, the finance police said
in an e-mailed statement. The assets that have been seized
represent the alleged hidden fees that BNL charged on the swaps
from 2002 through 2007, the police said.  BNL said the Rome-based bank acted properly and that the
seizure is unwarranted, according to an e-mailed statement.
Misunderstandings are at the basis of the cases, BNL said,
adding that it will appeal to overturn the seizure.  Public authorities across  Europe  tried to cut borrowing
costs in recent years through derivatives deals whose risks they
couldn’t measure. In  Italy , Deutsche Bank AG, Depfa Bank Plc,
JPMorgan & Co. and UBS AG are on trial over allegedly fraudulent
selling practices on swaps, the first such case. The banks have
denied wrongdoing.  An imbalance of information between the lender and its
customers allowed BNL officials to mislead the municipalities,
the police said in the statement. The derivative contracts,
which should have cut the cost of the cities’ fixed-interest
payments on the debt, added fees and losses, according to the
police.  To contact the reporter on this story:
