Palm Hills Developments SAE (PHDC)  fell to a
record low, leading a drop among  Egypt ’s real-estate developers,
after Deutsche Bank AG said the company appears the most
vulnerable among developers from “a liquidity standpoint.”  The shares tumbled 3.1 percent to 1.55 Egyptian pounds, the
lowest since they were listed in May 2008, at 12:12 p.m. in
Cairo. Talaat Moustaaf Group, the country’s largest publicly
traded property developer, declined 0.9 percent to 3.31 pounds.
The benchmark EGX 30 Index retreated 0.4 percent.  The nation’s property developers are likely to report
“weak” first-quarter earnings after construction was halted
during protests that ended president Hosni Mubarak’s 30-year
rule and the government challenged past land purchases, Deutsche
Bank said. The biggest developers including Talaat Moustafa,
 Palm Hills  and  Six of October Development & Investment (OCDI)  Co., or
Sodic, will face a “challenging year” in 2011, analysts
Athmane Benzerroug and Nabil Ahmed wrote in a note to investors.  “We expect a 10 to 15 percent backlog cancellation and
zero pre-sales for 2011,” the analysts wrote. “From a
liquidity standpoint, Palm Hills appears the most vulnerable,
while Sodic is most resilient given a solid balance sheet.”  Sodic slipped 1.4 percent to 55 pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
