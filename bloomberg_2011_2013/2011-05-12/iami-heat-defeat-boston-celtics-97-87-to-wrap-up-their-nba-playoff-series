The Miami Heat scored 16 unanswered
points at the end of the fourth quarter to beat the Boston
Celtics 97-87 and clinch their National Basketball Association
playoff series.  LeBron James  scored the last 10 points and had two 3-
pointers in the closing four minutes at AmericanAirlines Arena
in Miami as the Heat took control to finish off the best-of-
seven series by four games to one.  Miami will play the Chicago Bulls or  Atlanta Hawks  for a
place in the NBA finals. That Eastern Conference semifinal
series resumes tomorrow with the Bulls leading 3-2 in games.  It’s the first time Miami has reached the conference finals
since its championship-winning run in 2006. The series win
avenges a first-round exit to the Celtics in last year’s
playoffs.  The Celtics led 87-81 with 4 minutes, 15 seconds left in
the game.  Dwyane Wade  began Miami’s run with a free throw. James Jones added a 24-foot 3-pointer and Miami tied it on a Chris Bosh dunk. James followed with a pair of 3-pointers and two
field goals to secure the win.  Wade led the Heat with 34 points and 10 rebounds, James
contributed 33 points and Bosh had 14 points and 11 rebounds.  Ray Allen  had 18 points for the Celtics, while  Kevin Garnett  had 15 points and 11 rebounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
