Indian shares dropped the most in a
week after the nation’s industrial production expanded at the
fastest pace in five months, fueling concern stronger demand
will stoke inflation and prompt central bank to raise rates.  Housing Development Finance Corp. (HDFC) , the nation’s biggest
mortgage lender, fell to a seven-week low. Output at plants,
utilities and mines rose 7.3 percent in March from a year
earlier after a revised 3.7 percent gain in February, the trade
ministry said today. The median estimate of 30 economists in a
Bloomberg News survey was for a 4 percent gain. Sterlite
Industries ( India ) Ltd., the largest copper and zinc producer,
dropped 5.3 percent, pacing losses in metal shares as commodity
prices declined.  The Bombay Stock Exchange Sensitive Index, or Sensex, sank
237.49, or 1.3 percent, to 18,347.47, according to preliminary
closing prices at 3:30 p.m. in Mumbai. The S&P CNX Nifty Index
on the National Stock Exchange dropped 1.4 percent to 5,484.75.
Its May futures settled at 5,486.60. The BSE 200 Index lost 1.2
percent to 2,268.19.  To contact the reporter on this story:
