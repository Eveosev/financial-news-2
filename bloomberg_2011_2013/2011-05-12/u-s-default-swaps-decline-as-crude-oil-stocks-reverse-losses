The cost of protecting U.S. corporate
bonds from default fell after crude oil and equities recovered
from earlier losses.  The Markit CDX North America Investment Grade Index, which
investors use to hedge against losses on corporate debt or to
speculate on creditworthiness, fell 0.7 basis point to a mid-
price of 88.5 basis points as of 1:33 p.m. in  New York ,
according to index administrator Markit Group Ltd.  Investors are betting credit markets will strengthen even
as commodities and stocks fluctuate, with crude oil for June
delivery climbing 1 percent following an earlier plunge after
the  International Energy Agency  cut 2011 demand forecast.  “Credit’s remaining strong while other markets are
catching up,” said Michael Reiner, a New York-based credit
strategist at Societe Generale SA, in a telephone interview.
“We’ve come off an exceptionally strong earnings period with
corporate America really at the peak of health.”  Among 429 companies in the  Standard & Poor’s  500 index that
have reported earnings for the first quarter of 2011, 309 have
posted results that exceeded analysts’ estimates, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Crude oil for June delivery climbed $1.02 to $99.23 a
barrel at 1:23 p.m. on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . The
Standard & Poor’s 500 advanced 6.42 points, or 0.5 percent.  Paris-based IEA reduced its estimate for worldwide fuel
consumption by 190,000 barrels a day, or 0.2 percent, in a
monthly report today. Demand will still grow this year by 1.3
million barrels a day, or 1.5 percent, to 89.18 million a day.  “When commodities find a day or two of stability, as we
saw a couple days ago, we expect credit to return to its slow
grind tighter,” Reiner wrote in a note to clients this morning.  The credit swaps index, which typically falls as investor
confidence improves and rises as it deteriorates, is down from
as high as 96.8 basis points on March 22.  Credit swaps pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails
to meet its obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A
basis point equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10
million of debt.  To contact the reporters on this story:
