Greek police clashed with a group of
protesters in central  Athens  who targeted immigrants after the
murder this week of a 44-year old Greek man, state-run NET Radio
reported, citing reports from the scene.   Protesters chanted the Greek national anthem and attempted
to damage homes and stores owned by non-Greeks, NET said. Police
are attempting to stop those protesters from clashing with
another group that is gathering to protect immigrants, according
to the Athens-based radio station.       Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
