Ambac Financial Group Inc. (ABKFQ) , the
bankrupt holding company for a failed bond insurer, reported a
net loss of $939.9 million for March.  The  net loss  included $908 million in losses since the Nov.
8 bankruptcy filing tied to a wholly owned subsidiary, New York-
based Ambac said in documents filed yesterday in  U.S. Bankruptcy
Court  in Manhattan.  Professional fees for the Chapter 11 case have totaled $16
million, Ambac said. Cash fell to $36.1 million as of March 31
from $38.6 million at the start of the month. The company likely
will be able to exit bankruptcy, though a Chapter 7 liquidation
is possible, Ambac said in a quarterly filing to the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission.  Ambac’s court reports are prepared in a format different
from its financial statements to the SEC. Ambac’s loss was
$819.3 million, or $2.71 a share, for the three months ended
March 31, according to the  quarterly SEC filing . In previous
court reports, Ambac listed losses of $37 million in February
and $83 million in January.  Since entering bankruptcy, Ambac has clashed with parties
including its operating unit,  Ambac Assurance  Corp., over who
gets $7.3 billion in net operating losses to use for tax
benefits. The  Internal Revenue Service  has challenged claims by
both companies to tax benefits.  Liquidation Outcome  If Ambac liquidates, it won’t be able to use such losses
for tax benefits, the company said in its quarterly filing.  Ambac Assurance was the second-largest bond insurer before
the 2008 financial crisis, when mounting defaults on mortgages
swamped the company with claims. It guaranteed around $256
billion of $1.4 trillion in insured municipal debt, according to
Bloomberg data. Ambac listed liabilities of $1.68 billion in its
petition.  The holding company case is In re Ambac Financial Group
Inc., 10-15973, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of  New
York  (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
