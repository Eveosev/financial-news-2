Russian stocks fell to the lowest
level in five months as oil, gold and silver dropped, cutting
revenue for the country’s commodity exporters.  The Micex Index of 30 stocks lost 1.5 percent to 1,630.78
at the 6:45 p.m. close in Moscow, the weakest level since Dec.
1. OAO Lukoil and OAO Rosneft,  Russia ’s two largest oil
producers, fell 2.9 percent and 0.7 percent, respectively. OAO
Polymetal, a producer of silver and gold, sank 4.9 percent to
the lowest closing price since Oct. 1. The dollar-denominated
RTS Index slid 2.3 percent to 1,864.95.  Crude for June delivery retreated as much as $2.96 per
barrel and last traded 0.5 percent lower at $97.66 a barrel in
 New York . Silver lost 5.4 percent to $33.6275 per ounce today,
while gold fell 0.6 percent to $1,490.73 per ounce.  “For investors that have been wary of Russia risk this
year, the combination of falling oil, stronger dollar and fresh
fears over the strength of global recovery vindicates their
cautious stance over the short term,”  Chris Weafer , chief
strategist at UralSib Financial Corp., wrote in an e-mailed
note.  The ruble depreciated 1.3 percent to 28.03 per dollar, the
weakest closing level since April 20.  To contact the reporter on this story:
