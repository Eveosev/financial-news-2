The U.S. Justice Department filed a
civil antitrust lawsuit in Washington to block  VeriFone Systems
Inc. (PAY)  from buying  Hypercom Corp. (HYC) , saying the proposed deal would
hurt competition in the market for point-of-sale terminals in
the U.S.  Hypercom’s proposal to sell its U.S. unit to  Ingenico (ING)  SA
“does not resolve the significant competitive concerns posed by
the merger, and in some ways exacerbates them,” the government
said today in an e-mailed statement on the filing of the suit.  VeriFone fell $3.36, or 7.2 percent, to $46.82 at 3:55 p.m.
in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. Hypercom fell
$1.23, or 11 percent, to $9.66.  Point-of-sale terminals are used by retailers to accept
electronic payments such as credit and debit cards, the
statement said.  VeriFone, based in  San Jose , California, the second-largest
maker of electronic payment equipment, and Hypercom, based in
Scottsdale, Arizona, together control more than 60 percent of
the U.S. market for terminals used by the largest retailers.  They are two of only three substantial sellers of other
types of point-of-sale terminals, the Justice Department said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
