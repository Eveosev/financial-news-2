Gamesa Corporacion Tecnologica SA
posted profit of 13 million euros ($18.5 million) in the first
quarter, above analysts’ estimates, helped by foreign sales.  Net income rose from 8 million euros in the year earlier
period, the company said in a regulatory filing. Analysts were
expecting earnings of 10.5 million euros, according to the
average of six responses in a Bloomberg survey. Revenue advanced
to 585 million euros from 474 million euros a year earlier and
the company said it maintained its forecasts for 2011.  Gamesa is boosting sales in Brazil,  India  and  China  as
demand dwindles in  Europe . Chief Executive Officer Jorge Calvet
said in February Gamesa may this year make no sales in its home
market of Spain, which accounted for a third of revenue in 2009.  Vestas Wind Systems A/S, the biggest turbine maker, lost 85
million euros in the first quarter as Europe’s debt crisis
slowed clean-energy investment. The stock has lost about a third
of its value since the beginning of last month.  Demand for  wind turbines  is set to rise 19 percent this
year to 42.7 gigawatts as China and the U.S. ramp up investment,
according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance. Manufacturers are
likely to face ongoing margin pressure as global capacity
exceeds demand by almost 50 percent, BNEF says.  To contact the reporter on this story:
