Grain loadings for export from the
French port of Rouen,  Europe ’s biggest cereal-shipping hub,
rose 6.9 percent in the week through yesterday, boosted by the
biggest barley shipments since at least August.  Outbound shipments were 203,620 metric tons between May 5
and May 11, including 120,713 tons of wheat and 80,282 tons of
barley, the  Seine River port  said in an e-mailed statement
today. Loadings rose from 190,481 tons a week earlier.  Algeria  was the biggest export destination with 73,312
tons of wheat, followed by Syria and  Spain  with 33,199 tons and
30,113 tons of feed barley, respectively.  Algeria, North Africa’s second-largest wheat buyer after
 Egypt , bought 2.95 million tons of wheat between Dec. 16 and
Jan. 26, probably a record for a five-week period, French crops
office FranceAgriMer reported in February.  France ’s other main grain ports are La Pallice in the Bay
of Biscay and Dunkirk on the North Sea coast.  Rouen grain loadings by destination, in tons:  To contact the reporter on this story:
