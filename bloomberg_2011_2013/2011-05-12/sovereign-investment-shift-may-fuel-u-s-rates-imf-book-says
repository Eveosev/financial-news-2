A shift by sovereign wealth funds to
riskier assets may lead to higher  interest rates  in the U.S. as
demand for American debt declines, according to a book released
by the  International Monetary Fund  in Beijing today.  The change may have a “minimal” affect on the dollar as
sovereign wealth funds seeking greater returns shift to U.S.
equities and alternatives, according to the book entitled
Economics of Sovereign Wealth Funds, which was released as the
International Forum of Sovereign Wealth Funds held meetings in
the Chinese capital this week.  A rebalancing of the global economy may cause national
savings in U.S. creditor nations to decline, weakening demand
for American debt. The diversification of those nation’s foreign
reserves may lead to a more subdued outlook for net capital
flows to the U.S., according to the book.  Sovereign wealth fund assets under management may rise to
between $4 trillion and $6 trillion by 2014, from estimates of
between $1.8 trillion to $2.4 trillion at the end of 2008,
according to the book.  --Zhang Dingmin. Editor:  John Liu   To contact Bloomberg News staff on this story:
