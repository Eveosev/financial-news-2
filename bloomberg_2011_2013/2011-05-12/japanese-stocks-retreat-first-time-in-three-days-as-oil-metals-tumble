Japanese stocks fell for the first
time in three days as commodities tumbled amid concern that
global inflation may curb economic growth.  Inpex Corp. (1605) , the nation’s largest oil explorer, slumped 3.6
percent, even after saying full-year profit advanced.  Nikon
Corp. (7731) , a camera maker that gets a quarter of its revenue from
Europe, lost 1.9 percent as the euro weakened against the yen on
concern European leaders are slowing the drive to grant Greece
additional aid.  Tokyo  Electric Power Co. plunged 8.8 percent
after saying fuel rods are fully exposed in the No. 1 reactor at
its stricken Fukushima Dai-Ichi nuclear plant.  “Falling commodity prices and concern about European issues
are reducing investors’ appetite for risk,” said  Kiyoshi Ishigane , a senior strategist in Tokyo at Mitsubishi UFJ Asset
Management Co., which oversees about $84 billion.  The  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average fell 1.5 percent to 9,716.65
at the 3 p.m. close of trading in Tokyo. The broader Topix slid
1 percent to 849.34, with more than four times as many shares
declining as advancing. Both gauges fell to the lowest level
since April 27.  The Topix Index 12-month price target was reduced by 8
percent to 970 by Goldman Sachs Group Inc. in a report dated
yesterday. The brokerage cited a “more muted market recovery”
following the March 11 magnitude-9 earthquake and tsunami that
devastated  Japan ’s northeast coast, disabled a nuclear power
plant and disrupted supply chains at companies.  Tepco Plunges  Tokyo Electric, operator of the power plant crippled by the
temblor, plunged 8.8 percent to 479 yen after the utility said
fuel rods are fully exposed at its reactor, setting back its
plan to resolve the crisis. Tepco had the second-largest drop in
Nikkei 225 after Toho Zinc Co., which forecast lower profit
after the quake damaged its factories.  The Topix has tumbled 8.8 percent since March 10, the day
before the earthquake. In the period through yesterday’s close,
the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index gained 3.6 percent and the Stoxx
 Europe  600 Index rose 2.1 percent.  The  S&P 500  slumped 1.1 percent to 1,342.08 yesterday in
 New York , its biggest drop since March 16, as commodities
tumbled amid a strengthening dollar and inflation concerns.  “The inflation concern is causing investors to avoid risk
assets,” said  Mitsushige Akino , who oversees about $600 million
in Tokyo at Ichiyoshi Investment Management Co. “That is the
underlying reason for a slump in the commodity market and the
weaker euro.”  Oil Tumbles  Oil companies  fell the most in the Topix’s 33 industry
groups. Inpex slumped 3.6 percent to 563,000 yen even after
saying full-year net income rose 20 percent to 128.7 billion yen
($1.6 billion), beating its forecast by 7.2 percent. Japan
Drilling Co., an offshore contractor, slipped 2.3 percent to
3,015 yen.  Crude oil for June delivery plunged 5.5 percent to settle
at $98.21 a barrel yesterday in New York after an Energy
Department report showed that U.S. supplies surged as demand for
fuel slipped.  Mitsubishi Corp. (8058) , Japan’s biggest commodities trader, slid
2 percent to 2,112 yen and Mitsui & Co., a trading house that
counts commodities as its largest source of profit, sank 1.4
percent to 1,391 yen.  Copper yesterday fell to the lowest price in five months
after China reported inflation remains above the government’s
target, signaling further monetary-policy tightening that may
curb metal demand. Consumer prices rose 5.3 percent from a year
earlier and banks extended 740 billion yuan ($114 billion) of
local-currency loans, according to reports yesterday from the
statistics bureau and central bank.  Metal Drops  The London Metal Exchange Index of six metals including
copper and aluminum lost 1.9 percent yesterday, its first drop
in four days. Gold futures fell in New York as a stronger dollar
eroded the appeal of the precious metal as an alternative asset.
Silver also slid.  Nikon slipped 1.9 percent to 1,660 yen and Nintendo Co., a
video-game console maker that gets a third of its revenue from
Europe, sank 2 percent to 18,600 yen.  The euro fell against most major counterparts as
speculation that European leaders are slowing the drive to grant
 Greece  additional aid fueled concern the nation may have to
restructure debt.  The European currency depreciated to as low as 114.57 yen
today in Tokyo, the weakest level since March 28. A weaker euro
cuts the value of European income at Japanese companies when
converted into their home currency.  Company Earnings  In Japan, this week is the peak for earnings results, with
more than 60 percent of the Topix index’s 1,673 companies
scheduled to report. Of the 927 companies in the Topix index
that have reported results since April 1, 169 have exceeded
analysts’ estimates, while 182 have missed them, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Toho Zinc, Japan’s third-biggest producer of the metal,
plunged 9.5 percent to 391 yen. The company yesterday said it
expects a 54 percent drop in net income to 3.5 billion yen this
fiscal year on lower production in the wake of the earthquake.  Fujikura Ltd. (5803)  , a cable maker, tumbled 8.2 percent to 381
yen after forecasting net income will fall 36 percent, while
Citizen Holdings Co., a watchmaker, sank 7.3 percent to 459 yen
after predicting a 10 percent drop in operating profit.  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) , the world’s No. 1 carmaker, gained 3.1
percent to 3,370 yen, the biggest support to Nikkei 225 and the
most active stock by value in Japan, after public broadcaster
NHK said the company will resume normal production in  Asia 
outside Japan. Also, Toyota yesterday said its China factories
will resume normal production in mid-June, ahead of its original
schedule for as early as November. Automakers were the largest
support in the Topix.  To contact the reporter on this story:
