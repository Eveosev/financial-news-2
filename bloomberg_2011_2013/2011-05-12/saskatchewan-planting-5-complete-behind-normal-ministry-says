Saskatchewan planted 5 percent of
crops as of May 9, behind the five-year average of 14 percent,
the provincial government said today in a  report  on its website.  In southwestern regions, 13 percent of crops had been
planted, while west-central areas finished 5 percent, the
Saskatchewan Ministry of Agriculture said. East-central and
northern regions completed 1 percent.  “The majority of Saskatchewan producers got a late start
to field work due to excess moisture,” and rain last week will
delay seeding further, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
