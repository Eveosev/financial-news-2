Medicare, the U.S. health insurance
program for the elderly and disabled, said the health-care law
will save the program $120 billion in the next five years
through lower payments to hospitals and insurers.  About $50 billion of the savings come from reduced payments
to insurers including  Humana Inc. (HUM) ,  WellPoint Inc. (WLP)  and
 UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH) , companies that lead the market in
enrollees in Medicare Advantage, the privately run, government-
subsidized portion of the U.S. health program.  The savings prove the health-care overhaul that Democrats
passed last year is working, Medicare Deputy Administrator
Jonathan Blum said.  “Savings are happening,” he said by phone. “The program
is becoming more efficient. We are promoting payment reforms
that are elevating quality, elevating performance and lowering
costs.”  Cutting spending in Medicare was a major priority of the
health-care overhaul U.S. President  Barack Obama  signed into law
in March 2010. The law is projected by the Congressional Budget
Office to reduce U.S. deficits by $143 billion, partly through
almost $500 billion in cuts and savings from the Medicare
program in a decade.  Other major savings in the law come from cutting payments
to hospitals and providers of medical equipment like oxygen and
wheelchairs.  Blum said the savings were in line with  expectations  by the
Obama administration. “We’re very much consistent with where we
thought we would be,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
