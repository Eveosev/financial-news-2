Malaysia ’s ringgit fell the most in
two months on concern declines in commodity and stock prices
will curb demand for riskier emerging-market assets.  The currency traded at a three-week low after the Standard
& Poor’s GSCI Index of 24 raw materials dropped 3.9 percent
yesterday and the MSCI Asia-Pacific Index of stocks slid 1.6
percent, halting a three-day advance. Data released yesterday
showed growth in Malaysia’s industrial production slowed in
March, trailing economists’ forecasts in a Bloomberg News
survey.  Government bonds  fell after demand waned at an auction.  “The swings in commodity prices are making people cautious
about taking on too much risk,” said Wan Suhaimi Saidi, an
economist at Kenanga Investment Bank Bhd. in  Kuala Lumpur .
“There’s a risk that policy tightening will become a drag to
economic growth.”  The ringgit dropped 0.95 percent to 3.0078 per dollar as of
4:32 p.m. in Kuala Lumpur, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Traders expect the currency will fall 0.3 percent to
3.0157 in the next three months, according to non-deliverable
forwards contracts.  Higher commodity prices are forcing Asian central banks
from  India  to  China  to raise borrowing costs, stoking
speculation policy tightening will derail growth. Malaysia has
lifted fuel and sugar prices in the past 18 months to trim its
subsidies, helping push inflation to its highest level in two
years.  Consumer prices rose 3 percent in March from a year
earlier, the most since April 2009, a “manageable” level,
Governor Zeti Akhtar Aziz said in Luxembourg yesterday. Prices
will face upward pressures in the second half,  Bank Negara  said
on May 5.  Benchmark 2017 bonds declined after investor demand at the
sale of the securities waned, pushing yields to the highest this
month.  The yield on the 4.012 percent bond due September 2017
three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 3.76 percent
yesterday, according to Bursa Malaysia. The price dropped 0.15,
or 1.5 ringgit per 1,000 ringgit face amount, to 101.4.  The treasury sold an additional 3.5 billion ringgit ($1.2
billion) of the same securities today at an average yield of
3.747 percent. The bid cover ratio was 1.64 times, compared with
2.69 times at the sale of the same notes in October, according
to Bloomberg data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
