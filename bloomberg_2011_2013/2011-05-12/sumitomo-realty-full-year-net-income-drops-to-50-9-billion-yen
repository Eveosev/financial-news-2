Sumitomo Realty & Development Co.,
 Japan ’s third-biggest developer, said full-year net income
declined 3.3 percent, missing its own forecast as vacancy rates
climbed to the highest in at least six years.  Net income fell to 50.9 billion yen ($627 million) in the
12 months ended March 31 from 52.7 billion yen a year earlier,
the company said in a statement through the Tokyo Stock Exchange
today. The company had predicted 53 billion yen of profit for
the past year. Sales gained 3.5 percent to 744.8 billion yen
from 719.6 billion yen.  Leasing profit, which accounts for more than half of the
total, fell last year after the developer’s vacancy rate rose to
the highest since at least 2005. Sumitomo Realty forecast a 2.2
percent gain in its net income for the current business year,
defying lower profit expectations after the nation’s record
earthquake on March 11 from rivals Mitsui Fudosan Co. and
Mitsubishi Estate Co., Japan’s two largest developers.  Tokyo-based Sumitomo Realty forecast net income for the
year ending March 31, 2012, to reach 52 billion yen on sales of
710 trillion yen.  Sumitomo Realty’s shares declined 2.6 percent to 1,697 yen
at the 3 p.m. close of trading on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the
biggest retreat since April 15. They dropped 15 percent since
the March 11 temblor.  The vacancy rate of Sumitomo Realty’s building portfolio
peaked at 9 percent in the second quarter, the highest in at
least six years, and stood at 8.2 percent as of March 31.  The developer sold a total of 4,841 apartments, houses and
residential land, 15 percent more than last year, the company
said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
