European stocks slumped, following a
decline in U.S. and Asian equities, as commodities extended
yesterday’s rout and Cisco Systems Inc. forecast earnings that
missed analysts’ estimates. U.S. index futures slid.  BHP Billiton Ltd. lost 2.3 percent after copper slumped to
a five-month low and crude sank more than 5 percent in  New York 
yesterday. Alcatel-Lucent SA declined 1.8 percent after Cisco,
the largest maker of networking gear, abandoned a four-year-old
forecast.  The benchmark Stoxx Europe 600 Index dropped 0.9 percent to
281.1 at 8:03 a.m. in  London . The gauge yesterday rose for a
second day after results from A.P. Moeller-Maersk A/S to Hermes
International SCA topped estimates. Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
futures slid 0.4 percent to 1,333.1.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
