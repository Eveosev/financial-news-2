The  Houston Astros  may be sold as
early as next week to a group headed by Jim Crane,  the Houston
Chronicle reported , citing two unidentified people familiar with
the negotiations.  The transfer of the Major League Baseball team, its share
of a new regional sports network and the $1.7 million semi-
annual lease payment on Minute Maid Park may be made to Crane’s
group of eight to 10 people as early as July, the report said.  Drayton McLane is said to be asking $680 million for the
team (14-23), which defeated the Cincinnati Reds 4-3 last night,
the Chronicle said. That’s about $87 million more than the  Texas
Rangers  were sold for last year, the newspaper reported. McLane
didn’t respond to an e-mail seeking comment.  Crane, the founder of Crane Worldwide Logistics and chief
executive officer of Crane Capital, failed with an attempt to
buy the Astros in 2008. He then missed out on the  Chicago Cubs 
in 2009 before he and Dallas Mavericks owner  Mark Cuban  were
outbid for the Rangers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
