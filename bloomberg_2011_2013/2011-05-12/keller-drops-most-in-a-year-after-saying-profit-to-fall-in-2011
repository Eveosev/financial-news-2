Keller Group Plc (KLR) , the builder of the
foundations for the main stadium of  London â€™s 2012 Olympic Games,
fell the most in a year in London trading after saying it
expects earnings this year to fall around 10 percent.  The shares slumped 143 pence, or 22 percent, to 518 pence
at 8:14 a.m., cutting 92 million pounds ($150 million) from its
market value. The stock, which declined to its lowest since Dec.
3, was the worst performer among the 622 companies in the  FTSE
All-Share Index. (ASX)   Earnings before interest and tax will fall because of
lower margins in its U.S. business, the effect of the floods in
Australia and geopolitical issues in the Middle East and North
Africa, the London-based company said in a statement today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
