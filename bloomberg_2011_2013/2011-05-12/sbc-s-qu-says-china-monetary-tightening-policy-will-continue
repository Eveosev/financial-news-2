Qu Hongbin, chief  China  economist for
HSBC Holdings Plc, comments on the People’s Bank of China’s
decision to raise the reserve requirement for the nation’s
lenders by 0.5 percentage points from May 18.  “Raising the reserve ratio is in line with expectations.
The economic figures released yesterday showed that inflation
remains high, and that new additional loans were also higher
than expected. These all suggested that China’s tightening
policy will continue.”  --Helen Yuan. Editor:  John Liu   To contact Bloomberg News staff on this story:
