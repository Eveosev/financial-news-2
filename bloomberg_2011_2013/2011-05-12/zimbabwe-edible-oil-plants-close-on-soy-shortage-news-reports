National Foods Holdings Ltd. and
Olivine Industries (Private) Ltd. halted operations at their
edible-oil crushing plants because of a shortage of soy beans,
the  Daily News  reported, citing National Foods’ Managing
Director Jeremy Brooke and Jonas Mushangari, Olivine’s managing
director.  The southern African nation, which can crush 350,000 metric
tons of soy beans for oil production annually, has been
importing soy from India and Malawi, the Harare-based Daily News
said on its website.  Calls to National Foods’ Harare headquarters weren’t
answered when Bloomberg News sought comment today. Switchboards
at Olivine Industries weren’t answered either.  National Foods, Zimbabwe’s biggest grain miller, is
controlled by Harare-listed  Innscor Africa Ltd. (INAF)  and  South
Africa ’s  Tiger Brands Ltd. (TBS)   To contact the reporter on this story:
