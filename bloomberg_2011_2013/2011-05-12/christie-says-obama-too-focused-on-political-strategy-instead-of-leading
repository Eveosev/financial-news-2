New Jersey  Governor  Chris Christie 
said President  Barack Obama  is “too focused on political
strategy” and “needs to lead.”  “I am not enamored with having a master political
strategist in the White House,” Christie, a first-term
Republican, said in a speech to the  Committee of 100 , a New
York-based group that represents prominent Chinese-Americans.
“I would rather have a leader.”  Obama needs to focus less on his “current domestic
priorities,” which include high-speed rail, and more on
reducing the cost of entitlements including Social Security,
Christie said.  “If he does not lead on reforming entitlements, we are
condemning our children to be the first generation of Americans
who will not have as good a lifestyle as their parents,” the
governor said.  Christie, 48, has become a rising national star in the
 Republican Party  after he cut $10 billion in state spending on
schools, pensions and local aid in his first budget. He has said
repeatedly that he has no plans to run for president in 2012,
even as the New York Post reported that his supporters in Iowa
plan to meet with him this month to persuade him to seek the
nomination.  The governor told the gathering today at the Waldorf-
Astoria hotel that increasing taxes to balance New Jersey’s
budget is “out of the picture.”  He also said he wants New Jersey to raise the Bayonne
Bridge to accommodate new and larger ships, so that more
international trade is sent through ports in the state.  To contact the reporter on this story:
