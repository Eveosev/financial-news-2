Jet fuel stockpiles in independent
storage in  Europe ’s Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp oil-trading hub
plummeted to the lowest level in more than two years on falling
prices, according to PJK International BV.  Jet fuel inventories plunged 19 percent to 528,000 metric
tons in the week to today, according to PJK, a researcher based
in the Netherlands. That’s the lowest since October 2008 even as
the fuel arrived from  Qatar  and the  United Arab Emirates .  “Airlines are profiting now from lower prices ahead of
increasing demand during the summer holidays” and pulling
product from storage, Pieter Kulsen, founder of PJK, said in a
telephone interview from Oosterhout. “The airlines were hit by
higher prices during the first quarter.”  Wholesale jet fuel prices for immediate loading in Europe’s
ARA-area fell to $1,023 a ton yesterday from $1,134 on April 8,
the highest since August 2008, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Gasoil inventories decreased 3.2 percent to 2.88 million
tons as cargoes were exported to  France , Gibraltar and the Suez
area, according to PJK. The fuel, which includes heating oil and
diesel, arrived from Denmark, Norway and  Russia .  Fuel oil dropped 15 percent to 682,000 tons, the lowest
since April 21, on exports to  Singapore , according to the data.
Cargoes arrived from France, Lithuania, Russia and the U.K.  Gasoline stockpiles declined 6.2 percent to 710,000 tons on
cargo shipments to  Mexico , the U.K., the U.S. and West Africa,
PJK data show. The motor fuel arrived from Finland, France,
Russia and the U.K.  Naphtha, used in gasoline and petrochemicals production,
gained 23 percent to 60,000 tons on supplies from Russia, the
data shows. That’s the highest level since March 31.  The following table shows the weekly inventory changes in
