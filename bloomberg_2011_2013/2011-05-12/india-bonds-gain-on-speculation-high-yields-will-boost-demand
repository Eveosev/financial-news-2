India ’s government bonds advanced on
speculation yields at the highest levels in 31 months will
attract buyers.  Yields touched 8.30 percent in intraday trading yesterday,
the highest level for a 10-year note since October 2008, on
speculation domestic gasoline prices will be increased to keep
pace with gains in global  oil prices , fanning inflation. The
prices haven’t been increased since January. Crude has risen 8.9
percent this year.  “Bond prices have fallen steeply and these are probably
good levels to buy if you are going to hold it for long,” said
A.Y. Shedshale, a Mumbai-based deputy general manager in charge
of fixed-income at Bank of Maharashtra.  The yield on the 7.8 percent note due April 2021 declined
three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 8.26 percent as
of 9:52 a.m. in Mumbai, according to the central bank’s trading
system.  To contact the reporter on this story:
