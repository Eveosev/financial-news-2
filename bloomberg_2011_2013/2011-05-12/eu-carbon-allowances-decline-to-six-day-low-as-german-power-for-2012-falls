European Union emission allowances
declined to their lowest level in six days as German power for
2012 dropped, cutting the incentive for utilities to hedge
forward electricity sales.  EU carbon permits for December fell as much as 0.8 percent
to 16.71 euros ($23.71) a metric ton on  London ’s ICE Futures
Europe exchange and were at 16.76 euros as of 8:14 a.m. Carbon
permits for December 2013 dropped as much as 0.5 percent to
18.88 euros a ton, the lowest price since April 19.  The European Commission in Brussels, which regulates the
market, plans to start selling 2013 permits next year. In the
meantime, utilities must use permits through 2012 for hedging
purposes. Some generators start selling power three years ahead
of production. The carbon program is the world’s biggest
greenhouse-gas market by traded volume.  German power for 2012 fell as much as 0.6 percent to 58.30
euros a megawatt-hour and was at 58.60 euros as of 9:18 a.m. in
Berlin, according to broker data compiled by Bloomberg.
Northwest Europe coal for next year fell 1 percent yesterday to
$127.75 a ton, as benchmark  Brent crude  dropped 4.3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
