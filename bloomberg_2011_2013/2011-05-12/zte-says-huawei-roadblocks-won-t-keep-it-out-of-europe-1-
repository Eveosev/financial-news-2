ZTE Corp. (763) ,  China ’s second-largest
maker of phone network equipment, said “roadblocks” from rival
Huawei Technologies Co. won’t keep it out of  Europe  after Huawei
won a preliminary injunction for alleged trademark infringement.  The May 2 injunction from a German court is only a
“temporary relief” and doesn’t constitute a ruling on whether
ZTE actually infringed, ZTE said in an e-mailed statement today.
The court prohibited ZTE from using a mark on USB modem sticks
or selling USB sticks that have a certain legally protected
design, according to a copy of the judgment obtained by
Bloomberg News.  ZTE and Huawei, both based in Shenzhen, China, are looking
to expand sales in Europe. Huawei last month filed lawsuits in
Germany, France and  Hungary  accusing ZTE of patent and trademark
infringements related to data-card and high-speed mobile
Internet technology.  ZTE said April 29 it filed its own lawsuit in China
claiming Huawei infringed on patents for fourth-generation
mobile network technology.  Huawei is “committed to the protection of its own
innovations,” Ross Gan, a spokesman, said today. “We welcome
the court’s decision to issue an injunction in favor of Huawei
that prevents ZTE from continuing to infringe our trademark and
patent rights.”  --Edmond Lococo. Editors: Michael Tighe, Nicholas Wadhams  To contact Bloomberg News staff on this story:
