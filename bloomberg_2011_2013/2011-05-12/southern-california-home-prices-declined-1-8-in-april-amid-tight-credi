Southern California home prices fell
1.8 percent in April from a year earlier as distressed
properties accounted for half of purchases and mortgages were
hard to get, according to  DataQuick Information Systems Inc .  The median price of a home sold in six area counties was
$280,000, down from $285,000 in April 2010, the San Diego-based
data seller said today in a statement. Sales dropped 9.2
percent, the 10th consecutive year-over-year decline.  “Too many people still aren’t in the mood or in a position
to buy,” John Walsh, DataQuick’s president, said in the
statement. “They might be concerned about prices falling more,
or can’t qualify for a loan. They might owe more on their homes
than they’re worth and can’t move up.”  Prices fell 0.2 percent from March while sales slumped 5.5
percent to a total of 18,344, the company said.  The report covers Los Angeles, Riverside,  San Diego ,
Ventura, San Bernardino and Orange counties.  To contact the reporter on this story:
