Jared Lee Loughner, accused of
killing six people and wounding 13 outside a supermarket in
Tucson,  Arizona , sent two letters directly to the judge in his
case regarding his lawyers.  U.S. District Judge Larry Burns said in an order filed
today in federal court in Tucson that he received two letters
from the defendant. The judge said he will give Loughner’s
lawyers copies of the letters. He said prosecutors won’t be
given copies because “the subject matter pertains to the
attorney-client relationship.”  The judge’s filing didn’t include further information about
what Loughner wrote.  Loughner has pleaded not guilty to charges he killed a
federal judge and five other people at U.S. Representative
 Gabrielle Giffords ’s Jan. 8 community meeting. Burns has
scheduled a hearing on May 25 to determine whether Loughner, who
was 22 at the time of the shooting, is competent to stand trial.  Judy Clarke , Loughner’s lead lawyer, didn’t immediately
return a call seeking comment after regular business hours.
Robbie Sherwood, a spokesman for U.S. Attorney Dennis Burke in
Phoenix, declined to comment.  The case is U.S. v. Loughner, 11-00187, U.S. District
Court, District of Arizona (Tucson).  To contact the reporter on this story:
