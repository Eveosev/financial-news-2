Japanese and Australian stock futures
gained after commodity prices rebounded, easing concerns that
global economic growth may slow.  American depositary receipts of  Mitsubishi Corp. (8058) , Japan’s
biggest commodities trader, rose 0.5 percent from the closing
share price in Tokyo. ADRs of  Woodside Petroleum Ltd. (WPL) ,
Australia’s No. 2 oil producer, climbed 1.1 percent. Those of
 Toyota Motor Corp. (7203)  gained 0.5 percent after the Asahi newspaper
reported production at the world’s largest automaker, cut by the
March 11 earthquake, will return to normal by September.  “Increases in the commodity market eased excessive
concerns,” said Juichi Wako, a senior strategist at Tokyo-based
Nomura Holdings Inc. “Confidence about company earnings will
likely support stocks.”  Futures on Japan’s  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average expiring in
June closed at 9,770 in Chicago yesterday, compared with 9,700
in Osaka, Japan. The futures were bid in the pre-market at 9,740
in  Osaka , at 8:05 a.m. local time. Futures on Australia’s
S&P/ASX 200 Index rose 0.6 percent today. New Zealand’s NZX 50
Index was gained 0.1 percent in Wellington.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index were little
changed today. In  New York , the index advanced 0.5 percent to
1,348.65 yesterday as the dollar fell and commodities rebounded
from an earlier slump caused by China raising reserve ratios for
its largest lenders by 0.5 percentage point to a record 21
percent, to curb lending.  Oil, Metals  Crude oil for June delivery increased 0.8 percent to settle
at $98.97 a barrel yesterday in New York. Copper rebounded from
a five-month low and the London Metal Exchange Index of six
metals rose 0.2 percent. Gold futures gained 0.4 percent in New
York.  The dollar fell versus the euro, after earlier reaching a
six-week high against the shared currency. The dollar also
depreciated to as low as 80.71 yen at midnight in  Tokyo ,
compared with 81.09 at the close of  stock trading  yesterday. A
weaker dollar cuts the value of U.S. income at Japanese
companies when converted into their home currency.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index lost 1 percent this year
through yesterday, compared with gains of 7.2 percent by the  S&P
500  and 2.2 percent by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. Stocks in the
Asian benchmark are valued at 13.4 times estimated earnings on
average, compared with 13.6 times for the S&P 500 and 11.3 times
for the Stoxx 600.  Today, 83 of the 1,022 companies in the MSCI index are
scheduled to release earnings statements. Of the 555 companies
in the MSCI index that have reported results for the latest
quarter, 213 have exceeded analysts’ estimates, while 219 have
missed them, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporters on this story:
