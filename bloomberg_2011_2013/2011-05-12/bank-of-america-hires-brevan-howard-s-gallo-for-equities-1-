Bank of America Corp. (BAC)  hired Fabrizio Gallo from hedge fund Brevan Howard Asset Management LLP to be
co-head of global equities and European global markets.  He will join the bank later in the year and report to Tom Montag, president of global banking and markets, the lender said
in a statement today. Gallo joined Brevan Howard in 2009 after
15 years at Morgan Stanley, where had served as head of equities
and global proprietary trading, Bank of America said.  Gallo ran the $569 million Brevan Howard Equity Strategies
Fund, part of the $33 billion total the hedge fund firm manages.
The pool had been reducing its market risk this year amid unrest
in the Middle East, Brevan Howard said in March. CNBC reported
today the firm is shutting down the equities fund. A spokesman
for Brevan Howard had no immediate comment today.  Bank of America has been hiring from UBS AG, Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Citigroup Inc.
in Europe and Asia to expand its investment banking operations
following its purchase of Merrill Lynch & Co.  The firm said this month it hired Goldman Sachs’s Ryan Holsheimer as head of Asia Pacific equity execution services in
 Hong Kong . Matthew Koder is also due to join Bank of America
this summer as head of corporate and investment banking for the
Asia-Pacific region after leaving UBS.  To contact the reporter on this story:
