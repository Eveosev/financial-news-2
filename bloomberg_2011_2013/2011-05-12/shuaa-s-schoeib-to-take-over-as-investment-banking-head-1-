Shuaa Capital PSC (SHUAA) , the United Arab
Emirates bank controlled by Dubai’s ruler, named Karim Schoeib
as head of  investment banking  to replace Makram Kubeisy.  Kubeisy, at the bank for about 10 years, has left, Shuaa
said an e-mailed statement today. Bloomberg News wasn’t
immediately able to reach Kubeisy on his mobile phone. Schoeib
was Kubeisy’s deputy.  The investment bank said yesterday it will eliminate 39
jobs, or 10 percent of its workforce, as the company reported
its second consecutive quarterly loss. Shuaa expects an
annualized cost saving of more than 30 million dirhams ($8.2
million) from “a systematic right-sizing program,” the company
said.  Shuaa’s investment banking division in February posted a
loss for 2010. The unit was hurt by a prolonged decline in the
U.A.E. equity markets, where no initial public offering occurred
between July 2008 and February this year.  Shuaa was one of four banks that managed the initial public
offering of  DP World Ltd. (DPW) , the world’s fourth largest port
operator. The sale in November 2007 was the biggest in the
Middle East and raised $4.96 billion.  -With Assistance from Zahra Hankir in Dubai.  To contact the reporters on this story:
