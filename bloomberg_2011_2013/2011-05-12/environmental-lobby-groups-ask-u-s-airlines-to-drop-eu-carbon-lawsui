Six environmental lobby groups
including the Environmental Defense Fund and the  Natural
Resources Defense Council  asked U.S. airlines to drop a lawsuit
seeking to invalidate a European Union greenhouse-gas law.  “If in fact American Airlines is committed to reducing its
environmental impact, it makes no sense to spend your customers’
money on lawyers and lobbyists in an effort to thwart a crucial
anti-pollution program,” the lobbies  said in a letter  to AMR
Corp., the airline’s owner.  The groups are also writing to  United Continental Holdings
Inc. (UAL) , according to the  council’s website .  The EU’s emissions cap-and-trade system, the world’s
largest, will expand next year to cover flights to and from the
EU’s airports. The European legislation offers an option to
exclude incoming flights from a non-EU country if the nation
implements “equivalent” measures to cut pollution from
aviation, said EU climate spokesman Isaac Valero-Ladron.  To contact the reporters on this story:
