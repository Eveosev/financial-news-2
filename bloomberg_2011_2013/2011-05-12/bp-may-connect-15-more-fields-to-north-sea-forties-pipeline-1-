BP Plc (BP/)  is in discussions to connect
15 more fields to its Forties Pipeline System in the  North Sea ,
Peter Mather, BPâ€™s head of country for the U.K., said at a
conference in London today.  Forties is one of four North Sea crude grades that
determine the price of Dated Brent, the benchmark for more than
half of world oil.  Production of the Forties blend, may increase to an average
543,000 barrels a day in July from 533,000 barrels a day in
June, according to a May 4 report on the website of London-based
BP, which operates the pipeline system. Production may fall to
413,000 barrels a day in August, BP said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
