(Corrects to say mercenaries backed Gbagbo in third
paragraph.)  Hospitals and clinics in  Ivory
Coast ’s commercial capital, Abidjan, are “overwhelmed” with
patients, many of them with fresh gunshot wounds, aid group
Medecins Sans Frontieres said.  A clinic in the north of the city is receiving as many as
10 people a day with gunshot injuries, while a hospital in the
west admitted 125 people with gunshot or shrapnel wounds in the
past three weeks, MSF said in an e-mailed statement yesterday.
The country lacks the medical supplies to cope, said MSF, which
provides free emergency health care at several clinics across
the west African nation.  Ivory Coast  is emerging from a civil war that ended with
the capture of former President  Laurent Gbagbo  on April 11.
Sporadic fighting has continued since then between Gbagbo’s
supporters and the forces of President-elect  Alassane Ouattara ,
or among troops that backed the new government. At least 174
people have been killed in the west by militias and Liberian
mercenaries that had backed Gbagbo as they retreated to
neighboring Liberia, the Ivorian Defense Ministry said May 10.  “In the west of the country, the situation remains
extremely tense as many villages remain empty and people
continue to hide in the bush,” MSF said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
