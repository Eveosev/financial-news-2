The worst drought affecting  China ’s
Hubei province in 10 years may persist, slowing the planting of
mid-season rice and other crops, the official Xinhua News
reported, citing the region’s water resources department.  High temperatures and dryness forecast to affect the
central province in the next 10 days may erode soil moisture and
worsen a drought that began in October, Xinhua said. The
provincial drought management office has joined some
municipalities in raising alerts to better deploy relief
efforts, Xinhua said.  Dryness had parched 10.9 million mu (726,667 hectares) of
crops, while 274,000 people and 83,100 large livestock animals
face a shortage of drinking water as of yesterday, Xinhua said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
