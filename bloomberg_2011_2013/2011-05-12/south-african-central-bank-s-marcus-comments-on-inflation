South African Reserve Bank Governor
Gill Marcus made the following comments on inflation after a
meeting of the bank’s monetary policy committee in  Pretoria 
today.  “The risk to inflation has deteriorated further, mainly as
a result of external cost-push factors.  “Inflation is now expected to reach the upper limit of the
inflation target range in the final quarter of 2011.  “Inflation is expected to average 5.1 percent in 2011 and
6 percent in 2012.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
