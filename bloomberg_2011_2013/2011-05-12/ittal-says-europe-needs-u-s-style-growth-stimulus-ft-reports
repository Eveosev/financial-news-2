ArcelorMittal (MT)  Chief Executive Officer
 Lakshmi Mittal  said European governments should emulate the U.S.
government in its approach to boosting the economy, which is
aimed at stimulating growth rather than combating inflation, the
Financial Times reported, citing an interview.  Mittal is “concerned” about economic weakness in  Europe 
and about the impact of the strong euro, the FT also reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
