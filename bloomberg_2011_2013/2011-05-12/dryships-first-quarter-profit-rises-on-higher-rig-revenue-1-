DryShips Inc. (DRYS) , a Greek owner of deep-
water drilling rigs and vessels that haul iron ore and coal,
reported that first-quarter profit rose as revenue from oil rigs
increased.  Net income increased to $25.8 million, or 7 cents a share,
from $13.3 million, or 4 cents, a year earlier, the Athens-based
company said today in a statement. Revenue rose 6.8 percent to
$207.4 million from $194.2 million.  Excluding items such as interest-rate swaps, adjusted net
income was $56.1 million, or 15 cents a share, down from $67.6
million, or 27 cents, a year earlier. On that basis, the
estimate of 12 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was 17 cents.  DryShips diversified its revenue sources by entering the
offshore oil drilling rigs market. Revenue from shipping was $97
million, down from $113.9 million a year earlier. Revenue from
drilling contracts advanced to $109.3 million from $80.3
million.  DryShips gained 4 cents, or 0.9 percent, to $4.68 in Nasdaq
Stock Market composite trading. The shares have fallen 15
percent this year. The earnings were released after the close of
regular trading.  “The  spot market  is down but we are not too worried about
DryShips, since the rig market is looking better than a year
ago,” said Wilhelm Gedde-Dahl, an analyst at Pareto Securities
ASA in Oslo.  The Baltic Dry Index, a measure of spot shipping rates in
the dry-bulk market, dropped 55 percent in the quarter from the
same period a year earlier, according to London-based Baltic
Exchange, averaging 1,365 from the previous 3,027.  DryShips operated an average of 36.8 vessels in the quarter
that earned an average rate of $27,700 a day. A year earlier the
fleet averaged 37.6 ships earning $32,250 a day.  (DryShips will hold a conference call to discuss results
tomorrow at 8 a.m. New York time. To access the conference, call
