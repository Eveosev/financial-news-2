Grupo Aval Acciones y Valores (AVAL)  SA,
Colombia’s biggest financial holding company, seeks to list
shares this year in New York and  Mexico , said Chairman Luis Carlos Sarmiento Angulo.  Sarmiento spoke in an interview today in Bogota at an event
marking the first day of trading on Colombia’s exchange for
Aval’s preferred shares worth $1.1 billion. The issuance, which
was more than 50 percent oversubscribed, was the biggest in
Colombian history by a private company, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
