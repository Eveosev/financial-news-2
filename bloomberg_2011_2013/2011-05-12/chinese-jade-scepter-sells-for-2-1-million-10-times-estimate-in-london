A yellow jade scepter associated with
the court of the Qianlong emperor sold today for 1.3 million
pounds ($2.1 million) as Asian buyers chose the most desirable
items in a week of auctions of Chinese artworks in  London .  The 14-inch-long “ruyi,” acquired by a British military
attache in Beijing during the Boxer Rebellion of 1900, sold at
Bonhams for 10 times its 120,000-pound upper estimate with fees.
It was bought by a telephone bidder.  Recent multiple-estimate auction prices for Imperial pieces
have helped turn the trade in Chinese antiques into a business
worth more than $10 billion. The week’s U.K. sales have already
raised 41.1 million pounds. Salesrooms were packed with a
visiting contingent of more than 100 Chinese dealers and agents,
though some high-value pieces failed.  “Chinese bidders have calmed down,”  John Berwald , a
London-based dealer, said in an interview. “As they’ve become
more knowledgeable, they’ve become more selective. And they know
there will always be another auction. Sometimes a high estimate
was paired with condition issues.”  Christie’s International and  Sotheby’s (BID)  both achieved record
totals for auctions of Chinese antiques at their London
salesrooms that were about double presale low estimates.  Vase Repair  Their failures included a pair of 18th-century blue and
white Imperial vases valued at as much as 800,000 pounds, which
failed to sell at Christie’s, and a Song-dynasty crackle-glazed
vase estimated at 3 million pounds, which went unsold at
Sotheby’s. Buyers were put off by high estimates and a repair to
the neck of the vase, dealers said.  The yellow color of the Bonhams’s perfectly preserved jade
scepter was highly prized by Chinese bidders, as was the
object’s resemblance to another example in the Palace Museum,
Beijing, said dealers. Bonhams estimated that it would raise at
least 7 million pounds from today’s 550-lot auction.  Bonhams also sold a pair of Imperial teapots for 1.3
million pounds, surpassing an estimate of 20,000 pounds to
30,000 pounds. Their phone buyer beat at least four Asian
bidders in the room.  The melon-shaped porcelain teapots of the Qinglong dynasty
were rediscovered recently in a Scottish collection where they
had been for 50 years, Bonhams said.  “If you accept them, they are the rarest of the rarest
high Imperial taste,” Roger Keverne, a London-based dealer,
said in an interview.  Brush Washer  Christie’s raised a total of 20.3 million pounds in its May
10 sale. Seventy-six percent of the 329 lots were successful.  The top price was the 1.7 million pounds paid by a Chinese
dealer in the room for a Qianlong-dynasty jade “double-gourd”
brush washer valued at just 100,000 pounds to 150,000 pounds. It
was offered by a Scottish family that acquired it in the 1960s.  Sotheby’s raised 20.8 million pounds from 339 lots, 28
percent of which were left unsold. All 10 of the most expensive
lots fell to Asian bidders, led by the 2.2 million pounds given
for a multicolored “doucai” porcelain altar set, valued at
800,000 pounds to 1.2 million pounds.  “At every sale there are more and more new Chinese
faces,” Berwald said. “It’s making it impossible for Western
dealers to buy Imperial pieces. We just have to concentrate on
other things.”  Sales of antiques in  China  were alone valued at 6 billion
euros ($8.3 billion) in 2010 and grew 160 percent year-on-year,
according to a European Fine Art Foundation report published in
March.  (Scott Reyburn writes about the art market for Muse, the
