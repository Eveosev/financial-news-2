Hyundai Motor Co. (005380) ,  India ’s second
biggest automaker, may build a network of as many as 1,000 rural
outlets and introduce a cheaper small car after losing market
share to  Ford Motor Co. (F)  and Volkswagen AG.  “We are looking strongly at these markets and want to
focus on growing our network there,” Arvind Saxena, the
carmaker’s India director for sales and marketing, said in an
interview yesterday in  New Delhi . He declined to give a
timeframe for the showroom plan.  Hyundai intends to expand in rural regions that generally
have few dealerships as economic growth spreads wealth beyond
urban areas in the world’s second-most populous nation. The
Seoul-based carmaker’s Indian sales grew at about half the pace
of the overall market last fiscal year as Ford, Volkswagen and
Toyota Motor Corp. added models and opened showrooms in cities.  “Urban markets will be more and more difficult to grow so
most automobile manufacturers will have to focus on rural
markets,” said Darius Lam, a Bangkok-based analyst with J.D.
Power Asia Pacific. “It will be challenging, but significant
for the company.”  To help boost rural sales, Hyundai will also add a car
costing less than the 293,902 rupees ($6,576) Santro, its
cheapest model in India, Saxena said. The new model may compete
against  Maruti Suzuki India Ltd. (MSIL) ’s Alto compact, the nation’s
bestselling car, he said. He declined to say when it will go on
sale.  New Models  Hyundai intends to add two new models a year in India,
Saxena said. It yesterday introduced a new version of its Verna
sedan, which costs from 699,000 rupees to 1.07 million rupees.
It has no plans to build a model that will compete with Tata
Motors Ltd.’s $3,399 Nano, Saxena said.  The automaker expects to sell a total of 400,000 cars in
India in 2011, he said. It boosted sales 14 percent to 358,904
in the year ended March, according to the  Society of Indian
Automobile Manufacturers . That compares with a 30 percent jump
for the overall market and a 26 percent increase for Maruti,
maker of about half the cars sold in India. Hyundai’s market
share slipped to 18 percent from 21 percent a year earlier.  Hyundai will also invest 4 billion rupees to build a new
diesel-engine factory that will produce 150,000 units a year.
The factory near  Chennai  in southern India will make engines for
vehicles across the Hyundai range.  To contact the reporter on this story:
