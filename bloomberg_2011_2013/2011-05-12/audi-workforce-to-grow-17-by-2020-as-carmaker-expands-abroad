Volkswagen AG (VOW) ’s Audi luxury-car brand
will increase its workforce by 17 percent through 2020 as the
manufacturer expands production beyond  Germany  to meet growing
demand in markets such as  China  and the U.S.  “We’re expecting further growth over the long term beyond
2015,” Chief Executive Officer Rupert Stadler said a speech to
be delivered today at the annual shareholders meeting in
Neckarsulm, Germany. “That gives us confidence to further
expand our product portfolio and develop our
internationalization, possibly also with production capacity in
the U.S.”  Audi, which employs about 60,000 people worldwide, plans to
add 10,000 positions over the coming decade, the CEO said. The
VW unit expects China to keep growing “at a high pace” in the
medium term. It’s also targeting U.S. sales of 200,000 cars and
sport-utility vehicles starting in 2015 after deliveries in the
market exceeded 100,000 vehicles last year for the first time.  Audi, which has been gaining on market leaders BMW and
Mercedes-Benz, is targeting an increase in 2011 global sales of
more than 10 percent as the revamped A6 sedan and new Q3 compact
SUV attract customers. The Ingolstadt, Germany-based carmaker
aims to dethrone  Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW) , which will publish
first-quarter figures tomorrow, as the world’s top luxury-car
maker by 2015.  Audi sold 1.09 million cars and SUVs last year, a 15
percent increase.  Daimler AG (DAI) ’s Mercedes-Benz brand gained 15
percent to 1.17 million vehicles while deliveries at BMW’s
namesake brand increased 15 percent to 1.22 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
