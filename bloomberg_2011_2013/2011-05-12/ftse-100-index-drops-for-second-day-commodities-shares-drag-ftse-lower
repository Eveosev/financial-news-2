U.K. shares fell for a second day,
dragging the benchmark  FTSE 100 Index (UKX)  to the lowest level in a
week, after China restrained bank lending and European
industrial production weakened.  Rio Tinto  Group,  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) ,  Xstrata Plc (XTA)  and
Fresnillo Plc led basic-resource shares lower as commodities
prices declined.  3i Group Plc (III) , Britain’s biggest publicly traded
private equity firm, soared 6.7 percent after reporting a
bigger-than-estimated increase in the value of its investments  The FTSE 100 fell 31.04, or 0.5 percent, to 5,944.96 at the
4:30 p.m. close in London. The gauge has fallen 2.1 percent this
month as a retreat among raw-material producers overshadowed a
bigger-than-forecast increase in U.S. payrolls. The FTSE All-
Share Index also dropped 0.5 percent today, while Ireland’s ISEQ
Index lost 0.9 percent.  “Nerves over the global economic outlook have continued to
fray,” said Angus Campbell, the head of sales at Capital
Spreads in London. “Investors’ appetite for equities is being
severely tested.”  Almost one in three investors said they will put more money
in cash and 30 percent indicated they would cut commodity
holdings, according to a Bloomberg survey of 1,263 market
participants.  China  raised reserve requirements for its banks to a record
21 percent. The central bank moved after reports yesterday
showed inflation and lending exceeded economists’ estimates in
April, with consumer prices rising more than 5 percent for a
second month.  Industrial Production  Figures from the European Union today showed that
industrial production unexpectedly declined in March, led by a
drop in output of capital goods. Production in the 17-member
euro area slipped 0.2 percent from February, when it advanced
0.6 percent. Economists had forecast a gain of 0.3 percent.  Rio Tinto, the world’s second-largest mining company by
sales, lost 1.7 percent to 4,114.5 pence, while BHP Billiton,
the biggest, fell 1.8 percent to 2,363.5 pence. Xstrata dropped
2.2 percent to 1,378.5 pence. The S&P GSCI index of 24
commodities fell as much as 2.3 percent today.  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  slipped 1.5 percent to 2,172 pence,
while BP fell 1.1 percent to 443.3 pence. The International
Energy Agency trimmed its 2011 global oil demand forecast for
the first time as this year’s price rally begins to weigh on
consumption.  Tullow Oil Plc (TLW)  fell 1.2 percent to 1,332 pence after
reporting a delay in exploration results from the Zaedyus well
off French Guiana in an interim management statement.  3i Group advanced 6.7 percent to 289.9 pence after
reporting a bigger-than-estimated increase in the value of its
investments as emerging economies’ growth boosted the earnings
at the companies it owns.  Scottish & Southern Energy Plc (SSE)  rose 1.3 percent to 1,368
pence, climbing for a fourth day. Spanish newspaper Expansion
reported that Iberdrola SA is considering a takeover bid for
Scottish & Southern or a merger with Germany’s RWE AG.  To contact the reporters on this story:
