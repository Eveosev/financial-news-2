INA Industrija Nafte d.d.,  Croatia ’s
largest refiner, will expand energy projects in Syria by seeking
offshore exploration rights in the Arab country, according to a
Syrian Arab National Agency report.  Zoltan Aldott, head of management board at the Zagreb-based
company, “discussed cooperation in the field of exploration in
the Syrian sea waters” with Syrian Prime Minister Adel Safar in
Damascus yesterday, SANA said. During the talks, Aldott said INA
will expand onshore exploration in Syria, it said.  INA, which is controlled by Hungary’s Mol Nyrt, will invest
$69.5 million this year in the Hayan plant to increase output of
natural gas and liquid petroleum gas which is expected to reach
its peak of 24,500 barrels a day in 2012 to 2013, according to a
March 2 company statement. It will also invest $15.5 million in
exploration in its other Syrian plant, Aphamia.  Syria , struggling to halt a decline in crude oil output,
called on companies to submit bids to explore offshore blocks by
Oct. 5 of this year and asked them to improve bids to explore
eight onshore blocks.  To contact the reporters on this story:
