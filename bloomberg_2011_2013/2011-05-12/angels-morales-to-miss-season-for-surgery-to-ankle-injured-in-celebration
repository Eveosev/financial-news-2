Los Angeles Angels first baseman
Kendrys Morales will miss the Major League Baseball season to
have a second operation on the left ankle he broke celebrating
his game-winning grand slam a year ago.  Morales, 27, will have the surgery at an undetermined date
to remove scar tissue and debris in the ankle, team doctor Lewis Yocum said today on the Angels’ website. The goal of the surgery
is to have Morales healthy for the start of next season, Yocum
said.  Morales hasn’t played since injuring the ankle on May 29
against the  Seattle Mariners . He broke his ankle while being
mobbed by teammates as he jumped on home plate.  Morales led the Angels with 34 home runs and 108 runs
batted in and finished fifth in voting for the American League
Most Valuable Player in 2009. In five seasons he has a .284
batting average with 57 home runs and 192 RBI.  To contact the reporter on this story:
