Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE) ’s Chief Executive
Officer Rene Obermann said the group won’t make any large
acquisitions if it succeeds in the sale of T-Mobile USA, to  AT&T
Inc. (T)  for $39 billion, the Financial Times reported, citing an
interview.  There are no large acquisitions “on the agenda,” Obermann
said, adding that the company needs “to make some selected
smaller acquisitions over the next couple of years,” in mobile
Internet and cloud computing, the FT said. He doesn’t envisage
any expansion in developing countries beyond those in southern
and eastern  Europe , the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
