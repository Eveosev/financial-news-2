(Corrects with revised numbers to show fastest increase
since January in first paragraph.)  Brazil ’s retail sales rose 1.2
percent in March from February, the fastest increase since
January and second-fastest since August, the national statistics
agency said today.  Sales rose 4.1 percent in March from a year ago, the agency
said. Both numbers were below the median estimate of 26
economists surveyed by Bloomberg, who forecast March sales would
rise 1.3 percent from February and 4.3 percent from a year
earlier.  Economic growth has created a mismatch between supply and
demand in  Latin America ’s biggest economy, the central bank said
in minutes from its April 19-20 meeting.  Policy makers have raised their benchmark rate three times
this year to 12 percent and last month said they will continue
tightening at a slower pace for longer than initially planned as
Brazil’s inflation outlook worsens.  President  Dilma Rousseff ’s government has been adopting
measures to curb consumer credit growth since December as it
seeks to slow economic growth and tame inflation. Fueled by the
expansion of credit and job creation, domestic demand helped
stoke 7.5 percent growth last year, the most in more than two
decades.  The so-called macro-prudential steps adopted by the
government have helped push up consumer lending rates, slowing
monthly total credit growth to 1 percent in March from a 1.3
percent in February, the central bank said April 27.  To contact the reporter on this story:
