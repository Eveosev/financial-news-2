Jordan bought 100,000 metric tons of
barley and 50,000 tons of wheat, the Ministry of Industry and
Trade said.  The barley was purchased at $281 a ton and the wheat at
$361 a ton for delivery at the Red Sea port of Aqaba, Mohamad
Malahmeh, head of the ministryâ€™s tenders department, said by
telephone today.  The ministry first issued tenders to buy 100,000 tons of
wheat and an equal amount of barley on April 13. It reissued the
tenders last week because prices offered by suppliers were too
high.  To contact the reporter on this story:
