Brazil ’s real rose as investors
increased demand for higher-yielding assets as commodities rose
and U.S. stocks advanced.  The real gained 0.1 percent to 1.6198 per dollar at 5 p.m.
 New York  time, from 1.6218 yesterday.  Commodity prices, measured by the UBS Bloomberg index of
raw materials, reversed an earlier drop and rose 0.2 percent.
U.S. stocks advanced and crude oil reversed earlier losses and
gained as much as 2.3 percent in New York trading. The real
strengthened as investors increased demand for riskier assets on
gains in oil and stocks, Marjorie Hernandez, a currency
strategist at HSBC Holdings Plc in New York, said by phone.  “The external market flipped, and the real went along,”
Jorge Dib,  fund manager  at Grau Gestao de Ativos, said in a
telephone interview from Sao Paulo.  The central bank said it twice purchased dollars today in
the  spot market , first at 1.6226 reais and then at 1.6197 each.
Buying the U.S. currency is part of a regular effort by policy
makers to stem the real’s two-year, 28 percent rally, the most
in emerging markets tracked by Bloomberg over the period.  Yields on Brazilian interest-rate futures contracts due in
January rose one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 12.29
percent. Yields on the contracts maturing in January 2013 fell
one basis point to 12.51 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
