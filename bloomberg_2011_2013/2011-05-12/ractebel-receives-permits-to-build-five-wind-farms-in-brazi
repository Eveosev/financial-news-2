Tractebel Energia SA (TBLE3) , the Brazilian
unit of  GDF Suez (GSZ)  SA, received permits to build five wind farms
with total capacity of 145.4 megawatts.  The projects will be built in the country’s northeastern
states of Ceara and Piaui and will cost 630 million reais ($389
million), Florianopolis-based Tractebel said yesterday in a
filing. They are expected to go into operation in the fourth
quarter of 2012 and will sell power in Brazil’s free market for
electricity.  To contact the reporter on this story:
