South Africa  is offering 600 million
rand ($86 million) of inflation-linked bonds tomorrow as
consumer-price growth in  Africa ’s biggest economy erodes the
real value of holding fixed-income assets.  The Pretoria-based central bank will auction inflation-
linked debt, called linkers, maturing in 2022, 2028 and 2033 at
its weekly auction, it said on its Bloomberg page. When
inflation accelerates, their value rises relative to fixed-
interest debt.  South Africa’s inflation rate, due to be reported on May
17, advanced to 4.5 percent in April, from 4.1 percent the month
before and 3.7 percent in February, according to the median
estimate of four economists surveyed by Bloomberg. Inflation may
average 5.72 percent over the next two years, according to the
yield difference, or breakeven rate, between two-year inflation-
linked bonds and standard notes of similar maturity.  “We like inflation-linked bonds,” Carmen Nel, a Cape
Town-based analyst at Rand Merchant Bank, said in a May 10
conference call. “We think the market is underestimating
inflation risk.”  Rand Merchant Bank expects the inflation rate to breach the
upper end of the  Reserve Bank ’s 3 percent to 6 percent target
range in September and to average 5.8 percent in 2012, fueled by
rising food and fuel prices and wages, Nel said. If the
inflation rate is higher than breakeven, inflation-linked bonds
beat returns on nominal bonds.  The inflation-linked bond auction is at 11 a.m. in
 Pretoria . The results will be announced at about 11.30 a.m., the
Reserve Bank said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
