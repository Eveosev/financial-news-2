Clearwire Corp. (CLWR) , the provider of
high-speed wireless service, tumbled the most in almost two
years after  Intel Corp. (INTC)  said it would sell up to 10 million
shares of the company’s Class A stock.  The share sale “does not affect any contractual
obligations or business arrangements between Intel and
Clearwire,”  Santa Clara , California-based Intel said in a
regulatory filing made public yesterday.  While Intel makes chips used in phones that operate on
Clearwire’s fourth-generation mobile technology, called WiMax,
Kirkland, Washington-based Clearwire has indicated it may switch
to a more commonly used standard, known as long-term evolution,
or LTE. That transition would make it less valuable to Intel,
said  Michael Nelson , an analyst at Mizuho Securities in New
York, who recommends buying Clearwire shares.  Clearwire is testing LTE and plans to complete the trials
by mid-year.  Clearwire became a 4G wireless company in 2008 when Intel,
 Sprint Nextel Corp. (S)  and other investors contributed $3.2 billion
in return for shares. Intel owns 102.4 million shares, according
to the filing.  Since that time, the unprofitable company has struggled to
meet its cash needs as it builds out the new network. The
company raised $1.56 billion from investors in 2009 and
disclosed in 2010 that it had doubt about its ability to
continue as a “going concern” before raising cash in a bond
sale.  Clearwire dropped 74 cents, or 16 percent, to $3.99 at 4:29
p.m. New York time in Nasdaq Stock Market trading, the largest
decline since August 2009. The company has fallen 23 percent
this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
