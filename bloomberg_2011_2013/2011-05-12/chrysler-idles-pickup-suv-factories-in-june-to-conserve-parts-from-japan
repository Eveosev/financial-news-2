Chrysler Group LLC, the automaker run
by  Fiat SpA (F) , is pulling ahead summer shutdowns at some factories
and canceling overtime at a plant in  Mexico  to conserve parts
from suppliers affected by the March earthquake in  Japan .  The automaker, based in  Auburn Hills , Michigan, will idle
some factories in Ohio and Michigan in June, instead of July,
Jodi Tinson, a Chrysler spokeswoman, said today in an e-mail.
The factories make pickups and sport-utility vehicles. U.S.
automakers typically stop production for a week or two to change
tooling before beginning the next model year’s production.  Chrysler’s Toledo North Assembly Plant that builds Jeep
Liberty and Dodge Nitro SUVs in Ohio will shut down during the
weeks of June 20 and June 27 instead of during the week of July
11 and July 18, she said. The Toledo Supplier Park that produces
Jeep Wranglers will shut down for the week of June 20 instead of
the week of July 11, Tinson said.  A factory that makes Ram 1500 and Dakota pickups in Warren,
 Michigan , will be closed during the weeks of June 20 and June 27
instead of July 11 and July 18, she said.  The assembly plant in Saltillo, Mexico, that makes Ram
trucks will eliminate overtime scheduled for May 20, May 27,
June 10 and June 24 instead of taking down time during the week
of July 11, she said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
