French fertilizer sales through
February rose as nitrogen, potassium and phosphate sales in the
European Union’s biggest crop producer climbed to the highest
in three years,  France ’s fertilizer-industry association said.  Shipments of potassium rose 63 percent to 461,000
metric tons in the May-February period from 283,000 tons a year
earlier, Paris-based Unifa said in an e-mailed statement today.
Phosphorus fertilizer sales climbed 30 percent to 425,000 tons
from 327,000 tons.  French deliveries of nitrogen fertilizer for July through
February rose 18 percent to 1.61 million tons from 1.37 million
tons, the report showed.  France is the EU’s largest fertilizer user, according to
the International Fertilizer Industry Association.  Unifa tracks nitrogen sales on the basis of a year that
starts July 1, while the marketing year for potassium and
phosphorus starts May 1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
