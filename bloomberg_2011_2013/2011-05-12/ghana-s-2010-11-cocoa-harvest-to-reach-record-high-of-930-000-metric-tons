Ghana ’s 2010-11 cocoa harvest will
reach 930,000 metric tons, the highest in the West African
nation’s history, Yaw Adu-Ampomah, deputy chief executive of the
Ghana Cocoa Board said.  The board that oversees the industry in the world’s second-
biggest grower of the chocolate ingredient expects the main-crop
harvest, which ends May 19, to be 860,000 tons, he said by phone
from Accra, the capital, today. The light crop, which runs from
June to about September, will produce 70,000 tons, he said.  “Favorable weather, increased fertilizer use and improved
farm-chemical application are the factors driving the better
harvest this year,” he said.  The board, known as Cocobod, estimated about 30,000 tons of
beans were smuggled from neighboring  Ivory Coast , the world’s
top cocoa grower, into Ghana, said Adu-Ampomah. A four-month
post-election crisis halted exports of Ivorian beans earlier
this year.  Purchases from farmers in the 30 weeks of the season to
April 28 were 822,000 tons, he said. The 12-week light crop
season will begin on June 2, two weeks after the closure of the
main crop.  Cocoa for July delivery dropped 2.6 percent, or $80, to
$3,038 per ton by 1:43 p.m. in  New York .  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
