reported, without saying where it got the information.  Rasolomanana was replaced by Guy Ratovondrahona, the head
of the Banking and Finance Supervision Commission, the
Antananarivo-based newspaper said. Employees may strike because
of changes at the Madagascar Central Bank, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
