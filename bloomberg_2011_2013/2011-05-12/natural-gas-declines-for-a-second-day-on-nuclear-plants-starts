Natural gas futures slipped for a
second day in  New York  as nuclear power plants started up after
maintenance shutdowns, reducing demand for gas as a replacement
fuel.  Gas declined as much as 1.7 percent as the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission reported that atomic power production
climbed for a sixth day, increasing 946 megawatts from yesterday
to 76,528 megawatts, or 75 percent of capacity, according to an
NRC report today and data compiled by Bloomberg.  “Usually when nuclear plants are down, natural gas is
going to replace that capacity,” said  Phil Flynn , vice
president of research at PFGBest in Chicago. “As nuclear power
plants come back online, some of that gas demand will falter.”  Natural gas for June delivery fell 2.2 cents, or 0.5
percent, to $4.159 per million British thermal units at 9:11
a.m. on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . The futures have
declined 5.6 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
