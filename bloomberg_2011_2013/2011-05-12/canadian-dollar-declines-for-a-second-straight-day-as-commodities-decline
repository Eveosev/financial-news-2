Canada ’s dollar fluctuated against
the greenback as prices of raw materials advanced, buoying
demand for assets of commodity-exporting nations.  The loonie, as Canada’s currency is known for the image of
the aquatic bird on the C$1 coin, earlier slumped the most in a
week on an intraday basis as oil fell as much as 3 percent. The
price of crude, Canada’s biggest export, later rallied as much
as 2.3 percent and stocks gained.  “Oil hit some good support levels, and that has helped
Canada to drag itself higher,” said  Dean Popplewell , an analyst
at the online currency-trading firm Oanda Corp. in Toronto.
Support is a level where buy orders may be clustered.  The loonie depreciated 0.1 percent to 96.27 cents versus
the greenback at 5 p.m. in Toronto, from 96.19 cents yesterday.
One Canadian dollar buys $1.0388. The currency earlier slid 0.8
percent, the most on an intraday basis since May 5. It touched
94.46 cents on April 29, the strongest level since November
2007.  Canadian  government bonds  fell, pushing 10-year yields up
one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 3.23 percent. The
price of the 3.25 percent security maturing in June 2021 slipped
11 cents to C$100.16.  Crude oil for June delivery in  New York  rose 0.6 percent to
$98.83 a barrel after earlier dropping to $95.25 a barrel. Raw
materials including crude oil account for about half of Canada’s
export revenue.  ‘Some Weakness’  “The trend for the Canadian dollar over the last few days
has been some weakness,” said  David Watt , senior currency
strategist at Royal Bank of Canada’s RBC Capital Markets unit in
Toronto. “We’ve got some uncertainty in the economic outlook.”  Canada’s new-home price index was unchanged in March after
four gains, the government statistics agency said. Economists
predicted the index would rise 0.3 percent, according to the
median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey with 12 responses.  The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Index of 24  raw materials  was
little changed after reversing earlier losses. The Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index rose 0.5 percent.  To contact the reporters for this story:
