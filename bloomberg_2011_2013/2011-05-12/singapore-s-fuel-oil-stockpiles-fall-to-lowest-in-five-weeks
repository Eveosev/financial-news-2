Singapore ’s stockpiles of residues,
or  fuel oil , fell to the lowest in five weeks, data from a unit
of the Ministry of Trade and Industry showed.  Onshore inventories of residues, including fuel oil and
low-sulfur waxy residue and excluding bitumen, dropped 3.6
percent to 21 million barrels in the seven days to May 11,
 International Enterprise Singapore  said in an e-mailed statement
today. Supplies are at the lowest since April 6.  Supplies of middle distillates, including gasoil and
kerosene, shrank 3.8 percent to 11.8 million barrels. Last week
they surged 29 percent, the most since Jan. 23, 2008. Light
distillates such as naphtha, reformate and gasoline dropped 4.2
percent to 10.3 million barrels.  The trade ministry surveys refiners,  oil companies  and
storage terminals on a voluntary basis. The results may exclude
some offshore storage capacity, International Enterprise said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
