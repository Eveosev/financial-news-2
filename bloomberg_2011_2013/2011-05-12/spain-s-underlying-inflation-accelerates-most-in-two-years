Spain ’s underlying inflation rate
accelerated in April at the fastest pace in more than two years,
adding to evidence of pressure on prices as the European Central
Bank signals it will continue to raise interest rates.  Core consumer prices, which exclude energy and fresh food,
gained 2.1 percent from a year earlier, after a 1.7 percent
increase the previous month, the  National Statistics Institute 
in Madrid said today. That was the highest rate since December
2008. Headline inflation, based on European Union calculations,
was 3.5 percent, matching an initial estimate on April 29.  ECB President  Jean-Claude Trichet  said on May 9 the world’s
central bankers are united in fighting inflation after the
Frankfurt-based bank raised interest rates in April for the
first time in almost three years. Euro-area inflation is already
in breach of the ECB’s 2 percent ceiling, accelerating to 2.8
percent in April, and Spanish inflation is outpacing the
regional average even as the indebted economy struggles to
emerge from a three-year slump.  To contact the reporter on this story:
