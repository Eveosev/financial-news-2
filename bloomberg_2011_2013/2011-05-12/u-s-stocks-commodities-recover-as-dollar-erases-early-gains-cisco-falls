U.S. stocks and commodities erased
losses, while the Dollar Index slid, as riskier assets recovered
from an early slump triggered by  China ’s efforts to curb lending
and a profit forecast at Cisco Systems Inc. that missed
analysts’ estimates.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index was little changed at
1,341.69 at 11:40 a.m. in  New York  after slumping as much as 0.8
percent. The S&P GSCI Index of commodities rose less than 0.1
percent after tumbling as much as 2.3 percent. The Dollar Index,
which tracks the currency against six major peers, slipped 0.2
percent to 75.169 to reverse a rally of as much as 0.4 percent.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
