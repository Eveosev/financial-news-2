Benetton Group SpA (BEN) ,  Italy ’s largest
clothing retailer, is the only company that registered to take
part in May 13 auction for production facilities of clothing
manufacturer  Nitex d.o.o.  in the southern city of Nis,  Blic 
newspaper reported, citing local municipal sources.  Benetton agreed with the Serbian authorities in January to
receive incentives for creating jobs in a planned 43.2 million-
euro ($61.41 million) investment in a textile plant in Nis, with
possible takeover of Nitex. Auction requirements stipulated that
a bidder must have at least 40-year experience in the industry
and more than 900 million euro turnover in 2010, “apparently
tailored to suit” Benetton, the report said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
