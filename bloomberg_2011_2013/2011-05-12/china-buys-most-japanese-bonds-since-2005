China ’s net purchases of Japan’s
long-term debt reached a record as the larger nation seeks to
diversify the world’s biggest currency reserves.  China  bought  a net 1.33 trillion yen ($16.6 billion) in
Japanese long-term bonds in April, the biggest amount since
records began in January 2005, according to data released today
in Tokyo by Japan’s Ministry of Finance. The nation sold a net
1.47 trillion yen of short-term debt, the data shows.  “As China tries to diversify its assets with its huge
foreign-exchange reserves, it probably wants to have yen-
denominated assets to some extent” in the longer term, said
Tetsuya Inoue, chief researcher for financial markets for Tokyo-
based Nomura Research Institute Ltd. “China has a strong
trading relationship with  Japan .”  China’s net purchases of Japan’s long-term debt exceeded
the previous record of 234.5 billion yen set in March.
International investors increased their holdings of Japan’s
longer-term bonds for a sixth week, the longest stretch since
August, ministry data released on June 2 showed.  Japanese government debt due in 10 years and longer has
handed investors a 2.2 percent gain since the start of April,
versus a 1 percent advance for the broad market, based on Bank
of America Merrill Lynch data. The Nikkei 225 Stock Average has
fallen 3.1 percent over the same period.  Low Rates  “Adding to diversification of its foreign reserves, China
may have bought mid- to long-term on bets Japan’s interest rates
will remain low because of the impact from the earthquake,”
said Makoto Noji, a senior bond and currency strategist in Tokyo
at SMBC Nikko Securities Inc., one of the 24 primary dealers
obliged to bid at government debt sales.  Japan’s economy shrank 3.7 percent in the first quarter
after the magnitude-9 earthquake and tsunami on March 11
disrupted production and prompted consumers to cut back spending.  Bank of Japan  Governor Masaaki Shirakawa and his eight
colleagues decided on May 20 to maintain a 30-trillion yen
credit program and a 10-trillion yen asset-purchase fund that
represent the bank’s main policy tools. The key overnight rate
was kept at zero to 0.1 percent  The benchmark 10-year yield dropped to 1.105 percent on May
16, the lowest since November, after touching 1.335 percent on
April 11. The rate on the 1.2 percent security due June 2021 was
unchanged at 1.160 today.  The yield spread between 10-year Japanese government debt
and five-year notes narrowed to 74 basis points today, compared
with 79 basis points on April 4.  China has more than $3 trillion in foreign reserves.  To contact the reporters on this story:
