K+S AG, which sells nitrogen
fertilizer supplied by  BASF SE (BAS) , may divest its distribution arm
in conjunction with BASF’s planned disposal of fertilizer
plants, two people with knowledge of the situation said.  Combining the assets is an option if a potential bidder for
BASF’s factories, which generate about 500 million euros ($706
million) in sales, also needs K+S’s sales operations, said the
people, who declined to be identified because the sale processes
are private.  BASF has attracted interest from companies including  Yara
International ASA (YAR) , the world’s biggest publicly traded nitrogen-
fertilizer maker, and Orascom Construction Industries. K+S runs
its nitrogen operations as a trading business, distributing
ammonium sulphate and nitrogen fertilizers supplied by BASF and
Lanxess AG.  The K+S unit, which includes garden-fertilizer brand Compo
being divested in a separate process, sold 4.7 million tons of
products last year, with operating profit of 67.4 million euros.
Profit more than tripled in the first quarter to 49.6 million
euros, the highest in at least nine quarters. K+S doesn’t break
out earnings for individual businesses within the unit.  K+S spokesman Michael Wudonig said the company isn’t
involved in the BASF process, yet is observing it “carefully”
and all options are being considered.  BASF will honor its contractual agreements with K+S and the
company can’t comment on K+S’s intentions, said spokeswoman
Jennifer Moore-Braun.  To contact the reporter on this story:
