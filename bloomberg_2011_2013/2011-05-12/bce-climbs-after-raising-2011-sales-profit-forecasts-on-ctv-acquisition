BCE Inc. (BCE) ,  Canada ’s largest phone
company, rose to its highest level in two and a half years after
raising its full-year sales and profit forecasts.  Profit will be C$2.95 to C$3.05 a share, up from a previous
projection of C$2.90 to C$3 a share, the Montreal-based company
said in a statement today. Revenue will probably climb by 9
percent to 11 percent this year, BCE said, up from a target of 1
percent to 2 percent growth given in February.  Chief Executive Officer George Cope boosted BCE’s forecasts
after completing the company’s purchase of broadcaster CTV in
April. The acquisition gives BCE content including sports
channel TSN that it can sell to its growing number of smartphone
and tablet computer customers. CTV will add 7 cents a share to
profit in the last nine months of 2011, Cope said today.  BCE rose 88 cents to C$37.82 at 1:36 p.m. on the Toronto
Stock Exchange, its highest intraday price since Nov. 25, 2008.
Before today, the shares had added 4.5 percent this year.  Analysts had projected full-year profit of $2.98 a share on
sales of $18.9 billion, the average of estimates compiled by
Bloomberg.  Asked by reporters today after the company’s annual
shareholder meeting in Toronto whether he wants to acquire more
content, Cope said “we have all the assets we believe we need
to execute our Strategy.”  Maple Leaf Sports and Entertainment Ltd., which owns the
Toronto Maple Leafs professional hockey team and the  National
Basketball Association ’s Raptors basketball team, may be
acquired for as much as $2.25 billion by BCE or rival  Rogers
Communications Inc. (RCI/B) , Forbes reported today, citing a banker it
didn’t name. The  Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan  reiterated this
week it plans to sell the company.  Generate Revenue  Rogers, Canada’s largest wireless carrier, owns Major
League Baseball’s Toronto Blue Jays and BCE owns an undisclosed
minority stake in the  Montreal Canadiens  hockey team.  BCE today said first-quarter profit fell 29 percent to
C$503 million, or 67 cents a share, as it didn’t repeat asset-
sale gains it had a year earlier. Profit excluding some costs
was 72 cents a share, compared with the 69 cents estimated by
analysts.  Cope is trying to sell more high-end smartphones which tend
to generate better data revenue to narrow the gap with Rogers.
Cope also aims to ward off new carriers Public Mobile, Wind
Mobile and Mobilicity, which have been aggressively targeting
BCE’s Solo prepaid customers with no-frills, unlimited call
plans.  While Bell, BCE’s main consumer brand, added 80,648
contract subscribers in the quarter, the company lost 75,356
prepaid customers last quarter, meaning net customer gains were
5,292 in the quarter.  ‘Very Strong’  That missed the 65,000 estimate by  Dvai Ghose , an analyst
at Canaccord Genuity in Toronto. Contract-subscriber additions
were “very strong” and the prepaid decline was “much worse”
than expected, said Ghose, who has a “hold” rating on the
stock.  In the year-earlier quarter, BCE’s profit included C$272
million from asset sales and other gains.  Sales were little changed at C$4.47 billion. Analysts
predicted C$4.48 billion, the average of 12 estimates compiled
by Bloomberg. Bell generated C$51.68 in average revenue per
customer, missing Ghose’s estimate of C$52.03.  BCE raised its dividend by 5 percent to C$2.07 a share, the
sixth increase since 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
