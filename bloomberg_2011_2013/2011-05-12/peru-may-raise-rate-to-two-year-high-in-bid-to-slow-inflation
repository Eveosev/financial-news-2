Peru ’s central bank will probably
raise its benchmark lending rate to the highest level in two
years today after inflation last month accelerated above policy
makers’ target for the first time since 2009.  The seven-member board will raise the benchmark rate by a
quarter point to 4.25 percent, according to 10 of 12 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg. One economist forecasts a half-point rise
and one expects a pause. The board will announce its decision at
about 6 p.m. New York time.  Policy makers can afford to hold off accelerating the pace
of monetary tightening, even as price pressures build, because
companies are postponing investments until they know the outcome
of next month’s presidential runoff,  Hugo Perea , chief economist
at BBVA Banco Continential. Inflation last month breached the 3
percent upper limit of Peru’s target range for the first time in
almost two years.  “The economy will probably show a more marked slowdown in
the second quarter than we’ve seen to date,” Perea said in a
telephone interview from Lima.  Finance Minister Ismael Benavides said in a May 3 interview
that domestic demand is slowing as investors fret over the
policies of ex-army officer  Ollanta Humala , who is tied in polls
with Congresswoman Keiko Fujimori ahead of the June 5 vote.  Humala’s campaign platform includes a proposal to raise
mining taxes and revise contracts with foreign companies. The
one-time ally of Venezuelan President  Hugo Chavez  had 39 percent
support in an Ipsos Apoyo survey published May 9, compared with
41 percent for Fujimori.  Food, Fuel  The government expects gross domestic product to expand 6.5
percent this year, less than its previous forecast of 7.5
percent, Benavides said. GDP rose 8.5 percent in February from a
year earlier, after surging 10 percent in January.  The central bank will use “conventional” policy tools
after annual inflation last month breached the upper limit of
its 1 percent to 3 percent target range for the first time in
almost two years, bank President Julio Velarde said last week.  Food prices have risen more than expected in 2011, and the
government will eventually have to raise gasoline prices that
have been frozen since February to reflect higher crude  oil
prices , said Perea, who is forecasting a quarter-point increase.  “The central bank needs to keep tightening to ease demand
growth and to try to keep inflation expectations anchored,” he
said.  Consumer prices rose 3.34 percent in April from a year
earlier and 0.68 percent from March, beating analysts’
estimates. Food prices jumped 1.2 percent and clothing costs
climbed 1 percent during the month. The monthly inflation rate
was 0.7 percent in March, the highest in 33 months.  Above-Target  The jump in inflation reflected higher international prices
for corn, wheat and cotton and the higher cost of food produced
locally. Inflation was last above policy makers’ target in June
2009, when prices rose 3.06 percent from a year earlier.  Velarde on May 9 said inflation will top the upper limit of
the bank’s target range in 2011. He added that inflation in May
will be slower, and a decline in commodity prices will ease
inflationary pressures.  The Andean nation’s consumer price index is the second-most
exposed to food inflation among emerging markets, after the
 Philippines , according to the central bank. Food and drink costs
account for 38 percent of the gauge.  Peruvian economists raised their 2011 inflation forecasts
for a third straight month in April, forecasting a 3.5 percent
rise, according to the central bank’s latest survey.  Regional Response  Higher food and oil prices are pushing policy makers in
 South America  to tighten  money supply  and cool consumer demand.  Chilean policy makers accelerated the pace of tightening at
their last two meetings while  Colombia ’s central bank raised
borrowing costs for a third straight month in April to head off
inflationary pressures.  Brazilian central bank President Alexandre Tombini last
week pledged that policy makers will raise  interest rates  for as
long as needed to bring inflation back to their target in 2012.  Still, while the latest inflation readings in Chile and
Colombia have been lower than expected and price rises may have
peaked in  Brazil , the outlook for Peru has deteriorated.  “Inflation is picking up steam,” said Kathryn Rooney Vera, an emerging markets analyst at Bulltick Capital Markets in
Miami. After today’s quarter-point rise, she expects a further
two increases to take Peru’s benchmark rate to 4.75 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
