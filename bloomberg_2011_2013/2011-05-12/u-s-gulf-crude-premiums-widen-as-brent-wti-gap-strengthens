U.S. Gulf oil grades gained as the
spread between the U.S. benchmark West  Texas  Intermediate and
Brent widened for the fifth consecutive day.  The gap between WTI and its European counterpart for June
delivery increased 9 cents to $14.45 a barrel at 12:49 p.m. in
 New York . The differential for the contract nearest to
expiration reached a record $15.94 on Feb. 16.  When Brent gains versus WTI, it strengthens the value of
low-sulfur U.S. grades that compete with West African oil priced
against the European grade.  Heavy Louisiana Sweet’s premium to WTI widened $1 to $15 a
barrel at 12:10 p.m. in New York, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Light Louisiana Sweet’s premium gained 40 cents to
$16.30 over the benchmark.  Among sour, or high-sulfur, grades, the premium for Mars
Blend widened 50 cents to $8.60 a barrel over WTI. Poseidon’s
premium strengthened 30 cents to $8.50. Thunder Horse’s premium
gained 55 cents to $14 a barrel over WTI.  Southern Green Canyon’s premium strengthened 55 cents to
$6.50 a barrel. The grade has gained 37 percent since April 25,
when Bloomberg reported planned work on BP Plc’s Mad Dog
platform was expected to last several more weeks. Output from
the Mad Dog platform is part of Southern Green Canyon crude
stream, according to BP’s website.  West Texas Sour’s discount was unchanged at $2.75 a barrel.
It has tracked more closely to its historical average discount
versus WTI because it’s delivered in Midland, Texas, away from
the  Gulf Coast  and close to Cushing,  Oklahoma , the delivery
point for oil traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange .  The premium for Syncrude was unchanged at $14.30 a barrel.
Syncrude is a light, low-sulfur synthetic oil derived from the
 tar sands  in Alberta.  The discount for Western Canada Select was unchanged at
$17.45 a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
