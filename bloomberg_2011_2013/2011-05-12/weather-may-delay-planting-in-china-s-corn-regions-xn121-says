China ’s Heilongjiang province, the
second-biggest grower of corn, is forecast to get more wet, cold
weather, which may slow the planting of spring crops, weather
information site Xn121.com said.  Rain since yesterday, coming after precipitation earlier
this month, has made fields too muddy to operate machinery, said
the  website , owned by the China Meteorological Administration.
Temperatures may fall by as much as 6 degrees Celsius following
the rain, slowing the sprouting of seeds and the growth of young
plants, it said.  Heilongjiang, China’s northernmost province, is also the
top producer of soybeans and japonica rice, a staple more
favored by consumers than other rice varieties.  Jilin, the third-biggest corn grower located to the south
of Heilongjiang, may also get wet, cold weather in the 10 days
through May 20, which can hinder the development of crops,
according to the regions’ weather  forecaster .  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
