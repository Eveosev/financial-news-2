Sugar output in  Brazil ’s Center
South, the world’s largest producing region, dropped 69 percent
from a year earlier in the beginning of the harvesting season,
industry association Unica said.  Output fell to 795,000 metric tons between the start of the
harvest in mid-March and the end of April, Unica said today in
an e-mailed statement. In the same period a year earlier, sugar
production was 2.56 million tons. Brazil’s sugar-cane harvest
usually runs from March until December.  Farmers processed 23.7 million tons of the tropical plant
through the end of last month, down 60 percent from a year
earlier. Ethanol production fell 61 percent to 894.8 million
liters (236 million gallons).  To contact the reporter on this story:
