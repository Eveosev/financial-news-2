Nobel Biocare Holding AG is
interested in Camlog, a Basel-based maker of dental implants,
Handelszeitung reported today, without saying how it got the
information.  Camlog is the second-largest provider of implants for the
the German market, according to the newspaper. Company founder
Juerg Eichenberger, who holds 10 percent, isnâ€™t seeking any
contact to Nobel, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
