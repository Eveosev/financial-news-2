Landesbank Baden-Wuerttemberg may
sell its real-estate unit to a private investor,  Financial Times
Deutschland said , citing Nils Schmid, designated economy and
finance minister of the German state of Baden-Wuerttemberg.  Deutsche Wohnen AG (DWNI) , Deutsche Annington Immobilien GmbH and
 Patrizia Immobilien AG (P1Z)  are reported to be interested in buying
the bank’s real-estate, the newspaper said. Eight southern
German cities are also preparing a joint offer for the unit,
although they haven’t agreed on a consortium contract, the
newspaper said.  The state of Baden-Wuerttemberg owns about 40 percent of
LBBW. The bank’s real-estate unit owns about 20,000 apartments
worth about 1.5 billion euros ($2.1 billion), FTD said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
