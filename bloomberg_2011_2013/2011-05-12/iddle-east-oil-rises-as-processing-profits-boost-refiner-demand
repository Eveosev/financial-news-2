Middle East crude oils for sale to
 Asia  rose against their benchmarks as higher-than-average
processing profits drove demand from refiners.  Murban for July loading, produced in  Abu Dhabi , climbed 18
cents to a premium of 63 cents a barrel above its official
selling price, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Lower
Zakum, also produced in the emirate, advanced to the same level.
Qatar Marine climbed 10 cents to a premium of 23 cents a barrel.  Middle East crudes have been supported by a surge in
refining profits for middle distillates including gasoil and
kerosene. Gasoil’s premium to Dubai crude was at $18.20 a
barrel, about 58 percent higher than a year earlier, according
to data from PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a London-based brokerage.
Murban, Lower Zakum and Qatar Marine is prized by refiners for
their higher yield of middle distillates compared with heavier
Middle East crude such as  Saudi Arabia ’s Arab Medium.  Oman oil for immediate loading dropped $5.76, or 5.2
percent, to $106.08 a barrel, according to Bloomberg data. Dubai
for loading in July fell 5.2 percent to $105.51 and Murban crude
decreased 4.8 percent to $110.83 a barrel.  The Brent-Dubai exchange for swaps for June narrowed 9
cents to $6.54 a barrel, PVM data showed. The exchange for swaps
for July fell 5 cents to $6.38 a barrel.  Oman futures for July delivery dropped $1.71 today to
$105.97 a barrel on the  Dubai Mercantile Exchange  at 5:54 p.m.
Singapore time, with 1,061 contracts traded. The settlement
price was at $106.26 at 12:30 p.m. in Dubai.  To contact the reporter on this story:
