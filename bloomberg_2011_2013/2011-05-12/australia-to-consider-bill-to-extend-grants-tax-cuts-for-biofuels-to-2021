Australia ’s parliament will consider
a bill that proposes extending grants and reduced taxes for
biofuels for another 10 years to 2021.  Assistant Treasurer Bill Shorten introduced the legislation
today to extend the current taxation arrangements for a group of
organic fuels, which was set to be amended on Dec. 1, according
to a statement on the Treasury’s  website .  “The government will undertake a review of the taxation
and grant arrangements for ethanol, biodiesel, renewable diesel
and methanol after 30 June 2021,” it said. “Methanol will
continue to be untaxed.”  Melbourne-based  Australian Renewable Fuels Ltd. (ARW)  said the
legislation would exempt biodiesel produced locally from having
to pay excise tax for the next 10 years, unlike imports.  “This is very encouraging news and a clear indication of
government support for the renewable fuels sector,” Chief
Executive Tom Engelsman said in a statement to the Australian
Stock Exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
