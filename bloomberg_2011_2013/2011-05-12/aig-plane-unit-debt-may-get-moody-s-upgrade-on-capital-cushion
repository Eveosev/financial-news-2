American International Group Inc. (AIG) ’s
plane unit may be upgraded after extending the maturity of debts
and reducing leverage, Moody’s Corp. said.  The outlook on International Lease Finance Corp.’s debt was
lifted to positive as the Los Angeles-based subsidiary is
“building a capital cushion to absorb potential asset-quality
and performance weakness,” the ratings firm said today in a
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
