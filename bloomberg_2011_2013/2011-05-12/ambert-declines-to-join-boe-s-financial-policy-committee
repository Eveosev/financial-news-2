Richard Lambert  won’t take up his
place on the Bank of England’s Financial Policy Committee, which
is scheduled to hold its first meeting in a month.  “I wish to devote my time to a wider range of aspects of
public policy,” Lambert said in a statement issued by the
central bank in  London  today. “Membership of the committee
could place constraints on my ability to do so.”  The government established the panel to help prevent a
repeat of the financial crisis, and will operate on an interim
basis alongside the Monetary Policy Committee. The first meeting
is scheduled for June 16 and Bank of England Governor  Mervyn King  will chair a press conference on June 24.  King said Lambert’s “breadth of knowledge” will be missed
by the committee. Chancellor of the Exchequer  George Osborne 
will appoint a replacement “in due course,” the bank said.  Lambert, a former director general of the Confederation of
British Industry, the U.K.’s biggest business lobby, had been
appointed in February to the panel by Osborne. Former Federal
Reserve Vice Chairman  Donald Kohn , former Deutsche Bank AG
official Michael Cohrs and former Bank of England director
Alastair Clark were also appointed at the same time.  They join five Bank of England officials including King
plus Adair Turner and Hector Sants of the Financial Services
Authority.  To contact the reporters on this story:
