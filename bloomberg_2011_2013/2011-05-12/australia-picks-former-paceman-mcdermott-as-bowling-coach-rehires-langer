Cricket Australia  hired former strike
bowler Craig McDermott as the national team’s bowling coach and
reappointed Justin Langer to oversee the batting.  McDermott, who took 291 wickets at 28.63 apiece in 71
Tests, was chosen from a “strong field of candidates from
around the world,” Michael Brown, Cricket Australia’s General
Manager of Cricket, said today in a statement.  McDermott, 46, replaces Troy Cooley, who left the role in
January to take over as head coach of Australia’s Centre of
Excellence. Australia, under new captain  Michael Clarke , is
scheduled to tour Sri Lanka in July and August before visiting
South Africa in October and November.  “We’ve got some challenging tours ahead in the coming
months,” McDermott said. “I’m excited at the opportunity to be
part of the group that helps get  Australia  back to number
one in all forms of cricket.”  Former Test opener Langer, who became the team’s batting
coach 18 months ago, was reappointed in the role of assistant
coach to Tim Nielsen for 12 months.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
