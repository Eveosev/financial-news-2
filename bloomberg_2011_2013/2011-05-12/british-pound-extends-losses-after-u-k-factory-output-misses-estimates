The pound extended losses against the
dollar and euro after U.K. industrial and manufacturing output
rose less-than-estimated in March.  Sterling  weakened 0.5 percent to 87.24 pence per
euro as of 9:39 a.m. in  London . The pound also fell 0.5 percent
to $1.6266.   Manufacturing output rose 0.2 percent in March from the
month before, the  Office for National Statistics  said today in
London. That was below the 0.3 percent increase predicted in a
Bloomberg survey of economists. Industrial production rose 0.3
percent from February, less than the 0.8 percent forecast by
economists.  To contact the reporter on this story:
