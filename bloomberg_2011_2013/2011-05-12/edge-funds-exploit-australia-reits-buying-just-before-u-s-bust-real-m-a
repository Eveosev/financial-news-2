What’s a Park Avenue office building
really worth? Almost 25 percent less to shareholders in
 Australia , where  hedge funds  are agitating for the nation’s
property trusts to sell their U.S. assets.  Australian real estate investment trusts are trading at an
average of 92 cents per dollar of net asset value, while U.S.
property trusts are valued at a 20 percent premium, according to
data compiled by UBS AG and Green Street Advisors Inc. The
valuation gap has prompted hedge funds from Orange Capital LLC
to Artis Capital Partners to push for sales of $3.1 billion in
U.S. office buildings and shopping centers owned by two
Australian REITs. One of them,  EDT Retail Trust (EDT) , is trading at a
15 percent discount to the value of its underlying assets.  Hedge funds are targeting property trusts in Australia
after U.S.-traded REITs surged 92 percent since slumping to a
record low in 2009, as commercial property prices rebounded,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. With Australian trusts
that bought more than $23 billion of U.S. properties still
trading at a discount, investors are betting they can turn a
profit by forcing the REITs to sell at market prices.  Blackstone
Group LP (BX)  offered $9.4 billion in March for U.S. shopping centers
owned by Australia’s  Centro Properties Group (CNP) , the private equity
firm’s largest deal since 2007.  “Some smart investors have picked up on this disparity,
built positions in these stocks and educated others in the
market about the opportunity,” said David Lazarus, senior
managing director at boutique investment bank EdgeRock Realty
Advisors LLC in New York. “This has put pressure on management
teams of the A-REITs and will lead to mergers or asset sales.”  Trading Below Assets  REITs in the U.S. traded at an average premium of 20
percent to their net asset values as of May 2, according to data
from  Newport Beach , California-based Green Street.  Australian REITs, which haven’t traded at a premium since
January 2010, were valued 7.8 percent below their net assets on
average as of April 30, UBS data show. Investors are valuing the
nation’s trusts at 23 percent less than those in the U.S.  “Australian REITs are trading at substantial discounts to
net asset backing, and are better off selling than buying,”
said Simon Garing, a real estate analyst at Bank of America
Corp.’s Merrill Lynch unit in Sydney.  The Bloomberg REIT index of 124 U.S.-listed property trusts
has rallied 16 percent in the past 12 months. During the same
time, 22 so-called A-REITs in the S&P/ASX 300 REIT Index are
down 1.4 percent in local currency terms.  Property Price Rebound  U.S. commercial property values increased about 42 percent
through April since a low in May 2009, erasing about two-thirds
of the decline that occurred during the worst U.S. recession
since the Great Depression, according to Green Street’s weighted
price index. The price rebound was driven in part by improving
capital and financial markets, according to the May 5 report.  While companies in the A-REIT index have cut debt and many
have sold assets abroad in the past two years, investors are
actively pushing them to divest more U.S. real estate holdings.
Many A-REITs are run by external managers responsible for the
operation of the trust in exchange for a fee. Such managers can
be removed by a special vote if a majority of investors present
support the move.  “Externally managed REITs are the norm in Australia and
some of these structures cost shareholders money,” EdgeRock’s
Lazarus said. “Incentives of external managers and shareholders
aren’t aligned and they benefit from different outcomes.”  Blackstone Deal  Blackstone, the biggest private-equity firm, plans to
complete its $9.4 billion purchase of Melbourne-based Centro’s
588 U.S. shopping centers and malls around mid-year. The deal is
New York-based Blackstone’s biggest since 2007, when it paid $26
billion including net debt for Beverly Hills, California-based
hotel chain Hilton Hotels Corp.  The Centro acquisition, at a 1.3 percent discount to the
malls’ value as of Dec. 31 according to Centro, signals that
Blackstone is betting on a continued recovery in U.S. commercial
property after the subprime crisis derailed Centro’s U.S.
acquisition spree as debt costs soared.  Australian property companies bought $23.5 billion in U.S.
real-estate assets in the four years through Dec. 2008,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The buying spree
backfired when the financial crisis froze credit markets.
Centro, which had A$16.5 billion of assets and A$16 billion of
debt before the agreement with Blackstone, was among the biggest
Australian casualties of the credit crunch.  ‘Peak of Bubble’  “No one has accused the Australians of being the smartest
guys in the room when it comes to buying U.S. real estate at the
peak of the bubble,” said Mike Kirby, director of research at
Green Street. “A lot of those deals didn’t create shareholder
value and may be unwound.”  Independent directors of Sydney-based EDT Retail, which
trades at a 15 percent discount to its net tangible asset value,
urged investors on May 3 to  reject  a takeover bid by its biggest
shareholder, EPN EDT Holdings II LLC, saying it undervalued the
company.  Investors including Artis Capital and PSQ Capital called
for EDT, which has interests in 48 U.S. shopping centers valued
at almost $1.4 billion as of December, to consider a sale
instead. The firms said in a letter to EDT that there was a
“large gap” between where EDT was trading and the value of the
assets.  “EDT’s assets are similar to Centro’s, of better quality
and are a more bite-sized portfolio for some of the buyers,”
Peter Kennan, managing partner at Artis Capital in  Hong Kong ,
said in an interview. “We’ve got a window here to sell.”  Interest in EDT  Area Property Partners, a New York-based private-equity
firm that also bid on Centro’s assets, is among companies that
expressed interest in EDT’s portfolio, according to a person
familiar with the firm’s discussions, who declined to be named
because the plans are private.  National Australia Bank Ltd. (NAB) , the
nation’s fourth-largest lender, bought a 35 percent stake in
Area in March.  Mitchell Breindel, an outside spokesman for Area, declined
to comment.  EDT Retail, which owns Shoppers’ World in a Boston suburb
and  Woodfield Village Green  in a suburb of  Chicago , received a
sweetened bid from EPN for 9 Australian cents a share on May 11,
up from the initial 7.8 cents-a-share offer.  John Martin, EDT’s Sydney-based chief accounting officer,
said the trust’s independent directors are reviewing EPN’s
revised offer and will release their response to the bid soon.  Outright Sale  Orange Capital in New York has pushed Sydney-based Charter
Hall to consider an outright sale of its portfolio, which has a
book value of about $1.7 billion, instead of pursuing a U.S.
joint venture for the office REIT.  Shares of Charter Hall, which owns  office buildings  in  Los
Angeles  and Tampa,  Florida , have risen 17 percent since Jan. 12,
the day before Orange Capital disclosed a stake and said it
hired advisers to evaluate options for the company. The REIT
closed at A$3.50 a share on May 11, a 12 percent discount to its
assets.  “We’ve always thought that the value of Charter Hall’s
assets, especially in the U.S., was far in excess of where they
were trading,” Orange Capital managing partner Daniel Lewis
said in an interview.  Orange Capital is cooperating with Luxor Capital Group LP
and Point Lobos Capital LLC on its initiatives to maximize
shareholder value, according to Australian regulatory filings.
The three hedge funds own shares amounting to 18.15 percent of
the voting rights of Charter, according to a May 9 filing.  Seeking Offers  Charter Hall is seeking offers for its entire U.S.
portfolio, people familiar with the plan said last month.  Blackstone, Toronto-based  Brookfield Asset Management Inc. (BAM) 
and  Highwoods Properties Inc. (HIW)  in Raleigh,  North Carolina , are
among firms that have expressed interest in some or all of
Charter Hall’s 14 U.S. properties, which may fetch more than
book value, the people said last month.  Bids for Charter Hall were due last week, according to a
person familiar with the process, who declined to be identified
because the matter is private. Kylie Ramsden, a spokeswoman for
Charter Hall, declined to comment.  Tishman Speyer Office Fund (TSO) , an Australian REIT started by
Tishman Speyer Properties LP in 2004, has a  portfolio  consisting
entirely of U.S. office buildings in such locations as Beverly
Hills,  California ; Greenwich,  Connecticut ; and  300 Park Avenue 
in  Manhattan . The property trust traded at 65 Australian cents
as of May 11, or a 4.4 percent discount to its  asset value .  The future of Australian-listed trusts that own primarily
U.S. assets, such as Tishman’s fund, “is very limited,” as
Australian investors remain wary of REITs focused overseas, said
Stuart Cartledge, managing director at boutique investment
management firm Phoenix Portfolios in  Melbourne .  “Those trusts that are trading at significant discounts to
NTA would certainly be of interest to external parties, be they
their own managers or private equity groups,” said Scott Courtney, head of REIT research at Morningstar Australasia Pty
in Sydney. “The margin between the underlying value of their
assets and their current trading prices makes them attractive,
particularly as conditions improve in the U.S.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
