UniCredit SpA (UCG) ,  Italy ’s biggest bank,
said first-quarter profit rose 56 percent after setting aside
less money for bad loans and higher income from its investment
banking business.  Net income increased to 810 million euros ($1.15 billion)
from 520 million euros a year earlier, the Milan-based bank said
in a statement today. That beat the 620 million-euro average
estimate of 16 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Chief Executive Officer  Federico Ghizzoni  is reviewing the
bank’s strategy in some markets to increase profitability.
UniCredit is the only Italian bank facing a second round of
stress tests that hasn’t announced a share sale to boost capital
ahead of the implementation of stricter rules.  “UniCredit may take the opportunity to reinforce its
capital base, together with the announcement of the new business
plan,” Manuela Meroni, an analyst at Banca IMI who has an
“add” recommendation on the stock, wrote in a May 10 report.
“The core Tier 1 is below that of the national competitors
following the announced rights issues.”  The bank said its core Tier 1 ratio, a key measure of
financial health, rose to 9.06 percent as of March 31 from 8.58
percent at the end of December.  Intesa Sanpaolo SpA (ISP) , Italy’s
second-biggest bank, forecast a ratio of 10 percent by 2011
following a planned 5 billion-euro share sale.  UniCredit’s loan-loss provisions dropped 16 percent to 1.5
billion euros in the quarter from a year earlier.  Operating income in the bank’s corporate and investment
banking division rose to 2.4 billion euros in the quarter from
2.16 billion a year ago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
