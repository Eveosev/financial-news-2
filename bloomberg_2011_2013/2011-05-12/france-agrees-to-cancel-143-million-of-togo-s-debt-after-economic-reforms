France  agreed to write off 66.2
billion  CFA francs  ($143 million) of Togo’s debt, five months
after the West African nation completed a economic package
backed by the World Bank and  International Monetary Fund .  The debt cancellation agreement, which includes all Togo’s
outstanding debt with France, was signed yesterday, the French
Embassy in Togo said in an e-mailed statement.  Togo become eligible for as much as $1.8 billion in debt
relief, or 82 percent of its total borrowing, after it sold
state-owned companies and curbed public spending. The country of
6 million people has a gross domestic product per capita of
$431, compared with the sub-Saharan African average of $624,
according to the  World Bank .
