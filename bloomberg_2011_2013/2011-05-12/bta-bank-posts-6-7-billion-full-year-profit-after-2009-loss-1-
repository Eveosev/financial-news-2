BTA Bank, Kazakhstan’s biggest lender
before the global credit crisis, posted 2010 earnings of $6.7
billion, bolstered by $5.8 billion from the debt restructuring
it completed last year.  The figure for net income compares with a loss of $7.5
billion in 2009, according to a statement distributed today in
Almaty, the country’s financial capital. The earnings were
calculated under international accounting standards.  BTA defaulted in April 2009, two months after being taken
over by the state-owned National Wellbeing Fund Samruk-Kazyna,
which now holds about 81 percent in the bank. The lender reduced
its debt burden to $4.2 billion from $16.7 billion in September
by distributing cash to creditors and issuing new debt.  The bank’s liabilities exceeded its assets by 105 billion
tenge ($717 million) at the end of last year, compared with a
deficit of 1.69 trillion tenge in2009, according to the earnings
statement. BTA plans to increase its assets by 5 percent this
year, while total lending may grow by as much as 2 percent,
Chief Executive Officer Anvar Saidenov told reporters today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
