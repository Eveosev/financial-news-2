FIFA president Sepp Blatter didn’t
consult the soccer ruling body’s executive committee on a
decision to give 20 million euros ($28.4 million) to Interpol to
help fight match-fixing, according to Mohamed Bin Hammam, who is
seeking to unseat him.  Bin Hammam, who’s sat on FIFA’s executive committee since
1996, said in a  blog on his website  that the donation was “just
another example of the current regime choosing to run football
how it sees fit.” The money is to be paid over 10 years to the
Lyon, France-based international police agency, according to a
May 9 news release from FIFA.  Qatar’s Bin Hammam is standing against Blatter, who’s
seeking a fourth term, in a June 1 election. Brian Alexander, a
spokesman for Blatter’s re-election campaign, referred a call
about the comment to FIFA’s media office which said in an e-mail
that the chairman of its finance committee was consulted. The
chairman is Argentina’s Julio Grondona, a FIFA executive member
since 1988.  The e-mail said there was a need “for an immediate
reaction” after new information about match-fixing emerged. A
court in Bochum,  Germany , has started hearing a case against six
men accused of being part of a criminal network that spanned 20
countries and tried to manipulate 300 matches across  Europe 
dating back to 2009.  About 70 arrests have been made in  Turkey  and another 29 in
 Croatia  in connection with the case.  To contact the reporter on this story:
