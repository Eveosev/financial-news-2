Kenana Sugar Co.,  Sudan ’s largest
sugar producer, raised output of refined sweetener from domestic
cane by 29 percent this crop year.  Output increased 79,600 metric tons from the prior period
to 355,752 tons, the company said in an e-mailed statement
today. Total production came to 385,921 tons after Kenana made
30,169 tons of refined, or white, sugar from imported raw
sweetener, the statement showed.  “All our raw sugar is imported from Brazil,” Marketing
Manager Hassan Erwa said by phone from Khartoum today. Later
this month, the company will start processing another 40,000
tons of raw sweetener delivered from the South American nation,
according to Erwa.  Kenana’s ethanol factory will produce a maximum of 40
million liters (10.6 million gallons) this year, Erwa said. The
biofuel is a byproduct of its sweetener manufacturing.  Kenana, established in 1982, is 34 percent-owned by Sudan’s
government, while the  Kuwait Investment Authority  has a 30
percent stake and  Saudi Arabia  owns a 12 percent holding,
according to Managing Director Mohamed El Mardi. Sudan is
Africa’s third-biggest sugar producer after  South Africa  and
Egypt, U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
