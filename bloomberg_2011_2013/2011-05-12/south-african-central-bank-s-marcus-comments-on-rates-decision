South African Reserve Bank Governor
Gill Marcus made the following comments after a meeting of the
bank’s monetary policy committee in  Pretoria  today.  “The acceleration in food price inflation is expected to
persist for some time despite indications that global food
prices may have peaked.  “The international oil price has also shown a remarkable
amount of volatility in the past week. It is unclear whether
prices will consolidate at current levels.  “The MPC continues to be of the view that the underlying
inflationary pressures are mainly of a cost-push nature.  “These developments are expected to result in a temporary
breach of the upper limit of the target band in the first
quarter of 2012.  “It is recognized that these pressure have the potential
to create second round effects which can result in more
generalized inflation.  “In light of the above, the MPC has decided to keep the
repo rate unchanged at 5.5 percent per annum for the time
being.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
