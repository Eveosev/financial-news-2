(Corrects to remove reference to fund’s status in first
paragraph.)  Rasmala Investment Bank Ltd. started
an equity fund to increase investor interest in the Palestinian
territories with a $15 million investment from the Palestine
Investment Fund.  The overall size of the fund may reach $100 million in the
next three years, Dubai-based Rasmala said yesterday in an e-
mailed statement. The fund is seeking more money from local and
foreign investors, the statement said.  The “Palestinian market is very attractive in terms of its
growth and return potential,” Eric Swats, head of asset
management at Rasmala, told reporters in Ramallah yesterday.  The Palestine Investment Fund, with $800 million in assets
under management, according to its  website , is the Palestinian
Authority’s primary vehicle for bringing foreign investment to
the  West Bank  and  Gaza Strip .  “The introduction of investment funds of this type to the
Palestine Securities Exchange will add depth and sophistication
to the Palestinian equity investments landscape,” Ahmed Oweida,
chief executive officer of the Palestine Securities Exchange,
said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story: Gwen Ackerman at
