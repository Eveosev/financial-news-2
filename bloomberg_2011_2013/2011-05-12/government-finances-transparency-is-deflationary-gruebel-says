UBS AG (UBSN)  Chief Executive Officer  Oswald Gruebel  said stricter capital requirements for banks and fiscal
austerity will hurt economic growth in developed economies in
the next 10 years.  “In 2019, you’ll have overly liquid, overly capitalized
banks,” Gruebel said in a panel discussion on global economic
power at a conference in  St. Gallen , Switzerland today. “On top
of that you have - through transparency we created in government
finances, especially in Europe - astonishing revelations, which
are not inflationary; they’re deflationary, substantially
deflationary.”  European governments from Ireland to Spain are cutting
spending in an attempt to cut budget deficits and counter the
region’s debt crisis on increasing concern that Greece will be
forced to default. Banks are facing a more than tripling of
 capital requirements  by 2019 and will need to hold more liquid
assets under new rules set by the  Basel Committee on Banking
Supervision  to make the financial system more stable.  “We cannot generate global growth with shrinking banks,
please believe me,” Gruebel, 67, said. “The good news is that
you’ll have low interest rates for the next 10 years to come.
The bad news is you won’t get a lot richer.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
