The cost of protecting bonds in Asia
and  Australia  from non-payment increased, according to traders
of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 50 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan rose 2 basis points to 106.5 basis
points as of 8:11 a.m. in Singapore, according to Credit
Agricole CIB.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index climbed 1.5 basis points
to 107 as of 10:11 a.m. in Sydney, Credit Agricole prices show.
The index is headed for its highest since April 19, according to
CMA prices in  New York .  The Markit iTraxx Japan index was little changed at 121
basis points as of 9:04 a.m. in Tokyo, according to Deutsche
Bank AG.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
