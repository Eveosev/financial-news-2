Cash premiums for corn shipped in May
to terminals near  New Orleans  rose relative to Chicago futures
as floods curb barge traffic on the lower Mississippi River. The
soybean basis was unchanged.  The spot-basis bid, or premium, for corn delivered this
month was 55 cents to 58 cents a bushel above July futures, up
from 54 cents to 57 cents yesterday, U.S. Department of
Agriculture  data  show. The soybean basis was 60 cents to 70
cents a bushel.  “You have virtually no farmer selling and limitations on
the mid-river around  Memphis , where barges can’t get through,”
said  Diana Klemme , a director at Grain Service Corp., a
consulting company and brokerage in Atlanta. “If someone needs
barges, they’ll have to pay up for something south of that
area.”  Corn futures for July delivery rose 3.25 cents, or 0.5
percent, to settle at $6.805 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the
Chicago Board of Trade. The most-active contract has surged 80
percent in the past year.  Soybean futures for July delivery gained 11 cents, or 0.8
percent, to $13.4275 a bushel on the CBOT. The price has climbed
39 percent in the past year.  The Coast Guard has restricted barge traffic on the
southern  Mississippi  River because of floods, and rail shipments
are facing delays of up to 36 hours as trains  reroute  around
swamped areas, according to a USDA report.  The Mississippi River crested in Memphis,  Tennessee ,
earlier this week at 47.87 feet, just under the record 48.7 feet
set in 1937. The flood may set more high-water marks before the
flow splits in  Louisiana , with 70 percent remaining in the
Mississippi’s channel and 30 percent running down the
Atchafalaya River.  To contact the reporter on this story:
