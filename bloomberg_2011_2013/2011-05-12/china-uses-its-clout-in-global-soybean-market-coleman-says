China , the world’s biggest soybean
importer “believes in using its clout in the market,”  Michael
Coleman , managing director at Aisling Analytics Pte, said at a
conference in  Singapore .  The nation knows that it has a structural deficit of
soybeans, Coleman said today. When prices are low, they get the
