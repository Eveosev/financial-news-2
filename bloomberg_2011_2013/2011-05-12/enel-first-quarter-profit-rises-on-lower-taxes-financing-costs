Enel SpA (ENEL) ,  Italy ’s biggest energy
company, said first-quarter profit rose more than expected as
reduced taxes and financing costs offset lower margins in Italy
and Spain.  Net profit increased to 1.2 billion euros ($1.7 billion) in
the quarter from 1.05 billion euros a year earlier, the Rome-
based company said today in a stock exchange statement. That
beat the 1.07 billion-euro estimate of fourteen analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg. Revenue rose 7.8 percent to 19.5 billion
euros.  The company, which became  Europe ’s most-indebted power
producer after the purchase of Spain’s  Endesa SA (ELE) , has cut costs
and sold assets to improve its finances. Net debt increased 1.4
percent to 45.6 billion euros at the end of the first quarter.
The company has a net debt reduction target of 36.5 billion
euros by 2015.  The results were achieved “within a particularly
challenging scenario, thanks mainly to our international
activities and to renewables,” Chief Executive Officer Fulvio Conti said in the statement. “This allows us to confirm out
targets for all of 2011.”  Conti said in March profit will rise 32 percent in the next
five years as sales in  Latin America , Eastern Europe and Russia
help compensate less profitable markets in Western Europe.  Enel said earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and
amortization fell 1.8 percent to 4.34 billion euros in the first
quarter on lower margins in Italy and at the company’s Iberia
and Latin America division.  To contact the reporter on this story:
