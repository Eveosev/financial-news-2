Global sugar stockpiles after this
year’s harvest will cover 16.6 percent of consumption, down for
a third year and leaving a “very thin buffer” against supply
disruptions, Natixis SA said.  Global output may increase 8.4 million metric tons to 161.9
million tons in the 2010-11 season while demand climbs 4 million
tons to 159 million tons, Natixis analyst Lysu Paez-Cortez wrote
in an e-mailed report today. Stockpiles have declined for two
years because of smaller crops, according to the  U.S. Department
of Agriculture .  “The bumper prospects expected for the current season may
still not be sufficient to take stocks back to comfortable
levels,” Paez-Cortex wrote said in the report.  Output in  Brazil , the world’s largest producer, may climb
3 million tons to 39.4 million tons, while exports rise 2.5
million tons to 26.9 million tons, Natixis said.  Sugar prices have dropped 34 percent this year and may
extend the decline if more exports are allowed from  India , the
second-biggest producer, the bank said. India has already
allowed 500,000 tons of exports this year.  Raw sugar for July delivery rose 0.24 cent, or 1.2 percent,
to 21.18 cents a pound on ICE Futures U.S. by 11:16 a.m. in  New
York . White, or refined, sugar for August delivery climbed
$2.90, or 0.5 percent, to $597.30 a ton on NYSE Liffe.  To contact the reporter on this story:
