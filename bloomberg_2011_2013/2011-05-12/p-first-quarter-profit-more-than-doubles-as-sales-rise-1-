MLP AG (MLP) ,  Germany â€™s third-biggest
financial-services broker, said profit in the first quarter more
than doubled as sales increased.  Net income climbed to 4.6 million euros ($6.5 million) from
2 million euros in the year-earlier period, the Wiesloch,
Germany-based company said in an e-mailed  statement  today.
Revenue gained 8 percent to 130.8 million euros.  MLP, led by Chief Executive Officer Uwe Schroeder-Wildberg,
last month said it expects one-time costs of 30 million euros
this year as it aims to invest in marketing and improve
efficiency to reduce its annual fixed costs by at least 30
million euros by the end of 2012. The number of consultants, an
indicator for future earnings, declined to 2,222 in the first
quarter from 2,273 at the end of last year.  The broker reiterated a target to raise earnings before
interest and tax to 15 percent of sales in 2012 from 9 percent
in 2010. Ebit more than doubled to 8.6 million euros in the
first quarter.  MLP shares have declined 12 percent this year, giving the
company a market value of about 725 million euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
