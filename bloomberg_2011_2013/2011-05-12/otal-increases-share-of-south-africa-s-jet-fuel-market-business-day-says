Total SA (FP)  increased its share of South
Africa’s 10 billion-rand jet-fuel market to about a third in the
past seven months, Business Day reported, citing Mark Leenaerts,
sales manager for aviation, bitumen and exports.  The company has obtained contracts to supply jet fuel at OR
Tambo International Airport, east of Johannesburg, to  Air
France-KLM (AF) , Martinair Holland NV, Qantas Airways Ltd., TAP SGPS
SA of Portugal and Royal Air Maroc since the middle of 2010, the
Johannesburg-based newspaper reported. OR Tambo consumes about
80 percent of South Africa’s jet fuel, which Total supplies to
the airport through a dedicated pipeline from the Natref
refinery in Secunda, it said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
