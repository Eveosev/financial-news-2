Our eyes are underrated innovation tools. It's easy to get caught up in a whirlwind of activities and miss opportunities that are literally right in front of your face. Make a regular habit of just standing and watching. You may be surprised by what you see. Here's how it worked for me recently. This Monday, I was in Mumbai conducting market research with a project team. A couple of my colleagues were interviewing a consumer on the street in a pretty well-to-do neighborhood. The interview was in Hindi and we didn't want to slow it down with simultaneous translation.  Instead of being a bored bystander, I started just looking around, watching for things that I found surprising. My eyes wandered to a small pharmacy shop. Over a 20 minute period, I jotted down the following observations:  These observations weren't closely connected with my client work, but they did help to provide local context and might ultimately spur thoughts about opportunities for innovation. In their 2009 award-winning  Harvard Business Review  article, " The Innovator's DNA " (soon to be a  book ), Jeffrey Dyer, Hal Gregersen, and Clayton Christensen discussed how successful innovators tend to be careful observers. "Discovery-driven executives produce uncommon business ideas by scrutinizing common phenomena, particularly the behavior of potential customers," they wrote. "In observing others, they act like anthropologists and social scientists." The moment when someone is choosing, purchasing, or using a product can be a great vehicle for learning. (But make sure you have something that allows you to easily capture notes. I jotted the list above down on a notepad and snapped a few pictures on my iPhone.) To sum up, remember some advice I learned from Innosight Director and noted author Richard Foster: "Don't just do something. Stand there."
