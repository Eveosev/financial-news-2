Teekay Corp. (TK) , owner of vessels that
haul oil and liquefied natural gas, said its first-quarter loss
widened to $29.7 million as tanker rates declined.  The net loss increased to 41 cents a share, from $14
million, or 19 cents, a year earlier ago, the Hamilton, Bermuda-
based company said in a statement today. Revenue fell 15 percent
to $488 million from a revised $571.4 million.  Shipping rates dropped as the number of  oil tankers  in
service rose to 2,147 in the week ended March 25, up 2.8 percent
from a year earlier, according to Lloyd’s List. Teekay
diversified its revenue sources by entering into liquefied-
natural-gas transportation and the offshore shuttle-tanker
market.  “Unlike the tanker market, the LNG market is really tight
at the moment,” said Wilhelm Gedde-Dahl, an analyst at Pareto
Securities ASA in Oslo. “The sentiment in the LNG industry is
going to benefit the stock price, probably.”  Teekay declined 65 cents, or 1.9 percent, to $33.65 in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares are up 1.7
percent this year.  Excluding interest-rate swaps and other items, Teekay
reported an adjusted loss of $27.9 million, or 39 cents,
compared with a loss of $3.9 million, or 5 cents. On that basis,
the loss estimated by seven analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was
42 cents a share.  Second Quarter  Teekay’s second-quarter revenue will fall $10 million from
the first quarter due to “seasonal maintenance” and
“increased dry-docking,” the company said on an earnings
conference call. Vessel operating expenses will increase $4
million to $6 million.  Revenue from LNG tankers rose to $92.8 million from $92.4
million, the company said. Revenue from the offshore shuttle-
tanker segment increased to $208.3 million from $198.6 million.  Teekay’s Suezmaxes earned an average spot rate of $18,671 a
day, down from $31,940 a day a year earlier. Aframaxes earned an
average daily spot rate of $16,299, down from $17,824.  Suezmax tankers can carry 876,000 to 1.46 million barrels
of oil, and Aframax vessels can move 547,500 to 876,000 barrels.  Suezmax rates averaged $21,424 a day in the  spot market  in
the first quarter, down from $33,586 a year earlier, according
to the London-based Baltic Exchange. Aframax rates averaged
$12,775 a day, down from $17,546.  To contact the reporter on this story:
