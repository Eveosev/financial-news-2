More than a third of Yemen’s usual
oil output of 270,000 barrels a day was shut in last month amid
unrest and fighting in the Middle East’s poorest nation, the
 International Energy Agency  said.  Yemen’s typical crude production remained reduced by at
least 100,000 barrels a day as a result of the instability, the
IEA said today in its monthly  Oil Market Report . Output is
likely to be curtailed “for some time,” the IEA said.  A labor strike was reported to have curbed output in Yemen
by an additional 70,000 barrels a day as of the time of the
writing of the report, according to the Paris-based agency.  “The situation remains volatile,” the IEA said.  Yemeni security forces fired on protesters in the capital,
Sana’a, killing at least eight people and injuring 50 others in
a crackdown that may wreck Gulf Arab efforts to broker a peace
accord. The plan calls for President Ali Abdullah Saleh to cede
power within a month of signing the agreement deal and be
granted immunity from prosecution.  Yemen is the ninth-largest oil producer in the Middle East,
according to data from BP Plc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
