dropped 4.6 percent from a year ago to 2.4 trillion pesos ($1.33

yesterday on the website of  Colombia ’s financial regulatory
agency.  Cementos Argos (CEMARGOS CB), Colombia’s biggest cement
maker, rose 0.2 percent to 10,820 pesos after buying assets with
an enterprise value of $760 million from Lafarge SA, the world’s
biggest cement producer, as the French company aims to regain an
investment-grade  credit rating .  Inversiones Argos SA (INVARGOS)  , the owner of Cementos
Argos, rose 1.1 percent to 18,500 pesos, its highest price in a
month.  Enka de Colombia SA (ENKA)  , a Medellin-based synthetic
fibers producer, rose 5.4 percent to 13.6 pesos, its most in two
months, after U.S. Secretary of State  Hillary Clinton  said
yesterday she sees “great progress” toward concluding free

percent to 2,415 pesos after Interbolsa SA, Colombia’s biggest
brokerage, recommended the stock as a “sell” and said it is
trading above the target price of 1,220 pesos for the end of
2011. The company could increase its power generation by 40
percent by 2014 with the 820-megawatt Hidrosogamoso plant,
Interbolsa said in an e-mailed report.  “Operating margins, low tax burden, low-cost debt and an
excellent corporate government, are elements that allow us to
have confidence in the company’s long-term operation.
Nevertheless, the current market price is not a good entrance
level.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
