Natural gas shipments scheduled for
delivery to U.S. power plants dropped for the first time in five
days as nuclear output increased, reducing demand for the power-
plant fuel.  A sample of scheduled shipments for U.S. electricity
generation fell 8.7 percent to 14.8 million dekatherms (14.5
billion cubic feet), according to data compiled by Bloomberg as
of 8:48 a.m. in New York.  Demand for residential use declined 7.1 percent to 23.1
million dekatherms.  U.S. nuclear-power output increased 946 megawatts, or 1.3
percent, to 76,528 megawatts, the highest level since April 13,
according to the  Nuclear Regulatory Commission  and Bloomberg
data. The total was 75 percent of capacity, the data showed.  NextEra Energy Inc. (NEE)  boosted the 839-megawatt Saint Lucie 2
reactor in Florida to 84 percent of capacity from 67 percent
yesterday. Another reactor at the plant, the 839-megawatt Saint
Lucie 1, is operating at 91 percent of capacity.  Gas deliveries to Florida power plants were scheduled to
drop for the first time in six days, falling 3.4 percent to 3.35
million dekatherms.  Wholesale gas for next-day delivery at Florida Gas
Transmission Zone 3 gained 9.49 cents to $4.342 per million
British thermal units yesterday on the Intercontinental
Exchange.  The high temperature in Tallahassee, Florida, may be 94
degrees Fahrenheit (34 Celsius) today, 8 degrees above normal,
according to  Weather Underground  in  Ann Arbor , Michigan.  Gas at the  Henry Hub  in Erath, Louisiana, the delivery
point for futures traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange ,
rose 4.22 cents yesterday to $4.2323 per million Btu.  To contact the reporter on this story:
