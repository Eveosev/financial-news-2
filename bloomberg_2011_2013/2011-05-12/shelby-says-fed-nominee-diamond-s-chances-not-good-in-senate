Federal Reserve Board nominee  Peter Diamond ’s chances at getting a vote by the full Senate are “not
good” after the Banking Committee advanced his candidacy for
the third time, the panel’s senior Republican said.  Senator  Richard Shelby  of  Alabama  said in an interview today
in  Washington  that he knows of no Republican who supports
Diamond. The unity by all 10 Republican members of the committee
in opposing Diamond today sends a “strong message” to other
Republican senators, Shelby said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
