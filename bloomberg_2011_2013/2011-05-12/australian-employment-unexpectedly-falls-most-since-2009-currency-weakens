Australian employers unexpectedly cut
workers in April by the most since 2009 as hiring weakens in
states less affected by the nation’s mining boom, sending the
local currency tumbling and stocks lower.  The number of people employed declined by 22,100, after a
revised 43,300 gain in March, the statistics bureau said in
Sydney today. Economists in a Bloomberg News survey forecast a
17,000 increase in April, according to the median of 21
estimates. The jobless rate held at 4.9 percent.  The Australian dollar fell as much as 1.1 percent, two-year
bond yields declined and the nation’s benchmark stock index sank
as investors trimmed bets the  Reserve Bank  of Australia will
raise borrowing costs next month. The RBA has held its benchmark
interest rate at a developed-world high of 4.75 percent since
November, prompting a decline in sales at stores including  Myer
Holdings Ltd. (MYR)   “Consumers are more cautious since the global financial
crisis and that’s feeding through to employment,” said Riki Polygenis, a senior economist at Australia & New Zealand Banking
Group Ltd. in  Melbourne , whose forecast for a 5,000-job drop was
one of only two declines in the survey. “The mining sector is a
very small employer compared with manufacturing and retail,
which are struggling in the current environment.”  Full-Time Cuts  The number of full-time jobs declined by 49,100 in April,
the most since February 2009, and part-time employment rose by
26,900, today’s report showed.  Australia ’s participation rate,
which measures the  labor force  as a percentage of the population
over 15 years old, fell to 65.6 percent in April from 65.8
percent a month earlier, it showed.  Last month’s decline in jobs brings to 26,300 the number of
net new positions created in the first four months of the year,
the weakest January-through-April period of employment growth
number since 1999.  The yield on two-year government notes dropped 8 basis
points, or 0.08 percentage point, to 4.98 percent, the biggest
decline since April 19. The Australian dollar slid 0.6 percent
to $1.0634 at 1:28 p.m. in Sydney. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index
dropped as much as 1.6 percent to 4,703.10.  Asian Demand  Today’s report reflects surging Asian demand that is
stoking investment in resource projects and helped send the
currency this month to the highest level since it was floated in
1983.  A government report released last week showed retail sales
unexpectedly fell 0.5 percent in March, the first decline in
five months, and sales adjusted to remove inflation were
unchanged in the three months through March 31 from the previous
quarter.  Employment rose 22,900 in Queensland and  Western Australia ,
states that are the biggest participants in the largest mining-
investment boom in the country’s history. The number of jobs in
New South  Wales  and Victoria, home to Australia’s two most
populous cities, dropped by 56,200, today’s report showed.  “There are clear signs that the Aussie economy is losing
momentum,” Savanth Sebastian, an economist at  Commonwealth Bank
of Australia  in Sydney, wrote in a report after the release.
“The latest result is also consistent with the anecdotal
evidence we are hearing from businesses outside the mining
sector.”  Myer and  David Jones Ltd. (DJS) , Australia’s biggest department
store chains, yesterday reported declines in quarterly sales.  Falling Sales  Melbourne-based Myer’s sales fell 2 percent to A$657
million ($698 million) in the three months ended April 30, and
Sydney-based  David Jones , the second-largest chain, posted a 1.4
percent drop in revenue to A$411.7 million in the same period.
Both companies were reporting third-quarter results.  Traders bet there’s a 10 percent chance central bank
Governor Glenn Stevens will boost rates by a quarter of a
percentage point to 5 percent next month, down from 24 percent
before the jobs report, bank bill futures showed.  Australia’s government said this week that it will end 23
years of spending growth to ease inflation from the mining boom
and support the return to a  budget surplus .  Prime Minister  Julia Gillard ’s administration is trying to
reduce the need for higher borrowing costs for consumers and
businesses after the central bank said last week that higher
rates will likely be needed “at some point” to contain
inflation.  The RBA has increased rates by 175 basis points to 4.75
percent since October 2009. In contrast, the U.S. Federal
Reserve has held its benchmark rate near zero since December
2008. That divergence contributed to about a 19 percent increase
in the local dollar versus the U.S. currency in the past 12
months.  The RBA said in its May 6 quarterly policy statement that
“most leading indicators point to further growth in employment
over the months ahead, although at a slower pace than in 2010.”
It also predicted the jobless rate would fall to 4.25 percent by
December 2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
