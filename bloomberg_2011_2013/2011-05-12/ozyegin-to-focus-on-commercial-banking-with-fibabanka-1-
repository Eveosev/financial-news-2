Turkish billionaire Husnu Ozyegin will focus on commercial banking and lending to
small and medium-sized businesses with  Fibabanka , now
renamed from Millennium Bank after he acquired the lender
from Banco Comercial Portugues SA in December.  Fibabanka had loans of $1.2 billion and assets of $1.5
billion at the end of April, chief executive officer Bekir Dildar said at a news conference in Istanbul today. The
bank has 20 branches, he said.  Ozyegin owns Amsterdam-based Credit Europe Bank NV,
which controls Fibabanka and operates in countries
including Russia and  Romania .  To contact the reporter on this story:
