Old Mutual Plc (OML) , the third-biggest
insurer in the U.K. by market value, said sales declined 4
percent in the first quarter, led by a drop in  Italy .  Sales on a so-called annual premium equivalent basis fell
to 369 million pounds ($603 million) in the first quarter, the
London-based firm said in a statement today. Assets under
management climbed 1 percent to 303.1 billion pounds.  The insurer’s long-term savings division had positive net
client cash flow of 900 million pounds, “driven by strong
retail flows and flows in our non-South African emerging markets
businesses,” Old Mutual said.  Old Mutual, Africa’s largest insurer, said last year it may
sell shares in its U.S. asset management business and dispose of
its stake in  South Africa ’s  Nedbank Group Ltd. (NED)  under a plan to
cut 1.5 billion pounds of debt by 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
