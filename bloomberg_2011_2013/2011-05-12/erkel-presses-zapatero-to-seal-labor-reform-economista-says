German Chancellor  Angela Merkel 
called her Spanish counterpart Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero
Tuesday to urge him to seal changes to the country’s labor laws
to boost economic growth, El Economista said.   Merkel’s call prompted the Spanish prime minister to cancel
a planned trip to Oslo and call an emergency meeting of business
and union leaders to push forward negotiations on changes to
collective bargaining rules, the newspaper said, citing people
involved in the talks without naming them.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
