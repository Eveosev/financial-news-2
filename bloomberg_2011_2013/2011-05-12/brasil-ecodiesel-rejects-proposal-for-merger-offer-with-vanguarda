Brasil Ecodiesel Industria & Comercio
de Biocombustiveis & Oleos Vegetais SA,  Brazil ’s fourth-largest
biodiesel producer, rejected a proposal to merge with Vanguarda
do Brasil SA, derailing a plan to create a 2.16 billion-real
($1.3 billion) company.  The board chose not to approve the plan, Brasil Ecodiesel
said in a regulatory filing today, without elaborating. The
companies were in merger talks and Vanguarda’s controlling
shareholder, Brazilian farmer Otaviano Pivetta, planned to take
a 32 percent stake in the combined entity, Brasil Ecodiesel
controller Veremonte Participacoes SA said on April 18.  An official at MVL Comunicacao, a third-party
communications company that represents Veremonte, wasn’t
immediately able to give further information on the decision.
Veremonte is a holding company of Spanish billionaire Enrique
Banuelos.  Brasil Ecodiesel fell 1.3 percent to 77 centavos in Sao
Paulo trading at 10:14 a.m. New York time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
