Serbia is temporarily cutting payroll
taxes for employers who create jobs in an effort to reduce a 20
percent unemployment rate and crack down on illegal workers.  For the next year, companies won’t have to make payments to
the state pension fund on behalf of new hires and the employer’s
share of income taxes for those workers will be reduced, Prime
Minister  Mirko Cvetkovic  told reporters today in Belgrade.  “Starting next week it will be much cheaper for employers
to hire people or to register with the authorities those already
working but unreported,” Cvetkovic said.  The government is seeking to boost employment and living
standards less than a year before parliamentary elections.
Economy Minister Nebojsa Ciric said the package of incentives is
designed to reverse a decline in employment as there were 92,000
fewer jobs in January than a year ago. The national workforce is
just under 1.8 million.  The incentives won’t reduce budget revenue, Cvetkovic said.  “The state can only gain from this,” the prime minister
said. “It will help reduce the gray economy” as some employers
“legalize” workers who are currently unreported, he said.  An International Monetary Fund delegation is scheduled to
arrive in Belgrade next week to discuss a new, precautionary
arrangement with the Balkan country. Serbia completed a 3
billion-euro ($4.3 billion) IMF bailout under which it must keep
its 2011  budget deficit  under 4.1 percent of gross domestic
product.  To contact the reporter on this story:
