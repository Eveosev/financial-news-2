Four major U.S. cities that pay for
the upkeep of foreclosed properties are trying to recoup the
costs of services including lawn mowing, repairs and security by
suing banks they claim contributed to their “urban blight.”  A federal judge in Memphis, Tennessee, on May 4 and another
in Baltimore on April 22 denied  Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC) ’s request to
dismiss the predatory-lending lawsuits brought against the bank.
A lawsuit by the city of Cleveland against  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) 
and Ally Financial Inc. is also pending before an Ohio judge.  In one case, Deutsche Bank AG, described by  Los Angeles 
City Attorney Carmen Trutanich as one of the city’s “major
slumlords,” may be found liable for hundreds of millions of
dollars, including restitution for current and former tenants,
according to a statement by the city.  “We started out looking to sue as many as 16 lenders,”
Webb Brewer, a lawyer who represents Memphis, said in a
telephone interview. “It’s a tall order to fight all those
banks at once. We never alleged that Wells Fargo was alone in
employing these practices.”  The cities’ lawsuits invoke various legal theories, and
some have targeted the banks as bundlers of mortgages into
securities rather than as lenders. The cases brought by
Baltimore and  Memphis , which will now shift to pre-trial
evidence gathering, are similar. They both accuse San Francisco-
based Wells Fargo of violating the Fair Housing Act by so-called
reverse redlining -- targeting black neighborhoods for predatory
lending.  Buildings in Disrepair  Los Angeles sued Deutsche Bank May 4 as trustee of
mortgage-backed securities and is seeking reimbursement for
costs of property repair. The city accused the bank of buying
more than 2,200 properties through foreclosure and letting
vacant buildings fall into disrepair. The day before, the U.S.
government alleged in a lawsuit seeking $1 billion that the
Frankfurt-based bank lied to qualify thousands of risky
mortgages for a government insurance program.  Renee Calabro , a spokeswoman for Deutsche Bank, said the
day the Los Angeles complaint was filed that it’s “against the
wrong party” because loan servicers, rather than trustees, are
responsible for maintenance of foreclosed properties. She said
May 3 the U.S. suit was “unreasonable and unfair” and the bank
would fight it.  “Obviously the cities face significant hurdles in proving
the chain of causation from predatory mortgage lending to
foreclosures, abandonment and urban blight,”  Alan White , a law
professor at Valparaiso University in  Indiana , said in an e-mail
about the Baltimore and Memphis cases. “Still, these cases may
result in financial institutions having some accountability for
the devastation caused by the crisis, accountability that has
been in short supply to date.”  Subprime Loans  Baltimore and Memphis claim Wells Fargo approved
unqualified black borrowers to refinance their mortgages or take
out home-equity loans, and steered other black borrowers who
qualified for prime loans into subprime loans. Subprime loans,
made to borrowers with poor credit ratings, have higher interest
payments and also higher fees for the lenders.  Those practices caused foreclosures and abandonment of
properties, which injured the areas through higher spending on
services and lower  tax revenue , the municipalities said. Both
cases include sworn statements from former Wells Fargo employees
who said the bank targeted black neighborhoods for predatory
lending.  Shelby County, of which Memphis is the county seat, is also
a plaintiff in the  Tennessee  case.  Serving Customers  “We disagree with both rulings,” Vickee Adams, a Wells
Fargo spokeswoman, said in a telephone interview. “We know that
our team members make loan decisions based on credit and
transaction risk, and that we serve all of our customers without
bias. We lend with the overarching goal of approving
applications when the customer has the ability to repay the
loan.” She said the bank will fight the lawsuits.  U.S. District Judge J. Frederick Motz in Baltimore had
dismissed two earlier complaints by Baltimore, allowing the city
to amend them to fix what he saw as defects. The case is now
focused on properties Baltimore claims are vacant only because
of Wells Fargo’s alleged predatory lending.  “The city provides an in-depth explanation of how
targeting homeowners with predatory refinance and home-equity
loans of the type allegedly made by Wells Fargo can create
vacancies in homes that would otherwise be occupied,” Motz
wrote in his April 22 decision.  Vacant Properties  In deciding dismissal motions, judges rule on the legal
sufficiency, not the merits, of the allegations. Once a case
survives a motion to dismiss, the plaintiffs may demand the
exchange of evidence from defendants in the “discovery” phase.  Baltimore identified 190 vacant Wells Fargo properties
where it had to provide services such as “inspecting, boarding,
cleaning, cutting grass and weeds, prosecuting, condemning,
sending fire personnel, sending police personnel and more.”  The complaint includes accusations by Baltimore residents
of squatters occupying vacant homes, firefighters coming to put
out fires and one child being taken to the hospital because of
being bitten by a rat.  In upholding the Fair Housing Act complaint against Wells
Fargo in Tennessee, U.S. District Judge S. Thomas Anderson in
Memphis didn’t limit the case to vacant homes. The complaint
also included a claim under the state’s consumer-protection law.  Wells Fargo’s foreclosure rates in targeted black
neighborhoods of both Memphis and Shelby County are almost 18
percent -- five times the rate in predominantly white city
neighborhoods and seven times in predominantly white county
neighborhoods, according to court papers. Those figures are much
higher than that of other lenders, according to the plaintiffs.  Not Savvy Enough  “The prevailing attitude was that African-American
customers weren’t savvy enough to know they were getting a bad
loan, so we would have a better chance of convincing them to
apply for a high-cost, subprime loan,” according to a sworn
statement by Mario Taylor, a former Wells Fargo credit officer.  Wells Fargo said in court papers that, of the 50 properties
listed in the complaint, it made loans for and foreclosed on
only 30 in what the plaintiffs said were predominantly black
neighborhoods, and 20 of those were “made to borrowers believed
to be investors.” The defaults on the remaining 10 were due to
“circumstances such as curtailment of income, medical problems
and structural problems at the property.”  Cleveland’s suit, in Ohio state court in that city, focuses
on financial companies’ securitization of house loans. It sued
units of New York-based JPMorgan and Detroit-based  Ally
Financial , arguing they should pay for the costs the city
incurred as a result of foreclosures that stemmed from their
bundling of subprime mortgages into securities.  Economic Plight  The banks “knew or should have known” that the subprime
lending “would inevitably result in mass foreclosures, given
the city’s unique economic plight,” Cleveland’s lawyers wrote
in court papers.  The city also alleged that the financial companies’
“filing of sham foreclosure complaints” violated the state’s
racketeering statute and that JPMorgan and Ally owe it money
under a state law allowing cities to recoup from owners the
costs of demolishing vacant buildings.  Birmingham,  Alabama  lost a case it brought and Buffalo,  New
York , lost its suit for the most part. Cleveland has lost a
companion case in federal court.  On March 21, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear
Cleveland’s appeal of the dismissal of its lawsuit against 22
financial companies, including New York-based  Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. (GS)  and  Citigroup Inc. (C) , and  Charlotte , North Carolina-
based  Bank of America Corp. (BAC) , that bundled subprime mortgages
into securities.  Public-Nuisance Claim  U.S. District Judge Sara Lioi in Cleveland ruled in 2009
that the funding of subprime lending couldn’t form the basis of
Cleveland’s public-nuisance claim because such lending is legal
and that state law forbids municipalities from regulating
mortgages.  “We respectfully disagreed with the court’s interpretation
of Ohio law,” Joshua Cohen, a lawyer for the city at Cohen
Rosenthal & Kramer LLP in Cleveland, said in a telephone
interview. “We’re hoping the state-court judge will see it
differently.”  Court of Common Pleas Judge Brian J. Corrigan in Cleveland
has yet to rule on the financial company’s request to dismiss
the case.  “The claims brought in this case are based on the same
theories that have been rejected” in the federal case, Jim Olecki, a spokesman for Ally Financial, said in an e-mail. The
company is “optimistic that the state court will take these
prior rulings into consideration as it makes its decision.”  Thomas Kelly , a spokesman for JPMorgan, declined to
comment.  ‘Tenuously Connected’  Like Cleveland’s case in federal court, Birmingham’s Fair
Housing Act suit against Citigroup and Bank of America’s
Countrywide Financial unit was dismissed early in the
litigation. In August 2009, U.S. District Judge Karon Owen Bowdre in Birmingham found the city’s alleged injuries were
“too tenuously connected” to the conduct alleged.  The Birmingham complaint was similar to those of Baltimore
and Memphis.  Most of the 36 financial companies Buffalo sued for public
nuisance in 2008, including Citigroup and Bank of America, were
dismissed from the case under an order of summary judgment,
Marco Cercone, a lawyer for several defendants in the case, said
in a telephone interview. The summary judgment could not
immediately be confirmed in court filings.  ‘Handful’ Settled  A “handful” settled, Cercone said. Cercone, a partner at
Rupp, Baase, Pfalzgraf, Cunningham & Coppola LLC in Buffalo,
declined to name them or his clients.  Shirley Norton , a Bank of
America spokeswoman, and  Mark Rodgers , a Citigroup spokesman,
confirmed their companies won against Buffalo without the need
of a trial.  Buffalo Acting Corporation Counsel David Rodriguez didn’t
return calls seeking comment. Mike DeGeorge, spokesman for
Buffalo Mayor Byron Brown, declined to immediately comment.  The cases are People of the State of California and the
