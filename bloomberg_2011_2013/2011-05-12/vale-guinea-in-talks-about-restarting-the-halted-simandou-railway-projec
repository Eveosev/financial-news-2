Vale SA (VALE5)  and Guinea are in talks about
technical aspects of a 662-kilometer (411-mile) railway project
that was halted by the West African nation’s government, said
Ricardo Saad, Vale’s project manager at the Simandou mine.  “The government wants to discuss with us certain parameters
and we wish to have a solution very soon,” Saad said in an
interview in Conakry, the capital, yesterday. He declined to
provide details of the talks.  Guinea’s president,  Alpha Conde , halted the rebuilding of
the railway between Conakry and the city of Kankan on April 17,
saying he disapproved of Portugal-based Zagope carrying out the
work.  On Feb. 22, Vale said it planned to invest more than $1
billion in the railroad, which would be in operation by 2013 or
2014.  To contact the reporter on this story:
