The northeastern Kenyan districts of
Isiolo, Moyale and Marsabit are facing a “rainfall deficit”
after getting just 10 percent of the average precipitation for
March, April and May, according to the Famine Early Warning
Systems Network.  Shortages have also affected  Kenya ’s southeastern
districts,  said  the network known as Fewsnet, which gets funding
from the U.S. Agency for International Development.  Fewsnet said there was a possibility of flooding in the
Lake Victoria basin because of “significant amounts of rain”
in Uganda, Rwanda and Burundi.  To contact the reporter on this story:
