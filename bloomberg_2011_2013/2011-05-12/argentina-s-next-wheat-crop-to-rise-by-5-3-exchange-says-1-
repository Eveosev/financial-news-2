Argentina ’s wheat crop, the biggest
in  South America , will be 5.3 percent larger in the 2011-2012
season, the  Buenos Aires  Cereals Exchange said in its first
forecast of the year.  Planting of the 2011-2012 season, which started this month,
will cover 4.95 million hectares (12.2 million acres), up from
4.7 million planted last year, the exchange said today in its
weekly crop report by e-mail. Planting ends in September.
Harvesting takes place between October and January.  The wheat season starts with good prospects after
“generous rains in April and the early part of the current
month,” the exchange said. Argentine farmers last year produced
15.7 million tons of wheat, boosted by record yields.  Argentina will become the world’s fifth-largest exporter of
wheat in the year through June 30, according to estimates by the
 U.S. Department of Agriculture . Argentina was the eighth-largest
wheat exporter the previous year.  Wheat dropped 15.5 cents, or 2.04 percent, to $7.435 a
bushel at 12:20 p.m. on the Chicago Board of Trade. The grain
has risen 52 percent over the past year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
