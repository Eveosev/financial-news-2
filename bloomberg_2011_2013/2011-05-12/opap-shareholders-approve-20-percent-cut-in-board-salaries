Opap SA (OPAP) ,  Europe ’s biggest listed
gambling company, will cut board members’ salaries by 20 percent
this year on the suggestion of its biggest shareholder, the
Greek state.  Greek Finance Minister  George Papaconstantinou  sent a
letter to companies in which the government holds stakes late
last year, asking them to reduce wage costs. The Greek state
owns 34 percent of Opap, which has the monopoly on Greek sports-
betting until 2020.  Shareholders approved salary cuts of 20 percent for members
of the executive board at a meeting yesterday, the Athens-based
company said in a statement posted on its website today.  Payroll costs amounted to about 1 percent of Opap’s
revenue, which was 5.14 billion euros ($7.29 billion) in 2010,
Chief Executive Officer Ioannis Spanoudakis said in a Bloomberg
interview on May 4.  To contact the reporter on this story
