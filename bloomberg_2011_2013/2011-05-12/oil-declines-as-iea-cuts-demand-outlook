Crude oil rose as U.S. equities
increased and the dollar dropped against the euro, bolstering
the appeal of raw materials to investors.  Futures climbed 0.8 percent after the Standard and Poor’s
500 Index advanced, led by a gain in commodity companies. The
U.S. currency slipped from the highest level versus the euro
since April 1. Oil retreated earlier when the  International
Energy Agency  cut its global demand estimate for this year by
190,000 barrels a day, or 0.2 percent.  “Oil climbed as the S&P 500 rebounded,” said  Tim Evans ,
an energy analyst at Citi Futures Perspective in New York. “The
correlation between the two is alive and well. Investors look at
the S&P as a sign of where the economy is going.”  Crude oil for June delivery increased 76 cents to settle at
$98.97 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . The
contract dropped as much as 3 percent and climbed 2.3 percent
today. Prices are up 31 percent from a year ago.  Brent oil for June settlement increased 41 cents, or 0.4
percent, to end the session at $112.98 a barrel on the London-
based ICE Futures Europe exchange.  Oil volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was 851,811
contracts as of 3:20 p.m. in  New York . Volume totaled 1.02
million yesterday, 40 percent above the average of the past
three months. Open interest climbed to a record 1.664 million
contracts.  “Open interest increases along with volatility,” said
 Michael Lynch , president of Strategic Energy & Economic Research
in Winchester, Massachusetts. “It’s a sign that this is a hot
market and investors are expecting movement. Up or down it
really doesn’t matter, they plan to profit from the moves.”  Stock Market Gains  The  S&P 500 Index (SPX)  increased 0.5 percent to 1,348.08 at 3:20
p.m. after dropping as much as 0.8 percent to 1,332.03. The  Dow
Jones Industrial Average  gained 0.5 percent to 12,695.12 after a
0.7 percent loss earlier today.  The dollar fell 0.3 percent against the euro to $1.4237
after increasing to $1.4124 earlier today.  Oil tumbled 15 percent last week, the biggest decline in
two years, following the death of  Osama bin Laden  and a 3.4
percent gain in the U.S. currency.  “The dollar took a hit again today,” said  John Kilduff , a
partner at Again Capital LLC, a New York-based hedge fund that
focuses on energy. “After such a big selloff as we’ve seen, the
market is vulnerable to a bounce.”  Citigroup today revised down its three-month  Brent crude 
forecast to $110 a barrel and for West Texas Intermediate, the
grade traded in New York, to $100.  ‘Renewed Concerns’  “Renewed concerns about U.S. growth, rising U.S. crude oil
inventories and stretched speculative long positioning support
our revisions,” a team led by London-based Guillermo Felices
wrote in a report today.  U.S. crude oil inventories rose 3.78 million barrels to
370.3 million last week, the highest level since May 2009, an
Energy Department report showed yesterday. Gasoline stockpiles
unexpectedly increased 1.28 million barrels to 205.8 million,
the first gain in 12 weeks.  Gasoline demand fell 1.3 percent to 8.83 million a day last
week, the lowest level since the seven days ended February 11,
according to the department.  Fuel demand in  North America  will decline this year by
190,000 barrels to 23.7 million a day, the Paris-based IEA said.
The agency lowered its forecast for the region by 220,000
barrels a day from last month’s report, citing lower growth
projections from the  International Monetary Fund .  High Pump Prices  “High gasoline prices are scaring off some incremental
demand,” said  Rick Mueller , a principal with ESAI Energy, LLC
in Wakefield,  Massachusetts . “We’re going to see people
conserve more and cut down on trips.”  Gasoline declined for a second day on falling demand,
rising stockpiles and speculation refineries will escape damage
from the swollen  Mississippi River . The fuel surged 6.1 percent
on May 9, the most since July 2009, on concern production and
distribution would be crippled by the flood.  “A refinery catastrophe got priced into the gasoline
market prematurely,” Kilduff said. “The gains are now being
given back.”  Gasoline for June delivery dropped 5.89 cents, or 1.9
percent, to settle at $3.0639 a gallon in New York. Yesterday,
the fuel decreased 7.6 percent, the biggest single-session fall
since Feb. 17, 2009.  Regular gasoline at the pump, averaged nationwide, rose 2.2
cents to $3.984 a gallon yesterday, AAA said on its website. The
price climbed to $3.985 on May 4, the highest level since July
24, 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
