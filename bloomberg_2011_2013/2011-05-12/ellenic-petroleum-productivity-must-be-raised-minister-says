Employees at  Hellenic Petroleum SA (ELPE) ,
 Greece ’s largest refiner, work fewer hours and earn more money
than staffers at competing refineries in Greece and in western
 Europe , Deputy Energy Minister Yiannis Maniatis said.  The company’s employees work 19 percent and 8 percent fewer
hours respectively than workers at other oil refiners in Greece
and western Europe, Maniatis told lawmakers in Athens today
according to an e-mailed transcript of his remarks from the
 Environment, Energy and Climate Change Ministry .  Hellenic Petroleum wages are from 13 percent to 49 percent
higher than salaries earned at German and Dutch refineries and
48 percent to 62 percent more than wage levels at Italian and
Spanish refineries, he said.  An average yearly salary at the company in 2009 was 65,538
euros ($92,800) which rises to 85,424 euros after employer
contributions and medical and social benefits are included,
according to Maniatis.  Productivity must be raised to a level necessary to ensure
competitiveness with similar companies in Greece and abroad
given adverse market conditions that have hit sales, he said.  A Greek court ruled illegal on May 5 a 10-day strike
planned by workers at Hellenic Petroleum after talks with
management on a new labor agreement and staffing levels failed.  Greece has a combined direct and indirect stake of just
under 35.5 percent in Hellenic Petroleum, according to Bloomberg
data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
