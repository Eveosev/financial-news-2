Egypt has requested financial
assistance from the  International Monetary Fund , an IMF
spokeswoman said, as the country turns to bilateral and
multilateral donors to meet up to $12 billion in financing needs
through June 2012.  “There has now been an official request,” IMF director of
external relations  Caroline Atkinson  told reporters in
Washington today. “We expect that an IMF team will visit Cairo
shortly to begin the discussions with the Egyptian authorities
on an arrangement.”  While Atkinson didn’t say how much money Egypt is asking
from the Washington-based lender, the country’s finance minister
Samir Radwan said April 18 the country needs between $3 billion
and $4 billion from the IMF for the remainder of the current
fiscal year through June and the following 12 months, according
to state-run Middle East News Agency.  To contact the reporter on this story:
