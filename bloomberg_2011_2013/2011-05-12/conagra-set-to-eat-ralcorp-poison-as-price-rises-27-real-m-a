Traders have never been more
confident they can secure a higher offer from  ConAgra Foods Inc. (CAG) 
in its attempt to take over  Ralcorp Holdings Inc. (RAH) , the biggest
U.S. maker of store-brand foods.  Ralcorp, which has increased by more than $1 billion in
value in the past two weeks on takeover speculation, climbed 5.2
percent above ConAgra’s unsolicited all-cash proposal of $86 a
share. The gap is the widest since the Omaha, Nebraska-based
maker of Chef Boyardee pasta and  Slim Jim  meat sticks raised its
original offer last week, indicating that merger arbitragers are
betting ConAgra will be forced to boost its  $4.9 billion bid ,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  While Ralcorp has spurned both of ConAgra’s offers and
adopted a “poison pill” strategy to prevent hostile takeovers,
ConAgra Chief Executive Officer Gary Rodkin signaled that he
intends to take his proposal directly to shareholders. Buying
St. Louis-based Ralcorp would hand Rodkin, who has rewarded
owners with a gain of less than 4 percent since becoming CEO in
2005, control of a company that almost tripled its profit in the
past five years. Ralcorp may be worth $104 a share, 27 percent
more than ConAgra’s initial bid, BMO Capital Markets said.  “It seems ConAgra wants it pretty badly,” said  Sachin Shah , a special situations and merger arbitrage strategist at
Capstone Global Markets LLC in  New York . “It’s trading above
the offer, so people’s perception is that there is going to be a
higher offer. People feel pretty comfortable that ConAgra is
going to go the distance.”  Equity Value  Teresa Paulsen, a spokeswoman for ConAgra, declined to
comment. Ralcorp’s Matt Pudlowski didn’t return a telephone call
seeking comment.  Shares of Ralcorp closed at $90.49 on May 11, the highest
level since 1997. Ralcorp as it exists today was created that
year after selling some businesses to  General Mills Inc. (GIS) 
Ralcorp’s equity value has risen 27 percent to $5 billion since
April 29, when the shares jumped on takeover speculation.  The $4.49 gap between Ralcorp’s price on May 11 and
ConAgra’s offer was the biggest since the bid was announced on
May 4. ConAgra boosted the price after saying Ralcorp rejected
its March proposal for $82 in cash and stock. Ralcorp turned
down ConAgra a second time, saying the latest offer was “not in
the best interests of shareholders.”  To defend itself, Ralcorp enacted a shareholder rights plan
to fend off unwanted suitors. ConAgra countered by saying two
days later that it hired proxy solicitor Innisfree, a sign that
Rodkin may pursue a hostile takeover.  ‘Two Dogs’  “We’ve heard high $90s would make them happy, but of
course they’ll want to grab every bit of market cap for
themselves and their current shareholders,” said Michael Vogelzang, chief investment officer at Boston Advisors LLC,
which manages $1.8 billion and owned ConAgra and Ralcorp shares
as of March. “That’s the dog bone between the two dogs.”  A deal may help boost ConAgra’s shares. Since Rodkin became
CEO on Oct. 1, 2005, ConAgra has gained 3.1 percent, versus a 38
percent advance for consumer staples stocks in the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index. ConAgra returned 27 percent with dividends,
less than half the total for its rivals in the same span.  Buying Ralcorp, which generated about $3 billion last year
selling foods under retailers’ own brands, would help Rodkin
almost quadruple private-label sales. He would also get Post
cereals, which accounted for a quarter of Ralcorp’s revenue.  A total of $88.5 billion in store-brand products were sold
last year, 1.8 percent more than 2009, according to the Private
Label Manufacturers Association, a New York-based industry
group. Sales of name-brand goods fell 1.1 percent.  Brand-Name Competition  The acquisition would lead to about $250 million in annual
cost savings by the third year after closing, ConAgra said. It’s
also “confident” the deal will improve its sales and earnings
growth rates. Without Ralcorp, ConAgra’s sales will increase 2
percent this year, while revenue at Ralcorp is projected to rise
17 percent, analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg show.  Earnings at Ralcorp may also grow faster than ConAgra this
year, as ConAgra faces competition from more popular brand-name
products such as Pittsburgh-based H.J. Heinz Co.’s ketchup,
which contends with ConAgra’s Hunt’s line.  “They are eager to try to grow their business and they’ve
had trouble doing that,” said  Jack Russo , a St. Louis-based
analyst at  Edward Jones . “ConAgra’s brands are not first-tier
brands. Perhaps they just felt like they were never going to be
a premier branded-foods company and so maybe this change of
direction and change of course was a right move for them.”  Credit Ratings  Including net debt, ConAgra’s offer is valued at about $7
billion, or 10.6 times Ralcorp’s $662 million of earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization in the 12 months
ended December, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Takeovers of
food companies greater than $500 million in the last five years
were valued at a median of 11 times Ebitda.  Dave Novosel , a credit analyst at Gimme Credit LLC in
 Chicago , says that Rodkin’s goal to maintain ConAgra’s
investment-grade rating may constrain his ability to increase
the per-share offer of $86 without adding stock.  The company is rated Baa2 by Moody’s Investors Service, and
BBB by both S&P and Fitch Ratings, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The ratings are two levels above junk.  “Even with the existing offer ConAgra is borderline
between investment grade and non-investment grade,” Novosel
said. “ConAgra would be in danger of losing investment grade.
If ConAgra makes a higher offer and it is cash, then their
chances of going non-investment grade are even higher.”  If ConAgra wants to close the deal for Ralcorp, it may
still need to boost its price, according Scott Rostan, a former
M&A banker at Merrill Lynch & Co. and president of Training The
Street, which trains new hires at firms from Zurich-based Credit
Suisse Group AG to  Blackstone Group LP (BX)  of New York.  “Ralcorp is taking a ‘just say no’ defense tactic and
initiated a poison pill,” he said. “They’re digging their
heels in. The market is making a bet that there’s going to be a
bump and that either another bidder will come in and raise the
price or that ConAgra will be forced to raise it to get the deal
done. It’s probably more likely to be the latter.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
