Mironovskiy Hleboproduct SA, a
Ukrainian poultry producer, said first-quarter profit fell 45
percent as a result of foreign-exchange losses.  Net income fell to 156 million hryvnia ($20 million) after
a $6 million foreign-exchange loss from 285 million hryvnia a
year earlier, MHP said in an e-mailed statement today. Revenue
rose 23 percent to 1.96 billion hryvnia.  “We expect revenues to increase 20 percent this year,”
Chief Financial Officer Viktoria Kapelyushnaya said in a phone
interview in Kiev. Profit from grain sales will increase at
least 60 percent in 2011, she added.  Poultry sales rose 2 percent in the first quarter to 84,300
tons and average chicken meat price increased by 4 percent.  MHP had a first-quarter surplus in currency inflow that
will increase by year end on an expanding grains harvest,
Kapelyushnaya said. Grain yields will probably increase this
year by 10 percent to 15 percent for some crops, she added.  To contact the reporters on this story:
