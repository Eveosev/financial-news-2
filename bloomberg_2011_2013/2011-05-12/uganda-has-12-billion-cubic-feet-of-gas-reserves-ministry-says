Uganda has 12 billion standard cubic
feet (339 million cubic meters) of natural gas reserves in its
Albertine Graben region, the Ministry of  Foreign Affairs  said.  The gas is in addition to oil reserves of more than 2
billion barrels, of which 700 million to 800 million are
recoverable, the Kampala-based ministry said in an advert today
in the New Vision newspaper.  The East African country has drilled 48 wells since 2002
with a 90 percent success rate, the ministry said, citing
figures from the energy ministry.  To contact the reporters on this story:
