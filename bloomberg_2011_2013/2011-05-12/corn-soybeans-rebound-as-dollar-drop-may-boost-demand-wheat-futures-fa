Corn futures rebounded from a seven-
week low and soybeans rose the most this month as a decline in
the dollar revived prospects for demand. Wheat prices fell to
the lowest since March.  The greenback dropped as much as 0.4 percent against a
basket of six currencies, boosting the appeal of U.S. goods. The
Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of 19 raw materials rose
from the lowest since January. In the week ended May 5, U.S.
export sales of corn jumped 61 percent from a week earlier, and
soybeans almost tripled, government data show.  “Just watch the dollar,” said Frank Cholly Sr., a senior
market strategist at Lind-Waldock, a broker in  Chicago . “The
dollar was up, and commodities were down. Then the dollar went
negative, and commodities bounced back.”  Corn futures for July delivery rose 3.25 cents, or 0.5
percent, to settle at $6.805 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the
Chicago Board of Trade. Earlier, the price touched $6.59, the
lowest for a most-active contract since March 18.  Corn has surged 80 percent in the past year on record use
by ethanol producers and increasing demand from livestock
farmers. Wet weather from  Ohio  to  North Dakota  delayed planting,
sending futures up 9.1 percent in April.  Soybean futures for July delivery gained 11 cents, or 0.8
percent, to $13.4275 a bushel. The price has climbed 39 percent
in the past year on record Chinese purchases.  ‘Ration Demand’  Wheat futures for July delivery fell 23.5 cents, or 3.1
percent, to $7.355 a bushel. Earlier, the price touched $7.285,
the lowest since March 31. The grain has climbed 50 percent in
the past year after drought slashed output in  Russia  and floods
eroded supplies from  Canada  and  Australia .  Yesterday, the USDA reported that domestic reserves next
year may total 702 million bushels, more than the 683 million
expected by analysts. The agency also lowered its forecast for
U.S. exports.  “Everyone immediately jumped to the conclusion that prices
have gotten high enough do their job and ration demand,” said
 Tomm Pfitzenmaier , a partner at Summit Commodity Brokerage in
Des Moines,  Iowa .  Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, valued at $66.7 billion in
2010, followed by soybeans at $38.9 billion, government figures
show. Wheat was fourth at $13 billion, behind hay.  To contact the reporter on this story:
