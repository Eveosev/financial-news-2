Morgan Stanley failed to buy  North
Sea  Forties after a purchase yesterday. Vitol Group sold a cargo
of Urals for delivery in the Mediterranean at a higher price.  A total of three cargoes of Forties crude were dropped from
the export program for June, according to a revised shipping
schedule obtained by Bloomberg News.  North Sea  Morgan Stanley didn’t manage to buy a cargo of Forties for
loading May 28 to June 3 at 50 cents a barrel above Dated Brent,
according to a survey of traders and brokers monitoring the
daily Platts trading window. The New York-based bank yesterday
bought a shipment at 65 cents more than the benchmark. Statoil
ASA was unable to purchase a consignment for June 1 to June 3 at
a premium of 40 cents to Dated Brent, the survey showed.  Reported North Sea market activity typically occurs during
the Platts window, which ends at 4:30 p.m. London time. Before
the window, Forties loading in 10 to 21 days cost 67 cents more
than Dated Brent, the most since April 12, compared with 55
cents yesterday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Brent for June settlement traded at $112.31 a barrel on the
London-based ICE Futures  Europe  exchange at the close of the
window, down from $115.32 yesterday. The July contract was at
$111.70, 61 cents less than June.  The shipments that were dropped are for loading in three-
day periods starting from June 11, June 13 and June 29, the plan
showed. Three other consignments originally scheduled for May
15, May 26 and May 29 were deferred to June. As a result, the
Forties program for the month will be unchanged at 24 cargoes.
Shipments for May will shrink to 20 lots from 27 after four
consignments were dropped last week, according to the programs.  North Sea Buzzard crude’s share in the Forties oil blend
fell to 18 percent last week, from 29 percent in the period to
May 1, BP Plc said today on its website.  BP is in talks to connect 15 more fields to its Forties
Pipeline System in the North Sea, Peter Mather, BP’s head of
country for the U.K., said at a conference in  London  today.  Mediterranean/Urals  OAO Lukoil bought 100,000 metric tons of Urals for June 1
to June 5 delivery to the Mediterranean from Vitol at $2.90
barrel below Dated Brent, the survey showed. The grade last
traded at a discount of $3.90 on April 28. No bids or offers
were made for Urals in northwest Europe.  West Africa  Indian Oil Corp. was scheduled to award its second spot
tender for sweet crude for loading in June today and the outcome
is not available, said traders participating in the market.  Loading programs for Angolan and Nigerian crudes for July
are likely to be released next week, they said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
