Natural gas futures climbed for the
second time in three days in  New York  after a government report
that showed U.S. stockpiles increased less than expected last
week prompted speculation that output growth may slow.  Gas gained 0.3 percent after inventories rose 70 billion
cubic feet in the week ended May 6 to 1.827 trillion cubic feet,
the Energy Department said today. Analyst estimates compiled by
Bloomberg showed a gain of 71 billion. A separate survey of
Bloomberg users showed an increase of 72 billion.  “The storage number was definitely on the more bullish
side of the trade,” said Jason Schenker, the president of
Prestige Economics, an energy advisory company in Austin, Texas.
“It was somewhat consistent with weather data, but we’d still
question where the glut of unconventional gas production is that
should have made this number bigger.”  Natural gas for June delivery rose 1.3 cents to settle at
$4.194 per million British thermal units on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange . The futures have declined 4.8 percent this
year.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
June dropped to 31.54 from 33.27 yesterday.  Gas stockpiles were 2 percent below the five-year average
and 12 percent below last year’s level, the widest year-on-year
deficit since the week ended Aug. 1, 2008, today’s report
showed.  The Energy Department lowered its forecast for natural gas
output in 2011 by 0.1 percent and raised its outlook for prices
in its  Short-Term Energy Outlook  on May 10.  Gas Production  Marketed gas production will average 63.23 billion cubic
feet a day in 2011, down from 63.32 billion estimated in April,
the department said, citing a drop in drilling and a forecast of
higher consumption. The estimate is up 2.3 percent from 61.83
billion produced in 2010.  Gas prices  at the benchmark  Henry Hub  in Erath,  Louisiana ,
will average $4.37 per thousand cubic feet, or $4.24 per million
Btu, up from the previous estimate of $4.10 per million Btu,
according to the department.  Hotter-than-normal weather is likely in the Northeast and
parts of the Midwest and South from May 22 through May 26,
according to MDA EarthSat Weather in Rockville,  Maryland . Above-
normal temperatures may increase air conditioner use, boosting
the demand for gas as a power-plant fuel.  The high temperature in New York on May 23 may be 83
degrees Fahrenheit (28 Celsius), 10 above normal, according to
AccuWeather Inc. in  State College ,  Pennsylvania . The high in
Houston may be 89 degrees, 2 above normal.  Power plants  use 30 percent of the nation’s gas supplies,
according to the Energy Department.  Force Majeure  El Paso Corp.’s Tennessee Gas Pipeline declared force
majeure for a segment of the line in Louisiana affected by
flooding around the Atchafalaya River, according to a posting on
the pipeline’s website. Force majeure is a declaration of an
unexpected event that legally excuses a company from fulfilling
its contractual obligations.  Tennessee Gas will isolate the line section between MLV 516
and MLV 521, according to the posting. Operators will be
required to shut in no later than 9 a.m. local time tomorrow.  The Tennessee Gas network includes 13,700 miles of pipeline
and has a capacity of up to 7.2 billion cubic feet of gas per
day. The line extends from  Texas  to  New England .  Gas futures volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was
245,630 as of 2:39 p.m., compared with the three-month average
of 310,000. Volume was 300,193 yesterday. Open interest was
979,155 contracts. The three-month average open interest is
944,000.  The exchange has a one-business-day delay in reporting open
interest and full volume data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
