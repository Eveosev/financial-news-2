Commodities fell for a second day
after  China  raised banks’ reserve requirements, heightening
speculation slower growth will curb raw materials demand.  The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Index of 24 raw materials fell
0.9 percent to 674.89 by 3:15 p.m. London time after dropping
3.9 percent yesterday. Silver tumbled 5.3 percent. Crude oil
declined 0.8 percent after the  International Energy Agency  cut
its 2011 demand forecast.  Reserve ratios will increase 0.5 percentage point from
May 18, the People’s Bank of China said on its website today.
It’s the fifth increase this year as the government tried to
cool inflation. China’s inflation stayed above 5 percent in
April, exceeding Premier  Wen Jiabao ’s 4 percent target,
according to a government report yesterday.  “Investors are increasingly fearful that Chinese demand
for imported oil and materials will slow if efforts to contain
inflation lead to slower growth,”  Chris Weafer , chief
strategist at UralSib Financial Corp., said by e-mail.  Commodities dropped 11 percent last week, the most since
December 2008, on speculation of slowing economic growth
resulting from tightened monetary policy. The GSCI index is
about 2 percent above last week’s low of 658.93, the lowest
since mid-February.  Global investors have tempered their optimism about the
U.S. and world economies and plan to put more of their money in
cash and less in commodities over the next six months, a
Bloomberg survey found. Thirty percent of 1,263 investors,
analysts and traders said they intend to reduce investments in
commodities.  $4 a Gallon  Oil fell $1.02 to $97.19 a barrel in  New York . The IEA
trimmed its estimate of global fuel consumption by 0.2 percent,
saying $4 a gallon gasoline is likely to lead to an “anemic
U.S. driving season” that typically starts after Memorial Day
in May. Gasoline dropped 1.5 percent to $3.0766 a gallon.  Copper for delivery in three months fell 0.2 percent to
$8,678.75 a metric ton. China is the world’s largest buyer of
the metal.  Gold for immediate delivery declined 0.5 percent to
$1,494.22 an ounce.  Silver futures traded on the Comex in New York slumped as
much as 9.1 percent to $32.30 an ounce, after falling 7.7
percent yesterday.  “It’s not surprising at all, given the importance of China,
that commodities prices are under some pressure,”  Jim O’Neill ,
chairman of Goldman Sachs Asset Management, who oversees $677
billion, told reporters in  Hong Kong  today.  China’s expansion may slow to about 8 percent in June
through December, he said. The economy grew 10.3 percent last
year.  -- With assistance from Sophie Leung in Hong Kong, Lynn
