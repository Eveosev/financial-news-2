Royal Philips Electronics NV, the
world’s largest maker of patient-monitoring systems, said
healthcare markets are returning to pre-crisis levels and growth
in the U.S. is expected to be in the “low single-digits” this
year.  Economic recovery and pent up demand for equipment,
software and services will help spur U.S. sales, according to a
company presentation on its  Web Site  today. China, India and
Russia will help generate double-digit growth at the Amsterdam-
based company’s so-called growth geographies.  Healthcare International, which includes Western Europe,
Japan, South Korea, Australia and  New Zealand , will show a flat
to modest growth in 2011 with softening market conditions in
southwest Europe and potential headwinds from the Japan
earthquake, the company said.  Philips, which competes with  Siemens AG (SIE)  and  General
Electric Co (GE)  in home healthcare, is looking for ways to
accelerate growth by generating more value from existing
acquisitions and pursuing new deals, the presentation from
Healthcare Chief Executive Officer Steve Rusckowski said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
