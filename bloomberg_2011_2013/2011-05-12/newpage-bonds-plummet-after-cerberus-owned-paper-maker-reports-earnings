NewPage Corp. bonds tumbled by the
most since being issued in 2005 after the coated-paper maker
owned by Cerberus Capital Management LP reported first-quarter
results that were lower than analysts forecast and said  Robert Nardelli  resigned from its board of directors.  NewPage’s $806 million of 10 percent second-lien debt due
May 2012 fell 12.8 cents to 45 cents on the dollar as of 4:34
p.m. in  New York , according to Trace, the bond-price reporting
system of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.  The securities have declined from as much as 70 cents in
March and are at the lowest level since September after
Miamisburg, Ohio-based NewPage said first-quarter adjusted
earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization
were $85 million compared with $132 million in the fourth
quarter.  “The biggest drivers behind the falling bond prices are
the $85 million EBITDA, which is below Wall Street’s
expectation, and coated-paper prices,” said  Rahul Gandhi , an
analyst at debt-research firm CreditSights Inc. in  London .  JPMorgan Chase & Co. said in a note that unadjusted Ebitda
of $70 million was below its $92 million estimate and is “down
substantially” from $114 million in the fourth quarter.  Amber Garwood, a spokeswoman for NewPage, didn’t return a
phone call seeking comment.  Nardelli Resignation  “There were no disagreements between” Nardelli and
NewPage that resulted in his resignation, according to a
regulatory filing today.  The former chairman and chief executive officer of
automaker Chrysler LLC and Home Depot Inc., joined NewPage’s
board in June about five years after Cerberus took control of
the company when it bought MeadWestvaco Corp.’s paper business
for $2.3 billion. An affiliate of Cerberus provided $415 million
in equity to NewPage, according to a statement at the time.  NewPage is attempting to cut costs and reduce debt by
selling assets after demand for coated-paper declined since
2008. Under its credit agreement, the company has to repay or
refinance the second-lien bonds by Jan. 31, or its $1.77 billion
of 11.375 percent bonds coming due in December 2014 will mature
instead in March 2012, according to the filing.  “Adjusted EBITDA of $85 million barely covers interest
expense and people are concerned that  cash flow  isn’t growing
fast enough to avoid a debt restructuring,” Kim Noland, an
analyst with GimmeCredit LLC in New York, said in an e-mail.  To contact the reporter on this story:
