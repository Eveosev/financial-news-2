Japan ’s 10-year bond yields were
within half a basis point of this year’s low before data
forecast to show a plunge in machinery orders, adding to signs
of the economic impact from a record earthquake in March.  The nation’s bonds have handed investors a 0.6 percent
return this month, an index compiled by Bank of America Merrill
Lynch shows, outperforming a 2 percent slump in the Nikkei 225
Stock Average. The government today said it will issue so-called
subsidy bonds to fund an organization established to help  Tokyo 
Electric Power Co. handle compensation for victims of the
disaster at its tsunami-damaged nuclear power plant.  “What’s behind the resilience of the  bond market  is the
fact that the economy isn’t picking up,” said  Takeshi Minami ,
chief economist in Tokyo at Norinchukin Research Institute Co.,
a unit of Japan’s biggest lender for farmers and fishermen.
“Issuance of subsidy bonds doesn’t affect the supply-demand
balance of  government bonds .”  The benchmark 10-year yield advanced half a basis point to
1.115 percent as of 3:21 p.m. at Japan Bond Trading Co., the
nation’s largest interdealer debt broker. The 1.1 percent
security due March 2021 was sold yesterday when 10-year yields
dropped to 1.11 percent, the least since Dec. 30.  The yield decreased 2.5 basis points in the past five days,
giving it a fifth-straight weekly decline, the longest since
August 2008. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  Ten-year bond futures for June delivery added 0.09 to
140.82 at the Tokyo Stock Exchange. The  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  lost 0.7
percent, boosting demand for safer assets.  Factory orders decreased 10 percent in March from February,
the most since September, a survey of economists shows before
the Cabinet Office releases the data on May 16.  The government estimates that damage may reach 25 trillion
yen ($310 billion) from the magnitude-9 temblor and subsequent
tsunami on March 11 that left 24,000 people dead or missing and
caused radiation leaks at the Tokyo Electric power plant.  The government grants subsidy bonds as a substitute for
cash, which are typically not allowed to be transferred or used
as collateral, according to the Ministry of Finance website.  To contact the reporters on this story:
