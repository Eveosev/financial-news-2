Copper dropped to a five-month low,
while zinc and lead declined on concern that  China  may continue
monetary tightening after inflation spread beyond food, damping
the demand outlook in the world’s largest consumer of the metal.  Copper for three-month delivery on the  London  Metal
Exchange fell as much as 1.1 percent to $8,607 a metric ton, the
lowest level since Dec. 1, and traded at $8,615 by 1:18 p.m.
Singapore time. All six LME metals retreated as China’s
inflation exceeded analysts and the government’s target. An
index of the six metals slumped to this year’s low yesterday.  “The data yesterday supported our view that tightening
policies won’t ease in the near future,” said Xu Liping, an
analyst at HNA Topwin Futures Co.  China’s non-food inflation climbed 2.7 percent in April,
the fastest pace in at least six years, the statistics bureau
said yesterday. Overall consumer prices rose 5.3 percent,
surpassing the government’s full-year target of 4 percent and
exceeding the 5.2 percent median forecast in a Bloomberg News
survey of 30 economists.  Copper has tumbled 10 percent this year as the People’s
Bank of China raised the reserve requirement ratios seven times
and the  interest rates  four times since October last year to mop
up excess liquidity. Deutsche Bank AG expects inflation to peak
at 6 percent in June, with policy makers raising borrowing costs
at least once more.  The metal for July-delivery on the Comex in  New York  fell
for a second day, by as much as 0.3 percent to $3.90 a pound. It
dropped to $3.8980 yesterday, the lowest price since December.
Copper for July delivery on the Shanghai Futures Exchange lost
as much as 2.3 percent to 64,760 yuan ($9,967) a ton, also the
lowest since December.  ‘Further Downside’  “Commodities may see further downside given China’s
economic outlook,” said Xu.  Global investors have tempered their optimism about the
U.S. and world economies and plan to put more of their money in
cash and less in commodities over the next six months, a
Bloomberg survey found.  Almost one in three of those questioned say they will hold
more cash, while 30 percent intend to reduce investments in
commodities, according to a quarterly Bloomberg Global poll of
1,263 investors, analysts and traders who are Bloomberg
subscribers. Both results were the highest since the survey
began asking the question last June.  Aluminum in London fell 1 percent to $2,585 a ton, zinc
declined 1.7 percent to $2,123 a ton, and lead lost 1.6 percent
to $2,258 a ton. Nickel dropped 1.8 percent to $24,100 a ton,
and tin shed 0.5 percent to $28,990 a ton.  -- Helen Sun  and Glenys Sim. Editors:  Richard Dobson , Jake Lloyd-
