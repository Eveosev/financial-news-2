Lafarge SA (LG) , the world’s biggest
cement producer, agreed to sell U.S. assets with an enterprise
value of $760 million to Colombia’s  Cementos Argos SA (CEMARGOS)  as the
French company aims to regain an investment-grade  credit rating .  The facilities being sold include cement plants in
Harleyville,  South Carolina , and Roberta, Alabama, a grinding
station in Atlanta and ready-mix concrete units across the
southeast U.S., Paris-based Lafarge said today in a statement.
Revenue from the divested businesses totaled about $240 million
in 2010.  Chief Executive Officer Bruno Lafont pledged in February to
dispose of units valued at 750 million euros ($1.1 billion) in
an effort to cut the 14 billion-euro net debt by at least 2
billion euros this year. Standard & Poor’s cut Lafarge’s credit
rating in March by one level to BB+, or junk, citing “sluggish
demand” and political turmoil in Egypt.  “We expect no rating change on the news,” as the units’
value remains within the range of Lafarge’s target for
disposals, Caroline Brugere, a Paris-based analyst at Credit
Agricole CIB, said in a research note today.  Lafarge rose as much as 2.5 percent to 46.84 euros and was
up 1 percent as of 12:56 p.m. in Paris trading, the best
performance on France’s benchmark  CAC 40 Index (CAC) , which declined.  After the sale, which is subject to regulatory approval,
Lafarge will retain 21 cement and grinding plants and
“significant positions” in other product lines in the U.S.,
the French company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
