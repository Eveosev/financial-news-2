The pound traded touched the highest
level against the  euro  in almost two months before a report that
is forecast to show industrial production rebounded.  Sterling was little changed versus the dollar and the yen.
Output expanded 0.8 percent in March, according to the median
estimate of 27 economists in a Bloomberg News survey, after
contracting 1.2 percent in February.  The pound was little changed at 86.85 pence per euro as of
7:23 a.m. in London, from 86.83 pence yesterday in  New York . It
traded at $1.6349 from $1.6345 and 132.48 yen from 132.49.  To contact the reporter on this story:
