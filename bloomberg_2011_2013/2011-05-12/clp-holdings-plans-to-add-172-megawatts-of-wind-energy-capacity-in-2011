CLP Holdings Ltd. (2)  plans to add 172
megawatts of wind power capacity to its portfolio this year,
chairman Michael Kadoorie said at a media briefing in Hong Kong
today. The company also started commercial operations at its
Chinese hydroelectric plant in Jiangbian, Sichuan province, on
April 28 and its Jhajjar coal-fired power plant in  India  is 80
percent complete, Kadoorie said.  Hong Kong-based CLP has ‘absolute confidence’ in its Daya
Bay nuclear power plant in southern  China , according to Chief
Executive Andrew Brandler at the briefing. The company’s thermal
plants in China are affected by high coal prices, he said.  CLP has no specific acquisition targets and has no plans to
raise electricity prices in  Hong Kong , Brandler said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
