U.K. Foreign Office Minister Alistair Burt said he feels “deep concern” over renewed violence in
Yemen and condemned actions by Yemen’s security forces that led
to deaths and injuries of protesters, the Foreign and
Commonwealth Office said in an e-mailed statement.  The FCO, citing Burt’s remarks after a meeting today with
the United Nations Secretary General’s Special Envoy on Yemen,
Jamal Benomar, said the minister urged Yemeni authorities to
respect the right of peaceful process and free speech or risk
“undermining the efforts to secure the agreement brokered by
the Gulf Co-operation Council.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
