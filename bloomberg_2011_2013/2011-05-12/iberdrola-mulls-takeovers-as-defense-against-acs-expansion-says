Iberdrola SA is examining potential
takeover candidates as a way to limit the influence that
Actividades de Construccion y Servicios SA can exert over
management, Expansion reported.   The Spanish power company headed by Ignacio Galan is
considering a takeover bid for Scottish & Southern Energy Plc or
a merger with  RWE AG (RWE)  to dilute ACS’s stake of about 20 percent
in the company, the newspaper said, citing people in the banking
industry without naming them.   ACS Chairman Florentino Perez has been fighting to win a
seat on the Iberdrola board and his campaign will receive a
boost on July 1 when a rule capping ACS’s voting rights at 10
percent will expire, Expansion added.   Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
