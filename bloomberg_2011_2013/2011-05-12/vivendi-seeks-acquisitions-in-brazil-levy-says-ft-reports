Vivendi SA (VIV)  wants to expand its
operations in  Brazil  through acquisitions in order to build on
its GVT Holding SA unit, the Financial Times reported, citing an
interview with Chairman Jean-Bernard Levy.  “Brazil is going to be an important growth driver for
us,” Levy said, according to the FT.  Vivendi is not immediately seeking to buy the 20 percent of
pay-tv Canal Plus it doesn’t already own, Levy also said,
according to the FT.  To contact the reporter on this story:
