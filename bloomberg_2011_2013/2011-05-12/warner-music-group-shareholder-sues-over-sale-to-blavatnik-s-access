Warner Music  Group Corp. was sued by
a shareholder over claims its $1.3 billion acquisition by former
director Len Blavatnik’s Access Industries Holdings undervalues
the company.  Warner Music directors abandoned their duty to shareholders
when they agreed to a deal that benefits Access to the
“detriment” of the minority investors, Barbara A. Varipapa
said in a complaint filed today in Delaware Chancery Court in
Wilmington. Warner Music’s largest shareholders, who
collectively own about 56 percent of the company, agreed to vote
in favor of the transaction, according to the complaint.  “The company’s shares are already locked up in favor of
the proposed transaction, rendering the minority shareholders’
vote meaningless,” Varipapa said in her complaint.  Access will pay $8.25 a share for New York-based Warner
Music and will assume bond debt, valuing the entire transaction
at about $3.3 billion, the companies said last week. The sale
capped a three-month auction whose finalists included brothers
Tom and Alec Gores and Sony/ATV Music Publishing.  In her complaint, Varipapa claims that the deal is
inadequate and includes onerous provisions that preclude a
superior offer. Varipapa is seeking to represent all Warner
Music shareholders in her bid to bar the deal.  Will Tanous, a spokesman for Warner Music, declined to
comment on the complaint.  The case is Varipapa v.  Warner Music Group Corp. (WMG) , CA6478,
Delaware Chancery Court (Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
