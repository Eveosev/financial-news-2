The Georgian government forecasts an
annual influx of as many as 5 million tourists, more than the
Black Sea country’s population, by 2015, the economy and
sustainable development minister said.  Georgia  attracted 675,000 visitors through April, up 43
percent from the year-earlier period, Vera Kobalia said in an
interview today in the capital Tbilisi. For the full year 2010,
the former Soviet republic drew more than 2 million visitors,
the highest total since 2003, when President Mikheil Saakashvili
swept to power in the Rose Revolution.  “More tourists will mean more long-term jobs across
Georgia,” Kobalia said. The Georgian National Investment Agency
has been successful in finding investors interested in taking
part in the construction of a Black Sea resort at Anaklia, which
has been designated a special economic zone, she said.  Tourism accounts for no more than 5 percent of Georgia’s
gross domestic product, Kobalia said on July 12. The economy
expanded 6.4 percent last year to $11.7 billion, according to
the statistics office.  Georgia’s population was 4.4 million as of January 2010,
according to the statistics office.  Saakashvili told businessmen late yesterday that the
government plans to spend $700 million this year on roads and
infrastructure to boost tourism.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
