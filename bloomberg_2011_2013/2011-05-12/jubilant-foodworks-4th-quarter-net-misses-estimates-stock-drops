Jubilant FoodWorks Ltd. (JUBI) , the Indian
franchisee of  Domino’s Pizza Inc. (DPZ) , posted fourth-quarter profit
that missed analysts’ estimates. Its shares sank to the lowest
level in a week.  Net income jumped 86 percent to 193.3 million rupees ($4.3
million) in the three months ended March 31, the company said in
a filing. That’s less than the mean estimate of 195.6 million
rupees in a Bloomberg survey of five analysts.  “The quarter witnessed an increase in food and employee
costs to the level of general inflation during the period,” the
company said in the filing.  Jubilant’s stock tumbled 8 percent to 676.55 rupees as of
2:53 p.m. in Mumbai, set for its lowest close in a week. The
shares have gained 8 percent this year, compared with a 12
percent slide in the 283-member  BSE Mid-Cap Index. (BSEMDCAP)   To contact the reporter on this story:
