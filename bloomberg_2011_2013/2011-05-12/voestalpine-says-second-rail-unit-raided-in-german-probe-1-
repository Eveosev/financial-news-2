Voestalpine AG (VOE) ,  Austria ’s biggest
steel maker, said a one of its rail units was searched in
Germany today, its second raid in as many days.  The German Federal Cartel Office raided the office of TSTG
Schienen Technik GmbH & Co KG in Duisburg, following that of
Voestalpine Kloeckner Bahntechnik GmbH in the same city
yesterday, the Linz-based company said in a statement.  “The reason for the inspections are possible anti-
competitive practices in the German market for rails,”
according to the statement.  Voestalpine said yesterday that the company “takes these
allegations seriously and will openly and fully cooperate with
the authorities.”  TSTG is produces rails, while Kloeckner is active in the
trading of rails for Voestalpine’s railway systems division in
 Germany , according to the company.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
