Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT) ’s acquisition of
a controlling stake in  Massmart Holdings Ltd. (MSM)  may have a
detrimental effect on South Africa’s manufacturing industry,
 Shoprite Holdings Ltd. (SHP)  said.  “Wal-Mart are choosing not to build local distribution
centers because they have access to cheaper imports,” Gerhardus
Ackerman, the head of buying for Shoprite, said at antitrust
hearings being held in Pretoria today. South Africa’s retail
industry is over-traded, he said.  Wal-Mart offered to buy 51 percent of Massmart, South
Africa’s largest food and general goods wholesaler, for 16.5
billion rand ($2.4 billion). The transaction has been opposed
by the South African government and labor unions over concerns
that the purchase may result in job losses.  To contact the reporter on this story:
