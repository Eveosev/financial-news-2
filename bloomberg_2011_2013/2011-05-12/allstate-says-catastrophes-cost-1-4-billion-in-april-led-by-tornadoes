Allstate Corp. (ALL) , the largest publicly
traded U.S. home and auto insurer, said losses tied to
catastrophes such as tornadoes cost the company $1.4 billion
last month.  Tornadoes in  Alabama , Arkansas, Georgia and  Virginia  in the
last week of the month were the most expensive of 13 events, the
Northbrook, Illinois-based company said in a statement today.  The Alabama storms and wildfires in  Texas  contributed to
more than $5 billion in U.S. insurance industry losses last
month, according to Aon Corp., the world’s largest insurance
broker. Allstate Chief Executive Officer  Thomas Wilson  is
releasing more data about losses to give investors a clearer
picture of earnings. The company said it will disclose monthly
estimates for catastrophes when costs exceed $150 million.  “These announcements will inform investors who have a
strong interest in the company’s catastrophe loss estimates when
there is significant severity or frequency of catastrophe
events,” Allstate said in the statement.  During the past decade, Allstate has had catastrophe losses
exceeding $150 million in about 30 percent of months, according
to the statement.  The insurer said last month that lower catastrophe costs in
the first quarter helped profit more than quadruple to $519
million. Operating profit, which excludes some investment
results was 93 cents a share, beating the 68-cent average
estimate of 21 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. The insurer
missed analysts estimates in the fourth quarter on higher-than-
expected costs tied to Arizona hailstorms.  To contact the reporter on this story:
