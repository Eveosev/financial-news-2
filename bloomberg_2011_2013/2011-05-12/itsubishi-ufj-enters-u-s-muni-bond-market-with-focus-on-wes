Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group,
 Japan ’s biggest publicly traded bank, is entering the U.S.
municipal-bond market, hiring six public-finance professionals
and concentrating on issuing and trading debt in western states.  “There is a big focus on  California  and the West Coast
initially,” said Spenser Huston, head of capital markets at
Mitsubishi UFJ Securities in  New York , the U.S. unit of the
Tokyo-based bank. It owns San Francisco-based  UnionBankCal
Corp.,  which had assets of about $79 billion as of Dec. 31.  Huston, 49, said the decision to create a municipal-bond
trading and underwriting business is part of a broader move to
expand Mitsubishi UFJ’s fixed-income operations in the U.S. In
recent weeks, the firm has also hired high-yield debt traders
and sales people.  “It is a good time to buy talent,” said Huston, whose
parent company owns 22.4 percent of investment-bank  Morgan
Stanley. (MS)   The firm’s expansion into municipal debt will be managed by
Marc Hughes, former debt manager for the  San Francisco  Public
Utilities Commission. Hughes joined this month as an executive
director in the San Francisco office.  Brant Smith, who joined in April as an executive director,
will run municipal underwriting in San Francisco. Smith was
previously with Banc of America Securities, where he oversaw
West Coast tax-exempt fixed-rate underwriting. Hardy Manges,
previously a director of municipal trading at Knight Capital
Group, will head secondary municipal-debt trading.  To contact the reporter on this story:
