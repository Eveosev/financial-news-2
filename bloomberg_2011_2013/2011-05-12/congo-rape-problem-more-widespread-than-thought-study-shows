At least 400,000 women were raped in
 Democratic Republic of Congo  over a 12-month period in 2006 and
2007, according to an American Journal of Public Health study
that shows the problem of sexual assault is not confined to the
restive east.  The study, based on a 2007 nationwide survey of 3,436 women
between the ages of 15 and 49, estimates that more than 1.7
million Congolese women have been raped in their lifetime and at
least 3 million more have been raped by an intimate partner.  “Not only is sexual violence more generalized than
previously thought, but our findings suggest that future
policies and programs should focus on abuse within families,”
the study said. Congo should “eliminate the acceptance of and
impunity surrounding sexual violence nationwide.”  Congo is recovering from more than a decade of war that
began in the mid-1990s. Fighting continues in the country’s
mineral-rich east and rape has become a common tactic in the
conflict.  In March, a report by the UN High Commissioner for Human
Rights called for compensation for Congolese victims of sexual
violence through a special reparations fund.  Few rapists are caught, the UN report said, and those who
are convicted often escape from prison. In cases where the
Congolese government has been found liable for damages, victims
have not been paid.  To contact the reporter on this story:
