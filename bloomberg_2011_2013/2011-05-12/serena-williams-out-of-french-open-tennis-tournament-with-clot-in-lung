Former world No. 1  Serena Williams 
won’t play this year’s French Open tennis tournament because
she’s still recovering from a blood clot.  The American’s withdrawl was announced today on the French
Open website. Two operations on her foot and treatment for a
clot in her lung have kept Williams out since she won her 13th
major title at Wimbledon last July.  Organizers said  Argentina ’s David Nalbandian has dropped
out of the men’s event, and Juan Martin del Potro is unsure
after tearing a hip muscle. Kim Clijsters remains on the women’s
player list, but may not make it because of an ankle injury
suffered at a cousin’s wedding. Dinara Safina, a finalist in
2008 and 2009, will miss  Roland Garros  as she attempts to heal
her back with a long layoff, the organizers said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
