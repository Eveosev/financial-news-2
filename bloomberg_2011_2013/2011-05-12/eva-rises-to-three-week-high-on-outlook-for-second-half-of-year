Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (TEVA) 
climbed to the highest level in three weeks after the world’
largest maker of generic drugs reassured investors that second-
half results will improve.  The shares increased 3.7 percent to 169.60 shekels, the
highest since April 17 at 11:41 a.m. in  Tel Aviv . The stock
closed 3.2 percent higher in the U.S. yesterday, after falling
earlier.  Growth will probably perk up in the second half of the year
and the drop in generic-drug sales in the U.S. should not be
viewed as a trend, Chief Executive Officer Shlomo Yanai said
yesterday. Teva said first-quarter revenue increased 12 percent
to $4.1 billion, missing the average estimate of $4.29 billion.  “The company’s conference call strongly reassured that it
is on track to meet its 2011-2012 targets and is becoming more
and more diversified which should help it meet its 2015
targets,” Uriel Goren, the head of equities sales at Tel Aviv-
based DS Brokerage Ltd. in an emailed note today.  The  Petah Tikva , Israel-based company repeated its forecast
of sales between $18.5 billion and $19 billion this year, with
earnings excluding some costs in the range of $4.90 to $5.20 per
share. “We continue to expect the second half of 2011 to be
significantly stronger than the first half,” Yanai said in a
conference call with analysts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
