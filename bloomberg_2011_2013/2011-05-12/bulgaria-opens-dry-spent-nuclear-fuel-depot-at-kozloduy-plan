Bulgaria opened a dry spent nuclear-
fuel storage facility at the Kozloduy nuclear power plant to
store radioactive waste from four decommissioned reactors.  The 70.5 million-euro ($100 million) depot was funded by a
group led by the  European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development  and was built by German-registered NUKEM
Technologies GmbH, the Energy and Economy Ministry said in an e-
mailed statement today.  Bulgaria has been sending Kozloduy’s spent fuel to  Russia .
The storage facility will be fully operational by mid-2012 after
licensing and will be able to store spent fuel for 50 years. It
will also be upgraded to store spent fuel from Kozloduy’s two
operating 1,000 megawatt reactors, the ministry said.  Kozloduy , on the Danube river, closed four 400-megawatt
reactors as a condition for joining the European Union in 2007.  To contact the reporter on this story:
