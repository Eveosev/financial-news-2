Sparx Group Co.,  Asia ’s second-
biggest hedge fund, swung to a full-year loss of 3.7 billion yen
($46 million) as fee income declined.  The loss for the period ended March 31 compares with profit
of 398 million yen a year earlier, the Tokyo-based company said
in a statement today. Revenue fell 10 percent to 7.1 billion yen.  President Shuhei Abe is shifting his strategy to serve a
wider market beyond  Japan  by planning new funds and boosting its
presence in  Hong Kong . Assets have fallen by more than half from
a 2006 peak of 2 trillion yen.  Fee income dropped 19 percent from a year earlier to 4.9
billion yen, the statement said.  The company’s shares have declined 3 percent this year and
slid 2.6 percent to 8,880 yen on  Tokyo ’s Jasdaq exchange today
before the earnings announcement.  Abe plans to start a long-short fund to invest in shares of
Asian companies that stand to benefit the most from the world’s
fastest-growing economies. In March, he set up a group executive
board and relocated Masaki Taniguchi to Hong Kong from Tokyo,
appointing him as group chief operating officer.  To contact the reporters on this story:
