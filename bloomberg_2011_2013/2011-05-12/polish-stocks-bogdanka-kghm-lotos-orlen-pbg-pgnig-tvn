Poland’s WIG20 Index declined for a
second day, retreating 27.20, or 1 percent, to 2,829.83 at the
5:30 p.m. close in Warsaw.  The following are among the most active stocks on the
 Warsaw Stock Exchange  today. Stock symbols follow company names.  Lubelski Wegiel Bogdanka SA (LWB)   sank 7.9 zloty, or 6.8
percent, to 108.4 zloty, falling the most since the stock
started trading in 2009. The coal producer said net income
declined to 35.9 million zloty ($13 million) from 53 million
zloty a year earlier, missing the 48.4 million-zloty mean
estimate of four analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Separately, Bogdanka will probably post earnings below last
year’s levels in the first three quarters of 2011 due to delays
in opening a new mine shaft before showing annual improvement in
the fourth quarter, Chief Executive Officer Miroslaw Taras said
at a press conference in Warsaw today.  KGHM Polska Miedz SA (KGH)  , Poland’s sole copper maker,
fell 4.8 zloty, or 2.6 percent, to 180.2 zloty. PKN Orlen SA
(PKN PW), the country’s biggest oil company, lost 1 zloty, or
1.9 percent, to 51.9 zloty and  Grupa Lotos SA (LTS)  , the
second-largest refiner, slid 0.91 zloty, or 2 percent, to 45.39
zloty. Commodities fell after China raised banks’ reserve
requirements, heightening speculation slower growth will curb
raw materials demand.  PBG SA (PBG)  , Poland’s third-largest builder, plunged to
the lowest level in almost five years after Obrascon Huarte Lain
SA of Spain said that negotiations over the acquisition of PBG’s
majority stake in  Hydrobudowa Polska SA (HBP)  and Aprivia SA have been
suspended. PBG sank 4.9 zloty, or 3.3 percent, to 146 zloty.  Hydrobudowa (HBP PW) slumped 0.08 zloty, or 3.7 percent, to
2.08 zloty, a record-low close.  Polskie Gornictwo Naftowe i Gazownictwo SA (PGN)   jumped
0.2 zloty, or 5.1 percent, to 4.1 zloty, closing at the highest
level since August 2009. The gas company beat analysts’ average
estimate of first-quarter profit by 46 percent, benefiting from
higher  oil prices  and a shale-gas boom.  TVN SA (TVN)   slipped 0.6 zloty, or 3.5 percent, to 16.75
zloty, closing at the lowest level since March 23. Poland’s
second-largest television network reported a first-quarter net
loss of 40.5 million zloty compared with profit of 64 million
zloty a year earlier. The six analysts surveyed by Bloomberg
expected a loss of 33.3 million zloty.  To contact the reporter on this story:
