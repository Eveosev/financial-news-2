Kenya has been facing a delay in
clearing goods through customs because of a  power failure  since
May 10 at the Kenya Revenue Authority’s data center, said
Kennedy Onyonyi, the agency’s spokesman.  The organization doesn’t expect to lose revenue because of
the outage, which was caused by scheduled maintenance as they
attempted to install a power back-up system, Onyonyi told
reporters today in the capital, Nairobi. The outage “interrupted
KRA online services” and is expected to return to normal by the
end of the day, he said.  Customs services, which clears an average of 1,700
containers per day at the main port at  Mombasa , has “deployed
more personnel” and granted special clearance to oil in a bid to
ease recent shortages in East Africa’s biggest economy, said
Beatrice Memo, a commissioner with the service.  Kenya had a nationwide fuel crisis last week due to supply
constrains. The ministry of energy awarded a tender today to
KenolKobil Ltd., to import 36,355 metric tons of diesel to be
delivered July 1 and 3.  To contact the reporter on this story:
