Societe Television Francaise 1 (TFI) , the
owner of  France ’s most-watched TV channel, said first-quarter
profit rose 48 percent, beating analysts’ estimates.  Net income climbed to 48.2 million euros ($69 million) from
32.6 million euros a year earlier. Analysts had predicted profit
of 35 million euros, the average of four estimates compiled by
Blooomberg.  TF1 is looking to keep market share and advertising revenue
as it competes with pay-TV operators like Vivendi SA’s Canal
Plus and manages the shift to Internet television. The company
is working with  France Telecom SA (FTE) ’s Orange unit to put content
onto mobile and Internet portals run by the largest French
telecom company.  The company reiterated its forecast for flat full-year
sales.  To contact the reporter on this story:  To contact the reporter on this story:
