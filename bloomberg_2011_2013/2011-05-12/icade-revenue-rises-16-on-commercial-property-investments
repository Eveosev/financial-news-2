Icade (ICAD)  SA, the property developer
controlled indirectly by the French state, said revenue rose 16
percent in the first quarter, aided by growth in its commercial
property investment division.  Revenue rose to 354.6 million euros ($504.7 million) from
305.7 million euros a year earlier, the Paris-based company said
in a statement today.  Chief Executive Officer Serge Grzybowski sold Icade’s
residential properties, peripheral property management
businesses and buildings with limited scope to grow rents or
values as he focuses on more profitable commercial real estate.
In October, the company completed the acquisition of Morgan
Stanley’s Cie. La Lucette after a share offer.  The quarter’s revenue was released after the close of
regular trading in Paris. Icade gained 1.3 percent to 88.29
euros, lifting the company’s market value to 4.59 billion euros.
About 56 percent of the shares are owned by  France ’s state-owned
bank, Caisse des Depots et Consignations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
