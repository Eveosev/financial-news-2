Phillips de Pury & Co . scored its
second-highest tally ever for a contemporary art sale in New
York Thursday night, boosted by a hot property from hedge-fund
manager  Steven Cohen .  The founder and chairman of SAC Capital Advisors LP
consigned  Andy Warhol ’s portrait of  Elizabeth Taylor , and the
late screen idol was the star of the evening’s 50-lot sale.  With two telephone bidders dueling for the work, the 40-
inch-square 1963 canvas titled “Liz #5” fetched $26.9 million,
falling within its target range of $20 million to $30 million.  The sale brought in $98.8 million, close to the low end of
the forecast $84.5 million to $121.4 million, and 22 percent of
the lots failed to sell. Still, the total was more than double
the boutique auction house’s tally of a year ago.  “They are definitely the underdog and they are hanging in
there. It’s remarkable,” said Wendy Cromwell, New York art
adviser, comparing Phillips with much bigger players  Sotheby’s (BID) 
and  Christie’s International .  In “Liz #5,” the legendary actress, who died in March, is
depicted with a clownlike red mouth and turquoise eye shadow
that matches the background. The painting used to belong to the
influential art dealer Ileana Sonnabend. Six months after her
death in October 2007, her heirs sold the work to the  Gagosian
gallery  along with other Warhols from her collection.  A Maurice de Vlaminck landscape from Cohen’s collection
sold at Christie’s last week for $22.5 million. Together the two
works brought in $49.4 million.  Another 1963 turquoise “Liz” appeared on the market in
2007. Consigned by actor  Hugh Grant , it fetched $23.6 million at
Christie’s in  New York .  More Warhol  Warhol accounted for four of the top 10 lots; in addition,
his collaboration with  Jean-Michel Basquiat  titled “Third Eye”
was the third-priciest piece at $7 million, more than double its
$3 million high estimate.  The Phillips sale began with a bang when an abstract silver
painting by newly fashionable 27-year-old Jacob Kassay fetched
$290,500, surging past the expected range of $60,000 to $80,000.  “It was shocking,” said art adviser Lowell Pettit. “We
were guilty in participating in that madness.”  A year ago, Kassay’s canvases sold for about $10,000 to
$20,000, depending on size, at Eleven Rivington, the Lower East
Side gallery that represents him.  More established stars, whose estimates were deemed too
aggressive, didn’t fare well. A dark painting of a veiled woman
by Marlene Dumas, estimated at $900,000 to $1.2 million, didn’t
find a buyer.  Hirst Butterflies  Phillips de Pury was the only auction house to include
 Damien Hirst  in its evening lineup. A 2007 butterfly diptych
called “Night Follows Day” was forecast at $1.2 million to
$1.8 million and drew no bids. A 2008 butterfly canvas titled
“Tranquility” matched its low estimate of $1.2 million.  “There’s more connoisseurship in the market,” said
Cromwell. “No one wants to overpay even for the works of great
quality. They want a real deal if they are spending millions of
dollars.”  Phillips de Pury charges buyers 25 percent of the hammer
price up to $50,000, plus 20 percent from $50,000 to $1 million,
plus 12 percent above $1 million.  To contact the reporter of this story:
