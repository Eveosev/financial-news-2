(Corrects that Woods won the tournament in 2001, in final
paragraph.)  Tiger Woods is 5-over par through his
opening five holes at golf’s  Players  championship, his first
event since last month’s Masters Tournament.  Woods is recovering from a left knee injury sustained
during the Masters, where he tied for fourth. He skipped the
Wells Fargo Championship in Charlotte last week due to the
injury.  England ’s Brian Davis leads the tournament at the TPC at
Sawgrass course in Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida, at 4-under par
through seven holes.  Woods, who has fallen to No. 8 in the Official World Golf
Ranking, opened his round with a bogey and then made a triple-
bogey 7 on the par-4 fourth hole. He followed with another bogey
on the par-4 fifth hole and sits in last place among players who
have begun play.  The Players Championship is the richest tournament on the
U.S.  PGA Tour , with a purse of $9.5 million. Woods won the
tournament in 2001.  To contact the reporter on this story:
