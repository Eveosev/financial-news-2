Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) ’s Xbox 360 was the
top-selling video-game console in the U.S. last month, bucking a
software-led decline that saw industry sales slump 10 percent.  Consumers purchased 507,000 Xbox 360 game consoles in June,
said Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft in an e-mailed
statement today, citing industry tracker NPD Group Inc. A year
ago, Microsoft sold 451,700 units.  The company since 2005 has sold 48 percent of all current-
generation consoles in the U.S., it said.  Sony Corp. (6758) , the Tokyo-based maker of the PlayStation 3 and
the PlayStation Portable, did not reveal its hardware sales
numbers. The exclusive PlayStation 3 title “inFamous 2” was
its best-selling game during the month, Patrick Seybold, Sony
Computer Entertainment spokesman, said in an e-mailed statement.  A light slate of new game software and Nintendo Co.’s aging
Wii console contributed to a 10 percent decline in overall
retail sales of $1.03 billion in June,  Port Washington , New
York-based NPD said in an e-mailed statement. The figure doesn’t
include digital sales of games.  Industry hardware sales dropped 9 percent to $366.6
million, and software declined 12 percent to $469.5 million, NPD
reported.  Nintendo Wii  Nintendo did not release sales numbers for its 3DS
handheld, which lets users play 3-D games without the need for
special glasses, or the Nintendo Wii home console. The company
today began letting 3DS users stream Netflix movies and TV
episodes to the device.  Nintendo said in June it was prepping a successor to its
Wii for release in 2012. The Kyoto, Japan-based company has said
it wants to revive home console sales by adding the ability to
play games and watch content in high-definition and a new
tablet-like controller.  “We continue to believe that Nintendo’s HD console is
arriving two years late, given recent momentum for PS3,  Xbox
360 , and their respective peripherals,”  Michael Pachter , an
analyst with Wedbush Securities in  Los Angeles , wrote in a
report July 1. He rates the shares “neutral.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
