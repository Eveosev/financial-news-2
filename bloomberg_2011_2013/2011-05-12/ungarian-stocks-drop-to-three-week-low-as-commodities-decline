Hungarian stocks fell to the lowest
in more than three weeks as commodities dropped amid declining
optimism about the global economic recovery.  The benchmark BUX index slumped 1.5 percent to 23,267.12 by
10:38 a.m. in Budapest, the lowest intraday trading level since
April 18. OTP Bank Nyrt.,  Hungary ’s largest lender, slid 2.1
percent to 6,164 forint. Mol Nyrt., the country’s largest
refiner, fell 1.3 percent to 23,090 forint.  “The first step was taken by commodity prices, followed by
international equities markets,” Balazs Sore, a trader at Buda-
Cash Brokerhaz Zrt., said by phone from Budapest.  Investors have tempered optimism about the global economy
and plan to put more of their money in cash and less in
commodities over the next six months, a Bloomberg survey found.
The decline in commodities yesterday sent the  S&P 500  to a 1.1
percent retreat, the steepest since March 16.  Editors:  To contact the reporter on this story:
