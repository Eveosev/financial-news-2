UniCredit SpA (UCG) , Italy’s biggest bank
and Vienna-based  Raiffeisen Bank International AG (RBI)  are among 14
financial companies that have bought tender documents to broker
Bulgaria’s 33-percent stake sale in an E.ON AG unit.  Other competitors that will probably submit bids by a May
27 deadline include Greece’s second biggest lender  EFG Eurobank
Ergasias SA (EUROB)  and United Bulgarian Bank, a unit of the National
Bank of Greece SA, Bulgaria’s Privatization Agency said in an e-
mail today.  Bulgaria plans to sell this year the minority stake in the
E.ON-operated electricity distributor on the Bulgarian Stock
Exchange. The unit consists of two companies in charge of sales
and grid operation. E.ON controls power distribution in north-
eastern Bulgaria, including the Black Sea city of Varna.  The government plans to sell its minority stakes in all
seven power distributors, which were sold in 2005 to Germany’s
 E.ON AG (EOAN) , Prague-based  CEZ AS (CEZ)  and Austria’s  EVN AG (EVN)  in the run-up
to joining the European Union.  To contact the reporter on this story:
