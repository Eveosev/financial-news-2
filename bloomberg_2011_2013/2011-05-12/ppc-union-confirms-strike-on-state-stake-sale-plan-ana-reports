Greece ’s GENOP-DEH, the labor union
of  Public Power Corp SA (PPC) , the country’s largest electricity
company, will hold rolling 48-hour strikes from the day the
government’s plan to reduce its stake in the company is
submitted to Parliament, state-run Athens News Agency reported.  The rolling strikes, which will last for about 10 days,
will cause blackouts of as long as 3 hours in different areas
throughout Greece, ANA said, citing Nikos Fotopoulos, head of
GENOP.  The labor union had originally decided to begin rolling
strikes on May 15 in order to protest government plans to reduce
its stake in the state-run electricity producer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
