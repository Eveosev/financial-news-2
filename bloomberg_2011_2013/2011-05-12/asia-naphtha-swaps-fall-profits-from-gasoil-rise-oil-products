Asia naphtha swaps dropped the most
in four days on speculation that factories will cut purchases of
petrochemical feedstock as costs rise. Gasoil refining profits
gained while  fuel-oil  losses narrowed.  Light Distillates  Naphtha swaps for June fell 4.2 percent, the biggest
decline since May 6, to $985.25 a metric ton at 10:27 a.m.
Singapore time, according to PVM Oil Associates, a London-based
broker.  The crack spread, a measure of the refining margin for
processing  Brent crude  into the petrochemical feedstock, dropped
to $127.50 a ton from $154.60 at the end of Asian trading
yesterday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The situation in  Japan  will remain “unpredictable” amid
“stagnant” production activity, lower  consumer spending  and
soaring prices of raw materials and fuel, Mitsubishi Chemical
Holdings Corp. said in a statement to the Singapore stock
exchange today.  Operations at the company’s Kashima plant, including two
naphtha crackers, were halted after the March 11 earthquake, the
company said in March.  Middle Distillates  June swaps for gasoil fell $3.20, or 2.5 percent, to
$125.10 a barrel, PVM data showed. Jet fuel’s premium to gasoil,
or the regrade, declined 10 cents to $1.60 a barrel. A narrower
spread means it is less profitable to make  aviation fuel  over
diesel compared with yesterday. The regrade was at $1.70 a
barrel yesterday, the widest since March 4.  Gasoil’s premium to Dubai crude, a measure of processing
profit for the fuel, rose 73 cents, or 4.2 percent, to $18.20 a
barrel, PVM data showed.  Fuel Oil  Fuel oil’s discount to Dubai crude narrowed 93 cents, or
8.8 percent, to $9.63 a barrel, PVM data showed. High-sulfur
fuel oil swaps for June fell $19.50, or 3 percent, to $632.25 a
ton, PVM data showed.  The premium of 180-centistoke fuel oil to 380-centistoke
fuel oil dropped 50 cents to $12 a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
