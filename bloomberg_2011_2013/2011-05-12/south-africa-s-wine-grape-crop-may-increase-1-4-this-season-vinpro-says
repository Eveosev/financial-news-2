South Africa ’s wine grape crop will
be 1.28 million metric tons this season, up 1.4 percent from
last year, according to industry group  VinPro .  The crop will yield 992.5 million liters, including juice
and concentrate for non-alcoholic purposes, wine for brandy and
distilling wine, or 1 percent more than last year, the Western
Cape province-based VinPro said in a report on its website
today, citing estimates of the SA Wine Industry Information &
Systems. The average recovery is calculated at 776 liters for
every ton of grapes, it said.  “What appeared to be a large crop early in the season
systematically shrunk,” it said. Cold weather during flowering,
a windy December and “large-scale” flood damage along the
Orange River curbed production, it said. VinPro says it
represents about 4,500 producers.  South Africa mainly grows white grapes, including Chenin
blanc, Chardonnay and Sauvignon blanc, while red varieties
include Pinotage, a hybrid developed in the country. Italy is
the world’s biggest wine producer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
