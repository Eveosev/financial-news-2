Gamma Civic Ltd. (GML) , Mauritius largest
construction company by market value, fell to its lowest in more
than three weeks after it reported a loss for the third quarter.  The stock declined for a third straight day, dropping 10
rupees, or 2.5 percent, to 390 rupees, by the 1:30 p.m. close in
 Port Louis , its lowest level since April 19.  The company reported a loss of 138.6 million rupees ($5
million) for the third quarter through March compared with a
profit of 224.8 million rupees a year earlier, it said in a
regulatory filing after the market closed yesterday.
