Chile ’s central bank probably will
slow the pace of interest-rate increases today as the currency’s
rally and a lower-than-expected rise in consumer prices last
month help keep inflation expectations in check.  The five-member policy board, led by bank President Jose De Gregorio, will increase the benchmark overnight rate by a
quarter-point to 4.75 percent, according to 14 of 18 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg. Four analysts expect the bank to raise by
a half-point for the third straight month. The decision is
scheduled for release at 6 p.m. New York time.  ECONOMY:
*Chilean investors and traders reduced their estimates for
annual inflation and the benchmark interest rate in a bi-weekly
central bank survey. Policy makers will raise the rate today to
4.75 percent, according to the survey of 53 investors and
traders. In the previous survey, published April 27, they
estimated 5 percent. Annual inflation will reach 3.9 percent in
12 months, yesterday’s survey showed, compared with the previous
4.2 percent forecast.  EQUITIES:
*The Ipsa index fell 0.2 percent to 4,848.89.
*Empresas Hites SA fell 1 percent to 707 pesos. First-quarter
earnings missed expectations, Banchile-Citi, the joint brokerage
unit of Banco de Chile and Citigroup Inc., wrote by e-mail.
*Lan Airlines SA dropped 1 percent to 13,331 pesos.  Latin
America ’s largest airline by market value agreed to buy five new
aircraft from Boeing Co. for $870 million.
*Multiexport Foods SA gained 2.1 percent to 233.74 pesos.
Chile’s largest publicly traded salmon exporter posted a 72
percent increase in first-quarter net income.  MARKETS:
*Chile’s peso sank after  China ’s consumer prices rose faster
than the government’s target, boosting speculation of monetary
tightening and lowering the price of copper, Chile’s biggest
export. The peso lost 0.7 percent to 468.2 per  U.S. dollar .
*Foreign investors in the Chilean peso forwards market had a
$2.4 billion bet against the peso as of May 9, according to
central bank data.
*Interest-rate swap rates fell before today’s rate decision. The
two-year swap rate fell 1 basis point to 5.64 percent. The five-
year fell six basis points to 5.83 percent.
*Six-month breakeven inflation fell for a fourth day, declining
10 basis points to 4.52 percent. Three-month breakeven dipped 21
basis points to 3.59 percent.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
