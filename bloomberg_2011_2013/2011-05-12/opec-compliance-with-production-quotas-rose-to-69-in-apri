The Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries’ compliance with record supply cuts set in
2008 rose last month as output dropped in  Libya ,  Saudi Arabia 
and Angola.  Daily production from the 11 OPEC members that are bound by
quotas was 26.16 million barrels a day last month, the
 International Energy Agency  said today in its monthly report.
That implies a compliance rate of 69 percent in April, according
to Bloomberg calculations. That compares with a revised rate of
64 percent for March, when output was 26.37 million barrels.  OPEC, provider of about 40 percent of the world’s crude,
announced its biggest-ever supply cuts in late 2008 amid a
collapse in global demand. The decision capped production at
24.845 million barrels a day for all members except Iraq, which
is exempt from the quota system.  Production in  Angola  fell to the lowest level in more than
four years because of field maintenance, the IEA said. Nigerian
output rose.  Compliance percentages are based on combined output from
the 11 members that committed to reduce from a base production
rate in September 2008 of 29.045 million barrels a day.  OPEC’s members are Algeria, Angola, Ecuador, Iran, Iraq,
Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab
Emirates and Venezuela.  To contact the reporter on this story:
