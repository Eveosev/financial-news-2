Commercial International Bank Egypt
SAE (COMI) , Egyptâ€™s biggest publicly traded lender, headed for its
biggest loss in three weeks after first-quarter profit tumbled
42 percent.  The shares retreated as much as 2 percent, the most since
April 20. They fell 1.9 percent to 28 Egyptian pounds as of
11:02 a.m. in Cairo. The benchmark EGX 30 Index slipped 0.5
percent.  Net income dropped to 308 million pounds ($52 million) from
528 million pounds a year earlier because of a slowdown in the
economy after a revolt that toppled President  Hosni Mubarak  in
February, the Cairo-based bank said in an e-mailed statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
