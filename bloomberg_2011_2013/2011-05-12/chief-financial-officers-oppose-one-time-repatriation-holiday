Chief financial officers from
 Caterpillar Inc. (CAT) ,  United Technologies Corp. (UTX) ,  Zimmer Holdings
Inc. (ZMH)  and  Kimberly-Clark Corp. (KMB)  said they oppose a one-time
holiday that would let U.S.-based companies bring home profits
at a reduced rate.  The executives, testifying to the House Ways and Means
Committee in Washington today, said they would prefer a
permanent switch to a territorial tax system like that used by
other major industrialized countries. They said that would help
their companies compete worldwide.  Lawmakers such as Texas Republican Representative Kevin Brady and House Majority Leader Eric Cantor of Virginia have
been calling for a one-time holiday that would let companies
bring home more than $1 trillion in profit from outside the
country. They are supported by companies including  Microsoft
Corp. (MSFT)  and  Google Inc. (GOOG)   To contact the reporters on this story:
