South African Reserve Bank Governor
Gill Marcus made the following comments on the rand after a
meeting of the bank’s monetary policy committee in  Pretoria 
today.  “It’s a volatile currency.  “I would be very reluctant to call it strong or weak, when
we are talking about the levels we’re at.  “You can’t say it is weak or strong at the moment because
it depends where you are measuring it against.  “This is not just a rand story, it’s also a dollar story.  “We cannot look at the rand without looking at what’s
happening to the dollar, without looking at what’s happening in
the global market.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
