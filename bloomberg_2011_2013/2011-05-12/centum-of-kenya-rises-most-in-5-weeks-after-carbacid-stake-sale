Centum Investment Co., East Africa’s
biggest investment company, rose for the first time in seven
days after saying it sold its stake in  Carbacid Investments Ltd. (CBIL)   The company’s shares gained 4.5 percent, the most in five
weeks, to close at 23.25 shillings by 3 p.m. in the capital,
Nairobi.  Centum sold its 22 percent stake in Carbacid, a Centum
spokesman who couldn’t be named in line with the company’s
policy, said by phone from Nairobi today.  Centum generated 1.2 billion shillings ($14 million) in
dividends and disposal proceeds since acquiring its 22 percent
share in Carbacid in May 2009, Chief Executive Officer James
Mworia said in an e-mailed statement yesterday. The sale is
meant to raise funds for other investment opportunities, he
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
