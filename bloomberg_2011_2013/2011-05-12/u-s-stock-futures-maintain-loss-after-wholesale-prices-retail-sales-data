U.S. stock-index futures maintained
losses after wholesale costs rose more than forecast in April
and growth in retail sales trailed economists’ estimates.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index expiring in June
lost 0.5 percent to 1,332.30 at 8:33 a.m. in  New York . Dow Jones
Industrial Average futures decreased 0.4 percent to 12,544.  The 0.5 percent increase in retail sales was the smallest
since July, Commerce Department figures showed. Other data
showed the  producer price index  increased 0.8 percent and first-
time jobless claims were 434,000 last week, or 4,000 more than
the median economist estimate in a Bloomberg survey.  The  S&P 500  has fallen 1.6 percent this month, as gauges of
energy and raw-materials producers slumped at least 4.3 percent.
Indexes of companies less-tied to economic growth, including
utilities, health care, consumer staples and phone, outperformed
the benchmark. The S&P 500 is still up 6.7 percent this year
amid government stimulus measures and higher-than-estimated
corporate profits.  Earlier losses in futures came as copper tumbled to a five-
month low in  London  as China raised banks’ reserve requirements
for the fifth time this year  to restrain prices, adding to the
likelihood that growth will slow in the world’s second-biggest
economy.   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
