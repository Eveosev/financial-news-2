Tamweel PJSC (TAMWEEL) , the home finance
company majority owned by  Dubai Islamic Bank PJSC (DIB) , rebounded on
speculation a 19 percent slide in the past two days after a more
than two-year suspension was overdone.  The shares rose 6 percent to 85 fils at the 2 p.m. close in
Dubai, after earlier rising as much as 13 percent. Tamweel
tumbled 19 percent in the first two trading sessions since Nov.
20, 2008.  “Investors started seeing value at current prices,” said
Mohammed Galal, head of foreign institutional sales trading at
HC Securities in Dubai. “Whether it’s sustainable or not is yet
to be seen, but my take is that it’s not, as it seems that the
buyers were mostly looking for a fast buck. Nevertheless, I
don’t think today’s lows will be seen again for the short to
medium term at least.”  Shares of Tamweel and Amlak Finance PJSC, another Dubai-
based Islamic mortgage provider, were halted after the
government announced plans to merge the two companies and inject
money to help them cope with the global financial crisis. They
stopped lending as the crisis froze credit markets and blocked
their access to funding. The merger plan was abandoned in
September after Dubai Islamic Bank increased its stake in
Tamweel.  Dubai Islamic retreated 0.9 percent to 2.16 dirhams.  To contact the reporter on this story:
