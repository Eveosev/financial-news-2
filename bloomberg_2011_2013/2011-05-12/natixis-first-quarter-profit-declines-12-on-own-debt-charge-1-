Natixis (KN)  SA, the investment-banking
unit of  France ’s second-largest bank by branches, reported a
smaller decline in first-quarter profit than analysts’ estimated
after a charge related to an improvement in its own debt.  Natixis rose as much as 2.2 percent in Paris trading after
reporting net income of 412 million euros ($586 million), higher
than the 334 million-euro average estimate of three analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg.  Pretax profit at Natixis’s corporate- and investment-
banking division rose 36 percent in the first quarter to 383
million euros as capital markets revenue increased 12 percent.
Earnings before tax at the investment solutions division, which
includes asset management, insurance, private banking and
private equity, jumped 18 percent to 146 million euros.  Natixis recorded a 108 million-euro accounting charge
resulting from an improvement in the value of its own debt.  The stock was up 5 cents, or 1.3 percent, to 3.95 euros by
10:03 a.m., bringing the gain this year to 13 percent. That
compares with a 1.6 percent advance in the 48-company Bloomberg
Europe Banks and Financial Services Index.  Natixis, which had the biggest net losses of any French
bank from the financial crisis, returned to profit in the second
half of 2009 after cutting more than 10 percent of its
investment-banking jobs and receiving a guarantee from its
parent, Groupe BPCE, on risky assets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
