BCE Inc. (BCE) ,  Canada ’s largest phone
company, reported a 29 percent decline in first-quarter profit
as it lost prepaid customers and didn’t repeat asset-sale gains
it had a year earlier.  Net income fell to C$503 million ($520 million), or 67
cents a share, from C$706 million, or 92 cents, a year earlier,
the Montreal-based company said in a statement today. Profit
excluding some items rose to 72 cents a share, compared with the
analysts’ average projection of 69 cents.  Chief Executive Officer George Cope is trying to sell more
high-end smartphones which tend to generate more data revenue to
narrow the gap with  Rogers Communications Inc. (RCI/B)  Cope is also
trying to ward off new carriers Public Mobile, Wind Mobile and
Mobilicity, which have been aggressively targeting BCE’s Solo
prepaid customers with no-frills, unlimited call plans.  While Bell, BCE’s main consumer brand, added 80,648
contract subscribers in the quarter, the company lost 75,356
prepaid customers last quarter, meaning net customer gains were
5,292 in the quarter.  That missed the 65,000 estimate by Dvai Ghose, an analyst
at Canaccord Genuity in Toronto. Contract-subscriber additions
were “very strong” and the prepaid decline was “much worse”
than expected, said Ghose, who has a "hold" rating on the stock.  BCE rose 24 cents to C$37.18 at 9:41 a.m. on the Toronto
Stock Exchange. Before today, the shares had added 4.5 percent
this year.  In the year-earlier quarter, BCE’s profit included C$272
million from asset sales and other gains.  Full-Year Forecasts  Sales were little changed at C$4.47 billion. Analysts
predicted C$4.48 billion, the average of estimates compiled by
Bloomberg. Bell generated C$51.68 in average revenue per
customer, missing Ghose’s estimate of C$52.03.  BCE boosted full-year forecasts after completing its
acquisition of broadcaster CTV. CTV will probably add 7 cents to
earnings per share in the nine months to the end of 2011 as
higher advertising revenue and better cost management improves
profitability, Cope told analysts on a conference call.  Full-year profit will be C$2.95 to C$3.05 a share, up from
C$2.90 to C$3 a share. Earnings before interest, tax,
depreciation and amortization will climb by 8 percent to 10
percent, an increase from an earlier forecast of growth of 2
percent to 4 percent.  Revenue will probably climb by 9 percent to 11 percent this
year, BCE said, up from a target of 1 percent to 2 percent
growth given in February.  BCE raised its dividend by 5 percent to C$2.07 a share, in
what it said was it’s sixth increase since the end of 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
