U.S. coal is gaining popularity with
European buyers,  Steelguru  said, citing a report from Montel, an
energy news service.  Europe  imported about 29.8 million metric tons from the
U.S. last year, up more than 20 percent compared with 2009,
Steelguru said. That made the U.S. the second-biggest coal
supplier to Europe after  Russia , it added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
