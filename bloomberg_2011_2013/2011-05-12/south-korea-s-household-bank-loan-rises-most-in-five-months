South Korea ’s bank lending to
households rose the most in five months to a record in April as
lower loan rates from banks facing increased competition
encouraged people to take out more mortgages.  Lending to households increased by 2.5 trillion won ($2.3
billion) last month to 436.6 trillion won after a revised gain
of 1.7 trillion won in March, the  Bank of Korea  said in an e-
mailed statement today. It was the third straight month that
loans rose to all-time highs.  South Korea’s swelling household debt may add to policy
makers’ concern about inflationary pressure, which in turn may
prompt the central bank to raise the benchmark  interest rates 
tomorrow for a third time this year. Consumer prices rose 4.2
percent in April, exceeding the bank’s target limit for a fourth
month, after a 4.7 percent gain in March.  Twelve of 14 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News
predicted the bank will raise the policy rate to 3.25 percent
after quarter-point increases in January and March. The decision
will be announced around 9:30 a.m. tomorrow in  Seoul .  Mortgage lending rose 2.4 trillion won to 292.3 trillion
won, today’s report showed. Loans to companies increased 9
trillion won to 538.7 trillion won.  South Korean banks lowered lending rates as they competed
to extend more loans to households, the central bank said in the
statement.  The broadest measure of  money supply , M2, gained 4.3
percent in March from a year earlier, according to a separate
central bank statement. The gauge rose 5 percent in February.  To contact the reporter on this story:
