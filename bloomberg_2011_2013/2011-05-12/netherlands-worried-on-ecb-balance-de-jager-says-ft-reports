Dutch Finance Minister  Jan Kees de Jager  said his country is reviewing the candidacy of  Mario Draghi  as European Central Bank president, the Financial Times
reported. Draghi’s appointment would mean two of the bank’s
executive board members would be Italian, the FT said. “What is
important to us is the balance in the ECB board,” the newspaper
cited de Jager as saying yesterday. “We are worried about
this,” he said, according to the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
