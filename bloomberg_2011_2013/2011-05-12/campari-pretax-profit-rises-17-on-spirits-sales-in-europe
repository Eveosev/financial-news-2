Davide Campari-Milano SpA (CPR) , the maker
of Wild Turkey bourbon, said first-quarter profit rose 17
percent, beating estimates, as it sold more spirits in Europe
and  South America .  Pretax profit rose to 50.5 million euros ($72 million) from
43.3 million euros a year earlier, the Milan-based company said
in a statement today. That was higher the 48 million-euro
average estimate of 11 analysts in a Bloomberg survey.  Campari’s “growth drivers,” aperitifs in Europe and South
America, vodka in the Americas and bourbons in the U.S. and
 Australia , “performed well,” Chief Executive Officer Bob Kunze-Concewitz said in the statement. The company is optimistic
about full-year prospects, he said.  Sales advanced 15 percent to 268.4 million euros. Sales in
 Europe  excluding  Italy  rose almost 40 percent in the first
quarter. Revenue in the Americas increased 16 percent, while
Italian sales slipped 2.9 percent.  Spirits account for about 77 percent of Campari’s revenue
and the weight of sales in Italy, its biggest single market,
declined to 38 percent in the first quarter from 45 percent a
year earlier.  Sales of Aperol spirits jumped 57 percent at constant
exchange rates, led by Germany, Italy and Austria. Campari brand
sales rose 3.5 percent, while Skyy Vodka rose 8.4 percent.  Campari shares rose as much as 2.3 percent, the most in
seven weeks, and traded at 5.04 euros, up 1.5 percent, at 1:28
p.m. in Milan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
