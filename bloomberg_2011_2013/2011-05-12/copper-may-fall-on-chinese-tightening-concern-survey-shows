Copper may fall on concern demand
will weaken as  China , the world’s biggest consumer of the metal,
takes further steps to tackle inflation, a survey showed.  Ten of 16 analysts, investors and traders surveyed by
Bloomberg, or 63 percent, said prices will drop next week. Five
predicted a gain and one forecast little change. Copper for
three-month delivery was down 1.1 percent for this week at
$8,735 a metric ton by 5:15 p.m. yesterday on the  London  Metal
Exchange after reaching the lowest price since Dec. 1.  China yesterday told banks for the fifth time this year to
set aside more cash to restrain prices. Inflation in the country
held above 5 percent in April, exceeding the government’s annual
target and analysts’ estimates, and imports of copper into China
fell 14 percent last month from March, figures showed this week.  “Concerns over tightening measures in China persisting for
the foreseeable future are likely to subdue” demand for copper
and other commodities, said  Charles Cooper , an analyst at Oriel
Securities Ltd. in London.  The red bars on the attached chart are derived by
subtracting bearish forecasts from bullish estimates, with
readings below zero signaling the majority of respondents expect
a decline. The green line shows the copper price. The survey
data shown are as of May 6.  The weekly copper survey has forecast prices accurately in
66 of the past 136 weeks, or 49 percent of the time.  This week’s survey results: Bearish: 10 Bullish: 5 Hold: 1  To contact the reporter on this story:
