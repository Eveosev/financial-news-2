The Philippine peso fell the most in
more than a week after a European Union official warned that a
possible debt restructuring in  Greece  may lead to another credit
crisis, damping demand for emerging-market assets.  South Korea’s won led declines among  Asia ’s most-traded
currencies as the MSCI Asia-Pacific Index of regional shares
slumped 1.6 percent, the biggest loss in two months. “A debt
restructuring in Greece would have major consequences on the
soundness of the banking sector in Greece,” EU Economic and
Monetary Affairs Commissioner  Olli Rehn  said yesterday.  “The worries are coming from Greece’s problems and it is
now risks off,” said Roland Avante, a treasurer at Sterling
Bank of Asia in Manila. “We may see the dollar strengthen as
investors assess the risks.”  The peso dropped 0.5 percent to 43.105 per dollar as of the
4 p.m. close in  Manila , its biggest loss since May 3, according
to Tullett Prebon Plc.  “Such a major banking crisis would lead to a massive
credit crunch,” Rehn said yesterday at the European Parliament
in Strasbourg,  France . “The contraction of the economy would be
unprecedented in Greece.”  Philippine benchmark three-year bonds fell, ending two days
of gains. The yield on the 6.25 percent note due January 2014
climbed five basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 4.875
percent, according to Tradition Financial Services.  To contact the reporter for this story:
