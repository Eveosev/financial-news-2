Republican Meredith Attwell Baker,
who is leaving the Federal Communications Commission to join
 Comcast Corp. (CMCSA) ’s Washington office, didn’t participate in votes
at the agency today.  Baker, 42, who in January voted to let the largest U.S.
cable company buy  NBC Universal , is to leave the agency June 3
to represent NBC Universal in Washington.  “She won’t be participating in consideration of today’s
items,” FCC Chairman  Julius Genachowski , a Democrat, said as
the agency’s monthly meeting in Washington began. He called
Baker “a valued colleague and friend.”  The agency on a 4-0 vote proposed rules for companies to
report outages of Internet services, including telephone calls.
Cable companies led by Philadelphia-based Comcast offer Internet
and calling services.  Baker declined to comment.  #<781974.7730115.2.1.87.23378.96>#
