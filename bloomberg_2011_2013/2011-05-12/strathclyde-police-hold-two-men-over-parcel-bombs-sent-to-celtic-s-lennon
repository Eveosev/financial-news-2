 Strathclyde Police said they have
detained two men over parcel bombs sent to Neil Lennon, coach of
soccer club Celtic.  “Two men are currently being detained by police in
relation to suspect packages,” said a spokeswoman for the
police force in a telephone interview.  Lothian and Borders Police said today they arrested a man
following an attack on Lennon during the second half of his
team’s Scottish Premier League soccer victory over Hearts
yesterday. The assault occurred after Celtic went 2-0 up at
Tynecastle in Edinburgh last night.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
