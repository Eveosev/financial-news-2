Saudi Arabia ’s governor to OPEC
refuted forecasts that the world is running out of oil and said
the “sustainable” long-term price is $70 to $80 a barrel.  “Contrary to some oil pessimists -- because there has been
talk of oil peaks -- the world’s oil resources have actually
increased,” Majid Al-Moneef, Saudi Arabia’s governor to the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, said today in
Brussels. “That’s despite cumulative production that was
close to 500 billion barrels. So the message is that the
resource base is plentiful. So the future is still potentially
promising.”  Oil producers aren’t constrained by supplies or
extraction technologies, Al-Moneed said.  “The problem is not
oil underground,” he said. “It’s the investment climate
needed.”  While crude fell below $100 a barrel this week in  New York 
on concerns about global demand, prices are above what is
sustainable over the long-term, Al-Moneef said.  “Our view has been that a sustainable price over the
long-run is $70-80 per barrel”  To contact the reporter on this story:
