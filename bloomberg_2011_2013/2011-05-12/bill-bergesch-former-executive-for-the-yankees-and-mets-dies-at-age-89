Bill Bergesch, who held a series of
front-office jobs for the  New York Yankees  in four decades, died
two days ago at a retirement home in Stamford, Connecticut, at
the age of 89, the team said.  Bergesch was traveling secretary and stadium manager from
1964 until 1967 and returned to the Major League Baseball team
in 1978 as director of scouting. Two years later, he became vice
president of baseball operations until he resigned in 1984.  From 1991-92, Bergesch was assistant general manager under
Gene Michael and then became a senior adviser in baseball
operations until 1994.  Bergesch, who graduated from Washington University in 1946,
began his baseball career with the  St. Louis Cardinals  in 1947
as general manager for farm teams.  He was assistant general manager of the Kansas City
Athletics before joining the New York Mets organization in 1961,
establishing the team’s farm system and hiring scouts before the
club’s inaugural 1962 season.  Bergesch was general manager of the  Cincinnati Reds  in
1984-87.  To contact the reporter on this story:
