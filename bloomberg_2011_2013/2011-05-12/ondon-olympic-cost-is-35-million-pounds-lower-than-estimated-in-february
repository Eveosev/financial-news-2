The  London  2012 Olympics organizers
said the construction budget will probably come in 35 million
pounds ($57 million) lower than estimated in February.  The anticipated final building cost of the summer Games
will be 7.266 billion pounds, the organizers said today in an e-
mailed statement. The Greater London Authority will make as much
as 12.5 million pounds available to provide facilities to non-
accredited media, to improve accessibility on Londonâ€™s Southbank
and to prepare 8,000 volunteers in the city.  Construction of the sites being used for the Games is about
83 percent complete, with the Olympic Stadium and velodrome
finished, the organizers said today. About 830 million pounds
have been cut since Nov. 2007, when the base budget was
approved, the body said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
