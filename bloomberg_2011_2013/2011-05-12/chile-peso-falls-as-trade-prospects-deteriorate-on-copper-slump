Chile’s peso declined for a second
day as a drop in global commodity prices signaled a reduced
 trade surplus  for the biggest copper-exporting nation.  The peso slid 0.2 percent to 469.28 per  U.S. dollar  at
10:04 a.m. New York time from 468.20 yesterday.  Commodities fell on speculation China will raise  interest
rates  to contain inflation, curbing demand for raw materials.
Copper, which accounts for about half of Chile’s exports, fell
as much as 2.3 percent in London trading.  “It’s a commodity prices story, with copper falling
strongly earlier today,” said Eugenio Cortes, head of currency
forwards at EuroAmerica Corredores de Bolsa SA. “Pension funds
were active dollar sellers yesterday, and they may do the same
today betting that the central bank will increase rates 50 basis
points while the market is expecting a 25-point increase.”  Chile ’s central bank is scheduled to disclose the result of
its monetary policy meeting at 6 p.m. today. The five-member
board will increase the benchmark overnight rate by a quarter-
point to 4.75 percent, according to 14 of 18 economists surveyed
by Bloomberg. Four analysts forecast the bank to raise by a
half-point for the third straight month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
