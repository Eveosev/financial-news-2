China ’s stocks fell, dragging the
benchmark index to a three-month low, after a slump in
commodities raised concern producers’ earnings will decline.  Jiangxi Copper Co. tumbled to the lowest level in more than
seven months. PetroChina Co. and China Shenhua Energy Co., the
biggest oil and coal producers, retreated at least 1.3 percent
after  oil prices  fell below $100 a barrel. Sany Heavy Industry
Co. dropped 2.4 percent after Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said
growth in the machinery industry will weaken. Liquor maker
Kweichow Moutai Co. advanced among consumer stocks on
speculation earnings will weather steps to curb inflation.  The Shanghai Composite Index slid 39.34 points, or 1.4
percent, to 2,844.08 at the 3 p.m. close, the lowest level since
Feb. 11. It dropped 0.3 percent yesterday after official data
showed April inflation exceeded the government’s target. The  CSI
300 Index (SHSZ300)  declined 1.4 percent to 3,101.60.  “The plunge in commodity prices is dragging down markets
all around,” said Tu Jun, a strategist at Shanghai Securities
Co. Inflation data yesterday “boosted investors’ concerns over
more tightening measures and spurred selling,” he said.  The Shanghai Composite has retreated 7 percent from a five-
month high on April 18 amid concern the government will add to
10 increases in lenders’ reserve-ratio requirements and four
rises in  interest rates  since early last year to cool inflation.
The losses pared the gauge’s advance this year to 1.3 percent.
The People’s Bank of China may lift borrowing costs in June or
July, analysts at Shenyin & Wanguo Securities Co., wrote in a
report today.  ‘Underlying Pressure’  Consumer prices increased 5.3 percent in April, the
statistics bureau reported yesterday, exceeding the government’s
full-year target of 4 percent for a fourth straight month.
Clothing costs climbed 1.4 percent in April from a year earlier,
the biggest gain since 1997, the report showed. Non-food
inflation held at 2.7 percent, the fastest pace in at least six
years.  “It is not the time yet for policy makers to ease the
tightening stance as inflation is still elevated and underlying
pressure remains,” said Shen Jianguang, a Hong Kong-based
economist at Mizuho Securities Asia Ltd. “They may not have
that kind of luxury until the third quarter.”  Jiangxi Copper, China’s biggest producer of the metal, slid
3.5 percent to 32.62 yuan, its lowest close since Sept. 30.
 Yunnan Copper Industry Co. (000878) , the fourth largest, declined 3.5
percent to 22.12 yuan. Zhongjin Gold Corp., the country’s
second-largest bullion producer by market value, retreated 3.8
percent to 33.09 yuan.  Oil, Copper  PetroChina sank 1.3 percent to 11.03 yuan. Shenhua lost 1.9
percent to 27.47 yuan. China Coal Energy Co., the nation’s
second-largest coal producer, slipped 2.1 percent to 10.01 yuan.  Crude oil for June delivery tumbled 5.5 percent to $98.21 a
barrel in  New York  yesterday after an Energy Department report
showed U.S. supplies surged. Copper slid 3.2 percent and gold
lost 1 percent in New York on concern China will raise interest
rates and after the dollar gained.  Sany Heavy, China’s biggest maker of machinery for handling
concrete, dropped 2.4 percent to 17.41 yuan. Changsha Zoomlion
Heavy Industry Science & Technology Development Co., China’s
second-biggest maker of concrete-handling machinery, lost 3.3
percent to 14.24 yuan. XCMG Construction Machinery Co., the
publicly traded unit of China’s biggest building equipment
maker, retreated 3.7 percent to 23.67 yuan.  Growth in the construction machinery industry may
decelerate in coming months because reduced infrastructure
investment since last year will lead to weakening demand, Tian Lu, an analyst at Goldman Sachs, wrote in a report today.  ‘Buying Opportunities’  Overly bearish views on China’s growth outlook may create
“buying opportunities” in the second half of the year, Ting Lu, economist at Bank of America Corp.’s Merrill Lynch unit,
wrote in a note to clients today.  The Shanghai Composite is valued at 13.1 times estimated
earnings for this year, lower than the average of 20 times in
the past four years, weekly data compiled by Bloomberg show.  “Despite having a lot of growth, the valuation of the
Chinese market is now a lot more compelling,”  Jim O’Neill , who
oversees $676.9 billion as chairman of Goldman Sachs Asset
Management, told reporters in Hong Kong today. “If in the
second half of this year, the PBOC does stop tightening policy,
you could have a big rally in China.”  A gauge of 19 consumer staples stocks advanced 0.6 percent
today, the only gain among the CSI 300’s 10 industry groups.
Kweichow Moutai, China’s biggest producer of baijiu liquor by
market value, rose 1.1 percent to 187.32 yuan. Tsingtao Brewery
Co., China’s second-biggest brewer by volume, increased 0.7
percent to 34.96 yuan.  Consumer stocks may outperform the broader market in May
and June amid industry rotations as these companies have solid
fundamentals and provide safety, China International Capital
Corp. said in a report dated yesterday.  --Zhang Shidong, Irene Shen. With assistance from Lynn
