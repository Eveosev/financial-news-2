Thailand ’s baht fell, snapping a
three-day gain, as concern  Greece  may not receive additional aid
fast enough to avoid debt restructuring reduced demand for
emerging-market assets.  The baht traded near a one-month low as the MSCI Asia-
Pacific Index of regional shares fell for the first time this
week and the Standard & Poor’s GSCI Index of 24 raw materials
slumped yesterday by the most since May 5. German  Chancellor
Angela Merkel  said this week that Greece needs to stay the
budget-cutting course to win an increase in the 110 billion-euro
($156 billion) lifeline granted a year ago.  “When people are not sure about the situation in  Europe ,
they sell the riskier assets,” said Norawit Suparinayok, a
foreign-exchange trader at Bangkok Bank Pcl. “Commodities and
stocks were sold, while more people bought the dollar as a safe
haven.”  The baht dropped 0.3 percent to 30.17 per dollar as of 8:15
a.m. in Bangkok, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It
declined to 30.27 earlier, near a one-month low of 30.29 reached
on May 6. The currency may trade between 30.05 and 30.25 today,
Norawit said.  The yield on the 3.125 percent bond due December 2015 slid
nine basis points, or 0.09 percentage point, to 3.43 percent.
The onshore one-year interest-rate swap, the fixed cost needed
to receive a floating payment, was unchanged at 3.24 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
