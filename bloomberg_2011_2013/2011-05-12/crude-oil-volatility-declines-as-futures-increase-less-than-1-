Oil options volatility fell as the
underlying futures advanced after U.S. equities gained and the
dollar retreated versus the euro, making commodities more
attractive to investors.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
July, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge
of options prices, was 38.4 percent as of 3:32 p.m. in  New York ,
down from 39.6 percent yesterday.  Crude oil for June delivery rose 76 cents to settle at
$98.97 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . The move of
0.8 percent was the first of less than 1 percent since May 2.  The most active contracts in electronic trading today were
June $90 puts, with 8,962 lots changing hands. They fell 21
cents to 20 cents a barrel at 3:56 p.m. in New York. June $95
puts, the next-most active option, dropped 49 cents to 74 cents
a barrel with 4,051 lots trading. One contract covers 1,000
barrels of crude.  Nymex distributes real-time data for electronic trading and
releases information on floor trading, where the bulk of options
trading occurs, the next business day.  June $100 puts were the most active options traded in the
previous session, with 12,519 lots changing hands. They rose
$2.50 to $3.34 a barrel. The next-most active option, July $90
