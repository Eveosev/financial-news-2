Copper rebounded from a five-month
low on bets that demand will revive in  China , the world’s
largest metal buyer.  Stockpiles monitored by the Shanghai Futures Exchange fell
for seven straight weeks to the lowest since December. Futures
may climb to a record in the second half of 2011 as inventories
accumulated in 2009 dwindle, BNP Paribas SA has said. Copper
prices dropped 7.1 percent in the two months ended April 29 on
concern that tightening credit in China would curb metal demand.  “Fundamentals have not deteriorated to the extent that the
price falls seem to suggest,” Yingxi Yu, a commodity analyst at
 Barclays Capital , said in a report. “With industry inventories
low and consumers living from hand to mouth, price dips should
be viewed as a buying opportunity.”  Copper futures for July delivery rose 5.7 cents, or 1.5
percent, to close at $3.9705 a pound at 1:15 p.m. on the Comex
in  New York , the biggest gain since April 20. Earlier, the price
touched $3.8535, the lowest for a most-active contract since
Dec. 1.  The metal has climbed 25 percent in the past year, reaching
a record $4.6575 on Feb. 15, as mining companies struggled to
keep pace with rising consumption.  On the  London  Metal exchange, copper for delivery in three
months climbed $30, or 0.3 percent, to $8,730 a metric ton
($3.96 a pound).  Aluminum, tin and lead also rose in London. Zinc fell, and
nickel was unchanged.  To contact the reporter on this story:
