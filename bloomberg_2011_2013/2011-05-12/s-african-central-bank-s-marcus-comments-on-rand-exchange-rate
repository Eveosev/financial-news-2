South African Reserve Bank Governor
Gill Marcus made the following comments on the rand after a
meeting of the bank’s monetary policy committee in  Pretoria 
today.  “Since the last meeting of the MPC, the exchange rate of
the rand has been relatively volatile.  “The relatively strong rand exchange rate persisted,
despite continued purchases of foreign exchange by the bank.  “Strong commodity prices, a narrower current account
deficit and the resumption of portfolio flows to South Africa”
have also supported the rand.  To contact the reporter on this story:
