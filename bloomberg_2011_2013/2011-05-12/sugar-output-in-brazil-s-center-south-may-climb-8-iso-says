Sugar output in Brazil’s main
producing region may climb about 8 percent in the current crop
year as more cane is used to make the sweetener instead of
ethanol, the  International Sugar Organization  said.  Production in the Center South may advance to 36.2 million
metric tons in the 2011-12 crop year started in April from 33.6
million tons in the prior period, Leonardo Bichara, a senior
economist at the London-based ISO, said by phone today. The
portion of cane directed to sugar production will increase to 48
percent from 45 percent, he said.  “Sugar production will rise, as demand for ethanol will be
stable,” Bichara said.  Production of the biofuel will decline 3.6 percent to 24.39
billion liters (6.4 billion gallons) from 25.3 billion liters in
the previous period, the ISO estimated.  “The price of ethanol in Brazil will continue to be capped
by the price of gasoline in the country, while sugar prices may
rise depending on market conditions,” Bichara said. “Exports
of the biofuel will also fall.”  Brazil  is the world’s largest producer of sugar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
