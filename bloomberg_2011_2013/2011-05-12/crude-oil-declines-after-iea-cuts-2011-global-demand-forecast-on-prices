Oil declined in  New York  after the
 International Energy Agency  trimmed its 2011 global oil demand
forecast for the first time as this year’s price rally begins to
weigh on consumption.  The Paris-based adviser reduced its estimate for worldwide
fuel consumption by 190,000 barrels a day, or 0.2 percent, in
its monthly market report today. Demand for gasoline in the U.S.
will drop this year as prices at the pump compel motorists to
drive less during the typical peak summer months, the IEA said.  “High oil prices have finally begun to dent demand,” the
agency said. “Four dollar a gallon is likely to yield an anemic
U.S. driving season. This is the main change to our demand
forecast - a weaker 2011 profile in  North America .”  Oil for June delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange
fell as much as $1.53, or 1.6 percent, to $96.68 a barrel and
was at $97.23 at 9:29 a.m.  London  time. Brent oil for June
settlement was down 67 cents at $111.90 a barrel on the ICE
Futures Europe exchange in London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
