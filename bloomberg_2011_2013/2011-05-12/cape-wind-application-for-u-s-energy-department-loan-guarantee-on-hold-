Cape Wind Associates LLC, the
developer of a 468-megawatt offshore wind farm in  Massachusetts ,
said the U.S. Energy Department will not move forward with its
application for a loan guarantee.  The company’s application has been placed “on hold until
further resources can be made available to the program,”
Boston-based Cape Wind said today in an e-mailed statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
