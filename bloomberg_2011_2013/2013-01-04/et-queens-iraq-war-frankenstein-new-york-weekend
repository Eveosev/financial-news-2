This is your last chance to see
“Bernini Sculpting in Clay.” With a horde of assistants,
Bernini masterminded an astonishing array of marble figures,
portraits, tombs, monuments and fountains that are the
magnificent centerpieces of churches and piazzas all over  Rome .  The tabletop-scale terracotta sculptures are so tactile you
think the great man has just stepped away for a glass of
prosecco and a ham sandwich.  Today, 9:30 a.m. to 9 p.m. and tomorrow, 9:30 a.m. to 5:30
p.m. at the  Metropolitan Museum  of Art, 1000 Fifth Ave.  Information: +1-212-535-7710;  http://www.metmuseum.org .  After, swing by Jean Georges Vongerichten’s The Mark for a
musky black-truffle-and-brie cheeseburger. Information: +1-212-
606-3030;  http://www.themarkrestaurantnyc.com .  Found Metals  Or head south to Chelsea, where eleven majestic works by
Ghana-born artist El Anatsui, some still for sale, are on view
at Jack Shainman Gallery. Their color tones vary mostly between
gold and silver, with traces of reds, blues and yellows.  When you get closer, you see that what looks like a
precious tapestry is actually composed of found metals,
including bottle caps and copper wire.  “El Anatsui: Pot of Wisdom” runs through Jan. 19 at 513
W. 20th St. Information: +1-212-645-1701;

city’s best Vesper martini and a plate of Michelin-starred
spaghetti with jalapenos, scallions and Dungeness crab.

in “Water By the Spoonful,” Quiara Alegria Hudes’s drama about
a Marine who returns to his Puerto Rican family with wounds both
physical and psychic. The middle play in a trilogy about her
cousin Elliot, “Spoonful” won the Pulitzer Prize for Drama
last year. Times Square’s adventurous Second Stage Theatre is
presenting the  New York  premiere; in previews now, it opens Jan.
8. At 305 W. 43rd St.  Information: +1-212-246-4422;  http://www.2st.com .  In the same neighborhood, tonight is a rare chance to hear
jazz legend Frank Wess, who played saxophone and flute with
Count Basie’s orchestra. Listen to his recent recording of
“Lush Life” for evidence that his tone and taste have only
deepened over the years.  At Birdland, 315 W. 44th St. Information: +1-212-581-3080;

fantastical sci-fi theater from a group called Radiohole. Co-
sponsored by The Kitchen and Performance Space 122’s COIL
festival, the show draws on the Frankenstein films, Mary
Shelley’s novel and various other cultural artifacts, for what
promises to be a strange, if brief (just an hour long) journey.
