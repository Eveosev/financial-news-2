Manchester City manager  Roberto Mancini  says his training ground altercation with  Mario Balotelli  won’t influence the Italian striker’s future with the
Premier League champion.  Photographs published yesterday showed Mancini, 48, and
Balotelli being separated by coaches and players during
practice. Mancini was shown grabbing the 22-year-old player’s
jersey.  “I think the photos show the worst of what happened,”
Mancini told reporters today. “It was nothing special. There
was no fight, this was not true.”  The City manager confirmed reports in the Manchester
Evening News and other newspapers saying the incident was
sparked by a late tackle by Balotelli on a teammate.  “I said to him, ‘Go inside, leave the pitch.’ He said no
and I took his shirt and pushed him out of the pitch,” Mancini
said. Balotelli hasn’t commented on the incident.  The player’s future at City had been the subject of
speculation even before the clash following other controversies
since his transfer from  Inter Milan  in 2010. Mancini said his
thoughts about Balotelli “do not change”.  Balotelli hasn’t played for the team since being
substituted seven minutes after halftime in the 3-2 home defeat
to Premier League leader Manchester United on Dec. 9.  To contact the reporter on this story:
