Natural gas futures climbed from a
14-week low in  New York  after a government report showed a
larger-than-forecast decline in U.S. stockpiles.  Gas rose 2.8 percent after the Energy Department said U.S.
stockpiles fell 135 billion cubic feet last week to 3.517
trillion, exceeding the five-year average drop for the week of
111 billion.  Analyst estimates  compiled by Bloomberg showed an
expected decline of 130 billion.  “It’s a pretty big number,” said Bob Yawger, director of
the futures division at Mizuho Securities USA Inc. in New York.
“We should be supported here for a couple of days.”  Natural gas for February delivery gained 8.9 cents to
settle at $3.287 per million British thermal units on the  New
York Mercantile Exchange . Trading volume of 230,181 contracts at
3:22 p.m. was down 25 percent from the 100-day average. The
futures yesterday fell to $3.198, the lowest settlement price
since Sept. 26.  Gas prices  have risen 6.2 percent from a year
ago and dropped 5.2 percent this week.  March $2.75 puts were the most active options in electronic
trading on the Nymex. They fell 1.2 cents to 1.8 cents per
million Btu on volume of 1,070 lots at 3:11 p.m. February $3.50
calls rose 1.3 cents to 4.4 cents. Calls accounted for 54
percent of volume.  A gas  surplus  to the five-year average fell to 12.4 percent
in the week ended Dec. 28 from 12.8 percent the previous week,
the department said. Supplies were 0.7 percent above year-
earlier levels, down from 2.3 percent.  U.S. Weather  Temperatures will be below normal in the western half of
the U.S. from Jan. 13 through Jan. 17 and more seasonal in the
Midwest, according to WSI Corp. in Andover,  Massachusetts .  While there is a potential for milder weather in mid-
January that may reduce heating demand, “there are a lot of
bullish fundamentals in this market,” Aaron Calder, senior
market analyst at Gelber & Associates in Houston, said in a note
to clients yesterday.  Lower gas prices are spurring fuel switching from coal at
electricity generators while above-normal outages at nuclear
plants translate to an additional 10 billion cubic feet of gas
burned a week, he said.  Output from nuclear  power plants  slid 63 megawatts to
94,245 megawatts today, down 3.1 percent from a year ago and the
lowest level for this time of year since 2008.  Reactor maintenance shutdowns or other unplanned work may
increase consumption of natural gas and coal to generate
electricity.  Price Outlook  Gas futures may have a “sluggish price recovery ahead
given the relative stability in domestic production and limited
prospect for demand growth,” Teri Viswanath, director of
commodities strategy at BNP Paribas SA in New York, said in a
note to clients today. She said prices may head toward $3 by the
end of the month if predictions for milder weather in the
eastern U.S. hold.  The number of  rigs drilling  for gas rose by 8 this week to
439, the most since Sept. 21, according to a Baker Hughes Inc.
report today.  Gas production  will rise 0.5 percent in 2013 to average
69.59 billion cubic feet a day in 2013, the department said in
its Dec. 11  Short-Term Energy Outlook . Daily output rose to an
all-time high of 69.22 billion cubic feet a day in 2012, up 4.5
percent from a year earlier.  Production gained as drilling technologies, such as
hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, made it more economical to
extract gas from shale deposits such as the Marcellus in the
Northeast. The U.S. produced 83 percent of its energy in the
first nine months of 2012, on track to be the highest level
since 1991, department data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
