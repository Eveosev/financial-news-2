Manchester United striker  Wayne
Rooney  will miss an additional two weeks with a knee injury, the
English Premier League leaders said today.  The England player will miss tomorrow’s F.A. Cup match at
West Ham as well as a home league game against Liverpool the
following weekend, the club said today on its website. The 27-
year-old hasn’t played since Dec. 23, when United drew 1-1 at
Swansea.  “The injury is nothing serious,” manager  Alex Ferguson 
said in the statement. “He just got clipped behind his knee.
Nothing shows in the scan, but he’s still feeling it. Hopefully
in two weeks it’ll be sorted but nonetheless it’s a loss.”  Winger Nani will start training today and defender  Phil
Jones  will be available for the West Ham match after both
recovering from injuries, the team said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
