Canadian  stocks  were little changed
as gold sank to a four-month low after better-than-expected U.S.
jobs data, while technology and financial shares rose.  Kinross Gold Corp. and Agnico-Eagle Mines Ltd. slipped at
least 1.6 percent as the price of the metal fell.  Lululemon
Athletica Inc. (LLL) , the yoga apparel retailer, dropped 5.2 percent
after analysts with Credit Suisse cut the stock’s rating on
sales concerns. Toronto-Dominion Bank and Bank of Nova Scotia
advanced at least 0.3 percent.  The  Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index (SPTSX)  fell 2.59 points,
or less than 0.1 percent, to 12,467.85 at 10:15 a.m. in Toronto.
The benchmark gauge has risen 1.1 percent this week.  U.S. payrolls rose by 155,000 workers last month, ahead of
economists’ expectations, Labor Department figures showed today
in  Washington . The unemployment rate held at 7.8 percent after
the November figure was revised up from a previously reported
7.7 percent.  Federal Reserve minutes released yesterday showed a divide
among Fed members on how long the monthly bond purchases should
last, sending the U.S. dollar higher. Gold futures are down for
a sixth week, the longest run since May 2004.  Canada ’s unemployment rate fell to a four-year low of 7.1
percent in December and employment rose by 39,800, according to
data released by Statistics Canada today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
