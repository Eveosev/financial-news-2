Peru ’s central bank bought the most
dollars in 11 weeks as foreign direct investment keeps the sol
trading at a 16-year high.  The monetary authority said on its website it bought $100
million in the  spot market  and paid an average 2.5455 soles per
 U.S. dollar . It last purchased that much on Oct. 22.  Record investment from abroad and demand for the country’s
bonds has spurred demand for soles, leading the central bank to
buy $13.9 billion in the spot market last year to curb
appreciation. The bank increased lenders’ reserve requirements
for a fifth time last year on Dec. 30 to limit  money supply .  Policy makers were probably “expecting some reaction to
the reserve requirement change but the market didn’t care much
about that so they had to step up intervention,” said  Pedro Tuesta , a Washington-based Latin America economist at 4Cast Inc.
“It’s very hard for the central bank. There’s not much more
they can do. They’ll keep buying dollars.”  The sol appreciated 0.1 percent 2.5455 per U.S. dollar at
today’s close, according to Deutsche Bank AG’s local unit.
That’s the strongest level since October 1996,  data  from Peru’s
financial regulator show.  Foreign direct investment in Peru probably rose 35 percent
to $11.1 billion last year from 2011, the central bank said in a
Dec. 14 report.  Mining companies needing soles to pay local taxes in the
first quarter are buying local currency now on the expectation
appreciation will continue, said Gonzalo Navarro, the head
trader at Banco Santander SA in  Lima , in an e-mailed note to
clients.  The yield on the nation’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol-
denominated bond due August 2020 increased one basis point, or
0.01 percentage point, to 3.89 percent, according to prices
compiled by Bloomberg. The price fell 0.07 centimo to 125.62
centimos per sol.  To contact the reporter on this story:
