Yields on 10-year U.K. government
bonds exceeded those on similar-maturity French bonds for the
first time in more than 20 months, signaling rising borrowing
costs for the government of Prime Minister  David Cameron .  The rate on the U.K.’s benchmark government securities rose
five basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 2.118 percent at
8:54 a.m. London time, compared with a 2.116 percent yield on
10-year  French bonds . That’s the first time since April 11,
2011, that U.K. yields have surpassed those of France, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg and based on closing prices.  “It means having to pay more for debt so that’s a
problem” for the U.K., said  Neil Jones , head of European hedge
fund sales at Mizuho Corporate Bank Ltd. in London. “Gilts are
deemed a safe haven, so I would suggest to an extent this is
gilts being sold as an unwinding of the safe-haven trade.”  The yield on 10-year gilts has  risen  29 basis points this
week, the most since the five-day period ending March 16,
signaling the U.K. government will have to pay more to finance
its budget deficit even as Chancellor of the Exchequer  George Osborne  extends his austerity program.  The U.K. is rated AAA with a negative outlook at  Standard &
Poor’s , Moody’s Investors Service and Fitch Ratings, while
France was stripped of its top grade by S&P and Moody’s last
year. Since the S&P move on Jan. 13, French bonds have returned
9.3 percent, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes,
outperforming gilts’ 0.5 percent gain.  “We get a daily verdict on the credibility of our economic
policy from bond investors,” Osborne told parliament on Dec. 5.  The global  bond market  disagreed with Moody’s and S&P’s
ratings more often than not last year. Yields on sovereign
securities moved in the opposite direction from what the
companies suggested in 53 percent of the 32 upgrades, downgrades
and changes in credit outlook, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  That compares with the longer-term average of 47 percent,
based on more than 300 changes since 1974.  To contact the reporter on this story:
