The Czech  Constitutional Court  ruled
that the country’s first direct presidential elections may take
place next week after reviewing a complaint filed by a candidate
excluded from the vote.  The court, based in Brno, the  Czech Republic ’s second-
largest city, said today that the first round of elections may
be held Jan. 11-12 as planned, spokeswoman Jana Pelcova said by
phone today. The court earlier reviewed a complaint from Tomio
Okamura, who was excluded from the vote.  Okamura was eliminated from running for president after the
 Interior Ministry  said he failed to collect the 50,000
signatures needed to run. Okamura asked the court on Dec. 27 to
postpone the election and eliminate the condition for candidates
who weren’t nominated by the party to collect 50,000 support
votes ahead of the ballot. He was eliminated along with Vladimir
Dlouhy after the ministry said some of the signatures the
candidates presented weren’t valid.  The president, whose responsibilities include appointing
members to the central bank’s policy making board, was
previously elected for a five-year term by lawmakers. President
Vaclav Klaus’s second term in office ends in March. Leading
candidates for the post are former prime ministers Milos Zeman
and Jan Fischer, according to latest opinion polls.  To contact the reporter on this story:
