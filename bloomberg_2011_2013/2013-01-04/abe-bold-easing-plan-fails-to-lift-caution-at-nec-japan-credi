Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s
plans for “bold” monetary easing won’t tempt  NEC Corp. (6701)  and
 Fujifilm Holdings Corp. (4901)  to borrow more this year as sluggish
global demand outweighs the appeal of record-low interest rates.  Outstanding loans  at Japan’s 11 biggest banks fell 0.1
percent to 195.1 trillion yen ($2.22 trillion) in November,
bringing their three-year decline to 6 percent, according to
 Bank of Japan (8301)  data. Kenji Sukeno, Fujifilm’s vice president in
charge of financing, said costs are already close to zero and
there is no need to borrow more as the company is holding
investments unchanged due to  Europe ’s debt crisis.  “It’s doubtful more monetary easing can lower the rates
much further,” Sukeno said Dec. 20 in an interview with
 Bloomberg News  at the office-equipment maker’s  Tokyo 
headquarters. “The going concern now is the extent to which the
European economy can recover.”  That pessimism doesn’t bode well for Abe, who won a
landslide election victory last month on a pledge the central
bank would adopt unlimited cash printing and a 2 percent
inflation target. The BOJ plans a  15 trillion yen infusion  of
low-cost loans to banks starting June to help turn around an
economy headed for its third quarterly contraction.  Interest rates  averaged a record low 0.79 percent in the
first 10 months of 2012, BOJ data show. That compares with an
average 266 basis-point spread over the London interbank offered
rate for U.S. dollar loans in Asia outside of Japan.  “The  interest rates  won’t be sufficient to spur corporate
borrowing,” Tsuyoshi Ueno, a senior economist at NLI Research
Institute, said in a telephone interview from Tokyo. “The
uncertainty over where the global economy is headed is a huge
factor” in determining credit demand, Ueno said.  Corporate Bonds  Elsewhere in domestic credit markets, Japanese companies
raised 8.22 trillion yen in bond offerings last year, little
changed from 8.27 trillion yen in 2011, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Sales of yen-denominated notes by
overseas borrowers, known as Samurai, dropped 6.7 percent to
1.995 trillion yen in the period, after rising 4 percent from
2010, the data show.  Corporate bonds in Japan returned 1.3 percent in 2012,
compared with a 1.8 percent gain for the nation’s sovereign debt
and 4.7 percent for Samurais, according to Bank of America
Merrill Lynch indexes. Company notes worldwide returned 10.8
percent.  The benchmark  10-year bond yield  rose 3 1/2 basis points,
or 0.035 percentage point, to 0.83 percent today, the most since
Sept. 13. Yields fell 18 1/2 basis points last year. The yen
traded at 87.76 against the dollar at 2:53 p.m. in Tokyo, from
76.91 at the end of 2011.  Sovereign Risk  Five-year credit-default swaps insuring  Japan ’s sovereign
debt were at 75.5 basis points yesterday, according to data
provider CMA, which is owned by McGraw-Hill Cos. The contracts,
which ranged from 66.5 to 154.1 last year, fell 61.5 basis
points in 2012, the first yearly drop since 2006, the data show.
The swaps pay the buyer face value in exchange for the
underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet debt
agreements.  Capital spending  in Japan increased 2.2 percent in the
quarter ended Sept. 30, decelerating from 7.7 percent in the
previous three months to the slowest pace in a year, the
Ministry of Finance said last month. Japanese companies are
becoming more cautious as global economic woes reduced exports
to Europe and  China , the ministry said at the time.  Spending Freeze  NEC’s expenditures, forecast to increase 19 percent in the
year ending March 31, 2013, will probably remain unchanged at 50
billion yen over the next period, Chief Financial Officer Isamu Kawashima said in an interview in Tokyo on Nov. 27. The company
is focusing on paying down debt, Kawashima said.  The Tokyo-based maker of  laptop computers  and software
solutions has 70 billion yen of  bonds maturing  by September,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. NEC hasn’t sold notes
since June 2011, even though its  average weighted coupon  is 0.9
percent, the data show.  Fujifilm expects  capital spending  to remain little changed
at about 100 billion yen for the fiscal year ending March 2014,
after increasing outlays 21 percent in the 12 months to March
31, 2013, Sukeno said. Most of the expenditures will go toward
covering depreciation costs, he said.  The copier maker raised 130 billion yen in its first
offering of non-convertible bonds Nov. 27, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The three-tranche sale included 60
billion yen of 0.33 percent five-year notes priced at a 15
basis-point spread, the data show.  “If there is an acquisition opportunity offering
attractive synergies, we may consider it,” Sukeno said. “There
are no plans for big spending in the meantime.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
