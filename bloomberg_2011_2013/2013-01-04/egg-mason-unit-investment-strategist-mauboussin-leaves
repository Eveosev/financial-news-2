Michael Mauboussin, chief investment
strategist at the Legg Mason Inc. unit that’s home to Bill
Miller, left the firm this week.  Mauboussin, who had been at Legg Mason Capital Management
since 2004, departed Jan. 2 and there are no plans to replace
him,  Mary Athridge , a spokeswoman for Baltimore-based Legg
Mason, said today in an e-mail. Mauboussin is promoting his new
book “The Success Equation: Untangling Skill and Luck in
Business, Sports and Investing” (Harvard Business Review Press,
320 pages, $27).  Legg Mason Capital Management attracted investors as Miller
beat the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index in his flagship  Legg Mason
Capital Management Value Trust (LMVTX)  for a record 15 straight years
through 2005 by picking inexpensive financial shares and out-of-
favor technology companies. The fund lost 55 percent in the 2008
credit crisis, prompting withdrawals after assets peaked at $21
billion. Miller stepped down from the $2.2 billion Value Trust
in April, while staying as manager of the $1 billion Legg Mason
Capital Management Opportunity Trust.  Mauboussin’s departure was reported yesterday by investment
research firm  Morningstar Inc. (MORN)   To contact the reporter on this story:
