Palm oil  advanced on speculation that
a new export tax structure in  Malaysia , the second largest
producer, will help to boost shipments in the first quarter,
paring record stockpiles.  The contract for March delivery climbed as much as 0.9
percent to 2,495 ringgit ($819) a metric ton on the Malaysia
Derivatives Exchange, and ended the morning session at 2,481
ringgit. Futures are heading for a 0.6 percent loss this week.  Malaysia said Dec. 17 it will allow crude palm oil exports
at zero duty in January as the second-largest producer seeks to
reduce stockpiles that drove prices to a three-year low last
month. Futures lost 23 percent last year as  inventories  gained
for five straight months, reaching a record 2.56 million tons in
November, according to the Malaysian Palm Oil Board.  “The most important thing people are paying attention to
is how exports are going to be for January, February and
March,” said Chandran Sinnasamy, head of trading at LT
International Futures Sdn. in  Kuala Lumpur . “Export estimates
from Intertek and SGS on the 10th may give a rough idea whether
the exports have improved with the new tax in Malaysia.”  Exports fell 5.7 percent to 1.57 million tons in December
from 1.66 million tons a month earlier, surveyor Intertek said
Dec. 31. Shipments dropped 7.9 percent to 1.52 million tons in
the same period, Societe Generale de Surveillance estimated.
Palm oil will trade sideways as concerns over high stockpiles in
Malaysia and Indonesia still weigh on the market, said Chandran.  Palm oil for May delivery advanced 1.4 percent to 7,022
yuan ($1,127) a ton on the  Dalian Commodity Exchange .  Soybean
oil  for May rose 1.5 percent to 8,740  yuan  a ton.  Soybeans for March delivery gained 0.3 percent to $13.9025
a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade. Soybean oil for delivery
in March was little changed at 50.68 cents a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
