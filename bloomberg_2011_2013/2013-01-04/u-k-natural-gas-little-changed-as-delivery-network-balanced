U.K. natural gas for same-day
delivery traded little changed as the grid operator predicted a
balanced delivery network amid the lowest seasonal demand for
almost a decade.  Day-ahead and  next-month gas  advanced, according to broker
data compiled by Bloomberg. The delivery system will contain 345
million cubic meters of gas at 6 a.m. tomorrow, up from 341
million 24 hours earlier,  National Grid Plc (NG/)  data show.  Within-day gas  traded at 62.5 pence a therm at 8:49 a.m.
London time. February gas rose 0.3 percent to 66.45 pence a
therm. That’s equivalent to $10.67 per million British therms,
units and compares with $3.21 per million Btu of front-month
U.S. gas.  Demand in the 24 hours to 6 a.m. tomorrow will probably be
239 million cubic meters, the lowest for the time of year since
at least 2004, National Grid data show.  Imports from  Norway , the U.K.’s largest source of imported
gas, were at a rate of 99 million cubic meters a day, compared
with as much as 125 million yesterday.  Gas accounted for 24 percent of U.K. power production at
8:50 a.m., National Grid data show. Coal generated 45 percent,
nuclear 20 percent and wind 5.6 percent.  Electricity for the next working day climbed 5 percent to
47.35 pounds a megawatt-hour, broker data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
