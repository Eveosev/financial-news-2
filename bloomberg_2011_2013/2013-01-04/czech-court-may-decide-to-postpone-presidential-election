The Czech  Constitutional Court  may
decide today to reschedule the country’s first direct
presidential election planned for next week as it reviews a
complaint filed by a candidate excluded from the vote.  The court, based in Brno, the  Czech Republic ’s second-
largest city, should announce whether the elections will take
place as planned on Jan. 11-12 or will be moved to a later date
because of Tomio Okamura’s complaint, Jana Pelcova, the court’s
spokeswoman, said by phone today. Okamura was eliminated from
running for the post after the  Interior Ministry  said he failed
to collect the 50,000 signatures needed to run.  Okamura asked the court in a Dec. 27 complaint to postpone
the election and eliminate the condition for candidates who
weren’t nominated by any party to collect 50,000 support votes
ahead of the ballot. Okamura was eliminated along with Vladimir
Dlouhy after the ministry said some of the signatures the
candidates presented weren’t valid.  The president, whose responsibilities include appointing
members to the central bank’s policy-making board, was
previously elected for a five-year term by lawmakers. President
Vaclav Klaus’s second term in office ends in March. Leading
candidates for the post are former prime ministers Milos Zeman
and Jan Fischer, according to latest opinion polls.  To contact the reporter on this story:
