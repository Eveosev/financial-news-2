Kiev’s Boryspil International Airport
warned Aerosvit, a private Ukrainian airline, that it will cease
servicing the carrier’s flights next week if it fails to pay
debts by that time.  Boryspil today received a partial advance payment from
Aerosvit for its services in the coming days and guarantees of
forthcoming payment, the airport said on its website.  Aerosvit’s outgoing flights from Boryspil will not have
ground service beginning on Jan. 9 if it fails to pay remaining
service fees, according to the statement. The airport said
earlier flights would be canceled shortly after noon as no
advance payments were made.  The Kiev regional economic court started bankruptcy
procedures against Aerosvit on Dec. 29, according to the  website 
of the national registry for court decisions. Aerosvit has
outstanding debt of 4.27 billion hryvnia ($520 million) as of
Dec. 27, which it does not dispute, according to the court’s
statement on the website. The company’s assets are worth 1.47
billion hryvnia as of Nov. 30, the court stated.  Aerosvit spokesman Serhiy Kutsyi did not answer his office
phone when called by Bloomberg today.  Hundreds of passengers whose flights were delayed crowded
Boryspil airport today, local television Channel 5 reported.  Aerosvit was founded in 1994 and by 2012 was operating 80
international routes in 34 countries, according to its website.
It operates 28 Boeing aircraft and uses Airbus aircraft of its
partners.  To contact the reporter on this story:
