A state agency will acquire most of
the water assets held by Aqua Utilities  Florida  and Crystal
River Utilities, units of  Aqua America Inc. (WTR) , the Gainesville Sun
reported, citing the Florida Government Utility Authority.  The 6-county government group paid $49.2 million for the
water systems in 12 Florida counties, the newspaper said, citing
a news release last week.  Documents on the Sumter County government website indicate
Aqua America, the second-largest publicly traded water company
in the U.S., wanted out because it had been forced to raise
rates beyond what customers would tolerate, the paper reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
