Steve Wynn, founder and chief
executive officer of  Wynn Resorts Ltd. (WYNN) , terminated an option to
buy a two-acre tract on the company’s Las Vegas golf course in
return for the right to buy any or all of its aircraft.  The aircraft purchase option may be exercised upon 30 days
written notice and at a price equal to their book value, Las
Vegas-based Wynn Resorts said in a  regulatory filing  today.  The option for the jets will terminate when Wynn’s
employment agreement with the company ends, according to the
filing. The deal was approved by the audit committee of the
board of directors.  Wynn, operator of casino resorts in Las Vegas and Macau,
 gained  1.2 percent to $120.78 at the close in New York. The
stock rose 1.8 percent last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
