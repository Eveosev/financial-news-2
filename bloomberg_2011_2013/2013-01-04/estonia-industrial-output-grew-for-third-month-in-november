Estonian  industrial production  grew
for a third month in November, bolstering arguments that the
Baltic economy’s expansion accelerated in the final quarter of
2012.  Production rose 6.5 percent from a year earlier, compared
with a revised 0.3 percent increase in October, the statistics
office based in the capital, Tallinn, said today on its website.  Industrial output in the newest euro-area member has see-
sawed in recent months as export demand for electronics, wood
and food processing improved after a weak first half. Still,
growth in the $22 billion economy probably slowed to 2.9 percent
last year from 8.3 percent in 2011 as  Europe ’s debt crisis
curbed Nordic demand, the central bank said last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
