U.S. stocks  rallied for the week,
sending benchmark indexes to their biggest gains in 13 months,
as lawmakers passed a bill averting spending cuts and tax
increases known as the fiscal cliff.  All  10 industry groups  in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
advanced in the holiday shortened-week.  Bank of America Corp. (BAC) 
and  Caterpillar Inc. (CAT)  climbed at least 6.6 percent, pacing gains
among financial and industrial companies. An index of consumer
stocks jumped to a record as  Ross Stores Inc. (ROST)  and TJX Cos.
announced same-store sales that topped estimates.  General Motors
Co. (GM)  and  Ford Motor Co. (F)  rallied more than 5.4 percent as auto
sales beat forecasts.  The S&P 500 rose 4.6 percent to 1,466.47, the highest level
since December 2007. The benchmark gauge had the best three-day
start of a year since 2009. The Dow Jones Industrial Average
added 497.10 points, or 3.8 percent, to 13,435.21. Both measures
posted the best weekly increase since December 2011. The Russell
2000 Index of small companies and the S&P Midcap 400 Index
reached all-time highs after jumping 5.7 percent and 5.2
percent, respectively.  “It’s understandable how the markets have rallied,” Bruce Bittles, chief investment strategist at Milwaukee-based RW Baird
& Co., which oversees $85 billion, said in a telephone interview
on Jan. 2. “Anyone who was concerned about the fiscal cliff
sold and certainly had time to do so, so the market was cleaned
out by the time we got to the final days of December.”  The  S&P 500 (SPX)  jumped 1.7 percent on Dec. 31, the biggest
rally on the final day of a year since 1974, as Republican and
Democratic lawmakers made last-minute concessions to finalize a
deal on budget talks. The index surged 2.5 percent on Jan. 2,
following the New Year’s holiday, after the House of
Representatives passed the budget bill, undoing income tax
increases for more than 99 percent of households.  Fed Stimulus  Stocks slipped on Jan. 3 as Federal Reserve policy makers
said they will probably end their $85 billion monthly bond-
purchase program sometime in 2013. Equities resumed gains on the
final day of the week as a report showing employers added
workers in December at about the same pace as the prior month
spurred speculation that Fed stimulus measures won’t end soon.  The jobs report “wasn’t exciting at all,” Joshua Silva,
senior portfolio strategist at Attalus Capital LP in
Philadelphia, which manages about $900 million, said in a phone
interview. “That’s not great for the economy, but it’s also not
meaning that the Fed is going to do anything dramatic.”  2012 Rally  The S&P 500 rose 13 percent in 2012, its biggest annual
gain in three years, as the Fed expanded asset purchases and the
European Central Bank announced an unlimited bond-buying plan.
Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said at a Dec. 12 press conference
that the central bank will continue buying bonds to boost the
economy until officials see “substantial improvement in the
outlook for the labor market.”  The benchmark equities index has surged 117 percent since
reaching a 12-year low of 676.53 in 2009.  The week’s advance in stocks prompted investors to cut
demand for protection against losses, driving down the cost of
options every day during the week. The Chicago Board Options
Exchange Volatility Index, known as the  VIX (VIX) , plunged 39 percent
to 13.83 for the biggest slump since its inception two decades
ago.  The earnings season will unofficially start as Alcoa Inc.,
the first Dow company to announce results, is due to report on
Jan. 8. Fourth-quarter profits from S&P 500 companies probably
increased 2.9 percent, according to analysts’ estimates compiled
by Bloomberg. That would be the second-lowest  quarterly growth 
since 2009, the data show.  Banks Surge  An index of financial companies in the S&P 500 advanced 5.4
percent for the biggest weekly gain since March. Bank of America
climbed 6.6 percent to $12.11 and JPMorgan Chase & Co. added 4.9
percent to $45.36.  Bank of America’s brokerage and JPMorgan’s asset-management
division are among businesses ripe for divestiture if U.S. banks
break up to improve stock prices, according to Mike Mayo, an
analyst with CLSA Ltd. Bank stock prices could double if risk
and cost of capital at the firms were reduced, reversing past
efforts to boost returns by taking on more risk, he said.  Industrial companies jumped 5 percent to the highest level
since June 2008. Caterpillar increased 9.3 percent to $94.92 as
the world’s largest maker of construction and mining equipment
was boosted to buy from hold at ISI Group.  Consumer-discretionary shares in the S&P 500 surged 4.8
percent to a  record high . Ross rallied 8.9 percent to $57.95 and
TJX advanced 7.1 percent to $44.56.  Holiday Sales  December sales beat analysts’ estimates after retailers
kept inventories lean in a tepid holiday season and attracted
shoppers with last-minute discounts. Same-store sales for the
more than 20 companies tracked by Swampscott, Massachusetts-
based Retail Metrics Inc. rose 4.8 percent, excluding
drugstores, beating the estimate for a 3.4 percent gain, the
firm said.  GM gained 7.2 percent to $29.86 and Ford added 5.4 percent
to $13.57. December U.S. deliveries of cars and light trucks
climbed 4.9 percent for GM and 1.6 percent for Ford. The results
exceeded analysts’ estimates as they rounded out a year of
surprising growth that helped propel the country’s economy.
Total U.S. deliveries of cars and light trucks climbed 13
percent to 14.5 million, the highest since 2007, and analysts
said they expect the market to exceed 15 million this year.  Macau Casinos  Wynn Resorts Ltd. led a rally in casino companies after
gambling revenue in Macau surged almost 20 percent to a record
in December. Wynn jumped 10 percent to $120.78. Las Vegas Sands
Corp. advanced 14 percent to $51.19.  Avon Products Inc. surged 15 percent to $16.09. The world’s
largest door-to-door cosmetics seller was raised to buy from
neutral at Bank of America.  Hormel Foods Corp. (HRL)  climbed 12 percent to a record $34.31.
The maker of Spam lunchmeat agreed to buy the Skippy peanut-
butter business from Unilever for about $700 million to expand
further into  China .  Family Dollar Stores Inc. sank 9.7 percent, the most in the
S&P 500, to $56.65. The second-largest U.S. dollar store chain
cut its fiscal 2013 earnings forecast, saying consumers are
reluctant to spend on more-profitable discretionary items.  To contact the reporter on this story:
