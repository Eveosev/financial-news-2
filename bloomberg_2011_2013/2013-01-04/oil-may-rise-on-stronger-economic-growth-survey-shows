Oil may rise next week on speculation
that stronger  economic growth  will boost fuel demand, a
Bloomberg survey showed.  Fourteen of 24 analysts, or 58 percent, forecast crude will
rise through Jan. 11. Five respondents, or 21 percent, predicted
a drop. Five said there would be little change. Last week, 50
percent of analysts projected a gain.  The U.S. unemployment rate held at 7.8 percent in December,
matching the lowest level since December 2008, the Labor
Department said today. Payrolls rose by 155,000 workers
following a revised 161,000 advance in November that was more
than initially estimated. U.S. consumer sentiment climbed last
week as the jobs market improved, the Bloomberg Consumer Comfort
Index showed yesterday.  “Economic data is solid, and we are going to see demand
continue to tick up,” said Bill Baruch, a senior market
strategist at Iitrader.com in  Chicago . “If prices get to $95,
oil is going to gain more momentum.”  U.S. gasoline  consumption  averaged 8.56 million barrels a
day in the four weeks ended Dec. 28, up 0.5 percent from the
previous week, according to an Energy Department report today.  Budget Legislation  President  Barack Obama  signed a budget measure into law
Jan. 2 to undo $600 billion in automatic tax increases and
spending cuts known as the fiscal cliff. Republicans immediately
turned to their next battle -- a bid to use the need to raise
the nation’s $16.4 trillion  debt ceiling  to force Obama to
accept cuts in entitlement programs such as Medicare.  “We still have the debt ceiling ahead of us but it’s
hopeful that Congress will find a solution,” Baruch said.  Oil rose $2.29, or 2.5 percent, to $93.09 a barrel this
week on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . The market was closed
Jan. 1 for New Year’s Day.  The oil survey has correctly predicted the direction of
futures 49 percent of the time since its start in April 2004.  To contact the reporter on this story:
