President Charles Plosser predicted a drop in the U.S.  jobless
rate  to 7 percent or lower by year-end, which he said could lead
to a halt to the central bank’s asset-purchase program.  Policy makers will stop purchases “when they believe
substantial improvement has been made in the labor market,”
Plosser told reporters after a speech to economists meeting in
San Diego. He said “I would think so” when asked whether the
6.8 percent to 7 percent unemployment rate he foresees by the
end of 2013 would meet the test.  The Fed said last month it will buy $45 billion a month of
Treasury securities starting in January, expanding its asset-
purchase program to $85 billion monthly, and for the first time
linked the outlook for its main interest rate to unemployment
and inflation. The central bank may end bond purchases sometime
in 2013, some policy makers said, according to minutes of the
Dec. 11-12 meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee released
yesterday.  “In the last two years unemployment has come down by
almost 2 percentage points -- about 1 percentage point a year”
and that could repeat this year, Plosser said. “I still believe
we will get about 3 percent growth in 2013, give or take a
little bit, and in 2014.”  Plosser, who has criticized the Fed for tying policy to
specific dates, said he thought it was a mistake to focus on the
minutes’ references to 2013.  Not Specific  “The statement about when we stop buying assets is
contingent on substantial progress on employment,” he said.
“There is now a discussion about when will we see that. Some
people think we will see that sooner rather than later. But we
haven’t been very specific. That is a qualitative judgment call
the committee will probably make.”  “It is about when the committee judges the improvement in
unemployment to be sufficient,” he said. “I have been very
clear all along. I have had the view that the efficacy of asset
purchases is not very high” and “there are risks associated
with these policies that will occur down the road.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
