India ’s 10-year bonds headed for the
best week since April on optimism the central bank will cut
interest rates this quarter to support a slowing economy.  The Reserve Bank of India will lower the repurchase  rate  by
50 basis points to 7.5 percent by March 31 in the first
reduction since April, according to 11 of 20 analysts surveyed
by Bloomberg. The next review is on Jan. 29. The monetary
authority will offer to buy 80 billion rupees ($1.5 billion) of
sovereign securities at an open-market auction today, it said in
a statement on Dec. 31.  “We recommend long positions in 10-year bonds, targeting
an additional drop in yields of about 75 basis points over the
next six months,” analysts at Barclays Plc, including
Singapore-based Igor Arsenin, wrote in a research note today.
“Easing expectations, low supply in January, and the RBI’s
continued purchase of bonds through open-market operations
remain favorable for fixed-income markets.”  The yield on the 8.15 percent notes due June 2022 fell 16
basis points, or 0.16 percentage point, this week to 7.95
percent as of 10:31 a.m. in Mumbai, according to the central
bank’s trading system. The rate, which touched a two-year low of
7.90 percent on Jan. 1, fell two basis points today.  Seven economists in the Bloomberg survey see a 25 basis
point reduction in the repo rate this quarter. One expects no
change while Woori CBV Securities Corp. forecasts a 25 basis
point increase.  Bonds also gained after the finance ministry deferred a 120
billion rupee debt auction scheduled for this week to February,
according to an RBI statement on Dec. 31.  The one-year interest-rate swap, a derivative contract used
to guard against fluctuations in funding costs, was steady at
7.60 percent, data compiled by Bloomberg show. It dropped three
basis points this week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
