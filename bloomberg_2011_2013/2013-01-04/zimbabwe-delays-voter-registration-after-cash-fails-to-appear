Zimbabwe  delayed registering voters
before an election expected this year because the Treasury has
yet to disburse the required money, Joyce Kazembe, deputy
chairwoman of the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission, said.  Registration, which includes a “clean-up” of the list of
eligible voters, was expected to begin yesterday and last three
months, she said in a telephone interview from Harare today. The
formerly opposition Movement for Democratic Change party and
political activists have said the list included the names of
dead people.  “Those people who are proved to be deceased will be
removed during the registration process, while newly eligible
voters will be added,” Kazembe said. “Money hasn’t been
forthcoming from the Treasury department, so we’re now
waiting.”  President  Robert Mugabe  has said he wants the elections
held in March. The  Southern African Development Community  in
2009 brokered an agreement between Mugabe’s Zimbabwe African
National Union-Patriotic Front and Prime Minister  Morgan Tsvangirai ’sMDC, creating a unity government following a 2008
election the regional body said was marred by violence. Under
the agreement, Zimbabweans must approve a new constitution
before presidential and parliamentary elections can be held.  Zimbabwe’s state-controlled Herald last month quoted the
ZEC as saying $220 million would be needed to hold the ballot
and constitutional referendum.  About 5.5 million Zimbabweans are on the country’s voters’
roll, the Herald reported last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
