Gold traders expect prices to rebound
from the longest weekly losing streak in eight years as mounting
concern that U.S. lawmakers are doing too little to control the
 budget deficit  spurs demand for a protection of wealth.  Twenty analysts surveyed by Bloomberg expect prices to rise
next week, five were bearish and a further two were neutral.
While  hedge funds  cut bullish bets to a four-month low last week
as prices slid for a fifth week, investors are holding a near-
record amount in gold-backed  exchange-traded products  that are
now valued at $138.5 billion, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Bullion posted its longest run of annual gains in at least
nine decades as U.S. lawmakers this week passed legislation that
prevented tax increases for most workers and delayed spending
cuts by two months. The  International Monetary Fund  says the
country’s debt ceiling ought to be raised “expeditiously.”
While Credit Suisse Group AG yesterday said gold will average
the most ever this year, it joined Goldman Sachs Group Inc. in
predicting the 12-year  bull market  will probably peak in 2013.  “Euphoria over the fiscal-cliff avoidance could be short
lived as all problems are not solved yet,” said Frederique Dubrion, the Geneva-based president and chief investment officer
of Blue Star Advisors SA, which manages metals and energy
assets. “There’s still a huge amount of debt. Gold is nobody’s
liability, it’s the ultimate alternative currency.”  Gold Price  The metal fell 1.2 percent to $1,643.85 an ounce today
after U.S. Federal Reserve policy makers said they’ll probably
end their $85 billion of monthly bond purchases this year,
according to the record of the  Federal Open Market Committee ’s
Dec. 11-12 gathering released yesterday.  While gold rose 7.1 percent last year, it’s set for a sixth
weekly loss, the worst run since May 2004. The Standard & Poor’s
GSCI gauge of 24 commodities added 0.3 percent in 2012, the MSCI
All-Country World  Index (MXWD)  of equities rose 13 percent. Treasuries
returned 2.2 percent, a Bank of America Corp. index shows.  The U.S. House of Representatives passed legislation on
Jan. 1, breaking an impasse over how to prevent more than $600
billion in tax increases and spending cuts from coming into
force. The so-called fiscal cliff had threatened to push the
world’s largest economy into a recession. The budget package
passed by Congress won’t reduce deficits enough to avoid a
sovereign-rating downgrade, Moody’s Investors Service said.  Fed Minutes  Gold will reach $2,000 this year, according to a Bloomberg
survey of 49 traders and analysts last month, as investors hedge
against inflation and weaker currencies. The Fed said Dec. 12 it
would buy $45 billion of  Treasury securities  a month from
January. The yen fell to the lowest since 2010 against the
dollar today after the Fed’s minutes and amid speculation the
 Bank of Japan (8301)  will heed government calls to print more money.  Investors bought 60 percent more through gold ETPs last
year compared with 2011 and now hold 11.7 metric tons below the
record 2,632.5 tons set Dec. 20. The holdings are equal to
almost a year of mine production, data compiled by Bloomberg and
Barclays Plc show. Nations from  Brazil  to  Iraq  to  Russia  are
also buying metal to add to official reserves, according to data
compiled by the IMF.  While Credit Suisse forecasts a 2013 average of $1,740, it
expects improved economic growth later this year to curb gold’s
appeal and sees prices averaging $1,720 in 2014. Goldman’s
analysts said Dec. 5 that prices will peak this year because of
improving U.S. growth, even as the Fed expands stimulus.  Most Accurate  The metal will average $1,600 this year, according to Rene Hochreiter, a director of Johannesburg-based Allan Hochreiter
(Pty) Ltd. and the most accurate forecaster in the London
Bullion Market Association’s 2012 gold survey. That would be 4.1
percent below last year’s all-time high average.  Prices may slump to $1,600 by March, according to technical
analysis by Paul Kavanaugh at FuturePath Trading LLC. The 50-day
moving average crossed below the 100-day average, indicating
prices will slide 4.5 percent from yesterday’s settlement of
$1,674.60 on the Comex in  New York , Kavanaugh, the Chicago-based
director of business development, said in a telephone interview.  Speculators cut their bullish bets by 49 percent since
October and held a net-long position of 101,922 futures and
options in the week to Dec. 24, the least since Aug. 14, U.S.
Commodity Futures Trading Commission data show. U.S. Mint sales
of American Eagle gold coins fell 44 percent to 76,000 ounces in
December and full-year sales were 25 percent lower than in 2011,
data on its website show.  India’s Imports  Physical demand may slow elsewhere.  India ’s Finance
Minister Palaniappan Chidambaram said Jan. 2 that 2011’s biggest
buying nation may raise taxes on gold imports to reduce the
current-account deficit. India bought 24 percent less in the
first nine months of last year as gold priced in rupees reached
a record, according to the London-based World Gold Council.  Gold priced in the Indian currency rallied 10 percent last
year, beating dollar-denominated bullion’s smallest annual
increase in four years. The metal surged 21 percent in yen in
2012 and reached a 32-year high this week, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  In other commodities, nine of 12 traders and analysts
surveyed expect copper to fall next week, two were bullish and
one was neutral. The metal for delivery in three months, the
London Metal Exchange’s benchmark contract, climbed 4.4 percent
last year and was at $8,092 a ton today.  Sugar Outlook  Six of 11 people surveyed expect raw sugar to gain next
week and four predict a drop. The commodity traded at 18.94
cents a pound on ICE Futures U.S. yesterday after dropping 16
percent last year, its second consecutive annual decline.  Twelve of 24 people surveyed anticipate a gain in corn
prices next week and 10 said the grain will drop, while 15 of 25
said soybeans will slide and seven expect rising prices. Twelve
of 23 traders predicted cheaper wheat and nine were bullish.
Corn rose 8 percent last year and was at $6.84 a bushel in
 Chicago  as soybeans traded at $13.62 a bushel after rallying 17
percent in 2012. Wheat gained 19 percent in the period and was
last at $7.4575 a bushel.  The S&P GSCI gauge of commodities posted its worst annual
performance since 2008 even as Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  and
European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  pledged bond
purchases. The IMF expects 3.6 percent global economic growth
this year, up from 3.3 percent in 2012, with  China ’s expansion
accelerating to 8.2 percent. The country is the biggest user of
everything from copper to soybeans.  “The fiscal cliff hasn’t come out as well as everyone had
hoped, but the key factor about the U.S. is that Bernanke still
has the ability to continue to expand stimulus measures,” said
Jeremy Baker, who manages about $830 million of assets at the
Vontobel Belvista Commodity Fund in Zurich. “China is going to
be supportive for industrial bulk-type commodities, and even for
agricultural commodities.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
