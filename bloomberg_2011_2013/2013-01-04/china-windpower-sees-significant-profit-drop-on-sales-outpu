China Windpower Group Ltd. (182)  expects to
post a “significant drop” in 2012 profit on waning growth in
sales of stakes in projects and income from electricity output.  It reported profit of HK$372 million ($48 million) in 2011.  “The significant drop in net profit is mainly due to the
decrease in the gain on disposal of interests in our investments
in our wind power projects, and the decrease in the income from
the electricity output generated by certain jointly controlled
entities,” Hong Kong-based China Windpower said in a statement.  Expansion of China’s wind industry slowed in 2011 after the
government curbed approvals for farms to ease grid congestion.
Installations probably slid 20 percent to 16.4 gigawatts last
year, the first annual drop, Bloomberg New Energy Finance said.  China  Windpower, which also makes equipment, saw first-half
profit drop 90 percent to HK$24.8 million as the growth in
demand for electricity slowed and approvals became harder. The
company expects to release its full-year earnings in March.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
