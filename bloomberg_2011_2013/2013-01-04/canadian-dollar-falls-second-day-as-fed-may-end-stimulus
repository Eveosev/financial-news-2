The Canadian dollar fell against its
U.S. counterpart for the second day before employment figures
forecast to show the nation’s jobless rate increased in
December.  The currency weakened against the majority of its most
traded peers after the  Federal Reserve  revealed yesterday it may
end monetary stimulus this year, allowing the currency to
appreciate.  Canada ’s unemployment rate is projected to have
increased in December to 7.3 percent from 7.2 percent the
previous month, according to a Bloomberg survey of 22
economists.  “When you look at a Fed that’s been very dovish, to see
any consideration on their part to think about maybe winding
back some of the stimulus, or at least thinking about an end
date for asset purchases, caught the market a bit off-guard,”
said  David Tulk , chief macro strategist at Toronto-Dominion
Bank, by phone from Toronto. “It was a little bit late in the
day where that was released yesterday, so it has a bit more of a
disproportionate impact over the European session today and it’s
spilled over into the currency.”  The Canadian dollar, known as the loonie for the image of
the aquatic bird on the C$1 coin, fell 0.4 percent to 99.17
cents per U.S dollar at 8:57 a.m. in Toronto. One Canadian
dollar buys $1.0084.  Policy makers at the U.S. central bank will probably end
their $85 billion monthly bond purchases in 2013, according to
minutes of their Dec. 11-12 meeting released yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
