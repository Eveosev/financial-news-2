Bangladesh authorities have approved
a water project designed to supply villagers from 45 communities
with hundreds of wells and a safer source of clean drinking
water.  The ECNEC executive committee’s approval “in the presence
of” Bangladesh’s prime minister of the $33 million project
means the Public Health Engineering Department will set up more
than 400 experimental and production tube-wells and pump houses
as well as construct 27 water-treatment plants and 755
kilometers (469 miles) of pipeline, 14,000 house pipeline
connections and 155 toilets, the  Daily Star  of Dhaka reported.  The project work is due to start in July and conclude by
2015, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
