Hong Kong  stocks  retreated from a 19-
month high as exporters fell after  Federal Reserve  policy makers
said they may end their $85 billion monthly bond-purchase
program this year. Retailers of luxury goods gained as a report
showed sales rebounded in the city.  Techtronic Industries Co., a maker of power tools that
counts  North America  as its biggest market, slid 1.9 percent.
Financial companies fell the most on the index, led by  HSBC
Holdings Plc (5) ,  Europe ’s largest bank, which slid 1.6 percent.
Emperor Watch & Jewellery Ltd. surged 4.9 percent, leading gains
among sellers of luxury goods.  The  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  fell 0.3 percent to 23,331.09 at the
close in Hong Kong, its biggest drop in two weeks, after closing
yesterday at a 19-month high. It had a weekly gain of 2.9
percent. The Hang Seng  China  Enterprises Index of mainland
companies listed in the city slid 0.4 percent to 11,937.45.  “ Hong Kong  stocks rose by almost 800 points in the last
two sessions,” said Peter Lai, director of sales at DBS Vickers
Hong Kong Ltd., noting that much of the decline was profit-
taking. As to the end of the U.S. bond-buying program, he said,
“Psychologically, for the short term there may be some impact
from it.”  The Hang Seng Index rose 23 percent last year. The gauge
advanced 12 percent from the end of September through yesterday
as signs of accelerating growth in China lured funds made
available by global central-bank easing. The Hong Kong Monetary
Authority has injected HK$107.19 billion ($13.8 billion) into
the financial system to maintain the local currency’s peg to the
 U.S. dollar  since Oct. 21, the first time it had to do so since
2009.  Federal Reserve  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index futures gained 0.1 percent
today after the  gauge fell 0.2  percent yesterday. Four years
after cutting the main  interest rate  to near zero, U.S. policy
makers have been expanding their third round of so-called
quantitative easing to boost economic growth and cut the jobless
rate, now at 7.7 percent.  Minutes, released yesterday in  Washington , show a divide
among Federal Open Market Committee participants on how long
bond purchases should last. Participants who provided estimates
were “approximately evenly divided” between those who said it
would be appropriate to end the purchases around mid-2013 and
those who said they should continue beyond that date.  Exporters fell in Hong Kong, with Techtronic falling to
HK$14.72.  Li & Fung Ltd. (494) , a supplier of toys and clothes to Wal-
Mart Stores Inc., fell 0.1 percent to HK$14.50. Man Wah Holdings
Ltd., a sofa maker that gets about half its sales from the U.S.,
dropped 2.4 percent to HK$6.40.  Financial Names  “The work that we’ve done shows often what has caused
previous recessions was pulling stimulus off too early before
growth started to build on itself,” said James Lindsay,
Auckland-based equity fund manager at Tyndall Investment
Management Ltd., which oversees about $23 billion. “This has
been more of a relief rally than anything else. The hard yards
are still to come. U.S. economic data remains pretty mixed.”  Banks, brokerages and insurance companies fell the most in
Hong Kong, with the Hang Seng Finance index retreating 0.5
percent, after it surged 4 percent to a 19-month high in the
past two days of trading. HSBC dropped 1.6 percent to HK$82.
 China Life Insurance Co. (2628) , the nation’s largest insurance company
fell 0.4 percent to HK$27.00 after jumping the most in a year on
Jan. 2. Industrial & Commercial Bank of China Ltd., the world’s
No. 1 lender by market value, declined 0.3 percent to HK$5.79.  Luxury Goods  The Hang Seng Index traded at 11.3 times estimated earnings
on average yesterday, compared with 13.1 times for the Standard
& Poor’s 500 Index and 11.9 times for the Stoxx Europe 600
Index, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Luxury goods retailers and makers gained after sales of
items including jewelry and watches jumped 13.7 percent in
November from a year earlier after a 2.9 percent decline in
October, Hong Kong’s government said in a statement on its
website yesterday. The role of mainland Chinese tourists in
driving the city’s retail sales makes the figures one gauge of
sentiment in the world’s second-biggest economy.  Emperor Watch & Jewellery gained 4.9 percent to HK$1.08.
Hengdeli Holdings Ltd., the Chinese partner of Swatch Group AG,
rose 1.7 percent to HK$3.01.  Sa Sa International Holdings Ltd. (178) ,
Hong Kong’s biggest cosmetics retail chain, increased 1.4
percent to HK$6.61.  Gome Electrical Appliances Holding Ltd., a household
appliance retailer, rose 6.6 percent to HK$1.13, its highest
level since June 21.  Futures on the Hang Seng Index fell 0.7 percent to 20,290.
The  HSI Volatility Index (VHSI)  fell 3.8 percent to 14.87, its lowest
level in a month, indicating traders expect a swing of 4.3
percent for the equity benchmark in the next 30 days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
