Korea Electric Power Corp. (015760) ’s Chief
Executive Officer Cho Hwan Eik said the utility must increase
electricity prices to forestall a power crisis.  “We should try with all our heart” to raise tariffs this
year, Cho told employees yesterday, according to an e-mailed
statement from the state-owned utility. “If we fail to chop
twigs with an ax, we should try it two or three times.”  Cho was appointed on Dec. 17 after a struggle between the
government and his predecessor Kim Joong Kyum over raising
prices led to his resignation in November, before the end of his
term. South Korea’s power consumption surged to a record 76,522
megawatts yesterday, compared with a maximum generation capacity
of 80,710 megawatts.  The difference falls short of a reserve buffer of 10
percent and is making the government ask large consumers to
alter their working hours to avoid blackouts during peak hours.
South Korea’s power exchange has sounded alerts and controlled
consumption whenever the reserve has fallen to near or below the
4,000-megawatt safety threshold set by the government.  “The possibility that the new chief executive will raise
tariffs is gaining ground,” said Kim Sang Ku, an utilities
analyst at Kiwoom Securities Co. in  Seoul , who has a buy rating
on Korea Electric shares. “The government is likely to change
the country’s electricity tariff system to cost-based pricing.”  Korea Electric purchased power at 103 won a kilowatt hour
and sold it at 94 won in the first half of 2012, the company
said in a statement on July 27. The utility had accumulated
 losses  of 10.3 trillion won ($9.7 billion) from January 2008 to
September 2012. The country’s Ministry of Knowledge Economy
decides on proposals for tariff increases after considering the
impact of inflation and discussions with policy makers. South
Korea caps electricity prices to control inflation.  Korea Electric fell 1 percent to 31,300 won as of 1:10 p.m.
in  Seoul trading  after touching a 27-month high yesterday. The
benchmark Kospi index dropped 0.8 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
