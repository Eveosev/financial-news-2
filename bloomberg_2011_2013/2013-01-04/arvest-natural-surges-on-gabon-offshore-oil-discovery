Harvest Natural Resources Inc. (HNR) , the
oil explorer with operations in Venezuela, Indonesia and Oman,
climbed the most in more than six months after reporting its
second crude discovery off the coast of Gabon.  Harvest advanced 11 percent to $10.25 at the close in  New
York , the most since June 22, and its highest since Nov. 8,
2011.  Harvest found oil in the Dussafu Tortue Marin-1 well, the
Houston-based company said in a statement today. The well, in
380 feet (116 meters) of water, was dug to a depth of more than
2 miles.  Further appraisal is needed to determine the scope of the
discovery, including fluid sampling and a sidetrack well,
according to the statement. Harvest operates Dussafu and holds a
66.66 percent stake.  Panoro Energy ASA (PEN) , owner of 33.33 percent of Dussafu, rose
20 percent in Oslo to close at 3.35 kroner, the biggest one-day
gain since it was spun off by  Norse Energy Corp ASA (NEC)  in June,
2010.  Harvest reported its first discovery off Gabon in June
2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
