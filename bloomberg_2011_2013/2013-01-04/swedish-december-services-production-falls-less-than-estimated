Sweden’s  services  industry shrank
less than economists estimated in December after a decline in
order intake eased and business volumes increased.  An index based on responses from about 200 purchasing
managers in the services sector rose to a seasonally adjusted
49.1 in December, compared with a revised 46.3 the previous
month, Stockholm-based  Swedbank AB (SWEDA) , which compiles the index,
said in a statement today. The median estimate of four
economists surveyed by Bloomberg was for a reading of 47.2. A
number below 50 signals a contraction.  “Companies’ business volumes and delivery times were the
main contributors to the increase,” Swedbank said in the
statement. “The decline in order intake abated.”  Sweden’s  manufacturing industry  contracted for a fifth
consecutive month in December as the euro-area debt crisis
erodes demand for the Nordic country’s exports, about 70 percent
of which go to  Europe . Sweden’s government on Dec. 21 cut its
economic outlook for this year and next, projecting 1.1 percent
growth in gross domestic product in 2013, versus an earlier
estimate for a 2.7 percent expansion.  The Riksbank on Dec. 18 reduced its benchmark  interest rate 
for a fourth time in 12 months to revive economic growth,
cutting the repo rate by a quarter of a percentage point to 1
percent.  The PMI’s sub-index for planned business volumes rose to
55.9 last month from 49.9 in November, the highest level since
August. It indicates that a majority of Swedish services
companies see increased or unchanged business volumes in the
next six months, Swedbank said.  The business volume index for December increased to 48.9,
compared with a reading of 44.9 a month earlier, while the order
index rose to 48.8 from 46.8. The employment index advanced to
48.5 from 48.2 while the delivery time index increased to 50.2,
compared with 45.4 in November -- its first expansion since
April.  To contact the reporter on this story:
