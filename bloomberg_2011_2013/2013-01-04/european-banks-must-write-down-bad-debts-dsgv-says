European lenders must write down the
value of their assets where necessary to regain trust,  Germany ’s
DSGV savings-bank lobby said.  “Financial institutions that can no longer survive must be
wound down while preserving the system’s stability,” Georg Fahrenschon, president of the association, said today in an e-
mailed statement. The Berlin-based DSGV represents Germany’s
more than 420 savings banks.  Europe ’s banks are fighting to hold onto the confidence of
investors and creditors amid a three-year sovereign debt crisis
and souring loans in some countries. The euro area’s leaders
must also continue to align fiscal policy as their efforts so
far have only provided the funding for necessary structural
reforms by  member states , Fahrenschon said.  “European economic policy, along with the repairs needed
in the financial industry, has to push for higher growth even
under changed demographic circumstances,” Fahrenschon said.
“That puts further efforts in labor, goods and service markets
as well as social and education systems on the agenda.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
