Ethanol strengthened against gasoline
on speculation the biofuel’s discount will spur increased
blending.  The grain-based additive was 58.33 cents cheaper than
gasoline, based on February futures for both commodities. That
compares with 60.07 cents yesterday.  “That blend spread has gotten out there,” said Mike
Blackford, a consultant at INTL FCStone in  Des Moines ,  Iowa .
“I’ve got to think we can buy into some demand.”  Denatured ethanol for February delivery fell 1.6 cents, or
0.7 percent, to settle at $2.181 a gallon on the Chicago Board
of Trade. January futures, which expired today, dropped 0.4
percent to $2.17 a gallon. The front-month futures are down 2.6
percent in the past year.  Gasoline for February delivery slid 3.34 cents, or 1.2
percent, to $2.7643 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . The contract covers reformulated gasoline, which is
made to be blended with ethanol before delivery to filling
stations.  In cash market trading, ethanol in Chicago decreased 1
cent, or 0.5 percent, to $2.18 a gallon and in the U.S. Gulf the
additive decreased 1 cent, or 0.5 percent, to $2.235, data
compiled by Bloomberg shows.  Ethanol on the West Coast declined 1 cent, or 0.4 percent,
to $2.34 a gallon and in  New York  the biofuel climbed 0.5 cent
to $2.28.  Corn for March delivery tumbled 9 cents, or 1.3 percent, to
$6.8025 a bushel in Chicago. One bushel makes at least 2.75
gallons of ethanol.  Based on March contracts for corn and ethanol, producers
are losing 28 cents on each gallon of the fuel made, down from
29 cents yesterday, according to data collected by Bloomberg.
The figures exclude the revenue that can be made from the sale
of dried distillers’ grains, a byproduct of ethanol production
that can be fed to livestock.  To contact the reporter on this story:
