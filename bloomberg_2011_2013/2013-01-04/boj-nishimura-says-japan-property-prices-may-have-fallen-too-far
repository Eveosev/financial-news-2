Bank of Japan (8301)  Deputy Governor
 Kiyohiko Nishimura  said property prices in Japan may have fallen
too much in the aftermath of a real estate bubble that collapsed
in the 1990s.  “In the case of Japan, property prices are too low
compared to fundamentals,” Nishimura said in response to a
question from the audience after delivering a paper in San Diego
yesterday. Demographic changes in the country may have created
too much pessimism in the housing market, he said.  Population booms can often lead to the creation of property
price bubbles, Nishimura said in his paper to the American
Economic Association’s annual meeting.  Policy can often be “pro-cyclical” with these trends,
fueling price increases as officials loosen regulations in
response to  population growth . Downturns can be severe when
price bubbles collapse and officials go too far in tightening
regulations, he said.  “Regulatory pro-cyclicality is now going on” in many
developed countries in response to the 2008 global credit
crunch, Nishimura said. “This is a major issue.”  The central bank official didn’t comment on the outlook for
the Japanese economy or monetary policy. Japan’s economy has
repeatedly lapsed into contraction in recent years, burdened by
a shrinking and aging population at home that has made it
difficult for the country to overcome deflation.  To contact the reporters on this story:
