The Catalan regional government is
hoping to overturn a decision by an independent panel of
government advisers to revoke  Acciona SA (ANA) ’s 1 billion-euro ($1.3
billion) plan to privatize Barcelona’s water supply.  The territory and sustainability department will seek to
reverse the decision to allow Sociedad General de Aguas de
Barcelona to challenge Acciona’s contract in court as there
seems to be a “divide” in criteria between authorities and the
panel, regional government spokesman Francesc Homs said.  Acciona, an Alcobendas, Spain-based renewable energy
provider with a water unit that operates worldwide, is preparing
legal action with its partners against the Catalan government
for accepting the appeal after an initial payment of 299 million
euros to regional authorities on Dec. 27, according to a
regulatory statement.  The company said it will continue to manage  Barcelona ’s
water supply until the court reaches a verdict. Catalonia favors
independence for  Spain ’s largest regional economy yet opposes
asset disposals such as Barcelona’s water provider.  “Acciona can’t but express its surprise by the situation
created as a consequence of these contradictory statements made
by the Generalitat de Calatalunya,” the company said today in a
statement. “We have confidence that the situation will be
resolved definitively in the coming days.”  A spokesman for the territory department didn’t respond to
phone calls today requesting comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
