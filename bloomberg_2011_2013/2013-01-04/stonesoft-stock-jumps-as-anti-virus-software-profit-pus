Stonesoft Oyj (SFT1V)  jumped to the highest
in almost 11 years in Helsinki trading after forecasting its
first profit in a decade because of growing sales of its
computer security software.  Stonesoft surged as much as 22 percent to 2.15 euros, the
highest intraday price since March 2002, and was trading up 18
percent at 2.07 euros at 1:58 p.m. in the biggest increase on
the  Nasdaq OMX Helsinki (HEX)  all-share index. Volume was more than
twelve times the three-month daily average. The stock has more
than doubled in the last 12 months.  Fourth-quarter sales rose 41 percent to 13.4 million euros
($17.4 million), Helsinki-based Stonesoft said yesterday in a
statement. Earnings before interest and taxes in 2012 were
“positive,” it said. The software producer had earlier
projected a result near break-even. It has posted operating
losses since at least 2000.  Stonesoft makes software to protect  computer networks  from
threats including cyber attacks and attempts to bypass security
detection. It is scheduled to release detailed earnings figures
for 2012 on Feb. 8.  To contact the reporter on this story:
