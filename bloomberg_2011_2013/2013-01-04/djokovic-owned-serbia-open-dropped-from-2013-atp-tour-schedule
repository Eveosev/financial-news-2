The Serbian Open, owned by Belgrade-
native Novak Djokovic and run by his family, has been dropped
from the  ATP World Tour  calendar.  The red clay tennis tournament won’t be held this year
after Family Sport, the event’s organizers, decided to cease
operation, the tour said today on its website. None of the ATP’s
Top 35 ranked players participated in the tournament last
season.  “We have made the most rational decision considering the
circumstances,” Family Sport said in a statement on the tour
website. “We are grateful for everyone’s contribution and help
in running this event that brought a lot of international stars
and attention to  Serbia .”  The tournament was scheduled to take place from April 29-
May 5 this year, according to the website. It was the only ATP
tournament held in Serbia, and rights to the event were bought
back by the ATP.  Italy’s Andreas Seppi won the event last year in a field
that  did not include  Djokovic, then the top-ranked player, and
countrymen Janko Tipsarevic, No. 8, and  Viktor Troicki , No. 30.
Djokovic, who won the inaugural tournament in 2009 and again in
2011, pulled out in 2012 citing the need for a break from
tennis.  -- Editor: Jay Beberman  To contact the reporter on this story:
