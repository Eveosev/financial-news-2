China Minsheng Banking Corp. (1988) , the
nation’s first privately owned lender, will open an investment
banking arm in  Hong Kong , as Chinese banks seek to take
advantage of the  yuan ’s increased use in global trade.  The board of the Beijing-based lender approved the plan,
which still needs regulatory approval, the bank said in a
 statement  to the Shanghai stock exchange today.  Minsheng is joining its larger rivals in expanding overseas
as Chinese banks exert more influence globally. China’s four
biggest lenders are among the world’s ten largest, topped by
 Industrial & Commercial Bank of China Ltd.   Minsheng was  granted  a banking license in January 2012 by
the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, becoming the latest Chinese
lender operating in the city. ICBC,  China Construction Bank
Corp. (939) ,  Agricultural Bank of China Ltd. (601288)  and  Bank of China Ltd. (3988) 
all have an investment banking unit in the city.  Bank of China  was the fourth largest underwriter of
yuan-denominated bonds in Hong Kong last year, a market where
issuances increased 15 percent from 2011 to a record 175
billion yuan ($28 billion), according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
