Chelyabinsk Metallurgical Plant (CHMK) , a
unit of Russia’s biggest producer of steelmaking coal, OAO
 Mechel (MTLR) , completed an expansion of its wastewater biochemical
treatment facility last month, Ural-Press-Inform reported,
citing unit spokeswoman Yekaterina Doldina.  Mechel-Koks’s expanded facility allows the cleaning of
wastewater from 99 percent of ammonia.  The first phase of the treatment facility was brought
online in October 2011 to clean water from lubricants. The total
cost of the project is 900 million rubles ($30 million).  To contact the reporter on this story:
