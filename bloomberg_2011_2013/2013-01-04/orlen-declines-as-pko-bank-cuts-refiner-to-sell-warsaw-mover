PKN Orlen SA (PKN)  fell the most in a week
after PKO Bank Polski SA’ brokerage downgraded Poland’s largest
oil refiner to sell on a deteriorating outlook.  The  shares  slumped as much as 3.2 percent, the most since
Dec. 28, and traded 2.5 percent lower at 51.1 zloty as of 11:20
a.m. in Warsaw. Today’s volume on the stock was about 32 percent
of the three-month daily average, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  The current year will be “worse” for the company on a
year-on-year basis due to “significant volatility of the
macroeconomic environment, fall in refining margins and rising
supply of the refinery capacities,” Monika Kalwasinska, a
Warsaw-based analyst at PKO, said in a note today.  The refining margin dropped to $1.2 per barrel in December
from $3.8 a barrel in November, Orlen said on its  website 
yesterday. PKO cut the refiner from hold and raised its share-
estimate to 39.14 zloty from 35.31 zloty.  To contact the reporter on this story:
