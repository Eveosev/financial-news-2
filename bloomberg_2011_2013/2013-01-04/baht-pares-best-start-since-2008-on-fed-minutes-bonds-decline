Thailand ’s baht weakened by the most
in more than three months, paring a weekly gain, after minutes
of a Federal Reserve meeting indicated the monetary authority
will probably end its bond-buying program in 2013.  Fed members were divided between a mid- or end-of-year
finish to the debt purchases that have helped boost demand for
riskier assets, according to the minutes of last month’s meeting
released yesterday in  Washington . The baht touched a 10-month
high yesterday as foreign funds bought $36 million more local
stocks than they sold this week, exchange data show.  “The Fed minutes determined the baht movement and gave
some support to the dollar in other Asian markets as well,”
said Kozo Hasegawa, a foreign-exchange trader in Bangkok at
Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp. “Funds will continue to pour into
Thailand and I don’t think this trend will reverse too soon.”  The baht dropped 0.4 percent to 30.48 per dollar in Bangkok
in the biggest decline since Sept. 24, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Today’s loss cut this week’s gain to 0.4
percent. It rose as high as 30.29 yesterday.  One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves
in exchange rates used to price options, rose five basis points
to 4.11 percent, the highest level since Dec. 17. It climbed 20
basis points, or 0.2 percentage point, for the week.  Government bonds  completed a weekly loss as official data
released Jan. 2 showed inflation accelerated to a 13-month high
of 3.6 percent in December. The Bank of Thailand will keep its
benchmark  interest rate  at 2.75 percent at its Jan. 9 meeting,
according to all 15 economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  The yield on the 3.875 percent notes due June 2019 rose 11
basis points to 3.34 percent from a week ago, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The yield added three basis points today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
