Wall Street brokers who are lured to
new firms with signing bonuses of at least $50,000 would be
required to tell their clients under a rule proposed by the
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.  Finra, Wall Street’s self-regulator, posted the  proposal  on
its website today after its directors voted last month to ask
for comments on the plan. Brokers would have to tell their
customers how much they received before convincing them to bring
their accounts to the new firm, the regulator said.  Brokerages typically recruit financial advisers with
“forgivable” loans -- a type of bonus that must be repaid if
the employee leaves before a specified time or isn’t able to
bring in as much business as promised. This may create a
conflict of interest, Finra said.  The proposal would require brokers to tell clients of any
“enhanced compensation” they receive in connection with the
switch, including bonuses, loans and transition assistance.
Institutional investors wouldn’t have to be informed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
