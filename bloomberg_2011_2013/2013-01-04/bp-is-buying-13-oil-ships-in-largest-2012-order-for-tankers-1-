BP Plc (BP/) , the world’s third-largest
charterer of ships to carry oil, confirmed an order for 13 of
the vessels, 2012’s largest shipbuilding accord for tankers.  The order includes three Suezmax ships, each able to hold 1
million barrels of crude, and 10 smaller Aframaxes, London-based
BP spokesman  Toby Odone  said today by phone. The first vessel is
scheduled for delivery late next year, he said. The company also
has options to build eight more tankers,  Adam Smith , a spokesman
for its shipping unit, said separately by phone.  The December contract is for vessels with total capacity of
1.58 million deadweight tons, making the order last year’s
biggest for tankers, according to figures from Clarkson Plc, the
world’s biggest shipbroker, compiled by Bloomberg. 2003 was the
most recent year before 2012 in which BP ordered vessels to
transport crude or refined products, Smith said.  BP Shipping Ltd., based in Sunbury-on-Thames,  England ,
manages a fleet of more than 50 vessels that carry crude, oil
products and liquefied natural gas, according to its website.

The ships are worth $630 million based on costs of $60 million

Aframax, according to London-based shipbroker ICAP Shipping
International Ltd.  Orders for all varieties of tankers totaled 270 last year,
according to Clarkson.  Kuwait Oil Tanker Co.  was the second-
largest buyer of the ships, ordering vessels with combined
capacity of 1.56 million tons.  An Aframax can hold 650,000 barrels of crude. Royal Dutch
Shell Plc and China International United Petroleum & Chemical
Co., or Unipec, were the two biggest charterers of crude tankers
in 2011, according to Poten & Partners Inc., a New York-based
