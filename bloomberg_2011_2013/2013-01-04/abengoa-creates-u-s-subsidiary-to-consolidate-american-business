Abengoa SA (ABG) , a solar-thermal power and
water desalination plant developer, said it’s created a
subsidiary to oversee its businesses in the U.S., which
contribute about 20 percent of the company’s revenue.  The largest developer of solar-thermal power plants said
the American subsidiary,  Abengoa US (AGOAF) , has at least $5.8 billion
in assets and coordinates operations in 12 states from offices
in Washington D.C., St. Louis and Denver.  The Seville, Spain-based company’s solar-thermal systems
typically use mirrors to focus sunlight on a boiler, generating
steam used to produce electricity. Its project involvement in
the U.S. includes Solana, the largest solar plant using
parabolic-trough solar-thermal technology in the Arizona desert.  Abengoa broke ground about six weeks ago on West Africa’s
first desalination facility, a venture to provide drinking
water for about 500,000 people in  Ghana . It also produces
biofuels.  To contact the reporter on this story:
