  Kenneth Griffin , the billionaire
founder of hedge fund Citadel LLC, bought two adjacent
oceanfront properties in  Palm Beach , Florida, for $79.6 million,
his second luxury residential deal in less than two months.  Griffin purchased 40 and 50 Blossom Way in Palm Beach
through an affiliated company, said a person with knowledge with
the deal who asked not to be named because the details are
private. An entity called PBH LLC bought 50 Blossom Way for
$37.95 million and the neighboring vacant parcel for $41.65
million on Dec. 27, according to the county clerk’s office.  A 14,354-square-foot (1,334-square-meter) house sits on 50
Blossom Way, according to the Palm Beach Daily News, which
reported earlier this week that the properties had sold.  Griffin, 44, in November paid $15 million for a 7,900-
square-foot penthouse at Park Tower in  Chicago , where Citadel is
based. The purchase set a record for a condominium in the city,
according to the  Chicago Tribune . A spokeswoman for Griffin
declined yesterday to comment on his purchases.  Citadel outperformed last year, rising 21 percent through
November in its main Kensington and Wellington funds, a person
familiar with the matter said last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
