Temperatures may climb into the mid-
to-high 50s Fahrenheit (10 to 15 Celsius) across the U.S.
Northeast next week, damping demand for heating fuels.  New York City may reach a high of 59 degrees and  Boston 
could be 55 by Jan. 12, according to  MDA Weather Services  in
Gaithersburg, Maryland. Philadelphia may see 60 the same day.  “The impressive January warmth remains on track for the
eastern half of the nation,” according to MDA’s daily forecast.  Temperatures across the eastern U.S. from the Mississippi
River to the Atlantic Ocean are expected to reach 8 to 14
degrees above normal from Jan. 9 to Jan. 13, according to MDA.  About 50 percent of U.S. households use natural gas for
heating. The period from November to March is when the most fuel
is used for heating in the U.S.  The warmer weather may persist at least until Jan. 18 in
the U.S. Northeast and mid-Atlantic regions, said Matt Rogers,
president of Commodity Weather Group LLC in Bethesda,  Maryland .  Temperatures may reach 5 to 8 degrees above normal in the
regions from Jan. 14 to 18, Rogers said.  At the same time, temperatures are expected to be 5 to 8
degrees below normal across the western U.S.  In New York, the normal average temperature for Jan. 9 is
about 33 degrees, according to MDA. It’s 29 in Boston; 24 in
Chicago; 32 in St. Louis; 53 in Houston; 19 in Calgary,  Alberta ;
42 in  Seattle ; and 55 in  Burbank , California.  To contact the reporter on this story:
