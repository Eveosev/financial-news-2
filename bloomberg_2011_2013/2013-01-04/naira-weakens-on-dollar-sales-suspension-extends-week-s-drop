Nigeria ’s naira declined, extending
this week’s retreat, as the Central Bank of Nigeria’s suspension
of foreign-exchange auctions curbed demand for the currency.  The currency of  Africa ’s biggest oil producer slipped 0.3
percent to 156.7 per dollar on the  interbank market  as of 2:30
p.m. in Lagos, the commercial capital. The currency depreciated
0.4 percent this week.  The central bank, which sells dollars to keep the naira
within a 3 percent band around 155 per dollar, ended twice-
weekly auctions on Dec. 19. The sales will resume Jan. 7, the
Abuja-based bank said Dec. 14.  “The closure of foreign-currency auctions for the second
week has reduced dollar supply, relative to demand from
companies reopening for business,” Sewa Wusu, currency analyst
at Lagos-based Sterling Capital Ltd., said today in a telephone
interview.  Yields on 10-year naira debt fell 16 basis points to 11.52
percent, according to yesterday’s prices compiled on the
Financial Markets Dealers Association website. Borrowing costs
on the nation’s $500 million of Eurobonds due January 2021 fell
four basis points to 3.91 percent today.  Central bank policy makers left their benchmark  interest
rate  unchanged at 12 percent last year to control inflation and
stabilize the naira. The  inflation  rate rose for the second
consecutive month in November to 12.3 percent from 11.7 percent,
the  National Bureau of Statistics  said Dec. 17.  Ghana ’s cedi strengthened 0.3 percent to 1.9015 per dollar
in Accra, the capital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
