Copper pared declines on the London
Metal Exchange after U.S. jobs expanded in December.  The metal for delivery in three months fell 0.9 percent to
$8,092.25 a metric ton by 1:32 p.m. in London, after earlier
today falling as much as 1.3 percent.  Payrolls rose by 155,000 workers last month following a
revised 161,000 advance in November that was more than initially
estimated, Labor Department figures showed today in  Washington .
The median estimate of 82 economists surveyed by Bloomberg
called for a increase of 152,000. The  unemployment rate  held at
7.8 percent, matching the lowest since December 2008.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
