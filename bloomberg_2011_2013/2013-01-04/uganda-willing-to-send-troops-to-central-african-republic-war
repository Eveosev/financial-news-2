Uganda  is willing to contribute
troops to halt fighting in the Central African Republic if the
 African Union  constitutes a force, said Henry Okello Oryem, the
minister of state for international relations.  “If the AU deems it wise and composes an AU force, Uganda
will have no objection,” he said by telephone from the capital,
Kampala. “We can only go in under the AU as we can’t do it
singly.”  Uganda already has an unspecified number of soldiers in the
Central African Republic hunting for the Lord’s Resistance Army
rebels who fled the East African nation in 2005. It also has
more than 6,000 troops in an AU-led mission to support Somalia’s
new government.  The so-called Seleka militia in  Central African Republic  on
Dec. 10 started an assault and headed toward the capital,
Bangui, after accusing President Francois Bozize of failing to
honor a 2008 peace deal. The rebels halted their offensive and
may hold talks with the government in nearby  Gabon  on Jan. 10.  Bozize has asked the rebels to disarm and allow him to
finish his term after winning elections in 2011, while offering
to create a government of national unity.  Central African Republic has been dogged by violence since
its independence from France in 1960, with at least four battles
for Bangui taking place from 1996 to 2003, when Bozize toppled
predecessor Ange-Felix Patasse, whom he served as army chief.  To contact the reporters on this story:
