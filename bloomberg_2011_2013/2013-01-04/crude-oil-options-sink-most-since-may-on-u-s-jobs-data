the lowest since May 2, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Crude oil for February delivery settled at $93.09 a barrel
on the Nymex, extending its advance to 2.5 percent this week,
the most since Sept. 14. Prices increased 17 cents from
yesterday after the Labor Department said payrolls rose by
155,000 workers last month, compared with the forecast for
152,000 in a Bloomberg survey of economists.  The Labor Department also revised the November payroll
increase to 161,000, more than initially estimated. The U.S.
unemployment rate held at 7.8 percent, matching the lowest level
since December 2008.  The most active options in electronic trading today were
February $95 calls, which declined 7 cents to 68 cents a barrel
at 4:16 p.m. on volume of 1,584 contracts. The second-most
active, with 1,544 lots exchanged, were February $90 puts, down
10 cents to 52 cents a barrel.  Bets that prices would fall, or puts, accounted for 57
