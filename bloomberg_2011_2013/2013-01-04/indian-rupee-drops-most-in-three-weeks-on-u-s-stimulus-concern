India ’s rupee fell the most in two
months as concern the  Federal Reserve  will scale back policies
that boost the supply of dollars hurt demand for riskier assets.  Minutes of the Federal Reserve’s last meeting, released
yesterday, showed policy makers expect to end their $85 billion
monthly bond purchases in 2013. The rupee also weakened after
data on Dec. 31 showed India’s current-account deficit widened
to a record $22.3 billion in the quarter ended Sept. 30. Foreign
funds  poured  almost $25 billion into Indian stocks last year.  “There could be fewer dollars available for investment in
emerging-market equities, and this will hurt the rupee,” said
Naveen Raghuvanshi, a trader at  Development Credit Bank Ltd. (DEVB)  in
Mumbai. “Right now we are in risk-off trade.”  The rupee declined 1.1 percent today to 55.0750 per dollar
in Mumbai, the biggest drop since Nov. 5, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The currency, which weakened 3.5 percent
last year after plunging 16 percent in 2011, lost 0.5 percent
this week.  One-month implied volatility, a gauge of expected moves in
exchange rates used to price options, rose 10 basis points
today, or 0.10 percentage point, to 9.80 percent. The rate fell
20 basis points this week after a 190 basis point drop in 2012.  The Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against six
major trading partners, rose for a third day on speculation U.S.
policy makers will struggle to reach an agreement on raising the
nation’s debt limit.  Three-month onshore rupee forwards traded at 56.05 per
dollar, compared with 55.52 yesterday, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Offshore non-deliverable contracts were
at 56.01 versus 55.37. Forwards are agreements to buy or sell
assets at a set price and date. Non-deliverable contracts are
settled in dollars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
