Sugar fell to the lowest level in
more than two weeks in  London  amid a third consecutive year of
surpluses. Cocoa and coffee retreated as commodities slid.  Sugar supplies will be 6.2 million metric tons higher than
demand in the 2012-13 season started in October, according to
the  International Sugar Organization . That’s a third year of
excess supplies. Commodities declined as the dollar rose after
U.S. Federal Reserve policy makers said they may cut cash
infusions this year. A higher dollar reduces the appeal of raw
materials priced in the U.S. currency.  “The market can be expected to remain under pressure,”
German researcher F.O. Licht GmbH said in a report dated
yesterday. There are “ample global supplies,” it said.  White, or refined, sugar for March delivery slid 0.6
percent to $511.60 a ton by 9:48 a.m. on NYSE Liffe in London.
Earlier, the price touched $510 a ton, the lowest since Dec. 20.
Raw sugar for March delivery fell 1 percent to 18.91 cents a
pound on ICE Futures U.S. in New York.  Fed board members said they will probably end their $85
billion monthly bond purchases in 2013, according to minutes of
their Dec. 11-12 meeting released yesterday. The Standard &
Poor’s  GSCI index  of 24 commodities fell as much as 0.9 percent.
Raw sugar fell 27 percent in 2011, the most in a decade, and 16
percent last year on excess supplies globally.  Robusta coffee for March delivery slid 1 percent to $1,926
a ton in London. Arabica coffee for March delivery fell 0.9
percent to $1.4515 a pound in New York.  “We are still seeing a daily increase in the certs and
lots of coffee at origin,” London-based broker Sucden Financial
Ltd. said in a report e-mailed yesterday. Certs are exchange-
certified stockpiles of arabica beans, last year’s worst
performing commodity. “As a result, this downtrend may still
have a little more to say in the early part of this year.”  Cocoa for March delivery was 0.5 percent lower at 1,426
pounds ($2,287) a ton on NYSE Liffe. Cocoa for March delivery
fell 1.3 percent to $2,227 a ton on ICE.  To contact the reporter on this story:
