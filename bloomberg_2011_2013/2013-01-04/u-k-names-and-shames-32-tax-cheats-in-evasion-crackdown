The U.K. tax agency, Her Majesty’s
Revenue and Customs,  published  the names and photographs of
2012’s top tax cheats in a move designed to shame tax-dodgers as
part of a government crackdown on evasion.  The 32 criminals have been sentenced to a combined total of
155 years and 10 months behind bars, HMRC said in a statement in
 London  today.  “Most people play by the rules and pay what they owe, but
HMRC is cracking down on those who don’t,” Exchequer Secretary
to the Treasury David Gauke said in the statement. “We hope
that publishing these pictures will help get across that it
always makes sense to declare all your income, and tax dodgers
are simply storing up trouble for the future.”  The government is spending 994 million pounds ($1.6
billion) over four years to tackle  tax evasion , avoidance and
fraud, aiming to add an annual 7 billion pounds to the
Treasury’s coffers by the fiscal year ending in 2015.  To contact the reporters on this story:
