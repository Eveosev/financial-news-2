MetLife Inc. (MET) , the largest U.S. life
insurer, posted its biggest weekly advance since 2011 on the
prospect that higher bond yields will improve earnings from the
company’s fixed-maturity portfolio.  MetLife climbed 2.4 percent to $35.95 at 4:01 p.m. in  New
York . The New York-based insurer rallied 11 percent this week.  The yield on Treasury  10-year notes  touched an eight-month
high of 1.97 percent earlier today, up from 1.7 percent on Dec.
28. U.S. lawmakers this week averted tax increases for more than
99 percent of households, and Federal Reserve policy makers said
yesterday they may end their $85 billion monthly bond purchases
sometime this year.  “The path of least resistance in yields seems to be a bit
higher now,” said Donald Ellenberger, who oversees about $10
billion as co-head of government and mortgage-backed securities
at  Federated Investors Inc. (FII)  in Pittsburgh.  Higher bond yields help MetLife when the company reinvests
funds from maturing securities in its $378 billion fixed-income
portfolio.  To contact the reporter on this story:
