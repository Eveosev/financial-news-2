Romania ’s central bank should scrap a
“wait and see” approach to monetary policy and start focusing,
together with the government, on boosting the economy, board
member Nicolae Danila told  Ziarul Financiar , adding that he
speaks on this issue as an economics professor.  Policymakers could also accept an inflation rate higher
that the bank’s current target to help resume economic growth,
Danila said, according to the Bucharest-based newspaper. Danila
told the newspaper there’s a need to “rethink in a balanced
manner the central bank’s objectives, its mission and its
role.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
