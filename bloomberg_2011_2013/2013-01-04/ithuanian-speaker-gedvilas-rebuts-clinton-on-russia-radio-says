U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s opposition to  Russia ’s growing economic might in
Europe wasn’t practical, Vydas Gedvilas, the head of Lithuania’s
new parliament, said in an interview with Russian radio.  The international influence of Russian businesses is an
economic reality that European countries must separate from
politics and deal with pragmatically, Gedvilas, whose  Labor
Party  joined a coalition government after October elections,
said on Radio Svoboda yesterday.  Lithuania, which relies on neighboring Russia for supplies
of natural gas, electricity and crude oil, must focus on the
interests of its own people rather that those of the U.S.,
“which is very far away,” Gedvilas said.  The Baltic nation needs to “reboot” its relations with
Russia, like Finland and  Germany  have done, to improve economic
ties and let Russia manage its own democratic processes, he said
in the radio interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
