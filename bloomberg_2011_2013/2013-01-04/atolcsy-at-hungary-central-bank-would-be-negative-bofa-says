The nomination of Hungarian Economy
Minister  Gyorgy Matolcsy  as central bank chief would be “highly
negative” and would weaken market confidence and the forint,
Bank of America Merrill Lynch said.  It would also mean  Hungary ’s benchmark interest rate
wouldn’t fall below 5 percent, Mai Doan, a London-based
economist at Bank of America, wrote yesterday in a research
note. The central bank has cut the rate to 5.75 percent from 7
percent since August.  “A ‘weak’ governor sets the floor for the policy rate at 5
percent, despite the severe weakness in the economy,” Doan
wrote.  Matolcsy is the leading contender to replace Magyar Nemzeti
Bank President  Andras Simor , whose six-year mandate ends March
3, according to local media including news website Index and
weekly Heti Valasz. Matolcsy is already building a team in
anticipation of being appointed, Index reported Jan. 2.  To contact the reporter on this story:
