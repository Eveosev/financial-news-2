OGX Petroleo & Gas Participacoes SA,
the  oil company  controlled by billionaire  Eike Batista , rallied
to a two-month high after saying it started production at a
third well in the Tubarao Azul field.  Shares jumped 3.9 percent to 5.09 reais at 2:11 p.m. in Sao
Paulo, the biggest gain on the benchmark Bovespa index. A close
at that level would be the highest since Oct. 19. The Bovespa
retreated 1.2 percent.  Production at the third well began on Dec. 31, OGX said in
a regulatory filing today. The output at the Tubarao Azul field
in the Campos Basin off the coast of  Rio de Janeiro  was 10,100
barrels of oil equivalent per day before the third well opened,
the company said.  “The new well is expected to produce more than the first
two,” Paula Kovarsky and Diego Mendes, analysts at the
investment bank Itau BBA, wrote in a note to clients published
today. “The connection of the third well is a positive in
itself, especially if higher flow rates are confirmed.”  OGX has advanced 17 percent in the first week of 2013 while
the benchmark Bovespa index gained 2.8 percent during the same
period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
