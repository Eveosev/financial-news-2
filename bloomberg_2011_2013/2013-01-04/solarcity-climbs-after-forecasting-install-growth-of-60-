SolarCity Corp. (SCTY) , the solar-power
provider led by billionaire Elon Musk, rose the most since its
initial public offering last month after saying installations
will climb 60 percent this year.  SolarCity climbed 11 percent to $14.40 at the close in New
York, the most since the shares began trading Dec. 13. The  San
Mateo , California-based company has increased 80 percent since
it debuted at $8, and has now advanced for nine straight days.  Installations of rooftop solar systems will climb to 250
megawatts this year, up from 156 megawatts in 2012, SolarCity
said in a statement yesterday after the close of regular U.S.
trading. The company, which builds solar systems on customers’
rooftops and sells them the electricity, reported a $95 million
net loss in the 12 months through September.  Chief Executive Officer  Lyndon Rive  said Dec. 13 that the
company will become  cash flow  positive by the end of this year
as new customers generate enough revenue to cover the cost of
buying and installing panels. Musk is the company’s chairman,
its largest shareholder and Rive’s cousin.  To contact the reporter on this story:
