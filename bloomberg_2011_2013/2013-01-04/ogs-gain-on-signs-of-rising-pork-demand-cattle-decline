Hog futures gained for the third
straight day on signs of climbing demand for U.S. pork as
purchases increase after the holidays. Cattle prices dropped.  Yesterday, wholesale  pork  jumped 2 percent to 83.1 cents a
pound, the biggest gain since Oct. 4, and meatpackers
slaughtered 433,000 hogs, up 0.9 percent from a week earlier,
U.S. Department of Agriculture data showed.  “The market is supported by the tighter supplies near
term” and the higher wholesale price,  Don Roose , the president
of U.S. Commodities Inc. in  West Des Moines ,  Iowa , said in a
telephone interview. “You’ve got post-holiday buying” after
Christmas and New Year’s, he said.  Hog futures for February settlement rose 0.4 percent to
86.75 cents a pound at 9:53 a.m. on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange. The price gained 0.8 percent in the two previous days.  Cattle futures for February delivery fell 0.2 percent to
$1.33525 a pound.  Feeder-cattle futures for March settlement climbed 0.4
