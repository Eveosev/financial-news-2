The forint snapped two days of gains
and Hungary’s bond yields rebounded from a seven-year low on
concern that U.S.  Federal Reserve  policy makers will end debt
purchases which have fueled investor demand for riskier assets.  Hungary’s currency weakened 0.7 percent to 290.47 per euro
by 10:35 a.m. in Budapest, erasing its advance for the week.
Yields on 10-year notes increased 17 basis points, or 0.17
percentage point, to 6.163 percent after hitting the lowest
since September 2005 yesterday.  Fed board members said they will probably end their $85
billion monthly bond purchases in 2013, according to minutes of
their Dec. 11-12 meeting released yesterday. Additional
liquidity from central banks in the U.S. and  Europe  helped the
forint gain 8 percent in 2012, the second-biggest advance, after
the Polish zloty, among more than 100 currencies tracked by
Bloomberg, while Hungarian bonds returned the most in euro terms
in 2012 after Greek and Portuguese debt.  “The correction of the New Year’s optimism came because of
the Federal Reserve’s minutes,” Gergely Gabler, a Budapest-
based analyst at Equilor Befektetesi Zrt., wrote in a research
report today. “The negative sentiment can also be felt on the
Hungarian market.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
