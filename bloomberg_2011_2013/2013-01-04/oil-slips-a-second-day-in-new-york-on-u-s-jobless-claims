Oil dropped for a second day, erasing
most of its weekly gain in London, after U.S. Federal Reserve
officials signaled the winding down of a stimulus program this
year in the world’s biggest crude user.  Brent crude  dropped as much as 1.6 percent, trimming its
weekly increase to 0.4 percent. Futures pared some of today’s
loss after data showed payrolls increased by 155,000 workers in
the U.S. last month, compared with an estimated 152,000. The
 unemployment rate  held at 7.8 percent. Members of the  Federal
Open Market Committee  said they will probably end their $85
billion monthly bond purchases sometime in 2013, according to
minutes of its latest meeting released yesterday.  “The U.S. is at a dangerous point where it could declare
victory too early,” said Guy Wolf, a strategist at London-based
commodities broker Marex Spectron Group Ltd., who predicts Brent
will trade from $100 to $125 this quarter. “The risks to growth
estimates in the U.S. in the second half are quite high. Removal
of monetary stimulus combined with a fiscal tightening could be
disastrous.”  Brent for February settlement slid as much as $1.76 to
$110.38 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe
exchange. It traded for $111.02 at 1:38 p.m. local time.  West  Texas  Intermediate for February delivery fell as much
as $1.40 to $91.52 a barrel on the  New York  Mercantile Exchange.
The graded has added 1.4 percent this week. Brent was $18.82
more than WTI, compared with $19.27 yesterday.  Doji Candlestick  Loading programs for North Sea Oseberg crude will probably
be released today, followed by Brent, Ekofisk and Forties on
Jan. 7, according to two people with knowledge of the schedules
who asked not to be identified because the information is
confidential.  WTI is declining as a technical formation signals buying
interest is waning after a rally at the start of this week,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Futures yesterday
closed 1 cent a barrel above the opening price, creating a
cross-shaped candlestick known as a “doji.” Prices changed
direction after a similar pattern on Dec. 24. Crude has chart
support along its 200-day moving average, around $91.76 today.  The Federal Reserve committee members were split on how
long the bond purchases should last. Participants who provided
estimates were “approximately evenly divided” between those
who said it would be appropriate to end the purchases around
mid-2013 and those who said they should continue beyond that
date, according to the record of the FOMC’s Dec. 11 to Dec. 12
gathering released yesterday in  Washington .  Reduce Stimulus  Payrolls rose by 155,000 workers last month following a
revised 161,000 advance in November that was more than initially
estimated, Labor Department figures showed today in Washington.
The median estimate of 82 economists surveyed by Bloomberg
called for an increase of 152,000. The  unemployment rate  held at
7.8 percent, matching the lowest since December 2008.  “The FOMC minutes made it clearer that the path to reduce
stimulus is there,” said  Jonathan Barratt , the chief executive
officer of Barratt’s Bulletin, a commodity newsletter in Sydney.
Some investors “have used this as an excuse to sell oil
overnight,” he said.  The industry-funded American Petroleum Institute yesterday
reported U.S. crude inventories dropped 12 million barrels last
week to 358.5 million. The Energy Department is scheduled to
release its weekly report at 11 a.m. in Washington today, two
days later than usual, and 30 minutes after its regular time,
because of the New Year holiday.  The government report may show stockpiles fell by 1 million
barrels to 370.1 million in the seven days ended Dec. 28,
according to the median of 10 analyst estimates. That would be a
third weekly decline and the sixth drop in seven weeks.  Seaway Pipeline  Enterprise Products Partners LP (EPD)  and  Enbridge Inc. (ENB)  plan to
resume service on the 500-mile (805-kilometer) Seaway pipeline
at full rates next week after more than doubling capacity.  Seaway, which runs from Cushing,  Oklahoma , to Freeport,
Texas, may reduce a glut in the U.S. Midwest and shrink imports
to the  Gulf Coast , home to about half of the country’s refining
facilities. Supplies at Cushing, the delivery point for WTI
futures, rose to a record 49.2 million barrels on Dec. 21,
Energy Department data show.  Prices may rise next week on speculation that stronger
economic growth will boost fuel demand, a Bloomberg survey
showed. Fourteen of 24 analysts and traders, or 58 percent,
forecast an increase through Jan. 11. Five respondents, or 21
percent, predicted a drop. Five said it would be little changed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
