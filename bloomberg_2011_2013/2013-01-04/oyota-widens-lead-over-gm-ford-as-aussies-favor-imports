Toyota Motor Corp. (7203)  widened its lead
over  General Motors Co. (GM)  in the Australian car market last year,
lifting sales by 20 percent as the strength of the local
currency favored imports over domestically made models.  Mazda Motor Corp. (7261)  and  Hyundai Motor Co. (005380)  also overtook  Ford
Motor Co. (F)  in sales, according to annual data from Australia’s
Federal Chamber of Automotive Industries released today. Imports
rose 12 percent to 972,236 vehicles while local producers cut
output, shrinking their sales by 1.5 percent to 139,796 units.  GM’s Holden unit, Toyota and Ford -- the three carmakers
that produce locally -- have announced almost 1,000 job cuts in
total over the past year as the Australian dollar’s appreciation
made local manufacturing uncompetitive. The government, which
halved  import tariffs  to 5 percent at the start of 2010, has
pledged a A$5.4 billion ($5.6 billion) package to support the
domestic car industry until 2020.  “For the second successive year a small imported car, the
Mazda 3, is  Australia ’s most popular model,” Tony Weber, chief
executive officer of the Federal Chamber, said in a statement.
The car ended the 15-year dominance of Holden’s locally built
Commodore when it became the country’s bestseller in 2011, based
on data from the trade body.  About 44,000 units of the Mazda 3 were sold last year, a
6.5 percent gain from 2011.  The Australian dollar has been the best-performing major
currency against the  U.S. dollar  in the past three years,
gaining 16 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Market Record  Total new vehicle sales rose 10 percent to a record 1.1
million in 2012. The increase was driven by sports-utility
vehicles and four-wheel drive pickups, whose sales both
increased 25 percent.  SUV sales were almost 62,000 higher than in 2011,
accounting for about three-fifths of the improvement in the
total market.  Market leader Toyota’s sales increased to 218,176 units
from 181,624, the trade body said.  Ford has been manufacturing cars in Australia since it
 built a plant  in  Melbourne  to assemble Model T cars in 1925. The
company will cut production at the local unit by about 29
percent and fire one in seven workers at its main plant, as
sales of its flagship Falcon car slumped, Ford said in July.  That model, which Ford has produced in the country since
1960, saw sales slump 25 percent last year and doesn’t rank
among the 10 best-selling models.  Among the top 10, the Holden Commodore and the Holden Cruze
were the only models whose sales fell in 2012, declining 25
percent and 14 percent respectively.  To contact the reporter on this story:
