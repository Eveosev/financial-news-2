India ’s service industries expanded
at a faster pace in December, a private survey showed, after the
government overhauled economic policies to revive growth.  The purchasing managers’ index rose to 55.6 from 52.1 in
November, HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics said in a
statement today. A number above 50 indicates growth. Services
account for about 57 percent of gross domestic product, Finance
Ministry data shows.  India’s efforts to rival China as the fastest-growing major
emerging nation have been hurt by  budget  and trade deficits and
bottlenecks that have stoked inflation. The government since
mid-September has stepped up efforts to lure more foreign
investment, curb subsidies and stem a drop in exports.  “There are recovery signs,” said Rupa Rege Nitsure, an
economist at  Bank of Baroda  in Mumbai. “But sentiment is still
very subdued.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
