Eastman Kodak Co. (EKDKQ) , the bankrupt
photography company, was sued by Japan’s  Kyocera Corp. (6971)  for
allegedly infringing more than a dozen U.S. patents with its
printers and digital cameras.  Kodak, based in Rochester, New York, will cause
“irreparable harm” to Kyoto-based Kyocera if the infringement
isn’t stopped, plaintiff’s lawyers said in a complaint filed
today in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan.  Kyocera is seeking a jury trial and unspecified damages
from Kodak, which has been trying to sell some of its own
patents to pay creditors.  Kodak sought bankruptcy protection in January 2012, citing
$5.1 billion in assets and $6.75 billion in debt, as the
transition to digital photography eroded the company’s film-
based business.  Christopher Veronda , a Kodak spokesman, didn’t immediately
return voice and e-mail messages seeking comment on the lawsuit.  The bankruptcy case is In re Eastman Kodak Co., 12-10202,
U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
