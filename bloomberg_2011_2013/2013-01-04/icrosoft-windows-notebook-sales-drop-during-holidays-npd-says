Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) ’s Windows notebook
sales declined during the year-end holiday season as consumers
shunned traditional computers and flocked instead to other types
of electronics, according to NPD Group.  Windows notebook holiday unit sales fell 11 percent,
according to the Port Washington, New York-based researcher.
Sales of Windows notebooks that cost less than $500 fell 16
percent, NPD said today.  The introduction of the new Windows 8 software failed to
stoke much demand for notebooks boasting Microsoft’s flagship
operating system, NPD said. The figures released today exclude
tablets, such as Microsoft’s Surface and  Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s iPad.  “Despite the hype, and hope, around the launch of Windows
8, the new operating system did little to boost holiday sales or
improve the year-long Windows notebook sales decline,” the
researcher wrote in a statement.  Apple MacBook sales also declined 6 percent during the
period, according to NPD.  To contact the reporter on this story:
