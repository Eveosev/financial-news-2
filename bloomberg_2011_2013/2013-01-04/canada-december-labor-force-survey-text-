in December 2012.  In Prince  Edward Island , employment increased by 1,300 and

in this industry to a level similar to that of December 2011.  Employment in construction rose by 18,000 in December.
Despite this increase, employment in this industry was little
changed from 12 months earlier.  Following an increase the previous month, employment
declined by 42,000 in professional, scientific and technical
services in December. This decline brought employment down
69,000 (-5.1%) on a year-over-year basis.  Employment in public administration declined by 13,000 in
December, and was below its level of 12 months earlier by 23,000
(-2.3%).  Over the year, the highest employment growth rates were in
educational services (+8.5%); finance, insurance, real estate
and leasing (+6.4%); business, building and other support

and was 14.1% in December.  Among persons aged 55 and over, employment was little
changed in December, and increased by 164,000 (+5.3%) on a year-
over-year basis, driven in part by population aging.  Quarterly update for the territories  The Labour Force Survey also collects labour market
information about the territories. This information is produced
monthly in the form of three-month moving averages. The
following data are not seasonally adjusted; therefore,
comparisons should only be made on a year-over-year basis.  In the fourth quarter of 2012, employment levels in all
three territories were similar to those in the fourth quarter of
2011. The unemployment rates were 6.1% in Yukon, 7.4% in
 Northwest Territories  and 14.2% in Nunavut in the fourth quarter
of 2012, little changed from the fourth quarter of 2011.  Note to readers  Annual average estimates for 2012 are now available on
CANSIM (tables 282-0001 to 282-0219).  The Labour Force Survey (LFS) estimates are based on a
sample and are therefore subject to sampling variability. As a
result, monthly estimates will show more variability than trends
observed over longer time periods. Estimates for smaller
geographic areas or industries also have more variability. For
an explanation of sampling variability of estimates and how to
use standard errors to assess this variability, consult the
‘Estimates quality’ section of the publication Labour Force
Information (71-001-X, free).  The employment rate is the number of employed persons as a
percentage of the population 15 years of age and over. The rate
for a particular group (for example, youth aged 15 to 24) is the
number employed in that group as a percentage of the population
for that group.  The unemployment rate is the number unemployed as a
percentage of the labour force (employed and unemployed).  The participation rate is the number of employed and
unemployed as a percentage of the population. For more detailed
information, see the Guide to the Labour Force Survey (71-543-G,
free).  Unless otherwise stated, this release presents seasonally
adjusted estimates, which facilitates comparisons by removing
the effects of seasonal variations. For more information on
seasonal adjustment, see Seasonal adjustment and identifying
economic trends ( http://www5.statcan.gc.ca/bsolc/olc-cel/colc -
cel?catno=11-010-X201000311141&amp;lang=fra) .  Revision  Seasonally adjusted estimates from the LFS will be revised
using the latest seasonal factors, going back three years
(January 2010 onwards). The revised estimates will be available
on CANSIM (tables 282-0087 to 282-0094, 282-0100, 282-0116 and
282-0117) on February 1, 2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
