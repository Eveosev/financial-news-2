Indonesia ’s rupiah fell by the most
in a month this week on concern last year’s current-account
deficit was more than the official forecast. Government bonds
rose, pushing the 10-year yield to the lowest level in 11 months.  PT Mandiri Sekuritas (BMRI) , a unit of the nation’s largest lender,
said yesterday the shortfall probably exceeded the 2.4 percent
of gross domestic product predicted by the central bank on Dec.
11. Barclays Plc estimated yesterday the gap was 2.5 percent, a
day after the government reported  trade  deficits of $478 million
and $1.9 billion for November and October, respectively.  “There is pressure on the rupiah to reach the 10,000 per
dollar level,” said Taufan Tito, a foreign-exchange dealer at
PT Bank Rakyat Indonesia in Jakarta. “The December trade
deficit was probably wider than November’s, given the dollar
demand from importers then, and the current-account deficit will
certainly exceed the central bank’s forecast.”  The rupiah fell 0.5 percent this week to 9,685 per dollar
as of 3:29 p.m. in Jakarta, the biggest decline since the five
days ended Dec. 7, prices from local banks compiled by Bloomberg
show. The currency dropped 0.3 percent today and reached 9,785
on Jan. 2, matching a Dec. 21 level that was the weakest since
September 2009.  Its one-month implied volatility, a measure of expected
moves in exchange rates used to price options, was steady at 5.7
percent today and this week.  Global funds  added 29.5 trillion rupiah ($3 billion) to
their local-currency government bond holdings last quarter, the
most since the three months through June 2010, finance ministry
data show.  The yield on the government’s 5.625 percent notes due May
2023 dropped eight basis points this week to 5.11 percent, the
lowest level since Feb. 9, according to prices from the Inter
Dealer Market Association. The yield fell two basis points, or
0.02 percentage point, today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
