Wheat futures fell to the lowest
since June on signs of declining demand for supplies from the
U.S., the world’s biggest exporter.  Shippers sold 402,439 metric tons in the week through Dec.
27, down 60 percent from the prior week, the U.S. Department of
Agriculture said in a report today. The Christmas holiday on
Dec. 25 and lower prices from other exporters accounted for the
decline, said Mike Zuzolo, the president of Global Commodity
Analytics & Consulting in Lafayette,  Indiana .  Overseas importers are “still able to find lower-priced
wheat and more-strategically placed wheat instead of having to
come to the U.S.,” Zuzolo said by telephone.  Wheat futures for March delivery slumped 0.7 percent to
$7.505 a bushel at 10:31 a.m. on the Chicago Board of Trade,
after touching $7.4875, the lowest since June 29. The price
through yesterday plunged 13 percent since the end of November.  In the U.S., wheat is the fourth-largest crop, valued at
$14.4 billion in 2011, behind corn, soybeans and hay, government
data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
