American teenager Mikaela Shiffrin
won her second World Cup skiing slalom of the season today in
Croatia to take the lead in the standings.  Shiffrin, 17, had a combined time of 2 minutes, 01.73
seconds over two runs on the Crveni Spust slope in Zagreb to
beat Sweden’s Frida Hansdotter by 1.19 seconds. Canadian Erin
Mielzynski was 1.76 seconds back in third place.  Shiffrin led by 0.35 seconds after the first run and had
the fastest second-run time of 1:02.47. She now has 336 points
to move to the top of the slalom  standings  by 26 points over
Slovenia’s  Tina Maze .  Maze was second behind Shiffrin after the first run, but
didn’t finish her second attempt. The 29-year-old continues to
lead the overall World Cup standings with 1,139 points, 452
points more than German Maria Hoefl-Riesch, who finished sixth
today.  Four-time World Cup champion Lindsey Vonn of the U.S.
returned to training yesterday in Europe after taking a two-week
break to recover from fatigue caused by a stomach illness
earlier this season. The 28-year-old anticipates competing in
next week’s downhill and super-G races in St. Anton,  Austria ,
