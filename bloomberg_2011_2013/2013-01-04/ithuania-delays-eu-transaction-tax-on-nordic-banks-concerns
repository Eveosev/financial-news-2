Lithuania postponed plans to adopt a
European Union financial-transaction tax, saying Nordic lenders
with local subsidiaries in the Baltic nation question the move.  “We’ve decided to delay the decision to examine the many
questions raised about what will be taxed and how it will affect
the local units of foreign banks,” Prime Minister Algirdas Butkevicius said today in Vilnius, the capital. “I’ll be
traveling to  Sweden  to meet with banks’ top management.”  Butkevicius had said Dec. 14, the day after he took office,
that Lithuania would this month become the 12th country to
approve the tax.  EU Tax Commissioner Algirdas Semeta, a former Lithuanian
finance minister, backs creating a levy for willing EU nations
to make the common market stronger and fairer. Subsidiaries of
Stockholm-based  Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken AB (SEBA) ,  Swedbank AB (SWEDA) 
and  Nordea Bank AB (NDA)  controlled 65 percent of Lithuanian banking
assets at the end of September, while units of  Norway ’s DNB Bank
ASA and Denmark’s  Danske Bank AS (DANSKE)  held another 21 percent.  Eleven countries, including Germany, France, Italy and
Estonia have signed up to the tax. The levy risks curbing Baltic
liquidity, Nasdaq OMX Group’s vice president for the region,
Arminta Saladziene, said Dec. 6 in an interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
