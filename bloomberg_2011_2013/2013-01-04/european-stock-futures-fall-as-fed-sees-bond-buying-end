European (SXXP)  stocks climbed to their
highest in more than 22 months, as U.S. reports showed employers
added more workers in December and the services industry
expanded more than forecast.  ThromboGenics NV added 3.3 percent after confirming the
launch date for its Jetrea vision restoration treatment.
 Fresnillo Plc (FRES) , the world’s biggest primary silver producer, slid
4 percent after UBS AG downgraded the shares.  Randgold Resources
Ltd. (RRS)  lost 4.1 percent as the price of the metal fell.  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index advanced 0.4 percent to 287.83
at the close of trading, its highest since February 2011. The
gauge rose 3.3 percent this week.  “The numbers are not good enough for the market to really
want to surge on but the market has accepted them quite well,”
 David Buik , a market strategist at Cantor Index Ltd. in  London ,
said, referring to the U.S. payrolls report.  Employers in the U.S. added workers in December at about
the same pace as the prior month, and the unemployment rate
matched a four-year low.  Payrolls rose by 155,000 in December, following a revised
161,000 advance in November that was more than initially
estimated, Labor Department figures showed today. The median
estimate of 82 economists surveyed by Bloomberg called for an
increase of 152,000. The unemployment rate held at 7.8 percent,
matching the lowest since December 2008.  The Institute for Supply Management’s index of U.S. non-
manufacturing businesses rose to 56.1 in December from 54.7 a
month earlier, the Tempe, Arizona-based group said. The median
forecast of 66 economists surveyed by Bloomberg projected a
decline to 54.1. Readings above 50 signal expansion.  Fed Minutes  Federal Open Market Committee minutes, released yesterday
in  Washington , showed a split on how long the $85 billion
monthly bond-purchase program should last. Participants who
provided estimates were “approximately evenly divided” between
those who said it would be appropriate to end the purchases
around mid-2013 and those in favor of continuing beyond that
time.  “There is obviously severe doubt in the mind of many of
the members of the Federal Reserve that quantitative easing is
actually the answer to the problems,” Buik said. “Still, QE
has underwritten the value of equities over the past three
years, so that is why I think it is a bold move to consider
ending stimulus.”  National benchmark indexes rose in 14 of the 18 western
European markets.  France ’s CAC 40 gained 0.2 percent, the U.K.’s
FTSE 100 increased 0.7 percent and  Germany ’s DAX advanced 0.3
percent.  ThromboGenics Gains  ThromboGenics (THR)  added 3.3 percent to 44.32 euros, its highest
price since at least July 2006, after it confirmed its U.S.
launch date of Jan. 14 for its Jetrea vision treatment.  Bankia SA (BKIA) , the lender that received the largest Spanish
bailout, surged 49 percent to 61.5 euro cents, for the biggest
gain on the Stoxx 600.  Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena SpA (BMPS)  rose 12 percent to 26.4
euro cents, leading gains in  Italy .  Sonova Holding AG (SOON)  advanced 2.9 percent to 107.7 Swiss
francs after Bank of America’s Merrill Lynch unit upgraded the
maker of hearing health-care products to buy from neutral.  BP Plc (BP/) , whose Macondo well exploded in 2010, advanced 2.7
percent to 453.5 pence. Transocean Ltd.’s settlement of federal
claims related to the accident could bring BP closer to one of
its own before a civil trial in late February, Exane BNP Paribas
analysts wrote.  Fresnillo Drops  Fresnillo slid 4 percent to 1,810 pence after UBS
downgraded the shares to neutral from buy, saying the stock has
outperformed silver and its peers. The price of the metal today
fell to its lowest since August.  Randgold Resources, a gold producer in West Africa, lost
4.1 percent to 5,975 pence as the price of metal dropped. A
gauge of commodity-company shares fell 0.9 percent, for the
worst performance of the 19 industry groups on the Stoxx 600.  Marks & Spencer Group Plc (MKS) , the U.K.’s biggest clothing
retailer, retreated 3.1 percent to 376.4 pence. Nomura Holdings
Inc. lowered its 2013 pre-tax estimates for the retailer to 666
million pounds ($1.07 billion) from 694 million pounds, citing a
fall in general merchandise sales.  To contact the reporter on this story:
