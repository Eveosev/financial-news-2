Japanese bonds slid after stocks
started the year higher and the yen weakened to a 2 1/2-year
low, damping demand for the refuge of government debt.  Thirty-year yields climbed to levels unseen since Dec. 2,
2011, tilting the so-called yield curve to the steepest level in
17 months.  Japan ’s newly installed Prime Minister Shinzo Abe
said in a New Year’s statement that “ bold ” monetary policy is
one of the three prongs of his economic measures.  “The domestic and overseas stock markets plus the yen’s
depreciation are widening fluctuations” in bond yields for now,
said Yuya Yamashita, a rates strategist in Tokyo at JPMorgan
Chase & Co. Still, calm may return to the  bond market  amid
expectations that monetary easing will increase, he said.  The yield on the 30-year bond rose to as high as 1.995
percent before trading at 1.99 percent as of 4:52 p.m. in Tokyo
from 1.975 percent on Dec. 28, according to Japan Bond Trading
Co., the nation’s largest interdealer debt broker. The 1.9
percent security maturing September 2042 fell 0.275 yen to
98.32. Forty-year yields added two basis points to 2.17 percent,
the most since Nov. 7. Japan’s financial markets had been closed
since Dec. 28 for the New Year holiday.  The benchmark 10-year rate increased four basis points to
0.835 percent, the highest since Sept. 13. The 20-year yield
touched 1.79 percent, the most since April 5, before moving to
1.78 percent from 1.755 percent. The five-year yield climbed to
0.2 percent, a level unseen since Nov. 2, while the two-year
rate was little changed at 0.095 percent.  Lead 10-year bond futures dropped 0.33 to 143.32 after
touching 143.20, the least since May 28.  Stocks Jump  Japan’s  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average  jumped  2.8 percent after
the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index in the U.S. on Jan. 2 reached
its highest close since September. The yen touched 87.91 per
dollar, the weakest since July 28, 2010, extending its longest
series of weekly declines since 1989. A weaker yen boosts the
value of overseas sales at Japanese companies when repatriated.  Abe vowed in a Jan. 1 message to focus his newly appointed
Cabinet’s efforts on reviving the country’s economy, which has
shrunk almost 10 percent over the past half-decade. His  Liberal
Democratic Party , which swept to power in lower house elections
on Dec. 16, has called for “bold monetary easing” from the
central bank until inflation reaches 2 percent.  Demand for longer-dated debt waned before auctions of 10-
and 30-year debt next week, according to Makoto Suzuki, a senior
bond strategist in  Tokyo  at Okasan Securities Co.  “It’s hard to buy before the debt auctions,” he said.
“From a supply-and-demand perspective, there’s a risk that
long-term yields will climb.”  The Ministry of Finance will sell 2.3 trillion yen ($26
billion) in 10-year debt on Jan. 8 and 700 billion yen of 30-
year bonds on Jan. 10.  To contact the reporters on this story:
