Corn traded near a six-month low,
heading for the longest streak of weekly losses in 15 months, on
signs shipments will increase from  Brazil , set to be the third-
biggest exporter. Soybeans rallied from a six-week low.  Corn for March delivery dropped as much as 0.3 percent to
$6.87 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade and was little
changed at $6.885 by 11:04 a.m. in Singapore. Prices are down
0.8 percent this week, set for a fifth straight decline in the
worst run since September 2011. The most-active contract dropped
to $6.85 yesterday, the lowest level since July 3.  Corn climbed 8 percent in 2012, reaching a record $8.49 on
Aug. 10, as drought scorched the U.S. Midwest. Brazilian soybean
and corn shipments from Paranagua, the country’s biggest grain
and oilseeds port, will rise as much as 14 percent this year on
large crops, the port said yesterday. High prices have rationed
demand and without further supply shocks they may have peaked
for this marketing year, according to Credit Suisse Group AG.  “The U.S. has lost a lot of export business to Brazil,”
said Victor Thianpiriya, an analyst at Australia & New Zealand
Banking Group Ltd. in  Singapore . “We’re not going to see a lot
of positions until the January USDA reports, where we can get a
good idea of what first quarter corn use looks like in the
U.S.,” he said, referring to the U.S. Department of Agriculture
by its initials. The agency will update its  estimates  on Jan. 11.  Scattered showers, thunderstorms and no significant hot
episodes will maintain favorable growing conditions from Rio
Grande do Sul to Mato Grosso do Sul during the next 10 days,
Telvent DTN said yesterday.  Soybeans for March delivery climbed as much as 0.7 percent
to $13.96 a bushel and traded at $13.94, set for a 1.7 percent
decline this week. Prices touched $13.725 yesterday, the lowest
since Nov. 16, after  China  scrapped its third U.S. purchase in
two weeks. China is the world’s largest importer.  Wheat for March delivery was little changed at $7.5575 a
bushel, poised for a 3 percent decline this week. That’ll be the
fifth straight weekly loss and the worst run since October 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
