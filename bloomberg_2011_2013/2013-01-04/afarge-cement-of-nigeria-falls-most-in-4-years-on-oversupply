Lafarge Cement WAPCO Nigeria Plc (WAPCO) , the
second-biggest producer of the building material by market
value, declined the most in more than four years after a
newspaper reported it may halt output because of product
oversupply.  The stock fell for a fourth day, declining 5.2 percent to
52.12 naira by the close in Lagos, Nigeria’s commercial capital.
That’s the largest drop since Oct. 31, 2008, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Lafarge may shut production in response to a glut in the
country’s cement market, Punch newspaper reported on Dec. 31,
citing Plant Manager Lanre Opakunle. The Ewekoro, southwestern
Nigeria-based company has already cut output by half, the
newspaper cited him as saying.  The excess supply is affecting all Nigerian cement
companies, David Adonri, chief executive officer of Lambeth
Trust and Investment Co., said by phone from Lagos. “I expect
it to be a temporary setback that will be addressed soon by the
government.”  Dangote Cement Plc (DANGCEM) , Nigeria’s biggest company by market
value and  Africa ’s largest producer of cement, shut its Gboko
plant in central Benue state because of a glut in the market
from cheap imports, it said on Dec. 6. Dangote’s shares were
unchanged at 125 naira.  Lafarge WAPCO, a unit of the world’s biggest cement
producer  Lafarge SA (LG)  took loans worth 45 billion naira ($287
million) to expand its plant.  The stock has fallen 11 percent in 2013, compared with a
1.4 percent rise in the Nigerian Stock Exchange All-Share  Index. (NGSEINDX)   To contact the reporter on this story:
