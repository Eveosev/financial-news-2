Tengizchevroil LLP, a  Chevron Corp (CVX) .-
led Kazakh oil venture, will reach full production as soon as
possible after power at gas-processing and injection plants was
restored.  “Operations at Tengiz partially lost electric power on
Jan. 3 due to a malfunction in one of its power-generation
turbines and failure” of the Kazakhstan Electricity Grid
Operating Co.’s system, Atyrau-based Tengizchevroil said today
in an e-mailed statement without giving a specific date for full
production.  The Astana-based grid operator said in a separate e-mail
that the problem was with the venture’s electricity lines.  To contact the reporter on this story:
