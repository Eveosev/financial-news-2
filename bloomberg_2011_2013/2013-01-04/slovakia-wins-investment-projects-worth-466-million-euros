Slovakia last year won investment
projects worth 466 million euros ($606 million), said Sario, the
government agency for promoting foreign investment.  The 18 projects completed in 2012 are set to create 3,228
jobs, the Bratislava, Slovakia-based  agency  said in an e-mailed
statement today. An additional 14 projects representing about
800 million euros in investment and 5,000 jobs have yet to be
reviewed by the government, Sario said.  The eastern euro-area member relies on foreign investment
to export-driven industries to maintain  growth , which has been
slowing due to the sovereign-debt crisis in the region. Most of
the projects are related to car and electronics industries such
as an expansion of activities by  Continental AG (CON) ,  Germany â€™s auto-
part maker, Sario said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
