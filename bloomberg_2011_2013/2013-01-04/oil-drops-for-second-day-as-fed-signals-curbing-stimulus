Oil gained in  New York , capping the
biggest weekly advance in three months, after U.S. employers
hired more workers than expected in December.  Prices increased 17 cents after the Labor Department said
payrolls rose by 155,000 workers last month, exceeding the
152,000 forecast in a Bloomberg survey of economists. Futures
were down for most of the day as the Energy Department reported
gasoline and distillate fuel supplies jumped a combined 7.14
million barrels last week.  “The payroll number is stronger than expected and it gives
the market a boost,” said Rich Ilczyszyn, chief market
strategist and founder of Iitrader.com in  Chicago . “The large
build in gasoline and distillates put a lid on  oil prices .”  West Texas Intermediate for February delivery settled at
$93.09 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . The grade
advanced 2.5 percent this week, the most since Sept. 14.  Brent for February settlement dropped 83 cents, or 0.7
percent, to end at $111.31 a barrel on the London-based ICE
Futures Europe exchange. The North Sea grade was $18.22 more
than WTI, compared with $19.22 yesterday.  Trading volume in WTI was 4.8 percent above the 100-day
average at 3:55 p.m. in New York, while Brent was 8.1 percent
higher.  The Labor Department also revised the November payroll
increase to 161,000, more than initially estimated. The U.S.
 unemployment rate  held at 7.8 percent, matching the lowest level
since December 2008.  U.S. Payrolls  “The payroll number is encouraging,”  said  Michael Lynch ,
president of Strategic Energy & Economic Research in Winchester,
 Massachusetts .  The economy created 1.84 million jobs for a second straight
year, the Labor Department said today. Annual revisions to the
household survey showed the unemployment rate averaged 8.1
percent in 2012, the least in four years.  Equities advanced following the jobs report, with the
 Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  poised for its biggest weekly rally
in 13 months.  Oil settled at a three-month high on Jan. 2 after U.S.
lawmakers passed a bill on Jan. 1 to undo automatic tax
increases and spending cuts that had threatened growth in the
world’s biggest oil-consuming country. President  Barack Obama 
signed it into law on Jan. 2.  Gasoline Inventories  Futures fell in intraday trading today after the Energy
Department said gasoline stocks rose 2.57 million barrels to
225.7 million in the week ended Dec. 28, the most since March.
It exceeded the median forecast for a 2.2 million-barrel
increase in a Bloomberg survey of 10 analysts.  Distillate fuels, including diesel and heating oil, jumped
4.57 million barrels to 124 million, more than triple the
forecast 1.25 million-barrel gain.  Gasoline for February delivery dropped 1.2 percent to
settle at $2.7643 a gallon on the Nymex. Heating oil for
February delivery fell 0.2 percent to $3.0177 a gallon.  Crude stockpiles dropped 11.1 million barrels to 359.9
million. The inventories were forecast to decline by 1 million.
Supplies at Cushing,  Oklahoma , the delivery point for New York
futures, increased to a record 49.8 million barrels.  Oil stockpiles have decreased during December for the past
six years because of inventory shifts for tax and accounting
purposes. Companies in Gulf Coast states minimize supplies at
the end of the year to reduce local taxes.  Crude Stockpiles  “Refineries were trying to lower their crude inventories
for tax purposes at the end of year,” said  Chris Barber , a
senior analyst at Energy Security Analysis Inc. in Wakefield,
Massachusetts. “So I don’t think the drop is a really bullish
sign, especially when you see product stocks build.”  The Energy Department released its weekly report two days
later than usual because of the holiday on New Year’s Day.  WTI slid in 2012 as the U.S. shale boom deepened a glut at
Cushing, Oklahoma, America’s biggest storage hub and the
delivery point for the New York contract. That left it at an
average $17.48 a barrel below Brent last year, compared with a
premium of about 95 cents in the 10 years through 2010.  Electronic trading volume on the Nymex was 462,333
contracts as of 3:55 p.m. Volume totaled 434,724 contracts
yesterday, 11 percent below the three-month average. Open
interest was 1.48 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
