Treasury 10-year note yields fell
from a more than eight-month high after the U.S.  unemployment
rate  in December was higher than forecast, boosting speculation
the Federal Reserve’s stimulus efforts may not end anytime soon.  U.S. government debt  declined earlier after minutes
released yesterday of the Fed’s last meeting showed policy
makers might end its third round of monthly bond purchases under
quantitative easing this year. Treasuries pared earlier losses
today as Labor Department figures showed the U.S.  unemployment
rate  was 7.8 percent last month, matching November’s rate that
was revised up. The median estimate of 78 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg was 7.7 percent.  “The Fed has to continue to provide the stimulus while we
are in dire straits,” said  Michael Franzese , senior vice
president of fixed-income trading at ED&F Man Capital Markets in
New York. “The Fed is keeping rates low until 2015. That hasn’t
wavered.”  Ten-year note yields declined one basis point, or 0.01
percentage point, to 1.90 percent at 5 p.m. New York time,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader data. They earlier touched
1.97 percent, the highest level since April 26. The yield fell
to a record low of 1.38 percent on July 25. The price of the
1.625 percent security rose 1/8, or $1.25 cents per $1,000 face
value, to 97 17/32.  The 30-year bond yield declined three basis points to 3.10
percent after reaching 3.18 percent, the highest since April 25.  Net Longs  Hedge-fund managers and other large speculators decreased
their net-long position in 30-year bond futures to the least in
almost two months in the week ending Jan. 1, according to U.S.
Commodity Futures Trading Commission data.  Speculative long positions, or bets prices will rise,
outnumbered short positions by  435 contracts  on the Chicago
Board of Trade, the least since Nov. 6. Net-long positions fell
by 4,270 contracts, or 91 percent, from a week earlier, the
Washington-based commission said in its Commitments of Traders
report.  Large speculators increased their long positions over short
positions in 10-year note futures by 78,927 contracts, up from
74,151 contracts the previous week. Meanwhile, large speculators
increased their net-long bets on  two-year futures  by 163,545
contracts, near the most since August.  Term Premium  U.S.  government securities  traded today close to the least
expensive levels in eight months. The 10-year term premium, a
model created by economists at the Fed that includes
expectations for  interest rates , growth and inflation, touched
negative 0.67 percent, the least costly since May.  A negative reading indicates investors are willing to
accept yields below what’s considered fair value. The average
last year was negative 0.77 percent.  Treasury  volume  rose today to the most in almost four
months, according to ICAP Plc, the largest inter-dealer broker
of U.S. government debt. Volume rose to $403 billion in New
York, the most since Sept. 13. Daily volume averaged $239
billion in 2012.  Volatility in Treasuries reached the highest level in
almost two months yesterday. Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s
MOVE index, which measures price swings of U.S. government
securities based on options, rose to 63.5 basis points, the most
since Nov. 6. The 2012 average was 69.8 basis points.  A separate report today showed payrolls rose by 155,000
workers last month, following a revised 161,000 advance in
November that was more than initially estimated, the Labor
Department said in  Washington . The median estimate of 82
economists surveyed by Bloomberg called for a increase of
152,000.  Stimulus Terminus  Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond President  Jeffrey Lacker 
said further monetary stimulus is unlikely to boost growth and
will “test the limits” of the U.S. central bank’s credibility.  “At some point, we will need to withdraw stimulus by
raising interest rates and reducing the size of our balance
sheet, and the larger our balance sheet, the more vulnerable we
will be to seemingly minor miscalibrations in policy,” Lacker
said in prepared remarks to the Maryland Bankers Association in
Baltimore.  The Fed said after its Dec. 11-12 meeting said it would
hold borrowing costs low “at least as long” as the
unemployment rate remains above 6.5 percent and inflation
projections are for no more than 2.5 percent. The jobless rate
had stayed above 8 percent since February 2009 until it broke
the trend in September.  “At 7.8, that tells us we still have an unemployment
problem and the Fed will still be engaged,” Mohamed El-Erian,
chief executive officer of Pacific Investment Management Co.,
said on Bloomberg Television.  Divided Fed  Primary dealers expected the Fed to continue with its
asset-purchase program for more than a year in a survey
conducted by the  Federal Reserve  Bank of New York before the
December meeting.  The median respondent in the survey predicted that the
central bank will continue with is asset-purchase program until
the first quarter of 2014. The Fed’s 21 primary dealers trade
government securities with the central bank and are obligated to
bid in Treasury auctions.  Treasuries extended losses yesterday after Fed policy
makers said they may end their $85 billion monthly bond
purchases sometime in 2013, with members divided between a mid-
or end-of-year finish.  The central bank bought $2.3 trillion of Treasury and
mortgage-related debt from 2008 to 2011 in two rounds of
purchases, known as quantitative easing, or QE.  To contact the reporters on this story:
