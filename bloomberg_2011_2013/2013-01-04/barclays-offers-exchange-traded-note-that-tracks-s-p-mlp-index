Barclays Plc (BARC) , Britain’s second-
biggest lender by assets, is offering as much as $250 million in
exchange-traded notes tied to an index of master-limited
partnerships and limited liability companies.  The iPath S&P MLP ETN, which started trading today under
the ticker  IMLP (IMLP) , is linked to the volume-weighted average price
of the Standard & Poor’s 500 MLP Index, according to a filing
with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission yesterday. The
ETN pays a coupon based on dividends minus fees.  The bank’s charges will not be greater than the coupon,
according to the filing. MLPs are companies that pay no
corporate income tax and distribute cash to owners of limited
partnership units.  In July,  UBS AG (UBS)  started selling ETNs tied to the Alerian
MLP Index, a group of 50 publicly traded companies that rely on
assets, like pipelines, to provide returns. The Swiss bank began
trading the securities after  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  limited the
shares of its own ETN tied to the Alerian Index. The JPMorgan
note is the largest such note in the U.S. with $5.09 billion in
market capitalization, Bloomberg data show.  The S&P MLP Index returned 2.7 percent over the past year.
