President  Charles Plosser  said the last recession was a shock
that seems to have permanently reduced the potential long-term
growth of U.S. gross domestic product.  “It certainly looks like we have had a permanent shock,”
Plosser said to economists meeting in  San Diego . “The problem
is we won’t know the answer for that for many years to come.” A
permanent shock could result in a lower growth trend over time,
he said.  Fed officials project long-term growth for the U.S. economy
of 2.3 percent to 2.5 percent annually, according to forecasts
made last December. That is less than the 2.5 percent to 2.8
percent annual growth they projected two years earlier.  Plosser didn’t comment on the current economy or monetary
policy at the American Economic Association’s annual meeting.  The Fed said in December it will buy $45 billion a month of
 Treasury securities  starting in January, expanding its asset-
purchase program to $85 billion monthly, and for the first time
linked the outlook for its main  interest rate  to  unemployment 
and inflation. The central bank may end bond purchases sometime
in 2013, some policy makers said, according to minutes of the
Dec. 11-12 meeting released yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
