operated at 90.4 percent of their operable capacity last week.
Gasoline production decreased last week, averaging over 8.9
million barrels per day. Distillate fuel production decreased
last week, averaging about 4.9 million barrels per day.  U.S. crude oil imports averaged 7.1 million barrels per day last
