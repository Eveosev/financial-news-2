p.m.  New York  time, led by metals.  The UBS Bloomberg CMCI gauge of 26  prices  declined 0.8
percent to 1,569.7.  PRECIOUS METALS  Gold dropped, capping the longest run of weekly losses
since 2004, after Federal Reserve minutes showed policy makers
may end monthly purchases of  U.S. debt  sometime this year.  Minutes from the Fed’s Open Market Committee’s meeting on
Dec. 11-12 showed yesterday that members were divided between a
mid- or end-of-year conclusion to the debt purchases, known as
qualitative easing. The metal pared a decline to a four-month
low after the U.S. unemployment rate remained at 7.8 percent in
December, signaling the central bank probably won’t rush to end
its third round of stimulus efforts.  Gold futures for February delivery slid 1.5 percent to

higher output in  South America  will curb demand for U.S.

delivery dropped 1.4 percent to $13.6725 a bushel. Earlier, the

straight drop.  Orange-juice futures for March delivery increased 1.2
percent to $1.1295 a pound, the first gain since Dec. 19. This
week, the price tumbled 11 percent, the most since mid-May, as
the absence of cold weather benefited crops in  Florida , the
world’s second-biggest grower.  Arabica-coffee futures for March delivery advanced 0.6
percent to $1.4735 a pound.  LIVESTOCK  Cattle futures dropped for the first time in three days on

report showed a larger-than-forecast decline in U.S. stockpiles.  On the Nymex, gas futures for February delivery gained 2.8
percent to $3.287 per million British thermal units. Yesterday,
the price closed at $3.198, the lowest settlement since Sept.
26.  U.K. gas for same-day delivery declined as warmer-than-
normal weather pushed seasonal demand to the lowest in almost a
decade.  The price fell as much as 0.7 percent to 62.05 pence a
therm and traded at 62.25 pence at 4:25 p.m. London time.
February gas rose 0.5 percent to 66.6 pence a therm. That’s
equivalent to $10.68 per million Btu.  OIL PRODUCTS  Gasoline slid as the Fed signaled an end to bond purchases

demand.  On the Nymex, gasoline futures for February delivery fell
