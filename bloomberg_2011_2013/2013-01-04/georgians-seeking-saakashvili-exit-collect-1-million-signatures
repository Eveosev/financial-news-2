Georgian politicians and civil groups
said they’d gathered as many as 1 million signatures seeking the
resignation of President Mikheil Saakashvili.  Crowds gathered today outside the presidential palace in
the capital, Tbilisi, demanding Saakashvili step down this
month, five years after he was inaugurated for a second term.  Saakashvili is scheduled to depart in October after
constitutional changes switched presidential elections from
January, extending his final term by nine months. His party was
unexpectedly defeated by billionaire Bidzina Ivanishvili’s
opposition coalition in Oct. 1 parliamentary elections.  “Saakashvili will serve his constitutional term and won’t
resign,” Akaki Minashvili, a lawmaker from the president’s
United National Movement, told reporters today in Tbilisi. “His
term ends in October and the demands for him to resign are
totally groundless.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
