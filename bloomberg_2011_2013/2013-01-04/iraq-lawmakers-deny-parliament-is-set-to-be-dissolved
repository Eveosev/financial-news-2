Two Iraqi officials denied a
television report that the parliament will be dissolved within
48 hours, leaving Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki to govern as a
caretaker.  Al-Arabiya television cited a statement it said was issued
by the prime minister’s State of Law bloc. The report was
disputed today by Khalid al-Asadi, a lawmaker who is a senior
member of that bloc.  “It is not true,” he said in a telephone interview. “The
State of Law didn’t ask to dissolve the parliament. But when any
party asks for dissolving the parliament and dissolve the
government and call for early election, we will not stand
against it.”  Izzat al-Shahbender, a senior aide to Maliki and a
lawmaker, said that “this was one of options we discussed in
the National Iraqi Alliance, which we have raised long ago, but
we didn’t issue a statement.”  Maliki suggested an early election during an interview Dec.
