Rubber surged to an eight-month high
on the first trading day of 2013, extending last year’s 15
percent rally, as a weaker yen and increased U.S. auto sales
boosted the appeal of the commodity.  Rubber for delivery in June advanced 1.8 percent to end at
307.8 yen a kilogram ($3,503 a metric ton), the highest
settlement level since May 2 on the  Tokyo  Commodity Exchange.
Futures gained for a fifth week.  The Japanese currency weakened, poised for the longest run
of weekly losses since 1989 against the dollar, raising the
appeal of yen-based contracts and helping exporters such as
Toyota Motor Corp. expand overseas sales. U.S. deliveries of
cars and light trucks climbed 13 percent to 14.5 million, the
best annual total in half a decade, Autodata Corp. said, stoking
speculation demand will increase.  “A weaker yen and optimism about demand created a bullish
mood in the rubber market,”  Kazuhiko Saito , an analyst at
broker Fujitomi Co. in Tokyo, said today by phone.  General Motors Co. and Ford Motor Co., the two largest
automakers by U.S. sales, both issued 2013 forecasts yesterday
calling for the industry to exceed 15 million deliveries. Light-
vehicle sales will be 15.1 million units, the average estimate
of 18 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg showed.  Toyota and Honda Motor Co. notched the biggest gains among
top carmakers in the U.S. last year, recapturing much of the
market share they gave up after  Japan ’s tsunami in 2011. The yen
dropped to 87.78 per dollar amid speculation the U.S. Federal
Reserve will cut cash infusions later this year, and the Bank of
Japan will add stimulus under the policy of Prime Minister
Shinzo Abe to end deflation.  Rubber for delivery in May dropped 0.6 percent to close at
26,350  yuan  ($4,229) a ton on the Shanghai Futures Exchange.
Thai rubber free-on-board advanced for a seventh day, rising 1.2
percent to 102.10 baht ($3.35) a kilogram today, according to
the Rubber Research Institute of  Thailand .  To contact the reporter on this story:
