The  Kansas City Chiefs  fired General
Manager Scott Pioli as the National Football League team
continues to talk with former Philadelphia Eagles coach  Andy
Reid  about joining the franchise.  “After several productive conversations, we made the
difficult decision to part ways with Scott Pioli and allow him
to pursue other opportunities,” Chiefs Chairman Clark Hunt said
in a statement.  The club won 23 games and lost 41 during Pioli’s four-
year tenure, including a league-worst 2-14 record this season.  The Chiefs are near an agreement to hire Reid, ESPN
reported yesterday, citing unidentified people in the NFL
familiar with the situation.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
