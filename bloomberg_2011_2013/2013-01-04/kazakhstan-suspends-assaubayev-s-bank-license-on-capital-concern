The license of JSC Credit Altyn Bank,
owned by the Assaubayev family, was suspended for six months by
 Kazakhstan  regulators after shareholders didn’t comply with a
request to boost the lender’s equity capital.  The National Bank of Kazakhstan’s management board
suspended the license on Dec. 24, the Almaty-based central bank
financial oversight committee said in a statement on its website
today.  The Assaubayev family opened the bank in 2009 after  Polyus
Gold International Ltd (PGIL) ,  Russia ’s largest gold miner, acquired
London-traded KazakhGold Group Ltd. from them. Since 2010,
Polyus has tried to sell KazakhGold’s assets back to the
Assaubayevs to end a legal dispute with its Kazakh counterparts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
