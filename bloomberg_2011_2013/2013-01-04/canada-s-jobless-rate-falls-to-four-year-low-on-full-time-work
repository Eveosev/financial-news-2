Canada ’s  unemployment rate 
unexpectedly fell to a four-year low in December as hiring rose
for a fifth month, led by full-time jobs at private companies.  The country’s  jobless rate  fell to 7.1 percent from 7.2
percent and employment rose by 39,800,  Statistics Canada  said
today in Ottawa. None of the 23 economists surveyed by  Bloomberg
News  predicted a drop in the  unemployment rate  and the gain in
jobs was almost double the highest forecast.  The Canadian dollar erased losses after the report, which
supports Bank of Canada Governor  Mark Carney ’s view that
economic  growth  will rebound after slowing to a 0.6 percent
annualized pace in the third quarter. The central bank is
relying on consumption and business investment to lead an
expansion over the next two years, and policy makers reiterated
Dec. 4 they may raise  interest rates  while the U.S. Federal
Reserve has eased policy to reduce unemployment.  “We continue to question the sustainability of this hiring
trend in the absence of the output gains that would typically be
needed to require all that labor,” said  Avery Shenfeld , chief
economist at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce in Toronto. “If
that were being backed by corresponding gross domestic product
gains, it would hint that rate hikes would come much sooner than
the market has priced in.”  Other reports have suggested weakness in the fourth
quarter, including economic growth of 0.1 percent in October and
a December inflation rate that was the slowest in three years.  Jobless Declines  While unemployment declined from 7.5 percent over the past
year, the rate remains above the 6.1 percent recorded as the
start of the last recession in 2008.  “The economy’s lackluster performance is likely to curb
any further decline in the unemployment rate in the near term,”
said  Dawn Desjardins , assistant chief economist at Royal Bank of
Canada in Toronto. “For the fourth quarter it’s going to be
tough to get a strong growth rate” even with the hiring gain,
she said.  Full-time employment rose by 41,200 in December while part-
time positions declined by 1,400, Statistics Canada said.
Private companies added 59,400 workers and public-sector
employment increased by 3,200. Workers designated by Statistics
Canada as employees climbed by 62,500 while self-employment
decreased by 22,800 in December.  Transportation and warehouse employment rose by 21,500 in
December, and construction by 17,800, according to the report.  Dollar Rises  The Canadian dollar rose 0.2 percent to 98.58 cents per
 U.S. dollar  at 10:13 a.m. in Toronto, after falling as much as
0.5 percent. One Canadian dollar buys $1.0145. Government bond
yields rose, with the two-year benchmark rising to 1.21 percent
from 1.19 percent.  Professional, scientific technical services employment
dropped by 41,500 in December, a loss offset by gains in other
service industries such as health, education and retailing.  Bell Aliant Inc. (BA)  Chief Executive Officer Karen Sheriff said
Nov. 15 the telecommunications company has been hiring
technicians to meet demand to install new broadband home
services.  Average hourly  earnings  of permanent employees rose 2.5
percent in December from a year earlier, exceeding the prior
reading of 2.2 percent.  U.S. Jobs  Today the U.S. Labor Department said that payrolls rose by
155,000 workers last month following a revised 161,000 advance
in November, close to a Bloomberg economist survey calling for
an increase of 152,000. The unemployment rate held at 7.8
percent, matching the lowest since December 2008.  Statistics Canada also reported today that prices received
by manufacturers in November fell less than the costs for their
raw materials.  The  industrial product price index , which measures the
price of finished goods, declined 0.3 percent. The  raw-materials
price  index decreased 1.9 percent. Economists surveyed by
Bloomberg forecast the factory index would fall 0.3 percent and
the materials index would drop 1 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
