Brazil has a knack for making international headlines for all the wrong reasons these days. This time, the spotlight is on 18-year-old Rebecca Bernardo, who put her virginity up for sale via a YouTube video that has gone viral. Bernardo says she is willing to be deflowered by the highest bidder, who so far has offered $35,000,  according to CNN . Bernardo says she's desperate to pay the medical expenses of her mother, who suffered a stroke. "There comes a time when you have to make decisions to get what you want. You have to be strong," she told  CNN . Her mother, meanwhile, says she thinks the auction is an awful idea. Bernardo follows 20-year-old Catarina Migliorini, who auctioned her virginity for $780,000 to a Japanese man known as Natsu in October of last year. The auction seemed to be a career move for Migliorini. According to the  Globo website , Migliorini has signed with the Brazilian edition of Playboy magazine to do this month's cover after  posing for photos  for the December issue. Migliorini promised to donate some of the money from the auction to charity, but so far the deal hasn't been consummated. Even if Bernardo doesn't go through with it, she has already won the sympathy vote in  Brazil : This is for her ailing mother's benefit, after all. Noble intentions aside, the wages of sin can be astonishingly high. (Mayara Vilas Boas is on the staff of Bloomberg View.  Follow  her on Twitter.)
