Cerberus Capital Management LP
acquired Admiral Taverns Ltd., an operator of 1,100 U.K. pubs,
for about 200 million pounds ($320 million), according to three
people with knowledge of the deal, who asked not to be
identified because the terms are private.  Cerberus bought the pub business from Lloyds Banking Group,
according to an e-mailed statement. Lloyds has no remaining debt
or equity interest in the company, Admiral said.  Nick Oborne, a London-based spokesman for Cerberus, and Ian
Kitts, a spokesman for Lloyds in  London , declined to comment on
the terms of the deal.  Lloyds took a stake in the Hitchin, England-based company
in November 2009 as part of a financial restructuring in which
much of the company’s debt was written off. HBOS Plc, which
Lloyds acquired in January 2009, had lent Admiral about 850
million pounds.  “Admiral’s business provides an ideal platform for the
acquisition of additional tenanted pubs in the U.K.,” Lee
Millstein, senior managing director at Cerberus, said in the
statement.  The existing management team, led by executive chairman
Jonathan Paveley, will remain in place, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
