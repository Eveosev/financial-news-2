Steel reinforcement-bar futures
declined from the highest level in more than five months on
concern that the advance may curb a recovery in demand for the
construction material in  China , the biggest user.  Rebar for delivery in May fell 0.1 percent to 3,986 yuan
($640) a metric ton at the close of the morning session on the
Shanghai Futures Exchange. The most-active contract earlier
reached 4,023 yuan, the highest price since July 10, set for a
fifth weekly gain in the best run since March. The market
reopened today after a three-day closure for New Year.  Rebar surged 14 percent in December, the most since July
2009, as China’s economy headed for a rebounded in the final
three months of the year after a seven-quarter slowdown as the
government increased infrastructure spending and accelerated
investment-project approvals.  “We are telling our clients that buying now is like
jumping into chest-high water,” Ren Xinlei, an analyst at
Luzheng Futures Co., said by phone from Jinan. “Futures are
clearly overbought and we may be in a period of correction.”  The 14-day relative strength index rose to 79 on Dec. 31,
the strongest level since February 2011. A reading above 70
indicates to some analysts who study such charts that a decline
in prices may be imminent.  While the demand outlook is still positive, it will take
some time for the physical market to display the increase in
consumption suggested by the futures, Ren said.  The average spot  price  for rebar was at 3,642  yuan  on Dec.
31, according to data from Beijing Antaike Information
Development Co. Spot  iron ore  at Tianjin port rose 3.4 percent
to $149.80 a dry ton on Jan. 3, the highest level since Oct. 18,
2011, data compiled by The Steel Index Ltd. showed.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
