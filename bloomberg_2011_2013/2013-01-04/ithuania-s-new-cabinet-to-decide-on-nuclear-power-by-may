Lithuania’s new government will
decide by mid-May whether building a nuclear plant to replace
the one that closed in 2009 is the best way to reduce reliance
on Russian energy, Prime Minister Algirdas Butkevicius said.  The Cabinet, which took office last month, has until May 15
to present an energy-independence strategy to Parliament,
Butkevicius told reporters today in Vilnius, the capital.  Since closing the Soviet-built Ignalina plant in 2009,
Lithuania has had to import electricity from  Russia , which is
also its only source of natural gas. In a non-binding October
referendum, voters in the Baltic nation rejected the previous
government’s plan to hire  Japan ’s  Hitachi Ltd. (6501)  to build a 1,300-
megawatt reactor in the town of Visaginas.  “A working group has been formed to calculate the costs of
achieving energy independence both with and without a nuclear
plant,” Butkevicius said. “We should have more clarity about
the alternatives by the middle of March.”  The government remains open to further discussions with
Hitachi and other potential partners if that proves relevant, he
said. So far it hasn’t been in contact with Hitachi, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
