Palestinian supporters of Mahmoud
Abbas’s Fatah party are rallying in the  Gaza Strip  to mark the
movement’s 48-year anniversary, in the first such public
gathering approved by the ruling Hamas movement in six years.  Arriving in trucks, cars, motorbikes and on foot,
Palestinians met at an open yard in Gaza city center to attend a
rally celebrating the creation of Fatah in January 1965.  “The crowds came to tell Hamas that we are eager for
reconciliation and unity,” said Amal Hamad, a Palestinian
member of the Fatah central committee. “And to tell Netanyahu,
the Israeli premier, that the Palestinian state will be
established soon whether he accepts it or not.”  Hamas, classified as a terrorist group by the U.S., the
European Union and  Israel , seized control of the Gaza Strip in
June 2007, having won elections the previous year, ousting
forces loyal to Abbas and banning rallies in support of Fatah.  The two groups pledged to seek reconciliation in November
after the  United Nations General Assembly  voted to recognize
 Palestine  as a non-member observer state, approving a bid by
Abbas that was also endorsed by Hamas.  To contact the reporter on this story:
