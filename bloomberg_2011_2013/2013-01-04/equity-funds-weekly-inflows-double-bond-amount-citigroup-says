 Equity funds lured twice the money
that went into bonds in the week ended Jan. 2, according to a
Citigroup Inc. report that cited EPFR Global data.  Stock funds drew $5.1 billion, exceeding the $2.3 billion
that went into bonds, Markus Rosgen and Yue Hin Pong wrote in a
report today. Developed-market stock funds attracted $1.7
billion compared with $3.4 billion for emerging-market funds,
according to the report.  The flows occurred in the days leading up to the passage of
a U.S. bill that averted automatic spending cuts and tax gains
that some analysts and economists had said would drag the
world’s largest economy into a recession. The House of
Representatives voted on Jan. 1 in favor of budget legislation
as Republican lawmakers abandoned efforts to add spending cuts
to the bill.  Asia funds lured $1.2 billion, the 17th straight week of
inflows into the region, according to Citigroup’s report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
