Most  Chinese stocks  retreated on the
first trading day of the year, led by consumer shares and
health-care companies, after valuations increased to their
highest levels in 13 months.  Tasly Pharmaceutical Group Co. slumped 6.7 percent from a
14-month high. Kweichow Moutai Co., the largest maker of
spirits, slid 1 percent. A private survey showed services
industries grew at the slowest pace in 16 months in December.
Ping An Insurance (Group) Co. paced gains by insurers.  About two stocks declined for each that rose on the
Shanghai Composite Index, which added 0.4 percent to 2,276.99 at
the close. The  CSI 300 Index (SHSZ300)  advanced 0.1 percent to 2,524.41
after briefly rallying more than 20 percent from last year’s
low. The  Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  sank 1 percent after
Federal Reserve policy makers said they will probably end debt
purchases that have fueled demand for riskier assets.  “There was some profit-taking as we had gained
considerably over the past sessions,”  Li Jun , a strategist at
Central  China  Securities Co., said from Shanghai.  Companies in the CSI 300 trade at an average 12.1 times
estimated earnings, the highest  valuation  in 13 months. That
compares with a multiple of 9 for the Hang Seng China
Enterprises Index.  The CSI 300’s 14-day  relative strength index  rose to 78.12
on Dec. 31, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The RSI
measures how rapidly prices have advanced or declined during the
specified time period. Some analysts see a reading of more than
70 as a signal to sell.  Bull Market  The CSI 300 has gained 19.7 percent from its Dec. 3 low. An
advance of a 20 percent or more from a low signals a  bull market 
to some investors, while a decline of that magnitude signals a
 bear market .  The CSI 300’s last bull-market rally began in July 2010 and
lasted until November that year with the stock gauge jumping 41
percent. The index entered a bear market in August 2011 as the
government raised  interest rates  and ordered banks to set aside
more funds as deposit reserves to slow inflation.  The Hang Seng China  gauge  climbed 4.8 percent in Hong Kong
during the previous two days, while the Bloomberg China-US
Equity Index of the most-traded Chinese shares in  New York  rose
2.2 percent, amid speculation the economy is rebounding from its
seven-quarter slowdown.  A  gauge  tracking health-care companies on the CSI 300
retreated 2.3 percent, the biggest loss since Dec. 17. Tasly
Pharmaceutical declined 6.7 percent to 51.58  yuan .  Services Index  The consumer-staples index declined 0.9 percent, led by
Kweichow Moutai’s 1 percent drop to 206.94 yuan.  The services  Purchasing Managers ’ Index released by HSBC
Holdings Plc and Markit Economics today fell to 51.7 from 52.1
in November. At the same time, companies added workers at the
fastest pace in more than two years and were “optimistic”
business would improve, HSBC said in a statement.  China’s  gross domestic product  probably expanded 7.8
percent in the fourth quarter from a year earlier, from a three-
year low of 7.4 percent in the previous three months, according
to the median estimate of 34 economists surveyed by Bloomberg
last month. The GDP data is scheduled for Jan. 18.  Chinese insurers gained after surging on the  Hong Kong 
gauge since Dec. 30, when the nation’s securities regulator said
they will be allowed to set up mutual funds. Ping An jumped 4
percent to 47.11 yuan. China Pacific Insurance (Group) Co.
advanced 2 percent to 22.96 yuan.  Trading volumes in the Shanghai Composite were 55 percent
higher than the 30-day average at the close, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  The  iShares FTSE China 25 Index Fund , the largest Chinese
exchange-traded fund in the U.S., declined 0.6 percent to $41.59
in New York yesterday, after climbing 3.5 percent Jan. 2. The
 Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  fell 0.2 percent to 1,459.37.  To contact the reporter on this story:
