Government of  Singapore  Investment
Corp., manager of more than $100 billion of the city’s reserves,
named Lim Chow Kiat group chief investment officer as Ng Kok Song, who served the fund since 1986, retires.  Lim, currently Ng’s deputy, will assume his new role as of
February, GIC said in a  statement  on its website. Ng will advise
GIC as head of global investments and as a member of the fund’s
international advisory board, according to the statement.  Lim, 42, joined GIC in 1993 and became head of the fixed
income, currency and commodities department as well as deputy
president of GIC Asset Management in 2008. From 2009 until 2011
he oversaw GIC’s investments and relationships in  Europe ,  Africa 
and the  Middle East . In April last year he became deputy group
chief investment officer.  “Ng Kok Song has been a great influence in developing the
professional investment capability of GIC,” Lim said in the
statement. “My focus will be to build on that capability and
ensure that the GIC investment process remains robust.”  Ng, 64, started as an investment analyst in Singapore’s
ministry of finance in 1970. He joined GIC in 1986, five years
after the fund’s inception, and headed the equities and bond
department, according to the statement. When he assumed the
newly created role of group chief investment officer in 2007, Ng
was in charge of integrating GIC’s investment strategies in the
public and private markets.  Higher Cash  GIC said in July its cash allocation almost quadrupled to
11 percent of its portfolio in the year ended March from 3
percent a year earlier. Stock holdings fell to 45 percent from
49 percent as it pared equities in developed markets, while bond
investments dropped to 17 percent from 22 percent, it said in
its annual report.  The so-called 20-year annualized real return was 3.9
percent as of March 2012, unchanged from the previous year, it
said. The annualized nominal rate of return in U.S. dollar terms
was 3.4 percent over five years, 7.6 percent over 10 years and
6.8 percent over 20 years, it said. The fund, which doesn’t
report an annual return or disclose the actual size of its
portfolio, will release its next performance figures in July.  GIC is  ranked  the eighth-largest government investment fund
globally by the Sovereign Wealth Fund Institute, which estimates
it manages $247.5 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
