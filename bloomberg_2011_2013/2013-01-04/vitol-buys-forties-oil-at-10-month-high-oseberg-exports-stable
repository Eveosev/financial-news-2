Vitol Group bought a cargo of  North
Sea  Forties crude at the highest differential in almost 10
months. Trafigura Beheer BV sold a lot of Brent blend.  Exports of North Sea Oseberg grade in February are planned
at six cargoes of 600,000 barrels each, unchanged from this
month, a loading program obtained by Bloomberg News showed.  North Sea  Royal Dutch Shell Plc. sold Forties lot F0112 for loading
from Jan. 21 to Jan. 23 to Vitol at $1.50 a barrel more than
Dated Brent, a Bloomberg survey of traders and brokers
monitoring the Platts pricing window showed. Thatâ€™s the highest
since March 8.  The Geneva-based trader also bought Brent consignment B0104
for Jan. 21 to Jan 23 from Trafigura at a premium of $1.35 to
Dated Brent, the survey showed. The cargo was deferred by four
days from its original dates, the first postponement of the
grade from the January program.  Statoil ASA failed to find a buyer of Oseberg for loading
from Jan. 19 to Jan. 21 at $1.90 more than Dated Brent,
according to the survey.  Reported crude trading typically occurs during the Platts
window, which ends at 4:30 p.m.  London  time. Forties loading in
10 to 25 days rose to $1.42 more than Dated Brent, data compiled
by Bloomberg show. That compares with a 98 cent premium in the
previous session and is the most since March 12.  Brent for February settlement traded at $111.28 a barrel on
the ICE Futures  Europe  exchange in London at the close of the
window, compared with $112.34 in the previous session. The March
contract was at $110.05, a discount of $1.23 to February.  Three Ekofisk cargoes that were originally scheduled to
load this month will now be shipped in February, according to
two people with knowledge of the matter.  Ekofisk lots C11327 and C11330 were delayed for a second
time and will now be shipped from Feb. 2 to Feb. 4 and Feb. 5 to
Feb. 7 respectively, the people said, asking not to be
identified because the information is confidential.  Cargo C11326 has been postponed by three days and will now
be exported from Feb. 1 to Feb. 3, according to the people. The
loading program for Forties, Brent and Ekofisk will be released
on Jan. 7, they said.  Crude shipments from Dansk Undergrunds Consortium, the
producer part-owned by A.P. Moeller Maersk A/S, will drop to
four lots in February, a loading program obtained by  Bloomberg
News  showed.  Exports will total 2.4 million barrels, or 85,714 barrels a
day, compared with 96,774 barrels a day in January, according to
the shipping plans.  Mediterranean/Urals  There were no bids or offers for Russian Urals crude for a
second day, according to the Platts survey.  The Urals differential to Dated Brent in the Mediterranean
was at minus 93 cents, 2 cents narrower than yesterday,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. In northwest Europe,
the  discount  decreased to $1.29 from $1.31 in the previous
session, the data showed.  West Africa  Benchmark Nigerian Qua Iboe blend dropped 3 cents to $2.41
a barrel more than Dated Brent, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Refiners in  Asia  will boost imports of West African crude
for loading this month to the most since May as more sales to
 Taiwan  and record purchases of Angolan blends by  India  offset a
drop in Chinese imports from the region.  Asia bought 59 cargoes totaling 1.8 million barrels a day
from  Angola ,  Nigeria ,  Equatorial Guinea , Republic of Congo,
Gabon,  Ghana  and  Democratic Republic  of Congo, according to a
survey of five traders and an analysis of loading plans obtained
by Bloomberg News. That exceeds the 1.76 million imported in
December and is the most in eight months, the survey showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
