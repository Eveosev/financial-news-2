Gas and oil rigs in the U.S. dropped
for the sixth straight week to the lowest level since March 2011
as producers slowed exploration in shale formations that have
pushed domestic crude output to a 19-year high.  Oil rigs  fell by nine to 1,318 this week, data posted on
 Baker Hughes Inc. (BHI) â€™s website show. The  gas count  rose by eight to
439, the field-services company based in Houston said. Total
energy rigs declined by one to 1,762.  The U.S. oil rig count dropped in the fourth quarter, the
second quarterly decline after 13 advances, as energy producers
scaled back drilling programs on  high crude supplies  and lower
prices. The gas count has shrunk to less than a third of its
peak in August 2008 as companies turned away from dry-gas plays
to focus on more profitable gas liquids.  Crude for February delivery on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  fell 20 cents yesterday to settle at $92.92 a barrel,
down 9.8 percent from a year ago.  U.S. oil output rose  to the highest level since March 1993
last week. The surge helped the U.S. meet 83 percent of its
energy needs in the first half of the year, on track to be the
most since 1991. Stockpiles of the feedstock slipped 3 percent
to 359.9 million barrels. Supplies reached a 22-year high of
387.3 million barrels in June.  Natural gas for February delivery dropped 3.5 cents to
$3.198 per million British thermal units on the Nymex yesterday.
Futures are up 6.9 percent from a year ago.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
