Asia ’s naphtha crack spread is poised
for the biggest weekly loss in eight weeks, signaling eroding
profit for refiners making the petrochemical and gasoline
feedstock.  BP Plc (BP/)  bought fuel oil cargoes in  Singapore .  Light Distillates  The premium of Japan naphtha to London-traded Brent crude
futures dropped 98 cents to $93.41 a metric ton at 5 p.m.
Singapore time, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. This
crack spread has narrowed 19 percent so far this week, the most
since Nov. 9.  Glencore International Plc sold 25,000 tons of open-
specification naphtha for second-half March delivery to
Trafigura Beheer BV and bought a second-half April cargo from
the Amsterdam-based trader, according to a Bloomberg News survey
of traders who monitored transactions on the Platts window. The
March cargo traded at a premium of $14.25 a ton to the April
shipment.  Middle Distillates  Gasoil’s premium to Asian marker Dubai crude dropped 16
cents to $18.99 a barrel at 2:16 p.m. Singapore time, according
to data from PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a broker. The difference,
also known as the  crack spread , is poised for a second weekly
decline.  Jet fuel  was down 5 cents at a discount of 15 cents a
barrel to gasoil, from a 45-cent premium at the end of last
week, PVM said. A negative  regrade  shows it is unprofitable to
make  aviation fuel  over diesel.  Fuel Oil  BP bought two 40,000-ton cargoes of 380-centistoke high-
sulfur fuel oil from Vitol Group and Brightoil Petroleum
Holdings Ltd., according to the survey traders. The first
shipment, for Jan. 25 to Jan. 29 loading, traded from Vitol at a
premium of 25 cents a ton to benchmark quotes and the second for
Jan. 30 to Feb. 3 loading, from Brightoil, changed hands at
parity.  Fuel oil’s  discount  to Dubai crude narrowed 98 cents to
$6.43 a barrel at 2:16 p.m. Singapore time, according to PVM.
This crack spread is the narrowest since Oct. 29, indicating
reduced losses for refiners producing residual products. It has
shrunk 27 percent this week.  The premium of 180-centistoke  fuel oil  to 380-centistoke
grade was unchanged after rising to $9.25 a ton, PVM data
showed. This  viscosity spread  has widened 5.7 percent this week,
meaning bunker, or marine fuel, increased less than supplies
used in power stations.  Tenders  Formosa Petrochemical Corp. bought 100,000 to 150,000 tons
of naphtha for first-half February delivery to Mailiao,  Taiwan ,
said three traders who participate in the market, asking not to
be identified because the information is confidential.  Reliance Industries Ltd. offered to sell 35,000 tons of
paraffinic naphtha for January loading from Sikka,  India , said
two traders who asked not to be named because the information is
confidential.  Hindustan Petroleum Corp. sought to export as much as
30,000 tons of motor spirit for January loading from
Visakhapatnam, India, according to a tender document obtained by
 Bloomberg News .  To contact the reporters on this story:
