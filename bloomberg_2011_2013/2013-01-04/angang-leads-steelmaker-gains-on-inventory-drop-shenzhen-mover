Angang Steel Co. (000898)  gained the most in
two years, leading gains by Chinese steelmakers, as inventories
of the alloy fell and economic data showed rebounding growth.  The steelmaker’s shares jumped by as much as the 10 percent
daily limit in Shenzhen and were trading 9.8 percent higher at
4.26  yuan  as of 2:15 p.m. local time. Baoshan Iron & Steel Co.,
China’s largest listed steelmaker, climbed  1.2 percent  in
 Shanghai  and Wuhan Iron & Steel Co. increased  2.5 percent .
China’s benchmark Shanghai Composite Index rose 0.5 percent.  A gauge of Chinese manufacturing showed a third month of
expansion in December, the National Bureau of Statistics and the
China Federation of Logistics and Purchasing reported on Jan. 1.
That data was released as Jefferies Group Inc. said Dec. 31 that
Chinese steel inventories had declined to the lowest since the
end of 2009.  “The steel market is looking pretty good with inventories
of all steel products relatively low, enabling producers to
raise prices,” Yu Yang, analyst at Shenyin Wanguo Futures Co.,
said by phone from Shanghai. “That adds to sentiment that the
economy is expected to perform well.”  Chinese markets resumed trading today after a three-day
suspension for the New Year holiday.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
