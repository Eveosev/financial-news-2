A man and woman experience love at
first sight. Or they hate each other at first sight, then get
happily married. Or they cheat on each other and go through a
bitter divorce.  These constant plot switches, with amusing crashes of gear
along the way, make “Constellations” one of the best things on
the  London  stage right now -- and not for much longer.  This weekend is your last chance to see Nick Payne’s
romantic play starring Sally Hawkins, excellent as the space
physicist Marianne, and Rafe Spall in the part of Roland, a
bluff bee-keeper.  Ends tonight, Jan. 5, at Duke of York’s Theatre, St.
Martin’s Lane, WC2N 4BG. Information:  http://www.atgtickets.com ,
 http://www.constellationstheplay.com  or +44-844-871-7615.  L’Atelier de Joel Robuchon, a short walk from the Duke of
York’s, is one of London’s finest French restaurants. The casual
ground-floor L’Atelier is a beautiful room, as is the top-floor
bar. L’Atelier is expensive, so it’s worth checking out the pre-
theater menu, served before 6 p.m. each day. Information:

country scenes.  He was so much more than that, as a Royal Academy
exhibition demonstrates. His exquisite open-air sketches
dominate the show: “Constable, Gainsborough, Turner and the
Making of Landscape.” They foreshadow Impressionism more than
anything Turner ever did.  Don’t miss his “Leaping Horse” (1825), pride of the Royal
Academy, and proof on its own of the Romantic artist’s
considerable gift.  Through Feb. 17 at the Royal Academy, Burlington House,
Piccadilly, W1J 0BD. Information:  http://www.royalacademy.org.uk 
or +44-20-7300-8000.  Hawksmoor Air Street is an excellent new restaurant near
the Royal Academy. It’s the latest addition to a mini-chain of
venues focused on steak, only this time the specialty is fish --
sourced and prepared with the help of Mitch Tonks, one of the
U.K.’s top seafood chefs.  Information:  http://thehawksmoor.com/airstreet  or
+44-20-7406-3980.  Saturday Night  Hear one of the longest pieces of music you’ll ever come
across. “Longplayer” started on Jan. 1, 2000 and continues for
1,000 years before starting again. The original 20-minute work,
using Tibetan singing bowls and gongs, was written by musician
Jem Finer of the Pogues, and repeats are controlled by a
computer program that slightly changes it every time.  The original installation is sited inside London’s only
lighthouse. Listeners can arrive at 11 a.m. on the weekend and
stay until sundown on a winter afternoon, when the 19th-century
structure is seen at its best.  Trinity Buoy Wharf, 64 Orchard Place, E14 OJW. Information:

of gold, forged metal and titanium.  Dazzle -- the selling exhibition of jewelry, silver, and
prints -- closes Jan. 6 in the foyer of the National Theatre,
where it has been running every Christmas since 1981. There are
items for all budgets.  For more information, visit:
