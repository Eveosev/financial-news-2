Magyar Telekom Nyrt. gained for a
fifth day, the longest rally in almost 10 months, after Napi
Gazdasag reported that its T-Systems unit may win a tender for
the construction of an electronic toll system.  Shares in the Hungarian unit of  Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE)  rose
1.3 percent to 392 forint by the close in Budapest. Magyar
Telekom,  Hungary ’s former phone monopoly, last rose for five
straight days in March. The benchmark BUX stock  index  rose 0.2
percent today.  The signing of the contract was delayed after the tender
winner, Getronics, requested more time, the newspaper said. T-
Systems, which offered the second-lowest bid at 53.5 billion
forint ($240 million), may emerge as the winner, according to
the report. State-run news service MTI said last month Hungary’s
State Highway Manager delayed the signing of the contract after
T-Systems disputed the process.  “It’s looking increasingly likely that Magyar Telekom’s T-
Systems unit will be the winner in the e-toll tender,” Jozsef Miro, a Budapest-based analyst at Erste Group Bank AG, wrote in
a research report today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
