At least 45 of the largest dry-bulk
vessels were re-sold in 2012 while being built at shipyards
because delays led to cancellations or the original orderer
defaulted on the contract, RS Platou Economic Research said.  Most of the re-sales of Capesize- or Panamax-sized ships,
used to transport coal, iron ore and grains, were from Chinese
shipyards, according to the Oslo-based research unit of  Norway ’s
biggest shipbroker. The sales contributed to a doubling in the
number of such vessels sold in 2012 compared with the prior
year, RS Platou said, without providing a figure.  Values for re-sold  vessels  dropped 15 to 20 percent over
the year, with discounts partly attributed to some shipyards’
older or poorer designs, Platou said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
