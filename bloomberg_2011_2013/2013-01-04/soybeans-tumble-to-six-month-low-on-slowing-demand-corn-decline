Soybeans tumbled to the lowest since
June on speculation that improving crops in South America will
curb demand for U.S. supplies. Corn fell for the fifth straight
week, the longest slump since September 2011.  As much as 3 inches (7.6 centimeters) of rain will fall in
the next five days, maintaining favorable conditions for corn
and soybeans in most of southern and central  Brazil , World
Weather Inc. said in a report. In  Argentina , drier, warmer
weather expected in the next 10 days will firm muddy soils and
allow farmers to complete planting, the forecaster said.  “South America weather is looking very good for big
crops,” Gregg Hunt, a market analyst for Archer Financial
Services Inc. in  Chicago , said in a telephone interview. “The
world is moving away from the U.S. as the main supplier of corn
and soybeans because overseas farmers are producing more.”  Soybean futures for March delivery dropped 1.4 percent to
close at $13.6725 a bushel at 2 p.m. on the Chicago Board of
Trade, after touching $13.56, the lowest since June 19. The
price, down 3.6 percent this week, jumped 17 percent last year
when dry weather reduced output in the U.S. to a four-year low.  Corn futures for March delivery fell 1.3 percent to $6.8025
a bushel on the CBOT after touching $6.795, the lowest since
July 3. The grain dropped 2 percent for the week.  The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot Index of 24 raw materials
fell as much as 1.2 percent after Federal Reserve policy makers
said they will probably end debt purchases that have fueled
investor demand for riskier assets.  “The signal from the Fed is that the easy monetary policy
is ending and that will reduce demand for all commodities,”
said  Don Roose , the president of U.S. Commodities Inc. in West
Des Moines,  Iowa . “The bubble in commodities has burst.”  In the U.S., corn is the biggest crop, valued at $76.5
billion in 2011, followed by soybeans at $35.8 billion,
government figures show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
