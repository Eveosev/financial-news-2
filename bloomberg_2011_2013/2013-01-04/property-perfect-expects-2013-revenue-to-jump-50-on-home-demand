Property Perfect Pcl (PF) , a Thai
developer, expects revenue will jump 50 percent to about 15
billion baht ($493 million) as economic expansion and income
increases boost demand for condominium and houses.  The Bangkok-based company plans to start selling more
condominiums and town houses in the capital this year, Vice
Chairman Chainid Ngowsirimanee said by phone from Bangkok today.
The company’s revenue from sales of land and houses climbed 1
percent to 6.25 billion baht in the first nine months of 2012,
according to company statements on Nov. 12.  “It should be another record year in 2013 as demand for
residential properties in Bangkok and nearby provinces remains
very robust,” he said.  Shares of Property Perfect gained 5.5 percent to 1.15 baht
at the lunch break in Bangkok, heading for the largest increase
since Oct. 8. The stock  surged  52 percent in 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
