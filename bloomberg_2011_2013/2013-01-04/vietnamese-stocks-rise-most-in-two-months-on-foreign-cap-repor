Vietnam ’s  stocks  advanced, driving
the benchmark index to its biggest gain since Oct. 16, after a
local newspaper said the government may allow foreign investors
to buy bigger stakes in listed companies.  The  VN Index (VNINDEX)  rose 1.6 percent to 426.06, an eighth day of
gains and its highest close since Aug. 20. Joint-Stock Bank for
 Foreign Trade  of Vietnam, or Vietcombank, climbed 2.5 percent.
HAGL Joint-Stock Co. added 4 percent.  The State Securities Commission has proposed measures such
as removing the cap on overseas investment in some industries
and allowing foreigners to buy non-voting shares, Thoi Bao Kinh
Te Vietnam reported today, without saying where it got the
information. The regulator may also increase the margin
financing ratio and widen the trading band this quarter, the
newspaper said.  “Investors are optimistic about these signals to support
the markets,” said Nguyen Mai Phuong, head of research at
 Maritime Bank Securities . “While they may not be concrete yet,
the market is sensitive to such signs.”  The State Securities Commission will propose measures to
attract foreign investment and improve stock market liquidity,
Chairman Vu Bang said in a phone interview today, declining to
elaborate as detailed information is confidential.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
