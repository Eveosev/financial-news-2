Vinci SA (DG) ,  Europe ’s biggest builder,
raised its 2012 profit forecast as a new law removed uncertainty
about potential tax charges.  The company, based in the Paris suburb of Rueil-Malmaison,
now predicts net income will reach a level close to the one in
2011, it said in a statement today. Vinci in October said profit
may fall by as much as 4 percent as the French government
introduces new taxes to reduce the country’s budget deficit.  “The 2013 French finance law was enacted on Dec. 29,
removing the uncertainties regarding the tax charges applying to
2012,” the company said.  The budget of French President Francois Hollande relies on
20 billion euros ($26 billion) in additional taxes: 10 billion
euros from companies and 10 billion euros from individuals. In
addition to a millionaire tax, which was ruled unconstitutional
by  France ’s top court, Hollande has added new charges on capital
gains, an increased tax on wealth, a boost to inheritance
charges and an exit tax for entrepreneurs selling their
companies.  In the first half, Vinci’s net income fell 3.6 percent to
784 million euros as the company paid 37 million euros to cover
the introduction of a profit-sharing system and a new tax in
France.  The company said today it will reach its new target
“despite the margin pressure being felt in some sectors and
countries.” Vinci Chief Executive Officer Xavier Huillard has
warned that Europe’s sovereign debt crisis and the collapse of
municipal lender  Dexia SA (DEXB)  may undermine public works in the
region and erode traffic on the group’s French toll roads.  Vinci rose 4.4 percent in Paris trading in 2012, while the
French benchmark CAC 40 Index gained 15 percent. Today, the
stock rose 0.3 percent to 37.12 euros, valuing the company at
21.4 billion euros.  The company will report 2012 earnings on Feb. 5 after
market close.  To contact the reporter on this story:
