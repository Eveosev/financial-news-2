Australian Open champion  Victoria Azarenka  withdrew from the Brisbane International tennis
tournament with an injured big toe on her right foot, 10 days
before the start of the year’s first Grand Slam.  Azarenka pulled out prior to her semifinal meeting with
 Serena Williams  of the U.S. The 23-year-old from Belarus, ranked
No. 1 by the women’s tour, captured her first major title in
Australia last year.  “Victoria has been nursing this injury for the past 10
days and it has continued to deteriorate to a point where she is
unable to take to the court tonight,” Cameron Pearson, Brisbane
International tournament director, said in a statement. “We
wish her all the best with her recovery and we hope to see her
in Melbourne to defend her Australian Open title.”  Azarenka is the second high-ranked player to withdraw in
Brisbane, after No. 2  Maria Sharapova  pulled out with a
collarbone injury Jan. 1. Williams will meet Russia’s Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova, who beat Ukraine’s Lesia Tsurenko 4-6, 6-1, 6-2,
in tomorrow’s final.  The Australian Open, the first Grand Slam of the year,
begins Jan. 14 in Melbourne.  To contact the reporter on this story:
