South Africa completed an innings and
27-run victory over New Zealand, beating the visitors inside
three days of the first cricket Test in Cape Town.  Top-ranked South Africa took command of the match after
bowling out the Black Caps for 45 in less than 20 overs on the
opening day.  Resuming today on 169-4 after the Proteas declared on 347-8
in their reply, New Zealand’s hopes of making the hosts bat
again were dashed when Dean Brownlie fell shortly before lunch
for 109. South Africa completed the victory before tea when New
Zealand was all out for 275 in its second innings.  Brownlie added 74 in 223 balls with South African-born BJ
Watling before his attempted cut off Morne Morkel went straight
to Alviro Petersen. Once Watling fell to Vernon Philander for
42, New Zealand’s resistance was broken as it added just 23 more
runs while the Proteas secured the remaining four wickets.  South Africa ended the game when Chris Martin was run out
following a powerful throw from Dale Steyn, who claimed three
wickets.  Vernon Philander was South Africa’s best bowler, taking
seven wickets in the match including a career best 5-7 in New
Zealand’s first innings. Peterson scored 106 yesterday.  The teams are playing a two-match series, New Zealand’s
first under Brendon McCullum, who succeeded Ross Taylor as
captain.  To contact the reporter on this story:
