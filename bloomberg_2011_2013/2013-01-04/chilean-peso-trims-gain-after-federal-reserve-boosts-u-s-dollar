Chile ’s peso, the strongest emerging
market currency this year, trimmed that gain today after the
U.S. Federal Reserve said it may stop buying bonds this year.  The peso weakened 0.2 percent to 473.4 per U.S. dollar as
of 10:20 a.m. in Santiago. It closed yesterday at a six-week
high of 472.6 per dollar.  Fed officials said they will probably end their $85 billion
monthly bond-purchase program sometime this year, minutes of a
December policy meeting released yesterday showed. The comments
boosted the dollar and undercut commodities including copper,
Chile’s biggest export. Copper for March delivery fell the most
in two weeks, dropping as much as 1.2 percent to $3.671 a pound.  “The fact that the Federal Reserve is considering
withdrawing the stimulus changes market expectations,” said
Patricio Aliaga, a trader at the Santiago unit of Bank of Nova
Scotia. “We should see a floor for the dollar and with this
kind of noise going on, the dollar could appreciate against its
traditional benchmarks and recover its lost ground.”  International investors in the Chilean peso forwards market
cut their net short position to a 13-month low of $4 billion on
Jan. 2, according to data published today by the central bank.  To contact the reporter on this story:
