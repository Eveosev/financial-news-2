Eli Lilly & Co. (LLY) , facing a wave of
generic competition, forecast 2013 profit higher than analysts
estimated on expectations of increased sales of diabetes
treatments and the erectile dysfunction drug Cialis.  Earnings, excluding one-time items, may be $3.75 to $3.90 a
share, more than the $3.71 average of 18 analyst  estimates 
compiled by Bloomberg. Profit last year probably met company
forecasts of $3.30 to $3.40, the Indianapolis-based drugmaker
said today in a statement.  Lilly has been struggling to boost earnings as generic
copies take sales from its $5 billion schizophrenia treatment
Zyprexa, which lost patent protection in October 2011. Chief
Executive Officer  John Lechleiter  has said profit won’t grow
again until after 2014 as the company prepares for competition
from copycat products threatening other Lilly drugs.  “Bear in mind for the past two years, Lilly’s initial
guidance has proved conservative,” said  Mark Schoenebaum , an
analyst with ISI Group, in a note to clients.  Lilly rose 3.7 percent to $51.56 at 4 p.m. New York time.
The company has gained 27 percent in the past 12 months.  Cymbalta Protection  Lilly will face generic competition in December on its top-
selling drug, the antidepressant Cymbalta. The company, racing
to get new medicines to market, has 13 compounds in the final
stages of testing, including treatments for diabetes,
 Alzheimer’s disease , and cancer. Earnings next year depend on
how many of those get to market, Chief Financial Officer Derica
Rice said today on a conference call with analysts.  “I can’t give you any more specifics on 2014 until we see
how some of the cards play out in our pipeline,” Rice said.  For 2014, he said Lilly is positioned to exceed current
earnings expectations and will have revenue higher than $20
billion and net income of at least $3 billion.  Net income will be $4.03 to $4.18 a share this year, the
company said. Revenue for this year is expected to be $22.6
billion to $23.4 billion.  The company said its reported earnings this year will
benefit from the inclusion of a research and development tax
credit as part of the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012,
which was not completed until 2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
