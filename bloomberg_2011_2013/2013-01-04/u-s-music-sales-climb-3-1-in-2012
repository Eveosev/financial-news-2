U.S. music sales climbed 3.1 percent
in 2012, with digital-music purchases helping make up for a
plunge in demand for physical albums, according to industry
tracker Nielsen.  Purchases of albums, singles, music videos and digital
tracks rose to 1.66 billion last year, Nielsen said. Sales of
digital albums, which are offered through  Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s iTunes
and other sites, climbed 14 percent. Physical-music sales,
including compact discs, cassettes and LP records, dropped 13
percent.  Even after years of slumping CD sales, physical formats
remain the dominant way that Americans buy albums, said David Bakula, a senior vice president at Nielsen. The best-selling
record of 2012 was Adele’s “21,” the first album to get the
top ranking two years in a row, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
