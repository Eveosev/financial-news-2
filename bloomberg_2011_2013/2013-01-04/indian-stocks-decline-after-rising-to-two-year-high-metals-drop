Indian (SENSEX)  stocks dropped following a
three-day rally that took the benchmark index to a two-year high
and drove its valuation to the highest level since March.  The BSE  India  Sensitive Index, or Sensex, lost 0.2 percent
to 19,728.76 at 11:04 a.m. in Mumbai, paring its weekly gain to
1.5 percent. Volumes on the gauge, which closed yesterday at the
highest level since Jan. 6, 2011, were 3.6 percent lower than
the 30-day average for this time of the day. A measure of
material producers ended a five-day rally as industrial metals
fell after the U.S. Federal Reserve said it will probably end
its bond-purchase program sometime this year.  Tata Power Co. (TPWR) 
slid after saying its unit stopped supply to three companies.  Sensex valuations have increased as India’s government
announced policies late last year to revive economic growth and
U.S. lawmakers passed a bill averting tax gains and spending
cuts. Stocks retreated today even as a private survey showed
India’s service industries grew at a faster pace in December.  “There was bound to be some consolidation after the recent
gains,” Kaushik Dani, a  fund manager  at Peerless Mutual Fund,
which has $874 million in assets, said by phone from Mumbai.
“Indian stocks are on a firm footing and the positive trend is
likely to continue as inflows remain strong.”  The Sensex climbed 26 percent last year, as government
measures to bolster an economy growing at the slowest pace in
three years accelerated foreign inflows. The rally has driven
the Sensex’s  valuation  to 15.6 times  estimated earnings , the
highest since March, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The MSCI
 Emerging Markets  Index trades at a multiple of 10.9.  Net Buyers  Foreign funds bought a net $24.5 billion of equities last
year, the highest among 10 Asian markets tracked by Bloomberg,
excluding  China . They were net buyers of stocks on all but one
day last month, and purchased $256 million of shares on Jan. 2,
data from the market regulator show.  The MSCI India Materials Index lost 1.1 percent to 778.73,
poised for its steepest loss in two weeks.  Sterlite Industries
(India) Ltd. (STLT) , the largest copper producer, slid 2.4 percent to
119.25 rupees, the most on the Sensex. Copper fell by the most
in two weeks as industrial metals dropped after the Fed policy
makers said they will probably end their $85 billion monthly
bond-purchase program this year.  Jindal Steel & Power Ltd. dropped 2.1 percent to 456.40
rupees and aluminum maker  Hindalco Industries Ltd. (HNDL)  lost 1.9
percent to 131.90 rupees.  Tata Power retreated 1.2 percent to 108.85 rupees, heading
for its lowest close in a week. Its unit Coastal Gujarat Power
stopped supply to three state-run distribution companies in the
Rajasthan state, which defaulted on payment of dues, according
to an e-mailed statement.  HDFC Bank Ltd. (HDFCB) , the second-largest
private lender, fell 1.1 percent to 675.60 rupees, on course for
the lowest close since Nov. 26  The S&P CNX  Nifty Index (NIFTY)  on the National Stock Exchange of
India declined 0.2 percent to 5,996.25. The  BSE Mid-Cap Index (BSEMDCAP) 
added 0.2 percent in a sixth day of gains, holding at a two-year
high. India VIX, which measures the cost of protection against
losses in the Nifty, increased 0.5 percent to 13.54.  To contact the reporter on this story:
