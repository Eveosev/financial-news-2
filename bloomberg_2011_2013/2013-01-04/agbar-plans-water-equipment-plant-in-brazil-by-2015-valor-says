Sociedad General de Aguas de
Barcelona SA , a Spanish water supplier, may start producing
technology in  Brazil  that treats sewage and cuts water losses
within two years, Valor Economico SA reported, citing Jonas de
Miguel, director-general of the company’s Aqualogy unit.  The company known as Agbar currently produces the equipment
in Spain and may build a factory in Brazil should the local
market continue to expand, the Sao Paulo-based paper said today.
Barcelona-based Agbar is a  Suez Environnement Co. (SEV)  unit.  Agbar is seeking concessions with the construction company
 Mendes Junior Engenharia SA (MEND5)  to treat sewage in four cities in
Goias state, according to the report. It’s also about to close a
deal with water utility Cia. Pernambucana de Saneamento to
provide engineering services in the northeastern city of Recife.  To contact the reporter on this story:
