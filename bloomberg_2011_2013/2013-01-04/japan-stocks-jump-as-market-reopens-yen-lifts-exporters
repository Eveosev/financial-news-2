Japanese  stocks  advanced, with the
Nikkei 225 Stock Average closing at its highest since March
2011, as shares chased gains among Asian markets following a
four-day holiday and a weaker yen boosted the earnings outlook
for exporters including  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203)   Toyota jumped 6.4 percent as Japan’s currency fell to its
lowest since July 2010 against the dollar.  Fanuc Corp. (6954) , which
supplies robots used in Chinese factories, climbed 3.9 percent
after a manufacturing report earlier this week added to signs
the world’s second-largest economy is recovering. Japan Exchange
Group Inc., created by the merger of the country’s two biggest
bourses, plunged 9.7 percent in its  Tokyo  trading debut.  The Nikkei 225 climbed 2.8 percent to close at 10,688.11 in
Tokyo, gaining the most on an opening day since 2002. The
broader Topix Index climbed 3.3 percent to 888.51. Japanese
shares caught up with a rally in Asian markets this week that
came after the  U.S. Congress  passed legislation to avert more
than $600 billion in automatic tax increases and spending cuts
that might have pushed the economy into a recession.  “We’ve averted a worst-case scenario on the fiscal cliff
and the market is breathing a sigh of relief,” said Juichi Wako, senior strategist at Nomura Securities Co. in Tokyo.
“Companies have already settled their exchange rates for this
quarter, so we shouldn’t see too much upward movement in
earnings from the yen’s weakness right away. But investors
expect next quarter to look pretty good.”  The Japanese yen fell to a two-and-half year low against
the dollar, heading for a 2.1 percent decline this week and
extending losses for an eighth week, extending its longest
losing streak since 1989.  The currency dropped before Bank of Japan Deputy Governor
Kiyohiko Nishimura is due to speak in  San Diego  today amid bets
the BOJ will boost  money supply  to end deflation. The BOJ will
hold its first policy meeting this year on Jan. 21-22.  Exporters Gain  Exporters advanced. Toyota climbed 6.4 percent to 4,260
yen. Honda Motor Co. rose 4 percent to 3,270 yen.  Canon Inc. (7751) ,
the world’s biggest camera maker, gained 2.4 percent to 3,420
yen.  Companies that do business in  China  rose after a gauge of
mainland manufacturing earlier this week showed a third month of
expansion. A survey by HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics
released today showed the nation’s services industries expanded
in December.  Fanuc gained 3.9 percent to 16,540 yen.  Komatsu Ltd. (6301) , a
maker of construction machinery that gets about 14 percent of
sales from China, jumped 4.9 percent to 2,290 yen.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index lost 0.1 percent
today. The gauge slipped 0.2 percent in New York yesterday after
minutes from a Federal Reserve meeting showed policy makers said
they will probably end their $85 billion monthly bond-purchase
program sometime in 2013.  Bull Market  The Topix has risen 23 percent since the government on Nov.
14 said it would call elections, carrying the gauge into a  bull
market  on expectations the  Liberal Democratic Party , which won
last month’s poll, would call for more central bank stimulus. An
advance of 20 percent or more from a low signals a bull market
to some investors, while a decline of that magnitude signals a
 bear market .  Insurance companies advanced today on speculation the share
rally will boost the value of their assets. T&D Holdings, Inc.
increased 7.7 percent to 1,121 yen.  Dai-ichi Life Insurance Co. (8750) ,
Japan’s second-largest life insurer, climbed 6.8 percent to
128,100 yen. NKSJ Holdings Inc., the third-largest casualty
insurer, rose 6.3 percent to 1,951 yen.  The Topix is trading for 18.3 times  estimated earnings ,
compared with 13.1 times for the S&P 500 and 11.9 times for
Stoxx Europe 600 Index.  Nikkei Volatility  The Nikkei 225’s 14-day Relative Strength Index, a measure
of trading momentum, rose to 83.30 today. Some investors view a
reading above 70 as a sign the market is overbought.  The  Nikkei Stock Average Volatility Index (VNKY)  slipped 2.2
percent to 21.95, indicating traders expect a swing of about 6.3
percent on the gauge over the next 30 days. Trading volume on
the Nikkei 225 was about 31 percent above the 30-day average.  Among stocks that fell, Japan Exchange Group sank 9.4
percent to 3,895 yen on its trading debut on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange. The company was previously listed as Osaka Securities
on the Jasdaq market, where it gained 5.6 percent in the past
month.  “Investors will probably re-evaluate the stock once they
start to see the synergy from the merger,” said  Naoki Fujiwara ,
chief  fund manager  at Shinkin Asset Management Co., which
oversees about $6.3 billion. “Right now there’s not much news
to buy on, as the shares already rose a lot on Jasdaq.”  Sharp Corp. (6753)  dropped 2.6 percent to 295 yen after the
Yomiuri newspaper reported on Jan. 1 that the loss-making
television maker may raise 100 billion yen ($1.1 billion). The
company is considering ways to increase capital, spokesman
Atsushi Yoshida said, declining to give funding details.  To contact the reporter on this story:
