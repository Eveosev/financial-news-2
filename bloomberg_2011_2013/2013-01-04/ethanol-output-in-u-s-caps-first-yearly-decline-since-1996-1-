Ethanol  production  in the U.S. fell
3.2 percent to 807,000 barrels a day last week, capping the
first decline in 16 years as record corn prices crimped profits.  Output averaged 859,000 barrels a day in 2012, or 13.2
billion gallons on an annualized basis, down from 13.8 billion
in 2011, according to Bloomberg calculations based on an Energy
Department report today. Stockpiles fell to 20.2 million barrels
in the seven days ended Dec. 28 from 20.3 million.  Ethanol is made from corn in the U.S. and prices for the
grain are at a record for this time of year after a drought
scorched crops in the Midwest, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Imports increased to 87,000 barrels a day from 26,000 the
previous week, the department said. Ethanol-blended gasoline
made up about 87 percent of the total U.S. gasoline pool, down
from 89 percent in the week ended Dec. 21 and the lowest since
Jan. 6, 2012.  Denatured ethanol for January delivery fell 0.1 cent to
$2.178 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade. The futures have
fallen 2.2 percent in the past year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
