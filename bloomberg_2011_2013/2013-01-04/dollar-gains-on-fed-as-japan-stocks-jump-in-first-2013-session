U.S. stocks rose, sending the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index to a five-year high, as government
data showed employers added more workers while the jobless rate
held at a level that’s unlikely to hasten the end of Federal
Reserve stimulus. Treasuries erased early losses.  The S&P 500 added 0.5 percent to 1,466.47 at 4 p.m. in  New
York  to extend a weekly gain to 4.6 percent and send it to its
best closing level since December 2007. The Stoxx Europe 600
Index added 0.4 percent, closing at the highest since February
2011. The Dollar Index increased 0.1 percent after earlier
jumping as much as 0.6 percent. Treasury 10-year yields fell one
basis point to 1.90 percent after rising for three days and
touching the highest since April earlier. Silver and gold slid.  U.S. employers added workers in December at about the same
pace as in the prior month even as lawmakers struggled to reach
a budget deal, according to the Labor Department’s monthly
payrolls report. Fed policy makers said yesterday they will
probably end their $85 billion monthly bond purchases, known as
quantitative easing, in 2013, according to minutes of their Dec.
11-12 meeting released yesterday.  The jobs report “reinforces the view that the labor market
is healing but at a very slow pace,” Joseph Tanious, a New
York-based global market strategist for JPMorgan Funds, which
oversees $400 billion, said by telephone. “It’s a good report
that suggests the economy is healing but it’s not so good that
the Fed might pull out of QE. It’s been a shortened week but jam
packed and everybody’s still digesting everything.”  Market Movers  The  S&P 500  retreated 0.2 percent yesterday after the
release of the Fed minutes. The gauge soared 2.5 percent on Jan.
2 after Republicans and Democrats agreed on a compromise budget
that avoided the so-called fiscal cliff of sweeping tax
increases and spending cuts.  The VIX, as the Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility
Index is known, slid 5 percent today to a four-month low of
13.83. The benchmark gauge of U.S. equity options tumbled 39
percent since Dec. 28, its biggest  weekly loss  on record.  Commodity, industrial and financial companies helped lead
the market’s gain today, with Walt Disney Co., Johnson & Johnson
and JPMorgan Chase & Co. climbing at least 1.8 percent for the
biggest gains in the  Dow Jones Industrial Average .  Eli Lilly & Co. jumped 3.7 percent as the drugmaker
forecast 2013 earnings above analyst expectations. Citigroup
Inc. advanced 2.5 percent after Goldman Sachs Group Inc. added
the bank to its conviction buy list. Avon Products Inc. gained
3.2 percent after Bank of America Corp. raised its rating on the
stock.  Apple Slumps  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  slumped 2.8 percent, the most since Dec. 14.
Deutsche Bank AG said supply-chain movements suggest iPhone and
iPad production may be declining. Technology shares had the only
decline among the 10 main S&P 500 groups.  S&P 500 futures extended gains before the open of exchanges
in New York after the jobs data were released. Payrolls rose by
155,000 workers last month following a revised 161,000 advance
in November that was more than initially estimated, Labor
Department figures showed today. The median estimate of 82
economists surveyed by Bloomberg called for an increase of
152,000. The  unemployment rate  held at 7.8 percent, matching the
lowest since December 2008.  “At 7.8, that tells us we still have an unemployment
problem and the Fed will still be engaged,” Mohamed El-Erian,
chief executive officer of Pacific Investment Management Co.,
said on Bloomberg Television.  Europe Stocks  Among  European stocks ,  Fresnillo Plc (FRES) , the world’s biggest
primary silver producer, sank 4 percent in London trading as UBS
AG downgraded the shares and the precious metal retreated.
ThromboGenics NV jumped 3.3 percent after confirming the launch
date for its Jetrea vision restoration treatment. Fresnillo Plc,
the world’s biggest primary silver producer, slid 4 percent
after UBS AG downgraded the shares. Randgold Resources Ltd. lost
4 percent as the price of the metal fell.  The U.S. currency climbed as much as 1.3 percent to 88.41
yen, the strongest level since July 2010. The euro was up 0.2
percent at $1.3080 after losing 0.4 percent earlier to the
weakest level in three weeks.  The yen weakened at least 0.7 percent against all major
peers and is set for an eighth weekly drop versus the U.S.
currency, the longest run of losses since 1989, amid speculation
the government will add more monetary stimulus.  The S&P GSCI gauge of 24 commodities dropped 0.5 percent as
silver, lead, aluminum, zinc and gold lost at least 1 percent to
help lead declines. Oil capped its biggest weekly gain in three
months, increasing 17 cents to $93.09 and extending its gain
since Dec. 28 to 2.5 percent.  The MSCI  Emerging Markets  Index fell 0.4 percent, declining
for the first time in 10 days to snap the longest rally in 14
months. The gauge has climbed about 10 percent since the Fed
announced a third round of stimulus on Sept. 13. The Shanghai
Composite Index rose 0.4 percent in the first day of trading
this year, while  Brazil ’s Bovespa slipped 1.3 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
