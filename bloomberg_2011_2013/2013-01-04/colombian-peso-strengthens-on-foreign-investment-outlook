Colombia ’s peso fell, heading for its
first weekly drop since November, on speculation policy makers
will take further measures to ease the currency’s rally.  The peso weakened 0.1 percent to 1,765.2 per  U.S. dollar  at
9:48 a.m. in Bogota, and has declined 0.3 percent this week.
That’s the first weekly fall since the period ended Nov. 16.  The Colombian currency touched 1,750.50 on Jan 2, the
strongest level since July 2011. That day, central bank Governor
Jose Dario Uribe said on RCN Radio that the strong peso is a
concern and reiterated that Banco de la Republica will buy at
least $20 million a day through at least the first quarter. The
central bank printed pesos to buy a record $4.4 billion last
year.  “Uribe’s comments are leading people to guess we’ll see
more intervention,”  Camilo Perez , the head analyst at Banco de
Bogota SA, said in a phone interview. “There’s also the sense
that the rally this week was too strong and it’s not
sustainable.”  The central bank might increase daily dollar purchases or
extend them should the peso continue to rally, according to
Perez.  “Given slowing growth, the central bank is more
susceptible to intervene at these levels,” Perez said.  The economy grew 2.1 percent in the third quarter from a
year earlier, less than half the 4.9 percent rate in the prior
three months, and weaker than all 28 forecasts in a Bloomberg
survey. The median estimate was for 3.9 percent expansion.  The yield on the government’s 10 percent peso-denominated
debt due in July 2024 rose one basis point, or 0.01 percentage
point, to 5.67 percent, according to the central bank.  To contact the reporter on this story:
