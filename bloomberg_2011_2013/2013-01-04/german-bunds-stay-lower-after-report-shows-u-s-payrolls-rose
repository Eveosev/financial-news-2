German government bonds stayed lower
after a report showed U.S. employers added workers in December
at about the same pace as the prior month.  German 10-year yields rose seven basis points to 1.55
percent at 1:34 p.m. London time.  Payrolls rose by 155,000 workers last month following a
revised 161,000 advance in November that was more than initially
estimated, Labor Department figures showed today in Washington.  To contact the reporter on this story:
