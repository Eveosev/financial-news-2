Vietnam ’s three-year bonds rose,
pushing the yield to the lowest level since June, on speculation
demand from banks will increase before next month’s Lunar New
Year holiday. The dong was steady.  Credit growth may still be slow in the first few months of
2013, Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung said in his New Year’s
message posted on the government’s website Jan. 1. The central
bank lowered the interest-rate cap on dong deposits for terms of
one to 12 months to 8 percent from 9 percent in December, along
with cuts to the refinance, discount and repurchase rates. The
weeklong Lunar New Year holiday, known as Tet, starts Feb. 10.  The yield on the three-year bonds fell eight basis points
to 9.15 percent, the lowest since June 11, according to a daily
fixing rate from banks compiled by Bloomberg. The yield dropped
10 basis points, or 0.1 percentage point, this week.  “Bond yields are still attractive as they’re higher than
the deposit rate cap,” said Nguyen Duy Phong, a Ho Chi Minh
City-based analyst at Viet Capital Securities Co. “Tet is
approaching so banks won’t be lending much.”  The dong traded at 20,843 per dollar as of 4:16 p.m. in
Hanoi, the same as yesterday, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. It was little changed for the week. The  State Bank  of
Vietnam set its  reference rate  at 20,828, unchanged since Dec.
26, 2011, according to its website. The currency is allowed to
trade as much as 1 percent on either side of the rate.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
