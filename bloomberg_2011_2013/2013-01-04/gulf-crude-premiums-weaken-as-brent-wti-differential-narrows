Light Louisiana Sweet and Heavy
Louisiana Sweet oils from the U.S. Gulf of Mexico lost value on
the  spot market  as the margin between Brent crude and West Texas
Intermediate narrowed.  WTI’s discount to Brent shrank by $1 a barrel to $18.22 a
barrel, based on February settlement prices. When Brent  loses
ground to WTI , it typically weakens the value of U.S. grades
that compete with foreign oils priced versus Europe’s benchmark.  WTI’s discount to Brent has narrowed from $25.53 on Nov. 15
with the Seaway pipeline expansion almost complete.  Enterprise
Products Partners LP (EPD)  and  Enbridge Inc. (ENB) , the line’s joint owners,
plan to resume service next week and carry as much as 400,000
barrels a day from the WTI delivery point of Cushing, Oklahoma,
to the Houston area.  Light Louisiana Sweet’s premium to WTI narrowed $1 to
$17.75 a barrel at 3:59 p.m.  New York  time, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The premium for Heavy Louisiana Sweet
shrank $1.20 to $17.60.  Sour crudes from the Gulf also weakened against WTI. The
premium narrowed 75 cents to $15.50 a barrel for  Thunder Horse ,
40 cents to $13.40 for Mars Blend, 65 cents to $13.35 for
Poseidon, and 35 cents to $13.65 for Southern Green Canyon.  The strengthening of WTI against Brent also put pressure on
the price of Canadian crudes against the U.S. benchmark.
Syncrude, a synthetic light oil derived from oil-sands bitumen,
dropped 75 cents to 25 cents above WTI, according to Net Energy
Inc., a Calgary oil broker. Western Canada Select, a heavy blend
produced mainly from bitumen, slipped 35 cents to a $36.25
discount.  The discount for West Texas Sour to WTI widened $2 a barrel
to $15.50, while WTI in Midland sank $1.50 to $12 under WTI in
Cushing.  HollyFrontier Corp. (HFC)  planned heavy maintenance at its Navajo
refinery in Artesia,  New Mexico , beginning in January, company
officials said Nov. 7. The refinery processes crudes from West
Texas and Cushing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
