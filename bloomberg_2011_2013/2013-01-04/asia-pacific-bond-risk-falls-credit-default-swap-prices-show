The cost of insuring corporate and
sovereign bonds from non-payment in the Asia-Pacific region
fell, according to traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx  Japan  index dropped 10 basis points to
148 basis points as of 9:16 a.m. in  Tokyo , Citigroup Inc. prices
show. Thatâ€™s the biggest one-day decline since Sept. 7 and puts
the index on track for its lowest close since March last year,
according to data provider CMA. Markets in Japan have been
closed since Dec. 28 due to national holidays.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan decreased 2 basis points to 101.5 as of
8:19 a.m. in  Hong Kong , Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc prices
show. The measure is set for its lowest close in two years and
its first weekly decline since the five-day period ending Dec.
14, according to CMA, which is owned by McGraw-Hill Cos. and
compiles prices quoted by dealers in the private market.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index fell 2 basis points to
114 basis points as of 11:17 a.m. in Sydney, according to
Westpac Banking Corp. The index is on course for its lowest
close in 17 months, according CMA.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
