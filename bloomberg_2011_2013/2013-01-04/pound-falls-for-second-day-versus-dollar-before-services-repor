U.K. government bonds fell, pushing
10-year yields to the highest since April, amid speculation the
Bank of England will refrain from resuming asset purchases this
year and as sovereign debt dropped around the world.  Benchmark yields  headed for the biggest weekly increase
since January 2009 after the central bank said yesterday its
Funding for Lending program helped increase the availability of
mortgages and company loans. The pound weakened for a second day
against the dollar after a report showed U.K. service industries
shrank for the first time in two years. Investors demanded a
 higher yield  to hold U.K. 10-year bonds instead of their French
equivalents for the first time since April 2011.  The “credit conditions survey is relatively encouraging
for the Funding for Lending Scheme and there is a focus away
from gilt purchases,” said Simon Peck, a rates strategist at
Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc in  London . “The backdrop to
that is a risk-on tone, which has been needed for gilt yields to
push higher. Yields above 2 percent are the right level in an
environment where gilt purchases are not on the cards.”  The U.K. 10-year yield rose five basis points, or 0.05
percentage point, to 2.12 percent at 4:44 p.m. London time,
after touching 2.14 percent, the highest since April 30. The
1.75 percent bond due in September 2022 fell 0.42, or 4.20
pounds per 1,000-pound ($1,603) face amount, to 96.76. The yield
has jumped 30 basis points since Dec. 28, the most since the
week ended Jan. 23, 2009.  Higher Yield  The benchmark U.K. yield increased to as much as one basis
point higher than its French equivalent.  Gilts have underperformed French securities since Standard
& Poor’s lowered its outlook on Britain’s top credit rating to
negative on Dec. 13, citing weak economic growth and a worsening
debt profile.  “It means having to pay more for debt so that’s a
problem” for the U.K., said Neil Jones, head of European hedge
fund sales at Mizuho Corporate Bank Ltd. in London. “Gilts are
deemed a safe haven, so I would suggest to an extent this is
gilts being sold as an unwinding of the safe-haven trade.”  Treasuries and German bunds also fell today as demand for
safer assets waned. Treasury  10-year yields  increased as much as
six basis points to 1.97 percent and bund yields climbed eight
basis points to 1.56 percent.  Gilts lost 2 percent this week through yesterday, according
to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European Federation of
Financial Analysts Societies. German and French bonds both
dropped 1 percent.  Pound Weakens  The pound weakened for the first time in three days against
the euro after  Markit Economics  and the Chartered Institute of
Purchasing and Supply said their gauge of  U.K. services  declined
to 48.9 last month from 50.2 in November. A reading below 50
signals contraction.  “In all likelihood the U.K. is halfway towards a triple-
dip recession,” said Nick Parsons, head of research for U.K.
and  Europe  at National Australia Bank Ltd. in London. “We can
see sterling below $1.60 in the near term and back at 83 per
euro. We expect that fourth-quarter U.K. gross domestic product
data on Jan. 25 will be negative.”  The U.K. currency declined 0.4 percent to $1.6045 after
sliding to $1.6010, the weakest level since Dec. 7. Sterling
depreciated 0.4 percent to 81.36 pence per euro.  To contact the reporter on this story:
