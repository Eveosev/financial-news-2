Pig prices in Great Britain were the
highest in the European Union last year, followed by  Spain  and
Italy, according to German industry group Interessengemeinschaft
der Schweinehalter Deutschlands e.V.  British pig prices were about 1.79 euros a kilogram ($1.06
a pound) in 2012, compared with 1.77 euros in Spain and 1.75
euros in Italy, Damme, Germany-based ISN wrote in a  report  on
its website yesterday. The U.K. is the EU’s ninth-largest pork
producer, while Spain ranks second and Italy sixth, according to
data from the 27-country bloc.  Pig prices in  Germany , the EU’s largest producer, averaged
about 1.65 euros a kilogram in 2012, in line with prices in
France and Denmark, ISN said. German pig prices were about 19
cents higher than in 2011. German hog slaughter has resumed
after many companies shut down for the Christmas holidays, and
processing is “gaining momentum again” amid backlogged
supplies, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
