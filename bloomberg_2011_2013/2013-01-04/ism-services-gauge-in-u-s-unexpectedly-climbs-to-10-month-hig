Service industries  in the U.S.
expanded in December at the fastest pace in 10 months, helping
spur the world’s largest economy at the end of 2012.  The  Institute for Supply Management ’s  non-manufacturing 
index climbed to 56.1 last month from 54.7 in November, the
Tempe, Arizona-based group said today. Economists projected the
gauge would drop to 54.1, according to the median estimate in a
Bloomberg survey. Readings above 50 signal expansion.  A brighter  holiday shopping season  for retailers and an
improvement in the housing market helped propel the industries
that make up almost 90 percent of the  U.S. economy . Faster
services growth may depend on how quickly more Americans can
find the jobs needed to boost  incomes  and spur spending, helping
assuage higher taxes this year.  “The economy is going to do better in 2013,” said  Brian Jones , a senior U.S. economist at  Societe Generale  in  New York ,
whose ISM forecast of 56 was the highest in the Bloomberg
survey. “The service sector seems to be fine. Housing is going
to continue to help. The labor market continues to improve.”  Stocks maintained gains after the figures, with the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index poised for its biggest weekly rally
in 13 months. The  S&P 500  climbed 0.1 percent to 1,461.33 at
10:38 a.m. in New York.  Estimates in the Bloomberg survey of 66 economists ranged
from 52 to 56. The index, which includes industries ranging from
utilities and retailing to health care, housing and finance, has
averaged 53.6 since the recession ended in June 2009.  Construction, Retailing  Thirteen non-manufacturing industries, including
construction, retailers and finance, reported growth in
December, while five said business contracted.  Another report today showed employers added workers in
December at about the same pace as the prior month, while the
 unemployment rate  matched a four-year low. Payrolls climbed by
155,000 workers last month after a revised 161,000 advance that
was more than initially estimated, according to the Labor
Department.  The jobless rate held at 7.8 percent after the November
figure was revised up from a previously reported 7.7 percent.  The ISM’s  employment  gauge rose to 56.3, the highest since
March, from 50.3 in the prior month, today’s report showed. The
measure of new orders increased to 59.3, the highest since
February, from 58.1. The gauge of business activity fell to 60.3
from 61.2.  Factory Gauge  The ISM’s manufacturing index, released Jan. 2, showed the
industry grew last month, one indication the economic expansion
will be sustained in 2013. The factory gauge climbed to 50.7
from a three year-low of 49.5 in November as orders, employment
and exports grew.  While the factory sector had stumbled in prior months as
concerns over higher taxes and government budget cuts caused
businesses to reduce investment, the services industry continued
to grow.  Consumer spending  and rising housing activity helped
keep the economy expanding during that period.  Macy’s Inc. (M)  and  Gap Inc. (GPS)  yesterday reported December same-
store sales that topped analysts’ estimates. Demand at Macy’s,
the second-biggest U.S. department-store company, rose 4.1
percent, from a year earlier exceeding the average projection of
3.7 percent from analysts surveyed by researcher Retail Metrics
Inc. Gap, the largest U.S. specialty-apparel retailer, posted a
5 percent gain, topping the 3.6 percent estimate.  Housing Strength  Meanwhile, residential real estate gained momentum going
into the end of 2012. Existing-home sales reached a three-year
high in November. New-home sales advanced 4.4 percent to a
377,000 annual pace last month, the highest level since April
2010, the Commerce Department reported last month. Homebuilding
outlays  increased  0.4 percent last month to a $295.3 billion
annual rate, the most since November 2008.  At the same time, higher taxes on households may suppress
spending. Following the congressional budget deal earlier this
week, workers will see payroll taxes rise by two percentage
points, while the wealthiest Americans will also pay higher
income taxes. Together, those measures are projected to reduce
growth in the first quarter to 1 percent, from 3.1 percent in
2012’s third quarter, the latest data available, according to
economists at JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Bank of America Corp.  To contact the reporter on this story:
