The trading card that the National
Baseball Hall of Fame calls the sport’s “most famous
collectible” will be up for sale next month and might fetch
more than $2.8 million, according to the auction house.  The 1909 card of Pittsburgh Pirates shortstop Honus Wagner
will be included in the February 2013 auction at  Goldin
Auctions , according to a release on the company’s website. The
card is graded Excellent 5 by Professional Sports Authenticator,
and could eclipse the record $2.8 million sale price that a
version of the same card attracted in 2007, the release said.  “With less than 60 authenticated Wagner cards out there,
the opportunity to purchase one does not come around very
often,” Ken Goldin, founder of Goldin Auctions in West Berlin,
 New Jersey , said in the statement. “The fact that this Wagner
carries a grade of EX 5 by PSA puts it in a class with just two
others that have ever been graded.”  Pre-approved bidders will be allowed to place offers
online. The exact dates of the auction are not yet set, and the
seller was not identified in the release.  A version of the same Wagner card with a lesser grade sold
for $1.23 million last April to an unidentified man in New
Jersey, and  Arizona  Diamondbacks owner Ken Kendrick purchased
another version for $2.8 million in 2007, making that the most
expensive baseball card ever sold.  The card that will be auctioned next month is known as the
“Jumbo Wagner” because its dimensions are larger than most
other T206 Wagner cards, the release said. This card sold for
$1.62 million in 2008, according to Goldin Auctions.  528 Cards  The Wagner card was part of Goodwin & Co.’s “Masterpieces
and Uncommon Commons XL,” an auction of 528 baseball cards from
the T206 series released in 1909 by the American Tobacco Co. for
distribution in cigarette packs.  Wagner batted .329 in 21 seasons, winning eight National
League batting titles and five stolen base crowns. The second
player behind Cap Anson to reach 3,000 hits, Wagner was part of
the inaugural 1936 class at the Cooperstown, New York-based
 National Baseball Hall of Fame , and died in 1955.  The Hall of Fame has a T206 Honus Wagner available for
public viewing in its museum. A plaque beneath the card reads,
“Wagner’s fame, the scarcity of the card and the story behind
it make this baseball’s most famous collectible.”  -- Editors: Michael Sillup, Jay Beberman  To contact the reporter on this story:
