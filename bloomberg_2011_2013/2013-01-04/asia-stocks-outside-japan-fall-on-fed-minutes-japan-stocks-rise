Asian  stocks  outside Japan fell,
paring the biggest weekly advance in more than a month, after
Federal Reserve policy makers said they will probably end their
$85 billion monthly bond-purchase program sometime this year.
Japanese equities jumped as markets reopened from holidays.  Rio Tinto  Group, the world’s second-largest mining company,
dropped 1 percent in Sydney as metals prices fell. Toyota Motor
Corp. surged 6.4 percent as the yen weakened to the lowest level
against the dollar since July 2010, boosting the earnings
outlook for exporters. Japan Exchange Group Inc. fell 9.7
percent in its  Tokyo  trading debut after the merger between
Osaka Securities Exchange Co. and Tokyo Stock Exchange Group.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Excluding Japan Index (MXAPJ)  declined 0.6
percent to 475.68 as of 6:21 p.m. in Tokyo, trimming the week’s
advance to 2 percent. Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  gained
2.8 percent, gaining the most on an opening day since 2002,
after U.S. lawmakers passed a bill averting spending cuts and
tax increases scheduled to come into effect this year.  “This has been more of a relief rally than anything
else,” said James Lindsay, Auckland-based equity fund manager
at Tyndall Investment Management Ltd., which oversees about $23
billion. “The hard yards are still to come. U.S. economic data
remains pretty mixed.”  Fed Minutes  Four years after cutting the main  interest rate  to near
zero, U.S. policy makers have been expanding their third round
of so-called quantitative easing to boost economic growth and
cut the jobless rate, now at 7.7 percent.  Minutes, released yesterday in  Washington , show a divide
among Federal Open Market Committee participants on how long
bond purchases should last. Participants who provided estimates
were “approximately evenly divided” between those who said it
would be appropriate to end the purchases around mid-2013 and
those who said they should continue beyond that date.  Japanese exporters soared, pushing the Nikkei 225 to its
highest close since March 2011. Toyota Motor gained 6.4 percent
to 4,260 yen and Nissan Motor Co. climbed 5.3 percent to 854
yen. Canon Inc., the world’s biggest camera maker, rose 2.4
percent to 3,420 yen.  Japanese equities began 2013 trading today following a
four-day holiday. The Nikkei 225 rose 23 percent last year,
accelerating from Nov. 14 when the government said it would call
elections in December. The pro-stimulus  Liberal Democratic Party 
won the general election, pledging to do more to fight deflation
and spur the economy. The yen’s weakness has bolstered the
nation’s exporters amid speculation new Prime Minister Shinzo
Abe will push the central bank to buy more bonds.  Global Gain  “There is a very large fiscal stimulus program in the
works, there’s a very large monetary stimulus program in the
works and we’ve had a big move in the yen,”  Nicholas Smith , a
strategist at CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets Ltd. in Tokyo, said in a
Bloomberg Television interview with  Susan Li . “Companies are
lean and mean and are going to have a pretty impressive profit
recovery.”  Japan Exchange, created by the merger of Japan’s two
biggest bourses, fell 9.7 percent to 3,885 yen in its first day
of trading on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. The tie-up is part of a
government policy to reinvigorate the country’s financial
markets.  Sharp Corp. dropped 2.6 percent to 295 yen after the
Yomiuri newspaper reported the loss-making television maker may
raise 100 billion yen ($1.1 billion).  Global equities have climbed in 2013 as U.S. lawmakers
passed a bill averting spending cuts and tax increases scheduled
to come into effect this year. The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX) 
yesterday rose within one point of its highest closing level in
five years before retreating. Futures on the  S&P 500  added 0.1
percent today.  Miners Drop  Raw-material shares posted the largest declines among 10
industry groups on the  Asia  excluding Japan equities gauge. Rio

both slid 0.4 percent.  Hong Kong ’s Hang Seng Index lost 0.3
percent. China’s  Shanghai Composite (SHCOMP)  gained 0.4 percent as the
market reopened for 2013 trading.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index, which includes Japan, surged
14 percent in 2012 as central banks from the U.S.,  Europe , Japan
and China took action to spur economic growth. The Asia Pacific
gauge traded at 14.1 times average estimated earnings, compared
with 13.1 for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and 11.9 times for
the Stoxx Europe 600 Index, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
