Steel reinforcement-bar futures
climbed to a five-month high after a gauge of demand in  China 
rose in December and on speculation that traders are boosting
stockpiles before construction activity picks up in spring.  Rebar for delivery in May gained 0.1 percent to end at
3,990  yuan  ($640) a metric ton on the Shanghai Futures Exchange,
the highest closing price for the most active contract since
July 10. The price earlier rose as much as 0.9 percent to 4,023
yuan. Futures advanced 1.9 percent for a fifth weekly gain, the
best run since March. The market reopened today after a three-
day closure for New Year holidays.  China’s steel industry purchasing manager’s index climbed
to 55.5 last month from 49.2 in November, data compiled by the
National Bureau of Statistics, China Federation of Logistics and
Purchasing and Xiben New Line showed. Some large traders have
begun stockpiling products, Luzheng Futures Co. said in a report
dated Dec. 31. China is the world’s biggest consumer of steel.  “China’s economic growth is looking certain to be picking
up and that reinforces the sentiment that demand will rebound,”
Ren Xinlei, an analyst at Luzheng Futures, said by phone from
Jinan. The winter-stockpiling also supports that view, he said.  Rebar surged 14 percent in December, the most since July
2009, as  China’s economy  headed for a rebound in the final three
months of the year after a seven-quarter slowdown as the
government increased infrastructure spending and accelerated
investment-project approvals.  The average spot  price  for rebar advanced 0.9 percent to
3,676 yuan a ton, the highest since Nov. 22, according to data
from Beijing Antaike Information Development Co. Spot  iron ore 
at Tianjin port jumped 3.4 percent to $149.80 a dry ton on Jan.
3, the highest Oct. 18, 2011, data compiled by The Steel Index
Ltd. showed.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
