Taiwan dollar  forwards weakened the
most in five weeks on concern the  Federal Reserve  will scale
back fund infusions that have fueled demand for riskier assets.
 Government bonds  declined.  Fed policy makers said they will probably end their $85
billion monthly debt purchases sometime in 2013, with members
divided between a mid- or end-of-year finish, according to the
minutes of the  Federal Open Market Committee ’s Dec. 11-12
meeting released yesterday. The bond-buying programs in the
U.S., Europe and  Japan  prompted overseas investors to boost
their holdings of Taiwan’s stocks by $4.9 billion in 2012,
contributing to a 4 percent appreciation of the local dollar.  “Stopping bond buying will hurt investor confidence in the
market,” said Samson Tu, a Taipei-based  fund manager  at Uni-
President Assets Management Corp., which oversees $700 million.
“Investors doubt whether the U.S. recovery is strong enough to
warrant an end to quantitative easing.”  One-month non-deliverable forwards fell 0.2 percent to
NT$29.003 per dollar as of 4:21 p.m. in Taipei, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s the biggest gain since Nov.
28. The contracts fell 0.3 percent this week and are at a 0.4
percent premium to the spot rate, which slipped 0.1 percent to
NT$29.125, based on Taipei Forex Inc. prices. Local financial
markets were closed on Dec. 31 and Jan. 1 for public holidays.  The monetary authority has bought the greenback to counter
gains in the island’s currency on most days in the past nine
months, according to traders who asked not to be identified. The
central bank’s mandate is to keep relative exchange-rate
stability and to intervene in the event of abnormal moves,
Governor Perng Fai-Nan said Dec. 19.  Implied Volatility  One-month implied volatility in the Taiwan dollar, a gauge
of expected moves in exchange rates used to price options, fell
five basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 3.15 percent.  The yield on the 1.125 percent notes due September 2022
rose one basis point to 1.168 percent and was little changed
this week, according to Gretai Securities Market. The  overnight
interbank lending  rate was steady at 0.387 percent today, from
0.413 percent on Dec. 28, a weighted average compiled by the
Taiwan Interbank Money Center shows.  To contact the reporter on this story:
