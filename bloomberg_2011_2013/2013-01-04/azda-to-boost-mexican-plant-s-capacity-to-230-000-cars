Mazda Motor Corp. (7261) , a Japanese
carmaker forecasting a return to profit, said capacity at the
plant it’s building in  Mexico  that will also make cars for
 Toyota Motor Corp. (7203)  will be 21 percent larger than planned.  The Salamanca, Mexico, factory that is to make Mazda2 and
Mazda3 small cars when it opens in 2014 will have capacity to
produce 230,000 vehicles a year by March 2016, the company said
today in a statement. Mazda in November said the plant would be
able to build 190,000 cars annually, including 50,000 small cars
it’s contracted to make for Toyota.  “This production capacity increase is an important part of
Mazda’s drive to strengthen its overseas production base as laid
out in our medium- to long-term plan,” Chief Executive Officer
Takashi Yamanouchi said in prepared remarks for a New Year’s
event in Hiroshima,  Japan .  Mazda’s move into Mexico follows similar announcements by
Japan’s  Honda Motor Co. (7267)  and  Nissan Motor Co. (7201) , which are all
seeking lower-cost production facilities to make small cars for
 North America . Unlike Toyota, Honda and Nissan, Mazda imports
all its vehicles sold in the U.S. from Japan, after ending
production of Mazda6 sedans in  Michigan .  The Hiroshima-based carmaker forecasts net income of 10
billion yen ($114 million) for the year ending March, after
losing about 100 billion yen in the previous 12 months for a
third annual loss in four years.  Mazda rose 6.3 percent to 185 yen as of the close in Tokyo
trading, the highest since Aug. 10, 2011.  Yamanouchi said in an interview at the  Los Angeles  Auto
Show in November that the company intended to enlarge the Mazda
Motor Manufacturing de Mexico SA plant beyond the initial
capacity figure, without elaborating. Mexico has both lower
production costs and free-trade agreements with 37 nations that
make it  an appealing export base, Yamanouchi said.  Investment in the plant, a joint venture with  Sumitomo
Corp. (8053) , totals about $650 million including the expansion, the
company said. That’s up from $500 million when it announced the
plan in June 2011. It will employ about 4,500 people by 2016,
Mazda said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
