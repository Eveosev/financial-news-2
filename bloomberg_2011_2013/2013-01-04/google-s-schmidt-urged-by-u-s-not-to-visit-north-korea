Former New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson said he’ll travel to North Korea this week on a
private visit with a delegation including  Google Inc. (GOOG)  Executive
Chairman  Eric Schmidt .  Richardson described the visit as a “humanitarian
mission,” according to an e-mailed statement from his office
late yesterday. He said he’ll give a press conference at Beijing
airport in China on Jan. 10 as no media representatives will be
on the trip to North Korea. His statement didn’t reveal the date
of the visit.  The U.S. State Department said last week the timing of a
visit is wrong in light of North Korea’s Dec. 12 launch of a
long-range rocket that deployed a satellite into space. The
 United Nations Security Council  condemned the launch as a
violation of its prohibition on ballistic missile tests
conducted by North Korea.  “We’re not representing the State Department, so they
shouldn’t be that nervous,”  Richardson said  on “CBS This
Morning” on Jan. 4, responding to criticism by State Department
spokeswoman  Victoria Nuland .  Richardson said Schmidt is going as a citizen interested in
foreign affairs. “This is not a Google trip,” he said.  Google, based in  Mountain View , California, doesn’t comment
on personal trips by company executives, Google Korea
spokeswoman Lois Kim said when contacted by telephone Jan. 3.  Richardson, a former U.S. ambassador to the UN who has
often engaged in unofficial diplomatic missions in the past,
said he has been dealing with North Korea for 15 years. He said
he and Schmidt were going there in part to seek the release of a
detained American citizen.  To contact the reporter on this story:
