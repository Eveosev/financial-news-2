Primary dealers expected the  Federal
Reserve  to continue with its asset-purchase program for more
than a year in a survey conducted by the central bank before its
Dec. 11-12 meeting.  The median respondent in the survey by the Federal Reserve
Bank of New York predicted that the central bank will continue
with is asset-purchase program until the first quarter of 2014.  The results showed dealers may have been expecting the
central bank’s third round of asset purchases to last longer
than Fed officials anticipate.  “Several” members of the  Federal Open Market Committee 
said it would “probably be appropriate to slow or stop
purchases well before the end of 2013,” according to minutes of
the meeting released yesterday. A “few” others were willing to
let the program run to the end of the year while “a few
others” didn’t give a time frame.  Dealers projected the Fed raising its benchmark  interest
rate  in the third quarter of 2015, the same median response as
in the surveys before the central bank’s September and October
policy meetings, the results showed.  The Fed’s 21 primary dealers trade  government securities 
with the central bank and are obligated to bid in Treasury
auctions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
