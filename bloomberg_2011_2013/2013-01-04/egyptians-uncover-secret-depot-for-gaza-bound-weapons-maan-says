Egyptian authorities discovered a
secret depot outside the town of Arish today used to store
weapons destined for Gaza, and confiscated six U.S.-made
rockets, the Palestinian  Maan  website said, citing unidentified
security officials.  It said Egyptâ€™s  Interior Ministry  acted after receiving
tips that smugglers in Sinai were planning to carry a shipment
of rockets to Gaza through tunnels.  To contact the reporter on this story:
