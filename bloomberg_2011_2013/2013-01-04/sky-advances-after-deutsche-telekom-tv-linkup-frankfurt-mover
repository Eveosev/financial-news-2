Sky Deutschland AG (SKYD) , the pay-TV
operator partly owned by  News Corp. (NWSA) , jumped to the highest level
in more than three years in  Frankfurt  after agreeing to sell
subscriptions to  Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE) ’s television customers.  Sky rose as much as 2.2 percent to 4.45 euros, the highest
intraday price since September 2009 and the biggest advance
today in Germany’s  DAX Mid-Cap Index. (MDAX)  Starting in summer 2013,
Sky programs including Germany’s Bundesliga soccer matches and
UEFA Champions League games, as well as Sky Welt and Sky Film,
will be available to Bonn-based Deutsche Telekom’s Entertain
IPTV clients, the companies said in a statement today.  In April, Sky signed a four-year agreement, paying 485.7
million euros ($633 million) annually, to strengthen its hold on
broadcast rights for Bundesliga soccer matches, edging Deutsche
Telekom out of its license for Internet-based broadcasts.
Today’s agreement allows Sky, with more than 3 million customers
in  Germany  and Austria, to access the former phone monopoly’s TV
client base. Financial details weren’t disclosed.  Sky shares almost tripled in 2012, making them the best
performer in the 27-company Bloomberg Europe 500 Media Index.
They traded 1.2 percent higher at 4.41 euros as of 9:43 a.m. in
Frankfurt. Deutsche Telekom added 0.3 percent to 8.78 euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
