Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena SpA 
rose the most in almost four months, leading gains on Italy’s
benchmark FTSE MIB Index, after Italian government bonds fell.  Italy’s third-largest bank rose as much as 9.8 percent, the
biggest gain since Sept. 10, and was up 6.3 percent at 24.98
cents as of 11:54 a.m. in Milan. That gives the Siena, Italy-
based bank a market value of 2.9 billion euros ($3.8 billion).
The FTSE fell 0.4 percent.  Monte Paschi held about 22 billion euros of Italian
sovereign debt at the end of September, more than three times
its tangible capital. Chief Executive Officer Fabrizio Viola has
said the bank will be able to break even on its Italian bonds on
a spread between 150 basis points to 200 basis points.  Italian 10-year  government bonds  fell, pushing the yield on
securities up three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to
4.26 percent. The Italy-Germany 10-year yield spread has
narrowed to 274 basis points, the lowest level since August
2011, from 502 basis points a year earlier.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
