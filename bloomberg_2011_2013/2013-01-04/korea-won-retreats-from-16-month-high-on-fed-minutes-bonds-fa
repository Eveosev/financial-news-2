South  Korea ’s won retreated from a
16-month high after the Federal Reserve indicated it may end
monetary stimulus that boosts the supply of dollars in 2013.
Government bonds declined after the Bank of Korea signaled it
will not be adding to last year’s two interest-rate cuts.  Fed policy makers said they will probably end their $85
billion monthly bond purchases sometime in 2013, with members
divided between a mid- or end-of-year finish, according to
minutes of last month’s meeting that were released yesterday in
 Washington . Bank of Korea Governor Kim Choong Soo said yesterday
the central bank will seek other ways to spur economic growth
than using monetary policy.  The won fell 0.2 percent to close at 1,063.68 per dollar at
3 p.m. in  Seoul , according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It
touched 1,061.64 yesterday, the strongest level since Sept. 2,
2011 and gained 0.6 percent this week.  “A possible end to the Fed’s monetary stimulus is damping
sentiment,” said Yoo Hyen Jo, analyst at Shinhan Investment
Corp. in Seoul. “Additionally, there are concerns in the local
market that authorities may try to stem the won’s
appreciation.”  Finance Minister Bahk Jae Wan said this week he is
concerned about herd behavior in the foreign-exchange market and
the government is actively considering measures to curb
volatility in the won, which was Asia’s best-performing currency
of 2012 with an 8.3 percent advance versus the dollar. The
nation’s foreign-exchange reserves rose $880 million in December
to $326.97 billion, the smallest increase since a drop in May,
data from the central bank showed today.  Rate Outlook  The yield on South Korea’s 2.75 percent bonds due 2017 fell
two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 2.89 percent,
according to Korea Exchange prices. The central bank is probably
“done with rate cuts,” Credit Agricole CIB said in a research
note today, after the finance ministry said yesterday it plans
to spend 45.1 percent of this year’s budget in the first quarter
to support the economy.  Policy makers at the Bank of Korea next meet on Jan. 11 to
review borrowing costs. The central bank kept the benchmark
 seven-day repurchase rate  at 2.75 percent last month, after cuts
of 25 basis points at reviews in July and October.  To contact the reporter on this story:
