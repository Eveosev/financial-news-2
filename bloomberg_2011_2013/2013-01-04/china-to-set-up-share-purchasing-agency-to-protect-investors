China plans to set up an agency to
buy shares on the stock market, allowing regulators to exercise
the rights of shareholders as they seek to protect the retail
investors who hold most of the country’s freely traded shares.  The new body would give the China Securities Regulatory
Commission rights including bringing civil suits against
companies, the CSRC said in an  article  posted on its website
Jan. 2. The plan is part of an effort to build a “relief
mechanism” for investors, according to the article, which
comprised a set of answers to investors’ questions.  Institutional investors account for about 14 percent of
China’s stock market, compared with 50 percent to 60 percent in
developed markets, the regulator said. CSRC Chairman Guo Shuqing
has sped up approvals for foreign investors to buy yuan-
denominated securities, seeking to bolster institutional
participation in the stock market.  Guo has also focused on beefing up investor protection and
combating fraud since taking office more than a year ago. The
CSRC last month asked initial public offering advisers to
inspect their clients’ financial statements by the end of March.
The regulator will randomly examine the advisers’ “self-
inspection” reports and take action against issuers and
advisers if misconduct such as earnings manipulation is found,
the CSRC said.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
