Gasoline declined in  Europe  as Total
SA sold three of the four lots traded in the barge market.  Gasoil for January delivery dropped to the lowest in more
than two weeks on London’s ICE Futures Europe exchange as  Brent
crude  tumbled. The contract’s discount, or contango, to February
widened for a third day.  Light Products  Gasoline  barges  traded from $969 to $978 a metric ton in
the Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp area, according to a survey of
traders and brokers monitoring the Argus bulletin board. That’s
down from yesterday’s trades at $978 to $980, the top end of the
range was the highest price since Nov. 19, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  BP Plc and Cargill Inc. bought the Eurobob grade, to which
ethanol is added to make finished fuel. For the second day,
Total and Chevron Corp. sold the barges, which typically
comprise 1,000 to 2,000 tons.  Gasoline’s crack , or premium to Brent, shrank to $6.40 a
barrel as of 10:18 a.m. local time, according to data from PVM
Oil Associates Ltd., a broker in London. It was at $6.86
yesterday, the biggest spread in more than 11 weeks.  Tighter gasoline specifications in  Russia , which were
introduced Jan. 1, may cut supplies of the product, according to
JBC Energy GmbH, a researcher in Vienna.  “Russian output of on-specification gasoline is set to
decline, potentially bringing sporadic motor fuel shortages due
to tight gasoline balances in Russia,” JBC said in a note.  Naphtha’s crack , or discount to Brent, widened for a sixth
session to $6.27 a barrel, PVM data showed. That’s the biggest
loss since Nov. 26 and compares with $5.99 yesterday.  Middle Distillates  January gasoil declined $12.50, or 1.3 percent, to $923.25
a ton as of 12:22 p.m. on the ICE exchange. It earlier dropped
to $920.25, the lowest intraday level since Dec. 18.  The contract’s contango to February futures widened to
$2.25 a ton from $1.50 yesterday.  Gasoil’s crack  rose to $13.52 a barrel versus $13.41 at
4:30 p.m. the previous session. Brent fell 1.3 percent to
