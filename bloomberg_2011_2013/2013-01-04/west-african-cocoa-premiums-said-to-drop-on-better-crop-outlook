Buyers of cocoa from  Ivory Coast  and
 Ghana , the top producers, are paying a smaller premium for beans
as the crop outlook improved and demand is still weak, according
to three traders with direct knowledge of the sales.  Beans from Ivory Coast in the European market cost 35
pounds ($56) to 40 pounds a metric ton more than futures on NYSE
Liffe in London, said the traders, who asked not to be
identified because they’re not authorized to speak to the media.
That’s down from 40 pounds to 55 pounds at the end of October.
Harvesting usually starts that month.  Cocoa from Ghana is 75 pounds to 85 pounds above the
exchange price, the traders said. That compares with 85 pounds
to 90 pounds over the same period. Cocoa climbed 4 percent in
 London  last year on speculation harvests would decline.  Cocoa supplies will about match demand in the current
marketing year for 2012-13 that ends Sept. 30, Cargill Inc.
estimated in November. Production was 90,000 tons higher than
consumption in the 2011-12 season because of weaker demand, the
 International Cocoa Organization  in London said in a statement
on Nov. 30.  Cocoa for March delivery rose 0.3 percent yesterday to
1,433 pounds ($2,304) a ton on NYSE Liffe.  To contact the reporter on this story:
