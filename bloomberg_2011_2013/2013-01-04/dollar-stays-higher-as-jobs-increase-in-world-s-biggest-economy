The dollar fell from a three-week
high versus the euro after data showed the U.S. unemployment
rate was higher than forecast in December, fueling bets the
 Federal Reserve  won’t hurry to end its stimulus efforts.  The euro rose earlier after minutes of the Fed’s last
meeting showed yesterday the central bank might end its third
round of monthly bond purchases under quantitative easing this
year. The greenback climbed to the highest level against the yen
since July 2010 as the Japanese currency had its longest weekly
losing streak in almost 24 years.  Brazil ’s real and  Mexico ’s
peso gained versus their major peers as risk appetite rose.  “I looked at the unemployment report, and I didn’t see any
improvement,”  Joseph Trevisani , chief market strategist at
WorldWideMarkets Ltd. in  Woodcliff Lake ,  New Jersey , said in a
telephone interview. “Nobody one thinks their policy is going
to end any time soon.”  The U.S. currency declined 0.2 percent to $1.3069 per euro
at 5 p.m.  New York  time. It appreciated earlier to $1.2998, the
strongest level since Dec. 12. The dollar strengthened 1.1
percent on the week. The U.S. currency gained 1 percent to 88.15
yen and touched 88.41, a 29-month high. The yen slid 1.2 percent
to 115.21 per euro.  Reversed Bets  Futures traders reversed wagers that the euro will decline
against the  U.S. dollar , betting on a gain by the 17-nation
currency for the first time since August 2011, figures from the
Washington-based Commodity Futures Trading Commission show.  The difference in the number of wagers by  hedge funds  and
other large speculators on an advance in the euro compared with
those on a drop -- so-called  net longs  -- was 5,126 on Jan. 1 ,
compared with net shorts of 2,549 a week earlier.  The U.S.  unemployment rate  was 7.8 percent after the
November figure was revised to that level from a previously
reported 7.7 percent. The median forecast for December of
economists in a Bloomberg News survey was for 7.7 percent.  “Looking at the unemployment rate, the weakness in that
number is clearly dollar-negative because of the Fed’s comments
on QE3 and the market’s expectations around how long that will
last,”  Vassili Serebriakov , a foreign-exchange strategist at
BNP Paribas SA in New York, said in a telephone interview.  The Mexican peso and Brazil’s real were the biggest winners
today among the greenback’s 16 most-traded counterparts.  The peso appreciated 0.5 percent to 12.7414 per dollar
after earlier falling as much as 0.2 percent. The real
strengthened 0.7 percent to 2.0325 per dollar.  Kiwi Climbs  New Zealand ’s dollar, nicknamed the kiwi, gained 0.4
percent to 83.17 U.S. cents after falling 0.8 percent earlier.  Sterling declined versus most major peers after a report
showed the U.K.  services  sector unexpectedly shrank in December.
The pound fell 0.2 percent to $1.6069 and touched $1.6010, its
lowest level since Dec. 7.  The pound weakened 0.7 percent over the past three months,
the biggest loser after the yen among 10 developed-nation
currencies monitored by the Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted
Indexes. The Japanese currency slid 12 percent, while the dollar
gained 0.1 percent.  The yen fell for an eighth week against the dollar, the
longest stretch of losses since February 1989, tumbling 2.5
percent since Dec. 28. Even so, it’s still stronger than its 10-
year average of 101.22 per dollar.  Japan ’s newly installed Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said on
Jan. 1 the most urgent issue for his country was to break out of
currency appreciation and deflation. “Bold” monetary policy is
one of the three prongs of his economic measures, he said.  BOJ Meeting  The  Bank of Japan  will hold its first 2013 policy meeting
Jan. 21-22 after expanding its asset-purchase program by 10
trillion yen ($113 billion) at its last session on Dec. 20.  U.S. employers added 155,000 workers last month following a
revised 161,000 advance in November that was more than initially
estimated, Labor Department figures showed today in  Washington .
The median estimate of 82 economists surveyed by Bloomberg was
for  a gain of 152,000.  The dollar reached a two-week low versus the euro on Jan. 2
as safety demand ebbed a day after Congress approved a bill that
made income-tax cuts from the George W. Bush-era permanent for
most workers. The legislation broke a yearlong impasse over how
to avert $600 billion in automatic tax boosts and spending cuts
that were set to start taking effect this year.  Debt Ceiling  The greenback gained yesterday versus most major peers as
speculation that U.S. policy makers will struggle to reach
agreement on raising the nation’s $16.4 trillion debt ceiling
fueled demand for safety.  The dollar extended gains yesterday after minutes of the
Fed’s Dec. 11-12 meeting showed that board members said they’ll
probably end the central bank’s $85 billion in monthly bond
purchases some time in 2013. The Fed bought $2.3 trillion of
Treasury and mortgage-related debt from 2008 to 2011 in the
first two rounds of quantitative easing.  The central bank said Dec. 12 it would hold borrowing costs
low “at least as long” as the  unemployment rate  remains above
6.5 percent and inflation projections are for no more than 2.5
percent. The jobless rate had stayed above 8 percent since
February 2009 until it broke the trend in September.  To contact the reporters on this story:
