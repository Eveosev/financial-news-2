A private investment fund led by
Chilean broker and asset manager Larrain Vial SA agreed to pay
about $500 million for all of local health insurer and medical
services company Colmena Golden Cross SA, El Mercurio said.  Among other investors in the fund are Grupo Bethia SA, the
Santiago-based newspaper said, citing people close to the
negotiations who it didn’t identify.  A phone call to Colmena’s public relations office went
unanswered. An e-mail and phone call to Larrain Vial’s
communications office seeking comment on the acquisition also
