Capital & Counties Properties Plc (CAPC) ,
part owner of  London ’s landmark Covent Garden market, won
approval from Hammersmith & Fulham council for an 8 billion
pound ($12.9 billion) development in London’s Earls Court and
Olympia neighborhoods.  CapCo’s EC Properties unit will develop 57 acres (23
hectares) of the Earls Court and West Kensington Opportunity
Area, which includes the Earls Court Exhibition Centre, the
council said in a statement after a planning-committee meeting
yesterday.  The project would create more than 6,700 homes, 84,701
square meters (911,714 square feet) of  office space , a hospital
and 32,256 square meters of stores, hotels and serviced
apartments, according to a statement on Hammersmith & Fulham
council’s website. London-based CapCo won approval from the
council in February for its plan to turn a parking lot in the
Earls Court neighborhood into 808 homes.  “The proposed scheme will offer a multi-billion-pound
investment in both London and the local community, creating
thousands of new homes and jobs,” CapCo Chief Executive Officer
Ian Hawksworth said in a statement today.  The plan is also being assessed by the Royal Borough of
Kensington & Chelsea.  To contact the reporter on this story:
