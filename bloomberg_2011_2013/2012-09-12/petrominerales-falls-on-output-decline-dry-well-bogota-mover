Petrominerales Ltd. (PMGC) , a Calgary-
based  oil company  that operates in the Andean region, slumped
after saying production declined in August and new tests at a
Colombian exploration well showed only water.  Shares fell 15 percent to 15,100 pesos at the close of
trading in Bogota, the largest drop since Aug. 2. The stock is
down 53 percent this year, the worst performer on the benchmark
Colcap Index, which has climbed 7.1 percent.  The potential of Petrominerales’ Bromelia exploration well
in eastern  Colombia  “has wilted,” RBC Capital analysts Nathan Piper and Theresa Pfab wrote in an e-mailed report as they cut
their rating to the equivalent of hold from buy. Production,
which averaged 31,113 barrels of oil a day in the second
quarter, was 19 percent lower in August at 25,235 barrels, the
company said.  “After a relatively barren exploration campaign the
company, in our view, needs to convince investors it has the
geological nous to deliver,” the RBC Capital analysts wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
