Rwanda signed a 220 million euro
($283 million) agreement with  Turkey ’s Hakan Mining and
Generation Industry and Trade Inc. to build a 100-megawatt peat-
fired power plant.  The generating facility, which will be located in South
Akanyaru in the Southern Province, will raise the East African
nation’s generating capacity by 90 percent, the  Ministry of
Infrastructure  said in an e-mailed statement.  “Private initiatives and investments in the construction,
development and maintenance of sustainable electricity-
generating plants provide great economic value,” Emma Francoise
Isumbingabo, minister of state in charge of energy and water,
said in the statement yesterday.  Rwanda has estimated dry peat reserves of 155 million tons,
three-quarters of which are near the plant’s location, according
to Isumbingabo. That could generate 450 MW of power annually for
25 years, she said.  Hakan Mining is expected to begin building a peat-
extraction facility and the power plant within 12 months to 15
months, she said, without giving a completion date.  To contact the reporter on this story:
