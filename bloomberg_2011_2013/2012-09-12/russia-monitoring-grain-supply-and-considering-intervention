(Corrects Dvorkovich’s title in second paragraph of story
that ran Sept. 12.)  Russia , the world’s third-biggest
wheat exporter last season, is monitoring its grain supply on a
weekly basis after drought damaged crops this year.  The country, which banned exports for more than 10 months
following the worst drought in at least half a century in 2010,
isn’t planning to restrict shipments, Deputy Prime Minister
 Arkady Dvorkovich  said yesterday in  London .  Russia maintains its forecast for a harvest of 70 million
to 75 million metric tons of grain, said Dvorkovich, who
described the export pace as satisfactory. The country may run
out of grain available for shipments in November, a Bloomberg
survey of traders showed last month. Exports were forecast by
the government on Aug. 31 to be 10 million to 14 million tons.  The country will use an intervention fund to sell
stockpiles when the time is right and will probably discuss the
situation next week, Dvorkovich said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
