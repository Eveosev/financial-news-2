U.S. stocks erased gains as
investors sold shares of  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  after the introduction of
the new iPhone, dragging shares of technology companies lower.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index was little changed at
1,433.82 at 3:03 p.m. in New York. Apple lost as much as 0.7
percent, reversing a gain of as much as 1.2 percent and reaching
its low of the session about two hours after unveiling the new
iPhone.  U.S. shares rallied earlier after a German court cleared
the way for the nation to ratify its involvement in Europe’s
permanent rescue fund and investors weighed prospects for more
stimulus from the  Federal Reserve  before the central bank
releases its policy statement tomorrow.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
