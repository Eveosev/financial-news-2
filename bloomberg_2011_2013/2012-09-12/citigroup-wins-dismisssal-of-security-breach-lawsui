Citigroup Inc., the third-largest
U.S. bank, won dismissal of a suit in which cardholders claimed
the bank failed to take adequate steps to prevent a computer
security breach that affected more than 360,000 accounts.  Kristina and Steven Orman of Northport,  New York , sued
Citigroup in federal court in  Manhattan  in October, seeking to
represent victims of the hacking in a class-action, or group,
lawsuit. They claimed they were victims of identity theft and
money was stolen from their bank account and their credit cards
following the breach.  U.S. District Judge  Deborah Batts  in Manhattan today ruled
that the dispute should be decided by an arbitrator. She said
the plaintiffs didn’t dispute that they had entered into an
arbitration agreement with the bank. She also said the lawsuit
didn’t assert any claims under federal law.  “Dismissal of this action is therefore warranted,” the
judge said in the order.  Citigroup said in June 2011 that the breach, affecting
1.5 percent of its card customers in  North America , was
discovered at Citi Account Online during routine monitoring.
Customers’ names, account numbers and e-mail addresses were
viewed, Citigroup said.  “We are pleased with the court’s ruling in this matter,”
Emily Collins, a spokeswoman for New York-based Citigroup, said
in statement. “We will not comment further because this matter
may continue in arbitration.”  The case is Orman v.  Citigroup Inc. (C) , 11-cv-7086, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
