Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) , Europe’s
largest oil company, bought liquids-rich shale acreage in Texas
from  Chesapeake Energy Corp. (CHK)  for $1.9 billion as part of a U.S.
expansion drive.  The Anglo-Dutch company will acquire 618,000 net acres in
the Permian Basin in West Texas that pump about 26,000 barrels
of oil equivalent a day, according to a statement today. It
expects to close the deal within 30 days.  “The acquisition provides both existing production and
near-term growth potential from a proven resource, as well as
promising opportunities for expansion,” Shell said.  Shell has been building the firepower to make acquisitions
as record cash flow cuts debt to the lowest level in three
years. Chief Executive Officer  Peter Voser  has signaled he’s on
the hunt for purchases, noting in July that Shell sold $6
billion more in assets than it bought over the past 18 months.  Shell’s biggest purchases in recent years have been in
 North America , where natural-gas prices at the lowest in almost
10 years have spurred some companies to sell assets.  In 2010, Shell paid $4.7 billion for East Resources Inc., a
U.S. shale driller, and in 2008 it forked out $5.8 billion on
Duvernay Oil Corp., a Canadian gas producer.  Shell sold about $12 billion in assets and made about $6
billion in acquisitions in the 18 months to July. The company
held about $17.3 billion  in cash  at the end of June, while net
debt stood at $15.7 billion, the lowest since 2008.  The latest deal is part of a series of sales by Chesapeake
of oil and gas fields and other assets that raised $6.9 billion
to narrow a  cash-flow  shortfall.  To contact the reporter on this story:
