Dish Network Corp. (DISH)  reached a deal
with  Glenn Beck  to bring his Internet-only video network to its
satellite service, ending the conservative talk-show host’s
hiatus from television.  TheBlaze TV, the streaming network Beck started last year,
will operate as a 24-hour TV network available to Dish
customers, Englewood, Colorado-based Dish said today in a
statement. Customers who buy Dish’s 250-channel package will get
TheBlaze TV as an included channel, and subscribers with smaller
bundles can pay $5 a month for access.  Beck, 48, left News Corp.’s Fox News on June 30, 2011, to
begin his subscription-based online TV network, originally
called GBTV. The service, which features news and commentary,
has more than 300,000 subscribers and will continue streaming
over the Web, according to  Beck’s site .  Beck’s show on Fox averaged 1.95 million viewers in the
first quarter of 2011. While ratings had dropped 29 percent from
a year earlier, the talk show was among the top 40 most-watched
programs on cable.  TheBlaze TV has been contacted by other pay-TV providers
for distribution, Christopher Balfe, CEO of the business, said
in a blog post on Beck’s website. On Dish, the service will be
offered on channel 212, starting today at 5 p.m. New York time.
It will be available as a free preview to all customers through
Sept. 26.  Dish rose 0.4 percent to $32.70 at the close in New York.
The shares have gained 15 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
