Oil explorers operating off the
Falkland Islands rose in  London  trading on speculation that
 Falkland Oil & Gas Ltd. (FOGL)  had completed its delayed Loligo well.  Falkland Oil, which is focused on the southern part of the
islands, jumped 16 percent, the most since April, while  Borders
& Southern Petroleum Plc (BOR)  gained 5.7 percent.  Argos Resources
Ltd. (ARG)  climbed 4.7 percent.  Falkland Oil is clawing back gains after falling the most
in two years on Sept. 10 following the delay at Loligo. The
London-based company said at the time the well would reach
targeted depth within 24 hours.  “Obviously there are rumors going around,” said Laura Loppacher, an analyst at Jefferies International Ltd. in London.
“They should be logging the well results by now.”  Oil explorers are targeting 8.3 billion barrels in waters
around the islands in the South Atlantic Ocean this year, three
times the U.K.’s reserves. A spokesman for Falkland Oil couldn’t
immediately comment on the share price.  Rockhopper Exploration Plc (RKH) , which owns licenses in waters
north of the islands, slipped 0.7 percent to 179 pence.  Rockhopper was the first to make a commercial find in the
region. Borders & Southern in April announced a discovery of gas
condensate at its Darwin prospect, close to Falkland Oil’s
fields, and said in July it found gas at Stebbing, though not in
commercial quantities.  Falkland Oil started drilling at the Loligo prospect on
Aug. 3.  To contact the reporter on this story:
