Japanese  stocks  climbed, with the
 Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  reaching its highest in two weeks, on
speculation policy makers in the U.S. and China will announce
plans to stimulate the world’s largest economies and as
machinery orders in Japan beat expectations.  Fanuc Corp. (6954) , Japan’s biggest maker of industrial robots,
gained 2.2 percent. Canon Inc., a camera maker that relies on
the Americas for 27 percent of its revenue, advanced 2.6 percent.
Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd. gained 0.9 percent. Oki
Electric Industry Ltd. slumped 11 percent to lead declines on
the Nikkei 225 after saying accounting irregularities would cut
profit more than previously expected.  The benchmark Nikkei 225 gained 1.7 percent to 8,959.96 at
the close of trading in Tokyo. The broader Topix Index rose 1.3
percent to 741.82, with more than four stocks advancing for each
that fell. Stocks rose ahead of a Federal Reserve policy meeting.  “We’re going to see something coming through from the
Fed,” said  Chris Weston , a Melbourne-based trader at IG Markets
Ltd. “The signs that we got from China that they’ll meet their
targets are also positive. The market’s being supported by
central banks and there’s some juice left in these markets.”  The Topix dropped 15 percent from this year’s peak on March
27 through yesterday on concern Europe’s debt crisis is
deepening and as growth slows in China and the U.S. The gauge
trades at 0.9 times book value, compared with 2.2 for the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and 1.5 for the Stoxx Europe 600
Index. A number below one means companies can be bought for less
than the value of their assets.  Fed Meeting  Futures on the S&P’s 500 gained 0.2 percent today. The
gauge rose 0.3 percent in  New York  yesterday before the  Federal
Open Market Committee  starts a two-day meeting today to discuss
additional measures to stimulate the  U.S. economy . Chairman  Ben
S. Bernanke  said on Aug. 31 he wouldn’t rule out steps to lower
an unemployment rate he described as a “grave concern.”  Shares also rose on prospects for easing in China. The
nation still has “ample strength” in either monetary or fiscal
domains to propel economic growth, Wen said yesterday at the
 World Economic Forum  in the city of Tianjin, adding the
government has 100 billion  yuan  ($16 billion) in a fiscal
stabilization fund.  “We will appropriately use that for preemptive policy and
fine-tuning to propel stable economic growth,” Wen said,
reiterating the country will continue to place more emphasis on
ensuring stable growth.  Fanuc climbed 2.2 percent to 13,170 yen. Canon gained 2.6
percent to 2,640 yen.  Machinery Orders  Japan’s machinery orders rose more than estimated in July
even as weakness in exports and waning subsidies for auto
purchases threaten to stifle economic growth. Orders climbed 4.6
percent gaining 5.6 percent in June, the Cabinet Office said
today in Tokyo. The median estimate of 29 economists surveyed by
 Bloomberg News  was for a 2 percent increase.  Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd. gained 1.3 percent to 324
yen.  Oki Electric  slid 11 percent to 89 yen after the
communications-equipment provider said improper accounting at
its Spanish unit will cut profit by 30.8 billion yen ($395
million).  To contact the reporter on this story:
