German 10-year bunds extended
declines after the nation’s  Constitutional Court  ratified
Europe’s permanent bailout fund, the 500 billion-euro European
Stability Mechanism, with conditions.  Germany’s 10-year yield rose seven basis points, or 0.07
percentage point, to 1.61 percent as of 9:23 a.m. London time.  Europe’s biggest economy must make sure its share of the
ESM is capped at 190 billion euros, the court said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
