Asian currencies rose to a four-
month high on optimism potential stimulus measures by China and
the U.S., among the region’s biggest export markets, will boost
inflows to emerging economies.  Malaysia’s ringgit and Taiwan’s dollar reached their
strongest levels since May after Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao said
yesterday the nation will appropriately use preemptive policy to
bolster growth. Global funds bought $650 million more stocks in
India,  South Korea , Taiwan and the Philippines than they sold
this week, bringing the tally for those countries to more than
$26 billion this year, exchange data show.  “Speculation about China’s stimulus is supportive for
Asian countries that have strong trade ties with China,” said
Tohru Nishihama, an economist at Dai-ichi Life Research
Institute Inc. in Tokyo. “Under the current environment where
investors remain somewhat cautious, funds are coming to Asia and
more so to the bond markets.”  The Bloomberg-JPMorgan Asia Dollar Index, which tracks the
region’s most-active currencies, rose 0.1 percent to 116.24 and
touched a four-month high of 116.25. The ringgit jumped 0.6
percent to 3.0732 per dollar as of 4:50 p.m. in  Kuala Lumpur ,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The  Thai baht  rose 0.5
percent to 30.94 and Taiwan’s dollar advanced 0.2 percent to
NT$29.669. The Philippine peso rallied as much as 0.3 percent to
41.445, a level last seen in April 2008.  Fed Measures  Premier Wen said yesterday that China has “ample
strength” to use fiscal and monetary policy to boost the
economy, which grew 7.6 percent last quarter, the slowest pace
in more than three years. An official report on Sept. 10 showed
China’s imports unexpectedly fell 2.6 percent in August.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc., UBS AG and JPMorgan Chase & Co.
are among banks predicting the  Federal Reserve  will undertake a
third round of quantitative easing, known as QE3, at a two-day
meeting starting today. The  European Central Bank  agreed on Sept.
6 to an unlimited debt-purchase program to help stem the
sovereign crisis.  “Sentiment is pretty risk-on today,” said  James Wang , a
fixed-income trader at Yuanta Securities Co. in Taipei. “If the
U.S. really launches QE3, it’ll attract more money into riskier
assets.”  Rate Decisions  South Korea’s won advanced for a fifth day, closing up 0.2
percent at a one-month high of 1,126.50 per dollar. Fifteen of
16 economists in a  Bloomberg News survey  say the  Bank of Korea 
will cut its seven-day repurchase rate to 2.75 percent from 3
percent tomorrow. One forecasts no change.  Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas will hold its overnight rate at
3.75 percent at a policy meeting tomorrow, according to 16 of 20
economists in a separate survey. Four forecast a cut to 3.5
percent. Policy stance is appropriate for now, Deputy Governor
Diwa Guinigundo said on Sept. 8.  Elsewhere, China’s  yuan  appreciated 0.14 percent to 6.3264
per dollar, according to the China Foreign Exchange Trade System.
The  Indian rupee  rose 0.3 percent to 55.1950, Indonesia’s rupiah
weakened 0.1 percent to 9,589 and Vietnam’s dong was little
changed at 20,850.  To contact the reporter on this story:
