million, the APIâ€™s weekly report showed.  Distillate fuel
inventories  rose 2.55 million to 128.9 million.  Crude at Cushing, Oklahoma , the delivery point for futures
traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , dropped 382,000 to
44.5 million.  The Energy Department is scheduled to release its inventory

2.9 million barrels, according to the median of 11 responses in
a Bloomberg survey of analysts. Gasoline inventories dropped 1.7
million barrels and distillate stockpiles fell 500,000,
