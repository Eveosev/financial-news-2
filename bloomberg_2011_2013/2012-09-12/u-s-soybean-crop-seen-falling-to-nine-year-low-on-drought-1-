U.S. soybean farmers will harvest
the smallest crop in nine years after June and July were the
hottest and driest since 1936, the government said. Prices rose
the most in three weeks.  Production will drop to 2.634 billion bushels (71.69
million metric tons), down 14 percent from 3.056 billion in 2011
and the lowest since 2003, the  U.S. Department of Agriculture 
said today. The average estimate of 34 analysts polled by
 Bloomberg News  was 2.659 billion bushels. A month ago, the USDA
predicted 2.692 billion.  Soybean prices are up 45 percent this year, reaching an
all-time high last week, as crop  conditions  deteriorated to the
worst since 1988. Output is dropping for a third straight year
in the U.S., the largest grower, as demand increases for soy-
based livestock feed and vegetable oil in  China , where imports
are forecast to reach a record for a ninth year.  “We have a huge shortage that is unprecedented and will
require higher prices to slow demand,”  Jerry Gidel , the chief
feed-grain analyst for Rice Dairy LLC in  Chicago , said in a
telephone interview. “The U.S. beef and dairy industry will
have to use less soybean feed to leave enough for the hog and
poultry producers the remainder of this year.”  Soybeans for November delivery jumped 2.6 percent to close
at $17.4575 a bushel at 2 p.m. on the Chicago Board of Trade,
the biggest gain since Aug. 21. Prices reached a record $17.89
on Sept. 4.  Meal Surges  Soybean meal for delivery in December rose 3.1 percent to
$532.10 for 2,000 pounds on the CBOT. The high-protein  animal
feed , which rose the most since Aug. 9, reached a record $541.80
on Sept. 4. The feed ingredient has risen 70 percent this year.  Soybeans and soybean meal have gained the most this year
among the 24 commodities tracked by the Standard & Poor’s GSCI
Index, outpacing gains in global equities and U.S. Treasuries.  Falling supplies may reduce margins for meat producers
 Tyson Foods Inc. (TSN)  and  Smithfield Foods Inc. (SFD) , which buy soy-based
animal feed. Cargill Inc. said last month that quarterly
earnings fell 82 percent because of poor trading performance and
lower beef margins.  Oilseed processors such as  Bunge Ltd. (BG)  and Archer Daniels
Midland Co. may benefit from a global shortage of animal feed.
The central Illinois crush spread -- the difference between the
cost of a bushel of soybeans and the value of the meal and oil
it can produce -- is more than double the average of the past
nine years.  Consumption Outlook  “The rising margins means it will be more difficult to
slow consumption quickly,”  Roy Huckabay , an executive vice
president for the Linn Group in Chicago, said by telephone.
“Soybeans need to rise in value relative to soybean meal and
soybean oil to curtail soybean use.”  Farmers will collect about 35.3 bushels per acre, the
lowest yield since 2008 and down from 36.1 bushels forecast in
August and 41.5 bushels last year, the USDA said in today’s
report. About 74.6 million acres will be harvested, unchanged
from August, the department said.  Reserve supplies before next year’s harvest will total 115
million bushels, the USDA said. Analysts expected 106 million,
on average. The surplus on Aug. 31 will total 130 million
bushels, compared with 145 million estimated in August,
according to the report.  The USDA said the average farm-gate price in the marketing
year that began Sept. 1 will be a record $16 a bushel, unchanged
from last month and 29 percent higher than last year.  Global Crop  World  production  in the year that begins Oct. 1 will reach
258.13 million metric tons, down from 260.46 million forecast a
month ago and up from a revised 237.09 million produced this
year, according to the report.  Brazil , which will produce 81
million tons this year, will surpass the U.S. as the top
producer for the first time, the USDA said.  Global soybean consumption will rise to a fourth straight
year to a record of 256.73 million tons, up 0.9 percent from a
year ago. Use in China, the biggest importer and hog producer,
will rise to a record 75.02 million, the ninth straight
increase.  World soybean  inventories  next year before the Northern
Hemisphere harvests will total 53.1 million tons, down from
53.38 million forecast in August and 53.65 million projected for
Sept. 30 this year. Traders expected 52.01 million tons, on
average.  To contact the reporter on this story:
