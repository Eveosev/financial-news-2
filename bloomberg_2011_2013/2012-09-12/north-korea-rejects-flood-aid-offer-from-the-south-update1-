North Korea  rejected South Korea’s
offer to provide 10,000 tons of flour, 3 million packets of
ramen noodles and medical aid, to help with the aftermath of
floods, South Korea’s Unification Ministry said today in a text
message.  North Korea said the aid wasn’t needed to cope with
suffering caused by recent torrential rain and typhoons.  The North accepted two days ago an offer by the South,
agreeing to discuss details of “unconditional aid” through the
 Red Cross .  To contact the reporter on this story:
