A federal judge permanently blocked
enforcement of a U.S. law that opponents claim may subject them
to indefinite military detention for activities including news
reporting and political activism.  U.S. District Judge Katherine Forrest in  Manhattan  today
ruled that the law, passed as part of the National Defense
Authorization Act for 2012, is unconstitutional. Forrest made
permanent the preliminary injunction against the law that she
had ordered in May. The government is appealing her May order.  “The Constitution places affirmative limits on the power
of the Executive to act, and these limits apply in times of
peace as well as times of war,” Forrest wrote in a 112-page
opinion today. “Heedlessly to refuse to hear constitutional
challenges to the Executive’s conduct in the name of deference
would be to abdicate this court’s responsibility to safeguard
the rights it has sworn to uphold.”  The suit was filed Jan. 13 by a group including former  New
York  Times reporter Christopher Hedges. The plaintiffs contend
that Section 1021(b) of the law allows for detention of citizens
and permanent residents taken into custody in the U.S. on
“suspicion of providing substantial support” to people engaged
in hostilities against the U.S., such as al-Qaeda.  The plaintiffs claimed the law is vague and can be read to
authorize their detention based on speech and associations that
are protected by the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.  The case is Hedges v. Obama, 12-cv-00331, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporters on this story:
