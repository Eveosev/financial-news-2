Portugal ’s  consumer price index 
rose in August from a year earlier at a faster pace than
recorded in July.  Consumer prices, using a harmonized European Union measure,
climbed 3.2 percent from a year earlier, more than the 2.8
percent increase in July, the Lisbon-based National Statistics
Institute said today in an e-mailed statement. Prices fell 0.1
percent from July.  Using the statistics institute’s own methods, consumer
prices in Portugal rose 3.1 percent in August from a year
earlier and also fell 0.1 percent from July.  To contact the reporter on this story:
