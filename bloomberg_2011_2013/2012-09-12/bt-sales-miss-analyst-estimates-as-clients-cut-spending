BT Group Plc (BT/A)  surged to the highest
price in four years after Credit Suisse said the U.K.’s largest
fixed-line phone provider will benefit from accelerating
broadband demand, and as it snatched rugby rights from a rival.  BT will gain more fiber business at the same time that the
European Commission adapts a “more positive stance” on
regulation, Credit Suisse said today in a note to investors. The
bank raised its  share-price forecast  to 300 pence from 250 pence
and reiterated an outperform recommendation.  The stock  gained  3.8 percent to 235.2 pence, the highest
 price  since May 2008. BT has advanced 51 percent in 12 months,
valuing the London-based company at 18.5 billion pounds
($29.8 billion)  BT is adding sports rights to expand its TV business and
sell more broadband connections. The company has accelerated its
rollout of fiber broadband by one year to fend off faster Web
offers from competitors such as  Virgin Media Inc. (VMED)  and  British
Sky Broadcasting Group Plc. (BSY)   BT said today it will pay as much as 152 million pounds
($245 million) to show major English Rugby matches, taking away
the broadcasting rights from BSkyB and ESPN. The rights to live
Aviva Premiership rugby matches are currently split between
BSkyB, controlled by  Rupert Murdoch ’s  News Corp. (NWSA) , and  Walt
Disney Co. (DIS) ’s ESPN channel.  BSkyB said it will show European competition matches,
disputing BT’s contention that it has those rights starting with
the 2014 season. The European Rugby Cup will meet Sept. 18 to
set competition rules, the organization said.  ‘Thrilling’ Sports  BT, which earlier this year added some rights for English
Premier League soccer matches, will exclusively show 69 Aviva
Premiership Rugby matches each season for four years starting
with the 2013-14 season, the company said today in a statement.  “BT is serious about sport and this deal means we will be
offering the very best rugby action alongside some of the most
thrilling football matches from the Premier League,” said Marc Watson, chief executive officer of BT’s Vision service.  The TV rights deal will boost rugby club broadcast revenue
by 50 percent as the number of games shown changes, said Paul
Morgan, a spokesman for the league.  BT added Premier League soccer rights for the seasons
starting in 2013 and 2015, and will start a channel to carry the
games. The soccer deal will cut earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization by 100 million pounds and  cash
flow  by 200 million pounds in 2013 and 2014, the company has
said. BT will pay 246 million pounds a season for rights to 38
live soccer games.  Competition Rights  The rugby deal also allows BT to show matches from the JP
Morgan Asset Management Sevens Series for four years starting
from the 2013-14 season and games of Aviva Premiership teams in
any future European competitions for three years starting from
the 2014-15 season, the company said.  Credit Suisse also said that the London-based
telecommunications provider will become more efficient as
employees retire.  “BT’s U.K. wireline business remains the most inefficient
in  Europe ,” generating $243,000 a year per full-time worker,
compared to a European average of $330,000, Credit Suisse said.
BT will probably reduce its workforce by about 3,500 jobs a
year, mainly through retirements, to bring it closer to the
average, the bank said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
