OAO Uralkali, the worldâ€™s largest
potash producer by output, fell the most in two weeks in Moscow
today after the sinkhole near its former production unit
widened, killing a worker.  The shares lost 1.6 percent to 252.23 rubles at 3:05 p.m.
in Moscow. The benchmark Micex Index rose less than 0.1 percent.  The company suspended repair work at the shuttered
production unit after sand and gravel that were filled into a
sinkhole collapsed, killing a worker, the company said in a
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
