TheStreet Inc. (TST) , owner of the
financial website TheStreet.com, bought The Deal LLC, a news
service covering mergers and acquisitions, for $5.8 million in
cash.  The Deal, based in  New York , was founded in 1999 as a print
newspaper before shifting its focus online. As part of the
purchase, TheStreet will undertake a restructuring that includes
the termination of some of The Deal’s employees, according to a
 filing today . It will also discontinue a print magazine,
TheStreet Chief Executive Officer Elisabeth Demarse said.  “The majority of the employees will be coming over,”
Demarse said in a telephone interview. Most of the staff cuts
will happen in the administrative ranks, she said. Some of The
Deal’s journalists will be kept on and could fill spots
currently vacant in TheStreet’s newsroom, Demarse said.  “Altogether, we’re very excited to have The Deal as part
of the company,” she said.  The Deal, owned by private-equity firm Wasserstein & Co.,
currently employs around 110 workers, Demarse said.  Wasserstein & Co. was founded by  Bruce Wasserstein , who
purchased New York magazine for $55 million in 2003. He died in
2009, leaving much of his assets to his family.  TheStreet, co-founded by  Jim Cramer  in 1996, fell 0.7
percent to $1.39 at the New York close. The stock has declined
17 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
