Regions Financial Corp. (RF) , the 10th-
largest U.S. bank by deposits, arranged its wealth-management
business into four units and named leaders for each.  Personal trust and private banking combined into one unit,
private wealth management, led by Nick Stonestreet, 51,
Birmingham, Alabama-based Regions said today in a statement.
Asset management and corporate trust merged to form
institutional services, overseen by Ken Alderman, 60, who’s also
chairman of  investment management . Jim Nonnengard will lead
investment services and Curren Coco will head insurance.  “Our goal is to make financial management simple,
convenient and more rewarding for our clients,” Bill Ritter,
41, who runs the wealth-management group, said in the statement.  Chief Executive Officer Grayson Hall announced plans in
June 2011 to form a wealth-management group to help increase fee
revenue. Record-low interest rates are squeezing net-interest
margins, the difference between what a bank pays to borrow money
and what it gets for loans. Regions sold its Morgan Keegan
brokerage to  Raymond James Financial Inc. (RJF)  this year for total
proceeds of $1.2 billion.  Mike Daniel was named chief operating officer of the
wealth-management unit, Regions said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
