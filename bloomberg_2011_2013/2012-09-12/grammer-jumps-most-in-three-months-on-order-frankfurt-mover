Grammer AG (GMM) , a German maker of seats
for cars, buses and tractors,  jumped  the most in more than three
months after winning an order from Deutsche Bahn AG for 46,000
train seats.  Grammer, based in Amberg, will replace the seats in 770 of
Deutsche Bahn AGâ€™s intercity trains in an order to be filled
over three years, the company said in a statement today.  The shares rose as much as 0.98 euros, or 6.5 percent, to
16.13 euros, the biggest intraday increase since May 22. They
traded at 16.05 euros at 9.49 a.m. in Frankfurt, giving the
company a market value of 185 million euros ($238 million).  To contact the reporter on this story:
