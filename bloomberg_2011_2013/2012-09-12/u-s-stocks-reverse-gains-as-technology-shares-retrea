U.S. stocks reversed an early rally
as technology and raw-material companies turned lower.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index was up less than 0.1
percent at 1,434.04 at 10:46 a.m. in  New York  after climbing as
much as 0.4 percent. Technology stocks in the index erased a
gain of as much as 0.6 percent, while raw-material producers
declined 0.6 percent.  Stocks rose earlier sending the S&P 500 toward a four-year
high, after Germany’s highest constitutional court allowed the
country to ratify the euro area’s permanent bailout fund and
investors speculated the  Federal Reserve  will announce more
stimulus efforts tomorrow.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
