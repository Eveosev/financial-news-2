The first drinking water from a
desalination plant near  Melbourne  that will be  Australia ’s
biggest has been produced during an initial performance test.  Production that meets government drinking water guidelines
will be increased during commissioning over the next few months
with the plant capable of full production by the end of the
year, Thiess Degremont said in a statement.  Suez Environnement subsidiary Degremont won a 30-year
government contract in 2009 to build and operate the
desalination plant through a partnership with Aquasure that
includes Thiess. When done, it will provide 30 percent of
Melbourne’s water needs.  Suez, the second-largest water company, last month took a
second impairment since October related to the development of
the plant on rising costs, strikes and delays. The Paris-based
utility was forced to scrap a planned increase in the 2011
dividend due to plant expenses.  To contact the reporter on this story:
