Gold climbed for a second day
before a  Federal Reserve  policy meeting that may introduce more
stimulus to boost the world’s largest economy. Platinum is
poised for the longest rally in more than a year.  Cash gold rose as much as 0.3 percent to $1,736.45 an ounce,
and traded at $1,735.30 at 11:20 a.m., extending yesterday’s 0.3
percent gain as the dollar fell. The metal touched $1,741.70 on
Sept. 7, the most expensive since Feb. 29. Holdings in bullion-
backed exchange-traded products expanded to a record 2,487.361
metric tons yesterday, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  The  Federal Open Market Committee  starts a two-day meeting
today amid speculation it will introduce a third round of so-
called quantitative easing, or QE, sending the dollar to a four-
month low against the euro yesterday. The central bank bought
$2.3 trillion of debt in two rounds of QE from December 2008 to
June 2011, helping gold almost double in that period.  “Prices were higher on speculation that the Federal
Reserve will announce additional stimulus,”  Lachlan Shaw , an
analyst at  Commonwealth Bank of Australia , wrote in an e-mail.
“Prices also increased as the  U.S. dollar  weakened.”  Policy makers are acting to bolster their economies as
Europe’s fiscal crisis hurts global growth. Chinese Premier  Wen
Jiabao  signaled yesterday that there’s more room for fiscal and
monetary policy to support growth. Fifteen of 16 economists in a
Bloomberg News survey expect South Korea’s central bank to cut
 interest rates  tomorrow for the second time this year.  Platinum Gains  Spot platinum advanced for a ninth day in the longest
winning streak since August 2011 as labor unrest in  South Africa ,
the world’s largest producer, threatened supplies and investors
boosted ETP holdings near a record. The metal gained as much as
0.5 percent to $1,613.50 an ounce, the highest price since April
10, and traded at $1,608.  Workers at Lonmin Plc’s Marikana operation refused to
return to work after meeting government mediators, extending a
strike that’s into its second month. Holdings in exchange-traded
products have increased 14 percent to 45.7269 tons this year,
and are within 1.3 percent of last year’s all-time high.  Cash palladium dropped 0.6 percent to $666.25 an ounce,
snapping eight days of gains. The metal climbed to $678.85
yesterday, the highest price since May 2.  Silver rose for a second day, adding as much as 0.6 percent
to $33.6925 an ounce, and traded at $33.6263.  To contact the reporter on this story:
