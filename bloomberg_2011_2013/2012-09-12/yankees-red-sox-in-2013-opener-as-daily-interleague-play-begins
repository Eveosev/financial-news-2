The  New York Yankees  will host the
division-rival  Boston Red Sox  to open their 2013 campaigns as
 Major League Baseball  released its schedule, which includes
interleague play throughout the season.  With the Houston Astros moving to the American League West
next season from National League Central, baseball will have
interleague play each day because there will be 15 franchises in
each league.  The NL’s Cincinnati Reds host the AL’s Los Angeles Angels
to open the season, during which each team will play 19 games
against divisional opponents, six or seven games against non-
divisional league teams and 20 games against interleague foes,
MLB said on its website, releasing a preliminary  full-season
schedule.   The last day of the 2013 regular season is Sept. 29, when
the Detroit Tigers play at the  Miami Marlins  and the Astros host
the Yankees. The conclusion comes five days earlier than this
year’s regular-season end, allowing more flexibility for  a
post-season schedule that beginning this year includes an
additional wild-card team in each league.  The Yankees, who play 19 of their first 32 games at home,
begin their season against the  Red Sox  at Yankee Stadium for the
first time since 2005. New York is 18-11-1 in openers against
Boston. The franchises tied 4-4 due to darkness in 1910.  Dodgers-Yankees  The Los Angeles Dodgers visit the Yankees June 18-19,
marking the team’s first regular-season visit to Yankee Stadium
since it left the Brooklyn borough of New York in 1958. The
Dodgers also host the Yankees on July 30-31.  The Yankees and Mets continue their “Subway Series” with
games at Citi Field on May 27-28 and at Yankee Stadium on May
29-30. There were six games between the teams from 1999-2012.  The Mets host the  San Diego Padres  to open their season on
April 1, ending their campaign at home against the  Milwaukee
Brewers . Citi Field also will host the All-Star Game on July 16.  A third edition of the World Baseball Classic will take
place in March, with 28 nations competing. Japan won the first
two tournaments in 2006 and 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
