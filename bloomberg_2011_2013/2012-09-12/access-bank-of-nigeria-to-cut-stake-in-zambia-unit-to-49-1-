Access Bank Plc (ACCESS) ,  Nigeria ’s fourth-
biggest lender by market value, will cut to 49 percent its stake
in its Zambian unit after the southern African country raised
capital requirements, Chief Executive Officer Aigboje Aig- Imoukhuede said.  Access will cut its stake from 87 percent and convert the
unit to a local lender, Aig-Imoukhuede said on a conference call
today.  “We plan to convert to a local bank,” he said, without
saying who they will sell to. Segun Fafore, the lender’s Lagos-
based spokesman, didn’t answer a call made to his mobile phone
today.  Zambia raised the minimum capital requirement for
international banks to $100 million from $2.5 million and to $20
million for local banks in January. Nigerian lender  United Bank
for Africa Plc (UBA)  said in July it would also seek a local license.  Banks in the West African nation must obtain new funds to
recapitalize their foreign units and won’t be allowed to use
money already raised by their parent companies, the  Central Bank
of Nigeria  said in a statement on July 26.  Lenders that can’t raise additional capital for foreign
subsidiaries in the local market will have to close the units,
the Abuja-based regulator said.  Access Bank’s shares gained for a seventh day, adding 4.1
percent to 9.10 naira by the close today in Lagos, the highest
since March 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
