Algeria is seeking partners to
carry out a $60 billion shift to clean-energy sources,  Financial
Times Deutschland  reported, citing Noureddine Boutarfa, the head
of state-owned energy group Sonelgaz.  Sonelgaz has a target to supply 40 percent of the nation’s
power demand with renewables by 2030, the German newspaper said.
While German companies are welcome to team up with Sonelgaz
because of their technological expertise, they must bid at
competitive prices, Boutarfa told FTD.  Algeria is  Africa ’s largest natural-gas producer. It would
rather export more gas and invest the proceeds in clean-energy
generators that create jobs at home, than sell subsidized fuel
domestically to meet growing demand, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
