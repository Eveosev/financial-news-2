Russia  may start selling grain from
stockpiles in next year’s first quarter to stabilize the
domestic market, the country’s Grain Producers Union said.  Sales are unnecessary until then, Pavel Skurikhin, the
group’s president, said today in an e-mailed statement. The
local crop will fully meet domestic needs and Siberia’s harvest
will improve grain supplies, he said.  A 27 percent jump in grain prices since January is unlikely
to prompt severe food inflation in Russia because it may
translate into a smaller increase of 5 percent to 6 percent in
bread prices, the group said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
