BP Plc failed to sell  North Sea 
Forties crude. No bids or offers were made for Russian Urals in
Europe for a second day.  Two Forties cargoes for loading in October were deferred by
three to nine days, three people with knowledge of the shipping
schedule said.  North Sea  BP didn’t manage to sell Forties for Oct. 3 to Oct. 5
loading at 16 cents a barrel more than Dated Brent, 5 cents more
than its offer yesterday, according to a Bloomberg survey of
traders and brokers monitoring the Platts trading window.  Reported crude trading typically occurs during the Platts
window, which ends at 4:30 p.m.  London  time. Before the session,
Forties loading in 10 to 25 days was 28 cents a barrel less than
Dated Brent, compared with a discount of 22 cents yesterday,
data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Brent for October settlement traded at $115.94 a barrel on
the ICE Futures  Europe  exchange in London at the close of the
window, up from $115.13 yesterday. The November contract was
$115.38, a discount of 56 cents to October.  Forties consignment F0910 was postponed for a third time
after two delays earlier this week, and will now be exported on
Oct. 5 to Oct. 7, said the people, declining to be identified
because the information is confidential.  Lot F1004 was pushed back by nine days to load on Oct. 17
to Oct. 19, they said. A total of three cargoes for loading in
October have been deferred so far.  Vitol Group chartered a tanker to haul North Sea oil to
South Korea, the second such fixture to be booked in almost two
months, according to two traders with knowledge of the matter.  The company chartered the Suezmax-classed Reef to load
Forties crude from Hound Point in the U.K. on Aug. 25 to Aug. 26
and is scheduled to arrive in Daesan,  South Korea  on Oct. 5,
according to ship-tracking data from IHS Inc.  Mediterranean/Urals  Urals was at $1.48 a barrel less than Dated Brent for
delivery in the Mediterranean, the lowest since June 27,
compared with a discount of $1.45 yesterday, data compiled by
Bloomberg showed.  The outlook for Russian oil production for the remainder of
the year and 2013 “may not be as promising as recent
performance would suggest,” the  International Energy Agency 
said today in its monthly report.  Growth rates of crude output slowed to 1 percent in the
third quarter from 1.1 percent in the second quarter, the agency
said. “Brownfield declines have regained momentum, blunting the
impact of higher contributions from greenfields.”  “After strengthening by 1 percent in 2012, Russian
production looks set to decline by 0.5 percent in 2013,” the
agency said.  West Africa  Bharat Petroleum Corp. issued a tender to buy crude for
loading in November, according to a document obtained by
 Bloomberg News . The tender closes on Sept. 17 at 3 p.m. local
time, with offers valid until 7 p.m. the following day.  Qua Iboe fell 3 cents to $1.63 a barrel more than Dated
Brent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Angolan crude output is forecast to increase to 1.9 million
barrels a day in the fourth quarter, because of “continued
ramp-up of the 220,000 barrels a day Pazflor field and the
140,000 barrels a day Kizomba D satellite fields as well as
start‐up of the 150,000 barrels a day PSVM field,” the IEA said
in the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
