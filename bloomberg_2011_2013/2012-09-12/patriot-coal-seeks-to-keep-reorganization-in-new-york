Patriot Coal Corp. (PCXCQ) , its official
creditors’ committee and senior creditors today will ask a
bankruptcy judge to keep the coal producer’s reorganization in
New York after a hearing ended yesterday without a decision.  U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Shelley C. Chapman yesterday heard
lawyers from the mine workers’ union and U.S. Trustee argue that
the case should be sent to West Virginia, where eight of
Patriot’s 12 coal mines are located. Chapman said she might send
the case to St. Louis, home to Patriot’s headquarters, if she
decides Manhattan is the wrong venue.  The union and the Justice Department’s bankruptcy watchdog
contend in court papers that Patriot had no connections with New
York until two units were incorporated there about five weeks
before the July 9 Chapter 11 filing.  Patriot listed assets of $3.57 billion and debt of
$3.07 billion as of May 31 in court papers.  The case is In re Patriot Coal Corp., 12-12900,  U.S.
Bankruptcy Court , Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
