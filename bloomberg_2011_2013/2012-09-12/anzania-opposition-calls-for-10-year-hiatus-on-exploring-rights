Tanzania should impose a 10-year
moratorium on licensing offshore oil and gas blocks to allow for
the creation of laws ensuring the country benefits from its
natural wealth, Shadow Finance Minister  Zitto Kabwe  said.  Tanzania, the holder of East Africa’s second-biggest
natural-gas resources, in June tripled its estimate of
recoverable gas reserves to 28.7 trillion cubic feet. The
government postponed its next deep offshore bidding round,
originally scheduled to start tomorrow, pending the adoption of
a natural gas policy by lawmakers. Parliament may approve the
draft document as soon as October.  “A moratorium will not only allow us to manage our new
resources effectively, it will also ensure the welfare of future
generations,” Kabwe said in an e-mailed statement. It would
give time to set up a sovereign development fund, train
Tanzanians for jobs in the industry, and make sure oversight
bodies are monitoring oil and gas revenues, Kabwe said.  BG Group Plc (BG/)  and  Statoil ASA (STL)  have made offshore gas
discoveries possibly large enough to justify building a plant to
liquefy the fuel for domestic use and shipping, according to
state-run Tanzania Petroleum Development Corp. Tanzania has
signed a $1.2 billion loan agreement with the Export-Import Bank
of China to build a 500-kilometer (311 mile) pipeline from the
coastal town of Mtwara to  Dar es Salaam , the commercial hub.  To contact the reporter on this story:
