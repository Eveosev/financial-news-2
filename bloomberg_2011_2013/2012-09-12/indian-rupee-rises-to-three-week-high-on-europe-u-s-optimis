India ’s rupee rose to a three-week
high after a German court allowed ratification of a bailout fund
and on speculation the Federal Reserve will announce more bond
purchases to spur economic growth.  The currency strengthened for a second day as exchange data
showed foreign funds added $232 million to their Indian share
holdings. It briefly pared gains after a government report
showed  factory output  grew 0.1 percent in July from a year
earlier, falling short of the median forecast of economists in a
Bloomberg survey for a 0.5 percent gain.  “Further stimulus from the Fed, likely to be announced
this week, is creating a positive backdrop for risk appetite,”
said  Jonathan Cavenagh , a Singapore-based strategist at  Westpac
Banking Corp. (WBC)  “However, we suspect the poorer domestic
fundamentals are largely priced into the rupee at current
levels.”  The currency advanced 0.2 percent to 55.2300 per dollar in
Mumbai, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It touched
55.1475 earlier, the highest level since Aug. 23. The rupee has
gained 0.4 percent over the past two days as the Dollar Index,
which tracks the greenback against six major trading partners,
dropped 0.9 percent.  One-month implied volatility, a measure of exchange-rate
swings used to price options, fell 40 basis points, or 0.40
percentage point, to 8.50 percent, the lowest level since
September 2011.  Fed Meeting  Germany ’s top constitutional court rejected bids to block
ratification of a permanent euro-area rescue fund, while ruling
the country’s 190 billion euro ($245 billion) contribution can’t
be increased without legislative approval. The  Federal Reserve 
begins a two-day meeting today, with Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
and JPMorgan Chase & Co. predicting the Fed will undertake a
third round of quantitative easing. Euro-area finance ministers
are set to start meetings on Sept. 14.  India’s  inflation  picked up to 7.05 percent in August from
6.87 percent in July, according to the median estimate in a
separate Bloomberg survey for data due Sept. 14.  Three-month onshore rupee forwards were at 56.15 per
dollar, compared with 56.36 yesterday, and offshore non-
deliverable contracts were at 56.04 from 56.25. Forwards are
agreements to buy or sell assets at a set price and date. Non-
deliverable contracts are settled in dollars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
