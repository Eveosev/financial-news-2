SouthGobi Resources Ltd. (SGQ) , which
mines steelmaking coal in  Mongolia , fired Chief Executive
Officer Alexander Molyneux, effective immediately, eight days
after Aluminum Corp. of  China  Ltd. dropped its C$925 million
($949 million) takeover bid.  Molyneux will be replaced by Ross Tromans, the Vancouver-
based company said in a statement today. Tromans formerly
managed coal marketing at Rio Tinto Group, the London-based
mining company that controls SouthGobi through its ownership of
Vancouver’s Turquoise Hill Resources Ltd.  Aluminum Corp. of China, known as Chalco, dropped its offer
to buy a 60 percent stake in SouthGobi at C$8.48 a share,
according to a statement Sept. 3. The deal stalled in May when
Mongolia passed a law restricting foreign state-owned companies
from controlling key assets. SouthGobi halted all mining in
Mongolia as of June 30, according to a statement on Aug. 13.  SouthGobi’s second-quarter profit slumped more than 99
percent as customers cut orders. Net income fell to $237,000
from $67.3 million a year earlier as revenue fell 82 percent to
$8.4 million. Sales and earnings plunged due to the
“uncertainty” created by Chalco’s bid, the company said.  SouthGobi rose 4.3 percent to C$2.27 at 10:31 a.m. in
Toronto. The shares have slumped 71 percent since April 2, when
Chalco announced its takeover attempt.  Turquoise Hill, 51 percent owned by  Rio Tinto , changed its
name from Ivanhoe Mines Ltd. after Rio moved to a majority stake
in January. Turquoise Hill is SouthGobi’s largest shareholder
with a 58 percent stake, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
