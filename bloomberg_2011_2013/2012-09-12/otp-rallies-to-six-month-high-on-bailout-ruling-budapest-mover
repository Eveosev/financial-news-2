OTP Bank Nyrt. (OTP) , Hungary’s largest
lender, rallied to the strongest in six months after Germany’s
top constitutional court allowed the country to ratify a euro-
area bailout fund with certain conditions.  The shares rose 0.8 percent to 4,000 forint by 10:34 a.m.
in Budapest in a ninth day of advances, the longest streak of
gains since August 2009 and the highest intraday level since
March 2012. The benchmark BUX stock index fell 0.1 percent to
18,584.79.  Stocks in  Europe  rallied after the Federal Constitutional
Court in Karlsruhe today dismissed motions filed by groups
including a conservative lawmaker and an opposition political
party that sought to block the fund, known as the European
Stability Mechanism, and a deficit-control treaty championed by
 Chancellor Angela Merkel .  To contact the reporter on this story:
