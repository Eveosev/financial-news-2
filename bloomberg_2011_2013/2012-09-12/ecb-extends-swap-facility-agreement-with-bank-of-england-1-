The  European Central Bank  said it
extended a swap line with the  Bank of England  that was
originally set up to ease liquidity strains at Irish lenders.  The ECB and the BOE prolonged their liquidity swap
arrangement until Sept. 30, 2013, the Frankfurt-based central
bank said in an e-mailed statement. The BOE said on its website
it would provide the ECB with as much as 10 billion pounds ($16
billion) if needed.  The swap line was established in December 2010 when Irish
banks and their U.K. units struggled to raise funding in
financial markets amid an outflow of deposits following an 85-
billion euro ($137 billion) bailout. Policy makers last year
extended the facility until Sept. 28.  To contact the reporter on this story:
