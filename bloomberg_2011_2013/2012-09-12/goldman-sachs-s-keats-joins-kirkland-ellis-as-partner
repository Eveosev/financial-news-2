Michael C. Keats, a former managing
director in  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) ’s legal department, joined
law firm Kirkland & Ellis LLP as a litigation partner this week.  Keats, 43, was associate general counsel in the litigation
and regulatory proceedings group at Goldman Sachs, which he
joined in 2007, according to a  statement  on the law firm’s
 website . He was previously a securities and global enforcement
partner in O’Melveny & Myers LLP’s  New York  office.  “His experience at Goldman Sachs during a period of
extraordinary change and enforcement activity on  Wall Street 
will be a tremendous asset to our clients,” Jeffrey C. Hammes,
chairman of Kirkland’s global management executive committee,
said in the statement.  Goldman Sachs, the most profitable securities firm in Wall
Street history before converting to a bank in 2008, paid $550
million last year to settle a fraud accusation from the
Securities and Exchange Commission and was accused by the U.S.
Senate’s Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations of misleading
clients. The Justice Department said last month that it wouldn’t
pursue criminal charges against New York-based Goldman Sachs
related to information uncovered by the Senate subcommittee.  To contact the reporter on this story:
