European Union nations reiterated their support for the inclusion of aviation in the bloc’s emissions trading system, denying media reports that some members seek a suspension, the EU Climate Commissioner said.  “Clear corrections from governments on odd press story from yesterday: no changes in EU and member states approach on the ETS and aviation,”  Connie Hedegaard  said today on her Twitter Inc. account.  The 27-nation EU decided in 2008 to include flights to and from  Europe  within its greenhouse-gas-reduction system from 2012 after airline emissions in the region doubled over two decades. The enlargement of the cap-and-trade program triggered opposition from countries including the U.S., China and  Russia .  The European Commission, the EU regulatory arm, must craft a compromise as soon as possible, senior politicians from  France ,  Germany , Spain and the U.K. said yesterday at the Berlin air show. The comments followed a meeting with the management of Airbus SAS, which has said a trade dispute with  China  threatens to undermine its aircraft sales.  France upholds its position and continues to support the inclusion of aviation in the EU ETS while looking forward to a global solution, a government official, who declined to be identified citing policy, said today.  Non-EU countries opposing the expansion of the EU ETS into airlines say Europe should let the UN’s  International Civil Aviation Organization , or ICAO, regulate greenhouse-gas limits for the industry. The ICAO said in November it wants to strike a deal this year to create a global carbon system for airlines.  Germany’s position remains unchanged and the country doesn’t want to remove aviation from the EU carbon program, German official said today, declining to be identified citing policy. The country is looking forward to an ICAO solution, the official said.  The EU has repeatedly said it won’t give up its pollution curbs on airlines.  Spain  and the U.K. also confirmed today they haven’t changed their positions, an EU official said today, who declined to be identified citing policy.
