Canada’s dollar dropped from a 13-
month high versus its U.S. counterpart as technical measures
indicated the currency rally is approaching levels that traders
say suggest it may be overdone.  The 14-day relative strength index for the Canadian dollar
versus the  U.S. dollar  was 66.8, after touching 72.1 yesterday.
A reading above 70 indicates an asset may have rallied too far,
too quickly and may be due for a retracement.  “The Canada dollar had a pullback after such a push over
the past few days, but it was more of a correction than a
reflection of the greater economic picture,” Chris Gaffney, co-
chief investment officer of EverBank Wealth Management Inc.,
said in a phone interview from  St. Louis .  The loonie, as the currency is nicknamed for the image of
the waterfowl on the C$1 coin, fell 0.3 percent to 97.62 cents
per U.S. dollar at 5 p.m. in Toronto, after strengthening to
97.15 cents. It touched 97.14 cents yesterday, the highest since
Aug. 4, 2011. One Canadian dollar buys $1.0248.  The currency has gained 1.4 percent against the dollar over
the past five days before U.S.  Federal Reserve  announces its
interest-rate decision tomorrow. Investors anticipate the U.S.
central bank will announce a third round of bond buying, known
as quantitative easing, to spur the economy of Canada’s biggest
trading partner.  Linker Auction  Canadian bonds  fell, with the yield on the two-year
benchmark rising one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to
1.19 percent. The 2.25 percent bond decline 3 cents to C$101.97.
The 10-year yield rose five basis points to 1.90 percent.  Yields on Canadian inflation-protected bonds, called
linkers because returns are linked to  inflation , reached the
highest relative to U.S. linkers since March 2008 yesterday,
indicating investors are paying a higher premium for inflation
protection in the U.S.  Canada  auctioned C$400 million ($410 million) of 1.5
percent inflation-indexed bonds due December 2044. The sale
today drew an average yield of 0.537 percent and a coverage
ratio -- the amount bid relative to the amount on offer -- of
3.04 times.  Canada’s previous auction of real-return bonds, on May 30,
drew a median yield of 0.437 percent and a bid-to-cover ratio of
2.63 times, according to  Bank of Canada  data. The bonds were
yielding 0.587 percent after the sale.  Losses in the Canadian dollar were limited as global stocks
rallied after the top German court rejected efforts to block a
permanent euro-area rescue fund. The Standard & Poor’s/TSX
Composite Index  rose  0.1 percent and the MSCI World Index of
stocks gained 0.4 percent.  “The Canadian dollar is influenced by global risk,”  Jack Spitz , managing director of foreign exchange at  National Bank of
Canada (NA)  in Toronto, said in a phone interview. “We’re seeing
good corporate need to buy U.S. dollars against Canada down at
these levels.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
