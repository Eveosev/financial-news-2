The third and final Twenty20
cricket match between England and South Africa was delayed by
rain at Edgbaston, Birmingham.  The game was due to start at 6:30 p.m. local time, and
there will now be an inspection at 7:15 p.m.  The second match two days ago was abandoned because of rain
in Manchester, denying hosts England the chance to even the
series. South Africa won the opening game in Durham by seven
wickets.  South Africa is No. 1 in the  International Cricket
Council ’s Twenty20 rankings, while England is the defending
world champion in T20, the sport’s shortest format. The World
Twenty20 tournament starts in  Sri Lanka  on Sept. 18.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
