Overseas  investors  bought a net
 5.56 billion rupees  of Indian stocks yesterday, raising their
investment in the equities this year to 649.7 billion rupees, or
$12.6 billion, according to the nation’s market regulator.  Foreigners bought 18.5 billion rupees of shares and sold
12.9 billion rupees, the Securities & Exchange Board of India
said on its  website  today. They bought a net 2.58 billion rupees
of bonds, taking total inflow into debt this year to 232.7
billion rupees, the data  show .  The benchmark  BSE India Sensitive Index (SENSEX)  has increased 16.5
percent this year, helped by the biggest overseas equity flows
among 10 Asian markets tracked by Bloomberg. Flows surged to a
record in 2010, making the Sensex the best performer among the
world’s top 10 markets. The largest-ever outflow in 2008 led the
biggest annual slump of 52 percent.  Foreigners have invested 5.094 trillion rupees in stocks
and 1.44 trillion rupees in bonds since they were allowed into
the country in 1993.  The regulator provides data on shares bought and sold by
large investors, including trades in the primary and secondary
markets, with a delay of at least a day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
