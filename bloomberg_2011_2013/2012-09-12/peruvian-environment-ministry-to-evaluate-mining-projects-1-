Peru’s  Environment Ministry  will
help ease anti-mining protests by evaluating environmental
impact studies for new projects to give them more legitimacy,
President  Ollanta Humala  said.  Peru’s economy will expand 6 percent this year even amid
social conflicts, Humala said today at a press conference in
 Lima . Project reviews were previously carried out by the Energy
& Mines Ministry.  “This is something new and important because environmental
policy is a main concern of this government,” Humala said.
“This will provide greater credibility and legitimacy for
environmental impact studies.”  Peru’s mining industry, the world’s third-largest copper
and zinc producer, will invest $4 billion next year, 33 percent
less than previously expected, as social unrest delays projects,
according to the country’s National Society of Mining, Petroleum
& Energy. Companies including  Newmont Mining Corp. (NEM) ,  Southern
Copper Corp. (SCCO) , Zijin Mining Group Co. Ltd. and  Bear Creek Mining
Corp. (BCM)  postponed projects over the past year following
environmental protests.  To contact the reporter on this story:
