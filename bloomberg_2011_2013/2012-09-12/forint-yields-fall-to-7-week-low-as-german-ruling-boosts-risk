Hungary ’s government bond yields
fell to the lowest in seven weeks after  Germany ’s top
constitutional court allowed the country to ratify a euro-area
bailout fund with certain conditions.  A second day of gains in 10-year bonds cut the yield eight
basis points, or 0.08 percentage point, to 7.304 percent.
Hungary’s cost to insure debt for five years with credit default
swaps fell two basis points to 381, the lowest in a year on a
closing basis, by 4:11 p.m. in Budapest.  Demand for riskier assets in  Europe  increased after the
Federal Constitutional Court today dismissed motions filed by
groups including a conservative lawmaker and an opposition
political party that sought to block the fund, known as the
European Stability Mechanism, and a deficit-control treaty
championed by  Chancellor Angela Merkel .  The verdict on “the ESM treaty by the German
constitutional court has had a positive effect on risk
appetite,” Ilan Solot, a London-based strategist at Brown
Brothers Harriman, and colleagues wrote in a research report
today.  The currency of Hungary, the most indebted eastern member
of the European Union, depreciated 0.4 percent to 283.85 per
euro, after gaining 1.7 percent in the three previous trading
sessions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
