MGIC Investment Corp. (MTG) , the mortgage
insurer that breached regulators’ capital limits, plunged after
saying it would defer an interest payment on convertible debt
for 10 years.  MGIC slid 8.3 percent to $1.60 at 10:30 a.m. in  New York 
and has declined 57 percent this year. The insurer will postpone
an interest payment on $389.5 million of 9 percent convertible
debt until 2022, Milwaukee-based MGIC said yesterday in a
regulatory filing.  MGIC is guarding funds after eight straight losses on costs
tied to soured home loans pushed the firm’s ratio of risk
relative to capital above limits set by some state regulators.
Falling capital levels could impair the firm’s ability to sell
new policies that protect lenders when mortgage borrowers
default and foreclosures fail to recoup costs.  “They’re doing whatever they can to try to preserve
liquidity and capital,” said  Rob Haines , an analyst at
CreditSights Inc. in New York. “The company is in a very
difficult situation right now.”  MGIC’s debt has advanced this year as the housing market
has shown signs of improvement. Its $100 million of 5.375
percent senior unsecured bonds due in 2015 have climbed to 74
cents on the dollar from 68 cents at the end of 2011, according
to Trace, the bond price reporting system of the Financial
Industry Regulatory Authority.  To contact the reporter on this story:
