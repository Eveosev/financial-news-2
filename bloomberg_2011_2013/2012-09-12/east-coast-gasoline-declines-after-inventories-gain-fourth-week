Gasoline on the East Coast weakened
the most in six months with the approach of a seasonal grade
change and after inventories rose for a fourth week.  Stocks of gasoline made to  East Coast  specifications
increased 206,000 barrels in the region to 16 million last week,
the highest level since July 20, the Energy Department said
today. Total gasoline supplies on the East Coast increased
229,000 barrels to 50.1 million. This week winter-blend gasoline
will be available for sale at terminals in the region.  “Prices are falling substantially” as the market switches
to a winter grade of gasoline that refineries can make for much
less than the cost of summer blends, said  Andy Lipow , president
of Lipow Oil Associates LLC in Houston.  The premium for reformulated, 87-octane gasoline, or RBOB,
in  New York  Harbor dropped 16.5 cents to 24 cents a gallon
versus futures traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at
1:57 p.m., according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Prompt
delivery fell 20.34 cents to $3.2451 a gallon.  Fuel used in warmer weather must have a lower Reid vapor
pressure, or RVP, a measure of volatility expressed in pounds
per square inch, or psi.  Gasoline rose in northwest  Europe , reducing the incentive
to ship the fuel, as prices for immediate loading in Amsterdam-
Rotterdam-Antwerp traded from $1,151 to $1,157 a ton, according
to a survey of brokers and traders monitoring the Argus Bulletin
Board. That compares with $1,143 to $1,146 yesterday. Gasoline
imports to the East Coast declined 243,000 barrels to 699,000
barrels last week, government data showed.  The premium for RBOB in the  Gulf Coast  slipped 3.25 cents
to 7.75 cents a gallon, the lowest level since Aug. 23. Total
gasoline inventories in the Gulf Coast fell 1.39 million barrels
to 65.1 million barrels.  Marathon Petroleum Corp. (MPC)  released hydrogen sulfide at its
refinery in Garyville,  Louisiana , because of a leaky flange on a
coker unit, according to a filing with the National Response
Center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
