Burberry Group Plc (BRBY)  Chief Executive
Officer Angela Ahrendts was one of eight members of the U.K.
luxury-goods company’s board to increase their stakes after
yesterday’s record plunge in the shares.  Ahrendts acquired 50,000 shares at 1,086 pence apiece,
representing an outlay of 543,000 pounds ($873,470), the London-
based company said today in a statement. In total, the Burberry
directors spent about 1.1 million pounds buying stock.  Burberry, the U.K.’s largest luxury-goods company, said
yesterday that full-year  profit  will disappoint investors after
same-store revenue stalled in the last 10 weeks, sending the
shares down the most since the company’s 2002 initial public
offering and erasing 1.27 billion pounds from its market value.  The  shares  fell a further 1.8 percent, to 1,069 pence at
2:11 p.m. in London trading today. A close at that price would
be the lowest since Jan. 25, 2011.  Chief Financial Officer Stacey Cartwright was among the
directors that bought shares, snapping up 5,000 at 1,100 pence
each.  To contact the reporter on this story:
