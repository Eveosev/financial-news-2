Germany ’s highest court repudiated
Italy’s push to grant the permanent euro-area rescue fund a
banking license, saying it would violate the European Union’s
basic law.  In upholding the 500 billion-euro ($646 billion) European
Stability Mechanism, Germany’s Federal Constitutional Court in
Karlsruhe today  disputed  the fund’s ability to borrow from the
central bank, a move advocated by Italian Prime Minister  Mario Monti .  “Borrowing by the ESM from the  European Central Bank ,
alone or in connection with the depositing of government bonds,
would be incompatible with the prohibition of monetary financing
entrenched” in EU treaties, the court said. It “can only be
taken to mean that it does not permit such borrowing
operations.”  That finding marked a victory for German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  and her allies in Finland and the Netherlands, who have
opposed allowing the ESM to expand its power by tapping central
bank funds. Merkel and Monti clashed at a joint press conference
on Aug. 29 over the matter.  “Some things that aren’t possible today under current
conditions could become possible tomorrow,” Monti said to
reporters after Merkel, at his side, ruled out a banking license
for the ESM. “If there isn’t consensus for a certain
instrument, alternative instruments can be found.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
