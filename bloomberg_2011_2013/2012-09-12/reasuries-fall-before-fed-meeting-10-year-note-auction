Treasuries fell, pushing 10-year
note yields to a three-week high as the U.S. prepares to sell
$21 billion of the debt and the  Federal Reserve  begins a two-day
meeting amid bets it will add monetary stimulus.  Thirty-year bond yields  rose for a second day as a gauge of
 inflation expectations  in the U.S. reached the highest level
since March.  Germany ’s top constitutional court backed the
ratification of  Europe ’s permanent bailout fund, damping demand
for the safest assets. The U.S. 10-year note sale is the second
of three note and bond auctions this week totaling $66 billion.  “You’re getting concessions for the auctions and a risk-on
flavor out of Europe,” said  Sean Murphy , a trader at Societe
Generale SA in  New York , one of the 21 primary dealers that are
obligated to bid in U.S. debt sales. “It pressures Treasuries,
and now you have to take down supply ahead of expectations of
further stimulus from the Fed.”  The benchmark 10-year yield climbed four basis points, or
0.04 percentage point, to 1.74 percent at 11:48 a.m. in New
York, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. It touched 1.76
percent, the highest level since Aug. 22. The price of the 1.625
percent note due in August 2022 dropped 3/8, or $3.75 per $1,000
face amount, to 98 30/32.  The 30-year yield advanced five basis points to 2.91
percent after climbing five basis points yesterday.  Inflation Bets  The  difference  between yields on 10-year notes and similar-
maturity Treasury Inflation Protected Securities, a gauge of
traders’ outlook for consumer prices, reached 2.41 percentage
points, the widest since March 21. The average over the past
decade is 2.16 percentage points.  Investors in U.S. government securities have earned 2
percent in 2012 as of yesterday, according to Bank of America
Merrill Lynch indexes. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index has
gained 16 percent, including reinvested dividends.  There’s a “high probability” the Fed will say tomorrow
it’s extending its zero-interest-rate policy into 2015,
according to Pacific Investment Management Co.’s Mohamed El- Erian. Policy makers have kept their  benchmark rate  at zero to
0.25 percent since 2008. A third round of bond purchases under
quantitative easing is possible, he said.  “We suspect that the most likely outcome will be a change
in the forward guidance language to go well into 2015,” El-
Erian, the chief executive officer of the world’s largest
manager of bond funds, said in a “Bloomberg Surveillance”
radio interview with  Tom Keene  and Ken Prewitt. A “high
possibility is you may get QE3, either now or by December.”  The Fed is unlikely to cut the interest rate it pays banks
on reserves, intended to spur lending, or to target growth in
gross domestic product, El-Erian said.  Bloomberg Survey  Almost two-thirds of economists in a Bloomberg survey
projected the central bank will announce a third round of
quantitative-easing tomorrow, while also extending into 2015 its
pledge to keep  interest rates  at virtually zero.  Policy makers will probably announce an open-ended plan
tied to a sustained improvement in the economy rather than
specify an amount of purchases and an end-date, according to 32
of the 73 economists in the survey. Twenty-two expect a fixed
duration and amount.  Two rounds of Fed bond purchases totaling $2.3 trillion
have failed to breathe life into the labor market, which
Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said last month is a “grave concern.”
Unemployment has been stuck above 8 percent for 43 straight
months, while the  U.S. economy  grew less than 2 percent in the
second quarter.  Fed Sale  The central bank is also in the process of swapping
shorter-term Treasuries in its holdings with those due in six to
30 years to put downward pressure on long-term borrowing costs.
It sold $7.8 billion of securities today maturing from April
2014 to November 2014 as part of the program.  The 10-year notes the Treasury is auctioning today yielded
1.75 percent in pre-sale trading, compared with 1.68 percent at
the last auction, on Aug. 8. The record offering low of 1.459
percent was set in July. Investors  bid  for 2.49 times the amount
of the securities sold last month, the least in three years.  Indirect bidders, a class of investors that includes
foreign central banks, bought 40.6 percent of the notes at the
August offering, compared with an average of 42 percent for the
past 10 auctions.  A sale yesterday of $32 billion in three-year notes drew
 bids  for 3.94 times the securities available, the most on
record. The Treasury will auction $13 billion of 30-year bonds
tomorrow.  German Court  German 10-year bund yields touched 1.65 percent today, the
highest level since June 29, as demand for refuge faded.  “Treasuries are being dragged lower with bunds after the
court verdict as safe assets are suffering across the board,”
said  Michael Leister , a fixed-income strategist at Commerzbank
AG in  London .  The German Federal Constitutional Court stipulated that a
cap of about 190 billion euros ($246 billion) be placed on the
country’s liabilities before the European Stability Mechanism is
ratified, unless parliament decides to back extra funds.  The court dismissed motions filed by groups seeking to
block the fund, ending legal challenges that delayed efforts by
euro-area leaders to contain the debt crisis.  To contact the reporter on this story:
