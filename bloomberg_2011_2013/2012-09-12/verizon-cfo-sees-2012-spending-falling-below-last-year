(Corrects percentage drop in third paragraph of story that
ran on Sept. 12.)  Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ)  Chief
Financial Officer Fran Shammo said its capital spending will
decline this year, putting the carrier at the lower end of its
previous prediction.  “I think we’ll be slightly down from a year ago,” Shammo
said today at a Bank of America investment conference in Beverly
Hills, California. Verizon, based in New York, had originally
projected that 2012 spending would be little changed or slightly
lower than the $16.2 billion level in 2011.  Due to a tighter budget, Verizon had only spent $7.43
billion in the first half of 2012 -- 17 percent below the $8.9
billion spending pace of the year-earlier period. That means the
full year forecast will probably be at the bottom of the
company’s guidance range, Shammo said, signaling that Verizon
won’t embark on a spending spree in the second half.  Verizon’s  capital spending , which pays for a range of
equipment and infrastructure, is closely watched by suppliers
such as  Ciena Corp. (CIEN) ,  Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO) ,  Alcatel-Lucent SA (ALU)  and
Tellabs Inc.  Verizon rose 1.5 percent to $44.89 at the close in New
York. The shares have climbed 12 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
