Banks in  Finland  need to boost
liquidity and focus on adding long-term financing to comply with
Basel III regulations, the  Financial Supervisory Authority  said.  “Finnish banks need to considerably build up their liquid
funds and increase the share of long-term funding,” the
Helsinki-based regulator said in a report today, citing impact
assessments. Finnish banks comply with minimum solvency
standards and have the required core capital, the FSA said.  Basel III global regulations aim to improve banks’ quality
of capital by 2015 and ensure lenders hold adequate buffers to
counter losses. Banks must also make sure they don’t rely solely
on short-term capital. Some details of the banking regulations
remain open, the FSA said.  Finnish banks’ core Tier 1 capital was 13.9 percent, on
average, at the end of June and the country’s financial industry
remained “solvent and operational,” the regulator said. Low
 interest rates  are weighing on the profitability of banks, with
the smallest lenders particularly affected, the agency said.
Slowing economic growth may increase loan losses in Finland, it
said.  Europe ’s debt crisis is still the main risk to the region’s
financial industry, which remains “very vulnerable,” the
regulator said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
