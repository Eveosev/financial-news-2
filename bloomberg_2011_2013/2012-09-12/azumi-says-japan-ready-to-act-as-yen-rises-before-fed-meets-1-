Japan Finance Minister  Jun Azumi 
said moves in the yen since yesterday were speculative and the
government is ready to act against unacceptable changes in the
currency’s value.  “The yen’s move from yesterday has been clearly
speculative, and we won’t accept such moves,” Azumi told
reporters in  Tokyo  after the yen gained 0.7 percent yesterday
and as the U.S. Federal Reserve prepared for a policy meeting.
“We will definitely take bold actions if needed.”  His comments failed to weaken the currency, which traded at
77.83 per dollar at 5:25 p.m. in Tokyo.  A strengthening currency adds to challenges for a Japanese
economy struggling to maintain momentum as incentives for car
purchases fade and weakness in the global economy limits
exports. The yen has climbed more than 7 percent against the
dollar since mid-March and any further monetary loosening in the
U.S. has the potential to fuel further gains.  Azumi was asked for his view on the yen trading at stronger
than 78 per dollar and the pending decision of the  Federal Open
Market Committee .  To contact the reporter on this story:
