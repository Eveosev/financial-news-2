Mexichem SAB’s sale of $750 million
of 10-year dollar bonds lured $13.2 billion in investor bids,
according to a person familiar with the matter.  Demand for its offering of $400 million in 30-year notes
was $4.3 billion, said the person, who asked not to be named
because he’s not authorized to speak publicly.  To contact the reporter on this story:
