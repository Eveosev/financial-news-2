Corn output in the U.S., the
world’s largest grower, will fall by less than analysts expected
after the worst drought in more than 50 years, the government
said. Prices fell to a seven-week low.  Farmers will collect 10.727 billion bushels, the smallest
crop in six years and down 13 percent from 12.358 billion in
2011, the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  said today in its
second survey-based  estimate  for the crop. Last month, the USDA
forecast 10.779 billion. The average prediction of 35 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg was for 10.420 billion. Supplies of the
grain on Aug. 31, 2013, will be greater than analyst estimates.  Crop  conditions  as of Sept. 9 were the worst since 1988,
with the harvest about 15 percent complete, USDA data show.
Since mid-June, prices have surged 52 percent, reaching a record
$8.49 a bushel on Aug. 10. Futures for December delivery fell
1.1 percent to close at $7.695 at 2 p.m. on the  Chicago  Board of
Trade, after touching $7.5925, the lowest for a most-active
contract since July 24.  The larger-than-expected estimate is “a psychological blow
to the market,” Randy Mittelstaedt, the director of research
for R.J. O’Brien & Associates in Chicago, said before the
report. “It’s still a small crop, and that means the market
cannot afford to drop prices, or that will stimulate increased
demand.”  Tight Supplies  Smaller supplies of corn may increase costs for ethanol
refiners such as  Archer Daniels Midland Co. (ADM)  and  Valero Energy
Corp. (VLO)  and meat producers  Tyson Foods Inc. (TSN)  and  Smithfield Foods
Inc. (SFD) , which buy the grain for feed. Reduced production also may
boost demand for fertilizer from  CF Industries Holdings Inc. (CF) ,
Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan Inc. and  Agrium Inc. (AGU)   Unsold  supplies  of U.S. corn on Aug. 31, 2013, before next
year’s harvest, will total 733 million bushels, compared with
650 million forecast in August and 1.181 billion estimated this
year, largely because of larger-than-expected supplies of last
year’s crop, the USDA said. Traders surveyed by Bloomberg
expected reserves to fall to 596 million bushels, on average.  Feed use of last year’s crop will be 4.4 billion bushels,
down 150 million from last month’s estimate, because of this
year’s early harvest, which is making more grain available
earlier and leaving more of the 2011 harvest in storage as the
new marketing year begins, the USDA said. The department also
lowered its forecast for exports in the current year by 50
million bushels to 1.25 billion.  Drought Damage  Combined Midwest temperatures and precipitation during June
and July were the hottest and driest since 1936, according to
Joel Widenor, a vice president for Commodity  Weather Group LLC
in Bethesda,  Maryland . About 52 percent of the corn fields in
the U.S. were in poor or very poor condition as of Sept. 9, the
worst for the date since 1988 when production fell 31 percent
from a year earlier, government data show.  Yields will average 122.8 bushels per acre, down from 123.4
estimated in August and less than 147.2 bushels last year, the
USDA said. That would be the lowest since 1995. About 87.361
million acres will be harvested, unchanged from August and
83.981 million a year earlier.  The USDA said the average cash price for corn in the
marketing year that began Sept. 1 will be $7.90 a bushel,
compared with $8.20 estimated a month ago and $6.25 last year.
World output in the crop year that begins Oct. 1 will be 841.06
million tons, down from 849.01 million forecast a month ago and
from 876.68 million this year, the USDA said.  Global  consumption  is forecast to fall for the first time
since 1996 to 856.7 million tons, from 861.64 million tons
projected in August and 864.66 million this year, according to
the department.  Worldwide  inventories  at the end of the next marketing year
will be 123.95 million tons, down from 123.33 million predicted
last month and the 139.6 million estimated for this year, the
USDA said. Traders expected 120.62 million tons, on average.  To contact the reporter on this story:
