Alaska Governor Sean Parnell joined
some oil industry officials in criticizing proposed rules issued
by the U.S. Interior Department governing drilling in the
National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska.  Parnell  said  yesterday the new rules effectively withdraw
millions of acres from potential drilling, and said the state
would withdraw from an memorandum of understanding concerning
the reserve.  The Interior Department said on Aug. 13 that wells will be
allowed on 11.8 million acres that hold about 549 million
barrels of oil, while coastal areas such as Peard Bay and
Kasegaluk Lagoon, where seals and polar bears live, will get
“special protection,” according to the statement from the
agency.  The American Petroleum Institute trade group said the
proposal “falls short of where we need to be.”  Parnell said the state’s recommendations were not
incorporated into the proposed rules and asked the department to
start over.  Spokesmen for the Interior Department didn’t respond
immediately to a request for comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
