Brazil will extend a payroll tax
cut to about 10 new industries, including paper and pulp
producers as well as pharmaceutical companies, in a move that
will cost the government about 7 billion reais a year, a
government official familiar with the initiative said.  Finance Minister  Guido Mantega  plans to announce the
measure intended to help boost economic growth tomorrow, said
the official, who asked not to be named because he isnâ€™t
authorized to discuss the issue publicly. To compensate for part
of the loss in tax collection, the industries benefitted will
have to pay a levy on revenue.  The  Finance Ministry  declined to comment in an emailed
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
