European stocks  advanced to a 14-
month high after  Germany ’s top constitutional court cleared the
way for the ratification of the euro area’s permanent bailout
fund.  BAE Systems jumped the most in nine years after the company
began talks with European Aeronautic, Defence & Space Co., for a
possible combination.  Barratt Developments (BDEV)  Plc lost 6.4 percent
after the housebuilder said it won’t pay an annual dividend.  The  Stoxx Europe 600 Index (SXXP)  rose 0.1 percent to 272.91 in
 London , the highest close since July 8 last year. The Stoxx 600
has advanced 17 percent from its 2012 low on June 4, boosted by
speculation central banks will do more to stimulate growth.  “There were no nasty surprises to come out of the German
ratification, so the market got the outcome that it wanted,”
said  James Buckley , a London-based  fund manager  at Baring Asset
Management Ltd. which oversees about $49 billion. “There are
still various hurdles to be jumped, but in the near term, the
rotation that we are seeing into financials may still have
further to go,” he said in a phone interview.  The Stoxx 600 last week surged the most since June as
European Central Bank policy makers agreed to an unlimited bond-
buying plan to help lower borrowing costs in the region.  Bailout Fund  The Federal Constitutional Court in Karlsruhe today
dismissed motions filed by groups including an opposition
political party that sought to halt German ratification of the
500 billion-euro ($640 billion) fund, known as the European
Stability Mechanism, and a deficit-control treaty championed by
 Chancellor Angela Merkel .  The court stipulated that Germany set a cap of about 190
billion euros on its liabilities before ratifying the ESM,
unless parliament decides to back extra funds.  BAE jumped 10.6 percent to 363.6 pence, the biggest
increase since January 2003. The company said it’s in talks
with EADS, the parent of Airbus SAS, about a combination that
would create a European counterweight to U.S. companies
including Boeing Co.  BAE would own 40 percent of the merged entity, with EADS
owning the rest, the London-based company said in a
statement responding to a Bloomberg News report that the
companies are in talks.  EADS fell 3.9 percent to 28.50 euros, after rising as much
as 2.9 percent.  Bank Shares  Commerzbank, Germany’s second-largest lender, rallied 7.2
percent to 1.58 euros as a gauge of European banks added 1.3
percent, the biggest advance among the  19 industry groups  on the
Stoxx 600.  France ’s Natixis SA jumped 5.2 percent to 2.62 euros,
while  Credit Agricole SA (ACA)  advanced 5.8 percent to 5.89 euros.  Insurance companies  also paced gains in  Europe . ING, the
largest Dutch financial-services firm, rose 2 percent to 6.80
euros.  AXA SA (CS)  climbed 2 percent to 12.78 euros and  Allianz SE (ALV) ,
Europe’s largest insurer, added 1.1 percent to 95 euros.  Investors also awaited the outcome of the Fed’s two-day
policy meeting tomorrow amid expectations that the central bank
will announce a third round of so-called quantitative easing to
help support growth, according to almost two-thirds of
economists in a Bloomberg survey.  “Again the market is anticipating more QE from the Fed and
you can see that in the move from the  U.S. dollar . There is
potential for some short-term disappointment.”  National benchmark indexes rose in 13 of the 18 western
European markets. France’s CAC 40 advanced 0.2 percent,
 Germany’s DAX Index (DAX)  rallied 0.5 percent, while the U.K.’s FTSE
100 lost 0.2 percent.  Vestas Slips  Vestas (VWS)  dropped 8.9 percent 39.90 kroner, extending
yesterday’s 6.1 percent decline. Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.
downgraded the company to underperform, the equivalent of a sell
rating, from market-perform.  Martin Prozesky, a London-based Bernstein analyst, also cut
his price estimate for the shares by 23 percent to 20 kroner,
saying the world’s largest wind-turbine marker is running out of
cash.  Barratt Developments lost 6.4 percent to 158.8 pence after
the U.K.’s largest housebuilder by volume refrained from paying
a dividend. The company was expected to pay investors 0.7 pence
a share, according to Bloomberg Dividend Forecasts that account
for earnings and options prices. Barratt last paid a dividend in
2008.  The shares fell even after the company posted its first
full-year profit since 2008 of 67.4 million pounds ($109
million) compared with a loss of 13.8 million pounds a year
earlier. The shares have surged 71 percent so far this year.  Lonmin Strike  Lonmin Plc (LMI)  dropped 5.9 percent to 575 pence after the
mining company’s workers refused to return to their jobs and
begin wage talks. A strike entered its second month at Lonmin’s
Marikana operation, which accounts for about 10 percent of
global platinum production.  Novo Nordisk A/S (NOVOB)  declined 3.2 percent to 896 kroner as
 Natixis (KN)  SA reduced its recommendation for the world’s largest
insulin maker to neutral from buy.  The volume of shares changing hands on the Stoxx 600 was 65
percent higher than the average of the last 30 days, data
compiled by Bloomberg showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
