AU Optronics Corp. (2409) , Taiwan’s
second-largest maker of liquid-crystal displays used in big and
little video screens, should be fined $1 billion for price
fixing, federal antitrust authorities said in court papers.  U.S. attorneys prosecuting the criminal case in San
Francisco also recommended yesterday that AUO Vice Chairman H.B.
Chen and former Executive Vice President Hui Hsiung pay
$1 million in fines and serve 10 years in jail.  “Only these sentences could possibly reflect the
seriousness of this offense or provide adequate deterrence,”
and they’re “lenient,” regional Assistant Chief U.S. Attorney
Peter K. Huston wrote.  The government charged AUO in 2009, and a jury in March
found the company and two executives guilty of colluding with
rivals to fix prices though secret meetings in hotel rooms,
karaoke bars and tea rooms.  AUO Officials weren’t immediately available after business
hours in Hsinchu, Taiwan, to comment on the recommendations.  The case is U.S. v. Lin, 3:09-cr-00110, U.S. District
Court, Northern District of  California  ( San Francisco ).  To contact the reporter on this story:
