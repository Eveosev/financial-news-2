A restructuring plan by Investment
Dar Co., the Kuwait-based owner of half of Aston Martin Lagonda
Ltd., could collapse because of a court case challenging a law
by which the company is reorganizing debt,  Al-Qabas  reported,
without saying where it got the information.  Investment Dar last year altered the terms on about $5
billion of loans after defaulting in 2009. The restructuring is
being implemented under  Kuwait ’s Financial Stability Law, which
was enacted by the government in April 2009 to bolster financial
institutions hurt by the credit crisis.  A spokesman for Investment Dar couldn’t immediately be
reached for comment when contacted by  Bloomberg News  today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
