Zimbabwe probably won’t consider
lifting an export ban on chrome so domestic producers are
encouraged to process the metal locally, Mines Minister  Obert Mpofu  said.  The southern African nation stopped shipments of chrome in
April 2011 to boost domestic processing capacity. In May, Mpofu
said the country may consider lifting the restriction.  “I don’t think we will even consider lifting the ban on
chrome exports,” he told a mining conference in Harare today.
“We can only encourage development of refineries and smelters
here. It is not a good strategy to allow raw exports of
anything.”  The southern African country, along with  South Africa ,
holds about 90 percent of the world’s chromite reserves and
resources, according to the  U.S. Geological Survey . Zimbabwe has
three large-scale ferrochrome miners, including Zimbabwe Alloys
and Zimasco, owned by China’s Sinosteel Corp. The country
already has three smelters that can process 1.5 million metric
tons of chrome annually, according to the Mines Ministry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
