Michael Schlager, former vice
president of Equipment Finance LLC, was sentenced to 20 years in
prison for his role in a $53 million fraud at the Sterling
Financial Corp. unit, U.S. prosecutors said.  A federal judge in Philadelphia today also ordered Schlager
to pay the total fraud amount in restitution, according to
prosecutors. Joseph Braas, Equipment Finance’s former chief
operating officer, was sentenced to 15 years in prison for his
role in the scheme, prosecutors said yesterday.  Schlager and Braas led a conspiracy that lasted from 2001
through 2007, according to a statement from the office of Zane Memeger, the U.S. attorney in Philadelphia. The men hid losses
and defaults in the unit’s commercial loan portfolio by creating
fictitious loans and falsifying records, prosecutors said.  Discovery of the plot led Sterling to restate financial
results from 2004 to 2006. The company sold itself to  PNC
Financial Services Group Inc. (PNC)  in April 2008.  The case is U.S. v. Braas, 10-753, U.S. District Court,
Eastern District of  Pennsylvania  (Philadelphia).  To contact the reporter on this story:
