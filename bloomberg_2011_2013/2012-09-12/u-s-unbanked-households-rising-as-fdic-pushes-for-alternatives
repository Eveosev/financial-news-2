U.S. families without bank accounts
grew by 821,000 from 2009 to 2011, pushing the so-called
unbanked population to 8.2 percent of the nation’s households,
according to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.  About 17 million adults manage their finances without
checking or  savings accounts  at insured institutions, many of
them relying instead on non-bank services such as payday lenders
and check-cashing firms, the FDIC said in the National Survey of
Unbanked and Underbanked Households released today. The agency
released  the report  in conjunction with a conference to explore
ways banks could profit by serving this population.  “Insured financial institutions have an important chance
to grow their customer base by expanding opportunities that
bring unbanked and underbanked individuals into mainstream
banking,” Martin J. Gruenberg, the FDIC’s acting chairman, said
in an e-mailed statement.  The FDIC and consumer advocates have sought to shed light
on the unbanked -- those without bank accounts -- and
underbanked -- those who rely on alternative services even
though they have bank accounts -- as a first step toward
promoting use of insured lenders instead of non-bank products,
which can have high fees and  interest rates .  The study, conducted in 2011, revealed that 8.2 percent of
U.S. households, 1 in 12, are unbanked. That is up 0.6
percentage points from the first study, conducted in 2009.  One in five households, or 20.1 percent, were underbanked
in 2011. The underbanked rate is higher than the 2009 rate of
18.2 percent but the FDIC cautioned that the survey methodology
was slightly different in the two studies.  Unbanked households vary significantly by ethnicity,
according to the 2011 report. Black households were 21.4 percent
unbanked, and Hispanics registered a 20.1 percent rate, while
American Indians were at 14.5 percent. White and Asian
households were at 4 percent and 2.7 percent, respectively.  To contact the reporter on this story:
