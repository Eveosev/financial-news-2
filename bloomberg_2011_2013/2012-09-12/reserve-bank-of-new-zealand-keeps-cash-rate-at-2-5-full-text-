The following is a reformatted
version of a statement released today by the  Reserve Bank  of  New
Zealand  announcing that Governor Alan Bollard, after a meeting
today in Wellington, held the benchmark  interest rate  at a
record-low 2.5 percent.  “The Reserve Bank today left the Official Cash Rate (OCR)
unchanged at 2.5 percent.  Reserve Bank Governor Alan Bollard said: “New Zealand’s economic
outlook remains broadly consistent with that described in the
June Monetary Policy Statement.  “New Zealand’s trading partner outlook remains weak. Several
euro-area economies are in recession and Chinese growth has
slowed. The risk of significant deterioration in the euro area
persists.  “Domestically, the Bank continues to expect economic activity to
grow modestly over the next few years. Housing market activity
continues to increase as forecast, and repairs and
reconstruction in Canterbury are expected to further boost the
construction sector. Offsetting this, fiscal consolidation is
constraining demand growth, and the high  New Zealand dollar 
continues to undermine export earnings and encourage
substitution toward imported goods and services.  “Underlying annual inflation, which recently moved below 2
percent, is expected to settle near the mid-point of the target
range over the medium term.  “It remains appropriate for the OCR to be held at 2.5 percent.”  View the Monetary Policy Statement page
