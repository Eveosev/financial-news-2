Kazakhstan plans to ship 10 million
metric tons of grain this marketing year after exporting a
record 12.7 million tons from Sept. 1, 2011 to Aug. 31, 2012,
the  Agriculture Ministry  said.  Kazakhstan has about 9 million tons of stock left from last
year, according to government data. The country shipped 77,700
tons of grain in the first 10 days of this month, the ministry
said in an e-mailed statement today.  “We have a potential to export more than 10 million tons
of grain, but only needed grain will be bought this season,
nobody will buy for reserves, like some Arabic countries did
last year,” Agriculture Minister Asylzhan Mamytbekov said
yesterday in the capital Astana. On average, the country’s
shipping capacity is about 6 million tons,  he said.  Kazakhstan may gather about 13 million tons of grain this
season, compared with a record 26.9 million tons in 2011,
according to government data.  Kazakhstan harvested 11.3 million hectares (27.9 million
acres), or 73 percent of the area planted with grains, as of
yesterday, according to a statement published on the Agriculture
Ministry’s website. That compares with 50 percent of the area
harvested at the same time in 2011. Farmers started reaping in
July this year, earlier than usual.  “The speed of harvest is higher than last year as
everything ripened earlier,” Yevgeny Aman, the ministry’s
executive secretary, said yesterday.  Grain Milling  The country milled 9.1 million tons of grain as of Sept.
11, compared with 12.3 million tons in the same period last
year, according to ministry data.  The average yield of 810 kilograms (0.81 tons) a hectare
declined this year as dry weather damaged crops. It was 1,530
kilograms in 2011.  “The average yields will grow by the end of the harvest,
because there are going to be more productive fields at the end,
which weren’t touched as much by the drought,” Mamytbekov said
Sept. 4.  During the past week yields have improved in the main
growing regions. They have risen in Kostanay from 560 to 630
kilograms a hectare, in Akmola from 610 to 710 kilograms a
hectare, and in North Kazakhstan from 1,120 to 1,170 kilograms a
hectare, according to a Sept. 11 statement on the ministry’s
website.  “If the weather persists, the harvest will end in a
maximum of two weeks,” Aman said.  September is expected to be warm and arid with some rains
possibly in the northern and mountainous regions, according to
Kazhydromet, the national weather service.  To contact the reporter on this story:
