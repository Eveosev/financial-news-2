(Corrects description of badlar rate in fourth paragraph.)  YPF SA (YPFD) , Argentina’s biggest oil
producer, sold more bonds than it initially offered in its first
sale as a state-controlled company.  The company said in a statement that it sold 1.5 billion
pesos ($322 million) of debt after offering 1.35 billion pesos
in the local market. The results “exceeded management
expectations” and the cash is “fundamental to continue in our
ambitious investment plan,” according to the statement.  The sale included 100 million of fixed-rate bonds due in
270 days to yield 16.74 percent, 200 million pesos of bonds due
in 18 months to yield 3 percentage points above the badlar rate
and 1.2 billion pesos of 36-month securities at 4 percentage
points above the badlar rate.  The badlar, the rate banks pay for 30-day deposits of more
than 1 million pesos, was at 13.81 percent on Sept. 11,
according to the latest central bank data.  The Argentine government seized 51 percent of YPF from
 Spain ’s  Repsol SA (REP)  as it is seeking to halt declining oil output
and stem fuel imports that doubled to $9.4 billion last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
