England beat  South Africa  by 28
runs to tie their Twenty20 cricket series 1-1 in its final match
before defending its world championship in Sri Lanka.  Craig Kieswetter  hit 50 and Jos Buttler blasted 32 not out
off 10 balls as England made 118-5 from 11 overs in last night’s
rain-shortened match in Birmingham. South Africa, which won the
toss and fielded first, was restricted to 90-5 in reply.  Buttler, who’d scored 36 runs in 10 Twenty20 internationals
before last night, smashed three sixes and two fours off Wayne
Parnell in an over that went for 32 runs. It was the  second-most
expensive  over in Twenty20 international history.  “I swung hard and it came off,” Buttler, 22, said at the
post-match presentation ceremony. “International cricket hasn’t
gone quite as I’d hoped so far, so it’s nice to contribute to a
winning side. It’s good preparation for  Sri Lanka .”  Both teams will now head to the South Asian island for the
World Twenty20 tournament, which starts Sept. 18 with the host
nation taking on Zimbabwe.  South Africa, the No. 1 team in the  International Cricket
Council ’s  Twenty20 rankings , faces Zimbabwe two days later in
its opening match at the 12-nation event. England starts its
title defense Sept. 21 against Afghanistan.  India  is the 4-1 favorite to win the tournament ahead of
5-1 chances South Africa and Sri Lanka, according to U.K.
bookmaker William Hill. England is a 7-1 outsider, meaning a
successful $100 bet returns $800.  To contact the reporter on this story:
