Miners are blocking major roads
into Boliviaâ€™s administrative center La Paz in a conflict over
the Colquiri tin and zinc mine.  The miners, who work parts of the mine as a cooperative,
are protesting against calls by workers at the state mining
company Corp. Minera de Bolivia for the state to expand its
share and take over the whole mine.  To contact the reporter on this story:
