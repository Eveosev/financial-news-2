Irwin Lipkin, the former controller
for  Bernard Madoff ’s defunct investment firm, is expected to
plead guilty to charges of conspiracy and making false
statements, the U.S. said.  Lipkin is scheduled to enter a plea at a hearing in
Manhattan federal court tomorrow, prosecutors in the office of
U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara told a federal judge in a letter
yesterday.  He will be the ninth former Madoff employee to plead guilty
to criminal charges. His lawyer, David Richman, didn’t
immediately return a phone call seeking comment on the letter.  In June,  Peter Madoff  pleaded guilty to enabling his
brother to commit the biggest Ponzi scheme in U.S. history.
Bernard Madoff, who was arrested in December 2008, pleaded
guilty and is serving a 150-year sentence in federal prison in
 North Carolina .  The case is U.S. v. Madoff, 10-cr-00228, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
