Composer  Philip Glass  and artist Cai Guo-Qiang won the Praemium Imperiale, an international arts
prize patronized by Japan’s ruling dynasty, worth 15 million yen
($192,600).  The other three recipients were Danish architect Henning Larsen, Japanese ballerina Yoko Morishita, and Italian sculptor
Cecco Bonanotte, according to an e-mailed release sent today.  Glass -- who wrote “Einstein on the Beach,” and has
worked with Ravi Shankar,  David Bowie  and Brian Eno during his
career -- was deemed one of the most influential living
composers.  Cai, best known for making art with gunpowder, became the
prize’s first Chinese winner. His “Footprints in the Sky”
piece for the Beijing Olympics opening ceremony was cited.  Last year’s winners were artists Bill Viola and  Anish Kapoor , actress Judi Dench, conductor Seiji Ozawa and architect
Ricardo Legorreta. The prizes were inaugurated in 1989.  To contact the writer on the story:
