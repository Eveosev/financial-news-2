Former HBOS Plc executive Peter Cummings will be fined 500,000 pounds ($805,000) by the U.K.’s
Financial Services Authority following an investigation by the
regulator,  Sky News  reported.  HBOS posted a 7.5 billion-pound loss for 2008, as loans to
fund properties and takeovers soured at the corporate banking
unit led by Cummings, 57.  Cummings’s fine will be disclosed tomorrow, Sky said,
without saying where it got the information.  The FSA declined to comment. Cummings didn’t immediately
respond to a request for comment left at Home from Home
( Scotland ) Ltd., a charity where he is treasurer.  -- With assistance from Lindsay Fortado in London. Editors: Jon
