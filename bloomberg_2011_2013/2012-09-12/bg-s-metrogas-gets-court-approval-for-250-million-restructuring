BG Group Plc (BG/) ’s Argentine natural-
gas distribution unit  Metrogas SA (METR) , which filed for bankruptcy
protection in 2010, won court approval to proceed with its $250
million debt restructuring.  The plan, backed by creditors holding about 90 percent of
Metrogas’ debt, received authorization from federal judge
Cristina O’Reilly in Buenos Aires, the company said in a
regulatory filing today.  The deal, which includes swapping bonds for new debt
maturing in 2018, wasn’t challenged by any of the remaining 10
percent of creditors, according to court records.  BG controls Metrogas through a 55 percent stake in parent
holding company GASA.  YPF SA (YPFD)  owns 45 percent of GASA.  To contact the reporter on this story:
