(Corrects to 51 percent in headline, first paragraph.)  The board of OAO Alrosa,  Russia ’s
diamond mining monopoly, approved the sale of 51 percent of its
Timir iron-ore unit to  Evraz Plc (EVR) , the steelmaker part-owned by
billionaire Roman Abramovich.  The board also agreed to sell one share in the project to
VEB, Russia’s state-development bank, the diamond producer said
today in a regulatory filing. Alrosa will retain the right to
nominate Timir’s chief financial officer.  VEB will have the right of first refusal if Alrosa or Evraz
seek to sell their stakes, according to the filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
