Indian stocks rose to the highest
level in more than six months on speculation the central bank
will cut  interest rates  next week and as a German court cleared
the way for a permanent euro-area rescue fund.  The BSE India Sensitive Index, or Sensex, increased 0.8
percent to 18,000.03, the highest close since Feb. 23. The gauge
climbed 4 percent in past six days, the longest streak since
January.  Tata Motors Ltd. (TTMT) , the owner of Jaguar Land Rover,
surged the most in three months.  Wipro Ltd. (WPRO) , a software services
exporter that gets a quarter of its sales from Europe, climbed
to a two-month high.  Data today showed Indian industrial output grew 0.1 percent
in July, less than the 0.5 percent increase estimated by
economists in a Bloomberg survey. Germany’s Federal
Constitutional Court rejected today bids to halt the nation’s
ratification of the 500 billion-euro ($644 billion) European
Stability Mechanism.  Indian (SENSEX)  commerce ministry data show that the
European Union is the nation’s largest trading partner.  “The government may pressure the  Reserve Bank of India  to
reduce interest rates in view of the slump in production,” R.K. Gupta, managing director of Taurus Asset Management Ltd., which
has $672 million in assets, said by phone from  New Delhi  today.
“Allowing the euro-area rescue fund will be a step toward
easing the European debt problems. This will help improve
sentiments for Indian equities.”  Overseas Investors  The Sensex has climbed 16 percent this year, helped by the
highest foreign fund inflows among the 10 Asian markets outside
China tracked by Bloomberg. Overseas funds bought a net $131
million of shares yesterday, taking investments this year to
$12.6 billion, data from the markets regulator show. The Sensex
trades at 14.2 times  estimated earnings , compared with 11 times
for the  MSCI Emerging Markets Index. (MXEF)   The S&P CNX Nifty Index increased 0.8 percent to 5,431 and
its September futures settled at 5,452. The India VIX gauge,
which measures the cost of protection against losses in the
Nifty, lost 2.2 percent to 15.04. The  BSE-200 Index (BSE200)  climbed 0.6
percent to 2,185.19.  Indian stocks were also buoyed after China’s Premier Wen
Jiabao said yesterday the nation has “ample” room to use
fiscal and monetary policy to meet economic targets. Investors
are waiting to see if the U.S. Federal Reserve will announce a
third round of asset purchases at the end of a policy meeting
tomorrow. The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  climbed 1.3 percent today,
its fifth straight day of gains.  “India is going to be a beneficiary of increased global
risk appetite as markets around the world look to their central
banks to wave the magic wand,” Vijay Tohani, chief investment
officer at Samsung Asset Management Ltd. in Singapore, said by
phone today. The firm oversees about $82 billion of assets.  Interest-Rate Cut  Reserve Bank  of India Governor Duvvuri Subbarao is due to
announce his next interest-rate decision on Sept. 17. He left
the benchmark repurchase rate at 8 percent for a second meeting
in July, refraining from joining a wave of cuts in borrowing
costs stretching from  Asia  to Europe.  “The expectation is that there could be a 25 basis-point
rate cut” as economic growth is slowing down, Mahesh Patil, co-
chief investment officer at Birla Sun Life Asset Management Co.,
India’s fourth-biggest money manager, told Bloomberg TV India
today before the industrial output data. “But looking at where
inflation is, it might get a bit delayed also.”  Data on Sept. 14 may show inflation  accelerated  to 7.05
percent last month from 6.87 percent in July, according to the
median estimate in a Bloomberg economist survey.  India ’s gross
domestic product rose 5.5 percent in the three months through
June from a year earlier, close to a three-year low of 5.3
percent in the first quarter.  Plant Upgrade  National Stock Exchange of India Ltd. and BSE Ltd., India’s
top two bourses,  traded  715 million shares yesterday, 19 percent
less than the 12-month daily average of 881 million.  Tata Motors surged 5.4 percent, the most since June 15, to
263.25 rupees, the highest level since May 29. The company has
invested 370 million pounds ($595 million) to upgrade its Jaguar
Land Rover manufacturing plant in the U.K. Jaguar Land Rover
accounts for 64 percent of Tata Motors’s revenue.  Wipro added 2.6 percent to 384.55 rupees, its highest close
since July 9.  Tata Consultancy Services Ltd. (TCS) , which gets 90
percent of its sales from abroad, rose 1.6 percent to 1,414.9
rupees, its highest price since listing in August 2004.  Among materials producers,  Tata Steel Ltd. (TATA) , the biggest
producer of the alloy, increased 2.7 percent to 387.15 rupees.

alloy by value, jumped 3.9 percent to 346.65 rupees, rebounding
