Marsico Capital Management LLC, the
asset manager led by Thomas Marsico, reduced its debt by more
than half through a restructuring that cut management’s equity
ownership to less than 40 percent, said three people familiar
with the deal.  The agreement with creditors shrank Marsico’s senior debt
to about $500 million from $1 billion, and junior debt to about
$200 million from $600 million, said the people, who asked not
to be named because the process was private. Under the terms,
the debt now matures in 2022, and creditors are eligible for
distributions from management fees to service debt, they said.  This is the second time Marsico, which has about $31.2
billion under  management , has restructured since 2010. The
Denver, Colorado-based firm’s management will retain voting
control even though its equity stake is declining from 51
percent, two of the people said.  Marsico Chief Financial Officer Neil Gloude said via phone
that 100 percent of the senior and junior creditors agreed to
the restructuring, without detailing the terms.  Founded in 1997 by Marsico, the firm employed 65 people as
of July 31, including an 18-member investment team, according to
its website. Marsico restructured $2.7 billion debt in November
2010, persuading creditors to extinguish about $1.04 billion in
exchange for a 19 percent equity stake, according to a  statement 
at the time.  Marsico’s debt increased by $2.5 billion in 2007 as part of
the management-led buyout of the firm from Bank of America Corp.
In the current restructuring,  Houlihan Lokey  advised the junior
creditors, while Moelis & Co. advised Marsico, said the people.  Andrea Hurst , a spokeswoman for Moelis, declined to
comment, as did  John Gallagher , a spokesman for Houlihan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
