Barratt Developments Plc (BDEV) , the
U.K.’s largest homebuilder by volume, posted its first full-year
profit since 2008 as the company widened margins by building on
land acquired at discounted prices.  Net income was 67.4 million pounds ($108.3 million)
compared with a loss of 13.8 million pounds a year earlier, the
London-based company said in a statement today. Revenue
increased 14 percent to 2.32 billion pounds and the operating
margin widened to 8.2 percent from 6.6 percent.  “Despite continued uncertainty surrounding the wider U.K.
market and constrained levels of mortgage finance, we expect to
make further good progress in 2012/13 with more than half of our
completions forecast to be delivered from recently acquired
higher margin land,” Chief Executive Officer Mark Clare said in
the statement.  British homebuilders have increased revenue amid restrained
mortgage lending and little change in home values after focusing
on widening margins. The U.K. government has tried to bolster
the housing market by easing planning laws and reducing the down
payments needed by some first-time buyers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
