The ruble advanced for its longest
rally since January and the yield on the government’s ruble-
denominated Eurobonds fell to a record low on bets global
central bank stimulus will stoke appetite for risky assets.  The ruble climbed for a seventh day, rising 0.2 percent to
31.5100 per dollar at 7 p.m. in Moscow. Russia’s Eurobonds in
rubles due 2018 advanced for a fifth day, lowering the yield one
basis point to 5.93 percent, the lowest since the securities
were first sold in February last year.  Urals crude, Russia’s largest export earner, rose 0.7
percent to $113.12 a barrel as investors anticipate a third
round of bond purchases may be announced by the U.S. Federal
Reserve tomorrow.  “Everybody on the market seems to be waiting for
tomorrow’s” Fed move, Dmitry Polevoy, a Moscow-based economist
at ING Groep NV, said by e-mail.  The  Finance Ministry  sold 9.9 billion rubles ($316 million)
of 15-year  government bonds  at an auction today at the lowest
rate. The ministry sold 3.06 billion rubles of 2019 bonds in a
later offering of 20 billion rubles.  Demand for the longer-maturity notes demonstrates
investors’ “faith” in Russia’s budget policies, Finance
Minister Anton Siluanov told reporters in Moscow today. Russia
will continue to offer long-maturity notes if they stay in
demand, he said.  The currency was down 0.1 percent against the euro at
40.6016 and was little changed against the central bank’s target
euro-dollar basket. Non-deliverable forwards showed the ruble at
31.9295 per dollar in three months compared with 31.9585
yesterday.  The extra yield investors demand to own  Russia ’s dollar
bonds over U.S. Treasuries decreased five basis points to 193,
according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s EMBI Global Index. An index
of five-year government bond yields compiled by the Micex rose
eight basis points to 7.534 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
