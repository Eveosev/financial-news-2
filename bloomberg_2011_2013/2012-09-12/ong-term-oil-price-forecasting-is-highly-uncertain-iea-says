Forecasting  oil prices  beyond a
year is “highly uncertain” because of the need for more
transparent data from suppliers and consumers, according to the
 International Energy Agency   “Forecasts based on futures prices, surveys of analyst
forecasts, forecasts based on a variety of simple time series
regressions and other common forecasting techniques are
generally inferior to the random-walk forecast, which implies
that the best forecast of crude oil spot prices is simply the
current price of oil,” the Paris-based IEA said today in its
monthly Oil Market Report.  Recent advances in modeling and forecasting have improved
the accuracy of price predictions, with success relying on
timely and accurate data on oil markets, the IEA said.  The agency noted “an urgent and growing need” for better
information on oil production, consumption and inventories from
all nations, particularly from those outside of the Organization
for Economic Cooperation and Development.  To contact the reporter on this story:
