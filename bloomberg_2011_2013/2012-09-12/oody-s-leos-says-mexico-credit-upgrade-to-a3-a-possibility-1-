Mexico  may merit a credit-rating
upgrade should incoming President Enrique Pena Nieto’s proposals
to increase  tax revenue  and open the  energy industry  to more
private investment succeed, Moody’s Investors Service said.  Latin America’s second-largest economy could be raised to
an A3 rating, one level above its current Baa1,  Mauro Leos , a
credit officer for the region, said at a Moody’s conference in
Mexico City today.  Besides a labor bill, introduced by outgoing President
Felipe Calderon and set to receive a vote this year, the
economic overhauls have the best chance of passing in 2013, and
that’s when Moody’s would be most likely to raise the rating, Leos
said in an interview after his speech.  “Maybe the most important, because it’s already out there,
is the labor reform,” Leos said. The bill signals that “Mexico
can make progress in certain areas where little progress has
been observed before.”  Leos said that while Mexico currently belongs in a range of
Baa2 to A3, that range could shift up to include A1 should the
economic overhauls prove effective.  Moody’s last upgraded Mexico from Baa2 in January 2005. It
chose not to downgrade the nation when Fitch Ratings Ltd and
Standard & Poor’s lowered their ratings by one level each in
late 2009 on signs of declining oil output and after a tax
increase fell short of what President  Felipe Calderon  had
originally proposed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
