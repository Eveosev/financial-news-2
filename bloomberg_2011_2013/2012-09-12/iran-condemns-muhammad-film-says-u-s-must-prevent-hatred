Iran’s Foreign Ministry spokesman
 Ramin Mehmanparast  condemned a film about the  Prophet Muhammad ,
which has sparked protests in  Libya  and Egypt, and said the U.S.
must seek to stop the spread of hatred against Islam.  Iran “strongly condemns insults to sacred Muslim figures
and empathizes with the hurt feelings of the Muslim world,”
Mehmanparast said, according to the state-run  Mehr  news agency.  Mehmanparast criticized “the systematic silence of the
U.S. government in regards to such undertakings aimed at waging
a war against Islam,” and said that the U.S. “has a direct
moral responsibility to stop this dangerous spread of cultural
hatred and insults of sacred figures of Islam.”  The U.S. ambassador to Libya, Chris Stevens, and three
other personnel were killed in an attack on the consulate in the
eastern city of Benghazi amid protests in the north African
country and neighboring Egypt over the film “The Innocence of
Islam.” The  Associated Press  said the movie was made by an
Israeli living in California, and promoted by an Egyptian
Christian also based in the U.S. A clip was shown on YouTube.  The violence recalls the worldwide protests in 2005 after a
Danish newspaper published cartoons depicting Muhammad and
follows the revival of Islamist politics in both countries after
uprisings last year ousted longtime leaders.  To contact the reporter on this story:
