Australia ’s government said it
expects cigarette makers to try to skirt a branding ban due to
start Dec. 1, after  Imperial Tobacco Group Plc. (IMT)  released new
packs with the slogan “It’s what’s on the inside that counts.”  “We know that Big Tobacco will use every trick in the book
to try and get around the new requirements,” Tanya Plibersek,
health minister, said in an e-mailed statement. The ministry
will foil such efforts by monitoring packaging elements
including gloss and tone while poring over marks, she said.  Under the rules, cigarette packages won’t be allowed to
show company logos and will have to use a uniform font on an
olive-brown background, with graphic health warnings covering
most of the packets. Major retailers will receive the first
deliveries of new plain packages this week, she said, with the
manufacture of old-style packs banned from Oct. 1 and stores
barred from selling them after Dec. 1.  Imperial Tobacco ’s changes to its Peter Stuyvesant brand
packaging was intended to “provide factual information about
upcoming legislative changes,” Michelle Park, a Sydney-based
spokeswoman for the company, said by e-mail. “It is also
important to inform our adult consumers that the product itself
will remain unchanged.”  The Imperial Tobacco packaging was a “sick joke,”
Plibersek said. “Diseased lungs, hearts and arteries are the
reality of what is happening on the inside to a smoker.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
