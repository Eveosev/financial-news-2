It’s the mother-daughter pairing
from hell.  Tamsin Greig plays middle-aged Hilary in “Jumpy.” Once a
bold anti-nuclear campaigner, she now plays powerless parent to
teenage Tilly (Bel Powley), who describes her, thoughtfully, as
“mental-pausal.” Hilary’s evenings are spent reading out pages
of “Great Expectations” to her sweet but dull husband.  Tilly’s sex life sets off a funny chain of events. The
biggest hoot: Hilary’s single friend Frances (Doon Mackichan),
whose plumes-and-tassels burlesque number is, alone, worth the
ticket.  Acting is great, especially from bumbling Greig, and sets
look good. At the Duke of York’s Theatre through Nov. 3.

7627.  Saturday  Ever wonder what a skinned corpse looks like? Stop by
 Buckingham Palace  and find out.  The Queen’s Gallery displays 87 sheets of Leonardo Da Vinci’s anatomical sketches, the biggest number ever to go on
show.  There are bones, innards, muscles, and lungs. The sketches
are delicate and precise, except in one case -- “The
Hemisection of a Man and Woman in the Act of Coition” -- where
Leonardo lets his imagination loose and ends up being
anatomically incorrect.  “Leonardo Da Vinci: Anatomist” is at the Queen’s Gallery,
Buckingham Palace, through Oct. 7. Information:

night. French star David Guetta performs his electropop hits in
a double bill with  London ’s Calvin Harris, who revels in the
unlikely claim that he invented disco. Harris was born in 1984,
some time after the genre emerged, though he did enhance it with
tunes like “Dance Wiv Me” and “Ready for the Weekend.”  Roundhouse, Chalk Farm Road, NW1 8EH. Information: +44-844-
482-8008,  http://www.roundhouse.org.uk  or

1931. It’s still serving pizza and other simple Italian fare, as
well as the ice creams and sorbets it’s famous for. Information:

nine-date run at Sadler’s Wells. Sunday’s show features a
Christopher Wheeldon choreography (“Ghosts”) and a piece by
the company’s artistic director Helgi Tomasson (“Trio”), set
to Tchaikovsky’s “Souvenir de Florence.” Information:

filled with places to eat. For great coffee and unusual, fusion
dishes, Caravan is hard to beat. The casual, crowded bar-
restaurant is owned by New Zealanders, who have their own
roaster in the basement. Information:
