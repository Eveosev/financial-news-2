Banco  Santander (SAN)  SA’s deposits at
its Spanish business declined 6.3 percent in July and Banco
Popular Espanol SA’s fell 9.5 percent, highlighting funding
stresses facing lenders in the country.  Spanish deposits at Santander, Spain’s biggest bank, fell
to 152.9 billion euros ($197.3 billion) from 163.1 billion euros
in June, while  Popular’s (POP)  dropped to 73.8 billion euros from 81.5
billion euros, according to data  published  today by the Spanish
banking association, known as AEB.  Banco Bilbao (BBVA)  Vizcaya
Argentaria SA’s deposits fell 7.1 percent, AEB said.  Scrutiny is mounting on the reliability of the sources of
funding available to Spanish banks as the industry increasingly
relies on borrowings from the European Central Bank amid
Europe’s debt crisis. BBVA said in a Sept. 4 report that
deposits of Spanish  households and companies  remain broadly
stable, once the practice of Spanish banks seeking funding from
commercial paper is taken into account.  A Popular official, who asked not to be identified by name
in line with company policy, said its retail deposits had risen
in July from June and the declines seen in AEB’s data were
because of  repurchase agreements  and securitization funds
outflows.  A Santander official, who asked not to be named in line
with the bank’s policy, said the decline in July was partly due
to a drop in repos.  Paul Tobin , a spokesman for BBVA, said the
data for its balance sheet published by AEB was for its business
in Spain, Portugal and the wholesale business elsewhere in
Europe and in New York.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
