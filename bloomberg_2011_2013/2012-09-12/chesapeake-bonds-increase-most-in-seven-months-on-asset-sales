Bonds of  Chesapeake Energy Corp. (CHK) 
climbed the most in seven months after the energy producer
agreed to sell portions of oil and natural-gas fields and other
assets to narrow a cash-flow shortfall.  Chesapeake’s $1.3 billion of 9.5 percent debt due February
2015 rose 2.25 cents to 113.25 cents on the dollar to yield 3.7
percent as of 9:18 a.m. in New York, according to Trace, the
bond-price reporting system of the Financial Industry Regulatory
Authority. That’s the biggest increase since February and the
highest price since April, when the securities traded as high as
114.6 cents, Trace data show.  The company, based in Oklahoma City, agreed to sell
portions of fields in the Permian Basin of  Texas  and  New Mexico 
and other assets in a series of transactions for $6.9 billion.  Chesapeake, the second-largest U.S. natural-gas producer,
lost as much as 60 percent of its market value in the past year
as a glut-driven slump in gas prices squeezed the company’s cash
flow and forced Chief Executive Officer  Aubrey McClendon  to
accelerate the pace of asset sales. Investors also battered the
stock amid two federal probes of potential conflicts between the
CEO’s personal financial transactions and corporate duties.  To contact the reporter on this story:
