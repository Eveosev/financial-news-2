The sugar-cane harvest may be about
10 million metric tons higher than first forecast in the main
growing area of  Brazil , the world’s biggest producer, if dry
weather persists, according to UBS AG.  The output estimate for the 2012-13 season under way in the
center south region would be revised from 510 million tons, the
bank said in a report dated yesterday. Dryness allowed cane
processing to advance 14 percent to a record 46.5 million tons
in August’s second half, industry group Unica said yesterday.
Rains in May and June had delayed the crop.  “The welcome dry weather has enabled sugar crushers in
Brazil to accelerate the harvest and make up for lost ground,”
said  Wayne Gordon , a strategist at UBS in  New York . “The total
cane cut is still below a year ago, yet if current conditions
persist, we could see a final estimate in the vicinity of 10
million tons more than our initial forecast.”  Raw sugar, down 13 percent this year in New York trading,
may drop to 18 cents a pound in three months as Brazilian
exports gain momentum and concerns ease about a lack of rain in
 India , the second-biggest sweetener producer and largest
consumer, according to the report.  The monsoon, which brings more than 70 percent of the South
Asian country’s rainfall, is 9 percent below a 50-year average
since June 1, according to the  India Meteorological Department .  Raw sugar for March delivery rose 0.1 percent to 20.19
cents a pound by 9:35 a.m. London time on ICE Futures U.S. in
New York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
