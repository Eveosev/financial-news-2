European bank shares rose to the
highest level since March after Germany’s top constitutional
court cleared the way for ratification of the euro-area bailout
fund.  French lenders  Natixis (KN)  and  Credit Agricole (ACA)  SA led the
gains, both rising more than 5 percent. Italy’s  Banca Monte dei
Paschi di Siena SpA (BMPS)  climbed as much as 6.8 percent while
 Commerzbank AG (CBK)  added as much as 7.4 percent in Germany.  The  Bloomberg Europe Banks and Financial Services Index 
gained as much as 2 percent to 84.99, the highest intraday level
since March 28 and was up 1.3 percent as of 10:13 a.m. in
London. The 38-company index advanced for a sixth day after the
 European Central Bank  agreed to an unlimited bond-purchase plan
on Sept. 6, its longest winning streak since January.  The Federal Constitutional Court in Karlsruhe today
dismissed motions filed by groups including a conservative
lawmaker and an opposition political party that sought to block
the 500 billion-euro ($645 billion) fund, known as the European
Stability Mechanism, and a deficit-control treaty championed by
 Chancellor Angela Merkel .  The court stipulated that a cap of about 190 billion euros
be set on German liabilities before ESM ratification, unless
Parliament decides to back extra funds.  Natixis rallied 6.5 percent to 2.65 euros as of 11:14 a.m.
in Paris, while Credit Agricole gained 5.4 percent to 5.87
euros. Monte Paschi advanced 5.1 percent to 29 cents in Milan.
Commerzbank, Germany’s second-biggest bank, rose 3.5 percent to
1.52 euros in Frankfurt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
