Hungary’s  Mol Nyrt. (MOL)  may be forced
to sell its chain of Tifon d.o.o. gas stations in  Croatia  to
comply with competition law,  Poslovni Dnevnik  reported.  INA may also sell some of its gas stations in less
frequented locations, the newspaper said, citing unidentified
people. The Zagreb-based company will wait for the decision of
the competition regulator, according to Poslovni.  INA on Sept. 5 submitted a binding offer for  OMV AG (OMV) ’s gas
stations in Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina. OMV, central
Europe’s biggest oil company, has 63 stations in Croatia and 28
in Bosnia. Mol Nyrt. holds a 47.47 percent stake in INA, while
the government owns 44.84 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
