November crude options volatility
rose as underlying oil futures were little changed before a
 Federal Reserve  statement on whether there would be another
round of bond purchases to stimulate the economy.  Implied volatility for options expiring in November, a
measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge of
options prices, was 29.32 percent as of 3:39 p.m. in  New York ,
rising from 28.41 percent yesterday. It was the first increase
in five days.  Crude oil for November delivery fell 16 cents to settle at
$97.34 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . It was the
first decline in six days.  The Federal Reserve is likely to announce a third round of
bond purchases tomorrow, according to almost two-thirds of
economists in a Bloomberg survey, while also extending the
duration of its zero-interest-rate policy into 2015.  The most active options in electronic trading today were
October $110 calls, which were unchanged at 4 cents a barrel at
4:19 p.m. with 5,027 lots trading. October $100 calls were the
second-most active, with 1,851 lots changing hands as they
declined 9 cents to 32 a barrel.  Bets that prices would rise accounted for 57 percent of the
46,733 contracts in electronic trading. One contract covers
1,000 barrels of crude.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on open-
outcry volume, where the bulk of options activity occurs.  In the previous session, bullish bets accounted for 54
percent of the 156,728 contracts traded.  October $105 calls were the most actively traded options
yesterday with 12,217 lots changing hands. They rose 1 cent to 8
cents a barrel. October $100 calls advanced 4 cents to 41 cents
on volume of 8,102.  Open interest was highest for December $120 calls with
47,012 contracts. Next were December $80 puts with 44,769 lots
and December $100 calls with 42,124.  To contact the reporter on this story:
