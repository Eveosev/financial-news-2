Harvard University  and Princeton
University shared the top spot in U.S. News and World Report’s
2013 rankings of the best U.S. academic research institutions,
followed by  Yale University .  The top three schools mirrored the 2012 rankings, according
to the list released today by the magazine. Columbia University
and the University of Chicago shared fourth place. The top
liberal arts colleges were also unchanged from a year ago, with
Williams College in first, followed by Amherst College and
Swarthmore College.  The rankings, begun in 1983 and based on criteria such as
graduation rate, reputation and class size, can be influential
with students and parents. The California Institute of
Technology, which tied for fifth place a year ago, dropped to
10th place and tied with Dartmouth College. Eighty-seven percent
of Caltech students graduated in 2011, the lowest percentage in
the top 20.  The Massachusetts Institute of Technology and  Stanford
University  tied for sixth place. Yesterday, MIT was named the
world’s top university by  QS World University Rankings , a U.K.-
based marketing company.  The  University of California , Berkeley -- tied for 21st
place with Georgetown University -- was the highest-ranked
public school.  Claremont McKenna College, which said in January that an
admissions official had reported inflated SAT entrance exam
scores since 2005, fell one spot to 10th among liberal arts
colleges.  To contact the reporter on this story:
