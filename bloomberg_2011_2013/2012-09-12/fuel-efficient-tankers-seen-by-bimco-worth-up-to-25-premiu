The savings from new fuel-efficient
ship designs justify paying 25 percent more for a tanker that
carries refined fuels, the industryâ€™s largest trade group said.  The 15 percent cut in fuel consumption by so-called ECO
ships would allow owners to pay $8.31 million more for a Medium-
Range tanker than for a conventional vessel, Peter Sand, an
analyst at the Baltic and International Maritime Council, known
as Bimco, said in an e-mailed report today. For every $100
increase in the price of a ton of fuel, the value of investing
in an ECO ship rises by $1.3 million, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
