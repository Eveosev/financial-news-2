The Brooklyn Nets introduced a
 herringbone-patterned court  for its new Barclays Center home
that the team hopes will be equally as distinctive as the  Boston
Celtics ’ parquet floor.  The maple hardwood court, made by Amasa, Michigan-based
Connor Sports Flooring Manufacturing Mill, has 240 panels that
take four hours to assemble, the Nets said on their website.  “The vision all along was to have something that was truly
identifiable and unique and when people turned on their TVs at
home, know they were in Brooklyn,” Brett Yormark, the team’s
chief executive officer, said on the site. “When you turn on
the TV and you turn on a Celtics game and you look at that
court, it’s a parquet that has become very recognizable. We want
this to be the same.”  The Nets’ new logo, a “B” inside a basketball surrounded
by the words “Brooklyn  New York ,” is at center court, while
the lanes and baselines feature the team’s new black and white
color scheme.  Brooklyn hosts its first National Basketball Association
preseason game against the  Washington Wizards  on Oct. 15 and
opens the regular season Nov. 1 at home against the  New York
Knicks .  To contact the reporter on this story:
