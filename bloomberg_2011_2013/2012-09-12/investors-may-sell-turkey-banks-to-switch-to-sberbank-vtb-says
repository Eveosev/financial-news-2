Investors may cut their position in
Turkish banks to subscribe to the expected sale of Sberbank
shares by the Russian government, VTB Capital said in a note.  Foreign institutional ownership in Turkish banks’ listed
shares has recently increased to “historical highs” and “some
of these past inflows could prefer to take profits and switch to
Sberbank, which is at a discount of almost 50 percent to its
Turkish peer,” VTB Capital analysts including Mikhail Shlemov
and Akin Tuzun, wrote in an e-mailed note today.  Russia will decide on selling a stake in Sberbank, the
country’s biggest lender, on Sept. 13, two people with knowledge
of the matter said yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
