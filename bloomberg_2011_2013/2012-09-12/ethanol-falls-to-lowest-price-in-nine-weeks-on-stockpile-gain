Ethanol fell in  Chicago  to the
lowest price in nine weeks as corn costs eased and on burgeoning
stockpiles and imports.  Futures followed the grain lower after the U.S. Agriculture
Department reported farmers will harvest 10.727 billion bushels
of corn, compared with the average of 10.42 billion predicted by
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. The Energy Department said today
that ethanol  inventories  climbed to a six-week high in the week
ended Sept. 7 and  imports  jumped to the second-highest amount
this year.  “Ethanol production was down and stockpiles were up,”
said Julie Ward, assistant vice president at R.J. O’Brien &
Associates, a broker in  Des Moines ,  Iowa . “There just isn’t a
lot of positive news for ethanol. The correlation between
ethanol and corn is so strong.”  Denatured ethanol for October delivery dropped 3.5 cents,
or 1.4 percent, to $2.42 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade,
the lowest price since July 6. Futures have gained 9.9 percent
this year.  In cash market trading, ethanol in Chicago sank 6.5 cents,
or 2.6 percent, to $2.405 a gallon and in the U.S. Gulf the
additive decreased 6 cents, or 2.4 percent, to $2.475, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol in  New York  declined 6 cents, or 2.3 percent, to
$2.505 a gallon and on the West Coast the biofuel slipped 4
cents, or 1.5 percent, to $2.56.  Imports Up  Imports averaged 89,000 barrels a day last week, up from
34,000. The 93,000 barrels a day imported in the period ended
Aug. 10 was the most since the Energy Department began reporting
weekly data for ethanol two years ago.  Stockpiles gained a fourth week to the highest level since
July 27 even as  production  slipped 1.6 percent to 816,000 a day,
the lowest since July 27, Energy Department data show.  Corn for December delivery decreased 8.25 cents, or 1.1
percent, to $7.695 a bushel in Chicago. One bushel makes at
least 2.75 gallons of ethanol.  Gasoline for October delivery slid 4.19 cents, or 1.4
percent, to $3.0016 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . The contract covers reformulated gasoline, which is
made to be blended with ethanol before delivery to filling
stations.  The drop in gasoline narrowed its  premium  to ethanol to
58.16 cents from 58.85 yesterday, making the biofuel less
attractive to blend as refiners stand to pocket the difference
between the two.  To contact the reporter on this story:
