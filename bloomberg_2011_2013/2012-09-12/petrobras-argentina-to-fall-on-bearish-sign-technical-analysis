Petrobras Argentina SA (PESA) , the
country’s third-largest crude producer, is set to fall as much
as 14 percent in a month after the shares entered a trading
pattern that usually precedes a downturn, Recognia Inc said.  The stock has formed a so-called head-and-shoulders top,
three consecutive peaks in which the middle one is highest, a
bearish signal, Recognia said in a note to clients. With the
shares already trading below their 21- and 50-day moving
averages, the firm expects the stock to fall to a range between
4.30 to 4.50 pesos in 34 days from yesterday’s close at 5.01
pesos.  “We’ve noticed bearish events since mid-August,” Peter Ashton, the vice president of client services at Ottawa-based
Recognia, said in a telephone interview. “The market is quite
choppy so there isn’t much certainty on what the long-term
direction is going to be.”  A Petrobras Argentina press official said in an e-mail that
the company declined to comment.  The company, a unit of  Brazil ’s state-controlled oil
producer Petroleo Brasileiro SA, is down 19 percent this year,
compared with the Merval index’s 2.3 percent drop. The shares
underperformed the benchmark following the government’s
expropriation of oil producer YPF SA in April and after its
local-currency credit rating was cut by Moody’s Investors
Service, which cited the risk of government intervention in the
industry when it reduced the ranking last month to B1, four
steps below investment grade.  To contact the reporter on this story:
