EnCap Investments LP, the private-
equity firm that has backed about 190 oil and gas companies
since 1988, is seeking $4.25 billion for a new fund, according
to a summary of terms obtained by  Bloomberg News .  EnCap Energy Capital Fund IX LP will invest in so-called
upstream companies, or those focusing on oil and gas exploration
and production. The fundâ€™s predecessor raised $3.6 billion in
January 2011.  Charles Bauer, co-head of  investor relations  at Houston-
based EnCap, declined to comment.  Private-equity firms including Riverstone Holdings LLC,
First Reserve Corp. and Kayne Anderson Capital Advisors LP are
raising funds aimed at profiting from growth in the  energy
industry . New York-based Riverstone and Greenwich, Connecticut-
based First Reserve are both seeking about $6 billion. Kayne
Anderson, based in  Los Angeles , is targeting $1.6 billion after
closing on about $1.1 billion in July.  EnCap plans to commit $200 million to $300 million per deal
from its new fund to management teams that will acquire oil and
gas reserves, the firm told clients in a cover letter. The fund
will charge an annual management fee of 1.5 percent and 20
percent of net proceeds as carried interest, according to the
summary of terms.  The prior fund, EnCap Energy Capital Fund VIII LP, has
committed $3.3 billion to 19 companies and two more deals will
close shortly, the firm told clients.  Fund Returns  Fund VIII, which started investing in November 2010, was
generating a gross internal rate of return of 78 percent and a
multiple of 1.5 times capital as of July 31, according to the
summary of terms. Fund VII, which made its first investment in
2007, was producing a 33 percent rate of return and 1.7 times
multiple.  EnCap Investments, which also has an office in  Dallas , has
managed 16 institutional funds. Its 143 realized deals have
generated $11.2 billion, according to the client letter.  The investment team is led by  David Miller , Gary Petersen,
Martin Phillips and Robert Zorich.  The firm in July raised $1.79 billion for an energy
infrastructure fund, which provides growth capital for midstream
oil and gas industry deals. The fund is managed by a separate
team of 12 investment professionals.  To contact the reporter on this story:
