Harvard University basketball co-
captain  Kyle Casey  planned to withdraw from school and skip the
2012-13 season because of the academic cheating scandal at the
school,  SI.com reported  on its website, based on information
from people who were not identified.  The other Crimson co-captain, Brandyn Curry, had not yet
decided whether to withdraw, his father, Herman Curry, told
SI.com yesterday.  Harvard, based in Cambridge,  Massachusetts , said Aug. 30
that it was investigating about 125 students for academic
misconduct on a take-home final exam. Students have said that
collaboration on homework and exams was common and tolerated in
the class, Introduction to Congress.  Athletic department spokesmen Tim Williamson and Kurt
Svoboda, as well as university spokesman Kevin Galvin, said they
could not comment on individual students.  Harvard went 26-4 last regular season and won the Ivy
League title, which gave the team its first trip to the National
Collegiate Athletic Association menâ€™s basketball tournament
since 1946.  To contact the reporter on this story:
