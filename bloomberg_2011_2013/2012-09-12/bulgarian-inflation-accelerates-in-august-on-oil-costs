 Bulgarian inflation accelerated in
August as higher fuel prices increased transport and production
costs.  Consumer prices rose 3.9 percent from a year earlier,
compared with a 3.8 percent increase in July, the National
Statistics Institute in Sofia said in a statement today. The
median estimate of three economists surveyed by Bloomberg was
3.8 percent. Prices advanced 0.5 percent from the previous
month.  The country’s EU-harmonized inflation will ease to 2.6
percent on average in 2012 and 2.7 percent in 2013, the EU
forecast on May 11. Bulgaria, the European Union’s poorest
country in terms of economic output per capita, withstood the
global recession without an international bailout. Producer
prices rose 4.5 percent July after 3.3 percent in June.  To contact the reporter on this story:
