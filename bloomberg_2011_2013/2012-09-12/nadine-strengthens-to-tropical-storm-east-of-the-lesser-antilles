Tropical storm Nadine strengthened
while remaining no threat to land, the U.S. National Hurricane
Center said.  Nadine is moving west-northwest at 17 miles per hour, and
is located about 995 miles (1,601 kilometers) east-northeast of
the Lesser Antilles, the center said in a 5 a.m. Atlantic time
advisory. Maximum sustained winds were 45 miles per hour.
Additional strengthening is forecast during the next 48 hours,
and it may become a hurricane by tomorrow, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
