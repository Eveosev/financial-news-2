Germany ’s bonds fell, with 10-year
yields rising to the highest in more than two months, as a
constitutional court cleared  Europe ’s permanent bailout fund for
ratification, damping demand for the safest assets.  Spanish and Italian  government securities  advanced amid
speculation the 500 billion-euro ($645 billion) European
Stability Mechanism will help stem the spread of the region’s
debt crisis. Irish and Portuguese bonds also gained before euro-
area finance ministers meet this week in Cyprus. Germany must
make sure its share of the ESM is capped at 190 billion euros,
the court said in its ruling today.  The decision is “one nagging issue that’s out of the way
and means the focus is now going to be on the Eurogroup
meeting,” said  Ciaran O’Hagan , head of European rates strategy
at  Societe Generale SA (GLE)  in Paris. The cap on liability “will not
prevent the ESM from going ahead, which is critical,” he said.  Germany’s 10-year yield climbed eight basis points, or 0.08
percentage point, to 1.62 percent at 4:27 p.m. London time after
rising to 1.65 percent, the highest since June 29. The 1.5
percent bond due September 2022 dropped 0.72, or 7.20 euros per
1,000-euro face amount, to 98.885.  The yield increased above its 200-day moving average,
currently at 1.64 percent, for the first time since July 2011.  German Decision  Germany’s Federal Constitutional Court in Karlsruhe
dismissed motions that sought to block the ESM and a deficit-
control treaty championed by  Chancellor Angela Merkel . The ESM’s
governing board will hold its first meeting on Oct. 8,
Luxembourg Prime Minister  Jean-Claude Juncker  said in a
statement after the verdict.  The euro strengthened 0.4 percent to $1.2904 after rising
above $1.29 for the first time since May.  German  five-year notes  fell for a third day as the nation
received bids for 5.47 billion euros of new securities due in
October 2017 at an auction today, compared with a maximum sales
target of 5 billion euros.  The yield on the previous benchmark five-year notes due in
April 2017 rose seven basis points to 0.54 percent.  Germany received the  fewest bids  relative to its maximum
sales target since demand dropped below its goal at an auction
on Sept. 28. The country also sold 578 million euros of 10-year
index-linked bonds at an average yield of minus 0.27 percent.  Spanish Bonds  Spain ’s  10-year yield  fell seven basis points to 5.62
percent. The extra yield investors demand to hold the securities
instead of similar-maturity bunds shrank 15 basis points to 400
basis points after contracting to 395 basis points, the
narrowest since April 5.  Italy ’s  10-year bond  yield dropped five basis points to
5.03 percent. They earlier declined to 5.01 percent, the least
since April 2.  The nation sold 9 billion euros of one-year bills at a  rate 
of 1.692 percent, the lowest level since March. Italy also
auctioned 3 billion euros of three-month securities.  Dutch bonds declined as the Netherlands holds elections
today that may result in a coalition between parties that have
clashed on domestic and European policies. The campaign’s final
poll showed Diederik Samsom’s opposition  Labor Party  was almost
neck-and-neck with Prime Minister  Mark Rutte ’s  Liberal Party .  The Dutch  10-year bond  yield increased two basis points to
1.88 percent.  Ireland, Portugal  Ireland’s nine-year  bond yield  dropped 19 basis points to
5.41 percent after reaching 5.40 percent, the lowest level since
August 2010.  The yield on Portuguese debt due in October 2023 declined
20 basis points to 8.09 percent after sliding to 8.05 percent,
the least since March 2011. The rate on the  Greek bond  maturing
in February 2023 fell 92 basis points to 20.7 percent.  Euro-area finance ministers will weigh the “bleak” state of
the economy, examine the situation in selected countries and
take stock of progress in setting up the European Stability
Mechanism when they meet on Sept. 14 in Cyprus, a European Union
official said this week.  Volatility on Irish bonds was the highest in euro-area
markets today, followed by Germany and  France , according to
measures of 10-year or similar-dated debt, the spread between
two-year and 10-year securities and credit-default swaps.  Bunds have proven better than Treasuries since the start of
the global financial crisis five years ago as U.S. stimulus
measures and record deficits keep investors wary of a resurgence
of inflation.  The BLOOMBERG RISKLESS RETURN RANKING shows bunds are the
best-performing sovereign securities among Group of Seven
nations since June 2007, returning 8.4 percent after adjusting
for volatility and comparing returns in local currencies.
Treasuries have gained 7.4 percent, also lagging behind
Canadian, French and U.K. debt on a risk-adjusted basis.  German debt returned 2.6 percent this year through
yesterday, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the
European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. Spanish
bonds advanced 1.5 percent and Italy’s gained 15 percent.  -- With assistance from Cordell Eddings in  New York . Editors:
