Jeronimo Martins SGPS SA (JMT) ,
Portugal’s biggest retailer by market value, may open its first
stores in  Colombia  by the end of the first quarter of next year,
Rita Fragoso, a company spokeswoman, said in an e-mailed
response to questions yesterday.  “The opening of the first stores may take place between
the fourth quarter of 2012 and the first quarter of 2013,”
Fragoso said.  Lisbon-based Jeronimo Martins laid out a strategy in 2011
of growing in Poland and entering Colombia amid a recession in
its home market. The retailer will “surely” open its first
stores in Colombia in the fourth quarter, Chairman Alexandre Soares dos Santos said on March 7.  The company may seek acquisitions to become one of the
South American country’s top three retailers, Chief Financial
Officer  Alan Johnson  said in an interview that day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
