European Central Bank Governing
Council member Erkki Liikanen said the bank’s bond-buying plan
is intended to quell financial markets’ assault on the euro by
regaining control of borrowing costs.  “The aim of the decision is safeguarding monetary policy
transmission and the singleness of the monetary policy,”
Liikanen, who also heads the Bank of Finland in Helsinki, said
in an e-mailed statement today. “Unfounded risk premia, for
example those related to the reversibility of the euro, are not
acceptable.”  The ECB is preparing to buy debt with a maturity of up to
three years on the secondary market to ease pressure on
countries’ sovereign bond yields. ECB President  Mario Draghi 
last week unveiled details of the unlimited program, which
requires the countries to accept “strict and effective”
conditionality in the form of a program administered by the
European Financial Stability Facility or later the European
Stability Mechanism, Liikanen said.  It is now up to governments in countries such as Spain and
 Italy  to trigger ECB buying by requesting aid and agreeing to
reforms. The Frankfurt-based central bank’s plan doesn’t
“change the division of responsibilities between  member states 
and the ECB,” Liikanen said.  ECB Executive Board member Joerg Asmussen suggested policy
makers may sell bonds purchased under their new program if
governments don’t stick to agreed conditions. ECB’s statutes
allow the bank to be “active on financial markets by buying and
selling securities,” he said yesterday when asked whether the
central bank would consider dumping the bonds in case of non-
compliance.  To contact the reporter on this story:
