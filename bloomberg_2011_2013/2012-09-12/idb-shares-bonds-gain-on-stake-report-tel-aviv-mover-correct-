IDB Holding Corp. (IDBH) ’s bonds and
shares jumped after Calcalist newspaper reported that
controlling shareholder Ganden Holdings Ltd. is in talks to sell
a stake to a Latin American businessman.  The yield on IDB’s 4.4 percent notes maturing in June 2014
fell 638 basis points, or 6.38 percentage points, to 76.24
percent at the close in Tel Aviv, according to prices compiled
by Bloomberg. IDB shares advanced 5.2 percent, the most since
Aug. 19, to 14.55 shekels.  Discount Investment Corp. (DISI) , 74 percent
owned by IDB, soared 16 percent to 7.3 shekels, the highest
since June 19.  Nochi Dankner’s Ganden is nearing an agreement to sell a 9
percent stake to Eduardo Elsztain, Calcalist reported.  Elsztain
would pay about 1 billion shekels ($253 million) based on
Ganden’s valuation, the newspaper reported, without saying how
it obtained the information.  IDB is trying to get cash infusions after its second-
quarter financial results included a “going concern” warning.
The company said on Sept. 5 a  Tel Aviv  District Court instructed
it place 35 million shekels owed to Series Bet bondholders in
trust and gave the company 21 days to reach an agreement with
bondholders over payments. Calls to IDB’s spokeswoman’s office
weren’t immediately returned.  The benchmark TA-25 index rose 0.3 percent.  Cellcom Israel
Ltd. (CEL) , 47 percent  owned  by Discount, climbed 4.3 percent to 31.53
shekels, the highest since May 17.  To contact the reporter on this story:
