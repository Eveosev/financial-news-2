Germany’s inflation rate rose for
the first time in six months in August as energy prices
increased.  Inflation, calculated using a harmonized European Union
method, accelerated to 2.2 percent from 1.9 percent in July, the
Federal Statistics Office in Wiesbaden said today, confirming an
Aug. 29 estimate. In the month, consumer prices gained 0.4
percent, more than the initially reported 0.3 percent.  Oil prices  have risen almost 25 percent since the end of
June as a European Union embargo on crude purchases from  Iran 
took full effect on July 1 and storms in the  Gulf of Mexico 
crimped output. At the same time, Europe’s sovereign debt crisis
is damping economic growth across the 17-nation euro area.
European Central Bank policy makers on Sept. 6 agreed on an
unlimited bond-purchase program aimed at regaining control of
 interest rates  in countries like Spain or Italy.  “Rising energy prices currently are the one main reason
for inflation,” said Jens Kramer, an economist at NordLB in
Hanover. “In general, market participants aren’t very concerned
about rising prices. All eyes are on the debt crisis in the euro
area.”  ECB President  Mario Draghi  said last week that he expects
euro-area inflation to drop below the bank’s 2 percent limit
next year. The rate was at 2.6 percent in August.  Germany’s non-harmonized inflation rate rose to 2.1 percent
in August from 1.7 percent in July, the statistics office said,
revising up its Aug. 29 estimate. The main reasons for the
increase were higher costs for heating oil and fuel, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
