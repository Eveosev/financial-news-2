Spain ’s core inflation stagnated in
August, as the second recession in three years pushed the
jobless rate to almost 25 percent and depressed consumer demand.  The  Underlying inflation  rate, which excludes energy and
fresh food, was unchanged from July at 1.4 percent, the National
Statistics Institute in Madrid said today. Prices rose 0.2
percent from the prior month. The August annual rate matched the
median of six estimates in a Bloomberg survey.  Spanish retailers slashed prices during the seasonal
discount period as indebted households suffering from the
highest  unemployment rate  in Europe reined in spending.
Inflation may accelerate this month as a value-added tax
increase comes into effect, even though companies including
 Inditex SA (ITX) , the owner of fashion brand Zara, have said they will
absorb the higher levies rather than passing them on to
consumers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
