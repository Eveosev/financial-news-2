Jordan agreed to buy 100,000 metric
tons of wheat from Ukraine’s Nibulon at $360 a metric ton,
according to two traders with direct knowledge of the tender.  The cargoes are for delivery in the second half of December
and first half of January, said the traders, who declined to be
identified because they aren’t authorized to speak to the media.  To contact the reporter on this story:
