An International Monetary Fund team
will go to  Egypt  this month to begin discussions about a loan to
that country, a fund’s spokeswoman said.  “Upon the government’s request, a technical team is
scheduled to travel to Egypt to start talks on an IMF loan
before the end of the month,” IMF spokeswoman Wafa Amr said by
e-mail.  Egypt increased its application for an IMF loan to $4.8
billion last month as IMF Managing Director  Christine Lagarde 
traveled to Cairo to meet authorities including President
Mohamed Mursi. The request has sparked opposition from political
activists who say the international lender will impose stringent
conditions in exchange for the money.  To contact the reporter on this story:
