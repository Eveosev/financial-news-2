Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer
LLP, the number two legal adviser on mergers and acquisitions,
reopened in  Singapore  after withdrawing in 2007 as deals climb
in the Southeast  Asia  city state’s region.  “The time is right to open in Singapore,” Stephen Revell,
who heads the firm’s global capital markets practice, said in a
phone interview. “We’ve got a lot of demand from clients to be
here and centering deals in Singapore,” he said.  Revell is jointly heading the new office with Gavin MacLaren, in charge of the energy practice in Asia, and they
plan to have 15 to 20 lawyers by the end of next month.  The return of Freshfields comes as 23 foreign law firms
last month bid for licenses to practice local corporate law in
Singapore as the legal market further opens. Mergers and
acquisitions in the city state rose 26 percent to $36.3 billion
this year while uncertainty over the euro has hampered deal
activity in the 17-nation group.  Revell declined to comment on whether Freshfields has
applied for a local law licence. It was licensed to advise on
non-Singapore law from its office in the city as of Sept. 1.  The London-based firm advised Vallar Plc on its $3 billion
investment in  Indonesia ’s PT  Bumi Resources (BUMI)  and PT Berau Coal
Energy and the $2 billion initial public offering of Malaysia’s
 IHH Healthcare Bhd. (IHH)  this year. It also advised on the $5.45
billion share sale of  Hutchison Port Holdings Trust (HPHT)  in
Singapore.  Drew & Napier  The firm’s revenue slipped 0.8 percent to 1.13 billion
pounds ($1.8 billion) for the 2011-12 financial year, dropping
it to the rank of fourth-largest London-based  law firm  by sales.  Freshfields was the first international law firm in
Singapore in 1980 and later established an alliance with local
firm Drew & Napier LLC before ending that and withdrawing in
2007.  Revell said the 2007 decision was due to the global
economic environment, and the reopening reflects the strong
position of Singapore currently.  Singapore opened its legal industry in 2000 by allowing
foreign firms to set up joint ventures. There are 110 foreign
law firms registered in Singapore as of Sept. 1, a 53 percent
increase from July 2007.  To contact the reporter on this story:
