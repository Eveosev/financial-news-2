Ukraine’s tax police opened a
criminal probe against top managers at  Bunge Ltd. (BG) ’s subsidiary
in the former Soviet republic, accusing them of tax
embezzlement, company spokeswoman Yulia Matviychuk said.  The tax inspection unit searched  White Plains ,  New York- 
based Bunge’s DP Suntrade’s branch in Odessa on Aug. 28, seizing
documents, computers and employees’ personal belongings,
Matviychuk said in an e-mailed response to Bloomberg questions.
Suntrade is a grain exporter and producer of sunflower oil.  The tax police accused Suntrade of signing false contracts
with two companies that are suspected of phony business
operations and tax embezzlement. Bunge denies any wrongdoing,
saying all operations were done “in strict” compliance with
national laws, while sunflower seeds it bought from the two
companies were processed and the oil was exported, she said in
the statement.  “We are surprised by the tax police decision opening a
criminal probe and to search DP Suntrade’s offices, while the
company itself provided police with all the necessary documents
it demanded,” Matviychuk said. “Such police acts have a
negative impact on the company’s operation and don’t help
improve the investment climate in  Ukraine .”  Bunge appealed the tax police decision at the prosecutor’s
office and in court, she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
