Sri Lanka ’s exports declined the
most in three years in July as a faltering global recovery
sapped demand for the island’s garments, textiles, tea and
rubber products.  Overseas sales  fell 17.4 percent from a year earlier to
$794.4 million, after declining 7.9 percent in June, the  Central
Bank of Sri Lanka  said in a statement today. Imports slid 24.9
percent to $1.33 billion, leaving a trade deficit of $534.6
million.  Sri Lanka raised interest  rates  in February and April, let
its currency weaken to a record low and increased energy prices
as part of a policy overhaul to narrow the  trade gap , which has
pressured foreign reserves. The shortfall in July was the lowest
in 17 months, the central bank said today.  “Policies adopted by the central bank and the government
earlier in the year have led to a significant deceleration in
expenditure on imports by July 2012,” it said.  Sri Lankan economic growth probably slowed to a more than
two-year low of 6.8 percent last quarter, according to the
median estimate in a  Bloomberg News  survey ahead of a report due
this month.  The central bank is expected to keep its  reverse repurchase
rate  at 9.75 percent and the  repurchase rate  at 7.75 percent,
according to all six economists surveyed by Bloomberg News ahead
of the policy meeting due on Sept. 18.  The island’s rupee, which has dropped about 13 percent
against the dollar this year, was little changed at 132.25 a
dollar at 10:26 a.m. in  Colombo .  To contact the reporter on this story:
