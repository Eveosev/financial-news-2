Soybeans jumped the most in two
weeks after the U.S. said a lingering Midwest drought will cut
output more than estimated. Corn fell on signs that the harvest
will shrink less than analysts forecast.  Domestic soybean production will drop to 2.634 billion
bushels this year, the smallest crop in nine years and down 14
percent from a year earlier, the  U.S. Department of Agriculture 
said today in a report. The average estimate of 34 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg was 2.659 billion. Prices for farmers will
average a record $16 a bushel in the year that began Sept. 1, up
29 percent from a year earlier, the USDA said.  “Soybean supplies will be tight this year, and prices will
stay elevated to slow demand,”  Mark Schultz , the chief analyst
for Northstar Commodity Investment Co. in  Minneapolis , said in a
telephone interview. “We have yet to see any evidence of
slowing demand either in the U.S. or from overseas buyers.”  Soybean futures for November delivery rose 1.7 percent to
$17.2975 a bushel at 9:34 a.m. on the Chicago Board of Trade,
heading for the biggest gain for a most-active contract since
Aug. 29 and the first advance since reaching a record $17.89 on
Sept. 4.  Demand for U.S. soybeans is forecast to drop 15 percent
this year, the USDA said. Export sales, which are already at a
record for the start of the marketing season, will fall 22
percent to the lowest in seven years while domestic processing
is projected to fall to the lowest since 1997, USDA data show.  Corn Falls  Corn futures for December delivery retreated 1 percent to
$7.70 a bushel on the CBOT, heading for the first three-day
decline since Aug. 28. Earlier, the price touched a seven-week
low at $7.5925. The grain still is up 20 percent this year.  U.S. production will total 10.727 billion bushels, the
smallest crop in six years and down 13 percent from 12.358
billion in 2011, the USDA said today. The average prediction of
35 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was for 10.420 billion.
Supplies of the grain on Aug. 31, 2013, will be greater than
analyst estimates.  “The corn crop is a little larger than people expected,”
said  Don Roose , the president of U.S. Commodities Inc. in  West
Des Moines ,  Iowa . “Prices were high enough earlier this year to
slow demand,” as livestock producers sought cheaper feed
alternatives and began to shrink herds, Roose said.  Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, valued at $76.5 billion in
2011, followed by soybeans at $35.8 billion, government figures
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
