Libyan Deputy Prime Minister
Mustafa Abushagur was elected prime minister, edging out wartime
rebel premier Mahmoud Jibril.  Abushagur took 96 votes and Jibril won 94 in the country’s
interim legislature, Mohammed Magariaf, who leads the 200-seat
body, said after the vote in Tripoli yesterday. The new prime
minister has as many as 30 days to form a Cabinet.  The election comes after the U.S. ambassador to  Libya ,
Chris Stevens, and three other Americans were killed in an
attack on the consulate in the city of Benghazi, violence that
highlights the instability in the north African nation following
the overthrow of  Muammar Qaddafi . The country needs to address
security issues in order to move forward, Abushagur said in an
interview on Sept. 11.  On his Twitter account before the vote, Abushagur called
the attack on the U.S. consulate “cowardly and criminal.”  Abushagur has pledged to rebuild a nation battered both by
the eight-month conflict last year and the after-effects of
decades of neglect under Qaddafi.  “The oil industry is essential but Libya needs much
more,” Abushagur said in the interview. “We need to build
roads, create public transport systems, and review all existing
contracts worth $109 billion signed under the Qaddafi regime.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
