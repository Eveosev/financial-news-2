Fed funds, the U.S. overnight
inter-bank lending  rate , opened at 0.16 percent, within the
 Federal Reserve ’s target of zero to 0.25 percent.  Fed funds closed at 0.15 percent yesterday after trading
from 0.1 percent to 0.17 percent and averaging 0.15 percent,
according to ICAP Plc, the world’s largest inter-dealer broker.  The central bank will sell $7 billion to $8 billion of
Treasuries maturing from April 2014 to November 2014. The sales
are part of the Fed’s program to replace $267 billion of short-
term debt in its portfolio with longer-term Treasuries in an
effort to keep borrowing costs low.  To contact the reporter on this story:
