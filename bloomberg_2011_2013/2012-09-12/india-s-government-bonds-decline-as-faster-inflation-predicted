India ’s 10-year bonds declined on
concern a report this week will show inflation accelerated,
reducing room for the central bank to ease monetary policy.  The wholesale-price index probably rose 7 percent in August
from a year earlier, a Bloomberg News survey of economists
showed before data due Sept. 14. The gauge climbed 6.87 percent
in July. The  Reserve Bank  of India will leave the repurchase
 rate  unchanged at 8 percent at a review on Sept. 17, according
to all 12 economists in a separate survey. The RBI last lowered
the repurchase  rate  by 50 basis points in April.  “Inflation continues to be a concern,” said Vivek Rajpal,
a fixed-income strategist in Mumbai at Nomura Holdings Inc. “We
aren’t expecting any rate cut in the near term.”  The yield on the 8.15 percent notes due June 2022 rose one
basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 8.19 percent as of
9:39 a.m. in Mumbai, according to the central bank’s trading
system.  One-year  interest-rate swaps , or derivative contracts used
to guard against fluctuations in funding costs, climbed one
basis point to 7.77 percent, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
