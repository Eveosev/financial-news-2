Total SA (FP) , France’s largest oil
company, secured an environmental permit to explore Uganda’s
Block 1, according to an adviser to the country’s government.  “We issued them the permit last week,” Tom Okurut,
executive director of the National Environment Management
Authority, said today in an interview in Arusha. The approval
allows Total to carry out a seismic survey to confirm the size
of oil resources in the area.  Total and China National Offshore Oil Corp. completed the
purchase of Block 1 and two other Ugandan blocks from  Tullow Oil
Plc (TLW)  for $2.9 billion in February, gaining access to the  Lake
Albert  Basin and an estimated 2.5 billion barrels of oil.
They’re set to submit development plans to the government by
year-end and expect to pump commercial volumes of oil from 2016.  Anastasia Zhivulina, a spokeswoman for Paris-based Total,
said she couldn’t immediately comment.  Uganda also expects to complete a so-called Oil Contingency
Plan by December, a recovery program designed to mitigate the
effects of an accidental oil spill, according to Okurut.  The East African country’s parliament has proposed an
environmental levy to contribute to the contingency plan’s 5
billion-shilling ($2 million) annual budget.  To contact the reporter on this story:
