Iraq signed two contracts valued at
$365 million to build more than 4,000 homes in  Baghdad .  Iraqâ€™s Kurdistan-based Kar Engineering & Construction Co.
signed a $185 million deal to build 2,016 units in northern
Baghdad, the president of the Baghdad investment committee said
today. The project, a compound called Ibn Fernas, will be
finished within four years, Shaker al-Zamili said.  A second project to construct 2,000 homes costing as much
as $180 million was awarded to Iraq-based al-Faheem for General
Contracting Company. The compound will be built in western
Baghdad and complete within three years, Zamili said.  Iraq is seeking foreign investment to help rebuild an
economy and infrastructure damaged by war, sanctions and
underinvestment. The country plans to spend $4 billion on
housing through 2016 to reduce a shortage of homes, Construction
and Housing Minister Mohammad Saheb al-Darraji said May 21.  To contact the reporter on this story:
