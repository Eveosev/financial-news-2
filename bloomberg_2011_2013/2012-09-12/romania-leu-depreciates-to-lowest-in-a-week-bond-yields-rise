Romania ’s leu depreciated to the
lowest level in a week on speculation a surge in inflation to
the highest in a year isn’t enough to prompt the central bank to
increase  interest rates .  The leu weakened as much as 0.3 percent to 4.5015 per euro,
the lowest level since Sept. 5, before trading down 0.1 percent
at 4.4939 by 5:05 p.m. in Bucharest. Yields on the country’s
2018 euro-denominated bond due in 2018 rose five basis points,
or 0.05 percentage point, to 4.795 percent.  The central bank left its benchmark rate unchanged at 5.25
percent for a third consecutive meeting on Aug. 2. The inflation
rate climbed for a third month in August to the fastest in a
year at 3.9 percent, a report showed yesterday. That exceeded
the 3.7 percent median estimate of eight economists in a
Bloomberg survey.  “We assess as highly likely that central bank remains on
hold at 5.25 percent, at least for the rest of the year, as the
external and internal tensions deem it necessary that it takes a
cautious approach to monetary policy,” Roxana Hulea, an analyst
at  BRD Groupe Societe Generale SA (BRD) , wrote in a note to clients
today. “Further leu depreciation cannot be ruled out.”  The leu gained as much as 0.2 percent earlier today after
 Germany ’s top constitutional court cleared the way for
ratification of a permanent euro-area rescue fund.  Political wrangling between Romania’s president and prime
minister led to a presidential impeachment vote last month. The
 European Central Bank  has pledged to buy bonds of the euro-areas
most indebted countries in an effort to contain the region’s
debt crisis.  To contact the reporter on this story:
