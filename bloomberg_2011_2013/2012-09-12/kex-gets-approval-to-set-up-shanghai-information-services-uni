Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing
Ltd. (388) , the world’s second-largest bourse operator by market
value, will set up a financial information business in  China  as
part of a HK$3 billion ($386 million) investment in technology.  The bourse, in the process of buying the London Metal
Exchange, received clearance from Chinese authorities to set up
Ganghui Financial Information Services ( Shanghai ) Ltd.,
according to a statement today. Beginning in the third quarter
of 2013, the company will distribute market data from Hong Kong
Exchanges.  Most information vendors in mainland China currently
receive HKEx data via third-party connections, the bourse
operator said in the statement. The company announced in March
that it would spend  HK$3 billion on technology upgrades,
collectively called the Orion Technology Initiatives, over three
years to boost trading speeds and expand its derivatives
business amid increased competition from regional exchanges.  “The market-data hub in Shanghai will enable the delivery
of broader HKEx market-data products to Mainland information
vendors, and subsequently investors, through a reliable,
scalable and more cost-effective infrastructure,” Chief
Executive Officer Charles Li said in the statement. He will also
be head of the new unit. Li’s contract was renewed for three
years today, the bourse said in a separate statement.  To contact the reporters on this story:
