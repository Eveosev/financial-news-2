Access Bank Plc (ACCESS) ,  Nigeria ’s fourth-
largest lender by market value, climbed to its highest level in
18 months after reporting first-half profit more than trebled.  The  shares rose  4.1 percent to 9.1 naira at the 2:30 p.m.
close in Lagos, the commercial capital, the strongest since
March 15, 2011. The stock has advanced for seven days, the
longest streak in two months.  The Lagos-based bank said yesterday net income in the six
months through June climbed to 26.3 billion naira ($166 million)
from 8.05 billion naira a year earlier, as revenue doubled to
108.7 billion naira.  “Access Bank’s first half results were encouraging and are
currently ahead of our full year 2012 earnings expectations on
some key metrics,” Muyiwa Oni and Rele Adesina, Lagos-based
analysts at  Stanbic IBTC Bank Plc (IBTCCB) , wrote in e-mailed comments
today.  Access Bank last year acquired Intercontinental Bank Plc,
one of eight lenders bailed out by the central bank in 2009
after a debt crisis caused in part by loans to speculators in
equities.  Access Bank has  surged  90 percent this year, compared with
a 44 percent gain for the  Bloomberg NSE Banking Index (NGSEB10) , which
tracks the performance of Nigeria’s 10 most capitalized lenders.  To contact the reporter on this story:
