Huawei Technologies Co.,  China ’s
biggest telephone equipment maker, said it has no immediate plan
for a mobile operating system following a report on the Sohu.com
website that it would develop a backup to  Google Inc. (GOOG) ’s Android.  “Huawei will not be launching a proprietary operating
system in the foreseeable future,” Scott Sykes, a spokesman for
Shenzhen-based Huawei, said in an e-mail today. “Our innovation
strategy is governed by our commitment to open collaborations.”  Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei told workers at the company’s
research unit that it needs to develop a mobile operating system
in case it lost access to Android or Microsoft Corp.’s Windows
Phone system, Sohu.com’s business news website reported on Sept.
10.  The company, which runs its Ascend P1 flagship smartphone
on Android 4.0, is expanding sales of handsets and tablets that
use Google’s operating system as it diversifies revenue from
phone network equipment. Increasing mobile device sales and
pushing into cloud- and business-computing services are part of
the company’s plan to more than triple revenue to $100 billion
by 2021, from $32 billion last year.  The  Sohu report  quoted Ren saying a mobile operating system
is a “strategic consideration” and “disaster preparedness”
for Huawei in the event that companies like Google or Microsoft
cut off access to their operating systems.  “We don’t have a timetable to introduce our own operating
system, and we are not expecting that in the near future,”
Sykes said.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
