Egyptian Adel Imam, one of the Arab
world’s most famous comic actors, had a three-month prison
sentence for insulting Islam in his films and plays overturned
on appeal, Haram Misdemeanour Appeals Court said in a faxed
statement.  The case against Imam was brought by Asran Mansour, a
lawyer with ties to Islamist groups, who accused the actor of
offending Islam and its symbols.  To contact the reporter on this story:
