PTT Global Chemical Pcl, (PTTGC)  Thailand’s
biggest chemicals company by market value, sold $1 billion in
10-year bonds, its first U.S. dollar-offering in more than seven
years.  The 4.25 percent securities yield 260 basis points more
than similar-maturity Treasuries, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The bonds, the first dollar-denominated sale from the
Bangkok-based company since June 2005, may be rated Baa2 by
Moody’s Investors Service, the second-lowest level of investment
grade.  The company’s $300 million of 5.5 percent notes due June
2015 traded at 108.1 cents on the dollar to yield 2.49 percent
on Aug. 31, Bloomberg data show.  Barclays Plc, Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc and Standard Chartered Plc managed the sale,
the data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
