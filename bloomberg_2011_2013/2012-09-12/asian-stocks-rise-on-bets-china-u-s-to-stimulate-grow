Asian  stocks  rose, with the
regional benchmark index headed for the longest winning streak
in two months, on speculation China and the U.S. will take more
measures to spur growth in the world’s two biggest economies.  Samsung Electronics Co. (005930) , which gets 48 percent of its
revenue in China and the Americas, rose 3 percent in Seoul.
Fanuc Corp., the world’s biggest maker of industrial robots,
gained 2.2 percent after Japan’s machinery orders beat estimates
in July. China Eastern Airlines Corp., the nation’s second-
largest carrier by passengers, climbed 4.7 percent in Hong Kong
after announcing plans to raise $570 million.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index rose 1.3 percent to 120.91 as
of 7:26 p.m. in Tokyo, headed for a five-day advance, the
longest winning streak since July. About four stocks gained for
each that fell. Stocks have climbed since the  European Central
Bank  announced an unlimited bond-buying program last week to
tame the region’s debt crisis.  “If between the  Federal Reserve , the European Central Bank
and People’s Bank of China, we start to see some moderate
easing, then definitely one of the asset classes that will
benefit is equity,” said David Gaud, a senior portfolio manager
at Edmond de Rothschild Asset Management in Hong Kong, which
oversees 14 billion euros ($18 billion) in equities and
convertible bonds. “In China, we should be able to see a bit
more easing in the coming months. They’ve started already and
there’s more room for improvement.”  Nikkei, Kospi  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index gained 1.8 percent this quarter
through yesterday as expectations of further stimulus measures
overshadowed signs of a global economic slowdown. The Asian

the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.  Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average rose 1.7 percent. South
Korea’s  Kospi Index (KOSPI)  added 1.6 percent as the government reported

yen’s advance. The yen reached 77.70 per dollar yesterday, the
highest level since June 1.  Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao signaled there’s more room for
fiscal and monetary policy to support growth, saying China still
has “ample strength” to meet its economic goals for the year.
Wen spoke yesterday at the World Economic Forum in the Chinese
city of Tianjin.  “The market is getting confident that governments won’t
let economies get worse, as expectations are mounting in the
U.S. for more monetary easing and China expands public
investment,” said Hiroichi Nishi, an equities manager in Tokyo
