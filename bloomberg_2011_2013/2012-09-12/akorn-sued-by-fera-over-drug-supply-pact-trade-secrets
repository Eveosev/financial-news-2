Fera Pharmaceuticals LLC, a
provider of anti-infective ophthalmic medicines, sued business
partner  Akorn Inc. (AKRX) , seeking more than $100 million in damages
for contract violations and misuse of trade secrets.  Fera alleges Akorn, of  Lake Forest , Illinois, in 2009
agreed to make Fera products for seven years, “failed to
perform its duties,” and sought to acquire Locust Valley, New
York-based Fera’s trade secrets and make at least two products
itself, according to papers filed today in New York state
Supreme Court.  “Akorn’s violation of the Commercial Manufacturing Supply
agreement caused Fera substantial economic harm,” and Akorn
should pay compensatory damages, Fera said in court papers.  Fera seeks a jury trial and unspecified punitive damages.  Akorn’s chief financial officer, Tim Dick, didn’t
immediately return a voice-mail message seeking comment on the
lawsuit.  The case is Fera Pharmaceuticals LLC v. Akorn Inc.,
653184/2012, New York state Supreme Court, County of  New York 
(Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
