The University of  Oklahoma  started
a partnership with Fox Sports to air more than 1,000 hours of
the school’s sports programming on the  News Corp. (NWS)  unit’s
channels.  The multimedia agreement will include distributing Sooner
Sports TV programming blocks to Fox Sports networks in about 9
million homes in Oklahoma, Texas, Arkansas and Louisiana, the
network said in a news release.  The agreement “marks the beginning of a terrific
opportunity to engage our entire university community in
athletic, academic and cultural events all across our campus,”
David Boren, the Norman, Oklahoma-based university’s president,
said in the statement. “By providing unprecedented access to
many areas of our university, millions of people across our
state and nation will be able to see all of the truly great
developments happening at OU.”  Financial terms of the deal weren’t disclosed in the
release. It comes after the  University of Texas  signed a 20-year
contract with Walt Disney Co.’s ESPN unit that guaranteed the
school an average of $15 million a year for building the
Longhorn Network around its sports teams.  To contact the reporter on this story:
