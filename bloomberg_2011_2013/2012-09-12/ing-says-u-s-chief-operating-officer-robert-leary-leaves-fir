ING Groep NV (INGA) , the largest Dutch
financial-services firm, said U.S. Chief Operating Officer
Robert Leary has left the firm amid efforts to separate the
company from its North American businesses.  Leary will be replaced as COO by Alain Karaoglan, most
recently a finance and strategy executive, Dana Ripley, a
spokesman for the Amsterdam-based bank, said in a phone
interview. Rodney Martin, chief executive officer of U.S.
operations, and finance chief Ewout Steenbergen will remain with
the firm, which offers retirement, investment management and
insurance products in the world’s largest economy, Ripley said.  ING agreed to separate the U.S. and European insurance
businesses from its banking units by the end of 2013 to gain
European Commission approval for a government bailout. The firm
reached agreements to sell its U.S. and Canadian online banks
this year and are considering an initial public offering for the
U.S. unit, Ripley said.  ING’s U.S. businesses serve about 13 million customers,
according to its website, and had $453 billion in assets under
management and administration as of June 30, Ripley said.  Reuters reported Leary’s departure yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
