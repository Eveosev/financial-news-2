The European Union is funding a
945,000-euro ($1.2 million) water project in the disputed South
Ossetia area of  Georgia  that includes reconstructing a dam,
installing a pump driving irrigation water from one village to
another and fixing potable water lines.  The one-year initiative “is the result of an understanding
reached by the participants in the Geneva talks, who recognize
the need to facilitate access to potable and irrigation water
for the communities,” the EU delegation to Georgia said in a
news release from Tbilisi.  The project in the region riven by the 2008 conflict
between Russia and Georgia will be implemented by OSCE, the
Organization for Security and Co-operation in  Europe , according
to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
