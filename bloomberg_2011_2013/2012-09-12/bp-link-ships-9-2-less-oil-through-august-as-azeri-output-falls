The BP Plc-led Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan
pipeline delivered 9.2 percent less oil in the first eight
months of the year as  Azerbaijan ’s crude production declined.  The BTC link shipped 20.66 million metric tons of oil
through August, down from 22.76 million tons a year earlier,
according to data published today on the  website  of State Oil
Co. of Azerbaijan, or Socar.  The pipeline, which connects BP’s Sangachal terminal south
of the Azeri capital of Baku to  Turkey ’s Mediterranean port of
Ceyhan through  Georgia , exports oil from the offshore Azeri-
Chirag-Guneshli and Shah Deniz fields, also operated by BP. It
can pump 1.2 million barrels of oil a day.  Azerbaijan’s crude oil production declined in the first
half of the year by 7.1 percent to 22.2 million tons, the State
Statistics Committee said in July. The third-largest oil
producer in the former  Soviet Union  pumped 45.6 million tons of
oil last year, a decline of 10.2 percent from the previous year.  Azerbaijan exports smaller volumes of oil through the Baku-
Novorossiysk and BP-led Baku-Supsa pipelines and by rail as
well.  To contact the reporter on this story:
