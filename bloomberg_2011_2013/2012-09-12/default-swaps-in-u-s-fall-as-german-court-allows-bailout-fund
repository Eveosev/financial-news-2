A gauge of corporate credit risk
decreased to the least since April as a German court allowed
ratification of a euro-area bailout fund.  The Markit CDX North America Investment Grade Index, a
credit-default swaps benchmark that investors use to hedge
against losses on company debt or to speculate on
creditworthiness, declined 2.6 basis points to a mid-price of
90.9 basis points at 5:03 p.m. in  New York , according to prices
compiled by Bloomberg. Credit swaps tied to  Chesapeake Energy
Corp. (CHK)  dropped to the least since April.  The swaps index declined as  Germany ’s Federal
Constitutional Court cleared the way for ratification of the
European Stability Mechanism, saying the country’s 190 billion-
euro ($245 billion) contribution can’t be increased without
legislative approval. The U.S. Federal Reserve began a two-day
meeting today amid speculation policy makers will provide more
stimulus, which might ease concern that companies will struggle
to make debt repayments amid a slowing economy.  “Some of these roadblocks are falling away,” Mark Hudoff,
who helps oversee more than $1 billion in high-yield debt as a
 money manager  at Los Angeles-based Hotchkis & Wiley Capital
Management, said in a telephone interview. “I could see why
people are getting more enthused about the asset class.”  Chesapeake Swaps  The credit swaps index, which typically falls as investor
confidence improves and rises as it deteriorates, has declined
from a two-week high of 102.9 basis points on Aug. 30. It closed
at the lowest level since April 3. The contracts pay the buyer
face value if a borrower fails to meet its obligations, less the
value of the defaulted debt. A basis point equals $1,000
annually on a contract protecting $10 million.  Credit swaps tied to Chesapeake declined to the lowest
since April 17 after the energy producer agreed to sell portions
of oil and natural-gas fields and other assets to narrow a cash-
flow shortfall. The contracts declined 40.6 basis points, the
most since Aug. 7, to 559.1 basis points, according to data
provider CMA, which is owned by McGraw-Hill Cos. and compiles
prices quoted by dealers in the privately negotiated market.  The company, based in  Oklahoma City , agreed to sell
portions of fields in the Permian Basin of  Texas  and  New Mexico 
and other assets in a series of transactions for $6.9 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
