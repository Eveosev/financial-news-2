TNK-BP, the Russian crude producer
half-owned by  BP Plc (BP/) , is holding talks on selling its Linik oil
refinery in  Ukraine , after struggling to keep the plant
profitable in the face of cheap fuel imports.  Several offers have been made, TNK-BP Executive Director
 German Khan  told reporters today in Moscow, without naming the
potential buyers. Khan is one of the billionaire shareholders
who own the other 50 percent of TNK-BP.  TNK-BP decided to cut half of its staff in Ukraine and
split the refinery into a separate unit after the operations
lost money in the previous two years, according to an April 9
statement. The Linik refinery, in the city of Lisichansk, was
halted indefinitely in March and the company’s retail outlets
switched to imports, Khan said April 12.  The Moscow-based company had sought the introduction of
quotas or duties on imported fuels from Ukraine’s government.
Ukrainian refineries run by TNK-BP and Russian oil producer OAO
Lukoil suffer from cheap imports from Belarus and  Kazakhstan ,
the  International Energy Agency  said in February of last year.  The Ukrainian operations had a net loss of $68 million in
2010 and $23 million last year, according to the April 9
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
