Germany ’s highest court will
probably back the euro region’s future permanent bailout fund in
today’s ruling while giving the country’s parliament more
control, Free Democratic lawmaker Otto Fricke said.  The court “is going to say ‘yes, we’re going to let things
through but we have to do some safeguards,’ especially to
strengthen parliament once more, and especially to have a
control, which is very important, on the budget rights of the
parliament,” Fricke said in a Bloomberg Television interview.  The court may pave the way for a referendum in Germany on
the transfer of power to the European level because changing the
constitution “a little bit” would not be enough, said Fricke,
budget spokesman for his party,  Chancellor Angela Merkel ’s
coalition partner.  The future fund, the European Stability Mechanism, will
offer loans to euro-member states and may buy their bonds to
lower borrowing costs. If Germany can’t ratify the ESM treaty
and join, the mechanism may not be created and other bailout
measures might be thrown into doubt.  To contact the reporters on this story:
