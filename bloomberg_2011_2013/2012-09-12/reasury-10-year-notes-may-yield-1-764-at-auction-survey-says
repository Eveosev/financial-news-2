The Treasury’s $21 billion sale of
10-year notes may draw a yield of 1.764 percent, according to

sale yield of 1.459 percent.  The August auction’s  bid-to-cover ratio , which gauges
demand by comparing the amount bid with the amount offered, was
2.49, the lowest level since August 2009. The average ratio at
the past 10 sales was 3.09.  Indirect bidders , a class of investors that includes
foreign central banks, bought 40.6 percent of the notes at the
previous offering, compared with an average of 42 percent for
the past 10 auctions.  Direct bidders, non-primary-dealer investors that place
their bids directly with the Treasury, purchased 5.2 percent of
the offering in August, the fewest since February 2011. That
