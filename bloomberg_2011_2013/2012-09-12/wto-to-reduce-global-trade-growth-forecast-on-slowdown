The  World Trade Organization  will
scale back its forecast for global trade growth amid the
economic slowdown, WTO Director-General Pascal Lamy said.  “World trade this year will go lower than we had forecast
some six months ago,” Lamy said today at a press conference in
Rome. The WTO, which in April projected growth of 3.7 percent,
will probably lower the forecast next week, he said.  Growth has suffered this year amid the European debt crisis
and a U.S. recovery hampered by unemployment that Federal
Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  last month called a “grave
concern.” Euro-area gross domestic product will drop 0.4
percent this year, the European Central Bank said on Sept. 6,
compared with a previous forecast of 0.1 percent.  Lamy spoke to reporters with Italian Prime Minister  Mario Monti .  To contact the reporters on this story:
