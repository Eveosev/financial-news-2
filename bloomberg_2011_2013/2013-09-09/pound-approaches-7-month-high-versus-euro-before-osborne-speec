The pound rose to its highest level
versus the dollar in 12 weeks as U.K. Chancellor of the
Exchequer  George Osborne  said Britain’s economy is turning a
corner and is in the early stages of a recovery.  Sterling was within 0.5 percent of a seven-month high
versus the euro before a report on Sept. 11 economists said will
show U.K. jobless claims fell last month. Unemployment held at
7.8 percent in July, according to a separate Bloomberg survey,
above the  Bank of England ’s 7 percent threshold for assessing
 interest rates . Gilts were little changed before the Debt
Management Office sells 6.5 billion pounds ($10.2 billion) of
 government bonds  due in 2023 and 2044 this week.  “I am optimistic about sterling,” said  Steve Barrow , the
head of Group-of-10 research at Standard Bank Plc in  London .
“The habit has been for U.K. data to come out stronger than
expectations and so you are more likely to run with a position
in the currency. The momentum is with employment.”  The pound rose 0.6 percent to $1.5722 at 4:33 p.m. London
time after advancing to $1.5733, the highest since June 17.
Sterling was little changed at 84.30 pence per euro after
appreciating to 83.92 pence on Sept. 6, its strongest level
since Jan. 24.  The pound has risen 7.3 percent in the past six months, the
best performer among 10 major currencies tracked by Bloomberg
Correlation-Weighted Indexes, amid optimism U.K. growth is
accelerating. The dollar gained 1.3 percent and the euro
advanced 3.4 percent.  ‘Early Stages’  “These are still the early stages of recovery,” Osborne
said today in London. “Avoiding an unintentional and premature
tightening of financial conditions,” while “staying the course
with our deficit-reduction plan” will help counter domestic
risks to growth.  Osborne’s comments come a month after Bank of England
Governor  Mark Carney  signaled interest rates won’t rise before
late 2016. While investors are betting that rates will increase
before then, the chancellor said the central bank’s message is
getting through to consumers and executives and will help
strengthen confidence.  “Some have interpreted more recent increases in gilt
yields as a sign that forward guidance has somehow failed, but
that is, I believe, a misunderstanding,” Osborne said. Recent
market movements “vindicate the need for guidance: the
counterfactual would have been even bigger increases in yields
in response to positive economic data,” he said.  Gilt Yields  Benchmark 10-year  gilts yielded  2.94 percent after reaching
3.01 percent on Sept. 5, the highest since July 2011. The price
of the 2.25 percent security due September 2023 was at 94.05.  The U.K. is scheduled to sell 2.75 billion pounds of 30-year bonds tomorrow and 3.75 billion pounds of 10-year gilts on
Thursday. The debt office last auctioned benchmark 10-year
securities on July 2 at an average yield of 2.584 percent and
allotted 30-year bonds on July 11 at 3.553 percent.  Short-sterling futures rose as investors pared bets that
borrowing costs will increase. The implied yield on the contract
expiring in September 2016 fell three basis points to 2.40
percent.  Gilts lost 4.5 percent this year through Sept. 6, according
to Bloomberg World Bond Indexes, underperforming German
securities, which dropped 2.6 percent, and Treasuries, which
declined 4 percent, the indexes show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
