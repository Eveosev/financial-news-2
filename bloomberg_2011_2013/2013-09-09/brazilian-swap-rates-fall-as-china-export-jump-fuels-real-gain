Brazil ’s swap rates fell for a
fourth day as investors speculated that a rebound in the
currency will help curb inflation and allow policy makers to
limit borrowing-cost increases.  Rates on the swaps contract due in January 2015 fell seven
basis points, or 0.07 percentage point, to 10.22 percent at
11:38 a.m. in Sao Paulo. The real advanced 0.9 percent to 2.2866
per dollar after gaining 3.4 percent last week, the most since
January 2012.  The currency strengthened after data showed exports from
 China , the country’s biggest trading partner, rose more than
economists forecast. Brazil’s central bank has lifted benchmark
borrowing costs 1.75 percentage point this year to 9 percent.  “More growth abroad favors commodity prices and gives
Brazil some breathing room,”  Jankiel Santos , the chief
economist at Banco Espirito Santo de Investimentos, said by
phone from Sao Paulo. The real at 2.30 per dollar “gives an
impression that the rate hikes will be less intense,” he said.  The central bank sold 10,000 foreign-exchange swap
contracts worth $497.6 million today, part of a $60 billion
intervention program to support the real announced last month.  The real has lost 6.8 percent in the past three months, the
most among 16 major currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  Policy makers on Aug. 28 raised the benchmark Selic by a
half-percentage point to 9 percent, the fourth straight increase
and the fastest pace of monetary tightening of any major world
economy tracked by Bloomberg.  Annual inflation as measured by the IPCA index decelerated
in August to 6.09 percent, the slowest since December, the
national statistics agency said Sept. 6. Brazil’s central bank
targets annual inflation at 4.5 percent, plus or minus 2
percentage points.  The central bank considers the current pace of key rate
increases to be appropriate, as a weaker real pressures short-term inflation, policy makers said in the minutes to their Aug.
