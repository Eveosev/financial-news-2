Copper rose for a third session, the
longest rally in a month, as a bigger-than-projected increase in
August exports added to evidence of resurgent growth in  China ,
the world’s largest user of the metal.  Shipments from China gained 7.2 percent from August 2012,
customs figures showed yesterday, compared with the 5.5 percent
median estimate from analysts surveyed by  Bloomberg News . An
official Chinese manufacturing gauge published Sept. 1 reached a
16-month high. Copper prices are down 10 percent this year,
partly on concern global demand would slow.  “We’re seeing some decent reports coming out of China, and
that’s been enough to lift copper,” Jeffrey Friedman, a senior
commodity broker at RJO Futures in  Chicago , said in a telephone
interview. “People are saying that at least for now, China
seems to be improving after some signs of slowing a few months
ago.”  Copper futures for delivery in December added 0.5 percent
to settle at $3.278 a pound at 1:15 p.m. on the Comex in  New
York . The three-session rally was the longest for the contract
since Aug. 2. Prices climbed 0.9 percent last week, and are up
7.2 percent this quarter.  On the London Metal Exchange, copper for delivery in three
months rose 0.5 percent to $7,196 a metric tons ($3.26 a pound).  Stockpiles monitored by the LME declined 0.9 percent to
594,625 tons, daily exchange data showed. Orders to remove the
metal from the warehouses fell 0.1 percent to 285,350 tons.  Money managers  reduced  their net-long position, or bets on
higher Comex copper prices, by 37 percent to 8,211 contracts in
the week ended Sept. 3, according to U.S. Commodity Futures
Trading Commission data.  Aluminum, lead, nickel, tin and zinc slid in  London .  To contact the reporters on this story:
