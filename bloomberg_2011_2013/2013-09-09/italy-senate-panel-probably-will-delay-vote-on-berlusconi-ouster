An Italian Senate panel that must
decide whether to expel former Italian Prime Minister  Silvio Berlusconi  delayed a vote on the issue after its first review
today.  “We will meet again tomorrow at 8 p.m.,” the panel head
Dario Stefano told reporters in Rome after the five-hour
meeting. The 23-member panel will keep discussing legal and
procedural issues outlined in a report presented today by
Senator Andrea Augello of Berlusconi’s People of Liberty Party
or PDL, Stefano also said.  Berlusconi’s possible expulsion following his definitive
conviction for  tax fraud  last month threatens to fracture Prime
Minister Enrico Letta’s coalition. On Aug. 30 Berlusconi said
that the PDL may withdraw its support for the government if the
senators of Letta’s Democratic Party vote to oust the former
premier from Parliament.  Lawyers for Berlusconi appealed to the Strasbourg-based
Court of Human rights to review an Italian law passed in
December that bans convicted politicians from remaining in
office or running for election. The appeal may affect the
decision on the expulsion, panel member Lucio Malan of
Berlusconi’s party told reporters earlier today.  A key vote on the expulsion in the committee may take place
tomorrow, Stefano said. The full Senate will then have the final
word on the matter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
