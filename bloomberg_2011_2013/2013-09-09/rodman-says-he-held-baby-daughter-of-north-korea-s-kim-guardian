Retired U.S. basketball All-Star
Dennis Rodman spent time by the sea with Kim Jong Un during a
recent visit to North Korea, holding the dictator’s daughter and
sharing many meals, the  Guardian newspaper  reported.  Kim is a good father to his baby daughter Ju-ae, Rodman
said in an interview, adding that he spoke with the leader’s
wife, Ri Sol Ju, the Guardian reported today. The two discussed
holding a U.S.-North Korea basketball game to build trust,
according to  the newspaper .  Rodman, 52, said he had a relaxing time with Kim’s family,
sharing meals and drinks and discussing the ideas for the U.S.-
North Korea basketball game, according to the Guardian. Rodman
is a “friend to the nation” and can return to North Korea
anytime to “rest and enjoy pleasant days,” the official Korean
Central News Agency said Sept. 7.  Rodman said on his verified Twitter Inc. account today that
he had just returned from North Korea. His trip, the second to
the country, began Sept. 3. There was no word on the fate of
Kenneth Bae, a U.S tour operator who has been held in North
Korea since November.  Speaking to reporters as he passed through Beijing after
leaving North Korea, Rodman said it wasn’t his job to talk about
Bae, according to  CNN . He said to ask President  Barack Obama  or
former Secretary of State  Hillary Clinton  about Bae, CNN
reported.  Rodman won five National Basketball Association
championships and was inducted into the  Basketball Hall of Fame 
in 2011.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
