Chong Hing Bank Ltd. (1111) , Hong Kong’s
smallest family-run lender, said its controlling shareholder is
still holding talks to sell a stake in the lender.  The owner of  Liu Chong Hing Investment (194)  Ltd., the bank’s
parent company, “remains in dialogue with certain independent
third parties” regarding a possible sale, the companies said in
a  joint statement  today. Liu Chong Hing is controlled by the
bank’s founding Liu family.  The announcement follows a statement last month that a
buyer had approached the owners. Takeover speculation has
mounted since November, when Lau Wai-man was named the first
chief executive officer of the bank from outside the family,
which controls about 60 percent of the lender. Shares of Chong
Hing Bank have doubled since his Nov. 28 appointment.  The controlling shareholder “has not reached any
commitment nor entered into any agreements” on a sale and will
provide monthly updates until there is a decision on whether to
make an offer or not, according to today’s statement.  The lender fell 0.2 percent to HK$29.45 at 9:39 a.m. in
Hong Kong, while the benchmark Hang Seng Index gained 0.9
percent.  A bid for the family’s stake in Chong Hing Bank could be
HK$40 a share, or about 2.3 times book value, Oriental Daily
News reported last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
