Bucher Industries AG (BUCN) , the Swiss
maker of agricultural machinery, plans to acquire  Jetter AG (JTT) ,
valuing the German maker of automation systems at about 23
million euros ($30 million).  Bucher offered 7 euros per share, 70 percent higher than
the price of Jetter stock on Sept. 6, Niederweningen-based
Bucher said today in a  statement . Bucher, which already owns a
 20 percent stake  in Ludwigsburg-based Jetter, said the offer is
subject to approval by antitrust authorities.  The takeover of Jetter, which makes programmable logic
controllers and motion systems used to make factories more
efficient, will give Bucher a foothold in industrial automation.
Jetter has supplied the Swiss company since 2002 and gets about
half of its sales from Bucher.  Jetter will be consolidated under the Bucher Specials
segment where it will continue to be managed separately, Bucher
said, adding that it will provide know-how and financial support
to improve profitability at the company.  Jetterâ€™s executives support the offer and founder Martin
Jetter plans to resign from the management board as of Dec. 31
to be replaced as chief executive officer by Christian Benz, the
company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
