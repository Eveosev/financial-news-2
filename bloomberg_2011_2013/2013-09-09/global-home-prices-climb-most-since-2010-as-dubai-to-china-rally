Global house prices rose by an
average of 2.4 percent in the second quarter, the biggest
increase in three years, as Dubai and Asian markets including
Hong Kong and mainland China rallied, Knight Frank LLP said.  Dubai had the largest increase, with prices surging 21.7
percent from a year earlier, the London-based property broker
said today in a report. Taiwan recorded the biggest jump
compared with the previous quarter, with a 7.4 percent gain.  Turkey , Europe’s strongest performer, saw prices rise 12.2
percent from last year, while  Greece  was the continent’s weakest
with an 11.5 percent drop in values.  “For the first time since 2010, European countries
recorded positive annual price growth,” analyst Kate Everett-Allen wrote in the report. “However, the average 0.7 percent
uplift over the past 12 months masks a sharp divergence in
performance between individual countries.”  The global credit crisis six years ago roiled housing
markets across the world. Dubai had one of the world’s worst
property crashes, with prices slumping by as much as 65 percent
on average as transactions dried up. Prices rose in 37 of the 55
countries tracked by the index, compared with an increase in 27
two years ago, Knight Frank said.  Home prices in the U.S. increased 7.1 percent in the second
quarter from the previous three months, the second consecutive
quarterly rise. Prices in the U.K. advanced 2.6 percent in the
period.  Hong Kong climbed 19.1 percent and  China  gained 14.8
percent in the last 12 months. Though the annual growth was
among the world’s highest, China’s prices were unchanged in the
second quarter from the first and Hong Kong rose 1.2 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
