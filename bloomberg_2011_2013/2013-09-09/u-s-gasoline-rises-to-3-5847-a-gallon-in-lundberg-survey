The average price for regular
gasoline at U.S. pumps rose 2.61 cents in the past two weeks to
$3.5847 a gallon, according to Lundberg Survey Inc.  The survey covers the period ended Sept. 6 and is based on
information obtained from about 2,500 filling stations by the
Camarillo, California-based company.  The average, which reached a year-to-date peak of $3.795 in
the period ended Feb. 22, is about 25 cents below the year-earlier price of $3.8376 a gallon.  “The issue of U.S. monetary policy combined with  Syria 
jitters added strength to prices,”  Trilby Lundberg , president
of Lundberg Survey, said in a telephone interview. “Gasoline
prices will not necessarily continue rising from here. It will
depend mostly on what crude-oil prices do.”  The highest price for gasoline in the lower 48 U.S. states
among the markets surveyed was in  Chicago , where the average
price was $3.92 a gallon, Lundberg said.  The lowest price was in Tucson, Arizona, where customers
paid an average of $3.27 a gallon. Regular gasoline averaged
$3.83 a gallon on  Long Island ,  New York , and $3.85 in  Los
Angeles .  Gasoline futures  on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  fell
15.35 cents, or 5.1 percent, to $2.8537 a gallon in the two
weeks to Sept. 6.  Stockpiles Decline  U.S. gasoline stockpiles  slid 1.83 million barrels in the
week ended Aug. 30 to 216 million, according to data from the
Energy Information Administration, the statistical arm of the
Energy Department.  The front-month West Texas Intermediate crude contract
settled at $110.53 a barrel on the Nymex on Sept. 6, the highest
price since May 2011. The contract rose $4.11, or 3.9 percent,
in two weeks.  Crude  inventories  slipped 1.84 million barrels in the week
ended Aug. 30 to 360.2 million. Stockpiles at Cushing,  Oklahoma ,
the delivery point for WTI, fell 1.83 million barrels to 34.8
million, the lowest level since February 2012.  WTI will probably advance next week on the prospect of a
U.S. attack against Syria, improving economic data and falling
American oil stockpiles, a Bloomberg survey showed. Sixteen of
36 analysts, or 44 percent, forecast crude will increase through
Sept. 13. Fifteen respondents, or 42 percent, predicted a
decline and five said that there would be no change.  To contact the reporters on this story:
