Thai Airways International (THAI)  Pcl, the
country’s biggest airline, said 13 people sustained minor
injuries during the evacuation of an Airbus SAS A330-300 that
skidded off the runway after landing in Bangkok late yesterday.  Flight TG 679, traveling from Guangzhou with 288 passengers
and 14 crew, veered off the runway at Bangkok’s  Suvarnabhumi
Airport  after its landing gear malfunctioned on landing, the
company said in an e-mailed statement today.  “Sparks were noticed from the vicinity of the right
landing gear near the engine,” Thai Air President Sorajak Kasemsuvan said in the statement. “The captain took control of
the aircraft until it came to a complete stop and passengers
were evacuated from the aircraft emergency exits.”  The injured passengers were transferred to a local
hospital, Thai Air said. The cause of the accident is being
investigated, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
