Hedge funds and other money managers
reduced  bullish bets  on  Brent crude  for the first time in five
weeks, according to ICE Futures  Europe .  Speculative bets that prices will rise, in futures and
options combined, outnumbered short positions by 224,905 lots in
the week to Sept. 3, the London-based exchange said today in its
weekly Commitments of Traders report. That’s down 3 percent from
last week, when net-longs were at their highest since at least
January 2011, the starting point for the data series.  Bearish positions by producers, merchants, processors and
users of Brent outnumbered bullish positions by 399,726, a 3
percent reduction in their net-short position from a week
earlier, when it was at the largest since the data began.  Brent advanced 1.2 percent in the week to Sept. 3 to
$115.68 a barrel and traded at $115.06 as of 12:14 p.m. local
time today.  ICE publishes, usually each Monday, aggregate numbers for
long and short positions for speculators such as  hedge funds  and
institutional investors, as well as commercial companies that
buy or sell futures to protect against price moves. Analysts and
investors follow changes in speculators’ positions because such
transactions can reflect an expectation of a change in prices.  Swaps dealers reduced net-long positions in Brent to the
lowest since April 9, by 2.6 percent to 186,717.  Money managers’ net-long bets on European gasoil rose for a
third week, climbing 10 percent to 83,433 lots.  To contact the reporter on this story:
