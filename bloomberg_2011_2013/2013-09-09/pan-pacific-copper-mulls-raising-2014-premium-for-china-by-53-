Pan Pacific Copper Co.,  Japan ’s
biggest producer of the metal, said it may increase the premium
it charges customers in China by 53 percent next year as demand
increases.  “We are thinking of annual premiums to Chinese clients at
about $130 a metric ton for 2014,” said Yoshihiro Nishiyama, an
executive officer in the Tokyo-based company’s marketing
department. This compares with the 2013 surcharge of $85 over
the cash price on the London Metal Exchange, he said at a
briefing today.  Codelco , the world’s top producer, is preparing to set its
annual sales premiums for buyers in Europe and Asia, including
China, the world’s top user. The Chilean company, which sets a
benchmark for producers each year, settled its 2013 premium for
 China  at $98 a ton, down from $110 in 2012 as demand slowed.  Pan Pacific may conclude its negotiations for 2014 sales
later this month, Nishiyama said.  Premiums for copper for immediate delivery jumped to $210 a
ton for  Shanghai  in August as stockpiles at bonded warehouses
dropped in China amid a shortage of scrap, he said. The premiums
include insurance and shipping costs.  The company projected the global surplus of refined copper
to increase more than fourfold in 2014, rising for the second
straight year, as Chinese production outpaces demand. Supply
will exceed demand by 305,000 tons, compared with 69,000 tons
estimated for this year, according to Pan Pacific.  Chinese Output  China’s output will increase 9.7 percent to 7 million tons
in 2014, while the country’s demand will grow 4.5 percent to 9.2
million tons, the company said. Pan Pacific forecast that world
mine output will increase by 13 percent to 16.2 million tons in
2014.  Japanese smelters, including Pan Pacific, will negotiate
with mining companies including  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP)  and  Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. (FCX)  later this year to settle processing
fees of next year’s raw material supply.  “With mine supply increasing, we are looking for higher
treatment and refining charges for next year, close to $100 a
ton and 10 cents a pound,” said Shigeru Oi, an executive
officer for raw materials at Pan Pacific. “Electricity bills
have jumped for Japanese smelters, increasing our costs.”  Smelters and mining companies settled 2013 processing fees
at $70 a ton and 7 cents per pound, he said. Spot processing
fees have recently risen to about $80/8 cents, he said.  The fees usually rise when mine supply increases. Treatment
fees are expressed in dollars per ton of concentrate received
and refining fees in cents per pound of copper in the ore. The
fees are deducted from the price paid by smelters to mining
companies for the raw material.  Pan Pacific is the joint venture between JX Nippon Mining &
Metals Corp., a unit of  JX Holdings Inc. , and  Mitsui Mining &
Smelting Co. (5706)   To contact the reporter on this story:
