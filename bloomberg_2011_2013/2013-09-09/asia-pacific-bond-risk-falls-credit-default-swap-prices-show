The cost of insuring corporate and
sovereign bonds in the Asia-Pacific region from non-payment
declined, according to traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  fell 3 basis points to 143 basis points
as of 8:20 a.m. in Hong Kong, Australia & New Zealand Banking
Group Ltd. prices show. The measure is on course for its lowest
close since Aug. 16, according to data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index decreased 2 basis points
to 116 as of 10:23 a.m. in Sydney, according to National
Australia Bank Ltd. The benchmark is set for its lowest close
since Aug. 14, according to CMA, which is owned by McGraw-Hill
Cos. and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the private
market.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index fell 1.5 to 88 basis points
as of 9:21 a.m. in  Tokyo , Citigroup Inc. prices show. The gauge,
which has ranged from 74 to 148.1 this year, is on track for its
lowest close since May 24, according to CMA.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
credit quality. A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
