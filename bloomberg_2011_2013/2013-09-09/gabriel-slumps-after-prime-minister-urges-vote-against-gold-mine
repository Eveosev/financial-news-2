Gabriel Resources Ltd. (GBU)  plunged the
most in 19 years after Romanian Prime Minister Victor Ponta
urged lawmakers to vote to reject plans for the company’s
proposed Rosia Montana gold mine.  Parliament should “quickly vote” on whether to drop the
project as opposition appears insurmountable, Ponta said today.  Shares of the Whitehorse, Yukon-based company fell 43
percent to C$0.84 at 9:42 a.m. in Toronto, after earlier
declining as much as 48 percent, the most intraday since March
1994.  To contact the reporters on this story:
