South Africa  sold $2 billion of
bonds due 2025 in its first international offering in 20 months,
according to a person familiar with the transaction.  The country issued the bonds to yield 315 basis points, or
3.15 percentage points, above U.S. Treasuries, said the person
who asked not to be identified because he isn’t allowed to speak
publicly. South  Africa  is rated BBB, the second-lowest
investment grade, by  Standard & Poor’s  and one level higher by
Moody’s Investors Service.  “Now is the right time,” National Treasury Director-General Lungisa Fuzile, said today in the capital, Pretoria. The
country had initially planned to sell $1.5 billion, according to
Fuzile.  South Africa issued $1.5 billion of 4.67 percent 2024 bonds
in January 2012 to yield 4.665 percent, or 270 basis points
above U.S. Treasuries. Yields on the securities rose 17 basis
points to 5.55 percent at 4:43 p.m.  New York  time.  The central bank forecast the nation’s  economy , Africa’s
biggest, will expand 2 percent this year after expanding 2.58
percent in 2012 as labor unrest in mines shaves 0.3 percentage
point off economic growth, President  Jacob Zuma  said in June.
South Africa, which has the world’s largest-known reserves of
platinum and chrome and is the sixth-largest producer of gold,
relies on minerals for more than 50 percent of its exports.  Deutsche Bank AG, Standard Bank Group Ltd. and FirstRand
Ltd.’s Rand Merchant Bank unit are managing the sale, according
to the person.  To contact the reporters on this story:
