German stocks  dropped, after the
benchmark  DAX Index (DAX)  posted its biggest weekly gain in eight
weeks, as investors awaited a decision from U.S. lawmakers on
whether to take military action in  Syria .  Kabel Deutschland Holding AG (KD8)  slipped 1 percent after a
report that Vodafone Group Plc’s bid for the company may
collapse because of insufficient shareholder support for the
offer. Munich Re added 3.2 percent as Bank of America Corp.’s
Merrill Lynch unit recommended that investors buy the shares.  The DAX Index lost 0.1 percent to 8,265.84 at 9:55 a.m. in
 Frankfurt . The equity benchmark gained 2.1 percent last week as
 manufacturing growth  in the U.S. and China, the world’s two
largest economies, beat projections. The broader HDAX Index also
decreased 0.1 percent today.  U.S. President  Barack Obama  will attempt to persuade a
skeptical Congress this week to support air strikes against the
regime of Bashar al-Assad. He failed to win backing from foreign
leaders at last week’s Group of 20 summit for military action in
response to a chemical-weapons attack.  China’s exports  rose 7.2 percent in August from a year
earlier, according to a report from the General Administration
of Customs in Beijing. That exceeded the 5.5 percent  median
estimate  of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
