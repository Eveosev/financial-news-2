The  New York City Opera  board said
it continues to back General Manager George Steel after he
announced that the company needs to raise $7 million this month
or the first opera of the season would be the last.  Members of the orchestra called on Steel, who took over in
February 2009 and is also artistic director, to resign. The
opera “finds itself on the brink of total fiscal failure,”
said Gail Kruvand, chairwoman of the orchestra’s negotiating
committee, in an e-mail yesterday.  Two years ago, Steel oversaw the “dismembering” of the
onetime neighbor of the Metropolitan Opera, in the words of
protesters such as director Hal Prince. Steel slashed
productions and abandoned the company's Lincoln Center home
among its cost-cutting measures.  “The precipitous move from Lincoln Center in 2011
alienated patrons and audience members alike,” Kruvand said.  Chuck Wall, chairman of the board and a former vice
chairman of  Philip Morris International (PM) , the world’s largest
publicly traded tobacco company, said Steel has done a “heroic
job.”  “George has, and always has had, the complete support of
the board,” Wall said in a statement yesterday forwarded by
 Risa Heller , an opera spokeswoman.  The $7 million that New York City Opera needs this month is
nearly seven times the ticket sales of 2011-12.  Founded in 1943, it has taken to the online fund raiser
 Kickstarter  to raise $1 million of the $7 million. As of 6:50
p.m. eastern time Sunday, it raised $8,318 from 102 backers.  “We have reached a crossroads: Simply put, we need
capitalization, both for the rest of this season and for the
company to continue forward on solid financial footing,” Steel
said in a statement.  The opera needs an additional $13 million by year-end to
pay for future seasons, it said.  “Anna Nicole” is to begin Sept. 17 at the  Brooklyn 
Academy of Music. The show about the surgically enhanced heiress
Anna Nicole Smith had a well-reviewed premiere at  London ’s Royal
Opera House. The remainder of the season is scheduled for El
Museo del Barrio in upper  Manhattan , St. Ann’s Warehouse in
Brooklyn and New York City Center.  In 2011-12, the company received $9.7 million in grants and
contributions, half of the amount of five years earlier,
according to audited financial statements. Ticket sales in
2011-12 were $1.1 million, down two-thirds from the previous
season.  It received permission in late 2008 and early 2009 from the
New York attorney general to borrow $24 million from its
endowment. Its investment income in 2011-12 was $150,000, down
from $4 million in 2006-7.  Muse highlights include Elin McCoy on wine, Warwick Thompson on U.K. theater and Scott Reyburn on auctions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
