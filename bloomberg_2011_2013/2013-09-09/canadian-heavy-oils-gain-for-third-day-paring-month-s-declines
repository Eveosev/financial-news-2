Canadian heavy oil grades
strengthened on the  spot market  for a third day, retracing
declines earlier in the month.  Western Canadian Select, a blend of heavy oil-sands
bitumen, pared its discount to U.S. benchmark West Texas
Intermediate crude by 80 cents to $24.10 a barrel, according to
Calgary oil broker Net Energy Inc. Cold Lake, another Canadian
heavy oil grade, strengthened 70 cents to a $25.50 discount.  WCS has been trending lower since reaching a $9.25 discount
June 12 amid supply disruptions in  Alberta . The discount
increased to $25.75 on Sept. 4, the widest in six months,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Maintenance at upgraders and refineries in Alberta and the
Midwest may reduce demand. Plants shutting for work include
 Husky Energy Inc.’s (HSE)  82,000-barrel-a-day Lloydminster  upgrader ,
which processes heavy crude into lighter grades. It will shut
for 45 days starting in early September, executives said on an
earnings call last month.  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  said last week on a community hot
line that it shut its Scotford  refinery , which can process
97,870 barrels a day, for scheduled work.  Suncor Energy Inc. said Aug. 1 that it’s planning four to
five weeks of maintenance on the 110,000-barrel-a-day Unit 2 at
the Fort McMurray  upgrader .  Northern Tier Energy LP (NTI) ’s 74,000-barrel-a-day St. Paul Park
 refinery  in Minnesota plans to halt a fluid catalytic cracker
during October, the company said during its earnings conference
call in August.  BP Plc (BP/) ’s Whiting,  Indiana ,  refinery  will shut a 75,000-barrel-a-day crude unit for 30 days of repairs starting in the
third week of September, according to IIR Energy, a Sugar Land,
Texas, energy information provider.  Syncrude, a Canadian light crude processed from oil-sands
bitumen, was unchanged at a $1.20 premium over WTI, Net Energy
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
