Hong Kong   stocks  gained, with the
benchmark index extending its biggest weekly gain in a year,
after China’s export growth exceeded estimates, boosting
confidence in the nation’s economic recovery.  The  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  rose 0.7 percent to 22,777.17 as of
9:31 a.m. in Hong Kong, with all but nine shares on the 50-member gauge advancing. The  Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI) 
added 1.1 percent to 10,451.48.  The  Hang Seng Index  pared its decline this year to 0.2
percent through Sept. 6 as manufacturing data from around the
world added to signs of a global economic recovery. The gauge
traded at 10.8 times estimated earnings, compared with 15 for
the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  China ’s exports rose 7.2 percent from a year earlier, the
 General Administration of Customs  said in Beijing yesterday.
That compares with the 5.5 percent median estimate in a
Bloomberg News survey and July’s 5.1 percent gain. Data today
showed that the nation’s consumer prices rose 2.6 percent from a
year earlier, slowing from July’s 2.7 increase.  The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index, also known as the H-share index, has risen 16 percent from its low in June through
Sept. 6. The measure traded at 1.24 times book value, compared
with a five-year average of 1.77.  China’s economy “will maintain its sustained and healthy
growth,” with expansion around a 7.5 percent “lower limit”
intended to ensure steady growth and employment, Premier  Li
Keqiang  wrote in an opinion article in the Financial Times.  Futures on the  S&P 500  rose 0.1 percent. The measure was
little changed in New York on Sept. 6 as an escalation in
tension over Syria overshadowed slower-than-forecast jobs growth
that eased concern about reductions in Federal Reserve stimulus.
Employers added 169,000 workers last month, missing the median
estimate of 180,000 in a Bloomberg survey.  The Fed has said any reduction in stimulus will be tied to
a sustained recovery in U.S. employment. The central bank will
decide to taper its monthly bond purchases by $10 billion in
September to $75 billion, according to the median of 34
responses on Sept. 6 to a Bloomberg survey. The Federal Open
Market Committee holds a two-day meeting on Sept. 17-18.  Al-Arabiya TV reported last week Syrian government forces
shelled Damascus with gas, citing unidentified activists. The
report stoked concern that the U.S. could take military action
in Syria even as President  Barack Obama  acknowledged domestic
and international resistance to his call for a strike. Russian
President  Vladimir Putin  said at the Group of 20 summit that his
nation will assist Syria if strikes are launched.  To contact the reporter on this story:
