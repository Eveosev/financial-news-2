Mexico ’s peso-denominated bonds due
next year rallied, pushing yields to the lowest levels in more
than three months, after data showed consumer prices rose less
than analysts forecast last month.  Yields on the bonds maturing in December 2014 fell eight
basis points, or 0.08 percentage point, to 3.87 percent at 9:00
a.m. in Mexico City, data compiled by Bloomberg show. It’s the
lowest yield on a closing basis since May 22. The peso gained
0.3 percent to 13.1248 per U.S. dollar in Mexico City.  Grupo Financiero Santander Mexico SAB today joined Barclays
Plc in calling for Mexico policy makers to cut the nation’s
reference rate by 0.25 percentage point next month after the
central bank reduced it by that amount on Sept. 6 to a record
low of 3.75 percent.  Annual inflation  in August was 3.46
percent, compared with a median estimate of 3.5 percent among
economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  “With low levels of inflation and weak growth, we see this
possibility that they could cut in October,”  Rafael Camarena ,
an economist at Santander, said by phone from Mexico City. “We
need to be evaluating what the effect on inflation will be”
from the government’s plan to boost tax collection.  While President Enrique Pena Nieto proposed a tax plan
yesterday that the government says would increase government
revenue as a percentage of GDP by 1.4 percentage points next
year and by 2.9 percentage points by 2018, it doesn’t call for
taxes on food and medicine as some analysts projected. Taxing
food and medicines amid the current economic conditions would
hurt Mexican families, Pena Nieto said in a speech yesterday.  The government cut its 2013 growth estimate to 1.8 percent
on Aug. 20 from 3.1 percent after exports stagnated.  Pena Nieto also asked Congress yesterday to approve a
budget for next year with a deficit of 1.5 percent of gross
domestic product, or about 3.5 percent including $27 billion in
proposed investment in state oil producer Petroleos Mexicanos.  To contact the reporter on this story:
