Canadian Finance Minister  Jim Flaherty  said his government will freeze employment insurance
premiums for three years to boost employment.  The measure will cost C$660 million ($636 million) in 2014
and won’t have an impact on the nation’s ability to balance its
books by 2015 because premiums have been increasing more quickly
than budgeted, Flaherty  told  reporters today in Ottawa.  “There is no fiscal impact,” Flaherty said. “It’s very
important for businesses, especially smaller businesses, to have
less overhead.”  Canada ’s labor market is on pace for the slowest growth
since 2001 outside of the last recession. Job gains have
 averaged  12,700 this year, less than half of the 25,900 created
in 2012, as manufacturers and governments cut payrolls.  The employment insurance rate for employees will remain at
C$1.88 per C$100 of insurable earnings in 2014 and won’t exceed
that amount in 2015 and 2016, the finance department said in a
statement.  The government had budgeted for a rate of C$1.98 in 2015
and C$1.93 in 2016, the finance department said in a background
document also released today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
