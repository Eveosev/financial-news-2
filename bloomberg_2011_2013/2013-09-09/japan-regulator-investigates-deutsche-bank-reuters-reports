A Japanese regulator is examining if
 Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  provided entertainment that could be deemed
excessive to pension fund executives,  Reuters  reported, citing
unidentified people familiar with the matter.  The Securities and Exchange Surveillance Commission found
evidence of potential misconduct during a regular audit of
Frankfurt-based Deutsche Bank’s Japanese investment-banking arm,
the  news agency  said, citing the people.  Deutsche Bank started an investigation into the matter
before the SESC began its audit in May and the regulator may not
enforce sanctions, Reuters reported.  The Deutsche Bank inspection is under way and the SESC
can’t comment on the issue, an SESC official said today in
Tokyo, asking not to be identified because of the watchdog’s
policy. The SESC typically makes recommendations on its findings
to Japan’s Financial Services Agency.  Aston Bridgman, a Tokyo-based spokesman for Deutsche Bank
declined to comment when contacted by phone today. Companies
undergoing inspection are not allowed to do so under the
regulator’s policies in Japan.  To contact the reporters on this story:
