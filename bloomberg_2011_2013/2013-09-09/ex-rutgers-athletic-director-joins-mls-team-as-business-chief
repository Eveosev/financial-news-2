Former Rutgers University Athletic
Director Tim Pernetti joined  Major League Soccer ’s  New York 
expansion team as its chief business officer.  MLS in May said the  New York Yankees  would be an investor
in the team, New York City Football Club, which will be
controlled by Manchester City Football Club of the English
Premier League.  Pernetti, who resigned in April in the wake of a scandal
involving the men’s basketball coach, will oversee all business
operations for the club, the team said in a statement.  “I relish the opportunity to be part of a global
organization, and also to use my experience to create a first
class club for  New Yorkers  and one in which they will always
have a voice,” Pernetti said in the statement.  The league’s 20th team is scheduled to begin play in 2015.
The league, team and Yankees are working to find a suitable site
for a soccer-specific stadium. Sites in Queens and the Bronx,
near Yankee Stadium, are among those being considered.  Pernetti, 42, left his post as athletic director after a
telecast of a video showed Mike Rice physically and verbally
attacking players at practices while using gay slurs. Pernetti
said he had seen parts of the video before deciding to suspend
the coach.  Pernetti in his resignation  letter  said his first instinct
was to fire the coach immediately.  “However, Rutgers decided to follow a process involving
university lawyers, human resources professionals, and outside
counsel,” Pernetti wrote. “Following review of the independent
investigative report, the consensus was that university policy
would not justify dismissal.”  Initial Suspension  Rice was initially suspended in December, three weeks after
Rutgers was invited to join the  Big Ten Conference , a move from
the Big East Conference that may increase the school’s athletic-department income by millions of dollars. University President
Robert Barchi kept his job amid faculty calls for his ouster.  The video aired by ESPN showed Rice grabbing and pushing
players, haranguing them with expletive-laden homophobic slurs
and hurling basketballs at their heads.  Pernetti, whose annual salary was $452,769 at the time of
his resignation, was included in a list of five nominees for
athletic director of the year in the 2013 Sports Business
Awards, given by SportsBusiness Journal.  MLS reaped a record $100 million expansion fee for the
team.  Man City in May played fellow English Premier League team
Chelsea, owned by Russian billionaire  Roman Abramovich , in an
exhibition at Yankee Stadium.  To contact the reporter on this story:
