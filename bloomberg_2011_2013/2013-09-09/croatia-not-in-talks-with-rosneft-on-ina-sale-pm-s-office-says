Croatia  is not in talks to sell the
the government’s stake in INA Industrija Nafte d.d. to OAO
Rosneft, the office of Prime Minister  Zoran Milanovic  said today
in an e-mailed statement.  Bloomberg reported on Sept. 6 that Croatia approached the
Russian oil company to take over INA Industrija Nafte d.d. as
the government seeks to solve a dispute with Mol Nyrt. over
control of the Balkan nation’s oil company, citing three people
familiar with the talks.  Hungary’s Mol owns 49.1 percent of the Zagreb-based
refiner, while Croatia holds 44.84 percent. The government of
the European Union’s newest member has struggled to reverse a
2009 contract with Mol arranged by former Prime Minister Ivo
Sanader, who quit office and was later convicted of corruption.  The talks between Mol and the government are expected to
start Sept. 18 in Zagreb. Croatian Economy Minister Ivan
Vrdoljak said on Sept. 5 the government is seeking a new model
to run INA, where control would be proportional to
shareholdings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
