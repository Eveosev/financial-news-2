Jiangxi Copper Co. (358) ,  China ’s largest
smelter of the metal, said it will seek a 43 percent increase in
fees for treating and refining ore next year as global mine
supply increases.  The charges may rise to $100 a metric ton to treat
concentrate and 10 cents a pound to refine metal, Wu Yuneng, a
vice president at the Jiangxi-based company, told reporters on
Sept. 7. The rates for this year were $70 a ton and 7 cents a
pound, he said.  Higher treatment fees would help boost earnings at smelters
and add support to copper prices that may come under pressure
from a global glut in the metal. Futures in  London  tumbled into
a  bear market  in April and fell 9 percent this year as economic
growth slowed in China, the world’s biggest user.  “Fees will advance further next year as the pace of growth
of concentrate is likely to exceed that of new treatment
facilities,” Wu said during a conference in Shanghai.  The charges are deducted from the price paid by smelters to
mining companies for the raw material. Jiangxi Copper on Sept. 6
settled a short-term deal at $99 a metric ton to treat
concentrates of the highest grade, Wu said.  Copper for delivery in three months rose 0.8 percent to
$7,216.50 a ton on the London Metal Exchange as of 5:37 p.m. in
 Shanghai .  Concentrate output will expand 2.6 percent to 17.1 million
tons this year, Morgan Stanley said in July in a report. That
will exceed demand by 53,300 tons, the bank said.  New Output  New output from mines in Oyu Tolgoi in Mongolia, Las Bambas
in  Peru , and Esperanza in  Chile  is estimated to add 3.53 million
tons in global supply from 2012 through 2015, Zhang Mei, a
researcher with China’s Ministry of Land and Resources, told the
conference in Shanghai.  China’s output of refined copper for this year may be
unchanged from 5.6 million tons last year because of a tight
supply of scrap metal, Wu said. The shortage may reduce
production of refined metal by about 350,000 tons, Wu estimated.  Jiangxi may produce 1.2 million tons of refined copper this
year and keep the level for next year, Wu said.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
