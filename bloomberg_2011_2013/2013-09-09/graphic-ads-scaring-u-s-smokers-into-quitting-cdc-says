A missing limb, a hole in the
throat, and a bald, toothless woman with no larynx are among the
images in an anti-smoking campaign that persuaded 1.6 million
people to try to quit cigarettes, U.S. health officials said.  Personal efforts to stop smoking rose 12 percent after the
government-created “Tips From Former Smokers” ads initially
aired on national cable and local television channels last year,
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said today in a
report. Of those who attempted to quit the  habit , 220,000
remained non-smokers by the end of the first three-month ad run.  The $54 million campaign, which included radio and print
ads, was the first federally funded national anti-smoking media
effort. Large stop-smoking campaigns on television typically are
funded by anti-tobacco groups. Smoking is the leading
preventable cause of death in the U.S., and the success of the
ads highlighting the worst effects has led to plans for another
effort next year, said CDC Director Thomas Frieden.  “They show the reality of smoking,” Frieden said in an
interview. “They pull back the examination room curtain and
show the real story of real Americans going through suffering
and disfigurement.”  Almost 44 million people in the U.S. ages 18 and older
smoke, the CDC said. The agency estimated 13.6 million attempted
to quit before the “Tips From Former Smokers” ads ran. During
last year’s ad campaign, calls to 1-800-QUIT-NOW more than
doubled by 200,000 additional calls and 500,000 more people than
normal visited www.smokefree.gov, the CDC said.  Examples Followed  The agency surveyed 3,051 smokers, three-quarters of whom
had seen at least one of the ads, which initially ran from March
2012 to June 2012. Cessation attempts increased to 34.8 percent
from 31.1 percent. The CDC extrapolated based on the results to
determine the 1.6 million additional quitters. About 100,000 of
those people would be sustained quitters, the CDC said.  Frieden said local anti-smoking ad campaigns in New York,
 California  and  Massachusetts  as well as one in  Australia  helped
the CDC determine which tactics work best to get smokers’
attention. Most of the $54 million in funding came from the 2010
Affordable Care Act, he said.  While the CDC has run anti-smoking public service
announcements in the past, major ad buys have been private
endeavors such as the American Legacy Foundation’s Truth
campaign. The effort, aimed at youth and started in 2000, was
funded by the master settlement agreement reached after states
sued tobacco companies.  The CDC also surveyed 2,220 nonsmokers, 5.1 percent who
recommended smokers quit, an increase from 2.6 percent before
the campaign. This means 4.5 million U.S. nonsmokers probably
recommended smoking cessation as a result of the ads, according
to the survey.  Cigarette smoking is responsible for about 1 of 5 deaths in
the U.S., or 440,000 annually, the CDC said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
