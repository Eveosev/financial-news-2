Libya  will offer a third mobile
phone license within three to six months, the country’s
communications and information technology minister said.  The government wants to decrease its hold on the
telecommunications sector to “get the private sector more
involved, whether local or foreign,” Usama Siala said in a
telephone interview from the capital, Tripoli. The two licensed
operators, Libyana and Al Madar, are fully state-owned.  Talks with the economy ministry and its affiliated
investment authority aim to make the license “attractive to the
entrant,” Siala said, without elaborating.  The telecommunications sector of the nation sitting on
 Africa ’s largest oil reserves was badly damaged during the 2011
revolution that ousted the late  Muammar Qaddafi . Infrastructure
has been repaired, Siala said.  About 10 million SIM cards have been sold in Libya, where
there are 6 million active subscribers, the minister said. A
third operator will bring “world experience and help improve
the quality of service to our subscribers,” Siala said.  The third operator may agree to use existing towers or will
build new ones if it decides to cover new areas, he said.  In 2009, United Arab Emirates-based Etisalat bid $825
million to obtain the third license. Qaddafi’s government
canceled the tender.  To contact the reporter on this story:
