Cia. de Saneamento Basico do Estado
de Sao Paulo,  Brazil ’s biggest water utility, request of three
months to evaluate, clarify and make proper changes in its
regulatory payment base was accepted by Sao Paulo state water
and energy regulator Arsesp, according to a statement e-mailed
by the company’s investor relations department.  Arsesp defined the deadline starting date as Sept. 5,
according to the statement. The regulator suspended a scheduled
rate review in July because it didn’t have enough board members
to proceed. It maintained the suspension after finding
“inconsistencies” in documents the company submitted.  Sabesp, as the utility is known, said in a conference call
on Sept. 6 that the tariff process will probably be finalized in
2014. The annual tariff adjustment would be positive if approved
by Arsesp, Bradesco analysts Vladimir Pinto and Renata Cristovao
wrote in a Sept. 6 report. If the process is delayed until next
year, “there is a higher chance that the decision could be
impacted by political factors, especially in an election year”,
they wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
