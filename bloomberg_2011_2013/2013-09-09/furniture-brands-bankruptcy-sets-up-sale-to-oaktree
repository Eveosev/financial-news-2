Furniture Brands International Inc. (FBNI) ,
maker of the Broyhill, Lane and Thomasville home-furnishing
lines, sought  bankruptcy protection  from creditors with a deal
to sell most of its assets to Oaktree Capital Management LP.  The company, based in St. Louis, listed assets of
$546.7 million and debt of $550.1 million in Chapter 11
documents filed today in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Wilmington,
 Delaware . Eighteen affiliates also already have sought or will
seek court protection.  Oaktree has agreed to provide as much as $140 million in
financing to help fund operations while the company pursues the
sale, which will be subject to court approval and a supervised
auction process that may draw other bidders, according to a
company statement.  “Our Chapter 11 process represents the best long-term
solution for Furniture Brands to address its liquidity
challenges, strengthen its operations and continue to provide
our customers with the highest quality products,” Chief
Executive Officer Ralph Scozzafava said in the statement.  The Oaktree acquisition proposal doesn’t include the Lane
brand. Furniture Brands said it’s engaged with other potential
buyers for that line.  Furniture Brands plunged as much as 70 percent to 17 cents
in over-the-counter  trading  after the filing was reported. The
shares had dropped more than 92 percent this year before today.  The case is In re Furniture Brands International Inc., 13-12329,  U.S. Bankruptcy Court , District of Delaware (Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
