South African wheat futures fell to
the lowest level in more than two weeks as the rand gained
against the dollar, making imports of the cereal cheaper.  Wheat for delivery in December, the most active contract,
dropped 0.6 percent to 3,366 rand ($336) a metric ton, the
lowest since Aug. 21, by the close on the South African Futures
Exchange in Johannesburg.  The rand rose for a fourth day to the highest in more than
three weeks after Chinese trade data beat forecasts, boosting
growth prospects for the biggest buyer of South African raw
materials. The currency later erased the gain.  “If you calculate the import parity, you will see it shows
that the  exchange rate  played the dominant role for today’s
movement,” Thys Grobbelaar, an analyst at Klerksdorp, South
Africa-based Senwes Ltd., said by phone.  JSE Ltd., which manages  South Africa ’s commodities
exchange, raised the wheat transport reference price by 33
percent to 560 rand a ton, an e-mailed statement showed Sept. 6.
The new rate takes effect Oct. 1.  South  Africa  is a net importer of wheat and sub-Saharan
Africa’s largest producer of the grain after  Ethiopia , as well
as the region’s biggest importer after Nigeria and  Sudan ,
according to U.S. Department of Agriculture data.  White corn for delivery in December was unchanged at 2,388
rand a ton, while the yellow variety for the same delivery month
fell 0.5 percent to 2,158 rand a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
