Brazil , the world’s largest coffee
producer and exporter, is considering allowing imports of the
commodity to help improve the blends roasted in the country.  Brazil wants to boost exports of roasted blends, while
reducing the sale of green beans and start importing coffee from
countries such as  Colombia  to blend with its own beans, Trade
Minister Fernando Pimentel said.  “We have to improve our blend, and that means bringing at
least 30 percent of coffee from elsewhere to mix with our own,”
Pimentel told reporters today at a conference in  Belo Horizonte ,
Brazil. “This means we need to change a law that restricts
green coffee imports.”  Coffee prices have dropped 18 percent this year in  New York 
trading, forcing Brazil to announce a series of measures to help
growers, including more than 3 billion reais ($1.31 billion) in
financing and coffee options auctions of as much as 3 million,
60-kilogram bags of the bean.  “We have fully used all the tools we had in store to help
growers,” Pimentel said. “We need to study ways to create big
trading companies in Brazil so that we are not so vulnerable to
foreign prices.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
