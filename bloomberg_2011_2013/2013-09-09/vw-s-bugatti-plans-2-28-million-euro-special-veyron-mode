Volkswagen AG (VOW) ’s ultra-luxury
Bugatti division presented a new special edition of its Grand
Sport Vitesse model priced at 2.28 million euros ($3 million)
before taxes to complement its high-end sports car offerings.  The carmaker will produce three of the new Jean Bugatti
racer, named after the oldest son of founder Ettore Bugatti, the
Molsheim, France-based company said in a statement released
yesterday at a Frankfurt press conference. The special edition
is based on the Bugatti Veyron 16.4 Grand Sport Vitesse, which
features an 8-liter, 1,200-horsepower W16 engine. It accelerates
to 100 kilometers (62 miles) per hour in 2.6 seconds.  Volkswagen, Europe’s largest carmaker, plans to expand its
range of premium vehicles to reap a larger share of the segment,
where profit margins are richer than for mass-market models.
Earnings from luxury brands helped Wolfsburg, Germany-based VW
cushion the fallout from economic woes in Europe, where demand
for new cars is falling to a 20-year low amid unemployment rates
lingering near record highs.  The Bugatti presentation was part of a VW press event in
Frankfurt yesterday displaying the range of the group’s
offerings that was planned to upstage competitors before the
opening of the International Auto Show, the industry’s largest
in Europe this year. Following press-conference and supplier
days, show is open to the public Sept. 14 through Sept. 22.  To contact the reporter on this story:
