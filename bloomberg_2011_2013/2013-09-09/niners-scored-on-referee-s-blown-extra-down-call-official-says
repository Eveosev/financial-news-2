An officiating error extended a
touchdown-scoring drive for the San Francisco 49ers in their
34-28 season-opening win over the  Green Bay Packers .  Bill Leavy, the head referee for yesterday’s National
Football League game at Candlestick Park in San Francisco, said
he mistakenly ruled that a second-quarter play be done over as a
third down rather than standing as fourth down after offsetting
penalties.  With nine minutes, 30 seconds remaining in the second
quarter and the score tied 7-7, 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick scrambled left and ran out of bounds at the Green Bay
6-yard-line after a four-yard gain. A personal foul was called
against the Packers’  Clay Matthews  for a late hit and
unsportsmanlike conduct penalty was issued to the Niners’ Joe Staley for retaliating.  “On the play where the quarterback went out of bounds and
was hit late out of bounds, and then there was a subsequent hit
by a San Francisco player, the down should have counted,” Leavy
said, according to a statement after the game. “The penalties
were both dead ball and they should have offset at the spot
where the runner went out of bounds. And it would have been
fourth down.”  Instead, Kaepernick found Anquan Boldin for a 10-yard
touchdown on the ensuing 3rd-and-6 play.  The NFL has no further comment, league spokesman  Brian McCarthy  said in an e-mail.  “That’s part of the game,” Packers coach  Mike McCarthy 
said after the loss. “The ball doesn’t always bounce your
way.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
