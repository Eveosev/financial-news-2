Natural gas futures gained in New
York as unusually warm U.S. weather buoyed demand for the power-plant fuel.  Gas rose 2.1 percent after forecasts showed above-normal
temperatures across most of the contiguous U.S. this week
lingering in the central states through Sept. 23, according to
AccuWeather Inc. in  State College ,  Pennsylvania . Bursts of heat
have helped reduce the pace of  supply gains  in the past month.  “We have a little bit of heat in front of us and that has
provided a boost to the market,” said  Gene McGillian , an
analyst and broker at Tradition Energy in  Stamford ,  Connecticut .
“The heat that we are probably going to be seeing in the next
seven to 10 days will limit some of the storage injections.”  Natural gas for October delivery climbed 7.5 cents to
settle at $3.605 per million British thermal units on the  New
York Mercantile Exchange . Volume was 30 percent below the 100-day average at 2:44 p.m. Futures are up 7.6 percent this year.  The discount of October to November futures narrowed 1.3
cents to 7.4 cents. October gas traded 31.6 cents below the
January contract, compared with 33.6 cents on Sept. 6.  November $2.95 puts were the most active options in
electronic trading. They were 0.1 cent lower at 0.6 cent per
million Btu on volume of 3,003 at 2:45 p.m. Calls accounted for
51 percent of trading volume. Implied volatility for October at-the-money options was 29.24 percent at 2:45 p.m., compared with
29.17 percent on Sept. 6.  Hot Weather  The high temperature in Chicago tomorrow may be 94 degrees
Fahrenheit (34 Celsius), 16 above normal, and St. Louis’s high
may be 96 degrees through Sept. 11, AccuWeather said.  New York 
City’s reading that day may be 90 degrees, 13 above the norm.  Power generation accounts for 32 percent of U.S. gas
demand, data show from the Energy Information Administration,
the Energy Department’s statistical arm.  Gas stockpiles  rose 58 billion cubic feet to 3.188 trillion
in the week ended Aug. 30, below the five-year average increase
of 60 billion for the period, according to the EIA. A  supply
deficit  to the five-year average narrowed to 1.4 percent from
1.5 percent, the EIA said. A  surplus  to year-earlier levels
narrowed to 6.2 percent from 7 percent.  LNG Agreements  Freeport LNG Development LP said it has signed binding 20-year agreements with Toshiba Corp. and  South Korea ’s SK E&S LNG
LLC, each for 2.2 million tons per year, for the third train of
its proposed liquefied natural gas export plant in  Texas ,
according to separate statements today.  The Houston-based developer has received approval from the
 Department of Energy  to export LNG from the first two trains of
the project to countries the U.S. does not have free-trade
agreements with, and applications for two additional trains are
pending. Freeport LNG said it expects to receive Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission approval for the first three liquefaction
trains in the first quarter of 2014. It would take 42 to 48
months for construction of the first train to be completed.  The LNG plant has off-take agreements with Osaka Gas Co.
and Chubu Electric Power Co. for the first train and with a unit
of  BP Plc (BP/)  for the second. The Freeport development is partly
owned by  ConocoPhillips (COP) , Dow Chemical Co. and Osaka Gas.  The Energy Department has  approved  three projects with
combined export capacity of up to 5.6 billion cubic feet a day,
including  Cheniere Energy Inc. (LNG) ’s Sabine Pass and the  Lake
Charles  exports LLC terminal, a joint venture of BG Group Plc
and Energy Transfer’s Southern Union Co. unit.  U.S. production is headed for the sixth consecutive annual
gain as drilling technologies such as hydraulic fracturing, or
fracking, have made it more economical to tap gas trapped in
shale rock. Output will average 69.89 billion cubic feet a day,
up 1 percent from the 2012 record of 69.18 billion, the
government said in its  Short-Term Energy Outlook  on Aug. 6.  The U.S. met 87 percent of its own energy needs in the
first five months of 2013, on pace to be the highest annual rate
since 1986, according to EIA data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
