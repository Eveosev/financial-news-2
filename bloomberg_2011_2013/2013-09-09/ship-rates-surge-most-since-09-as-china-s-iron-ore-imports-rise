The cost of shipping raw materials
surged the most in more than four years as strengthening steel
prices in China spur imports of  iron ore  used to make the metal,
helping owners recover from the industry’s worst slump ever.  The Baltic Dry Index, a benchmark of commodity shipping
rates, jumped 9.3 percent to 1,478 today, the biggest gain since
June 2009, according to the  Baltic Exchange , the London-based
publisher of freight rates on more than 50 trade routes. The
measure is now at the highest since January 2012, after
collapsing from as high as 11,793 in 2008 because of a record
shipbuilding program.  China’s imports of iron ore, the single-biggest source of
demand for the vessels, expanded 8.1 percent to 526.7 million
metric tons in the year to August compared with the same period
a year earlier, customs data show. The increase is the result of
strengthening steel output and prices in  China , according to
Fotis Giannakoulis, a New York-based analyst at Morgan Stanley.  “Steel production in China is defying a seasonal slowdown
in prices, allowing mills to absorb high iron ore imports,” he
said in an e-mailed report today. “As long as high steel prices
offer attractive margins for  steel mills , there is room for
strong imports.”  Daily earnings for iron-ore carrying Capesizes, the largest
ships tracked by the index, rose 17 percent to $25,426, the
highest since December 2011, according to the exchange. Twenty-six of the vessels were booked last week, up from 16 the week
before, according to Morgan Stanley. Spot bookings in the last
three months rose 27 percent from a year earlier while the fleet
expanded 5.5 percent, Giannakoulis said.  Steel Output  Steel reinforcement-bar futures in  Shanghai  rose 0.8
percent to close at 3,752  yuan  ($613) a ton today, the highest
since Sept. 2. Daily steel output rose 1 percent to 2.12 million
tons in late August from the previous period, according to Xiben
New Line, citing data from the China Iron & Steel Association.  The price of imported iron ore climbed 22 percent since the
start of June to $134.80 a ton, according to the Steel Index
Ltd. China imported 69.01 million tons in August, up 11 percent
from a year earlier and within 6 percent of July’s all-time
high, customs data show. Stockpiles are 24 percent lower than a
year ago, according to Beijing Antaike Information Development
Co.  The Capesize fleet swelled 70 percent to 289 million
deadweight tons since 2009, according to Clarkson Plc, the
world’s largest shipbroker. Capacity will expand 5.6 percent
this year, the slowest pace since 2003, figures show.  Gains extended across the smallest ship types tracked by
the index. Panamax rates rose 8.3 percent to $8,836 a day,
according to the exchange. Supramaxes and Handysizes both rose
less than 1 percent to $10,091 and $7,731, respectively.  To contact the reporter on this story:
