Ford Motor Co. (F)  expects its European
unit to turn a full-year profit in 2015, the automaker’s
regional chief said today.  “We are at bottom,” Stephen Odell, the company’s European
head, told reporters attending the Frankfurt Motor Show. “There
are no major signs of uptick but it does feel like we’re running
along the bottom.” Odell provided the 2015 date in response to
a reporter’s question.  Ford and  General Motors Co. (GM) , the two largest U.S.
automakers, are working to break even in Europe by mid-decade as
the industry weathers a six-year decline in the region’s auto
market. European first-half car sales fell 6.7 percent to 6.44
million vehicles, according to the Brussels-based ACEA industry
group.  Ford’s sales in Europe rose 7 percent to $7.6 billion in
the second quarter. That helped boost Ford’s market share to
about 8.1 percent from 7.6 percent a year earlier, the company
said in a slide presentation for its second-quarter financial
results issued July 24.  Reviving the company’s European unit is one of Chief
Executive Officer Alan Mulally’s main challenges. Dearborn,
Michigan-based Ford depends on its profitable North American
operations to make up for losses in Europe, which totaled $810
million in the year’s first half.  The automaker in July narrowed its loss forecast for Europe
to about $1.8 billion from $2 billion. In 2012, it reported a
loss of $1.75 billion.  Industry Sales  Auto sales in western Europe fell 5.3 percent last month,
according to researcher LMC Automotive. LMC forecasts sales of
11.4 million in the region this year, a 3.2 percent decline from
last year and a 16 percent slide from 2008.  The ACEA is scheduled to report figures for July and August
registrations Sept. 17.  Ford has closed an assembly plant and a stamping and
tooling facility in  England  and plans to shut its Genk,  Belgium ,
assembly plant by 2014. The moves will reduce Ford’s annual
production capacity by about 350,000 vehicles, or 18 percent,
Odell said in July.  To contact the reporter on this story:
