Indonesia ’s bonds fell, pushing the
10-year yield to the highest level since February 2011, on
concern the weakening rupiah will spur inflation.  Global funds  pulled 3.5 trillion rupiah ($298 million) from
local-currency government notes in the two weeks through Sept. 5,
finance ministry data show. The rupiah dropped 11 percent this
quarter, the worst performance among 24 emerging-market
currencies tracked by Bloomberg. A decline of 10 percent adds as
much as 0.8 percent to inflation, according to PT Bank Central
Asia, which revised its year-end forecast for consumer-price
gains to 9.4 percent from 8.3 percent.  “Many industry associations haven’t increased prices in
response to the rupiah yet,” said David Sumual, the Jakarta-based chief economist at Bank Central Asia, the country’s
largest lender by market value. “So we may see that contribute
to inflation in September or October.”  The yield on the nation’s 5.625 percent bonds due May 2023
climbed as much as three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point,
to 8.95 percent, prices from the Inter Dealer Market Association
show. The rate was 8.93 percent as of 9:37 a.m. in Jakarta and
has risen 53 basis points since Sept. 2, when official data
showing August consumer prices gained by the most since January
2009, was released.  Reserves Rise  Foreign-exchange reserves  increased last month for the
first time since April to $93 billion, from $92.7 billion in
July, Bank Indonesia said Sept. 6. The central bank began
holding weekly foreign-currency swap auctions starting July 25.  “The reserves were helped by the $3.9 billion accepted by
Bank Indonesia by offering foreign-exchange swaps, but those may
weigh on the reserves when they come due in the next few
months,” BCA’s Sumual said.  One-month non-deliverable forwards on the rupiah fell 0.2
percent to 11,773 per dollar, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
The contracts traded 5.1 percent weaker than the spot rate,
which was unchanged at 11,175 per dollar, prices from local
banks compiled by Bloomberg show. A  fixing  used to settle the
forwards was set at 11,694 per dollar on Sept. 6, according to
the Association of Banks in  Singapore .  One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves
in the exchange rate used to price options, slid 1.1 percentage
points to 19.63 percent, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
