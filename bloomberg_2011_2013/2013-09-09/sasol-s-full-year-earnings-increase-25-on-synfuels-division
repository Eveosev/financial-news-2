Sasol Ltd. (SOL) , the world’s biggest
coal-to-gasoline maker, said full-year profit climbed 25 percent
after production at its synfuels division increased.  Earnings excluding one-time items rose to 52.62 rand
($5.25) a share in the 12 months ended June, from 42.28 rand the
previous year, the Johannesburg-based company said in a
statement today. That met Sasol’s Aug. 1 forecast for an
increase of 20 percent to 30 percent.  Sasol, which sold its Iranian unit last month after twice
writing down its value, has benefited from a 15 percent decline
in the South African rand against the dollar this year, the
largest drop among 16 major currencies tracked by Bloomberg. The
company plans to cut 3 billion rand of annual expenditure over
the next two to three years after the falling currency failed to
arrest rising costs in its home market.  The savings “will be a combination of efficiency benefits
stemming from our new operating model, continued improvements in
operations, establishing fit-for-purpose functions and driving
procurement cost reductions,” Chief Executive David Constable
said at a presentation. He declined to comment on potential job
cuts, saying that if the company did plan to reduce headcount it
would first talk to labor representatives.  The highest output at its synfuels business since 2006 also
helped boost operating profit at the division by 30 percent to
28.6 billion rand.  Earnings by the same measure at its South African mining,
gas, synfuels and oil operations climbed 28 percent to 37
billion rand. The company raised its total  dividend  9 percent to
19 rand a share.  The stock gained 0.3 percent to 491 rand at 2:40 p.m. in
Johannesburg trading. The shares have advanced 35 percent this
year, outpacing the 9 percent gain in the 165-member FTSE/JSE
 Africa  All-Share Index.  Chairman Hixonia Nyasulu will step down from the board in
November after five years in the position, Sasol said today in a
separate statement. She will be replaced by Mandla Gantsho, CEO
of Africa Rising Capital, and a Sasol director for 10 years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
