Tenet Healthcare Corp. (THC)  is planning
to issue $4.6 billion of bonds in its largest sale ever to help
fund the purchase of  Vanguard Health Systems Inc. (VHS)   The third-biggest publicly traded U.S. hospital chain may
sell $2.8 billion of 8.5-year bonds and $1.8 billion of seven-year notes this week, according to a person with knowledge of
the transaction.  The offering follows a $1.05 billion issue in May and is
poised to be the Dallas-based company’s largest on record,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Tenet agreed to buy Vanguard in June for about $1.8
billion. The purchase gives Tenet 28 hospitals in the Chicago,
Phoenix, Detroit, Boston and San Antonio, Texas, regions.  Bank of America Corp., Barclays Plc, Citigroup Inc. and
Wells Fargo & Co. are managing the offering, said the person,
who asked not to be identified because terms aren’t set. The
bonds may be sold on Sept. 13.  To contact the reporter on this story:
