The Australian dollar rose to a
three-week high after data yesterday showed China’s exports
increased more than estimated, adding to signs the world’s
second-largest economy is rebounding.  The Aussie gained versus all of its 16 major peers before
data this week forecast to show inflation in China slowed while
industrial production grew at the fastest pace since December.
Tony Abbott led the Liberal-National coalition to victory in
federal elections held Sept. 7, ending six years of rule by the
Labor Party. Australia’s 10-year bond yields fell from a 17-month high.  “The Aussie lifted mainly because of the Chinese trade
balance data,” said  Joseph Capurso , a Sydney-based currency
strategist at  Commonwealth Bank of Australia. (CBA)  “If the Chinese
data that come out today and tomorrow are better than we think,
the Aussie will probably get another leg up.”  Australia’s currency added 0.1 percent to 91.90 U.S. cents
at 9:53 a.m. in Sydney from Sept. 6, after earlier touching
92.21, the highest since Aug. 19. The Aussie jumped 1 percent to
91.92 yen. It rose 0.3 percent to NZ$1.1518.  New Zealand’s dollar slid 0.3 percent to 79.79 U.S. cents.
It earlier reached 80.34, the strongest since Aug. 20. The kiwi
dollar gained 0.7 percent to 79.81 yen.  The  yield  on Australia’s benchmark 10-year bond declined 4
1/2 basis points, or 0.045 percentage point, to 4.1 percent from
the end of last week, when it touched 4.16 percent, the highest
since April 2012.  China Economy  In  China , overseas shipments rose 7.2 percent from a year
earlier, the General Administration of Customs said in Beijing
yesterday. That compares with the 5.5 percent median estimate of
economists surveyed by Bloomberg News and July’s 5.1 percent
gain. Imports rose a less-than-estimated 7 percent, leaving a
trade surplus of more than $28 billion.  National Bureau of Statistics figures due today may show
 consumer prices  rose 2.6 percent in August, compared with a 2.7
percent gain in July, according to the median estimate of
economists in a Bloomberg poll. Industrial production may have
gained 9.9 percent from a year earlier in NBS data out tomorrow,
the most this year outside of months distorted by the Chinese
New Year holiday.  China’s economy will maintain sustained, healthy growth,
Premier Li Keqiang wrote in a commentary published in the
Financial Times. China is the biggest trading partner for both
 Australia  and New Zealand.  In Australia, Abbot is pledging to cut red tape and lower
taxes to boost the $1.5 trillion economy after his coalition won
the biggest parliamentary majority since at least 2004.  -- Editors: Jonathan Annells, Rocky Swift  To contact the reporter on this story:
