Beijing, once voted the city with
the world’s most onerous commute, is getting help from an
automaker to ease its traffic jams.  Nissan Motor Co. (7201)  jointly developed a real-time traffic
information system with the Chinese capital that provides
motorists the fastest route to their destinations, based on road
conditions provided by the city’s traffic information center.
The suggested shortcuts are delivered through a dashboard-mounted device similar to a global positioning system.  Projections by the company show a 10 percent increase in
average vehicle speeds from using the system and a corresponding
drop in energy consumption and  carbon emissions  if the same
proportion of vehicles use the system, the Yokohama, Japan-based
automaker said in a release today.  “We’re still exploring ways on how to commercialize the
devices,” Tetsuo Hasegawa, Nissan’s global manager for
environmental and safety technologies, said in a briefing in
Beijing today.  China , the world’s biggest carbon emitter, is home to seven
of the world’s 10 most polluted cities, according to a 2012
report by the  Asian Development Bank .  Air quality  in Beijing
reached hazardous levels for 20 days in January, according to
U.S. Embassy readings, sparking public calls for government
action.  The Chinese capital has capped the number of new vehicles
in the city at 240,000 a year, a number that will be further
reduced to ease pollution and traffic congestion, the official
Xinhua News Agency reported this month, citing the Beijing
Municipal Commission of Transport.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
