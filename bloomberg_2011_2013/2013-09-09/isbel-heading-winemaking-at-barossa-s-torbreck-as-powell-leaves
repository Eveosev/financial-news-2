Torbreck Vintners senior winemaker
Craig Isbel will pursue his role heading up the Barossa Valley
grower’s winemaking team following the recent departure of
founder David Powell, according to  Torbreck  owner Pete Kight.  Isbel joined the South Australian business in 2004 and has
been running winemaking there since 2006, while Powell operated
as the public face of Torbreck, the winery he founded in 1994.  Torbreck has developed over the past 19 years under
Powell’s influence into one of the leading wineries in the
Barossa Valley, northeast of Adelaide. Its wines are based on
the area’s classic Shiraz, Grenache and Mataro grapes, and it
exports two-thirds of its output.  “We’ve focused very hard on  Asia ,” Kight, who bought the
winery in 2008, said in a phone interview. He said he sees
Torbrek operating “on a global stage” and has a management
committee in place to drive the winery’s strategy.  Isbel has two assistant winemakers on his team, Scott
McDonald and Russell Burns, according to Torbreck’s website.
Powell could not immediately be reached outside normal business
hours for comment.  Kight also owns  Quivira Vineyards & Winery  in  California ’s
Dry Creek Valley, north of the Russian River region in Sonoma
County.  To contact the reporter on this story:
