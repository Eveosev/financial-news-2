GMP Capital Inc. (GMP)  and James
Richardson & Sons Ltd. agreed to buy the Canadian private-wealth
business of  Australia ’s  Macquarie Group Ltd. (MQG)  for C$132 million
($127 million) to expand its wealth-management partnership.  Richardson GMP Ltd. will have C$28 billion of assets under
administration when the deal is completed, which is expected to
be in the fourth quarter, the companies said today in an e-mailed statement.  “This transformational transaction for Richardson GMP
reinforces our position as the largest independent wealth-management firm in Canada,” Richardson GMP Chief Executive
Officer Andrew Marsh said in the statement. “It further
establishes Richardson GMP as a firm that can compete with
larger institutions, while maintaining a boutique culture.”  Richardson GMP will acquire the outstanding shares of
Macquarie Private Wealth  Canada  in a deal funded by an equity
offering to private investors, the Toronto-based firm said.  GMP and a subsidiary of Winnipeg, Manitoba-based James
Richardson & Sons will each contribute C$30 million for
preferred shares in Richardson GMP, according to the statement.
An additional C$30 million will be raised through a share sale
to Richardson GMP shareholders, the companies said.  GMP was the financial adviser to Richardson GMP, while
Macquarie Capital was the financial adviser for the Canadian
wealth unit of the Sydney-based firm.  To contact the reporter on this story:
