Hyundai Motor Co. (005380) ’s union workers
in South Korea agreed to end a three-week strike that cost more
than 1 trillion won ($921 million) in lost output after they
accepted the carmaker’s proposal to increase wages.  Management’s offer to raise base salaries by 5.1 percent
was approved in a vote yesterday by the Seoul-based company’s
46,000  guild  members, union spokesman Kim Gi Hyuk said
yesterday.  The stock rose in Seoul as the accord ended the second
disruption this year, a time when the weaker yen is giving
Japanese carmakers an edge in global markets. Hyundai Motor is
so prone to disputes that employees have gone on strike in all
but four years since the union’s formation in 1987, causing
estimated lost production exceeding 16 trillion won.  “The strikes were definitely a risk factor to investors,
so with that gone, the shares will now look more appealing,”
said Kwon Soon Woo, an analyst at HI Investment & Securities Co.
“The relatively early end of strikes will help the company post
profits that are better than last year’s.”  Hyundai Motor shares rose 1 percent to 250,500 won at 10:01
a.m. in Seoul trading, while  Korea ’s benchmark Kospi index rose
0.7 percent.  Weekend Work  The wage agreement includes a 97,000-won increase in
monthly base salary, and bonuses worth 3 1/2 months of wages
plus 5 million won in cash, according to a Sept. 6 statement on
the union’s website. This is equivalent to an average of 28.8
million won extra per person, according to the statement.  The partial strikes, which began Aug. 20, have resulted in
an estimated 50,191 vehicles in lost production, according to
the company. Together with the union’s boycott of extra weekend
shifts earlier this year, the cost for this year’s labor strife
adds to more than 2.7 trillion won.  The union refused extra work for 13 weekends beginning
March 9, demanding higher compensation on those shifts. The
stoppage, although not a legally sanctioned strike, cost Hyundai
1.7 trillion won in lost production, according to the company’s
estimates.  The automaker has sought to reduce the effect of strikes in
 South Korea  by expanding production in the U.S.,  China ,  India 
and  Turkey  during the last decade.  Kia Motors  Worldwide, Hyundai sold 3.1 million vehicles for the first
eight months of this year, a 12 percent increase from a year
earlier, according to the company’s regulatory filing on Sept.
2. The automaker will probably report a third-quarter profit of
2.1 trillion won, according to the average of 21 analyst
estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  The union at  Kia Motors Corp. (000270) , an affiliate of Hyundai,
will stage partial strikes tomorrow to Friday, according to a
statement on its website. The company and its union will hold
wage talks today.  The nation’s second-largest automaker has lost 352 billion
won or 19,822 units in production as of Sept. 8 from strikes
that began on Aug. 21, Kia said in an e-mailed statement
yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
