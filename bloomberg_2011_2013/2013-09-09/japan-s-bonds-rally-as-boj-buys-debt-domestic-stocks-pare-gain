Japanese bonds rose, sending
benchmark yields lower for the first time in seven sessions, as
the central bank bought government debt for the third time this
month and domestic shares pared an early surge.  The  Bank of Japan  said today it would buy 1 trillion yen
($10 billion) in notes from one to 10 years in maturity as part
of its plan to stimulate growth through low borrowing costs.
Tokyo won the right to host the 2020 Olympics, and data showed
 Japan ’s economic growth in the second quarter was faster than
originally estimated. The Ministry of Finance will sell 600
billion yen in 30-year  government bonds  tomorrow.  “The Tokyo Olympic decision pushed stocks higher and the
yen weaker in morning trading, but as they lost steam, bonds
attracted buying,” said  Takafumi Yamawaki , the Tokyo-based
chief rates strategist at JPMorgan Chase & Co., one of 23
primary dealers obliged to bid at government debt sales. “We
also had the BOJ operation, but I didn’t expect yields to fall
by these degrees.”  Japan’s 10-year  yield  slid four basis points to 0.75
percent as of 4:30 p.m. in Tokyo, according to Japan Bond
Trading Co. The five-year rate declined two basis points to 0.27
percent. The 20- and 30-year rates both slid 2 1/2 basis points
to 1.68 percent and 1.805 percent, respectively. A basis point
is 0.01 percentage point.  The Topix index of shares closed 2.2 percent higher after
rising as much as 2.7 percent. The yen lost 0.4 percent to 99.49
per dollar after falling to as weak as 100.11.  Tokyo, which staged the 1964 Summer Games, beat  Madrid  and
Istanbul to win the 2020 host role, the  International Olympic
Committee  said Sept. 7 in  Buenos Aires .  Sales Tax  Gross domestic product  in Japan rose an annualized 3.8
percent in the second quarter from three months before, compared
with a preliminary estimate of 2.6 percent, the Cabinet Office
said in Tokyo today. First quarter growth was revised to 4.1
percent, the fastest in a year, from 3.8 percent.  There is a high chance Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will
decide on Oct. 1 whether to go ahead with a planned increase in
the  sales tax , Economy Minister Akira Amari said today in Tokyo.
BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda last week signaled policy makers
can use extra fiscal and monetary stimulus to offset any hit to
growth from the tax which the government may increase 3
percentage points to 8 percent in April.  The BOJ today offered to buy 400 billion in five- to 10-year notes, 350 billion yen in three- to five-year securities
and 250 billion yen in one- to three-year notes.  The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield slid one basis point to
2.92 percent today after a six point drop on Sept. 6. Labor
Department figures that day showed that U.S. payrolls rose by
169,000 last month, less than the 180,000 estimate in a
Bloomberg survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
