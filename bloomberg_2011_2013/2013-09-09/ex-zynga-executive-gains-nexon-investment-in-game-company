Zynga Inc. (ZNGA) ’s former chief operating
officer received an investment for his video-game startup from
free-to-play pioneer  Nexon Co. (3659) , going into competition with his
ex-employer.  Nexon, based in Tokyo, gains exclusive global publishing
rights to new PC and mobile titles being developed by Miami-based Shiver Entertainment Inc., according to a statement today.
Terms of the cash investment weren’t disclosed.  Shiver was formed by John Schappert, a video-game industry
pioneer who resigned from Zynga, the maker of “Farmville,” in
August 2012 after being stripped of some responsibilities
overseeing game development. He had been lured away from
 Electronic Arts Inc. (EA) , the second-largest U.S. game developer,
with a pay package worth $42.8 million.  Owen Mahoney, Nexon’s chief financial officer, will gain a
seat on Shiver Entertainment’s board of directors.  To contact the reporter on this story:
