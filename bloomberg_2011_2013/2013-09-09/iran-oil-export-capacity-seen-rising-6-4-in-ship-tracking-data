The combined carrying capacity of
oil tankers leaving Iranian ports last month rose 6.4 percent
from July, vessel-tracking data compiled by Bloomberg show.  The implied capacity of departing vessels rose to the
equivalent of 1.07 million barrels a day from 1.01 million
barrels, according to signals gathered by IHS Maritime, a
Coulsdon, England-based research company. The data may be
incomplete because not all ship transmissions are captured.  U.S. and European sanctions are curbing  Iran ’s oil exports
to pressure the country’s leaders to stop their nuclear program.
Shipments dropped from more than 2 million barrels a day in
2011, before the latest rules took effect, according to figures
from the website of the Joint Organizations Data Initiative.  The table below shows estimated vessel capacities in
millions of barrels a day, based on signals from tankers that
stopped at Iranian ports as well as movements near the nation’s
terminals by its own tankers and Asian ships that previously
loaded Iranian cargoes since the European Union’s embargo began
in July 2012.  The tallies assume standard cargo sizes of 2 million
barrels each for very large crude carriers, 1 million for
Suezmax tankers and 650,000 for Aframaxes. Japanese VLCCs that
also stopped at other terminals in the Persian Gulf were assumed
to load 1 million barrels in Iran.  The table also shows estimates from the International
Energy Agency, the Paris-based adviser to industrialized
countries. The IEA counts cargoes once they are received in
importing countries, whereas the ship-tracking data compiled by
Bloomberg tally exports when they leave Iran.  To contact the reporter on this story:
