Egypt  is considering raising the the
local wheat price for the 2013-2014 season to 420 pounds per
Ardab from 400 pounds, Ayman Abou Hadid, the minister of
agriculture, said in an interview.  Raising the price above import costs would encourage
farmers to plant more wheat, he said. Planting in the Delta
region typically starts in November and the harvest is in April
and May, according to  information  on the Food & Agriculture
Organization website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
