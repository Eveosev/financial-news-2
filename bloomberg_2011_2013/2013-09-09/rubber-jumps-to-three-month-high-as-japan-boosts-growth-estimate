Rubber climbed to the highest level
in more than three months as  Japan  grew faster than previously
estimated last quarter, boosting confidence in the recovery of
the world’s third-largest economy.  Rubber for delivery in February gained as much as 2.7
percent to 290.3 yen a kilogram ($2,912 a metric ton) on the
 Tokyo  Commodity Exchange, the highest level for a most-active
contract since May 23. Futures traded at 285.50 yen at 10:32
a.m., extending last week’s 5.1 percent rally.  Gross domestic product expanded an annualized 3.8 percent
from the first quarter, higher than an initial estimate of 2.6
percent, the Cabinet Office said in Tokyo today. Prime Minister
Shinzo Abe’s effort to revive the economy got a boost over the
weekend with Tokyo’s successful bid to host the 2020 Olympics.  “Rubber reacted positively to the news about the Olympics
and GDP as they lifted prospects for Japan’s economy,” said
 Kazuhiko Saito , an analyst at broker Fujitomi Co. in Tokyo.  Futures also gained after data showed yesterday that
 China ’s exports beat estimates, raising optimism raw-material
demand will improve from the world’s largest consumer, he said.  China’s exports rose 7.2 percent from a year earlier, the
General Administration of Customs said in Beijing yesterday.
That compares with the 5.5 percent median estimate of 46
economists surveyed by Bloomberg News and July’s 5.1 percent
gain. Imports rose a less-than-estimated 7 percent.  Thai rubber free-on-board added 1.2 percent to 86.65 baht
($2.67) a kilogram Sept 6, according to data from the Rubber
Research Institute of  Thailand . The contract for January
delivery climbed 0.2 percent to 20,845  yuan  ($3,409) a
ton on the Shanghai Futures Exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
