ZTE Corp. (000063) , the world’s fifth-largest
smartphone maker, said it was the first company to receive
regulatory approval in China to sell a handset for fourth-generation network service.  The company’s Grand Memo handset was approved by China’s
Ministry of Industry and  Information Technology  to run on the 4G
TD-LTE network standard, Shenzhen-based ZTE said in an e-mailed
statement today. The statement didn’t say when the device, which
runs  Nvidia Corp. (NVDA) ’s Tegra3 processor, will go on sale.  China Mobile Ltd. (941) , the world’s largest phone company by
users, is conducting a trial of 4G service this year that will
reach 100 cities covering a population of 500 million people,
the carrier said in February. China Mobile plans to buy 1
million smartphones and data cards for the trial from companies
including ZTE, it said at the time. Licenses for commercial
service are anticipated by the end of this year, the carrier
said in March.  The top five global smartphone vendors in the second
quarter according to a ranking by International Data Corp. are:
 Samsung Electronics Co. (005930)  with 30.4 percent;  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  with 13.1
percent;  LG Electronics Inc. (066570)  with 5.1 percent; Lenovo Group Ltd.
with 4.7 percent and ZTE with 4.2 percent.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
