A measure of job prospects in the
U.S. advanced in August to a more than five-year high, a sign
the labor market is improving.  The Conference Board’s Employment Trends Index increased
0.7 percent to 113.54, the highest since April 2008, the New
York-based private research group said today. The prior month’s
reading was revised up to 112.8 from 112.2. The measure is up
4.5 percent from a year earlier.  “Employment is likely to moderately expand through the
fall,”  Gad Levanon , director of macroeconomic research at the
Conference Board, said in a statement.  Today’s report follows Labor Department data last week that
showed payrolls rose 169,000 in August following a 104,000 gain
a month earlier. The  unemployment rate  fell to 7.3 percent, the
lowest since December 2008, as workers left the labor force.  The Employment Trends Index aggregates eight labor-market
indicators to forecast short-term hiring trends. Improvements in
seven of the index’s eight components contributed to the gain in
the overall gauge, the Conference Board said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
