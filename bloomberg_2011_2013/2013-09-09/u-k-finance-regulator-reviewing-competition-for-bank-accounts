The U.K. markets regulator will
review whether there’s enough competition in the 1 trillion-pound ($1.3 trillion) market for  savings accounts .  The Financial Conduct Authority will look at introductory
offers and how easily customers can switch to another provider,
it said in an e-mailed statement. About 80 percent of adults in
the U.K. have a savings account, according to the regulator.  “We will examine an area that affects most people and see
if there is action we need to take,” Martin Wheatley, chief
executive officer of the FCA, said in the statement.  The FCA, which replaced the Financial Services Authority
earlier this year, was given a new mandate to promote
competition in financial markets and retail products. In July,
it began a market study into insurance add-on products.  To contact the reporter on this story:
