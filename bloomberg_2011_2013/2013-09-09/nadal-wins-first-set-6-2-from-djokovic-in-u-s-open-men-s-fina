Second-seeded Rafael Nadal has won
the first set 6-2 against top-seeded Novak Djokovic in the men’s
final at the U.S. Open in a duel of former champions.  It is the third time in four years that the two have met in
the final -- Nadal won in 2010 and Djokovic triumphed in 2011.
Last year, with Nadal sidelined by a knee injury, Djokovic lost
to Andy Murray in the final.  Nadal, 27, a Spaniard who is 21-0 on hard courts this
season, got the only service breaks in the third and seventh
games of the match at the National Tennis Center in New York. He
has lost only one game on his own serve in the tournament so
far.  Djokovic, 26, from  Serbia , has reached the final of three
major championships in 2013 for the third consecutive year,
winning his third straight Australian Open at the beginning of
the year.  Nadal and Djokovic are playing for the 37th time, the most
of any men’s rivalry in the professional era of tennis that
began in 1968. They had been tied with Ivan Lendl and John McEnroe with 36 meetings. Nadal leads the head-to-head contest
21-15.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
