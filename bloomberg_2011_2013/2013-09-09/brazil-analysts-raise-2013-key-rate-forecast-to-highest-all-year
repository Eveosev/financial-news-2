Brazil  economists raised their
forecasts for the 2013 benchmark interest rate to the highest so
far this year after policy makers signaled they will extend the
world’s fastest tightening cycle.  Brazil’s central bank will raise the Selic to 9.75 percent
this year from today’s 9 percent, compared with the previous
week’s estimate of 9.50 percent, according to the Sept. 6
central bank survey of about 100 analysts published today.
Economists maintained their 2014 key rate forecast at 9.75
percent.  President Dilma Rousseff’s administration is working to
stimulate investment while slowing inflation persisting near the
top of the central bank’s target range. Officials have lowered
tariffs on some imports, intervened to strengthen the real and
cut billions in spending from this year’s budget. Central bank
board members signaled last week they will continue raising
borrowing costs to prevent prices fanned by a weaker currency
from curbing economic growth.  Swap rates on the contract due in January 2015 fell one
basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 10.28 percent at 9:04
a.m. local time. The real strengthened by 0.1 percent to 2.3039
per U.S. dollar and has declined 7.5 percent in the past three
months, the most among 16 major currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  The central bank considers the current pace of key rate
increases to be appropriate, as a weaker real pressures short-term inflation, policy makers said in the minutes to their Aug.
27-28 meeting.  Benchmark Selic  Officials on Aug. 28 raised the benchmark Selic by a half-percentage point to 9 percent, the fourth straight increase and
the fastest pace of monetary tightening of any major world
economy tracked by Bloomberg.  Annual inflation measured by the IPCA index  decelerated  in
August to 6.09 percent, the slowest since December, the national
statistics agency said Sept. 6. Brazil’s central bank targets
annual inflation at 4.5 percent, plus or minus two percentage
points.  Economists in the central bank survey raised their 12-month
inflation forecast for the 10th straight week, to 6.13 percent.  Brazil’s economy  grew  1.5 percent during the April to June
period, or an annualized 6 percent, on the back of faster
investments. That was the most since the first quarter of 2010
and more than all 44 forecasts from analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg, whose median estimate was 0.9 percent.  Latin America’s largest economy will expand by about 2.5
percent this year and 4 percent next year, according to Finance
Minister Guido Mantega.  To contact the reporter on this story:
