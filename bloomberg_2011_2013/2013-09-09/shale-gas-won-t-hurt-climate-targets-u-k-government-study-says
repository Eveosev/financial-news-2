The U.K. can use its shale gas
resources without risking targets for reducing carbon emissions,
the government said, citing a study it commissioned.  The research by David Mackay and Timothy Stone was
published after anti-fracking protesters disrupted drilling by
Cuadrilla Resources Ltd. in Balcombe,  England . It’s a rebuke to
critics of fracking who say greenhouse-gas emissions may be
exacerbated by the technique that extracts gas and oil by
grinding underground rocks with water and chemicals.  Prime Minister David Cameron is pushing to exploit
Britain’s shale resources after fracking reversed oil and gas
output declines in the U.S. and made it the world’s biggest
natural gas producer.  “This report shows that the continued use of gas is
perfectly consistent with our carbon budgets over the next
couple of decades,” Energy Secretary Edward Davey said in a
statement. “U.K. shale gas production must not be at the
expense of our wider environmental aims –- indeed, if done
properly, it will support them.”  The British Geological Survey estimates a single area --
the Bowland basin stretching from the east Midlands into
England’s northwest -- may hold as much 1,300 trillion cubic
feet of gas. Even if only 10 percent of the gas is extracted, a
typical rate in the U.S., that’s enough to meet 47 years of U.K.
demand.  To contact the reporter on this story:
