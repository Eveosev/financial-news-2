Wpd AG, a German offshore wind-farm
developer, bought a North Sea project from  Energiekontor AG. (EKT)   Wpd will commission the Nordergruende wind farm in 2016,
the Bremen-based company said today in an e-mailed statement,
without disclosing terms. The project will use 18 turbines, each
with a capacity of 6 megawatts.  The company will build the plant north of Wilhelmshaven in
waters as deep as 10 meters (33 feet), it said. Wpd, with 10,000
megawatts of offshore wind under development, is also
constructing the 288-megawatt Butendiek wind farm in the German
North Sea that it will connect to the grid in early 2015.  One megawatt of  wind energy  generated offshore, where gusts
tend to be stronger and more consistent than on land, can power
more than 400 average U.S. homes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
