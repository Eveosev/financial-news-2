Howard Marks , chairman of  Oaktree
Capital Group LLC (OAK) , said  hedge funds  will have to stop charging
clients 20 percent of investment profits unless they’re at the
top of their peer group.  “For a client to give a manager 20 percent of the profits,
the manager should be exceptional,” Marks, 67, said today at
Barclays Plc’s financial-services conference in New York. “The
exceptional will continue to deserve carry and presumably will
get it. The unexceptional will not.”  Hedge funds, mostly private pools of capital whose managers
participate substantially in the profits from their speculation
on whether the price of assets will rise or fall, typically
charge a 2 percent management fee and 20 percent of profits from
investments as a carried interest, or carry. The funds’ average
returns, about 6 percent to 7 percent annually over the past
decade, don’t justify such fees, said Marks.  “There aren’t 10,000 exceptional people in this
industry,” he said.  Oaktree, based in  Los Angeles , is the world’s biggest
investor in distressed debt, overseeing $76.4 billion in assets.
The firm charges a 20 percent performance fee on most of its
funds after they exceed an 8 percent net internal rate of
return. Oaktree’s flagship debt funds since inception have
returned an average 18 percent a year after fees as of June 30.  To contact the reporter on this story:
