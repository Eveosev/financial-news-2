Soybeans advanced for a third day as
dry weather in the Midwest curbed crop yields, boosting
speculation the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  will lower its
production estimate in the world’s biggest grower.  The contract for November delivery gained as much as 1.2
percent to $13.84 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade and was
at $13.745 by 10:09 a.m. in  Singapore . Prices rose for a fifth
week in the five days to Sept. 6, the best run since May.  Futures surged 13 percent last month as hot weather in the
Midwest harmed crops. Significant rain isn’t expected in the
region in the next 10 days with dryness remaining widespread
across the central and western Midwest, especially in western
Illinois, northern  Missouri , Iowa and Minnesota, curbing yield
potential, MDA Information Systems LLC said Sept. 6. The U.S.
soybean harvest may be 3.13 billion bushels, 3.7 percent below
the USDA’s August estimate, a Bloomberg survey shows.  “The USDA is the focus this week and we’re expecting
another downgrade to U.S. soybean production prospects,”  Luke Mathews , a commodity strategist at  Commonwealth Bank of
Australia , said by phone today. There’s been a deterioration
“in U.S. seasonal conditions in the last couple of months and a
subsequent decline in crop conditions and therefore yield
prospects,” he said from Sydney.  The USDA updates its forecasts on Sept. 12.  Corn for December delivery fell 0.5 percent to $4.66 a
bushel after gaining and losing 0.6 percent. Wheat for delivery
in December declined 0.4 percent to $6.4525 a bushel, erasing a
0.6 percent advance.  To contact the reporter on this story:
