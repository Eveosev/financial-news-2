Gold sales from Australia’s Perth
Mint, which refines most of the country’s bullion, tumbled in
August, adding to signs bullion demand in advanced economies is
slumping as the U.S. Federal Reserve prepares to curb stimulus.  Sales of gold coins and minted bars dropped 46 percent to
30,430 ounces last month from 56,488 ounces in July, according
to data from the  mint . Demand in August was 73 percent lower
than the pace in April, when bullion entered a  bear market .  Gold lost 17 percent in 2013 after 12 years of gains as the
 U.S. economy  improved and the dollar and stocks advanced. The
U.S. central bank is expected to start cutting back its $85
billion-a-month asset-buying program from next week, according
to a Bloomberg survey on Sept. 6, even after jobs data for
August missed expectations. Sales of gold coins by the U.S. Mint
retreated in August to the lowest level in six years.  “The demand for physical when the price came down was just
fantastic and we had some really good months in April, May and
June,” Ron Currie, sales and marketing director at the mint,
said in an interview in Perth. “July was still good but not
quite as good, and August dropped off a little bit.”  Bullion for immediate delivery traded 0.4 percent lower at
$1,386.06 an ounce at 6:06 p.m. in  London , extending two weeks
of losses. Gold slumped in April, May and June -- bottoming at
$1,180.50 on June 28, the lowest since 2010 -- before rebounding
in July and August on signs of rising Asian demand. World stocks
tracked by MSCI All-Country World Index have rallied 10 percent
this year, while the Bloomberg  Dollar Index  rose 4.2 percent.  ‘The Bottom’  “A lot of people got in at April and May, just before it
got to the bottom,” said Currie. The price “volatility is
good. People try to trade in the market and from our point of
view that’s fantastic,” said Currie.  Signs of lower demand for coins and bars in the U.S. and
Australia come amid record sales from  exchange-traded products .
Holdings in ETPs have shrunk 26 percent to 1,953.7 metric tons
in 2013, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The U.S. and  Europe 
are the biggest markets for the Perth Mint, according to Currie.  The  U.S. Mint   sold  11,500 ounces of gold coins in August,
the lowest since July 2007 and down from 50,500 ounces in July,
according to that mint’s data. Coin sales have dropped since
April, when they surged to a 40-month high of 209,500 ounces.  Lower prices have spurred demand across  Asia , including in
 India  and  China , the two largest users. Sales of jewelry, coins
and bars will reach as much as 1,000 metric tons in both
countries in 2013, the London-based World Gold Council
estimates. That would beat China’s 2011 record of 778.6 tons and
be near India’s all-time high of 1,006.5 tons in 2010.  Bond Buying  Fed policy makers were comfortable with Chairman  Ben S.
Bernanke ’s plan to start reducing bond buying later this year if
the economy improves, according to minutes of their July
meeting. The U.S. economy expanded 2.5 percent last quarter, up
from an initial estimate of 1.7 percent, the Commerce Department
said Aug. 29. Payrolls in August grew 169,000, according to data
Sept. 6, trailing the 180,000 median forecast in a Bloomberg
survey.  The Fed will start to cut the monthly asset purchases at
the Sept. 17-18 meeting, paring them by $10 billion, according
to the median of 34 responses in a Bloomberg survey on Sept. 6,
after the jobs data. That’s unchanged from an Aug. 9-13 poll.  The Perth Mint, which began operations in 1899, previously
included so-called investment cast bars in the monthly sales
figures supplied to Bloomberg, which are of the same purity as
the minted bars. A minted bar is struck and carries a unique
serial number, according to the mint.  The mint said in July that its sales of gold bars and coins
totaled 49,460 ounces in June, 92,781 ounces in May and 116,755
ounces in April and 52,704 ounces in March. The latest data show
sales of 47,692 ounces in June, 88,638 ounces in May, 112,575
ounces in April and 50,356 in March.  The  facility  is owned by the Western Australian government
and refines between 300 tons and 400 tons each year, including
mined and scrap gold, according to its website.  Australia  is
world’s biggest gold producer after China.  To contact the reporter on this story:
