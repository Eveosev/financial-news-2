A desalination plant capable of
producing 180,000 cubic meters of water a day, about whatâ€™s
needed for 800,000 people, is being planned to boost supplies to
Muscat, the Times of Oman reported, citing the Oman Power &
Water Procurement Co.  It said the plant at Quriyyat that the state company
floated a tender for pre-qualifying companies to bid for would
be the third independent water project in the Sultanate after
Sur, operated by Bahwan Veolia Water with less than half that
capacity, and Ghubrah, which is under construction.  To contact the reporter on this story:
