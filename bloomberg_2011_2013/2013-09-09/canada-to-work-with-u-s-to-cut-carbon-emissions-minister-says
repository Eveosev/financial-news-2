Canada wants to work with the U.S.
to cut greenhouse-gas emissions from the oilsands in  Alberta ,
Natural Resources Minister Joe Oliver said today.  Oliver, who met with U.S. Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz in
 Washington , said his nation has already agreed to curb
emissions, in line with the pledges made by the U.S., and he
outlined the actions the country has taken to reduce reliance on
coal.  The proposed Keystone XL pipeline would carry oilsands from
Alberta across the U.S. to refineries on the Gulf Coast.  To contact the reporter on this story:
