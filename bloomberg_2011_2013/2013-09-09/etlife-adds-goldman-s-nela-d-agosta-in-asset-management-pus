MetLife Inc. (MET) , the largest U.S. life
insurer, said Nela D’Agosta joined from Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
as a managing director in the unit investing funds for
institutional clients.  D’Agosta will focus on marketing and relationships for
MetLife, the New York-based insurer said in a statement today.
She was a senior relationship manager at Goldman Sachs’s asset
management unit.  MetLife created the unit for institutional investors last
year as Chief Executive Officer Steve Kandarian works to boost
fee income and scales back from capital-intensive businesses
like variable annuities. The insurer said last month that it won
a commitment of as much as $5 billion from  SunTrust Banks Inc. (STI) 
for commercial mortgage loans.  “Nela will bring strong global experience in sales,
relationship management and team leadership,” Lou Jug, head of
investor services for MetLife Investment Management, said in the
statement. “Her extensive relationship management
expertise and client service capabilities are valuable assets.”  Earlier at Goldman Sachs, D’Agosta was global head of
insurance client relationship management. Andrea Raphael, a
spokeswoman for the New York-based bank, declined to comment.  D’Agosta also worked at  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  and  Morgan
Stanley (MS)  and graduated from Villanova University in 1990 with a
bachelor’s degree in business administration.  To contact the reporter on this story:
