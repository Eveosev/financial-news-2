Tanzaniaâ€™s mild arabica coffee
prices fell for a third week after supplies of the beans rose at
an auction on Sept. 5 and demand was little changed.  Overall prices for mild arabica coffee dropped by $3.04 for
a 50-kilogram (110-pound) bag, while the robusta variety climbed
by $3.09 a bag, the Tanzania Coffee Board said today by e-mail
from Moshi, where auctions are held. The benchmark arabica AA
grade dropped 2.6 percent to an average $127.32 a bag.  Supplies at the auction climbed 25 percent to 31,952 bags,
mostly arabica. Sales rose by 53 bags to 23,878 bags, the agency
said. The board offers its bags in 60-kilogram packages while
giving costs per 50 kilograms.  Following are details of the Sept. 5 auction in dollars for
a 50-kilogram bag for good grades:  To contact the reporter on this story:
