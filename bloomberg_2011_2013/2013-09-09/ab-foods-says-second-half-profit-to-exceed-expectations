Associated British Foods Plc (ABF) , the
U.K. sugar and ingredient company that also owns the Primark
retail chain, said second-half earnings will exceed its own
expectations on quicker growth at the fast-fashion chain.  The group’s adjusted operating profit for the second half
will top forecasts, while adjusted earnings per share for the 12
months through Sept. 14 “will show good progress,” the London-based maker of Twinings tea said today in a statement.  AB Foods shares have gained 18 percent this  year , fueled by
prospects for the European expansion of Primark. The chain in
June began to sell some of its products through  Asos Plc (ASC) , the
U.K.’s largest online-only fashion retailer, and plans to open
its first store in  France .  Sales at Primark stores open at least a year should
increase 5 percent this year, AB Foods said. That compares with
the 5.2 percent median increase based on 11 analyst estimates in
a Bloomberg News survey. Sales and adjusted operating profit for
the sugar division “for the full year will be in line with
management expectations,” the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
