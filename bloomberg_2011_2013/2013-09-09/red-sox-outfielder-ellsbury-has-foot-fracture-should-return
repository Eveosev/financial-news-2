Jacoby Ellsbury of the Boston Red
Sox has been diagnosed with a compression fracture in his right
foot, though manager John Farrell said he expects the center
fielder to be able to return to action before the postseason.  Ellsbury, whose 52 stolen bases are the most in Major
League Baseball, was injured when he fouled a fall off his foot
on Aug. 28 and played for more than a week before being shut
down two days ago. He met a specialist in Denver yesterday for a
second opinion on the injury and Farrell said Ellsbury’s foot
will remain in a walking boot for the time being.  The Red Sox, who have the best record in the majors at
87-58 and lead the American League East division by 7 1/2 games,
have 17 regular-season games remaining.  “We feel like he’ll be back to us before this year is
out,” Farrell was cited as saying by MLB.com. “We’re hopeful
in the regular season, yes.”  Ellsbury, 29, is hitting .299 with eight home runs, 52 runs
batted in and 89 runs scored this season.  To contact the reporter on this story:
