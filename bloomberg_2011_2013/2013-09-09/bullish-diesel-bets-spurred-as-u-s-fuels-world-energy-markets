Hedge funds  raised bullish bets on
 diesel fuel  to the most in more than six months on speculation
that exports will surge to record levels, driven by
unprecedented gains in U.S. crude production.  Money managers increased net-long positions, or wagers that
prices will advance, on U.S.  ultra-low  sulfur diesel by 8.2
percent to 38,361 in the seven days ended Sept. 3, according to
the Commodity Futures Trading Commission’s Sept. 6 Commitments
of Traders report. It was the most since Feb. 26.  Diesel prices have advanced 15 percent since reaching a
2013 low in April as gains from exporting fuel rose, pushing
domestic  stockpiles  14 percent below the five-year average. The
profit to buy diesel in the U.S. Gulf Coast and ship it to
Northwest  Europe  climbed to a six-month high of $18.12 per
metric ton (5.92 cents a gallon) on Sept. 4, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. U.S. exports of distillate  fuel oil 
including diesel rose to an all-time high of 1.285 million
barrels a day in June, the EIA reported Aug. 29.  “We’ve really become the refiner to the world,”  John Kilduff , a partner at Again Capital LLC, a  New York  hedge fund
focused on energy, said by phone Sept. 6. “The market is really
ripe for U.S. refiners to capture this export demand. It lends a
compelling narrative to being long diesel fuel.”  Fuel Prices  Diesel declined 0.8 percent to $3.1373 a gallon at 9:28
a.m. on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  after closing at
$3.1637 on Sept. 6. Futures fell 0.4 percent to $3.1483 a gallon
in the week covered by the report.  The U.S. has become the world’s largest fuel exporter as
refiners take advantage of crude pumped from shale formations
such as the Bakken in  North Dakota  and the Eagle Ford in  Texas .
Domestic output rose to 7.621 million barrels a day in the week
ended Aug. 30, the highest since October 1989, according to the
Energy Information Administration, the statistical arm of the
Energy Department.  A combination of horizontal drilling and hydraulic
fracturing, or fracking, has boosted production of oil and
natural gas, helping the U.S. meet 87 percent of its own energy
needs in the first five months of 2013, on pace to be the
highest annual rate since 1986, according to EIA data.  Diesel futures rose 1.5 percent to $3.2083 a gallon on Aug.
28, the first day of the CFTC reporting period, after the EIA
said that  distillate  inventories, including diesel and heating
oil, fell for the first time in four weeks, declining 316,000
barrels to 129 million.  Gulf Coast  The EIA reported on Aug. 29 that distillate  exports  from
the  Gulf Coast  reached a record 992,000 barrels in June in data
going back to 1981. Charters for tankers carrying gasoline or
diesel from the Gulf Coast increased 22 percent from a year ago
to 78 cargoes in August, according to shipping data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Futures advanced 0.1 percent on Sept. 5 after a supply gain
fell short of estimates. Stocks grew by 549,000 barrels to 129.6
million in the week ended Aug. 30, 14 percent below the five-year average, according to the EIA report. Analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg predicted an increase of 600,000. Diesel rose 0.8
percent on Sept. 6.  Demand for U.S.-produced fuel is increasing as Europe’s
economy recovers from a recession and the region’s refiners curb
output as higher crude costs dent margins. Brent futures traded
on  London ’s ICE Futures Europe have averaged $10.81 a barrel
more than West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. standard, this year.  European Production  Europe, among the largest consumers of U.S. exports, will
reduce processing by 1.3 million barrels a day in September and
1.6 million in October, Amrita Sen, chief oil market analyst for
Energy Aspects Ltd., a London research firm, said by phone Sept.
5. The reductions are expected to boost profit margins for
shipping distillates such as diesel from the U.S. Gulf Coast to
Europe, she said.  “Exports should continue at the pace we’re seeing now
because the demand is absolutely there,” Sen said. “Europe is
facing widespread refinery run cuts and as long as they’re down,
the spread will stay wide. Margins will be good.”  Including freight costs, the profit to buy diesel and ship
it to Northwest Europe was $15.21 per metric ton on Sept. 6,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Profits averaged about
$8.03 a ton so far this year.  Profit Margin  The spread is the difference between first-month swaps for
10ppm diesel cargoes in Northwest Europe and the sum of ultra-low-sulfur diesel spot prices on the Gulf Coast, as compiled by
Bloomberg, and first-month swaps for TC14, the route between the
Gulf and Europe, based on Baltic Exchange data.  “A lot of bulls out there have an expectation that we’re
going to see very strong demand this season,”  Phil Flynn ,
senior market analyst at Price Futures Group in  Chicago , said by
phone Sept. 6. “We’ve seen such a high rate of exports to  Latin
America  and Europe. They’re consuming a lot and the U.S. is
filling that void.”  Money managers, including hedge funds, commodity pools and
commodity-trading advisers, raised bullish diesel wagers by
2,905 futures and options combined, the ninth increase in 10
weeks, according to the CFTC report.  In other markets, hedge funds cut net-long positions in WTI
crude by 11,552 futures and options combined, or 3.6 percent, to
305,971, the CFTC report showed.  WTI Falls  WTI slid 47 cents, or 0.4 percent, to $108.54 a barrel on
the Nymex in the week covered by the report. Futures climbed to
close at a two-year high of $110.53 on Sept. 6. Futures declined
69 cents to $109.84 today.  Money managers cut bullish bets on  Brent crude  by 7,057
contracts, or 3 percent, to 224,905 in the week ended Sept. 3,
according to data released today from ICE Futures Europe.  Brent advanced $1.32 a barrel, or 1.2 percent, to $115.68
in the week covered by the report, and declined 1.4 percent
today to $114.46 as of 9:33 a.m. New York time.  Speculative  gasoline  wagers rose by 4,333 futures and
options combined, or 6.9 percent, to 66,985, the CFTC report
showed.  Gasoline futures dropped 16.95 cents, or 5.6 percent, to
$2.8646 a gallon in the report week. Prices closed at $2.8537 on
Sept. 6 and were down 1.3 percent at $2.8161 today.  Regular  gasoline  at the pump, averaged nationwide, fell 0.1
cent to $3.57 a gallon yesterday, the lowest level since Aug.
28, according to Heathrow, Florida-based AAA, the largest U.S.
motoring group.  Gas Bets  Net-long wagers on four U.S.  natural gas  contracts added
9,233 futures equivalents, or 3.6 percent, to 268,556, the
highest level since the week ended July 30, according to the
CFTC data.  The measure includes an index of four contracts adjusted to
futures equivalents: Nymex natural gas futures, Nymex  Henry Hub 
Swap Futures, Nymex ClearPort Henry Hub Penultimate Swaps and
the ICE Futures U.S. Henry Hub contract. Henry Hub, in Erath,
 Louisiana , is the delivery point for Nymex futures, a benchmark
price for the fuel.  Futures climbed 13.2 cents, or 3.7 percent, to $3.666 per
million British thermal units during the report week before
declining to close at $3.53 on Sept. 6. They were up 1.6 percent
at $3.585 today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
