Second-seeded  Rafael Nadal  has taken
a two-sets-to-one lead against top-seeded Novak Djokovic in the
U.S. Open men’s final in a duel of former champions.  Nadal, 27, of  Spain , won the third set 6-4 after losing his
serve twice in a row while dropping the second set 6-3. He won
the first set 6-2 at the National Tennis Center in  New York .  Nadal, who is 21-0 on hard courts this season, had lost
only one game on serve in his first six matches of the
tournament. He has lost it three times so far today.  Djokovic broke Nadal’s serve for the first time in the
sixth game of the second set, winning the game on a 54-shot
rally and pumping his arms above his head in triumph as he took
a 4-2 lead.  That celebration was short-lived, as Nadal broke right back
in the next game. Djokovic responded with another break of
serve, though, and then served out the set.  Djokovic opened the third set with another service break,
giving him three in a row. Nadal broke back to tie the score
3-3. In the ninth game of the third set, Nadal had to save three
break points. After winning that game, Nadal immediately broke
Djokovic’s serve to take the set.  It is the third time in four years that the two have met in
the final -- Nadal won in 2010 and Djokovic triumphed in 2011.
Last year, with Nadal sidelined by a knee injury, Djokovic lost
to  Andy Murray  in the final.  Nadal and Djokovic are playing for the 37th time, the most
of any men’s rivalry in the professional era of tennis that
began in 1968. They had been tied with  Ivan Lendl  and  John
McEnroe  with 36 meetings. Nadal leads the head-to-head contest
21-15.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
