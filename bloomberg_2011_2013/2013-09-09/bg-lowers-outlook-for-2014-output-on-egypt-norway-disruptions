BG Group Plc (BG/) , the U.K.’s third-largest oil and gas producer, said production next year will be
lower than expected because of unrest in  Egypt , a project delay
in  Norway  and depressed U.S. natural-gas prices.  Turmoil in Egypt has delayed the West Delta Deep Marine
project and first production from the Knarr project in Norway
has been pushed back four months to the second half of next
year, Reading-based BG said in a statement in London. The
combined impact will shave 30,000 barrels a day off next year’s
production. The company will also operate fewer rigs in the
U.S., reducing next year’s volumes by 17,000 barrels a day.  The shares dropped as much as 5.4 percent to 1,212 pence in
 London  and traded at 1,232 pence at 8:04 a.m. local time.  BG stock had recovered most of the ground lost after
dropping the most on record last October, when the company said
output won’t increase in 2013. The company today maintained its
predictions for production in 2013 and reiterated that output
should rise to as much as 825,000 barrels of oil equivalent a
day in 2015.  Chief Executive Officer Chris Finlayson said July 26 that
operations hadn’t yet been affected by unrest in Egypt.
Finlayson presented BG’s new strategy on May 14, saying profit
will outpace production growth in the years ahead as liquefied
natural gas trading expands.  The company is hosting a capital markets day in London
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
