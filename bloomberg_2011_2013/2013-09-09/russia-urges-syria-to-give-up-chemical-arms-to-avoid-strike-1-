Russia urged  Syria  to give up its
stockpile of chemical weapons if doing so would help avoid a
U.S.-led military strike, Foreign Minister  Sergei Lavrov  said
after meeting his Syrian counterpart in Moscow today.  Lavrov spoke following comments by U.S. Secretary of State
 John Kerry  that suggested the U.S. may call off a military
strike if Syria handed over its chemical weapons within a week.
Asked afterward whether the U.S. has given Syria an ultimatum,
a State Department spokeswoman said Kerry was making a
“rhetorical argument” about Assad’s refusal to back down.  “If the establishment of international control of chemical
weapons in the country will help avoid military strikes, we will
immediately start working with Damascus,” Lavrov said today.
“We call on the Syrian leadership not only to agree to put
chemical weapons storages under international control, but to
also to have them destroyed subsequently.”  Russia , which has been using its UN Security Council veto
to shield Assad from international censure and supplied his
regime with weapons, has pledged to continue helping him if the
U.S. launches a strike in retaliation for a gas attack in a
Damascus suburb last month.  Russia and Syria, two Cold War-era allies, earlier today
said military strikes proposed by the U.S. won’t help end
Syria’s civil war and called instead for peace talks and the
return of United Nations chemical-weapons inspectors.  To contact the reporters on this story:
