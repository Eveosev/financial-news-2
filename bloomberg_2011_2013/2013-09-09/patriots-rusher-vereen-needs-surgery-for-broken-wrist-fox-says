New England Patriots  running back
Shane Vereen will miss the next few weeks of the National
Football League season after breaking his wrist in the team’s
season-opening win over the Buffalo Bills, Fox Sports reported.  Vereen, whose 101 yards in New England’s 23-21 victory
yesterday are the second most among rushers so far in the first
week of the season, broke a small bone in his wrist early in the
game, Fox Sports said on its  website , without identifying its
source. Vereen experienced numbness after the game because the
bone sits on a nerve, Fox said.  Patriots coach  Bill Belichick  didn’t mention the injury on
a conference call today with reporters. An e-mail seeking
comment from Stacey James, a team spokesman, wasn’t immediately
returned.  New England, which hosts the  New York  Jets on Sept. 12,
lists fourth-year player LeGarrette Blount second on its depth
chart behind Vereen, and James Develin third.  To contact the reporter on this story:
