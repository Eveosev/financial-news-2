Taiwan’s bonds rose, snapping a
four-day decline, after U.S. companies hired fewer workers than
economists predicted, which may influence the Federal Reserve’s
plans to pare monetary stimulus this month.  Non-farm payrolls in the U.S. climbed 169,000 in August,
trailing the median estimate for a 180,000 increase in a
Bloomberg survey, while July figures were revised lower to
162,000 from 104,000. The Fed has indicated the jobs market
needs to show signs of improvement to warrant any trimming of
asset purchases as policy makers prepare to meet Sept. 17-18 to
review the plan.  The yield on the bonds due September 2023 dropped one basis
point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 1.782 percent in when-issued
trading as of 10:08 a.m. in Taipei, according to Gretai
Securities Market. The notes are due to be officially auctioned
Sept. 14. The rate climbed six basis points last week.  “U.S. non-farm payrolls weren’t that great, and yields
have been rising for some time now, so they fell a little, but
people are still a little conservative,” said Tobby Lin, a
fixed-income trader at Yuanta Securities Co. in Taipei.  Taiwan is due to report trade data for August today, with
economists in a Bloomberg survey predicting exports rose 4
percent, compared with a 1.6 percent increase in July. Imports
probably climbed 2.6 percent following a 7.6 percent contraction,
resulting in a trade surplus of $3.67 billion.  The Taiwan dollar strengthened 0.5 percent to NT$29.759
against the greenback, Taipei Forex Inc. prices show. One-month
non-deliverable forwards fell 0.1 percent to NT$29.679 per
dollar, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  One-month implied volatility, a gauge of expected moves in
the exchange rate used to price options, decreased three basis
points to 4.14 percent.  The  overnight interbank lending rate  was little changed at
0.388 percent, a weighted average compiled by the Taiwan
Interbank Money Center showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
