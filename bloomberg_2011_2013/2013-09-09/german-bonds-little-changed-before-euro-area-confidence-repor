Germany ’s 10-year bonds were little
changed, with yields near the highest in 17 months, as investors
speculated on whether the  Federal Reserve  will reduce its bond-buying program this month.  Italian securities were little changed amid concern a
Senate committee discussion on whether to expel former Prime
Minister  Silvio Berlusconi  will disrupt the coalition
government’s stability. The additional yield investors demand to
hold Treasuries over German bunds fell after data last week
showed U.S. payrolls rose less in August than analysts forecast,
damping the case for tapering stimulus. Germany plans to sell
five billion euros ($6.6 billion) of 10-year debt on Wednesday.  “The fact is that the U.S. labor market does remain soggy
so that raises a question of timing for the Fed,” said  Luca Jellinek , head of European interest-rate strategy at Credit
Agricole Corporate & Investment Bank in  London . “Also, how much
of a taper? The market looks very much like just settling down
and not wanting to go anywhere.”  Germany’s 10-year bund yielded 1.95 percent at 4:38 p.m.
London time after reaching 2.05 percent on Sept. 6, the highest
since March 21, 2012. The price of the 1.5 percent security due
May 2023 was at 96.035.  Fed policy makers will decide to reduce Treasury bond
purchases to $35 billion each month from $45 billion at their
Sept. 17-18 meeting while maintaining mortgage-bond buying at
$40 billion, according to the median of 34 responses from
economists surveyed by  Bloomberg News  on Sept. 6. That pace was
unchanged from an Aug. 9-13 survey.  Treasuries Spread  The yield difference between 10-year bunds and similar-maturity U.S. Treasuries narrowed five basis points, or 0.05
percentage point, to 93 basis points, down from as much as 104
basis points on Aug. 1.  The Treasury 10-year yield dropped five basis points to
2.89 percent.  Spain ’s  10-year yield  was little changed at 4.54 percent
and the rate on similar-maturity Italian bonds was at 4.52
percent. The additional yield investors demand to hold the
Spanish securities over  Italy ’s slid to as little as one basis
point earlier, the least in 18 months.  An Italian Senate committee begins discussions today about
whether to expel Berlusconi following his conviction for  tax
fraud . The three-time former premier threatened Aug. 30 to
withdraw his party’s support for the coalition government if the
senators vote to eject him from parliament.  Political Issues  “We still view the spread narrowing between Spain and
Italy, and if anything Spain to trade below Italy just because
of the Italian political issues,” said Lyn Graham-Taylor, a
fixed-income strategist at Rabobank International in London.
“We don’t expect any immediate decision but obviously it’s got
quite large ramifications for Italian politics.”  Volatility on Belgian bonds was the highest in euro-area
markets today followed by those of Finland and  Austria ,
according to measures of 10-year debt, the yield spread between
two- and 10-year securities, and credit-default swaps. Finland’s
10-year yield was little changed at 2.24 percent.  Germany last sold 10-year bonds on Aug. 14 at an average
yield of 1.80 percent, up from 1.57 percent at a July 17 sale.  German bonds lost 2.6 percent this year through Sept. 6,
according to Bloomberg World Bond Indexes. Italian securities
returned 3.1 percent, while Spain’s earned 7.7 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
