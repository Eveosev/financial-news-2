Evolva Holding SA (EVE)  gained the most in
a month after the Swiss developer of food ingredients said an
alliance to develop and sell sweeteners with Cargill Inc. is
proceeding faster than originally planned.  Evolva  climbed  as much as 9.2 percent to 83 Swiss centimes
in Zurich, the steepest intraday gain since Aug. 9. The shares
have more than doubled this year, giving the company a market
value of 196 million francs ($209 million). The stock traded
6.6 percent higher at 81 centimes at 9:21 a.m. local time.  The company is developing fermentation-derived steviol
glycosides for use in sweet, low-calorie food products. The
project is entering a pilot phase this year, rather than in 2014
as originally planned, the Reinach-based company said in a
statement today.  Evolva announced the alliance with Cargill in March, when
it said the Minneapolis-based company would buy a 5 million-franc stake in Evolva and pay as much as $7.5 million in
milestone payments.  To contact the reporter on this story:
