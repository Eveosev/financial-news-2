Italian Prime Minister Enrico Letta
said confidence in  Europe  is improving and the economy is still
fragile.  “I do not assume that the crisis is behind us and we can
turn our attention away from economic matters,” he said in a
speech late today in Brussels. He also said the European Union
needs to find ways to ensure the euro is more resilient to
shocks, possibly through more risk-sharing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
