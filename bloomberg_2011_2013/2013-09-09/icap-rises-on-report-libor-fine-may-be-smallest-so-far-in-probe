ICAP Plc (IAP) , the world’s largest broker
of trades between banks, rose as much as 5.1 percent in London
after  Sky News  said it faces the lowest fine so far in the
global probe into the rigging of benchmark interest rates.  The interdealer broker may pay about 70 million pounds
($110 million) to the U.K.’s Financial Conduct Authority and the
U.S. Department of Justice and Commodity Futures Trading
Commission, Sky reported, without saying where it got the
information. The figure may change because a final agreement is
yet to be reached, Sky said.  At 70 million pounds, the settlement would be within the 50
million-pound to 100 million-pound range  Morgan Stanley (MS)  analyst
Anil Sharma published on Sept. 4. It’s also less than the 290
million pounds  Barclays Plc (BARC)  paid last year when it became the
first company to be fined for rigging the London interbank
offered rate, the benchmark for more than $300 trillion of
securities from mortgages to student loans.  The stock climbed as much as 20.4 pence and was up 18.1
pence at 417.60 pence as of 3:25 p.m. in London trading.
