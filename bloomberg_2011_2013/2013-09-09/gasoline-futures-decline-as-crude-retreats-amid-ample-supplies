Gasoline declined as crude retreated
from a two-year high and as motor fuel inventories were above-average for this time of year.  Futures fell as much as 1.6 percent. President  Barack
Obama , in television interviews today and a speech to the nation
tomorrow, seeks support to act against  Syria  for its alleged use
of chemical weapons on civilians. Gasoline  demand  over the four
weeks ended Aug. 30 was 0.3 percent below a year earlier,
according to data from the Energy Information Administration.
Inventories were 8.6 percent above a year earlier.  “The crude oil market is awaiting President Obama’s speech
tomorrow and the outcome of congressional deliberations,” said
 Andy Lipow , president of Lipow Oil Associates LLC in Houston.
“Gasoline is under additional pressure due to high inventories
at the end of the gasoline driving season.”  Gasoline for October delivery fell 2.36 cents, or 0.8
percent, to $2.8301 a gallon at 10:12 a.m. on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange . Trading volume was 14 percent above the
100-day average. Prices touched $2.8073, the lowest intraday
level since July 3.  WTI Texas Intermediate crude, which reached the highest
since May 2011 on Sept. 6, dropped 81 cents to $109.72 a barrel
on the Nymex.  The motor fuel’s  crack spread  versus West Texas
Intermediate crude slipped 13 cents to $9.20 a barrel while the
fuel’s  premium  over Brent widened 65 cents to $4.39.  Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has denied using the
weapons in an Aug. 21 massacre. Syria’s government and its
Russian ally called for peace talks and the return of United
Nations chemical-weapons inspectors, countering Obama’s call for
a narrowly targeted, rapidly executed strike on Assad’s war-making capability.  Pump prices , averaged nationwide, fell 0.1 cent to $3.57 a
gallon, Heathrow, Florida-based AAA said today on its website.
Retail gasoline is 25.2 cents below a year earlier.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel for October delivery fell 2.49
cents, or 0.8 percent, to $3.1388 a gallon on trading volume
that was 25 percent below the 100-day average.  ULSD’s  crack spread  versus WTI narrowed 16 cents to $22.19
a barrel while the  premium  over Brent increased 49 cents to
$17.25.  To contact the reporter on this story:
