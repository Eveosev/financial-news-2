The U.K. should set up a fund using
tax revenues from shale gas production to help it meet
environmental goals, Energy Secretary  Ed Davey  said.  “I want us to be a country that invests for the future, a
low-carbon future using shale gas revenues,” he said today at a
conference in London.  His Liberal Democrat party will discuss a low-carbon
transition fund established from tax revenues from any future
shale gas production at its conference this month, he said.  Shale gas is not a “quick fix” or “silver bullet” to
meeting Britain’s demand, he said. The U.K. may not feel the
benefits from developing a shale industry until the 2020s, he
said. The resource must be developed alongside renewable
technologies to tackle climate change and form part of a global
move from coal to less polluting gas, he said.  Shale gas could be a “key and valuable” part of a more
diverse energy mix in the U.K. as North Sea gas supplies
dwindle, helping to curb reliance on imports, Davey said.  Regulations the U.K. has imposed on the industry must be
followed “to the letter” to protect local environments as the
industry develops, he said. Shale gas exploration will not cause
earthquakes, contaminate water supplies, or compromise a focus
on renewable energy and meeting climate change goals, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
