Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  is moving
brokerage accounts for some current and former employees with
less than $1 million in assets to  Fidelity Investments ,
according to a person briefed on the decision.  The move provides more investment choices and services for
employees who don’t fit the firm’s wealth-management focus on
high-net worth clients, typically those with assets of more than
$10 million, said the person, who asked to remain anonymous
because the policy wasn’t public.  Goldman Sachs had overseen the employee accounts through
its private wealth management group within its asset management
division. Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein, 58, said
earlier this year that he’s devoting a high percentage of his
attention to improving performance of that unit, which has had
outflows each of the last three years.  The firm ensures that “current and former employees
receive the right tools and services,”  David Wells , a Goldman
Sachs spokesman in New York, said in an e-mailed statement. New
York Magazine reported the change earlier.  Fidelity will help Goldman Sachs continue to monitor
employee trading for compliance purposes, the person said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
