The naira strengthened the most this
month, erasing earlier declines, after the Nigerian central bank
sold the largest amount of dollars in two weeks at an auction.  The currency of  Africa ’s biggest crude producer appreciated
0.5 percent to 162.60 per dollar as of 4:43 p.m. in Lagos, the
commercial capital, its biggest gain since Aug. 30, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  The  Central Bank of Nigeria  sold $300 million at a foreign-exchange auction to lenders today, it said in an e-mailed
statement. That’s the most at a sale since Aug. 26, according to
data on its website. The regulator, which sells dollars at
twice-weekly auctions to support the naira, is the country’s
major supplier of foreign currency.  “Increased dollar supply by the central bank reduced
pressure on the naira, prompting the local unit to strengthen,”
Tunde Ladipo, the chief executive of Lagos-based Valuechain
Investment Ltd., said by phone.  The yield on  Nigeria ’s Eurobonds due January 2021 slipped
two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 5.875 percent.  Ghana ’s cedi weakened 0.1 percent to 2.1800 per dollar in
the capital, Accra, its lowest level on record.  To contact the reporter on this story:
