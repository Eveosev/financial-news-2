Canadian  building permits  rose to a
record in July as the value of projects such as shopping malls
and office buildings almost doubled, government figures showed.  The value of municipal permits rose 20.7 percent to C$7.99
billion ($7.70 billion), Statistics  Canada  said today in Ottawa.
The gain exceeded all 10 forecasts in a Bloomberg economist
survey that had a median increase of 3.5 percent.  Permits for non-residential construction  rose 45.5 percent
to a record C$3.86 billion, including an 89.2 percent jump in
commercial buildings to C$2.56 billion.  Cabela’s Inc. (CAB) , a fishing
and hunting retailer, said July 25 it would begin work on a
70,000 square foot store in Barrie, Ontario that will open next
year.  The country’s dollar rose after the report added to signs
that domestic demand continues to lead the world’s 11th-largest
economy as exports falter. Statistics Canada reported faster-than-expected job growth last week and said Aug. 30 that
consumption led output growth during the second quarter.  “It’s a good sign for the economy” and may add to growth
in July, said  Benjamin Reitzes , a senior economist at BMO
Capital Markets in Toronto. The gains in commercial permits
still aren’t “sustainable,” he said.  The building permits figures have been volatile, with a
gain of as much as 29 percent and a decline of 23 percent
reported since the start of 2011.  Dollar gains  Canada’s dollar extended gains after the report,
strengthening 0.3 percent to C$1.0377 per U.S. dollar at 10:07
a.m. in Toronto after touching C$1.0364, the strongest since
Aug. 20. One dollar buys 96.37 U.S. cents.  Statistics Canada said today that the value of  residential 
building permits rose 4.1 percent in July to C$4.14 billion.
Single-family housing permits also rose by 4.1 percent, to
C$2.24 billion, while multiple-unit projects such as apartments
and condominiums increased 4.2 percent to C$1.89 billion.  The housing market gains come as Bank of Canada policy
makers predict housing will be a drag on economic growth this
year and next, after they warned about overbuilding in cities
such as Toronto and  Vancouver . The central bank last week kept
its key lending rate at 1 percent and said there are signs of a
“constructive evolution” of household imbalances after debt
levels reached a record share of income last year.  The value of permits in July was 17.2 percent higher than
12 months earlier, Statistics Canada said. The agency today also
revised its estimate of June’s decrease to 10.6 percent from
10.3 percent.  By province, permits rose the most in Ontario on commercial
projects while British Columbia intentions dropped, led by
multi-family housing and commercial work, Statistics Canada
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
