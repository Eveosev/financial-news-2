The cost of hauling iron ore is
poised to rise to a three-year high after shipments to  China 
expanded to a record, boosting returns for  Nippon Yusen K.K. (9101)  and
other commodity carriers.  Freight swaps anticipate daily rates for Capesizes, the
biggest ore ships, will average $28,000 in the fourth quarter,
or 3.6 percent more than now, data from Clarkson Securities Ltd.
and the Baltic Exchange in London show. The contracts more than
tripled since June. Shares of Tokyo-based Nippon Yusen, the
largest operator of the 1,000-foot vessels, will advance 3.7
percent in 12 months, the average of 13 analyst estimates
compiled by Bloomberg shows.  Rebar steel, used in construction,  rallied  10 percent in
Shanghai trading in the past three months and iron-ore imports
reached an all-time high in July, signs the second-biggest
economy may be strengthening. China buys about two-thirds of all
seaborne iron-ore supply, the second-largest commodity cargo
after oil. The surge in demand is diminishing a glut of shipping
capacity and returning Capesizes to profit.  “China will continue to import a robust amount of iron
ore,” said  Jeffrey Landsberg , the managing director of
Commodore Research, a New York-based adviser to ship owners.
“Strong demand for steel in China is going to give Capesize
rates significant support.”  Break Even  Rates increased more than fivefold to $27,036 this year,
according to the Baltic Exchange, which publishes shipping costs
along more than 50 maritime routes. Capesizes, each hauling
150,000 metric tons of ore, need about $14,500 to break even,
according to RS Platou Markets AS, an investment bank in Oslo.
Earnings are still 88 percent below the record $233,988 set in
June 2008.  Shares of Nippon Yusen, which operates 126 Capesizes, rose
55 percent to 318 yen ($3.17) in  Tokyo  trading this year and
will reach 329.85 yen in 12 months, the analyst estimates show.
The vessels comprise about a third of the company’s fleet
capacity. Nippon Yusen also hauls manufactured goods on
container ships and oil on tankers.  Mitsui O.S.K. Lines Ltd. (9104) ,
based in Tokyo, is the second-largest Capesize owner, according
to Clarkson Plc, the biggest shipbroker.  Rebar stockpiles held by traders in China dropped to 6.45
million tons in the week ended Sept. 6, from 10.2 million tons
in March, according to Shanghai Steelhome Information, a
government-backed research company. Iron ore at the northeastern
port of Tianjin reached $135.20 a ton today, after rallying 22
percent from this year’s low in May, according to The Steel
Index Ltd., part of McGraw Hill Financial Inc.  Growth Target  The surge in prices may choke off demand in an economy that
is projected to expand 7.5 percent this year, the least since
1990, according to the median of 46 economist forecasts compiled
by Bloomberg. China may cut its annual growth target for next
year to 7 percent,  Fan Jianping , chief economist at the State
Information Center under the National Development and Reform
Commission, said in a Sept. 7 interview.  The government is seeking to tighten lending and toughen
approvals for new homes to curb housing costs that rose for a
third month in July in all but one of 70 cities tracked by the
National Bureau of Statistics.  The expansion in iron-ore cargoes still hasn’t eliminated
the glut in shipping. Capesize  capacity  jumped 79 percent since
2008, according to data from IHS Maritime, a Coulsdon, England-based maritime research company. Seaborne trade in iron ore
expanded 40 percent, according to London-based Clarkson.  Outstanding orders for new Capesizes at ship yards are
equal to 16 percent of the existing fleet, down from as much as
100 percent at the end of 2008, according to IHS Maritime data.  Vessel Surplus  Oversupply extends across most of the merchant fleet. The
ClarkSea Index, measuring industrywide earnings, averaged $9,135
a day this year, the lowest since 1990, according to Clarkson.
The  glut  of very large crude carriers, each able to haul 2
million barrels of oil, is the biggest since 1985, according to
Fearnley Consultants AS, a research company in Oslo.  Chinese investment in railroads, buildings and other
infrastructure will rise 20 percent this year, creating demand
for another 135 million tons of steel, according to Shanghai-based Citic Securities Co. That would require 200 million tons
of iron ore, enough to fill 180 Capesizes, estimates Fearnley
Consultants.  The nation’s daily crude-steel output averaged 2.15 million
tons in the first seven months, from 1.95 million tons a year
earlier, according to China International Capital Corp. Rebar,
used to reinforce concrete, will average 4,000  yuan  ($653) a ton
in the fourth quarter, the highest in a year, according to the
median of 15 analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Annual Earnings  Nippon Yusen will report a 71 percent gain in net income to
32.25 billion yen in its fiscal year ending March 31, according
to the mean of 16 analyst estimates. Mitsui O.S.K. will report
earnings of 45.9 billion yen this fiscal year, from a loss of
178.8 billion yen, the average of 16 predictions shows. Eight
out of 12 companies in the Bloomberg Dry Ships Index will narrow
losses or report a profit in 2013, according to the forecasts
compiled by Bloomberg.  Australia ’s Port Hedland, the world’s biggest bulk
terminal, shipped 22.3 million tons of iron ore to China last
month, 34 percent more than a year earlier, port data show.
Brazilian exports of 31.2 million tons were the highest for the
month in two years, according to government data. Australia is
the biggest supplier and  Brazil  is the second largest.  Global trade in iron ore will expand 6 percent to 1.17
billion tons this year, with China taking 66 percent of the
cargoes, Clarkson predicts. Volumes across dry-bulk commodities
that also include coal and grains will rise 5 percent to 4.3
billion tons, the shipbroker estimates.  “More fleet capacity will be absorbed,” said Rune Sand,
an analyst at Carnegie SA in Oslo whose recommendations on the
shares of shipping companies returned 14 percent in the past
year. “We should see Capesize rates pick up substantially.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
