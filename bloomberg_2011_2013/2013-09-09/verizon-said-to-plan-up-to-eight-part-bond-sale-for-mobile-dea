Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ)  plans to
finance its purchase of  Vodafone Group Plc (VOD) ’s stake in their
mobile phone unit with an offering of as many as eight parts
that may exceed Apple Inc.’s record issue in April.  Verizon may sell three-, five-, seven-, 10-, 20- and 30-year debt as soon as Sept. 11, a person with knowledge of the
offering said. The portions due 2016 and 2018 may consist of
fixed- and floating-rate debt, said the person, who asked not to
be identified because terms aren’t set.  The phone company with $49.2 billion of  bonds  is seeking as
much as $50 billion in notes for a $130 billion transaction to
acquire full control of Verizon Wireless, the most profitable
U.S. mobile carrier. The deal is being managed by Barclays Plc,
Bank of America Corp., JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Morgan Stanley,
New York-based Verizon said today in a regulatory filing that
didn’t include the maturities for the issue.  The offering is poised to be the largest bond sale on
record, potentially topping Apple’s $17 billion issue on April
30, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. This week’s initial
sale may reach about $20 billion to $30 billion, mostly
dominated in dollars, but also including euros, British pounds
and possibly Japanese yen, Societe Generale SA analysts wrote in
a report dated Sept. 8.  Fixed, Floating  Verizon’s three-year fixed-rate notes may yield about 165
basis points more than similar-maturity Treasuries; the five-year debt may pay a spread of about 190 basis points; the seven-year securities may pay about 215 basis points; the 10-year debt
may pay about 225 basis points; the 20-year notes may pay about
250 basis points; and the 30-year bonds may pay about 265, the
person said.  The floating-rate notes due September 2016 may yield about
150 basis points more than the three-month London interbank
offered rate and the five-year securities may pay about 175 over
Libor, a borrowing benchmark, the person said. Libor was set
today at 0.2559 percent. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  The debt is expected to be ranked Baa1 by Moody’s Investors
Service and BBB+ at Standard & Poor’s, both three levels above
junk, after the two ratings firms cut Verizon’s credit grade
last week following the announcement of the transaction with
Vodafone.  Yields on the Bank of America Merrill Lynch U.S.
Telecommunications Index reached 4.16 percent on Sept. 6 from
3.88 percent at the end of August as investors anticipated the
Verizon offering.  To contact the reporters on this story:
