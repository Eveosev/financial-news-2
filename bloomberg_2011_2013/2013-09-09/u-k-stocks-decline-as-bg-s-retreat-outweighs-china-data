U.K. stocks  declined, after the
benchmark  FTSE 100 Index (UKX)  posted its first weekly gain in a
month, as a drop in BG Group Plc outweighed a report that showed
Chinese exports rose more than estimated.  BG tumbled the most in 10 months, contributing the most to
a decline in the FTSE 100, after lowering its forecast on 2014
production. Tate & Lyle Plc lost 3.4 percent after UBS AG
downgraded the shares. Rio Tinto Group paced an advance by U.K.
mining companies.  The FTSE 100 Index slid 16.59 points, or 0.3 percent, to
6,530.74 at the close in London. The gauge rose 2.1 percent last
week on bets that any reduction in Federal Reserve stimulus will
be less steep than previously anticipated and as manufacturing
growth beat estimates in the U.S. and  China . The broader FTSE
All-Share Index slipped 0.2 percent today, while Ireland’s ISEQ
Index fell less than 0.1 percent.  “Investors are very sensitive to changes in guidance from
BG,” said Guy Foster, a London-based portfolio strategist at
Brewin Dolphin Ltd., which manages 28 billion pounds ($44
billion). “They have reiterated their guidance for 2013, which
ought to be reassuring, but right now, it’s natural for
investors to look for cracks in their production forecasts.”  The volume of shares traded in FTSE 100-listed companies
was 7.7 percent lower than the 30-day average, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  BG Production  BG slid 5.1 percent to 1,217 pence, its biggest drop since
Oct. 31, 2012. The U.K.’s third-biggest oil and gas producer
said next year’s production will be reduced by 30,000 barrels a
day because of unrest in  Egypt , a project delay in  Norway  and
lower natural-gas prices in the U.S. BG kept its predictions for
2013 production and reiterated that output will climb to as much
as 825,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day in 2015.  Tate & Lyle declined 3.4 percent to 779.5 pence as UBS
downgraded the shares to sell, from neutral, saying the stock is
too expensive and does not sufficiently reflect the risks of a
decrease in sucralose prices. The company, which sells sucralose
under the Splenda sweetener brand, is trading at 14 times
earnings, compared with 9.6 times a year ago, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Associated British Foods Plc (ABF)  lost 1.8 percent to 1,818
pence. The U.K. maker of Ryvita crispbread and owner of the
Primark budget clothing chain said sugar prices in  Europe  will
remain under pressure. Price negotiations with sugar customers
in the European Union are “proving challenging with an
increasingly negative sentiment,” the company said.  Mining Companies  A  gauge  of mining stocks rose as much as the highest level
in more than three weeks as data showed China’s  exports  exceeded
forecasts in August. Overseas shipments rose 7.2 percent in
August from a year earlier, the General Administration of
Customs said. The median prediction of economists surveyed by
Bloomberg was for a 5.5 percent increase.  Rio Tinto , the second-biggest commodity producer, advanced
1.1 percent to 3,130.5 pence. Glencore Xstrata Plc added 0.9
percent to 321.3 pence. Anglo American Plc climbed 0.9 percent
to 1,594.5 pence.  Burberry Group Plc climbed 2.2 percent to 1,635 pence, its
highest price since the luxury-goods maker sold shares to the
public in July 2002, after HSBC Holdings Plc added the shares to
its “Europe Super Ten” list.  “Short term, we are more positive on sales than the
consensus and, as a result, expect upgrades to full-year
consensus estimates,” HSBC strategists led by Robert Parkes
wrote in a note. The company will benefit from its investments
in the digital medium, which will give it a long-term
competitive advantage over the rest of the industry, they wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
