BBA Aviation Plc (BBA) , the world’s
biggest provider of bases for  business jets , fell as much as 4.1
percent after it said merger talks with Dubai Aerospace
Enterprise Ltd. had ended.  BBA, which said Aug. 26 it was in talks with Dubai
Aerospace to combine certain parts of the business, did not give
a reason why the discussions had ceased. Shares in BBA Aviation,
which had risen about 3.8 percent since the merger plans were
trading 1.7 percent lower at 313.40 pence in London today,
valuing the business at 1.5 billion pounds ($2.4 billion).  DAE, which was set up in 2006 with the aim of becoming one
of the world’s biggest aircraft lessors, said in a statement
yesterday talks were no longer active on a transaction that
would have given it a large stake in BBA Aviation. The Dubai-based company dropped most of its aircraft purchases since its
finances weakened in the global recession.  The Sunday Times reported last month that BBA was in talks
to purchase its U.S. rival Standard Aero and that DAE, which
owns the Arizona-based engine repair and maintenance business,
may take a stake in the enlarged business. Such a transaction
would value the combined business at 2.7 billion pounds and
Standard Aero at 1.3 billion pounds, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
