Polish bonds rose for a second day,
sending the five-year yield down by the most since June, on
speculation a selloff last week spurred by government proposals
to reform the pension system was overdone.  The yields on five-year  government bonds  slumped 16 basis
points to 4.01 percent at 5:35 p.m. in Warsaw, after rising to
4.24 percent on Sept. 5, the highest since Sept. 25. The zloty
gained 0.2 percent to 4.2708 against the euro, extending its
quarter-to-date advance to 1.3 percent, the second-best
performance among 24 emerging-market currencies tracked by
Bloomberg, behind  South Korea ’s won.  Yields climbed to the highest level in almost a year last
week after the government said it planned to cancel zloty bonds
held by privately-managed pension funds and ban the institutions
from buying the securities. The funds will keep current assets
that they invested in stocks and future contributions to the
system by Poles will be “voluntary,” Prime Minister Donald
Tusk said on Sept. 4.  The impact on yields last week was “a bit overstated,”
said Michal Jochymek, a senior central and eastern Europe fixed-income trader at BNP Paribas SA in Warsaw. “Foreign buyers
started bidding more aggressively after the selloff.”  The government’s gross borrowing needs will fall to 131.8
billion zloty ($41 billion) next year from 166.4 billion zloty
in 2013, deputy Finance Minister Wojciech Kowalczyk said in a
statement Sept. 7.  To contact the reporter on this story:
