The commander of  Turkey ’s Land Forces inspected troops at the border with Syria, hours after combat aircraft attacked nearby Syrian communities, the state-run Anatolia news agency said.  General Hulusi Akar was accompanied by General Galip Mendi, whose 2nd Army is in charge of protecting frontier areas, Anatolia reported today. Bombs from the warplanes fell in empty fields near the town of Tal Abyad and village of Yapse across from the Turkish border town of Akcakale, the news agency said. Turkey scrambled F-16 warplanes for a second time in as many days after the attack.  Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said yesterday conditions will determine whether Turkey plays a combat or logistics role in any international attack on Syria over its alleged use of chemical weapons on Aug. 21, the Sabah newspaper reported. Erdogan, without elaborating, has said Turkey is willing to join any coalition of countries that agrees to take military action against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s government.  “In Syria, more than 100,000 people have been assassinated by their own government, a dictator who does not mind bombing his own cities, who does not mind killing his own people,”  Egemen Bagis , Turkish minister for European Union negotiations, said in a Bloomberg Television interview today. “This has to stop.”  Supporting Rebels  Turkey, whose border with Syria stretches more than 900 kilometers (560 miles), has been supporting Syrian rebels fighting Assad. Turkey’s Incirlik Air Base, used in the past by U.S. forces imposing a no-fly zone over northern  Iraq , is about 100 kilometers from the Syrian border.  The Turkish army, the second largest in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in terms of numbers, deployed tanks, armored cars and missile defense units on the border after Syrian forces shot down a Turkish reconnaissance plane in eastern Mediterranean in June 2012.  Troops moved more weaponry to the border after the Aug. 21 attack in  Syria , Anatolia said. Other NATO members have deployed Patriot missile batteries in the region to help defend Turkey against a possible attack from Syria.  Turkey is preparing for “all kind of options,” Bagis said.
