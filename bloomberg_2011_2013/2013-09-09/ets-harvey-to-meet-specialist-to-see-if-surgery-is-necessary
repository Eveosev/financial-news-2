New York  Mets pitcher Matt Harvey
will meet with surgeon James Andrews this week to help determine
if the right-hander will require reconstructive surgery on a
partially torn ligament in his right elbow.  Mets manager Terry Collins said before yesterday’s game
that Harvey will see Andrews, though no date has been set. If
Harvey, who was diagnosed with a torn ulnar collateral ligament
on Aug. 26, needs the ligament transplant procedure known as
Tommy John surgery, he’d probably miss all of the 2014 season.  The 24-year-old Harvey, who was the starting pitcher for
the National League in this year’s All-Star Game at the Mets’
Citi Field, went 9-5 with a 2.27 earned run average this year.  When he was shut down, Mets General Manager  Sandy Alderson 
said the determination of whether Harvey will need Tommy John
surgery wouldn’t be made until after the swelling in his arm
went down. Alderson said yesterday on MLB Network Radio that the
Mets hope to know whether Harvey will need reconstructive
surgery by the third or fourth week of September.  To contact the reporter on this story:
