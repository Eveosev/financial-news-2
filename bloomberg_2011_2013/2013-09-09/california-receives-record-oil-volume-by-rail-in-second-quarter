California ’s refiners  received  a
record amount of crude by rail in the second quarter, more than
tripling the volume from a year earlier, as shipments from
Colorado, North Dakota and other states grew.  California brought in 748,802 barrels of oil by rail from
April through June, up from 215,694  a year earlier  and from
638,112 in the first quarter, data posted on the state Energy
Commission website showed. Crude from North Dakota accounted for
317,122 barrels, or 42 percent, of the oil. The state also
received 225,201 barrels from Colorado and 76,648 from  Canada .  The increasing rail shipments are helping refiners in
California, the world’s ninth-largest economy, replace costlier
supplies from within the state, Alaska and abroad.  That access will help “drive prices lower across the
entire slate,” Paul Y. Cheng, an analyst at  Barclays Plc (BARC) ’s
investment-banking unit in New York, said in an e-mailed note
Sept. 3. “A combination of several factors could drive a $3-$4/bl reduction across the entire crude slate, over time.”  Petroleum companies report oil receipts by rail to
California’s energy commission on a quarterly basis, with June
being the latest month available.  To contact the reporter on this story:
