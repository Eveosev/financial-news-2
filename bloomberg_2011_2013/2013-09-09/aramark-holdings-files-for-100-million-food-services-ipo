Aramark Holdings Corp. , the provider
of institutional food and facilities services in 22 countries,
filed to raise $100 million in an initial public offering.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co., Credit
Suisse Group AG and Morgan Stanley are leading the IPO,
according to a regulatory filing today. The amount sought is a
placeholder used to calculate fees and may change. Philadelphia-based Aramark applied to list on the New York Stock Exchange.  The IPO paves the way for Aramark’s owners, including
Chairman Joseph Neubauer, Goldman Sachs, Thomas H. Lee Partners
LP and Warburg Pincus LLC, to begin exiting their investment
after a 2007 buyout. U.S. stocks have rallied this year to a
record, prompting private-equity firms to begin liquidating
their stakes in portfolio companies from Quintiles Transnational
Holdings Inc. to SeaWorld Entertainment Inc.  Private-equity owners of Aramark invested more than $1.7
billion in the company’s stock in the buyout, filings show,
while Neubauer contributed $200 million. Some existing holders
may sell stock in the IPO, the company’s filing today showed,
without specifying.  Aramark will use its proceeds from the sale to repay some
debt, according to the filing. The company had $6.2 billion of
total debt at the end of June and about $98 million of cash, the
filing shows.  Goldman Sachs, Thomas H. Lee and Warburg Pincus each own
about 21 percent of Aramark’s common stock, while JPMorgan and
CCMP Capital Investors each own about 10.5 percent, company
filings show. Neubauer owns 10.2 percent.  Flat Sales  Sales at Aramark, which totaled $13.5 billion in the 12
months through September 2012, were little changed from four
years earlier, filings show. The company booked about $13
billion of sales in the twelve months through September 2011.  Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization, adjusted to exclude charges related to the 2007
acquisition, were $885 million in the nine months through June
of this year, up 7 percent from $826 million in the year-earlier
period.  Aramark  serves  more than 500 million meals a year to
students at schools and universities and has operated at least
15 Olympic Games since 1968. The company was taken private more
a buyout led by Neubauer. The sale, valued at about $8 billion
including debt, was completed in January 2007, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
