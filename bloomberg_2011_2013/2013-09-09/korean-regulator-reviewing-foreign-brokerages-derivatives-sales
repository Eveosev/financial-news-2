South Korea ’s financial regulator is
reviewing derivative sales at three foreign brokerages for
compliance with the country’s regulations.  The  Financial Supervisory Service  is conducting a partial
review of the firms, it said in an e-mailed statement yesterday,
without identifying them or releasing probe details. The FSS is
planning an industrywide investigation into derivative product
sales and began reviewing  Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) , Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. and Royal Bank of Scotland Plc’s local units in late
August, MoneyToday reported yesterday, citing unidentified
financial industry officials.  The regulator will also examine whether the firms abide by
local capital market rules, according to the online newspaper.  Credit Suisse’s Seoul-based spokeswoman Uni Park and
Goldman Sachs’s spokesman Christopher Jun declined to comment on
the MoneyToday report or whether their firms are under FSS
review. Two calls to RBS’s Hong Kong office made outside of
regular working hours were unanswered.  To contact the reporter on this story:
