EBay Inc. (EBAY) ’s PayPal unit has a
message for its 132 million users: put away your phones.  The digital payments provider introduced technology today
that lets consumers enter a store and pay without touching a
credit card or smartphone. Retailers can plug a new device,
called Beacon, into a power outlet and detect phones that have
the PayPal application, sending a notification to the cashier.  PayPal and challengers Square Inc.,  Visa Inc. (V)  and  Intuit
Inc. (INTU)  are rushing to help merchants install swipe-free payment
options to cut down on transaction time while also allowing
retailers to collect data on their customers. At stake is a
mobile-payments market that’s estimated to surge to $90 billion
in 2017 from $12.8 billion last year, according to  Forrester
Research Inc. (FORR)   “Our goal is not to make money on the hardware -- it’s to
cast a really wide net,” PayPal President David Marcus said in
an interview. “We’ve partnered with almost every point-of-sale
manufacturer. We have really wide coverage now.”  Marcus, who took the helm at PayPal last year, said he
intends to sell Beacon devices for less than $100. He introduced
the product today at the TechCrunch Disrupt conference in San
Francisco.  Beacon emits a low-energy Bluetooth signal, which
recognizes a customer’s PayPal app even if the phone has no
cellular or WiFi signal, a typical problem in department stores
with thick brick walls. When a customer is making a purchase,
the cashier already knows who the person is and automatically
charges the PayPal account even if the PayPal app isn’t running.  Beacon is compatible with payment terminals from companies
including  NCR Corp. (NCR) , Micros Systems Inc. and Shopkeep.com Inc.,
PayPal said.  NFC Problems  Google Inc. and mobile carriers such as  AT&T Inc. (T)  and
 Verizon Wireless  have tested near-field communication
technology, which lets users pay by touching a smartphone to a
credit-card terminal. That method has been criticized for being
just as inconvenient as a credit-card swipe.  Marcus is seeking to improve upon technology PayPal already
has, which requires pulling out a mobile phone at some point
during the payment process or typing account information into a
terminal.  The  San Jose , California-based company began installing
software on credit-card terminals at retailers like  Home Depot
Inc. (HD)  last year, offering the option to pay with a name and PIN
number instead of swiping a card. PayPal’s mobile app currently
lets users pay by name after pulling out a phone, opening the
app and checking into the store.  New App  PayPal updated its app last week to let users pay a bill at
a restaurant without flagging down a server. It also teamed up
with  Eat24.com LLC , adding the ability to order ahead at nearby
restaurants.  Beacon is coming to market as retailers and payment
companies aim to detect when customers are nearby so they can
push out relevant offers.  “It’s our most significant contribution to date to the
changing behavior of point of sale,” Marcus said.  Beacon is PayPal’s second piece of hardware rolled out
under Marcus. Shortly after he took over, the company introduced
PayPal Here, a card swiper that plugs into a mobile phone and
charges merchants a flat rate of 2.7 percent. The device
competes with similar products from Intuit and Square, though
PayPal hasn’t said how much it’s adding to its $20 billion in
projected mobile payment volume this year.  Payments accounted for about 38 percent of EBay’s $3.88
billion in second-quarter  revenue .  To contact the reporter on this story:
