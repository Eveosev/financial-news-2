The Pittsburgh Steelers lost
starting center Maurkice Pouncey and linebacker Larry Foote to
injuries that will probably force them to miss the rest of the
National Football League season, coach  Mike Tomlin  said.  Pouncey, selected to the Pro Bowl in each of his first
three NFL seasons, tore the anterior cruciate ligament and
medial collateral ligament in his right knee on the Steelers’
eighth offensive play in yesterday’s season-opening 16-9 loss to
the Tennessee Titans. The Steelers finished with 195 yards of
offense in the loss and quarterback  Ben Roethlisberger  was
sacked five times.  Foote, who started all 16 games last season and was the
signal-caller for the Steelers’ defense, suffered a ruptured
biceps muscle. Both players will undergo surgery, Tomlin said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
