Wal-Mart de Mexico SAB  posted its
biggest advance in two years after President Enrique Pena Nieto
avoided proposing taxes on food and medicine in a fiscal bill he
sent to Congress yesterday.  Walmex, as  Latin America ’s biggest retailer is also known,
climbed 5.5 percent to 34.09 pesos at the close of trading in
Mexico City, the most since August 2011. Supermarket chain  Grupo
Comercial Chedraui SAB (CHDRAUIB)  jumped 7.1 percent, while baker Grupo
Bimbo SAB rallied 7.7 percent. The country’s benchmark IPC index
advanced 2.6 percent, the most in 21 months.  Pena Nieto defied some predictions that he would seek to
tax food and medicine as part of efforts to bolster revenue
collection. The government is looking for ways to broaden its
tax base as part of an effort to reduce the burden for state-owned oil producer  Petroleos Mexicanos .  The bill “could give a certain sense of relief for issuers
in the commercial and food sectors,”  Carlos Hermosillo , a stock
analyst with Grupo Financiero Banorte SAB, said in a research
note today.  Soda-pop bottlers lagged the IPC after the bill called for
a tax of one peso per liter on sugary drinks.  Coca-Cola Femsa SAB (KOFL) , Latin America’s largest Coke bottler,
rose 0.1 percent, the third-worst performance among the IPC’s 35
members. Arca Continental SAB, Latin America’s second-biggest
Coke bottler, rose 1 percent today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
