Light Louisiana Sweet oil weakened
to its lowest level relative to West Texas Intermediate in 41
months as concern faded that the U.S. will attack  Syria  over its
alleged use of chemical weapons.  LLS, the light, sweet benchmark crude on the Gulf Coast,
weakened by $1.10 to a premium of $1.65 a barrel to WTI at 4:01
p.m., according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It’s the smallest
differential since April 6, 2010.  Russia said it urged its ally Syria to give up chemical
weapons to avoid a U.S. strike. Jay Carney, a White House
spokesman, said Russia’s proposal was under review. Congress is
set this week to consider President  Barack Obama ’s call for a
limited attack on Syria.  Waterborne crudes, led by European benchmark Brent,
weakened versus land-locked WTI as concerns of supply
disruptions faded. Brent’s premium to WTI narrowed to $4.20, the
lowest level since Aug. 19.  LLS and other Gulf of Mexico crudes compete with foreign
oils priced against Brent for space in U.S. refineries. Heavy
Louisiana Sweet narrowed by $1.20 to a premium of $2.40 a barrel
versus WTI. Mars Blend weakened by 75 cents to a discount of $2
a barrel.  Poseidon crude’s discount widened by $1.20 to $2.70. Crude
from the Southern Green Canyon lost $2.50 to a $4.50-a-barrel
discount. Thunder Horse crude weakened by $1.10 to 10 cents a
barrel more than WTI.  To contact the reporter on this story:
