Luckily for Broadway, Rosh Hashanah
comes around only once a year.  Ticket sales tanked 10 percent last week to $18.4 million,
reported the Broadway League, which represents producers and
theater owners.  “Annie,” the revival that’s closing on Jan. 5, had its
worst week since previews began in October 2012 -- $596,000.
Likewise, “Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark” ” sold $791,000,
its slowest week since November 2010, when it began its extended
preview period.  The Jewish New Year was particularly punishing to “Soul
Doctor,” about the singing Rabbi Shlomo Carlebach. Sales
tumbled by more than a third, to $111,000.  The only shows that didn’t decline weren’t playing the
previous seven days:  “ Big Fish ,” directed and choreographed by Susan Stroman
(“The Producers”) with music by Andrew Lippa (“The Addams
Family”) had a decent debut, $384,000 in its first four
previews. Tennessee Williams’s “The Glass Menagerie,” with
Cherry Jones and Zachary Quinto (“Star Trek”) sold $319,000 in
six previews.  “Chicago” and “Jersey Boys” (both down 2 percent) were
relative Teflon. “The Book of Mormon” dropped just 3 percent,
with average ticket prices still an intimidating $193.36.  Seats generally may be plentiful this week as well: Yom
Kippur begins Friday evening and ends Saturday evening.  Muse highlights include  Jeremy Gerard  on theater and
 Hephzibah Anderson  on books.  To contact the reporter on this story:
