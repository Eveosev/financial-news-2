Vinda International Holdings Ltd. (3331) 
gained the most in more than six years in Hong Kong trading
after receiving an offer from a unit of  Europe ’s largest paper-tissue maker.  Vinda jumped as much as 38 percent to HK$10.96, headed for
the biggest gain since July 2007, before trading at HK$10.78 as
of the mid-day break in Hong Kong.  Sweden’s  Svenska Cellulosa AB (SCAB) , the maker of Tempo tissues,
is offering to buy all outstanding Vinda stock in cash for HK$11
a share, about 38.4 percent higher than the Chinese company’s
last traded price before the announcement.  SCA, also Europe’s biggest private forest owner, is seeking
acquisitions globally and has as much as 9 billion kronor ($1.4
billion) to spend on purchases, Chief Executive Officer Jan
Johansson said in January. The Stockholm-based company already
owns 21.68 percent of Vinda, it said in a joint  statement  to the
 Hong Kong  stock exchange.  “SCA believes that Vinda is well positioned for growth
within the tissue market in”  China , the company said in a
statement. “Becoming a majority shareholder is also an
important step that will allow SCA to explore potential
opportunities to create value in Vinda by sharing or entering
licensing arrangements with Vinda,” it said.  JPMorgan Chase & Co., the sole financial adviser to SCA on
the deal, has granted the Swedish company a credit facility in
the amount of $1.1 billion, SCA said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
