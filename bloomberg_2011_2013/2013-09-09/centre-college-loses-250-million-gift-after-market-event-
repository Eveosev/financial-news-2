Centre College, a liberal arts
school in rural  Kentucky , said that a $250 million gift to fund
science and education scholarships has been withdrawn because of
a “significant capital market event.”  The gift announced in July was made up of stock in
Universal Computer Systems Holding Inc. from the A. Eugene
Brockman Charitable Trust, according to the college in Danville,
Kentucky. It would have been one of the biggest donations in the
history of U.S. higher education.  “The trust’s intended major gift to fund the program was
linked to a significant capital market event, which put
considerable time pressure on efforts to structure the gift and
the proposed scholarship program,” John Roush, Centre College’s
president, said in a statement. “In the end, the parties
determined that it was not possible to finalize these matters
and get the required approvals from both sides in the time
available.”  Centre, which hosted the 2012 vice presidential debate, had
1,137 students last year and was ranked 52nd among liberal arts
colleges by U.S. News & World Report. It was founded in 1819.
Former students include  John Breckinridge , U.S. vice president
from 1857 to 1861, and Adlai Stevenson, vice president from 1893
to 1897 and grandfather of the 1952 and 1956 presidential
candidate.  Universal Computer Systems is a closely held company that
owns  Reynolds & Reynolds Co. , a Kettering, Ohio-based supplier
of software to auto dealers. Reynolds’s chairman is Robert Brockman, the son of A. Eugene Brockman, and a former Centre
student from 1959 to 1961, the college said in July.  To contact the reporter on this story:
