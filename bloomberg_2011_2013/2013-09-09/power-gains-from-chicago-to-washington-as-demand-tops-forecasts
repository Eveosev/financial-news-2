Spot wholesale electricity on the
13-state grid stretching from Chicago to  Washington  gained as
demand topped forecasts and nuclear generation dropped.  Power consumption on the PJM Interconnection LLC network,
the largest in the U.S. serving more than 60 million people, was
117,789 megawatts at 1:30 p.m., 9.8 percent higher than the day-ahead outlook of 107,231 megawatts for the time, according to
its website.  Exelon Corp. (EXC)  shut reactors in  Pennsylvania  and in  Illinois 
in the past two days and  Dominion Resources (D)  Inc. took a  Virginia 
unit offline on Sept. 7, according to the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission. The combined nameplate capacity of these units and a
Maryland reactor shut last week units is 4.3 gigawatts, or 11
percent of PJM’s nuclear capacity, Energy Information
Administration data show.  “Temperatures rising across the RTO this week, combined
with over four gigawatts of nuclear generation that is out on
maintenance, will bolster energy costs for the PJM footprint,”
said Diana Chiyangwa, a Boston-based power analyst for Genscape
Inc. “Simultaneously, congestion resulting from these outages
will also push up prices.”  Spot prices at PJM’s  Western hub , which includes deliveries
to Washington, almost doubled to average $75.52 a megawatt-hour
during the hour ended at 2 p.m. from the same time on Sept. 6,
grid data compiled by Bloomberg showed.  The high temperature in  Chicago  today may be 89 degrees
Fahrenheit (32 Celsius), 11 above normal, according to
AccuWeather Inc. in State College, Pennsylvania. Washington’s
reading may climb to 80 degrees, 2 lower than average.  Reactors Shut  Exelon shut the Peach Bottom 3 reactor, 47 miles (76
kilometers) southeast of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, and the
Braidwood 1 reactor 54 miles southwest of Chicago for refueling
and maintenance, the company said in statements.  North Anna 1, Dominion’s plant 40 miles northwest of
Richmond, Virginia, began a refueling and maintenance outage on
Sept. 7, said Roger Hannah, a spokesman for the NRC in Atlanta.  Peach Bottom 3 has a nameplate capacity of 1,160 megawatts.
Braidwood can produce 1,225 and North Anna 980.  Spot electricity for New York City gained, reversing
earlier losses, rising $9.27, or 30 percent, to average $39.78 a
megawatt-hour in the hour ended at 2 p.m.  Boston  prices were up
90 cents, or 3 percent, at $31.17.  On-peak power for New York traded at a premium of $6.09
versus Boston from 71 cents on Sept. 6.  To contact the reporter on this story:
