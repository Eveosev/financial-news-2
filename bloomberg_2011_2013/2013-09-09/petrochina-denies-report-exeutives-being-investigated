PetroChina Co. (857) , mired in a
government graft probe, said a media report that more executives
were being investigated by the authorities is untrue.  The report is “inconsistent with the truth” and Sun
Longde and Wang Guoliang are handling their responsibilities as
usual, the company said in an e-mailed statement today.
PetroChina had earlier suspended its shares from trading in  Hong
Kong  and  Shanghai  pending the statement.  Mainland newspaper China Business News reported today that
five executives including managers from PetroChina and its
parent China National Petroleum Corp. had been summoned by the
authorities. They included Sun Longde, a PetroChina vice
president who had replaced another official under investigation,
and Wang Guoliang, CNPC’s chief financial officer.  The report cited an unidentified person close to PetroChina
as saying it wasn’t clear if the executives were being
investigated or were helping with an investigation.  PetroChina’s statement didn’t mention the other three
executives cited in the China Business News report.  PetroChina shares rose 1.3 percent to HK$8.81, compared
with a 0.6 percent gain in the benchmark  Hang Seng Index . The
stock has tumbled 20 percent in Hong Kong this year.  Former Chairman  Jiang Jiemin , who left PetroChina in March,
was removed from his post as head of the state assets regulator
and is under investigation, the official Xinhua News Agency said
Sept. 2. Five days earlier, PetroChina said it removed four
senior managers after authorities started a probe.  To contact the reporter on this story:
