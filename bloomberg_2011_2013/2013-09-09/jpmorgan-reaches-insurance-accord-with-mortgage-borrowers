JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  and insurers
reached a $300 million settlement with property owners who
accused the companies of overcharging for hazard insurance.  JPMorgan,  Assurant Inc. (AIZ)  and other insurers will pay refunds
valued at 12.5 percent of annual premium costs to homeowners who
had the policies placed on their properties by the bank starting
in January 2008, according to documents filed Sept. 6 in federal
court in Miami.  Homeowners covered by the case stand “to recover hundreds,
if not thousands, of dollars as a result of the settlement,”
lawyers for the plaintiffs said in a memorandum.  JPMorgan, based in New York, was accused of placing
mortgage borrowers’ required hazard and wind coverage with
Assurant and other insurers at inflated rates, covering costs of
kickbacks to a JPMorgan unit.  “The settlement will have no expected impact on our
financials,”  Amy Bonitatibus , a JPMorgan spokeswoman, said in
an e-mailed statement. The insurance agreement at issue was
discontinued this year, she said.  Shawn Kahle, a spokeswoman for New York-based Assurant,
didn’t immediately respond to an e-mail seeking comment on the
settlement.  The case is Saccoccio v. JPMorgan Chase Bank NA, 13-cv-21107, U.S. District Court, Southern District of  Florida 
(Miami).  To contact the reporter on this story:
