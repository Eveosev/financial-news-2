Top-seeded Novak Djokovic has won
the second set of the U.S. Open men’s final against second-seeded  Rafael Nadal  to even their match at one set each.  Djokovic, 26, of  Serbia , broke Nadal’s serve twice in a row
and won the second set 6-3. Nadal, 27, from Spain, had won the
first set 6-2 at the National Tennis Center in New York.  Nadal, who is 21-0 on hard courts this season, had lost
only one game on serve in his first six matches of the
tournament.  Djokovic broke Nadal’s serve in the sixth game of the set,
winning the game on a 54-shot rally and pumping his arms above
his head in triumph as he took a 4-2 lead.  That celebration was short-lived, as Nadal broke right back
in the next game. Djokovic responded with another break of
serve, though, and then served out the set.  It is the third time in four years that the two have met in
the final -- Nadal won in 2010 and Djokovic triumphed in 2011.
Last year, with Nadal sidelined by a knee injury, Djokovic lost
to  Andy Murray  in the final.  Djokovic  has reached the final of three major
championships in 2013 for the third consecutive year,
winning his third straight Australian Open at the beginning of
the year.  Nadal and Djokovic are playing for the 37th time, the most
of any men’s rivalry in the professional era of tennis that
began in 1968. They had been tied with  Ivan Lendl  and  John
McEnroe  with 36 meetings. Nadal leads the head-to-head contest
21-15.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
