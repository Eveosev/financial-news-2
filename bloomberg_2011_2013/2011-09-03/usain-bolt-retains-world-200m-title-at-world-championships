Usain Bolt defended his men’s 200-
meter title at the world track and field championships in Daegu,
 South Korea .  Bolt won in 19.40 seconds, the fastest time in the world
this year and third-fastest ever. The Jamaican set the record of
19.19 seconds when he won gold at the 2009 world championships
in Berlin.  “I feel great,” Bolt told reporters. “It is good to run
a good 200 meters. It is my favorite event.”  After being disaqualified for a false start in the 100-
meter final six days ago, Bolt had the slowest reaction time out
of the blocks in the 200. He took the lead coming out of the
final turn and pulled away from Walter Dix of the U.S. and
 France ’s Christophe Lemaitre.  “I wasn’t running angry, I was running hard to say to fans
sorry about the 100 meters,” Bolt said. “I came here to do my
best and to prove to them.”  Dix finished second in 19.70 seconds, with Lemaitre third
in 19.80 seconds.  “It was a good race,” Dix, who finished second to
 Jamaica ’s Yohan Blake in the 100 meters, said in a televised
interview. “Bolt got me at the curve and I wasn’t able to catch
back up.”  The U.S. retained its women’s 4x400-meter relay world title
as Sanya Richards-Ross, Allyson Felix, Jessica Beard and
Francena McCorory won in 3 minutes, 18.09 seconds, the leading
time in the world this year. Jamaica took the silver medal, with
 Russia  capturing the Bronze.  Australia and Russia won two gold medals each on the next-
to-last day of the championships.  High Jump  Russia’s Anna Chicherova defeated two-time defending
champion Blanka Vlasic of  Croatia  in the women’s high jump and
Sergey Bakulin won the men’s 50-kilometer race walk. Chicerhova
and Vlasic both finished with a best of 2.03 meters (6.7 feet),
with Chicerova getting the gold because of fewer misses at the
winning height.  Australia ’s Sally Pearson won the women’s 100-meter hurdles
in a championship record time of 12.28 seconds and countryman
Richard Colman won the men’s 400 meters title.  “I knew I could get out there and do something special,”
Pearson told reporters. “During the race I knew that I was
going very fast. I cannot even imagine what I just achieved.”  Germany ’s Matthiaas de Zordo won the men’s javelin with a
throw of 86.27, Diane Roy of Canada took the gold in the women’s
800 meters, and  Kenya ’s Asbel Kiprop won the men’s 1,500 meters.  To contact the reporter on this story:
