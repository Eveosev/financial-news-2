(Corrects  News Corp. (NWSA)  statement in story that was published
Sept. 3.)  News Corp.’s News International unit
said current executives didn’t approve the use of private
detectives to compile dossiers and conduct surveillance on the
private lives of three lawyers pursuing phone hacking damages
claims in the U.K.  Senior executives at the U.K. newspaper group received the
dossiers from activity sanctioned as recently as six months ago,
the Independent newspaper  said  today, without saying where it
got the information. Lawyer  Mark Lewis  told the newspaper he had
seen a dossier compiled about him.  “While we cannot confirm the accuracy of the Independent
story this morning, current News International executives did
not sanction any activity of this type,” News International
said in an e-mailed statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
