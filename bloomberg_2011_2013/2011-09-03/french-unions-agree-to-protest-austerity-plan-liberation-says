Five French labor unions agreed to
call for a day of protest on Oct. 11 against the government’s
austerity plan,  Liberation  reported, citing a joint statement by
the unions.  Confederation Francaise Democratique du Travail,
Confederation Generale du Travail, Unsa, Federation Syndicale
Unitaire and l’Union Syndicale Solidaires will organize the
protest to influence the government, employers and the
parliamentary debate on proposals to save 12 billion euros ($17
billion), the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
