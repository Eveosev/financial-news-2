Italian Foreign Minister  Franco Frattini  said the  European Central Bank  will continue to buy
Italian and Spanish bonds to try to trim record borrowing costs.  “We’ll be insisting on the European Central Bank to
continue,” Frattini told reporters today in Cernobbio,  Italy .
It’s a “very wise policy to support efforts of states like
Italy and Spain. I exclude the ECB will stop buying” the bonds.  The Italian parliament’s “quick” approval of a government
decree containing measures to balance the budget by 2013 “will
reassure markets,” Frattini said. Italy’s Senate will probably
approve the decree by the end of next week, followed by the
lower house the following week, he said, adding that there is
“no attempt” to scale back budget-cutting goals.  ECB President  Jean-Claude Trichet  said earlier today at the
Cernobbio conference that the Italian government must “fully
implement” the budget measures announced to restore the
country’s creditworthiness. Frattini said a swift approval would
be the best answer to the ECB’s concerns.  To contact the reporters on this story:
