China and  India  helped  Iceland 
following its financial crisis while the U.S. and Europe
abandoned the country, Olafur Ragnar Grimsson, Iceland’s
president, said in an interview with the Financial Times.  Grimsson made the comments as he welcomed a proposed sale
of 300 square kilometers of land to Huang Nubo, a Chinese real
estate entrepreneur, the newspaper said.  Europe’s leaders attacked Iceland during the dispute over
how to refund U.K. and Dutch savers after its banks collapsed
while Asian nations showed a willingness to invest, Grimsson
said, according to the FT.  Grimsson said the U.S. hasn’t shown an interest in the
country since closing an air base near Reykjavik five years ago,
the newspaper reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
