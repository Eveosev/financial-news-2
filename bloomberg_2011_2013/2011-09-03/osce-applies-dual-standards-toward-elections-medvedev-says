The Organization for Security and
Co-operation in Europe, which refused to monitor  Russia ’s
presidential elections in 2008, applies “dual standards” in
its approach, president  Dmitry Medvedev  said today.  “OSCE observers sometimes have a very politicized approach
to the election preparation process and results evaluation,”
Medvedev said in the Tajik capital of Dushanbe. “This approach
is often based on dual standards.”  Russia will hold a parliamentary election this year and
presidential elections in 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
