Denmarkâ€™s opposition bloc beat the
governing Liberal-Conservative coalition and its allies in a
 Voxmeter poll  for newswire Ritzau published today on the website
of  Boersen .  The opposition, led by Social Democrat Helle Thorning-
Schmidt, obtained 54.3 percent voter backing versus 44.6 support
for the ruling coalition, according to the poll.  Prime Minister Lars Loekke Rasmussen on Aug. 26 called an
early election after failing to secure majority backing from
lawmakers for his economic stimulus package. Danes go to the
polls on Sept. 15.  To contact the reporter on this story:
