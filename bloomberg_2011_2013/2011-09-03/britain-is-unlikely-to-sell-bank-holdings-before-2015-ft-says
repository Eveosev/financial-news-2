The U.K. is unlikely to sell its
stakes in  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS)  and  Lloyds Banking
Group Plc (LLOY)  before the next general election in 2015, the
 Financial Times  said, citing bankers it didn’t identify.  The European debt crisis and economic slowdown have eroded
the chances of profiting from the holdings to almost nil as the
banks’ are trading at about half the value of the government’s
66 billion-pound ($107 billion) bailout, the newspaper reported.  A poor outlook for economic growth and heightened
regulation will hurt banks’ profitability over the next few
years, the Financial Times said. Delaying the implementation of
new regulations, as is likely with the Independent Commission on
Banking’s proposal to protect retail units, may inject further
uncertainty into the sale process, the newspaper said.  U.K. Financial Investments Ltd., which manages the
government’s holdings, declined to comment, the FT said. The
Treasury said it does not want to own the holdings permanently
and declined to comment on the timing of a sale, according to
the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
