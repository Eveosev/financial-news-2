Omani authorities foiled a hijack
attempt on a ship flying the Liberian flag, the Oman News Agency
 reported  yesterday, citing an unnamed security official.  The official said the incident occurred on Sept. 1 as the
commercial vessel sailed about 34 nautical miles southwest of
Salalah port and outside the Omani territorial waters, ONA said.
He said an Omani navy ship aided by a surveillance aircraft sped
to the site of the attack, where the “pirates were dealt with
and the course of the ship was secured,” the agency said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
