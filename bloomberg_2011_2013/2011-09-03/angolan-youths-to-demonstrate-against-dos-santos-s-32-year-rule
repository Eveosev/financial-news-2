A group of Angolan youths plans to
demonstrate today to demand an end to President Jose Eduardo  dos Santos ’s 32 years of power in  Africa ’s second-biggest oil-
producing nation.  The group has sent e-mails and text messages to build up
support for their demands, which include a call for the
government to reduce university fees to $150 a month from more
than $250, according an e-mail sent to Bloomberg.  They plan to gather at noon in Independence Square in the
capital Luanda, wearing T-shirts saying “32 is too long,”
Radio Despertar said today, citing organizers Dionisio Casimiro
and Alfredo Mayenda Joao.  The weekly newspaper Novo Jornal reported yesterday that
Dos Santos had picked Manuel Vicente, chairman of state-run oil
company Sonangol, as his successor, citing unidentified
officials of the ruling MPLA party.  To contact the reporter on this story:
