Saudi Arabian shares, led by
petrochemicals and banks, soared the most since March on the
first day of trading after a week-long holiday.  Saudi Basic Industries Corp. (SABIC) , the world’s biggest
petrochemicals maker, and  National Industrialization Co. (NIC) , known
as Tasnee, rallied the most since April while  Banque Saudi
Fransi (BSFR) , the kingdom’s fourth-largest publicly traded lender by
assets, strengthened more than 4 percent.  The 148-member  Tadawul All Share Index (SASEIDX)  added 2.1 percent,
the biggest gain since March 26, to 6,106.93 at the 3:30 p.m.
close in Riyadh. All 15 industry groups rose.  “The market today is playing catch-up after a week’s
closure for Eid in lieu of gains made earlier in both global
equities and oil,” said Fuad Aghabi, a director at Ajeej
Capital in Riyadh, even though “the international equity
markets slumped yesterday on disappointing U.S. monthly non-farm
payroll numbers.”  Oil gained 1.5 percent since the Saudi market closed on
Aug. 24 for the Islamic Eid Al Fitr holiday. Crude for October
delivery settled at $86.45 a barrel on the New York Mercantile
Exchange yesterday. Saudi Arabia holds one-fifth of the world’s
proven oil reserves.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and the  Dow Jones
Industrial Average  rose five days in seven. The  S&P 500  weakened
2.5 percent and the Dow lost 2.2 percent yesterday after a
report showing employment stagnated in August fueled concern the
U.S. economy may slip into a recession.  Sabic rose 2.5 percent, the largest gain since April 20, to
94.25 riyals. Tasnee jumped 6.2 percent, the biggest gain since
April 5, to 37.50 riyals. Banque Saudi gained 4.3 percent, the
largest gain since March 26, to 41.50 riyals. Almost 119 million
shares traded today, compared with a six-month daily average of
200 million shares.  “These gains may be short-lived if global markets continue
with Friday’s draw-downs next week on further weak economic
indicators and/or if the European debt crisis escalates again,”
said Aghabi.  Saudi Arabia ’s stock exchange is the only Gulf Arab bourse
open on Saturdays.  To contact the reporter on this story:
