Canada ’s dollar fell this week from
the highest level in almost a month on concern the global
economy may lapse into another recession, dimming the prospects
for the nation’s exports of raw materials.  The loonie, as the currency is also known, has tumbled 5.1
percent this year, trailing only the greenback as the worst
performer among the 10 developed-nation currencies tracked by
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Currency Indexes. Futures trading
indicated better-than-even odds the Bank of Canada, which meets
on Sept. 7, will cut borrowing costs by year-end.  “In the next few months there’s going to be enough jitters
about global growth that the Canadian dollar is likely to see
some weakness and spend some time weaker than parity against the
 U.S. dollar ,”  Avery Shenfeld , chief economist at Canadian
Imperial Bank of Commerce’s CIBC World Markets unit, said by
phone from Toronto.  The Canadian currency depreciated 0.4 percent to 98.53
cents per U.S. dollar yesterday, from 98.13 cents on Aug. 26. It
rallied three days ago to 97.25 cents, the strongest level since
Aug. 4. One Canadian dollar buys $1.0149.  The currency advanced to a three-year high of 94.07 cents
on July 26 before plunging to below parity Aug. 9. It may slide
to C$1.02 by year-end because of “the deteriorating outlook for
the  U.S. economy ,” said  Lee Hardman , a currency strategist at
Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd., by phone from  London . Bank of
Tokyo had a forecast of 95 cents in August.  ‘Close Links’  “It reflects the close links between the U.S. and Canadian
economy,” Hardman said. Canada sends about three-quarters of
its exports to the U.S., including almost all of its shipments
of crude oil, according to research by Royal Bank of Canada’s
 RBC Capital Markets .  Canada’s economy shrank at a 0.4 percent annualized pace in
the second quarter following a 3.6 percent gain in the first
three months of the year,  Statistics Canada  said Aug. 31. It was
the first quarterly contraction since the recession two years
ago as a strong loonie boosted imports and curbed exports.  The nation added 24,000 jobs in August after an increase of
7,100 in the previous month, according to the median forecast of
20 economists before a report from the agency on Sept. 9. The
 unemployment rate  is expected to hold at 7.2 percent.  The loonie dropped yesterday after a U.S. Labor Department
report showed employment unexpectedly stagnated in August, with
the world’s largest economy adding zero jobs and the
unemployment rate staying at 9.1 percent. The median forecast of
86 economists in a Bloomberg News survey was for 68,000
additional jobs.  ‘Ugly Number’  “It was an ugly number,” said Blake Jespersen, director
of foreign exchange at Bank of Montreal, by phone from Toronto.
“The Canadian dollar is underperforming on the expectation the
U.S. economy is going to continue to slow, and that will have a
ripple effect on Canada’s economy.”  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index dropped 0.2 percent this
week after tumbling 2.5 percent yesterday following the U.S.
payrolls report. The S&P/TSX Composite Index climbed 2.2
percent. Futures on crude oil, Canada’s biggest export,
increased 1.3 percent to $86.45 a barrel this week. The
commodity has dropped 5.4 percent this year.  Benchmark 10-year government bonds rose, pushing the yield
down nine basis points, or 0.09 percentage point, to 2.30
percent. The price of the 3.25 percent securities due in June
2021 increased 83 cents to C$108.24. The yield fell on Aug. 18
to 2.25 percent, the lowest in Bloomberg data beginning in 1989.  Loonie’s Range  The Canadian currency has traded in a range of 97.26 cents
to 99.69 since Aug. 9, when the  Federal Reserve  announced it
would hold its target lending rate at a record low through at
least the middle of 2013.  Odds that the  Bank of Canada  will cut rates at its meeting
on Sept. 7 rose yesterday to almost one in five after the U.S.
employment figures, and to better than 50 percent for the Dec. 6
meeting, according to Bloomberg calculations based on overnight
index swaps.  The central bank has held its target rate for overnight
lending between commercial banks at 1 percent since September
2010 after raising it by a quarter-percentage point at each of
three successive meetings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
