Mexico ’s Finance Minister  Ernesto Cordero  said he will seek to run for president in the 2012
elections, daily  Milenio  reported.  Cordero’s standings in recent surveys won’t discourage him
from competing to represent President Felipe Calderon’s  National
Action Party , known as the  PAN , Milenio cited Cordero as saying.
Cordero is reviewing Mexico’s 2011 economic growth forecast and
will announce the new figures “shortly,” according to Milenio.  To contact the reporter on this story:
