New restrictions on mortgage lending
in the Netherlands will take a toll on the Dutch housing market
next year, the  Volkskrant  reported, citing a study by TU Delft
university.  Measures including limits on maximum  mortgage loans  and
changes in terms for lending under the National Mortgage
Guarantee will reduce the amount that middle-income homebuyers
can borrow by as much as 10 percent, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
