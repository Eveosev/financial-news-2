European Central Bank President
 Jean-Claude Trichet  said the Italian government must “fully
implement” the budget measures announced to restore the
country’s creditworthiness.  “The measures announced by the government on Aug. 5 are
extremely important for rapidly diminishing the public deficit
and for improving the flexibility of the Italian economy,”
Trichet said in a broadcast question to  Italy ’s President
Giorgio Napolitano at a conference in Cernobbio, Italy, today.
“This is absolutely decisive to consolidate and reinforce the
quality and credibility of the Italian strategy and
creditworthiness.”  The government this week modified the austerity plan
adopted in August to drop a key tax increase and limit spending
cuts to regions, in a move that may threaten the goal of
balancing the budget in 2013. Finance Minister  Giulio Tremonti 
said Sept. 1  that the loss of revenue would be made up through
a crackdown on  tax evasion .  The yield on the country’s 10-year bond rose for a 10th day
yesterday, gaining 13 basis points to 5.28 percent, the highest
since Aug. 8 when the ECB began buying Italian bonds to try to
bring down record borrowing costs in return for the adoption of
the austerity package.  Tremonti told  European Union economic affairs commissioner
 Olli Rehn  that Italy’s budget adjustement decree is “solid” and
the target of proceeds from an increased fight against tax
evasion will be “met and largely beaten,’’ according to a
statement by his office late yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
