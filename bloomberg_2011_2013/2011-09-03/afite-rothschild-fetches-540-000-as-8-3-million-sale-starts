A 300-bottle collection of Chateau
Lafite-Rothschild, spanning every year from 1981 to 2005, was
the top lot in a two-day  Hong Kong  auction that raised HK$59.5
million ($7.6 million).  The sale ended last night with 547 lots successful, 96
percent of those offered, according to an e-mailed statement
from London-based auction house Christie’s International. The
auction was once estimated to raise as much as $8.3 million.  The Lafite-Rothschild’s HK$4.2 million ($539,291) price,
including fees, made it the most expensive single lot of wine
auctioned this year. The 25 cases of the Bordeaux first-growth,
said to have been kept in pristine condition, sold to an
absentee bidder, described as a Chinese private buyer, on Sept.
3, without a hand raised in the silent room.  The price was below its presale high estimate of HK$4.5
million as a slump in financial markets made some bidders
hesitant. The region’s stocks have had their biggest monthly
slump since May 2010.  Bidders drank glasses of Moet et Chandon Champagne and had
macaroons from the Mandarin Oriental Hotel as they competed with
others on the telephone and from the Internet for the top items,
such as Petrus 1947 that tallied HK$350,000, meeting its top
estimate. Estimates don’t include commission.  Wine totaling more than $232.4 million has now been sold by
the five largest auction houses so far this year, compared with
their combined sales of $354 million for the whole of 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
