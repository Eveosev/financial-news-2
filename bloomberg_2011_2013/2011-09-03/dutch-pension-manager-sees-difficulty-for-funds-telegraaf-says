Turmoil on financial markets is
making it difficult for pension funds to earn good returns,  De
Telegraaf  said, citing Chief Investment Officer Jac Kragt of
Dutch pension-fund asset manager PGGM.  Pension funds are being hit for the second time in little
more than year by steep market declines, giving them
insufficient time to recover and making their role as long-term
investors more problematic, Kragt was cited by the Dutch daily
as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
