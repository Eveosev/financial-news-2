The Vatican denied impeding
investigations into child abuse by priests in Ireland while
admitting to “grave failures” in the handling of cases.  A report by the Irish government has “brought to light
very serious and disturbing failings in the handling of
accusations of sexual abuse of children and young people by
clerics in the diocese of Cloyne,” the Vatican said today in an
e-mailed statement. “The Holy See wishes to make it quite clear
that it in no way hampered or sought to interfere in any
inquiry.”  The Vatican said it recognized “the seriousness of the
crimes detailed in the report, which should never have happened
within the Church of Jesus Christ.”  Ireland’s government has asked for a quick response from
the Vatican on the church’s handling of allegations against 33
clerics of sexual abuse of children in the Cloyne diocese in
southern Ireland between 1996 and 2009. Irish Prime Minister
 Enda Kenny  said on July 20 that the report published by the
Irish government on July 13 “exposes an attempt by the Holy See
to frustrate” an investigation of sex crimes by priests.  To contact the reporter on this story:
