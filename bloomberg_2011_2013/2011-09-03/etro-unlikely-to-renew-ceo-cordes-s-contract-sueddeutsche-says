Metro AG (MEO)  likely won’t extend the
contract of Chief Executive Officer Eckhard Cordes after he lost
the support of the retailer’s supervisory board,  Sueddeutsche
Zeitung  reported, citing an unidentified board member.  Cordes clashed with Metro’s Chairman Juergen Kluge and
insulted Deputy Chairman Werner Klockhaus after a meeting in
late July, the newspaper said. His contract expires at the end
of October 2012, Sueddeutsche reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
