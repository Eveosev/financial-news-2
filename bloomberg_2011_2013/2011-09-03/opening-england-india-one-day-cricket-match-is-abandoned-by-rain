The opening one-day cricket match
between England and  India  was abandoned by rain at Chester-le-
Street in Durham.  England was 7.2 overs into its innings, chasing a victory
total of 275, when the rain began. Play was then abandoned after
a delay of almost 2 1/2 hours with the match declared a no
result.  Parthiv Patel scored 95 as India was 274-7 in its 50 overs.
Praveen Kumar then took 2-11 for the visitors, dismissing
openers Alastair Cook and Craig Kieswetter, before the rain.
India needed to bowl at least 20 overs for the contest to be an
official game.  The second match in the five-game series will be played
Sept. 6 at the  Rose Bowl  in Hampshire. England has already swept
a four-match Test series and won a Twenty-20 match.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
