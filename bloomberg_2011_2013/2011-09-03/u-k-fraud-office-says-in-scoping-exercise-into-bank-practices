The  Serious Fraud Office  is
conducting a “scoping exercise” into U.K. banks that sold
asset-backed securities, SFO spokeswoman Katie Winstanley said .  “We have no active investigation at the moment,”
Winstanley said by phone today. The fraud office has been
interested “for a while” in the sale of asset-backed
securities, she said.  That included talking to people in London’s financial
district and monitoring litigation in the U.S., Winstanley said.
The duration of interest, and details about the talks couldn’t
be disclosed, she said.  The crime-fighting agency has joined a U.S. inquiry into
banking practices that led to the subprime mortage crisis and
credit crunch, the  Daily Telegraph  reported today, without
saying where it had got the information from.  The office is actively reviewing billions of pounds of
complex mortgage-backed securities, the newspaper added.  For Related News and Information:  To contact the reporter on this story:
