Sovereign-debt difficulties in
 Europe  pose a threat to the euro and financial institutions in
the region, said World Bank President  Robert Zoellick .  “The world economy is entering a new danger zone this
autumn,” Zoellick said in remarks prepared for a speech in
Beijing today. “The financial crisis in Europe has become a
sovereign debt crisis, with serious implications for the
Monetary Union, banks and competitiveness of some countries.”  European sovereign  default risk  rose to a record yesterday
after a report showed employment in the U.S. unexpectedly
stagnated in August, adding to signs the global economic
recovery is weakening. Stocks sank in August, sending the MSCI
All-Country World Index down 7.5 percent for the biggest loss
since May 2010.  “Decisions in Europe, decisions in the United States,
decisions in China -- they affect all of us,” said Zoellick,
who also spoke about  China ’s place in the world economy.
“China’s structural challenges occur in a current international
context of slowing growth and weakening confidence.”  In July, the World Bank labeled China, the world’s second-
largest economy, an “upper middle income” country, alongside
countries like Brazil and Turkey. “In the next 15 to 20 years,
China is well-positioned to join the ranks of the world’s high-
income countries,” Zoellick said.  The high-income echelon consists of countries such as
 Japan , Germany and the U.S., according to World Bank
 classifications .  To contact the reporter on this story:
