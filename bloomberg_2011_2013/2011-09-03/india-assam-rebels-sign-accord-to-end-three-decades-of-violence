The main rebel group in  India ’s
northeastern state of Assam reached an agreement with the
government aimed at ending the region’s three-decade insurgency.  The United Liberation Front of Asom, or ULFA, the central
government and the government of Assam today signed the accord
that calls for a suspension of operations against the rebel
group and for ULFA to end violence, the government said in a
 press release  on its website, confirming an earlier report today
by the  Press Trust of India .  Assam, which shares a border with Bhutan and  Bangladesh , is
home to several groups fighting for independence or autonomy.
The ULFA took up arms arguing local people haven’t benefited
from Assam’s resources, especially its large tea estates and oil
fields.  To contact the reporter on this story:
