The  Boston Red Sox  reached their
700th consecutive regular-season sellout at Fenway Park last
night to extend their Major League Baseball record.  “Reaching 700 consecutive sell-outs is a lesson for us all
to never underestimate what the passion of  Red Sox  Nation can
achieve,” owner John Henry said in a statement before the Red
Sox lost 10-0 to the Texas Rangers.  The previous baseball record of 455 sell-outs was set by
the Cleveland Indians from 1995-2001. The Red Sox streak,
started on May 15, 2003, surpassed the Indians on Sept. 8, 2008,
the team said.  After the loss,  Boston  slipped to second place in the
American League East, a half game behind the  New York Yankees 
who defeated the Toronto Blue Jays 3-2.  “Red Sox Nation gives our players and coaches a distinct
competitive advantage in home games by creating a sell-out
atmosphere unmatched in any other ballpark,” said President and
Chief Executive Officer Larry Lucchino.  The Red Sox fell to 83-54 on the season and 41-28 at home.  The Red Sox are 44 games behind the National Basketball
Association’s Portland Trailblazers whose 744 regular-season
sell-outs from 1977 to 1995 lead all American professional
sports.  To contact the reporter on this story:
