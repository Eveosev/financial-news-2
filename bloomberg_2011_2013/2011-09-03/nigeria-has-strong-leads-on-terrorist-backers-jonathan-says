Nigeria,  Africa ’s most populous
nation, has “strong leads” about the backers of terrorist
attacks after being hit by several bomb blasts, President
 Goodluck Jonathan  said.  “I have directed security operatives to go after them no
matter where they may be hiding,” Jonathan said in a  statement 
published yesterday on the government’s website. Nobody will be
spared in state’s efforts “to expose, contain and defeat this
network of terror and its sponsors.”  A suicide car-bomb attack on a  United Nations  office
complex in Nigeria’s capital, Abuja, on Aug. 26 killed at least
23 people and wounded 71 others. The blast occurred after a
suicide bomber driving a Honda CRV crashed into the reception
area of the building housing 26 UN organizations.  Nigeria ’s State Security Service said on Aug. 31 it had
arrested two suspects that it identified as leaders of the
militant Islamist Boko Haram group, which is responsible for
attacks in northern Nigeria, in connection with the bombing.  Boko Haram, which draws inspiration from Afghanistan’s
Taliban movement, claimed responsibility for the attack, the  BBC 
and the Abuja-based Daily Trust newspaper reported, citing phone
calls by a spokesman.  To contact the reporter on this story:
