Colombia’s guerrilla group
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia planned to extort money
from companies operating in the Andean country, including
 Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)  and  Nike Inc. (NKE) , President Juan Manuel Santos
said.  Colombia’s army captured a member of the group known as
FARC within the past several days. The rebel, known only by the
alias “Brayan,” held extortion letters ready to send to 130
companies, including  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) ,  Almacenes Exito SA (EXITO)  and
unspecified oil companies, Santos said.  “This was an important blow by the army against the
FARC,” Santos said in a  statement  on the presidential website.
“We found 130 letters ready to be distributed.”  When Santos took office in August 2010, he pledged to crack
down on rebel groups as he seeks to draw investment in oil wells
and mining. He said he would expel any companies that deal with
illegal groups. The FARC have stepped up attacks and kidnappings
over the past year as energy investments pour into the country.  To contact the reporter on this story:
