Cia. Brasileira de Distribuicao
Grupo Pao de Acucar Chairman Abilio Diniz resumed efforts to
merge operations with  Carrefour SA (CA)  in  Brazil ,  Veja  magazine
reported in its Radar column, without saying where it got the
information.  Diniz is in talks with a group of three investors the
magazine didnâ€™t identify to raise financing for the proposed
deal, Veja said.  Pao de Acucar abandoned in July a plan to combine
operations with the Brazilian unit of Carrefour after  Casino
Guichard-Perrachon SA (CO) , the French-based retailer that shares
control of Pao de Acucar with Diniz, rejected the offer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
