The College of Law, Britain’s
largest lawyers’ school with annual turnover of 70 million
pounds ($114 million), may be put up for sale after its
governors asked for a review of operations, The Times said.  The institution will probably report back by Christmas,
with the review examining everything including whether it should
be sold, chief executive Nigel Savage was quoted in The Times. A
statement from the college said it was considering the options
because of changes in higher education, according to the
newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
