The  European Central Bank  is partly
responsible for  Italy  rolling back some of its budget cuts after
it lowered interest costs by buying the country’s bonds, Otmar Issing, the ECB’s former chief economist, said in an  interview 
with WirtschaftsWoche.  The bond purchases take pressure off governments to
consolidate finances and raise the expectations of additional
support for debt-strapped countries, the newspaper reported,
citing Issing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
