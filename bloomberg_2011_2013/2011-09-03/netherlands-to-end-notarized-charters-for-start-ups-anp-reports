Dutch entrepreneurs who set up a
limited partnership will no longer need to obtain a notarial
charter in most cases,  ANP reported, citing a government
statement.  The decision will save new businesses an average of 1,000
euros ($1,420), the news service said.  The measure, announced today by Economic Affairs Minister
Maxime Verhagen, together with legislation introduced by the
previous cabinet eliminating an 18,000-euro minimum for start-up
capital, will cut administrative start-up costs by 90 percent,
the Dutch news service said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
