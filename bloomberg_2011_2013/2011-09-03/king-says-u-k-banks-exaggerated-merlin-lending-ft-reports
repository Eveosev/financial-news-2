U.K. banks overstated the amount
they lent under the “Project Merlin” agreement to boost
lending to small and medium-size companies, the Financial Times
said, citing a letter from  Bank of England  Governor  Mervyn King .  The 100.3 billion pounds ($163 billion) in lending reported
by the five biggest U.K. banks in the first half of 2011 is
misleading because it includes all money made available to
businesses whether they drew from the funds or not, King said in
the letter, according to the newspaper.  Net lending after deducting debt repayments continued to
fall, the FT said, citing the letter. The letter was sent to
Chuka Umunna and Chris Leslie, lawmakers from the U.K.’s
opposition  Labour Party , the newspaper said.  A spokeswoman for the Bank of England confirmed King wrote
the letter to the Labour lawmakers. The BOE doesn’t comment on
private correspondence, she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
