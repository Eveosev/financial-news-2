Kesa Electricals Plc (KESA) ’s attempt to
sell its U.K. Comet chain may stall over the amount of working
capital offered to buyers to fund the unprofitable business, the
Financial Times reported.  The capital is needed to appease suppliers and trade-credit
insurers once Comet is separated from its parent, the FT said,
citing unidentified people familiar with the deal. As much as
250 million pounds ($405 million) is needed to fund the
business, the FT said, citing analysts at UBS AG.  Restructuring firm Hilco and OpCapita LLP are preparing
bids, according to the FT. All parties declined to comment, the
newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
