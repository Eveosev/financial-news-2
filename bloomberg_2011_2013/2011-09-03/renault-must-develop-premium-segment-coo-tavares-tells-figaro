Renault SA (RNO)  needs to develop in the
premium-car segment to highlight its capabilities and better use
the auto maker’s Formula 1 successes, Chief Operating Officer
 Carlos Tavares  said in an interview, Le Figaro reported.  The automobile maker wants to raise the resale value of its
cars, which is below that of Volkswagen AG vehicles even though
surveys show their reliability is at least comparable, Tavares
said, according to the newspaper.  The premium segment could include cars that are both sporty
and luxurious, Tavares told Le Figaro. Renault is working on
several models, though a decision hasn’t been made yet, he said,
according to the daily.  To contact the reporter on this story:
