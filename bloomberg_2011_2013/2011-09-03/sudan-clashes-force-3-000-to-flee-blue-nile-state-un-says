Clashes in the  Sudan ’s Blue Nile
state forced as many as 3,000 people to flee to neighboring
Ethiopia, the  United Nations ’ Humanitarian Agency said.  Fighting between the Sudanese army and rebels broke out in
Al-Damazin, the capital of Blue Nile state, and forced people to
flee north, some “leaving the town on foot,” the UN agency
said in a report published on its website late yesterday.  Some UN and international non-governmental organization
employees were evacuated to Kurmuk, a border town, and then
across to Ethiopia, the UN’s Office for the Coordination of
Humanitarian Affairs said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
