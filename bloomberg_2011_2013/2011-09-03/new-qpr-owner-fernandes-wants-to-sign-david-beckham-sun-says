New Queens Park Rangers owner  Tony
Fernandes  wants to sign former England captain  David Beckham ,
the Sun said.  Fernandes wants Beckham to join QPR after the Major League
Soccer season ends in November and feels a move would help the
midfielderâ€™s dream of playing at the 2012 Olympics in London,
the Sun said.  Fernandes knows the 36-year-old, whose contract with the
Los Angeles Galaxy ends after this season, will come at a steep
price, but believes shirt sales and other merchandising will
more than cover the cost of signing him, the Sun said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
