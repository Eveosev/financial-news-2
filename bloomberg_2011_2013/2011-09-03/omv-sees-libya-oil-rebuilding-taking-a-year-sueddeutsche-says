Libya â€™s oil-production facilities
may need a year to recover, Sueddeutsche  reported  citing Gerhard Roiss, head of Austrian oil company  OMV AG. (OMV)   OMV, which received 10 percent of its oil from Libya before
the uprising, expects its contract to remain valid under the new
government, the newspaper said. The supply disruption has so far
cost OMV about 200 million euros ($284 million), Sueddeutsche
reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
