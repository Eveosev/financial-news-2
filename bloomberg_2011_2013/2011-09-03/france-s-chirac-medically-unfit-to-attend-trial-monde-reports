Former French President  Jacques Chirac  is medically unfit to stand trial over allegations of
misappropriation of public funds, Le Monde reported, citing
Olivier Lyon-Caen, head of the neurology unit at La Pitie-
Salpetriere hospital in Paris.  Chirac, who suffers from a neurological condition, is in a
vulnerable condition that doesn’t allow him to respond to
questions, the newspaper said, citing a report by Lyon-Caen sent
to judge Dominique Pauthe.  Chirac, who became president in 1995, faces charges dating
back to when he was mayor of Paris that he used city funds to
reward party loyalists with no-show jobs. The trial is scheduled
to start Sept. 5.  The report, requested by Chirac’s wife Bernadette and his
daughter Claude, was accompanied by a letter from Chirac asking
to be judged like any person subject to trial, Le Monde said.
That leaves the initiative to discuss Chirac’s court appearance
with Pauthe, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
