Michal Kadlec’s late penalty kick
gave the  Czech Republic  a 2-2 tie in Scotland in a qualifying
match for the 2012 European soccer championship.  Kadlec’s score came seven minutes after Scotland took the
lead on a goal from captain  Darren Fletcher . Kenny Miller had
earlier scored the host’s first, and Jaroslav Plasil had the
first Czech goal.  The draw at Hampden Park in Glasgow strengthens the Czechs’
hold on second place in Group I. They have 10 points, five fewer
and European and World Cup champion  Spain  and five more than
third-place Scotland.  The winner in each of the nine groups, along with the
second-place team with the most points, qualify for Euro 2012,
with hosts Poland and Ukraine. The remaining eight second-place
teams will play off for the final four spots.  Kadlec drilled his penalty past goalkeeper Allan McGregor
after referee Kevin Blom ruled Danny Wilson tripped Jan Rezek in
the area.  Scotland  had a penalty call turned down after
Christophe Berra went down in the area, with Blom giving the
defender a yellow card for diving.  Fletcher, playing his first game for Scotland this year
after being sidelined by a virus, put his team in front when he
took a pass from Miller and fired a shot past goalkeeper Jan Lastuvka.  Miller opened the scoring in the final minute of the first
half, before Plasil tied the game for the Czechs with 12 minutes
remaining.  The next round of qualifying matches will be played on
Sept. 6.  To contact the reporter on this story:
