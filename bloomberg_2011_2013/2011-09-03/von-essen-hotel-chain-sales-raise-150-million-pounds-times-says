Nineteen of the 28 properties owned
by the collapsed Von Essen Hotels chain were under offer on a
piecemeal basis to buyers, raising 150 million pounds ($243.3
million), according to  The Times  newspaper.  The package of 27 hotels and an undeveloped fort in
Pembrokeshire had an asking price of 202 million pounds, the
Times said, without saying where it got the information.  Buyers for the 19 properties were a mixture of
“experienced operators and high-net-worth individuals”,
according to The Times, citing agents Christie & Co acting on
behalf of administrator Ernst & Young. The billionaire
Livingstone brothers are buying the two largest properties, the
newspaper said.  Guide prices for nine unsold hotels are being cut from 53
million pounds to 35 million pounds, the Times said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
