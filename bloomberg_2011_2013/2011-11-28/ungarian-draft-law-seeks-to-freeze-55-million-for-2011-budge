Hungary’s government asked
Parliament to freeze 12.7 billion forint ($55 million) in
spending this year, according to a bill submitted by Economy
Minister  Gyorgy Matolcsy .  The government has already set aside 40 billion forint that
won’t be spent in order to meet budget goals, according to
Matolcsy’s bill, which was submitted Nov. 25 and is  posted  on
Parliament’s website.  Hungary’s  budget deficit  in the first 10 months reached
193.2 percent of a full-year target, the Economy Ministry said
on Nov. 7. The government, which officially targeted a deficit
of 2.94 percent of gross domestic product this year, forecasts a
surplus after effectively nationalizing private pension funds
and levying extraordinary taxes on energy, financial, retail and
telecommunication companies.  Ministries and other institutions controlled by the
government must make 577 billion forint in savings by the end of
the year to ensure that the budget  deficit  is kept in check,
Tibor Haag of the  Economy Ministry  told a parliamentary
committee on Oct. 3.  To contact the reporter on this story:
