  Spain ’s industry ministry has sent
a proposal to the country’s energy commission suggesting that
 Gas Natural SDG SA (GAS)  be compensated for legal costs related to a
dispute with Sonatrach,  Cinco Dias  said, citing a draft of the
proposal.  The ministry has proposed allowing 157.3 million euros
($209 million) in rate charges over five years to cover the cost
of the Gas Natural Sonatrach arbitration that would raise the
amount charged by one percent, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
