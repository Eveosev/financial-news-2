Estonian banks should continue
raising loan margins as lenders have yet to pass on the full
cost of higher borrowing costs,  Postimees  reported, citing Riho
Unt, the head of the local unit of  SEB AB. (SEBA)   Average loan margin for individuals and companies has risen
0.6 percentage points compared with a year earlier, Postimees
said. Bank borrowing costs have increased by more than one
percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
