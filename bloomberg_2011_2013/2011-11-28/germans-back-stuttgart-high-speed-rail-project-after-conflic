German voters in Baden-Wuerttemberg
backed a high-speed rail hub project in a referendum, ending a
conflict that helped oust  Chancellor Angela Merkel ’s party from
the state’s leadership after almost six decades in power.  A total of 58.8 percent backed state financing for the
project being built by  Deutsche Bahn  AG in Stuttgart, with 41.2
percent calling for funding to be cut, according to a Baden-
Wuerttemberg government  statement .  “We respect this referendum,” Winfried Hermann, transport
minister of the southwestern state, told ARD television today.
“I expect Deutsche Bahn to go through with the project.”  The state’s Greens Prime Minister, Winfried Kretschmann,
drew support in Baden-Wuerttemberg after tapping into public
opposition to the rail project known as “Stuttgart 21.” The
Greens election victory in March ended the 58-year rule of
Merkel’s  Christian Democratic Union  and gave the environmental
party sway over policy in a state home to companies including
Daimler AG, Porsche SE and SAP AG.  Stuttgart 21 involves rebuilding the city’s main train
station underground for at least 4.5 billion euros ($6 billion)
to turn it into a European rail hub. Critics have attacked the
project as too expensive, with thousands of demonstrators
staging sit-ins in Stuttgart’s city center over the past year.
More than 100 people were injured in a clash with police in
September 2010.  Critics of Stuttgart 21 say protests against the project
will continue.  To contact the reporter on this story:
