China ’s deficit in its services
trade widened in the first nine months of the year, Zhou Liujun,
head of the  Ministry of Commerce ’s services trade bureau, said.  Imports of services, including tourism and financial
services, climbed 26.5 percent in the first three quarters of
2011 from a year earlier to $174 billion, while exports rose 10
percent to $134 billion, Zhou said at a briefing in Beijing
today. That would leave a deficit of $40 billion, according to
calculations based on the data. Zhou didn’t give comparative
figures for the deficit beyond saying that it had widened.  China’s trade in services will likely grow 13 percent for
the full year to $410 billion, down from an 18.7 percent pace in
the first nine months, Zhou said, without giving more details.
The increase will lag behind that of the nation’s goods trade.
The customs bureau last month estimated 2011 exports will rise
18 percent and imports will climb 21 percent.  China’s deficit in transport in the first nine months was
$32.9 billion while the gap in tourism was $19.3 billion,
according to commerce ministry data released today.  The government aims to raise the value of its services trade
to $600 billion by 2015 from $362 billion last year, the
ministry said.  --Zheng Lifei. Editors: Nerys Avery,  John Liu   To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
