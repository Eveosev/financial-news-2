The  Bank of Japan  posted a loss of
91 billion yen ($1.2 billion) in the six months ended Sept. 30,
according to a  statement  released in Tokyo today.  The loss was smaller than the 158.8 billion yen booked the
same six-month period a year earlier, the statement said. Assets
rose to 138 trillion yen.  The BOJ expanded the total size of its credit and asset-
buying programs in March, August and October to 55 trillion yen.
The fund is its main policy tool since lowering the key interest
rate close to zero.  The BOJâ€™s capital ratio was 7.23 percent, the lowest since
the second half of fiscal 1979, when it was 6.3 percent. It was
7.36 percent as of March 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
