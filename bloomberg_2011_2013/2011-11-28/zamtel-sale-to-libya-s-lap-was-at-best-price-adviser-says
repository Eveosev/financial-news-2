The company that advised Zambia’s
government on the sale of 75 percent of Zambia Telecommunication
Co. said LAP Green Network of  Libya  made all payments needed
when it bought stake in the company last year.  LAP Green paid $257 million and assumed more than $70
million of guarantees to Zamtel’s suppliers, London-based RP
Capital Advisors Ltd. said in an e-mailed statement yesterday.  “The price achieved for a controlling stake in the company
was one of the very best among privatizations of
telecommunication assets on the African continent,” it said.  Zambian Justice Minister Sebastian Zulu, who led an
investigation into the transaction, on Nov. 24 said the sale of
the stake was “a fraud,” adding the previous government acted
with “extreme haste and did not follow normal tender procedures
and renders the transaction illegal. LAP Green bought a 75
percent stake in Zamtel in June last year.  President  Michael Sata , who has embarked on an anti-
corruption campaign, said on Nov. 17 he would reverse the sale
if Cabinet recommended this.  Lap Green has invested $170 million in its network in the
southern African nation, it said in a statement published in
Zambia  Daily Mail  today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
