A protester was killed in Ukraine
yesterday evening after police seized a tent belonging to hunger
strikers in Donetsk,  Ukrainska Pravda  reported, citing Mykhaylo
Volynets, a lawmaker from the Yulia Tymoshenko bloc in
parliament.  Physically handicapped Henadiy Konoplyov, a 70-year old
retired miner, was inside the tent when it was wrecked by
police. Konoplyov had been taking part in the hunger strike for
about a week, protesting against cuts in state benefit payments
for those involved in the Chernobyl cleanup, Pravda reported.  Protesters set up camps in the city of Donetsk in the east
of Ukraine and over forty activists went on hunger strike from
Nov. 14, according to Pravda.  To contact the reporter on this story:
