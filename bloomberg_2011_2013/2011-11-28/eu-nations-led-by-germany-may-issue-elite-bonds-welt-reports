Germany,  France  and four other AAA-
rated EU members may issue common bonds to help indebted euro
region members, Die Welt reported, citing unidentified EU
diplomats.  Finland, Holland, Luxembourg and Austria are part of the
plan aimed at stabilizing the AAA-rated countries and creating a
firewall to calm financial markets, the newspaper said.  The U.K. is involved in the talks over the so-called
“elite bonds” that would have an interest rate of 2 percent to
2.5 percent, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
