Centum Investment Co. (CENTUM) ,  East Africa ’s
biggest publicly traded investment company, snapped seven days
of declines after a slowdown in the sale of bonus shares the
company awarded investors.  The shares jumped as much as 2.6 percent to 14 shillings
before trading 0.4 percent higher at 13.7 shillings as of 1:03
p.m. in the capital, Nairobi.  “The downfall was temporary because it was an initial sell
off that comes when companies give bonus shares and everyone was
selling their bonus shares,” George Bodo, an equity strategist
at Nairobi-based Apex Africa Capital Ltd, said by phone today.  Centum offered one bonus share for every 10 held, resulting
in the issue of an additional 60.5 million shares to
stockholders.  To contact the reporter on this story:
