Ford Motor Co. (F)  may be fined about 14
million euros ($19 million) by the Romanian authorities for
failing to meet a car-production pledge at its southern Craiova-
based factory, after receiving state-aid from the government,
Ziarul  Financiar  reported, citing Finance Minister officials.  Ford was supposed to manufacture about 250,000 cars at its
Romanian factory this year, Ziarul Financiar said, citing a
contract between the Romanian government and the Dearborn,
Michigan-based company. It has so far produced about 7,600 cars,
according to the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
