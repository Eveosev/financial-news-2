Thailand ’s baht advanced the most in
three weeks on optimism policy makers in  Europe  will act to
contain the region’s debt crisis.  German Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  called for fast-
track treaty changes to tighten budget discipline to calm
markets. The MSCI Asia-Pacific Index of shares climbed after
retail sales in the U.S. over the Thanksgiving weekend surged 16
percent to a record. The baht touched the weakest level in 15
months earlier as a report today showed factory  output  fell by
the most in more than a decade last month as the nation’s worst
floods in almost 70 years swamped factories.  “Risk sentiment is temporarily improving,” said Tohru Nishihama, an economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute Inc.
in  Tokyo . “The bad economic data for Thailand due to the floods
has already been priced in.”  The baht advanced 0.3 percent, the most since Nov. 4, to
31.32 per dollar as of 3:22 p.m. in Bangkok, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. It touched 31.45 earlier, the weakest
level since August 2010. The currency may trade between 31 and
32 this week, Nishihama said.  The industrial production index slumped 35.8 percent in
October from a year earlier, after dropping a revised 0.33
percent the previous month, the Office of Industrial Economics
said in a statement today.  The yield on the government’s 3.25 percent bonds due June
2017 fell two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 3.32
percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
