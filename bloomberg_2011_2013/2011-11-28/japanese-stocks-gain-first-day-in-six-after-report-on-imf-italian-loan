Japanese  stocks  gained, sending the
 Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average to its first advance in six days, after
Black Friday sales in the U.S. rose to a record and oil prices
advanced.  Sony Corp. (6758) , Japan’s No. 1 exporter of consumer electronics,
rose 2.3 percent.  Kyocera Corp. , which gets almost 20 percent of
its sales in Europe, gained 3 percent after Germany’s finance
minister urged fast-track treaty changes to tighten budget
discipline.  Inpex Corp. (1605) , Japan’s top oil explorer by market
value, rose 3.8 percent after crude prices increased. Mitsui

close in Tokyo. The broader Topix rose 1.3 percent to 715.70,
with more than 2.5 times as many shares advancing as falling.
The  Topix  has tumbled 6.3 percent this month, erasing October’s
gains, as signs emerged that Europe’s debt crisis is spreading
to major economies.  The Black Friday sales proved the U.S. is “in a mild
recovery, and consumer purchasing power isn’t something to be
pessimistic about,” helping exporters in  Asia , said Naoki Fujiwara, who helps oversee $6 billion at Shinkin Asset
Management Co. in Tokyo. “The yen’s strength is taking a pause,
boosting exporter  stocks (TPX)  and fueling confidence.”  U.S. Black Friday sales increased 6.6 percent to a record
$11.4 billion, while foot traffic rose 5.1 percent, ShopperTrak,
a Chicago-based research firm, said in a statement on Nov. 26.  Sony, Toyota  Sony rose 2.3 percent to 1,363 yen. Toyota Motor Corp.,
Asia’s biggest carmaker, climbed 2.9 percent to 2,483 yen.

citing unidentified people close to the negotiations, that it’s
in talks with Bayerische Motoren Werke AG over sharing engines.  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPXL1)  rose 2 percent
today, indicating the gauge will end a seven-day losing streak,
after German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble called for 
treaty changes aimed at tightening budget discipline in an
interview with ARD television in Berlin yesterday.  Also, Italian Prime Minister  Mario Monti  will propose
billions of euros in new austerity measures next week, the  Wall
Street Journal  reported on its website yesterday, citing a
person it said was familiar with the matter.  The euro rose to as high as 103.51 yen today, compared with
103.04 at the close of stock trading on Nov. 25, boosting
overseas income at Japanese companies when repatriated.  Kyocera , an electronics maker,　climbed 3 percent to 6,600
yen. Ricoh Co., an office-equipment maker that gets more than 20
percent of its revenue in  Europe , rose 2.3 percent to 667 yen.  Crude Oil  Oil companies  gained after crude oil climbed for a second
day in  New York .  Inpex rose 3.8 percent to 497,500 yen and its closest rival,
Japan Petroleum Exploration Co., the nation’s second-largest oil
explorer by market value, gained 4 percent to 3,120 yen.  Shipping lines gained the most in the Topix among its 33
industry groups, after the sector had the largest one-month drop
in the gauge. Mitsui O.S.K., which has declined by a quarter
since Oct. 28, soared 6.2 percent to 240 yen. Kawasaki Kisen
Kaisha Ltd., which sank by a quarter this month through Nov. 25,
jumped 5.7 percent to 130 yen.  “Investors are buying back shares in the industries that
had a big plunge,” said Takero Inaizumi, head of equity
research in  Tokyo  at Mizuho Investors Securities Co.  Among companies that gained,  Mitsumi Electric Co.  rose 7.8
percent to 509 yen, the second-sharpest increase in the Nikkei
225. Nomura Holdings Inc. said the next-generation game console
business may contribute to Mitsumi’s earnings from the second-
half of next fiscal year, helping the electric-parts maker to
turn a profit in the year ending March 2014.  To contact the reporters on this story:
