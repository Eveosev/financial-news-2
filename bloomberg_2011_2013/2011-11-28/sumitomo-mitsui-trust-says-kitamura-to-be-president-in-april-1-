Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Holdings Inc.,
created from the merger of  Sumitomo Trust & Banking Co. (8403)  and  Chuo
Mitsui Trust Holdings Inc. (8309)  in April, said it named Vice
President Kunitaro Kitamura, 59, as president, replacing Kazuo Tanabe, 66, who will become an adviser.  Hitoshi Tsunekage, 57, will be president for the holding
company’s trust bank unit when the merger is completed next
April, the bank said in a Tokyo Stock Exchange statement today.  The new lender at the time of the agreement said it aims to
almost double net income in five years compared with the two
banks’ combined projections via cost cuts and integration
savings totaling about 56 billion yen ($721 million) annually.
The merger was the biggest among Japanese banks since the
creation of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. in 2005.  To contact the reporter on this story:
