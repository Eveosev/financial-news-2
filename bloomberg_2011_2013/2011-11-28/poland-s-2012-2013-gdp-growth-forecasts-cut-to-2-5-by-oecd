Poland’s  economic growth  will
probably slow “noticeably” in the next two years on austerity
measures and the euro area’s debt crisis, the Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development said.  Gross domestic product will grow 2.5 percent in 2012 and
2013, compared with 4.2 percent this year, according to the
Paris-based  OECD ’s economic outlook, published today. The 2011
estimate is up from a previous forecast in May of 3.9 percent,
while the projection for the following two years was cut from
3.8 percent.  “GDP growth is projected to slow noticeably in 2012 and
2013” due to “fiscal consolidation and sluggish external
demand, which will in turn weaken private consumption and public
and private investment,” the OECD said in the report, adding
that “weakness in domestic demand is projected to be partly
offset by stronger net exports triggered by significant zloty
depreciation in 2011 and the 2012 football championships.”  Poland’s economy is slowing as demand from neighboring
 Germany , the country’s biggest trading partner, wanes amid the
euro area’s sovereign-debt crisis. Slower growth may derail
government’s plans to shape up public finances.  Prime Minister Donald Tusk vowed to trim  public debt  to 52
percent of GDP next year and to 47 percent in 2015 from this
year’s estimated 52.8 percent, as the  budget gap  narrows to at
least 3 percent of GDP in 2012 and 1 percent in 2015, from an
expected 5.8 percent this year.  “The consolidation measures announced thus far are not
sufficient to achieve these targets, especially given the
government’s optimistic underlying growth projections,” said
OECD. “Additional measures must be announced quickly and
clearly communicated to strengthen credibility.”  The OECD said the  inflation rate  will fall to 2.3 percent
next year, below the central bank’s 2.5 percent target.  “A significant deterioration in economic conditions could
be met by interest-rate cuts, provided that the zloty does not
deteriorate substantially,” it added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
