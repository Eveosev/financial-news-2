UniCredit SpA (UCG) , the Italian bank that
shares ownership of Turkey’s  Yapi & Kredi Bankasi AS (YKBNK)  with  Koc
Holding AS (KCHOL) , doesn’t intend to sell its stake or pull out of
Turkey, Anatolia News Agency reported, citing Chief Executive
Officer Federico Ghizzoni.  UniCredit plans to continue to invest in Turkey, Ghizzoni
also told the state-run news service.  Decisions by Turkey’s central bank and government on
managing growth are generally positive even though they may have
a negative effect on banking profits in the short term, Ghizzoni
also told the newspaper. He added that Yapi Kredi provides about
10 percent of UniCredit’s revenue, Anatolia reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
