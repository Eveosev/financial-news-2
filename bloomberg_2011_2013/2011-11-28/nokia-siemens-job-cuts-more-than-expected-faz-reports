Job cuts at Nokia Siemens Networks,
the unprofitable telephone-equipment venture of  Nokia Oyj (NOK1V)  and
 Siemens AG,  will amount to a higher number than assumed so far,
 Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung  reported.  The venture will cut 17,000 jobs worldwide, the newspaper
said, citing comments made by Chief Executive Officer Rajeev Suri at a workers’ meeting in Munich recently.  Additional jobs will be lost as Nokia Siemens sells assets
that are peripheral to the new strategy announced on Nov. 23,
the newspaper cited Suri as saying.  The company’s comments about the 17,000 job cuts from Nov.
23 had been seen as including losses from potential asset sales,
the newspaper said. Nokia Siemens employed almost 75,000 people
as of Sept. 30.  To contact the reporter on this story:
