Growth in loans to households and
companies in the 17-nation euro area accelerated in October, the
 European Central Bank  said.  Loans to the private sector grew 2.7 percent from a year
earlier after gaining an annual 2.5 percent in September, the
central bank said today. The rate of growth in  M3 money supply ,
which the Frankfurt-based ECB uses as a gauge of future
inflation, fell to 2.6 percent from 3 percent in the previous
month.  The ECB unexpectedly cut its benchmark  interest rate  by a
quarter point to 1.25 percent this month to support an economy
it sees heading for a “mild recession” amid the worsening
sovereign debt crisis. The turmoil is roiling markets, making
banks wary of lending, curbing consumer appetite for credit and
damping company investment.  “Loan growth is still a more important piece of data for
policy makers than the M3 figure because it more accurately
signals where the economy is going and whether there are
inflation or deflation pressures,” said  Christian Schulz , a
former ECB economist now working for Berenberg Bank in  London .
“Depending on how bad the ECB’s new set of economic and
inflation forecasts is in December, we may see another rate cut
as soon as next month.”  M3 grew 2.8 percent in the three months through October
from the same period a year earlier, the ECB said. M3 is the
broadest gauge of  money supply  and includes cash in circulation,
some forms of savings and money-market holdings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
