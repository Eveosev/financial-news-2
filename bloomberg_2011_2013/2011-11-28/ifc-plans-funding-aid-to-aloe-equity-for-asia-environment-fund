The World Bank’s International
Finance Corp. unit is planning to provide at least $25 million
to a fund managed by Aloe Private Equity that will target clean
energy and environmental investments in  Asia .  Aloe, which backed renewable energy developer  Greenko Group
Plc (GKO) , is seeking to raise as much as 300 million euros for its
10-year fund, according to a summary of IFC’s proposed
investment on the lender’s  website .  IFC will invest the lesser of $25 million or 20 percent of
total commitments, it said.  Aloe expects the fund to invest in eight to 10 companies in
fields such as waste management, recycling, water and  energy
efficiency  that want to expand into Asia, Vivek Tandon, co-
founder and general partner of the Mauritius-based company, said
in a May interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
