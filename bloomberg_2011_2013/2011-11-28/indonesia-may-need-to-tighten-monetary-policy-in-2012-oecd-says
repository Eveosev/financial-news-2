Indonesia  may need to tighten
 monetary policy  in 2012 as higher fuel prices boost inflationary
pressure and domestic demand helps  Southeast Asia ’s largest
economy weather a slowdown in global trade, the OECD said.  The nation’s consumer prices will accelerate 5.9 percent in
2012 from an estimated 5.6 percent this year, The Organization
for Economic Cooperation and Development forecast in its global
economic outlook report, released today.  Gross domestic product 
will grow 6.1 percent, less than this year’s forecast of 6.3
percent, the report said.  “Monetary policy will need to tighten in 2012, unless
Indonesia is hit by unforeseen adverse events,” the OECD said.
“Inflation could exceed the target range in 2012 owing to
temporary effects from energy-subsidy reductions, but should
fall back inside the range in 2013.”  Bank Indonesia  unexpectedly lowered its  reference rate  by
half a percentage point this month to a record-low 6 percent to
shield the economy from a faltering global recovery. The country
has fared better than neighbors including Thailand,  Malaysia  and
 Singapore , which slid into recession in 2009, because it’s less
reliant on exports.  “The economy’s orientation towards domestic demand and
strong consumption and investment growth shields it from
weaknesses abroad,” the OECD said in the report. “Economic
growth is thus expected to exceed potential rates in the next
two years despite the slowdown in the OECD area.”  The  central bank  forecasts 2012 inflation of between 3.5
percent and 5.5 percent, compared with this year’s estimated 4
percent to 6 percent, it said in a statement Nov. 10. The
economy may expand 6.5 percent this year and next year, it said.  The Indonesian rupiah fell 0.4 percent last week, compared
with a drop of 1.3 percent in  Thailand ’s baht and a 1.2 percent
decline in Malaysia’s ringgit, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The currency slid 0.7 percent to 9,115 rupiah per dollar
as of 4 p.m. in Jakarta after falling as much as 1.8 percent
earlier, according to prices from local banks compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
