Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) ’s Kenyan unit
said it expects to see its share of the East African country’s
vehicle market rising to 27 percent next year from 26 percent
this year.  The company will start manufacturing it Hilux and Hino
models in  Kenya  in 2012, unit Managing Director Hylton Bannon
told reporters in Nairobi today.  “By bringing production facilities to Kenya, we will lower
our costs and it will enable us to be a lot more competitive,”
Bannon said.  Toyota has put up a $2 million outlet in the Nairobi suburb
of Westlands and plans to open another one in the Gigiri area of
the city at the same cost next year, to improve customer
service, he said. The unit’s vehicle sales this year are
forecast at 11,500 to 12,000, Bannon said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
