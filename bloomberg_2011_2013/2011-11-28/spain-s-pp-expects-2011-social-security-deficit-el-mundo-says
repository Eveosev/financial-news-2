Spain ’s  People’s Party  expects a
consolidated social-security deficit of at least 0.1 percent of
gross domestic product this year, compared with government
estimates of a 0.4 percent surplus,  El Mundo  reported.  A cushion of 0.9 percent of GDP that comes from items
including a radio spectrum auction will help to cover the
forecast social-security shortfall, the newspaper said, citing
calculations based on reports passed to the PP by the
government. Regions and town halls will find it hard to meet
their targets of limiting their deficits to 1.3 percent and 0.3
percent of GDP respectively, El Mundo said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
