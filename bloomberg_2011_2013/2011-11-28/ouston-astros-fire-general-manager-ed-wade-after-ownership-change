in baseball operations,” Astros chief executive George Postolos
said in a statement on the team’s  website .  The Astros finished with a 56-106 record last season, the
worst in  Major League Baseball . Houston had a winning record
once in Wade’s five-year tenure as general manager.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
