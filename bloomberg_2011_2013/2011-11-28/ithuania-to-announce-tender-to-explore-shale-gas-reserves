Lithuania will invite companies to
explore the country’s shale gas reserves in the first quarter
next year, the government said.  The tender will be announced by the country’s Geological
Survey, Deividas Matulionis, head of the prime minister’s
office, said in a press conference in Vilnius today. After
investigations are complete, companies will be allowed to
produce the shale gas, he said.  Lithuanian reserves of shale gas, located in the southwest
of the country, may cover the nation’s domestic consumption
needs for between 30 to 60 years, Energy Minister Arvydas Sekmokas said in May, citing estimates by the U.S. Energy
Information Administration.  To contact the reporter on this story:
