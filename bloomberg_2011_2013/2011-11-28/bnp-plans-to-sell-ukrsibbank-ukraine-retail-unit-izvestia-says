BNP Paribas (BNP) , which owns almost 85
percent of  AKIB UkrSibbank ,  plans to sell the retail business
of the Ukrainian lender and most of its units,  Ekonomicheskie
Izvestia  reported, citing an unidentified person in the
financial market with the knowledge of the matter.  BNP Paribas wants to minimize risk because the biggest
share of UkrSibbankâ€™s loans to individuals are in dollars, the
newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
