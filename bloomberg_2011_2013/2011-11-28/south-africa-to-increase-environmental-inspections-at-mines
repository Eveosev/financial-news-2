South Africa ’s Department of Mineral
Resources will increase inspections and may cancel the mining
rights of companies that fail to comply with their approved
environmental management plans, Minister Susan Shabangu said.  The department is busy amending mining legislation to
“strengthen and streamline” matters relating to these plans,
Shabangu said in a written reply to lawmakers in  Cape Town  dated
Nov. 15 and e-mailed today.  “The steps to be taken may include suspension of non-
compliant operations, including cancellation of rights of such
companies,” she said in the reply. “Capacity is being expanded
to ensure appropriate response in this regard.”  The department will also start to publish actions taken
against non-compliant mining companies in its annual report, she
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
