Slovenian opposition leader  Janez Jansa ’s party would take the most votes in this week’s early
elections after Premier Borut Pahor was toppled because of
disagreements over changing the pension system.  The Slovenian Democratic Party boosted its lead to 35.5
percent from 25 percent two weeks ago, according to a Nov. 22-24
Delo Stik poll released on Nov. 26 by the  Delo newspaper .
Ljubljana Mayor Zoran Jankovic’s party would come in second with
22.7 percent and Pahor’s Social Democrats would take 10.6
percent. The survey of 1,018 people had no margin of error.  Slovenia’s next government will need to tackle the euro
region’s worsening fiscal position that has pushed its borrowing
costs to a record high as the debt crisis in  Europe  intensifies.  The export-driven economy may also slide into recession as
the savings measure by European governments cut demand and the
debt crisis impacts confidence among consumers and companies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
