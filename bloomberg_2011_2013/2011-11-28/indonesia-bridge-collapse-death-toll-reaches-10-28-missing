The death toll from a bridge
collapse in central  Indonesia ’s East Kalimantan province rose to
10 as rescuers searched for 28 others still missing, the
National Agency for Disaster Management said.  The 710-meter (2,330 feet) bridge spanning the Mahakam
River collapsed Nov. 26 at 4:20 p.m. local time, sending cars
and other vehicles into the muddy, 40-meter-deep water below,
Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, head of the disaster agency’s data and
information center, said by mobile-phone text message. The
incident left 39 others injured, he said.  A support cable broke as workers were performing
maintenance on the 10-year-old bridge, and others snapped soon
after, Nugroho said. The Agency for the Assessment and
Application of Technology is investigating the cause of the
collapse, he said.  The Public Works Ministry and East Kalimantan’s government
are working with the disaster agency to build an emergency port
near the bridge to accommodate ferry operations, Nugroho said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
