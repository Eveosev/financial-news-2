Kenya ’s shilling weakened against
the dollar for the first session in three as demand by importers
for the U.S. currency increased for end-of-month bill payments.  The currency of East  Africa ’s biggest economy declined 1
percent to 91.20 per dollar by 11:25 a.m. in Nairobi, heading
for its biggest loss since Oct. 11, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  “There’s some end of month demand for the dollar by the
energy sector players and telecommunications as they have
shipments falling due,” Duncan Kinuthia, head of trading for
Commercial Bank of Africa, said by phone from Nairobi today.  Uganda ’s shilling climbed for the first day in five, adding
0.6 percent to 2,583.40 per dollar, while the Tanzanian currency
lost 0.1 percent of its value against the dollar to 1,692.  To contact the reporter on this story:
