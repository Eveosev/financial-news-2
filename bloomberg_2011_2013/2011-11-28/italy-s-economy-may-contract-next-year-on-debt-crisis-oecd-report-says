Italy’s economy may contract next
year and further deficit-reduction measures will be required as
 Europe ’s debt crisis damps confidence and complicates financing,
the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development said.  Italy’s economy will expand 0.7 percent this year before
shrinking 0.5 percent in 2012, the OECD said in its semi-annual
economic outlook. That compares with growth of 1.1 percent this
year and 1.6 percent in 2012 predicted by the OECD in its
previous forecast in May.  Italy faces “deteriorating confidence, weak export-market
growth and difficult financial conditions,” the Paris-based
OECD said today. “Further measures will be required to keep the
fiscal adjustment program on track.”  The OECD called for “decisive action” by Prime Minister
 Mario Monti ’s new government to make good on pledges to balance
the budget in 2013 and carry out a “severe” economic overhaul
that “may have stronger contractionary effects than projected”
by the 34-nation economic body.  Among “desirable” economic changes, the OECD cited
structural reforms that Italy has promised to the European Union
including easing labor-market rules, loosening regulation,
reducing entry barriers in professions and services, and selling
off state assets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
