Chugoku Electric Power Co., Electric
Power Development Co. and the Japanese government will jointly
develop a coal-fired power plant that uses less polluting
generation technology, the Nikkei newspaper  said .  The two utilities will jointly start building a 170-
megawatt prototype plant that uses fuel-cell technology in the
year ending March 2013, the Nikkei reported, without saying how
it got the information. The Ministry of Economy, Trade and
Industry will cover one-third of the costs, which may exceed 100
billion yen ($1.3 billion), according to the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
