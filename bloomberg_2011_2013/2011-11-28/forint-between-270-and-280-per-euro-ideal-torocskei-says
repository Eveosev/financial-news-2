Hungary keeping the forint between
270 forint and 280 forint per euro would be “ideal,” Debt
Management Agency Chief Executive Officer Istvan Torocskei told
Magyar Nemzet.  The currency trading above 300 per euro “seems a bit

interview published today in the newspaper today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
