Spain ’s economy, the euro area’s
fourth largest, will expand next year at less than a fifth of
the pace forecast in May as the region’s debt crisis
intensifies, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development said.  Gross domestic product will rise 0.3 percent in 2012,
compared with a previous estimate of 1.6 percent, the OECD said
in a report today. The organization cut its 2011 prediction to
0.7 percent from 0.9 percent and sees the economy shrinking in
the current quarter.  Unemployment  will rise to 22.9 percent next
year.  “Subdued export prospects and tight lending conditions are
projected to keep economic growth low in 2012,” the report
said. “A further increase in the yields on Spanish  government
bonds  would raise private-sector funding costs and prolong the
housing crisis.”  Spain’s  borrowing costs  are surging even after the  People’s
Party  beat the ruling Socialists in an election on Nov. 20,
pledging to erase the euro area’s  third-largest deficit . Spain
paid more than  Greece  and  Portugal  to sell three-month bills on
Nov. 22 and the gap between Spain’s two- and 10-year securities
has more than halved in a month, echoing shifts that presaged
bailouts in Greece and Portugal and suggesting skepticism about
the PP’s ability to avoid contagion from  Europe ’s debt crisis.  Growth Stalls  Spanish growth stalled in the third quarter as the nation
struggled to recover from a three-year slump after a 15-year
housing boom collapsed and the  budget deficit  expanded to 9.3
percent of GDP in 2010, compared with a 1.9 percent surplus in
2007. The outgoing Socialists, due to hand over power to the PP
in the second half of December, failed to reassure investors as
they cut public-wages, raised taxes and reduced investment.  The OECD sees the government’s 6 percent of GDP budget-
deficit goal being missed by 0.2 percentage point this year,
though forecasts for a shortfall of 4.4 percent in 2012 and 3
percent in 2013 will be met.  Private and government consumption will fall in 2012 as a
result of austerity measures, the OECD said, boosting
unemployment to 22.9 percent, above the 19.3 percent forecast in
May. The organization raised its 2011 jobless projection to 21.5
percent from 20.3 percent.  More consolidation efforts such as raising taxes will be
necessary if downward risks materialize, the OECD said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
