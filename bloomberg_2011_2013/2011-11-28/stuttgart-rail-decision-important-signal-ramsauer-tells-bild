A decision by voters in the German
state of Baden-Wuerttemberg to support a reconstruction of the
main train station in Stuttgart, the state’s capital, is an
“important signal” for  Germany  as a business location,
Transport Minister Peter Ramsauer told  Bild-Zeitung .  Opponents of the so-called Stuttgart 21 rail project should
accept the outcome of yesterday’s referendum, the newspaper
cited Ramsauer as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
