Drillisch AG , a German provider of
low-cost phone services, said a court issued an order that would
require Deutsche Telekom AG to withdraw a Nov. 7 press release
that caused Drillisch shares to fall 61 percent.  A Munich court issued the preliminary injunction in the
case, Drillisch said in a statement today. Deutsche Telekom
said in the Nov. 7 release that Maintal-based Drillisch
activated “several tens of thousands” of prepaid mobile-phone
connections since February that weren’t based on actual customer
relationships.  The court order is the latest Drillisch response to
Deutsche Telekom’s decision to distribute the Nov. 7 release and
file a criminal complaint in Hanau. Drillisch yesterday said
prosecutors were investigating  Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE)  board member
Manfred Balz over allegations of market manipulation.  Philipp Blank, a spokesman for Bonn-based Deutsche Telekom,
said the company hasn’t received an injunction and couldn’t
comment further.  Drillisch Chief Executive Officer Paschalis Choulidis said
at the time the allegations were “baseless.” The company said
in its statement yesterday that prosecutors opened the probe
into Balz after a Drillisch lawyer sent a letter.  Drillisch buys access to networks from operators such as
Vodafone Group Plc and sells phone services to customers with a
focus on the no-frills segment. It served about 2.6 million
mobile-phone clients as of the end of September.  To contact the reporter on this story:
