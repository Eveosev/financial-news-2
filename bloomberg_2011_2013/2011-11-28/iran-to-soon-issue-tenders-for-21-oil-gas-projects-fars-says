Iran  plans to soon start issuing
tenders for 21 oil and gas fields to domestic and foreign
investors,  Fars  reported, citing Oil Minister Rostam Qasemi.  The state-run  news agency  didn’t identify any of the
projects or provide a schedule  Sanctions over  Iran’s nuclear program  have discouraged
international companies from pursuing energy projects in the
Persian Gulf country, restricting Iran’s access to technology
and foreign investment.  Iran needs to invest as much as $50 billion a year in its
oil industry to maintain its position as OPEC’s second-largest
crude exporter and boost natural gas production, Oil Minister
Rostam Qasemi said Nov. 23. Iran needs to increase its output to
5.1 million barrels a day from 3.9 million barrels by 2015,
Qasemi said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
