Montree Sornpaisarn, chief executive
officer of  Maybank Kim Eng Securities (Thailand) Pcl , the
nation’s largest stock brokerage, comments on the nation’s stock
market and the impact of floods. He spoke today in a meeting
with investors, which was broadcast via the  Stock Exchange of
Thailand ’s website.  On Thai stocks:  “In term of valuations, Thai stocks remain attractive. The
price-to-earnings ratio is still very low compared with other
Asian countries. The impact of floods on the economy will be
only for a few quarters. The government’s spending on
rehabilitation will help the economy rebound next year.  ‘‘The economic slowdown will probably prompt the central
bank to cut benchmark  interest rates  in the next few meetings to
spur growth. That should benefit equity investments.  ‘‘Producers of cement, ceramic tiles and other building
materials will be the biggest beneficiaries from the
reconstruction following the flooding. We are quite positive
about this sector.’’  -- Editor: Richard Frost  To contact the reporter on this story:
