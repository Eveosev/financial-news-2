MAN SE (MAN)  will buy back its Ferrostaal
unit from International Petroleum Investment Co. and sell it on
to  MPC Capital AG  for 160 million euros ($213 million),
 Handelsblatt  reported, citing MPC head Axel Schroeder.  The deal is aimed at aiding a truck alliance between
 Volkswagen AG , MAN and  Scania AB (SCVB)  by removing uncertainties
linked to stock corporation laws, the newspaper said. Final
signatures are today, Handelsblatt said, citing unidentified
people close to the sellers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
