Russia will send three warships to
its naval base in  Syria  next month, including the country’s only
aircraft carrier,  Izvestia  reported, citing navy officials.  The vessels including the Admiral Kuznetsov, which will
have eight Su-33 fighter aircraft, several new MiG-29K fighter
jets and two Ka-27 naval helicopters on board, will arrive at
the Mediterranean port of Tartous in the spring, the Moscow-
based daily said.  Russia maintains a servicing point for naval vessels in
Tartous, its only military facility outside the former Soviet
republics. About 600 Russian Defense Ministry staff work at the
base, Izvestia said.  The naval mission to Syria, which has been an ally since
the Soviet era, will prevent NATO military involvement in the
Middle Eastern country, the newspaper cited former Russian naval
chief Victor Kravchenko as saying. Syrian President Bashar al- Assad’s regime has pursued a crackdown since March on anti-
government protests and came under unprecedented Arab League
sanctions yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
