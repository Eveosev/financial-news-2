(Corrects nine-month unemployment rate in second paragraph.)  Thailand â€™s unemployment rate may
climb to 1.8 percent to 2.3 percent in the fourth quarter
because of widespread flooding, the National Economic and Social
Development Board said in Bangkok today.  The jobless rate will recover in the first quarter and
return to a normal state in the second quarter as manufacturing
resumes, it said. In the first nine months, the unemployment
rate stood at 0.7 percent, the agency said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
