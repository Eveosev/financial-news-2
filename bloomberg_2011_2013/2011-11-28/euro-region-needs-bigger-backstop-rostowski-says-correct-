(Corrects to say trillion in first paragraph. For more
debt-crisis news, see EXT4.)  The euro region needs a financial
backstop of as much as 3 trillion euros ($4 trillion), Polish
Finance Minister  Jacek Rostowski  told  Germany ’s  Handelsblatt 
newspaper.  A lending capacity of 1 trillion euros for the European
Financial Stability Facility isn’t enough to impress investors,
he said.  A 50 percent reduction of large euro members’ outstanding
debt wouldn’t be possible without pushing the countries’ banking
systems into insolvency, Rostowski, who chairs meetings of
European Union finance ministers, also told the newspaper.  Deeper and faster integration of the 17-member euro region
must not lead to a division of the 27-member EU, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
