Rolls-Royce Holdings Plc signed a
contract with Deutsche Bank to lower the risk on its 3 billion
pounds ($4.6 billion) in pension liabilities and cover for the
financial burden of retired employees living longer.  The cost of the transaction will be borne by the pension
fund and there will be no “material effect” on funding
arrangements, the London-based company said in a statement. The
so-called longevity swap covers about 37,000 pensioners.  “We have made sure that as our pensioners live longer in
retirement we have made proper provision for them,” Finance
Director Andrew Shilston said in the statement today. “This is
the latest in a series of measures we have taken to achieve
greater certainty for our future funding requirements.”  The move means Deutsche Bank will make payments to the fund
to offset the additional cost when a retiree’s life extends
beyond an agreed average expectancy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
