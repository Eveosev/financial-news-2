Serbia’s government is considering
short-term borrowing options to ensure the economy’s survival
before preparing a fiscal-consolidation plan, Finance Minister
 Mladjan Dinkic  told newspaper Dnevnik in an interview.  The government will borrow wherever conditions are
“relatively” favorable, including selling Treasury bills,
Eurobonds and reaching bilateral loan agreements with
“friendly” countries, Dinkic was quoted as saying.  Serbia will ask Russia to reallocate as much as $300
million of an $800 million loan for railways to budget support
and will continue talks with the  International Monetary Fund  and
the World Bank, he told the newspaper based in Novi Sad.  To contact the reporter on this story:
