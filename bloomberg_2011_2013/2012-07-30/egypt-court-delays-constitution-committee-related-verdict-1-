An Egyptian administrative court
delayed until Sept. 24 a verdict on whether to recuse itself
from a hearing dealing with the possible disbanding of the
committee charged with drafting the new constitution.  The decision, announced today by Judge Karem Abdel-Latif,
came at the request of the Muslim Brotherhood’s political arm,
the Freedom and Justice Party. An attorney for the FJP, Abdel-
Moneim Abdel-Maqsoud said in an interview that they requested
the delay to have more time to submit supporting documents to
the court in their bid to have the judicial body recuse itself
from the case.  The decision further clouds the fate of the committee. Its
predecessor had been disbanded by court order following
challenges that it was dominated by Islamists and did not
reflect the full spectrum of  Egypt ’s political and social
forces.  To contact the reporter on this story:
