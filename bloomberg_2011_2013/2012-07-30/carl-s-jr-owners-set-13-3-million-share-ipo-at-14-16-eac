CKE Inc. (CK) , the franchiser of Carl’s
Jr. and Hardee’s burger chains, said an initial public offering
of 13.3 million shares planned today may fetch between $14 and
$16 a share.  CKE is offering half the shares and the company’s sole
stockholder, Apollo CKE Holdings LP, will offer the rest, the
Carpinteria, California-based company said today in a filing.
CKE will receive funds only from the shares it sells. The date
of the offering hasn’t been determined, said Beth Mansfield, a
CKE spokeswoman.  Some of the proceeds will go toward retiring about $82.1
million in bond debt due in 2018, according to the filing. The
remaining funds will be used for general corporate purposes. The
company had 3,263 locations in 42 states and 25 other countries
as of May 21, of which 73 percent were franchised.  CKE’s revenue fell 3.9 percent to $1.28 billion, while the
company had a net loss of $19.3 million in its fiscal 2012,
according to a filing in May.  The shares will be listed on the  New York  Stock Exchange
under the symbol CK.  Morgan Stanley (MS) , Citigroup Inc. and  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) 
will lead the IPO, according to the filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
