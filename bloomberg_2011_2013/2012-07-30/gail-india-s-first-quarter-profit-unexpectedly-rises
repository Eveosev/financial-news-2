GAIL India Ltd. (GAIL) , the nation’s
biggest natural gas distributor, posted fiscal first-quarter
profit that unexpectedly increased.  Net income  rose 15 percent to 11.3 billion rupees ($204
million), or 8.94 rupees a share, in the three months ended June
30 compared with 9.85 billion rupees, or 7.76 rupees, a year
earlier, the New Delhi-based company said in a statement today.
That beat the 8.97 billion rupee median  estimate  of 22 analysts
compiled by Bloomberg. Net sales rose 25 percent to 110.9
billion rupees.  GAIL climbed as much as 3.4 percent to 356.95 rupees and
traded at 352.55 rupees as of 2:51 p.m. in Mumbai. The shares
have declined 8 percent this year compared with an 11 percent
gain in the benchmark  Sensitive Index. (SENSEX)   To contact the reporter on this story:
