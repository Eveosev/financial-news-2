Treasuries rose amid speculation the
purchase of euro-region bonds by the  European Central Bank  may
not be enough to stem the sovereign-debt crisis, stoking demand
for  U.S. government debt .  The yield on the 10-year note  dropped  from the highest in
three weeks as ECB central bank policy makers prepare to meet on
Aug. 2. The benchmark yield fell to a record 1.3790 percent on
July 25 amid concern that  Europe ’s fiscal turmoil is harming
economic growth, before jumping at the end of last week after
policy makers pledged to support the euro. The Treasury boosted
its third-quarter-borrowing estimate.  “The market got ahead of itself on Friday,” said Justin Lederer, an interest rate strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald LP in
 New York , one of 21 primary dealers that trade with the  Federal
Reserve . “It’s a complete reversal. There are still
uncertainties, most notably in Europe.”  Benchmark 10-year  yields  fell four basis points, or 0.04
percentage point, to 1.50 percent at 5:02 p.m. New York time,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The yield reached
1.59 percent on July 27, the highest since July 6. The price of
the 1.75 percent security due May 2022 rose 13/32, or $4.06 per
$1,000 face amount, to 102 1/4.  Trading Pace  Treasury trading volume reported by ICAP Plc, the largest
inter-dealer broker of U.S. government debt, dropped to $203.4
billion at 5:01 p.m. in New York from $330.3 billion July 27.
That figure last week was the highest since June 6. Trading has
averaged $240.1 billion this year.  Draghi’s pledge last week to do “whatever it takes’” to
stem the crisis raised concern he has to produce a plan or face
renewed selling in European bond markets, where rising Spanish
and Italian yields have fueled speculation that the euro bloc
will break up.  “The market doesn’t have a lot of trust that they’ll do
anything,” said  Thomas Roth , senior trader in New York at
Mitsubishi UFJ Securities USA Inc. “They have to prove
themselves.”  The yield on the German 10-year bund declined two basis
points to 1.38 percent. Spanish 10-year yields slid 13 basis
points to 6.61 percent, falling for the fourth consecutive day.  Few Views  The  Federal Open Market Committee  starts a two-day meeting
tomorrow. While policy makers refrained from introducing a third
round of asset purchases at their meeting last month, Fed
Chairman Ben S. Bernanke indicated in two days of testimony in
 Washington  ending July 18 that it’s an option. The benchmark
rate has been in a range between zero and 0.25 percent since
December 2008.  The U.S. central bank purchased $2.3 trillion in securities
in two rounds of a strategy called quantitative easing from 2008
to 2011 to spur the economic recovery. In an existing program
called Operation Twist, the central bank is swapping short-term
Treasuries in its holdings for longer maturities.  Policy makers may this week extend the commitment to low
rates “at least through mid-2015,” Robert V. DiClemente,
Citigroup Inc.’s chief U.S. economist, wrote in a report today.
If the committee forges ahead with QE3, it would be about $400-
$500 billion and focus largely on mortgage-backed securities, he
wrote, adding that Operation Twist would be kept in place as
scheduled.  Market Tone  “The tone will be more dovish, but ultimately they won’t
actually embark on any major differences in the current policy
stance,” on Aug. 1, said Ira Jersey, an interest-rate
strategist at Credit Suisse Group AG in New York, one of 21
primary dealers that trade directly with the Fed, in an
interview with  Tom Keene  and Ken Prewitt on Bloomberg Radio.
“September is probably the more likely time.”  If the July and August employment numbers are below 100,000
then the Fed may embark upon purchases of mortgages, Jersey
said.  Employers in the U.S. added 100,000 workers in July,
following a gain of 80,000 in June, according to the median
forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg News before Labor
Department figures on Aug. 3. Unemployment stayed at 8.2
percent, a separate survey predicts.  The central bank purchased $1.8 billion of Treasuries due
from February 2036 to February 2042 today. The purchases are
part of the U.S. central bank’s plan to lower borrowing costs by
swapping short-term Treasuries in its holdings for longer
maturities.  Borrowing Plans  The U.S. Treasury Department raised its net borrowing
estimate for the current quarter, reflecting in part lower
revenue, higher spending and higher issuances of state and local
government securities.  The Treasury increased its estimate for July to September
to $276 billion, which is $12 billion higher than projected in
April. Treasury officials see net borrowing of $316 billion in
the quarter starting Oct. 1. In the quarter that ended June 30,
the Treasury borrowed $172 billion, compared with a previous
estimate of $182 billion.  The Treasury will make its so-called quarterly refunding
announcement on Aug. 1. The government has sold $32 billion in
three-year notes, $24 billion in 10-year debt and $16 billion in
30-year bonds each refunding month since November 2010.
Quarterly refundings are held each February, May, August and
November.  Deflation Odds  For all the concern over the slowdown in the  U.S. economy ,
the bond market shows there’s less risk of deflation now than
before the Fed’s first two rounds of large-scale debt purchases.  The Fed’s favored bond-market gauge of inflation
expectations was at 2.39 percent last week, above the 2 percent
levels in 2008 and 2010 that led the central bank to inject $2.3
trillion into the economy by buying Treasuries and mortgage-
related bonds, a policy known as quantitative easing. The  five-
year, five-year  forward break-even rate shows how much traders
anticipate consumer prices will rise during a period of five
years starting in 2017.  The expectation that consumer prices will increase means
Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  has persuaded traders the U.S. will
avoid the deflation that has slowed  Japan ’s economy since 1995.  U.S. 10-year yields will rise to 1.88 percent by year-end,
based on forecasts in a Bloomberg survey of financial companies,
with the most recent projections given the heaviest weightings.  Treasuries have returned 0.7 percent this month through
July 27, according the Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes.
They have returned 2.4 percent in 2012, compared with a 3.3
percent return for German debt and 3.5 percent for U.K. gilts,
the indexes show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
