A sub-committee of  Egypt ’s
constitutional panel agreed today that the parliament can be
only be dissolved by a presidential decree after a referendum.  The committee also decided that under the new constitution,
which is in the process of being drafted, the president will be
the supreme commander of the armed forces, the state-run Ahram
Gate reported today, citing Salah Abdel Maaboud, a committee
member. He or she will have the power to declare war subject to
parliament’s approval, it said.  The decision is likely to raise tensions in the political
arena between the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, which
took interim power after the ouster of  Hosni Mubarak , and the
Muslim Brotherhood, which dominated the now-disbanded
parliament. Recently elected President Mohamed Mursi comes from
the ranks of the Islamist group.  To contact the reporter on this story:
