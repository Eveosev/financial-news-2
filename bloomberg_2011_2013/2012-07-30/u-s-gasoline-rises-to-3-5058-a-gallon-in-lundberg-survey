The average price for regular
gasoline at U.S. filling stations rose 9.55 cents in the past
two weeks to $3.5058 a gallon, according to Lundberg Survey Inc.  The survey covers the two weeks ended July 27 and is based
on information received from about 2,500 stations by the
Camarillo, California-based company. The average is down 19.55
cents from a year earlier. Gasoline is 46.13 cents below the
year-to-date high of $3.9671 on April 6.  “The rise is related to an increase in crude prices,”
 Trilby Lundberg , president of Lundberg Survey, said yesterday in
a telephone interview. “This comes after the price peaked for
the year in April and then crashed for 14 straight weeks. In the
latest two weeks, it has turned around and headed up.”  Prices at the pump rose as the front-month contract for
West Texas Intermediate crude on the  New York  Mercantile
Exchange advanced $3.03, or 3.5 percent, in two weeks to $90.13
a barrel on July 27. Futures have declined 18 percent since
reaching a year-to-date settlement high of $109.77 on Feb. 24.  Gasoline futures on the Nymex increased 7.17 cents, or 2.5
percent, in the two weeks ended July 27 to $2.8878. Gasoline has
lost 15 percent since reaching a year-to-date high of $3.4166 on
March 26.  Policy Makers to Meet  Crude oil and gasoline have risen on speculation that a
struggling U.S. jobs market, Europe’s debt crisis and a slowdown
in China will prompt more fiscal easing to stimulate growth.  Policy makers from the  Federal Reserve , the  European
Central Bank  and the Bank of England meet next week amid
speculation they will ease monetary policy.  Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke ’s Federal Open Market
Committee meets July 31 and Aug. 1. Bernanke told Congress this
month that the Fed is considering further options to ease policy
if the faltering recovery fails to reduce unemployment.  European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  will hold
talks with Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann about a raft of
measures including bond purchases, two central bank officials
said July 27. Draghi said July 26 that the bank “is ready to do
whatever it takes” to preserve the euro, and German Chancellor
 Angela Merkel  and French President  Francois Hollande  pledged the
next day to do everything necessary to protect the currency.  Oil may decline next week on speculation that central banks
will take insufficient steps to bolster economic growth, a
Bloomberg survey showed.  Eighteen of 30 analysts, or 60 percent, forecast crude will
decrease through Aug. 3. Nine respondents, or 30 percent,
predicted that futures will increase and three said there will
be little change in prices. Last week, 44 percent of analysts
projected a drop.  The highest price in the lower 48 U.S. states among the
markets surveyed was on Long Island, where the average was $3.83
a gallon, Lundberg said. Los Angeles-area retail stations
averaged $3.79.  The lowest price was in Jackson, Mississippi, where
customers paid an average of $3.14 a gallon.  To contact the reporters on this story:
