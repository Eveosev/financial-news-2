The selection of  Egypt ’s new
government is 70 percent complete, and talks are ongoing about
filling the remaining posts, Prime Minister-designate Hisham Qandil told reporters today.  The news comes amid mounting criticism over the delay in
the formation of the Cabinet, which is slated to take over from
the interim government appointed by the military council that
ruled Egypt after  Hosni Mubarak ’s ouster last year. The generals
handed over power to President Mohamed Mursi at the end of June.  Qandil, a little-known irrigation minister, was chosen by
Mursi to head the new government on July 24. His selection was
criticised by secularist groups and other parties who saw him as
a far cry from the national unity figure that the president
pledged to appoint.  Presidential spokesman Yasser Ali denied reports that the
government will change the current minister of defense, Field
Marshal Mohamed Hussein Tantawi, who is also head of the
military council, in the cabinet due to be announced on Aug. 2.  To contact the reporter on this story:
