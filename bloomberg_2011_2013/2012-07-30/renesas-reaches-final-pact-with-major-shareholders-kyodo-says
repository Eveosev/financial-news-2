Renesas Electronics Corp. (6723)  reached a
final agreement with its three biggest shareholders for 50
billion yen ($639 million) of loan support, Kyodo reported,
without citing anyone.  NEC Corp. (6701)  and  Hitachi Ltd. (6501) , two of the three biggest
shareholders of the world’s largest maker of microcontrollers
for cars, said last month they plan to support Renesas as it
seeks financial aid following at least five straight  quarterly
losses .  Mitsubishi Electric Corp. (6503)  is the other large
shareholder, and combined  they own 91 percent  of Renesas.  Yoichi Kobayashi, a Renesas spokesman, said the company
doesn’t comment on speculation. Takehiko Kato, an NEC spokesman,
and Tamie Nagamoto, a Hitachi spokeswoman, both declined to
comment on the report. A Mitsubishi Electric official, who
refused to give his name citing company policy, also declined to
comment.  Renesas, after posting losses amid a slowdown in demand for
chips used inside TVs and computers, is said to have asked for
100 billion yen in assistance. Banks including Mitsubishi UFJ
Financial Group Inc.,  Mizuho Financial Group Inc. (8411)  and  Sumitomo
Mitsui Trust Holdings Inc. (8309)  have agreed to continue offering
almost 50 billion yen in lines of credit to Renesas, according
to two people with knowledge of the matter.  Renesas fell 3.8 percent to 226 yen at the close of trading
in  Tokyo , taking the year-to-date decline to 52 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
