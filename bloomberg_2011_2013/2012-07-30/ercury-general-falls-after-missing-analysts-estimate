Mercury General Corp. (MCY) , the
California-based automobile insurer, fell the most in almost a
year after profit missed analysts’ estimates as the company
incurred an expense tied to policies sold in prior periods.  The insurer slid 5.8 percent to $38.44 at the close in New
York, the biggest drop since Aug. 8. The company has declined 16
percent this year, compared with a 10 percent gain in the
 Russell 1000 Index. (RIY)   Mercury reported a net loss of $5.3 million for the
quarter, compared with a profit of $57.3 million a year earlier,
the Los Angeles-based insurer said today in a statement.
Operating income, which excludes some investment results,
dropped to 19 cents a share, compared with 76 cents a year
earlier, missing the 66-cent  average estimate  of five analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg.  The company added $23 million to reserves in the quarter,
“largely the result of re-estimates of California bodily-injury
losses which have experienced higher average severities and more
late-reported claims,” according to the statement.  Catastrophes cost the insurer $8 million in the quarter,
compared with $3 million a year earlier, led by wind and hail in
the Midwest region, the firm said. Net investment income was
$31.7 million, down 12 percent from the same period in 2011.  NI INS
