China ’s benchmark price for power-
station  coal  fell for a 12th week to the lowest level since 2009
as electricity demand slowed and hydropower output increased.  Coal with an energy value of 5,500 kilocalories per
kilogram at the Chinese port of Qinhuangdao dropped to a range
of 620  yuan  ($97) to 635 yuan a metric ton as of yesterday,
according to the China Coal Transport and Distribution
Association today. The midpoint was 0.8 percent less than a week
earlier and the lowest price since Oct. 19, 2009, data compiled
by Bloomberg show.  Electricity output  in June stalled from a year earlier as
 China’s economy  expanded in the second quarter at the slowest
pace in more than three years. Demand for coal-fired power,
accounting for 80 percent of the country’s needs, also fell as
dams supplied more electricity amid increased rainfall.  Stockpiles at Qinhuangdao, which delivers half the nation’s
seaborne domestic coal supplies, fell 0.9 percent from a week
earlier to 8.47 million tons, according to today’s data.  Inventories were above 8 million tons for the ninth week,
declining 1.2 percent this month, compared with 11 percent in
July 2011, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Port stockpiles
typically fluctuate during this time of the year as utilities
draw down local supplies and replenish fuel from delivery
harbors to meet peak summer power demand.  Water levels for the Yellow River are rising to the highest
in decades as China evacuated 40,000 people in the northern
provinces of Shanxi and Shaanxi, which are in danger of floods,
according to official reports over the weekend.  China’s  hydropower dams  produced 75.3 billion kilowatt-
hours of electricity in June, or 19 percent of total power
output, compared with 17 percent a year earlier, government data
show. Thermal power output was 295.4 billion kilowatt-hours in
June, or 75 percent of the total, compared with 79 percent a
year earlier, according to the data.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
