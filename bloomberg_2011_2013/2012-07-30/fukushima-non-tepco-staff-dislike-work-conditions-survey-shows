Most workers hired to help cleanup
the wrecked Fukushima nuclear plant are unhappy with the working
environment, citing insufficient radiation protection poor food,
sanitary and transport conditions.  Sixty nine percent of respondents surveyed by Tokyo
Electric Power Co., the operator of the Fukushima Dai-Ichi
station, complained about food, while 62 percent aren’t happy
with radiation protection, the company known as Tepco said in a
statement. Tepco had responses from 1,913 workers at the plant,
excluding its own employees, in the survey conducted in May.  Tepco affiliate  Tokyo Energy & Systems Inc. (1945)  said last week
that its subcontractor sent workers into the Fukushima station
in December with lead plates to mask radiation meters in an
effort to hide their exposure. The government, which approved a
partial nationalization of Tepco in May, has started an
investigation.  “If a violation of the law is confirmed, we will deal with
it in a strict manner,” Health Minister Yoko Komiyama told
reporters on July 24. “As we have the radiation limit to
protect workers’ health, the law shouldn’t be violated.”  Demands from workers included increasing the number of
toilets, more hood masks to protect against radiation,
installing desks and chairs in a rest area, and increasing pay,
according to the survey.  To contact the reporters on this story:
