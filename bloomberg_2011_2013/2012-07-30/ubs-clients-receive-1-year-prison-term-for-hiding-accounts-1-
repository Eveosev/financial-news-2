Sean Roberts and Nadia Roberts,
former clients of  UBS AG (UBSN) , were sentenced to a year in prison and
$3.2 million in fines and restitution for hiding millions of
dollars in secret offshore bank accounts, the  Justice Department 
said.  The two California residents, who owned test pilot training
schools, filed false tax returns from 2004 to 2008 and failed to
report a secret Swiss account at UBS, the agency said in an e-
mail. The couple transferred more than $1.2 million from their
company to a UBS account and falsely reported the transfers as
deductible interest payments on their corporate income tax
returns, the department said. The two pleaded guilty last year.  Edward Robbins, the Roberts’ attorney, didn’t immediately
respond to an e-mail seeking comment on the sentence.  The case is U.S. v. Roberts, 11-00199, U.S. District Court,
Eastern District of California (Fresno).  To contact the reporter on this story:
