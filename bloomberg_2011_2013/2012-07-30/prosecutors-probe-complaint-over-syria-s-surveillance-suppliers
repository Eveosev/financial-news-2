French prosecutors are looking into
a complaint by  human rights  organizations concerning French
companies alleged to supply Syrian President Bashar al-Assad
with surveillance equipment to use against protesters.  The preliminary inquiry was opened on July 26 into the
International Federation for Human Rights and the Human Rights
League’s complaint against Qosmos SA, a prosecution spokeswoman
said today, declining to be named according to office policy.  “Companies must know that they cannot sell this type of
equipment to authoritarian regimes without being held
accountable,” Michel Tubiana, LDH’s honorary president, said in
a joint statement by the groups posted  online .  Qosmos is a Paris-based company whose products were
purchased to build a system for al-Assad’s regime to scan the
Syrian communications network, according to a Bloomberg News
report in November. Violence began in  Syria  in March 2011 and
has killed more than 19,000 people, 5,000 of whom are government
troops, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.  Benoit Chabert, a lawyer for Qosmos, didn’t immediately
return a call for comment on the complaint. Calls to the Qosmos
weren’t answered.  Agence France-Presse  reported on the complaint earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
