Apple Inc. (AAPL)  said downloads of its
Mountain Lion software exceeded three million in four days,
making it the most successful operating system release in the
company’s history.  Facebook Inc. (FB) ’s social-networking service will be
integrated with the software in an upcoming update, Cupertino,
California-based Apple said today in a statement. Mountain Lion
is available through the Mac App Store as an upgrade to Lion or
Snow Leopard users for $19.99.  Apple is adding functions to its software as part of a
broader push to make its products work more seamlessly together,
encouraging customers to purchase multiple devices. Mountain
Lion has many features from the iPhone and iPad, including a
notification system so text messages sent to those devices will
also show up on a Mac computer.  That fosters “stickiness” so that users won’t want to
switch to another product because of all the time and effort
they have invested with Apple’s gadgets, according to  Chris Jones , an analyst at market researcher Canalys.  To contact the reporter on this story:
