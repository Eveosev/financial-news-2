A fund managed by  Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. (GS)  agreed to buy a building near Berlin’s Brandenburg
Gate valued at about 150 million euros ($184 million) from
 Commerzbank AG (CBK) , two people with knowledge of the matter said.  The sale of the  Lindencorso building , which has apartments,
offices and a  Volkswagen AG (VOW)  showroom, will probably be completed
by the end of September, said the people, who asked not to be
identified before the deal is announced. The property, at the
corner of Unter den Linden and Friedrichstrasse in Berlin’s
Mitte district, was built in 1997 and has 47,270 square meters
(508,810 square feet) of space.  International firms have boosted their German commercial
property assets over the past two years as they seek a safe
European investment amid the sovereign debt crisis. Non-German
buyers spent 9.3 billion euros on German offices and malls last
year, the most since 2008, according to data compiled by
Chicago-based brokerage Jones Lang LaSalle Inc.  Whitehall Street Real Estate Funds, managed by Goldman, is
buying Lindencorso from a Commerz Real AG closed-end real estate
investment fund, the people said. Whitehall already owns the
leasehold.  Goldman Sachs spokeswoman Monika Schaller and Commerzbank
spokesman Markus Esser declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
