Chilean  interest-rate swaps  rose the
most in four months after the central bank signaled monetary
easing would occur only when the economy shows more signs of
slowing.  The two-year swap, which reflects traders’ expectations for
future  interest rates , rose 12 basis points, or 0.12 percentage
point, to 4.65 percent, the biggest increase since March 30. The
one-year swap rate advanced nine basis points to 4.83 percent.  Policy makers were unanimous in a decision to keep their
key rate unchanged this month, according to minutes published on
the bank website today. They didn’t discuss changing borrowing
costs for a second month after considering a quarter-point
increase in May, the minutes showed.  “The central bank reaffirmed a very neutral stance,”
Mauro Roca, a strategist at Deutsche Bank AG said in a phone
interview today from  New York . “The economy is very resilient
and is growing slightly above expectations and there is no slack
in the goods and labor market. The central bank wants to leave
its options open to move in any direction.”  Retail and supermarket sales growth surged in June,
expanding 8.9 percent and 12 percent from the previous year
respectively, the National Statistics Institute said in a report
today. Still, manufacturing decelerated in June, climbing 1.1
percent following a 2.8 percent expansion in May, the institute
said. The median estimate of 14 economists surveyed by Bloomberg
was for manufacturing to climb 3.2 percent in June.  To contact the reporter on this story:
