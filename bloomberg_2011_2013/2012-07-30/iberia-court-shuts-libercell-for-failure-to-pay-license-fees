Atlantic Wireless Inc.’s LiberCell,
a Liberian mobile-phone company owned Hits Telecom Holding
Company of  Kuwait , was ordered shut by a tax court in the West
African nation for failing to pay license fees.  LiberCell owes about $1.5 million in fees to the government
and will be closed until it settles its debt, according to a
court document posted on the door of the company’s office in
Monrovia, the capital, today.  Talks are under way to have the money sent from Hits
Telecom’s African unit, LiberCell Chief Financial Officer
Abdallah Sbeiti said. The transfer will take about three days,
he said in an interview today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
