The cost of insuring Asia-Pacific
corporate and sovereign bonds from non-payment declined,
according to traders of credit-default swaps.  The  Markit iTraxx Asia  index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan dropped 7 basis points to 160 basis
points as of 8:41 a.m. in  Hong Kong , Royal Bank of Scotland
Group Plc prices show. The gauge, which closed last week down
6.4 basis points this month, is headed for its lowest close
since April 4, according to data provider CMA.  The  Markit iTraxx Australia  index fell 4 basis points to
167 as of 10:46 a.m. in Sydney,  National Australia Bank Ltd. (NAB) 
prices show. The measure is on track for its lowest close since
May 8, according to CMA, which is owned by McGraw-Hill Cos. and
compiles prices quoted by dealers in the privately negotiated
market.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index declined 6 basis points to
179 basis points as of 9:20 a.m. in  Tokyo , Deutsche Bank AG
prices show. The benchmark has traded between 168.5 and 188.8
this month, CMA prices show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
