Attorneys for  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  and  Samsung
Electronics Co. (005930)  began interviewing potential jurors for a trial
over their mobile-device patent dispute in  San Jose , California.  Apple lawyer William Lee and Samsung lawyer  Bill Price 
started questioning individual jurors today after U.S. District
Judge Lucy Koh finished interviewing a pool of about 24 jurors
to select a 10-member panel for the trial. Koh said the jury
will be selected after a break.  Jurors will decide each companyâ€™s claims that its rival
infringed patents covering designs and technology for mobile
devices, with potential damage awards reaching billions of
dollars.  The case is the first U.S. jury trial of a battle being
fought on four continents for dominance of a mobile-device
market that Bloomberg Industries said was $312 billion last
year.  The case is Apple Inc. v. Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd., 11-
cv-01846, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California
(San Jose).  To contact the reporter on this story:
