An expected slump in global grain
production on drought in the U.S, the  Black Sea region  and
Europe may cause shortages and food riots in the  Middle East ,
Italian farm-industry organization Confagricoltura said.  Unusual weather is “drastically compromising” the grain
harvest in the Black Sea region from Russia to Ukraine and
Kazakhstan, as well as in Europe, mainly in Italy but also
Hungary, Romania and Serbia, the Rome-based group wrote in an e-
mailed statement today.  “The climatic shocks will have a major impact on the
economy and society,” Confagricoltura wrote. “The consequences
risk being a shortage of food for the population and socio-
political upheaval.”  Corn prices in Chicago have climbed more than 60 percent
since mid-June to a record amid concern that heat and drought
will reduce harvests in the U.S., as well as southern  Europe  and
Ukraine, resulting in a draining of global stockpiles.  To contact the reporter on this story:
