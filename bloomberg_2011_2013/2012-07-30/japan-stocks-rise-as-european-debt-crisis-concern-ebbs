Japanese stocks rose for a third day
as support grew among European leaders to tackle the debt crisis
and ensure the survival of the monetary union, boosting the
outlook for exporters.  Asics Corp., a maker of sporting goods that generates 24
percent of sales in  Europe , advanced 1.8 percent.  Konica Minolta
Holdings Inc. (4902)  surged 5.8 percent after first-quarter operating
profit nearly doubled. Fujitsu Ltd., Japan’s biggest provider of
computer services, plunged 12 percent to its lowest level since
1984 after posting a wider-than-expected loss.  The Nikkei 225 Stock Average advanced 0.8 percent to

0.7 percent to 731.74.  “There is a strong political and financial will for the
euro,” said George Boubouras, Melbourne-based head of
investment strategy at UBS AG’s Australian unit. The Swiss bank
has about $1.5 trillion in assets under management globally.
“Actions that address the EU challenges will create the
opportunity for a sustainable rally ahead.”  Leaders in Berlin, Paris and  Rome  have backed European
Central Bank President  Mario Draghi ’s approach to combat the
sovereign-debt crisis, saying they will do what’s needed to
protect the 17-nation euro. The proposal involves the region’s
rescue fund buying  government bonds , two central bank officials
said July 27 on condition of anonymity.  The ECB chief meets with U.S. Treasury Secretary  Timothy
Geithner  in  Frankfurt  today. Federal Reserve policy makers meet
this week ahead of a jobs report to weigh additional stimulus to
combat a slowdown in the world’s biggest economy.  Europe Stocks  Companies that do business in Europe advanced. Asics gained
1.8 percent to 904 yen. NTN Corp., a maker of bearings and
machinery parts that gets 26 percent of sales from the region,
advanced 1.5 percent to 201 yen.  Stocks rose even as  Japan ’s industrial production
unexpectedly fell in June. Output fell 0.1 percent in June from
May, when it dropped 3.4 percent, the Trade Ministry said today.

was for a 1.5 percent increase last month.  This week marks the  busiest  of Japan’s earnings season,
with more than 700 companies on the Topix reporting results,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The Topix declined 1 percent last week, the third-straight
loss, as concern about Europe’s debt crisis worsened after
Moody’s Investors Service cut its credit rating outlook for
 Germany , the Netherlands and Luxembourg. The gauge’s 17 percent
drop since March 27 has left it trading at almost half the
valuation of the  MSCI World Index (MXWO)  relative to book value, or
assets minus liabilities, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Konica Surges  Konica Minolta  rose 5.8 percent to 550 yen as operating
profit surged 94 percent to 6.3 billion yen ($80.3 million).  Fujitsu fell 12 percent to 295 yen after reporting a loss
of 23.8 billion yen for the three months ended June 30 as demand
fell for its chips used in televisions and servers. Analysts had

compiled by Bloomberg.  Hitachi Cable Ltd. slumped 9.2 percent to 139 yen as the
maker of optical fibers lowered its full-year profit forecast.  Komatsu Ltd., the world’s second-largest maker of
construction equipment, declined 1.8 percent to 1,731 yen. The
Nikkei newspaper reported that the company’s first-quarter
operating profit declined for the first time in 10 quarters
after equipment sales in  China  halved due to lower public works
spending.  Nuclear Hearings  Utilities lead declines among the Topix’s 33 industry
groups. The shares fell after about 70 percent of participants
in public hearings yesterday said the nation should end nuclear-
power generation by 2030.  Kansai Electric Power Co. (9503)  plunged 11 percent to 555 yen.
Tokyo Electric Power Co., owner of the crippled Fukushima Dai-
