Franklin Resources Inc. (BEN) , manager of
the Franklin and Templeton mutual funds, beat analysts’
estimates after gathering money into its funds amid sagging
global markets.  Net income for the three months ended June 30 fell to
$455.3 million, or $2.12 a share, from $503.3 million, or $2.26,
a year earlier, the  San Mateo , California-based company said
today in a statement. Eight analysts surveyed by Bloomberg
expected  profit  averaging $2 a share.  Franklin got $4.8 billion in deposits in the quarter, as
clients put money into fixed-income funds while withdrawing cash
from equity funds. Chief Executive Officer Gregory Johnson has
urged investors to put more money into stock funds, arguing that
in the coming years equities are likely to deliver better
returns than they did in the past decade.  “Given the weak macro environment, this was a better-than-
expected performance on earnings and flows,”  Michael Kim , an
analyst with Sandler O’Neill & Partners LP in  New York , said in
a telephone interview. He has a buy recommendation on the stock.  Franklin rose 2.2 percent to $114.67 at 1:29 p.m. in New
York trading. The shares gained 17 percent this year through
last week, compared with an increase of 7.6 percent for the 20-
member  Standard & Poor’s  index of custody banks and asset
managers.  Client Deposits  Franklin’s deposits fell from $5.6 billion in the prior
quarter and $21.7 billion in the year-earlier period. Johnson,
in pre-recorded remarks posted on the firm’s website, said
investors remain skittish about equities.  The plunge in stocks during the financial crisis “left a
lasting impression on many investors and trillions of dollars
are sitting in low-yielding savings instruments,” he said.  Franklin drew $5.5 billion into its fixed-income funds
during the quarter, as investors pulled $1.1 billion from stock
funds. In the year ended June 30, the firm’s equity assets
dropped 10 percent to $278.6 billion as bond assets rose 5.4
percent to $319.5 billion.  Performance at the company’s flagship fund, the $60 billion
 Templeton Global Bond (TPINX)  Fund,  bounced back  this year after it
trailed 91 percent of rivals in 2011, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. The fund, managed by  Michael Hasenstab , gained 7.6
percent through July 26, better than 85 percent of peers. Over
five years, the fund topped 92 percent of rivals.  Flagship Fund  Templeton Global Bond attracted $17.6 billion in 2010 and
$13.4 billion in 2011, ranking among the industry’s best-selling
funds, according to Chicago-based  Morningstar Inc. (MORN)  In the last
two months of 2011, the fund suffered withdrawals after
performance slumped when Hasenstab’s currency bets failed to pay
off. Investors added $193 million to the fund in the first six
months of 2012.  The  MSCI ACWI (MXWD)  Index of  global stocks  fell 8.7 percent in
the 12 months ended June 30. More than 70 percent of Franklin’s
equity money is in global and international funds, the company
reported.  Investors withdrew $42.6 billion from funds that buy U.S.
stocks in the first half of 2012, Morningstar data show. They
added $25.2 billion to international equity funds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
