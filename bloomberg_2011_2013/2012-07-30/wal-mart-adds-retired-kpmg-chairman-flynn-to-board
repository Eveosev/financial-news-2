Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT)  appointed
retired KPMG International Chairman Timothy Flynn to its board.  Flynn brings experience in managing global operations,
including corporate governance, according to a U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission filing today. Flynn, 55, spent 32 years
at KPMG International and its predecessors, serving as the
company’s international chairman from 2007 until his retirement
in October 2011, according to the filing.  The appointment comes as the world’s largest retailer works
with several law firms to improve its compliance with the
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act following an investigation into
allegations of bribery in its Mexican unit. While the
investigation prompted several pension funds to say they would
vote against some or all of the Bentonville, Arkansas-based
company’s directors at its June annual meeting, all board
members were re-elected.  The company is also cooperating with the SEC and  U.S.
Department of Justice  as they investigate allegations that in
2005 some executives and directors may have covered up reports
of alleged bribery by the company that was aimed at expediting
store openings in the region. The alleged bribes would be a
violation of FCPA.  Wal-Mart rose less than 1 percent to $74.98 at the close
in  New York . The shares were up 25 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
