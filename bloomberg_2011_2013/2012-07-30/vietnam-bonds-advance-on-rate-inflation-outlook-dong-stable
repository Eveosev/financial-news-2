Vietnam ’s government bonds gained,
with the three-year yield sliding the most since May, after the
central bank forecast lower inflation and borrowing costs by the
end of the year. The dong was little changed.  Interest rates  on the dong deposits could drop below 8
percent if annual inflation slows to less than 7 percent by
year-end, according to a statement on the government website
yesterday that cited Governor Nguyen Van Binh. The cost of some
preferential loans may fall to levels below 10 percent in 2013,
Binh said. The government had previously forecast 2012 inflation
at 7 percent to 8 percent.  “This could be a hint from the governor that the central
bank may reduce the dong deposit rate to below 8 percent from
the current 9 percent,” said Nguyen Duc Hai, Ho Chi Minh City-
based portfolio manager at Manulife Asset Management. The
forecast has fuelled bond demand, according to Hai.  The  three-year yield  fell 20 basis points, or 0.20
percentage point, to 9.52 percent, the biggest one-day decline
since May 15, according to a daily fixing from banks compiled by
Bloomberg.  The dong traded 20,865 per dollar as of 3:14 p.m. in Hanoi,
compared with 20,868 last week, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The  State Bank  of Vietnam set its  reference rate  at
20,828, unchanged since Dec. 26, according to its website. The
currency is allowed to trade as much as 1 percent on either side
of the rate.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
