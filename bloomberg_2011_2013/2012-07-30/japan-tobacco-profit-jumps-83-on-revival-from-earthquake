Japan Tobacco Inc. (2914) ,  Asia ’s largest
listed cigarette maker by market value, reported first-quarter
profit rose 83 percent as it recovered some of the market share
lost after last year’s earthquake.  Net income rose to 84.5 billion yen ($1.1 billion ) from
46.1 billion yen a year earlier, the company said in a statement
today.  The seller of Mild Seven cigarettes is expanding overseas
and has launched new products as it faces a shrinking domestic
market. Its share in the domestic tobacco business recovered to
about 59 percent as of June, according to the company.  Japan 
Tobacco’s market share had dropped to 55 percent in the year
ended March 2012 from 64 percent a year earlier after the March
11, 2011, earthquake hurt sales.  “The domestic tobacco business has come out of the effect
of last year’s earthquake with steady market share recovery
following a number of sales and marketing initiatives,”
President Mitsuomi Koizumi said in today’s statement.  Sales rose 17 percent to 512 billion yen from 437 billion
yen a year earlier. The company left its forecast for the fiscal
year ended March 31 unchanged at 318 billion yen.  The company in May agreed to pay 475 million euros, or $597
million at the time, for Belgium-based Gryson NV to expand in
 Europe ’s roll-your-own cigarette market. Sales volumes are
declining in Japan’s cigarette industry amid tax increases and
increased health consciousness.  A law passed last year allowed the Japanese  government,
the cigarette maker’s biggest shareholder, to sell one-third of
its entire holding to help pay for earthquake rebuilding. The
government  owns   50 percent of Japan Tobacco, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Japan Tobacco is considering buying back as much as 250
billion yen of its shares if the government sells its shares,
the company has said.  Japan Tobacco shares closed up 1.3 percent to 2,445 yen
ahead of the earnings announcement. The stock is up 35 percent
for the year compared with a 0.43 percent gain for the broader
Topix index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
