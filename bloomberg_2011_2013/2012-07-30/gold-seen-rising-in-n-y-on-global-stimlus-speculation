Gold little changed in New York, may
climb for a fourth straight session, on speculation that the
 Federal Reserve  and the  European Central Bank  will take further
steps to spur growth.  The Fed starts a two-day meeting tomorrow and the ECB
announces its next policy decision on Aug. 2. The Bank of
England’s Monetary Policy Committee also convenes this week.
Prices surged 70 percent from the end of December 2008 to June
2011 as the U.S. central bank kept borrowing costs at a record
low and bought $2.3 trillion of debt in two rounds of so-called
quantitative easing.  “Some people are expecting new stimulus measures from the
Fed and the ECB this week,”  Frank Lesh , a trader at FuturePath
Trading in Chicago, said in a telephone interview.  Gold futures for December delivery rose less than 0.1
percent to $1,623 an ounce at 10:50 a.m. on the Comex in New
York. Four sessions of gains would mark the longest rally since
June 15.  Bullion jumped 2.5 percent last week after ECB President
 Mario Draghi  pledged to do whatever it takes to preserve the
euro.  Silver futures for September delivery jumped 1.8 percent to
$27.99 an ounce.  To contact the reporter on this story:
