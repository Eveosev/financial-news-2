British-American Investments Co. (BRIT) , a
Kenyan company which owns money managers and insurance
businesses, gained the most in seven month on bets it returned
to profit in the first half of this year.  The stock jumped 5.4 percent, the most since Dec. 30, to
close at 5.90 shillings in Nairobi, the capital.  British-American reported a full-year pretax loss of 1.7
billion shillings ($20.2 million), compared with year-earlier
profit of 2.7 billion shillings, the company said in March,
citing the “poor” performance of the stock market in 2011. The
 Nairobi Securities Exchange All Share Index (NSEASI)  is up 26 percent
this year, having plunged 30 percent in 2011.  “They took a big unrealized loss, of about 2.25 billion
shillings on their equities in full year and given the
performance of the market so far that impairment is going to be
repaired in the next earnings release,” Aly Khan Satchu, chief
executive officer of Nairobi-based investment company Rich
Management Ltd., said in a phone interview today.  The company has cut its stake in  Equity Bank Ltd. (EQBNK)  to 7.66
percent from 10.63 percent and reduced its holding in  Housing
Finance Ltd. (HFCL)  to 18.93 percent from 20.78 percent,  Business Daily 
said July 27, citing regulatory filings at the end of June.  In April, British-American said it plans to tap
international investors to help set up a planned 10 billion-
shilling property fund. British American said it would provide
1.5 billion shillings for the fund and raise 8.5 billion
shillings from investors.  The company is expected to announce earnings Aug. 2.  To contact the reporter on this story:
