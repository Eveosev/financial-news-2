Spain ’s government bonds rose for a
fourth day on speculation euro-region policy makers will resume
purchases of so-called peripheral debt to help contain surging
borrowing costs and ease the debt crisis.  German  two-year yields  dropped to a record after a report
showed euro-area confidence worsened in July, underpinning
demand for safer assets. Italian bonds fell as the nation sold
5.48 billion euros ($6.71 billion) of notes. European Central
Bank President  Mario Draghi , who last week pledged to do
whatever it takes to preserve the euro, is trying to build
consensus for a plan to contain borrowing costs in Spain and
Italy before policy makers meet on Aug. 2.  “The main driver of Spanish and Italian bonds is the hope
that we will see some concerted action” to help stem the debt
crisis, said  Christoph Rieger , head of interest-rate strategy at
Commerzbank AG in  Frankfurt . “The risk is high that these hopes
will be disappointed. We may not get all the details this week
and so the market will probably remain volatile.”  Spain’s 10-year  bond yield  fell 13 basis points, or 0.13
percentage point, to 6.61 percent at 5 p.m. London time, after
dropping 52 basis points last week. The 5.85 percent bond due
January 2022 rose 0.86, or 8.60 euros per 1,000-euro face
amount, to 94.69. The yield climbed to a euro-era record 7.751
percent on July 25.  Draghi’s Approach  Berlin, Paris and  Rome  have already endorsed Draghi’s
approach, echoing his language in saying they will do what’s
needed to protect the euro. Draghi meets with U.S. Treasury
Secretary  Timothy Geithner  in Frankfurt this evening and is also
attempting to win over Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann, a
critic of ECB bond purchases.  “If it’s just the ECB reactivating bond purchases as we
saw previously, then I think the market will actually be
disappointed because the previous efforts” using the Securities
Markets Program were insufficient,  Charles Diebel , head of
market strategy at Lloyds Banking Group Plc in London, said in
an interview on Bloomberg Television’s “The Pulse” with
Caroline Hyde. “It needs to be more than that and I think
probably policy makers are aware of that.”  Spanish 10-year yields have dropped more than 1 percentage
point since Draghi’s pledge to preserve the common currency last
week. The decrease in rates has wiped more than 12 billion euros
from Spain’s borrowing costs according to implied interest
payments calculated by Rabobank.  The euro has strengthened 0.7 percent from its July 25
closing price to $1.2247, and the  Stoxx Europe 600 Index (SXXP)  of
shares has jumped 5.4 percent.  Italian Sale  Italy sold 5.48 billion euros of debt due between 2015 and
2022, near its maximum target of 5.5 billion euros.  The Treasury priced the 10-year bonds to yield 5.96
percent, versus 6.19 percent on June 28. The sale attracted bids
for 1.29 times the amount on offer, compared with bid-to-cover
ratio of 1.28 percent at the prior auction. The average yield at
the five-year sale was 5.29 percent, versus 5.84 percent last
month. Italy also sold 2015 notes at a yield of 4.49.  “The relatively low bid-to-cover ratios remain a sign that
dealers are extremely suspicious on the recent tightening of EMU
periphery’s spreads,” Annalisa Piazza, a fixed-income analyst
at Newedge Group in  London , wrote in an e-mailed note. “The ECB
meeting is a few days away and market participants are still
reluctant on the possible outcome of the meeting and they seem
to be concerned about a possible disappointment.”  German Notes  Italy’s 10-year bond yield increased seven basis points to
6.03 percent after climbing to 6.71 percent on July 25, the
highest level since Jan. 16.  The German two-year yield dropped five basis points to
minus 0.08 percent after declining to minus 0.096 percent, the
lowest since Bloomberg began collecting the data in 1990. The
rate was negative for a 17th day, meaning investors who hold the
debt to maturity will receive less than they paid to buy them.  An index of executive and consumer sentiment in 17-nation
euro area worsened to 87.9 this month from 89.9 in June, the
European Commission said in Brussels. That’s the lowest since
September 2009. Economists forecast a drop to 88.9, according to
a Bloomberg News survey.  German bonds returned 3.3 percent this year, according to
indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European Federation of
Financial Analysts Societies. Spanish securities lost 5.1
percent, and  Italy ’s debt rose 8.1 percent.  Volatility on Spanish bonds was the highest in euro-area
markets today, followed by Ireland and  Greece , according to
measures of 10-year or similar-maturity debt, the spread between
two-year and 10-year securities and credit-default swaps.  Irish bonds due October 2020 rose for a third day, pushing
the yield down 10 basis points to 6.14 percent. Greek 10-year
securities also advanced, with the rate dropping 116 basis
points to 25.57 percent. The price jumped to 18.275 percent of
face value.  To contact the reporters on this story:
