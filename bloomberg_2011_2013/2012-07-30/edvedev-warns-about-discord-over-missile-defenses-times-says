Failure by  Russia  and the U.S. to
agree on a missile-defense shield in Europe by 2018 may lead to
a new arms race, Russian Prime Minister  Dmitry Medvedev  said in
a July 28 interview with the London-based Times to which
journalists were given access before today’s publication.  European leaders said privately that while they had no need
for missiles to be stationed in their countries, they were under
pressure from the U.S. as “senior partners,” according to the
interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
