Hitachi Ltd. (6501) ,  Japan ’s second-biggest
manufacturer, more than doubled profit in the first quarter as
it benefited from a rebound in global car parts demand and
spending on recovery from the 2011 earthquake.  Net income gained to 7 billion yen ($89 million) in the
three months ended June 30, from 2.9 billion yen a year earlier,
the Tokyo-based maker of electric power generation gear, auto
parts and electronics, said in a statement today.  Hitachi, which sold its stake in Elpida Memory Inc. in
March after divesting its hard-drive business last year, said
the company was supported by higher public works spending to
help reconstruction after the magnitude 9 earthquake and ensuing
tsunami on March 11, 2011, according to the statement. Exports
“struggled” as global economic growth slowed and the yen
appreciated, it said.  The maker of nuclear reactors, train cars and air-
conditioners, last week won a 4.5 billion pound ($7 billion)
U.K. train order along with John Laing.  Hitachi rose 0.4 percent to 456 yen at the close of trading
on the Tokyo Stock Exchange today. The shares have advanced 13
percent this year, compared with a 2.1 percent increase in the
benchmark Nikkei 225 Stock Average.  Operating profit gained to 63.6 billion yen in the first
quarter from 52.4 billion yen a year earlier, according to the
statement.  Profit from power systems, which accounted for about 35
percent of revenue last fiscal year, was 2.4 billion yen in the
quarter, while sales rose 15 percent to 190.5 billion yen. A
decline in sales of nuclear power generation systems was offset
by stronger performance in thermal power gear, the company said.  The company left its forecast for full-year net income
unchanged at 200 billion yen.  To contact the reporter on this story:
