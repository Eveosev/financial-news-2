Lebanon’s state-run electricity
provider will consider itself “forcibly closed” until contract
workers who have occupied the premises vacate it, the company
said in a statement on the official National News Agency.  Electricite du Liban said the measure will lead to a power
blackout throughout Lebanon within the next few hours. The
workers, who have for months been demanding full employment,
have closed the company’s entrances and vowed to escalate the
situation until the Cabinet meets their demands. Most areas
across Lebanon have for years experienced power rationing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
