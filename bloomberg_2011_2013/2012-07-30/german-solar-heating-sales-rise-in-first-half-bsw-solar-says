Sales of solar-heating systems in
 Germany  expanded 0.8 percent in the first half as about 50,000
households installed units, the BSW-Solar industry group said.  At least 1.7 million buildings have systems installed, the
lobby said in an e-mailed statement. BSW-Solar sees sales
increasing this half as prices rise for oil and natural gas.  To contact the reporter on this story:
