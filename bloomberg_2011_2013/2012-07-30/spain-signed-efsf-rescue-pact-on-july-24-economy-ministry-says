Spain  signed a  memorandum of
understanding  with the European Financial Stability Facility on
July 24, a spokeswoman for the Spanish Economy Ministry said
today, asking not to be named in line with government policy.  The agreement clears the way for Spain to receive a 30
billion-euro ($36.7 billion) first installment of the rescue
package for its banking industry. The euro area has committed up
to 100 billion euros for Spain to recapitalize its banks.  The capital needs of Spanish lenders have been estimated at
51 billion euros to 62 billion euros, according to a July 12
 document  on the EFSFâ€™s website. The exact recapitalization needs
should be determined by the end of September, according to the
EFSF document.  To contact the reporters on this story:
