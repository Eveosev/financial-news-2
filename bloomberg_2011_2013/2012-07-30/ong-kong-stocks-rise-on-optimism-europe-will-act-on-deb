benchmark index gaining for a third day, as European Central
Bank President  Mario Draghi  sought consensus among policy makers

 Binay Chandgothia , a Hong Kong-based portfolio manager at
Principal Global Investors, which manages $250 billion globally,
told Bloomberg Television. “If they come out and reinforce what
they said last week, it might bring more confidence back into
the markets.”  The Hang Seng Index advanced 1.6 percent to 19,585.40 at
the close of trading in  Hong Kong , with all but four shares
gaining. The gauge rose 2 percent on July 27, its biggest
advance in almost a month, after Draghi said policy makers will
do whatever is needed to preserve the 17-nation euro.  Leaders in Berlin, Paris and Rome have backed Draghi’s
approach to combat the sovereign-debt crisis before ECB policy
makers convene on Aug. 2.  Political Backing  “There is a strong political and financial will for the
euro,” said George Boubouras, Melbourne-based head of
investment strategy at UBS AG’s Australian unit. The Swiss bank
has about $1.5 trillion in assets under management. “Actions
that address the EU challenges will create the opportunity for a
sustainable rally ahead.”  Companies that do business in Europe advanced. Hutchison

which operates a port in  Greece , increased 2.5 percent to
HK$10.68.  Esprit Holdings Ltd. (330) , a clothier that counts Europe as

futures advanced for a fifth day. Jiangxi Copper added 0.8
percent to HK$17.04. Cnooc Ltd., China’s biggest offshore oil
producer, climbed 1.7 percent to HK$15.50.  The benchmark Hang Seng Index fell 9.7 percent from this
year’s high in February through today on signs Europe’s debt
crisis is worsening while growth slows in China and the U.S. The

estimated earnings on average, compared with 13.5 times for the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and 11 times for Stoxx Europe 600
Index.  Among stocks that fell today,  Guangzhou R&F (2777)  slipped 4.1
