Peruvian bonds rose amid speculation
annual inflation slowed this month, buoying demand for the
fixed-rate securities.  The yield on the nation’s 7.84 percent sol-denominated bond
due in August 2020 fell one basis point, or 0.01 percentage
point, to 4.66 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The price today rose 0.05 centimo to 120.96 centimos per sol.  “Increased demand for the local bonds from foreign
investors has helped the bonds rally,” said  Roberto Flores , the
head of research at Inteligo SAB, a Lima-based brokerage.
“Investors are taking advantage of the sol’s appreciation and
bets it will continue to gain.” Expectations annual inflation
will slow to within the central bank’s 1 percent to 3 percent
target by year-end is also helping demand, Flores said.  Annual inflation slowed to 3.35 percent in July from 4
percent in the previous month, according to the median estimate
of eight economists surveyed by Bloomberg. The national
statistics agency is slated to release the monthly report Aug.
1. Flores forecasts inflation will end this year at 3 percent.  The sol depreciated 0.1 percent to 2.6270 per  U.S. dollar ,
according to Deutsche Bank AG’s local unit. It has rallied 1.4
percent this month, the biggest gain among major Latin American
currencies after  Chile ’s peso.  The central bank said on its website that it didn’t buy
dollars in the  spot market  today. So far this month it has
purchased $745 million to slow the sol’s advance.  To contact the reporter on this story:
