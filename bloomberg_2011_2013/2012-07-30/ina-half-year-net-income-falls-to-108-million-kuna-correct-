(Corrects figure in headline.)  INA Industrija Nafte d.d. , the
Croatian refiner controlled by Hungary’s  Mol Nyrt. (MOL) , said half-
year net income fell 94 percent from a year earlier to 108
million kuna, the Zagreb-based company said in a statement
today.  Revenue fell to 14.5 billion kuna from a revised 14.7
billion kuna a year ago, while earnings before interest and tax,
depreciation and amortization was 2.2 billion kuna, the company
said.  “Ina achieved a positive result in the first half despite
the absence of income from Syria, and losses in natural-gas
sales due to regulatory constraints,” said Zoltan Aldott,
president of Ina’s management board, said in the statement
released through the Zagreb Stock Exchange. “Our aim for the
rest of the year is to start a strong investment cycle.”  The refiner pulled out of its profit-driving gas and oil
plant in  Syria  on Feb. 27 to comply with European Union policy
on the Middle Eastern country.  To contact the reporter on this story:
