Ivory Coast , the world’s biggest
cocoa producer, probably will increase processing of the beans
around the port of  San Pedro  by about 56 percent to more than
300,000 metric tons a year by 2015 as  Olam International Ltd. (OLAM) 
sets up a plant and existing factories expand output, Industry
Minister Moussa Dosso said.  Singapore-based commodity trader Olam will open a grinding
facility in the western port with a capacity of 120,000 tons a
year by the end of 2013, Dosso said in an interview on July 27.  “Ivory Coast will no longer satisfy itself with exporting
raw commodities,” Dosso said. “We’re going to boost
industrialization by setting up incentive conditions. After the
cocoa sector, from which we want to get more value-added, we’ll
focus on the cashew sector.”  Ivory Coast’s government wants to boost cocoa processing to
50 percent of its annual crop as part of the changes announced
last year, which include a plan to give farmers more money for
their beans. The policies were part of requirements to get $4.4
billion in debt relief from the  International Monetary Fund  and
the  World Bank .  San Pedro already has three cocoa-processing plants.
Zurich-based  Barry Callebaut AG (BARN) , the world’s biggest maker of
bulk chocolate, has a facility that grinds 145,000 tons of cocoa
while the Choco Ivoire factory processes 27,000 tons, Dosso
said. Ivorian grinder Sucso SA processes 20,000 tons. Choco
Ivoire and Sucso are also planning to extend their factories,
Dosso said.  Choco Ivoire wants to boost its grinding capacity to 60,000
tons within the next two years, company President Adnan Amer
said in an interview in San Pedro today. Sucso expects to
increase the processing capacity of its factory to 25,000 tons,
Chief Executive Officer Martial Yace said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
