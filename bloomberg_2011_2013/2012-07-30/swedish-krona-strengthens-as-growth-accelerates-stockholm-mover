Sweden ’s krona rose to the highest
level in more than two months against the dollar after a report
showed that economic growth unexpectedly accelerated in the
second quarter.  The krona rose as much as 0.61 percent against the dollar
to 6.8248, the highest level since May 8, and traded at 6.8356
as of 11:39 a.m. in  Stockholm . It advanced 0.9 percent versus
the euro to 8.3859 and was stronger against all the major
currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  Growth in Sweden’s gross domestic product accelerated to a
seasonally adjusted 1.4 percent in the second quarter from a
revised 0.9 percent in the first-quarter, according to
 Statistics Sweden . That beat an estimate of 0.2 percent growth
of 13 economists in a Bloomberg survey. Annual growth was 2.3
percent, up from 1.5 percent in the first quarter.  “This just gives the  currency market  more ammunition to
continue to buy the” krona,  Carl Hammer , chief foreign exchange
strategist at SEB AB, said by phone from Stockholm. “The trend
right now is that the krona will continue to appreciate. That
will mean import prices will go much lower, CPI will undershoot
the target and it will mean more Riksbank rate cuts
eventually.”  Policy makers at the Swedish Riksbank indicated in the
minutes of their July 3 meeting that they’re seeking to
reconcile an “unexpectedly strong development” of the local
economy” with “increased concern” about the euro area. The
central bank held its main rate at 1.5 percent, after two cuts
since December, and signaled it may ease once again by year-end.  To contact the reporter on this story:
