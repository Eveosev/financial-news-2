Egypt ’s former Interior Minister
Habib El-Adli, the long-time security chief of ex-President
 Hosni Mubarak , challenged a court ruling sentencing him to life
in prison for complicity in the deaths of protesters during last
year’s uprising, the official Middle East News Agency reported.  El-Adli’s lawyers said in the appeal submitted to the Court
of Cassation today that the June 2 sentence lacked proof of the
defendant’s intention to kill the demonstrators, according to
MENA. Attorneys for Mubarak, who faces the same punishment, are
also expected to challenge his sentence, the news agency said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
