Thessaloniki Port Authority SA (OLTH) ,
which operates  Greece â€™s second-biggest port, invited two
investors to submit binding bids in a tender to build and
operate an 11.3 million-euro ($13.9 million) marina.  Lamda Development SA (LAMDA)  and a joint venture led by Aktor SA
qualified for the second phase of bidding and can submit offers
by mid-October, the company said in an e-mailed statement today.  Three offers were made in the non-binding phase of the
tender for the 218-berth marina, which will take about three
years to build. The concession to run the facility will be for
at least 30 years and will help to boost tourism as well as
recreational and cultural activities at the port, according to
the port company.  Sales of stakes in listed companies, including Thessaloniki
and other ports, are part of a plan to sell Greek state assets.
The sales are among conditions agreed in return for bailout
funds from the European Union and the  International Monetary
Fund .  To contact the reporter on this story:
