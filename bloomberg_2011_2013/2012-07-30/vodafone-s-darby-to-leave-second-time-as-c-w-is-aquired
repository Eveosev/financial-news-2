Vodafone Group Plc (VOD)  said the current
chief executive officer of  Cable & Wireless  Worldwide Plc will
leave following completion of the unit’s 1.04 billion-pound
($1.6 billion) takeover.  Gavin Darby, a Vodafone executive before he joined Cable &
Wireless in 2011, will leave the company at the end of October,
Newbury, England-based Vodafone said today in a statement. Nick
Jeffery, who runs Vodafone’s enterprise unit, will take the
Cable & Wireless post immediately.  Vodafone’s purchase of Cable & Wireless took effect today,
giving the world’s second-biggest mobile-phone company a U.K.
fiber-optic network to boost its own fixed-line system and
relieve the strain of surging data traffic on its wireless
network. After initially keeping London-based Cable & Wireless
separate, Jeffery will oversee the move to combine the networks.  Darby’s career at Vodafone included positions as U.K. CEO
and head of some of its overseas units, including the U.S. He
will remain with Vodafone to “ensure a smooth transition”
until his departure, the company said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
