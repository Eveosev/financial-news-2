Russia’s position on Syria is based
on its experiences from last year’s conflict in Libya, Prime
Minister  Dmitry Medvedev  told the Times of London.  “When everything began in Syria, I said that in light of
what happened in Libya, our approach will be different,”
Medvedev told the newspaper. Reporters from other news media
were allowed to listen to the July 28 interview before
publication.  Russia assumed that backing a particular resolution would
provide the opportunity for all countries to discuss the
situation, negotiate and at the same time send a “clear
signal” to the now toppled Libyan government of  Muammar
Qaddafi , Medvedev said.  “Unfortunately it ended as it ended,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
