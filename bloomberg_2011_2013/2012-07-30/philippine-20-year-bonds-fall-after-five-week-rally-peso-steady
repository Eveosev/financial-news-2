Philippine 20-year bonds fell,
following a run of five weekly gains, amid speculation some
investors are taking profits on their holdings before month-end.
The peso weakened.  The yield on sovereign notes due March 2032 dropped 29
basis points in July as data showed  inflation  slowed for a third
month to 2.8 percent in June. The central bank lowered its
overnight borrowing rate for the third time this year on July
26, cutting it to a record-low 3.75 percent from 4 percent.  “We’re expecting local bond yields to trade with an upward
bias of five to seven points for the week,” said Jill Singian,
a portfolio manager at  Bank of the Philippine Islands (BPI)  in  Manila 
. “Yields have trended lower in the past weeks so dealers would
like to lock in some gains. It doesn’t change the fundamental
outlook or positive sentiment.”  The yield on the Philippines’ 5.875 percent bonds due March
2032 increased six basis points, or 0.06 percentage point, to
5.625 percent as of 4:04 p.m. in Manila, according to prices
from Tradition Financial Services. The rate reached 5.565
percent on July 27, the lowest since the notes were issued in
March this year.  The peso closed at 41.93 per dollar in Manila, compared
with 41.91 at the end of last week, according to Tullett Prebon
Plc. The currency has strengthened 0.3 percent this month.  Inflation will settle within the lower half of the central
bank’s 3 percent to 5 percent target range in 2012 and 2013,
Governor Amando Tetangco said last week.  Philippine bonds have returned 15 percent in the past year,
a performance second only to  Indonesia  in  Asia ’s 10 biggest
economies excluding  Japan , HSBC Holdings Plc local-currency bond
indexes show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
