U.S. sanctions against  Iran  aim to
create a rift between the government and the population and
topple the Islamic Republic, said Ahmad-Reza Pourdastan,
commander of the army’s ground forces, according to  Mehr .  “The enemy seeks to distance people from the ruling
system,” the state-run  news agency  cited Pourdastan as saying.
“They have increased measures against our country, are talking
about crippling sanctions, and with this are seeking to topple
the regime.”  The U.S. and the European Union have imposed trade and
financial sanctions against Iran over its nuclear work, which
they say is aimed at developing atomic weapons. Iran denies the
allegation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
