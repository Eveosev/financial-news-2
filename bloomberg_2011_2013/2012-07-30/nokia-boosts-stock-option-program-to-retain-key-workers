Nokia Oyj (NOK1V) , the mobile-phone maker
struggling to stem losses amid plunging sales, boosted its
stock-option program in a bid to retain employees critical to
its turnaround effort.  Nokia, which reported its fifth straight quarterly loss on
July 19, will grant additional options to “key senior level
employees,” though not for Chief Executive Officer Stephen Elop
or his team of top executives, according to a statement from the
Espoo, Finland-based company today. The move increases the
number of options Nokia plans to issue under its 2012 program to
11.5 million from 8.5 million.  The company, whose debt is ranked  junk  at the three largest
rating companies, has announced more than 20,000 job cuts and
shuttered production and research sites as it tries to offset
declining revenue. Elop is betting on the Lumia smartphone
running Microsoft Corp. software to halt gains by  Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s
iPhone and handsets using Google Inc.’s Android software.  Nokia reported a second-quarter operating loss at its
handset division, excluding some items, equivalent to 9.1
percent of revenue and forecast similar losses for the current
period. Its shares have lost more than half of their value this
year, leaving them near the lowest level since the mid-1990s.  The stock added 3.2 percent to 1.80 euros at 1:59 p.m.
