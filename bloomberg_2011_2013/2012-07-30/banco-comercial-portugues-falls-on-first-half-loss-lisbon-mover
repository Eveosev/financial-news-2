Banco Comercial Portugues SA (BCP) ,
Portugal’s second-biggest bank, fell to the lowest in a week in
Lisbon trading after posting a loss on impairments related to
the sovereign-debt crisis.  The stock fell as much as 3.2 percent to 9 euro cents, the
lowest since July 23, and was down 1.1 percent to 9.2 cents at
9:43 a.m. in the Portuguese capital, giving the lender a market
value of 693 million euros ($850 million).  “Banco Comercial’s reaction in today’s session is related
to the negative results announced on Friday,” said  Pedro Oliveira , a trader at Go Bulling in Lisbon.  The lender posted a first-half loss of 544.3 million euros
after the close of trading on July 27, compared with net income
of 114.3 million euros in the same period a year earlier. The
bank said the results were affected by impairments for estimated
losses of 450 million euros related to the economic and
financial situation in Greece.  Shares of other Portuguese banks rose.  Banco Espirito Santo
SA (BES)  gained 0.6 percent to 49.8 cents, and  Banco BPI SA (BPI)  increased
1 percent to 50.5 cents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
