Italyâ€™s borrowing costs dropped at
an auction of five-year and ten-year debt on speculation the
 European Central Bank  may move toward a new round of
bond purchases to ease borrowing costs in the country and in
 Spain .  Italy sold 4.73 billion euros ($5.8 billion) of five- and
10-year bonds. The Rome-based Treasury priced the 10-year debt
to yield 5.96 percent, down from 6.19 percent on June 28. The
Treasury priced its five-year bond to yield 5.29 percent,
compared with 5.84 percent last month.  Italy also sold 750 million euros of a 3% 2015 bond to
yield 4.49, bringing the total amount sold at 5.48 billion-
euros, near the 5.5 billion euros that was the maximum target
for the auction.   To contact the reporter on this story:
