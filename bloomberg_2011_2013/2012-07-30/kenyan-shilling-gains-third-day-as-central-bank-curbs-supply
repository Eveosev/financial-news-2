Kenya’s shilling gained for the
third day, the longest winning streak in over two weeks as the
central bank boosted by threefold the amount of currency it
withdraws from the market using  repurchase agreements  and term-
auction deposits.  The currency of East Africa’s largest economy appreciated
0.9 percent to 83.49 a dollar in Nairobi the capital, having
advanced as much as 1 percent to 83.41 per dollar earlier.  The Central Bank of Kenya accepted about 9 billion
shillings ($108 million) of repurchase agreements and term-
auction deposits today, compared with 3 billion shillings
accepted July 27, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “The shilling has been stable, propped up by the central
bank’s tight monetary stance,” Nairobi-based  NIC Bank Ltd. (NICB)  said
a note to clients today.  The Tanzanian shilling gained 0.5 percent to close at
1,576.50 per dollar the highest since July 2, while  Uganda ’s
shilling closed unchanged at 2,477.50 versus the U.S. currency.  To contact the reporter on this story:
