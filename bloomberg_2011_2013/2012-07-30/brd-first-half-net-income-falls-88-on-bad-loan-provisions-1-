BRD-Groupe Societe Generale SA (BRD) ,
 Romania ’s second-largest bank, said its first-half profit fell
88 percent as bad-loan provisions rose during the country’s
recession.  Net income dropped to 39.4 million lei ($10.5 million) from
322.6 million lei a year earlier, the bank said in a regulatory
statement today. Bad-loan costs grew 61 percent to 715 million
lei in the first half.  “The net income in the first half was affected by a higher
net risk cost,” the Bucharest-based bank said.  Romanian banks, which posted a second consecutive year of
combined losses in 2011, have been struggling since 2009 to cut
rising bad-loan costs as a second recession in three years in
the Balkan country made it difficult for citizens and companies
to repay loans.  To contact the reporter on this story:
