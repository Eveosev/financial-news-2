Urbi Desarrollos Urbanos SAB (URBI*) ,
 Mexico ’s third-largest homebuilder by sales, plunged to a record
low after reporting a loss and forecasting neutral cash flow for
the next six quarters.  Shares fell 22 percent to 8.92 pesos at the close of
trading in Mexico City, the lowest level since the company
started trading in 2004. The stock is down 44 percent this year.  Urbi posted a second-quarter loss of 125 million pesos
($9.4 million), according to a July 27 statement. The company
projected no increase to free cash flow for the next six
quarters as it shifts toward constructing apartment buildings,
which require larger initial investments, to take advantage of
government subsidies.  “From the second half of 2013, we hope the company will
begin gradual growth of free  cash flow  through the end of
2015,” Urbi wrote in the filing.  Mexican homebuilders have been stepping up construction of
apartments under a government program designed to provide
housing for about 8.9 million families without homes or living
in substandard dwellings.  For Urbi, “it’s not possible to grow quickly and have free
cash flow,” Esteban Polidura, an analyst at Deutsche Bank AG in
Mexico City, said in a telephone interview. Polidura cut the
stock to the equivalent of sell and reduced his 12-month price
target on the shares 28 percent to 13 pesos.  Urbi also was cut to the equivalent of sell at Scotia
Capital, Banco BTG Pactual, and HSBC Plc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
