Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) ,
 Switzerland ’s second-biggest bank, said 97 percent of
subscription rights for 1.9 billion francs ($1.94 billion) in
mandatory convertible bonds were exercised by shareholders.  The remaining 64 million francs of notes were placed with
strategic investors, the Zurich-based bank said in a statement
today. The subscription period for the notes ended on July 27.  “The high take-up is a significant vote of confidence from
both our new and existing investors,” Chief Executive Officer
 Brady Dougan  said in the statement.  Credit Suisse said July 18 it plans to boost capital by
15.3 billion francs this year, including 3.8 billion francs
through bonds that will convert into 234 million shares in March
at the price of 16.29 francs a share.  Credit Suisse  rose  28 centimes, or 1.7 percent, to 17.03
francs by 9:20 a.m. in Swiss trading. The shares are down 23
percent so far in 2012.  Half of the notes, carrying a 4 percent coupon, were
purchased by strategic investors including Qatar Holding LLC,
Olayan Group, BlackRock Investment Management, Norges Bank
Investment Management, Capital Research Global Investors and
Temasek Holdings Pte Ltd. The investors also agreed to buy any
of the remaining bonds not taken up by other shareholders.  To contact the reporters on this story:
