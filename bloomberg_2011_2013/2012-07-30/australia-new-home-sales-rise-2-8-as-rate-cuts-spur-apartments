Australian sales of newly built
homes rose in June for a third straight month as interest-rate
reductions helped spur apartment purchases, a private report
showed.  Sales increased 2.8 percent to 6,021 last month from May,
when they gained 0.7 percent, the Canberra-based Housing
Industry Association said, citing a survey of the nation’s
largest builders. Detached house sales rose 0.7 percent, while
apartments soared 15.7 percent, it said.  The  Reserve Bank  of Australia cut the benchmark rate by 50
basis points late last year and a further 75 points in May and
June as inflation remained contained and the savings rate stayed
above 9 percent. At 3.5 percent, the overnight cash rate target
is still the highest among major developed economies.  “Lower  interest rates  will assist new housing in 2012/13,
but the large gap between the cash rate and variable  mortgage
rates  will blunt their positive impact,”  Harley Dale , HIA chief
economist, said in a statement.  Australian house prices probably declined in the three
months through June, extending the longest losing streak in at
least a decade. An index measuring prices for established houses
in eight major cities likely dropped 0.5 percent last quarter
from the previous three months, and were down 4.2 percent from a
year earlier, a survey of economists showed before an Aug. 1
government report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
