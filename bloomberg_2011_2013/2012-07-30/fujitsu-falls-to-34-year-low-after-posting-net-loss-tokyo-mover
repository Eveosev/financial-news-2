Fujitsu Ltd. (6702) ,  Japan ’s biggest
provider of computer services, fell to the lowest level in
almost 34 years in Tokyo trading after posting a wider-than-
estimated first-quarter loss.  Fujitsu dropped 12 percent to close at 295 yen, the lowest
level since September 1978, on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Japan’s
benchmark Nikkei 225 Stock Average rose 0.8 percent.  The maker of the K super computer was hurt by falling
overseas  sales  in its solutions business, which includes
servers, because of a worsening economy in  Europe  and a slowdown
in the U.S., Fujitsu said July 27 after the market’s close. The
Tokyo-based company also said it had an operating loss of 3.6
billion yen ($46 million) in the devices business on reduced
demand for its system chips used in televisions and servers.  “There is a risk of worsening profitability from
services,” Hideyuki Maekawa, a Tokyo-based analyst at Credit
Suisse Group AG, said a note to clients today. “We are
concerned about the lack of transparency on how the company will
reduce losses in its hardware business.  Fujitsu  reported  a net loss of 23.8 billion yen for the
three months ended June 30. The company was expected to post a
loss of 12.4 billion yen, according to the average of five
analysts’  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg. The company’s
operating loss, or revenue minus the cost of good sold and
administrative expenses, totaled 25 billion yen, and sales fell
2.9 percent to 957.4 billion yen.  To contact the reporter on this story:
