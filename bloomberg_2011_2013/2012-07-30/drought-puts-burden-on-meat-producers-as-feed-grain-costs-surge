The U.S. Midwest drought that sent
corn prices to a record is devastating cattle, hog and poultry
producers forced to pay more for feed, signaling higher meat
costs for consumers, industry groups said today.  Consumers may buy less meat as prices rise, John Burkel,
the vice chairman of the National Turkey Federation and a
Minnesota turkey grower, said on a media conference call. Stores
are less likely to offer cheap turkeys during Thanksgiving this
year, he said.  Livestock producers urged the Obama administration to
suspend the nation’s renewable-fuels standard, saying that
demand for corn used to make ethanol is reducing available
supplies for  food production . It’s “time to wean” the ethanol
industry off government mandates, J.D. Alexander, the president
of the  National Cattlemen’s Beef Association  and a Nebraska
rancher, said on the media conference call.  To contact the reporter on this story:
