Gem Diamonds Ltd. (GEMD) , a producer of the
stones in  Lesotho  and Australia, said it may delay expansion
projects in Africa as prices for the precious stones fall.  “In light of continued economic uncertainty, the directors
have initiated a review of the company’s capital investment
plans,” Gem said today in a statement. “The review will focus
on potentially extending the period over which capital is
expended on its two development projects.”  Gem Diamonds is still planning to double production at its
Letseng mine in Lesotho and develop the Ghaghoo mine in
Botswana, according to the statement. The company said it may
delay spending to guard against a “further deterioration in
market conditions.”  Rough diamond prices fell 13 percent in the second quarter
as Asian consumption slowed and demand waned on the euro-zone
debt crisis, according to data compiled by WWW International
Diamond Consultants Ltd. Prices have risen by more than 20
percent in each of the past three years as producers struggled
to keep pace with demand.  Gem produced 57,116 carats at the Letseng mine in the first
six months of the year and 78,881 carats at its Ellendale mine
in  Australia .  Gem Diamonds rose 0.9 percent to 194.8 pence by 9:15 a.m.
