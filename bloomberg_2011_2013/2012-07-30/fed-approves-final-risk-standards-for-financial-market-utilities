The  Federal Reserve  approved a final
rule setting risk management standards for transaction
processing systems including central counterparties, payments
systems and central securities depositories.  The final rule, focused on firms that clear and settle
trades, is “substantively similar” to the proposed version
except for a provision that lets the Fed waive standards for
some financial market utilities, the central bank said in a
statement today.  The regulations for financial market utilities, mandated
under the Dodd-Frank Act regulatory overhaul, set risk-
management standards for payment, clearing, and settlement
activities, except clearing firms designated by the Securities
and Exchange Commission or Commodity Futures Trading Commission.  To contact the reporter on this story:
