California will borrow an estimated
$10 billion from  Wall Street  the week of Aug. 13, money the most
indebted U.S. state will use to pay its bills for the rest of
the year, Treasurer Bill Lockyer said.  Lockyer’s office will first offer the revenue anticipation
notes to individual investors for two days beginning Aug. 14,
said his spokeman  Tom Dresslar . The state will complete the sale
Aug. 16 when institutions such as money-market funds can order.  State and local governments typically sell short-term notes
to bolster cash flow until tax receipts increase later in the
year. A $10 billion sale would be California’s largest since
2010. In September, the biggest state by population borrowed
$5.4 billion and had to seek another $1 billion in February this
year after tax collections fell short and spending exceeded
expectations.  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  and  Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC)  will be joint
senior managers and Los Angeles-based bond firm De La Rosa & Co.
will co-manage the sale, Lockyer has said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
