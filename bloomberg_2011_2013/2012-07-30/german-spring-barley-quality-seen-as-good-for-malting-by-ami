German spring barley that’s been
harvested to date is of good quality and the grain’s protein
content makes it suitable for producing malt, market researcher
Agrarmarkt Informations GmbH reported.  Protein content in the harvested barley ranges from 9
percent to 11.5 percent, and the share of grains over 2.5
millimeters (0.1 inch) is 95 percent to 97 percent, Bonn-based
AMI wrote in a  report  on its website today.  “With these values, utilization for malt production is
guaranteed,” AMI wrote.  Barley can be turned into malt by germinating and drying,
with maltsters setting limits on protein content and grain size
to better control the malting process. The malted grain is used
to make beer and whiskey.  The NYSE Liffe malting-barley contract traded in Paris
calls for maximum protein content of 11.5 percent, and for at
least 90 percent of the grain to be over 2.5 millimeters.  Spring barley yields range from 6.5 metric tons to 8.5 tons
per hectare (2.47 acres), AMI wrote.  Average farm-gate prices for malting-barley in  Germany  are
quoted at 225 euros ($276) a ton, and the price for delivery in
the Upper Rhine region in October is around 270 euros a ton
including freight, according to AMI.  To contact the reporter on this story:
