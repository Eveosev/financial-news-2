JA Solar Holdings Co., the biggest
maker of photovoltaic cells, will take control of a company
making solar-grade mono-cystalline silicon ingots from
polysilicon maker M.Setek Co. to settle a dispute.  JA Solar said its unit in  Hong Kong  will pay M.Setek 247
million  yuan  ($38.9 million) for its 65 percent stake in Hebei
Ningjin Songgong Semiconductor Co. The transaction is due to
close at the end of this year and requires clearance from the
government and anti-monopoly regulators.  The transaction is part of an effort to settle a dispute
that arose after the 2011 earthquake in Japan, when M.Setekâ€™s
polysilicon plant there was unable to supply the raw material to
JA Solar.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
