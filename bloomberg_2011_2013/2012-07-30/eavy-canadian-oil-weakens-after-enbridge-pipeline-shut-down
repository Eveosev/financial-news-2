Heavy Canadian oil weakened after
 Enbridge Inc. (ENB)  shut a  Wisconsin  pipeline that helps move  Alberta 
crude to U.S. refiners.  The Calgary-based pipeline operator shut Line 14, which
runs from Superior, Wisconsin to the Griffith-Hartsdale area in
 Indiana , after a July 27 leak. The 317,600-barrel-a-day pipe
spilled an estimated 1,200 barrels of oil.  A new section of the line was tentatively scheduled to be
installed today,  Graham White , an Enbridge spokesman based in
Calgary, said in an e-mail.  Western Canada Select’s discount widened $1.50 to $21.50 a
barrel below West Texas Intermediate at 12:21 p.m. in  New York ,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Syncrude added 25 cents to a discount of $3 versus the U.S.
benchmark. Syncrude is a synthetic oil upgraded from tar-like
bitumen in Alberta into refinery-ready crude.  Bakken oil’s discount to WTI narrowed 75 cents to $4 a
barrel.  On the U.S. Gulf Coast, sweet oil premiums widened against
WTI. Heavy Louisiana Sweet’s premium to the U.S. benchmark added
20 cents to $17 a barrel while Light Louisiana Sweet’s increased
30 cents to $17.30.  Poseidon’s premium was unchanged at $11.60 and Southern
Green Canyon held at $10.50 a barrel over WTI. Mars Blend
increased 25 cents to $12.10 a barrel over the U.S. benchmark.  The premium for  Thunder Horse , a sour crude with lower
sulfur content than Mars, Poseidon and Southern Green Canyon,
increased 25 cents a barrel to $15.75.  To contact the reporter on this story:
