European stock futures rose,
indicating the region’s equities will climb for a third day,
amid optimism the  European Central Bank  will win support from
policy makers to take steps to ease the euro area’s debt crisis.
U.S. index futures fell, while Asian shares advanced.  Air France-KLM (AF)  Group may be active after it posted a
narrower second-quarter loss. Ryanair Holdings Plc might move
after saying fiscal first-quarter earnings tumbled as fuel costs
increased.  Stagecoach Group Plc (SGC)  may advance after the stock was
upgraded at HSBC Holdings Plc.  Futures on the Euro Stoxx 50 Index expiring in September
gained 1 percent to 2,318 at 7:11 a.m. in London, while FTSE 100
Index futures increased 0.4 percent. Contracts on the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index declined 0.3 percent, while the MSCI Asia
Pacific Index jumped 1 percent.  “Speculation has intensified as to what we’ll hear from
the European Central Bank,” Cameron Peacock, a market analyst
at IG Markets in  Melbourne , wrote in an e-mail to clients. “A
rate cut, a resumption of bond purchases and a new long-term
refinancing operation are just some of the measures supposedly
being considered.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
