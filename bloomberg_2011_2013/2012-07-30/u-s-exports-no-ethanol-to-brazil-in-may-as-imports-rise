The U.S. halted ethanol exports to
Brazil in May as imports of the biofuel from the South American
country surged 55 percent, Energy Department  data  show.  The lack of shipments to Brazil helped trim total U.S.
exports by 21 percent in May from April. U.S. exports to
countries including  Canada ,  Finland  and the U.K. dropped to 1.4
million barrels from 1.78 million in April, the department said
today in its Petroleum Supply Monthly report. Exports are down
by a fifth from a year earlier.  Brazilian ethanol has become cheaper than the U.S. variety
as the country uses sugar to make the biofuel and lowers the
blend of the additive in its fuel supply. Sugar prices have
fallen 2.2 percent this year. In August, the government cut the
ethanol mix in gasoline to 20 percent from 25 percent.  “ Brazil  was just starting to get their cane harvest
together,” said Jerrod Kitt, an analyst at Linn Group in
 Chicago . “As this picks up steam, you’re going to see more and
more” ethanol imports.  It was the first time the U.S. didn’t ship ethanol to
Brazil since August 2011. Exports to Brazil were 137,000 barrels
in April.  U.S. Imports  The U.S.  imported  384,000 barrels of ethanol in May, 91
percent of which came from Brazil. That’s the largest amount of
the biofuel brought in from the South American country since
December. There were no deliveries of the additive from Brazil a
year ago.  “You’re going from a net exporter to a net importer,”
Kitt said.  Anhydrous ethanol in  Sao Paulo  fetched $2.39 a gallon as of
July 20 and hydrous ethanol, used in flex fuel cars, cost $1.97,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Denatured ethanol for August delivery rose 5.8 cents, or
2.3 percent, to settle at $2.613 a gallon on the Chicago Board
of Trade. Futures have jumped 19 percent this year, spurred by
more expensive production costs because of record corn prices.  Ethanol  production  in the U.S. fell 17 percent to 796,000
barrels a day in the week ended July 20 from a record 963,000 on
Dec. 30, according to Energy Department data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
