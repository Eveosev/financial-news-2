China Cosco Holdings Company Ltd. (1919) ,
the country’s largest listed shipping company, fell to a nine-
month low in  Hong Kong  after saying preliminary first-half loss
widened more than 50 percent as a ship glut weakened rates.  The fleet operator  dropped  3.7 percent to HK$3.17, the
lowest since Oct. 10, at the close of trading in the city. The
company has slumped 42 percent over the past year, compared with
a 13 percent drop in the benchmark  Hang Seng Index .  Slowing global economic growth, including in China, and
fuel costs that have remained high contributed to the record
expansion of losses, China Cosco said in a statement to the Hong
Kong Stock Exchange on Friday after the market closed. Losses
will widen by half from the 2.8 billion yuan ($439 million)
deficit for the six months ended June 30, 2011, according to the
preliminary earnings report.  “A weak dry-bulk market has been a major drag to China
Cosco since 2008,” Bonnie Chan and  Janet Lewis , analysts at
Macquarie Capital Securities Ltd., wrote in a July 27 note. “It
will take at least another two years for the dry-bulk market to
state a meaningful recovery from the current slump.”  The cost to ship Australian  iron ore  to China, the world’s
biggest route for dry-bulk commodities, on a Capesize vessel
reached a 17-month low on July 27 amid a shortage of cargoes of
the steelmaking raw material. Rates  fell 2.2 percent  to $6.44 a
metric ton, figures from the London-based Baltic Exchange
showed. That was the lowest level since Feb. 8, 2011, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  China Cosco, which made 48 percent of revenue from
container shipping last year, booked a full year loss of 10.5
billion  yuan  in 2011. Net loss will probably be 2.67 billion
yuan this year, according to the average of 10 analysts’
estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
