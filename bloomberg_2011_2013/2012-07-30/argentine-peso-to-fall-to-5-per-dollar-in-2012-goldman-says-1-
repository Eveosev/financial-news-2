The Argentine peso will drop to 5
per dollar by the end of this year and to at least 6 per dollar
by the end of 2013,  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  economist  Alberto Ramos  said in an e-mailed report.  Ramos ruled out a large, one-time devaluation and instead
said he expected the government to allow a faster monthly
depreciation of the currency, according to today’s report.  President  Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner  has tightened
controls on the exchange rate and forbidden most purchases of
foreign currencies in a bid to stem capital outflows, which
reached a record $21.5 billion last year. Confidence in the
government fell 7 percent in July for a second straight month,
according to a poll released on July 27 by the Buenos Aires-
based Torcuato Di Tella University.  “The forceful nature of the FX measures adopted by the
government and the underperformance of the economy have eroded
consumer and business confidence, triggered a run on private
sector dollar deposits and added extra pressure on the peso to
depreciate,” Ramos said in the report.  South America’s second-biggest economy, which expanded an
annual average of 7.8 percent from 2003 to 2011, will probably
 expand  less than 3 percent this year, Ramos said.  The peso has weakened 6 percent this year to 4.5738 per
dollar, the biggest drop after the Brazilian real, which fell
8.3 percent in the same period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
