(Corrects story published yesterday that summarized Sunday
Telegraph report incorrectly identifying Carlyle Group LP as the
owner of IMO.)  IMO Car Wash Ltd.  is close to
refinancing its leveraged loans in the  debt market , the company
said in an e-mailed statement.  IMO is pursuing a refinancing after it failed to reach an
agreement with TDR Capital LLP, according to a person with
knowledge of the deal, who asked not to be identified as the
negotiations were private. The London-based private-equity firm
was in exclusive talks to buy IMO after winning an auction run
by Rothschild, the person said.  The worldâ€™s largest car-wash company was taken over by its
lenders in 2009 after breaching terms on loans backing its 2006
buyout. It borrowed about 189 million pounds ($297 million) at
the time, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  TDR Capital did not immediately return a phone call seeking
comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
