OAO  VSMPO-Avisma Corp. (VSMO) , the largest
titanium producer, signed a memorandum of understanding with
Vietnam National Coal-Mineral Industries to develop output in
the Southeast Asian nation.  The companies are interested in setting up a joint venture
to make titanium products, VSMPO-Avisma said in a  statement  on
its website today. The terms of the deal will be discussed once
Vinacomin, as the Vietnamese mining company is known, gets a
license to develop titanium minerals in Binh Thuan province,
the Russian metals company said.  The signing was attended by Vietnamese President Truong Tan Sang, who is visiting Moscow, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
