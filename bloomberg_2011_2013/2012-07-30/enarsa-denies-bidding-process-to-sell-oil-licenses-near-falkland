Energia Argentina SA, the state-
owned company known as Enarsa, didnâ€™t initiate a bidding process
to offer licenses to explore for oil near the Falkland Islands,
the Planning Ministry said.  Enarsa is working on a strategic partnership with  YPF SA (YPF)  to
obtain cost savings regarding offshore exploration in the
continental platform, according to an e-mailed statement today
signed by Horacio Mizrahi, a spokesman for the Planning
Ministry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
