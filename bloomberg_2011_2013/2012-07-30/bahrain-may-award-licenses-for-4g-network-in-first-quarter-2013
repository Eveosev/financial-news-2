The Bahrain government may award as
many as two licenses for high-speed next-generation
telecommunications networks in the first quarter of 2013, the
 Telecommunications Regulatory Authority  said.  The government will ask new firms to bid if the current
three licensed companies in the kingdom prove insufficient to
provide fourth generation services, the Chairman of the
authority Mohammed al-Amer told a news conference late yesterday
in the capital city of Manama.  “We just hired a consultant to help us in the auctioning
process of the two licenses and we are still not decided if we
are going to award the two licenses or just one or if we are
going to give it to current operators or ask new ones to enter
the market,” al-Amer said. “Everything will be clear by early
next year.”  Al-Amer said that Bahraini government entities are using
the band frequencies for a high-speed Long Term Evolution
network, known as LTE, or 4G network. The authority was able to
free frequencies for the two upcoming licenses and wants to free
more for a higher speed network called LTE Advanced, he said.
The authority plans to award the license for this network within
two years, he said.  Bahrain’s telecommunication industry made about 402 million
dinars ($1.07 billion) in revenue last year compared with 360
million dinars a year earlier, with 40 percent coming from
mobile services, al-Amer said. The mobile service penetration in
Bahrain is 143 percent, meaning each person owns 1.5 mobile
phone lines, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
