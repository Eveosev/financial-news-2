South Korea’s won rose to a 12-week
high on speculation Europe’s policy makers will act to resolve
the region’s debt crisis.  Government bonds  advanced.  Germany and Italy’s leaders agreed the two countries “will
do everything to protect the euro area,” German government
spokesman Georg Streiter said yesterday. The  Federal Reserve ’s
policy makers meet this week amid speculation the central bank
will take additional measures to bolster the  U.S. economy . South
Korean manufacturers’ confidence index for August dropped to the
lowest level since May 2009, a report showed today, underscoring
the monetary authority’s July 12 decision to cut its benchmark
interest rate to boost growth.  “With developments in Europe and expectations ahead of the
Fed meeting, there’s risk-on sentiment in the market,” said Cho Young Bok, a currency trader at Daegu Bank in Seoul.  The won strengthened 0.1 percent to 1,137.60 per dollar at
the close in Seoul, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It
touched 1,132.45 earlier, the strongest since May 4, and trimmed
gains on speculation  South Korea ’s importers are buying the
dollar to settle bills. The currency’s one-month implied
volatility, a measure of exchange-rate swings used to price
options, slid 16 basis points, or 0.16 percentage point, to 7.82
percent. The  Kospi Index (KOSPI)  of stocks rose for a third day.  Government bonds advanced, reversing earlier losses. The
yield on the 3.25 percent bonds due June 2015 slid two basis
points to 2.85 percent, Korea Exchange Inc. prices show. Three-
year debt futures advanced 0.06 to 106 and the one-year
interest-rate swap rose four basis points to 2.89 percent.  “Overseas investors buying bond futures supported bonds,
and there were doubts whether European policy makers’ lip
service will turn into actual policies,” said Lee Gil Won, a
Seoul-based bond trader for  Shinhan Bank .  To contact the reporter on this story:
