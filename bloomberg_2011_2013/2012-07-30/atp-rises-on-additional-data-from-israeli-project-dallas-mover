ATP Oil & Gas Corp. (ATPG)  rose the most in
four weeks after a partner reported flow tests from an Israeli
natural-gas discovery announced earlier this month.  ATP, based in Houston, rose 7.9 percent to $1.51 at the
close in  New York , the biggest gain since July 2. The shares
have fallen 79 percent this year.  The Shimshon well off the coast of  Israel  was flowing at a
rate of 40.2 million cubic feet a day at the end of a 54-hour
test,  Isramco Negev 2 LP (ISRAL) , which has a 39 percent stake, said
today in a statement. ATP is the well operator with a 40 percent
interest. Isramco reported July 1 the field may hold 2.3
trillion cubic feet of gas.  “The company and its investors would be grasping on any
good news,” Oliver Corlett, a New York-based analyst for R.W.
Pressprich & Co. said today in a telephone interview. It remains
unclear whether the test is consistent with the company’s
estimate of the field’s size, he said.  Corlett rates ATP shares at market perform, the equivalent
of a hold, and doesn’t own any.  The shares fell 28 percent to $1.40 on July 27, after
Bloomberg News reported that bondholders are organizing in
anticipation of a potential bankruptcy, citing two people
familiar with the matter.  To contact the reporters on this story:
