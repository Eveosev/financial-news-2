The condition of the U.S.  corn crop 
worsened for an eighth straight week amid the worst Midwest
drought in a generation. Soybean ratings also fell.  About 24 percent of the corn was in good or excellent
condition as of yesterday, down from 26 percent a week earlier
and 77 percent in mid-May, the  U.S. Department of Agriculture 
said today in a  report . An estimated 29 percent of the soybeans
got the top ratings, down from 31 percent. Both crops are in the
worst shape for this time of year since a drought in 1988.  “The damage has been done to the corn crop,”  Peter Meyer ,
a senior director of agriculture commodities at PIRA Energy
Group in  New York , said by telephone today. “Now the weather is
starting to become more of a factor in the soybean markets.”  The worst of the drought occurred when corn plants were
going through the critical pollination stage last month.
Soybeans, which normally are planted later in the Midwest, are
just now entering reproductive stages, so they have more time to
grow.  Corn futures reached a record $8.1775 a bushel today on the
 Chicago  Board of Trade and have surged 28 percent this month.
Soybeans are up 15 percent in July. During the past week, little
or no rain fell in parts of  Iowa , Illinois and  Nebraska , the
largest corn-growing states,  National Weather Service  data show.  Smaller Harvests  A drought in 1988 led to a 31 percent drop in corn
production from a year earlier and a 20 percent decline for
soybeans, USDA data show. Corn output in Iowa, the biggest U.S.
grower, probably will fall 33 percent from 2011, Doane Advisory
Services Co. said last week after surveying crops. Soybean
output may drop to the lowest in nine years, Doane said.  Iowa farmers will harvest 1.58 billion bushels of corn,
down from 2.356 billion in 2011, and the smallest crop since
1995, senior economists at the St. Louis-based researcher said
last week after traveling 1,600 miles (2,574 kilometers)
measuring yield potential across four states the past four days.
Yields will plunge 32 percent to 117 bushels an acre from 172
bushels last year, the smallest since 1993.  The government’s crop-conditions report showed 63 percent
of  spring wheat , a high-protein variety used to make bread and
pasta, was rated good or excellent, up from 60 percent a week
earlier. As much as 3 inches of rain fell in  North Dakota , the
biggest U.S. wheat producer, in the past week, according to the
National Weather Service.  The winter-wheat harvest was 85 percent completed, compared
with 82 percent a week earlier, the USDA said. The average for
the previous five years was 81 percent.  About 44 percent of the  cotton  crop was rated good or
excellent, compared with 47 percent a week earlier. An estimated
70 percent of the rice crop got the top ranking, compared with
69 percent a week earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
