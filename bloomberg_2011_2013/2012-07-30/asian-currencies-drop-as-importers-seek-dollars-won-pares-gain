Asian currencies declined, led by
losses in India’s rupee and Thailand’s baht, on speculation
importers stepped up dollar purchases to pay month-end bills.  The rupee snapped a two-day advance ahead of the  Reserve
Bank  of India’s monetary policy review tomorrow, in which most
economists predict borrowing costs will be kept unchanged to
cool the fastest inflation among the biggest emerging economies.
The baht fell the most in a week, while South Korea’s won pared
gains that were built on reports Germany and Italy will take
steps to contain Europe’s debt crisis.  “We are seeing dollar purchases, possibly for month-end
payments,” said Naveen Raghuvanshi, a trader at  Development
Credit Bank Ltd. (DEVB)  in Mumbai. “Traders will be wary of adding
heavy positions ahead of the RBI review tomorrow.”  The rupee slid 0.3 percent to 55.496 per dollar as of 2:26
p.m. in Mumbai, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
baht fell 0.3 percent to 31.60, retreating from a three-week
hight and Indonesia’s rupiah weakened 0.1 percent to 9,478.  The Bloomberg-JPMorgan Asia Dollar Index, which tracks the
region’s currencies fell 0.13 percent, ending a three-day
advance. The index’s 60-day historical volatility was little
changed at 3.85 percent. Global funds have trimmed their net
stock holdings by $2.6 billion in Korea, Taiwan and Thailand

level since July 4, luring importers to buy the U.S. currency.
Thai imports climbed 2.6 percent in June from a year earlier,
while exports dropped 4.2 percent, official data showed July 25.  “Around 31.50 is a good level for importers,” said
Disawat Tiaowvanich, a foreign-exchange trader at  Bangkok Bank
Pcl. (BBL)  “We can also expect month-end dollar demand from
importers.”  The won gained 0.1 percent to 1,137.60 per dollar at the
close in Seoul, after rising as much as 0.5 percent to a 12-week
high on speculation policy makers in Europe and the U.S. will
unveil measures to boost growth. South Korean manufacturers’
confidence index for August dropped to the lowest level since
May 2009, a report showed today, underscoring the central bank’s
July 12 decision to cut its benchmark  interest rate  to boost
growth.  German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  and Italian Prime Minister
Mario Monti yesterday backed European Central Bank President
 Mario Draghi ’s approach to combat the sovereign debt crisis,
saying they will do what’s needed to protect the 17-nation euro.  Europe, Fed  “There were doubts whether European policy makers’ lip
service will turn into actual policies,” said Lee Gil Won, a
bond trader at  Shinhan Bank  in Seoul.  The  Federal Reserve  starts its two-day policy review
meeting tomorrow after a July 27 report showed growth in the
world’s largest economy slowed to a 1.5 percent annual rate last
quarter from 2 percent in the first three months of 2012.
Employers probably added 100,000 workers in July following an
80,000 gain in June, based on the median forecast in a Bloomberg
survey before a Labor Department report on Aug. 3.  Unemployment
rate  held at 8.2 percent, based on the responses.  “Fresh stimulus moves would help stabilize  emerging
markets  and economies and bring in more capital flows, boding
well for risk assets,” Credit Agricole CIB said in a research
note today.  China’s  yuan  rose 0.02 percent to 6.3794 per dollar in
