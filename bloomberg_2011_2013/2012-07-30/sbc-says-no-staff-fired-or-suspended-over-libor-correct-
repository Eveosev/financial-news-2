(Corrects second paragraph to specify that settlement talks
with regulators refer to money-laundering probe.)  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA)  said it has not
fired or suspended any staff following the probe into alleged
rigging of the London interbank offered rate.  It’s too early to estimate how much any settlement would
cost the bank, Chief Executive Officer Stuart Gulliver said on a
conference call with journalists today. HSBC also said it’s in
preliminary discussions with regulators about reaching a
settlement relating to allegations about money-laundering, he
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
