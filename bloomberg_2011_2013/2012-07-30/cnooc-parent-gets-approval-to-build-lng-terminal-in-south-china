China  National Offshore Oil Corp.
won government approval to build another liquefied natural gas
terminal in southern China’s Shenzhen amid increasing demand for
the cleaner-burning fuel.  The National Development and Reform Commission approved the
project in June with designed receiving capacity of 4 million
metric tons a year, NDRC  said  on its website today. The Diefu
facility, 70 percent owned by China National Offshore and the
remaining by Shenzhen Energy Corp., will comprise four LNG
storage tanks each with 160,000 cubic meters of capacity.  China is planning to triple the use of gas by 2020 to about
10 percent of total consumption to cut reliance on more
polluting coal and oil. LNG imports rose 29 percent in the first
half of 2012 from a year earlier to 6.7 million tons, data from
the Beijing-based General Administration of Customs showed.  China National Offshore already has an LNG terminal in
operation at Shenzhen’s Dapeng bay as well as one each in Fujian
and  Shanghai . The company is building several more along the
east and southern coast. The nation’s apparent natural-gas
consumption increased 16 percent in the first six months from a
year earlier, according to the NDRC.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
