The naira declined, paring its first
monthly gain in three against the dollar, as  Nigeria ’s benchmark
crude blend retreated.  The currency of  Africa ’s biggest oil producer, which has
risen 1.3 percent this month, slipped 0.2 percent to 160.925 per
dollar as of 12:10 p.m. in Lagos, the commercial capital. That
trims its monthly advance to 1.1 percent, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Nigerian benchmark Bonny Light crude, which has risen 8.4
percent this month, fell 0.3 percent today. The  Central Bank of
Nigeria , which uses twice-a-week foreign exchange auctions to
stabalize the currency, sold $517 million last week, the most in
three. The Abuja-based regulator is scheduled to sell dollars to
lenders today and on Wednesday.  “We have seen how the CBN’s game plan comes under pressure
when the oil price tumbles,” Gregory Kronsten, head of
macroeconomic research at FBN Capital Ltd. in  London , wrote in a
report today.  The central bank said July 24 it reduced the amount of
foreign exchange banks can hold as a percentage of their
shareholders’ funds to 1 percent from 3 percent and kept its
 interest rate  unchanged at 12 percent. The amount of cash as a
percentage of deposits that commercial banks must hold with the
central bank was increased to 12 percent from 8 percent.  The naira may weaken “following the post Monetary Policy
Committee naira rally,”  Leon Myburgh  and Coura Fall,
strategists at Citigroup Inc. in Johannesburg, wrote in a note
today. “The move was overdone as the actual market impact of
these measures was not that significant.”  The yield on Nigeria’s seven-year domestic bonds due June
2019 fell one basis point to 16.42 percent, according to July 27
data on the Financial Markets Dealers Association website.
Yields on the nation’s $500 million of Eurobonds due 2021
declined 10 basis points to 5.36 percent today.  Ghana’s cedi depreciated 0.1 percent to 1.9575 per dollar
in Accra, the capital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
