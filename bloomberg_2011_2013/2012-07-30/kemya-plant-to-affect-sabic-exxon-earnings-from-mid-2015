Al-Jubail Petrochemical Co., known
as Kemya, expects to have an “immediate positive” impact on
the earnings of  Saudi Basic Industries Corp. (SABIC)  and  ExxonMobil
Corp. (XOM)  when their venture starts production from a rubber plant.  “We expect an immediate positive contribution to the
results of Kemya, Sabic and ExxonMobil from the moment of
startup,” Jacobus Van Haasteren, executive vice president of
performance chemicals at Sabic, told reporters in Riyadh today.
Production begins in the second half of 2015.  The $3.4 billion  specialty-elastomer plant  on the kingdom’s
Persian Gulf coast will produce 400,000 tons of rubber product a
year that will be exported to Asia and the Middle East and sold
in Saudi Arabia. The venture between Sabic and ExxonMobil
Chemical Co. awarded engineering, procurement and construction
contracts to Daelim Industrial Co. in June.  Technip SA (TEC)  and
 Tecnicas Reunidas SA (TRE)  will build the factory.  The companies aren’t concerned about the project’s
financing, said Sabic Chief Executive Officer Mohamed Al-Mady.  “We are two strong companies, and we have many ways to
finance our project,” Al-Mady said at the press conference.
“It will be announced as soon as we are ready for financing.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
