Serbian  human rights  groups urged
the new government to refrain from firing central bank Governor
Dejan Soskic, saying his ouster would be illegal.  Prime Minister  Ivica Dacic ’s Cabinet, sworn in on July 27,
said it would replace Soskic if he resists government efforts to
stimulate growth through expansive fiscal policies. Soskic vowed
on July 16 not to resign, leaving his removal possible only
through constitutional procedures. NIN weekly magazine wrote on
July 25 that the government will seek to amend the central bank
law within a week or two to remove Soskic.  “With the adoption of a new law on the National Bank of
 Serbia , with the aim of replacing the governor, the ruling
coalition will grossly violate the rule of law in Serbia and
fully degrade the status of all independent institutions and
regulatory bodies,” organizations including Civic Initiatives,
the Belgrade Human Rights Center, the Lawyers’ Committee for
Human Rights, the Helsinki Committee for Human Rights in Serbia
and the Policy Center, said in an e-mail.  The governor is elected to a six-year term after being
nominated by the president and confirmed by Parliament. He can
be replaced if permanently incapacitated for health reasons,
sentenced and jailed for a crime, or if it’s established that
his “unprofessional” performance and “serious misconduct”
keeps the bank from “accomplishing its primary objective,”
according to the central bank law.  Since the fall of  Slobodan Milosevic  in 2000, two central
bank governors have been dismissed by new governments who took
office and changed laws, while one resigned over a disagreement
on fiscal policies and the need for public-sector reforms.  To contact the reporters on this story:
