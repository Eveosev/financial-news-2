China  National Petroleum Corp. has
withdrawn from a project to develop phase 11 of the South Pars
natural- gas field , Tehran-based  Shargh  newspaper reported.  CNPC, as the state-owned company is known, sent 30 of its
experts back to China from the port city of Assaluyeh and halted
operations at its office in the capital, according to the
newspaper. Mousa Souri, the managing director of Iranâ€™s Pars Oil
and Gas Co., declined to comment on the report, Shargh said.  Last month, Iranian oil minister Rostam Qasemi set a
deadline of March 2013 for CNPC to start developing phase 11 of
the gas field, which Iran shares with Qatar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
