Russian Prime Minister  Dmitry Medvedev , who backed  Vladimir Putin  in March elections, said he
doesn’t rule out contending for the presidency in the future.  Speaking in an interview with the Times of  London , Medvedev
said he’s ready to return to the presidency “if people aren’t
fed up with me,” according to a  transcript  of his remarks
released by the government today. “There is no reason for me,
or for those people whom I represent, to quit political life.”  Medvedev, 46, who served as president for four years after
taking over from Putin in 2008, swapped jobs with his mentor in
May. Putin, barred from three consecutive Kremlin terms after
two mandates from 2000-2008, continued to wield power as prime
minister and won a new six-year stint in March elections.  Putin, 59, has faced the biggest unrest of his 12 years in
power after his decision in September to reclaim the top job and
push Medvedev aside, followed by allegations of fraud in
December parliamentary elections that provoked mass protests in
Russian cities.  Medvedev told Russians in an April 26 television interview
that the power-sharing arrangement with Putin was a long-term
agreement.  “Everyone should relax, this is for a long time,” he
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
