Diamond Trust Bank Kenya Ltd. (DTKL) , the
Kenyan lender that’s raising 1.8 billion shillings ($21 million)
in a rights offer, said first-half profit jumped 29 percent as
earnings from loans surged.  Net income climbed to 1.7 billion shillings in the six
months through June, from 1.34 billion shillings a year earlier,
the Nairobi-based lender said in an e-mailed statement today.
Net interest income, the amount banks earn from charges on
loans, surged 47 percent to 4.34 billion shillings, it said.  “They achieved a healthy growth because their core
business improved quite well,” John Kamunya, an analyst at
Nairobi-based Sterling Investment Bank Ltd., said in a phone
interview. “There was good growth in both net interest income
and the loan book.”  Lenders in  Kenya ,  East Africa ’s biggest economy, have
boosted loan income after the central bank raised  interest rates 
to a record 18 percent in December to curb surging inflation and
stabilize the shilling. Average lending rates at commercial
banks are currently 20.12 percent, while deposit rates are 8.42
percent, according to the Central Bank of Kenya’s website.  Kenya Commercial Bank Ltd. (KNCB) , the country’s biggest lender by
assets, said July 26 first-half profit jumped 50 percent, while
 Equity Bank Ltd. (EQBNK) ’s net income grew 14 percent in the six-month
period.  Shares of Diamond Trust closed 0.5 percent lower at 94.50
shillings in Nairobi. The stock has rise 9.7 percent this year,
underperforming a 26 percent increase in the NSE  All-Share index 
over the same period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
