Lithuania’s central government
budget deficit narrowed to 2.4 percent of gross domestic product
in the first six months of the year, the  Finance Ministry  said.  The shortfall, calculated on a cash basis, was 2.8 percent
in the same period of 2011, the ministry, based in the capital,
Vilnius, said today on its website. The measure includes all
public finances except municipal budgets.  Prime Minister Andrius Kubilius’s government is seeking to
narrow the fiscal deficit to 3 percent of GDP this year from 5.5
percent in 2011. Government debt fell to 38.5 percent of
economic output at the end of June from 38.6 percent in May, the
ministry said in a separate statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
