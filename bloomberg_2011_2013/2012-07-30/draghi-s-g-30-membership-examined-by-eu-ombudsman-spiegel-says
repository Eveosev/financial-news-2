European Central Bank President
 Mario Draghi ’s membership in the Group of 30 is being examined
by the European Union ombudsman,  Spiegel Online  reported.  Nikiforos Diamandouros sent a questionaire to the ECB,
asking the Frankfurt-based institution to assess by Oct. 31
Draghi’s role in the consultative group and whether it sees a
conflict of interest in his membership, according to the online
edition of the weekly news magazine. The query follows a
complaint filed by the Corporate Europe Observatory association,
Spiegel Online said.  The Group of 30 is a private, nonprofit organization of
bankers and economists, whose members include former ECB
President  Jean-Claude Trichet , former Federal Reserve Chairman
 Paul Volcker  and JPMorgan Chase International Chairman Jacob
Frenkel. An ECB spokeswoman confirmed to Bloomberg News that it
received the questionaire.  To contact the reporter on this story:
