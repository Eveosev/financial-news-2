Mexico’s peso fell from its
strongest level in a week as investors weighed whether policy
makers will take additional steps to shore up the weakening
global economy.  The peso declined 0.2 percent to 13.2649 per  U.S. dollar  at
4 p.m. in Mexico City, paring its gain this year to 5.1 percent,
the most among the 16 major currencies tracked by Bloomberg. The
currency has rallied 0.7 percent in July and it earlier touched
13.2081 in intraday trading, the strongest since July 20.  European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  prepared to
meet with U.S. Treasury Secretary  Timothy Geithner  today after
sparking a global market rally by pledging to do whatever it
takes to preserve the euro. Federal Reserve policy makers meet
this week to decide whether additional stimulus is needed to
spark growth in the world’s biggest economy.  “We’re going to have a lot of headline risk this week,”
 Eduardo Suarez , a currency strategist at  Bank of Nova Scotia (BNS) ,
said by phone from Toronto. “People are not putting on anything
because it’s hard to have any strong conviction on any trade
when there’s so much headline risk.”  Speculation that the European crisis would hurt Mexican
exports helped make the peso Latin America’s worst-performing
major currency in 2011. Mexico depends on exports for about 30
percent of its gross domestic product, and sends 80 percent of
them to its northern neighbor.  The yield on Mexican local-currency bonds due in 2024
declined three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 5.35
percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The price rose
0.28 centavo to 142.00 centavos per peso.  Bond Swap  Mexico will swap out as much as 22 billion pesos of fixed-
rate bonds, the government’s first exchange of sovereign debt
since September, the central bank said today.  The nation’s central bank will oversee an auction on Aug. 1
of bonds maturing in 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2024. Bondholders can
offer debt maturing in 2014, 2015, 2016, 2020, 2021 and 2027 for
the new securities, according to a statement posted today on the
central bank’s website.  Banco de Mexico , as the central bank is known, will oversee
the auction for the  Finance Ministry .  To contact the reporter on this story:
