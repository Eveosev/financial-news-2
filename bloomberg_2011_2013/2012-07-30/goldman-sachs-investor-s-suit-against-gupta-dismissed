A  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) 
investor’s lawsuit seeking disgorgement of insider-trading
profit from former board member Rajat Gupta was dismissed by a
Manhattan federal judge.  U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff said in an opinion filed
today that the investor, James Mercer, failed to adequately
allege that Gupta received quid-pro-quo payments for tips he
provided to Galleon Group LLC co-founder Raj Rajaratnam.  Gupta, who was also a managing partner of McKinsey Co. and
a director at  Procter & Gamble Co. (PG) , was convicted in June of
securities fraud and conspiracy for tipping Rajaratnam, who is
serving an 11-year prison term for crimes related to insider
trading.  Mercer’s assumption that Gupta received payments “is far
too speculative to survive dismissal,” Rakoff wrote in his
opinion.  The case is Mercer v. Gupta, 11-3828, U.S. District Court,
Southern District of  New York  (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
