Korea Zinc Co. (010130) , the world’s third-
biggest producer of refined zinc, posted a worse-than-expected
6.8 percent drop in second-quarter profit as metal prices
declined.  Net income  was 166.2 billion won ($146 million) in the
three months ended June 30, compared with a revised 178.3
billion won a year earlier, according to a regulatory filing by
the Seoul-based company today. That missed the 199.5 billion won
average of 16 analyst  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  Prices of zinc and lead averaged lower in the second
quarter from a year earlier as the European sovereign-debt
crisis and concerns about an economic slowdown in  China , the
world’s top metals user, curbed demand.  Nyrstar (NYR)  NV, the largest
producer of refined zinc, last week posted a first-half loss on
lower prices.  Korea  Zinc fell 3.5 percent to 378,000 won at the close in
Seoul trading, paring its gains to 24.3 percent this year.
Korea’s benchmark Kospi index gained 0.8 percent today.  Sales dropped 5.5 percent to 1.42 trillion won, today’s
filing showed.  The average price of zinc for immediate delivery slipped 14
percent in the second quarter from a year earlier, while cash
lead decreased 22 percent. Zinc and lead combined were the
biggest contributors to the company’s revenue in 2011, taking up
42.7 percent, according to a company filing on March 30.  Cash silver averaged 23 percent lower during the same
period, while the average price of spot gold gained 6.8 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
