The U.K. Foreign Office said  Syria ’s
charge d’affaires, Khaled al-Ayoubi, has left his post in the
Syrian Embassy in London, saying he’s unwilling to represent
President Bashar al-Assad’s government any longer.  “Mr. al-Ayoubi has told us that he is no longer willing to
represent a regime that has committed such violent and
oppressive acts against its own people and is therefore unable
to continue in his position,” the Foreign Office said in an e-
mailed statement today. “Mr. al-Ayoubi was the most senior
Syrian diplomat serving in London.”  “His departure is another blow to the Assad regime,” the
Foreign Office said. “It illustrates the revulsion and despair
the regime’s actions are provoking amongst Syrians from all
walks of life, inside the country and abroad.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
