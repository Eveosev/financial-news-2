Iran  sentenced to death four people
it said were involved in a $2.6 billion banking fraud, the
official  Islamic Republic News Agency  reported, citing
Prosecutor-General Gholamhossein Mohseni-Ejei.  Another two of the 39 suspects whose files were reviewed by
the judiciary were sentenced to  life imprisonment  and the rest
received prison terms of as much as 25 years, Mohseni-Ejei said
without naming any of the individuals, according to IRNA. The
convicts will also have to return the assets, it said.  Iranian officials said last year that dozens of suspects
had been arrested and in February began to try the fraud case,
which they called the biggest in the country’s history.  President  Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , who campaigned against
corruption before taking office in 2005, came under attack as
critics accused his close aide and relative, Esfandiar Rahim
Mashaei, of having ties to businessman Amir Mansour Khosravi,
the main suspect. The government has denied having connections
to the alleged fraud.  Amir Mansour Aria Development Co. and affiliated companies
linked to Khosravi’s family are the main entities suspected of
playing a role in the scam, Iran’s judiciary has said. Amir
Mansour Aria’s owners allegedly bribed bank managers to get
loans and letters of credit, state media have reported.  Seven state and private banks were reportedly connected to
the fraud, which involved forging letters of credit from the
partially state-owned Bank Saderat to secure loans for
purchasing state-owned companies, Iranian media have said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
