The euro stayed weaker against the
dollar and the yen as economic confidence in the region
decreased more than economists forecast.  Europe ’s common currency fell 0.5 percent to $1.2267 at
10:36 a.m. London time and was 0.8 percent lower at 95.94 yen.  An index of executive and consumer sentiment in 17-nation
euro area dropped to 87.9 from 89.9 in June, the European
Commission in Brussels said today. That’s the lowest since
September 2009. Economists had forecast a drop to 88.9, the
median of 26 estimates in a Bloomberg News survey showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
