Kazakh security forces killed six
men suspected of involvement in the murder of a police officer
two days ago, the Prosecutor General’s Office said.  The suspects, who were tracked to an apartment in the Ahsel
Kent residential district in Almaty, refused to surrender and
opened fire on a special-forces unit, the office, based in the
Kazakh capital, Astana, said in an e-mailed  statement  today. All
six men were killed with return fire from the police and no one
else was injured in the operation, according to the statement.  Sappers were sweeping apartments in the area in western
Almaty, the country’s commercial capital, after a shootout,
during which as many as 30 explosions were heard, an eyewitness
was cited as saying earlier by the Interfax news service.
Saltanat Azirbek, a spokeswoman for Almaty police, wasn’t
available to comment when Bloomberg News called.  Prosecutors said the suspects were linked to an attack on a
patrol car on July 28 that left one police officer dead and
wounded another, with the assailants seizing their weapons. The
men first met in prison and were planning a robbery on the day
of the attack before being stopped for a document check,
according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
