IVG AG fell the most since September
2001 in  Frankfurt  trading after the German property investor
missed its 2012 profit forecast and said it won’t pay a
dividend. The shares dropped as much as 21 percent.  IVG said in a statement today that it had an annual loss of
98.7 million euros ($128.8 million) because of one-time costs
tied to development projects. The Bonn-based company in July
said it would “almost” break even.  “It is a negative surprise that IVG had to clean up the
balance sheet again,”  Jochen Rothenbacher , an analyst at
Equinet Bank in Frankfurt, wrote in a note to investors today.
“However, the one-off items are non-cash and the operational
performance adjusted for these effects was in line with the
company guidance.”  Rothenbacher cut his rating to reduce, a notch higher than
sell, from buy.  IVG last reported an annual profit after tax in 2007. The
company said the one-time costs stemmed mostly from projects and
financing activities initiated in 2006 to 2008. IVG’s pretax
loss narrowed to 86.9 million euros from 217.6 million euros.  The developer was down 18 percent at 1.89 euros at 10:45
a.m. in Frankfurt, cutting its market value to about 391 million
euros and reducing the gain for the past six months to 3.8
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
