The pound dropped the most in a week
against the dollar after U.K. mortgage approvals declined more
in June than economists forecast, adding to signs Britain’s
recession is deepening.  Sterling fell from near a five-week high against the U.S.
currency after Hometrack Ltd. said British  house prices 
decreased for the first time this year in July and may extend
their decline as the economy weakens. U.K. government bonds
dropped for a third day.  “Data-wise, things are still looking weak as far as the
U.K. is concerned and the medium-term picture is very bearish
for sterling,” said  Ian Stannard , head of European currency
strategy at Morgan Stanley in  London . “Weak fundamentals
suggest sterling will remain under pressure.”  The pound declined 0.4 percent to $1.5690 at 4:23 p.m.
London time after dropping as much as 0.5 percent, the biggest
intraday decline since July 23. The U.K. currency strengthened
0.2 percent to 78.07 pence per euro.  U.K. lenders granted 44,192 loans to buy homes, the lowest
since December 2010, and down from a revised 50,544 in May, the
 Bank of England  said. The median forecast in a Bloomberg News
survey of economists was for a drop to 48,000. Home values
slipped 0.1 percent from June, when they stagnated, Hometrack
said. A measure of demand fell the most in six months.  Sterling has risen 4.4 percent in the past year, according
to Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes, which track 10
developed-market currencies. The dollar gained 10 percent and
the euro weakened 7.4 percent.  Pound Support  The pound will find so-called support at $1.5577, which is
the 62 percent retracement of its rally from July 25 to July 27,
according to  Richard Adcock , a technical analyst at UBS AG in
London. Support refers to an area on a price graph where
analysts anticipate buy orders may be clustered.  The 10-year gilt yield rose one basis point, or 0.01
percentage point, to 1.54 percent after dropping to a record
1.407 percent on July 23. The 4 percent bond maturing in March
2022 fell 0.08, or 80 pence per 1,000-pound face amount, to
121.84.  U.K. government bonds have returned 16 percent in the past
year, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the
European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. German
bunds gained 11 percent and Treasuries rose 9 percent.  The Bank of England will announce its next monetary-policy
decision on Aug. 2. The central bank increased its asset-
purchase target by 50 billion pounds to 375 billion pounds and
kept its key  interest rate  at 0.5 percent at its previous
meeting on July 4-5.  The median forecast of 40 economists surveyed by Bloomberg
is for asset purchases to be left unchanged at 375 billion
pounds at this week’s gathering. Scotiabank Europe Plc changed
its forecast this week to an increase, according to an e-mailed
statement today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
