Mol Nyrt.,  Hungary ’s largest

company’s Croatian unit, INA Industrija Nafte d.d., had to pull
out of the country to comply with European Union sanctions,
according to Mol Chairman  Zsolt Hernadi .  “We hope the political situation will stabilize and that
we can return,” Hernadi told commercial radio station Inforadio
in an interview today. “We can go back immediately after the
political situation stabilizes and sanctions are lifted.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
