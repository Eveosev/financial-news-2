The ruble appreciated for a third
day against the central bank’s target dollar-euro basket and
yields on  Russia ’s international debt declined as oil, the
country’s main export, advanced.  The ruble rose as much as 0.3 percent before trading up
less than 0.1 percent at 35.4463 against the basket by the 7
p.m. close in Moscow, its strongest level since July 20. The
country’s $3.5 billion of dollar notes due April 2020 rose,
cutting the yield by five basis points, or 0.05 percentage
point, to 3.041 percent.  Urals crude oil, Russia’s main export, climbed 0.2 percent
to $106.68 per barrel on speculation that European policy makers
will act to boost growth. European Central Bank President  Mario
Draghi  is trying to build a consensus among governments and
central bankers for a plan to ease borrowing costs in Spain and
 Italy  before ECB policy makers meet Aug. 2.  “Oil is holding up well,” Andrey Volkov, head of foreign
exchange and money markets at ZAO Natexis Bank in Moscow, said
by e-mail. “The euro-dollar rate is in a supportive mood so
far.”  The ruble gained 0.5 percent to 39.42 per euro and lost 0.4
percent to 32.195 against the dollar. Investors increased bets
on the currency weakening, with non-deliverable forwards showing
it at 32.6814 per dollar in three months, compared with
expectations of 32.535 per dollar on July 27.  To contact the reporter on this story:
