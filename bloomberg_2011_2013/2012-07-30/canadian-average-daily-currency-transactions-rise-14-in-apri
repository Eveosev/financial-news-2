executed by traders in Canada advanced 14 percent to $59.6
billion in April, from $52.4 billion in October 2011, according
the Canadian Foreign Exchange  Committee .  Compared with a year ago, average daily volume dropped 2.6
percent from $61.2 billion, the survey said. Foreign-exchange
trading in North America fell to $860 billion a day in April, a
decrease of 12 percent from October 2011, according to a report
released by the  Federal Reserve  Bank of New York.  Canadaâ€™s currency is 1.7 percent higher this year versus
the  U.S. dollar , and has gained 2.5 percent against nine major
peers tracked in the Bloomberg Correlation Weighted Indexes, on
speculation increased measures by worldwide central banks
including the Federal Reserve and the  European Central Bank  to
stimulate economic growth will benefit risk assets.  The four most-traded currencies were the U.S. dollar at 93
percent, the Canadian dollar at 70 percent, the euro at 11
percent and the U.K. pound at 5 percent. The yen, Australian
dollar and Swiss franc accounted for most of the remaining
volume, which totals 200 percent because transactions always
involve two currencies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
