Ukraine ratified a free-trade accord
among the  Commonwealth of Independent States  that Prime Minister
 Mykola Azarov  said would boost dealings with the group of former
Soviet republics by more than a third.  The agreement was backed today by 260 lawmakers in the 450-
seat parliament, based in the capital, Kiev. The pact is based
on World Trade Organization rules and will boost CIS trade by 35
percent, Azarov told an extraordinary parliamentary session.  While the deal will bolster Ukraineâ€™s ties with its ex-
communist neighbors, the government has rejected invitations to
join a Russian-led Customs Union that also includes Kazakhstan
and Belarus. Ukraine, where economic growth will slow to 2
percent this year from 5.2 percent in 2011, according to the
 World Bank , is pursuing a free-trade pact with the European
Union instead.  To contact the reporter on this story:
