Siderar SAIC (ERAR) ,  Argentina ’s biggest
steelmaker, said profit for the second quarter fell 83 percent
to 92.6 million pesos ($20.2 million) from a year earlier as
costs rose.  Sales slid 1.1 percent to 3 billion pesos, the company said
in a filing with the Buenos Aires stock exchange. The cost of
sales rose 10 percent to 2.4 billion pesos.  The company said costs increased as a result of rising
prices for raw materials, labor and services.  To contact the reporter on this story:
