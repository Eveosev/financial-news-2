The July 20 shooting in Aurora,
 Colorado , that claimed 12 lives hasn’t significantly altered
Americans’ views on gun regulations, according to a Pew Research
Center poll.  The July 26-29 survey found that 47 percent of Americans
say controlling guns is the priority, while 46 percent say it’s
more important to protect the right to own guns. That is little
changed from an April poll, when 45 percent placed the most
importance on gun control and 49 percent on gun rights.  Neither President  Barack Obama  nor presumed Republican
presidential nominee  Mitt Romney  has called for wide-ranging new
gun laws, perhaps reflecting the stalemate among Americans.
Romney last week rejected the idea that new limits would help
avoid such tragedies; Obama on July 25 said a “consensus around
violence reduction” must be reached.  While there has been little change since early 2009, most
Americans before that time consistently said controlling gun
ownership was a higher priority, Pew said. Still, the research
center found no major increase in support for gun control after
the 2007 Virginia Tech shootings.  More Americans now say that movie theater shootings such as
the one in Colorado are just isolated acts “of troubled
individuals.” In the latest poll, 67 percent agreed with that
statement; in April 2007, just 47 percent did, and 46 percent
said they reflected “broader problems” in society.  Positions on the issue tend to reflect party alliances, Pew
said. Republicans favor gun rights 71 percent to 26 percent,
while Democrats back  gun control  72 percent to 21 percent.  The Pew poll included 1,010 adults.  To contact the reporter on this story:
