Refineria la Pampilla SA , the Repsol
SA unit known as Relapasa, fell the most in 12 weeks after
reporting a loss for the second quarter.  The owner of  Peru ’s largest oil refinery dropped 5 percent
to 57 centimos in Lima trading, the biggest intraday decline
since May 8.  “Investors reacted to the company’s second-quarter loss,”
said Jose Luis Bustamante, head of trading at Cartisa SAB. “The
market is anticipating a general slowdown in consumption.”  Relapasa posted a $25.1 million loss in the second quarter
after a $37 million profit in the same period a year earlier as
sales costs rose 13 percent, according to the earnings
 statement . Peru’s oil refining industry shrank 10 percent
through May as gasoline sales fell, according to the National
Statistics Institute.  To contact the reporter on this story:
