Mainstream Renewable Power Ltd., an
Irish clean-energy developer, applied to build a 1.4 billion-
pound ($2.2 billion) wind farm off the coast of  Scotland .  The 450-megawatt Neart na Gaoithe venture will produce
enough power for 325,000 homes, or as much as 3.7 percent of
Scotlandâ€™s electricity demand, according to a statement from the
Dublin-based Mainstream Renewable sent by e-mail yesterday.  The application for 64 to 125  wind turbines  at the site 15
kilometers (9 miles) off the Fife coast was submitted to the
licensing operations team of Marine Scotland, the arm of the
Scottish government that manages its seas. It will be open to
consultation until Sept. 10, according to the statement.  Mainstream Renewable, developing 15 gigawatts of clean
energy projects internationally, said in the statement the
venture would cost 1.4 billion pounds and create hundreds of
direct and indirect jobs during its 25 years of operation.
Scotland is seeking to get all its electricity from renewables
by the end of the decade to spur its economy and curb emissions.  Mainstream plans to complete a financing agreement next
year with construction at sea starting in 2015. Full operation
of the park, which got approval to connect to the national grid
in 2010, is expected by the end of 2016, the company said.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
