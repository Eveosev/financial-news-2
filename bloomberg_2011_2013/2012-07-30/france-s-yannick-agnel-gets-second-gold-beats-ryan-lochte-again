France’s Yannick Agnel cruised to
his second gold medal of the Olympic swimming competition today,
leading his rivals including the U.S.’s  Ryan Lochte  from start
to finish of the men’s 200-meter freestyle.  The 20-year-old who overhauled Lochte in the final leg of
the 400-meter freestyle relay yesterday stormed to victory at
London’s Aquatic Center in 1 minutes, 43.14 seconds.  Lochte, who took  Michael Phelps ’s 400-meter individual
medley crown on the first day of the swimming meet, failed to
place in the top three.  “In my last 50 (meters) I just took two breaths and I just
put my head down,” Lochte, who finished in 1:45.04, told
reporters. “That’s a solid time for me. I can go a lot faster -
- I don’t really know where I fell off.”  China’s Sun Yang and  South Korea ’s Park Tae Hwan were in a
dead heat for the silver medal, finishing in 1:44.93. Lochte was
fourth at 1:45.04. No bronze medal was awarded.  World champion Paul Biedermann of  Germany  was fifth.
Phelps, the 2008 Olympic champion, didn’t enter the event this
year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
