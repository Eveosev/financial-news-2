A  Chicago  man pleaded guilty to
planning to travel to Somalia to aid the al-Shabaab terrorist
organization, the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Chicago said.  Shaker Masri, 28, entered his plea today before U.S.
District Judge Sharon Johnson Coleman in Chicago, according to a
statement from acting U.S. Attorney Gary S. Shapiro. He will be
sentenced on Oct. 16. His agreement with prosecutors calls for
nine years and 10 months in prison, Shapiro said.  “According to the plea agreement, on July 19, 2010, Masri
told an associate, who, unbeknownst to Masri at the time, was a
government cooperating source, that he had decided to travel
abroad to engage in a jihadist conflict as a combatant,” Shapiro said.  The U.S. has designated al-Shabaab a foreign terrorist
organization, Masri, a U.S. citizen, acknowledged in his
agreement. Defense attorney Thomas A. Durkin of Chicago didn’t
immediately reply to a voice-mail message seeking comment.  Masri was arrested two years ago as he made final
arrangements with the FBI source for his Somali journey, which
was to begin with a flight to  Los Angeles .  Al-Shabaab is an affiliate of the al-Qaeda network, U.S.
officials have said.  The case is U.S. v. Masri, 10-cr-655, U.S. District Court,
Northern District of  Illinois  (Chicago).  To contact the reporter on this story:
