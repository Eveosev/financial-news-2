The head of the United Nations
observer mission in  Syria  said helicopters, tanks and artillery
were being used in Aleppo, where troops loyal to President
Bashar al-Assad are fighting rebels who have taken control of
several districts.  Lieutenant General Babacar Gaye told reporters in Damascus
that he is “deeply concerned” about the violence in Aleppo. He
said that during a visit to Homs province yesterday, he
witnessed “heavy shelling from artillery and mortars, ongoing
in the neighborhoods” of the city of Rastan. A transcript of
his comments was e-mailed by his office.  To contact the reporter on this story:
