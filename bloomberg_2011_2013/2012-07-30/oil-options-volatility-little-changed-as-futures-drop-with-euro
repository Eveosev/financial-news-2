Oil options volatility was little
changed as futures fell when the dollar gained against the euro
on concern that  Europe ’s debt crisis is worsening.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
September, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a
gauge of options prices, was 30.15 percent at 3:20 p.m. on the
 New York Mercantile Exchange , down from 30.16 on July 27.  “It’s a lackluster trading environment, no real
direction,” said Fred Rigolini, vice president of Paramount
Options Inc. in  New York .  Crude oil for September delivery dropped 35 cents to settle
at $89.78 a barrel on the Nymex, the first decline in five days.
The dollar rose 0.5 percent against the euro at 3:30 p.m. in New
York, the first gain in four days. A stronger dollar reduces the
investment appeal of commodities.  The most active options in electronic trading today were
September $80 puts, which fell 4 cents to 18 cents a barrel at
3:32 p.m. with 2,014 lots trading. September $95 calls were the
second-most active options, with 898 lots changing hands as they
declined 21 cents to 63 cents a barrel.  Calls accounted for 52 percent of total electronic trading
volume. One contract covers 1,000 barrels of crude.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on floor
trading, where the bulk of options trading occurs.  In the previous session, bearish bets accounted for 55
percent of the 74,206 contracts traded.  September $83 puts were the most actively traded options
July 27, with 3,614 lots changing hands. They fell 17 cents to
49 cents a barrel. September $80 puts declined 8 cents to 22
cents on volume of 2,943.  Open interest was highest for December $80 puts with 42,366
contracts. Next were December $100 calls with 40,904 lots and
December $120 calls with 38,583.  To contact the reporter on this story:
