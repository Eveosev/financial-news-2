beating analysts’ estimates.  The shares advanced as much as 1.2 percent to 3.28 dirhams
before trading at 3.26 dirhams at 10:38 a.m. in Dubai, set for
the highest close since July 19. The stock has rallied 27
percent so far this year, compared with a gain of 12 percent for
Dubai’s DFM General Index.  Net income climbed to 614 million dirhams ($167 million)
from 250 million dirhams a year earlier. The mean estimate of
five analysts was for a profit of 545 million dirhams, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
