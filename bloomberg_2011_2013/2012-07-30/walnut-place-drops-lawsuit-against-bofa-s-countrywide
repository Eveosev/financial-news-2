An investor group dropped a lawsuit
against  Bank of America Corp. ’s Countrywide Home Loans unit
seeking the repurchase of loans underlying mortgage securities.  The investors, known as Walnut Place, filed two lawsuits
last year against Countrywide in New York State Supreme Court in
 Manhattan . Justice Barbara Kapnick dismissed the first suit in
March and an appeals court upheld the decision last month.  Walnut Place and Countrywide agreed to voluntarily end the
second suit with prejudice, meaning it can’t be refiled,
according to a court document filed on July 27.  Walnut Place earlier this month withdrew from litigation
over  Charlotte , North Carolina-based Bank of America’s proposed
$8.5 billion mortgage-bond settlement with investors. Walnut
Place is a pseudonym used by Boston-based hedge fund Baupost
Group LLC, Theodore Mirvis, a Bank of America attorney, said at
a court hearing last year, according to a transcript.  Owen Cyrulnik, a lawyer representing Walnut Place; Mark
Holland, an attorney representing Countrywide; and Elaine Mann,
a spokeswoman for Baupost, didn’t immediately return telephone
messages seeking comment. Lawrence Grayson, a spokesman for Bank
of America, declined to comment.  The case is Walnut Place LLC v. Countrywide Home Loans Inc,
652146-2011,  New York  State Supreme Court, New York County
(Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
