The U.S. Consumer Financial
Protection Bureau is conducting probes of companies that cover
the entire range of the agency’s authority, which includes banks
and non-bank financial firms.  “Enforcement has endeavored to focus its investigative
resources on the violations of law that cause the greatest harm
to consumers,” the bureau wrote in its semi-annual report,
published today. “The investigations currently under way span
the full breadth of the Bureau’s enforcement jurisdiction.”  The inquiries involve actions initiated by the bureau as
well as those inherited from other regulators or resulting from
consumer complaints, according to the report. So far, it has
concluded one public enforcement action, resulting in a $210
million settlement with McLean, Virginia-based  Capital One
Financial Corp. (COF)   As of June 30, the agency had 889 staff, a number that
includes about 230 who transferred from other federal agencies,
according to the report. By that same date, it had spent $247
million in the 2012 fiscal year, which ends on Sept. 30,
according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
