Colombia’s peso bonds rallied,
pushing yields down the most since April, after the central bank
unexpectedly cut  interest rates  last week for the first time
since 2010 as economic growth slowed.  The yield on Colombia’s 10 percent peso-denominated debt
due in July 2024 fell nine basis points, or 0.09 percentage
point, to 6.68 percent at 12:01 p.m. in Bogota, according to the
central bank. That is the biggest drop since April 9. The yield
is at the lowest level on a closing basis since the securities
were first sold in 2009.  The central bank’s seven-member board, led by bank chief
Jose Dario Uribe, voted to cut the overnight lending rate by a
quarter-percentage point to 5 percent on July 27, surprising 24
of 35 economists surveyed by Bloomberg, who had predicted no
change. While all members voted for a rate reduction, some
members wanted a bigger cut, according to the statement
following the decision.  “Many were expecting a cut but not that soon,” said Munir Jalil, the chief economist at Citigroup Inc.’s  Colombia  unit.
“Some board members wanting an even bigger cut may also mean
the rate may end this year lower than many were initially
forecasting.” Jalil said he may lower his year-end forecast for
the target rate to 4.75 percent.  Growth Forecast  Banco de la Republica lowered on July 27 its 2012 economic
growth forecast to a range of 3 percent to 5 percent from a
previous 4 percent to 6 percent and said that growth in 2013
should be similar.  The Colombian economy expanded 4.7 percent in the first
quarter, the slowest pace since 2010, the national statistics
agency said in a June 21 report. Finance Minister Juan Carlos Echeverry, who sits on the central bank’s board, told reporters
after the monetary policy meeting that he expects the economy to
grow between 4.5 percent and 4.8 percent this year.  The peso appreciated 0.1 percent to 1,790.3 per dollar
today. The currency has jumped 8.3 percent this year, the best
performance among all of the counterparts tracked by Bloomberg.
It has fallen 0.4 percent this month.  While Uribe reiterated on July 27 that the central bank
will buy a minimum of $20 million daily in the  spot market  until
at least Nov. 2, Echeverry said in a W Radio interview that
policy makers are considering a boost in the purchases.  In a separate July 27 statement, the central bank said it
will auction 7 trillion pesos ($3.9 billion) in 23-day
repurchase agreements today. If the sale falls short of the
target, the difference will be offered in a second auction today
of seven-day repurchase agreements. The bank will also auction
8.2 trillion pesos in one-day repurchase agreements today,
according to the statement.  By increasing the maturity of the repurchase agreements to
23 days, the central bank is looking to “better distribute the
liquidity in the different interbank markets,” Jalil said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
