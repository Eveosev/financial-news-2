The U.S. Deputy Secretary of State
said the administration of  Barack Obama  is “deeply concerned”
by acts of violence and intimidation against journalists in
 Mexico .  The U.S. is determined to stop the flow of illicit arms and
money that is fueling the violence across its southern border,
 William Burns  said during a visit to Mexico today. The U.S. will
“build on” a three-year, $1.6 billion anti-drug assistance
package known as the Merida Initiative, he said, without giving
details.  Mexican journalists are facing attacks by organized crime
groups seeking to suppress their coverage of the drug war. Out
of 126 attacks on media outlets since 2000, only 19 percent have
been prosecuted, according to the government’s human rights
commission. Over the weekend, armed men set fire and shot at a
building that houses El Norte, a newspaper in northern Mexico
that’s part of the Grupo Reforma chain, the third attack on the
paper in less than a month.  “The United States is deeply concerned about acts of
violence and intimidation intended to suppress the free flow of
information,” Burns said. “We stand with journalists who risk
their lives to inform the public.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
