NZX Ltd. (NZX) , the operator of  New
Zealand ’s stock exchange, fell the most in nine years after
saying that first-half profits would drop on lower trading
values and higher expenses.  The shares decreased 10.6 percent, the most since June
2003, to NZ$1.18 at the 5 p.m. close.  First-half net profit after tax will be between NZ$3
million ($2.4 million) and NZ$4 million, compared with NZ$4.5
million a year earlier, the Wellington-based company said in a
statement, citing preliminary unaudited estimates. While trading
volumes were higher, transaction values fell 12.4 percent in the
second quarter compared with a year earlier, similar to offshore
trends, according to the statement.  Expenses may have increased as much as NZ$3 million in the
first half, partly due to a change of chief executive officer in
May.  Listings and secondary capital raisings were down
“significantly” from a year earlier, the company said.
Derivatives and commodities showed “strong” growth.  To contact the reporter on this story:
