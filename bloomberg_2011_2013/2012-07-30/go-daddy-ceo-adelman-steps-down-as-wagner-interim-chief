Go Daddy Group Inc., the website
registration and hosting company owned by investment firms
including  KKR & Co. (KKR) , said Chief Executive Officer Warren Adelman
will step down from that role.  Scott Wagner, an executive in KKR’s Capstone consulting
group, will act as interim CEO, Scottsdale, Arizona-based Go
Daddy said today in a statement. Adelman will be special adviser
for strategy and global policy.  KKR, along with Silver Lake and Technology Crossover
Ventures, bought Go Daddy last year in a deal that valued the
 Internet company  at about $2.25 billion. Go Daddy had $1.1
billion in sales last year, according to today’s statement.  Wagner has worked with Go Daddy during the past year
through KKR Capstone, the unit of New York-based KKR that
advises companies on how they can improve their operations. He
joined KKR Capstone in 2000 and has worked with such companies
as  Nielsen Holdings NV (NLSN)  and First Data Corp., according to KKR’s
website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
