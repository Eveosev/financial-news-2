South Korean banks’ combined profit
dropped 59 percent in the second quarter from a year earlier,
when the lenders posted gains from selling stakes in a
construction company.  Net income at the 18 lenders fell to 2.4 trillion won ($2.1
billion) in the three months ended June 30 from 5.8 trillion won
a year earlier, when they booked 3.2 trillion won from the sales
of  Hyundai Engineering & Construction Co. (000720)  shares, the  Financial
Supervisory Service  said in an e-mailed statement today.  Narrower loan margins and increased provisions for bad
debts also weighed on the earnings, according to today’s
statement. Profit prospects for banks including  KB Financial
Group Inc. (105560)  and  Hana Financial Group Inc. (086790)  are waning as the
economic slowdown forces them to set aside more cash for soured
loans and the central bank cuts  interest rates  to spur growth.  Net interest margin, a key measure of profitability from
lending, declined to 2.13 percent last quarter from 2.32 percent
a year earlier. Loan-loss provisions rose to 2.3 trillion won
from 2.1 trillion won, according to the FSS.  KB Financial, owner of Kookmin Bank, the country’s biggest
lender, said on July 27 that second-quarter profit dropped 33
percent from a year earlier after it set aside more funds for
bad debt. It booked a 413.9 billion won pretax gain from selling
a stake in Hyundai Engineering a year earlier.  South Korean lenders including KB Financial acquired stakes
in Hyundai Engineering after swapping loans into stock following
its debt restructuring in 2000.  To contact the reporter on this story:
