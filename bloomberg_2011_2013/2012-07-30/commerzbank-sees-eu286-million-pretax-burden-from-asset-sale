Commerzbank AG (CBK) ,  Germany ’s second-
biggest lender, reported profit that fell short of analysts’
estimates after saying it would sell its stake in Ukraine’s Bank
Forum JSC and take a charge of 286 million euros ($351 million).  Second-quarter pretax profit was about 350 million euros,
the Frankfurt-based lender said in a statement yesterday,
falling short of the 491-million-euro average estimate of six
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Commerzbank, which spent three years freeing itself from
government aid needed to survive the 2008 financial crisis,
announced plans last month to exit shipping and real estate
finance in a bid to boost capital as a shield against more
writedowns on its sovereign-debt portfolio. European lenders are
taking steps to weather the crisis that forced five euro
countries to seek bailouts.  The sale of the Bank Forum stake acquired in 2008, which
will reduce the German lender’s risk-weighted assets, won’t have
a significant impact on its core Tier 1 capital ratio, which
rose to about 12 percent by the end of the second quarter,
Commerzbank said.  “The dynamic development of the Ukraine has not come into
effect as expected in past years,” the bank said in the
statement. “Commerzbank does not expect a sustainable
improvement in the near future. In the course of the ongoing
review of its group strategy, Commerzbank therefore decided to
sell its stake in Bank Forum.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
