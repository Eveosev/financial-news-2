Spencer Tunick, the artist known for
photographing hundreds of naked volunteers, plans to join a mass
clothed floating event at the  Dead Sea  to raise awareness of its
shrinking shores.  The event, planned for September, is the third of its kind
and is sponsored by  Save Our Sea , a group of activists suffering
from various skin diseases such as psoriasis who rely on the
Dead Sea waters and mud for treatment and relief.  “We fear the day when so many patients cannot get the
treatment they need because of the Dead Sea’s disappearance,”
John Sekulow, co-founder of Save Our Sea, said in an e-mailed
statement. Tunick will participate in the event and possibly
photograph it, according to the statement.  Last year, the U.S.-born Tunick photographed a large group
of naked Israelis at the  Dead Sea . He has done similar work at
the Big Chill Festival in the U.K. and cities including London,
Amsterdam, Sydney and  Buenos Aires . In 2007, 600 volunteers
posed naked for him on  Europe ’s Aletsch glacier to illustrate
humanity’s tragic relationship with the climate.  To contact the reporters on this story:
