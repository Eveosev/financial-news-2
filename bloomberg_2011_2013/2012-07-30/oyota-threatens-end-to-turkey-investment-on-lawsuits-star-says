Toyota Motor Co. (7203) , the world’s best-
selling automaker in the first half of the year, is threatening
to stop investing in  Turkey  after a number of employees filed
lawsuits against it, the Star reported, without saying where it
got the information.  Toyota sent a delegation to meet with officials from
Turkey’s Labor Ministry after an employee won 150,000 liras
($83,000) in compensation from a Turkish court for loss of
feeling in a finger, prompting about 15 other employees to
pursue cases against the company, the Istanbul-based newspaper
said.  Toyota had earlier been accused of discriminating against
employees who practice the Islamic faith, according to Star.  To contact the reporter on this story:
