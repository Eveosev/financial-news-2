German monitoring for western corn
rootworm, an insect pest that can decimate corn yields, found
fewer adult bugs than at the same time last year, industry group
Deutsches Maiskomitee e.V. reported.  As of July 28, 129 beetles had been caught in the region of
Baden-Wuerttemberg compared with more than 1,500 a year ago, the
Bonn-based group wrote in a  report  dated that day on its
website. In Bavaria, there was one reported finding.  Corn rootworm  larvae  gnaw the roots of their host plant,
causing as much as $1 billion a year in damages for U.S. corn
farmers on control costs and yield losses, according to research
by the  University of Wisconsin . German losses are expected to
reach 25 million euros ($31 million), according to Deutsches
Maiskomitee.  “The numbers caught in Baden-Wuerttemberg for now are
clearly below the previous year’s level,” the group wrote. It
said it’s been  tracking  rootworm numbers since 2007, when the
pest was first found in Germany.  The insect was introduced in Europe in the Balkan region in
the 1990s, according to Deutsches Maiskomitee. The western corn
rootworm has  spread  across central Europe and into northern
 Italy  and eastern France, and last year the first specimens were
caught in Russia, according to  Purdue University .  To contact the reporter on this story:
