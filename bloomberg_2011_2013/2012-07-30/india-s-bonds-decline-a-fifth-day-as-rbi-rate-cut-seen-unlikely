India ’s 10-year bonds dropped for a
fifth day, the longest losing streak this month, as economists
predicted the central bank will leave  interest rates  unchanged
tomorrow.  The  Reserve Bank of India  will hold the repurchase  rate  at
8 percent, according to 31 of 34 analysts in a Bloomberg survey.
Three expect a 25 basis point cut. Monsoon rains are likely to
be 21 percent below normal in the two months through July, the
state weather forecaster said on its website yesterday.
Inflation in Asia’s third-largest economy held above 7 percent
for a fifth month in June, official data show.  “The RBI may refrain from cutting rates due to
inflationary concerns,” said N.S. Venkatesh, Mumbai-based head
of treasury at state-run  IDBI Bank Ltd. (IDBI)  “Poor rains may add to
price pressures.”  The yield on the 8.15 percent notes due June 2022 rose
three basis points to 8.15 percent in Mumbai, according to the
central bank’s trading system. The rate is the highest since
July 10.  The pace of price gains is “way above” the RBI’s
threshold level of 5 percent, Governor Duvvuri Subbarao said on
July 16.  The central bank cut the  repurchase rate  by 50 basis points
to 8 percent in April, after raising it by a record 375 basis
points through 2010 and 2011. Subbarao held the repo  rate  at 8
percent at a meeting on June 18.  Global Slowdown  Gross domestic product climbed 5.3 percent in the three
months through March, the least since 2003, hurt by a moderation
in investment and a global slowdown as the impact of Europe’s
turmoil fanned through the world economy.  The economy may expand 6.5 percent in the fiscal year
through March 2013, based on a compilation of forecasts from
other organizations, the  Reserve Bank  of India said in a report
today. An April survey projected 7.2 percent growth.  “Growth risks in 2012-2013 have been amplified by
decelerating global trade and domestic supply constraints,”
today’s report said. “On the other hand, persistent inflation,
limits the space for monetary policy to revive growth.”  One-year  interest-rate swaps , or derivative contracts used
to guard against fluctuations in funding costs, rose two basis
points to 7.66 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
