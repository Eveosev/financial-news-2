The U.S. Department of  Homeland
Security  is seeking riot gear for the presidential conventions
and inauguration, according to a federal government website.  The agency wants to buy about 150 sets of riot helmets and
protective gear for the upper body, forearm, shin, thigh and
groin, according to a solicitation posted Wednesday on a federal
government website. No cost estimate was provided for the gear,
which includes carry bags and gloves.  The successful bidder must be able to deliver the equipment
within 15 days from the award of the contract, according to the
 online notice . The department said it wanted products similar to
those made by companies such as Costa Mesa, California-based
 Ceradyne Inc. (CRDN)  and Safariland LLC, which has headquarters in
Ontario,  California , and Jacksonville, Florida.  “This gear is routinely acquired, and replaced as needed,
and used in any number of situations around the country,”
Marsha Catron, a Homeland Security spokeswoman, said in an e-
mail.  The equipment is being purchased for the Federal Protective
Service, which provides protection for special events in
addition to its mission of guarding federal property.  Separately, Democrats will receive a $50 million grant from
the Department of Homeland Security to defray police costs for
their Sept. 4-6 convention in  Charlotte ,  North Carolina .
Republicans will get the same amount for their four-day
convention in Tampa, Florida, that begins Aug. 27.  To contact the reporter on this story: Kathleen Miller in
