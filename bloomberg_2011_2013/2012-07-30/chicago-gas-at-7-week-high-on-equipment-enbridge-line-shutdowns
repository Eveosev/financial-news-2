Chicago gasoline rose to the highest
level since June as Phillips 66 and Citgo Petroleum Inc. shut
equipment at Illinois refineries and  Enbridge Inc. (ENB)  closed a
crude-oil line following a leak.  Phillips 66’s 356,000-barrel-a-day Wood River refinery
closed a compressor, while a unit of Citgo’s Lemont plant was
shut because of an upset, according to state filings. Enbridge
halted transmission on  Line 14  on July 27 after the pipe spilled
an estimated 1,200 barrels of oil. The line carries crude to
Midwestern refineries.  The premium for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in Chicago
widened 10.5 cents to 23.5 cents a gallon  versus  futures traded
on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 2:41 p.m., the highest
level since June 13, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ultra-low sulfur diesel in Chicago gained 3 cents to a
premium of 14 cents a gallon versus heating oil futures traded
on the Nymex, the widest gap since June 13.  “Chicago basis is going crazy,” said Mark Anderle, a
trader at Truman Arnold Cos. in Dallas. “You’ve got blips all
over the place. Gulf is stronger as well.”  Reformulated 87-octane gasoline on the  Gulf Coast  added
1.25 cents to a premium of 1.75 cents a gallon at 4:17 p.m. in
New York. Conventional 87-octane gasoline’s discount narrowed
2.5 cents to 7.25 cents.  Rich Johnson , a Phillips 66 spokesman based in Houston,
declined to comment on Wood River.  The fluid catalytic cracking unit at the Lemont refinery is
undergoing maintenance that should be finished within the week,
Citgo said in an e-mailed statement.  Enbridge’s 317,600-barrel-a-day Line 14 delivers crude to
refineries including Citgo’s Lemont.  BP Plc (BP/)  kept a coker at its  Whiting refinery  in  Indiana 
closed to repair damage from a fire last week. The unit at the
420,000-barrel-a-day plant, the largest serving in the Chicago
market, may be shut for two weeks.  Cokers convert heavy refinery streams, such as vacuum
bottoms, into light products like naphtha and heating oil.  To contact the reporter on this story:
