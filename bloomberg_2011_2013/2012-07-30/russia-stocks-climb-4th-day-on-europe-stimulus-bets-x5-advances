Russian stocks rose for a fourth day
as investors bought riskier assets on bets European policy
makers will contain the region’s debt crisis.  The  Micex Index (INDEXCF)  added 1.6 percent to 1,428.62 by the 6:45
p.m. close in Moscow, extending its winning streak to the
longest in almost a month. Oil producer OAO Surgutneftegas
increased 2.1 percent. OAO Magnit, Russia’s largest food
retailer by market value, jumped 3.5 percent.  Leaders in Berlin, Paris and Rome have backed European
Central Bank President  Mario Draghi ’s approach to combat the
sovereign debt crisis, saying they will do what’s needed to
protect the euro. The ECB’s Governing Council is scheduled to
meet on Aug. 2 while the U.S. Federal Reserve’s Federal Open
Market Committee will consider the need for more stimulus at a
two-day meeting that concludes on Aug. 1.  “This week will start with an extension of the optimism
that helped the rally over the last two days,”  Chris Weafer ,
 Troika Dialog ’s chief strategist, said in an e-mailed research
note today. “This optimism rests on the hope that the Fed and
ECB may take actions this week to boost economic activity and
reduce risk.”  Crude oil, the nation’s chief export earner, was little
