Oil tankers able to haul at least 20
million barrels of Iranian crude signaled for  China  in July,
highlighting one of the challenges the U.S. and  Europe  face as
they pressure the Persian Gulf state over its nuclear program.  At least 10 very large crude carriers controlled by Tehran-
based NITC signaled for ports in the world’s largest energy
consuming nation this month, according to  IHS Inc. (IHS)  data compiled
by Bloomberg. Each has the capacity to carry about 2 million
barrels. Six signaled they were sailing to China today, adding
to four that did so July 3, marking the largest monthly tally
since Bloomberg began compiling snapshots of the company’s fleet
in April. The latest delivery will be Aug. 20.  The European Union banned the purchase and insurance of
Iranian oil from July 1. About 95 percent of the world’s tankers
were insured by companies following EU law before the embargo.
The U.S. Treasury Department said July 12 it would freeze NITC’s
American assets. The West claims  Iran’s nuclear program  is an
attempt to make an atomic weapon while the country says it’s for
civilian purposes. China imported about 17 million barrels a
month from  Iran  last year, customs data show.  At least 32 ships in NITC’s 40-strong fleet of crude
carriers provided signals within the past month, IHS data
compiled by Bloomberg showed today. That compared with 33 in the
corresponding period to July 3.  To contact the reporter on this story:
