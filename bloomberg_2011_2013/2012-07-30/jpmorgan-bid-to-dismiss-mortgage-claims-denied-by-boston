JP Morgan Chase & Co. (JPM) ’s attempt to
dismiss claims in a lawsuit over its mortgage modification
program was rejected by a federal judge in  Boston .  U.S. District Judge Richard Stearns turned down JPMorgan’s
request to have some claims dismissed for lack of jurisdiction
and failure to state a claim, according to a filing July 27 in
Boston.  The litigation consolidates lawsuits brought by homeowners
in more than a dozen states that claim JPMorgan made “false and
misleading promises” about modifications to their mortgages.
The homeowners also claim the bank foreclosed on some homes
despite promises they could stay in them while new payment terms
were being negotiated.  JPMorgan agreed to participate in the  U.S. Treasury ’s Home
Affordable Modification Program in 2009. According to court
papers, banks were required to suspend foreclosure proceedings
during the modification process.  “We strive to comply with all HAMP guidelines,”  Amy Bonitatibus , a spokeswoman for New York-based JPMorgan, said in
an e-mail. “With regard to the motion to dismiss, we don’t
comment on pending litigation.”  The case is In re: JP Morgan Chase Mortgage Modification
Litigation, 11-md-02290, U.S. District Court, District of
Massachusetts (Boston).  To contact the reporter on this story:
