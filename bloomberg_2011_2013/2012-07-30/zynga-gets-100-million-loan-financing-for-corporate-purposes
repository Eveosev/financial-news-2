Zynga Inc. (ZNGA) , the biggest developer of
games played on Facebook Inc.’s social network, obtained a $100
million term loan to be used for general corporate purposes.  The debt, expiring June 30, 2017, will pay interest at 75
basis points more than the London interbank offered rate, the
San Francisco-based company said today in a regulatory filing.  Zynga said it has a $1 billion revolving line of credit
that it received a year ago. As of June 30, the company hadn’t
drawn the credit.  A basis point is 0.01 percentage point. In a term loan,
money can’t be borrowed again once it’s repaid.  To contact the reporter on this story:
