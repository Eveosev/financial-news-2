(Corrects percentage of credit growth in second
paragraph.)  A rapid growth in credit by Nigerian
lenders may weaken the quality of their assets and lead to
increased impairment charges unless curbed, Fitch Ratings said.  While the quality of assets held by banks improved in 2011,
a “rapid underlying credit growth of 30 percent-66 percent was
evident in most of the Fitch-rated banks” and may become “a
negative credit driver if it continues,” the agency said today
in an e-mailed statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
