Komatsu Ltd. (6301) , the world’s second-
biggest maker of construction equipment, fell after a Nikkei
newspaper report said the company’s first-quarter operating
profit declined for the first time in 10 quarters.  The stock  fell  as much as 3.8 percent to 1,696 yen and
traded 3.2 percent lower at 9:33 a.m. in Tokyo trading,
extending its loss this year to 5.2 percent.  Komatsu’s operating profit probably fell about 20 percent
to 56 billion yen ($714 million) in the April-to-June quarter
after sales of construction equipment in China halved due to
lower public works spending, the Nikkei reported on July 28,
without saying where it got the information. Higher sales from
 Japan  and  North America  failed to offset the slump in  China , the
paper said.  Full-year earnings will probably be below the company’s
earlier forecast, the Nikkei report said. Operating profit may
rise 23 percent to 315 billion yen for the financial year to
March 2013, the company said in April.  Komatsu said today in a statement that it’s not the source
of the Nikkei report and that it will announce results for the
period tomorrow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
