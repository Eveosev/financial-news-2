Anglo American Plc (AAL) , the worst
performer among London-listed diversified mining companies this
year, added to declines after first-half profit fell 46 percent.  The stock slid as much as 2 percent to 1,856.5 pence, after
dropping 3.6 percent on July 27 as earnings missed forecasts.
Anglo had a “terrible” first half, Jefferies International
Ltd. analysts including  Christopher LaFemina  said in a note.  Anglo traded at 1,889 pence by 10:48 a.m. in  London , with
the FTSE 350 Mining Index up 1 percent. The  company has  fallen
21 percent this year while  Xstrata Plc (XTA)  declined 14 percent, BHP
dropped 0.8 percent and Rio Tinto Group sank 6.2 percent.  “Ongoing problems at Minas Rio and Anglo Platinum,
continued cost inflation and a lack of free cash flow generation
have us concerned about the Anglo American investment case,”
the Jefferies analysts said. Anglo’s underlying  earnings , which
exclude one-time items, dropped to $1.69 billion, or $1.38 a
share, from $3.12 billion, or $2.58 a share a year earlier.  The miner said metal price declines and rising costs led to
the falling profit, adding that the start-up of its largest
project, the Minas Rio iron ore site in  Brazil , may be delayed
by a year. Anglo is reviewing its platinum unit, which has idled
mines, in anticipation of continued weak prices.  First-half earnings excluding one-time items dropped 46
percent to $1.69 billion, or $1.38 a share. That compares with
the $1.57-a-share median estimate of 11 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg.  Naxitis cut its recommendation on the stock to neutral from
buy. Societe Generale SA, SBG Securities (Pty) Ltd., Investec
Ltd. and Jefferies cut their 2012  earnings forecasts  after the
profit decline. The mean estimate of 24 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg is for $3.30 a share compared with $5.85 at the start
of the year. London Metals Exchange Index prices fell an average
17 percent in the first half from a year earlier as  Europe ’s
debt crisis dimmed the outlook for raw-materials demand.  To contact the reporter on this story:
