Ethanol futures rose the most in two
weeks in  Chicago  as corn jumped to a record, making the fuel
more costly.  Futures rose a second day on speculation drought in the
Midwest threatens corn yields. The grain is the primary
feedstock used to make ethanol in the U.S., with one bushel
distilling into at least 2.75 gallons of the biofuel.  “It’s following corn,” said Mark Anderle, a trader at
Truman Arnold Cos. in  Dallas . “Corn is up across the curve and
so is ethanol.”  Denatured ethanol for August delivery climbed 5.8 cents, or
2.3 percent, to $2.613 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade,
the highest settlement since July 23. It was the biggest one-day
gain since July 16.  In spot market trading, ethanol in  New York  increased 3
cents to $2.64 a gallon, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. In the U.S. Gulf, the additive rose 3 cents to $2.62.  Ethanol on the West Coast jumped 3 cents to $2.76 a gallon
and in Chicago the biofuel gained 1 cent to $2.54.  Corn for December delivery advanced 20.75 cents, or 2.6
percent, to settle at a record $8.14 a bushel in Chicago.  To contact the reporters on this story:
