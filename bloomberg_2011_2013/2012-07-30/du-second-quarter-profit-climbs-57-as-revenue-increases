Du (DU) , one of the two phone operators
in the  United Arab Emirates , posted a 57 percent increase in
second-quarter profit as mobile-phone and data users rose.  Net income after a 50 percent royalty payment to the
government climbed to 325.5 million dirhams ($89 million) from
207.2 million dirhams a year earlier, the company also known as
Emirates Integrated Telecommunications Co. said in a statement
to the Dubai stock market today. The median estimate of three
analysts was for a profit of 337 million dirhams, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Revenue increased 13 percent to 2.45
billion dirhams from 2.17 billion dirhams.  “We expect the level of revenue growth to continue in
2012,” Chief Executive Officer Osman Sultan said in a
conference call, adding that the increase in mobile subscribers
was driving growth at the company.  Du competes in the U.A.E. with  Emirates Telecommunications
Corp. (ETISALAT) , known as Etisalat, which posted a 17 percent increase in
second-quarter profit. At the end of the second quarter, Du’s
share of the U.A.E. mobile-phone market was 46.5 percent,
according to the statement. Mobile-phone revenue rose 14 percent
to 1.9 billion dirhams as the company added 196,300 active
subscribers, raising its customer base to 5.7 million.  Fixed-line clients grew 10.6 percent to 546,600 at the end
of the second-quarter.  The company has made “no progress” on network sharing
agreements and number portability with Etisalat, Sultan said.
The carrier may also also still expand to  Saudi Arabia  as a
mobile virtual network operator, he added.  Sultan said there are no plans to allow international
investors to own its shares following a decision to do so by
state-controlled Etisalat. There is “nothing on the table at
this time”, he said. The company should have a “sustainable
dividend policy”, Sultan said, after paying its first dividend
last year.  Du shares  rose 1.26 percent at 11:09 a.m. in Dubai. The
stock has gained 11.4 percent this year compared with a 2.19
percent increase for Etisalat.  To contact the reporter on this story:
