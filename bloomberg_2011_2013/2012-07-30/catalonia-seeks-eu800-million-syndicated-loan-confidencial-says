The regional government of Catalonia
is negotiating an 800 million euro ($983.4 million) syndicated
loan led by  La Caixa  to meet short-term financing needs,  El
Confidencial  reported, citing unidentified people in the banking
sector.  The 800 million-euro loan will subsume a one-month 500
million euro bridge loan that the regional government was
seeking and will be repaid in September, El Confidencial said.  Banco Santander SA (SAN) ,  Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA (BBVA) ,
Banco Sabadell SA,  Banco Popular SA (POPULA)  and CatalunyaCaixa are among
lenders participating in the loan, El Confidencial added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
