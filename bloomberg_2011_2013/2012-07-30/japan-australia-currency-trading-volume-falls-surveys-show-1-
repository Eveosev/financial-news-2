Currency trading volume in  Japan  and
 Australia  decreased in April, the nations’ foreign-exchange
committees said on their websites today.  The average daily trading volume of foreign currencies in
Tokyo fell 7.6 percent to $262.8 billion in April from a year
earlier, Japan’s  Foreign Exchange Market Committee  said, citing
a survey of financial institutions.  The decrease in transactions reflects lower volatility in
major currency pairs, the committee said in a statement. Spot
trading dropped 13 percent and currency options declined 36
percent, while forward trading increased 2.8 percent, according
to the survey.  Average daily turnover in Australia slid 20 percent to
$175.7 billion, compared with the same month a year earlier, the
Australian Foreign Exchange Committee said today, citing  a
similar poll .  To contact the reporters on this story:
