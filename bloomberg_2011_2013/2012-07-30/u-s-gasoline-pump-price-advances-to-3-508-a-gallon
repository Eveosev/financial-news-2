Retail gasoline in the U.S. gained
for the fourth straight week, catching up to crude prices that
have advanced almost $5 a barrel this month.  The  national average price  for regular gasoline increased
1.4 cents, or 0.4 percent, to $3.508 a gallon from a week
earlier, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said in a
report on its website yesterday. Prices are down 20 cents, or
5.5 percent, from a year earlier.  Retail gasoline prices have increased 7 cents a gallon this
month as crude, which accounts for about 66 percent of the cost
of the motor fuel, gained on speculation that U.S. and European
policy makers will act to boost economic growth and that unrest
in the  Middle East  may disrupt supplies. Prices at the pump may
plateau next week as oil fluctuates around $90 a barrel, said
 David Hackett , the president of Stillwater Associates in Irvine,
 California , an independent fuel consultant.  “Crude prices have calmed down since the mid July run-
up,” Hackett said by e-mail yesterday. “Don’t look for
gasoline prices to do much unless there are unscheduled refining
problems.”  Oil for September delivery was at $89.68 a barrel, down 10
cents, on the  New York  Mercantile Exchange today. Futures
yesterday slipped 0.4 percent to settle at $89.78. Prices are up
$4.72, or 5.6 percent, this month.  Gasoline futures on Nymex dropped as much as 1.7 cents, or
0.6 percent, to $2.9201 a gallon. Prices rose 4.9 cents, or 1.7
percent, to $2.9368 yesterday, the highest settlement since July
20.  Unit Shutdowns  The shutdown of  Enbridge Inc. (ENB) ’s Line 14 following a July 27
spill has caused at least one U.S. Midwest refiner to slow
output. Citgo Petroleum Corp. said in an e-mailed statement
yesterday that the shut pipeline, which runs from Superior,
 Wisconsin , to Griffith/Harsdale in  Indiana , is having “some
impact” on production at the 170,500 barrel-a-day Lemont
refinery in  Illinois .  The Lemont plant shut a gasoline-making fluid catalytic
cracker July 28 for repairs scheduled to be finished “within
the week,” Houston-based Citgo said in the statement.  Valero Energy Corp. (VLO)  also shut a fluid catalytic cracker at
the Benicia refinery in Northern California for “several days”
of compressor repairs July 26, and the company’s Meraux plant in
 Louisiana  has been shut since a fire in a crude unit July 22.  BP Plc (BP/) , based in  London , may keep a coker at the Whiting
refinery in Indiana shut for two to four weeks to perform
repairs following a fire July 23, a person with knowledge of
operations at the plant said July 27.  U.S. Stockpiles  Inventories of crude  in the U.S. climbed for the first time
in five weeks in the seven days ended July 20, rising by 2.72
million barrels to 380.1 million, the Energy Department said
July 25. They probably fell 1.05 million barrels, or 0.3
percent, to 379.1 million last week, according to the median of
eight analyst estimates before the government report tomorrow.  Motor-gasoline inventories  increased by 4.13 million
barrels, or 2 percent, to 210 million in the week ended July 20,
the Energy Department said. Gasoline stockpiles were probably
unchanged last week, the Bloomberg survey showed.  Average U.S. gasoline demand  for the four weeks ended July
20 fell 3.2 percent from a year earlier to 8.8 million barrels a
day, the Energy Department data showed.  Gasoline rose the most this week in the Midwest, increasing
3.3 cents to $3.515 a gallon, the Energy Department report
showed. Prices declined in the Rocky Mountain region and on the
West Coast, the agency said.  The Energy Department conducts a telephone survey of about
800 retail gasoline outlets across the U.S. each Monday to post
weekly gasoline prices as of 8 a.m. local time that day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
