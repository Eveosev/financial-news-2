Temperatures in the U.S. mid-
Atlantic states may rise into the mid-90s next week while the
Midwest remains hot and dry.  Rainfall may remain below normal from  Iowa  to Texas and
parts of Louisiana from Aug. 4 to Aug. 13, said Joel Widenor,
co-founder of Commodity Weather Group LLC. Minnesota and parts
of southern Indiana and Ohio may be the exception.  Along the mid-Atlantic and in the Northeast, temperatures
are expected to rise about 5 degrees above normal from Aug. 4 to
Aug. 8 before returning to more seasonal levels Aug. 9 to Aug.
13, said  Matt Rogers , Commodity Weather’s president. By mid-
August, the region will have passed its temperature peak for the
year, so the above-normal heat will mean “mainly low-to-mid 90s
rather than the upper 90s (about 36 Celsius) to low 100s that
frequented July,” Rogers said from his Bethesda,  Maryland 
office.  The hot, dry conditions across much of the U.S. in July
contributed to higher natural gas and corn prices. Drought
covers 63.9 percent of the contiguous 48 U.S. states and less
than a third of the nation’s corn and soybean crops were listed
in good or excellent condition as of July 22, the lowest for the
date since 1988, according to the Agriculture Department.  The higher temperatures also meant more electricity use,
contributing to natural gas prices rebounding 58 percent as of
last week from a 10-year low in April. Stronger consumption has
helped reduce a stockpile surplus for 16 consecutive weeks.  The normal average temperature in New York for Aug. 1 is
78, according to MDA EarthSat Weather in Gaithersburg, Maryland.
It’s 74 in  Boston ; 80 in Washington; 85 in Houston; 76 in
Chicago; 80 in Atlanta; 67 in Seattle and 76 in Burbank,
California.  -With assistance from Asjylyn Loder in New York, Whitney
