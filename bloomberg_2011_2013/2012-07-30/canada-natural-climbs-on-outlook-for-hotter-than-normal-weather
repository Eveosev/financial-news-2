Canadian natural gas gained on
forecasts for hotter-than-normal U.S. weather into mid-August
that may boost demand for the power-plant fuel.  August gas in Alberta  climbed 8.3 percent as MDA EarthSat
Weather in Gaithersburg, Maryland, predicted above-normal
temperatures concentrated in the central U.S. this week will
spread across much of the country Aug. 4-13. Unusually hot
weather has spurred demand from electricity generators that had
already been switching from coal as U.S. gas prices fell to a
decade low in April.  “A lot of traders who participated in natural gas for the
last several weeks have been burned by saying this heat can’t
last,”  James Cordier , portfolio manager at OptionSellers.com in
Tampa,  Florida . “Over the next four to six weeks, natural gas
could easily touch $4.”  Alberta gas for August delivery rose 18.75 cents to C$2.46
per gigajoule ($2.33 per million British thermal units) as of
3:40 p.m. New York time on NGX, a Canadian Internet market. Gas
traded on the exchange is shipped to users in Canada and the
U.S. and priced on  TransCanada Corp. (TRP) ’s Alberta system.  Natural gas for September delivery on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange  advanced 19.9 cents, or 6.6 percent, to
$3.214 per million Btu, the highest settlement price since Dec.
13. The futures are up 7.5 percent this year.  Hot Weather  Dallas may see a high temperature for the three days
starting Aug. 1 of 106 degrees Fahrenheit (41 Celsius), 9 above
normal each day, said AccuWeather Inc. in  State College ,
Pennsylvania. The high in  New York City  may be 90 degrees on
Aug. 3, 6 above normal, and Chicago may be 5 above at 87.  Cooling demand in the U.S. will be 18 percent above normal
in the seven days ending Aug. 6, according to Weather
Derivatives in Belton, Missouri.  Power plants  account for 36
percent of gas consumption in the nation, Energy department data
show.  Volume on TransCanada’s  Alberta system , which collects the
output of most of the nation’s gas wells, was 15.8 billion cubic
feet at 2:30 p.m. New York time, below the target of 16.2
billion.  Gas was flowing at a daily rate of 1.99 billion cubic feet
at Empress,  Alberta , where the fuel is transferred to
TransCanada’s main Line.  At McNeil, Saskatchewan, where gas is transferred to the
Northern Border Pipeline for shipment to the Chicago area, the
daily flow rate was 1.92 billion cubic feet.  The available capacity on TransCanada’s British Columbia
system at Kingsgate was 194 million cubic feet today. The system
was forecast to carry 1.82 billion, 90 percent of the estimated
capacity of 2.018 billion.  The volume on  Spectra Energy ’s British Columbia system,
which gathers the fuel in northeastern British Columbia for
delivery to Vancouver and the Pacific Northwest, totaled 2.75
billion cubic feet at 2:35 p.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
