Union Properties PJSC (UPP) , a Dubai-based
developer, posted a first-half profit as it reduces debt and
sees improvement in the emirate’s real-estate market.  The profit was 106 million dirhams for the six months ended
June 30 after a loss of 439 million dirhams a year earlier, the
 company said in a statement  to the Dubai stock market today.
Revenue declined to 1 billion dirhams from 2.25 billion dirhams
last year when the company gained from the sale of Index Tower
and Limestone House in the Dubai International Financial Centre.  “With the real-estate sector on the path of recovery,
together with improved economic indicators in Dubai and the
 United Arab Emirates , Union Properties is currently evaluating
various mid-sized development projects offering shorter
turnaround times and reasonable profitability and incremental
cash inflows,” according to the statement.  The company repaid more than 200 million dirhams after June
30, it said. The total  consolidated bank debt  was 3.8 billion
dirhams at the end of second quarter, compared with 6.2 billion
dirhams in the same period last year.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
