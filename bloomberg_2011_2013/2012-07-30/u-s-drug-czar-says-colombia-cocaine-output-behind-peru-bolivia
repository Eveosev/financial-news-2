Peru and  Bolivia  have become the
world’s largest cocaine producers after Colombian capacity to
produce the drug fell to its lowest since 1994, according to a
U.S. government estimate.  Colombia’s output capacity fell 25 percent last year to 195
metric tons, according a report released in  Washington  today by
Gil Kerlikowske, director of the U.S. Office of National Drug
Control Policy. That’s 72 percent less than a peak of 700 tons
in 2001, the report said. Peru produced 325 tons of cocaine in
2010, while Bolivia produced 265 tons in 2011, according to the
report.  The U.S. estimate follows a report published by  United
Nations Office on Drugs and Crime  last week, which found that
land in  Colombia  dedicated to production of coca, the raw
material for making cocaine,  climbed last year  for the first
time since 2007.  To contact the reporters on this story:
