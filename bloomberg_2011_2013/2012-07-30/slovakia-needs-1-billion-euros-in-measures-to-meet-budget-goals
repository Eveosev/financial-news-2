Slovakia needs to cut spending and
boost revenue by an additional 1 billion euros ($1.23 billion)
to meet its goal for narrowing its budget  deficit  to the
European Union’s limit by 2013, Prime Minister  Robert Fico  said.  The eastern euro-region’s member is missing 500 million
euros to narrow the gap to the targeted 4.6 percent of gross
domestic product this year after planned tax collection fell
short, Fico said at a press conference in Bratislava today. The
same amount must be mustered in 2013 for Slovakia to fulfill its
commitment to the EU to trim the fiscal gap to below 3 percent
of GDP.  To cover the 2012 shortfall, the administration will cut
spending by ministries by 120 million euros, while 235 million
euros will be raised by tax increases and special levies on
selected industries, said Finance Minister Peter Kazimir.
Another 40 million euros will be saved by moving forward a
planned pension overhaul, leaving a need for unspecified
measures worth 105 million euros, he said without elaborating on
steps for the next year.  The second-poorest euro nation is striving to improve its
public finances to protect itself from the region’s debt crisis,
which has already prompted five nations to seek a bailout. Fico,
in power since April, wants to balance the need for about 2
billion euros in austerity measures with his pre-election
pledges to insulate most citizens from their impact.  To contact the reporter on this story:
