Iranian opposition leaders, Mir Hossein Mousavi and Mehdi Karrubi, will remain under house
arrest, where they’ve been detained for more than a year, the
state-run Fars news agency said, citing Prosecutor-General
Gholamhossein Mohseni-Ejei said.  “You can be assured that there won’t be changes in their
situation as they have done wrong to people and created
insecurity in the country,”  Fars  quoted Mohseni-Ejei as saying.
“They are in their homes and aren’t allowed to go out.”  Mousavi and Karrubi were defeated by President  Mahmoud Ahmadinejad  in a 2009 election that sparked nationwide protests
because of allegations of voter fraud. The two have been
described by Iranian authorities as “leaders of the sedition”
and accused of being backed by foreign powers.  Mousavi and Karrubi were put under house arrest in February
2011 after they sought to revive opposition movements by calling
for a rally in solidarity with protesters who brought down
Egyptian President  Hosni Mubarak .  To contact the reporter on this story:
