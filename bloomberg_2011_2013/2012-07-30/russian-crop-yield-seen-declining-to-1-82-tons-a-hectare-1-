Average crop yields in  Russia , the
world’s third biggest wheat exporter, are seen falling to 1.82
metric tons a hectare (2.5 acres) from 2.16 tons last year
because of drought, said ProZerno, a Moscow-based consultancy.  The estimated yields are for the total area sown, which
includes fields where crops were completely lost, Vladimir
Petrichenko, ProZerno’s director, said by phone today.  Drought this month in the Urals area and Siberia made
ProZerno lower its crop forecasts, he said. Russian farmers will
harvest 81 million to 82 million tons of grains, down from a May
estimate of 93.2 million tons.  ProZerno lowered its forecast for the country’s wheat crop
to 44 million to 45 million tons, from a May estimate of 54.2
million tons.  Russia shipped 21.3 million tons of wheat in the last
season that ended June 30, according to the  U.S. Department of
Agriculture . The country is seen falling to fifth place this
season with 12 million tons of exports because of the drought
damage. That would place the country after the U.S., Australia,
 Canada  and the European Union, according to USDA.  Wheat for September delivery rose 1.7 percent to $9.1325 on
the Chicago Board of Trade by 6:23 p.m. Moscow time. It’s
advanced 40 percent so far this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
