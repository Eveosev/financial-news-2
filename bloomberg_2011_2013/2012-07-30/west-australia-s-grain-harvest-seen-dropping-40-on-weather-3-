Grain output in  Western Australia ,
the country’s biggest wheat grower, may drop 40 percent as dry
weather and frost threaten crops just as a drought in the U.S.
pushes prices to the highest since 2008. Futures extended gains.  Total production may be 9 million to 11 million metric tons
in 2012-2013, according to Max Johnson, grain operations manager
at CBH Group, the state’s biggest handler. That compares with a
record harvest of 15 million tons a year earlier. About 65
percent to 70 percent of the crop may be wheat, Johnson said.  Wheat is poised for the biggest monthly gain in two years,
and corn extended a record rally today, as the U.S. drought and
heat waves in  Europe  hurt harvest prospects. Surging prices have
increased concern world food costs will rebound. Wheat yields in
Russia have dropped 31 percent, Interfax reported last week.  “We need an extended rainfall all the way through the end
of September to even try and get it back on track,” Johnson
said by phone from Perth on July 27. “We’ve seen frost after
frost after frost all the way over the Wheatbelt that has
retarded growth or put it in dormancy. That’s hurting us.”  Wheat for September delivery gained as much 2.4 percent to
$9.1975 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade and was at
$9.1525 at 5:35 p.m. in  Singapore , 21 percent higher this month.
The price hit $9.4725 on July 23, the highest since August 2008.
Corn rallied as much as 3 percent to $8.1725 a bushel today.  Cooler Temperatures  Most of Western  Australia  had below-average rainfall from
April to June and has been exceptionally dry in July, according
to  David Jones , the Melbourne-based head of climate monitoring
and prediction at the Bureau of Meteorology. The state also had
cooler-than-normal minimum temperatures in January through June,
according to the bureau. The harvest usually starts in October.  Australia may produce 24.1 million tons of wheat in 2012-
2013, 6.2 percent lower than an earlier estimate, and less than
last year’s record 29.5 million ton crop, the Australian Bureau
of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences said June 13.
Western Australia may harvest 8.7 million tons of wheat from
11.7 million tons a year earlier, it said. In 2010-2011, dry
weather cut Western Australia’s wheat production by 38 percent.  World wheat output may drop to 664.6 million tons in 2012-
2013 from 695.9 million tons in 2011-2012, the International
Grains Council said on July 26. The outlook for  Russia ’s harvest
was cut to 45 million tons from 49 million tons at the start of
the month and down from 56.2 million tons in 2011-2012.  Russian Supply  In Russia, with grain crops gathered from 24 percent of the
sown area, the wheat harvest reached 19.4 million tons, about 11
percent more than a year earlier, the  Agriculture Ministry  said
on its website today. Total grain output was 24.8 million tons
as of July 26, down by about 2 percent, it said.  About 60 percent of U.S. spring wheat was  rated  good or
excellent as of July 22, from 65 percent a week earlier, U.S.
Department of Agriculture data show, while corn is in the worst
shape since 1988. The U.S. is the biggest shipper of both crops.  Surging corn prices prompted  Japan , the largest buyer, to
boost feed-wheat purchases to 334,349 tons in the first five
months of this year, from 62,415 tons a year earlier, according
to data from the  finance ministry .  In Western Australia, the state’s western grain-growing
regions may get as much as 10 millimeters of  rain  in the four
days to Aug. 2, according to the Bureau of Meteorology. “Three
or four weeks of good weather and it could bounce up very
quickly,” Johnson said. “Wheat is a very resilient grain.”  To contact the reporter for this story:
