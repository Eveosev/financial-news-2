Copper fell for the first time in
four sessions as investors awaited signals from central banks
this week on bolstering the faltering global economy.  European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  is attempting
to build consensus for a plan to ease euro-area borrowing costs
amid the region’s debt crisis. Federal Reserve policy makers
meet before a U.S. employment report that may show the pace of
hiring in July failed to reduce the jobless rate.  “A lot of people are taking a wait-and-see attitude ahead
of the meetings and the payrolls report,”  Adam Klopfenstein , a
market strategist at Archer Financial Services Inc. in  Chicago ,
said in a telephone interview. “Copper will rally if we get an
agreement out of Europe, but the market needs to see it. The
table is set, but they’re waiting for the meal to be served.”  Copper futures for September delivery declined 0.3 percent
to settle at $3.416 a pound at 1:14 p.m. on the Comex in  New
York . The metal rose 2.2 percent in the previous three sessions
in the longest rally since mid-June.  A Labor Department report on Aug. 3 is expected to show
U.S. payrolls increased by 100,000 workers, according to the
median forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.
Unemployment is projected to hold at 8.2 percent.  On the  London  Metal Exchange, copper for delivery in three
months fell 0.3 percent to $7,545 a metric ton ($3.42 a pound).  Aluminum, nickel, tin, lead and zinc advanced in London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
