KT Corp. (030200) , South Korea’s largest
phone and Internet company, fell the most in seven months in
Seoul trading after saying its customer data were leaked.  KT declined 3 percent to 32,000 won at the close of trading
on the Korea Exchange, its steepest drop since Dec. 28. The
benchmark  Kospi index  added 0.8 percent.  Personal information of KT’s mobile-phone subscribers was
leaked by hackers and the data were subsequently recovered, the
Seongnam, South Korea-based company said in a statement
yesterday. KT asked police to investigate possible leaks of
customer data on July 13 after spotting suspicious activities
through internal monitoring, the carrier said.  “The data leakage news is hurting investors’ sentiment
today,” Yang Jong In, an analyst at Korea Investment &
Securities Co. in Seoul, said by telephone. “It’s still very
premature to talk about what kind of impact it could have on the
company’s fundamentals.”  Initech Co. (053350) , a developer of equipment and software for
computer data security, gained 5 percent to 3,890 won.  SoftForum
Co. (054920) , which markets data security-related products, rose 3.1
percent to 2,480 won.  KT shares  have fallen 10 percent this year, compared with a
1 percent gain for the  Kospi index. (KOSPI)   To contact the reporters on this story:
