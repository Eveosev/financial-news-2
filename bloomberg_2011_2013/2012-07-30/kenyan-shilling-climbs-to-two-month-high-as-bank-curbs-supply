Kenya ’s shilling gained to a two-
month high as the central bank boosted by threefold the amount
of currency it withdraws from the market using  repurchase
agreements  and term-auction deposits.  The currency of East Africa’s largest economy appreciated
0.9 percent to 83.47 a dollar at 3:19 p.m., in Nairobi the
capital, the strongest since May 9 on a closing basis.  Kenya Central Bank accepted about 9 billion shillings ($108
million) of repurchase agreements and term-auction deposits
today, compared with 3 billion shillings accepted July 27,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “The shilling has been stable, propped up by the central
bank’s tight monetary stance,” Nairobi-based  NIC Bank Ltd. (NICB)  said
a note to clients today.  The Tanzanian shilling gained 0.3 percent to 1,580 per
dollar, while Uganda’s shilling weakened 0.2 percent to trade at
2,482.50 versus the U.S. currency.  To contact the reporter on this story:
