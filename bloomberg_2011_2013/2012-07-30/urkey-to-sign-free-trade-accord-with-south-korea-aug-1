Turkey  will sign a free-trade
agreement with South Korea on Aug. 1, paving the way to duty-
free bilateral commerce, according to Turkish Economy Minister
Zafer Caglayan.  The deal, to be signed in Ankara, will enable Turkish
exporters to sell products to South Korea, whose imports were
valued at $524 billion in 2011, on a preferred-partner basis,
Caglayan said in an e-mailed statement yesterday.  Caglayan said 93 percent of Turkish goods sold to South
Korea will be duty-free after the accord takes effect. The
agreement will help Turkey close its  trade gap  with South Korea,
which is selling 12 times more goods to Turkey than its Turkish
purchases, he said. The two countries will have 10 years to
abolish  customs duties  on their bilateral trade, he said.  The agreement will bring Turkish exporters to an equal
level with those from the European Union and the U.S., which
signed similar deals with South Korea that took effect in July
2011 and March 15, respectively, Caglayan said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
