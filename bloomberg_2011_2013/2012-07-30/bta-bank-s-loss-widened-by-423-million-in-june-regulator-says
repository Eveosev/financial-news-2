BTA Bank (BTAS) , Kazakhstan’s biggest
lender before defaulting on $12 billion of debt in 2009,
extended its year-to-date loss last month amid plans to
restructure debt for the second time in as many years.  The net loss widened by 63.5 billion tenge ($423 million)
from May to 1.371 trillion tenge in the year through June, the
central bank’s financial oversight committee said in a monthly
 report  on its website. Liabilities of 2.66 trillion tenge
exceeded assets by 1.21 trillion tenge, according to the Almaty-
based regulator.  BTA said talks began last month on its proposed debt
overhaul with the creditors’ steering committee after the state-
owned lender failed to make an interest payment on its July 2018
dollar bonds in January.  Kazakhstan ’s third-largest lender by
assets on July 16 filed for creditor protection under Chapter 15
of the U.S. bankruptcy code for the second time in about two and
a half years.  BTA Bank didn’t immediately reply to an e-mailed request
for comments.  The following table shows the six-month performance of
Kazakhstan’s five largest lenders by assets, along with seventh-
ranked Alliance Bank and 13th-ranked Temirbank, and their
position as of July 1. The data from the oversight committee are
in billions of tenge:  To contact the reporter on this story:
