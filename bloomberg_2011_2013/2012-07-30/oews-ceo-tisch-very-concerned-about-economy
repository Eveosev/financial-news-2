Loews Corp. (L)  fell the most since
August as Chief Executive Officer James Tisch said he’s “very
concerned” about the global economy after profit fell for a
third-straight quarter.  Loews slumped 5.2 percent to $39.54 at 4 p.m. in New York.
The company has gained 5 percent this year, compared with the 10
percent advance in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  “In the United States, we’ve got 1.5 percent economic
growth, the euro zone is not growing, the emerging markets are
not emerging as fast as they had been before,” Tisch said today
on a conference call to discuss Loews’ quarterly results. “You
don’t see anybody expressing optimism about what’s going on in
the economy either here in the  United States  or overseas.”  Loews has been pursuing growth at subsidiaries that sell
insurance, manage hotels and produce energy. Second-quarter
profit at the New York-based company  fell  78 percent to $56
million as the company took an impairment at its HighMount
Exploration & Production LLC tied to lower natural gas prices.  “I’m very concerned” about the global economy, Tisch said
today. “I find it actually quite extraordinary that we find
ourselves with attractive investment opportunities at the
subsidiary level in view of just how poorly I think the  U.S.
economy  and the global economy is doing.”  Insurance unit  CNA Financial Corp. (CNA)  completed its
acquisition of Hardy Underwriting Bermuda Ltd. this month to
expand internationally. In June, Loews’ hotel subsidiary bought
the Renaissance Hotel & Spa in Hollywood,  California , from CIM
Group.  To contact the reporter on this story:
