The corn harvest in  Brazil , the
worldâ€™s third-largest producer, will resume no later than Aug. 1
in the states of Parana and Mato Grosso as rains stop, Somar
Meteorologia said.  The weather has allowed Brazil to increase the productivity
of corn this season, where the farmers are averaging 90 60-
kilogram (132-pound) bags a hectare (2.5 acres), the weather
forecaster Somar said in an e-mailed report today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
