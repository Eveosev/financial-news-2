Seychelles Petroleum Co. is losing
14 million rupees ($1 million) a month on its oil tanker
business, Le Seychellois Hebdo said, citing a report by the
Office of the Auditor General.  The total loss at the state-owned company has risen to 630
million rupees, the weekly reported. It triggered the
resignation earlier this week of Chief Executive Officer Guy
Adam after he opposed a government plan to sell two of the
companyâ€™s five tankers, according to the newspaper.  Seychelles Petroleum invested 2.65 billion rupees over the
past 10 years, according to the report. The tanker business
faces its worst market conditions in 25 years because of an
oversupply of ships, the weekly said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
