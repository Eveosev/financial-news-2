Chinese Vice President  Xi Jinping 
expects his country’s economy to expand by 8.5 percent this year
and for there to be no “drastic fall” in the growth rate,
 Irish Times reported , citing an interview.  Xi, who begins a visit to Ireland today, said the slowing
of Chinese growth has been to a large extent because of the
government’s measures to help reduce pressure on prices, energy
and resources, Xi was cited as saying.  China will maintain “stable and relatively fast economic
growth for a fairly long period of time,” Xi said, according to
the newspaper.  To contact the reporters on this story:
