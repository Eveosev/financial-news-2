Rabobank Groep (RABO)  plans to begin
evaluating mortgage loan applications at the corporate level
rather than at the group’s member banks,  Volkskrant  reported.  The move announced yesterday by the bank is a consequence
of a 2009 investigation of the country’s four biggest mortgage
lenders by the AFM, the Dutch financial markets regulator, which
had fined Rabobank 150,000 euros ($197,000) over granting
excessively high  mortgage loans , the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
