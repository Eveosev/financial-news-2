Hamas authorities rejected an
Egyptian proposal to bring in fuel via an Israeli crossing point
to reactivate Gaza’s only power plant, which shut down four days
ago when diesel supplies were disrupted.  “This is unacceptable because of our bitter experience
with the Zionist occupation and the way it controls the delivery
of the shipments,” Ahmed Abu Al-Amreen of the Hamas-run Energy
Authority, told reporters.  Diesel for the plant came from  Israel  until last year when
Hamas started to buy cheaper fuel from  Egypt , bringing it via a
network of underground tunnels. Egypt is bound by agreements
with Israel and cannot ship diesel to Gaza directly through the
Rafah crossing point, which is limited to the movement of
individuals.  Hamas warned this week that hospitals are running out of
fuel for generators and food shortages are likely as
manufacturers may be forced to halt production. Abu Al-Amreen
said that Hamas proposed bringing the Egyptian fuel via Rafah or
direct underground pipelines.  To contact the reporter on this story:
