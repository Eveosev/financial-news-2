Kllmarnock beat Rangers 1-0 to hand
the Scottish Premier League champion a defeat in its first game
since entering a form of bankruptcy.  Kilmarnock’s Dean Shiels scored the only goal in the 11th
minute at Ibrox Stadium in Glasgow. Rangers’ Sasha Papic
received a red card just before halftime for a challenge on Liam
Kelly.  Owner  Craig Whyte  put Rangers, which has won a record 54
Scottish titles, into administration four days ago as U.K. tax
authorities chase the club over an unpaid tax bill.  The move brought a 10-point penalty, dropping second-place
Rangers 14 points behind rival Celtic, which plays Hibernian
tomorrow. Third-place Motherwell beat Hearts 3-0 to pull within
six points of Rangers, which has played one more game.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
