English Championship soccer club
Leeds United have appointed  Neil Warnock  as manager until the
end of next season.  In a statement on the club’s website, Leeds Chairman Ken
Bates said the appointment “is arguably the most important we
have made.”  Warnock, who was sacked by Premier League side Queen’s Park
Rangers last month, said: “I feel I have one big challenge left
in me and believe Leeds is a club that should be in the Premier
League.”  Leeds are currently in 11th place in the second-division
Championship.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
