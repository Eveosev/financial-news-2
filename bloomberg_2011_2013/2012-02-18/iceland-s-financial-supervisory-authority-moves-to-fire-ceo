Iceland’s Financial Supervisory
Authority moved to fire Gunnar Andersen, the watchdog’s chief
executive, following an internal probe into his prior
involvement with offshore holding companies owned by failed
lender Landsbanki Islands hf, according to the  FSA ’s chairman.  “He has until the end of Monday to respond to a letter of
resignation” given to him today, Chairman Adalsteinn Leifsson,
said in a telephone interview late yesterday. “Once the board
has reviewed his response a final decision on his termination
will be taken, as early as Tuesday.”  Iceland’s state broadcaster RUV reported in November that
Andersen had been actively involved with offshore holding
companies owned by  Landsbanki (LAIS)  in 2001. Andersen, who denies the
allegations, was appointed CEO in April 2009.  That report led to an internal investigation with the
regulator, which probed whether Andersen was fit to carry out
his duties for the FSA.  “I can confirm that I’ve received a termination letter,”
said Andersen in an interview. “This follows the reporting by
 RUV , which was factually wrong.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
