Iranian warships have entered the
Mediterranean Sea for the second time since the revolution in
1979, the  British Broadcasting Corp.  reported.  A destroyer and its supply vessel passed through the  Suez
Canal  and their destination is unclear, the BBC said. An Iranian
navy admiral said the mission showed the might of Iran and the
countryâ€™s message of peace, the BBC reported, citing the
official  Islamic Republic News Agency .  Iranian vessels sailed into the Mediterranean a year ago in
a move that Israel said was a provocation, the BBC said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
