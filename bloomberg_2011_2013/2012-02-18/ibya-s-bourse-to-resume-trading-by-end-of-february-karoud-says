The Libyan Stock Exchange will allow
foreign ownership of more than 10 percent and will resume
trading by the end of February after an armed rebellion against
the regime of  Muammar Qaddafi  forced it to close, Chairman Ahmed
Karoud said.  About seven to eight companies are expected to trade by the
end of the month from the total of 13 listed entities, Karoud
told  Al Arabiya  in a telephone interview today.  The return in trading was delayed by liquidity-related
problems in the market and the impact of the war, he said. An
investment fund will be rolled out in June to be followed by
another in the second half of the year, Karoud said.  The bourse has 13 listed companies, including the exchange
itself, with a combined market capitalization of about 3.9
billion dinars ($3.1 billion), Karoud told Bloomberg News in a
Sept. 28 interview. The biggest companies include Gumhouria
Bank, Sahara Bank and Wahda Bank, which together account for
about half of the market capitalization. Foreigners own less
than 1 percent of the shares listed on the bourse, Karoud said
at the time.  To contact the reporters on this story:
