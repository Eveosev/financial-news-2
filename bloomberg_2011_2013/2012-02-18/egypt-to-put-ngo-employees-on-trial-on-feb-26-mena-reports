Egypt  will start the trial of 43
people, including 19 U.S. citizens, on Feb. 26 for breaking
rules on foreign financing of NGOs, the official Middle East
News Agency reported, citing a court announcement in Cairo.  Non-governmental organization workers from  Germany , Serbia,
 Norway , Jordan and the Palestinian territories, as well as 16
Egyptians, are among those charged,  the news service  said.  Americans charged in the case include Cairo staff from the
National Democratic Institute and the International Republican
Institute, allied with the two main U.S. political parties.
Among them is Sam LaHood, son of Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood. U.S. leaders have urged Egypt, a close military ally and
recipient of some $2 billion a year in aid for the past three
decades, to reconsider the case.  To contact the reporter on this story:
