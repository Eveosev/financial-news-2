Belgian Budget Minister Olivier Chastel has ruled out increasing value-added tax and corporation
tax to help meet the countryâ€™s 2012 deficit goal,  La Libre
Belgique reported , citing an interview.  Chastel is considering measures including cutting costs of
government administration and a tax on airline tickets to fill a
budget hole that may be as much as 2.5 billion euros ($3.3
billion), the newspaper said. The hole must be closed if the
country is to meet a target set by the European Union for
 Belgium  to reduce its deficit to 2.8 percent of gross domestic
product this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
