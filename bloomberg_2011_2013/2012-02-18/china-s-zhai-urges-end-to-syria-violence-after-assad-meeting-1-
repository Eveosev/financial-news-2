China ’s vice foreign minister, Zhai Jun, urged  Syria  to end violence and restore stability after a
meeting with President Bashar al-Assad.  Zhai, speaking at a press conference in Damascus today,
backed Assad’s proposed referendum on a new democratic
constitution, set for Feb. 26, according to the Chinese state
news agency Xinhua.  China and  Russia  vetoed a resolution at the  United Nations
Security Council  earlier this month calling on Assad to step
down in favor of an interim government that would hold
elections. The UN estimated more than 5,400 Syrians had died by
the end of last year as Assad cracked down on protests that
began in March.  Syrian security forces opened fire today in the Maza
neighborhood of Damascus, where thousands had rallied for the
funeral of civilians killed yesterday, and carried out arrests
in the southern province of Daraa and the eastern town of Deir
al-Zour, the U.K.-based  Syrian Observatory for Human Rights 
said. At least five people were killed today, following a toll
of 31 yesterday, it said. Machine gun fire was heard in Aleppo,
where the army is conducting sweeps.  The U.S., European Union and  Arab League , which backed the
resolution vetoed by China and Russia, will attend a “Friends
of Syria” meeting in Tunisia next week aimed at coordinating
support for the opposition to Assad.  To contact the reporters on this story:
