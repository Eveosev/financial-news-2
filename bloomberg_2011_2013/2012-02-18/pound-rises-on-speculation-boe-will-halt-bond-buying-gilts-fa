The pound gained versus the dollar,
euro and yen this week as the  Bank of England  increased its
inflation forecasts, prompting speculation policy makers will
refrain from further expanding their bond-purchase program.  Sterling climbed to a three-month high versus  Japan ’s
currency after a government report showed retail sales
unexpectedly increased in January and central bank Governor
Mervyn King said the economy should “gradually” recover. Gilts
fell amid bets the central bank will curtail its asset purchases
and as demand declined at a bond auction.  “It has become extremely popular to scale back
expectations for more quantitative easing and announce that the
BOE is done on bond buying,” which is supporting the pound,
said  John Hydeskov , chief analyst at Danske Bank A/S in London.
“The BOE has been slightly over-interpreted by the market, and
I still think the pound will weaken.”  The U.K. currency advanced 0.4 percent this week to $1.5819
as of 4:43 p.m.  London  time yesterday, extending its rally over
the past five weeks to 3.3 percent. Sterling rose 0.7 percent to
83.15 pence per euro. The currency jumped 2.6 percent to 125.47
yen after reaching 125.71 yen, the strongest since Nov. 7.  Slower Inflation  Bank of England policy makers see U.K. inflation slowing to
the 2 percent target by year-end and easing to 1.8 percent in
two years, according to the Inflation Report published Feb. 15.
The central bank on Feb. 9 kept its  benchmark rate  at a record
low 0.5 percent and boosted its asset-purchase target by 50
billion pounds to 325 billion pounds to underpin the economy.
Minutes of the meeting will be released on Feb. 22.  “The inflation profile has been revised up materially,”
said  Sam Hill , a fixed-income strategist at  RBC Capital Markets 
in London. “Consequently, while the door remains open to
further asset purchases beyond the current 325 billion pound
target, there is no strong bias in that direction.”  Britain’s currency rose 0.5 percent over the week,
according to Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes, which track
10 developed-nation currencies, trimming its year-to-date loss
to 0.8 percent.  The  yield  on the 10-year gilt rose eight basis points this
week to 2.19 percent. The 3.75 percent bond maturing in
September 2021 fell 0.72, or 7.20 pounds per 1,000-pound face
amount, to 113.4.  Demand fell when the government auctioned 1.75 billion
pounds of bonds on Feb. 16. Investors bid for 1.62 times the
amount of the September 2034 debt allotted, down from 2.23 times
the previous time the bonds were sold in August.  The U.K. probably posted the widest  budget surplus  in four
years in January, the biggest tax-collection month of the year.
The surplus of 6.3 billion pounds compares with 5.2 billion
pounds a year earlier, according to the median estimate of
economists surveyed by Bloomberg before the Feb. 21 report.  Gilts have handed investors a 1.8 percent loss this year,
while German  government bonds  have slipped 0.4 percent,
according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
