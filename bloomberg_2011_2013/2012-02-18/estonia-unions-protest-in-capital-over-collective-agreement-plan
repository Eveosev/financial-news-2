More than a thousand Estonian
workers marched and staged a rally in the center of the capital
Tallinn to protest government plans to make it easier for
employers to terminate collective agreements.  Protesters, many of whom were representatives of the mainly
Russian-speaking mining and energy workers’ unions from
northeastern  Estonia , today carried slogans through Tallinn’s
medieval old town saying “For a decent life,” and “Workers
won’t let themselves be fooled.”  The government “keeps demonstrating a reckless and
patronizing attitude toward workers,” Harri Taliga, the
chairman of the  Confederation of Estonian Trade Unions , said in
a speech at the rally.  Draft legislation that’s cleared the first of three
parliamentary readings would stop collective agreements from
running indefinitely, which the Justice Chancellor has ruled
unconstitutional, according to an explanatory letter on the
 legislature’s website . Lawmakers have ignored the unions’
proposals to keep the main terms of a terminated agreement valid
for a transition period, harming workers’ rights, Taliga said
yesterday in a phone interview.  The unions plan to hold protests at their workplaces next
week and will begin strikes on March 5. The action will peak
with a strike of teachers and daycare workers, starting March 7,
which may be supported by other unions, according to Taliga.  To contact the reporter on this story:
