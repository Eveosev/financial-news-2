Carmelo Anthony’s return for the  New
York Knicks  has been pushed back again because of continuing
problems with a groin injury that now has sidelined him for six
games.  Anthony, 27, was injured early in a Feb. 6 game against
Utah, the first career start for Jeremy Lin.  New York coach  Mike D’Antoni  said Anthony experienced “a
little bit of tightness” in the groin in practice yesterday and
that he will not play tonight against the New Orleans Hornets at
New York’s Madison Square Garden.  “We have a lot of games coming up,” D’Antoni told
reporters before the game. “We’ve waited this long, we can wait
until he’s 100 percent.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
