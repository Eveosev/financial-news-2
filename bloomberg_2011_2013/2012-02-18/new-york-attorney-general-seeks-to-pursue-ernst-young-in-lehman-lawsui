Ernst & Young LLP, former auditor of
bankrupt  Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (LEHMQ) , should “disgorge” $125
million in fees earned in an alleged fraud that used so-called
Repo 105 transanscations to conceal tens of billions of dollars
in debt, New York officials said in a court filing.  New York Attorney General  Eric Schneiderman  made the filing
in U.S. District Court in Manhattan today after the auditing
firm tried to get the suit dismissed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
