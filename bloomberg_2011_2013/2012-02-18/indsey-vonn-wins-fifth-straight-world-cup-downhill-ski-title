Lindsey Vonn  of the U.S. clinched
her fifth consecutive women’s World Cup skiing downhill title
with a third-place finish today in Russia.  Germany’s Maria Hoefl-Riesch won the race in 1 minute,
49.17 seconds on the course to be used for the 2014 Sochi Winter
Olympics. Austria’s Elisabeth Goergl was second, 0.43 seconds
behind.  Vonn, 27, leads Hoefl-Riesch by 231 points in the downhill
standings with just two races, worth a maximum 100 points each,
remaining in the season.  Vonn’s five straight downhill titles ties the record set by
Austria’s Annemarie Moeser-Proell from 1971-75. She also joins
Moeser-Proell (who won seven), Renate Goetschl and Franz Klammer
as the only skiers to claim five championships in the
discipline.  “It means a lot to me to be able to have the numbers that
those legends of skiing have,” Vonn said on the U.S. Ski Team’s
website. “But Moeser-Proell is the pinnacle of our sport and I
have a ways to go before that.”  Vonn now leads  Tina Maze  by 448 points in the overall  World
Cup  standings after the Slovenian could only finish 12th today.  Austria’s Marcel Hirscher moved to the top of the men’s
giant slalom standings by winning in Bansko, Bulgaria.  Hirscher finished in 2:25.35 to claim his seventh victory
of the season. Italy’s Massimiliano Blardone was second, ahead
of Austrian Marcel Mathis.  Hirscher now trails leader  Ivica Kostelic  of Croatia by 118
points in the overall World Cup standings and second-placed Beat
Feuz of Switzerland by 48 points. Kostelic and Feuz did not
compete in today’s race.  To contact the reporter on this story:
