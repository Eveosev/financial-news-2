A militant Islamic sect in  Nigeria ,
Boko Haram, was suspected in the deaths yesterday of a Muslim
cleric in Konduga, Borno state, and the district head of Geidam
in Yobe state, police officials said.  Police are investigating the killings and no arrests have
been made, spokesman Samuel Tizhe said by telephone today from
Maiduguri, the capital of Borno. Yobe police chief Tanko Lawan
confirmed the killing of the district head today by phone from
Damaturu, the capital.  Authorities in Nigeria,  Africa ’s top oil producer, blame
Boko Haram, which draws inspiration from Afghanistan’s Taliban
movement, for a wave of bombings and attacks targeting security
officials and government buildings in the mainly Muslim north
and Abuja, the capital, since 2009.  Boko Haram, which means “Western education is a sin,”
says it’s fighting to establish Islamic Sharia law across the
West African nation. The group claimed responsibility for
multiple blasts and attacks in the city of Kano on Jan. 20 that
killed at least 256 people, according to the  Civil Rights
Congress .  To contact the reporter on this story:
