A proposal to cut the size of the
Afghan security forces by more than a third after 2014 could
lead to catastrophe, said Abdul Rahim Wardak,  Afghanistan ’s
defense minister, the Wall Street Journal reported.  The U.S. proposes to cut troop levels in the country by 35
percent to 230,000, a reduction confirmed by U.S. commander of
the NATO Training Mission-Afghanistan Daniel Bolger, an army
lieutenant general, the newspaper said. The smaller Afghan force
will cost $4.1 billion a year, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
