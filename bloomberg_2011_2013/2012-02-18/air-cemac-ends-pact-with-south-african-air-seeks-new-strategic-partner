Air Cemac, a proposed airline for
the Central African region, said it terminated an air service
agreement with  South African Airways  and seeks to find a new
strategic partner within a month.  The accord ended because of deep differences of opinion
with SAA, Air Cemac said today in a statement following an
extraordinary general meeting.  Cameroon, the Republic of Congo, the Central African
Republic, Gabon,  Equatorial Guinea  and Chad, which are
shareholders in Air Cemac, agreed to base the airline in
Brazzaville, Congo, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
