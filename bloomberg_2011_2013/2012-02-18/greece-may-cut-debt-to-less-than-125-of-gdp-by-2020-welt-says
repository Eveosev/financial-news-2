Greece  may cut its debt to less than
125 percent of the country’s gross domestic product by 2020 as a
second aid package is being negotiated,  Die Welt  reported,
citing unidentified people involved in the talks.  The new framework for Greece’s debt sustainability should
be submitted to the so-called troika -- the  International
Monetary Fund , European Commission and European Central Bank --
in the course of next week, the German newspaper said, citing
the unidentified people. A debt reduction to less than 125
percent of the GDP would be close to the debt-cutting target of
120 percent set by the troika, Die Welt said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
