Tottenham manager  Harry Redknapp  has
vowed to stay at Tottenham through the end of the season, the
 Daily Express  said.  Redknapp is favored to replace Fabio Capello as England
manager and has appealed to the Football Association to wait
until May before making an announcement. The Premier League
season ends May 13, with the 2012 European Championship starting
on June 8.  “Whoever they go for, they will probably be in a job
anyway so it’s going to be difficult for them to walk out of
their clubs at this stage of the year,” the Express quoted
Redknapp as saying. “I couldn’t do anything or go anywhere
now.”  Redknapp has led Tottenham to third place in the Premier
League this season, seven point behind leader  Manchester City 
and five back of second-place Manchester United.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
