London’s financial district is an
asset for all of Europe, not just Great Britain, U.K. Prime
Minister  David Cameron  said, according to an interview published
in  Le Figaro .  While the banking system needs to be reformed, restoring
economic health won’t be possible without financial services,
which are essential for businesses and indispensable for
sustaining the real economy, Cameron said, according to the
French newspaper today. It doesn’t make sense to demonize
finance, he said in the interview.  Quitting the European Union wouldn’t be in the U.K.’s
interest, Cameron also said, according to Le Figaro.  To contact the reporter on this story:
