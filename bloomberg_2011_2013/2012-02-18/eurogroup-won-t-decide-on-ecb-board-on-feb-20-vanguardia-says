Euro-area finance chiefs won’t take
a decision on the replacement of Jose Manuel Gonzalez-Paramo on
the  European Central Bank ’s board during a meeting in Brussels
Feb. 20 and will postpone the decision to March,  La Vanguardia 
reported, citing European Union officials it didn’t name.  No consensus has been reached on a candidate to replace
Gonzalez-Paramo, the newspaper said, citing the officials.  Spain  refuses to withdraw its candidate, Antonio Sainz de
Vicuna, who is the head of the ECB’s legal department, La
Vanguardia said, citing an official at Spain’s Economy Ministry
it didn’t name. Unlike France, which supports Sainz de Vicuna,
Germany hasn’t said whether it’ll back him, the official told
the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
