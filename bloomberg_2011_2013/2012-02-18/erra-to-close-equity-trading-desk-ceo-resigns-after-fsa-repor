Terra Gruppen AS Chief Executive
Officer Stein Ole Larsen resigned yesterday and Terra will cut
its equity trading desk after the Norwegian Financial
Supervisory Authority criticized the management of the unit.  The equity trading desk and associated equity analysis
operations will be closed after a preliminary report from the
FSA identified “serious deficiencies” in the management of
Terra’s stockbroking unit Terra Securities AS, the Oslo-based
company said in a  statement  on its website yesterday. Larsen’s
resignation was accepted by the board, which appointed Hege Toft Karlsen, a former executive vice-president at Gjensidige
Forsikring ASA, as acting CEO, it said.  “These developments have taken place against the
background of weaknesses revealed in Terra Markets by an audit
conducted last June by the Financial Supervisory Authority of
 Norway ,” Terra said in the statement. Terra won’t make any
further statements until the regulator presents its final
report, it said.  Terra Gruppen is an alliance of 79 independent banks and
Oslo Bolig Og Sparelag that offers financial services to banks
through its subsidiaries.  To contact the reporter on this story:
