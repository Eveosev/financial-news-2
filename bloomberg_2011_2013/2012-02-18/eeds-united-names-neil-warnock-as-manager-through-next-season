Leeds United hired  Neil Warnock  as
manager to replace the fired Simon Grayson, the club said in a
 statement  on its website.  Warnock, 63, signed a contract until the end of next
season. Grayson was fired Feb. 1 after three seasons in charge.
Leeds is 10th in the 24-team second-tier Championship after
today’s 3-2 win over Donacster Rovers, three points out of a
playoff spot and 11 points behind league leader Southampton.  “We believe the appointment is arguably the most important
we have made,” Leeds Chairman Ken Bates said. “The objective
was to appoint a manager who has a proven track record of
getting teams promoted and in Neil we have a man whose record is
second to none.”  Warnock returns to the Championship, where he led Queens
Park Rangers to the title last season and promotion to the
Premier League. He was fired by QPR on Jan. 8 after an eight-
match winless run which saw the team drop to 17th place, one
above the three relegation places.  “I feel I have one big challenge left in me and believe
Leeds is a club that should be in the Premier League,” Warnock
said. “I want to be the man who is able to deliver this for a
set of fans who never cease to amaze me with their numbers and
their loyalty.”  Interim manager Neil Redfearn led Leeds in today’s victory
over Doncaster. He’ll return to his role at the club’s academy
next week, Leeds said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
