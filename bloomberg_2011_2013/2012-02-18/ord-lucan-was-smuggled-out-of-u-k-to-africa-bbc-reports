Richard John Bingham, a missing
aristocrat known as Lord Lucan who was declared dead in 1999
after disappearing 25 years earlier, was smuggled out of the
U.K., the  BBC  reported, citing two people with knowledge of the
matter.  An unidentified woman who worked for Lucan’s friend John
Aspinall said she arranged for his children to fly to Africa
while Bob Polkinghorne, a former detective inspector, said there
was a sighting on the continent by a “reliable witness” that
was never followed, the  BBC  said today. Bingham was known for
his high-society lifestyle and gambling and disappeared in 1974
after his family’s nanny was murdered.  To contact the reporter on this story:
