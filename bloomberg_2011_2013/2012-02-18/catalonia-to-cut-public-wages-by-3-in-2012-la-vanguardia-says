Catalonia,  Spain ’s largest region,
will cut the wages of at least 165,000 workers in the public
sector by 3 percent this year to save about 180 million euros
($237 million),  La Vanguardia  reported, citing an unnamed
official.  The regional government had previously planned to cut wages
by as much as 5 percent and doesn’t rule out further cuts this
year, according to the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
