Detroit (9845MF)  firefighters reached a
tentative deal with the city to help avoid a $200 million
deficit and a possible state takeover.  Unions representing municipal employees have agreed to
concessions including a 10 percent pay cut and reductions in
health care and pension benefits. The agreement allows employees
to recoup some pay if the city of 714,000 has a surplus. Police
also reached a tentative settlement. Union members, including
the 1,014 who belong to the Detroit Fire Fighters Association,
still must ratify all the agreements.  “This tentative agreement achieved necessary cost-savings
through staffing and operational improvements without
compromising public safety,” Mayor Dave Bing said in a news
release today. “In addition to this tentative agreement, I am
especially pleased with the union’s efforts in resolving long-
standing arbitration issues.”  Bing has begun dismissing 1,000 employees and has called
for givebacks from labor to save $360 million through June 30,
2013.  It isn’t clear how much the concessions would save and
whether they’re enough to head off state action. A review team
is investigating city finances to determine whether it needs an
emergency manager with broad powers to cut spending in the home
of  General Motors Co. (GM)  The team must report to Governor  Rick Snyder  by March.  To contact the reporter on this story:
