Andreas Schmitz, president of the
BdB Association of German Banks, said countries which
continually fail to fulfill criteria of the eurozone’s stability
accord should drop out of the “premier league,”  Rheinische
Post said , citing an interview with the manager.  Greece  needs a debt reduction of at least 50 percent and
banks that don’t have enough capital need to be provided with
more money, Schmitz said, according to the German newspaper.  Pumping more liquidity into the market won’t lead to
inflation in the next two to three years because there is no
room for price increases in a weakening global economy, Schmitz
told the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
