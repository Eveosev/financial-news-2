The euro-region debt crisis is going
“real damage” to economies, British Chancellor of the
Exchequer  George Osborne  told reporters today as he arrived at a
meeting of his European Union counterparts in Brussels. “What
we’re going to be arguing for is a comprehensive solution to
this crisis. We’ve had enough of short-term sticking plasters
that get us through the next few weeks,” he said. “It’s the
single biggest thing that could boost the British economy this
autumn.” Britain does not use the euro as its currency.  To contact the reporter on this story:
