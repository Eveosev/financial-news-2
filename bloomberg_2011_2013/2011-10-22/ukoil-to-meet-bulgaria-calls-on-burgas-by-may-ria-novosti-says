OAO Lukoil plans to meet the
Bulgarian government’s requirements over its Neftochim Burgas
refinery by next May, Ria Novosti reported, citing Vadim Vorobyov, vice president of the Russian energy company.  Bulgaria withdrew the plant’s licenses in July after the
 Finance Ministry  accused Lukoil of failing to install the gauges
used by the authorities to calculate excise duty remotely.
Output resumed in August after Lukoil won a court case, the  news
agency  reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
