California  warned 26,000 prison
employees that they could lose their jobs as part of a plan to
ease inmate overcrowding and shift responsibility for thousands
of criminals to county lockups.  The notices were sent today to guards and employees who
have less than 10 years on the job, said Paul Verke, a spokesman
for the Corrections and Rehabilitation Department. Not all
26,000 employees will be fired.  The state on Oct. 1 began to shift responsibility for those
convicted of nonviolent, low-level crimes from state control to
county jails and local probation under a plan by Governor  Jerry Brown  to reduce prison crowding and cut spending.  “The 26,000 figure is casting a wide net,” Verke said.
“They are the people who could be affected by this. People may
have to transfer or go to a lower-paying classification or
eventually leave.”  California, which slashed spending on schools and the poor
this year to erase a $26 billion projected deficit, runs the
nation’s largest correctional system, with about  161,000 
inmates. The U.S. Supreme Court, citing overcrowding and
inadequate health care, ordered the state to reduce the prison
population by 33,000 in two years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
