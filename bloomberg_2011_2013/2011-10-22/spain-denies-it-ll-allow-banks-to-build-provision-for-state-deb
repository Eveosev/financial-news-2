Spain  won’t allow any requirement
for banks to put aside a provision for its government debt, a
Finance Ministry spokesman said, denying a report in  El Mundo .  The Spanish government is opposed to banks being told to
make such a provision, according to the spokesman, who asked not
to be named, in line with the department’s policy. Such a move
would increase lenders’ need for possible recapitalization.  El Mundo cited unidentified people familiar with the matter
as saying the government may agree to a provision of about 5
percent of a bank’s face-value holdings in Spanish  government
bonds .  Spain would accept the measure as the European Banking
Authority seeks to agree a recapitalization of the region’s
lenders that’s credible for investors, the Madrid-based
newspaper said. The government debt has been assessed at its
nominal value so banks haven’t had to reflect the variations in
market prices, El Mundo said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
