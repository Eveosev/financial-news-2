Sanofi’s experimental drug Lemtrada
worked better than an older medicine in preventing relapses from
multiple sclerosis after two years, the company said.  A late-stage clinical trial comparing Lemtrada to  Merck
KGaA (MRK) ’s Rebif showed that 78 percent of the patients taking
Lemtrada were relapse free after two years, compared with 59
percent who received Rebif, Paris-based Sanofi said in a
statement today.  Sanofi reported preliminary results from the trial, dubbed
CARE-MS I, in July. The company said then that Lemtrada cut
relapse rates by 55 percent over two years compared with Rebif.
The study is being presented today at a medical conference in
Amsterdam.  Results from a second advanced-stage clinical trial for
Lemtrada will be available before the end of the year, Sanofi
said. The company plans to seek regulatory approval for the drug
in the U.S. and European Union in the first quarter of 2012,
Sanofi said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
