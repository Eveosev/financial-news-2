European Union finance ministers are
recommending creation of a “large and credible firewall” in
proposals being sent to EU leaders, Polish Finance Minister
Jacek Rostowski said.  After a “very constructive meeting” today in Brussels,
Rostowski said the finance ministers “will forward consensus
proposals and these have to be part of comprehensive package.”  “One element of that is the creation of large and credible
firewall to prevent contagion,” Rostowski said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
