Frank-Juergen Weise, head of
 Germany ’s labor agency, expects unemployment to fall further,
albeit at a slower pace,  Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung  said,
citing an interview with Weise.  In the best case scenario, unemployment may fall to close
to 2.6 million, Weise said, according to the German newspaper.
If there’s a renewed need for shorter working hours, the agency
would have to borrow money, Weise told FAZ. The 17 billion euros
($24 billion) that the agency had in reserve before the last
crisis has been used up, he told the newspaper.  The agency will cut its own staff by as many as 17,000 in
the coming years, FAZ reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
