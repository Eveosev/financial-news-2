The Autorite des Marches Financiers,
 France ’s financial-markets regulator, sent letters to the
nation’s banks advising them to re-examine losses on their
Greek sovereign debt holdings, given that larger debt discounts
are now being discussed for the country.  The lenders need to adjust their losses because the July
agreement that called for 21 percent losses on Greek debt for
private bondholders now appears to be void, the AMF said in a
statement sent by e-mail today.  “This should result in them re-examining the discount rate
on Greek sovereign bonds, taking into account all of the
pertinent information available,” the regulator said in the
statement.  The regulator’s letters were originally reported in the
Financial Times.  European officials are considering five scenarios to update
a July agreement, according to people familiar with the
deliberations. They range from sticking with a voluntary swap to
a so-called hard restructuring that would force investors to
exchange Greek bonds for new ones at 50 percent of their value,
the people said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
