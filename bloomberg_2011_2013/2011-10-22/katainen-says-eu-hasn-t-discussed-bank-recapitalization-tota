Finnish Prime Minister  Jyrki
Katainen  said European Union leaders have not discussed a total
amount in terms of bank-recapitalization needs.  The bank-recapitalization amount “has not been
discussed,” Katainen told reporters today in Brussels. He also
said that the euro-area bailout fund should only be considered
as a last resort for bank recapitalization.  To contact the reporter on this story:
