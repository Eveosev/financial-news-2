Lorenzo Bini Smaghi should quit his
post on the Executive Board of the  European Central Bank , said
Italian Prime Minister  Silvio Berlusconi . “I hope he
understands and steps down for the good of the country,”
Berlusconi told reporters in Brussels today. He said he would
discuss the matter with French President Nicolas Sarkozy at a
summit tomorrow.  Sarkozy backed Italy’s Mario Draghi to head the ECB with
the understanding that Bini Smaghi would quit and make way for a
French candidate for the board. Berlusconi passed over Bini
Smaghi this week as Draghi’s replacement at the Bank of Italy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
