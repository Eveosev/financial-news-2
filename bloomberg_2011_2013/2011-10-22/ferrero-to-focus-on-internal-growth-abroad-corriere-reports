The Ferrero group, maker of Nutella

to expand its brands abroad, Chief Executive Officer Giovanni
Ferrero told  Corriere della Sera .  “We’ve always grown by internal lines and for the time
being we don’t have different plans,” the Milan-based newspaper
quoted the CEO as saying in an interview. “Today, our main
priority is to increase our international presence.”  Emerging markets are “more and more strategic” for the
company, he said, according to the Corriere report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
