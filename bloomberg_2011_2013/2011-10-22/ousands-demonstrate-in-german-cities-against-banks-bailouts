Thousands took part in protests in
Germany to demonstrate against banks and bailouts as European
leaders gather in Brussels to tackle euro-area debt crisis.  About 4,000 people gathered outside the  European Central
Bank  in  Frankfurt , Alfred Moebs, head of police duty, said today
by telephone. Several hundred people demonstrated outside the
Reichstag building in central Berlin, police spokeswoman Heidi
Vogt said.  German lawmakers are facing public fatigue over the
country’s shouldering of euro-region rescues and bank bailouts.
Protests began Oct. 15, with more than 5,000 people marching
through Frankfurt’s streets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
