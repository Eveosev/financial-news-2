Several hundred Kosovo Serbs have
prevented North Atlantic Treaty Organization peacekeepers from
removing obstacles that have restricted access to the north of
the country for three months, the British Broadcasting Corp.
reported.  The NATO-led Kosovo Force, or KFOR, pushed through three of
16 roadblocks consisting of vehicles, rocks, mud and logs before
meeting hundreds of Serbs who sat on the road in protest, the
 BBC  said.  The roadblocks were erected to demonstrate against the
authority of Kosovoâ€™s mostly ethnic Albanian government, the
Tanjug News agency reported Oct. 20.  To contact the reporter on this story:
