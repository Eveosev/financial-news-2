Italy will meet its budget targets
through 2013, Italian Finance Minister  Giulio Tremonti  told
European Commission President  Jose Barroso  in a 20-minute phone
conversation today, according to the minister’s spokeperson.  Barroso insisted on the need to keep the country’s public
finances under control through 2013 and Tremonti reassured him,
saying the government is committed to necessary reforms and
“will meet its targets,” Tremonti’s spokeperson told reporters
today in Brussels.  Prime Minister  Silvio Berlusconi ’s government passed a 54
billion-euro package of spending cuts and tax increases in
August to convince the  European Central Bank  to buy Italian
bonds after the nation’s borrowing costs surged to euro-era
records. The plan aims to balance the budget by 2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
