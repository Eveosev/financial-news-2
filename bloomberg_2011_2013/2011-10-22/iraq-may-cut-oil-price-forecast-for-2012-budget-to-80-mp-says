Iraq  may reduce the crude-oil price
assumption it uses to calculate the state budget next year to
$80 a barrel from the current $85, a member of the Iraqi
parliament said.  “We think $80 a barrel is a very assuring price,” Haitham
Al Jabouri, secretary of the parliament’s finance panel, told
reporters today in  Baghdad . “We don’t expect crude oil to drop
below $80 a barrel.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
