European Union finance chiefs
started to grapple with how to protect banks from the fallout of
a potential Greek default as they began the second day of a six-
day marathon to end the debt crisis.  The 27 finance ministers, meeting in Brussels, would
address the “framework of bank recapitalization,” the
Netherlands’ Jan Kees  de Jager  told reporters as he arrived.  Spain ’s  Elena Salgado  said the amounts to be raised by
banks depended on which Basel standards for capital adequacy are
applied. “Until that is clear, we can’t say what capital is
needed.”  She said discussion of investor losses on Greek holdings
wouldn’t be addressed by the 27 ministers today as they were a
topic for officials from the 17 euro countries.  Final decisions aren’t likely until a leaders’ summit on
Oct. 26, De Jager said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
