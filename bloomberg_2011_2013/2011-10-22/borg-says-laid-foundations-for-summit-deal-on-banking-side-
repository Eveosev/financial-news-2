Swedish Finance Minister Anders Borg
said European finance chiefs have “laid foundations” for an
agreement by government leaders on shielding banks from the
fallout from the sovereign debt crisis.  “There remains some work to be done on the EFSF on the
eurogroup side, but we have laid down foundations for an
agreement on the banking side,” Borg told reporters today in
Brussels after a meeting of the 27 European Union finance
ministers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
