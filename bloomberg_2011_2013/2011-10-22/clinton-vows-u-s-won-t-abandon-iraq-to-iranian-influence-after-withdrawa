Secretary of State  Hillary Clinton 
vowed today that the U.S. won’t abandon Iraq to unwanted
meddling by neighbors such as  Iran .  “To countries in the region, especially Iraq’s neighbors,
we want to emphasize that America will stand with our allies and
friends, including Iraq, in defense of our common security and
interests,” Clinton said today during a press conference in
Dushanbe, Tajikistan. “We will have a robust and continuing
presence throughout the region.”  Clinton’s remarks come the day after President Barack Obama
announced that all U.S. troops will be out of Iraq by the end of
the year, fulfilling a campaign promise and ending one of the
longest conflicts in U.S. history.  “As the president said yesterday, this marks a new phase
in our relations with  Iraq ,” she said. “This will open a new
chapter in our relationship.”  She said the withdrawal won’t end the U.S. commitment to
the country, which will keep a large contingent of Americans
posted at the U.S. embassy. “America is with you as you take
your next steps in your journey to secure your democracy.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
