An area of low pressure near San
Andres Island east of  Nicaragua  has a 70 percent chance of
becoming a tropical system in the next two days, according to
the U.S. National Hurricane Center.  “There is a likelihood that a tropical depression will
form during the weekend,” the center said in an  advisory  at 8
p.m. East Coast time.  Sixteen named storms have formed so far this season in the
Atlantic, compared with an average of 11, according to the
center. A storm gets a name when it becomes organized and top
winds reach at least 39 miles per hour.  The Atlantic hurricane season runs from June 1 to Nov. 30.  The system is expected to start drifting to the north by
the day after tomorrow, the center said.  The water in the area is 84 to 86 degrees Fahrenheit (29 to
30 Celsius), warm enough to help a storm develop,  Jeff Masters ,
co-founder of Weather Underground Inc., said on his blog. The
system’s winds are about 25 to 30 mph, he wrote.  The hurricane center is also tracking a second system off
the coast of  Venezuela  that has a 20 percent chance of becoming
a storm in the next 48 hours, according to the center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
