Secretary of State  Hillary Clinton 
said she raised U.S. concern about religious and media freedom
in Tajikistan.  “We encouraged the Tajik government to take concrete
steps” toward greater civil and religious freedom, she said at
a press conference after meeting with Tajik President Emomali
Rahmon and Foreign Minister Hamrokhon Zarifi in the Tajik
capital of Dushanbe.  Restricting religious expression “could build up
discontent,” she said, referring to Tajik rules against Muslims
wearing veils or beards.  “We don’t want to do anything to breed extremism,” she
said, adding that she had urged the Tajik leaders to rethink
“any restrictions going forward, because we think they could
increase sympathy for extremist views.”  For Related News and Information:   and the worry that restricting religion may stoke extremism.  To contact the reporter on this story:
