German  Chancellor Angela Merkel  said
she is confident that European Union leaders will produce an
“ambitious” result at their summit on Oct. 26.  “I believe the finance ministers have made progress and
that we will achieve ambitious goals on Wednesday,” Merkel told
reporters today in Brussels. “Still, these are difficult talks
and it is important that Germany and  France  in particular take a
very active part in the preparations. We are doing that.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
