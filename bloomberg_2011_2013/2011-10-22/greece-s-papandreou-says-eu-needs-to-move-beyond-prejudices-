Greek Prime Minister  George
Papandreou  said that the European Union needs to “move beyond
prejudices” as it seeks a resolution to the region’s sovereign-
debt crisis in coming days.  “Now is the time for  Europe , for collective decisions in
Europe,” Papandreou told reporters today in Brussels. “The
challenge we have is a European challenge, not just a Greek
one.”  “It’s a challenge which is not just for the future of
Europe but the existence of Europe,” he said. “In the next few
days, our decisions are historical; they have to be decisive and
they have to create a Europe of cohesion and move beyond
prejudices to a Europe where we work together in solidarity.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
