Saudi Arabian small- and medium-
sized companies and organizations with nine workers or less must
employ at least one Saudi citizen, the  Saudi Press Agency 
reported yesterday, citing a decree by Labor Minister Adel
Faqih.  The Saudi employee should be registered at the  General
Organization for Social Insurance  and canâ€™t be counted as part
of so-called Saudization targets at another enterprise, SPA
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
