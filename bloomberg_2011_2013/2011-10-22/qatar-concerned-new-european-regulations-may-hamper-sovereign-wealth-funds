Qatar is concerned about the effects
of European legislation on sovereign wealth funds and is willing
to cooperate with  Europe  on its economic crisis, Prime Minister 
Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim Al Thani said.  “We have some agreements, but not with everyone, not as we
want,” Sheikh Hamad, who is also the country's foreign minister, 
told reporters today at the  World Economic Forum  in Jordan. 
“Discussions are under way with some European countries to 
resolve certain regulatory hurdles, such as taxation. We are 
worried that there will be new regulations that can make 
obstacles for our sovereign wealth fund."  Qatar has already agreed several investments in  Greece ,
including a 1 billion-euro ($1.3 billion) commitment to invest
in Greek mining companies. The Persian Gulf emirate will also
acquire a 10 percent stake from Ellaktor SA and will have an
option to buy another 5 percent from the Greek construction
company, Ahmad al-Sayed, the chief executive officer of Qatar
Holdings, said on Oct. 1.  Qatar may buy a 7.5 percent stake in European Aeronautic,
Defence & Space Co. from Daimler AG with the  voting rights 
remaining at Daimler, Handelsblatt reported Sept. 28, without
saying how it got the information.  Sheikh Hamad said he is ‘‘worried’’ that European
politicians have done ‘‘too little too late’’ to solve the
ongoing economic crisis.  To contact the reporter on this story:
