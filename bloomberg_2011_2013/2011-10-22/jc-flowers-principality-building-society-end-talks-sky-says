JC Flowers & Co. and Principality
Building Society have ended merger talks, Sky News’s Mark Kleinman reported on his  blog , citing Peter Griffiths,
Principality’s chief executive officer.  Griffiths said Principality is “not involved in any active
dialogue” with the private-equity company, while JC Flowers
declined to comment, Kleinman wrote.  The two companies had been exploring either bidding for
Northern Rock Plc through a joint venture or merging
Principality’s assets with OneSavings Bank Plc, Kleinman wrote,
citing unidentified people close to the discussions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
