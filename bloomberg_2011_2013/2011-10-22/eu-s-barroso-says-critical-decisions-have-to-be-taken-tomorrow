European Commission President  Jose
Barroso  said “critical decisions” must be made at tomorrow’s
summit of European Union leaders in Brussels.    “I am confident that a comprehensive solution is within
reach,” Barroso told reporters today in Brussels. “The finance
ministers have made progress today, but the critical decisions
have to be taken tomorrow in the summit.”  “It’s also a matter of political will and I hope that all
the heads of state and government of our member states will be
up to their responsibilities,” Barroso said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
