Belgium â€™s federal and regional
governments agreed to rescue Holding Communal SA, a shareholder
of bailed-out lender  Dexia SA (DEXB) , Belga reported without saying
where it obtained the information.  Belgian regional governments may increase a state guarantee
to 450 million euros and accept a loss of 120 million euros on
commercial paper, according to the news agency. The Belgian
federal government may contribute up to 132.5 million euros,
while Dexia Bank Belgium, nationalized earlier this month, will
accept a loss of 101.5 million euros of debt it is owed by
Holding Communal, Belga said.  Belga did not specify the type of contribution by the
federal government.  To contact the reporter on this story:
