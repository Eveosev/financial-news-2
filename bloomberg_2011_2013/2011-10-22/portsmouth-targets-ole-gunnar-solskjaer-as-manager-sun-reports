Portsmouth wants Ole Gunnar
Solskjaer to be the club’s new manager, the Sun reported.  Pompey owner  Vladimir Antonov  flew to  Norway  last night to
convince the former Manchester United striker to fill the void
left when Steve Cotterill took over at Championship rival
Nottingham Forest last week, the Sun said.  Solskjaer is currently manager of Molde, which leads the
Norwegian Premier League. He’s also been linked with the
Blackburn job with  Steve Kean  under pressure, the Sun said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
