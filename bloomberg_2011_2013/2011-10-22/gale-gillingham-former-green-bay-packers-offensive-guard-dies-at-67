Former Green Bay Packers offensive
guard Gale Gillingham, a five-time Pro Bowl selection, died two
days ago at the age of 67, the team said.  The Packers didn’t disclose the cause of death.
Gillingham’s son, Wade, said his father appeared to have a heart
attack while lifting weights at his home in Little Falls,
 Minnesota , according to the  Associated Press .  Gillingham played 128 regular-season games over 10 years
for the Packers after he was drafted in the first round as the
 National Football League ’s 13th overall pick in 1966.  “On a team with a notable history of outstanding offensive
linemen, Gale stood out,” team President and Chief Executive
Officer  Mark Murphy  said in a statement.  Inducted into the Packers Hall of Fame in 1982, Gillingham
blocked for quarterback Bart Starr as the Packers claimed their
first Super Bowl wins in 1967 and 1968. Starr became his coach
in 1976.  “He had a great career,” Starr said in a statement on the
team’s website. “I think he was uniquely dedicated and
committed, and it’s hard to replace those two words. He was a
great teammate.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
