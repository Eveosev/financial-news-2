Russia intends to sign an agreement
for pipeline transit of gas from Turkmenistan to Ukraine,
Ukrainian Prime Minister  Mykola Azarov  said in interview with
 Inter TV  late yesterday.  The deal may be signed within sixth months after an accord
to create a free trade zone within the Commonwealth of
Independent States becomes effective, he said.  Russia and  Kazakhstan  also agreed to cancel oil export
duties following the creation of the trade zone, which will help
to make oil refining in Ukraine profitable, Azarov said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
