Federal Reserve  Governor Elizabeth Duke said the financial stability of consumers and their
families is key to the U.S. economy’s strength.  “The financial health of each household contributes to the
financial health of the country as a whole,” Duke said today in
remarks prepared for a speech in Virginia Beach, Virginia.
“Thus, the Federal Reserve has an inherent interest in the
financial stability and strength of individual households, whose
spending, saving and investing significantly impact economic
growth.”  Income and asset values that are improving with the U.S.
economy “should be felt more and more by U.S. households,”
which have smaller debt balances and are receiving lower
 interest rates , Duke said. The share of income devoted to paying
down debt is at its lowest level since 1994, she noted.  Duke, speaking at Virginia Beach Financial Planning Day,
didn’t discuss forecasts for the  U.S. economy  or her outlook for
monetary policy in her prepared text.  To contact the reporter on this story:
