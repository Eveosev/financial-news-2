China ’s Premier  Wen Jiabao  asked
local authorities to step up measures to control food costs as
his government strives to curb inflation, according to a
statement posted on the government’s website today.  The government will boost reserves and supply of food,
impose strict control on “deep processing projects” of corn,
provide incentives to stabilize animal-feed prices and increase
hog production, Wen said during a trip to Nanning in south
China’s Guangxi province, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
