German  Chancellor Angela Merkel  said
she is confident that European Union leaders will produce an
“ambitious” result at their summit on Oct. 26.  Talks are about “issues that in some cases are very
complicated,” Merkel told reporters today in Brussels. She said
“final decisions” will not come tomorrow’s meeting of EU heads
of state and government; they will be taken at the
follow-up session on Oct. 26, she said.  “I believe the finance ministers have made progress and
that we will achieve ambitious goals on Wednesday,” Merkel said.
“Still, these are difficult talks and it is important that
Germany and  France  in particular take a very active part in the
preparations. We are doing that.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
