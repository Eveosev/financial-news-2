European banks may need about 100
billion euros ($139 billion) in capital after marking their
sovereign debt holdings to market values in an examination by
 Europe ’s top banking regulator, according to a person familiar
with the discussions.  The European Banking Authority told Finance Ministers in
Brussels that the region’s lenders would need to raise that
amount to reach a core tier 1 capital level of 9 percent, said
the person, who declined to be identified because discussions
are private. Talks with policymakers are still ongoing so the
final number may change, the person said.  Reuters reported the amount of capital needed earlier
today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
