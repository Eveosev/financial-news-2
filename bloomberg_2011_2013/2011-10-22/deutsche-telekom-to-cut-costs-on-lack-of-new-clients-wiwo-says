  Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE)  plans to cut
costs to help meet earnings targets as the company fails to keep
pace in acquiring new customers,  WirtschaftsWoche said , citing
an interview with executive board member Niek Jan van Damme.  The number of new customers in some areas such as broadband
connections is “significantly lower” compared with last year,
said Damme, who is also head of the Bonn-based company’s German
operations. All employees have been asked to cut travel costs
and a recent leadership meeting was canceled for that reason,
the German magazine reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
