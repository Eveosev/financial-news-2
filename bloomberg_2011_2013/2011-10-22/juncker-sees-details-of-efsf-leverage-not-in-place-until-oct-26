Luxembourg’s  Jean-Claude Juncker ,
who leads the group of euro-area finance ministers, said the
details of a plan to leverage the region’s bailout fund are
unlikely to be in place until the Oct. 26 summit of leaders.  “I don’t think from now until Wednesday we will have
worked out all the details of these leverage options,” Juncker
said today in an interview in Brussels. “I expect no major
decision tomorrow from heads of state” at a first summit.  “But that’s not really satisfying for markets, I have to
say,” Juncker said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
