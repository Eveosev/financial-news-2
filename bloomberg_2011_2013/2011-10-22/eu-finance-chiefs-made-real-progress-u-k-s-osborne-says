European Union finance ministers
made “real progress” in discussions on how to strengthen the
region’s banks, U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer  George Osborne 
said.  “We’ve had a 10-hour meeting, but we’ve made real
progress,” Osborne told reporters today in Brussels. “We’ve
come to important decisions on strengthening European banks.”  “That’s one part of the package and obviously there’s more
work to do,” he said. “Britain will be keeping up the pressure
over the next couple of days to get the comprehensive package
and resolve the European crisis, the crisis in the euro zone,
and make sure we get growth and jobs across the European
continent.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
