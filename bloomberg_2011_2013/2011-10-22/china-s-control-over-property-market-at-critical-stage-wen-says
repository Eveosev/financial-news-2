China’s control over the  property
market  and construction of public housing is at a “critical”
stage, Premier  Wen Jiabao  said, urging efforts to
“consolidate” results achieved from past policy measures.  Funding for welfare home construction must be ensured and
land supply for “normal” property construction should be
increased, Wen said during a trip to Nanning in south China’s
Guangxi province yesterday and today, according to a statement
on the government website.  China’s policies must tilt more towards the improvement of
people’s welfare because it affects social stability, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
