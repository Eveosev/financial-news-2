Formula One cars are scheduled to
race through the streets of  New Jersey  in 2013, the Wall Street
Journal reported, citing two people familiar with the London-
based racing circuit’s U.S. plans.  The Formula One Grand Prix of America will cover a course
in Weehawken and West New York along the  Hudson River  in June
2013, the newspaper said. Details will be given Oct. 25 during a
press conference at Port Imperial.  The mayors of Weehawken and West New York in August
identified an investor group, led by former YES Network
executive Leo Hindery Jr., interesting in bringing the race to
New Jersey, the Journal said.  The New Jersey race will follow Formula One’s return to the
U.S. in November 2012 at a $250 million racetrack in Austin,
 Texas , the Journal said. The last U.S. race was at the
Indianapolis Motor Speedway in 2007.  To contact the reporter on this story:
