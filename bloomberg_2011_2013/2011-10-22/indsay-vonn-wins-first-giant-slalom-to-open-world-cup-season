Lindsay Vonn of the U.S. won today’s
giant slalom in Soelden,  Austria , the opening race of the World
Cup ski season.  Vonn, a three-time overall World Cup champion, finished in
a time of 2 minutes, 24.34 seconds on the Rettenbach slope. It
was the 27-year-old’s first win in the discipline and her 42nd
World Cup victory.  “To come out today, first race of the season, the first GS
win in my career, words can’t describe the feeling,” Vonn, who
lost the overall title last season to Germany’s  Maria Riesch ,
said on the World Cup website.  Germany’s Viktoria Rebensburg, the defending giant slalom
titleholder, finished second in 2:24.47, with Austria’s
Elisabeth Goergl third in 2:24.83. Italy’s Federica Brignone led
after the first run and crashed on her second run.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
