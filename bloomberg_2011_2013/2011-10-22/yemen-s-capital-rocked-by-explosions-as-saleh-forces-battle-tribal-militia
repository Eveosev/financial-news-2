Yemen’s capital was rocked by
explosions and gunfire tonight as forces loyal to President Ali
Abdullah Saleh battled tribal opponents in the city’s north.   At least 10 people died and dozens were wounded after the
army shelled several districts with artillery and mortars.   Walid Qassem, who lives in the city’s north, said five
civilians were killed in al-Thawara zone after they were hit by
shells.  He said he saw their bodies in a mosque as they were being
prepared for burial.  “There is a terrible destruction and damage of the houses.
I have seen big buildings being rocked by shells,” he said in
an interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
