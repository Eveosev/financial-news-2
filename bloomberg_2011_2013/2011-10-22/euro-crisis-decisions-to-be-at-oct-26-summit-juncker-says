Luxembourg Prime Minister Jean-
Claude Juncker said final decisions on the European Union’s
comprehensive response to the debt crisis will come at the
second of two leaders’ summits in coming days.  “I expect that the preparations are such that decisions
could be made but because it won’t be possible to do so for some
reasons, we’ll have another summit on Wednesday, that’s when
there will be decisions,” Juncker told reporters today in
Brussels before a meeting of EU finance chiefs. The EU heads of
state and government will meet tomorrow in Brussels and again on
Oct. 26.  Juncker said euro-area finance ministers have agreed to a
“considerable” increase in the private-sector involvement in a
second Greek bailout package.  “We agreed yesterday that we need a considerable increase
of the contribution that has to be carried by the banks,”
Juncker said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
