German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  said
 Europe  has accepted a “more realistic” outlook on  Greece ’s
financial situation. Speaking to reporters in Brussels today on
the eve of a European Union summit, she said, “I believe one
has arrived at a more realistic view of the situation in Greece
and that we will provide the necessary means to be able to
protect the euro. But that all that still requires alot of
work.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
