Missinippi Airways, a charter-and-
cargo carrier that flies to northern Manitoba and the Arctic,
was ordered by the Canadian government for the second time this
year to suspend service because of safety concerns.  The suspension of the company’s Air Operator Certificate is
based on safety concerns related to the company’s operational
control system,  Transport Canada  said today in a statement.
Without a certificate, a company cannot provide commercial air
services in  Canada .  Missinippi’s operations were also suspended after an
investigation of a July 4 accident in Pukatawagan, Manitoba,
according to a July 16 statement from Transport Canada.  The carrier must “must demonstrate that it meets all
applicable safety regulations before Transport Canada will
reissue its Air Operator Certificate,” the government agency
said today.  A call placed by Bloomberg News to  Missinippi ’s
headquarters after regular business hours wasn’t immediately
returned.  To contact the reporter on this story: Christopher Donville in
