Russia plans to bar entry for some
U.S. officials in retaliation for an American ban on Russian
officials allegedly involved in the death of anti-corruption
lawyer Sergei Magnitsky, Interfax said.  The restriction would affect certain Americans “breaching
the rights of Russians in the U.S.,” Interfax said, citing the
Foreign Ministry. The ministry has already compiled a list of
those to be denied entry, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
