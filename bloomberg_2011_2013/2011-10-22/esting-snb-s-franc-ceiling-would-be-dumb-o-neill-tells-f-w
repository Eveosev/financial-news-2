It would be “dumb” for the
 currency market  to test the  Swiss National Bank ’s ceiling for
the Swiss franc at 1.20 per euro,  Finanz & Wirtschaft  reported,
citing  Jim O’Neill , chairman of Goldman Sachs Management.  The SNB made the right decision and had to take a
“dramatic step” to curb the currency’s advance, O’Neill said,
according to the Zurich based newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
