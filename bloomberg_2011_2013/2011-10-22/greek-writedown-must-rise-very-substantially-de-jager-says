Dutch Finance Minister Jan Kees  de Jager  said the private-sector involvement in the new Greek
bailout package must rise “very substantially.”  “There’s a building consensus among the 17 nations that
the private-sector contribution must be increased very
substantially from the 21 percent in the July package,” De
Jager said today in Brussels. “I am not going to give
percentages, we need to negotiate with financial institutions.”  De Jager also said finance ministers reached consensus on a
bank-recapitalization plan. “On the recapitalization, we have
by consensus made a proposal to the European Council and we
expect that to be accepted Wednesday. That proposal is fully
backed by the Netherlands,” he said.  De Jager said there are “two options on the table” for
leveraging of the European Financial Stability Facility. He
didn’t elaborate on them.  “Tomorrow will be a very important day, but I expect
the definite decisions to be taken Wednesday,” De Jager said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
