The Autorite des Marches Financiers,
 France ’s financial-markets regulator, sent letters to the
nation’s banks advising them to take larger losses on their
Greek sovereign debt holdings, the Financial Times reported,
citing the AMF, which didn’t provide the newspaper with a copy
of the correspondence.  The AMF said in the letters that a 21 percent haircut on
the debt, which French banks and some insurers have taken, was
thought to be “insufficient,” without advising how big an
alternative haircut should be, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
