Greek Finance Minister Evangelos
Venizelos said “ Greece  is not the central problem of the  euro
zone ” after the region approved the sixth disbursement of aid
for the country under last year’s rescue.  The endorsement of the aid installment “is a very good and
positive and constructive step,” Venizelos told reporters today
in Brussels before a meeting of European Union finance
ministers. “Now the point is to take more general and more
constructive decisions for the euro zone as a whole.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
