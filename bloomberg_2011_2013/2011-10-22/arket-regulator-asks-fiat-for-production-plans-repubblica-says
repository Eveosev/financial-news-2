Italy’s market regulator has asked
 Fiat SpA (F)  to provide details on its plan for the country’s
factories when the company reports earnings next week, daily  la
Repubblica  reported without saying where it got the information.  The regulator said the request is justified because the
business plan for the Italian plants weigh on the stock price
valuation, the newspaper said.  The regulator wrote in a letter to Fiat that Chief
Executive Officer  Sergio Marchionne  has made “contradictory”
announcements on the future of domestic factories, in particular
on the Mirafiori assembly plant in Turin, the daily reported.  A Fiat spokesman declined to comment on the matter. Fiat is
scheduled to report earnings on Oct. 28.  To contact the reporters on this story:
