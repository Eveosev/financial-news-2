U.K. Foreign Secretary  William Hague 
said a referendum on Britain’s membership of the European Union
would threaten the economy and distract from attempts to resolve
the financial crisis in the euro zone.  “The sudden holding of a referendum on leaving the EU
would add to economic uncertainty at a time when businesses need
all the certainty and confidence they can get,” Hague wrote in
a column in the Daily Telegraph.  To contact the reporter on this story:
