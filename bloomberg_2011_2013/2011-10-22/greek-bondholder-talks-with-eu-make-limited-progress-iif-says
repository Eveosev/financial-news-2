Talks between investors and
policymakers in Brussels on boosting private-sector losses on
Greek bonds to lower the country’s debt load made “limited”
progress, according to the  Institute of International Finance .  “Discussions are making progress, albeit limited,’’  Charles
Dallara , managing director of Washington-based IIF, which
represents more than 450 financial companies, said in an e-
mailed statement today. “We remain open to explore options on a
voluntary approach built on a realistic outlook for the  Greek
economy  and restoration of  Greece ’s market access.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
