The U.S. Embassy in  Kenya  warned a
terrorist attack may be imminent in the East African nation, six
days after Kenyan soldiers entered neighboring  Somalia  to combat
al-Qaeda-linked rebels.  The embassy received “credible information of an imminent
threat of terrorist attacks directed at prominent Kenyan
facilities and areas where foreigners are known to congregate,
such as malls and night clubs,” said a statement e-mailed by
the State Department today.  “U.S. citizens should take this information into account
when planning travel and consider deferring travel at this
time,” the message said.  Kenya sent troops to Somalia on Oct. 16 after officials
blamed the kidnappings of foreign tourists and aid workers in
Kenya on al-Shabaab, a militia that has pledged allegiance to
the al-Qaeda terrorist network.  Somalia, on Kenya’s northeastern border, hasn’t had a
functioning government since the 1991 overthrow of dictator
Mohamed Siad Barre.  About 9,000 Ugandan and Burundian soldiers from the  African
Union-led peacekeeping force in Somalia  help provide security
for a Western-backed Transitional Federal Government. Al-
Shabaab, which has waged a four-year campaign to remove the
transitional administration, controls most of southern and
central Somalia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
