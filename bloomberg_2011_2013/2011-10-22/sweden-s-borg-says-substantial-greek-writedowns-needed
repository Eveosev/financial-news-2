Swedish Finance Minister Anders Borg
said “substantial” writedowns for bondholders are needed on
the value of  Greece ’s debt.  “We need substantial haircut on Greek debt,” Borg told
reporters today in Brussels. “We shouldn’t treat taxpayers
money as a freebie for banks,” he said.  “Any recapitalization has to be followed by ownership and
control,” Borg said. “We have to restore credibility and that
has to be capital.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
