Cardio3 BioSciences SA (CARD) , a Belgian
developer of experimental stem-cell treatments, rose to the
highest since its initial share sale in July after a competitor
gained U.S. approval to start a trial with similar technology.  Cardio3 advanced 50 cents to 24.50 euros at the 5:35 p.m.
close of trading on Euronext Brussels, giving the Mont-Saint-Guibert-based company a market value of 155.2 million euros
($209.1 million). More than 544,000 shares were traded, 38 times
the three-month daily average. The stock has surged 78 percent
in the past eight trading days.  Mesoblast Ltd. (MSB) , an Australian company that’s using similar
technology, rose to an eight-month high on Nov. 1 after saying
it gained Food and Drug Administration approval to start a late-stage study with its partner,  Teva Pharmaceutical Industries
Ltd. (TEVA) , of its  stem cells  in patients with heart failure.  That development “makes us quite confident in seeing the
technology as an emerging one, and more than that, an approvable
one,” Arnaud Guerin, an analyst with Portzamparc Societe de
Bourse in Nantes, France, said by phone today.  Cardio3 raised 23 million euros in an initial public
offering in July to fund a late-stage study of its C-Cure stem-cell therapy for heart patients.  To contact the reporter on this story:
