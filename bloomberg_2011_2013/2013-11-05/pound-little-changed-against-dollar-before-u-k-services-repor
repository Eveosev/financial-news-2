The pound advanced, climbing to the
strongest in a month against the euro, after an industry report
showed U.K. services output expanded at the fastest pace in 16
years in October.  Sterling gained the most in two weeks versus the dollar
after an independent economic institute raised its forecasts for
Britain’s economic growth, saying a pickup in  house prices  will
stoke  consumer spending . Short-sterling futures contracts fell,
a sign that traders are adding to bets for higher borrowing
costs. U.K. government bonds fell as demand for safer assets
waned. The Debt Management Office sold 1.25 billion pounds
($2.01 billion) of inflation-linked securities.  “This underlines the resilience of the U.K. economy,”
said  Jeremy Stretch , head of currency strategy at Canadian
Imperial Bank of Commerce in  London , referring to the services
data. “This is supportive for sterling. It makes sense to sell
the euro against the pound.”  The pound jumped 0.8 percent to 83.97 pence per euro at
4:30 p.m. London time after appreciating to 83.92 pence, the
strongest level since Oct. 3. The U.K. currency rose 0.5 percent
to $1.6048, the biggest gain since Oct. 22.  Sterling may extend its rally to 83.75 pence per euro this
week, CIBC’s Stretch said.  The U.K. economy will expand 1.4 percent this year and 2
percent in 2014, the National Institute of Economic and Social
Research said, raising both of its earlier forecasts by 0.2
percentage point.  ‘Every Measure’  “The housing market has thawed quite noticeably by almost
every measure you want to look at,”  Simon Kirby , an economist
at the institute in London, said yesterday at a press
conference. The  Bank of England  will probably increase its
benchmark  interest rate  in the second half of 2015, he said.  U.K. policy makers meeting on Nov. 7 will leave their
benchmark   interest rate  at a record-low 0.5 percent and the
asset-purchase  target  at 375 billion pounds, according to
Bloomberg surveys of economists. Governor  Mark Carney  presents
new quarterly forecasts on Nov. 13.  The implied yield on short-sterling futures expiring in
September 2015 increased 16 basis points to 1.25 percent.  An index of  services  based on a survey of  purchasing
managers  rose to 62.5, the highest level since May 1997, from
60.3 in September, Markit Economics said. The gauge, which has
been above the 50 level that divides expansion from contraction
since January, was forecast to fall to 60 in a Bloomberg survey.  ‘More Constructive’  “We have turned more constructive on sterling as data has
persistently surprised to the upside over the last few months,”
BNP Paribas SA strategists including Kiran Kowshik in London
wrote in a note to clients. “Data will need to disappoint more
consistently to trigger a substantial unwind.”  The pound gained 4.2 percent in the past six months, the
most among 10 developed-nation currencies tracked by Bloomberg
Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The euro climbed 3.9 percent and
the dollar rose 0.8 percent.  The yield on the benchmark 10-year gilt climbed 10 basis
points, or 0.1 percentage point, to 2.72 percent after reaching
2.74 percent, the highest since Oct. 22. The 2.25 percent bond
due in September 2023 fell 0.805, or 8.05 pounds per 1,000-pound
face amount, to 95.965.  The U.K. sold inflation-linked gilts due in March 2052 at a
real yield of 0.032 percent. The yield on previously issued
securities in the secondary market climbed three basis points to
0.05 percent.  The government plans to sell 2.25 billion pounds of 4.25
percent gilts maturing in 2036 on Nov. 14, the debt agency said
today in a statement.  Gilts lost 2.3 percent this year through yesterday,
according to Bloomberg World Bond Indexes. Treasuries slid 2.1
percent and German bonds declined 0.9 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
