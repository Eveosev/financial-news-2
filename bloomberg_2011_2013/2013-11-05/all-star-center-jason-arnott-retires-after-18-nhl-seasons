Jason Arnott, whose double-overtime
goal secured a second Stanley Cup title for the New Jersey
Devils in 2000, retired after 18 seasons in the National Hockey
League.  Arnott, a 39-year-old center, had 417 goals and 521 assists
in 1,244 games with Edmonton, New Jersey,  Dallas , Nashville,
 Washington  and St. Louis over his career. He went unsigned as a
free agent after getting 17 goals and 17 assists in 72 games
with St. Louis last season.  At 6-foot-5, 220 pounds, the Collingwood, Ontario, native
was regarded as one of hockey’s top power forwards, registering
1,242 penalty minutes over his career while averaging 23 goals
per season.  A two-time All Star, Arnott was selected seventh in the
1993 draft by the Edmonton Oilers following his junior career
with the Ontario Hockey League’s Oshawa Generals. He was named
to the All-Rookie team in 1993-94 after scoring 33 goals with
the Oilers, a career high matched in 2008-09 with Nashville.  After playing his first four seasons in  Edmonton , Arnott
was traded to New Jersey in 1998 and helped the Devils reach the
Stanley Cup Final in 2000 and 2001.  To contact the reporter on this story:
