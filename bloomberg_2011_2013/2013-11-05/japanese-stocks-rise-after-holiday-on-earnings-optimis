Japan ’s  Topix index  rose for the
first time in three days amid optimism corporate earnings are
improving. Markets were closed yesterday for a holiday.  The  Topix (TPX)  increased 0.8 percent to 1,191.96 as of 9:00 a.m.
in  Tokyo , after advancing 0.4 percent last week. The Nikkei 225
Stock Average added 0.9 percent to 14,323.24. Shares also
climbed after U.S. and Chinese data fueled bets the global
economy is recovering.  “The market will like the series of upward revisions we’ve
seen to companies’ earnings,” said  Toshiyuki Kanayama , a senior
market analyst at Monex Securities Inc. “Overall, investors are
finding it easy to take risk on the back of ample liquidity and
a calmer macro environment.”  The Topix trailed every other developed market in October,
rising less than 0.1 percent. The measure remained the best
performer this year among 24 developed markets tracked by
Bloomberg as of Nov. 1 with a 38 percent rally.  More than 500 companies on the 1,746-member Topix announce
results  this week , according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Of
the 175 that have reported earnings this quarter and for which
Bloomberg had estimates, 58 percent beat expectations.  Earnings per share for companies on the gauge are expected
to  increase  43 percent from the previous quarter, according to
analyst projections compiled by Bloomberg.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index were little
changed today. The measure gained 0.4 percent yesterday as Exxon
Mobil Corp. and U.S. Steel Corp. led a commodity rally. Data
yesterday showed U.S. factory orders increased 1.7 percent in
September after falling 0.1 percent the prior month.  Global Data  Investors are watching reports to gauge the health of the
 U.S. economy  after the  Federal Reserve  last week said it needs
to see more evidence of sustained improvement before reducing
the pace of its monthly bond purchases.  In  China , a non-manufacturing  Purchasing Managers ’ Index
rose to the highest level this year in October, a government
report showed Nov. 3.  The Topix  traded  at 1.23 times book value on Nov. 1,
compared to 2.56 for the S&P 500 and 1.81 for the Stoxx Europe
600 Index yesterday. The Topix’s 30-day historic  volatility  was
at 16.37 on Nov. 1, down from its five-year median of 19.18.  To contact the reporters on this story:
