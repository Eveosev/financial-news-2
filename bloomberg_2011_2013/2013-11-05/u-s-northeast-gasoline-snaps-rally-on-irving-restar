Gasoline in the U.S. Northeast fell
from a seven-week high as Irving Oil Corp.’s Saint John
refinery, a major supplier to the region, restarted a unit after
week-long maintenance.  Reformulated, 84-octane gasoline,  or RBOB , in New York
Harbor weakened 0.25 cent to 4.5 cents a gallon above futures on
the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 1:53 p.m. after climbing
yesterday to  the highest level  since Sept. 13. Conventional,
83.5-octane gasoline, or CBOB, slipped 0.5 cent to a premium
4.25 cents a gallon, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Differentials narrowed as Irving started a 70,000-barrel-a-day fluid catalytic cracker that had been shut since Oct. 29 at
the refinery in  New Brunswick . The maintenance went as planned,
Samantha Robinson, a company spokeswoman in Saint John, said in
an e-mail.  The refinery, which has a capacity of almost 300,000
barrels a day, exports more than half of its refined products,
including gasoline and diesel, to the U.S. East Coast. A fluid
catalytic cracker upgrades vacuum gasoil into lighter petroleum
products such as gasoline and jet fuel.  No. 54 jet fuel in  New York  declined 0.5 cent to a discount
of 1.5 cents a gallon, while ultra-low-sulfur diesel in the
region fell 0.13 cent to parity with Nymex futures.  The area’s 3-2-1 crack spread, a measure of refining
margins for gasoline and diesel based on Brent oil in  Europe ,
climbed 13 cents to $7.07 a barrel. That’s the fifth consecutive
advance, the longest string of gains since July, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
