The rand weakened against the dollar,
extending this month’s worst drop among major currencies, on
concern labor disputes at platinum mines will weigh on  South
Africa ’s current-account deficit.  About 7,000 workers continued a strike that started on Nov.
3 at  Northam Platinum Ltd. (NHM) ’s biggest mine, the  National Union of
Mineworkers  said. Pay talks continue at three other platinum
mines that produce more than 70 percent of the world’s output.
South Africa needs foreign investment to plug a current-account
shortfall that may average 6.5 percent of economic output this
year, according to government estimates.  “The rand remains a victim of poor local fundamentals as
well as the mining labor unions,” Mohammed Nalla, head of
strategic research at  Nedbank Group Ltd. (NED) , said in e-mailed
comments. Labor disputes do “little to instill confidence in
the already faltering economy,” he said.  The rand dropped 0.5 percent to 10.1873 per dollar as of
11:11 a.m. in Johannesburg, bringing its decline this month to
1.4 percent. Yields on bonds due December 2026 dropped one basis
point, or 0.01 percentage point,to 8.09 percent.  South Africa’s currency will probably trade between 10.05
and 10.25 per dollar today, Nalla wrote. A sustained decline
above 10.20 per dollar may trigger a slump to 10.50, he said.  Foreign investors sold a net 977 million rand ($96 million)
of South African  bonds  and 436 million rand of  stocks  yesterday,
according to JSE Ltd. data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
