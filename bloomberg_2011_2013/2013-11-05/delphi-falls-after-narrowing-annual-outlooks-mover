Delphi Automotive Plc (DLPH) , a former unit
of  General Motors Co. (GM) , fell the most in more than six months
after narrowing some of its annual forecasts.  The shares slid 5.2 percent to $55.01 at the close in  New
York  for their biggest drop since April 15. They have increased
44 percent this year, outpacing the 24 percent gain for the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  Delphi said annual profit will be $4.25 to $4.35 a share,
compared with an earlier forecast of as much as $4.45. The
company narrowed the range of adjusted profit margin to 14.4
percent to 14.5 percent, from as much as 14.7 percent.  “There was nothing fundamentally great or bad about the
quarter,” Matthew Stover, an analyst with Guggenheim Securities
in  Boston , said in a note today to clients. “However, we would
expect that those most bullish supporters will have wanted more
from the quarter.”  Excluding some restructuring and acquisition costs, the
company had a third-quarter profit of 97 cents a share, Troy,
Michigan-based Delphi said in a statement. That exceeded the
95-cent average estimate of 15 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.
Delphi reported quarterly net income of $271 million, or
87 cents a share, up from $269 million, or 84 cents, a year
earlier.  Revenue for the quarter rose 9.7 percent to $4.02 billion,
hurt by lower vehicle production in Europe. The average of 12
estimates was for sales of $4.04 billion.  Chief Executive Officer Rodney O’Neal said in an interview
that the European market is improving. Delphi generated 41
percent of its  2012 revenue  from its  Europe , Middle East and
Africa region.  “What gives us the optimism is it appears to have stopped
going backwards,” O’Neal said of Europe. “Now the dialogue is
around when will it go north?”  Delphi is registered in Gillingham, U.K.  To contact the reporter on this story:
