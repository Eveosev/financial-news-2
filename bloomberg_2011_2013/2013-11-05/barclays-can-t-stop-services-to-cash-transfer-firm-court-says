Barclays Plc (BARC)  must continue providing
banking services to a cash transfer company that serves Somalia
while money laundering concerns are reviewed, a U.K. court said.  Dahabshiil Holdings Ltd. won an application forcing the
London-based lender to work with it until the dispute can be
resolved at trial.  Barclays said in May it would end its relationship with
Dubai-based Dahabshiil, citing the lack of “strong anti-laundering governance structures.” Abdirashid Duale,
Dahabshiil’s chief executive officer, said outside court last
month the issue was a matter of life and death for African
families who rely on money being sent back from the U.K.  The bank’s reasons for wanting to end its links to the
company “need to be fully examined,” Judge Launcelot Henderson
said.  Barclays said the risk of financial crime is an important
regulatory concern and that it would appeal the ruling.  “Barclays made a legitimate decision to exit these
businesses based upon the well-known risks of money laundering
and terrorist financing in the money-service business sector,”
the bank said in an e-mailed statement. “The risk of financial
crime is an important regulatory concern and we take our
responsibilities in relation to this very seriously.”  Dahabshiil said in a statement that the ruling was a
“victory for the millions of Somalis and other Africans, many
of whose livelihoods depend on our services.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
