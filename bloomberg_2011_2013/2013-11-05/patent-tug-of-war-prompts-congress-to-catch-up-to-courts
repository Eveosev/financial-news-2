U.S. lawmakers, influenced by
companies including  Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO) ,  Eli Lilly & Co. (LLY)  and
Qualcomm Inc., are considering the second set of  patent-law 
changes in three years as the courts try to race ahead of
Congress.  The goal is to rein in entities that buy patents and demand
royalties from as many companies as possible. Often derided as
“trolls,” such firms filed 19 percent of all patent lawsuits
from 2007 to 2011, the Government Accountability Office found.  Finding a balance among protecting products from knockoff
competition, rewarding inventors for making their ideas public
and limiting nuisance suits has been debated for more than 200
years, even more so now that some lawsuits are targeting users
of ubiquitous technology like e-mail and Wi-Fi.  “There’s just a lot of pressure being put on Congress and
the courts to address the abusive practices,” said Tim Molino,
head of government relations for BSA - the Software Alliance,
based in  Washington , whose members include  Microsoft (MSFT)  Corp. and
 Oracle Corp. (ORCL)  “Both sides are trying to assert their authority
where they can to move the dial.”  The U.S. Supreme Court is considering when to penalize
patent owners for filing questionable claims, while the federal
courts’ administrator has proposed disclosure  rules  that may
lessen litigation costs.  The legislation Congress is considering would do some of
the same things -- make patent companies pay the other side’s
legal fees if they lose and tell the courts to change their
discovery rules.  Three-Way Split  “You do not need Congress to mandate things courts are
already willing to consider,” Circuit Judge Kathleen O’Malley
of the  U.S. Court of Appeals  for the Federal Circuit, which
handles all patent appeals, said in a Sept. 17 speech to the
Intellectual Property Owners Association.  The struggle between the courts and Congress has divided
companies along the lines of who gets sued more often.  Google Inc. (GOOG) , Cisco and other technology companies in the
 Coalition for Patent Fairness  back legislation introduced Oct.
23 by Representative Bob Goodlatte, a Virginia Republican who
heads the House Judiciary Committee. It would allow collection
of legal fees from licensing companies that lose at trial and
require they provide more details about patents and how they
were infringed.  Companies like  Qualcomm Inc. (QCOM)  that own many patents and make
money from licensing them say weakening patents would hurt their
business. The Qualcomm-backed Innovation Alliance seeks limited
congressional action, and is pushing lawmakers to stop diverting
money from the U.S. Patent and  Trademark Office , which is funded
entirely by user fees.  The Coalition for 21st Century Patent Reform -- made up of
General Electric,  Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) ,  Eli Lilly  and other patent
holders -- says the Goodlatte bill takes some power from courts.  Venue Struggle  Industries reliant on patent protection for revenue, which
include technology companies, drugmakers, and manufacturers, had
3.9 million jobs and accounted for $763 billion, or 5.3 percent
of gross domestic product, in 2010, according to a 2012 Commerce
Department report.  Patent litigation is expensive. The cost of defending a
patent suit through trial, not including damages, starts at
about $650,000 and can reach several million dollars, an
American Intellectual Property Lawyers Association study found.  A Senate Commerce subcommittee will hold a hearing Nov. 7
on the impact of royalty demand letters on small businesses,
consumers and innovators.  Goodlatte said at an Oct. 29 hearing his bill is the
bailiwick of Congress and “the  Supreme Court  has long
recognized that the prescription of court procedure falls within
the legislative function.”  2011 Law  Some companies say Congress is getting it wrong.  “You’ve got this incredibly powerful organized lobby that
wants to kill innovation because it’s a threat to them,” said
Loudon Owen, chairman of I4i LP, a Canadian designer of software
for drug companies that won a $200 million verdict against
Microsoft in 2011.  A wide-ranging patent law passed in 2011, called the
America Invents Act, started as a push by companies like
Microsoft to make it easier to challenge patents and limit
damage awards. Those provisions never made it in the final law -
- because the courts addressed the issues.  Microsoft curtailed its push for legislation after winning
three court rulings between 2007 and 2011 that limited damages
in patent suits.  The public debate “leads to legislative changes where
legislative change is needed,” said  Horacio Gutierrez ,
Microsoft’s head of intellectual property. “It crystalizes
issues that can be resolved by courts in a faster and more
effective way.”  Sledgehammer, Scalpel  Companies are spending millions to influence lawmakers. In
2011, three groups alone spent $2.4 million lobbying on the
America Invents Act. So far this year, they’ve spent more than
$1.1 million, according to Senate disclosure records. That
doesn’t include campaign contributions or media buys.  The Coalition for Patent Fairness and the  National Retail
Federation , a Washington trade group, paid for a newspaper
advertising campaign deriding “patent trolls” this year.
Innovation Alliance responded with “Who’s Trolling Who,”
saying “fringe abuses” are being used to weaken  patent rights .  The Supreme Court announced Oct. 1 it would hear two cases
that would make it easier for targets of patent suits to collect
attorneys’ fees, which could deter groundless lawsuits.  The Federal Circuit is considering whether patent owners
can block competitors from selling products based on a finding
of infringement of a feature of a complex device -- such as a
way to scroll through pages on a smartphone.  The courts are limited because “they only can deal with
the facts of the cases and legal questions presented before
them,” said  Mark Chandler , general counsel for  San Jose ,
California-based Cisco.  While Goodlatte is pushing his committee to vote on the
proposal quickly, the companies’ split over certain segments may
give the courts time to tackle the so-called trolls.  “In general, courts are always a better way to fix things
than Congress,” said Ron Laurie, managing director of Inflexion
Point Strategy, which counsels companies on intellectual
property. “Congress uses a sledgehammer and courts use a
scalpel.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
