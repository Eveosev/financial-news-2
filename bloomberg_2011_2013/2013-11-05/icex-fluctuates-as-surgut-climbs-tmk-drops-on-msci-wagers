Russian stocks  moved between gains
and losses as oil producer OAO Surgutneftegas climbed after
profits rose and pipemaker OAO TMK dropped on concern it will be
cut from a gauge tracked by equity investors.  The  Micex Index (INDEXCF)  traded little changed at 1,513.32 by 1:20
p.m. in Moscow after adding as much as 0.4 percent earlier.
Markets were closed yesterday for a public holiday.
Surgutneftegas jumped 1.2 percent to 29.10 rubles. TMK lost 3
percent to 90.25 rubles.  Surgut said nine-month profit surged 72 percent to 204.8
billion rubles ($6.3 billion), according to Russian accounting
standards, compared with the same period a year earlier. TMK,
the world’s biggest pipemaker by output, may be removed from
MSCI Inc.’s  Russia  Index, VTB Capital said Oct. 31. MSCI
announces the index rebalancing results on Nov. 7.  “TMK’s possible exclusion from MSCI Russia is a negative
factor for the shares,” Oleg Popov, who manages $1 billion of
securities for Allianz Investments, said by phone in Moscow.  The ruble’s 6.1 percent slide versus the dollar this year
led to an “earnings boost,” he said. “The company is very
dependent on the ruble’s movements.”  Most of the $30 billion of cash held by Surgutneftegas is
in dollars, meaning a depreciation in the ruble leads to
exchange gains, higher net income and increased dividends, paid
as a proportion of profit. The preferred shares rose 1.5
percent.  “Surgut’s results are a positive surprise, especially for
preferred shareholders who now may expect a higher dividend,
which we estimate may exceed 2 rubles,”  Alexei Kokin , an
analyst at UralSib Capital in Moscow, said by phone.  Rostelecom Buyout  OAO Rostelecom’s preferred shares rose 1.9 percent to 76.64
rubles after the Vedomosti newspaper reported the fixed-line
operator may make a new buyout offer to minorities. OAO  Mechel (MTLR) ,
Russia’s biggest coking-coal producer, increased 1.5 percent to
104.10 rubles.  Oil in  London  was steady at $106.25, while crude in New
York traded at $94.45. Russia receives about half its budget
revenue from natural gas and oil.  The  RTS Index (RTSI$)  slid 0.4 percent to 1,468.71, after a 1.1
percent drop last week. The dollar-denominated gauge entered a
bull market on Oct. 10, rising 20 percent from this year’s low.  Russian equities have the cheapest  valuations  among 21
emerging economies monitored by Bloomberg, with shares on the
Micex trading at 4.3 times projected 12-month earnings, compared
with a multiple of 10.4 for the MSCI  Emerging Markets  Index.
Ten-day  price swings  on the Micex fell to 9.232 from 9.242 on
Nov. 1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
