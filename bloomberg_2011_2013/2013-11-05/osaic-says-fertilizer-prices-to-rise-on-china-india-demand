Mosaic Co. (MOS) , the largest U.S. producer
of potash and phosphate fertilizer, expects global demand for
crop nutrients to rise late next year, buoyed by purchases in
China and  India .  “We believe we will see by the last half of 2014 this
demand start to come back, maybe sooner,” Mosaic Chief
Executive Officer Jim Prokopanko said today in a telephone
interview. “Potash and phosphate demand in two specific
geographies, China and India for potash, and phosphate into
India, will be back to traditional levels.”  Fertilizer prices will “remain challenging” into 2014
after a later-than-normal North American application season and
caution among dealers, Prokopanko said today in a statement.  Mosaic, based in Plymouth, Minnesota, fell 1.5 percent to
$46.05 at the close in New York. The shares have fallen 19
percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
