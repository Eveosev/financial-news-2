Tenaska Inc., a closely held
renewable-energy developer, is delivering power from a 130-megawatt solar farm in Southern California’s Imperial Valley.  The Tenaska Imperial Solar Energy Center South project near
El Centro, California, began commercial operations Nov. 1,
according to an e-mailed statement today from the Omaha,
Nebraska-based company. Sempra Energy utility San Diego Gas &
Electric agreed to buy the power under a 25-year contract.  Prudential Financial Inc. (PRU)  agreed last week to purchase a
minority stake in the power plant.  Construction is expected to begin early next year on
Tenaska’s 150-megawatt Imperial Solar Energy Center West, which
will also sell power to SDG&E, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
