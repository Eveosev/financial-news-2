Investcorp Bank BSC, the Bahrain-based investment firm that manages $10.5 billion, bought offices
and retail assets across the U.S. valued at $240 million, adding
to holdings bought earlier this year.  The company’s U.S. real estate unit purchased properties in
and around  Chicago ,  Los Angeles , Minneapolis and New York,
Investcorp said in an e-mailed statement today. The assets have
more than 1.6 million square feet (149,000 square meters) of
space and a combined occupancy rate of around 92 percent.  Gulf investors are snapping up properties in Europe and the
U.S. as they seek to shift investments away from the region’s
less developed markets. Investcorp in April said it purchased
properties valued at $200 million in the Washington, Denver and
Houston areas.  The purchases announced today include two office buildings
near  Northwestern University  in Evanston,  Illinois , and a
California retail center on 25 acres (10 hectares). Investcorp
also bought an office complex in Minneapolis and several offices
in New York’s Long Island.  The properties “present an opportunity to improve their
operating and leasing performance over a longer time horizon,”
Mohammed Al-Shroogi, president for Gulf business at Investcorp,
said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
