Ford Motor Co. (F) , the second-largest
U.S. automaker, said leading executives in design, manufacturing
and labor relations will retire after this year.  J Mays, 59, held the title of group vice president and
chief creative officer. He will be succeeded by Moray Callum,
54, who was named vice president of design, the Dearborn,
Michigan-based company said in a statement.  Also retiring is Jim Tetreault, 58, vice president of North
American manufacturing, and Marty Mulloy, 57, vice president of
labor affairs. Bruce Hettle, 52, was named to succeed Tetreault
and Bill Dirksen, 53, replaces Mulloy. All of the appointments
and retirements are effective Jan. 1.  Ford is in the midst of executive transition. The automaker
last year named  Mark Fields , 52, as chief operating officer. He
assumed some duties from Chief Executive Officer  Alan Mulally ,
68, who the company has said will remain through the end of
2014.  Ford rose 0.5 percent to $17.09 at the close in  New York 
trading. The shares have climbed 32 percent this year, outpacing
