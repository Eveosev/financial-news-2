Second-ranked Novak Djokovic beat
record 17-time tennis Grand Slam winner  Roger Federer  in their
opening match at the season-ending ATP World Tour Finals.  The Serb won the group B match 6-4, 6-7 (2-7), 6-2. The
pair each dropped two service games in the second set before
heading to a tie-breaker, which the sixth-seeded Swiss player
dominated.  Djokovic broke Federer in the opening game of the third
set, and then again to go up 4-1 before serving out the match.  In the day’s earlier singles match in group A, No. 1 Rafael Nadal defeated fellow Spaniard David Ferrer 6-3, 6-2.  The World Tour Finals, being held at the O2 Centre in
 London , brings together the top eight men’s players for a round-robin tournament. Federer has won the event six times.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
