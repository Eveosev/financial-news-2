Live Nation Entertainment Inc. (LYV) 
reported sales that beat analysts’ estimates after the company’s
summer concert tours drew a record attendance.  Sales climbed 15 percent to $2.26 billion in the three
months ended in September,  Beverly Hills , California-based Live
Nation said today in a  statement . That surpassed the $2.09
billion average  estimate  of analysts, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  Concert attendance worldwide jumped 27 percent in the
period to 21.2 million guests. Events in this period included
the Jay-Z and  Justin Timberlake  “Legends of the Summer Stadium
Tour.” The higher attendance led to revenue gains in Live
Nation’s sponsorship division and Ticketmaster unit.  “Consumer demand has come back strong for us this year, as
we have had attendance growth across concerts globally, from new
artists to the legends and everyone in between,” Michael
Rapino, president and chief executive officer, said in a
statement.  Net income fell 24 percent to $43.8 million, or 22 cents a
share, from $57.9 million, or 31 cents, a year ago, Live Nation
said. That beat the 14 cents per share analysts estimated on
average. The results included a $36.3 million charge on
extinguishment of debt.  Live Nation fell 1.1 percent to $19.40 at the close of
trading in  New York . The stock has more than doubled this year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
