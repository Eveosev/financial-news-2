Aurubis AG posted a loss on weak
demand for the scrap that the second-biggest refined copper
maker is paid to process and the by-product acid it produces.  The pre-tax operating loss in the quarter ended September
was 22 million euros ($30 million) from a 49 million-euro profit
a year earlier, the Hamburg-based company said in a statement.
The shares fell the most in three months in  Frankfurt .  For the year, profit slid 63 percent to 111 million euros.  Weak economies, restructuring of the company’s flat-rolled
product business and downtimes for maintenance of primary copper
output in Hamburg worsened conditions, Chief Executive Officer
Peter Willbrandt said in the statement. Aurubis’s results will
improve “significantly” from January, Willbrandt said.  Profit margins are being squeezed as weaker European demand
and slowing Chinese growth reduce copper prices. The metal has
dropped 9.7 percent on the London Metal Exchange this year.  Aurubis fell 4.7 percent, the biggest loss since Aug. 6, to
45 euros at the close in Frankfurt on almost five times daily
average trading in the previous three months.  The company in May cut its outlook, saying profit would be
“below last year’s earnings” rather than holding steady. In
August it said annual earnings would be “significantly down.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
