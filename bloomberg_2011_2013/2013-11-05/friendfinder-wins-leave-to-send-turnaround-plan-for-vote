FriendFinder Networks Inc. (FFNTQ) , the owner
of  Penthouse  magazine and thousands of adult-oriented websites,
won court approval to seek creditors’ votes on its restructuring
plan, which would turn the company over to noteholders.  U.S. Bankruptcy Judge  Christopher Sontchi  in Wilmington,
 Delaware , today approved the company’s disclosure statement, a
description of the reorganization plan.  The disclosure statement provides creditors with “all the
information necessary to make an informed decision on whether to
accept or reject the plan,” FriendFinder attorney Matthew L.
Hinker said at the hearing.  FriendFinder will seek court approval of its reorganization
plan to exit bankruptcy at a hearing scheduled for Dec. 16.
Objections to the plan have to be filed by Dec. 9.      The  Boca
Raton , Florida-based operator of websites such as
adultfriendfinder.com sought  bankruptcy protection  Sept. 17
listing assets of $465.3 million and debt of $661.9 million.  The restructuring would cut about $300 million in debt and
reduce annual interest expenses by about $50 million, according
to a statement. The reorganized company’s estimated enterprise
value was between $257.8 million and $285.4 million as of Aug.
31, according to the disclosure statement.  The reorganization plan is supported by about 78 percent of
the holders of 11.5 percent non-cash paying second-lien notes
and about 80 percent of the holders of 14 percent senior secured
first-lien notes, court papers show.  Debt Exchange  The second-lien noteholders, owed about $330.8 million,
would exchange debt for all of reorganized FriendFinder’s
equity. The first-lien noteholders, owed about $234.3 million,
would get cash and new notes. Current shareholders would receive
nothing, according to court documents.  FriendFinder has more than 8,000 websites spanning more
than 200 countries with more than 220 million members and over
750,000 paying subscribers, according to court papers. The
websites offer social-networking and adult dating, video-sharing
and live interactive video entertainment. In addition to
publishing Penthouse magazine, the company licenses the brand
for content such as pay-per-view programming.  Sales decreased about 10 percent to $293.7 million for the
fiscal year ended June 30. Revenue from social-networking
websites dropped more than 17 percent while live interactive-video websites generated about 8 percent more.  The company hasn’t made a  profit  since at least 2006 and
reported a second-quarter net loss of $10.3 million, or 32 cents
a share, on Aug. 15.  The lead case is In re PMGI Holdings Inc., 13-bk-12404,
 U.S. Bankruptcy Court , District of Delaware (Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
