Investors are no longer wondering if  BlackBerry Ltd. (BBRY)  will run out of cash. For some, it’s now a question of when.  The struggling smartphone maker embarked on a plan to raise $1 billion in convertible debt yesterday after the collapse of a $4.7 billion buyout deal. While the effort gives a cash infusion to the company, the move raised speculation by analysts and investors that its money is disappearing quickly. BlackBerry shares plunged 16 percent yesterday, bringing their year-to-date decline to 45 percent.  BlackBerry’s cash shrank by almost $500 million last quarter -- a burn rate that would use up most of its $2.6 billion cash and investments by the end of next year. The company also has about $2.9 billion in purchase commitments due within 12 months, according to filings. The dwindling funds will put a heavy burden on BlackBerry’s comeback attempt, said  John Stephenson , who helps manage about C$2.8 billion ($2.69 billion) at First Asset Investment Management Inc. in Toronto.  “It’s going to be very difficult to turn this around,” said Stephenson, whose firm owns some BlackBerry stock as part of exchange-traded funds. “They’ve lost so much ground.”  John Chen, the former chief executive officer of Sybase Inc., took the helm of BlackBerry yesterday, replacing CEO Thorsten Heins. As part of the shakeup,  Fairfax Financial Holdings Ltd. (FFH)  abandoned its plan to acquire the company, opting instead to become the lead investor in the bond sale. Fairfax, already the smartphone maker’s largest shareholder, will buy $250 million of the debentures, which can be converted into BlackBerry shares.  Seeking Stability  Chen plans to overhaul the company so it can survive in the long run -- rather than preparing it for a fire sale. Fairfax CEO Prem Watsa, who is rejoining BlackBerry’s board after spending three months trying to orchestrate a deal, expects the turnaround plan to bear fruit within a year and a half.

Heins’s Payout  Heins, who was CEO since January 2012, was in line to get a $22 million payout in the event of termination, including $16.1 million in stock, the company said in a proxy filing earlier this year. The shares have fallen about 50 percent since March, when the stock portion of the package was calculated. Taking into account that decline, Heins is now eligible for about $14 million. Adam Emery, a spokesman for BlackBerry, declined to comment on Heins’s compensation.  Chen successfully turned around Sybase, which he sold to  SAP AG (SAP)  for $5.8 billion in 2010. BlackBerry would present an even bigger challenge. After yesterday’s stock tumble, the company’s market value has fallen to $3.4 billion.  BlackBerry’s stock rebounded 2.7 percent to $6.67 at the close in  New York  after it was upgraded by analysts at  Societe Generale (GLE) , Deutsche Bank and MKM Partners LLC. Even so, it remains down about 95 percent from its 2008 peak, following years of losing ground to Apple Inc. and  Samsung Electronics (005930)  Co.  ‘All-Out Sprint’  BlackBerry needed to move very quickly to keep up with a competitive smartphone market -- something that hasn’t happened so far, said  Jack Ablin , chief investment officer at BMO Private Bank in  Chicago , who helps manage $66 billion in assets.  “The company needed an all-out sprint to keep up in that business and BlackBerry was not running fast enough,” he said.  The $1 billion debt sale will help keep the company afloat, though it’s hard to say for how long, said  Alexander Peterc , an analyst with Exane BNP Paribas in  London .  “Whatever they do will cost them more cash than they actually have in the bank today,” Peterc said. “They’re basically extending their lifeline by a couple of quarters with this billion. Otherwise, they would have run out of cash probably in a year’s time.”  Poor sales of phones and related services -- along with rising inventory costs and large purchase commitments -- have made it difficult for BlackBerry to find a buyer, said  Michael Walkley , an analyst with Canaccord Genuity Inc. in  Minneapolis . That’s why the company was forced to adopt the debt sale and management change as a Plan B, he said.  Right Mix  Chen, 58, said he sees a lot of assets inside BlackBerry -- its enterprise software, network, patent portfolio and instant-messaging application -- that could be better exploited.  “The question is: Could we actually pool these pieces together and differentiate ourselves in the market?” Chen said.  One way to stem BlackBerry’s cash burn would be to shut the unprofitable phone-manufacturing business and focus on selling software for managing devices, said Anil K. Doradla, an analyst at William Blair & Co. in Chicago.  “It’s a recurring business model, and more importantly, it’s a higher-margin business because they don’t build hardware platforms,” Doradla said.  Asked if he might close the handset business, Chen said he isn’t ruling anything out.  “I’m more focused on making sure our businesses are healthy and growing,” he said.  When Chen joined Sybase in 1998, the Dublin, California-based software maker was in the midst of a restructuring, had announced plans to cut 10 percent of its workforce and was trading near a record low. When he sold it to SAP, the price was more than six times higher.  BlackBerry’s odds of a fairy-tale ending look tougher, Stephenson said. He sees the company heading down the same path as Palm Inc. That company failed to turn itself around and was sold in 2010 to  Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ) , which discontinued Palm’s products.  “This is becoming a Palm Pilot of  Canada ,” he said.
