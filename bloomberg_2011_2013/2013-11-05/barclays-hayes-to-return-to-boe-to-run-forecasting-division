Simon Hayes , chief U.K. economist at
Barclays Plc, will return to the  Bank of England  after eight
years to run its economics forecast division, replacing Robert
Woods.  Hayes had worked at the central bank until leaving in 2005
to join Barclays in London. The BOE announced the appointment in
an e-mailed statement and said he will run the Conjunctural
Assessment and Projections Division, which oversees production
of quarterly forecasts used by the Monetary Policy Committee.  Woods joined the BOE on secondment from the U.K. Treasury
in October 2010, and will return there in the spring of next
year, the central bank said. He took over the division in 2012,
part of an overhaul of the economics unit as former Governor
 Mervyn King  approached the end of his term.  The head of CAPD “will provide strategic oversight of the
economic judgments and background analysis presented to the
MPC,” according to an ad for the position on the BOE’s website
last month. “They will facilitate the incorporation of insights
from staff, analysis and models from Monetary Analysis and the
wider bank.”  Hayes will report to BOE Chief Economist  Spencer Dale  in
his new role.  To contact the reporter on this story:
