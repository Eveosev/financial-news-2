Mosaic Co. (MOS) , the largest U.S. producer
of potash and phosphate fertilizer, said prices will “remain
challenging” into 2014 after a later-than-normal North American
application season and caution among dealers.  The estimated average price for its potash will be $285 to
$310 a metric ton in the current quarter, down from $342 in the
third quarter, the Plymouth Minnesota-based company said today
in a statement. Phosphates prices are seen falling to $370 to
$400 a metric ton, from $436.  Buyers of potash, a form of potassium that’s used to
increase crop yields, have deferred purchases since the end of
July after  Russia ’s OAO Uralkali, the world’s largest producer,
quit a sales accord with its Belarusian rival and announced
plans to boost output and take a larger market share.  “We anticipate strong demand in  North America  for the
remainder of calendar 2013, while international demand,
especially in India and  China , remains less predictable,”
Mosaic Chief Executive Officer Jim Prokopanko said in the
statement. “We expect pricing to remain challenging into 2014,
followed by a cyclical reversion, as demand growth absorbs the
additional supply of phosphate and potash.”  Mosaic also reported third-quarter profit and sales today
that missed analysts’ estimates. Net income dropped to 29 cents
a share from 98 cents a year earlier. Excluding writedowns and
other one-time items, profit was 51 cents a share, less than the
56-cent average of 14 estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Revenue dropped 28 percent to $1.91 billion, compared with
the $1.98 billion average estimate.  Mosaic dropped 0.9 percent to $46.30 at 9:53 a.m. in  New
York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
