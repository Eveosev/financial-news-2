U.K. stocks  retreated, erasing
yesterday’s advance, as the European Commission lowered its
forecast for economic growth in the euro area next year.  Banks posted the biggest drag on the  FTSE 100 Index. (UKX)   RSA
Insurance Group Plc (RSA)  slid 6.4 percent after lowering its
profitability forecast for the full year because of severe
weather in Europe and Canada.  Shire Plc (SHP)  added 1.5 percent after
saying it will seek U.S. regulatory approval in 2014 for a
treatment for compulsive overeating.  Marks & Spencer Group Plc (MKS) 
rose 3.5 percent after posting a smaller drop in clothing sales.  The FTSE 100 declined 39.36 points, or 0.6 percent, to
6,724.26 at 11:46 a.m. in London. The  equity benchmark  climbed
0.4 percent yesterday as HSBC Holdings Plc, its single largest
stock, posted 30 percent growth in quarterly profit. The broader
FTSE All-Share Index also slipped 0.6 percent today, while
Ireland’s ISEQ Index gained 0.4 percent.  “The recovery that is taking place in  Europe  is quite
fragile and you need to be very careful,” Ashok Shah, director
of investment at London & Capital Group Ltd., told Francine
Lacqua on Bloomberg Television. “All the banks need to be
recapitalized and the government debt levels continue to
increase. We’ve had a bounce from very low levels. From here on,
the recovery is going to be much slower.”  The commission predicted the 17-nation euro-area economy
will grow 1.1 percent in 2014, less than the 1.2 percent
 forecast in May . The European Union’s executive arm projected
unemployment of 12.2 percent in 2014, higher than the 12.1
percent rate that it had estimated.  Bank Structure  The commission will present proposals to regulate the
structure of European banks in a bid to manage lenders that have
become too big to fail, according to Olivier Guersent, an aide
to Financial Services Commissioner  Michel Barnier . The European
Parliament would only approve the measure after elections next
year, Guersent said at a conference in Brussels.  A gauge of  London-listed lenders  dropped 1.9 percent as
state-owned  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS)  fell 3.1 percent to
321.5 pence, its lowest price since Aug. 9.  Barclays Plc (BARC)  slipped
3 percent to 247.5 pence, while  Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY) 
declined 2.1 percent to 75.5 pence.  RSA Insurance slid 6.4 percent to 120.9 pence after saying
it will miss its previous target of 10 percent to 12 percent
return on equity. A windstorm in Europe last week, called the
St. Jude’s Day storm in the U.K., battered properties and
severed electricity cables from  England  to Scandinavia.  CSR Slides  CSR Plc (CSR)  plunged 7 percent to 508 pence after the mobile-chip designer forecast fourth-quarter sales of $195 million to
$215 million. The  average  analyst estimate compiled by Bloomberg
had called for revenue of $216 million.  Shire rose 1.5 percent to 2,861 pence, extending its rally
this year to 52 percent. Late-stage tests for Vyvanse showed
that the company’s best-selling drug produced better results
than a placebo in treating binge-eating disorder in adults,
according to a statement today. Shire already markets Vyvanse as
a treatment for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.  Marks & Spencer added 3.5 percent to 504 pence. The
retailer said general-merchandise sales at stores open at least
a year fell 1.3 percent in the quarter ended Sept. 28, its
smallest decline in more than two years. That beat the median
analyst  estimate  of a 1.5 percent drop.  Blinkx Plc (BLNX) , the developer of video-search technology spun
off from Autonomy Corp., jumped 11 percent to 186.3 pence, its
biggest rally in two months. Pretax profit more than quadrupled
to $10.8 million in the six months through Sept. 30 from the
same period last year, according to a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
