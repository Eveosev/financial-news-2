Servicers of mortgages backed by
 Fannie Mae (FNMA)  and  Freddie Mac  can no longer place insurance on
homes and then accept compensation from the insurers providing
the policies, the U.S. Federal Housing Finance Agency said.  Lenders arrange for such force-placed policies to protect
their collateral when homeowners allow their coverage to lapse.
The FHFA, regulator of Fannie Mae and  Freddie Mac (FMCC) , is
intervening because of concerns that commissions paid by
insurers to the banks were inflating the price of the policies
and exposing the two companies to the risk of lawsuits.  “FHFA remains concerned about the cost of lender-placed
insurance for Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and consumers,” FHFA
Acting Director Edward J. DeMarco said in a statement.  “One of
our primary responsibilities as conservator of  Fannie Mae  and
Freddie Mac is to preserve and conserve their assets on behalf
of taxpayers.”  The FHFA is also considering “additional measures,”
DeMarco said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
