Lesotho ’s Minister of Energy,
Meteorology and Water Affairs Timothy Thahane was dismissed
while he defends himself in court against fraud charges, the
government said.  Minister of Communications, Science and Technology Ts’eliso
Mokhosi will take over Thahane’s duties until a new appointment
is made, Deputy Prime Minister Mothetjoa Metsing told reporters
in the capital, Maseru, today.  Thahane, 73, was charged yesterday in Maseru Magistrates
Court with two cases of fraud involving more than 24 million
loti ($2.3 million), which relate to misrepresentations made
about farming policy when he served as minister of finance and
development planning. He is the second minister to be dismissed
since Lesotho’s three-party coalition government took office
after elections in May 2012.  Thahane, a former deputy governor of the South African
Reserve Bank, will challenge the charges in court, his lawyer
Letsika Qhalehang said yesterday. He was granted bail before the
case resumes in court on Nov. 7.  To contact the reporter on this story:
