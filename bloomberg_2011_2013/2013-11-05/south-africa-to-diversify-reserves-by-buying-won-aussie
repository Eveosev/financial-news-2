South Africa’s central bank plans to
diversify its foreign currency reserves by buying South Korean
won and the Australian and New Zealand dollars, Deputy Governor
 Daniel Mminele  said.  This follows an agreement earlier this year to invest about
$1.5 billion, or 3 percent of reserves, in Chinese bonds,
Mminele said at a conference in Johannesburg today, according to
a copy of the speech on the Reserve Bank’s website.  The bank, which had  gross reserves  of $50 billion at the
end of September, is seeking to broaden its foreign-currency
holdings and invest in other assets amid speculation the U.S.
Federal Reserve will start reducing bond purchases, Mminele
said. South Africa’s central bank has already started buying
covered bonds and mortgage-backed securities and recently began
trading in bond futures to hedge against rising yields, he said.  “The South African Reserve Bank is acutely aware of the
risks facing the global environment emanating from asset
tapering, and with this in mind made a strategic decision to
diversify its currency exposure to help insulate reserves from
this potential rise in U.S. Treasury yields,” Mminele said.  The bank has been building foreign-currency reserves to
help bolster the rand, which has dropped 17 percent against the
dollar this year. The local currency fell 0.7 percent to 10.2016
per dollar as of 12:30 p.m. in Johannesburg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
