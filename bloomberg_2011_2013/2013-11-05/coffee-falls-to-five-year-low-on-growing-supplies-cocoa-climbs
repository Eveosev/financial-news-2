Arabica coffee fell to the lowest in
almost five years in New York on ample supplies from  Brazil  and
Colombia, the biggest growers of the beans favored by  Starbucks
Corp. (SBUX)  Cocoa rebounded.  Brazil’s crop will be a record for a year in which trees
enter the lower-yielding half of a two-year cycle, broker  INTL
FCStone Inc. (INTL)  said in a report e-mailed yesterday. Conditions for
the development of next year’s harvest appear to be “good,” it
said. Farmers in Colombia will reap 10.6 million to 10.8 million
bags in 2013, exceeding a target of 10 million bags, the
Colombian Coffee Growers Federation said. Central America
started harvesting last month. A bag weighs 132 pounds.  “The global coffee harvest kicked into high gear in
Colombia, Central America and Brazil,” FCStone said. “The
Brazilian ‘off-year’ crop is expected to come in a new record
high and is one of the reasons prices are struggling.”  Arabica for December delivery fell 0.3 percent to $1.034 a
pound by 5:57 a.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in New York after
dropping earlier today to $1.031, the lowest for a most-active
contract since Dec. 5, 2008. Prices are probably heading for $1,
FCStone said. Robusta coffee for January delivery fell 1 percent
to $1,468 a metric ton on NYSE Liffe in  London .  Futures traded in New York declined 28 percent this year,
making the beans the third-worst performer in the Standard &
Poor’s gauge of 24 raw materials, after corn and silver.  Raw sugar for March delivery rose 0.4 percent to 18.39
cents a pound in New York. Refined, or white, sugar for delivery
in March gained 0.3 percent to $487.90 a ton in London.  Outflows from long sugar ETPs last week were $3.1 million,
the highest since April, according to ETF Securities. Sugar
prices dropped 5.8 percent this year and may decline even more
with the Indian harvest starting with “strong export orders,”
Nitesh Shah, an associate director at the  Jersey , U.K.-based
company, said in a report e-mailed today.  Cocoa for delivery in December gained 0.5 percent to $2,668
a ton on ICE. Cocoa for delivery in March climbed 0.8 percent to
1,710 pounds ($2,746) a ton on NYSE Liffe.  To contact the reporter on this story:
