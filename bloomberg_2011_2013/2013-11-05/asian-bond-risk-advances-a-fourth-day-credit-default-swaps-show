The cost of insuring corporate and
sovereign bonds in Asia against non-payment is poised to rise
for a fourth day, according to traders of credit default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  climbed 3 basis points to 137 basis
points as of 8:51 a.m. in Hong Kong, Standard Chartered Plc
prices show. The gauge is set for its longest streak of
increases since Aug. 22, according to CMA, which is owned by
McGraw-Hill Cos. and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the
private market.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index declined 0.5 basis points to
93.75 basis points as of 9:44 a.m. in  Tokyo , according to
Citigroup Inc. prices. The index has dropped almost 4 basis
points since Sept. 30, CMA data show.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index was unchanged at 105
basis points as of 11:42 a.m. in Sydney, Westpac Banking Corp.
prices show. The benchmark dropped about 20 basis points this
quarter, according to data provider CMA.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
credit quality. A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
