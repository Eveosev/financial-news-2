Sport’s top court reduced tennis
player  Viktor Troicki ’s doping suspension by six months after the
judges decided the Serb didn’t purposely fail to provide a blood
sample at a tournament in April.  The  International Tennis Federation  suspended the 27-year-old for 18 months in July, saying he refused to give a blood
sample during the Monte Carlo Masters event because he was
feeling unwell.  Troicki, who did provide a urine sample, appealed to the
Court of Arbitration for Sport in August. He said his failure to
provide blood was neither intentional nor negligent. His
suspension was reduced to 12 months.  The Lausanne, Switzerland-based CAS ruled that although
missing the blood test was still an offense, there was “no
suggestion that Mr. Troicki intended to evade the detection of a
banned substance in his system.”  The Serb will be permitted to return to the tour on July 15
next year, which means he’ll miss the first three Grand Slams.  Troicki rose to as high as No. 12 in the  men’s world
rankings  in 2011 and reached the fourth round of this year’s
French Open. He was ranked 53rd when the ITF suspended him.  To contact the reporter on this story:
