Charter Communications Inc. (CHTR) , the
fourth-largest U.S. cable company, reported a narrower loss than
a year earlier after revenue from Internet services helped
offset the continuing defection of television subscribers.  The third-quarter net loss shrank to $70 million, or 68
cents a share, from $103 million, or $1.03, a year earlier, the
Stamford, Connecticut-based company said in a statement. Sales
climbed 5.4 percent to $2.12 billion, in line with estimates.  Chief Executive Officer  Tom Rutledge , who joined the
company in February of last year, is relying on broadband
service to fuel growth. Charter had 4.29 million video customers
last quarter, surpassing its 4.18 million video subscribers -- a
sign of the diminishing importance of TV for the cable industry.  Charter shares fell 3.5 percent to $131.06 at the close in
New York. The stock has gained 72 percent this year.  Billionaire  John Malone  bought a 27 percent stake in
Charter earlier this year through his holding company  Liberty
Media Corp. (LMCB)  The cable pioneer has vowed to turn Charter into a
“horizontal acquisition machine.” Time Warner Cable Inc. makes
sense as a possible merger target, he has said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
