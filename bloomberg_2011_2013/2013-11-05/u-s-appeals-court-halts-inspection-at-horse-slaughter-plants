Federal inspection at horse-meat
plants, which was scheduled to resume as early as today, was
temporary halted by a U.S. appeals court following an emergency
request by opponents of commercial horse slaughter.  The  U.S. Court of Appeals  in Denver issued a temporary stay
today “pending further order” and instructed the U.S.
Agriculture Department to respond by Nov. 7 to the opponents’
request to block inspection at three slaughterhouses while they
appeal a federal judge’s Nov. 1 order allowing inspections to
proceed without an environmental impact review.  The  U.S. Humane Society  and the state of  New Mexico  are
among opponents who said today that, unless the appeals court
acted, the USDA will allow horse-slaughter to proceed in the
U.S. for the first time in more than six years, “exposing the
environment to the toxic byproducts created by the slaughter of
animals raised outside a regulated industry.”  From 2006 through 2011, Congress halted funding for
inspection at horse-slaughter plants. The prohibition on funding
wasn’t extended for 2012 and 2013, thereby allowing commercial
horse slaughter to resume legally. The USDA has received
applications for horse-slaughter inspections in five states,
according to the Nov. 1 court order.  The case is Front Range Equine Rescue v. Vilsack, 13-2187,
U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit (Denver).  To contact the reporter on this story:
