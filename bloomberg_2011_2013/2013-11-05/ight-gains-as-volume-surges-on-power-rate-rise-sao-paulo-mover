Light SA (LIGT3)  advanced to an eight-month
high amid a surge in trading volume as  Brazil ’s utility
regulator allowed the company to increase electricity rates
after previously signaling it might order a reduction.  The  shares  rose 1.6 percent to 20.53 reais at 1:23 p.m. in
Sao Paulo. A close at that level would be the highest since
March 12. Trading volume was 4.7 times the full-day average of
the past three months. The gain was the second biggest among
stocks on the Ibovespa benchmark, which  declined  0.9 percent.  Aneel, which oversees Brazilian electric utilities, said in
a statement today that it allowed Light to increase rates by 3.7
percent effective Nov. 7. The regulator had said at a Sept. 5
preliminary meeting that it could order Light to cut rates by as
much as 3.3 percent for households and 6.7 percent for
businesses.  The press office for Light, which distributes electricity
in Rio de Janeiro state, didn’t immediately respond to an e-mail
and phone call seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
