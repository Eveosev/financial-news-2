Rupert Murdoch ’s 21st Century Fox
Inc. film and television company reported fiscal first-quarter
profit that missed analysts’ estimates after a tough quarter for
the film division and investments in cable networks.  Profit from continuing operations fell to $768 million, or
33 cents a share, from $2.25 billion, or 95 cents, a year
earlier, New York-based Fox said in a  statement  yesterday.
Analysts expected 35 cents, the average of 23  estimates  compiled
by Bloomberg. Operating income rose 1.8 percent to $1.62
billion.  Murdoch is converting cable channels with smaller audiences
into networks with a potentially bigger draw. In August, the
racing channel Speed become Fox Sports 1 and Fox Soccer
converted to FXX, networks that will take a year or more to
increase revenue and to recoup higher programming costs. Fox is
also spending to develop programs for its Fox broadcast network,
where viewership tumbled in the season ended in May.  “The investment we are making, including the launch of FXX
and Fox Sports 1, will drive future sustained growth,” Murdoch
said in the statement.  Sales increased 18 percent to $7.06 billion, beating the
$6.82 billion average of 20 analysts’ estimates.  Fox, owner of the Twentieth Century Fox film studio and
satellite pay-TV systems in Germany and  Italy , fell 1.7 percent
to $33.50 in extended trading yesterday. The stock lost 0.2
percent to $34.09 at the close in  New York  and has increased 51
percent this year compared with a 24 percent gain for the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  Business Split  Murdoch, 82, split off his slower-growing News Corp.
newspaper publishing company on June 28 from the film and TV
operations of Fox. The print-media business includes the Wall
Street Journal and the New York Post.  Operating income  at Fox’s cable division, excluding
depreciation and amortization, fell 2.4 percent to $991 million,
while sales increased 12 percent to $2.81 billion. Costs
increased 22 percent in the period, with two thirds of that due
to start-up expenses for Fox Sports 1 and FXX, as well as
acquisitions of ESPN Star Sports and SportsTime Ohio, the
company said.  Television profit gained 30 percent to $231 million from a
year earlier, on double the amount of retransmission fees from
pay-TV systems, the company said. Sales in the division rose 7.8
percent to $1.05 billion.  Film Studio  Profit at  filmed entertainment  fell 24 percent to $328
million, as revenue increased 9.4 percent to $2.12 billion.
Titles in the period had tough comparisons to last year’s “Ice
Age: Continental Drift,” the company said. The revenue gains
were driven by sales of “ Modern Family ” reruns and older
episodes of “New Girl” to  Netflix Inc. (NFLX) , Fox said.  The company’s satellite-TV unit doubled profit to $190
million, while sales jumped 68 percent to $1.39 billion. The
results were driven by the consolidation of Sky Deutschland
after the acquisition of a controlling stake, Fox said.  Net income  for the quarter amounted to $1.26 billion, or 54
cents a share, including a gain of $487 million from
discontinued operations. Fox had year earlier net income of
$2.23 billion, or 94 cents a share, including a gain from the
sale of a stake in NDS Group Ltd.  To contact the reporter on this story:
