AT&T Inc. (T)  sold 2 billion euros ($2.7
billion) of bonds to help fund tender offers for as much as $6
billion of dollar-denominated notes.  The largest U.S. phone company issued 1 billion euros each
of 2.65 percent securities due in December 2021 that pay 95
basis points more than the mid-swap rate and 3.5 percent, 12-year notes yielding 130 more than benchmarks, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The securities are expected to be rated
A3 by Moody’s Investors Service.  AT&T is seeking to redeem notes including $896 million of
8.75 percent securities due in 2031 and linked to its New
Cingular Wireless unit, according to a statement. That’s one of
24 debt securities that make up the tender offers.  AT&T sold 1.25 billion euros of 2.5 percent bonds in March
that mature in 10 years, Bloomberg data show. Those notes,
ranked A3 by Moody’s and an equivalent A- at  Standard & Poor’s ,
traded at 97.69 cents on the dollar yesterday to yield 2.78
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
