A blueprint for curbing rent
increases in Germany was agreed by party negotiators drafting
the coalition contract for  Chancellor Angela Merkel ’s next
government.  The proposal presented by Merkel’s Christian Democratic
bloc and the  Social Democratic Party  includes tax incentives for
residential developers and allowing German state governments to
restrain rents in areas with big increases, Transportation
Minister Peter Ramsauer, whose portfolio includes urban
development, said in Berlin today.  Ramsauer and Florian Pronold, the SPD negotiator, announced
the preliminary deal to reporters as Merkel builds her third-term government with the Social Democrats as junior partner. The
agreement requires final approval and funding commitments by
party leaders including Merkel, who won German elections on
Sept. 22.  To contact the reporter on this story:
