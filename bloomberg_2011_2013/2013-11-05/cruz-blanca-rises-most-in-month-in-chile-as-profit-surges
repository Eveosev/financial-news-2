Cruz Blanca Salud SA (CRUZBLAN) ,  Chile ’s third-largest health insurer and medical-services provider, rose the
most in a month after reporting an increase in quarterly profits
as the company secured more insurance policy holders.  Cruz Blanca advanced 4 percent to 364.99 pesos at 12:41
p.m. in Santiago, the most on a closing basis since Oct. 4. The
stock led gains among members of the IPSA benchmark index, which
rose 0.2 percent.  Net income in the quarter increased 67 percent from a year
ago to 3.8 billion pesos ($7.3 million) while earnings before
interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, or Ebitda, rose 25
percent to $10.1 billion pesos, according to a filing yesterday
from the Santiago-based company. Ebitda was 26 percent higher
than Banco Santander SA’s estimate, based on a note the bank
sent to clients today.  “The insurance business delivered a positive surprise,”
Banco Santander analysts Francisco Echeverria, Francisco Errandonea and Daniel Gewehr wrote in a note. “We expect a
positive reaction in the stock price.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
