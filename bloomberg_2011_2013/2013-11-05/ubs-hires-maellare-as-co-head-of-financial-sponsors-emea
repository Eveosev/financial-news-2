UBS AG (UBSN) , Switzerland’s biggest bank,
named Simona Maellare as a managing director and co-head of the
banks team advising private-equity clients in Europe, the  Middle
East  and Africa.  Maellare will run the financial sponsors team with Michael
Abraham in the region,  William Vereker , head of corporate client
solutions, said in a memo to employees today. Maellare spent the
past seven years at Bank of America Corp. in London in a similar
position, according to the memo confirmed by a spokeswoman.  Mark Gallagher, previously the co-head of financial
sponsors EMEA, becomes chairman of financial sponsors and
retains responsibility for corporate client solutions in
Ireland, Vereker said in the statement.  Maellare and Abraham will both report to James Hartop, CCS
EMEA head of coverage and advisory.  A spokeswoman for Bank of America didn’t immediately
respond to telephone requests seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
