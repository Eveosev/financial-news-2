3D Systems Corp. (DDD)  shares climbed to a
record amid speculation it could be the next maker of printers
that create three-dimensional objects to become a takeover
target.  Shares of 3D Systems  rose  6 percent to $70.01, the highest
close since at least December 1989 and a 23 percent increase
from Oct. 28, the day before the company reported third-quarter
sales that topped analysts’ estimates. About 9.94 million shares
were traded, or more than two-and-a-half times the three-month
average.  With 3D Systems’ growing revenue in a nascent industry, the
company could attract possible bidders, Angelo Zino, an analyst
at S&P Capital IQ, said in a phone interview. “Given the growth
potential in this space, would that be a possibility?
Absolutely.”  Popularity for 3-D printers has increased among engineers,
designers and manufacturers as prices have fallen, making them
affordable to more consumers. Other companies in the industry
have already started to join forces as they seek to tap rising
demand.  Stratasys Ltd. (SSYS)  agreed in June to buy startup MakerBot
Industries LLC for at least $403 million.  3D Systems, based in  Rock Hill ,  South Carolina , last week
raised its forecast for full-year revenue to as much as $530
million from a previous projection for a maximum of $510
million. In 2012, revenue was $353.6 million. In the third
quarter, 3D Systems reported sales of $135.7 million, topping
analysts’ estimates of $132.3 million.  Alyssa Reichental, a spokeswoman for 3D Systems, said the
company is “not currently in discussions regarding an
acquisition of the company’s shares.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
