Feeder-cattle futures rose for the
second straight day on signs that lower grain costs are spurring
feedlots to buy more animals from U.S. ranchers. Hogs fell.  Corn prices on the Chicago Board of Trade have plunged 39
percent this year amid forecasts for a record U.S. crop. The
grain is used by feedlots to add weight to animals before they
are sent to meatpackers. Feeder cattle rose to a record $1.6995
a pound on Oct. 14 and are headed for the fifth straight annual
gain, the longest rally since 1979.  “Cheaper feed makes higher-priced feeder cattle,” Justin Lewis, a vice president of KIS Futures Inc. in  Oklahoma City ,
said in a telephone interview. “This is the time of year people
are buying feeder cattle.”  On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, feeder-cattle futures
for January settlement rose 0.7 percent to close at $1.65075 at
1 p.m. The price, up 0.2 percent yesterday, has climbed 7
percent this year.  Feedlot operators typically buy 1-year-old cattle that
weigh 500 pounds (227 kilograms) to 800 pounds, called feeders,
which are fattened on corn until they weigh 1,300 pounds and are
sold to meatpackers.  Cattle futures for December delivery fell less than 0.1
percent to $1.3205 a pound.  Hog futures for December settlement declined 0.1 percent to
88.25 cents a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
