YPF SA (YPF) ,  Argentina ’s largest oil
company, said third-quarter profit climbed 87 percent on higher
production.  Net income increased to 1.4 billion pesos ($237 million),
or 3.6 pesos a share, from 756 million pesos, or 1.92 pesos, a
year earlier, Buenos Aires-based YPF said in a statement to
Argentina’s regulator after the market closed today. That’s
above the per-share profit excluding some items of 2.37-pesos
estimated by Santiago Wesenack, an analyst who covers the
company for Raymond James SA in Buenos Aires.  President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner’s government
seized a 51 percent YPF stake from Madrid-based Repsol SA in
April 2012 after the company’s  output  had declined at an average
6 percent rate for almost a decade. Argentina expropriated YPF
to stem fuel imports that doubled to $9.4 billion in 2011 and
cost the country $10 billion in 2012.  “Increased sales of fuel and natural gas triggered the
results,” YPF said in the statement.  YPF, after securing shale partnerships with  Chevron Corp. (CVX) 
and Dow Chemical Co., is seeking more international partners for
a $37 billion, 5-year expansion plan to develop the Vaca Muerta
shale formation at the world’s second-largest shale gas deposit
and fourth-largest shale oil reservoir in Argentina’s Patagonia
region.  Dollar Debt  Crude output increased 3.4 percent in the quarter from a
year earlier, YPF said today. YPF’s oil and natural gas
production increased for six and five consecutive months,
respectively, the company said Nov. 1.  YPF increased cash on hand by 1.8 billion pesos in the
quarter to 6.9 billion pesos. While debt increased by 2 billion
pesos in the period, the net total debt was unchanged at 19.2
billion pesos. The average cost of peso debt was 19.89 percent
and 5.4 percent for dollar debt.  The earnings report was released after the close of regular
trading in  New York . The market in  Buenos Aires  is closed
tomorrow for a bank holiday. YPF’s  American depositary receipts 
gained 6.8 percent to close at $21.35 in New York. The ADRs have
increased 47 percent this year.  YPF is scheduled to have an earnings conference call with
investors at 8:30 a.m. New York time tomorrow. To access the
