An investor bought $16.6 million in
call options on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, a strategy that
will be profitable if the U.S. equity benchmark rallies in the
next five months.  The trader purchased 17,800 March calls with a strike price
of 1,925 on the S&P 500, making it the  most-traded  contract on
the index, according to data compiled by New York-based Trade
Alert LLC. The person, who picked up three other bullish options
on the stock gauge, will make money on all the contracts should
the S&P 500 advance more than 9 percent by March.  “It’s such a huge trade,” Frederic Ruffy, a Chicago-based
senior options strategist at Trade Alert, said in a phone
interview. “It’s hard to say what the motivation is. It could
be an outright bullish bet on stocks or someone who is massively
bearish and uses options as a hedge.”  Stocks have soared this year, putting the S&P 500 on track
for the biggest gain since 2003, after companies reported
higher-than-estimated earnings and the Federal Reserve kept its
stimulus plan. Instead of selling shares to lock in profits
during rallies, investors almost always add them in the final
quarter. The S&P 500’s return has been positive over November
and December every year since the bull market started in 2009.  The March 1,925 calls cost $4.40 per contract, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The investor bought 4,300 March
calls with a strike price of 1,850 for $15.90 per contract as
well as 8,700 January 1,920 calls for $1 each. About 1,800
January contracts with a 1,850 strike price were purchased for
approximately $5.80 each. The total coast of the trade was about
$16.6 million, the data show.  Real Money  “It’s a lot of premium,” Neil Azous, founder of Rareview
Macro LLC, a  Stamford , Connecticut-based advisory and research
firm, said in an interview. “It could be a real-money investor
or a large hedge fund underweight U.S. equities.”  The S&P 500 has risen in the final two months of the year
82 percent of the time since 1928 when the benchmark gauge
advanced at least 10 percent through October, data compiled by
S&P and Bloomberg show. The mean November and December increase
of 6 percent would lift the index to 1,862.79, an all-time high.  A total of about 563,000 options traded on the S&P 500
today, 20 percent below the 10-day average. More than 243,000
calls to buy the index changed hands. The contracts involved in
today’s trade, which expire on Jan. 18 and March 22, accounted
for 5.8 percent of the trading.  The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, the
gauge of S&P 500 options known as the VIX, climbed 2.6 percent
to 13.27. The measure is down 26 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
