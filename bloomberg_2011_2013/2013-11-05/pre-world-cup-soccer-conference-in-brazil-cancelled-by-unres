A pre- World Cup  soccer conference in
 Rio de Janeiro  has been cancelled because of civil unrest in the
city, organizers said.  The Soccerex Global Convention, which features many of the
sport’s top executives, was scheduled for the Maracana stadium
from Nov. 30 to Dec. 5. Soccerex said in an e-mailed statement
the Rio secretary of sport took the “political decision to
withdraw‘‘ support due to protests that have continued in the
country for five months.  Mass demonstrations began in June over issues ranging from
a lack of decent health and education provision to political
corruption and public spending on sporting events. The World Cup
will be played in  Brazil  from June 12 to July 13.  Soccerex said it intends to instigate legal proceedings for
‘‘substantial compensation’’ against the Rio state government
for breaching contractual obligations. E-mail messages to the
Rio state government weren’t immediately returned.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
