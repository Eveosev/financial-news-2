The  University of Texas  hired Steve
Patterson as athletic director, bringing him back to the school
where he played basketball and earned undergraduate and law
degrees to run the richest program in college sports, the  Dallas
Morning News  said.  Patterson, a former executive in the  National Basketball
Association  and the National Football League, was picked over
West Virginia Athletic Director Oliver Luck to succeed DeLoss Dodds, who is retiring, the newspaper said, citing people
familiar with the search that it didn’t identify.  Patterson has been Arizona State’s vice president for
university athletics since March 2012. He’ll assume control of
the richest college athletic program in the U.S. with revenue of
$163.3 million in fiscal 2011-12, according to the school’s
financial reports.  The Texas football team is 6-2 this season, 5-0 in the Big
12 conference to top the standings with No. 6 Baylor (7-0, 4-0).
The Longhorns last played for the national title in 2009, losing
to Alabama, 37-21.  To contact the reporter on this story:
