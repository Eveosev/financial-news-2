Houston Texans coach Gary Kubiak, who
collapsed on the way to the locker at halftime during last
weekend’s game, suffered a mini-stroke, the team said.  Kubiak, 52, was released from Houston Methodist Hospital
and is expected to make a full recovery, according to a
 statement  from the National Football League team. It didn’t say
when he would return to coaching.  “I’ve been through an ordeal and my focus now is to get
back to good health,” Kubiak said in the statement.  Kubiak collapsed on his way to the locker room at halftime
of the Nov. 3 game with his team leading the Indianapolis Colts
by 18 points. Defensive coordinator Wade Phillips stepped in for
Kubiak as the Colts staged a second-half comeback that gave the
Texans their sixth straight defeat, 27-24. The team didn’t name
an interim coach.  The medical term for the injury Kubiak suffered is
transient ischemic attack, which occurs when the blood flowing
to the brain is interrupted, usually by a narrowing of the
vessels or a clot, according to the Mayo Clinic  website .  Denver Broncos coach John Fox had aortic valve replacement
surgery yesterday and is sidelined indefinitely, with defensive
coordinator Jack Del Rio named as his interim replacement. Fox,
58, was diagnosed after feeling lightheaded while playing golf
last week, when the Broncos had their schedule bye.  To contact the reporter on this story:
