Light Louisiana Sweet crude fell
against Brent, extending a weakening trend against the European
benchmark that reached an all-time low last month.  LLS slid 99 cents to a $8.81-a-barrel discount to Dated
Brent at 4:52 p.m. in New York, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The discount averaged $6.54 for the month of October.  “LLS is hanging in at lower levels and it remains
significantly under Brent,” said  Andrew Lebow , a senior vice
president at Jefferies Bache LLC in New York. “Maybe that’s a
good thing, because one thing we need is lower imports, and this
lower differential may help that.”  The benchmark for Gulf Coast light crudes was unchanged at
a premium of $3 a barrel to West Texas Intermediate at 3:41 p.m.
in New York, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Heavy Louisiana
Sweet held at a $2.90-a-barrel premium to WTI.  The premium for Thunder Horse widened 25 cents to $1.25 a
barrel. Mars Blend’s discount narrowed 20 cents to $1.65.
Poseidon weakened 15 cents to a discount of $2.45 a barrel to
the domestic benchmark.  To contact the reporter on this story:
