Government offices were shut, urban
transport was disrupted and ferries remained in dock across
 Greece  today as workers respected a general strike and
protesters marched on parliament in  Athens .  Police estimated that as many as 11,500 demonstrators
marched through the center of the capital in driving rain,
shouting slogans against austerity measures tied to Greece’s 240
billion euros ($324 billion) in bailouts, a day after
representatives from the European Commission, the  International
Monetary Fund  and the  European Central Bank  resumed their
inspection of the country’s progress in meeting the terms of the
rescue.  Workers from the country’s main labor unions stayed off the
job in their fourth general strike of the year, and civil-aviation workers held a three-hour work stoppage at midday,
prompting flight delays and cancellations.  Finance Minister Yannis Stournaras said late yesterday that
he had a “general discussion” with the troika of officials
from the euro area and the IMF. The country’s budget plan is
realistic and the government is trying to convince the troika to
give Greece a positive review, Stournaras said.  Prime Minister Antonis Samaras’s government presented a
draft budget last month forecasting a surplus before interest
costs of 344 million euros this year and one of 2.8 billion
euros in 2014, or 1.6 percent of gross domestic product, that
would qualify Greece for additional debt relief. The government
and Greece’s creditors disagree with the extent of fiscal
measures needed for the country to achieve these projections.  The  Greek economy , already in the sixth year of a recession
that’s destroyed about a quarter of GDP and sent unemployment to
almost 28 percent, is expected to contract 4 percent in 2013,
the European Commission said this week. A gradual return to
growth is forecast for 2014, with Greek GDP expanding 0.6
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
