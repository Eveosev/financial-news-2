Corn dropped for a fifth day,
matching a three-year low it reached yesterday, as harvesting
progressed in the U.S. amid speculation the government will
increase its production estimate this week. Wheat fell.  Corn for December delivery lost as much as 0.2 percent to
$4.2525 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade, matching
yesterday’s intraday low that was the lowest price for a most-active contract since Aug. 26, 2010. Futures traded at $4.255 by
11:18 a.m.  Singapore  time, slumping 39 percent this year.  The U.S. harvest may reach a record 14.03 billion bushels,
or 1.3 percent more than the Department of Agriculture’s
prediction in September and 30 percent larger than in 2012,
according to a Bloomberg survey of 36 analysts. The USDA will
update its forecasts on Nov. 8. U.S. farmers collected 73
percent of the crop as of Nov. 3 from 59 percent on Oct. 27, the
agency said in a  report  yesterday. The U.S. is the world’s
biggest grower.  “Seasonal harvest pressure is the main factor weighing on
corn prices,” Vanessa Tan, an analyst at Phillip Futures Pte in
Singapore, said by e-mail.  Corn may slump to $3 a bushel in 2014, INTL FCStone Inc.
said yesterday. The commodity researcher and broker raised its
U.S. harvest estimate last week to 14.367 billion bushels.  Wheat for December delivery dropped 0.1 percent to $6.62 a
bushel, matching yesterday’s low, the cheapest since Sept. 25.
Soybeans for January delivery gained 0.2 percent to $12.5925 a
bushel, climbing for a second day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
