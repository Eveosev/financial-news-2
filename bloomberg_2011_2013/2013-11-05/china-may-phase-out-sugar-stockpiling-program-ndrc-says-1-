China , the second-biggest sugar
consumer, may phase out a stockpiling program that boosted
inventories to a record while failing to lift domestic prices,
according to an official at the country’s top planning agency.  The effort cost the government almost $3 billion in the
past two years, according to an estimate by Xinhu Futures Co. It
may be partially replaced by direct subsidies to cane and beet
farmers as early as the crop year beginning October 2014, said
Zhao Lihua, a director at the economy and trade division of the
National Development and Reform Commission.  While China has been buying the sweetener for the past
decade to boost incomes of 40 million sugar farmers, local
prices have slumped 9.1 percent since reaching a five-month high
on Jan. 8. Imports climbed to a record 4.5 million metric tons
in 2011-12.  “We have this dilemma,” said Zhao at a conference in
Kunming in the country’s southwest on Nov. 1. “The more the
government stockpiles when local supply exceeds demand, the
worse the oversupply becomes because we end up importing more.”  Refined sugar for May delivery on the Zhengzhou Commodity
Exchange climbed 0.7 percent to close at 5,195  yuan  a ton (38.64
cents a pound), while raw sugar in  New York  was at 18.32 cents a
pound on Nov. 4. Prices in New York will average 17.25 cents a
pound in the second quarter of next year, Deutsche Bank AG says.  Stockpiles swelled to 6 million tons at the end of
September, equivalent to nearly half of the country’s output
last year, according to Wanda Futures Co. China doesn’t publish
stockpile data.  Global Surplus  Global demand will rise 2.3 percent to a record 167.3
million tons in 2013-14, as production expands 0.2 percent to
174.9 million tons, the U.S. Department of Agriculture
estimates. China will have reserves of 5.48 million tons by
September, according to the USDA.  China will import 2.5 million tons in 2013-14, 43 percent
less than a year earlier, said  Jonathan Kingsman , founder of
Kingsman, a unit of McGraw Hill Financial Inc.’s Platts. The
nation may buy as little as 1.4 million tons, Robin Shaw, an
analyst at Marex Spectron Group in  London , said in October.  China controls its imports through quotas agreed under the
 World Trade Organization , permitting about 1.9 million tons a
year at a 15 percent duty. Inbound shipments outside the limit
are levied a 50 percent duty.  ‘Excessive Imports’  “Excessive imports have caused a glut in the local market
and hurt the local industry,” said Bu Zhengfa, head of China
National Light Industry Council, in Kunming on Nov. 1. “China’s
sugar-crushing industry suffered sector-wide losses last year
for the first time in more than 10 years.”  Imports will fall to 1.5 million-2 million tons in 2013-14
as the cost of sugar imports outside of the alloted quota will
rise above 5,500 yuan a ton, said Jia Zhiren, head of the China
Sugar Association, in Kunming on Nov. 2.  The government bought up a net 2.64 million tons of local
sugar in the two years that ended September at above-market
rates to mop up a domestic surplus, said Yongan Futures Co.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
