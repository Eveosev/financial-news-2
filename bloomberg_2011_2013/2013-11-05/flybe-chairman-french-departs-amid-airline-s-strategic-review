Flybe Group Plc (FLYB) ,  Europe ’s largest
independent regional airline, said Chairman Jim French will
leave the carrier after 23 years amid a strategic review to
restore profitability.  French, 60, will be replaced by Simon Laffin as non-executive chairman with immediate effect, the Exeter, England-based company said in a statement today. Laffin, 54, is also
chairman of health care property business  Assura Group Ltd. (AGR)   French, who became chief executive officer in 2001 and
added the chairman’s role in 2005, handed the CEO role to former
EasyJet Plc executive Saad Hammad on Aug. 1. Hammad has begun a
series of management changes and a restructuring at the airline
with a strategic review to be completed this month.  “Flybe has many challenges ahead, but I believe that under
the new management team the group will be developed into a
leading regional aviation operator,” Laffin said in the
statement.  Management is targeting 40 million pounds ($63.8 million)
of cost savings in fiscal year 2014. In September, Hammad
announced that Flybe U.K. and Flybe Outsourcing Solutions would
be disbanded and integrated into one operation.  Britain’s biggest domestic airline is seeking to bolster
its balance sheet amid reduced demand and high fuel prices. The
company sold landing slots at London Gatwick airport to EasyJet
for 20 million pounds, is renegotiating pilot pay, and has
delayed deliveries of regional jets from  Embraer SA. (ERJ)   FlyBe  shares  have advanced 28 percent this year, valuing
the business at 49 million pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
