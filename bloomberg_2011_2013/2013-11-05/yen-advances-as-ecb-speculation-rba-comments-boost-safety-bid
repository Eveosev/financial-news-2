The dollar rose to an almost seven-week high after a gauge of  service industries  climbed more than
forecast in October, adding to the case for the  Federal Reserve 
to taper monthly bond purchases.  The euro dropped against the yen after European Central
Bank Executive Board member Joerg Asmussen said the economic
recovery is “still very green” before the bank’s policy
meeting this week.  Japan ’s currency appreciated versus most of
its 16 most-traded counterparts as the Bank of Japan’s governor
 said  efforts to dispel the country’s deflation are succeeding.
 Brazil ’s real fell against all major peers.  The dollar rally “continued with fairly decent readings on
the  Institute for Supply Management ” non-manufacturing index,
Fabian Eliasson, head of U.S. currency sales in  New York  at
 Mizuho Financial Group Inc. (8411) , said in a phone interview.
“Overall, the market turned a little bit dollar positive.”  The Bloomberg  U.S. Dollar  Index, which tracks the greenback
against 10 major currencies, rose 0.3 percent to 1,015.99 at 5
p.m. New York time after touching 1,016.64. The index reached
1,017 yesterday, the highest since Sept. 18.  The yen rose 0.4 percent to 132.72 per euro after
appreciating to 132.37, the strongest level since Oct. 10.
Japan’s currency gained 0.1 percent to 98.50 per dollar. The
euro dropped 0.3 percent to $1.3474 after sliding to $1.3442
yesterday, the weakest since Sept. 18.  Kiwi Rises  New Zealand’s dollar climbed against its U.S. counterpart
after the nation’s employment rose 1.2 percent from the prior
quarter, according to  Statistics New Zealand . The currency
climbed 1 percent to 83.65 U.S. cents, the biggest increase
since Sept. 18 on a closing basis.  The real declined to the weakest versus the greenback since
Sept. 11 as Brazil central-bank President Alexandre Tombini said
policy makers must be “especially vigilant” on inflation. The
real depreciated 1.9 percent to 2.2890 per U.S. dollar after
touching 2.2939, and has dropped 2.2 percent this month, the
most among major currencies.  South Africa ’s rand weakened against the dollar on concern
labor disputes at platinum mines will weigh on the nation’s
current-account deficit.  The  rand  dropped 1.1 percent to 10.2444 per dollar,
bringing its decline this month to 1.8 percent.  The pound advanced for a fifth day against the euro after
U.K. services output accelerated to the fastest in 16 years.
Sterling gained 0.8 percent to 83.97 pence per euro. The U.K.
currency advanced 0.5 percent to $1.6046.  Yen Support  Bank of Japan  Governor Haruhiko Kuroda told reporters in
 Osaka  today that inflation expectations are gradually rising and
that it’s too early to debate an exit strategy.  “The optimistic outlook may signal to markets that no
additional easing is likely at this time, and that is supportive
of the yen,” said Eric Viloria, a senior currency strategist at
Gain Capital Group LLC in New York.  The euro slid 1.4 percent in the past week, the worst
performer after Sweden’s krona of 10 developed-nation currencies
tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes as a report on
Oct. 31 showed the region’s annual inflation rate unexpectedly
fell last month. The dollar added 0.7 percent and the yen rose
0.7 percent.  “The pressure is piling on the hawks to cut,”  Sebastien Galy , a senior foreign-exchange strategist at Societe Generale
SA in New York, said of the ECB, which will announce its
decision Nov. 7.  ECB Forecasts  Bank of America Corp., Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc and
UBS AG have predicted in the past week that the ECB will cut its
benchmark main refinancing rate, now 0.5 percent, on Nov. 7. The
other 67 of 70 economists  surveyed  by Bloomberg forecast policy
makers will leave borrowing costs unchanged.  ECB President  Mario Draghi , speaking today in  Frankfurt ,
said that while the “overall economic situation has slightly
improved since the middle of last year,  interest rates  on loans
continue to vary widely.” He said a euro area banking union
would “improve the situation.”  The European Union cut its forecast for the region’s growth
next year to 1.1 percent, less than the 1.2 percent estimated in
May.  Unemployment (UMRTEMU) , now at the highest rate since the euro was
introduced, will be at 12.2 percent in 2014, versus the 12.1
percent predicted six months ago, the commission said.  The ISM’s non-manufacturing index increased to 55.4 from
the prior month’s 54.4, the Tempe, Arizona-based group said
today. A gauge above 50 shows expansion. The median estimate in
a Bloomberg survey of economists was 54.  ‘Underlying Strength’  “The data has increased some optimism that there may not
be a downside surprise on payrolls on Friday, which is why we’re
seeing a stronger dollar today,” Brian Daingerfield, a
 Stamford , Connecticut-based currency strategist at Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc’s RBS Securities unit, said in a telephone
interview.  Payroll gains will shrink to 120,000 in October, according
to the median forecast of 88 economists in a Bloomberg survey
before the Nov. 8 release, from a 148,000 gain the previous
month. The jobless rate is predicted to rise to 7.3 percent,
according to another survey.  Fed policy makers said Oct. 30 that the economy showed
signs of “underlying strength” even as they maintained their
$85 billion of monthly  asset purchases  to support the growth and
cap borrowing costs. A Bloomberg survey of analysts taken on
Oct. 17-18 forecast a March tapering of the purchases. The
 Federal Open Market Committee  next meets Dec. 17-18.  Trading in over-the-counter foreign-exchange options
totaled $42 billion, from $34 billion yesterday, according to
data reported by U.S. banks to the Depository Trust Clearing
Corp. and tracked by Bloomberg. Volume in options on the euro-dollar  exchange rate  amounted to $9.7 billion, the largest share
of trades at 23 percent. Options on the dollar-yen rate totaled
$7.6 billion, or 18 percent.  Euro-dollar options trading was 57 percent more than the
average for the past five Tuesdays at a similar time in the day,
according to Bloomberg analysis. Dollar-yen options trading was
7 percent less than average.  To contact the reporters on this story:
