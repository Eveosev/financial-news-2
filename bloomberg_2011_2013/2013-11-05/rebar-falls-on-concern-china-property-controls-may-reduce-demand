Steel reinforcement-bar futures in
 China  fell for the first time in three days on concern that the
government may step up property curbs, reducing demand for the
building material.  Rebar for May delivery, the most-active contract by volume
on the Shanghai Futures Exchange, declined as much as 0.6
percent to 3,654 yuan ($599) a metric ton before trading at
3,667 yuan at 11:19 a.m. local time.  Beijing won’t approve requests to raise prices for housing
developments before the end of the year, the 21st Century
Business Herald reported today, citing an unidentified person
from Beijing Municipal Commission of Housing and Urban-Rural
Development.  “Many investors are worried that the authorities will
impose further property controls as housing prices have kept
rising,” said Wang Yongliang, an analyst at Beijing Cifco
Futures Co. in Tianjin.  Iron ore  for May delivery on the Dalian Commodity Exchange
fell 0.6 percent to 944  yuan  a ton. The steel-making material
for immediate delivery at Tianjin port, tracked by The Steel
Index, rose for a third day yesterday, adding 0.4 percent to
$135.8 a dry ton.  The spot price of rebar gained 0.3 percent to 3,519 yuan a
ton yesterday, according to Beijing Antaike Information
Development Co.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
