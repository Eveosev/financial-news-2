Google Inc. (GOOG)  is starting a live video
service for users seeking expert advice on everything from
zesting a lemon to patching up a hole in the wall.  Using Helpouts, Web surfers can search for experts in eight
categories, including cooking and home and garden, and then pay
for a live interactive video session, said Udi Manber, vice
president of engineering at the  Mountain View , California-based
company. Some sessions will be free.  Google, which dominates Internet search, is exploring ways
to keep users engaged and on its services for longer through the
YouTube video site, Google+ social network and mobile
applications on Android. To entice users, Google is offering a
money-back guarantee for Helpouts from its more than 1,000
individuals and businesses providing lessons, including  Weight
Watchers International Inc. (WTW)  and  Rosetta Stone Inc. (RST)   Other companies are trying to crack the digital-training
market. Skillshare Inc., Curious.com Inc. and Pearl.com LLC are
among startups giving users access to experts in subjects such
as photography, basic car repair and computer programming.  For Helpouts sessions that cost money, Google will take 20
percent of the sale. Google isn’t taking a commission for
lessons related to health care. The company said it expects to
expand the number of categories over time.  “With this we can open the whole world for everybody,”
Manber said yesterday at a press conference. “Anytime you get
stuck, with a press of a button, you connect to somebody who can
answer that” question, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
