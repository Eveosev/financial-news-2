Michelin today awarded a third star
to Reale in Castel di Sangro and added three dual-star
restaurants to its guide to  Italy .  Reale’s chef  Niko Romito’s  “minimalist presentations exude
flavors that are pure and intense,” Michelin said in an e-mailed release. “In all, eight restaurants have now earned the
three-star distinction.”  The new two-star venues were Villa Feltrinelli in  Gargnano ,
Devero in Cavenago, and Locanda Don Serafino in  Ragusa . A total
of 29 restaurants earned their first star.  Three stars mean exceptional cuisine, worth a special
journey; two stars are for excellent cooking, worth a detour;
one star denotes a very good restaurant in its category.  Michelin & Cie. (ML)  is the world’s  second-biggest tiremaker 
after Bridgestone Corp. It produced its first guide in August
1900, distributed free of charge (until 1920) and originally
intended for chauffeurs.  The guide contained practical information, including street
maps and tips on using and repairing tires.  Muse highlights include  Martin Gayford  on European art,
 Greg Evans  on U.S. television,  Amanda Gordon’s  Scene Last Night
and  Philip Boroff  on U.S. theater.  To contact the writer on the story:
