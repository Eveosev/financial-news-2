The Canadian dollar traded at almost
the weakest level in two months amid a slide in crude oil, the
nation’s biggest export, and as the discount that western
Canadian oil faces headed toward the widest on record.  The currency fell for a second day as traders awaited
economic reports this week after data on Oct. 31 showed gross
domestic product grew in August more than forecast, while the
Bank of  Canada  a week earlier cut its economic forecasts. The
discount applied to the heavy crude of  Canadian producers  versus
lighter U.S. benchmarks increased to the most since December.  “That’s a large enough move in my mind that it would start
to have some implications,”  Alan Ruskin , Deutsche Bank’s global
head of Group-of-10 foreign exchange, said by phone from New
York of the oil figures. “When you have large enough movements,
it starts to get flagged as a potential, dare I say, souring
effect on Canadian-dollar sentiment.”  The loonie, as Canada’s currency is nicknamed for the image
of the aquatic bird on the C$1 coin, depreciated 0.3 percent to
C$1.0456 per U.S. dollar at 5 p.m. in Toronto and reached
C$1.0462. It touched C$1.0497 on Oct. 30, an eight-week low. One
Canadian dollar purchases 95.64 U.S. cents.  Canada’s currency rose 1 percent over the past week against
nine developed-market currencies tracked by the Bloomberg
Correlation Weighted Index. The U.S. dollar gained 0.7 percent.  Benchmark Bond  The nation’s benchmark 10-year government  bond  fell,
pushing yields to a two-week high. Yields increased as much as
six basis points, or 0.06 percentage point, to 2.55 percent, the
highest since Oct. 21, before trading at 2.53 percent, up four
basis points. The price of the 1.5 percent security maturing in
June 2023 lost 32 cents to C$91.29.  The Bank of Canada will auction C$3.4 billion ($3.3
billion) tomorrow of notes maturing in March 2019.  The loonie weakened as traders awaited data this week on
employment and construction. Statistics Canada will report
tomorrow that building permits rose 6 percent in September,
after a 21 percent drop the prior month, economists in a
Bloomberg survey forecast. The statistics agency will issue data
on Nov. 8 showing  employment  increased by 11,000 jobs in
October, versus a gain of 11,900 in September and a jump of
59,200 in August, another Bloomberg survey estimated.  Canadian GDP grew 0.3 percent in August, Statistics Canada
reported Oct. 31, compared with a forecast of 0.1 percent in a
Bloomberg survey. The Bank of Canada said Oct. 23 slack in the
economy will persist until about the end of 2015.  ‘GDP Surprise’  “Last week’s monthly GDP surprise caught everyone by
surprise, and I think it’s made this market second-guess the
valuation of the loonie and that perhaps it might have been sold
too aggressively,” said Brad Schruder, director of foreign
exchange at Bank of Montreal, by phone from Toronto. “If that
data comes in positive, the hypothesis based on what the Bank of
Canada told us comes into question.”  The Canadian dollar remained weaker as a  gauge  of service
industries in the U.S., the nation’s biggest trade partner, rose
in October more than forecast. The gain added to the case for
the Federal Reserve to slow stimulus.  The Institute for Supply Management’s U.S. non-manufacturing index increased to 55.4 from the prior month’s
54.4, the Tempe, Arizona-based group said. A reading above 50
shows expansion. A Bloomberg survey of economists forecast 54.  Government reports in the U.S. this week will show third-quarter GDP growth slowed to 2 percent, from 2.5 percent from
April through June, and employers added 120,000 jobs in October,
from 148,000 the previous month, Bloomberg surveys forecast.  Crude oil for December delivery sank 1 percent to $93.64 a
barrel in New York and touched $93.07, the lowest intraday level
since June 24.  Record Discount  The  discount  on western Canadian oil swelled to $42 per
barrel, the most since it reached a record $42.50 Dec. 14. The
2013 average is $23.48.  “If oil is having a poorer session, that isn’t going to
help, but the direct short-term inferences on commodity prices
are somewhat less than we’ve seen historically,”  Jeremy Stretch , head of currency strategy at Canadian Imperial Bank of
Commerce, said by telephone from  London . “In the short term, I
still think we’re very much beholden to what’s going to happen
in the U.S.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
