AT&S Austria Technologie &
Systemtechnik AG (ATS) , the Austrian circuit-board maker, rose the
most in seven weeks after profit jumped on demand for products
it makes for smartphones.  Shares rose as much as 8.5 percent in Vienna, the most
since Sept. 18, and traded at 7.52 euros at 11:38 a.m. local
time. The stock has gained 16 percent over the last year, giving
the Leoben, Austria-based company a market value of 292 million
euros ($391.8 million).  “Because of the rising complexity of smartphones, more and
more clients are asking for high-end circuit boards,” Daniel Lion, a Vienna-based analyst at Erste Group Bank AG, said via
telephone. “This has a positive effect on the product mix of
AT&S and boosts its profitability.”  AT&S, whose clients include most of the world’s biggest
smartphone makers, said late yesterday that first-half net
income jumped more than 10-fold to 22 million euros after sales
climbed 18 percent to 300 million euros. The company reiterated
it expects full-year fiscal 2014 sales to grow five percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
