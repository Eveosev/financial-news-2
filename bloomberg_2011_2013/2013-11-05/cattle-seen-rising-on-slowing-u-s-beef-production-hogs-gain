Cattle futures, trading little
changed in Chicago, may rise for a second consecutive day on
signs of declining U.S. beef production amid rising meat demand.
Hog prices advanced.  Beef processors slaughtered 115,000 animals yesterday, 5.7
percent lower than a week earlier, U.S. Department of
Agriculture data show. Yesterday,  wholesale beef  rose to $2.0556
a pound, the highest since Oct. 30, according to government
data. The price has climbed 5.9 percent this year. Consumers
have more money to spend on meat purchases because of lower fuel
costs, according to Stewart-Peterson Group in  Yates City ,
 Illinois .  “Slaughter is down and it might be the first warning shot
that packers can’t buy every animal that is offered,” Lawrence Kane, a market adviser for Stewart-Peterson Group said in a
telephone interview. “Best thing that has happened to the meat
business is the price of gas has dropped.”  Cattle futures for December delivery climbed 0.1 percent to
$1.32275 a pound at 10:35 a.m. on the Chicago Mercantile
exchange. The most-active contract gained for five straight
months through October.  On Nov. 4, the national average  price  of regular gasoline
at the pump fell to $3.24 a gallon, the lowest since December,
AAA data show.  Hog futures for December settlement rallied 0.3 percent to
88.55 cents a pound on the CME. Prices fell in the previous five
sessions, the longest slump since Feb. 22.  Feeder-cattle futures for January settlement climbed 0.8
percent to $1.651 a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
