Itochu Corp. (8001)  vowed record annual net
income after a weaker yen and a resurgence in  iron ore  sales
lifted  Japan ’s third-largest trading house to its best-ever six-month result. The company’s shares jumped 3.2 percent.  “We’ve got a bit of slack going forward, and the aim is to
expand that into record profit,” Chief Financial Officer
Tadayuki Seki told reporters in  Tokyo  today after the trader
released first-half results.  Itochu’s greater focus on assets outside natural resources
has narrowed the profit gap with  Mitsubishi Corp. (8058)  and  Mitsui &
Co. (8031)  at a time when lower Chinese demand is depressing commodity
prices. Itochu posted record profit of 300.5 billion yen ($3.05
billion) in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2012.  For the six months ended Sept. 30, profit rose 16 percent
to 165.1 billion yen from 142.2 billion yen a year ago, Tokyo-and Osaka-based Itochu said in today’s  statement . The purchase
of two units from  Dole Food Co. (DOLE)  this year added 4 billion yen to
profit, with higher leasing and iron ore sales also boosting
earnings, the company said.  Non-resource net income accounted for 77 percent of profit
in the first six months, compared with 67 percent in the same
period a year ago, Itochu said. The Japanese currency’s drop
against the  U.S. dollar  added as much as 6.4 billion yen to net
income in the period.  Shares Gain  Itochu gained 37 yen to 1,195 yen at the close in Tokyo,
extending its advance to 32 percent since Jan. 1. Mitsubishi has
risen 20 percent, while Mitsui is up 5.9 percent.  The yen’s 12 percent decline against the dollar this year -
- the biggest drop since 2005 -- will help boost Japan’s
domestic economy, according to Itochu.  “We anticipate ongoing recoveries in both exports and
internal demand, supported by extensive monetary easing, yen
depreciation compared with the previous fiscal year” and
greater spending on public works, Itochu said.  Shoppers in Japan seeking to beat an increase in the
nation’s consumption tax in April will also boost retail, said
Itochu, convenience store operator  FamilyMart Co. (8028) ’s biggest
shareholder.  At Mitsui, Japan’s most resource-focused trading house,
higher sales of iron ore and improving returns on liquefied
natural gas projects helped counter softening prices in the
first six months, the company said.  Profit rose 17 percent to 197.2 billion yen from 168.3
billion yen a year ago, Mitsui said. The company’s annual profit
target of 370 billion yen was unchanged.  Copper Production  Mitsui will book a 14.1 billion yen loss this year on the
rising cost of copper production in  Chile , CFO Joji Okada told
reporters in Tokyo.  The company’s shares fell 2.3 percent to 1,358 yen in
Tokyo, the most in five weeks.  Mitsubishi last week reported its best quarter since the
three months ended June 30, 2011, as a weaker yen helped Asian
auto sales and a domestic stock rally boosted equity holdings.  Net income jumped 47 percent to 132.7 billion yen in the
quarter ended Sept. 30 from 90 billion yen a year earlier,
Tokyo-based Mitsubishi said in a statement. First-half profit
was 248.4 billion yen, beating the 234.6 billion yen  mean
forecast  from three analysts compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporters on this story:
