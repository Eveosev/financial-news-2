Gold slumped to the lowest price in
more than two weeks as U.S. service industries grew faster than
forecast, increasing speculation that the Federal Reserve may
start tapering stimulus measures later this year.  The Institute for Supply Management’s  non-manufacturing 
index rose to 55.4 in October, a report from the Tempe, Arizona-based group showed today. The median estimate in a Bloomberg
survey of economists was 54. Readings above 50 signal expansion.
The Bloomberg Dollar Index jumped as much as 0.3 percent against
a basket of currencies after the data was released. The economy
shows signs of “underlying strength,” Fed policy makers said
on Oct. 30.  “The better-than-expected ISM number increases speculation
whether tapering will begin in December or not,” Phil Streible,
a senior commodity broker at R.J. O’Brien & Associates in
 Chicago , said in a telephone interview. “The strength in the
greenback continues to work against gold.”  Gold futures for December delivery slid 0.5 percent to
settle at $1,308.10 an ounce at 1:43 p.m. on the Comex in New
York, after touching $1,305.20, the lowest for a most-active
contract since Oct. 17. Trading was 32 percent below the average
in the past 100 days for this time of day, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  Silver futures for December delivery slipped 0.3 percent to
$21.636 an ounce in New York, after touching $21.56, the lowest
since Oct. 17.  On the New York Mercantile Exchange, platinum futures for
January delivery fell 0.4 percent to $1,450 an ounce.  A strike that began Nov. 3 at  Northam Platinum Ltd. (NHM)  in
South Africa over wages continued, and the National Union of
Mineworkers will hold a meeting with workers on Nov. 7, the
union said in a statement.  Anglo American Platinum Ltd. (AMS) , the
biggest producer, will start talks with the Association of
Mineworkers and Construction Union on Nov. 13, a company
spokesman said.  Palladium futures for December delivery added 0.1 percent
to $750.30 an ounce on the Nymex.  To contact the reporter on this story:
