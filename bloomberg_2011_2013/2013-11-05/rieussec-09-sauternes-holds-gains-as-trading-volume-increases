The 2009 vintage of Chateau Rieussec,
a Sauternes wine estate under the same ownership as Chateau
Lafite Rothschild, is holding onto price gains amid increased
trading volume even as its 2010s have fallen, Liv-ex data shows.  Three cases of 2009s sold for 275 pounds ($438) on Liv-ex
on Oct. 29 and 10 more fetched 270 pounds each in the following
two days, all within the range set in July 2010 as they started
trading, according to data on Liv-ex’s Cellar Watch website. The
2010s are below their May 2011 level when they came to market.  The Liv-ex Fine Wine 50 Index, a benchmark for top Bordeaux
red wines, fell 1.5 percent in October, its sixth month of
declines in the past seven and extending a slide which has taken
it down more than 5 percent since the end of March. Investors
have been looking for wines from other regions to diversify.  “Bordeaux is still selling, but it has to be at the right
price,” said Joss Fowler, Director of Fine Wine at  London  wine
broker  Fine+Rare . “These wines are going to start selling again
once people think they have intrinsic value rather than
speculative value.”  Sauternes from even top-classified estates typically
commands lower prices than comparable Bordeaux reds, and has
traditionally been drunk with foie gras or as a dessert wine,
often limited to special occasions. “It’s not drunk in the same
way that red wine is,” Fowler said.  Rieussec Trading  More than 20 trades of Rieussec 2009 have taken place on
the exchange since the start of July at prices ranging between
250 pounds and 315 pounds a case. The 270-pound level at the end
of October was 29 percent above the low for the vintage touched
in November 2011 while 33 percent below the peak reached in
September 2010 as Bordeaux prices were lifted by Asian demand.  Rieussec 2010 traded at 200 pounds a case in both September
and August this year, matching its July 2012 level. That’s down
44 percent from its peak of 360 pounds a case reached in May
2011 soon after being released to the market.  Chateau Rieussec is part of a series of wine estates
controlled by Domaines Barons de Rothschild (Lafite), which
include Lafite and neighboring Chateau Duhart-Milon in Pauillac
as well as Chateau L’Evangile in Pomerol and vineyards in
southern  France ,  Chile  and  Argentina .  Rieussec’s 2009 vintage is its second-most expensive of the
10 most recent traded years, lagging behind only the 2004, while
the 2010 is one of the two cheapest in the same period,
according to merchant data tracked by Liv-ex.  Noble Rot  The 2009 Rieussec was awarded 97 points out of 100 by Neal
Martin in a February 2013 online tasting note posted on U.S.
wine critic  Robert Parker ’s  eRobertParker  website, making it the
highest-ranked Rieussec since the 2001 vintage on that measure.  Sweet wines from Sauternes and neighboring Barsac derive
their flavor from grapes picked after the Botrytis cinerea
fungus, referred to as noble rot, sets in and boosts their sugar
concentration.  Rieussec is a close neighbor of Chateau d’Yquem, Bordeaux’s
top-ranked Sauternes estate, which recently released its 2011
vintage after saying in December it wouldn’t produce any dessert
wine from its 2012 harvest. That was because grapes failed to
achieve the necessary level of rot last year following an
abundance of rain. Over the past half-century Yquem also skipped
production in 1992, 1974, 1972 and 1964.  2011 Vintage  The 2009 vintage of Yquem, being offered at 4,500 pounds a
case, is the estate’s most expensive of the past 10 years,
although lagging behind the 2001, according to merchant prices
collated by Liv-ex. It traded on the exchange in July at 4,350
pounds a case, up from 4,000 pounds at the end of last year.  Yquem’s 2011 wine, the fourth-most expensive of the past
six years, is currently priced by merchants above its 2008 and
2006 vintages, according to Liv-ex. “We sold a respectable
amount of 2011 Yquem when it was released,” Fowler said.  Chateau d’Yquem is owned by Paris-based  LVMH Moet Hennessy
Louis Vuitton SA (MC) , the world’s largest luxury goods maker, which
is led by billionaire  Bernard Arnault . The wine estate is
managed by Pierre Lurton, who also has responsibility for
Chateau Cheval Blanc in Saint-Emilion.  Among dessert-wine producers seeing demand for the recent
2011 vintage is Chateau Doisy Daene, an estate owned by  Denis
Dubourdieu , professor of oenology at Bordeaux University, and
run with his wife Florence and sons Fabrice and Jean-Jacques.  U.S. Market  “2011 is a special vintage because it was very well
regarded in the U.S. press,” Fabrice Dubourdieu, who is
technical director of the family’s vineyards, said in an
interview in London. “There was a very high demand on that
vintage in the American market.”  Doisy Daene’s 2011 wine is priced at 270 pounds a case,
according to merchant data compiled by Liv-ex. That puts it
close to the level of the 2010 vintage and above prices for the
estate’s five vintages between 2004 and 2008.  Since 1990, the estate has also produced a concentrated
wine in limited quantities and in selected vintages, called
Doisy Daene L’Extravagant.  The 2011 L’Extravagant is being offered by merchants at
3,213 pounds a case, compared with 3,358 pounds for the 2010,
according to Liv-ex data. A case of 2001 L’Extravagant sold for
$2,952 at an Acker Merrall & Condit auction in  Hong Kong  in May,
according to archived prices on Acker’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
