New Zealand ’s currency traded near
its highest level in more than a week after a report showed
employers increased hiring more than economists forecast, adding
pressure on the central bank to lift record-low interest rates.  The kiwi has climbed 2.1 percent in the past week, the
biggest gain among 10 developed nation currencies tracked by
Bloomberg Correlation Weighted Indexes. Australia’s dollar held
decline from yesterday versus New Zealand’s kiwi before a jobs
report in the larger economy tomorrow projected to show the
 unemployment rate  climbed last month.  “The labor-market statistics were very positive and
another indicator suggesting that the  Reserve Bank  of New
Zealand will need to raise interest rates probably in the first
half of next year,” said  Mike Jones , a currency strategist at
Bank of New Zealand Ltd. in Wellington. “With rate hike
expectations rising up again, the kiwi has been dragged
higher.”  The  New Zealand dollar  was little changed at 83.60 U.S.
cents as of 9:46 a.m. in Sydney after earlier touching 83.77,
the highest level since Oct. 24. It traded at 82.42 yen from
82.38 yesterday and was steady at NZ$1.1368 per Aussie after
rising 1 percent yesterday. Australia’s currency was also little
changed at 95.05 U.S. cents and 93.68 yen.  Employment in New Zealand increased 1.2 percent, or by
27,000 jobs, in the third quarter, the most since early 2007,
the statistics bureau said today. The median forecast in a
Bloomberg News survey was for a 0.5 percent gain. The jobless
rate fell to 6.2 percent from 6.4 percent.  The RBNZ will add 81 basis points to its 2.5 percent
benchmark rate over 12 months, according to a Credit Suisse
Group AG  index  based on swaps.  To contact the reporters on this story:
