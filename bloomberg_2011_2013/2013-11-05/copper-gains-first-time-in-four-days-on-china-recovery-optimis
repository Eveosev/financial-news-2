Copper rose, rebounding from the
lowest close in almost a month, as recent economic data added to
signs of a recovery in the world’s biggest user of the metal.  The contract for delivery in three months advanced as much
as 0.6 percent to $7,191.50 a metric ton and traded at $7,183.25
at 11:33 a.m. in  Shanghai . Futures closed at $7,149 yesterday,
the lowest level since Oct. 10. Today’s gain pared this year’s
losses to 9.4 percent.  China ’s Vice Premier Zhang Gaoli said economic conditions
are stable and that the country can meet its main economic
targets this year, according to a State Council statement
yesterday. A manufacturing index from HSBC Holdings Plc and
Markit Economics rose to the highest since March last month and
their services gauge expanded more than estimated, reports
showed this month.  “Recent economic indicators and expectations for some
reform from the upcoming Chinese Communist Party meeting
improved market sentiment,” said Xiong Dabiao, an analyst at
Minmetals Futures Co. in Shanghai.  China’s top party officials will meet in Beijing from Nov.
9-12 to map out a blueprint for reform as the country, the
world’s second-biggest economy, heads for its slowest growth in
more than two decades.  Futures for delivery in December rose 0.4 percent to
$3.2665 a pound on the Comex in New York. The metal for delivery

51,580  yuan  ($8,459) a ton.  On the LME, aluminum, tin, zinc, lead advanced, while
