Pirelli SpA (PC) , Europe’s third-largest
tiremaker, cut its profit target for 2013 the second time this
year because of slower demand in  Russia  and exchange-rate
volatility.  Earnings before interest and taxes are expected to be about
790 million euros ($1.06 billion), the Milan-based company said
today in a statement. That compares with a previous forecast of
810 million euros outlined in August, when Pirelli scaled back
from a predicted earnings range of 810 million euros to 850
million euros. Third-quarter operating profit rose to 201
million euros from 195 million euros a year earlier.  Pirelli is pushing sales of its high-end products to make
up for a contraction in Europe’s mass-market car sales to a two-decade low. The tiremaker plans to expand into markets outside
Europe, in addition to focusing marketing in the region on its
premium brands, Chairman Marco Tronchetti Provera said in an
interview in March.  Pirelli also cut its forecast for revenue this year to 6.2
billion euros from a range of 6.3 billion euros to 6.35 billion
euros. Third-quarter revenue fell to 1.52 billion euros from
1.55 billion euros mainly because of the “negative impact of
exchange rates on Latin American,  Turkey ,  Egypt  and Japan
currencies,” it said in the statement.  Michelin & Cie. (ML) , Europe’s largest tiremaker, forecast in
October that full-year operating profit will rise by 150 million
euros before one-time items and currency effects, which will be
“more deeply negative” than anticipated earlier in 2013.
 Nokian Renkaat Oyj (NRE1V) , the biggest tire producer in the Nordic
region, cut sales and profit forecasts because of slowing
Russian sales and the ruble’s decline against the euro.  Pirelli’s eight main shareholders dissolved an agreement on
Oct. 31 that protected the Italian company from takeovers, six
months before the pact’s expiration in April 2014. The move
frees the investors to sell Pirelli stock. The tiremaker is
 scheduled  tomorrow to publish a plan for business through 2017.  To contact the reporter on this story:
