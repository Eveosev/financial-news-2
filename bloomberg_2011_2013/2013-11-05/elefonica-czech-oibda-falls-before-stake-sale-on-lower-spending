Telefonica Czech Republic AS, the
country’s largest phone company and takeover target of the
richest Czech, said third-quarter operating income before
depreciation and amortization fell on overhaul costs and
regulatory and competitive pressures on revenue.  Oibda for the three months ended Sept. 30 dropped 7 percent
to 4.89 billion koruna ($255 million) from 5.28 billion koruna a
year earlier, the Prague-based company said in a statement on
its website today. Revenue declined 7 percent to 11.7 billion
koruna, eroded by mobile termination rates and price pressures.  Billionaire Petr Kellner’s PPF Group NV agreed to buy a
65.9 stake in Telefonica Czech for 2.5 billion euros ($3.4
billion), PPF said in a statement today. The acquisition returns
the phone company to local ownership after eight years.  Telefonica fell 8.6 koruna, or 2.8 percent, to 303.4 koruna
in Prague.  Telefonica Czech reiterated 2013 guidance of limited Oibda
margin erosion of 41.4 percent in 2012 and 2013 capital
expenditure of less than 6 billion koruna.  Telefonica Czech reduced fees and introduced bundles for
unlimited calls and some data in April after the regulator
proposed new terms for a radio spectrum auction. The authority
expects to start the bidding for the spectrum on Nov. 11.  Telefonica confirmed today that it will take part in the
auction, Chief Executive Officer Luis Malvido said in a
conference call with analysts today.  Telefonica booked 354 million in costs linked to business
overhaul in the first nine months of 2013, it said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
