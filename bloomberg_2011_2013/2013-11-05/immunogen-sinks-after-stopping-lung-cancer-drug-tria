ImmunoGen Inc. (IMGN) , a maker of oncology
drugs, sank the most in more than three years after the company
stopped the study of a medicine for lung cancer because it
didn’t appear to work better than approved therapies.  ImmunoGen dropped 19 percent to $13.41 at the close in  New
York , the biggest decline since August 2010. The shares of the
Waltham, Massachusetts-based company have gained 5.2 percent
this year.  The trial, in the second phase of three generally required
for marketing approval, was testing IMGN901 combined with two
therapies, etoposide and carboplatin, against those drugs alone
in patients with small-cell lung cancer. An independent
monitoring committee determined IMGN901 was unlikely to show
enough of a benefit to justify continuing the trial, ImmunoGen
said today in a statement.  “Discontinuation of IMGN901 in small-cell  lung cancer 
trials eviscerates their pipeline in the near term,” Joel Sendek, an analyst with  Stifel Nicolaus (SF)  & Co., wrote in a
research note today. He reduced his recommendation on the stock
to sell. “We no longer expect the company to move forward with
IMGN901 in any other indications due to its lack of efficacy in
this trial, pinning the hopes of the ImmunoGen pipeline on the
earlier-stage compounds.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
