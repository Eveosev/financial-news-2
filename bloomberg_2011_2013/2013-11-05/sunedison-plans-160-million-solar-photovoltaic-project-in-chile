SunEdison Inc. (SUNE) , the polysilicon
supplier formerly known as MEMC Electronic Materials Inc., is
filing for permits to develop a $160 million photovoltaic power
plant in Chile’s Atacama desert.  Work on the 80-megawatt Javiera solar project is expected
to start in August, Belmont, California-based SunEdison said
today in a  filing  with environmental licensing agency Servicio
de Evaluacion Ambiental. The plant will feed energy into Chile’s
central grid system.  To contact the reporter on this story:
