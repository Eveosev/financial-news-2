Germany ’s government bonds were
little changed before a report economists said will show euro-area producer prices fell in September from a year earlier.  Benchmark  10-year (GDBR10)  yields were about three basis points from
the lowest since August before the European Central Bank meets
this week to set monetary policy. Euro-region government bonds
rallied last week as slowing inflation boosted bets the central
bank will cut interest rates. Austria plans to sell 1.65 billion
euros ($2.23 billion) of debt maturing in 2018 and 2022 today,
while Germany is scheduled to auction 4 billion euros of five-year notes tomorrow.  German 10-year bunds yielded 1.68 percent at 7:11 a.m.
London time. The rate fell to 1.65 percent on Oct. 31, the
lowest since Aug. 8. The price of the 2 percent bund maturing in
August 2023 was at 102.85.  Factory-gate  prices  in the 17-nation bloc slipped 0.8
percent in September from a year earlier, after dropping 0.8
percent in August, according to the median of 19 analyst
forecasts in a Bloomberg News survey.  German bonds lost 0.9 percent this year through yesterday,
according to Bloomberg World Bond Indexes. Spain’s returned 11
percent and  Italy ’s gained 6.8 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
