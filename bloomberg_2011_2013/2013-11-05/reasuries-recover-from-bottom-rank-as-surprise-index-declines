Treasury 10-year notes fell for the
fourth time in five days as the U.S. services sector grew faster
than forecast last month, underpinning speculation the  Federal
Reserve  may move up the timing of asset-purchase cuts.  The benchmark yield reached the highest level in more than
two weeks as the nonmanufacturing report and data last week
showed a gauge of U.S. factories expanded more than projected,
even after the 16-day partial government shutdown last month.
Investors in Treasuries were  betting  on declines for the second
straight week, according to a survey by JPMorgan Chase & Co. The
U.S. will announce tomorrow the amounts it will sell in notes
and bonds next week.  “Today’s data was generally stronger than anticipated and
is suggesting that the economy may have withstood the shutdown
better than anticipated,” said  Christopher Sullivan , who
oversees $2.2 billion as chief investment officer at United
Nations Federal Credit Union in New York.’’ Investors are taking
pause and are waiting for the picture to become clearer.’’  Benchmark 10-year  yields  rose seven basis points, or 0.07
percentage point, to 2.67 percent as of 5 p.m. New York time,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader data. The 2.5 percent note
due in August 2023 fell 18/32, or $5.63 per $1,000 face amount,
to 98 17/32.  The 10-year yield has risen 17 basis points in the past
five days and reached the highest level since Oct. 16. Thirty-year yields added eight basis points to 3.77 percent.  Market Measures  Treasuries  have lost  0.6 percent this month, according to
the  Bloomberg US Treasury Bond Index (BUSY) , extending the decline this
year to 2.1 percent.  “You are not seeing the outside-money investor coming
in,” said  Michael Franzese , senior vice president of fixed-income trading at ED&F Man Capital Markets in New York. People
“are waiting for signals from the Fed and we’re not getting
them. There’s no definitive line. They may change the goalpost
because they don’t want to affect the economic progress even
though it’s anemic.”  The seven-day  relative strength  index for the Treasury 10-year note yield was at 76.3, according to Bloomberg data. A
reading lower than 30 or above 70 suggests the security may be
poised for a change in direction.  Treasury  trading volume  at ICAP Plc, the largest inter-dealer broker of U.S. government debt, was $164.7 billion
yesterday. The only time it was lower this year was Aug. 9, when
it fell to $147.8 billion. The high was $662.3 billion on May
22.  Investor Sentiment  The JPMorgan Chase survey showed the proportion of net
shorts remained at four percentage points in the week ending
yesterday, according to JPMorgan. The percent of outright
shorts, or bets the securities will fall in value, was unchanged
at 23 percent as of yesterday, the survey said. The percent of
outright longs held at 19 percent, the survey reported.  Investors held neutral bets at 58 percent, equaling the
lowest level since June 3, the survey reported.  Fed Governor Jerome Powell said yesterday the central bank
will probably sustain its stimulative policy for some time, and
it is uncertain when any tapering of $85 billion in monthly bond
purchases will begin. Boston Fed President  Eric Rosengren  said
more needs to be done until the labor market gains strength.  The central bank’s next meetings are Dec. 17-18, Jan. 28-29
and March 18-19.  Debt Sales  The U.S. will announce tomorrow the amount it will sell in
three-, 10-and 30-year debt on three consecutive days starting
Nov. 12. The U.S. Treasury Department said yesterday it will
borrow about 13 percent more this quarter than it projected
three months ago to boost the nation’s cash balance on Dec. 31.  Issuance of net marketable debt will be $266 billion in the
October-to-December period, compared with $235 billion initially
forecast on July 29, the department said in  Washington . At the
end of December, the Treasury will have $140 billion in cash,
versus $80 billion projected before.  The Treasury is planning to sell the first floating-rate
notes at the end of January to expand its investor base and
limit borrowing costs, according to a July 31 statement. The
sales would be the first added  U.S. government debt  security
since Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities were introduced in
1997.  The  Institute for Supply Management ’s U.S. nonmanufacturing
index increased to 55.4 in October, exceeding forecasts for 54
reading and up from 54.4 the prior month, a report from the
Tempe, Arizona-based group showed today. A report Nov. 1 showed
Institute for Supply Management’s factory index rose to 56.4 in
October, the highest since April 2011, from 56.2 a month
earlier.  Economic Analysis  “It suggests there’s a rebound in service-sector
employment,” said Thomas Simons, a government-debt economist in
New York at Jefferies LLC, one of 21 primary dealers that trade
with the Fed. “Both the manufacturing and service sectors are
resilient. The back-end is definitely underperforming,” he
said, referring to longer-maturity debt.  The U.S. added 120,000 jobs in October, versus 148,000 in
September and 193,000 in August, based on responses from
economists in a Bloomberg News survey before the Labor
Department reports the figure Nov. 8.  The 10-year yield is forecast to end the year at 2.80
percent, according to the median of a Bloomberg survey of
analysts.  To contact the reporters on this story:
