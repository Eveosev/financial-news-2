Odyssey Marine Exploration Inc. (OMEX) , the
deep-ocean salvage company targeted in a short-seller’s report,
said it expects to have $30 million in cash at year-end and
won’t need to raise equity in 2014.  The year-end cash forecast includes the anticipated early
payoff of a $10 million loan not due until June, Chief Financial
Officer Philip S. Devine said on a conference call with
investors today. The call was held to rebut an Oct. 31  report  by
Meson Capital Partners LLC that said Odyssey would run out of
cash next year, among other allegations.  Tampa, Florida-based Odyssey will lose less than $3 million
in the third quarter and will have a “significant” net profit
in the fourth quarter, when most of the year’s project revenue
will be recorded, Devine said on the call.  “Things have never looked better at Odyssey,” Chief
Executive Officer Gregory P. Stemm said on the call.  Stemm said Meson omitted key financial details and facts,
including that Stemm and another executive were acquitted 20
years ago in a jury trial of charges by the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission.  To contact the reporter on this story:
