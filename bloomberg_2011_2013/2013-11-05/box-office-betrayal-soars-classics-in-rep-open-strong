Broadway looked like London’s West
End last week, as classics in repertory played to nearly full
houses.  “Richard III” and “Twelfth Night,” with all-male casts
led by two-time Tony Award winner  Mark Rylance , grossed $590,000
in previews ahead of its Nov. 10 opening, according to the trade
association the Broadway League. Attendance at the Belasco
Theatre was at 95 percent of capacity.  Harold Pinter’s “No Man’s Land,” rotating with Samuel
Beckett’s “Waiting for Godot” at the Cort sold $557,000.
 Patrick Stewart  and Ian McKellen headline a cast that includes
Billy Crudup and Shuler Hensley.  “Macbeth,” with Ethan Hawke, did a respectable $389,000
in its first full week at Lincoln Center’s Vivian Beaumont
Theatre. It opens Nov. 21.  Total Broadway sales fell 3 percent from the previous week,
to $22.5 million.  Mike Nichols ’s revival of “Betrayal,” starring  Daniel Craig  and  Rachel Weisz , grossed $1.3 million at the Barrymore
Theatre. The limited run had a $151.70 average ticket, one of
the priciest ever for a Broadway play.  “First Date” had its worst week since opening. Sales fell
20 percent to $282,000. “ Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark ” sold
$802,000, little changed from the previous week and its 11th
consecutive week below running costs of about $1 million.  “A Time to Kill,” based on the John Grisham bestseller,
had its worst week since opening on Oct. 20, grossing $215,000.  Off-Broadway,  Julie Taymor ’s production of “A Midsummer
Night’s Dream” inaugurated  Theatre for a New Audience ’s home
near the Brooklyn Academy of Music. The show was greeted with
almost universal thumbs-ups from critics.  Muse highlights include  Greg Evans  on TV and N.Y.  Scene   To contact the reporter on this story:
