Ras Laffan Liquefied Natural Gas Co.,
the world’s second-biggest producer, halted a  liquefaction
plant for planned maintenance, said two people with direct
knowledge of the work.  RasGas’s  Train 7  in Qatar shut at the beginning of the
month, said the people, who asked not to be identified because
they aren’t authorized to comment on the work. The unit would
halt for three to four weeks, one person said in January. RasGas
doesn’t comment on shutdowns, an official, who asked not to be
identified because of company policy, said today when reached by
phone.  Repairs at LNG plants in Qatar, the world’s biggest
producer of the fuel, may hamper supplies and boost prices in
short term markets from  Asia  to  Europe . Prices for LNG supplied
to Northeast Asia rose to $17.50 per million British thermal
units on Oct. 28, the highest since Feb. 25, according to
assessments by World Gas Intelligence, a New York-based
publisher of prices for the fuel.  RasGas, based in Doha, shut its smaller train 3 in
September, two people said at the time. The plant can produce
4.7 million tons of LNG a year. The work was completed last
month, one of the people said today.  Train 7 can produce 7.8 million metric tons a year, making
it the biggest by capacity along with five other plants in
Qatar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
