Shanghai Zendai Property Ltd. (755)  plans
to transform a Johannesburg suburb into the “New York of
Africa” with an 80 billion rand ($7.8 billion) investment over
the next 15 years, Chairman Dai Zhikang said.  The company, based in  Hong Kong , will build a financial
hub, as many as 35,000 houses, an educational center and a sport
stadium in the 1,600 hectares (3,950 acres) of land it purchased
from  AECI Ltd. (AFE)  in Modderfontein, eastern Johannesburg. The area,
currently used for manufacturing, is about 15 kilometers (9
miles) east of Sandton, the city’s main financial center, and
the same distance west of OR Tambo International Airport,
Africa’s biggest airport.  “It will become the future capital of the whole of
 Africa ,” Dai said at a press conference today, speaking through
a translator. “This will be on par with cities like New York in
America or Hong Kong in the  Far East .”  The development, which is yet to be named, will become a
hub for Chinese firms investing in sub-Saharan Africa, Dai said.
While Johannesburg already offers a base for companies investing
in Africa, the city hasn’t got enough space to cater for the
growing demand for offices and homes, he said.  The Chinese developer paid AECI 1.06 billion rand for the
land, it said in a statement yesterday. The area is home to an
explosives factory that opened in 1896 to support the gold-mining industry. It includes a wetlands area that will be
protected, and could be the equivalent of  Central Park  in New
York, Dai said.  Shanghai Zendai will invest its own money in the project
and work with other developers, Zhikang said. Once complete, the
city will provide jobs for 100,000 people and house about
100,000 more.  “Those cities we just mentioned they were there for 100
years,” Dai said. “We’re talking about the next 100 years.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
