West Texas Intermediate crude dropped
to a five-month low on speculation that inventories increased
for a seventh week in the U.S., the world’s biggest oil-consuming country.  Futures fell 1.3 percent before an Energy Information
Administration report tomorrow that will probably show crude
supplies rose 2.1 million barrels last week, according to the
median of 11 analyst responses in a Bloomberg survey. U.S. crude
output surged to a 24-year high in October while refinery demand
fell. WTI’s drop accelerated on the outlook for reduced U.S.
stimulus and euro-region growth.  “The market is pulling back on the perception that the
supply-demand balance isn’t going to tighten anytime soon,”
said  Stephen Schork , president of the Schork Group Inc., an
energy advisory company in Villanova,  Pennsylvania .  WTI for December delivery declined $1.25 to $93.37 a barrel
on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . It was the lowest
settlement since June 4. The volume of all WTI futures traded
was 21 percent below the 100-day average at 4:37 p.m.  Losses were trimmed after the  American Petroleum Institute 
reported that U.S. supplies grew 871,000 barrels last week. WTI
slid $1.13 to $93.49 a barrel at 4:37 p.m. in electronic
trading. It was $93.34 before the report’s release at 4:30 p.m.  Brent oil for December settlement slipped 90 cents, or 0.8
percent, to close at $105.33 a barrel on the London-based ICE
Futures Europe exchange. It was the lowest settlement since July
2. Volume was 8.7 percent lower than the 100-day average. The
European benchmark crude traded at a $11.96 premium to WTI at
today’s close, up from $11.61 yesterday.  Surging Output  WTI fell 5.8 percent in October, the biggest monthly
decrease in a year, as a surge in U.S.  crude production 
bolstered inventories. Output rose to 7.9 million barrels a day
as of Oct. 18, the fastest rate since March 1989, according to
the EIA, the Energy Department’s statistical unit.  “The U.S. is swimming in oil right now, and there’s been
no sign of a pickup in seasonal demand,” said  Addison Armstrong , director of market research at Tradition Energy in
 Stamford ,  Connecticut .  Refineries probably operated at 87.1 percent of capacity in
the seven days ended Nov. 1, down 0.2 percentage point from a
week earlier, the survey showed. Maintenance is scheduled after
the peak summer gasoline-demand season and before heating-fuel
demand increases in the winter.  Gasoline  stockpiles  probably declined 400,000 barrels,
according to the survey. Supplies of  distillate fuel , a category
that includes heating oil and diesel, probably dropped 1.5
million barrels.  Exceeding Projections  “The EIA reports over the last few weeks have outperformed
analyst estimates, and I wouldn’t be surprised if that happens
again tomorrow,” said Bob Yawger, director of the futures
division at Mizuho Securities USA Inc. in  New York . “The supply
situation is overwhelming everything else.”  The U.S. Institute for Supply Management’s gauge of  service
industries  rose more than forecast, spurring concern the  Federal
Reserve  will grow confident enough in the economy to reduce
stimulus. The ISM’s non-manufacturing  index  gained to 55.4 from
September’s 54.4, the Tempe, Arizona-based group said today. The
median  estimate  in a Bloomberg survey of economists was 54.  The dollar gained 0.3 percent to $1.3474 against the euro,
curbing demand for commodities denominated in the U.S. currency.
The S&P’s GSCI Index of 24 raw materials slid by 0.6 percent to
606.77, the lowest since April. Declines were led by WTI.  Economic Reports  Reports this week may show the  U.S. economy  slowed in the
third quarter and employers hired fewer workers in October.
Gross domestic product grew at a 2 percent annualized rate after
a 2.5 percent pace from April through June, according to
economists surveyed before Commerce Department data on Nov. 7.
Payrolls rose by 120,000 workers last month after a 148,000 gain
in September, Labor Department figures may show Nov. 8.  The euro area’s economy will expand 1.1 percent in 2014
less than the 1.2 percent forecast in May, and unemployment will
be 12.2 percent next year, above the 12.1 percent predicted
earlier, the European Commission in Brussels said today.  In Libya, the harbor of Hariga may resume operations next
week, according to state-run National Oil Corp. Hariga and three
other ports including Es Sider, the country’s biggest, have been
closed since July because of protests.  Libyan Production  Libya ’s daily crude output was about 250,000 barrels on
Nov. 3, Mohamed Elharari, a National Oil spokesman, said
yesterday. That’s down from 1.3 million barrels in the first
half of this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Further declines in WTI may be limited as a technical
indicator signaled that prices have dropped too quickly, Yawger
and Armstrong said. The 14-day relative strength index fell
below 27 today for the first time in a year, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Investors typically buy contracts when
the reading is less than 30, a sign a market is oversold.  “I don’t see prices sliding to $90 anytime soon because
the market is so oversold,” Yawger said. “If not for rising
supplies, prices would be up on the RSI.”  Implied volatility for at-the-money WTI options expiring in
December was 21.5 percent, up from 20.9 percent yesterday, data
compiled by Bloomberg showed.  Electronic trading volume on the Nymex was 439,323
contracts as of 4:40 p.m. It totaled 473,166 contracts
yesterday, 18 percent below the three-month average. Open
interest was 1.74 million contracts, the least since June 4.  To contact the reporter on this story:
