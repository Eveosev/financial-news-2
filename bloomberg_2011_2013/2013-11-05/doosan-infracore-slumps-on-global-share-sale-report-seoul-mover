Doosan Infracore Co. (042670) , South Korea’s
largest construction equipment company, declined the most in
more than two years in  Seoul  trading after a report of a
possible $400 million depositary-receipt sale sparked investor
concern that it would dilute shareholdings.  Doosan Infracore fell 8.3 percent, the most since October
2011, to close at 13,250 won. The stock was the second-worst
performer on the MSCI Asia Pacific Index.  Doosan Heavy
Industries & Construction Co. (034020) , its biggest  shareholder , dropped
3.3 percent.  The building-equipment maker is considering selling
depositary receipts overseas, Doosan Infracore said in a filing
after the report by MoneyToday. Doosan Infracore hired JPMorgan
Chase & Co. and HSBC Holdings Plc to help sell the receipts to
raise funds for possible future investments in  China  and Europe
as well as for its Bobcat unit in the U.S., MoneyToday reported
today, citing unidentified investment banking officials.  “News of Doosan Infracore seeking a global depositary
receipt sale was totally unexpected,” said Richard Park, an
analyst at Korea Investment & Securities Co. in Seoul. “If the
report is correct, it won’t be good news for investors.”  Doosan Infracore agreed to buy Bobcat for $4.9 billion from
Ingersoll-Rand Co. in 2007.  To contact the reporter on this story:
