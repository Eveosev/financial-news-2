Simply Wheelz LLC, which operates as
Advantage Rent A Car, plans to file for bankruptcy in
 Mississippi  after debt restructuring talks with  Hertz Global
Holdings Inc. (HTZ)  failed.  The filing is expected today,  Franchise Services of North
America Inc. , parent of Simply Wheelz, said in a statement.
Franchise Services bought the Advantage business after Hertz was
ordered to sell it to gain approval for a $2.3 billion
acquisition of Dollar Thrifty Automotive Group Inc. in July.  Franchise Services put Simply Wheelz in bankruptcy after
failing to agree with Hertz on credit restructuring, according
to the statement.  Hertz is the worldâ€™s largest airport general use  car-rental
brand , according to its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
