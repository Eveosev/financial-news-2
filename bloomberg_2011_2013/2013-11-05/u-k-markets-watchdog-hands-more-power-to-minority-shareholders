The U.K.’s markets watchdog said it
would give minority shareholders additional  voting rights  and
greater influence as part of new listing rules.  The changes allow for smaller shareholders to challenge
majority owners and increase transparency for  listed  companies,
the Financial Conduct Authority said in a  statement  today.
Independent directors on company boards will need separate
approval from minority shareholders, it said.  The rules are being introduced after disputes between
owners and other stakeholders at businesses listed in London and
controlled by wealthy foreigners, including  Kazakhstan ’s
Eurasian Natural Resources Corp. and Indonesian miner Bumi Plc.
IPO volumes in the U.K. have nearly tripled so far this year,
compared with the same period in 2012, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  “These changes will promote market integrity and empower
minority shareholders to hold the companies they invest in to
account,” David Lawton, the FCA’s director of markets, said in
the statement.  The FCA’s predecessor began consulting with market
participants about altering the listing regime in October 2012.
The changes will be implemented next year, it said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
