The two soccer ruling bodies on the
divided island of Cyprus agreed to work together to organize
local and international activities.  The Cyprus Football Association and the Cyprus Turkish
Football Association signed a preliminary agreement today at the
Zurich headquarters of FIFA, world’s soccer governing body,
according to a  statement  on FIFA’s website.  The CTFA will be a member of the CFA, which will be
responsible for organizing local soccer and for international
activities in all of Cyprus. The island has been divided into
the Republic of Cyprus in south and the Turkish Republic of
 Northern Cyprus  since 1974, when  Turkey  invaded in response to a
coup to unite Cyprus with  Greece .  The agreement is an “excellent example of how football can
build bridges and bring people together after a long period of
conflict,” FIFA PresidentSepp Blatter said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
