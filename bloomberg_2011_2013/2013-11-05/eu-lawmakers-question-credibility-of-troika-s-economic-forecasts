European Union lawmakers called for
euro-area bailout inspectors to improve their economic
forecasting as they questioned whether the debt crisis could
have been handled better.  The so-called troika, comprising representatives of the
European Commission, the  European Central Bank  and the
 International Monetary Fund , which shapes the conditions imposed
on euro-area countries receiving emergency aid, came up with
poorly designed bailout programs because of inaccurate
predictions, members of the European Parliament said today.  “If I look at the assumptions on which their policies have
been based, most of their forecasts have consistently been
wrong,” Derk Jan Eppink, a European lawmaker from  Belgium , told
a hearing in Brussels today. He said predictions about Greece’s
growth prospects and debt levels in 2012 were particularly wide
of the mark.  The questioning of the economic forecasts is part of an
inquiry being conducted by members of the 28-nation legislature
into how successful the troika has been in improving the
economies of countries receiving international aid.  “We may fail, we aren’t perfect, errors can be made,”
said Servaas Deroose, a commission economist who, as part of the
troika, helped negotiate  Greece ’s second bailout of 130 billion
euros ($175 billion) in 2012. “However, we have made a lot of
analysis on the accuracy of our forecasts and there I can stress
that the commission forecasts have a very good track record.”  Macroeconomic Forecasts  The ECB’s Klaus Masuch, who was also involved in the
negotiations in 2012, told the hearing that “especially on the
Greek macroeconomic forecasts” there was room for improvement.  “We know that the information set in Greece which
underpinned the forecasts which we made in April, May 2010 and
which underpinned the design of the first economic adjustment
program, was very incomplete and even included incorrect and
misleading statistics,” Masuch said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
