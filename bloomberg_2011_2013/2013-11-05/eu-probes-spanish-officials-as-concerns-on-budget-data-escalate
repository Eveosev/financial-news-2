European Union officials made an extraordinary visit to Spain in September that signals escalating concern about the reliability of the country’s budget data.  EU statisticians ordered a so-called  ad-hoc visit , a procedure reserved for urgent issues, to assess whether regional officials are complying with recommendations after failing to report all the unpaid bills they had accumulated in 2011, Tim Allen, a Luxembourg-based press officer for the statistics agency Eurostat, said in an e-mail. The visit included meetings with officials from Valencia and Madrid regions.  Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy  says reining in spending by the semi-autonomous regions has been a key pillar in Spain’s recovery as the economy expanded for the first time in more than two years between July and September. The nation has consistently missed EU budget targets since its deficit surpassed 3 percent of gross domestic product in 2009.  The government doesn’t comment on Eurostat visits because both the agenda and content of meetings are private, said a Madrid-based spokeswoman for the Budget Minister, who asked not to be name in line with government policy.  Officials from the Valencia region and the national comptroller’s office met a Eurostat delegation in Madrid in September, said a spokesman for the regional administration. Most of the recommendations from previous visits have already been implemented, he said.  ‘Lack of Initiative’  Eurostat raised concerns about Spanish data in April following at least two “upstream dialog visits,” the second of four levels of checks the agency has on member states’ statistical reporting.  September’s visit signaled a shift in gear to the second-most serious intervention. Ad-hoc visits are triggered by urgent issues regarding the quality or the methods used to produce the data, which only can be resolved with a face-to-face meeting, according to the agency Web  site .  Local and regional administrations in Spain need to make “substantial improvements to public accounting and statistical reporting,” the agency said in its April 30  report . “Eurostat notes the lack of initiative and preparedness to follow up the recommendations.”  Deficit Revisions  Valencia posted a budget deficit equivalent to 5 percent of GDP in 2011 after initially reporting a shortfall of 3.68 percent, according to the Budget Ministry. Madrid’s deficit was 1.96 percent compared with 1.13 percent initially  reported . That helped to push the country’s public sector deficit that year to 8.9 percent, the Budget Ministry said in a May 2012 statement. The final figure was revised later to 9.6 percent.  Eurostat officials checked the early warning systems being used by the Madrid region to avoid any future deficit deviations, a spokesman for Madrid’s regional budget and economy department said in an e-mailed statement.  The government is on track to meet its 6.5 percent deficit target this year after posting a shortfall of 10.6 percent last year, the largest in the EU, Deputy Budget Minister Marta Fernandez Curras said on Oct. 29.
