Crude options volatility rose as the
underlying futures slid to the lowest level in five months.  Implied volatility for at-the-money December options, a
measure of expected futures swings and a key gauge of value, was
21.66 percent at 4:05 p.m. on the  New York Mercantile Exchange ,
up from 20.9 yesterday. Puts protecting against a 10 percent
drop in prices increased to 31.49 percent compared with 30.53 in
the prior session.  West Texas Intermediate crude for December delivery fell
$1.25, or 1.3 percent, to $93.37 a barrel on the Nymex. It was
the lowest settlement since June 4. Price fell on speculation
that U.S. inventories climbed for a seventh straight week.  Puts, or bets that prices would fall, accounted for 52
percent of electronic trading volume today. The most-active
options were December $95 calls, which fell 52 cents to 65 cents
a barrel with 3,736 lots trading as of 4:06 p.m. December $90
puts rose 12 cents to 36 cents on volume of 2,813 lots.  In the previous session, puts accounted for 58 percent of
the 114,675 lots traded. December $90 puts fell 7 cents to 24
cents a barrel with 10,510 contracts trading. January $90 puts
declined 6 cents to 98 cents on volume of 5,109 lots.  Open interest yesterday was highest for December $80 puts,
with 42,541 contracts. Next were December $90 puts with 41,699
lots and December $85 puts with 34,742.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on open-outcry volume, where the bulk of options activity occurs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
