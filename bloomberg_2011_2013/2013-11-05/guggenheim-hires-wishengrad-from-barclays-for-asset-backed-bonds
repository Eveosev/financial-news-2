Guggenheim Partners LLC hired
 Barclays Plc (BARC) ’s Cory Wishengrad as a senior managing director in
its asset-backed debt group.  Wishengrad, who is based in New York, ran Barclays’s team
responsible for deals linked to unusual collateral such as music
royalties and franchise fees. He starts at Guggenheim Securities
in February, said Thomas Mulligan, a spokesman for Guggenheim at
Sitrick and Co.  Brandon Ashcraft, a spokesman for Barclays, declined to
comment.  Issuance of what are known as esoteric transactions have
been climbing with investors seeking out riskier debt as an
alternative to yields that reached record lows while the Federal
Reserve holds its interest-rate target near zero for a fifth
year and funnels more than $3 trillion into the financial
system.  To contact the reporter on this story:
