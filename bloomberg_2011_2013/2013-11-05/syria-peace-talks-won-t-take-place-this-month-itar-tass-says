International peace talks aimed at
ending the 2 1/2-year-old Syrian conflict won’t take place this
month as planned, the Russian state-run news service reported.  They may instead take place before the end of December, the
ITAR-TASS news agency said, citing an unidentified official at a
meeting today of representatives from  Russia , the U.S. and the
 United Nations  in Geneva to prepare for the talks.  No reason was given for the delay. The opposition hasn’t
yet agreed to attend the talks.  Efforts to end the fighting intensified after Russia and
the U.S. reached a deal in September to destroy  Syria ’s chemical
weapons, averting U.S. military action in retaliation for a
chemical attack the Obama administration said was carried out by
President Bashar al-Assad’s forces outside Damascus.  More than 100,000 people have died in the conflict that is
pitting Assad’s forces against rebels seeking to end his rule.
About 9.3 million Syrians, or 40 percent of the country’s
population, need aid, UN humanitarian chief  Valerie Amos  told
the Security Council yesterday.  Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman Alexander Lukashevich
didn’t pick up calls to his mobile and office number.  To contact the reporter on this story:
