Last week, we saw that enrollment through the state exchanges has been heavily weighted toward Medicaid patients. This week, the Wall Street Journal  reports  that it is also heavily biased toward the old: The big worry with the exchange malfunctions was that this would cause adverse selection -- the very sick would persevere, while the healthy would give up. The resulting skew in the insurance pool could touch off a “death spiral” where the prices keep going up, the healthiest remaining customers keep dropping out, and you end up with a very sick pool of patients paying a fortune for insurance. But it’s a little early to start diagnosing those kinds of problems. Even without the difficulties on the exchanges, you’d expect to see the oldest and sickest and poorest patients registering early. Those are the people for whom health-care expenses loom largest in the budget, so naturally, they are the most motivated to buy insurance. Understanding Health Insurance Exchanges What we want to know is what this pool will look like on Dec. 15. That’s not that far away. But hopefully, it’s far enough to sign up a lot more patients under the age of 50.
