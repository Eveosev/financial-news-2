About 9.3 million Syrians, or 40
percent of the country’s population, need aid, the  BBC  reported,
citing United Nations humanitarian chief  Valerie Amos .  The figure has risen by 2.5 million people since September,
the BBC reported, citing remarks by Amos to the UN Security
Council.  More than 100,000 people have died in the conflict pitting
Syrian President Bashar al-Assad against rebels seeking to end
his rule.  Lakhdar Brahimi, the joint UN and Arab League envoy on
Syria, will meet with Russian Deputy Foreign Ministers Mikhail Bogdanov and Gennady Gatilov, as well as U.S. Under Secretary of
State for Political Affairs Wendy Sherman, in Geneva today as
part of efforts to convene peace talks to resolve the crisis.  To contact the reporter on this story:
