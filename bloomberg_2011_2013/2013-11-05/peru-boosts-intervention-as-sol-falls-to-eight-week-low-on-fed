Peru ’s central bank increased sales
of dollar-linked securities after the sol fell to an eight-week
low on bets the  Federal Reserve  will reduce U.S. monetary
stimulus that has boosted demand for emerging-market assets.  Banco Central de Reserva del Peru sold 570 million soles in
two-month, dollar-indexed certificates of deposit, the biggest
such issuance since Aug. 20. The monetary authority sells the
securities to increase lenders’ dollar holdings and slow the
local currency’s depreciation. The central bank will probably
sell dollars in the  currency market  if the sol continues to
decline, said  Roberto Flores , the head of research at Inteligo
SAB, a Lima-based brokerage.  “The bank could sell a significant amount of dollars if
there are sharp movements like we saw today and the sol touches
or passes 2.80,” Flores said by phone from Lima.  The central bank sold $3.3 billion of dollars in the
currency market during July 2 to Oct. 9.  Peru’s currency depreciated 0.4 percent to a two-month low
of 2.7930 per  U.S. dollar  at the close of trading in Lima,
pushing this year’s decline to 8.6 percent, according to prices
from Datatec. The sol fell along with most of its emerging-market counterparts today as a gauge of U.S. service industries
climbed more than forecast in October, adding to the case for
the Fed to reduce monthly asset purchases designed to support
growth and cap borrowing costs.  The yield on the nation’s 7.125 percent dollar bond due
March 2019 rose five basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, to
2.85 percent at 2:59 p.m. in  Lima , according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The price fell 0.34 cent to 121.215 cents per dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
