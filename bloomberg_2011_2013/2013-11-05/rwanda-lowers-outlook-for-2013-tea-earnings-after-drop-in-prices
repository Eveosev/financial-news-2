Rwanda  lowered its outlook for tea
earnings after prices fell at the regional auction in the Kenyan
port city of Mombasa, where the country channels more than two-thirds of its output, an industry official said.  Income is forecast at $60 million this year, down from an
earlier estimate of $83 million and compared with 2012 earnings
of $66 million, Eric Kabayiza, planning director at the state-run National Agricultural Export Development Board, said
yesterday in an interview in the capital, Kigali.  Tea production in Rwanda,  Africa ’s sixth largest producer,
is expected to rise to 28,600 metric tons this year from 22,563
tons last year. Higher volumes at the weekly  Mombasa  auction has
pushed down prices, said Kabayiza.  The average auction price was $2.47 per kilogram in the
year to date, falling from $2.84 per kilogram over the same
period last year, Tea Brokers East Africa said on Oct. 29.  Offerings through the auction have risen 24 percent to
398.4 million kilograms with shipments also coming from  Kenya ,
Uganda, Tanzania, Burundi, Malawi, Madagascar, Democratic
Republic of Congo and  Mozambique , the organization said.  Coffee production in Rwanda is forecast to rise by 8
percent this year to 26,000 tons, fetching $75 million, up from
$61 million last year, Kabayiza said. The forecast for earnings
was cut from a previous estimate of $99 million, he said.  Rwanda’s tea and coffee exports represent the biggest
source of foreign-currency after tourism and mining.  To contact the reporter on this story:
