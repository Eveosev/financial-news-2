Symrise AG (SY1) , the fourth-largest maker
of flavors and fragrances, pledged to remain one of the most
profitable companies in its industry amid higher demand for
aroma molecules and fragrances.  Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization, will be about 20 percent of sales in 2013 and will
stay in the range of 19 percent to 22 percent in coming years,
the Holzminden, Germany-based company said today in a statement.
That margin was 21.2 percent in the third quarter.  Bigger rival  Givaudan SA (GIVN)  last month reported a drop in
quarterly sales amid emerging-market currency weakness. Symrise
Chief Executive Officer Heinz-Juergen Bertram has grown the
company with a new menthol factory and with the acquisition of
U.S. air freshener scent maker Belmay.  “The group expects sustained robust demand and positive
market dynamics for all regions and in both divisions,” the
company said. “We successfully left behind slight economic
slowdowns, which occurred in certain markets. Along with high
demand, our investments paid off.”  Average annual sales growth will be 5 percent to 7 percent
until 2020, Symrise said.  Earnings before interest and taxes gained 10 percent to
76.4 million euros ($103 million) in the third quarter. Sales
rose 4.1 percent to 466.5 million euros.  Symrise shares have gained 15 percent this year, boosting
the company’s market value to 3.68 billion euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
