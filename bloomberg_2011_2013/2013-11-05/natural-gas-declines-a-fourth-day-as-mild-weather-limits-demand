Natural gas futures slid to an
eleven-week low in  New York  on forecasts for mild mid-November
weather that would curtail demand for the heating fuel.  Gas dropped as much as 1.9 percent. WSI Corp. in Andover,
Massachusetts, said temperatures would be above normal in the
eastern two-thirds of the U.S. from Nov. 15 through Nov. 19. The
low in New York on Nov. 17 may be 43 degrees Fahrenheit (6
Celsius), 2 more than average, according to  AccuWeather Inc . in
 State College , Pennsylvania.  “The forecasts are getting warmer and that’s giving the
market some bearish momentum,” said  Phil Flynn , a senior market
analyst at Price Futures Group in Chicago. “The demand side of
the equation really has not been there.”  Natural gas for December delivery fell 4.5 cents, or 1.3
percent, to $3.40 per million British thermal units at 8:59 a.m.
on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . Trading volume was 61
percent above the average for the time of day. Prices have
climbed 1.4 percent this year. The futures dropped to $3.379 per
million Btu in intraday trading, the lowest price since Aug. 16.  To contact the reporter on this story:
