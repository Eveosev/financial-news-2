Sun Life Financial Inc. (SLF) , Canada’s
third-largest insurer, extended a C$140 million ($134 million)
mortgage to the developer of an Abbotsford, British Columbia,
mall that has Hennes & Mauritz AB and Wal-Mart Stores Inc.
shops.  The loan to Shape Properties Corp. for Highstreet Shopping
Centre is the largest conventional mortgage deal ever for Sun
Life, the insurer said in a statement today. The three-story
mall is held by Shape and Healthcare of Ontario Pension Plan.
It is about 60 kilometers (37 miles) from Vancouver and houses a
Cineplex Inc. movie theater and a  Starbucks Corp. (SBUX)  cafe.  Insurers have been turning to real estate as an alternative
to bonds with  interest rates  near record lows. The companies
invest funds that are held to back obligations to policyholders.  The Abbotsford deal is “consistent with our focus on high
quality, long-term investments,” Philip Gillin, senior managing
director of Canadian property investments at Toronto-based Sun
Life, said in the statement.  Sun Life Assurance Company of  Canada , the investing arm
that provided the financing, had C$105 billion in assets as of
June 30, including C$12 billion in commercial mortgages. The
unit provides fixed-rate loans for retail, office, industrial
and residential properties.  To contact the reporter on this story:
