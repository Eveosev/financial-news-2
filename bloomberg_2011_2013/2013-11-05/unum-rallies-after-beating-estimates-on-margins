Unum Group (UNM) , the largest U.S. provider
of disability coverage, gained the most in the 21-company
Standard & Poor’s 500 Insurance Index after third-quarter
earnings beat analysts’ estimates as profit margins improved.  The insurer rose 2.7 percent to $32.64 at 9:37 a.m. in New
York. Shares of the Chattanooga, Tennessee-based company jumped
57 percent this year, more than twice the gain of  S&P 500 Index .  Unum reported operating profit of 85 cents a share, beating
by three cents the average estimate in a Bloomberg survey of
analysts, after raising prices for coverage. Net income for the
quarter fell 11 percent to $205.7 million on investment results,
Unum said yesterday in a statement.  Results reflect a strategy of “improving profit margins as
the company holds the line on pricing and adding of new
customers in the U.S.,”  Eric Berg , an analyst at  RBC Capital
Markets , wrote in a research note. “Unum is raising prices on
group life in the U.K., where it had been experiencing serious
problems, and margins are improving dramatically as a result.”  Editors: Dan Kraut, Peter Eichenbaum  To contact the reporter on this story:
