South African white corn futures rose
to the highest level in more than seven months on the South
African Futures Exchange. The yellow variety fell.  White corn for delivery in December, the most active
contract, gained 0.4 percent to 2,469.40 rand ($242) a metric
ton by the noon close in Johannesburg, the highest closing price
for the contract since March 26. The yellow variety for delivery
the same month slipped 0.1 percent to 2,353 rand a ton.  South Africa is the continentâ€™s biggest corn producer. A
meal made from white corn is a staple food in the nation and the
yellow variety is mostly fed to animals.  Wheat for delivery in December snapped a four-day streak of
gains, retreating 0.2 percent to 3,567 rand a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
