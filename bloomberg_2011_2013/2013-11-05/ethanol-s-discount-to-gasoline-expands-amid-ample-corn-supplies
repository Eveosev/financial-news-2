Ethanol’s discount to gasoline
widened as distillers accelerated production amid ample supplies
of corn, the biofuel’s feedstock.  The spread between the December contracts expanded 0.99
cent to 89.61 cents a gallon. The corn  harvest  in the U.S. is 73
percent complete as of Oct. 27, compared with 59 percent a week
ago, the Agriculture Department reported yesterday.  “Harvest is doing quite well,” Renan Pimenta, a Campinas,
Brazil-based analyst for Intl FCStone Inc., said in a telephone
interview. “Distillers are stepping up, maximizing
production.”  Denatured ethanol for December delivery slipped 2.2 cents,
or 1.3 percent, to settle at $1.620 a gallon on the  Chicago 
Board of Trade. The November contract, which expired today, fell
0.2 cent to $1.70 a gallon.  December gasoline dropped 1.21 cents, or 0.5 percent, to
$2.5161 a gallon at the close of trading on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange . The contract covers reformulated gasoline,
made to be blended with ethanol before delivery to filling
stations.  The U.S. corn crop may be a record 14.03 billion bushels,
according to a Bloomberg survey of 36 analysts. The USDA is
scheduled to release its forecast for the crop on Nov. 8.  The corn crush spread, or the difference between the cost
of corn and the price of ethanol, based on December contracts,
was 8 cents a gallon, down from 9 cents yesterday, data compiled
by Bloomberg show.  Corn Falls  Corn for December delivery declined 1.25 cents, or 0.3
percent, to settle at $4.25 a bushel in Chicago. Prices have
dropped 39 percent this year, the worst performance among the 24
raw materials in Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot Index.  The Environmental Protection Agency tracks compliance with
the federal ethanol-use mandate with Renewable Identification
Numbers, or RINs, tradable certificates that are attached to
each gallon of biofuel.  Corn-based RINs gained 2.5 cents to 27.5 cents, the highest
since Oct. 22. Advanced RINs, which cover biodiesel and
Brazilian sugarcane-based ethanol, advanced 2 cents to 34 cents,
data compiled by Bloomberg show.  U.S. ethanol has dropped 22 percent this year, and that
means exports will continue to rise, FCStone’s Pimenta said.  Shipments soared to a five-month high of 1.19 million
barrels (49.98 million gallons) in August, the latest data
available, according to the Energy Information Administration.
Canada accounted for 66 percent of shipments, the EIA said.  In cash market trading, ethanol sank 1.5 cents to $2.02 a
gallon in  New York , 2.5 cents to $1.725 in Chicago and 1.5 cents
to $1.815 on the  Gulf Coast , data compiled by Bloomberg show.
Prices in the West Coast gained 5 cents to $1.89 a gallon.  The Gulf’s discount to the West Coast widened 6.5 cents to
7.5 cents, while Chicago’s discount to New York expanded by 1
cent to 29.5 cents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
