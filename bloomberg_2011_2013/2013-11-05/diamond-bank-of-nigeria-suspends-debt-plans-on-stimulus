Diamond Bank Plc (DIAMONDB) , a Nigerian lender,
put plans to raise debt capital on hold amid concern that a
reduction in Federal Reserve stimulus, which drove cash into
 emerging markets , may cause price volatility.  While the U.S. central bank kept its $85 billion in monthly
debt purchases unchanged in October, there’s speculation of a
reduction in asset buying in the first quarter of 2014, Chief
Executive Officer Alex Otti said during a conference call in
Lagos, the commercial capital.  Nigerian lenders are seeking dollars to help finance oil,
power and infrastructure projects in  Africa ’s top crude
producer. Diamond Bank, with  shares  that jumped 41 percent on
the Nigerian Stock Exchange this year, said on May 30 it was
considering a sale of $550 million in Eurobonds to boost
operations.  Concern about the effect of Fed tapering came “towards the
conclusion of our road show,” Otti said. “We’re monitoring the
situation and considering other capital-raising options.”  Emerging-market bonds and currencies fell earlier this year
as Fed officials signaled they may soon begin cutting the asset
purchases. Yields on African dollar-denominated  debt  have
climbed 134 basis points this year, compared with an average 99
basis-point  advance  in emerging-market bonds, according to
JPMorgan Chase & Co. indexes.  Yields on Nigeria’s sovereign dollar debt due July 2023
gained a fourth day, adding four basis points to 5.77 percent by
5:02 p.m. in Lagos, almost a three-week high. Diamond Bank’s
stock rallied 1.3 percent by the close in the city to 6.95
naira, the highest since May 30.  To contact the reporter on this story:
