Sturm, Ruger & Co. (RGR) , the largest
publicly traded U.S. gun maker, reported a 45 percent jump in
third-quarter sales, on high demand for new firearms.  Revenue surged to $170.9 million in the three months ended
in September, from $118.2 million a year earlier, the Southport,
Connecticut-based company said in a statement today. That beat
the $136 million estimate of Andrea James, an analyst at
Dougherty & Co. in  Minneapolis , who rates the shares neutral.  Sturm Ruger cited high demand for its new products,
including the LC380 pistol, the SR45 pistol, and the Ruger
American Rimfire rifle. The new products sales represented 32
percent of firearm sales in the first nine months, according to
the statement. Demand for Sturm Ruger products outpaced industry
demand, the company also said.  Third-quarter net income climbed to $28.7 million, or $1.44
a share, from $17.3 million, or 88 cents, a year earlier, the
company said.  Sturm Ruger shares rose less than 1 percent to $71.04 at
the close in  New York  today, the highest value since at least
Sept. 18, 1985. The stock has risen 56 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
