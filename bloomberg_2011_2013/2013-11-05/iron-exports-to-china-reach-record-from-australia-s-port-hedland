Iron ore shipments to  China  from Port
Hedland in  Australia  jumped 10 percent to a record in October as
a recovery strengthened in the world’s second-largest economy.  Exports rose to 25.2 million metric tons from 22.97 million
tons in September and 17.63 million tons in October 2012, data
from the Port Hedland Authority showed. China is the world’s
biggest buyer and Port Hedland is the largest bulk terminal.  Iron ore  prices  entered a bull market in July and reached a
two-month high this week after steel mills in China replenished
stockpiles and two manufacturing indexes reported faster growth.
Morgan Stanley last month increased its forecast for 2014 by 3
percent to $120 a ton and said the global seaborne market
remains in deficit well into next year.  Ore with 62 percent content delivered to the Chinese port
of Tianjin  increased  0.4 percent to $135.80 a dry ton yesterday,
according to The Steel Index Ltd. Prices have risen 23 percent
from this year’s low of $110.40 on May 31.  Total exports from Port Hedland were 28.94 million tons in
October compared with 28.96 million tons in September and 21.75
million tons in October last year, port data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
