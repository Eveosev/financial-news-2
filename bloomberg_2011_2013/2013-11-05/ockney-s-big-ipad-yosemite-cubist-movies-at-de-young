The intensely green and yellow landscapes of tree-lined roads, wheat fields and tile-roofed cottages of his native Yorkshire reveal David Hockney at the top of his game.  The 78-year-old artist selected works from the last decade for the show at San Francisco’s  de Young Museum .  He made his name in the 1960s painting Angelenos by their very blue pools. Since then, Hockney’s draftsmanship has grown even more relaxed and confident while the saturated colors are almost Fauvist.  The pictures -- some enormous in scale -- express a profound joy in the work itself, like Monet’s late views of his garden.  “Woldgate Woods” (2006), four images of the same forest cut through by country roads, is a celebration of the patterns that leaves and branches make against the sky.  The series is also a meditation on the changing seasons, from the pale oranges and browns of late winter to midsummer’s lush green.  And they’re big enough to bowl you over: Each six-panel work is 12 feet wide by 6 feet high.  The sprawling, roughly chronological show begins with a roomful of 2002-2003 watercolors, then a new medium for Hockney. He captures friends and associates sitting stiffly in lonely chairs, and there are also a handful of unsentimental, almost cruel, self-portraits.  Video Experiments  Hockney has long experimented with new media -- he made collages of Polaroid snapshots of the California desert back in the 1980s. More recently he’s branched out into drawing on an iPad and printing out the results, often at a vastly enlarged scale.  He’s also experimented with charcoal pencil drawings, employing a camera obscura for portrait work and making multi-camera videos with a Cubist bent. All of these excursions are included in the show, which displays some 400 works on two floors of the museum.  The iPad experiments represent Hockney at his most spectacular. The exhibition wraps up with two series: One, based on  Claude Lorrain ’s “Sermon on the Mount,” has a gigantic Biblical scene that’s 30 feet wide and 24 feet high.  The other is a trip to California’s  Yosemite  National Park, where images capture the grandeur of Half Dome’s sheer granite cliff towering over the valley floor.  Seeing the show is exhilarating.  “David Hockney: A Bigger Exhibition” runs through Jan. 20 at the de Young Museum, Golden Gate Park, San Francisco.
