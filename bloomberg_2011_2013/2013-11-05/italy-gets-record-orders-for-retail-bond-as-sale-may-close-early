Demand for  Italy â€™s inflation-linked
bond aimed at retail investors reached a record high in its
first day, prompting the Treasury to end the offer two days
ahead of schedule.  Italy received today orders for 16.8 billion euros ($22.6
billion), topping the amount sold in the first day of the four
previous sales, the Rome-based Treasury said in an e-mailed
statement. The offer will be closed tomorrow at 2 p.m. Rome
time, according to the statement.  Italy debt agency head Maria Cannata had told Class-CNBC in
an interview yesterday that the Rome-based Treasury would have
closed the offer early if it received at least 8.5 billion euros
of orders on the first day. The four-year bond, dubbed BTP
Italia, carries a 2.15 percent minimum coupon. Italy received
requests for 8.98 billion euros on the first day of the previous
sale of the securities in April, while demand was a record low
of 218 million euros in the June 2012 issuance.  The Treasury last year began reaching out to Italians, who
are among the biggest savers in  Europe , to help manage its 2
trillion-euro public debt as contagion from the debt crisis
triggered an exodus of foreign investors. In the four sales of
the BTP Italia since March 2012, Italy has raised more than 44
billion euros.  Italian 10-year yields rose 6 basis points to 4.2 percent,
with the spread over comparable German bunds narrowing 0.7 basis
points to 242.4 basis points.  To contact the reporters on this story:
