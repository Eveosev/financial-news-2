General Motors Co. (GM) , which sells more
vehicles in China than anywhere else, saw deliveries rise 12
percent in the country last month, driven by demand for Buicks
and Wuling minivans.  Total sales in October climbed to 282,446 units, the
Detroit-based company said in a statement today. Buick
deliveries rose 15 percent and Wuling sales increased 14
percent, it said.  October’s results kept GM on track to sell 3 million
vehicles this year in the world’s largest auto market. The
automaker is planning to step up promotions of its Chevrolet and
Cadillac brands while bolstering its line-up of  sport utility
vehicles  as it battles to fight off competition from  Volkswagen
AG (VOW)  for the top foreign automaker spot in  China .  Chevrolet sales gained 8 percent to 59,006 vehicles, while
deliveries of premium Cadillac vehicles increased 69 percent to
4,202 units.  Sales of Wuling vehicles, which account for almost half of
GM’s China sales, increased 14 percent to 135,687 units last
month.  Though GM was the top-selling foreign automaker in China
last year, Volkswagen has pulled ahead in deliveries during the
first three quarters, selling 2.35 million vehicles to GM’s 2.31
million units.  At the Shanghai auto show in April, GM unveiled plans to
spend $11 billion through 2016 on expanding in China. the
company estimates the four new assembly plants will, when
completed, boost annual capacity to 5 million vehicles -- double
the number of cars it sold in the U.S. last year.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
