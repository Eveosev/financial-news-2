Solazyme Inc. (SZYM) , a U.S. producer of
renewable oil from algae, expects to begin commercial production
at its Moema plant in  Brazil  later than planned.  “Our timeline for oil production at Moema has been moved”
into the first quarter, the South San Francisco-based company
said today in an earnings statement. “We are excited to be
nearing commercial production.”  Solazyme said in August that the plant was 80 percent
complete and would begin initial commercial-scale operations
this year. The delay is due “in part to accommodate additional
enhancements we are making at the facility,” according to the
statement.  The company makes oils from sugar-consuming algae that are
processed into renewable fuel and specialty chemicals.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
