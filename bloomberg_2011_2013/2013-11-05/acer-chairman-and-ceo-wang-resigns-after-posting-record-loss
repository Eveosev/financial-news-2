Acer Inc. (2353) , Taiwan’s second-largest
computer maker, plunged to a 12-year low in Taipei trading after
announcing a record loss, job cuts and the resignation of J.T. Wang as chief executive officer.  Shares fell 6.9 percent, the daily limit, to NT$16.90 as of
11:31 a.m., the lowest since October 2001. Acer posted a net
loss of NT$13.1 billion ($445 million) in the three months ended
Sept. 30, compared with analyst estimates for a NT$59 million
loss, after writedowns of five  acquisitions  including Gateway
Inc. and iGware Inc., it said yesterday.  Demand for personal computers has slumped globally as
consumers shift to mobile devices including tablets produced by
 Samsung Electronics Co. (005930)  and  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  Wang, who in early 2010
predicted the company would overtake  Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ)  as the
biggest maker, will be replaced by President  Jim Wong  from Jan.

strategic changes.  “We believe earnings will get worse before they get better
due to our outlook for weakness for the PC industry,”  Kirk Yang , an analyst at Barclays Plc in Hong Kong, said in a report
today as he cut the stock to underweight from equalweight. “We
would not be surprised to see the company making more senior
management changes.”  Acer’s loss comes as  HTC Corp. (2498) , the largest smartphone
maker in Taiwan, forecast worse-than-expected fourth-quarter
sales amid weak demand for its One max handset. Sales will be
NT$40 billion to NT$45 billion, trailing the NT$52.2 billion
average of 21 analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Zero Buys  Of the 30 analysts  tracked  by Bloomberg, zero recommend
buying Acer stock and 19 rate it a sell. There are 11 holds.  The loss spurred Acer to announce a 7 percent cut in its
global workforce and plans to issue 136 million new shares. The
restructuring will result in a one-time cost of $150 million
this quarter, it said.  J.T. Wang will retain the chairman’s role at Acer until
June, the company said.  Fourth-quarter mobile device shipments at Acer may fall
about 10 percent from the third quarter, Henry Wang, a spokesman
for Acer, said today in a briefing at the  Taiwan  stock exchange.  The introduction of tablet devices, such as Apple’s iPad,
and the failure of new versions of Microsoft Corp.’s Windows
operating system to drive demand has pushed PC sales lower.
Industry shipments dropped 11.4 percent in the second quarter
from a year earlier, according to Bloomberg Industries data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
