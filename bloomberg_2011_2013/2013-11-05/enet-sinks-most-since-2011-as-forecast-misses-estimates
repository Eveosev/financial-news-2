Tenet Healthcare Corp. (THC) , the operator
of 77 hospitals and 176 outpatient centers, sank the most in
almost two years after its fourth-quarter forecast was less than
analysts’ estimates because of slow patient admissions.  Tenet dropped 9.2 percent to $43.82 at 10:07 a.m. New York
time, after touching $43.37 in the biggest intraday decline
since December 2011. The shares of the Dallas-based company had
gained 49 percent this year through yesterday.  Tenet forecast fourth-quarter earnings before interest,
taxes, depreciation and amortization of as much as $450 million,
excluding some items, in a statement yesterday. That was less
than analysts’ average $482 million estimate, Frank Morgan, an
analyst with RBC Capital Markets, wrote in a research note
today.  “Management’s fourth-quarter 2013 guidance is below
consensus and reflects continued soft inpatient volumes,”
Morgan wrote, also pointing out a difficult reimbursement
environment and the completion of Tenet’s $1.8 billion
acquisition of Vanguard Health Systems Inc. The forecast, he
said, “assumes minimal synergies captured in the fourth-quarter
2013.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
