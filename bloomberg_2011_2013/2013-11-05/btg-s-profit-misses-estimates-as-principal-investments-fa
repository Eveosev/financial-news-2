Grupo BTG Pactual,  Brazil ’s biggest
merger adviser, said third-quarter profit fell 6 percent,
missing analysts’ estimates, as revenue from principal
investments dropped.  Net income declined to 746 million reais ($326 million), or
82 centavos a share, from 793 million reais, or 90 centavos, a
year earlier, the Sao Paulo-based bank said today in a
statement. The result fell short of the 88-centavo estimate of
 four  analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Principal investments, which includes private equity, real
estate and proprietary trading, posted a revenue of 292 million
reais in the third quarter, according to the statement. That
compares with a negative contribution of 313 million reais in
the second quarter and a gain of 566 million reais a year
earlier.  “Markets continued to present challenges in an uncertain
environment,” Chief Executive Officer  Andre Esteves , 45, wrote
on the earnings statement today.  BTG shares have  slid  2 percent this year, while the
Ibovespa benchmark index declined 12 percent.  The bank advised on 42 acquisitions this year, totaling
$27.1 billion, including the purchase of Portugal Telecom SGPS
SA by Oi SA, Brazil’s biggest transaction, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
