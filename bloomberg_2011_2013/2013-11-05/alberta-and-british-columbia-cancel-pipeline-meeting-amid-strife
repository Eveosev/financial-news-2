Alberta  Premier Alison Redford and
her British Columbia counterpart Christy Clark canceled a
meeting scheduled for today in Vancouver amid a disagreement on
how economic benefits of pipeline projects should be shared.  Redford and Clark have clashed over British Columbia’s
opposition to  Enbridge Inc. (ENB) ’s proposed Northern Gateway
pipeline, as landlocked Alberta seeks to move its oil-sands
crude to Pacific energy markets. Senior officials from both
provinces met yesterday in Vancouver.  “We remain hopeful that common ground will be found
between our two provinces on moving energy resources to new
markets,” Redford said yesterday in an e-mail statement.
“Given the ongoing work between our provinces, the meeting
between Premier Clark and I will be postponed.”  Calgary-based Enbridge,  Canada ’s largest oil pipeline
operator, is proposing to build a 1,177-kilometer (731-mile)
conduit through British Columbia from Alberta to transport
bitumen to Asian customers.  Alberta contends that British Columbia should negotiate the
sharing of benefits with oil producers and the pipeline
industry, Redford said in the statement.  “While it is clear what British Columbia is asking for, it
is not clear why they think that the Government of Alberta is
the appropriate partner to negotiate this with,” she said.  Redford is scheduled to speak today on energy industry
developments at a forum organized by the  Vancouver  Board of
Trade.  To contact the reporter on this story:
