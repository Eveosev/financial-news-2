U.S.  stocks  declined, following two days of gains that sent the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index to within five points of a record high, as investors awaited this week’s data on economic growth and employment.  Homebuilders slumped 1.8 percent as a group as JPMorgan Chase & Co. said  D.R. Horton  Inc.’s order growth may trail analysts’ expectations. Delphi Automotive Plc dropped 5.2 percent after narrowing its profit projection.  Tenet (THC)  Healthcare Corp. tumbled 8.8 percent as the hospital chain’s earnings forecast missed estimates. GT Advanced Technologies Inc. surged 21 percent after agreeing to supply equipment to Apple Inc.  The  S&P 500 (SPX)  fell 0.3 percent to 1,762.97 at 4 p.m. in  New York . The  Dow Jones Industrial Average  lost 20.90 points, or 0.1 percent, to 15,618.22. About  6.2 billion  shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, 5 percent above the three-month average.  “The market is in a quandary right now,” Colleen Supran, a principal at San Francisco-based Bingham, Osborn & Scarborough, which manages about $3 billion, said in a phone interview. “For jobs, you’re just hoping you still see some steady traction, but it’s hard to predict, because a healthy jobs market might also mean that the Fed feels more comfortable with an earlier tapering date. It’ll be a little choppy.”  The  S&P 500  climbed 0.4 percent yesterday, building on four straight weeks of gains that sent the index to a record 1,771.95 on Oct. 29, as Exxon Mobil Corp. and U.S. Steel Corp. led a rally among commodity shares. The benchmark gauge has surged 23.6 percent this year, poised for the best annual performance since 2003, as company earnings beat forecasts and the  Federal Reserve  maintained stimulus measures.  Economic Data  Investors are watching data to gauge the health of the  U.S. economy  after the central bank last week said it needs to see more evidence of sustained improvement before slowing the pace of its $85 billion monthly bond purchases. Economists in a Bloomberg survey project that tapering will begin in March, based on the median estimate.  The European Union cut its forecast for euro-area growth next year and raised its unemployment estimate as the economy struggled to regain momentum after a record-long recession. In the U.S.,  service industries  unexpectedly accelerated in October, as the  Institute for Supply Management ’s U.S. non-manufacturing index rose to 55.4 from 54.4 the prior month.  Fed Bank of Richmond President  Jeffrey Lacker  said the U.S. economy will probably grow just 2 percent next year, with no new source of strength. The forecast is far below the 2.9 percent to 3.1 percent estimate among Federal Open Market Committee participants at a Sept. 17-18 meeting.  GDP Growth  Economists in a Bloomberg survey last week predicted a report will show the economy expanded 2 percent in the third quarter, down from 2.5 percent the previous quarter. The Commerce Department plans to release its initial estimate of third-quarter growth on Nov. 7.  A report the next day may show employers hired fewer workers in October. Payrolls rose by 125,000 workers last month after a 148,000 gain in September, Labor Department figures may show.  “A lot of people are nervous by how strong the market has been this year,” Patrick Kaser, a managing director and portfolio manager at Brandywine Global Investment Management in Philadelphia, said by phone. His firm oversees about $45 billion. “There is still skepticism about how the economy is really doing and whether these gains are from artificial factors, like the Fed, or from real strength in company results.”  Of the 404 S&P 500 companies that have reported  earnings  so far, 75 percent have beaten analysts’ forecasts, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

Horton’s quarterly order growth may miss his expectation, which is already below other analysts’ estimates. D.R. Horton, scheduled to announce results on Nov. 12, sank 2.2 percent to $18.41.  Delphi Automotive dropped 5.2 percent to $55.01. The auto-parts maker narrowed its earnings forecast, saying it expects to earn $4.25 to $4.35 a share this year. That trailed the average analyst estimate of $4.41 in a Bloomberg survey.  Slow Admissions  Tenet Healthcare  declined 8.8 percent to $44 for the biggest loss in the S&P 500. The hospital chain’s fourth-quarter forecast was less than analysts’ estimates because of slow patient admissions.  Expeditors International of Washington Inc. dropped 6.2 percent to $43.41.
