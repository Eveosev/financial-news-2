President  Jeffrey Lacker  said  income inequality  has increased in
recent years because of the rising importance of a college
degree and advanced skills for U.S. employers.  “The rich are increasingly likely to remain rich, and the
poor are increasingly likely to remain poor,” Lacker said today
in Charlotte,  North Carolina . “The disparity in outcomes
between those who have acquired skills, often in the form of
college education, and those who have not likely plays a large
role.”  Lacker, who didn’t comment on the economic outlook or
monetary policy in his prepared remarks, said the labor market
remains “weak,” with unemployment at 7.2 percent. Employers
have difficulty filling jobs that demand highly-skilled workers,
Lacker told a group of college students and faculty at Johnson
C. Smith University in Charlotte today.  About 8 percent of U.S. high school students drop out,
which Lacker said amounts to an “economic death sentence” and
may be “unacceptably high.” The  unemployment rate  among
workers with college degrees is just 3.7 percent, he said.  The U.S. jobless rate probably rose to 7.3 percent last
month, with 120,000 jobs added, according to a Bloomberg News
survey before the Nov. 8 report.  Lacker, 58, has been president of the Richmond Fed since
2004. He was previously the regional bank’s director of
research. His district includes Maryland, Virginia, North
Carolina,  South Carolina  and most of West Virginia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
