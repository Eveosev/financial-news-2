Italy’s government bonds declined for
a second day as the nation prepared to sell an inflation-linked
retail bond for the second time this year.  Spain’s securities also fell before the European Central
Bank meets this week to set monetary policy. Euro-region
government bonds rallied last week as slowing inflation boosted
bets the central bank will cut interest rates. Austria plans to
sell 1.65 billion euros ($2.23 billion) of debt maturing in 2018
and 2022 today. German bunds fell before the nation sells as
much as 4 billion euros of five-year notes tomorrow.  Benchmark  Italian 10-year yields  rose three basis points,
or 0.03 percentage point, to 4.15 percent at 8:56 a.m. London
time. The 4.5 percent bond maturing in March 2024 fell 0.275, or
2.75 euros per 1,000-euro face amount, to 103.285.  Italy last sold a retail bond in April, when investors
ordered more than 17 billion euros of the inflation-linked
securities, prompting the Treasury to shut down the sale two
days early.  Italian bonds returned 6.8 percent this year through
yesterday, according to Bloomberg World Bond Indexes. Spain’s
gained 11 percent, while  Germany ’s lost 0.9 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
