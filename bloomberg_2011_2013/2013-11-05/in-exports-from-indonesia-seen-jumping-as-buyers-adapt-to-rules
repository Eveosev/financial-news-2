Tin shipments from  Indonesia  probably
rebounded last month from September as buyers began to adjust to
new rules that have curbed sales from the biggest exporter,
while remaining on course for a drop this quarter. Prices fell.  Exports of refined metal and products increased to 2,750
metric tons in October from 786 tons in September, the median of
estimates from four analysts and four producers compiled by
Bloomberg showed. The forecast compares with exports of 11,048
tons in October 2012. Shipments in September were the lowest
monthly total since 2007, when the government began tracking
sales of the metal used as solder and packaging.  Indonesia ordered exporters from Aug. 30 to trade the metal
on a local exchange before shipment, seeking greater control
over supplies and prices in a challenge to the  London  Metal
Exchange. The rule pushed futures to a six-month high in October
and forced PT Timah, the country’s largest producer, to declare
force majeure. Exports may drop 64 percent to 10,000 tons this
quarter compared with the same period in 2012, the median of
estimates from three analysts and four producers showed.  “Exports must be prevented from rising too much,” Agung Nugroho, corporate secretary at Timah, said by phone from
Jakarta on Nov. 4. “We want to boost sales. But if we do that
and supplies are increasing rapidly, the regulation won’t work.
We don’t need big volume.”  BNP’s Outlook  Futures, which rallied to $24,000 a ton on Oct. 4, fell 0.2
percent to $22,952 at 2:58 p.m. in  Singapore . Tin outperformed
the five other main base metals on the LME this year amid
forecasts for a global deficit and the Indonesian shift. The
trading rule may help to boost prices to average $25,000 next
year, according to Stephen Briggs, an analyst at BNP Paribas SA
in London ranked by Bloomberg as the top forecaster over the
past eight quarters.  Shippers from Indonesia are carefully maintaining quality
in accordance with the new rules to build customers’ trust,
Nugroho said. Indonesia, which may release the October trade
figures next week, set the minimum purity for exports at 99.9
percent and maximum lead content of 300 parts per million.  Trading on the  Indonesia Commodity and Derivatives
Exchange , the only bourse that’s allowed to trade the metal
before shipment, more than doubled to 3,020 tons in October from
September, exchange data show. Members that can trade tin rose
to 28 from 12 on Aug. 30, the Jakarta-based ICDX said Oct. 30.
That comprises 16 producers and 12 buyers, it said.  LME Stockpiles  Stockpiles tracked by the LME dropped to 12,120 tons
yesterday, 21.5 percent below a 22-month high Aug. 30, when the
rule took effect. Indonesia, which used to account for about 40
percent of global trade, exported 98,817 tons last year.  Global demand will rise 2.3 percent to 350,000 tons next
year, exceeding supply by 2,000 tons after an estimated 4,000-ton shortage in 2013, according to BNP. Unless Indonesian
exports rebound there will probably be a period of “severe
market tightness,” Briggs wrote in an Oct. 15 report.  PT Timah (TINS)  -- based in Pangkalpinang, Bangka Belitung, the
country’s main producing area -- reported a drop in third-quarter net income after declaring force majeure. Shares
declined as much as 2.5 percent to 1,550 rupiah, the lowest
level since Oct. 25, and traded at 1,560 rupiah.  To contact the reporters on this story:
