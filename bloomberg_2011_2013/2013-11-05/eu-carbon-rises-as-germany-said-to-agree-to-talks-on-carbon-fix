European Union carbon permits rose
for the first time since Oct. 29 after  Germany  agreed to back
talks between nations and the bloc’s Parliament on a draft
carbon-market fix.  Permits for December closed 5.3 percent higher at 4.80
euros ($6.47) a metric ton on  London ’s ICE Futures  Europe .
Germany’s representative to the EU will be directed to back a
mandate for the talks at a meeting in Brussels on Nov. 8, a
German government official, who asked not to be identified
because an announcement hasn’t been made, said today by phone.  Prices rose as much as 5.9 percent to 4.83 euros a ton.
Permits fell to a record 2.46 euros a ton in April as an
oversupply of EU allowances swelled to 1.8 billion tons,
according to the European Commission, the bloc’s regulator.  The outcome of negotiations will need to be backed by the
assembly and by ministers before the measure, which will enable
delays of carbon auctions, becomes a law. In the next stage,
 member states  will need to vote on a separate regulation to set
out the details of backloading, including the exact timing and
volume of allowances to be postponed.  To contact the reporters on this story:
