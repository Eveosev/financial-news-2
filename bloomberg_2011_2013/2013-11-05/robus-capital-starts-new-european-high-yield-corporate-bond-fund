Robus Capital Management Ltd. started
its first high-yield corporate bond fund which will focus on
securities issued by mid-sized European companies.  The Robus Mid-Market Value Bond Fund aims to deliver “mid-to-high single digit” annual returns by buying debt mainly in
the secondary market, Managing Director Dieter Kaiser said in an
interview at Bloomberg’s London office. It is the firm’s third
credit fund and it will target the debt of companies in German-speaking countries.  “There is growing demand for high-yield bonds with issue
size between 50 million euros ($67 million) to 250 million
euros,” Frankfurt-based Kaiser said. Smaller transactions tend
to offer better value than large deals, he said.  The fund’s size will be capped at 200 million euros and it
will comply with European rules for fund managers known as
UCITS.  To contact the reporter on this story:
