WestJet Airlines Ltd. (WJA)  reported third-quarter profit that beat analysts’ estimates and said it plans
to reach its goal of cutting C$100 million ($95.8 million) in
annual costs one year ahead of schedule.  Net income fell 7.8 percent to C$65.1 million, or 50 cents
a share, from C$70.6 million, or 52 cents, a year earlier, the
Calgary-based company said today in a statement. The average of
 estimates  compiled by Bloomberg was 49 cents a share. Revenue
rose 6.7 percent to C$924.8 million, compared with the C$924.8
million average projection, as WestJet flew 4.94 million
passengers -- a 7.1 percent increase.  Canada’s second-largest carrier said it has identified and
is implementing measures that will allow it to reduce costs by
C$100 million in 2014. The airline also expects measures such as
a new fare structure, which was put in place earlier this year,
to help bolster annual revenue by as much as C$80 million.  WestJet  fell  0.4 percent to C$27.30 in Toronto yesterday.
The shares have gained 38 percent this year, compared with a 7.5
percent advance for  Canada ’s benchmark Standard & Poor’s/TSX
Composite  Index. (SPTSX)   To contact the reporter on this story:
