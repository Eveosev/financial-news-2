Atlantic Express Transportation
Corp., a school bus fleet operator, filed for bankruptcy in New
York saying the operation is unsustainable because of union
labor costs and operating expenses.  The company, based in  Staten Island , New York, listed
assets of as much as $500 million and the same amount in
liabilities in its Chapter 11 filing yesterday in U.S.
Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan. Atlantic Express’s 39 affiliates
also filed for bankruptcy.  “Our current business model in our largest market,  New
York City , is not sustainable as union labor costs and operating
expenses have severely hindered our ability to remain
competitive,” David Carpenter, chief executive officer, said in
a statement distributed by  Business Wire .  Atlantic Express will continue operating as it seeks
additional debt or equity financing during the bankruptcy, the
company said in the statement. The company will also put some
assets up for sale and continue labor negotiations on a new
collective agreement with the Amalgamated Transit Union, it
said.  Atlantic Express said it’s the fourth biggest school bus
company, employing more than 5,800 people who transport children
in more than 100 school districts.  The case is In re: Atlantic Express Transportation Corp.
