New World Resources Plc (NWR)  slumped the
most in six weeks on investor expectations the biggest Czech
producer of coking coal will post a third-quarter loss tomorrow
and as miners threaten to strike.  The  stock  dropped as much as 14 percent before paring its
decline to 6.8 percent at 26 koruna by 12:44 p.m. in Prague,
extending its retreat this year to 73 percent. The number of
shares traded was 11 percent above its three-month daily average
 volume , according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  NWR incurred a loss of 59.3 million euros ($80 million) in
the three months through September, according to the median
estimate of eight analysts in a Bloomberg survey. It would be
the fourth quarterly loss in a row as the company battles lower
coking-coal prices and a fall in demand from customers such as
 ArcelorMittal (MT) , the world’s biggest steelmaker.  “The third quarter will be again weak,” Bohumil Trampota,
an analyst at J&T Banka, said in an e-mailed note. “The
deterioration is due to a slump in coal and coke prices.”  Miners at NWR are considering going on strike as early as
next week after unions failed to reach an agreement with the
management on wages and other conditions for the next four
years, according to a note from Erste Group Bank AG analyst Petr
Bartek. The workers are also challenging the company’s decision
to close its unprofitable Paskov mine at the end of next year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
