Turkey hired  Barclays Plc (BARC) ,  Credit
Suisse Group AG (CSGN)  and Deutsche Bank AG to arrange the sale of the
first sovereign euro-denominated bond in more than three years.  The planned securities will mature in 2021, the Ankara-based Treasury said in a statement. The benchmark-size bonds
will be priced in the area of 4.625 percent, said one person
familiar with the plans, who asked not to be identified because
the details are private. The country last sold euro-denominated
debt in April 2010, when it raised 2 billion euros ($2.7
billion) in 10-year securities.  “East European investors demand euro-denominated assets,”
Neslihan Yilmaz, a trader at Maxis Securities in  London , wrote
in e-mailed comments. “It’s possible that  Turkey  wanted to tap
that market if you consider that there has not been a euro debt
sale for a long time.”  Turkey is rated Baa3 at Moody’s Investors Service, the
lowest investment grade. The government raised $1.25 billion
from a dollar-denominated Islamic bond sale on Oct. 3.  To contact the reporters on this story:
