U.S. stocks and commodities fell,
trimming monthly rallies, as a jump in jobless claims spurred
concern about the labor market before tomorrow’s employment
data. Treasuries gained while the euro capped a sixth straight
monthly gain, its longest streak in a decade.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell 0.3 percent to
1,498.11 at 4 p.m. in New York, trimming its best January rally
since 1997. The  Stoxx Europe 600 Index (SXXP)  closed down 0.5 percent.
The S&P GSCI Index of commodities slipped 0.1 percent from its
highest level  since September  after earlier losing as much as
0.6 percent. Ten-year Treasury yields fell one basis point to
1.98 percent. The euro traded at $1.3576, near a 14-month high.  Data tomorrow is forecast by economists to show payrolls
increased by 165,000 in January for a 28th straight month of
growth, yet not enough to reduce the 7.8 percent unemployment
rate. Early losses in stocks and commodities today came after
the Labor Department said jobless claims grew by 38,000 to
368,000 last week, adding to concern about the economy a day
after data showed gross-domestic product unexpectedly shrank
last quarter.  “It’s more about fundamentals and the global picture than
the jobs report,” Brad Thompson, managing director and fund
manager at Frost Investment Advisors, based in San Antonio,
 Texas , said in a phone interview. “As long as the jobs report
doesn’t disappoint. I think we can ride through that.”  $2.6 Trillion  About $2.6 trillion has been added to the value of  equities 
worldwide this month as earnings from companies including
General Electric Co. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. beat estimates
and U.S. lawmakers forged a deal to avert the so-called fiscal
cliff of automatic spending cuts and tax increases that
threatened to plunge the economy back into recession.  Including dividends, the S&P 500 rallied 5.2 percent this
month for its best January return since 1997. The benchmark
gauge for American equities retreated yesterday from a five-year
high, and is trading less than 4.5 percent below its 2007
record. The MSCI All-Country World Index has increased 4.5
percent in its best January since 1994.  “Over the last six months, we’ve had a big re-rating of
stocks, but we haven’t had the earnings power coming through,”
Toby Nangle, head of multi-asset allocation at Threadneedle
Asset Management, told Bloomberg Television. “Earnings are
going to be critical. We need to get delivery on what we’ve
already paid for.”  Earnings Season  Among U.S. stocks moving today, United Parcel Service Inc.
slid 2.4 percent on a profit forecast that trailed estimates as
a weak global economy hurts demand for shipping. Dow Chemical
Co. slid 7 percent after earnings missed forecasts as sales fell
in  Europe . Qualcomm Inc. rose 3.9 percent and JDS Uniphase Corp.
rallied 17 percent amid better-than-anticipated earnings.  Earnings have beaten the average analyst estimate at about
75 percent of the 232 companies in the S&P 500 that released
results so far in the quarter exceeded  profit projections ,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Sales have topped
estimates at 66 percent, the data show.  The gain in initial jobless claims reported today was the
most since Nov. 10 and topped the 350,000 median forecast in a
survey of economists. Data tomorrow may show employers added
165,000 workers this month, according to the median of
economists’ projections. The  unemployment rate  is forecast to
have held at 7.8 percent.  Economic Data  Another report showed personal incomes rose 2.6 percent
last month, the biggest gain since December 2004 when Microsoft
Corp. paid a special divided. In addition to improving wages and
salaries, some companies paid dividends and employee bonuses
earlier than usual before tax rates went up this year, signaling
the surge in incomes will be reversed in the first three months
of 2013.  Business activity in the U.S. expanded more than forecast
in January, with the MNI Chicago Report’s business barometer
rising to 55.6 this month, the highest since April, after 50 in
December. A reading of 50 is the dividing line between expansion
and contraction. The median forecast of 48 economists was 50.5.  Silver, wheat and gold lost at least 1 percent for the
biggest declines among commodities. Gasoline slipped 0.4 percent
to $3.0258 a gallon, while crude oil fell 0.5 percent to $97.49
a barrel. Sixteen of the 24 commodities tracked by the S&P GSCI
declined, while cocoa and heating oil helped lead gains.  Gold futures fell the most in almost four weeks, losing 1.2
percent to $1,662 an ounce, as concern about U.S. inflation
waned after government data showed an index of prices tied to
spending patterns was unchanged in December from November.  The S&P GSCI capped a 4.5 percent gain for January, its
biggest advance since August.  European Markets  Two stocks  fell  for each that gained in the Stoxx 600, with
the volume of shares changing hands on the gauge 24 percent
higher than the 30-day average, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  AstraZeneca Plc tumbled 3.2 percent, the most in nine
months, after the U.K. drugmaker forecast profit this year will
decline. Royal Dutch Shell Plc dropped 2.7 percent as fourth-
quarter profit missed analyst estimates on weaker North American
fuel prices. Ericsson AB, the world’s largest maker of wireless
networks, jumped 7.6 percent after reporting a bigger gain in
sales than analysts projected.  Banco Santander SA (SAN)  slid 3.5 percent as Spain’s biggest
lender posted fourth-quarter profit that missed analyst
estimates. The shares were the biggest drag on Spain’s IBEX 35
Index, which slid 2.4 percent to lead losses in 94 national
benchmark indexes tracked by Bloomberg. After Spain’s market
closed, regulators lifted a ban on short-selling stocks.  Beating Estimates  In western Europe, 57 percent of companies reporting
results have beaten analysts’  profit estimates , according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Some 63 percent have exceeded
revenue projections.  Germany ’s 10-year bund yield fell three basis points to
1.68 percent after reaching 1.73 percent yesterday, the highest
since Sept. 17. Rates on French and British 10-year securities
also declined, while Greek and Portugal yields rose.  The  MSCI Emerging Markets Index (MXEF)  was little changed, capping
a 1.2 percent monthly gain. The Shanghai Composite Index added
0.1 percent to the highest since May 29.  India ’s Sensex gauge
lost 0.6 percent,  Brazil ’s Bovespa index rallied 0.7 percent and
 Russia ’s Micex Index added 0.2 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
