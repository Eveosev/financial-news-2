Chilean local investors cut bets in
the forwards market on the peso beating the dollar to the lowest
in almost four years.  Local investors, including pension funds and insurers and
excluding banks and some brokers, had an $11.6 billion long peso
position on Jan. 29, the lowest level since March 2009. The
currency was little changed at 471.48 per U.S. dollar at 1:07
p.m. in Santiago.  At the end of December, $12 billion of the $14 billion
total long peso position among local investors was  held by
pension funds . Local investors  have cut  their long peso position
by $4.9 billion since new rules on currency hedging for pension
funds went into effect Dec. 1.  The central bank gathers information on the market
positions of banks and five brokerages and publishes it daily,
on a two-day lag.  International investors in the Chilean peso forwards market
had a $1 billion net short peso position on Jan. 29, according
to central bank data. That is the lowest since September 2011.
International investors have cut their net short position by
$6.1 billion since the end of November.  A short position is a bet that a currency will fall. A net
short position occurs when the amount of bets against the
currency is greater than the amount wagered on an increase.
Foreign investors typically have a net short position because
the figure includes hedging by mining companies and others of
their long-term investments in  Chile .  To contact the reporter on this story:
