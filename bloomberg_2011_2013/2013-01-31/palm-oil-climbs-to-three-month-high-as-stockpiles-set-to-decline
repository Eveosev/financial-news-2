Palm oil  rallied to the highest
level in more than three months on speculation that Malaysian
stockpiles will drop from a record as a zero export tax lures
buyers away from  Indonesia , the world’s largest producer.  The contract for delivery in April gained 1.9 percent to
2,557 ringgit ($823) a metric ton on the  Malaysia  Derivatives
Exchange, the highest price at close for the most-active
contract since Oct. 25. Futures climbed 4.9 percent in January,
the biggest monthly advance since March.  Exports from Malaysia climbed 11 percent to 1.46 million
tons in January from a year earlier, according to data from
surveyor Intertek today. Malaysia will maintain the zero-tariff
policy for a second month in February to help clear stockpiles
of the oil used in foods and fuels, while Indonesia, the biggest
producer, will  raise  taxes on crude exports to 9 percent for
February from 7.5 percent, the Trade Ministry said Jan. 28.  “The zero export duty for crude palm oil should help
Malaysian shipments,” Alvin Tai, an analyst at OSK Investment
Bank Bhd., said by phone in  Kuala Lumpur . The pick-up in
exports, and an expected double-digit drop in production this
month, will help reduce the stockpiles, he said.  While Malaysia’s exports fell 7 percent in January compared
with December, the extent of the drop narrowed as the month
progressed, Intertek data showed. In the first 15 days, exports
were down 21 percent. Shipments dropped 6.4 percent to 1.42
million tons in January, according to Societe Generale de
Surveillance. Inventories reached a record 2.63 million tons at
the end of December, according to the Malaysian Palm Oil Board.
Output is typically lowest in January and February.  Refined palm oil for delivery in September gained 1.5
percent to 7,176  yuan  ($1,154) a ton on the  Dalian Commodity
Exchange , the highest close since Oct. 25.  Soybean oil  for
delivery in the same month rose 1 percent to 8,820 yuan a ton.  Soybeans for March delivery lost 0.6 percent to $14.7025 a
bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade, while soybean oil for
March delivery was little changed at 52.54 cents a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
