South Africa’s  consumer stocks index 
fell to the lowest in 16 weeks as companies including building-
materials distributor  Cashbuild Ltd. (CSB)  and  Shoprite Holdings Ltd. (SHP) ,
the country’s largest retailer, reported slowing sales growth.  The  FTSE/JSE Africa General Retailers Index (JGENR)  dropped as much
as 2.6 percent and traded 0.9 percent down at 61,236.42 by 11:20
a.m. in Johannesburg. That’s the lowest since Oct. 11 and
extends the gauge’s  decline this year  to 12 percent. Cashbuild
slid 4.2 percent after slumping 7.9 percent yesterday. Shoprite
retreated 2 percent while  JD Group Ltd. (JDG) , a furniture and
appliance retailer, sank 2.5 percent.  Sales at stores open for more than a year were one percent
lower in the three months through December than in the same
period a year earlier, Cashbuild said yesterday, leading to its
biggest share drop in four and a half years. Shoprite said
December sales grew 11 percent versus a 16 percent gain in the
corresponding month a year earlier in a Jan. 14 sales update.  “When stocks are trading on high multiples on peak
earnings, which is the case for many of our retailers, they need
continual positive news flow surprises to sustain those sort of
multiples,” Jeanine Womersley, a retail analyst at
Johannesburg-based Renaissance Capital, said by phone. “It’s
possible that we see a pick-up in the short term, but in the
medium term earnings estimates and valuations are still biased
downwards.”  The retailers’ index trades on 18 times reported earnings
 against  the 13.8 times earnings the benchmark FTSE/JSE All Share
Africa Index trades on.  The retail gauge’s 30-day historical  volatility , a measure
of stock swings, was at 25 for a second day, from 21.76 on Jan.
29. The FTSE/JSE Africa All Share Index’s 30-day volatility
gauge was at 8.75 from 8.74 previously. A higher reading means
an asset price can have bigger moves.  To contact the reporters on this story:
