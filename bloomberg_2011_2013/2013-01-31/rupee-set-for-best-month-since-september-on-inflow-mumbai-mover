India ’s rupee headed for its first
monthly gain since September as policy makers’ steps to boost
growth and improve public finances attracted capital.  The  Reserve Bank  of India lowered borrowing costs on Jan.
29 and said easing inflation will give some room to cut rates
further. The government allowed state refiners to adjust diesel
prices in January, aimed at curbing subsidies and tackling the
widest  budget deficit  among the largest emerging economies.
Global funds boosted holdings of Indian stocks and bonds by $4.2
billion this month, exchange data show.  “The outlook is positive and we are seeing the prospect of
inflows,” said Vikas Babu, a trader at Andhra Bank in Mumbai.
“Earlier, we had seen steps only from the government but now
the RBI also seems to be pro-growth,”  The rupee advanced 3.4 percent this month to 53.18 per
dollar as of 9:58 a.m. in Mumbai, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. It touched 53.0650 earlier, the strongest level since
Oct. 18. The currency, which rose 0.2 percent today, will
strengthen to 52.50 in “a couple of weeks,” according to
 Andhra Bank .  One-month implied volatility in the rupee, a gauge of
expected moves in the  exchange rate  used to price options, fell
35 basis points, or 0.35 percentage point, to 9.75 percent this
month. The rate was little changed today.  Bond Investment  Foreign investors poured $3.7 billion into Indian shares
this month through Jan. 29, surpassing the previous January
record set last year, while investment in rupee-denominated debt
rose to an  all-time high  of $33.5 billion on Jan. 28. The nation
raised the cap on global funds’ purchases in local-currency
bonds by $10 billion to $75 billion on Jan. 24.  The increase in the limit “should maintain capital flow
pressure on the rupee to appreciate,” analysts at Credit Suisse
Group AG, including Singapore-based Ray Farris, wrote in a
research report received today.  Three-month onshore rupee forwards traded at 54.17 per
dollar, compared with 54.41 yesterday, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Offshore non-deliverable contracts were
at 53.94 versus 54.14. Forwards are agreements to buy or sell
assets at a set price and date. Non-deliverable contracts are
settled in dollars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
