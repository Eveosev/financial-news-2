The maker of D-Con rat poison said
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s proposed ban on its
product would harm human health by limiting the ability of
citizens to curb rodent infestations.  “We will vigorously challenge EPA’s actions to ensure that
these effective and affordable rodent control products remain
available to consumers to protect their homes and families for
generations to come,” Hal Ambuter, director of regulatory and
government affairs for D-Con at  Reckitt Benckiser Group Plc (RB/) ,
said in an e-mail.  The  poisons  are used in millions of households and removing
them from store shelves will lead to a “substantial reduction”
in children being exposed to the rodent bait, the EPA said
yesterday. While there have been no known human deaths, the EPA
said it has been concerned about risks to children, pets and
wildlife for many years.  Reckitt Benckiser has 30 days to request a hearing before
an EPA judge to appeal the decision. The items can be sold by
retailers until the appeals process is completed.  D-Con’s products either don’t have protective bait stations
or contain rodenticides that pose risks to wildlife -- or both,
according to the EPA notice released yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
