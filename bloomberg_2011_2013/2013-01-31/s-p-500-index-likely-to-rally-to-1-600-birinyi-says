There is a more than 50 percent
chance the  Standard & Poor 500 Index (SPX)  will top 1,600 this year as
investors pour money into equity mutual funds and corporate
profits beat estimates, according to Laszlo Birinyi, president
of Birinyi Associates Inc.  The U.S. equity benchmark would have to rise 6.7 percent to
reach that level, exceeding its previous record of 1,565.15.
Birinyi, among the first to advise buying U.S. stocks before the
bull market began in 2009, purchased an unspecified amount of
$160  calls  on the  SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY)  that expire in
December, he said in a report to clients.  “We are positive,” Birinyi said in the report. “There
has been a reversal in the public’s attitude as they have begun
to buy mutual funds instead of sell them.”  About $22 billion flowed into stock funds around the world
in the week ended Jan. 9, the second-highest rate on record,
according to data compiled by research firm EPFR Global going
back to 1996. The  S&P 500  has risen 5.1 percent this month,
poised for the best start to a year since 1997. The index has
more than doubled from a 12-year low in 2009 as the  Federal
Reserve  increased bond purchases to keep  interest rates  low and
spur growth.  The U.S. equity benchmark is about 4 percent below its
record of 1,565.15 set in October 2007, while the Dow is less
than 2 percent from its all-time high.  Birinyi also cited strength in the U.S. economy and housing
market as reasons for being bullish. The S&P/Case-Shiller index
of property values increased 5.5 percent in November, the
biggest year-over-year gain since August 2006, according to data
released Jan. 29.  Gains will not be “straight up or easy,” Birinyi said,
citing concerns about  Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s last  profit  report. Shares of
the world’s most valuable company dropped 12 percent last week
after it posted the slowest profit growth since 2003.  To contact the reporter on this story:
