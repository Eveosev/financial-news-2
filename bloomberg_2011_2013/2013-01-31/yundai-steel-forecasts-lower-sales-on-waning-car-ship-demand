Hyundai Steel Co. (004020) , facing slumping
prices and demand from shipbuilders and carmakers, forecast
lower full-year sales after posting a 20 percent decline in
fourth-quarter profit.  Sales on a parent basis for 2013 may drop to 13.4 trillion
won ($12.3 billion) from 14.1 trillion won last year,  South
Korea ’s second-biggest steelmaker said today in a regulatory
filing.  Net income  at Incheon-based Hyundai Steel fell to 216.6
billion won in the three months ended Dec. 31. The average
profit of 13  analyst estimates  compiled by Bloomberg was 182.1
billion won.  China’s economic slowdown and  Europe ’s fiscal crisis have
reduced demand for steel used in houses, cars and ships,
crimping profits at global steelmakers. Bigger domestic rival
Posco this week forecast sales may fall this year after
reporting a worse-than-estimated fourth-quarter profit.  Hyundai Steel, an affiliate of the Hyundai Motor Group, has
fallen 5.6 percent this year in Seoul trading, underperforming a
1.8 percent loss in the local benchmark  Kospi (KOSPI)  index. The stock
rose 0.6 percent to close at 82,900 won, while the Kospi fell
0.1 percent. The results were announced after the stock market
closed.  Operating profit at the biggest construction-steel maker in
South Korea fell 46 percent to 163.1 billion won in the last
quarter, missing the 220.2 billion average of 17 analyst
estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Sales decreased 15 percent to
3.31 trillion won, while operating  margins  shrank to 6.2 percent
in 2012 from 8.4 percent in 2011, Hyundai Steel said today.  The average selling price of Hyundai’s products probably
dropped by 60,000 won per metric ton of steel in the fourth
quarter, Chris Kim, a steel analyst with Samsung Securities Co.,
said in a Jan. 14 report.  Hyundai’s earnings may rebound in the first and second
quarters should prices recover and shipments normalize,
according to Samsung’s Kim. The steelmaker today said it plans
to sell 16.7 million tons this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
