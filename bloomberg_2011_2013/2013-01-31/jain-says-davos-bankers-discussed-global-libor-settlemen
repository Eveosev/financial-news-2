Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  co-Chief Executive
Officer Anshu Jain said he discussed a possible global
settlement of alleged rigging of interbank lending rates with
fellow CEOs at the  World Economic Forum  in Davos this month.  “This came up in Davos, a number of bank CEOs were there
and we openly discussed whether this made sense for there to be
a process,” Jain said at a news conference in Frankfurt today.
“There were unofficial discussions, where we felt that if you
went back and looked at other industries that have gone through
an industry-wide settlement process, whether there is something
to be gained.”  Regulators from  Canada  to Switzerland are investigating
whether more than a dozen banks, including Deutsche Bank,
colluded to rig the rate. The lender said in July that an
internal investigation found misconduct by individual employees
of the bank related to Libor, though no wrongdoing by any
current or former members of the board.  “Pretty much all of us felt it was worth further
discussing it,” Jain said. “Whether that’s going to fructify
into something real in the next six to 12 months.”  Deutsche Bank probably won’t resolve all issues pertaining
to alleged rigging of interbank lending rates this year, said
Stephan Leithner, management board member for legal affairs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
