Singapore’s jobless rate fell to a
five-year low last quarter as companies hired more local workers
after the government tightened the inflow of foreign labor.  The seasonally adjusted  jobless rate  fell to 1.8 percent
from 1.9 percent in the third quarter, the Ministry of Manpower
said in a statement today. The median estimate of nine
economists surveyed by Bloomberg News was for a 1.9 percent
rate. The economy added 44,500 jobs last quarter, compared with
26,200 in the previous period.  Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong has raised foreign-worker
levies and salary thresholds as part of measures to reduce the
economy’s reliance on overseas labor after the island’s
population jumped by more than 1.1 million since mid-2004. The
clampdown has led to manpower shortages and rising job
vacancies, damping economic growth as companies seeking to
expand faced difficulty in hiring.  “Putting the rise in the job vacancy rate that we saw last
year plus the foreign manpower tightening that is currently in
place, it looks like we could expect the already tight
employment conditions to get a little bit tighter,” said  Selena Ling , a Singapore-based economist at Oversea-Chinese Banking
Corp. “It’s probably going to hit the services side harder.”  Job vacancies rose 4.4 percent in September from a year
earlier to 56,400, the Manpower Ministry said earlier this week.
Most job openings were in services industries, it said.  Companies created 129,600 new positions last year, and the
unemployment rate averaged 2 percent. Of the jobs added, more
than 54 percent, or 70,400, went to foreign workers. That is
lower than the 84,800 positions in 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
