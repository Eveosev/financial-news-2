Spain’s efforts to revive its broken
housing market will be endangered by new regulations on mortgage
lenders, according to Moody’s Investors Service.  The government said yesterday it wants to stop banks using
mortgages of more than 30 years as collateral in covered bonds
that package the loans. With the longer-maturity debt making up
10 percent of the mortgage market, the rules will restrict home
financing and hurt existing covered bonds, Moody’s said.  “It creates uncertainty for investors in 400 billion euros
($542 billion) of covered bonds,” said Jose De Leon, a Madrid-
based analyst at Moody’s. “It may end up making it harder for
banks to sell covered bonds so the flow of credit to families is
even more restrictive.”  Economy minister Luis de Guindos announced reforms for the
mortgage market this week after loan delinquencies rose to 3.5
percent at the end of September, the highest in at least six
years according to the Spanish Mortgage Association. They allow
borrowers to cancel debt if they pay 65 percent of an
outstanding mortgage over five years after a home is sold at
auction, or 80 percent in a 10-year period.  The new measures will reduce the maximum amount of covered
bonds that banks can issue, a Madrid-based spokesman at the
 Economy Ministry  said in an e-mailed response to questions. He
asked not be named in line with department policy.  To contact the reporters on this story:
