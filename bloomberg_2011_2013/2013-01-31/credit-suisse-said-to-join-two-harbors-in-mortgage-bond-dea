Credit Suisse Group AG (CS)  is seeking to
sell $407.4 million of securities tied to new jumbo U.S. home
loans without government backing in the third deal of the type
this year, according to three people familiar with the matter.  The bank is marketing the bonds, which it expects to
receive top ratings, to pay a spread of 0.97 percentage point
more than benchmark swaps, according to the people, who asked
not to be identified, citing a lack of authorization to speak
publicly.  Credit Suisse is teaming with  Two Harbors Investment Corp. (TWO) 
on the approximately $430 million securitization, the people
said, with the real-estate investment trust set to buy junior-
ranked debt created in the deal and provide some of the
underlying loans.  Drew Benson, a spokesman in  New York  for Credit Suisse, and
July Hugen of Minnetonka, Minnesota-based Two Harbors didnâ€™t
immediately return messages seeking comment on the deal.  To contact the reporters on this story:
