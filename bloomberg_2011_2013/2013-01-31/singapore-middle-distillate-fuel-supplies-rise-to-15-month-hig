Middle-distillate inventories in
 Singapore ,  Asia ’s largest oil-trading and storage center, rose
1.5 percent to the highest in more than 15 months, according to
a unit of the Ministry of Trade and Industry.  Onshore stockpiles including gasoil, or diesel, and
kerosene climbed 168,000 barrels to 11.5 million in the seven
days to yesterday,  International Enterprise Singapore  said today
in an e-mailed statement. That’s the highest since the week
ended Oct. 19, 2011.  Stockpiles of  residue fuels  including  fuel oil  and low-
sulfur waxy residue and excluding bitumen increased 3 million
barrels, or 17 percent, to 20.6 million, the ministry’s data
showed. That’s the biggest gain since April 25.  Light-distillate inventories including naphtha, gasoline
and reformate were down 300,000 barrels, or 2.7%, at 10.8
million, according to the data. Supplies were at a four-week
low.  The trade ministry surveys refiners, traders and storage
terminals on a voluntary basis. The results may exclude offshore
storage capacity, International Enterprise said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
