Formula One’s German Grand Prix will
go ahead as planned on July 7 after the Nuerburgring racetrack’s
management company reached a financial agreement with series
Chief Executive Officer  Bernie Ecclestone .  Nuerburgring Betriebsgesellschaft mbH declined to disclose
the terms in an e-mailed statement.  The  Nuerburgring , in a region that has racing heritage
dating back to the 1920s, alternates holding  Germany ’s annual
Formula One race with a circuit at Hockenheim. Both have had
financial difficulties since 2008, and have turned to local
authorities for assistance.  “I appreciate the Nuerburgring and its history very
much,” Ecclestone, 82, said in the statement. “Even today,
this Grand Prix circuit poses the highest demands on drivers and
teams. I am delighted the Nuerburgring will host the Formula One
race.”  There was a risk the German Grand Prix, a fixture on the
Formula One calendar for more than half a century, could have
dropped off this year, the  British Broadcasting Corp  reported
yesterday, citing Ecclestone.  To contact the reporters on this story:
