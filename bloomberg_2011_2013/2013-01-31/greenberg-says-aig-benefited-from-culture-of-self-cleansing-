Maurice “Hank” Greenberg, the
former chairman of American International Group Inc., said the
insurer benefited from “self-cleansing” that made
underperformers feel out of place at the company.  “The people who survived there had the same culture,”
Greenberg told Bloomberg Television’s Betty Liu on the “In the
Loop” program today. “If you couldn’t hack it at AIG, you
left.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
