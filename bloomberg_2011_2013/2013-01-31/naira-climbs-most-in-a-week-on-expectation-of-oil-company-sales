The naira gained against the dollar
on expectations of month-end foreign-currency sales by  oil
companies  operating in  Nigeria  to meet local expenses.  The currency of  Africa ’s largest oil producer rose 0.1
percent to 157.22 a dollar at 3:43 p.m. in Lagos, the commercial
capital, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The naira
weakened 0.7 percent this month, after gaining by the same
amount in December.  “The normal month-end sales by the oil majors will give
some support,” Sewa Wusu, head of research at Sterling Capital
Ltd., said by phone from Lagos today. The naira fell yesterday
after the central bank reduced foreign-exchange supply at
auction “and that was not anticipated,” he said.  The naira has gained from foreign-currency inflows to oil
companies investing in the country’s hydrocarbons and portfolio
funds, Central Bank of Nigeria Governor Lamido Sanusi said after
keeping the benchmark  interest rate  unchanged for the eighth
time on Jan. 21.  Oil companies periodically sell dollars to lenders to meet
local spending needs and are the second-biggest source of
foreign currency after the Abuja-based central bank’s twice-
weekly auctions. The regulator  sold $120 million  at a foreign
currency auction yesterday, the lowest in three auctions.  The yield on the country’s 16.39 percent domestic bonds due
January 2022 increased three basis points to 11.26 percent in
the secondary market yesterday.  Borrowing costs on Nigeria’s $500 million of Eurobonds due
January 2021 rose two basis points to 3.897 percent today.  Ghana ’s cedi fell 0.1 percent to 1.9035 a dollar in Accra,
the capital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
