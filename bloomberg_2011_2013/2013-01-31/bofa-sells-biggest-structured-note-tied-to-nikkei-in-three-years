Bank of America Corp.  sold $9.3
million of two-year notes tied to the  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average,
the biggest offering linked to the Japanese index in at least
three years.  The securities, issued Jan. 24, yield twice the gains of
the index up to 19.62 percent with protection against five
percent of losses and 95 percent of capital at risk, according
to a  prospectus  filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission. The bank distributed the notes for a 2 percent fee.  Banks have sold $27.6 million of notes linked to the
benchmark in six offerings since January 2010, when Bloomberg
began collective comprehensive data on U.S. structured notes.
The index  closed  at 11,138.66 today, a 7.2 percent rise since
the beginning of the year.  Matt Card, a spokesman for Bank of America, declined to
comment on the offering.  Banks create structured notes by packaging debt with
derivatives to offer customized bets to retail investors while
earning fees and raising money. Derivatives are contracts whose
value is derived from stocks, bonds, commodities and currencies,
or events such as changes in  interest rates  or the weather.  To contact the reporter on this story:
