Solar photovoltaic demand may rise
18 percent to 38.2 gigawatts in 2013, led by a doubling of sales
in  China , Maxim Group LLC analysts Aaron Chew and Francesco
Citro said today in a note to investors.  The uptick in demand, from an estimated 32.3 gigawatts in
2012, is driven by “the severe collapse in module prices since
2011,” a trend that may not reverse, the analysts wrote.  “We foresee little upside to profitability for the solar
manufacturers albeit a boon to downstream pure-plays” like
 Solarcity Corp. (SCTY) , they wrote. “Even if demand upside leads to
tight supply, we foresee no sustainable rise in pricing, as this
itself would inversely impair demand.”  Manufacturers including  Canadian Solar Inc. (CSIQ) , Yingli Green
Energy Holding Co. and  Trina Solar Ltd. (TSL)  all suffered from
narrowing margins last year as price declines wiped out profits.
The cost of multi-crystalline silicon modules declined more than
20 percent to 78 cents per watt last year, according to  data 
compiled by Bloomberg.  Maxim’s forecast for this year’s market compares with the
33.4 gigawatts predicted by Deutsche Bank AG, which said in a
Jan. 10 note that it expected 22 percent growth from its
estimate for 2012 of 27.4 gigawatts. Bloomberg New Energy
Finance predicts global installations of about 33.5 gigawatts in
2013, up from about 30 gigawatts in 2012.  Germany  will fall from the top spot this year for the first
time in five years, with demand more than cut in half to 3.8
gigawatts, according to Maxim. The U.S. market will rise about
40 percent to 4.6 gigawatts, while demand in  Japan  will more
than double to 4.2 gigawatts, the analysts predicted.  India  will probably be the fifth biggest market, with
demand rising more than a third to 1.9 gigawatts, and Italian
demand will more than halve to 1.7 gigawatts, according to the
forecast.  To contact the reporter on this story:
