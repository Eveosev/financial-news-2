Japan’s bonds rose, sending the
five-year yield back to the lowest on record, after demand
increased at an auction of two-year notes and amid speculation
the central bank will expand debt purchases.  Bonds gained for the first time in four sessions after data
showed Japan’s industrial production grew by less than forecast.
The  Bank of Japan (8301)  could add further stimulus if warranted,
Deputy Governor Hirohide Yamaguchi said today. The government
sold 2.49 trillion yen ($27 billion) of two-year notes,
attracting bids worth 10.13 times the amount on offer, higher
than 9.73 in the previous auction.  “The auction passed without any problem since the BOJ will
be buying two-year notes through its asset-purchase program,”
said Makoto Suzuki, a senior bond strategist in Tokyo at Okasan
Securities Co., one of the 24 primary dealers obliged to bid at
government debt sales.  The benchmark 10-year yield fell two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 0.75 percent as of 3:17 p.m. in Tokyo. The
0.8 percent security maturing in December 2022 added 0.18 yen to
100.459, according to  Japan  Bond Trading Co., the country’s
largest inter-dealer debt broker. Lead futures on the securities
rose 0.22 yen to 144.28.  The five-year rate slid 1 1/2 basis points to 0.14 percent,
matching the lowest on record reached on Jan. 22. Yields on 30-
year bonds declined 2 1/2 basis points to 1.98 percent.  The BOJ last week adopted the government’s requested 2
percent inflation target without a deadline and said it would
wait until 2014 to start open-ended asset purchases. Currently,
the bank buys securities such as government bonds maturing in
one to three years and exchange-traded funds through a fund
targeted to reach 76 trillion yen in assets in December 2013.  ‘Further Accommodation’  “It could be the case that further accommodation will be
pursued,” Yamaguchi, whose term ends in March, said in a speech
in Nagasaki.  Industrial production in Japan rose 2.5 percent last month
from November, the Trade Ministry said in  Tokyo  today. The
median estimate of economists in a Bloomberg News survey was for
a 4.1 percent gain.  The Federal Reserve said yesterday it will continue its
bond purchases as growth in the world’s largest economy
stagnated. Gross domestic product fell at a 0.1 percent annual
rate in the fourth quarter, weaker than any economist forecast
in a Bloomberg survey.  “There are some doubts cast on the overly optimistic
outlook for the U.S. economy” said Shuichi Ohsaki, a strategist
in Tokyo at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. “Sentiment around
bonds is improving as stocks fall and yen stabilizes.”  -- Editors: Rocky Swift, Jonathan Annells  To contact the reporters on this story:
