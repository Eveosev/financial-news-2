Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) ,  Europe ’s
biggest energy company, said investment will increase after
fourth-quarter profit missed analyst estimates on weaker U.S.
and Canadian fuel prices.  Excluding one-time items and inventory changes, profit was
$5.6 billion. That was below the $6.2 billion average estimate
of 11 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Net capital spending of
about $33 billion this year compares with $30 billion in 2012.  Higher costs of getting oil and gas to production are
offsetting gains from rising output and record Brent crude
prices. Chief Executive Officer  Peter Voser  is trying to appease
investors by raising the dividend in the first quarter, and he
expects to increase output to about 4 million barrels of oil
equivalent a day in 2017 from 3.3 million barrels last year.  “The 2013 capex is a negative surprise,” said Stuart Joyner, an analyst at Investec Securites Ltd. in  London .
“Spending is set to be higher, for longer.”  Net income rose 3 percent to $6.7 billion in the last three
months of 2012 from a year earlier. Full-year earnings fell 14
percent to $26.6 billion from 2011.  Shell expects to announce a dividend of 45 cents a share
for the first quarter of 2013, a 4.7 percent increase from the
fourth quarter’s 43 cents. Fourth-quarter production rose to 3.4
million barrels a day from 3.3 million a year earlier.  The shares fell 2.8 percent, the most in a year, to 2,241
pence in London. Shell is the first of the world’s biggest oil
companies to report fourth-quarter earnings.  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) 
and  Chevron Corp. (CVX)  give their results tomorrow.  BP Plc (BP/)  reports
Feb. 5.  Highest Ever  Brent crude prices were the highest ever on average last
year at $111.68 a barrel. At the same time, the average cost of
New York-traded West  Texas  Intermediate retreated to $94.15 a
barrel from $95.11. U.S. natural gas prices declined to $2.83
per unit, the lowest since 1999.  Profit in the unit that produces oil and gas slipped 14
percent in the fourth quarter from a year earlier. The refining
unit returned to profit after a loss a year ago. Sales of
liquefied natural gas rose 13 percent to 5.5 million tons.  Shell will raise exploration spending to $7 billion this
year from $6.4 billion in 2012. It expects to drill more than 40
high-potential wells in 18 basins as well as test 10 tight gas
and liquid-rich shale resources.  Costs Rise  “Costs are on the rise in some areas because clearly
investments are going up,” Voser said in an interview with
Bloomberg Television. “It’s never been as high as at the moment
in the industry,” though Shell’s costs are rising more slowly
than average, he said.  Prices received for liquids slipped 1 percent in the fourth
quarter from a year earlier, driven by a 19 percent drop in
Canadian synthetic crude prices. Global gas realizations climbed
3 percent from a year ago, with a 4 percent drop in the Americas
and a 3 percent gain elsewhere.  Canadian bitumen prices were about half those of Brent oil
in the quarter, Voser told a press conference in London. “So we
only got half of the revenues and that had some impact.”  Cash Flow  A year ago Voser forecast 50 percent higher operational
 cash flow  through 2015 on new projects. The Anglo-Dutch company,
which scaled back shale-gas drilling in the U.S. to focus on
oil, bought liquids-rich acreage in Texas for $1.9 billion from
 Chesapeake Energy Corp. (CHK)  in September.  Raising the dividend “shows the confidence in our plan,”
Voser said. “We’re on track to deliver.”  Shell had a setback in  Alaska  when a Kulluk drilling rig
broke free from its tugboat on Dec. 31 and ran aground on an
uninhabited island. The company has spent $4.5 billion and seven
years in pursuit of oil beneath the Chukchi and Beaufort seas in
the Arctic Circle.  Refining margins improved in the fourth quarter. BP’s
refining marker margin, a global indicator of profitability, was
$13.17 a barrel in the fourth quarter compared with $9.08 a year
earlier. Shell’s 2011 fourth-quarter profits were hampered by a
loss in refining.  To contact the reporter on this story:
