Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) ’s home page went
offline for about 49 minutes, leaving shoppers unable to call up
the main Web address, www.amazon.com.  The landing page of the world’s largest Internet retailer
was available to some customers today, Ty Rogers, a spokesman
for Seattle-based Amazon, said in an e-mailed statement. He
didn’t specify a reason for the disruption.  Efforts by computer and mobile-phone users in  San
Francisco , Chicago and New York to call up the website resulted
in a page that read only “Service Unavailable” at least as
early as 2:44 p.m. in New York.  Other parts of the site functioned properly, while the home
page remained unreachable, including links to specific pages
within the store and its cloud-computing services.  Amazon shares fell 2.7 percent to $265.50 at the close in
New York, a day after posting their biggest gain since Oct. 26,
following an earnings report that showed a jump in sales and a
wider operating margin in  North America . The stock jumped 45
percent in 2012.  Last month, Amazon apologized for a disruption at Amazon
Web Services, which provides computing power for other
companies. While that incident hindered  Netflix Inc. (NFLX)  customers
from watching movies on Dec. 24, it didn’t impact the main
shopping site.  To contact the reporters on this story:
