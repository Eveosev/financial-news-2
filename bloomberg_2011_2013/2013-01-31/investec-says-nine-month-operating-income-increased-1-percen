Investec Plc (INVP) , the owner of a bank
and money manager in  South Africa  and the U.K., said operating
income rose 1 percent in the nine months through December.  Operating profit before goodwill, acquired intangibles,
non-operating items and taxation as well as non-controlling
interests rose 5 percent from a year ago, the Johannesburg- and
London-based company said in a statement today without giving
details. Operating costs increased 4 percent in that period.  Asset management experienced net inflows as did the wealth
and investment unit, while the South African banking business
reported a “solid increase in operating profit in rand terms,”
the company said. The Australian banking unit performed
“significantly ahead of the prior period” as bad debts fell
and the U.K. operations “reported results behind the prior
period largely due to lower investment income earned,” it said.  Investec’s operations were hurt by the U.K.’s recession and
the European sovereign debt crisis. While the South African
economy slowed last year, it averted a recession and banks have
not needed government support. Investec has been focused on
boosting return on equity, eliminating duplication and taking on
more clients.  The  shares  dropped 0.7 percent to 65.90 rand as of 9:31
a.m. in Johannesburg trading.  To contact the reporter on this story:
