Lebanon’s Islamic militant group
Hezbollah “strongly” denounced  Israel ’s strike against its
ally  Syria  and called for widespread condemnation of the
“barbaric aggression.”  Iran-backed Hezbollah is “fully” supportive of Syria’s
leadership, army and people, the group said in a statement today
carried by the official  National News Agency . It said the attack
was part of Israel’s attempts to “prevent any Arab or Islamic
power from consolidating and improving its military and
technological capabilities.”  The precise location of yesterday’s air strike was unclear.
A Western official said the jets attacked Syrian trucks carrying
anti-aircraft missiles for Hezbollah while Syria said the target
was a defense research center in Jamraya, northwest of the
capital, Damascus.  The U.S., the European Union and Israel consider Hezbollah
to be a terrorist group.  To contact the reporter on this story:
