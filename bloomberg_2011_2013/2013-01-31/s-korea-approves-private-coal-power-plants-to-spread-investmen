South Korea granted approval for
 Samsung C&T Corp. (000830)  and three other private companies to build
eight coal-fired power plants as part of an energy plan that
spreads investment among state and private power generators.  The companies, including Tongyang Power Co., SK Engineering
& Construction Co. and a Dongbu Group unit, will build the
plants by 2027, the  Ministry of Knowledge Economy  said in an e-
mailed statement. Combined, the plants will generate 8,000
megawatts. Investment amounts weren’t revealed.  The approval is the first time in three decades that
private operators have been given the nod to build coal-fired
plants and is part of a road map outlining energy investments
for the next 15 years. The road map will be updated in the first
half of the year to reflect President-elect Park Geun Hye’s
nuclear power policies.  Park takes office Feb. 25, having pledged to focus on
nuclear safety. The 2010 energy plan called for the nation to
generate 49 percent of its electricity output from reactors in
2024, compared with 33 percent in 2011.  South Korea , which relies on imported oil for all its
supplies, has been trying to cut reliance on crude and diversify
energy sources to include renewables and other clean energies.  The nation is vulnerable to blackouts after the government
miscalculated demand when planning power plants over the last
decade. Some projects were either canceled or delayed because
South Korea caps electricity prices to control inflation.
Private coal plant operators sold out to  Korea Electric Power
Corp. (015760)  in 1982.  The plan released today aims to develop power generation
capacity by 2027 that will exceed demand by 22 percent.  Renewable Push  Asia ’s fourth-largest economy is trying to restrain the
growth in electricity consumption to an average of 2.2 percent
annually through 2027.  Under the plan released today,  state generators  will add
2,740 megawatts of coal-fired plants, the ministry said. Private
and state generators, including SK E&S Co. and Daewoo
Engineering & Construction Co., will also construct six more
liquefied natural gas-fired  power plants  with combined capacity
of 5,060 megawatts.  South Korea aims to have enough renewable energy facilities
to generate 32,020 megawatts, or 20 percent of overall power
generation, by 2027. That’s an increase from the 11.4 percent
target set in 2010 when the government mapped out its last
energy-supply plan, according to the statement.  Renewable-energy sources will account for 12 percent of
power supply by 2027, up from the 7 percent target set in 2010,
the ministry said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
