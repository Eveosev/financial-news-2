Goldman Sachs Group (GS)  Inc. picked
Raanan Agus to manage Liberty Harbor after the credit investment
unit’s Chief Investment Officer Gregg Felton quit this week,
ending a six-year tenure there.  Brendan McGovern and Sal Lentini will be the co-heads of
Liberty Harbor’s investment team, reporting to Agus, who is also
global co-head of Goldman Sachs Investment Partners, according
to an internal memo sent on Jan. 28. Andrea Raphael, a
spokeswoman for the New York-based bank, declined to comment.  McGovern was head of research and Lentini was head of
credit trading in the Liberty Harbor team, according to the
memo. Both were also senior portfolio managers. Agus will
continue to run GSIP, a hedge fund that handles client money,
with Ken Eberts, the firm said in the memo.  McGovern and Lentini were part of a 17-person team led by
Felton that Goldman Sachs hired in 2006 from defunct hedge fund
Amaranth Advisors LLC. Liberty Harbor, which is part of Goldman
Sachs’s asset management group, is a global multi-strategy fund
that seeks to profit from mispriced securities in credit
markets, according to the bank’s  website . Liberty Harbor manages
about $5 billion in assets, according to a fund prospectus.  Felton, 41, declined to comment on his plans. His departure
was previously reported by Hedge Fund Alert.  Felton managed Amaranth’s investments in debt markets
before the hedge fund collapsed in 2006 following wrong-way
wagers in energy markets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
