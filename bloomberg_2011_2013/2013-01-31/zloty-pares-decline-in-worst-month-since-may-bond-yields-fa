The zloty had its worst month since
May and yields on benchmark 10-year bonds increased the most in
16 months in January as  Poland ’s economic growth decelerated.  The zloty strengthened less than 0.1 percent to 4.1954 at
6:15 p.m. in Warsaw, paring its monthly slump to 2.8 percent,
the worst performance among the 10 emerging currencies in
 Europe , the Middle East and  Africa  after the South African rand.
The yield on 10-year government bonds fell three basis points,
or 0.03 percentage point, to 3.93 percent, up 19 basis points
this month in the biggest increase since September 2011.  The repricing gained pace after the Central Statistical
Office released data showing that December’s retail sales
slumped to the worst level since 2005, stoking bets on further
interest-rate cuts. A decline in German unemployment helped lift
markets today and suggested that economic growth in Poland’s
biggest trading partner was gathering pace.  “The German data added relief to the market and we see
much activity from local investors,” Adam Kruss, Warsaw-based
head of trading at Raiffeisen Bank Polska SA, said by phone.
“Investors are rearranging their positions on different
maturities, betting on future rate cuts.”  Non-resident holdings of Polish bonds jumped by 2.2 billion
zloty ($712 million) in December to a record 189.9 billion
zloty, and inflows of foreign capital accelerated in January,
 Piotr Marczak , head of the Finance Ministry’s public debt
department, said in an e-mailed statement today.  The Finance Ministry sold 300 million euros ($408 million)
of 20-year bearer bonds to German investors in a private
placement, Marczak said. The securities were priced to yield
3.359 percent, or 10 basis points less than existing euro-
denominated notes due in 11 years, the statement said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
