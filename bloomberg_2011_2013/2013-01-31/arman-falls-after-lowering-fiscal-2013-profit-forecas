Harman International Industries
Inc. (HAR) , a maker of car infotainment systems, fell the most in 17
months after forecasting 2013 profit would fall short of
analysts’ estimates because of the automotive slump in Europe.  The  shares  dropped 9.1 percent to $44.78 at the close in
 New York  for the biggest drop since August 2011. The shares rose
15 percent for the 12 months ended yesterday compared with 14
percent for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  Harman forecast fiscal 2013 profit of $2.70 to $2.90 a
share, according to a statement. That compared with $3.36, the
average of seven analysts’ estimates in a Bloomberg survey and
$3.67 to $3.92 a share in an Aug. 10 forecast. Harman said it
will cut 500 jobs and may sell or close a factory in  Europe ,
eliminating 500 more jobs. The company said the job cuts already
planned will reduce expenses $30 million to $35 million annually
starting in fiscal 2014.  “Rebalancing our workforce is a difficult, but necessary,
step that Harman is implementing to deliver improved financial
results through the European economic and automotive cycle
recovery,” Harman Chief Executive Officer Dinesh Paliwal said
in the statement. The European automotive market is in its worst
slump in 19 years.  The slowdown probably was driven by December production
cuts at European luxury-auto makers,  David Leiker , a Robert W.
Baird & Co. analyst in  Milwaukee , said in a research note today.
Leiker rates the shares outperform. Harman has said its gear is
in 80 percent of  luxury vehicles  sold.  Profit in the three months ended Dec. 31 was 59 cents a
share, down from 83 cents a year earlier. The average estimate
of seven analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was for a profit of 85
cents. Harman, based in Stamford, Connecticut, supplies
equipment that combines music, maps and other information in
automobiles.  To contact the reporter on this story:
