China’s  yuan  completed a monthly
advance on optimism growth in Asia’s largest economy is set to
quicken as manufacturing gathers momentum.  The official Purchasing Managers’ Index was 51 in January,
compared with 50.6 in December, according to the  median forecast 
in a Bloomberg survey before data due Feb. 1. That would be the
fourth month of expansion. Gross domestic product rose 7.9
percent in the fourth quarter from a year earlier, accelerating
for the first time in two years, a government report showed Jan.
18. The  Federal Reserve  said yesterday it will keep purchasing
securities at the rate of $85 billion a month, a policy that
boosts the supply of dollars.  “As  China’s economy  is set for stronger growth this year,
there’s more upside to the yuan,” said Stella Lee, president at
Success Wealth Management Ltd. in Hong Kong. “A continuation of
quantitative easing in the U.S. will retain funds in  emerging
markets , if not spurring more flows into the region.”  The yuan climbed 0.03 percent today to close at 6.2188 per
dollar in Shanghai, prices from the China Foreign Exchange Trade

by a maximum 1 percent.  In  Hong Kong ’s offshore market, the currency rose 0.02
percent to 6.2145 per dollar, extending this month’s gain to
0.11 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Twelve-
month non-deliverable yuan forwards slipped 0.1 percent today to
6.3115, and traded at a 1.5 percent discount to the onshore
exchange rate, the data show.  One-month implied volatility in the Chinese currency, a
