Banco BPI SA (BPI)  Chief Executive Officer
Fernando Ulrich said the Portuguese lender will keep a
controlling stake in Banco de Fomento Angola and add branches in
the African country.  “This is a success story for us that we are eager to
develop,” Ulrich said in a conference call with analysts today.
“I don’t intend to sell a single asset” in Angola.  Portugal’s fifth-biggest bank retained control of the unit
after selling a 49.9 percent holding to wireless-phone company
Unitel SA for $475 million in 2008. Angola, Africa’s second-
biggest oil producer, is luring foreign banks as its economy
booms. Gross domestic product is forecast to have grown more
than 8 percent in 2012, the International Monetary Fund said in
a report yesterday.  Ulrich said he was “very happy” with the other
shareholders in Banco de Fomento and planned to “gradually”
expand its 167 branches in Angola.  BPI yesterday posted net income of 249.1 million euros
($394 million) for 2012 compared with a loss of 285 million in
the previous year. Banco de Fomento accounted for 79.7 million
euros of BPI’s profit last year, BPI said in a regulatory
filing.  Standard Bank Group Ltd. (SBK) , Africa’s largest lender, said
last year that it won’t rule out acquisitions in Angola as it
seeks to become one of the top five banks in the country.  Only 22 percent of Angolans have access to banks and more
than two-thirds of the market is controlled by the five biggest
lenders, according to audit firm KPMG.  To contact the reporter on this story:
