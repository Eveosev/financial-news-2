Elizabeth Arden Inc. (RDEN)  fell the most
in four years after the maker of perfumes and cosmetics cut its
fiscal 2013 profit forecast, citing slower fragrance sales
during the holiday period.  The shares plunged 16 percent to $38.41 at the close in New
York for the biggest decline since January 2009. The stock
advanced 22 percent last year, while the Russell 2000 Index
gained 15 percent.  The company, which sells celebrity-branded scents for names
such as Justin Bieber and  Britney Spears , cited slower sales
during its fiscal second quarter at a mass retailer it didn’t
identify. The perfume maker, which got about 33 percent of
revenue from overseas in the most recent three-month period,
also pointed to international weakness.  “International net sales were impacted by lower-than-
expected inventory replenishment in our travel retail business
and weakness in  Greater China ,” Chief Executive Officer, Scott Beattie said in a statement.  Profit for the year will be $2.30 to $2.50 a share, the
Miramar, Florida-based company said. It had previously  forecast 
a range of $2.55 to $2.70 a share. Analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg estimated $2.66.  Second-quarter profit excluding acquisition-related
expenses and non-recurring charges was $1.58 a share, trailing
analysts’ average estimate of $1.64. Sales rose 8.8 percent to
$467.9 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
