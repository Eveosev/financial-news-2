Empresas Hites SA (HITES) , a Chilean
department store operator, led gains on the country’s benchmark
stock index this month as the gauge posted its biggest advance
since February 2012 amid a rally by retailers.  Hites rose 1.5 percent to 498.95 pesos today in Santiago,
capping a 22 percent surge in January. It was the  biggest
increase  on the Ipsa index, which climbed 7.5 percent in U.S.
dollar terms this month to outperform all stock gauges in the
Americas except  Argentina ’s, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  The Chilean economy grew in November at the fastest pace in
11 months, and wages rose three times more than inflation. The
higher salaries and low unemployment have contributed to more
retail spending, according to Juan Pablo Castillo, an analyst at
Santiago-based Banco Penta.  “The retail sector has performed really well,” Castillo
said in a telephone interview. “Investors are a little more
optimistic with respect to these retail companies.”  The country’s retail industry may grow as much as 6.5
percent this year, he said, citing estimates from the Santiago
Chamber of Commerce.  SACI Falabella (FALAB)  SA, a retailer that’s the country’s largest
publicly traded company, rose 11 percent this month to 5,477.50
pesos, while  Ripley Corp SA (RIPLEY) , another department store operator,
gained 12 percent to 509.99 pesos.  Cencosud SA (CENCOSUD) , a multi-brand
retailer, gained 13 percent in January, reaching 2,927.80 pesos.
Hites, Falabella, Ripley and Cencosud are all based in Santiago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
