Daiichi Sankyo Co. (4568) , the worst
performer on  Japan ’s Topix Pharmaceutical Index last year, said
nine-month profit almost tripled from a year earlier, when net
income was eroded by a provision to settle a legal dispute.  Profit was 51.5 billion yen ($567 million) for the nine
months ended Dec. 31, from 17.5 billion yen a year earlier.
Daiichi Sankyo still expects full-year profit of 50 billion yen,
the Tokyo-based drugmaker said in a statement today.  Daiichi Sankyo, which owns 64 percent stake of India’s
 Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd. (RBXY) , accounts for the Indian unit’s
earnings with a quarter lag. India’s biggest drugmaker is
scheduled to report quarterly earnings on Feb. 26.  Daiichi Sankyo rose 0.8 percent to 1,546 yen as of 1:05 p.m.
in Tokyo trading, while the benchmark Topix index declined 0.4
percent. The stock dropped 13 percent last year, while the 37-
member Topix Pharmaceutical Index gained 12 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
