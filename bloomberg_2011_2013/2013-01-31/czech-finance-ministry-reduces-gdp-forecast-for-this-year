The Czech Finance Ministry reduced
its economic-growth forecast for this year as a slower recovery
from a recession may complicate efforts to cut the budget
deficit.  The ministry forecasts gross domestic product to rise 0.1
percent in 2013, compared with its 0.7 percent estimate in
October, it said today in an e-mailed statement. The expansion
will accelerate to 1.4 percent in 2014, the Prague-based
ministry forecasts.  The Czech economy is suffering from weakening domestic
demand after the Cabinet cut investments and raised taxes to
trim the budget gap. The public-finance deficit will amount to
2.9 percent of GDP this year, in line with the governmentâ€™s
target, the Finance Ministry estimates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
