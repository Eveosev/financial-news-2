Cameron International Corp. (CAM) , the
second-largest oilfield-equipment maker in the U.S., rose after
orders for new gear almost doubled.  Cameron gained 4 percent to $63.31 at the close in New
York.  Cameron had $3.4 billion in orders for new gear, up 79
percent from a year earlier, the company said today in a
statement. Orders were projected to be $2.5 billion, J. David Anderson, an analyst at JP Morgan Chase & Co., wrote today in a
note to investors. The increase included orders for 21 new
blowout preventers, 400-ton fail-safe devices that attach to
wellheads on the ocean floor.  “Record backlog provides clarity toward revenues, while
maintenance spending by the offshore drillers is rising
dramatically, suggesting that after-market sales should remain
robust,” Scott Gruber, an analyst at Sanford Bernstein in New
York wrote today in a note to investors.  Tudor Pickering Holt & Co. analysts called the total new
orders a “monster” amount in today’s note to investors.  Today the company reported fourth-quarter net income,
excluding one-time items, of 95 cents per share, which  matched 
the average of 29 analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
