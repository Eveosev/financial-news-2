Total SA and Chevron Corp. both
failed to buy  North Sea  Forties crude for a third session as
they lowered their bids. There were no bids or offers for Urals
grade for a second day.  Refiners in  Asia  will trim imports of West African crude
for loading next month to the least in three months after  India 
reduced its purchases to the lowest since July.  China  and  Taiwan 
also pared purchases.  North Sea  Total sought to buy Forties at 40 cents a barrel more than
Dated Brent for loading Feb. 17 to Feb. 23, a Bloomberg survey
of traders and brokers monitoring the Platts pricing window
showed. Thatâ€™s 10 cents less than its equivalent bid yesterday
and compares with cargoes it bought on Jan. 22 at premiums of 35
cents and 40 cents.  Chevron was also unsuccessful with its bid at plus 40 cents
for a Feb. 21 to Feb. 23 cargo, according to the survey.  Reported crude trading typically occurs during the Platts
window, which ends at 4:30 p.m.  London  time. Forties loading in
10 to 25 days fell 4 cents to 65 cents a barrel more than Dated
Brent, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The differential
averaged 84 cents this month.  Brent for March settlement traded at $115.20 a barrel on
the ICE Futures  Europe  exchange in London at the close of the
window, compared with $114.71 in the previous session. The
front-month contract averaged $111.74 this month. The April
contract was at $114.20, a discount of $1 to March.  Mediterranean/Urals  There were no bids or offers for Urals for a second day,
the Platts survey showed. Gunvor Group Ltd. bid unsuccessfully
on Jan. 29 for 100,000 metric tons at a discount of 90 cents a
barrel to Dated Brent on a delivered basis to Rotterdam.  The Urals differential to Dated Brent in the Mediterranean
narrowed by 5 cents a barrel to minus 25 cents, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. It has averaged a discount of 41
cents in January. In northwest Europe, the  discount  dropped to
86 cents from 88 cents yesterday, the data showed. The spread
has averaged a discount of $1.04 in January.  Iraq will ship 41 cargoes of Basrah Light crude from the
Persian Gulf in February, according to a loading program
obtained by  Bloomberg News .  Russia will raise its standard oil export duty by 1.9
percent to $403.30 a ton, or about $55.02 a barrel, from Feb. 1,
according to an order signed by Prime Minister  Dmitry Medvedev .  OAO Surgutneftegas sold Urals to BP Plc, Repsol SA, and
China International United Petroleum & Chemical Corp., known as
Unipec, via a tender, according to two people with knowledge of
the matter.  BP bought a Feb. 19 to Feb. 20 cargo loading from Ust-Luga
while Repsol purchased one for Feb. 21 to Feb. 22 from the same
port, the people said, asking not to be identified because
information is confidential. Unipec were awarded a shipment
loading from Feb. 23 to Feb. 24 from Primorsk, they said. Each
lot is for 100,000 tons.  West Africa  Benchmark Nigerian Qua Iboe blend rose 5 cents to $2.37 a
barrel more than Dated Brent, which is the most since Jan. 8,
Bloomberg data show. It has averaged $2.26 in January.  Asia bought 50 cargoes totaling 1.68 million barrels a day
from  Angola ,  Nigeria ,  Equatorial Guinea , Republic of Congo,
Gabon,  Ghana  and  Democratic Republic  of Congo, according to a
survey of six traders and an analysis of loading plans obtained
by Bloomberg News. That compares with 1.8 million in January,
which was the most in eight months, the survey showed.  Indian Oil Corp. bought two cargoes of March loading West
African crude from Vitol Group via a tender, according to two
people with knowledge of the matter.  The refiner purchased Nigerian EA and Angolan Nemba grades,
the people said, asking not to be identified as the information
is confidential. Each consignment is 950,000 barrels, they said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
