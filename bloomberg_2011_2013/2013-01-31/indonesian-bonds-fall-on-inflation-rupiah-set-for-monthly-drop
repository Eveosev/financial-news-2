Indonesia ’s government bonds
declined, pushing the 10-year yield to the highest level in more
than a month, on concern inflation accelerated in January. The
rupiah is poised for its 11th monthly loss of the past year.  Consumer prices gained  4.47 percent  this month compared
with 4.3 percent in December, according to a Bloomberg news
survey before official data due tomorrow. The government should
try to increase subsidized fuel prices early this year, Trade
Minister  Gita Wirjawan  said last week, adding that President
Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono has met with the energy, finance and
economy ministers on the issue.  “The market’s attention has shifted to inflation,” said
Dian Ayu Yustina, a fixed-income analyst at PT Bank Danamon
Indonesia in Jakarta. “The yields on Indonesian bonds may begin
climbing to adjust for inflation, with the 10-year yield
reaching 5.5 percent.”  The yield on the 5.625 percent sovereign debt due May 2023
climbed three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 5.31
percent, the highest level since Dec. 12, according to closing
prices from the Inter Dealer Market Association. The benchmark
10-year yield rose 12 basis points in January, ending a four-
month decline.  The rupiah’s one-month non-deliverable forwards fell 0.1
percent today to 9,815 per dollar as of 4:33 p.m. in Jakarta,
data compiled by Bloomberg show. That’s 0.8 percent weaker than
the spot rate, which declined 0.7 percent to 9,740, prices from
local banks show.  A daily  fixing  used to settle the derivative contracts was
set at 9,799 today by the Association of Banks in  Singapore . The
rupiah’s onshore spot rate fell 1.1 percent in January,
following a 5.9 percent loss in 2012, and the forwards
strengthened 0.1 percent.  Indonesia will start hedging interest payments on overseas
debt against currency swings this year to prevent the  budget
deficit  from widening beyond estimates, Bambang Brodjonegoro,
head of fiscal policy, told reporters in Jakarta yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
