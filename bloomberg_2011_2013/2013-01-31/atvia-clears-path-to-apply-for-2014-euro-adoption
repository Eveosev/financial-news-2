Latvian lawmakers passed legislation
that allows the Baltic country to apply for euro-region
membership starting next year.  The legislature, based in the capital, Riga, voted 52-40
today to pass the euro-adoption law in its second and final
reading, according to its website.  Latvia, which exited a 7.5 billion-euro ($10.2 billion)
bailout last year, is vying to follow neighboring Estonia by
becoming the 18th euro-area member in 2014 and meets all of the
European Union’s criteria to join, Prime Minister Valdis Dombrovskis told Parliament today before the vote. The
government will submit its application to adopt the euro in
February or March, he said last week in an interview.  “The passing of the bill is a further positive for Latvian
credit, as the country is now one step close to euro accession
in 2014,” Mohammed Kazmi, a London-based analyst at Royal Bank
of Scotland Plc, said by e-mail. “We expect the government to
now push for an extraordinary convergence report from the
European Commission so that the process for joining the euro
zone can formally begin.”  The yield on Latvia’s $1.25 billion bond due 2020 rose 1
basis point after the vote to 3.024 percent as of 12:26 p.m. in
Riga.  To contact the reporter on this story:
