Paranapanema SA (PMAM3) ,  Brazil ’s biggest
copper smelter, named Edson Monteiro as interim Chief Executive
Officer as it seeks to reverse four straight quarters of losses.  Monteiro, currently Paranapanema’s vice president for
operations, will tomorrow take over from Luiz Antonio Ferraz Jr., who  resigned  last month, he said today in a telephone
interview. The company will still be looking for a permanent CEO
and doesn’t have an estimate when a replacement can be named,
Monteiro, a former Banco do Brasil SA executive, said.  “The plans and projects that were being executed continue
in the same direction,” he said from Santo Andre, Brazil. The
company will increasingly focus on its turnaround, he said.  Paranapanema more than  doubled  in the past six months, the
most among 68 stocks in the Bovespa Small Cap  index . The company
has cut costs, boosted production and sold assets. The company,
based in Dias D’Avila, Brazil, is investing about 1 billion
reais ($503 million) until 2014 to expand copper refining
capacity.  Paranapanema expects to produce as much as 265,000 metric
tons of refined copper in 2013, 40 percent more than 190,000
tons in 2012, after 74 days of stoppages last year, Monteiro,
58, said.  Paranapanema gained 2 percent to 5.20 reais at the close in
 Sao Paulo  today. The stock advanced 4.8 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
