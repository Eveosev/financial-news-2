U.S. stocks pared losses as
technology and telephone companies helped lead the market higher
following an earlier drop triggered by a bigger-than-forecast
increase in jobless claims and disappointing earnings.  JDS Uniphase Corp., Pitney Bowes Inc. and Mead Johnson
Nutrition Co. jumped more than 11 percent to lead gains in the
 S&P 500 .  The Standard & Poorâ€™s 500 Index was little changed at
1,501.37 as of 1:50 p.m. in  New York  after declining as much as
0.4 percent earlier. The gauge retreated from a five-year high
yesterday after the government said the economy unexpectedly
contracted last quarter.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
