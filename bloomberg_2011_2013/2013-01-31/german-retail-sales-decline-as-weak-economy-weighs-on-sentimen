German retail sales dropped more
than economists expected in December as uncertainty about the
economic outlook weighed on  consumer confidence .  Sales, adjusted for inflation and seasonal swings, plunged
1.7 percent from November, when they rose a revised 0.6 percent,
the Federal Statistics Office in Wiesbaden said today.
Economists forecast a 0.1 percent decline, according to the
median of 26 estimates in a Bloomberg News  survey . Sales fell
4.7 percent from a year earlier. In 2012, retail sales dropped
0.3 percent.  German unemployment may have increased for a 10th month in
January as a recession in the euro area, the country’s biggest
export market, weighed on foreign sales and company investment.
Consumer confidence declined at the end of last year and the
economy,  Europe ’s largest, probably contracted 0.5 percent in
the fourth quarter.  “December data are a setback, but confidence improved
since then and declining uncertainty about the debt crisis is
feeding into consumer sentiment,” said Gerd Hassel, an
economist at BHF Bank AG in  Frankfurt . “Disposable income will
rise this year amid stronger wage deals and as a result, private
consumption should pick up. We’re rather optimistic.”  German business confidence rose for a third month in
January and the Bundesbank said last week there are signs that
the economy is already rebounding from its slump. Sentiment
among investors jumped to the highest since May 2010 this month
and a gauge of activity in  service industries  rose to a 19-month
high.  To contact the reporter on this story:
