Germany ’s bonds rose, with 10-year
yields falling from the highest level in four months, as a
report showing retail sales dropped in December boosted demand
for the euro-region’s safest assets.  Benchmark 10-year bunds pared their biggest monthly loss
since June even as a separate report showed German unemployment
unexpectedly declined in January. Austrian and French bonds also
advanced. Portuguese 10-year securities slid for a second day
after data showed house prices in the euro area fell in the
third quarter. Spanish 10-year yields fell from the highest
level since December.  “Retail sales in Germany were quite poor this morning and
that’s fueling demand” for bunds, said Owen Callan, an analyst
at  Danske Bank A/S (DANSKE)  in Dublin. “With 10-year German yields
rising above 1.70 percent yesterday, some investors probably
think they are attractive levels, when you consider they were
around 1.40 percent at the start of the month.”  German 10-year yields fell three basis points, or 0.03
percentage point, to 1.68 percent at 4:45 p.m. London time. The
rate climbed to 1.73 percent yesterday, the highest level since
Sept. 17. The 1.5 percent security maturing in February 2023
gained 0.31, or 3.10 euros per 1,000-euro ($1,357) face amount,
to 98.38. The two-year note yield dropped two basis points to
0.27 percent.  Austria, Portugal  Volatility on Austrian bonds was the highest in euro-area
markets, followed by those of  Portugal  and Spain, according to
measures of 10-year or similar-maturity debt, the yield spread
between two- and 10-year securities, and credit-default swaps.  Austrian 10-year yields fell four basis points to 1.99
percent. The rate on similar-maturity French debt slid five
basis points to 2.26 percent.  German retail  sales  dropped 1.7 percent from November, when
they rose a revised 0.6 percent, the Federal Statistics Office
in Wiesbaden said today. The number of people out of work fell a
seasonally adjusted 16,000 to 2.92 million, the Nuremberg-based
Federal Labor Agency said today. Economists had predicted an
increase of 8,000, the median of 31 estimates in a Bloomberg
News survey showed.  The rate on Portugal’s 10-year bond climbed five basis
points to 6.13 percent, after jumping as much as 20 basis points
to 6.27 percent. Spanish 10-year bond yields fell four basis
points to 5.18 percent after rising to 5.31 percent, the highest
since Dec. 28.  The  extra yield , or spread, that investors charge to hold
Italian bonds instead of benchmark German bunds widened three
basis points, to 264 basis points. It reached 248 basis points
on Jan. 29, the lowest level since July 2011.  ‘Backing Off’  “People are backing off the lows we’ve seen in the last
few weeks because the rally’s gone so far,” said  Ciaran O’Hagan , head of European rates strategy at Societe Generale SA
in Paris. “Overall, the environment for the peripherals still
remains supportive.”  Euro-region house prices dropped 2.5 percent in the third
quarter from a year earlier and Spain’s annualized consumer
prices rose 2.8 percent in January, the slowest pace since
August, separate reports showed today.  German bonds have handed investors a loss of 2 percent this
month through yesterday, according to indexes compiled by
Bloomberg and the European Federation of Financial Analysts
Societies. Spanish bonds returned 1.8 percent and Italian
securities gained 1.5 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
