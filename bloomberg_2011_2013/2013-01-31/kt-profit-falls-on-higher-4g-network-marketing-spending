KT Corp. (030200) ,  South Korea ’s second-
largest mobile-phone carrier, reported a 55 percent drop in
fourth-quarter profit amid increased spending on fourth-
generation network technology and marketing.  Net income  fell to 93.6 billion won ($86 million) from
207.1 billion won a year earlier, the Seongnam, South Korea-
based company said in a regulatory filing today. That missed the
219.6 billion-won average of 14 analyst  estimates  compiled by
Bloomberg.  KT lagged behind rivals including bigger competitor  SK
Telecom Co. (017670)  with its deployment last year of 4G services based
on so-called Long Term Evolution technology, which allows faster
downloads and Web browsing. KT has been increasing spending to
lure more users to the services that generate higher profit
margins as companies including  Samsung Electronics Co. (005930)  and  Apple
Inc. (AAPL)  ramp up sales of LTE-enabled devices.  “Telecom operators are likely to continue to pursue
aggressive marketing policies to expand their long term
evolution subscriber base,” Fitch Ratings analyst Alvin Lim
said in a Jan. 23 report. Regulatory curbs on excessive
competition may limit marketing efforts this year, he said.  KT  shares  fell 1.4 percent to close at 36,600 won Thursday
in Seoul while the benchmark Kospi index declined 0.1 percent.  Operating profit, or sales excluding the cost of goods sold
and administrative expenses, fell 77 percent to 51 billion won,
KT said. Sales increased 3.6 percent to 6.2 trillion won.  Regulatory Fine  The Korea Communications Commission on Dec 24. imposed a
combined 11.9 billion won fine on SK Telecom, KT and  LG Uplus
Corp. (032640)  and ordered them to temporarily stop enrolling new
subscribers, for offering excessive subsidies to their
smartphone users.  KT’s subscriber acquisition will be temporarily stopped for
20 days from Feb. 22 while it was fined 2.85 billion won.  Marketing costs increased 18 percent in the fourth quarter
to 635 billion won from a year earlier, the company said today.  KT is targeting 2013 sales of 25 trillion won, compared
with 23.8 trillion won last year, it said. It also set a capital
outlay target of 3.5 trillion won for this year, from 3.7
trillion won spent in 2012.  KT introduced Apple’s iPhone in South Korea in November
2009. It has been selling the latest iPhone 5 device running on
the 4G network technology since December in the Korean market.  Samsung’s Galaxy S III, introduced in May, and its Galaxy
Note II phone-tablet device, introduced September, also support
the 4G technology.  To contact the reporter on this story:
