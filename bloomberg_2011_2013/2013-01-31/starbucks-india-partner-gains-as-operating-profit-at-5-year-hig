Tata Global Beverages Ltd. (TGBL) ,
 Starbucks Corp. (SBUX) ’s Indian partner, gained the most in two months
after reporting the highest operating profit in five years.  Profit from operations before other income, finance costs
and exceptional items rose 14 percent to 1.79 billion rupees
($33.6 million) in the three months ended Dec. 31, compared with
1.59 billion rupees a year earlier. Group net income rose 25
percent to 802.6 million rupees, falling short of the average
1.08 billion rupee estimate of six analysts.  The  shares  rose 3.8 percent to 149.35 rupees at the close
in Mumbai, the most since Nov. 15. The stock rallied 78 percent
last year,  compared  with the 26 percent gain in the benchmark
BSE  India  Sensitive Index.  “The operating profit has been better than what the street
had estimated,” Srinivasan Viswanathan, an analyst at Angel
Broking Ltd., said in an interview today. “The net profit has
fallen due to higher taxes in the quarter.” Viswanathan has a
neutral rating on the stock.  The company paid 621.7 million rupees in taxes last
quarter, compared with 574 million rupees a year earlier.  Tata Global got about 70 percent of its group revenue from
 outside  India in the year ended March 31, according to  data 
compiled by Bloomberg. Tea accounted for 72 percent of total
sales, while coffee contributed 27 percent.  Starbucks announced an equal joint venture with Tata Global
last year and opened its first store in the country in Mumbai in
October.  To contact the reporter on this story:
