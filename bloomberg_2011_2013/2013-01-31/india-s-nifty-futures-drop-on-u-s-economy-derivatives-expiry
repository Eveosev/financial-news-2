Indian (SENSEX)  stocks fell, paring a third
monthly gain for the benchmark index, amid concerns the recent
rally to a two-year high has made valuations expensive.  The BSE India Sensitive Index, or Sensex, slid 0.5 percent
to 19,898.94, according to preliminary closing prices at 3:30
p.m. in Mumbai. Volumes on the gauge were 29 percent higher than
the 30-day average.  Reliance Industries Ltd. (RIL) , the owner of the
world’s largest refining complex, dropped 1.4 percent. Tata
Power Co., the nation’s largest non-state-run generator, sank
2.4 percent.  ICICI Bank Ltd. (ICICIBC) , the biggest private lender, fell
even as earnings beat estimates.  Traders rolled over fewer contracts in the  S&P CNX Nifty
Index (NIFTY)  futures this month amid concern over stock valuations.
Open interest, or the number of outstanding contracts in Nifty
index futures, totaled 450,193 at 3:30 p.m. That compares with
550,713 on Dec. 27, when the December series expired, the data
show. Derivative contracts in India expire on the last Thursday
of each month.  The Sensex trades at 15.8 times  estimated earnings , the
highest since February 2012, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
That compares with a multiple of 11 times for the MSCI  Emerging
Markets  Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
