Oil fell for the first time in four
days as  claims  for U.S. unemployment benefits increased more
than forecast, reducing optimism that a growing economy will
boost fuel demand.  Prices trimmed the biggest monthly gain since August after
initial jobless claims rose to 368,000 last week, exceeding the
median forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg, and as a
U.S. consumer comfort index slipped for a fourth week. Oil
settled at a four-month high yesterday on speculation that
stronger economic growth would boost demand.  “Sentiment is a little bit ahead of what the data is
actually bearing out,” said Jacob Correll, a Louisville,
Kentucky-based analyst at Summit Energy Inc., which manages more
than $20 billion in companies’ annual energy spending. “It’s
tough to sustain the upward move until we start seeing better,
concrete data.”  West  Texas  Intermediate for March delivery slid 45 cents,
or 0.5 percent, to settle at $97.49 a barrel on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange . Futures rose to $97.94 yesterday, the
highest close since Sept. 14. Prices gained 6.2 percent in
January, a third monthly increase. Trading was 30 percent above
the 100-day average for the time of day at 3:03 p.m.  Brent for March settlement rose 65 cents, or 0.6 percent,
to $115.55 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe
exchange. Trading was 0.2 percent below the 100-day average. The
futures advanced 4 percent in January.  Seaway Pipeline  Brent’s  premium  to WTI widened to $18.06 from yesterday’s
$16.96, closing above $18 for the first time since Jan. 10. The
spread grew after  Enterprise Product Partners LP (EPD)  said the Seaway
pipeline, which ships oil from Cushing,  Oklahoma , the delivery
point for WTI futures, to the  Gulf Coast , will have limitations
at its terminus in Texas until a new pipeline lateral is
finished in late 2013.  WTI’s drop came after the relative-strength index of front-
month futures rose to 74.5 yesterday. RSI readings above 70
suggest prices will decrease, while figures below 30 can be buy
signals. The index was above 70 today.  This month’s rally of  oil prices  “seems to be predicated
more on expectations of economic growth in the future and every
time we get a bit of cold water on that idea, the market has a
tendency to experience some profit taking,” said  Gene McGillian , an analyst and broker at Tradition Energy in
 Stamford ,  Connecticut . “That’s what we are having today.”  Jobless Claims  The jobless claims rose 38,000 in the week ended Jan. 26,
the most since Nov. 10, the Labor Department said. The number of
people who continue to collect jobless benefits climbed by
22,000 to 3.2 million in the week ended Jan. 19.  The Labor Department, scheduled to release payroll data
tomorrow, may report a 165,000 increase in January employment,
according to a Bloomberg survey. The jobless rate held at 7.8
percent, the survey showed.  U.S. consumer comfort declined as Americans’ outlook on
spending soured. The Bloomberg Consumer Comfort Index dropped to
minus 37.5 in the period ended Jan. 27, the lowest reading since
October, from minus 36.4 in the prior week. The measure’s
buying-climate gauge decreased to a four-month low.  The  Federal Open Market Committee  said in a statement
yesterday that economic growth, while slowed by “transitory
factors,” faces risks even after strains in global financial
markets have eased.  “There’s been a lot of enthusiasm about the economy but
now people are having second thoughts, at least for today,”
said  Michael Lynch , president of Strategic Energy & Economic
Research in Winchester,  Massachusetts . “That’s pushing the
price down a bit.”  Oil Supply  U.S.  crude inventories  increased 5.95 million barrels in
the week ended Jan. 25 to 369.1 million, the Energy Information
Administration, the Energy Department’s statistics arm, reported
yesterday. Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg expected a gain of 2.5
million.  “There is still a lot of fundamental weakness in oil,”
Correll said. “You see the big stock build in the U.S., and
demand is still pretty low.”  Total petroleum  demand  fell 0.3 percent to 18.3 million
barrels a day in the four weeks ended Jan. 25, the lowest level
since the week ended March 30, the EIA reported. The U.S is the
world’s biggest oil-consuming country.  Electronic trading volume on the Nymex was 586,624
contracts as of 3:04 p.m. It totaled 501,214 contracts
yesterday, almost matching the three-month average of 501,287.
Open interest was 1.57 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
