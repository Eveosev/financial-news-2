Gasoline retreated on speculation
that prices rose too fast in the longest rally since July 2009
and as oil fell on concern that a rise in U.S. jobless claims
signals weaker economic growth and stagnant fuel demand.  Futures declined for the first time in 11 days, after
jumping 12 percent since Jan. 15 as refinery repairs and a
pending plant closing may reduce East Coast supplies. Crude
declined after the Labor Department reported an increase in
 unemployment claims  for last week. Gasoline demand is 0.6
percent below the five-year average, government data show.  “The 10-day rally factored in the offline production we’re
expecting to see in the coming months and now it might be
overextended,” said  Gene McGillian , an analyst and broker at
Tradition Energy in  Stamford ,  Connecticut . “Now we need to see
that coupled with higher demand to push higher.”  Gasoline for February delivery fell 4.87 cents, or 1.6
percent, to $2.99 a gallon at 10:26 a.m. on the New York
Mercantile Exchange.  Volume was 71 percent above the 100-day average for the
time of day. The more actively traded March gasoline declined
3.68 cents to $2.9964 a gallon. February gasoline and heating
oil contracts will expire at the end of floor trading today.  Prices are up 6.3 percent this month, headed for the
biggest monthly increase since September. Gasoline is the
fourth-best performer on the Standard & Poor’s  GSCI commodity
index  this month, after cotton, nickel and gasoil.  The gasoline crack spread, based on March contracts,
slipped 71 cents to $28.74 a barrel after reaching the highest
level since October.  Crude Declines  Futures also fell today as March crude on the Nymex
declined 79 cents to $97.15 a barrel after the jobs report and
as crude inventories rose by 5.9 million barrels to 369.1
million, according to Energy Information Administration data.  “Crude is under pressure as we have a lot of crude
inventories,” said  Andy Lipow , president of Lipow Oil
Associates LLC in Houston. “The weekly jobs report showed a
pretty significant increase in unemployment claims.”  Total U.S.  gasoline inventories  fell 956,000 barrels to
232.3 million barrels in the seven days ended Jan. 25, according
to EIA data. Supplies in PADD 1 increased 1.24 million barrels
to 55.2 million as imports to the region rose 47 percent to
609,000 barrels a day, the most since the week ended Sept. 7.  Philadelphia Energy Solutions began shutting the Girard
Point section of its plant yesterday, the largest near the New
York trading hub, for 60 days of work. A fluid catalytic cracker
at  Delta Airlines Inc. (DAL) ’s Trainer,  Pennsylvania , refinery has
been shut for repairs since December.  Port Reading  Hess Corp. said the 70,000-barrel-a-day Port Reading
refinery in New Jersey will be shut because it has lost money in
two of the past three years.  “Cooler heads are prevailing today,” said Phil Flynn,
senior market analyst at Price Futures Group in  Chicago . “If
supplies are tight, why did they rise in the  New York  Harbor?”  Heating oil for February delivery fell 0.97 cent, or 0.3
percent, to $3.1076 a gallon, after settling yesterday at the
highest level since Oct. 19. Volume was 4 percent below the 100-
day average for the time of day. Futures have risen 2.1 percent
this month, the largest increase since August.  The more actively traded March contract declined 1.16 cents
to $3.0971 a gallon.  The  retail price  for regular gasoline, averaged nationwide,
rose 2.9 cents to $3.423 a gallon, the highest level since Nov.
25, AAA said today on its website. Prices at the pump have
climbed for 14 straight days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
