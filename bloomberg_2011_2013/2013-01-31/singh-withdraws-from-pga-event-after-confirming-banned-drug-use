Vijay Singh  withdrew from the U.S.
PGA Tour’s Phoenix Open today after saying he used deer antler
spray, which contains substances banned by the world’s top golf
circuit.  Singh, 49, cited a back injury for his withdrawal, the tour
said on its website. The tournament’s par-3 16th hole is known
for its boisterous fans, who often cheer or heckle players while
on the tee.  Singh’s acknowledgment followed a Sports Illustrated
article alleging that the golfer and Baltimore Ravens linebacker
 Ray Lewis  used the product. Lewis denied the allegation
yesterday at a news conference in New Orleans, where the Ravens
are preparing to meet the  San Francisco 49ers  in the National
Football League’s Super Bowl.  Singh said he was unaware that the spray contained banned
substances.  “When I first received the product, I reviewed the list of
ingredients and did not see any prohibited substances,” Singh,
49, said in a statement released yesterday.  Deer antler spray contains IGF-1, a substance naturally
produced by the human body that’s related to growth hormone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
