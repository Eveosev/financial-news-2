The Canadian Dollar fell against its
U.S. counterpart before a report projected to show growth in the
Canadian economy picked up slightly in November.  The currency declined against the majority of its most-
traded peers after a report showed German retail sales fell more
than economists predicted last month, damping demand for the 17-
nation euro.  Canada ’s gross domestic product is forecast to grow
by 0.2 percent in November, up from 0.1 percent the month
before, according to a survey of 24 economists by Bloomberg.  “We’re waiting for GDP and Canadian data, but also there
is a feeling of less risk appetite in the global economy,” said
Jane Foley, senior currency strategist at Rabobank International
by phone from  London . “I think we’d have to see some properly
weak economic data to really chase dollar/Canada significantly
higher from these sorts of levels. So the poorer risk appetite
weighs against Canada, but at the same time I think if we do see
a decent GDP report this afternoon we could see some buyers
stepping in for the Canadian dollar.”  The loonie, as the Canadian currency is known for the image
of aquatic bird on the C$1 coin, rose 0.1 percent to C$1.0024
per  U.S. dollar  at 7:45 a.m. in Toronto. One loonie is worth
99.77 cents U.S.  Retail sales  in  Germany ,  Europe ’s largest economy, adjusted
for inflation and seasonal swings, dropped 1.7 percent from
November, when they rose a revised 0.6 percent, Germany’s
Federal Statistics Office in Wiesbaden said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
