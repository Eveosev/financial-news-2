The Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries will raise shipments through mid-February as
a winter demand peak in the northern hemisphere approaches,
according to tanker tracker Oil Movements.  The group that supplies about 40 percent of the world’s oil
will export 23.6 million barrels a day in the four weeks to Feb.
16, up 100,000 barrels, or 0.4 percent, from the previous
period, the researcher said today in an e-mailed report. Those
figures exclude  Angola  and  Ecuador .  “Numbers are going up, but it’s a modest increase, and the
peak will also be modest,” Roy Mason, the company’s founder,
said by phone from Halifax,  England .  Shipments will continue to rise at a similar pace for
another two weeks, until late-February when seasonal demand
starts to decline, he said.  Middle East shipments will increase 0.6 percent to 17.2
million barrels a day in the period, compared with 17.1 million
in the four weeks to Jan. 19, according to Oil Movements. That
figure includes non-OPEC members Oman and Yemen.  Crude on board tankers will average 466.1 million barrels,
down 1.8 percent on the previous period, the data show. Oil
Movements calculates the volumes by tallying tanker bookings.
Its figures exclude crude held on vessels for storage.  OPEC comprises  Algeria , Angola, Ecuador, Iran, Iraq,
 Kuwait , Libya, Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab
Emirates and Venezuela. The organization is next scheduled to
meet in May.  To contact the reporter on this story:
