United Co. Rusal (486) , the worldâ€™s
largest aluminum producer, said it reached an agreement with
banks to borrow as much as $400 million.  The company arranged the multi-currency credit facility
with banks including ING Bank NV and Bank of China Ltd., Rusal
said today in a statement. Rusal in early February plans to
prepay the scheduled amortizations of principal due for the
third and fourth quarters on $4.75 billion of loans, the company
said.  Rusal restructured $17 billion of debt in 2009 and
refinanced loans in 2011. The company last year agreed to
covenant holidays with lenders on $4.75 billion and started to
exercise the waiver from the first quarter of 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
