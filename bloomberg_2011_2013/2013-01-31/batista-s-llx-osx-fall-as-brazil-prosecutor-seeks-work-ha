  LLX Logistica SA (LLXL3) , the Brazilian
port developer of billionaire  Eike Batista , fell after a Brazil
prosecutor sued to suspend works of the company’s Acu Port
complex.  LLX  declined  1 percent to 2.23 reais at the close in Sao
Paulo, the lowest since Dec. 19.  OSX Brasil SA (OSXB3) , Batista’s unit
that is building a shipyard at Acu, fell 9 percent, its lowest
close since Dec. 10.  Public Prosecutor Eduardo Campos de Oliveira, from Rio
state’s Campos dos Goytacazes, entered an action against LLX,
OSX and EBX Group Co., the holding for most of Batista’s assets,
requesting the suspension of works at the Acu Port complex,
according to an e-mailed statement today. Construction at Acu
produced “evident environmental damage” to the wildlife of the
region, the prosecutor said in the statement, proposing a fine
of 100,000 reais ($50,259) a day if the suspension request is
not heeded.  An e-mail sent by Bloomberg news to LLX and OSX’s press
offices in Rio seeking comment wasn’t immediately answered. EBX
didn’t reply to an e-mail seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
