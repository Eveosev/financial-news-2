Genting Singapore Plc. (GENS) , Asia’s
second biggest casino operator by market value, rose the most in
six months in Singapore trading after competitor  Las Vegas Sands
Corp. (LVS)  reported gains in its local VIP business.  Genting rose 5.8 percent, the most since July 30, to close
at S$1.55. The benchmark Straits Times Index dropped 0.1
percent.  Rolling chip volume, an indicator of activity in the VIP
rooms that cater to high-stake gamblers, rose 53 percent to
$16.5 billion at the Marina Bay casino in Singapore, Sands said
in its fourth-quarter earnings report. The Las Vegas company
reported an an 11 percent drop in overall Singapore revenue, a
smaller decline than a 21 percent fall in the prior three
months.  Investors are more optimistic about Genting because VIP
volume increased “quite a bit” at Las Vegas Sands, Gabriel Chan, a Hong Kong-based analyst at Credit Suisse Group AG said
via phone today.  Las Vegas Sands closed 0.94 percent higher at $51.56 in New
York trading yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
