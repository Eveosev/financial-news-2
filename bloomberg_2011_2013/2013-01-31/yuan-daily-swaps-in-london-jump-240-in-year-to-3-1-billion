Trading of yuan-currency swaps from
 London  jumped 240 percent in the first half of 2012 from a year
earlier to $3.1 billion a day as the offshore market for  China ’s
currency expands, the  City of London  Corp. said.  “Transaction volumes in London are growing strongly which
reflects a growing confidence in London as a center of  renminbi 
business,” Mark Boleat, policy chairman for the City of London
Corp., said in an e-mailed statement today.  Daily spot foreign-exchange trading increased 150 percent
to $1.7 billion year-on-year, according to the statement. Trade-
related services provided by London banks such as import-export
financing rose almost five-fold to 2.2 billion yuan ($350
million).  U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne is pushing
for London to become an offshore center for  yuan  trading to
deepen links with the world’s second-largest economy. The Bank
of England is ready “in principle” for a currency-swap
agreement with the  People’s Bank of China , Chief Cashier Chris Salmon said Jan. 25.  Cross-border trading of yuan has expanded four-fold since
August 2010 to almost 200 billion yuan in October last year,
Euroclear Bank SA said in a statement last month, citing the
Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s figures.  To contact the reporter on this story:
