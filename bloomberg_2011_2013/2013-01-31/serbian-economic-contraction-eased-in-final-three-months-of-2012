Serbia ’s economy shrank 1.5 percent
in the fourth quarter of 2012 from a year earlier, bringing the
full-year contraction to an estimated 1.7 percent.  The decline follows three quarters of falling economic
output in a year when agriculture contracted 17.5 percent, the
 national statistics office  in Belgrade said today in a
preliminary estimate. GDP fell 2.5 percent in the third quarter,
after a 0.6 percent contraction in the second quarter and a 2.3
percent drop in the first three months.  The full-year estimate compares with a Dec. 28 forecast of
a 1.9 percent drop, Andra Milojic, deputy general manager of the
statistics office, told reporters in Belgrade.  Premier  Ivica Dacic ’s Cabinet, in office since July, has
pushed through a mix of fiscal consolidation and economic
stimulus to restore order to public finances while encouraging
cheaper lending to companies to boost growth and jobs.  They see the economy, in its second recession in three
years, expanding 2 percent in 2013 as Italy’s  Fiat SpA (F)  steps up
production at its car plant in Serbia and the  NIS (NIIS)  oil monopoly
expands exports from an upgraded unit near Belgrade.  To contact the reporters on this story:
