Formula One’s German Grand Prix will
go ahead as planned on July 7 after the Nuerburgring racetrack’s
management company reached a commercial agreement with series
CEO  Bernie Ecclestone .  Nuerburgring Betriebsgesellschaft mbH declined to disclose
the terms of the agreement in an e-mailed statement.  There was a risk that the German Grand Prix, a fixture on
the Formula One calendar for half a century, could have dropped
off the schedule, the British Broadcasting Corp. reported
yesterday.  The Nuerburgring alternates holding  Germany ’s annual
Formula One race with a circuit at Hockenheim. Both racetracks
have had financial difficulties since 2008, and have turned to
local authorities for assistance.  “I appreciate the Nuerburgring and its history very
much,” Ecclestone was quoted as saying in the statement. “Even
today, this grand prix circuit poses the highest demands on
drivers and teams.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
