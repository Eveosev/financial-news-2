Banco Santander Brasil SA, the
Brazilian unit of  Spain ’s biggest lender, fell to an eight-week
low after reporting an increase in loan delinquencies.  Shares fell 1.2 percent to 14.36 reais at 12:33 p.m. in Sao
Paulo after earlier dropping to 14.06 reais, the lowest intraday
price since Dec. 6. The benchmark Bovespa index rose 0.3
percent.  Sao Paulo-based Santander Brasil said today that its 90-day
loan default rate rose to 5.5 percent in 2012 from 4.5 percent
in the previous year. Parent  Banco Santander SA (SAN)  posted a fourth-
quarter profit that trailed analysts’ estimates as it set aside
money for further loan losses in its home market.  “Despite posting a slight recovery in the loan growth,
good fee income from its acquiring business, and cost control,
Santander’s asset quality/provisioning dynamics make for weak
fourth quarter results,” Votorantim Corretora analysts
including Renato Schuetz wrote today in an e-mailed note.  Santander Brasil has dropped 11 percent in the past year
while the Bovespa slid 5.7 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
