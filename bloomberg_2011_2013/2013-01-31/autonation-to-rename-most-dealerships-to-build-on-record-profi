AutoNation Inc. (AN) , the largest U.S.
retailer of new cars and trucks, plans to rename its mass market
brand franchises in the first half of this year after posting
record profit for 2012.  The dealership group’s 210 non-luxury domestic and import
franchises will use the AutoNation moniker beginning tomorrow in
south Florida, Chief Executive Officer Mike Jackson said in an
interview. The changes affect 80 percent of AutoNation’s
franchises, giving them names such as AutoNation Chevrolet.
Premium-brand stores such as those selling  Bayerische Motoren
Werke AG (BMW) ’s BMW brand aren’t included.  AutoNation will become the biggest dealership network to
operate under one brand in an industry that pioneered the U.S.
franchise system, beginning with  General Motors Co. (GM) ’s
predecessor more than a century ago.  “This hasn’t been done before at this size and scale,”
Mike Maroone, chief operating officer of Fort Lauderdale,
Florida-based AutoNation, said yesterday in a telephone
interview. Jackson, 63, said his discussions with Maroone about
a coast-to-coast brand strategy for AutoNation date back to
their first meeting, arranged by founder Wayne Huizenga, as
Jackson prepared to join the company in 1999.  AutoNation today said fourth-quarter net income climbed to
$83.2 million, or 67 cents a share, from $69.4 million a year
earlier. Profit beat the 64-cent average  estimate  of 13 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg and boosted adjusted earnings per share to
$2.54 for all of 2012, setting records for both the fourth
quarter and full year.  Sales Climb  U.S. auto dealerships last year benefited from a 13 percent
increase in new light-vehicle sales, the biggest annual gain
since 1984, according to researcher Autodata Corp. AutoNation’s
new-vehicle retail sales outpaced that growth, rising 20 percent
to 267,810.  AutoNation rose 8.4 percent to $48.50 at the close in New
York, its biggest one-day gain since Feb. 3, 2011. The shares
have surged 36 percent in the past 12 months, outpacing the
 Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX) ’s 14 percent increase.  AutoNation will boost its marketing spending by $18
million, or about 20 percent, in the first half of this year to
inform customers about dealership name changes, Jackson said.
For example, Maroone Chevrolet of Pembroke Pines, a store
located between Miami and AutoNation’s headquarters in Fort
Lauderdale, will become AutoNation Chevrolet of Pembroke Pines.  AutoNation will maintain its footprint of primarily major
metropolitan markets in the U.S. Sun Belt, stretching from
California to Florida, Jackson said.  Regional Ambitions  “We have no ambition to be a national brand,” he said.
“There are parts of the country that we are not going into. Our
concentration and focus will be strengthening our position for
the markets that we’re in so that we’re the dominant brand.”  AutoNation’s strategy required signoff from manufacturers
such as GM,  Ford Motor Co. (F) , Chrysler Group LLC,  Toyota Motor
Corp. (7203) , Honda Motor Co. and Nissan Motor Co.  “AutoNation is a strong company and a great retail
brand,” Reid Bigland, Chrysler’s U.S. sales chief, said in an
e-mailed statement. “Standardizing the AutoNation name in the
marketplace will not only benefit them but also the vehicle
lines they represent.”  The company began negotiations with the carmakers in
mid-2012 to get their approval for using its name to precede the
23 mass market brands that AutoNation sells, Jackson said. The
move eventually will help the company save on marketing costs
and boost its presence online and in search results, he said.  ‘Deciding Factor’  “Digital will be the deciding factor in marketing in the
future,” Jackson said today in an interview with Mark Crumpton
on Bloomberg Television. “It’s a much more powerful and
compelling concept to have one, unified brand name.”  Revenue in the fourth quarter rose 13 percent to $4.17
billion, according to a company statement. AutoNation is
forecasting industrywide U.S. vehicle sales to climb to the
mid-15 million-unit range in 2013, from 14.5 million last year.  “We’re in the early innings of this automotive recovery
from a retail point of view,” Jackson said yesterday.  The  service segment  of the auto-retail industry, which
Jackson calls the “foundation” of AutoNation’s business, hit a
cyclical bottom in 2012 and will begin to recover for at least
the next five years, he said.  Service Business  Dealers primarily service vehicles that are less than five
years old, and the population of those cars and trucks on U.S.
roads has dropped since the industry sales bottomed at 10.4
million in 2009, the fewest in 27 years, according to Woodcliff
Lake, New Jersey-based Autodata.  “All those vehicles aren’t out there in the marketplace
operating, so there’s a lag,” Jackson said. “There are simply
fewer vehicles and fewer customers with cars to fix. Now, you
begin to rebuild the units in operation, so each year there will
be more available for service than there was the year before.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
