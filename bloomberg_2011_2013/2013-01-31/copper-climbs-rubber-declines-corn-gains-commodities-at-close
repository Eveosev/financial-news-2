Shanghai Futures Exchange rose 0.7 percent to 59,560  yuan

percent this month in the biggest gain since January 2012.  GRAINS, OILSEEDS, SOFT COMMODITIES  Corn advanced to the highest level in almost eight weeks on
speculation that demand for U.S. supplies may increase as dry
weather in  Argentina  threatens yields and rains in  Brazil  delay

percent to 2,593 ringgit ($835) a metric ton on the Malaysia
Derivatives Exchange, the highest price for the most-active

p.m. in  Kuala Lumpur . Futures, 5.9 percent higher in January,
are heading for the biggest monthly advance since February.  Rubber retreated from the highest level in more than a week
as Japanese industrial production missed estimates, spurring
sales of Asian stocks and reducing investor appetite for the
commodity used in tires.  The contract for delivery in July lost 0.3 percent to 314.9
yen a kilogram ($3,466 a metric ton) on the Tokyo Commodity
Exchange at 12:03 p.m., paring this month’s rally to 4.2
