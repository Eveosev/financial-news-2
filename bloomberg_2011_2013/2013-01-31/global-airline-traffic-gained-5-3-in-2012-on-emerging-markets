Global air passenger traffic grew
5.3 percent last year, boosted by the expansion of Middle
Eastern carriers and demand from markets in Latin America and
 Africa , the  International Air Transport Association  said today.  While growth slowed from 2011’s 5.9 percent figure, it was
above the 5 percent 20-year average, the trade body said in a
 statement . Capacity restraint helped lift seat occupancy to
near-record levels, giving a profit margin of about 1 percent.  “We are entering 2013 with some guarded optimism,” IATA
Chief Executive Officer Tony Tyler said. “Business confidence
is up. The euro-zone situation is more stable than it was a
year-ago and the U.S. avoided the fiscal cliff.”  Passenger traffic should grow by 4.5 percent in 2013, with
cargo markets clawing back their 1.5 percent contraction last
year, IATA said. That may lift net income from an estimated $6.7
billion in 2012 to $8.4 billion, giving a 1.3 percent margin.  Demand in international markets expanded 6 percent last
year and domestic travel grew 4 percent, according to IATA.
Negative factors still weighing earnings include high fuel costs
and sluggish economic growth projected at 2.3 percent, it said.  Cargo Slump  With overall capacity increasing by 3.9 percent in 2012,
passenger load factors improved to an average of 79.1 percent.
That compared with 45.2 percent in the freight market, which
suffered a second straight annual drop after a “one-two punch”
of declining trade and a shift to sea shipping, IATA said.  The number of people flying cross-border with Mid-East
carriers such as Dubai-based Emirates and Qatar Airways gained
15.4 percent last year, accounting for almost one-third of the
expansion in international markets, the industry group said.  Domestic traffic grew the most in China and  Brazil , up 9.5
percent and 8.6 percent respectively. The figure for the U.S.
was 0.8 percent, though that was twice the pace of capacity
growth and produced an 83.4 percent load factor -- the highest
among major markets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
