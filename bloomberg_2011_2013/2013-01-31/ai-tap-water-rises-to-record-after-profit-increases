Thai Tap Water Supply Pcl (TTW)  rose to a
record in Bangkok after  Thailand â€™s largest non-state producer of
drinking water reported a 15 percent increase in profit, buoyed
by higher sales.  The  stock  closed 2 percent higher at 10.30 baht after
climbing as much as 4 percent a day after saying  net income  in
2012 rose to 2.42 billion baht ($17.2 million) from a year
earlier. Thai Tap shares have gained 12 percent this year.  Revenue rose 14 percent to 5.27 billion baht, the company
based in Nakhon Pathom province west of Bangkok said. The board
plans to pay a dividend of 0.30 baht a share on March 29 subject
to shareholder approval. Thai Tap produces and supplies water in
Nakhon Pathom and Samut Sakhon provinces under a contract with
the state-run Provincial Waterworks Authority.  To contact the reporter on this story:
