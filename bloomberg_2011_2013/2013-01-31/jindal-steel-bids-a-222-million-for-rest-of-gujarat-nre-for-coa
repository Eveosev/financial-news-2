Jindal Steel & Power Ltd. (JSP) ,
controlled by Indian billionaire lawmaker Naveen Jindal, offered
A$222 million ($231 million) to buy the rest of  Gujarat NRE
Coking Coal Ltd. (GNM)   Jindal Steel offered 20 Australian cents in cash for every
share of Gujarat, 5.3 percent more than the close yesterday, the
New Delhi-based company said today in a statement. The Indian
steelmaker already holds 19.5 percent of Gujarat NRE, which
climbed to 21 cents at 3:01 p.m. in Sydney.  Buying Gujarat NRE, which already supplies Jindal Steel,
would give Jindal full control of two mines in the Australian
state of New South Wales, helping it meet raw material needs as
it seeks to lift capacity fourfold by 2015. Gujarat NRE has
plans to double output to 5 million metric tons a year.  Jindal Steel operates coal mines in  South Africa  and
Mozambique and agreed last year to buy Canadaâ€™s CIC Energy
Corp., which is developing a coal mine in Botswana. Gujarat NRE
is controlled by Chairman Arun Kumar Jagatramka, who has a  63.75
percent stake , according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Jindal Steel hired  Wilson HTM Investment Group (WIG)  for the
Gujarat transaction, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
