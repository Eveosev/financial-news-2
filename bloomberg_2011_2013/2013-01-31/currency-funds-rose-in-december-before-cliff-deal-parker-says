Foreign-exchange funds gained 0.2
percent in December before Congress reached a budget deal on the
so-called fiscal cliff, according to Parker Global Strategies
LLC.  Among the 43 funds that reported results, the performance
ranged from a return of 5.5 percent to a loss of 6.5 percent,
the company said today in a news release. Twenty-four funds
gained money and 18 reported a loss. The company’s index is down
1.1 percent for the past 12 months.  “In December, political uncertainty and accommodative,
pro-growth monetary policies drove foreign exchange market
trends,” Parker, based in  Stamford ,  Connecticut , said in the
statement. “For the majority of the month, skepticism
surrounding U.S. fiscal cliff negotiations dominated headline
news. Fortunately, Congress reached a last-minute solution that
appeased global investors, but many issues including the debt
ceiling still remain.”  Congress broke an impasse to avert the so-called fiscal
cliff by passing legislation earlier this month skirting income-
tax increases for more than 99 percent of households.  The yen fell against all 16 of its most-traded currencies
tracked by Bloomberg in December, while the  South African Rand 
strengthened against all peers. The euro gained against most of
its peers and climbed 1.6 percent versus the dollar.  The Parker index includes 47 programs managed by 40
companies managing more than $44 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
