Three people died in a bomb attack
in  Pakistan ’s commercial capital of Karachi that reports said
targeted drug gangs.  Two people were wounded in the attack yesterday which the
Dawn newspaper said may have followed a clash between narcotics
dealers and a group they paid to protect them. The city of 18
million people witnesses spikes in violence involving members of
rival political parties, ethnic communities or criminal gangs.
More than 2,000 people were killed last year.  The latest bombing came as the country’s Interior Minister
faced criticism for comments that Karachi was about to be hit by
a series of terrorist attacks early next month.  Rehman Malik was cited by The News newspaper on Jan. 29 as
saying he would hold intelligence agencies responsible if the
strikes occurred. Malik, a lawmaker for the ruling  Pakistan
Peoples Party , apologized yesterday after opposition parties and
allies accused him of spreading fear.  The minister has called a meeting of top intelligence
officials, The News Tribe website  said .  -- Editor:  Mark Williams   To contact the reporters on this story:
