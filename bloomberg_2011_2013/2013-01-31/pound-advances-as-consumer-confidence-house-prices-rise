The pound rose for a third day
against the dollar after reports showed U.K.  consumer confidence 
and house prices both increased in January.  Sterling advanced from near 13-month low versus the euro as
the data spurred optimism the Bank of England’s credit-easing
program is helping to encourage lending and boost the economy. A
report yesterday showed U.K. mortgage approvals rose in
December. Government bonds rose.  “The improvement on consumer confidence and recent data,
particularly bank lending, suggested that perhaps the Bank of
England’s policy is starting to feed through into the real
economy,” said Eimear Daly, head of market analysis at Monex
Europe Ltd. in London. “That should make sentiment toward the
pound less negative, given that it was battered lately.”  The pound gained 0.4 percent to $1.5857 at 5:04 p.m. in
London after rising to $1.5859, the highest level since Jan. 23.
The U.K. currency appreciated 0.3 percent to 85.66 pence per
euro after dropping to 86.07 pence yesterday, the weakest since
December 2011.  An index of U.K.  consumer confidence  increased to minus 26
from minus 29 in December, GfK NOP Ltd. said. The average cost
of a British home rose 0.5 percent from December to 162,245
pounds, according to Nationwide Building Society. U.K. lenders
granted 55,785 mortgages last month, the most since January
2012, the central bank said yesterday.  Monthly Loss  Britain’s currency is still heading for a sixth month of
losses against the euro, dropping 5.5 percent in January, while
it has fallen 2.5 percent against the dollar.  The pound has slumped 3.2 percent this month, according to
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes, which track 10
developed-market currencies. The euro rose 2.9 percent and the
dollar dropped 0.4 percent.  The 10-year gilt yield fell two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 2.10 percent. The 1.75 percent bond
maturing in September 2022 gained 0.145, or 1.45 pounds per
1,000-pound face amount, to 97. The yield has risen 27 basis
points this month.  Gilts advanced along with German bunds and Treasuries as
companies from  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  to  Diageo Plc (DGE)  reported
results that fell short of analysts’ estimates, underpinning
demand for safer assets.  “This appears to be a risk-off day with equities looking a
bit shaky,” said Jason Simpson, a fixed-income strategist at
Banco Santander SA in London. “Our medium-term view is still
for gilt yields to be higher. Growth is seen as sufficiently
strong enough to prevent the need for more stimulus.”  U.K. government securities have handed investors a loss of
2.1 percent in January through yesterday, according to indexes
compiled by Bloomberg and the European Federation of Financial
Analysts Societies. German bunds dropped 2 percent and
Treasuries fell 0.9 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
