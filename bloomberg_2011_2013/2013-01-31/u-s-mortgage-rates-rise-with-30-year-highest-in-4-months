U.S. mortgage rates rose for a
second week, increasing borrowing costs as tight supplies of
listings drive up  home prices .  The average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage was 3.53
percent in the week ended today, up from 3.42 percent and the
highest since September, McLean, Virginia-based  Freddie Mac (FMCC)  said
in a statement. The average 15-year rate rose to 2.81 percent
from 2.71 percent.  U.S. real estate is rebounding as traditional homebuyers
compete with investors for a shrinking inventory of homes. The
S&P/Case-Shiller index of property values increased 5.5 percent
in November, the biggest year-over-year gain since August 2006,
according to data released on Jan. 29.  “The rising prices are clearly a good thing for homeowners
at the same time they make housing more expensive for those who
don’t own but want to buy,” said  Jed Kolko , chief economist for
San Francisco-based  Trulia Inc. (TRLA) , which operates an online
property-listing service.  Home-loan applications in the U.S. fell last week for the
first time this month. The  Mortgage Bankers Association ’s index
decreased 8.1 percent in the week ended Jan. 25 after a 7
percent gain in the prior week, the Washington-based group
reported yesterday. The  refinancing  gauge dropped 10.2 percent,
and the  purchase  index fell 1.8 percent.  The average 30-year mortgage rate dropped to a record 3.31
percent in November, according to  Freddie Mac . The 15-year rate
fell to 2.63 percent, also the lowest on record.  To contact the reporter on this story:
