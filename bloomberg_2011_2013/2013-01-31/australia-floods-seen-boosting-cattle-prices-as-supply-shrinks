Cattle prices in Australia may
extend gains from the lowest price in three years as floodwaters
boost grass growth, prompting farmers to retain animals, said
 Australian Agricultural Co. (AAC) , the nation’s biggest beef producer.  “Traditionally when you have rains like that, we go about
maximizing the growth of the animals instead of taking the
animal to market,” Chief Executive Officer David Farley said in
a conference call today. Prices have risen 6 percent through
yesterday from the three-year low on Jan. 15.  Floodwaters in eastern Australia retreated and cleanup
crews moved in after ex-tropical cyclone Oswald forced thousands
of people to flee their homes. The country’s cattle herd stood
at 29.5 million head at June 30, the highest since 1977,
according to  Meat & Livestock Australia . Beef exports may gain
3.2 percent this year, boosted by shipments to the U.S., where
farmers are culling animals after a drought increased feed
prices to a record, according to the Sydney-based industry group.  The Eastern Young Cattle Indicator, which measures prices
at sales in the nation’s east, rose 1.5 percent to A$3.295
($3.43) a kilogram yesterday. Prices dropped to A$3.108 on Jan.
15, the lowest since January 2010.  “The amount of rain now should tighten supply for the next
four to five months,” Farley said.  Australia , the world’s
third-largest beef exporter, is poised to benefit from declining
supplies in the U.S., he said.  The U.S. herd dropped to 97.8 million head as of July 1,
the smallest for the date in at least 39 years, as the most-
severe drought since the 1930s spurred ranchers to cull animals,
U.S. Department of Agriculture data show.  Cattle for April delivery rose 0.2 percent to $1.3315 a
pound on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange at 9:42 a.m. in
 Singapore . Prices climbed to a record on Jan. 11.  To contact the reporter for this story:
