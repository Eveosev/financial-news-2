Hog prices rose on speculation that
demand for pork may increase as consumers buy more of the
cheaper meat. Cattle also advanced.  Wholesale  pork  fell 1.3 percent yesterday to 85.46 cents a
pound, the biggest slump in five weeks, U.S. Department of
Agriculture data show. Prices are up 1.8 percent in the past
year, while wholesale beef has climbed 2.1 percent to $1.8676 a
pound in the past 12 months, USDA data show. Benchmark Georgia
dock wholesale chicken breast  prices  are up 6.6 percent in that
same period, government data show.  “You’ve got to be a little bit more positive” on pork
products, Chad Henderson, the president of Prime Agriculture
Consulting Inc. in Brookfield,  Wisconsin , said in a telephone
interview. “They are more competitive compared to the other
meats.”  Hog futures for April settlement rose 0.8 percent to 89.95
cents a pound at 10:24 a.m. on the  Chicago  Mercantile Exchange.
Through yesterday, the commodity climbed 4.1 percent this month.  Cattle futures for April delivery increased 0.3 percent to
$1.333 a pound in Chicago.  Feeder-cattle futures for March settlement added 0.6
percent to $1.49925 a pound on the CME.  To contact the reporter on this story:
