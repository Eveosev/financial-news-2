Unilever (ULVR) , the world’s second-largest
consumer-goods maker, plans to spend 1 billion rand ($112
million) building a new plant and upgrading factories in  South
Africa  as consumers there buy more home-care products.  Unilever South Africa (Pty) Ltd., a unit of the Rotterdam-
and London-based company, plans to construct a factory in the
east of Johannesburg at a cost of 800 million rand, spokeswoman
Unathi Mgobozi said by e-mail today.  Construction work will start before the end of June and
production lines will be commissioned into next year, Mgobozi
said, declining to say how many jobs will be created. The
Unilever unit also plans to spend 200 million rand to improve
existing facilities, she said, declining to disclose how the
expansion will be funded.  “We are observing higher levels of consumption in the
home-care category,” Mgobozi said.  The Durban-based company, in which  Remgro Ltd. (REM)  owns a 25.8
percent stake, sold its Mrs H.S. Balls chutney brand to  Tiger
Brands Ltd. (TBS)  in December for 475 million rand.  Remgro dropped 1.5 percent to 163.31 rand in Johannesburg
trading today, giving the company a market value of about 84
billion rand.  To contact the reporter on this story:
