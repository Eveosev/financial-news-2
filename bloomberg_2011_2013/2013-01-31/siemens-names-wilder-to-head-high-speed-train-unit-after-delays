Siemens AG (SIE)  named Juergen Wilder as
head of its high-speed train unit, replacing Ansgar Brockmeyer,
after  Europe ’s largest engineering company was hit by charges
for the delayed delivery of trains.  Wilder will take over tomorrow, Henning Wulf, a spokesman
for Munich-based Siemens, said via phone, confirming a report in
Handelsblatt newspaper. Wilder is currently strategy head of the
company’ infrastructure and cities unit.  Siemens booked 116 million euros ($157 million) in charges
in the three months through December for delays to a high-speed
train order from Deutsche Bahn AG. Roland Busch, the head of the
infrastructure and cities division, said last week that the
train charges are the main reason why the profitability of his
sector didn’t improve in the quarter.  The spokesman declined to comment on the reasons for
Brockmeyer’s change of position, adding that Siemens doesn’t
make personnel decisions based on single projects.  Siemens’ profitability has trailed that at competitors
 General Electric Co. (GE)  and  ABB Ltd. (ABBN)  for six consecutive quarters.
Siemens rose 11 percent in 2012, while  Germany ’s benchmark DAX
index gained 29 percent. General Electric increased 17 percent,
while Swiss rival ABB added 6.1 percent  Today, Siemens dropped 0.5 percent to 80.96 euros in
Frankfurt trading as of 9:41 a.m., valuing the company at 71.4
billion euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
