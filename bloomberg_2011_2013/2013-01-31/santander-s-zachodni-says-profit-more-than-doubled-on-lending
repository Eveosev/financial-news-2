Bank Zachodni WBK SA (BZW) , Poland’s
third-largest lender and a unit of  Banco Santander SA (SAN) , said
fourth-quarter profit more than doubled as higher revenue from
lending offset increased provisions.  Net income rose to 404.5 million zloty ($130.1 million)
from 198.4 million zloty a year earlier, the bank said in a
regulatory statement today. That beat the 371.8 million-zloty
mean estimate of four analysts surveyed by  Bloomberg News .  Zachodni’s profit gain comes as banks in Poland brace for
lower earnings in 2013. Growth in the European Union’s biggest
eastern economy will slow to 2.2 percent this year, according to
the government’s forecast, down from an estimated 2.5 percent
last year and 4.3 percent in 2011.  Net interest income, the difference between what the bank
pays on deposits and what it charges for loans, increased 9.7
percent to 591.8 million zloty. Fees and commissions rose to
364.6 million zloty from 330 million zloty. Bad-loan provisions
surged 88 percent to 160.4 million zloty.  Zachodni in December received the financial-market
regulator’s approval for a merger with Santander’s other Polish
unit Kredyt Bank SA.  Zachodni’s full-year net income totaled 1.43 billion zloty,
while Kredyt Bank’s profit was 336 million zloty last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
