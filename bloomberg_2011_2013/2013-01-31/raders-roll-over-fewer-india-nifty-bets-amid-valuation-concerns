Derivatives traders in  India  rolled
over fewer contracts in the  S&P CNX Nifty Index (NIFTY)  this month amid
concern the recent gains have made equity valuations expensive.  Open interest, or the number of outstanding contracts in
the index futures, totaled 409,338 at 10:59 a.m. Mumbai time,
compared with 522,724 on Dec. 26, a day before the end of the
December series, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Rollovers in
Nifty futures were at 53.24 percent, compared with the three-
month average of 53.73 percent, the data showed.  The Nifty is valued at 15.8 times estimated earnings, the
highest reading since February 2012, data compiled by Bloomberg
show. That compares with a multiple of 10.9 times for the MSCI
 Emerging Markets  Index. The Indian gauge is up 2.5 percent this
year, after jumping 28 percent in 2012, as government measures
to lift growth prompted foreigners to buy a net $3.7 billion of
local shares in 2013, a record for the period, the data show.  “Traders are bracing for consolidation after the recent
stocks rally,” Siddarth Bhamre, head of derivatives at Angel
Broking Ltd., said by phone from Mumbai. “The risk of a big
decline is low” because of a drop in the number of outstanding
positions, he said.  The Nifty retreated 0.1 percent to 6,051.7. Its February
 futures  traded at 6,081.7, down 0.2 percent.  Indian derivative contracts expire on the last Thursday of
every month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
