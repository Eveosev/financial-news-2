U.S. nuclear-power production rose
for a fourth day as  Entergy Corp. (ETR)  boosted output at the Grand
Gulf 1 reactor in  Mississippi .  Total generation  increased 0.3 percent to 94,900 megawatts,
or 93 percent of capacity, the highest level since Sept. 7,
according to U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission data compiled by
Bloomberg. Output was  2.6 percent higher  than a year ago, with
six of 104 reactors offline.  The 1,297-megawatt Grand Gulf 1 reactor operated at 94
percent power early today, up from 48 percent yesterday. The
plant, about 20 miles (32 kilometers) south of Vicksburg,
Mississippi, is returning to full power after a generator trip
Jan. 14. The shutdown was caused by an electrical fault in the
conductors that connect the generator to the main power
transformer, Mike Bowling, a company spokesman, said yesterday.  “The issue was corrected during this outage,” said
Bowling, who is based in Jackson.  Turkey Point 3, a 720-megawatt reactor operated by  NextEra
Energy Inc. (NEE) , increased output to 60 percent of capacity from 50
percent yesterday. The unit, 20 miles south of Miami, Florida,
was slowed Jan. 29 for planned turbine-valve testing and routine
maintenance on equipment, Bianca Cruz, a plant spokeswoman based
in Homestead, said yesterday.  Production in the NRC’s West Region, which includes Grand
Gulf 1, rose for a third consecutive day. The Midwest’s three-
day climb reversed course as the 1,261-megawatt Perry 1’s output
dropped to 68 percent of capacity from 92 percent yesterday.
 FirstEnergy Corp. (FE)  is returning Perry 1 to full power.  “This is part of the normal power ascension process and
occurs when we make control rod adjustments to optimize power
flow,” Jennifer Young, a company spokeswoman based in Akron,
 Ohio , said in an e-mail.  Reactor maintenance shutdowns, usually undertaken in the
U.S. spring or fall when energy use is at its lowest, may
increase consumption of natural gas and coal to generate
electricity. The average refueling down time was 46 days in
2012, according to the  Nuclear Energy Institute .  To contact the reporter on this story:
