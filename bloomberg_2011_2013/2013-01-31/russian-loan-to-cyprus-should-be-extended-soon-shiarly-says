Cypriot Finance Minister Vassos Shiarly said he’s confident a 2.5 billion-euro ($3.4 billion)
loan from  Russia  due in 2016 will be extended soon.  “We have every reason to believe Russia will respond
favorably,” Shiarly told reporters in The Hague today after
making his case for a bailout of Cyprus to Dutch lawmakers. “I
believe soon, but it is not up to us. It should be extended;
it’s in everyone’s interest.”  After the Cypriot economy’s exposure to  Greece  hampered the
eastern Mediterranean island’s ability to get funding, “Russia
was the only country willing to lend to us,” Shiarly said.  Cypriot President Demetris Christofias said yesterday that
Russia was prepared to contribute to a bailout of Cyprus in
cooperation with the European Union. He said Russian President
 Vladimir Putin  assured him in a telephone conversation that
Russia was prepared to participate in loans to Cyprus.  To contact the reporter on this story:
