Mewah International Inc. (MII) , an edible
oils and fats processor, will complete a refinery in Malaysia
after the country cut export taxes on crude palm oil,
potentially boosting margins.  The plant in the eastern state of Sabah with an annual
capacity of 700,000 metric tons will probably be finished by the
year-end, boosting the company’s capacity to 3.5 million tons, a
stock exchange filing said today. A refinery in  Indonesia  was
put on hold and may be revisited by end-2014, Chief Financial
Officer Rajesh Chopra said in an interview.  Malaysia, the world’s second-largest producer, lowered the
export tax on the crude variety and abolished a duty-free
shipment quota from Jan. 1. Indonesia, the biggest, cut taxes in
2011. Shipments from  Malaysia  are tax-free in January and
February because of a decline in global prices.  The decision to resume construction in Sabah was made after
“looking at the viability in Indonesia, refining margins in
Malaysia, the supply, customer base, and how much time it’ll
take to complete,” said Chopra.  In January last year, Mewah said the plant was being
delayed as the company moved investments to Indonesia. The Sabah
facility may cost about $73 million and will be funded from
Mewah’s initial public offering, internal accruals and external
borrowings, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
