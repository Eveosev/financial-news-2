Invesco Ltd. (IVZ) , owner of the Invesco,
 Van Kampen  and PowerShares funds, said fourth-quarter profit
fell 22 percent as expenses rose faster than revenue.  Net income declined to $158.7 million, or 35 cents a share,
from $202.3 million, or 44 cents, a year earlier, Atlanta-based
Invesco said today in a statement. Excluding certain items,
earnings of 45 cents a share missed the 47 cents-a-share average
 estimate  of 20 analysts in a Bloomberg survey. Shares fell by
the most in eight months.  “Compensation expense came in significantly higher than
anticipated,” Daniel Fannon, an analyst in  San Francisco  with
Jefferies & Co., wrote in a research note published today.  Expenses rose 11 percent, outpacing the 9.6 percent revenue
growth, as compensation costs increased and the company booked a
one-time expense tied to the refinancing of debt. Chief
Executive Officer Martin Flanagan has used acquisitions to
broaden Invesco’s offerings beyond traditional stock and bond
mutual funds since taking over in 2005.  Invesco declined 3.6 percent to close at $27.25 in  New
York , the most since June 1. The shares have risen 4.5 percent
this year, compared with a 10 percent gain by Standard & Poor’s
20-company index for asset managers and custody banks.  “The compensation-to-revenue ratio will decline,” Chief
Financial Officer Loren Starr said during a conference call with
analysts, responding to several questions on the topic.  Costs tied to compensation rose 8.6 percent as employee pay
included “additional bonus expense predominately linked to the
quarter’s performance fee revenues and increases in operating
income,” the company said in the statement.  Invesco Deposits  Invesco drew a net $1 billion in investor deposits in the
quarter, contributing to a 0.7 percent increase in assets to
$687.7 billion. Sales of equity-focused products in January are
running 50 percent higher than in the fourth quarter, Starr said
today in an interview.  “January has been an extraordinary month in terms of flows
coming back into a whole range of our products,” Starr said.  Client deposits in the fourth quarter included $1.8 billion
to actively managed products. Clients withdrew $900 million from
index-based products, driven by redemptions from the PowerShares
QQQ Trust, the firm’s largest exchange-traded fund, according to
Starr.  Invesco’s multi-asset products, which invest across stocks,
bonds and commodities, grew 39 percent in 2012, led by deposits
to its $12.2 billion  Balanced Risk Allocation Fund. (ABRZX)  That fund
has grown more than threefold since the end of 2011.  Debt Issuance  Earnings included a $23.5 million cost tied to the
redemption of bonds. Invesco issued $600 million in debt in
November at 3.13 percent interest with repayment scheduled for
2022. The company used $531 million of the proceeds to redeem
debt paying 5.4 percent due this year and next. The remainder
would be used for general purposes, the company said at the
time.  The company also booked about $20 million in costs related
to outsourcing its European transfer agency and restructuring
distribution in  Europe . Net income in the fourth quarter of 2011
was boosted by $45 million from the settlement of a lawsuit
connected to the 2007 departure of investment professionals to a
competitor.  After excluding those and other items, profit rose 6.4
percent from a year earlier, the company said.  The company repurchased 3 million shares of its own stock
at a cost of $75 million in the fourth quarter. It bought back
$265 million in stock in 2012.  BlackRock’s Results  BlackRock Inc. (BLK) , the world’s biggest money manager, said
Jan. 17 that fourth-quarter net income rose 24 percent as
clients deposited a net $47 billion, mostly to index-linked
products, in the three months ended Dec. 31. T. Rowe Price Group
Inc., based in Baltimore, said Jan. 29 that profit rose 23
percent even as clients pulled money for the first time in five
quarters.  To contact the reporter on this story:
