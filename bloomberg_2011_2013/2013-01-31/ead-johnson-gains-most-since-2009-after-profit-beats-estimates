Mead Johnson Nutrition Co. (MJN) , the
world’s largest baby-formula maker, surged the most since its
February 2009 initial public offering after reporting fourth-
quarter earnings that exceeded analysts’ estimates.  The shares  rose  12 percent to $76 at the close in New York,
the biggest single-day increase since Feb. 11, 2009, when the
company split from Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.  Earnings, excluding one-time items, were 72 cents a share,
topping by 4 cents the average of 14 analysts’  estimates 
compiled by Bloomberg. The Glenview, Illinois-based company had
reduced its outlook for 2012 in October due to fewer births in
the U.S. in 2011 and because reports linking its formula to
contamination reduced consumption of its product.  Mead Johnson forecast 2013 adjusted earnings of $3.22 to
$3.30 a share, less than the average analyst estimate of $3.34.  To contact the reporter on this story:
