Robusta coffee climbed to a one-week
high in London as stockpiles remain low and farmers in  Vietnam ,
the world’s largest grower of the variety, are not boosting
sales even as the Tet holidays approach. Cocoa gained.  Vietnamese farmers are “under no pressure to sell further
volumes at prices that do not suit them,” Volcafe, the coffee
unit of trader ED&F Man Holdings Ltd., said in a report e-mailed
Jan. 25. Growers there will sell about 40 percent of the crop
before Tet, the Lunar New Year festival which starts Feb. 10,
Nedcoffee BV estimates. They usually sell 50 percent, the
Amsterdam-based trader said. Robusta coffee stockpiles have
fallen 75 percent since reaching an all-time high in July 2011.  “London continues to hold due to low cert figures and a
lack of available robusta,” Sucden Financial Ltd., a futures
and options broker in  London , said in a report e-mailed
yesterday, referring to grading certificates.  Robusta coffee for March delivery climbed 0.4 percent to

stocks,” Sucden Financial said. “There is reported to be lots
of arabica around and despite news of fungus affecting Central
American stocks, the prices continue to fall.”  Arabica coffee inventories monitored by ICE were 2.6
