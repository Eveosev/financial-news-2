The  premium investors  pay for OAO
Sberbank’s foreign-traded stock compared with the bank’s Moscow
shares jumped after  Russia ’s biggest lender said its receipts
program is close to the limit.  The extra amount  investors  pay to hold the London-traded
securities surged to 23 cents, the highest since Jan. 7, when
Moscow trading was closed for public holidays. The last time the
premium was larger than today’s level when both exchanges were
open was on Nov. 23.  Sberbank “announces that its level I ADR program and Rule
144a GDR program have nearly reached the current overall limit
for creating DRs,” the lender said in a statement on its
website. Depositary receipts can only account for 25 percent of
a company’s shares and 50 percent of its listed shares,
according to Russian regulations. Sberbank’s depositary receipts
are equivalent to four ordinary shares.  Sberbank’s depositary receipts jumped as much as 3.3
percent before trading up 2.2 percent at $14.67 by 11 a.m. in
 London . Thirty million receipts traded hands, about 1.9 times
the three-month average. Sberbank rose 0.9 percent to 108.69
rubles in Moscow.  “Many international investors are restricted from
investing in local Russian shares,”  Luis Saenz , head of equity
sales and trading at BCS Financial Group, wrote by e-mail. “You
often see anomalies where the same asset trades at significantly
different  price levels  in Russia and in London.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
