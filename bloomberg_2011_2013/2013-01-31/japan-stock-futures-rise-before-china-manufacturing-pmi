Japanese  stock futures  rose as the
yen weakened against the dollar for a third day and investors
awaited a report that may show an expansion in Chinese
manufacturing. Australian shares climbed.  American Depositary Receipts  of  Nomura Holdings Inc. (8604) ,
Japan’s biggest brokerage, declined 0.5 percent as net income
fell short of analysts’ estimates. Those of Kyocera Corp. slid
2.3 percent as the Japanese electronics maker reduced its profit
forecast. ADRs of Honda Motor Co. declined 1.3 percent as third
quarter operating profit at the carmaker missed estimates.  Futures on Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  expiring next
month closed at 11,135 in Chicago yesterday, up from 11,110 at
the close in Osaka, Japan. They were bid in the pre-market at
11,150 in Osaka at 8:05 a.m. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index
gained 0.2 percent and New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index fell 0.1
percent.  “There is a general consensus that following such a strong
six month re-weighting into stocks, earnings need to continue to
back this move up,” said Evan Lucas, Melbourne-based market
strategist at IG Markets Ltd., a provider of trading services.
“The biggest news to affect our market today will be the
release of China’s manufacturing PMI.”  At least 18 companies in  Japan  are scheduled to report
results today. Of the 109 companies on the Topix Index that have
reported earnings so far this quarter and for which Bloomberg
has estimates, 58 percent have exceeded profit expectations,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Japan’s Rally  The Topix, heading for a 12th week of gains, has surged
about 30 percent since Nov. 14, when elections were announced,

steps to fight deflation. The gauge is trading at 1.1 times book
value, compared with 2.25 for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
and 1.62 for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. The yen weakened to the
lowest level since June 2010 to 91.81 per dollar.  China’s  Purchasing Managers ’ Index for manufacturing will

of economists ahead of today’s report. The  Bloomberg China-US
