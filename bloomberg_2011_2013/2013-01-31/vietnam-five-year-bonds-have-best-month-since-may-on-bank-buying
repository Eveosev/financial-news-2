Vietnam ’s benchmark five-year bonds
had their largest monthly gain since May on speculation that
credit demand remained weak in January, spurring banks to buy
debt with surplus cash. The dong was steady.  Bank liquidity increased 0.2 percent as lending fell 1.1
percent in the first three weeks of 2013, the government said in
a statement distributed at its monthly press briefing on Jan.
29. Credit growth may remain slow in the first months of the
year, Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung said in a New Year’s
message on Jan. 1, after a slowdown in economic growth and
rising bad debts crimped lending in 2012.  “The liquidity of the banking system overall is quite
comfortable, credit growth is low, so the banks are buying
bonds,” said Pham Thuy Linh, a Hanoi-based analyst at
 Vietcombank Securities Co. Ltd.   The yield on five-year bonds fell 58 basis points in
January, or 0.58 percentage point, to 9.17 percent, according to
a daily fixing rate from banks compiled by Bloomberg. That’s the
fourth month in a row that yields have fallen. The rate was
little changed from yesterday.  The dong traded at 20,845 per dollar as of 2:01 p.m. in
Hanoi, compared with 20,848 yesterday, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The currency weakened 0.05 percent this
month.  The  State Bank  of Vietnam set its reference rate at 20,828,
unchanged since December 2011, according to its website. The
currency is allowed to trade up to 1 percent on either side of
the rate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
