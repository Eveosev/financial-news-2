Corn advanced to the highest level
in almost eight weeks on speculation that demand for supplies
from the U.S. may increase as dry weather in  Argentina 
threatens yields and rains in Brazil delay the harvest.  Corn for March delivery rose as much as 0.5 percent to
$7.4375 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade, the highest
price for the most-active contract since Dec. 7, and was at
$7.4024 at 10:49 a.m. in  Singapore . Futures, 6.3 percent higher
this month, are set for the first monthly gain since July.  Hot and dry weather may increase stress to reproductive and
filling crops in Argentina before some showers expected this
weekend, forecaster DTN said in a report yesterday. Heavy storms
in Brazil’s northern growing areas will continue to delay and
disrupt the early harvests, DTN said.  “The weather is a very important concern of the farmers in
the market,”  Tetsu Emori , a commodity fund manager at Astmax
Co., said by phone from  Tokyo  today. “As long as the weather
conditions are not very beneficial during the growing period of
the grains, it should affect the production.”  Wheat for March delivery was little changed at $7.86 a
bushel. The grain is set to gain 1.2 percent this month, the
first such advance since September. Soybeans for March delivery
lost 0.3 percent to $14.75 a bushel, paring the monthly advance
to 4.6 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
