Greenheart Group (94) , a unit of Sino-
Forest Corp., received a HK$165 million ($21 million) offer from
Emerald Plantation Group Ltd. for the shares it doesn’t own in
the lumber supplier.  Emerald Plantation offered 58  Hong Kong  cents a share to
buy Greenheart stock it doesn’t already own, it said in a filing
to the Hong Kong stock exchange.  Bourse  rules  require companies that gain control of more
than 30 percent of another company’s shares to bid for the
remaining stake. Emerald Plantation owns about 64 percent of
Greenheart at present.  Greenheart shares  rose  4.7 percent to 67 Hong Kong cents at
the close. The buyout offer values the entire company at HK$452
million.  Sino-Forest was accused in June 2011 by short seller  Carson Block  of exaggerating its revenue.  To contact the reporter on this story:
