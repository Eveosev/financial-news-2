A fire in a gasoline-making unit at
 PBF Energy Inc. (PBF) ’s  refinery  in Toledo, Ohio, has been
extinguished, according to a spokeswoman.  The company is looking into the cause of the incident at
11:50 p.m. local time yesterday, Olivia Summons said in an e-
mail, declining to say whether the 170,000 barrel-a-day facility
is operating at a reduced rate. There were no injuries, the
spokeswoman said.  Gasoline extended to 10 days the longest rally since July
2009 yesterday on the  New York  Mercantile Exchange amid
speculation that maintenance at other refineries and the planned
closure of  Hess Corp. (HES) ’s New Jersey plant would reduce supply.  The closure of the Hess plant “comes just ahead of peak
spring maintenance shutdown period for refiners,” Soozhana
Choi, Deutsche Bank AG’s chief oil strategist in Singapore,
wrote today in a report. The  Port Reading , New Jersey plant will
shut by the end of next month, Hess said on Jan. 28.  Gasoline supply in the so-called PADD 1 area, which
includes New York Harbor, was 10 percent below the five-year
average last week, Energy Department data showed yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
