The market for corporate borrowing
through U.S.  commercial paper  contracted for a second week after
three months of increases.  The seasonally adjusted amount of U.S. commercial paper
decreased about $700 million to $1.125 trillion outstanding in
the week ended yesterday, the Federal Reserve said today on its
website. Thatâ€™s the lowest level since the market touched $1.105
trillion in the period ended Jan. 9.  Corporations sell commercial paper, typically maturing in
270 days or less, to fund everyday activities such as rent and
salaries.  To contact the reporter on this story:
