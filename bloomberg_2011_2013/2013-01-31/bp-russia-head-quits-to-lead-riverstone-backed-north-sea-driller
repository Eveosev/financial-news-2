BP Plc (BP/) ’s Russia chief will leave the
company to become chief executive officer of Fairfield Energy, a
private-equity-owned North Sea oil producer where former BP CEO
John Browne is a board member.  David Peattie, who spent time in Browne’s office in the
1990s during a 34-year BP career, will start on March 1,
Fairfield said today. Fairfield is owned by a group of investors
led by Warburg Pincus LLC and Riverstone Holding LLC, the firm
where Browne is now a partner.  Fairfield was created as an independent operator to
concentrate on developing and rejuvenating known deposits in the
U.K. North Sea. The company, based in Staines near London, said
in a statement that it’s now placing greater emphasis on
exploration to balance the oil-production side of its business.  Peattie, a petroleum engineer by training, became head of
BP Russia in 2008 and last year helped agree on the sale of the
company’s 50 percent stake in TNK-BP, Russia’s third-largest oil
producer, to  OAO Rosneft. (ROSN)   To contact the reporter on this story:
