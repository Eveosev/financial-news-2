Emirates NBD PJSC (EMIRATES) ’s fourth-quarter
profit quadrupled, beating analyst estimates, as loan-loss
charges at the biggest United Arab Emirates bank fell and income
from affiliates increased.  Net income of the Dubai-based lender advanced to 625
million dirhams ($170.2 million), or 10 fils a share, from 152
million dirhams, or 2 fils a share, a year earlier, it said in a
statement today. Profit beat the 517 million-dirham mean
estimate of six analysts, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The bank’s impairment allowances fell 11 percent to
940 million dirhams.  Emirates NBD,  56 percent owned  by Dubai’s government, is
recovering from the impact of the global credit crisis which
slowed lending, hit  investment banking  and led to a surge in
loan-loss charges as defaults rose. Dubai, the second-biggest of
seven emirates that make up the U.A.E., is forecast to post its
best economic growth in five years in 2012 of 4.3 percent,
helped by its tourism, transport, retail and trade industries.  These are “strong” results and “in combination with our
strong levels of  capitalization  and liquidity, positions the 
bank to take advantage of growth opportunities in the future,” 
Chief Executive Officer  Rick Pudner  said in the statement.  Non-Performing Loans  The bank had a profit from associate companies, which
include  Union Properties PJSC (UPP) , of 37 million dirhams compared
with a 227 million-dirham loss a year earlier.  Emirates NBD’s ratio of non-performing loans to total loans
fell to 14.3 percent in the fourth quarter from 14.4 percent in
the preceding three months. The bank is one of the biggest
lenders to investment company Dubai Group LLC, which is
negotiating to restructure $6 billion of bank debt.  Emirates NBD’s net interest income fell 8 percent to 1.77
billion dirhams as the net interest margin narrowed to 2.47
percent from 2.85 percent a year earlier, it said. The bank’s
loan book expanded 7 percent in the year to 218.2 billion
dirhams and deposits grew 11 percent to 213.9 billion dirhams.  Higher Dividend  Bank lending in the U.A.E., the second-biggest Arab
economy, rose 2.8 percent in the 12 months through October,
according to central bank data. That compares with a 15 percent
rise in lending to the private sector in  Saudi Arabia  in the 12
months through November, according to Saudi central bank data.  Emirates NBD’s board recommended a cash dividend 25 fils a
share, compared with 20 fils in each of the previous three
years. In December, the bank agreed to buy Paris-based BNP
Paribas SA’s 95.2 percent stake in its Egyptian unit that valued
the Egyptian bank at $500 million.  Shares of Emirates NBD surged 8.6 percent to 3.8 dirhams on
Jan. 29, the last day they traded before being suspended ahead
of the results announcement. The shares have risen 33 percent
this year compared with a 15 percent advance in the benchmark
DFM General Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
