Seattle ’s public employee pension
system will consider selling off its holdings in  Exxon Mobil
Corp. (XOM)  and other oil and natural gas producers under a proposal
to divest holdings in the fossil-fuel industry.  The $1.9 billion  fund ’s investment committee will consider
the plan to study divestment tomorrow. If approved, it would go
to the full board for consideration as soon as Feb. 14,
according to a fund spokeswoman, Lisa Carns.  Two of the system’s top 10 investments are with Exxon and
 Chevron Corp. (CVX) , according to Seattle Mayor Mike McGinn, who
offered the proposal last month. The pension system has $17.6
million invested with the two companies, or just under 1 percent
of its assets, his office said.  The proposal was first reported by the Financial Times.  To contact the reporter on this story:
