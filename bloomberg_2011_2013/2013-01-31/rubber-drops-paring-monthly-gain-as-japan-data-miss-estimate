Rubber retreated from the highest
level in more than a week as Japanese industrial production
missed estimates, spurring sales of Asian stocks and reducing
investor appetite for the commodity used in tires.  The contract for delivery in July lost 0.3 percent to 314.9
yen a kilogram ($3,466 a metric ton) on the  Tokyo  Commodity
Exchange at 12:03 p.m., paring this month’s rally to 4.2
percent. Earlier, it rose to 317.2 yen, the highest level since
Jan. 21.  Japanese output rose 2.5 percent last month, compared with
estimates for a 4.1 percent gain, while U.S. gross domestic
product shrank at a 0.1 percent annual rate last quarter, the
worst performance since 2009. Data tomorrow will probably show
U.S. employers added more workers this month, after the  Federal
Reserve  said yesterday it will keep purchasing securities at the
rate of $85 billion a month.  “Worse-than-expected data put a drag on the market,”
Naohiro Niimura, a partner at research company Market Risk
Advisory in Tokyo, said today by e-mail.  Losses were limited amid expectations that shipment
restrictions and a recovery in demand will bolster prices this
year, said Takaki Shigemoto at research company JSC Corp. in
Tokyo.  Diminishing rubber supplies and record car sales are
extending a five-month  bull market  that’s poised to raise costs
for tiremakers, according to analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.
Futures will advance to 350 yen in Tokyo this year, the median
of 12 analyst estimates show.  Rubber for May delivery was little changed at 26,190  yuan 
($4,211) a ton on the Shanghai Futures Exchange. Thai rubber
free-on-board was unchanged at 96.85 baht ($3.25) a kilogram
yesterday, according to the country’s rubber research institute.  To contact the reporter on this story:
