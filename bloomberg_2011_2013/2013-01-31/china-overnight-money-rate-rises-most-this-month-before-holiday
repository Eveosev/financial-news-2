China ’s overnight money-market rate
rose the most this month on speculation cash at banks will drop
as customer withdrawals increase before the weeklong Lunar New
Year holiday that starts Feb. 11.  The one-day repurchase  rate , a gauge of interbank funding
availability, climbed to a three-week high even after the
central bank  added  money into the financial system to help ease
the fund squeeze. The People’s Bank of China released 59 billion
yuan ($9.5 billion) this week, the first injection in 2013.  “Banks have to prepare enough cash for holiday withdrawal
demand,” said Liu Junyu, a bond analyst in Shenzhen at China
Merchants Bank Co., the nation’s sixth-biggest lender. “There
may be a bit of shortage next week.”  The one-day repo rate jumped 21 basis points, or 0.21
percentage point, to 2.31 percent as of 10:45 a.m. in  Shanghai ,
the biggest increase since Dec. 31, according to a weighted
average compiled by the National Interbank Funding Center.  The central bank today issued 100 billion  yuan  of seven-day
reverse-repurchase contracts at 3.35 percent, according to a
trader required to bid at the auctions. The yield was unchanged
from the last offering.  The one-year swap contract, the fixed cost needed to
receive the floating seven-day repo rate, gained one basis point
to 3.20 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
