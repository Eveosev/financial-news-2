Gildan Activewear Inc. (GIL) , the top-
performing company in the benchmark Standard & Poor’s/TSX
Composite Index in 2012, fell the most in more than two months
after an analyst at  RBC Capital Markets  lowered the stock’s
rating.  Gildan, one of the world’s biggest suppliers of blank tops
to makers of printed clothing, fell 3.1 percent to C$36.72, the
most since Nov. 14.  Tal Woolley, consumer analyst with RBC in Toronto, lowered
his rating for Montreal-based Gildan to sector perform, or hold,
from outperform, the equivalent of a buy, while maintaining a
price target of $39. The company now trades more expensively
than its peers based on his 2014 earnings forecast of $3 a
share, he said.  “Strong price appreciation is the primary reason for our
downgrade,” Woolley said in a note to clients today.  Gildan  jumped  90 percent in 2012, tops among all stocks in
the benchmark Canadian equity gauge. It’s current price-to-
earnings ratio of 29.53 is higher than some of its competitors
including  Hanesbrands Inc. (HBI)  at 19.34 and  Oxford Industries Inc. (OXM) 
at 19.28, according to  data  compiled by Bloomberg.  Woolley expects “very strong year-over-year”  earnings 
results for Gildan’s upcoming first quarter, including a 32
percent rise in sales to $400 million versus consensus of $397
million, driven by gains in the printwear and branded apparel
product lines of 46 percent and 18 percent respectively.  Lower Costs  Gross margin  is estimated to rise 2,545 basis points to
27.5 percent, driven by “lower cotton costs and no inventory
devaluation,” Woolley said.  “We would revisit our rating if shares pulled back
materially, given our belief in the size of the growth
opportunity and management capability to exploit it, or we saw
upside to our 2014 earnings-per-share forecast,” he said.  Jennifer Dowty, a  fund manager  with Manulife Asset
Management Ltd., said the outlook for Gildan remains very
positive.  “The pullback today is an opportunity to accumulate
shares,” she said in a phone interview. Dowty’s firm manages
about C$235 billion ($235.57 billion).  Of note, Gildan will spend at least $3.8 million for a 30-
second TV spot during the  Super Bowl  on Feb. 3, according to an
interview the company’s ad agency gave to the  New York  Times.  “This is consistent with Gildan’s guidance that it would
be materially increasing its marketing outreach this year,”
Woolley said.  Gildan is scheduled to report its earnings on Feb. 6.  A call to the company seeking comment was not immediately
returned.  To contact the reporter on this story:
