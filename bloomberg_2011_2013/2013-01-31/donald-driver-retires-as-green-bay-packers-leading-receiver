Donald Driver announced his
retirement from the National Football League after a 14-year
career with the Green Bay Packers that made him the team’s all-
time leader in catches and receiving yards.  The Packers will formally mark his retirement on Feb. 6 at
a public event at Lambeau Field, the team said on its  website .  Driver, who turns 38 in two days, played his entire career
in Green Bay after being picked in the seventh round of the 1999
NFL draft. Having posted seven 1,000-yard seasons, his 743
receptions rank 37th in NFL history and his 10,137 yards are
38th. A three-time Pro Bowl selection, Driver won a Super Bowl
with the Packers in February 2011.  Driver played in 13 games this season, catching eight
passes for 77 yards and two touchdowns.  To contact the reporter on this story:
