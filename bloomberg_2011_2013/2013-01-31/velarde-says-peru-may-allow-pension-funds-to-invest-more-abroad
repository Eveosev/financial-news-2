Peru ’s central bank may allow the
country’s pension funds to invest more abroad to cool demand for
the sol, said bank President Julio Velarde.  The bank’s board may increase the ceiling on overseas
investment to 34 percent of the portfolio “in the near
future,” if the funds’ foreign holdings are nearing the current
32 percent limit, Velarde said in an interview in Chicago
yesterday. Policy makers may increase the limit each quarter, he
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
