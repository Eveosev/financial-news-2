 Crude oil options volatility rose
as the underlying futures fell for the first time in four days,
after reports showed that claims for U.S. unemployment benefits
gained more than forecast and an index of consumer comfort fell.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
March, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge
of options prices, was 18.95 percent at 4:09 p.m. on the  New
York Mercantile Exchange , up from 18.7 percent yesterday.  Crude oil for March delivery slipped 46 cents to $97.49 a
barrel on the Nymex. Prices declined as initial jobless claims
rose to 368,000 last week, exceeding the median forecast of
economists surveyed by Bloomberg. The Bloomberg Consumer Comfort
Index dropped for a fourth week.  The most active options in electronic trading today were
March $95 puts, which rose 3 cents to 65 cents a barrel on
volume of 1,958 contracts. The second-most active, with 1,608
lots exchanged, were March $100 calls, which fell 15 cents to 46
cents a barrel.  Bets that prices would fall, or puts, accounted for 62
percent of electronic trading volume.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on open-
outcry volume, where the bulk of options activity occurs.  In the previous session, puts accounted for 57 percent of
volume.  March $78 puts were the most active options yesterday, with
9,000 contracts trading as they were unchanged at 1 cent a
barrel. March $87 puts slipped 2 cents to 8 cents a barrel on
volume of 8,102 lots.  Open interest was highest for March $110 calls with 42,345
contracts. Next were March $85 puts at 33,334 and March $115
calls at 30,503.  To contact the reporter on this story:
