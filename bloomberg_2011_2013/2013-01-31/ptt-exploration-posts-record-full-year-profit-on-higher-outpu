PTT Exploration & Production Pcl (PTTEP) ,
Thailand’s biggest publicly traded oil and gas explorer, said
profit surged 28 percent to a record in 2012 on increased
production and higher prices.  Net income  was 57.3 billion baht ($1.9 billion), or 17.1
baht per share, from 44.7 billion baht, or 13.48 baht, in 2011,
the company said in a statement late yesterday. That compared
with the 60.3 billion baht average estimate of 23 analysts
 surveyed  by Bloomberg.  Chief Executive Officer Tevin Vongvanich said last week
that PTTEP will spend almost $25 billion over the next five
years to develop petroleum projects in Thailand and overseas.
The company, which has 44 oil and gas projects worldwide, raised
about $3 billion in December in  Thailand ’s largest ever equity
offering to finance its purchase of Cove Energy Plc, which gave
it a stake in East African assets.  The company has said it plans to double output to 600,000
barrels of oil equivalent a day by 2020 through existing
projects in  Australia , East Africa, North America and Southeast
Asia. PTTEP operates the Bongkot fields off the coast of
Thailand and the Montara field off Australia’s northwest coast.  To contact the reporter on this story:
