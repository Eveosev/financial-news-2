OGX Petroleo e Gas Participacoes SA ,
the Brazilian  oil company  controlled by billionaire  Eike Batista , fell to a four-year low and its bonds tumbled after a
dry hole stoked concerns about the outlook for production.  OGX fell 6.2 percent to 4.10 reais in  Sao Paulo , the lowest
level since December 2008. Bonds from the company due in 2018
tumbled 3.53 cents to 92.95 cents on the dollar, pushing yields
to 10.25 percent, the highest in a month.  OGX completed work at a well known as Cozumel without
finding any signs of oil or natural gas, according to a
presentation posted on its website. The company had been
planning to set up its fifth production platform at the site,
Itau Unibanco Holding SA analyst Paula Kovarsky said in a note
to clients.  Investors are also anxious to hear about production results
from the third well at the Tubarao Azul field that the Rio de
Janeiro-based company plans to release next week after starting
output in early January, Joao Pedro Brugger, who helps oversee
220 million reais ($110 million) of assets at Leme
Investimentos, said by phone from Florianopolis, Brazil.  The stock fell 68 percent last year after lower-than-
expected output at OGXâ€™s first two wells prompted the company to
withdraw its long-term production targets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
