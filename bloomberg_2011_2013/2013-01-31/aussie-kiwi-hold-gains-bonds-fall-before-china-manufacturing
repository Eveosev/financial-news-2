The Australian dollar fell, erasing
earlier gains, after growth in Chinese manufacturing trailed
economists’ estimates, damping trade prospects.  The so-called kiwi touched the highest since August 2011
against its Australian counterpart after  Reserve Bank  of New
Zealand Governor Graeme Wheeler said the smaller nation needs to
reduce the  budget deficit  or face higher interest rates. The
bank kept its benchmark borrowing cost at 2.5 percent yesterday.  “Chinese manufacturing data was not a disastrous result
but definitely weaker than what the market was looking for,”
said  Jonathan Cavenagh , a currency strategist at  Westpac Banking
Corp. (WBC)  in Singapore. “It would certainly take the shine off of
Aussie dollar.”  Australia’s dollar declined 0.3 percent to $1.0392 at 4:27
p.m. in Sydney, after rising as much as 0.2 percent. The so-
called Aussie bought 95.78 yen and touched 95.84, the highest
since August 2008. Australia’s currency dropped to NZ$1.2350,
the lowest since August 2011, before trading at NZ$1.2352, 0.6
percent below yesterday’s close.  The  yield  on Australia’s benchmark 10-year bonds rose seven
basis points, or 0.07 percentage point, to 3.52 percent. The
rate has climbed 20 basis points this week.  The kiwi advanced 0.3 percent to 84.14 U.S. cents from
yesterday, when it gained 0.4 percent. The currency reached
77.58 yen, the highest since August 2008, before trading at
77.55, up 0.8 percent from yesterday’s close. Two-year interest-
rate swaps in  New Zealand  rose 2 1/2 basis points to 2.92
percent.  China Manufacturing  The  Purchasing Managers ’ Index for  China ’s manufacturing
fell to 50.4 in January from 50.6 in the previous month, the
National Bureau of Statistics and China Federation of Logistics
and Purchasing said today. That compares with the median
estimate of 51.0 from a Bloomberg News survey of economists.  A separate PMI of China manufacturing by HSBC Holdings Plc
and Markit Economics rose to 52.3 last month from 51.5 in
December. China is Australia’s biggest trading partner and New
Zealand’s second-largest export market.  A  gauge  measuring Australian manufacturing dropped 4.1
points to 40.2 last month, the lowest level since June 2009, the
Australian Industry Group said in a survey released today. The
last reading above 50, the divide between expansion and
contraction, was in February 2012.  Interest-rate swaps  data compiled by Bloomberg show traders
see a 27 percent chance the  Reserve Bank of Australia  will lower
its benchmark rate by a quarter percentage point to 2.75 percent
at its Feb. 5 meeting.  ‘Prefer Kiwi’  “When we look at Aussie and kiwi, we prefer kiwi because
of the monetary policy outlook” said Alvin Pontoh, an Asia-
Pacific strategist at TD Securities Inc. in Singapore. “We
think the RBA will hold rates next week, but at the same time
leave the door open for further policy easing. The weakness of
the Australia PMI, at a margin, adds to the case for bit more
easing down the track.”  TD expects the  Reserve Bank of New Zealand  will raise
 interest rates  in September.  UBS AG recommends selling the Aussie dollar versus its New
Zealand counterpart, according to a research note today.  RBNZ Governor Wheeler said returning the country’s budget
to surplus “will strengthen the economy’s resilience and create
more fiscal room for responding to future shocks.” Failure to
narrow the budget shortfall “means monetary policy has to be
tighter and interest rates higher than otherwise.” He spoke in
Christchurch today.  “The fact that Wheeler didn’t talk down the New Zealand
dollar aggressively was very much welcomed by the markets,”
said Westpac’s Cavenagh. “It was more of what he didn’t say
rather than what he did say.”  Prime Minister John Key said this week the nation’s
companies are hurt by the high  exchange rate .  The  New Zealand dollar  has risen 1.4 percent in the past
month according to Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Currency
Indexes. The Australian dollar has fallen 0.5 percent in the
same period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
