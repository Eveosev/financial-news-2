(Corrects to show that prices, yields are for Jan. 29 in
second paragraph.)  New Reclamation Group (Pty) Ltd.,
South Africa’s lowest-rated company by Standard & Poor’s, said
it will repay holders of its bonds due tomorrow after obtaining
unconditional funding.  Yields on the Johannesburg-based scrap-metal exporter’s
8.125 percent notes dropped from 3,678 percent to a record-low
7.81 percent on Jan. 29 after the debt was priced at 100 percent
of face value. The 149.5 million euros ($203 million) of
outstanding debt traded at 90.38 cents on the euro yesterday,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “I’m not at liberty to say where the funds come from,”
General Manager Chris Gavrielides said by phone from
Johannesburg today.  Reclam, as the closely held company is known, will pay the
outstanding debt to trustee Bank of  New York  Mellon by 10 a.m.
in  London  tomorrow, it said in a statement on its website.  The company’s repayment options included asking its
shareholders for money, raising funds through local or offshore
term loans and using its properties, plant and equipment, it
said in a quarterly report on its website.  S&P cut its rating on the notes three steps to D, or
payment default, on Nov. 7, after the company said it bought
back 24 percent of the debt at a discount of about 25 percent,
which S&P said it considered as a distressed exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
