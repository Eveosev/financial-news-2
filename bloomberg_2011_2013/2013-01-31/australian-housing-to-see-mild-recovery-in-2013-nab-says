Australian  home prices  are expected
to see a “mild recovery,” climbing by 0.9 percent in 2013, led
by growth in the mining states of Western Australia and
Queensland, a  National Australia Bank Ltd. (NAB)  survey showed.  Home prices across the country fell 0.6 percent in the
three months ended Dec. 31, with the biggest decline in Victoria
state, the bank said in an e-mailed report today. Prices will
rise 2.1 percent in the next two years, led by a 3.6 percent
increase in Western Australia and 2.2 percent in Queensland, the
survey of about 270 real estate agents, developers, property
owners and asset managers, showed.  Rents are expected to climb by 3.3 percent across Australia
in the next two years, led by Western Australia.  House prices  across the country rose 2.1 percent in 2012,
and apartments climbed 2.4 percent, Sydney-based researcher
Australian Property Monitors said in a separate report today.
House and apartment values in Sydney are both at records,
climbing to A$656,415 ($683,900) and A$475,314 respectively.  “The general improvement to affordability and confidence
as a consequence of record-low interest rates will fuel
increased buyer activity and confidence,”  Andrew Wilson , senior
economist at APM, said in the release.  To contact the reporter on this story:
