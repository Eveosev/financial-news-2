President  Vladimir Putin ’s plan to
sell government assets will bolster Russian stocks, shrinking
the discount on the world’s cheapest emerging market to the
least since 2010, according to HSBC Global Asset Management.  “People will be rediscovering Russia,” Christian Deseglise, who helps oversee $426 billion as a managing director
at HSBC Global in New York, said by phone Jan. 30. “Russia will
benefit from the planned asset sales and normalization of risk
appetite globally.”  Companies on MSCI Inc.’s  Russia Index (MXRU)  trade at an average
5.6 times estimated earnings, the lowest valuation among 21
 emerging markets  tracked by Bloomberg and a 49 percent discount
to the  MSCI Emerging Markets Index. (MXEF)  The gap will narrow to 30
percent in 2013, according to Deseglise, as Putin seeks $10
billion by reducing state investment in companies including
tanker owner OAO Sovcomflot and bank VTB Group. The last time
Russia traded at a 30 percent discount was in January 2010.  The  Bloomberg Russia-US Equity Index (RUS14BN)  of the most-traded
Russian stocks in the U.S. rallied 0.9 percent yesterday to
105.46, the highest level since April. It rose 6.2 percent in
January. The MSCI Russia gained 0.3 percent yesterday to cap a
second monthly advance of 6.3 percent. American depositary
receipts of  OAO Sberbank (SBRCY) , the country’s biggest lender, soared
to a five-month high in the U.S.  Futures expiring in March on the RTS Index added 0.6
percent to 162,870 by 5:09 p.m. in Moscow today.  The world’s biggest energy exporter wants to reduce state
involvement in companies as it seeks to lure more foreign
investors and stem capital flight. The government sold 217
billion rubles ($7.2 billion) of shares last year, according to
the Federal Property Management Agency, below the  Finance
Ministry ’s initial target of 300 billion rubles.  Russian Exchanges  Government shares in state-run companies should be sold on
Russian exchanges, Putin said at a meeting of officials last
week.  Russian equities lagged behind other emerging markets last
year, with the MSCI Russia advancing 9.6 percent in 2012,
trailing a 15 percent jump in the MSCI emerging-markets gauge.
The benchmark Micex Index’s 5.1 percent rally this year compares
with a 1.8 percent increase in the  BSE India Sensitive Index (SENSEX)  and
the 1.4 percent decline in Brazil’s  Bovespa (IBOV)  gauge. The Micex was
beaten by the Shanghai Composite Index, which has added 6.6
percent and entered a  bull market  in January.  HSBC Global is “significantly overweight” Russian stocks
and manages more than $1.2 billion of Russian equity
investments, Deseglise said. The  HSBC Global Investments Russia
Equity Fund (HSBRUSU)  has returned 5.2 percent in 2013 and beaten 51
percent of peers, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Transport Stocks  “We particularly like Russia’s transportation sector,
including railways and airlines as the nation plans to develop
its infrastructure,” he said. “We like Russia. We like how
cheap it is.”  Russia is building a high-speed rail link from Moscow to
the Black Sea city of Sochi for the 2014 Winter  Olympic Games .
It is also constructing a metro line to the ski fields and
airport and will boost infrastructure investment in the capital
and other cities in preparation for the soccer  World Cup , to be
held in Russia in 2018.  The  Market Vectors Russia ETF (RSX) , the largest dedicated
Russian exchange-traded fund, rose 0.8 percent to $30.82 in New
York yesterday, adding 3.1 percent in the month. The RTS
Volatility Index, which measures expected swings in the  stock
futures , plunged 8.8 percent to 18.99 today.  Rising oil prices will also bolster Russian stock
valuations, Deseglise said.  Oil Boost  Crude for March delivery pared its 6.2 percent advance in
January today, losing 0.2 percent to $97.27 a barrel in New
York. Brent added 0.5 percent in London to $116.17 a barrel,
while  Urals crude  was little changed at $114.49. Russia’s chief
export oil blend climbed 4.3 percent last month, the most since
August.  Russia’s government gets about 50 percent of its revenue
from the oil and gas sector and crude is the nation’s biggest
export earner.  Sberbank ADRs rallied 2.7 percent to $14.73 in New York
yesterday, the highest close since Aug. 2, 2011.  The state-controlled lender said its depositary receipts
program has “nearly reached” the overall limit for the
creation of DRs, according to a statement on its website. DRs
can only account for 25 percent of a company’s shares and 50
percent of its listed shares under Russian regulations.
Sberbank’s ADRs are equivalent to four ordinary shares.  Extend Gains  CTC Media Inc. (CTCM)  soared 38 percent in January, a record start
to a year for the Russian media company and the biggest gain on
the Russia-US index in the month. The shares rose 1.8 percent to
$10.70 yesterday, the highest level since May, on trading volume
that was more than three times the daily average over the past
three months.  The Micex will beat gains in other emerging markets for a
third month as high dividends and low volatility lure investors,
 Bruce Bower , a partner at Verno Capital in Moscow, which manages
about $200 million, said in an interview yesterday. Fifty-day
volatility on the Russian benchmark fell to the lowest level in
at least 10 years.  The ruble rallied 1.3 percent to 30.0260 versus the dollar
in January, and was little changed at 34.8597 yesterday against
the dollar-euro basket used by the central bank to manage swings
that hurt exporters. Ruble futures show the currency
strengthening 0.3 percent to 30.175 per dollar in Moscow today.  ‘Very Undervalued’  Russia’s economy will expand 3.5 percent in 2013, Deputy
Economy Minister  Andrei Klepach  said Jan. 29. Economic growth
slowed to 3.4 percent in 2012, from 4.3 percent in 2011, the
Federal Statistics Service said yesterday.  Putin, 60, returned to the presidency in May after a stint
as prime minister and  Human Rights Watch  said in a report issued
yesterday that the nation is waging the worst crackdown on civil
society since the Soviet Union’s collapse. Russia had the worst
score among the Group of 20 advanced economies in Transparency
International’s 2012 Corruption Perceptions Index.  “Russia is very undervalued,” Joseph Dayan, head of
markets at BCS Financial Corp. said in a Jan. 30 interview in
London. “Some foreign investors think that Putin will come and
take your money. This misperception from financial investors has
created an opportunity.”  United Co. Rusal (486) , the world’s largest aluminum producer,
lost 0.9 percent to HK$4.65 in Hong Kong, the lowest close since
Dec. 4. Rusal is based in Moscow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
