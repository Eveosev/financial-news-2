OAO RusHydro (HYDR) ,  Russia ’s biggest
renewable energy producer, has proposed creating a holding
company to modernize water and sewage systems.  “The main goal is to make the water and sewage systems
safe, to supply people uninterruptedly with drinking water of
quality,” Yelena Vishnyakova, a RusHydro spokeswoman, said
today by e-mail. Russia’s water system needs modernization as 55
percent of the infrastructure has surpassed its service life,
according to the regional development ministry’s website.  Russia’s government is considering the matter and will
submit final recommendations on RusHydro’s water proposal to
President Vladimir Putin by Feb. 10, Vishnyakova said.  State-run RusHydro dropped 2.5 percent today on the Micex,
the most since Nov. 8, on more than twice the average daily
three-month trading volume. VTB Capital cut RusHydro shares to
sell, saying the proposal raises risks of new spending and may
reduce dividends, according to an e-mailed note.  To contact the reporters on this story:
