Coffee growers in  Vietnam , the
biggest producer of the robusta beans used by  Nestle SA (NESN)  in
instant drinks, are limiting sales before the Tet Lunar New Year
festival to seek higher prices for a smaller crop.  Sales probably reached 570,000 metric tons, or 40 percent
of the harvest, less than the 45 percent sold a year earlier,
according to the median of eight trader and shipper estimates
compiled by Bloomberg. Production may have dropped 15 percent to
1.41 million tons from a record 1.65 million tons last season,
the survey shows.  Robusta has tumbled 7.9 percent since the end of September
when harvesting began in Vietnam after climbing 21 percent in
the first nine months as roasters switched from the more
 expensive  arabica variety. World coffee output will be 144.1
million 60-kilogram bags in 2012-2013, up 7.2 percent from a
year earlier, the  International Coffee Organization  said Jan. 9.
Robusta consumption will rise 6 percent to 66.6 million bags as
arabica advances 1 percent to 78.6 million, according to Volcafe.  “Farmers are holding back in anticipation that prices will
rise after Tet, especially with a smaller harvest,” said Mai Ky
Van, deputy director at October Coffee-Cocoa One Member Ltd.
“They had a good crop last year so they have the financial
resources to do so.”  Beans in  Dak Lak , the main growing region in Vietnam, were
39,300 dong ($1.89) a kilogram (2.2 pounds) yesterday, down 9.9
percent from last year’s high of 43,600 dong a kilogram in July,
 data  from the Daklak Trade & Tourism Center show.  Dry Weather  The harvest finished in mid-to-end December, two to three
weeks earlier than the previous crop because of dry weather,
traders said. The week-long Tet holiday will start Feb. 9.  Exports from  Indonesia ’s southern Sumatra, the main growing
region in the world’s third-largest robusta producer, may be
little changed this year amid threats to the crop from stormy
weather, the Association of Indonesian Coffee Exporters and
Industry said Jan. 30. Shipments from Lampung, Bengkulu and
South Sumatra gained 24 percent to 243,807 tons last year, said
Mochtar Luthfie, head of research and development at the
association’s Lampung chapter.  Robusta for delivery in March advanced 0.7 percent to
$2,023 a ton on NYSE Liffe in  London  at 5:01 p.m. Singapore time
today. Arabica for March rose 0.3 percent to $1.474 a pound on
ICE Futures U.S. in  New York . Robusta’s  discount  to arabica has
shrunk to 55.90 cents a pound from 145 cents at the end of 2011.  Robusta is harvested mainly in Asia and parts of Africa,
while arabica is grown in  Latin America  and favored for
specialty beverages such as those made by  Starbucks Corp. (SBUX)   To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
