The cost of insuring Asia-Pacific
corporate and sovereign bonds against non-payment rose,
according to traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  climbed three basis points to 114 basis
points as of 8:12 a.m. in Hong Kong,  Credit Agricole SA (ACA)  prices
show. The gauge is set for the highest close since Nov. 28,
according to data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index advanced two basis points
to 120 as of 10:57 a.m. in Sydney, according to  Westpac Banking
Corp. (WBC)  prices. The benchmark is poised for the highest close
since Jan. 1, according to CMA, which is owned by McGraw-Hill
Cos. and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the privately
negotiated market.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index climbed three to 137 as of
8:57 a.m. in  Tokyo , according to Deutsche Bank AG prices. The
measure is headed for the highest level in a week, CMA prices
show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
credit quality. A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
