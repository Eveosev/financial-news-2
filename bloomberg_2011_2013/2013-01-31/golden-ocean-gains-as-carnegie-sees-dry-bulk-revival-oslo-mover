Golden Ocean Group Ltd. (GOGL) , the
shipping company controlled by billionaire John Fredriksen, rose
the most in a week in Oslo trading after Carnegie Investment
Bank AB predicted a revival in the dry bulk market.  Shares in the Hamilton, Bermuda-based company rose as much
as much 3 percent, the most since Jan. 25, and climbed 1.3
percent to 5.41 kroner as of 12:31 a.m. in the Norwegian
capital. About 1.37 million shares had traded so far, compared
to a three-month daily average of 1.3 million.  “The dry bulk market is set for a pick-up in 2014,” Rune Sand, an analyst at Carnegie, said in an e-mailed note. “Golden
Ocean Group is one of very few owners with the financial
capacity to acquire tonnage in today’s market.”  Carnegie today raised its recommendation on the stock to
buy with a price target of 7 kroner.  The Baltic Dry Index, a measure of commodity shipping
costs, averaged 920 last year, the lowest since 1986, according
to figures from the Baltic Exchange, the London-based publisher
of freight rates. Fredriksen will continue to invest in
shipping, the industry that helped him build up his fortune, he
said in a Jan. 24 interview.  “Looking 1 to 2 years ahead, ship owners that don’t
currently have access to capital are going to start ordering new
ships,” Sand said. That “should lead to rising newbuilding
prices, which will benefit owners with the financial capacity to
take advantage of current depressed prices to acquire tonnage
early.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
