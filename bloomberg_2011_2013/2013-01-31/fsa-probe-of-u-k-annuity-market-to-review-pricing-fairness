The U.K. Financial Services
Authority has begun an investigation into whether consumers
buying annuities are getting a fair deal.  The FSA will conduct a pricing survey and review the
availability of policies, it said in a statement today. The
regulator may also probe whether companies selling annuities
hinder consumer choice.  Annuities sold by  life insurance  companies guarantee fixed
payments over a specified period of time. They are commonly used
by retirees who can use their pensions to buy an annual income.  “An annuity purchase is an important one-off decision that
has long term consequences for individuals if they get it
wrong,” Nick Poyntz-Wright, the FSA’s head of life insurance,
said in the statement. “We want to understand the level of the
potential detriment for consumers if they do not shop around.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
