First Solar Inc. (FSLR) , the biggest maker
of thin-film solar products, bought the 50-megawatt Macho
Springs project in New Mexico from Element Power Solar for an
undisclosed amount.  The Luna County project will be completed next year, the
Tempe, Arizona-based company said today in a statement.  El Paso
Electric Co. (EE)  plans to buy the output from the solar energy field
under a long-term contract that still needs state regulatory
approval.  To contact the reporter on this story:
