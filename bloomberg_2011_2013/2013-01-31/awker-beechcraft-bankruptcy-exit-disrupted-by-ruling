Hawker Beechcraft Inc.’s effort to
exit bankruptcy was disrupted after a judge refused to approve
part of the aircraft manufacturer’s restructuring plan.  U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Stuart Bernstein in  Manhattan  said at
a court hearing today that he would approve the plan while
rejecting terms for a Hawker unit that he said conflicted with
bankruptcy laws.  “The company is reviewing the relevant part of the plan
and will decide how best to address the judge’s concerns,”
Justin Dini, a Hawker spokesman, said in an e-mail.  The proposed plan would swap debt for equity and hand
ownership of Hawker to creditors. The Wichita, Kansas-based
company filed for bankruptcy in May, citing lower demand for
private jets after the recession and reductions in U.S. defense
spending.  Hawker sought court approval for the plan after a
$1.79 billion sale to Superior Aviation Beijing Co. collapsed in
October.  Bernstein’s objection stemmed from the bankruptcy plan’s
treatment of equity in the subsidiary, Hawker Beechcraft Corp.
The unit is an “operating entity,” Ross Kwasteniet, a Hawker
attorney, said at the hearing.  The case is In re Hawker Beechcraft Inc., 12-11873,  U.S.
Bankruptcy Court , Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
