Romania ’s leu weakened for a second
day, narrowing this month’s gain, after data on a stalled U.S.
economy hurt appetite for riskier emerging-market assets.  The leu depreciated 0.3 percent to 4.3960 per euro by 11:06
a.m. in Bucharest, trimming its advance in January to 1.3
percent, still the best among emerging-market currencies tracked
by Bloomberg. Yields on euro-denominated bonds due 2019 rose one
basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, at 3.94 percent.  Gross domestic product shrank at an annual rate of 0.1
percent during the fourth quarter, the U.S. Commerce Department
said yesterday. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke
signaled he isn’t close to easing up on $85 billion in monthly
bond purchases to spur the economy and bring down a 7.8 percent
unemployment rate.  “The eastern European currencies slipped into the red on
the back of disappointing fourth quarter U.S. GDP data, denting
risk appetite,” analysts at Bucharest-based  BRD-Groupe Societe
Generale SA (BRD)  wrote in a note today. “The leu went into retreat
yesterday and continues to err on the weaker side.”  Emerging-market stocks fell for a second day, paring a
monthly advance, after the U.S. economy unexpectedly contracted
and earnings from China Shipping Development Co. to  Macronix
International (2337)  Co. disappointed investors.  The analysts expect the leu to remain in a range of 4.37
per euro to 4.40 per euro today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
