BlackRock Inc. (BLK) , the world’s biggest
money manager, said it owns 8.2 percent of the common shares in
 Manchester United  Plc, the record 19-time English soccer
champion.  New York-based BlackRock disclosed ownership of about 3.26
million shares in the club in a U.S.  filing  dated Jan. 30.  Manchester United became the first sports franchise in the
world to be worth more than $3 billion, Forbes magazine said
this month, putting the soccer team’s enterprise value at $3.3
billion. The club is owned by the Glazer family, which in August
sold about 10 percent of the Manchester, England-based company
in an initial public offering.  Manchester United shares have surged 19 percent in  New York 
trading this year, giving the company a market value of $2.75
billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The stock
closed yesterday at $16.78. The Glazers sold shares at $14
apiece.  To contact the reporter on this story:
