The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot
Index of 24  raw materials  slid 0.1 percent to settle at 675.37
at 3:45 p.m. New York time, led by metals.  The UBS Bloomberg CMCI gauge of 26  prices  fell 0.1 percent
to 1,618.4.  PRECIOUS METALS  Gold futures posted the biggest drop in almost four weeks
as U.S. inflation concerns waned, eroding demand for the metal
as a hedge against rising consumer prices.  A government report today showed an index of inflation tied
to spending patterns was unchanged in December from November.
Excluding food and energy costs, consumer prices climbed 1.4
percent in 2012, compared with a 1.9 percent increase in the
previous year. Inflation “has been running somewhat below the
committee’s longer-run objective, apart from temporary
variations that largely reflect fluctuations in energy prices,”
the Federal Open Market Committee said yesterday.  On the Comex in New York, gold futures for April delivery

April delivery declined 0.8 percent to $1,675.40 an ounce.  Palladium futures for March delivery fell 0.8 percent to

jobless claims and a disappointing earnings forecast by United
Parcel Service Inc. signaled the recovery is making uneven
progress.  On the Comex, copper futures for delivery in March slipped
0.5 percent to $3.732 a pound, paring the monthly gain to 2.2
percent.  On the London Metal Exchange, copper for delivery in three
months dropped 0.7 percent to $8,165 a metric ton ($3.70 a
pound). Nickel, tin, aluminum, zinc and lead also declined.  GRAINS, OILSEEDS  Wheat futures fell the most in a week as export sales
tumbled 40 percent from the U.S., the world’s biggest shipper.  On the Chicago Board of Trade, wheat futures for March
delivery dropped 1 percent to $7.795 a bushel, the biggest
decline since Jan. 22.  Soybean futures for March delivery declined 0.7 percent to
$14.685 a bushel.  Corn futures for March delivery gained less than 0.1
percent to $7.405 a bushel.  CRUDE OIL  Crude oil fell for the first time in four days as claims
for U.S. unemployment benefits increased more than forecast,

a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange.  Total SA and Chevron Corp. both failed to buy North Sea
Forties crude for the third straight day as they lowered their
bids. There were no bids or offers for Urals grade for a second
day.  Refiners in Asia will trim imports of West African crude

the longest rally since July 2009 and as oil declined on concern
that a rise in jobless claims signaled weaker economic growth
and stagnant fuel demand.  On the Nymex, gasoline futures for February delivery
dropped 0.4 percent to $3.0258 a gallon.  Heating-oil futures for February delivery climbed 0.4
percent to $3.1298 a gallon.  NATURAL GAS  Natural gas rose for the second straight day after

percent to $3.339 per million British thermal units.  U.K. within-day gas rose 2.6 percent to 66.3 pence a therm
after closing yesterday at a three-week low.  SOFT COMMODITIES  Orange-juice futures jumped to a one-month high on concern
that dry weather and a crop disease will trim output in Florida,
the world’s second-biggest citrus grower.  On ICE Futures U.S. in New York, orange juice for March
delivery advanced 0.3 percent to $1.197 a pound. Earlier, the
