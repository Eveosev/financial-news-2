Golfer  Vijay Singh  said he used deer
antler spray without realizing it contained substances banned by
the U.S. PGA Tour.  Singh’s acknowledgment follows a Sports Illustrated article
alleging that the golfer and Baltimore Ravens linebacker  Ray Lewis  used the product. Lewis has denied the allegation.  “When I first received the product, I reviewed the list of
ingredients and did not see any prohibited substances,” Singh,
49, said in a statement released yesterday.  Deer antler spray contains IGF-1, a substance naturally
produced by the human body that’s related to growth hormone.  Singh is scheduled to play in the Phoenix Open, which
begins today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
