More than 100 people in Azerbaijan’s
central Imishli District rallied outside the local governor’s
office, demanding compensation for property damaged by flash
floods three years ago, the Turan news service said.  Regional governor Vilyam Haciyev held talks with some
participants in his office, the Baku-based agency said.  An Imishli official who asked not to be identified, citing
the administration’s policy, said no protests were held in the
district, 250 kilometers (155 miles) southwest of the capital,
Baku. The governor met locals to help resolve their problems,
she said by phone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
