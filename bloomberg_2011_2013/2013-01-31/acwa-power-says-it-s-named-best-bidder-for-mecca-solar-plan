ACWA Power International said its
offer to build a solar power plant in the Saudi Arabian city of
Mecca was deemed the best by municipal authorities running the
tender as they work toward a final decision to award a contract.  The company intends to push into solar power in  Saudi
Arabia  as the Kingdom prepares additional tenders this year,
Rohit Gokhale, director of acquisitions and project finance,
said at a conference in Dubai. ACWA last year bought a solar
plant in  Bulgaria  and is developing ones in  Morocco  and  South
Africa , helping it gain an understanding of the industry.  The Mecca municipality wants to build a plant as large as
100 megawatts, making it the first Saudi city to operate a
utility-scale plant generating power from renewables. The King
Abdullah City for Atomic and  Renewable Energy  aims to build
41,000 megawatts of power from renewables over the next two
decades, which would account for one third of the capacity the
country is forecast to have by that time.  Riyadh-based ACWA’s bid for the Mecca project was deemed
best since it pledged to build the plant, recover its investment
costs and turn over ownership of the facility to the city in a
time period shorter than other bidders, Gokhale said at the MEED
project finance conference in Dubai.  He didn’t specify the time or the price ACWA would charge
for power from the plant.  To contact the reporter on this story:
