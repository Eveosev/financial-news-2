Glencore International Plc (GLEN)  bought a
cargo of European  naphtha , bringing its purchases to at least 12
since the start of last week. Vitol sold at least 29 cargoes of
the fuel this month.  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  offloaded a cargo of European diesel
at a lower premium to February gasoil on the ICE Futures Europe
exchange in London. JPMorgan Chase & Co. was the most active
seller of heating oil in the barge market.  Light Products  Naphtha cargoes traded from $960 to $966 a metric ton,
compared with $961 a ton yesterday, according to a survey of
traders and brokers monitoring the Platts pricing window. Vitol
sold to Glencore and Trafigura Beheer BV. The fuel gained 3
percent this month.  Naphtha’s crack , or discount to Brent crude, widened to
$7.46 a barrel, as of 1:58 p.m. local time, according to PVM Oil
Associates Ltd., a London-based broker. That’s the biggest loss
in more than a week.  Gasoline in the Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp oil hub traded
from $1,056 to $1,062 a ton, according to the survey. The fuel
changed hands at as much as $1,068 yesterday, the highest since
Oct. 12. The Eurobob grade, to which ethanol is added before
being sold at the pump, advanced 12 percent so far this year.  Total SA (FP)  sold 10,000 tons, extending its selling spree to a
seventh session. Trafigura was a buyer and seller. Gunvor Group
Ltd., Shell,  BP Plc (BP/)  and OAO Lukoil’s Litasco unit bought barges,
which typically comprise 1,000 and 2,000 tons.  Gasoline’s  crack , or premium to Brent, rose to $14.04 a
barrel, PVM data showed. That’s the most since Sept. 28.  Middle Distillates  BP Plc bought a cargo of diesel, its second purchase from
Shell this week, according to the Platts survey. The shipment
changed hands at a $9 premium to February gasoil for delivery to
Amsterdam. That’s down from a trade at $13 on Jan. 29.  Barges of the fuel changed hands at $6 and $7 more than
February gasoil, the survey showed. That matches yesterday’s
three-year low. Glencore, JPMorgan and Shell were vendors to
Vitol and Total. The premiums slumped 61 percent this month.  Air France-KLM sold one barge of  jet fuel  to Morgan Stanley
at $78 a ton more than February gasoil, the Platts survey
showed. That’s up from a deal at $72 on Jan. 22.  A free-trade agreement between the European Union and
 Singapore  that removes taxes on jet fuel and diesel imports to
the continent will come into force as early as 2014, potentially
boosting petroleum shipments to the EU.  The full ratification process will take about two years
from Dec. 16, when a draft deal was reached, the Singapore Trade
Ministry said yesterday in an e-mail. The pact is similar to an
accord between the EU and South Korea that led to an
unprecedented flow of North Sea crude oil to the Asian nation.  JPMorgan was the main seller of  gasoil  and low-sulfur
heating oil, while Gunvor and Shell also sold, the Platts survey
showed. Vitol, Morgan Stanley and Trafigura bought. The higher-
sulfur fuel changed hands at discounts of $1 and $2 to February
gasoil, versus $1 yesterday. The low-sulfur grade traded at
premiums of $2 and $3, versus $3 and $4 yesterday.  Gasoil for February delivery gained for the fourth day,
rising $3.75 to $994.50 a ton as of 5:23 p.m.  London  time on the
ICE exchange. The contract advanced as much as $9.25, or 0.9
percent, to $995.50 yesterday, the highest since Oct. 19. The
futures are up 7 percent this month.  The contract’s premium, or backwardation, to March futures
widened 25 cents to $10.50 a ton, which was the widest since
Oct. 30. The market structure may signal declining near-term
supplies or increasing demand.  Gasoil’s  crack  was little changed at $16.76 as of 4:30 p.m.
yesterday. Brent rose 47 cents to $115.37 a barrel.  Residues  High-sulfur fuel oil changed hands from $629 to $630 a ton,
the survey of Platts showed. That compares with $621.50 to $622
in the previous session. The low-sulfur grade traded at $660 to
$662 a ton, versus $651 to $652 yesterday.  Refinery  Shell halted its 63,000 barrel-a-day Fredericia oil
refinery in  Denmark  after a fault in a furnace yesterday,
according to a report from the local newspaper Fredericia
Dagblad’s website.  Libya’s 220,000 barrel-a-day Ras Lanuf oil refinery resumed
operations after shutting last week, Abdulbari Al-Arusi, the
country’s oil minister, said yesterday in Tripoli. A deal has
been negotiated with plant workers who had been on strike since
Jan. 25, he said.  Libya’s largest refinery shut on Jan. 24 because of
technical problems, Abduljalil Mayuf, a spokesman for the state-
run Arabian Gulf Oil Co., said on Jan. 28.  To contact the reporter on this story:
