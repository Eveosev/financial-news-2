The lira gained for a third day as
 Turkey ’s trade deficit shrunk by 21 percent, spurring
expectations the nation’s  current-account deficit  will extend
its narrowing trend.  The currency strengthened 0.3 percent to 1.7928 per dollar
at 11:16 a.m. in Istanbul, its highest level on a closing basis
since Jan. 18. Yields on two-year benchmark bonds declined three
basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 5.8 percent, the
lowest level since Dec. 18.  The gap tightened to $84 billion in 2012 as exports jumped
13 percent and imports fell 1.8 percent, the Ankara-based state
statistics agency said on its website today. The monthly
shortfall was $7.18 billion, compared with a median estimate of
$9.45 billion in a Bloomberg survey. A widening of the current-
account deficit to 10 percent of gross domestic product
triggered an 18 percent depreciation in the lira in 2011, the
world’s biggest.  “The fall in the current-account deficit will continue in
December,” Gizem Oztok Altinsac, an Istanbul-based economist at
 Garanti Securities (GMBTAHV) , wrote in an e-mailed note today. “Following
today’s data, we estimate the current-account deficit to $5.2
billion in December, which brings the annual current-account
deficit to $50.5 billion.”  The lira rose 1.1 percent this month, the biggest monthly
gain since September, extending last year’s 6 percent
appreciation against the dollar. Moody’s Investors Service left
Turkey’s sovereign credit rating one level below investment
grade, saying “further progress” is needed in lowering the
current-account gap.  Yields on benchmark bonds dropped 38 basis points in
January as the central bank reduced its overnight  interest rates 
by 25 basis points on Jan. 22 on concern the lira may become
overvalued. Turkey’s stock and bond markets have attracted
inflows on bets of a second upgrade from Moody’s.  Central bank Governor Ercem Basci’s policies helped send
the lira’s volatility to the lowest level in more than 25 years,
as foreign investors bought more than $24 billion in Turkish
stocks and bonds in the past year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
