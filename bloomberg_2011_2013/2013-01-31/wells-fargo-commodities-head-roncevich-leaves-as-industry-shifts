John Roncevich, the former head of
 Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC) ’s commodities business, has left the lender
and formed a venture to advise banks on ways they can sidestep
some of the new regulations affecting the industry.  Roncevich departed in November after ceding oversight of
the business in July,  Elise Wilkinson , a bank spokeswoman, said
via e-mail today. Roncevich joined Wells Fargo through its 2008
purchase of Wachovia Corp. and ran the sales and trading of
physical commodities and derivatives. Pekka Kauranen now heads
commodities trading at the San Francisco-based firm.  U.S. bankers are facing new regulations as the Dodd-Frank
Act requires them to wall off some derivatives trades from units
backed by federal  deposit insurance . More than 64 bank units
have already registered as swap dealers under the Dodd-Frank
Act, which requires higher capital, collateral and trading
standards.  In his new firm, Roncevich will provide “services to banks
that allow them to deliver high-quality derivative, physical and
structured commodities products for their clients in a way that
eliminates or greatly reduces Dodd-Frank compliance costs and
risk,” according to his LinkedIn  profile .  Roncevich, who was based in Charlotte, North Carolina,
declined to comment. The trade publication SparkSpread
previously reported his departure.  To contact the reporter on this story:
