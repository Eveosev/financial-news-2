Occidental Petroleum Corp. (OXY) , the
largest onshore crude producer in the continental U.S., reported
profit that beat analysts’ estimates as domestic production
reached a record for the ninth consecutive quarter.  Excluding a $1.1 billion writedown for the value of natural
gas assets, fourth-quarter profit was $1.83 a share, exceeding
the average of 23  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg. Net income
fell 79 percent to $336 million, or 42 cents a share, from $1.63
billion, or $2.01, a year earlier, Los Angeles-based Occidental
said in a statement today.  Production costs fell $1.04 a barrel from the third
quarter. The company is about halfway to meeting its target of
cutting drilling costs 15 percent this year and may be able to
save more, Chief Executive Officer Stephen I. Chazen said in a
call with investors today.  “The company is making good progress already on getting
their costs back in line,” said Brian Youngberg, an analyst
with Edward Jones & Co. in  St. Louis , who rates Occidental a buy
and doesn’t own shares. “Investors are liking what they see so
far.”  Occidental  rose  3.5 percent to $88.27 at the close in  New
York , the most since Sept. 13. The shares have 18 buy and nine
hold ratings from analysts.  The company’s U.S. output rose to the equivalent of 475,000
barrels a day during the fourth quarter. Sales surged 2.3
percent to $6.17 billion. The company reported reserve additions
that amounted to 143 percent of its output for 2012.  Occidental plans to reduce spending 5.9 percent to $9.6
billion in 2013 while increasing U.S. oil production by 8 to 10
percent, Chazen said. He said gas output for the year is too
hard to forecast because of declining prices.  Occidental’s writedown of the value of its gas holdings
follows other energy producers, including BHP Billiton Ltd. and
Encana Corp., which have written down billions of dollars worth
of North American gas asset values amid a glut that pushed
prices to a 10-year low in April.  To contact the reporter on this story:
