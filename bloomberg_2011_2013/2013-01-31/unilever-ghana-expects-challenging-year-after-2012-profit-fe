Unilever Ghana Ltd. (UNIL) , a maker of
soaps, toothpaste and cooking oil in the West African nation,
said it continued to battle rising input costs that almost
halved profit in 2012.  “We envisage 2013 will be challenging as the conditions
which faced businesses in 2012 are not entirely behind us,” the
company, a unit of Netherlands-based  Unilever NV (UNA) , said in a
statement published in Ghana’s Daily Graphic newspaper.  Unilever said last year it wants to double its Africa
revenue within five years as it taps rising wages and consumer
spending in the fast-growing continent. Its brands include Dove
soap, Lipton tea and Wall’s icecream.  Unilever Ghana’s net income decreased 44 percent to 16.7
million cedis ($8.8 million) in 2012, the company said. Revenue
grew 18 percent to 282.1 million cedis.  “Profit was mainly impacted by high input costs driven by
the depreciation of the local currency,” Unilever  Ghana  said.
Rising fuel and energy costs as well as “significant increases
in capital expenditure” also contributed, it said.  “With expectations that the currency will stabilize this
year, we expect a turnaround of the situation for profit to
grow,” Xorlali Torsu, a trader at Databank Financial Services
Ltd. in Accra, said by phone.  The cedi weakened 14 percent in 2012 and has remained
broadly level in the month to date. Unilever Ghana’s shares
traded unchanged at 10 cedis as of 2:21 p.m. in Accra.  To contact the reporter on this story:
