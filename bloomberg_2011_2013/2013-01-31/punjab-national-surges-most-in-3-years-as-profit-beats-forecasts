Punjab National Bank (PNB) , India’s third-
largest lender, surged the most in more than three years after
reporting earnings that beat analysts’  estimates .  The shares gained 9.4 percent to 912.10 rupees in Mumbai,
the biggest gain since May 18, 2009, making it the best
performer on the 236-company  FTSE All-World Banks Index. (AWBANKU)   Profit at the state-run lender beat analysts’ forecasts by
13 percent as its asset quality improved. Net soured debt
narrowed to 2.56 percent of loans at the end of December, from
2.69 percent on Sept. 30, according to an exchange  filing .  “PNB is finally turning the corner in terms of
profitability,” said Hatim Broachwala, a Mumbai-based analyst
at Karvy Stock Broking Ltd. “Rough patch seems to be over for
the bank. Investors are enthused as profits were much better
than expected and bad loans fell.”  Net income  at the New Delhi-based lender climbed 14 percent
to 13.1 billion rupees ($246 million), or 38.49 rupees a share,
for the three months ended Dec. 31, from 11.5 billion rupees, or
36.30 rupees, a year earlier, the lender said today. That
surpassed the 11.6 billion rupee median of analysts’ estimates
compiled by Bloomberg.  The bank’s total outstanding loans increased by 13.2
percent from a year earlier to 2.97 trillion rupees at the end
of December. Bank loans in  India , excluding advances made to
state agencies for food procurement, expanded 15.1 percent in
the 12 months to Dec. 28,  data  compiled by central bank shows.  To contact the reporter on this story:
