Leitwind SpA, the Italian-based
wind-energy company, started a wind farm in Apulia with enough
power for 18,000 homes.  The 24-megawatt Deliceto venture cost 45 million euros ($61
million) to build, said Michaela Brugger, a spokeswoman at the
Sterzing, northern Italy-based company. She didnâ€™t disclose
further details.  Leitwind was hired by Elce Energia SpA to install the 16,
1.5-megawatt turbines under an accord including a 15-year
service contract, the company said in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
