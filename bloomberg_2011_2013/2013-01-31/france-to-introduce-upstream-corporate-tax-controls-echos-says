The French finance ministry plans to
test a program this year where the tax authority would audit
companies as they prepare their tax returns,  Les Echos  reported,
without citing anyone.
*Companies will be expected to share a maximum of financial
information as they’re preparing their returns, the newspaper
said
*In return, companies will receive greater fiscal and judicial
security, the newspaper said.
*This year’s test will cover a dozen voluntary candidates, and
in 2014 will be offered generally to any company that wants to
participate, the newspaper said.
*Plan is part of a Competitivity Pact announced Nov. 6.  To contact the reporter on this story:
