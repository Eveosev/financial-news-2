Renewable-energy capacity in the
U.S. almost doubled from 2009 to 2012, helping reduce the
nation’s carbon-dioxide emissions last year to the lowest since
1994, according to a Bloomberg New Energy Finance report.  The cumulative installed solar, wind, geothermal and
biomass-based energy sources in the U.S. climbed to 85.7
gigawatts in 2012, compared with 43.5 gigawatts in 2008, the
London-based research company said in a report today.  Because the U.S. has reduced  carbon emissions  by 13 percent
from a high of 6.02 gigatons in 2007, it’s gained credibility in
global negotiations aimed at curbing  climate change , Ethan Zindler, a New Energy Finance analyst based in Washington, said
yesterday. Natural gas consumption increased as the use of coal
and oil declined, according to the report.  “That has implications for the U.S. as it seeks to press
other nations, namely  China , to use energy more efficiently and
lower its emissions,” Zindler said by e-mail.  U.S. energy consumption fell 6.4 percent from 2007 to 2012
as new, energy-efficient commercial buildings were built and
older ones were retrofitted. There have also been “greater
efforts from consumers to cut energy use,” including
significant growth in sales of hybrid and electric vehicles,
Zindler said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
