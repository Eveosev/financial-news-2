Chile´s unemployment rate fell to
6.1 percent in the three months through December as hiring
picked up in the farming and mining industries, the National
Statistics Institute said.  The median estimate of 15 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg
was for the jobless rate to fall to 6 percent from 6.2 percent
in the three months through November. Unemployment declined from
6.6 percent at the end of 2011, the institute said in a report
today.  The improving jobs market has helped fuel an increase in
 consumer spending  that offset the slower increase in
manufacturing last year. According to a separate study by the
 Universidad de Chile  released last week, unemployment in
Santiago dropped to 5.2 percent in December, the lowest since
June 1973.  “Data shows a dual speed of growth between sectors tied to
internal demand and those more exposed to external conditions,”
Sebastian Senzacqua, an analyst at BICE Inversiones, wrote in a
note e-mailed to investors yesterday. “Still, we anticipate
that early on in the year household consumption may show a
certain degree of moderation.”  The peso fell 0.2 percent to 472.00 per  U.S. dollar  at 9:06
a.m. local time.  The manufacturing index, which includes production of food,
wood products and chemicals, rose 2.4 percent last year while
retail sales surged 8.8 percent, the institute said in a
separate report published yesterday.  Gross domestic product increased an estimated 5.45 percent
last year, the fastest pace in  South America  behind  Peru ,
according to analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. GDP gains will slow
to about 4.5 percent from 2012, according to the poll.  To contact the reporter on this story:
