Perion Networks Ltd. (PERI)  advanced the
most in three weeks as a person familiar with negotiations said
its contract with  Google Inc. (GOOG)  will be extended by four months.
The agreement is set to expire today.  Perion shares jumped 7.5 percent, the most since Jan. 10,
to 42.9 shekels ($11.53) at the close in Tel Aviv. The shares
dropped 11 percent last week. Perion’s U.S.-traded shares
tumbled the most in 14 months on Jan. 23 on concern the
partnership with Google will be terminated.  The company’s contract with Google will be extended until
May 31, according to the person, who asked not to be identified
due to the sensitivity of the negotiations. That is the
expiration date of the search engine’s contract with SweetPacks,
an Israeli producer of free Internet applications, which Perion
bought in November. The extension was suggested by Google, the
person said. No one at Perion was available to comment.  The company sells e-mail, photo sharing and Internet
security products that often come packaged with Google’s search
engine. The Tel Aviv-based application provider’s user policies
have also received approval from the world’s no. 1 search
engine, according to the person.  To contact the reporter on this story:
