Ryder System Inc. (R)  rose to the
highest price in a year after the largest publicly traded truck
lessor predicted higher 2013 earnings than analysts estimated.  The forecast of  $4.70 to $4.85  a share compares with an
average projection of $4.57. That excludes non-operating pension
expenses of 24 cents, which Ryder began removing from comparable
earnings-per-share data this year, according to a statement.  Ryder has been buoyed as a recovering U.S. economy spurs
customers to renew leases, helping the truck lessor improve
rates and trim maintenance costs,  Art Hatfield , of Raymond James
Financial Inc., said in a telephone interview. The Miami-based
company projected sales this year will jump about 3.9 percent to
about $6.5 billion. That’s in line with estimates of about $6.47
billion.  “The truck market and truck-related things are going to
continue to improve a little bit as we get into 2013,” said
Hatfield, who’s based in  Memphis ,  Tennessee . Customers prone to
extending their leases as long as possible during the slump,
which drove up maintenance costs, “are feeling a little bit
better about life and so as vehicles are coming to the end of
their lease, they’re renewing.”  Ryder  rose  4.6 percent to $56.78 at the close in New York,
the highest price since Feb. 1.  Fourth-quarter profit excluding restructuring costs and
vehicle losses from  Hurricane Sandy  was $1.17 a share,
surpassing the $1.10 average  estimate  compiled by Bloomberg.
Sales climbed 2.8 percent to $1.58 billion, higher than the
$1.56 billion average projection.  Share Buyback  Net income, including a $5.1 million after-tax charge for
damages from Sandy as well as other items, rose 12 percent to
$53.8 million, or $1.05 a share. Profit on the same basis a year
earlier was $48.1 million, or 93 cents.  Ryder is pausing its plan to buy back as many as 2 million
shares after pension charges drove the company’s ratio of total
obligations to equity to 270 percent, Robert Sanchez, who
replaced Greg Swienton as chief executive officer on Jan. 1,
said on a conference call today.  Suspending the buyback program will help Ryder “maintain
near-term balance sheet flexibility,” he said. The company
expects to reinstate the stock buybacks “at some point in the
future,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
