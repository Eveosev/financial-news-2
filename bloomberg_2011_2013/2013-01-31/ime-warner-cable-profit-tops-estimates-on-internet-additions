Time Warner Cable Inc. (TWC) , the second-
largest U.S. cable-television operator, fell the most in almost
four years after its 2013 earnings forecast missed estimates.  Time Warner Cable  fell  11 percent to $89.34 at the close in
New York, where it’s based. That was the biggest one-day drop
since March 9, 2009.  Adjusted earnings per share will grow 10 percent to 15
percent this year to a range of $6.33 to $6.61, Time Warner
Cable said today. That missed the average estimate of $6.91, or
20 percent growth, of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Profit margins will probably be crimped this year on rising
programming costs, such as fees to carry sports channels, and a
decline in political advertising, Chief Financial Officer Irene Esteves said in a conference call. Time Warner Cable has struck
billion-dollar deals to carry the games of the Los Angeles
Lakers and Dodgers, agreements Chief Executive Officer Glenn Britt said would contain long-term rate increases, justifying an
“expensive” price tag.  This year’s forecast “appears a bit soft,”  Marci Ryvicker , a New York-based analyst at Wells Fargo & Co., said in
a note to clients. She has the equivalent of a buy rating on the
shares.  Fourth-quarter earnings per share were $1.57, beating the
$1.55 average analyst estimate compiled by Bloomberg. Sales rose
9.9 percent from a year earlier to $5.5 billion, in line with
the $5.51 billion average analyst estimate.  Internet Gains  Time Warner Cable added 75,000 residential high-speed data
subscribers and gained 14,000 business customers for the
services, it said today in a statement. Average sales per
customer increased as the New York-based cable provider
announced a $3.95-a-month fee for renting its wireless modems in
the quarter, allowing the company to generate more revenue from
the service.  Fourth-quarter net income  fell  to $513 million, or $1.68 a
share, from $564 million, or $1.75 a share, a year earlier, the
company said.  The cable operator lost 129,000 residential video
 customers . The basic cable subscriber base has declined every
quarter since 2009 as customers switch to TV services offered by
phone and satellite companies.  Time Warner Cable repurchased 6 million shares in the
fourth quarter for $571 million, up from the previous quarter’s
$500 million.  Ryvicker said Time Warner Cable’s potential capital return
may also be affected if it acquires  Cablevision Systems Corp. (CVC) ’s
Optimum West division, which serves about 300,000 customers in
states including Montana and  Colorado . Time Warner Cable made a
first-round bid on the business in December, people familiar
with the matter said then.  To contact the reporter on this story:
