Rio Tinto Group, the world’s second-
biggest mining company, declared force majeure on contracts to
sell coal from its Kestrel mine in  Australia  after flooding from
ex-tropical cyclone Oswald damaged a rail system.  The Blackwater rail network, which carries the second-
largest tonnages in Queensland state, may be closed for as much
as 10 days starting Jan. 29,  Aurizon Holdings Ltd. (AZJ) , the network
operator, said today in an e-mailed statement. The line, which
transports coal to the state’s port of Gladstone, was closed on
Jan. 26, according to Aurizon.  Floodwaters have left six people dead, disrupted mining
operations and damaged sugarcane fields in Queensland.  Xstrata
Plc (XTA) , the world’s largest exporter of thermal coal, declared
force majeure on Jan. 29 because of damage to the rail line. The
clause is invoked by companies when they miss shipments because
of circumstances beyond their control.  Rio is monitoring updates from its service providers
regarding the expected duration of rail repairs, the company
said in a statement on its  website  yesterday. All sites managed
by the company are operating and working toward normal
production, it said.  One of two coal-ship loaders at the port of Gladstone
resumed operations on Jan. 27, an e-mailed statement from harbor
authorities said on Jan 29. Kylie Lee, a spokeswoman for
Gladstone Ports Corp., didn’t immediately respond to a phone
message and e-mail seeking comment about loading operations.  To contact the reporters on this story:
