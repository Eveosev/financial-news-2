The construction of two new reactors
at Mochovce nuclear plant by  Enel SpA (ENEL) ’s Slovak unit will cost
more than planned and will be delayed by two years,  Sme 
reported, citing Economy Minister Tomas Malatinsky.  The project is set to be completed by 2015, compared with
the original deadline of 2013, while costs are expected to rise
to 3.7 billion euros ($5 billion) from the originally estimated
2.8 billion euros, the newspaper quoted Malatinsky as saying.  The plant is operated by Slovenske Elektrarne AS, in which
Enel owns 66 percent and the Slovak government holds the rest.
The company will not pay dividends until 2018 to cover the
project’s costs, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
