Thailand ’s baht headed for the
biggest monthly advance since July 2011 as international
investors increased holdings of the nation’s assets, while the
central bank upgraded its economic growth forecast.  The currency touched a 17-month high in January as global
funds pumped more than $4.3 billion into sovereign debt and
equities, official data show. The Bank of Thailand said on Jan.
18 that gross domestic product will increase 4.9 percent in 2013,
compared with an October estimate of 4.6 percent, citing rising
exports, domestic consumption and investment.  “Amid risk-on sentiment in the market, funds have been
coming to the region,” said  Yuji Kameoka , chief currency
strategist at Daiwa Securities Co. in  Tokyo . “In addition,
Thailand’s relatively stronger economic condition attracts more
funds, putting appreciation pressure on the baht.”  The baht strengthened 2.7 percent in January, the second-
best performance after  India ’s rupee among Asia’s 11 most-active
currencies. It fell 0.1 percent to 29.77 per dollar today as of
9:09 a.m. in Bangkok, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The currency touched 29.66 earlier, matching the level
touched on Jan. 21 that was the strongest since August 2011.
One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves in the
 exchange rate  used to price options, climbed 151 basis points,
or 1.51 percentage points, to 5.42 percent this month, erasing
December’s decline. It dropped five basis points today.  A central bank report today may show the current account
turned to a deficit of $700 million in December from a surplus
of $392 million the previous month, according to the median
forecast of economists in a Bloomberg survey before data due at
2:30 p.m. local time.  Trade numbers will also be released. Overseas shipments
rose 27 percent in November, compared with 14 percent in October.
Exports contracted in seven of the nine months through September.  Government bonds  fell this month even after investors added
to their holdings. The yield on the 3.625 percent notes maturing
in June 2023 rose 20 basis points to 3.74 percent, data compiled
by Bloomberg show. The rate was little changed today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
