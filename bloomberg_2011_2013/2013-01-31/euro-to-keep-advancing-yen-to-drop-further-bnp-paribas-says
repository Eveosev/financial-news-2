The euro may strengthen to $1.40 by
the third quarter of this year, the highest level since 2011, as
positive sentiment persists toward  Europe ’s 17-nation currency
bloc, according to BNP Paribas SA.  The Paris-based bank said it expects “sustained” yen
weakness this year, saying  Japan ’s prime minister will probably
push successfully for a weaker currency, more monetary easing
and budgetary expansion as he seeks to spur economic growth in
the nation. The yen and euro outlooks were detailed in a client
note by BNP currency strategists including Michael Sneyd and
 Steven Saywell  in  London  and Vassili Serebriakov in  New York .  “All of our measures of euro-zone stress support further
gains, while European Central Bank data on portfolio flows
signal a reversal of the 2012 declining trend back toward larger
net inflows,” the strategists wrote.  The euro touched $1.3594 today in New York, the strongest
level since June 2010, before trading at $1.3578. It last traded
at $1.40 in October 2011. BNP previously forecast it would trade
at $1.35 in the third quarter.  The shared currency will continue gaining as demand for
European peripheral sovereign bonds increases and the U.S.
Federal Reserve continues to weaken the greenback as it buys $85
billion of bonds a month under quantitative easing to fuel
American economic growth, the strategists wrote.  Yen Decline  The yen will probably weaken to 95 per dollar in the first
three months of 2013, they wrote, before strengthening to 85 per
dollar by year-end. The Japanese currency will fall in the first
quarter of 2014 to 92 as the  Bank of Japan (8301)  begins an open-ended
asset-purchasing program designed to make the economy more
competitive. BNP previously forecast the yen would trade at 83
per dollar by the end of the first quarter.  The yen has lost 13 percent against the dollar over the
past three months, data compiled by Bloomberg show. It
depreciated 0.5 percent today to 91.54 to the greenback and
touched 91.59, the weakest level since June 2010.  “We expect sustained weakness in the yen because of Prime
Minister Shinzo Abe’s aggressive policy changes,” the BNP
analysts wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
