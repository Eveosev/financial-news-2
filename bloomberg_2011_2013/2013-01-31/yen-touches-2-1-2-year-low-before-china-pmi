The yen depreciated to its weakest
level in 2 1/2 years against the dollar and euro amid
speculation Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will select a new  Bank of
Japan (8301)  governor who will boost monetary stimulus.  Japan ’s currency headed for 12th weekly decline versus the
dollar as a report showed the jobless rate climbed and
household spending fell. The euro strengthened for a fourth day
against the greenback as data showed manufacturing in the
17-nation region shrank less in January than earlier estimated.
The krona rose to a five-month high as  Sweden’s manufacturing 
improved in December. The Dollar Index fell before a report that
economists said will show U.S. employers added more workers.  Speculation about a new Bank of Japan governor “is the
number-one source of the move we have seen in the yen,” said
Peter Frank, global head of foreign-exchange strategy in  London 
at  Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA. (BBVA)  “Because you are having
that at the same time as strong equities, strong risk-on news
flow generally, the yen is doubly weak.”  The yen sank 0.5 percent to 92.13 per dollar at 7:33 a.m.
 New York  time, after earlier touching 92.30, the weakest since
June 2010. It slid 1 percent to 125.74 per euro, after being as
low as 126.16, the least since April 2010.  The euro gained 0.5 percent to $1.3648, after being as
strong as $1.3675, the most since Nov. 14, 2011. Yesterday it
completed the longest stretch of monthly advances against the
dollar since May 2003.  Inflation Target  Japanese Economy Minister Akira Amari told reporters in
 Tokyo  today that Abe may be narrowing the list of candidates to
replace BOJ Governor  Masaaki Shirakawa , whose term ends in
April. Amid government pressure, the central bank last month
doubled its inflation target to 2 percent and announced open-
ended asset purchases to begin next year.  Kikuo Iwata, a Gakushuin University economics professor and
a potential candidate to be the next BOJ governor, told
lawmakers yesterday that deflation and the strong yen can be
overcome with monetary policy alone.  Japan’s Labor Force Survey showed the nation’s unemployment
rate climbed to 4.2 percent in December from 4.1 percent in the
previous month. A separate report indicated spending among
households fell 0.7 percent in the same period from a year
earlier.  Employment Report  The yen has fallen 7.1 percent this year, the biggest
decline among 10 developed-market currencies tracked by
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The dollar lost 0.6
percent and the euro climbed 3.2 percent.  Traders may “be concluding that the U.S. employment report
will be supportive for dollar-yen later today while there is
also some increased focus on the potential nominations for the
three key BOJ posts,”  Derek Halpenny , European head of currency
research at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd. in London, wrote
in a client note today.  A gauge of manufacturing in the 17-nation euro area rose to
47.9 from 46.1 in December, London-based Markit Economics said
today, above an  initial estimate  of 47.5 on Jan. 24. The reading
has been below the 50 level that indicates contraction for 18
months.  Europe ’s common currency maintained gains as the European
Central Bank said banks will repay 3.5 billion euros of its
emergency three-year loans next week. A total of 27 financial
institutions will use the second opportunity for early repayment
of the initial three-year loan, the Frankfurt-based ECB said in
a statement today. Banks returned 137.2 billion euros of long-
term funds this week.  Dollar Index  “Positive sentiment towards the euro has exceeded even our
own robust expectations and we believe this trend will
continue,”  Steven Saywell , the London-based head of currency
strategy for Europe at BNP Paribas SA, wrote in a note to
clients yesterday. The bank sees the currency at $1.38 by year-
end, up from a previous estimate of $1.32, according to the
report.  The Dollar Index, which Intercontinental Exchange Inc. uses
to track the greenback against the currencies of six major U.S.
trade partners, fell 0.2 percent to 79.031.  The U.S. Labor Department will say employers hired 165,000
new workers last month, the most since August, following a
155,000 gain in December, according to the median forecast of 90
economists surveyed by Bloomberg ahead of today’s release. The
unemployment rate in January held at 7.8 percent, where it’s
been since November, the survey showed.  Bond Purchases  Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke signaled this week
that he isn’t close to easing up on $85 billion in monthly bond
purchases, which tend to debase the greenback, to spur growth
and bring down unemployment. The central bank also left
unchanged its statement that it plans to hold its target
interest rate near zero as long as the jobless rate stays above
6.5 percent and inflation remains no more than 2.5 percent.  The currencies of  Sweden  and Norway both strengthened as
reports showed manufacturing improved  Sweden’s  purchasing managers’ index  rose to 49.2 in January
from 44.6 the previous month,  Swedbank AB (SWEDA) , which compiles the
index, said today. Norway’s index rose to 50.5 from 50,
indicating  manufacturing  expanded for a third month,  Danske Bank
A/S (DANSKE)  said.  Sweden’s krona climbed 0.9 percent to 6.3033 against the
dollar, after strengthening to 6.2880, the strongest level since
Aug. 30, 2011.  The Norwegian krone advanced 0.4 percent to
5.4456.  To contact the reporters on this story:
