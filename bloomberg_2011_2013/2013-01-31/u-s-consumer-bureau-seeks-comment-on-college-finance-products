The U.S. Consumer Financial
Protection Bureau is seeking input on the impact of financial
products marketed to students through colleges and universities,
the agency said in an e-mailed statement today.  “We have seen many colleges establish relationships with
financial institutions to offer banking services to their
students,”  Richard Cordray , the bureau’s director, said in the
statement. “The bureau wants to find out whether students using
college-endorsed banking products are getting a good deal.”  A 2009 law on credit cards restricted some kinds of
marketing practices on college campuses, according to CFPB. The
bureau is seeking information in particular on other kinds of
products, such as student identification cards that can be used
as debit cards, cards that tap scholarships and  student loans ,
and bank accounts affiliated with a particular school, according
to the statement.  The agency is  seeking  public comments through March 18
about student experiences with the products, fees charged, how
the deals are set up, information shared with financial
companies when they work with a school and how the products are
marketed to students.  To contact the reporter on this story:
