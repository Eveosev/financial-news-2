Chelsea midfielder Eden Hazard won’t
have the three-match ban given to him for kicking a ball boy
increased, the Football Association said.  Hazard received a red card for kicking at the boy when he
wouldn’t give the ball back late in the League Cup semifinal at
Swansea on Jan. 23. The boy fell on the ball as Hazard tried to
retrieve it, with the Belgian then trying to kick it from under
the teenager.  The red card brought an automatic three-match suspension
and Hazard was then accused of violent conduct by the F.A.,
which said the standard ban was insufficient. Hazard denied the
charge and a hearing was held today.  “Following a hearing earlier today, an independent
regulatory commission was of the opinion the existing three-
match sanction for this offence was sufficient,” the F.A. said
in a  statement .  Hazard sat out Chelsea’s F.A. Cup fourth-round match at 
Brentford four days ago and last night's league game at Reading. 
He’ll also miss this weekend's Premier League match at Newcastle.  To contact the reporter on this story:
