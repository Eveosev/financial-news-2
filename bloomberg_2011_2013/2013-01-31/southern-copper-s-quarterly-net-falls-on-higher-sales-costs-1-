Southern Copper Corp. (SCCO) , the largest
producer of the metal in Peru and  Mexico , said fourth-quarter
profit fell as rising costs offset higher metals prices.  Net income slipped 1 percent to $531.8 million, or 63 cents
a share, from $537 million, or 63 cents, a year earlier, the
Phoenix-based company said in a statement today. Profit exceeded
the 60-cent average of three  analysts’ estimates  compiled by
Bloomberg.  Sales fell 1.1 percent to $1.65 billion. Copper futures in
New York averaged 5.6 percent higher in the quarter than a year
ago, while silver prices gained 2.4 percent. The cost of sales
rose 8.5 percent after the company cut third-party copper
concentrate purchases by 85 percent.  “It was a pretty flat quarter, with a slight gain in
prices,” Bruno Kresevic, an analyst at NCF Inversiones SA who
doesn’t own the shares or rate them, said in a phone interview
from  Lima . “Rising costs are an issue.”  Quarterly copper production from the company’s own mines
climbed 1.5 percent to 163,799 metric tons, while zinc and
silver output increased by 11.4 percent and 0.4 percent,
respectively. Molybdenum output fell 9.6 percent.  The company, which is 81-percent owned by Grupo Mexico SAB,
plans to increase copper production capacity 84 percent to 1.18
million tons by 2017. Copper for March delivery fell 0.5 percent
to $3.732 a pound today on the Comex in New York.  The report was released after the close of regular trading
on U.S. markets.  Southern Copper  rose 0.5 percent to $39.39 at
the close in New York. The stock has gained 15 percent in the
past year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
