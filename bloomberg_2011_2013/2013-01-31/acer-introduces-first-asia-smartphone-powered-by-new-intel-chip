Acer Inc. (2353)  introduced the Liquid C1
in Thailand, the first smartphone in Asia to use a new version
of  Intel Corp. (INTC) ’s Atom processor.  The phone, costing 9,990 baht ($335), has a 4.3-inch
touchscreen and an 8-megapixel camera, according to a statement
from the companies today. The Atom Z2420-powered device is being
debuted in Thailand as part of the Taipei-based computer-maker’s
push to expand in Southeast Asia, said Henry Wang, a spokesman.  The handset is the ninth Atom model to be introduced
worldwide in the past nine months as Intel seeks to pare its
reliance on making chips for the shrinking personal-computer
market. The Santa Clara, California-based company has less than
1 percent of the market for phone processors, compared with a
more than 80 percent share in the PC-chip market.  Acer intends to boost smartphone sales to 5 million units
in 2014 from 500,000 last year, President  Jim Wong  said in an
interview earlier this month. The company is targeting the
mobile-device market as consumers shun PCs for tablets.  Lenovo Group Ltd., Google Inc.’s Motorola Mobility and  ZTE
Corp. (763)  are among other phonemakers to have introduced Atom-
powered devices.  To contact the reporters on this story:
