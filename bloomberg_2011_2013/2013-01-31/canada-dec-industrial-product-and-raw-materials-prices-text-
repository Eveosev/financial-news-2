The following is the text of the
industrial product and raw material prices report as reported
by  Statistics Canada .  In December, the Industrial Product Price Index (IPPI) was
unchanged compared with November. An increase in primary metal
products (+0.9%) was offset mainly by a decline in motor
vehicles and other transportation equipment (-0.5%). The Raw
Materials Price Index (RMPI) fell 2.0%, largely because of lower
prices for crude oil.  Industrial Product Price Index, monthly change  The IPPI was unchanged in December following two
consecutive declines. Of the 21 major commodity groups, 6 were
up, 11 were down, and 4 were unchanged.  Primary metal products (+0.9%) posted the largest gain,
resulting from price increases for aluminum products (+2.6%),
copper and copper alloy products (+3.1%) and nickel products
(+6.0%). The advance in metals was partly due to signs of
increased economic activity in  China .  Other commodities that posted increases included lumber and
other wood products (+1.0%), pushed upward by higher prices for
lumber and ties (+2.0%).  The largest price decline was in motor vehicles and other
transportation equipment (-0.5%), which offset most of the
increases observed in the IPPI. The decline was largely because
of the appreciation of the Canadian dollar relative to the US
dollar.  Some Canadian producers who export their products report
their prices in US dollars. Consequently, the 0.7% rise in the
Canadian dollar against the US dollar in December could have the
effect of reducing the corresponding prices in Canadian dollars.
Without the measurable effect of the exchange rate, the IPPI
would have increased 0.2% instead of remaining unchanged.  Petroleum and coal products (-0.5%) moved downward in
December, primarily because of lower prices for gasoline (-1.5%).  Industrial Product Price Index, 12-month change  Compared with December 2011, the IPPI was up 0.2%, the
first year-over-year increase in five months.  Upward pressure was exerted on the index mainly by an
increase in lumber and other wood products (+8.7%), largely
because of higher prices for lumber and ties (+13.1%). On a
year-over-year basis, prices for lumber and other wood products
have increased every month since February 2012.  Among the other products that contributed to the IPPI
increase were meat, fish and dairy products (+1.1%), petroleum
and coal products (+0.4%) as well as rubber, leather and plastic
fabricated products (+1.2%).  Conversely, the year-over-year increase of the index was
moderated by motor vehicles and other transportation equipment
(-1.6%). The decline was primarily a result of the appreciation
of the Canadian dollar against the US dollar compared with
December 2011.  The 3.5% year-over-year increase in the value of the
Canadian dollar relative to the US dollar may have the effect of
lowering the IPPI. Without the measurable effect of the exchange
rate, the index would have risen 1.0% instead of 0.2%.  The advance of the IPPI was also partly moderated by pulp
and paper products, fabricated metal products and chemical
products.  Raw Materials Price Index, monthly change  The RMPI was down 2.0% in December, the third consecutive
decline.  The decrease of the index was almost entirely attributable
to lower prices for mineral fuels, specifically crude oil (-
5.9%). The RMPI excluding mineral fuels rose 0.9% in December.  Among the other product groups that declined was vegetable
products (-0.9%), resulting from lower prices for grain,
particularly corn and wheat.  The downward movement of the RMPI was partly moderated by
non-ferrous metals (+2.7%), mainly because of higher prices for
copper concentrates (+4.2%).  Animals and animal products and ferrous materials also
slowed the decline of the RMPI.  Raw Materials Price Index, 12-month change  Compared with December 2011, the RMPI was down 8.0%. On a
year-over-year basis, the index has not recorded an increase
since February 2012.  The decline of the RMPI was largely because of mineral
fuels, specifically crude oil (-18.3%). The RMPI excluding
mineral fuels rose 1.4% on a year-over-year basis, the first
increase since November 2011.  Other commodity groups that posted year-over-year declines
were ferrous materials, non-metallic minerals, and animals and
animal products.  Compared with December 2011, the decline of the RMPI was
moderated slightly by non-ferrous metals (+3.1%), vegetable
products (+4.5%) and wood products (+3.2%).  2012 in review  Industrial Product Price Index  For 2012 as a whole, the IPPI was up 0.5% on average
compared with 2011. It was the third consecutive annual increase.
The index previously posted gains of 1.0% in 2010 and 4.7% in
2011.  Most commodities posted price increases in 2012. Of the 21
major product groups, 17 were up and 4 were down.  The largest contributor to the growth of the index in 2012
was the lumber and other wood products group (+5.5%), as a
result of higher prices for lumber and timber (+8.0%), veneer
and plywood (+7.8%) and other wood fabricated materials (+3.3%).
The advance in prices of wood products was partly a result of
stronger domestic demand, as the number of housing units under
construction in Canada increased compared with 2011.  Petroleum and coal products (+1.7%) also exerted
significant upward pressure on the IPPI, primarily because of
higher prices for gasoline (+3.4%) as well as  fuel oil  and other
fuels (+1.1%). Gasoline prices were up for the third year in a
row.  Other commodity groups that posted increases included fruit,
vegetables, feeds and other food products (+3.0%) and motor
vehicles and other transportation equipment (+1.0%).  The advance in fruit, vegetables and feeds was mainly
attributable to higher prices for fruit and vegetable
preparations (+2.3%) and feeds (+7.0%).  The increase in motor vehicles and other transportation
equipment was largely because of the depreciation of the
Canadian dollar against the US dollar. In 2012, the Canadian
dollar was down an average of 1.0% relative to the US dollar.  The growth of the IPPI was moderated mainly by the primary
metal products group (-6.2%), as there were widespread price
decreases for most products, including iron and steel products
(-1.3%), aluminum products (-9.5%), copper and copper alloy
products (-7.3%) as well as nickel products (-22.6%).  Raw Materials Price Index  In 2012, the RMPI was down an average of 6.3% compared with
2011. It was a major change from 2011, when the index grew 15.3%
compared with 2010.  The main factor in the decline of the RMPI was mineral
fuels, specifically crude oil (-9.6%). According to Natural
Resources  Canada , lower prices for crude oil were partly a
result of higher inventories and lower demand for oil and
petroleum products.  Among other mineral fuels, natural gas (-12.9%) also posted
a decline in prices compared with 2011. It was the fourth
consecutive annual decrease for natural gas.  Non-ferrous metals (-8.8%) also contributed to the decline
of the RMPI in 2012. Widespread price decreases were observed
for most products, including copper and nickel concentrates (-
10.7%), lead concentrates (-13.1%) and zinc concentrates (-9.2%).
Despite these decreases, precious metals were up, specifically
gold and alloys in primary form (+7.2%).  The decrease of the RMPI was partially moderated by animals
and animal products (+2.2%) and wood products (+2.1%), which
were the only commodity groups in the RMPI that posted price
increases compared with 2011.  Note to readers  All data in this release are seasonally unadjusted and
usually subject to revision for a period of six months (for
example, when the July index is released, the index for the
previous January becomes final).  The Industrial Product  Price Index  (IPPI) reflects the
prices that producers in Canada receive as the goods leave the
plant gate. It does not reflect what the consumer pays. Unlike
the  Consumer Price Index , the IPPI excludes indirect taxes and
all the costs that occur between the time a good leaves the
plant and the time the final user takes possession of it,
including the transportation, wholesale, and retail costs.  Canadian producers export many goods. They often indicate
their prices in foreign currencies, especially in US dollars,
which are then converted into Canadian dollars. In particular,
this is the case for motor vehicles, pulp, paper and wood
products. Therefore, a rise or fall in the value of the Canadian
dollar against its US counterpart affects the IPPI. But the
conversion into Canadian dollars only reflects how respondents
provide their prices. This is not a measure that takes the full
effect of exchange rates into account.  The conversion of prices received in US dollars is based on
the average monthly exchange rate (noon spot rate) established
by the  Bank of Canada , and it is available on CANSIM in table
176-0064 (series v37426). Monthly and annual variations in the
exchange rate, as described in the release, are calculated
according to the indirect quotation of the exchange rate (for
example, CAN$1 = US$X).  The Raw Materials Price Index (RMPI) reflects the prices
paid by Canadian manufacturers for key raw materials. Many of
those prices are set on the world market. However, as few prices
are denominated in foreign currencies, their conversion into
Canadian dollars has only a minor effect on the calculation of
the RMPI.  To contact the reporter on this story:
