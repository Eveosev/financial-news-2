Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) ,  Europe ’s largest
bank by assets, will pay 3.2 billion euros ($4.3 billion) in
bonuses for 2012, down 11 percent from a year earlier, Chief of
Compliance Stephan Leithner said.  Deutsche Bank’s investment bank employed 9,094 full-time
front-office employees at the end of 2012, according to company
filings published today. Total compensation and benefits in the
unit increased to 1.3 billion euros in the fourth quarter of
2012 from 1 billion euros a year earlier.  “The rise in compensation is due to past deferred
payments”, Leithner said at at a press conference in Frankfurt
today after Deutsche Bank reported a loss of 2.17 billion euros
in the fourth quarter, the biggest in four years.  To contact the reporters on this story:
