Steel reinforcement-bar futures
headed for a second monthly gain in  Shanghai  on optimism that
growth will accelerate in the world’s fastest-expanding major
economy, boosting demand for the building material.  Rebar for delivery in May was unchanged at 4,114  yuan 
($662) a metric ton at 11:11 a.m. local time on the Shanghai
Futures Exchange. The contract is headed for a 3.2 percent gain
this month and reached 4,131 yuan yesterday, the highest price
since June.  The official Purchasing Managers’ Index was 51 in January,
compared with 50.6 in December, according to the median forecast
in a Bloomberg survey before data due Feb. 1. That would be the
fourth month of expansion in the manufacturing index gauge and
follows an acceleration in gross domestic product to 7.9 percent
in the fourth quarter.  “Investors expect rebar demand to pick up after the Lunar
New Year as the recent indicators point to economic expansion,”
Dang Man, an analyst at Maike Futures Co., said in a report today.  China ’s  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP) , the benchmark of the
local equity market, climbed 1 percent to 2,382.48 yesterday,
the highest close since May 30, boosting the bullish case for
the economy, Dang said.  Spot  iron ore  at Tianjin port jumped 0.7 percent to $149.40
a dry ton yesterday, according to The Steel Index Ltd. The
average spot  price  for rebar was up 0.3 percent yesterday at
3,743 yuan a ton, according to data from Beijing Antaike
Information Development Co.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
