Facebook Inc. (FB) , operator of the most
popular social-networking website, unveiled a service that lets
users give gift cards to other members for purchases at
retailers and restaurants.  The card can be used at four businesses, including  Target
Corp. (TGT)  and Jamba Juice Co., Facebook said on its website. With
the new service, users select gift amounts to be put on the card
and sent to their friends. The recipient is notified of the
present and receives the card in the mail a few days later.  Facebook is investing in new products to attract users and
keep them on the site longer. Earlier this month, the company
announced a revamp of its search service that lets members find
information on people, places, photos and interests. Last year,
Facebook debuted tools that let members purchase physical gifts
for friends on the site.  The latest gift feature works for members in the U.S., and
the refillable cards can carry balances from multiple businesses
in varying amounts. The cards can also be used for  LVMH Moet
Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA (MC) ’s Sephora cosmetics chain and for
 Darden Restaurants Inc. (DRI) ’s Olive Garden eateries.  Menlo Park, California-based Facebook fell less than 1
percent to $30.98 at the close in New York. The shares have
declined 18 percent since the company’s initial public offering
in May.  To contact the reporter on this story:
