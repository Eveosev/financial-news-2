Centrais Eletricas Brasileiras SA (ELET6) ,
the worst performing emerging market stock in the past six
months, is seeking to cut its workforce by as much as 15 percent
after  Brazil ’s government reduced electricity prices.  Eletrobras, as the Rio de Janeiro-based power utility is
known, is studying a voluntary retirement package that aims to
reduce its 28,000 person payroll by 10 to 15 percent, the state-
run company’s press office said in a e-mailed response to
questions. The terms of the package haven’t been set yet and
once they are, will require regulatory and government approvals.  Eletrobras has dropped 51 percent in Sao Paulo trading
since July 31, the worst six-month performance among the  821-
member MSCI Emerging Markets Index. (MXEF)  The slide occurred as the
government enacted a package to slash power rates by as much as
32 percent, in an attempt to boost economic growth. Under the
terms of the government package, announced in November,
utilities will cut generation and transmission rates in exchange
for 30-year concession renewals and compensation payments.  The lower rates will almost wipe away Eletrobras’s earnings
before interests, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or
Ebitda, Chief Financial Officer Armando Casado de Araujo said
Nov. 21. Eletrobras is Brazil’s largest electricity company by
generation and transmission capacity. Fitch Ratings Ltd. and
Moody’s Corp. both lowered Eletrobras’s  credit rating  in
December, after it agreed to accept the lower rates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
