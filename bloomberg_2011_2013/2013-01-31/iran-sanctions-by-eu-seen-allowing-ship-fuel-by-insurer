The latest European Union sanctions
against  Iran  allow ships to burn fuel made from Iranian oil if
it’s produced and loaded in another country, according to the
insurers of 90 percent of the world’s fleet.  The 27-nation bloc added restrictions on trade with the
Persian Gulf country on Oct. 15. The  International Group  of P&I
Clubs commented in a  statement  on its website dated Jan. 29.  “It would seem that ships stemming bunkers that contain a
blend of Iranian-origin crude oil will not be caught by the
prohibitions (providing the bunker oil is used for the
propulsion of the ship and not carried as cargo) on purchase,
transport or import of Iranian-origin crude oil in Regulation
267, provided also that the blended bunkers were produced and
stemmed in a third country other than Iran, or, as a result of a
force majeure event, the bunkers were stemmed in a port of
refuge in Iran.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
