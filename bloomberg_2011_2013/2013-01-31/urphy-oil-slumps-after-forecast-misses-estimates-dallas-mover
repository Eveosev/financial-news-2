Murphy Oil Corp. (MUR) , the U.S. producer
with operations in Texas, the U.K. and Indonesia, fell the most
in more than eight months after forecasting first-quarter profit
that fell short of estimates.  Murphy, based in El Dorado, Arkansas, declined 5.3 percent
to $59.52 at the close in New York, the most since May 3.  Per-share profit this quarter will be 55 cents to 90 cents
excluding some items, Murphy said in a statement after the close
of U.S. trading yesterday. Analysts were expecting $1.27, the
average of 12 estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  “Murphy’s portfolio really hasn’t delivered since Kikeh,”
an offshore natural  gas field  in Indonesia that began production
in 2007, John Herrlin, a New York-based analyst for  Societe
Generale SA (GLE) , said in a note today, cutting his rating on the
stock to hold from buy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
