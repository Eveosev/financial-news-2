Chubb Corp. (CB) , the insurer of
businesses and high-end homes, said it would repurchase as much
as $1.3 billion in shares after fourth-quarter profit beat
analysts’ estimates.  The operating profit, which excludes some investment
results, was 16 cents a share, beating by 62 cents the average
estimate of 21 analysts in a Bloomberg survey. Net income fell
77 percent to $102 million, or 38 cents a share, as claims costs
climbed after superstorm Sandy, the Warren, New Jersey-based
company said today in a statement.  Chubb also remained profitable through  Hurricane Katrina  in
2005 and the financial crisis of 2008 and 2009 by limiting risks
tied to underwriting and investing. Chief Executive Officer John Finnegan raised rates for coverage last year after near record-
low bond yields pressured investment income.  “They have a brand and they have a franchise, and so it’s
not nearly as commoditized” as it is offering policies to a
broader customer base, said Josh Stirling, an analyst at Sanford
C. Bernstein & Co., in an interview before results were posted.
Selling to commercial clients and the wealthy “gives them more
pricing leverage in 2013 than more mass-market firms.”  Chubb has advanced about 19 percent in the past year in  New
York  trading, compared with an 18 percent gain in the 24-company
KBW Insurance Index. Results were released after the close of
regular trading.  Policy Sales  Premium revenue slipped 0.6 percent to $2.93 billion. The
company projected that policy sales will climb 2 percent to 4
percent this year.  Chubb said 2013 operating profit will probably be in the
range of $6.40 to $6.80 a share, compared with the average
estimate of $6.26 in a Bloomberg survey of analysts.  Full-year profit for 2012 fell 7.9 percent to $1.55 billion
from $1.68 billion. Book value, a measure of assets minus
liabilities, fell to $60.45 a share from $60.99 at the end of
September.  Chubb spent $1.11 on claims and expenses for every dollar
in premiums for the quarter, compared with a cost of 89.9 cents
in the fourth quarter of 2011. Sandy cost the company $882
million before tax in the quarter.  Travelers Cos., which competes against Chubb selling
commercial insurance, said fourth-quarter profit fell 51 percent
on claims from Sandy.  The U.S. share of insurance losses from worldwide
catastrophes more than doubled in 2012, according to the Impact
Forecasting unit of Aon Plc, the London-based insurance broker.
The U.S. accounted for about 90 percent, or $65 billion, of $72
billion in global losses, Impact said in a statement last week.  Investment Income  Chubb’s fourth-quarter investment income fell to $365
million from $391 million a year earlier as lower  interest rates 
limited what the company earned on its municipal-bond and
corporate-debt portfolios.  The latest repurchase plan replaces a program announced
last year that authorized buying back as much as $1.2 billion in
stock. About $979 million was repurchased under last year’s
program, the company said.  Finnegan said he plans to complete the latest buyback plan
by January of next year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
