BP Plc (BP/) , which started operating its
PSVM oil project in  Angola  at the end of last year, expects to
reach peak output in 2014.  Production will rise to 150,000 barrels a day after the
project’s Marte field starts next year, Amilcar da Costa, a
Luanda-based spokesman, said today in a telephone interview.
PSVM, which comprises the Plutao, Saturno, Venus and Marte
fields, is the deepest offshore development in  Africa , according
to the company.  BP is working to stem a decline in production in Angola
after output dropped 28 percent in 2011, according to its annual
report for that year. Three wells in Plutao are pumping a total
of 7,000 barrels a day and the field’s output will increase to
70,000 barrels daily by June 30, da Costa said.  “We will have two more fields coming on stream this
year,” he said. “It’s too early to determine exactly when the
last field will start.”  London-based BP has a 26.7 percent stake in the ultra-deep
water concession, according to the company website. Exxon Mobil
Corp. has 25 percent, state-owned Sonangol EP holds 20 percent
and  Statoil ASA (STL)  has 13.3 percent.  Marathon Oil Corp. (MRO)  owns 10
percent and China Sonangol International Ltd. holds 5 percent.  BP expects to pump about 533 million barrels from about 40
wells at PSVM, which lies at a depth of 2,000 meters (6,562
feet). It has 1.8 million barrels of crude storage at the
location off the coast of northern Angola.  The company’s production of so-called liquids that include
crude and condensate averaged 123,000 barrels a day in 2011,
compared with 170,000 barrels a year earlier, according to the
annual report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
