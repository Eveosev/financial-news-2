Hispanics will outnumber whites in
 California  next year for the first time and will represent
almost half of all residents by 2060, the state’s Finance
Department said.  A larger percentage of the working-age population will be
Hispanic and Asian as the white baby boomer population ages into
retirement, according to a department report today.  “These younger and more diverse cohorts will help maintain
the potential for the growth of the labor force and the economy
in California,” according to a department news release.  California’s population changes mirror those nationwide.
Hispanics and Asians are the nation’s fastest-growing minority
groups, doubling by 2060, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.
By 2043, minorities as a whole will make up the majority of the
U.S. population, though whites will still be the largest single
group.  -- With assistance from  Frank Bass  in Washington. Editors:
