Whitehaven Coal Ltd. (WHC) , the producer
that counts  Nathan Tinkler  as its largest shareholder, fell the
most in five months after flagging first-half earnings will drop
on lower prices and the high Australian dollar.  Whitehaven, subject of an unsuccessful A$5.3 billion ($5.5
billion) takeover proposal from Tinkler last year, declined as
much as 6.9 percent to A$3.23, the most since Aug. 24. It traded
at A$3.24 at 1:09 p.m. in Sydney.  Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and
amortization in the six months to Dec. 31 will be less than A$10
million, the Sydney-based company said today in a statement. It
reported Ebitda of A$58 million in the same period last year.  The company said Editda will stay at similarly depressed
levels during the second half of fiscal 2013 if coal markets and
the Australian dollar remain unchanged. First-half net profit
after tax will also be cut by a writedown of coal inventory,
asset adjustments after the company mothballed a mine and a
train derailment that disrupted mine operations last month.  Power-station coal at the Australian port of Newcastle, a
benchmark grade for  Asia , slid to $94.29 a metric ton in 2012
from more than $120 in 2011, according to data from IHS
McCloskey.  Editors: Keith Gosman, Iain Wilson  To contact the reporter on this story:
