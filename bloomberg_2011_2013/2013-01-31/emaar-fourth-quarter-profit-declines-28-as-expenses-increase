Emaar Properties PJSC (EMAAR) , the builder
of the world’s tallest tower in Dubai, said fourth-quarter
profit fell 28 percent as costs jumped. That  missed  analyst
estimates.  Net income dropped to 512 million dirhams ($139 million)
from 716 million dirhams a year earlier, the Dubai-based company
said in a statement today. That compares with 537.6 million
dirhams, the average of five estimates compiled by Bloomberg.
Revenue climbed 20 percent to 2.68 billion dirhams. The cost of
sales jumped to 1.5 billion dirhams from 970 million dirhams a
year earlier, the company said.  Emaar, owner of the world’s largest mall, is increasingly
relying on income from hotels and malls and the company will add
1 million square feet (92,903 square meters) of space to the
Dubai Mall, to boost recurring income. The developer is said to
be considering spinning off its malls unit and Turkish business
as it looks for ways to boost shareholder returns,  two people
briefed on the company’s internal discussions said earlier this
month.  Malls and hotels made up 50 percent of 4.1 billion dirhams
of revenue in 2012, while international operations contributed
15 percent, or 1.26 billion dirhams, the company said. The
developer built homes and offices in countries including  Turkey ,
Lebanon,  Saudi Arabia , Egypt and  Pakistan .  Emaar completed more than 1,105 homes and 149,000 square
feet of commercial  office space  in Dubai. The company also
handed over 673 homes and more than 122,000 square feet of
commercial space in its international markets in 2012  The company, which started selling several projects in
Dubai including a hotel and serviced apartments, has sold more
than 80 percent of the projects offered last year, it said.  The earnings were published after the close of trading in
Dubai. The shares dropped 0.2 percent to close at 4.87 dirhams.
Emaar has jumped 30 percent this year, giving the company a
market value of 29.7 billion dirhams.  To contact the reporter on this story:
