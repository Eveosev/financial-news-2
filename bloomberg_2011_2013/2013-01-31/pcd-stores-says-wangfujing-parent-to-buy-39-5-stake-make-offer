PCD Stores Ltd. (331) , which runs luxury
and high-end fashion department stores in China, said the parent
of a rival will purchase a 39.5 percent stake in the company and
then make a buyout offer.  Beijing Wangfujing International Commercial Development Co.
will pay HK$2 billion ($257.5 million) to Bluestone Global
Holdings Ltd. and Portico Global Ltd. for 1.66 billion shares,
according to a Hong Kong stock exchange filing yesterday.
Wangfujing International will then offer HK$1.20 each for the
remaining PCD shares outstanding, according to the filing.  PCD fell 3.5 percent to HK$1.09 in Hong Kong on Jan. 24,
its last day of trading before a suspension. The stock has
declined 44 percent since its listing in December 2009, compared
with a 7.4 percent gain in cityâ€™s benchmark Hang Seng Index. PCD
is scheduled to resume trading today.  Wangfujing International controls Shanghai-listed  Beijing
Wangfujing Department Store Group Co. (600859) , according to the joint
filing with PCD yesterday. The Wangfujing group is ultimately
controlled by the Beijing state-owned assets regulator.  To contact the reporter on this story:
