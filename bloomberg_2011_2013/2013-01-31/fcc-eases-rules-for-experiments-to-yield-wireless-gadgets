The Federal Communications
Commission eased requirements for getting permission to use U.S.
airwaves for experiments that could accelerate development of
new wireless devices.  “Wireless innovation is key to U.S. competitiveness,” FCC
Chairman  Julius Genachowski  said before the agency voted 5-0
today to approve the rules change, which he said would stimulate
research and reduce time for products to move to market.  With the changes, laboratories and universities will have
“more opportunity to dream big and create,” Commissioner
Jessica Rosenworcel said.  The changes include a new medical experimentation license
to help expand the ways wireless devices can improve health
care, Rosenworcel said. The changes also make market testing of
new products less cumbersome, she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
