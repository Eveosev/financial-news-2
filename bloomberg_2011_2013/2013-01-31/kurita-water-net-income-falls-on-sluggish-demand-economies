Kurita Water Industries Ltd. (6370) , a
water system provider, said net income skidded 33 percent to 7.2
billion yen ($79 million), hurt by sluggish  capital investment 
in Japan and a slowdown in emerging economies.  Revenue declined 2.8 percent to 129.7 billion yen for the
nine months through December from the year-earlier period while
operating profit slid 25 percent to 14.6 billion yen, the Tokyo-
based company reported today in a filing.  Kurita manufactures and sells water-treatment equipment and
products including water purification and soil remediation
systems.  To contact the reporter on this story:
