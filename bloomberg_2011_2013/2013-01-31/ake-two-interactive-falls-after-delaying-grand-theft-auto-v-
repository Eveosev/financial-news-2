Two-Two Interactive Software Inc.
fell the most in more than three years after the video-game
publisher delayed the release of the next installment of its
blockbuster title “Grand Theft Auto.”  The shares  fell  6.3 percent to $12.24 at 11:25 a.m. New
York time, after earlier falling as much as 12 percent for the
biggest intraday decline since Dec. 4, 2009.  “Grand Theft Auto V,” for use on  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) ’s Xbox
360 and Sony Corp.s PlayStation 3 home consoles, will be
released on Sept. 17 instead of the spring to “allow additional
development time,” the New York-based company said today in a
statement.  Delaying the title “positions the game to benefit from
holiday buying,”  Michael Olson , an analyst at Piper Jaffray
Cos., said in a note today.  “While we are disappointed to see ‘GTA V’ delayed, it is
understandable given the extremely critical nature of the video
game industry,” said Olson, who rates the shares overweight,
the equivalent of a buy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
