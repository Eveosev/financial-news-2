Softbank Corp. (9984) , a mobile-phone
provider that’s also developing solar-power stations, would
support lower premium payments for  solar energy  as installation
costs drop, according to the company’s president.  “Procurement costs for solar plants are falling,”
Masayoshi Son said today at a press conference in Tokyo. “It is
fair and appropriate for the tariff to be reduced accordingly.”  Japan started an incentive program for clean energy in July
and a government-appointed panel is discussing tariffs for
applications from April 1. Trade Minister Toshimitsu Motegi said
this month the so-called feed-in tariff for solar plants could
be cut to about 35 yen (38 cents) to 39 yen a kilowatt-hour. The
current rate is 42 yen a kilowatt-hour for 20 years.  Softbank has begun operating four solar-power stations in
 Japan  since July, Naoki Nakayama, a spokesman for the Tokyo-
based company, said yesterday by telephone. It will continue
investing in the industry, Son said today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
