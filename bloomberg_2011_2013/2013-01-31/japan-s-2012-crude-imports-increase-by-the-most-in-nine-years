Japan ’s  crude imports  in 2012 rose
by the most in nine years, even as it cut supply from  Iran  amid
an expansion of sanctions against the Middle East country.  Shipments to Japan, the world’s third-biggest crude user,
rose 2.7 percent last year to 212.5 million kiloliters, or 3.65
million barrels a day, data from the  Ministry of Economy, Trade
and Industry  showed today. That is the biggest yearly increase
since 2003, according to Bloomberg calculations based on
historical METI data.  Overseas crude purchases during December were 19.3 million
kiloliters, 1.1 percent higher than the same month last year,
the figures showed. Oil-product imports fell 1 percent to 3.45
million, the ministry reported.  Purchases from Iran last year dropped 17 percent to 11
million kiloliters, or 189,000 barrels a day, according to the
METI data.  Oil-product exports last year fell 12 percent to 24.4
million kiloliters, while imports rose 3.8 percent to 37.9
million, METI’s figures showed.  One kiloliter is equivalent to 6.2898 barrels, according to
 figures  from  BP Plc. (BP/)   To contact the reporter on this story:
