TeliaSonera AB (TLSN) ’s  proposed  dividend
missed estimates after  Sweden ’s biggest phone company reported
lower fourth-quarter sales as growth in  Russia  and Turkey didn’t
offset declines in countries including Finland and  Norway .  Sales in the quarter slipped 0.7 percent to 27.1 billion
kronor ($4.27 billion), the Stockholm-based company said in a
statement today. The  proposed dividend  for 2012 is 2.85 kronor a
share, unchanged from 2011 and less than a Bloomberg estimate of
3.05 kronor. Revenue in local currencies this year will be level
with 2012 sales, TeliaSonera said.  “We believe 2013 will continue to be difficult given a
lack of growth, potential management change and the difficulties
in offering dividend growth at a time when political risk is
high,” Keval Khiroya, a London-based analyst at Deutsche Bank
AG, said in a note.  TeliaSonera, which made more than 60 percent of its revenue
in the Nordic region last year, is battling slowing growth in
home markets amid rising competition. The carrier is reducing
costs to become more profitable as it focuses on data revenue
rather than voice traffic, while robust growth in its Eurasian
unit, with operations in  Turkey , Russia and several former
Soviet Union countries, continues to bolster earnings.  TeliaSonera  shares  fell as much as 2.7 percent, the biggest
intraday drop since Sept. 20. The stock was down 0.9 percent at
45.28 kronor as of 11:48 a.m. in Stockholm.  Improving Margin  The fourth-quarter adjusted margin on earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization was 33.2 percent.
The adjusted margin will improve “somewhat” in 2013 compared
with the 34.4 percent for the full year of 2012, the company
said today.  Net income rose 35 percent to 6.88 billion kronor in the
last three months of 2012.  “Trends improved in the fourth quarter,” Chief Executive
Officer Lars Nyberg said in the statement. “All countries in
Eurasia are again delivering positive revenue growth.”  TeliaSonera has hired law firm Mannheimer Swartling to
investigate accusations by Swedish prosecutors of bribery
related to operations in Uzbekistan. The Stockholm-based carrier
has denied it broke any laws, and said it has “zero tolerance”
for graft.  Chairman Anders Narvinger will step down this year as part
of a management overhaul, the carrier said last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
