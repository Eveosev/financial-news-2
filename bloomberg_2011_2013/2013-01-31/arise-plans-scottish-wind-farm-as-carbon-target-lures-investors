Arise Windpower AB (AWP) , a Scandinavian
renewable-energy developer, plans to build a wind farm in
western  Scotland  as the country targets an 80 percent cut in
power-industry emissions by 2030.  Arise will install as many as 35 turbines at the project,
its first in Scotland, the Halmstad, Sweden-based company said
today in a  statement . It will build the wind farm from 2016 on
the Argyll Estates, comprising more than 30,000 hectares (115
square miles) of land owned by the Duke of Argyll.  Scandinavian developers are expanding abroad as governments
promote wind energy to curb emissions. Scotland, which offers
subsidies for wind turbines, set a goal on Jan. 29 to reduce
carbon-dioxide output from electricity generation to 50 grams of
CO2 a kilowatt-hour, from about 347 grams a kilowatt-hour in
2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
