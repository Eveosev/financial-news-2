Brazil ’s  unemployment  rated dropped
to the lowest on record last month as companies expect economic
growth to rebound after slowing for two consecutive years.  Unemployment fell to 4.6 percent from 4.9 percent in
November, the national statistics agency said in  Rio de Janeiro 
today. Economists had  forecast  unemployment would fall to 4.4
percent, according to a survey by Bloomberg of 29 analysts.  The jobless rate remained at an historic low last year as
companies antecipated that record low borrowing costs,
government tax breaks and increased public spending would fuel
economic growth. Near full employment and rising real wages have
pressured inflation, which has remained above the central bank’s
4.5 percent target for 28 months.  Swap rates on the contract maturing in January 2015, the
most traded in  Sao Paulo  today, fell 3 basis points, or 0.03
percentage points, to 7.88 percent at 9:17 a.m. local time. The
real rose 0.16 percent to 1.9855  per  U.S. dollar .  Economists surveyed by the central bank forecast gross
domestic product will expand 3.19 percent this year, up from
0.98 percent in 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
