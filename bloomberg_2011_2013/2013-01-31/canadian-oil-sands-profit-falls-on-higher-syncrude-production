Canadian Oil Sands Ltd. (COS) , the largest
partner in Syncrude Canada Ltd., said fourth-quarter profit fell
on lower Canadian crude prices and foreign-exchange losses.  Net income declined to C$221 million ($221.5 million), or
46 cents a share, from C$232 million, or 48 cents, a year
earlier, the Calgary-based company said in a statement today.
Earnings-per-share were less than the 49 cent average of four
analystsâ€™ estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Canadian  Oil Sands  saw profit margins erode in the final
months of 2012 as discounts for Canadian crude rose to their
highest point in five years against the U.S. benchmark. The
realized selling price per barrel for Canadian Oil Sands slipped
14 percent to C$89.99 from the year-earlier quarter.  Total production at Syncrude in the fourth quarter rose 19
percent to 27.5 million barrels from a year earlier, according
to the statement. Sales rose 2.8 percent to C$1 billion from
$973 million a year earlier. The company reported a foreign
exchange loss of C$16 million in the quarter after the Canadian
dollar weakened by one cent in the three months ending Dec. 31,
according to the statement.  Canadian Oil Sands owns 36.74 percent of Syncrude, which
held an estimated 4.8 billion barrels of proved and probable
reserves at the end of 2010, according to its  website . The other
venture partners include  Imperial Oil Ltd. (IMO) ,  China Petroleum &
Chemical Corp. (600028)  and  Nexen Inc. (NXY)   The earnings were reported after the close of regular
trading on North American markets. Canadian Oil Sands fell 2.7
percent to C$20.99 at the close in Toronto.  To contact the reporter on this story:
