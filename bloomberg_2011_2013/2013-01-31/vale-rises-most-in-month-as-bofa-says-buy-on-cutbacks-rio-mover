Vale SA (VALE3) , the world’s largest iron-
ore producer, rose the most in almost a month after Bank of
America Corp. recommended investors buy the stock.  Vale, based in Rio de Janeiro,  increased  3.8 percent to
38.70 reais at the close in  Sao Paulo  today, the biggest gain
since Jan. 2. The stock was the fourth-best performer among 49
stocks on the Bloomberg Industries Metals, Mining and Steel
Aggregate  index .  Investors buying Vale shares may profit from an estimated
22 percent return in the next 12 months, Bank of America
analysts led by Felipe Hirai wrote in a note to clients after
upgrading the stock to buy from neutral. The company stands to
profit from cost cuts, more capital discipline and asset sales,
they said.  “The risk reward balance is turning to Vale’s favor,” the
Sao Paulo-based analysts wrote today. “The probability of the
worst case scenario is very unlikely.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
