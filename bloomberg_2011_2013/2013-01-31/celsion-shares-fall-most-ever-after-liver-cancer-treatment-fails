Celsion Corp. (CLSN)  plunged the most ever
in New York trading after the company announced its experimental
treatment for  liver cancer  failed in a study.  Celsion fell 81 percent to $1.51 at the close in New York,
the biggest single-day decline since the shares began trading in
April 1994. The stock had almost quadrupled in the 12 months
through yesterday.  The cancer treatment, called ThermoDox, didn’t meet the
study’s primary goal of slowing liver tumor growth in the final
stage of testing usually required to get regulatory approval,
the Lawrenceville, New Jersey-based company said today in a
statement. Celsion said it has about $27 million in cash and
investments that will help it evaluate future development plans.  To contact the reporter on this story:
