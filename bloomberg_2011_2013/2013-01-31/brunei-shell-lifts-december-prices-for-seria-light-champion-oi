Brunei Shell Petroleum Co. increased
its retroactive official selling prices for Seria Light and
Champion crude purchased in December by $1.14 each to $114.35
and $114.20 a barrel, respectively, said two people familiar
with the change. They asked not to be identified because they
aren’t authorized to speak to the media.  Seria Light for December was set at parity to the OSP for
Malaysia’s Tapis for the same month, unchanged from November.  To contact the reporter on this story:
