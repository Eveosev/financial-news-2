Volatility in the  Taiwan dollar , a
measure of expected moves in the  exchange rate , headed for the
biggest monthly increase since May as the yen’s slide fanned
speculation the central bank will allow depreciation to keep
exports competitive.  Policy makers warned on Jan. 29 that they will step into
the foreign-exchange market after the Taiwan dollar reached a
four-year high against the yen on Jan. 28. The yen dropped 4.6
percent versus the dollar this month, while the island’s
currency fell 1.5 percent. Taiwan and  Japan  compete in overseas
markets for electronic products.  “The central bank isn’t too happy about the strength of
the currency against the yen affecting exports,” said Suan Teck Kin, an economist at  United Overseas Bank Ltd. (UOB)  in  Singapore .
“Volatility would naturally increase.”  One-month implied volatility in the Taiwan dollar, a gauge
used to price options, climbed 134 basis points, or 1.34
percentage points, to 4.57 percent in January as of 4:14 p.m.
local time, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
contracts dropped in the last three months of 2012.  One-month non-deliverable forwards fell 2.1 percent in
January to NT$29.545 versus the dollar, halting a four-month
advance, data compiled by Bloomberg show. In the  spot market ,
the currency declined to NT$29.582 against its U.S. counterpart
from Dec. 31 and was little changed today, according to prices
from Taipei Forex Inc. It touched NT$28.928 on Jan. 14, the
strongest level since September 2011.  Bonds Fall  A government report today showed Taiwan’s economy expanded
3.4 percent in the fourth quarter from a year earlier, exceeding
estimates in a Bloomberg survey for 3 percent. For the whole
year, gross domestic product increased 1.25 percent, less than
4.1 percent in 2011.  “The data today will give a bit of comfort to the market
to push the Taiwan dollar to the stronger side,” Suan said.
“The fundamentals are improving.”  Premier Sean Chen asked policy makers last week to closely
monitor the effects of the  Bank of Japan (8301) ’s monetary easing. The
central bank has sold its currency near the close on most days
in the past 10 months, according to traders, who asked not to be
identified.  Government bonds  fell. The yield on the 1.125 percent notes
due September 2022 rose two basis points to 1.19 percent this
month, according to Gretai Securities Market. The rate was
steady today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
