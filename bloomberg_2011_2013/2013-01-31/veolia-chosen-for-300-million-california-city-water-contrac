Veolia Environnement SA (VIE) ’s water
division has been awarded a 30-year contract through its North
America subsidiary to manage water and wastewater systems for
the Southern  California  city of Rialto and its water agency.  The city near San Bernardino, California, is using a
public-private concession model to improve its infrastructure
and as part of that, the Veolia Water contract is valued at
about $300 million in revenue, the Paris-based company said.  Rialto will receive capital for water and wastewater
upgrades as part of improvements that will enable the city to
fund water main and sewer replacements and improvements
including “seismic retrofits,” according to today’s statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
