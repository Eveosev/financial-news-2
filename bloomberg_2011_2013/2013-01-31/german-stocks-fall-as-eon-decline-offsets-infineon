German stocks  declined, paring the
benchmark index’s eighth straight monthly advance, as a fall in
the country’s retail sales offset a drop in unemployment.  EON SE lost 3.1 percent after UBS AG advised selling the
shares.  Infineon Technologies AG (IFX)  gained 3.9 percent after
forecasting an improvement in earnings.  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  added
2.9 percent after it said its core Tier 1 capital ratio rose to
8 percent, even as it reported a worse-than-expected loss.  The  DAX Index (DAX)  declined 0.5 percent to 7,776.05 at the close
of trading in  Frankfurt . The gauge still advanced 2.2 percent in
January for its eighth straight monthly gain. That’s the longest
such winning streak since 1998. The number of shares changing
hands on the index was 41 percent higher than the average of the
past 30 days. The broader HDAX Index slid 0.5 percent today.  “We had a good rhythm of economic news, now we need more
for stocks to move higher to the next level,” said Louis de Fels, a Paris-based fund manager at Raymond James Asset
Management International, which oversees $43 billion worldwide.
“It’s normal to take a pause after the recent gains.”  German retail sales dropped more than economists expected
in December as uncertainty about the economic outlook weighed on
 consumer confidence . Sales, adjusted for inflation and seasonal
swings, plunged 1.7 percent from November, when they rose a
revised 0.6 percent, the Federal Statistics Office said.  German unemployment unexpectedly declined in January for
the first time in 10 months. The number of people out of work
fell a seasonally adjusted 16,000 to 2.92 million, the Federal
Labor Agency said. Economists had predicted an increase of
8,000, the median of 31 estimates in a Bloomberg News survey
showed. The adjusted jobless rate dropped to 6.8 percent,
matching a two-decade low.  U.S. Activity  Business activity in the U.S. expanded more than forecast
in January, a sign manufacturing picked up at the start of the
year, according to a report today.  The MNI Chicago Report’s business barometer rose to 55.6
this month, the highest since April, after 50 in December. A
reading of 50 is the dividing line between expansion and
contraction. The median forecast of 48 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg was 50.5.  EON,  Germany ’s largest utility, lost 3.1 percent to 12.81
euros, for the biggest decline on the benchmark index. UBS
recommended selling the shares, saying it estimates unchanged
earnings per share after 2013.  Aixtron SE, the maker of equipment for the semiconductor
industry, slid 5 percent to 10.05 euros. Supervisory board
Deputy Chairman Holger Juergensen and ordinary member Karl- Hermann Kuklies resigned with immediate effect, Aixtron said.  Wirecard Falls  Wirecard AG (WDI) , which offers Internet payment services,
retreated 7.9 percent to 16.77 euros. The company said it sees
2013 earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization of 120 million euros ($163 million) to 130 million
euros. That’s lower than the estimate of 133.3 million euros.  K+S AG (SDF) ,  Europe ’s largest potash maker, retreated 2 percent
to 33.25 euros. Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan Inc., the world’s
largest fertilizer producer, forecast first-quarter profit that
trailed analysts’ estimates.  Infineon climbed 3.9 percent to 6.65 euros. Europe’s
second-biggest chipmaker forecast that earnings will improve in
the current quarter as demand picks up in the car industry.  Fresenius SE, Germany’s biggest operator of private
hospitals, advanced 1.3 percent to 89.65 euros. Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. raised its recommendation on the shares to buy from
neutral, saying its current valuation offers an attractive entry
point as it has underperformed the sector.  Deutsche Bank  Deutsche Bank added 2.9 percent to 38.21 euros. Europe’s
biggest bank by assets said its core Tier 1 capital ratio, a
measure of financial strength, stood at 8 percent on Dec. 31
under Basel III rules. That exceeded its forecast for a level of
7.2 percent. Co-Chief Executive Officer Anshu Jain said he
expects a ratio of 8.5 percent at the end of the first quarter.  Deutsche Bank posted a fourth-quarter loss of 2.17 billion
euros, more than analysts had estimated, after it eliminated
more than 1,400 jobs and set aside 1 billion euros for legal
expenses.  Bechtle AG (BC8) , a retailer of office supplies, jumped 7.5
percent to 33.25 euros. The company reported 2012 pretax profit
of 79 million euros compared with an estimate of 76.5 million
euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
