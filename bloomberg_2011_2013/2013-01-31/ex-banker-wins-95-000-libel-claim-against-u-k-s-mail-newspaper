Associated Newspapers Ltd. must pay
a former director at the Bank of  Scotland  Plc 60,000 pounds
($95,000) in damages in a U.K. libel judgment after publishing
articles claiming the man committed perjury and was part of a
criminal conspiracy to defraud banks.  The two articles, published in the company’s Mail on Sunday
newspaper, caused Irfan Qadir “distress and embarrassment,”
Christopher Hutchings, his lawyer, said in a written statement
filed at London’s High Court.  Qadir, described in court documents as a “leading figure
in the U.K. banking sector for the past 22 years,” will receive
damages and legal costs of more than 500,000 pounds, according
to Hutchings. Bank of Scotland is a unit of  Lloyds Banking Group
Plc. (LLOY)   The decision to print a lawyer’s allegation that Qadir was
a central figure in a conspiracy to defraud banks of 49 million
pounds was unfair because it omitted comments from a judge that
said there was no evidence to support the claim, according to an
October ruling.  Mark Dennis, a lawyer representing Associated Newspapers,
declined to comment. The company, responsible for publishing the
Daily Mail newspaper, apologized in open court to Qadir today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
