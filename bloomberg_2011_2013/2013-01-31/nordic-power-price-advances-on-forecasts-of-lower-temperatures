Nordic electricity retreated as
falling German power and carbon prices reduced the impact of
weather forecasts that pointed to higher demand and lower
supplies.  The contract for next quarter fell as much as 0.4 percent
to 35.30 euros ($48.70) a megawatt-hour and traded at 35.35
euros as of 1:38 p.m. on Nasdaq OMX Group Inc.’s energy exchange
in Oslo. Power for next year dropped to a record 35.75 euros.  German power for around-the-clock delivery next quarter
slid as much as 1.2 percent to 37.15 euros, an all-time low,
according to broker data compiled by Bloomberg. EU carbon
permits for December traded down 22 cents, or 5.8 percent, at
3.58 euros a metric ton after falling as low as 3.53 euros on
the ICE Futures Europe exchange in  London .  Low temperatures in Oslo may decline to minus 13 degrees
Celsius (9 Fahrenheit) on Feb. 3, from plus 1 today, according
to CustomWeather Inc. data on Bloomberg. Temperatures are set to
fall to as low as minus 22 degrees on Feb. 11. Cold weather
boosts demand for electric heating.  Drier weather and forecasts of falling temperatures
indicate that the amount of water and snow available to generate
electricity in the region may be 13.4 terawatt-hours below the
seasonal norm in two weeks, Markedskraft AS data on Bloomberg
show. That represents a 25 increase from today’s deficit of 10.8
terawatts. The Nordic region meets more than half its power
needs by running water through turbines, which means lower
rainfall affects supplies and electricity prices.  To contact the reporter on this story:
