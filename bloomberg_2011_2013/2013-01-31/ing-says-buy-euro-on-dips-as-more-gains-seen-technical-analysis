The euro may strengthen 0.3 percent
against the dollar, extending its best start to a year since the
currency’s creation, as long as it doesn’t dip below an area of
so-called support, ING Bank NV said, citing trading patterns.  While the 17-nation euro will pare some of its 2.9 percent
gains since December, it may rebound to $1.3615 if it stays
above $1.3425, Roelof-Jan Van Den Akker, a senior technical
analyst in Amsterdam, wrote in an e-mailed note.  “We recommend buying each dip to the support area,” Van
Den Akker said in the note.  The euro was little changed against the dollar at $1.3576
as of 4:27 p.m. London time, after rising as much as 0.7 percent
to $1.3587 yesterday.  “In coming days, we are expecting a consolidation of
yesterday’s solid gains, suggesting a consolidation above the
$1.3485-$1.3425 support area before the uptrend continues,” Van
Den Akker wrote.  Support is an area on a price graph at which technical
analysts expect buy orders to be clustered.  The single currency is the top performer this year among 10
developed-market currencies tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-
Weighted Currency Indexes, having appreciated 2.9 percent.  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
