The level of  Italy ’s contribution to
the European Union budget is unjustified and the system should
be revamped to increase fairness, Prime Minister Mario Monti
said today in Berlin before a meeting with German Chancellor
Angela Merkel.  Italy has been the biggest net contributor to the European
Union budget since 2011, Monti told reporters at a press
conference with Merkel.  “In the last 10 years, Italy has become a net contributor
and has paid more than what was justified by its level of
relative prosperity,” Monti said. The budget system must become
more “transparent and fair” and promote growth and solidarity,
he said.  EU leaders will meet Feb. 7-8 in Brussels to try to strike
an agreement on the EU’s next seven-year budget. An initial
summit on the 2014-2020 spending plan in November failed to
reach an accord when poorer countries balked at subsidy cuts and
richer countries battled to maximize their rebates.  Merkel told reporters in Berlin today she’s confident an
agreement will be reached, though talks “won’t be easy.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
