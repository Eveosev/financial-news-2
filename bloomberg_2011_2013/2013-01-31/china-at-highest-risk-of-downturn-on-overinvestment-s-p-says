China  has the highest risk of a
downturn among 32 of the world’s largest economies stemming from
its outsized proportion of investment spending, according to
 Standard & Poor’s .  Australia, India and Vietnam show an “intermediate risk”
of a slowdown based on comparisons of investment, size of gross
domestic product and growth, Terry Chan, a Melbourne-based
analyst for the credit-ratings company, wrote in a report
released today. China has the highest investment-to-GDP ratio in
the world, the report said.  The analysis underscores concern that China’s dependence on
 investment  spending to drive growth is unsustainable, with the
nation’s new leaders vowing to pursue better-quality expansion
and increase consumption. The  World Bank  warned this month that
there would be “significant domestic and global consequences”
from an abrupt drop in China’s “unusually high investment
rate.”  “We believe the level of a country’s investment overhang
can be a leading indicator of a potential economic correction,”
S&P said. “We consider overinvestment as being a sustained
decline in investment productivity.”  Other countries in the intermediate-risk category include
Brazil, Canada, France, Indonesia and  South Africa , S&P said.
Nations with the lowest risk from overinvestment include the
U.S., Japan, Germany, Mexico and Ireland.  --Scott Lanman. Editors: Scott Lanman, Nerys Avery  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
