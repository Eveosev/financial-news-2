MasterCard Inc. (MA) , the second-biggest
U.S. payments network, posted fourth-quarter profit that beat
analysts’ estimates as customers made more purchases.  Net income excluding litigation charges increased 18
percent to $605 million, or $4.86 a share, from $514 million, or
$4.03, a year earlier, the Purchase, New York-based company said
today in a statement. The average  estimate  of 33 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg was $4.80 a share.  “It was a solid quarter capping a really solid year
despite the economic challenges,” MasterCard Chief Financial
Officer Martina Hund-Mejean said in a phone interview after
results were announced.  Chief Executive Officer  Ajay Banga  is fending off
competitors  Visa Inc. (V)  and Shanghai-based China UnionPay as he
seeks a larger share of the electronic payments processing
market. Banga is targeting  developing countries  such as Myanmar,
Ghana, Nigeria and Angola for growth amid a global consumer
shift from cash to plastic.  “We are gaining traction in our U.S. credit business with
some recent wins, continuing to experience momentum in our
mobile initiatives around the world, and securing important
business in  emerging markets  like Africa and  Brazil ,” Banga,
53, said in the statement.  Profit comparisons were skewed by a $770 million expense
tied to settling litigation with merchants taken in the fourth
quarter of 2011. Including that cost, earnings a year earlier
were $19 million, or 15 cents a share.  Worldwide Spending  MasterCard gained 0.4 percent to $518.11 at 10:32 a.m. in
 New York . The firm climbed 8.8 percent in the fourth quarter,
outpacing the 70-company  Standard & Poor’s 500 Information
Technology Index (S5INFT) , which fell 6.2 percent. The shares jumped 32
percent in 2012, more than doubling the index’s 13 percent
return.  Consumer spending  in the U.S., which accounts for about 70
percent of the economy,  expanded  at a 2.2 percent annual rate in
the final three months of 2012. The pace followed a 1.6 percent
advance in the third quarter and was the fastest since January
through March, according to Commerce Department figures released
yesterday.  MasterCard’s total revenue increased 9.7 percent to $1.9
billion, just beating the Bloomberg forecast of $1.89 billion.
Worldwide spending on MasterCard- and Maestro-branded cards
climbed 13 percent to $727 billion, based on local currencies,
the company said. Processed transactions jumped 20 percent to
9.2 billion.  Rebates Increase  Total operating expenses increased 3 percent to $996
million from a year earlier, excluding the litigation provision,
the company said. Tien-Tsin Huang, an analyst with  JPMorgan
Chase & Co. (JPM)  in New York, had estimated a 4 percent increase.  Rebates and incentives, which encourage banks to use the
firm’s products, climbed 21 percent to $782 million, according
to a  presentation  on the company’s website. Huang, who has an
overweight rating on the shares, had predicted $803 million.  “Revenues were better than we expected on lower rebates
and slightly better than expected volume, while margins came in
higher on slower expense growth,” Huang wrote in a note to
clients.  To contact the reporter on this story:
