President  Barack Obama  raised $738.5
million for his successful re-election effort, almost as much as
the record $745 million he brought in four years earlier,
Federal Election Commission  filings  show.  The president spent $737 million to win a second term. His
re-election committee reported that it finished the year $5.9
million in debt and had $3.3 million in the bank.  His Republican opponent,  Mitt Romney , finished his campaign
having raised $483.5 million and his committee reported $383,275
in the bank. Romney spent $17.3 million in the closing weeks of
2012, bringing his total expenses to $483.1 million.  Final campaign disclosure reports show Obama as the top
fundraiser in what will be the most expensive U.S. presidential
campaign; more than $2 billion was spent by the candidates,
parties and outside groups, including super-political action
committees. FEC Chairwoman Ellen Weintraub  said  the final price
tag for the entire 2012 election will total about $7 billion.  The 2012 election was the first completely privately funded
presidential race since the current campaign finance system was
put in place for the 1976 contest. The changes followed the
Watergate scandal that led to the resignation of President
Richard Nixon.  In raising about $1.5 billion for his two White House bids,
Obama helped erode the Watergate-era campaign finance laws that
offered federal funds to candidates in exchange for their
agreement to limit their spending.  No Limits  Obama, 51, in 2008 was the first candidate to turn down
taxpayer money for both his primary and his general election
campaigns. He did the same in 2012, as did Romney.  The president reported raising $5.8 million from Nov. 27 to
Dec. 31, following his re-election victory on Nov. 6. He spent
$7.9 million in those weeks, including $3.4 million on events
and $1.2 million on payroll.  Rufus Gifford, who led fundraising for the re-election
campaign and the inaugural committee, received $21,521 during
the final five weeks of 2012, more than any other campaign aide.  The president’s debts included $300,000 to campaign
strategist David Axelrod and $153,432 to the political
consulting firm Axelrod started, $866,216 for media production,
and $254,707 to the Democratic National Committee for
telemarketing.  Romney Report  Romney, 65, reported $4.7 million in receipts from Nov. 27
to Dec. 31. He paid off the remaining $1.2 million of $20
million his campaign borrowed before the Republican National
Convention in August and secured by donations to his general-
election bid. The campaign reported owing $825,749 to a
telemarketing company.  It can take years for unsuccessful presidential candidates
to clear their debts, if they do so at all. Secretary of State
Hillary Clinton recently paid off what she owed from her
unsuccessful 2008 Democratic presidential primary campaign. As
of Sept. 30, former  New York  City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, who
sought the Republican nomination the same year, still had
creditors waiting to be paid.  In his fundraising, Romney had help from 54 lobbyists who
reported raising $12 million from July 1 to Dec. 31 for a joint
effort with the Republican National Committee and state parties.
The list included leaders of major trade groups, including John Castellani, president of the Pharmaceutical Research and
Manufacturers of America; Bill Graves, president of the American
Trucking Associations; and Jay Timmons, president of the
National Association of Manufacturers.  ‘Wild Ride’  One of the Republicans vanquished by Romney during the
party’s primaries, former House Speaker  Newt Gingrich , reported
owing $4.7 million at the end of 2012, including almost $650,000
to himself, FEC filings show.  Gingrich raised $24.8 million for his campaign, including
$151,814 in individual donations during the last three months of
2012, most of which was in amounts of $200 or less. Gingrich won
two primaries and officially ended his self-described “wild
ride” presidential bid in early May.  His campaign committee was paid $320,167 by a direct-mail
firm renting his mailing list. Gingrich, 69, ended 2012 with
$75,046 in his campaign bank account.  Travel Costs  In addition to the $647,519 owed to Gingrich for travel
costs, his campaign’s other debts included $991,072 to Moby Dick
Airways, an air charter company; $35,000 to a former House
colleague, J.C. Watts of  Oklahoma , for consulting; and $16,526
to another unsuccessful Republican presidential candidate,
businessman  Herman Cain , for consulting and travel. Cain
endorsed Gingrich, a fellow Georgian, for president after ending
his own candidacy in late 2011.  Cain reported $450,000 in debts, all to himself. He
reported loans of $275,000 and unpaid travel expenses of
$175,000. The businessman raised $16.9 million for his campaign
and had $4,117 cash-on-hand at the end of December.  Former U.S. Senator  Rick Santorum  of  Pennsylvania , who owed
$2.3 million after leaving the presidential race in April, pared
down his campaign debt to $732,035, according to the FEC.  Santorum still owed $482,988 to his former chief
strategist,  John Brabender , and $15,000 for sponsoring Tony Raines’s Ford Fusion in Nascar’s Daytona 500 auto race in
 Florida  last February. The race car, with Santorum’s campaign
logo adorning the hood, finished 19th.  Santorum’s campaign treasury ended 2012 with $126,274 in
the bank; he raised $23.6 million for his candidacy. The FEC
filings show he rented out his mailing list, earning $100,000
from his own leadership political action committee and $294,608
from an outside firm.  The Republican National Committee, which reported owing
$21.1 million at the start of 2011, entered 2013 with a bank
balance of $4.8 million and no debts. The committee raised $390
million for the 2012 election. The Democratic National Committee
finished last year $21.5 million in debt after raising $290
million. The party had $4.3 million in the bank.  To contact the reporters on this story:
