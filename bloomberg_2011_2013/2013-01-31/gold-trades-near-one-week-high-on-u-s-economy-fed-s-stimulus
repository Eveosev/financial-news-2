Gold traded little changed near a
one-week high after data showed that the  U.S. economy 
unexpectedly shrank and the  Federal Reserve  maintained asset
purchases. Platinum headed for the best month in a year.  Spot gold was at $1,676.79 at 3:33 p.m. in Singapore, after
gaining as much as 0.2 percent. Bullion climbed as much as 1.2
percent yesterday to $1,683.28, the highest price since Jan 24.
The metal is poised to snap three months of losses. Platinum,
the best-performing precious metal this year, has jumped 9.4
percent this month in the biggest gain since January 2012.  The U.S. economy contracted 0.1 percent in the fourth
quarter, the most since the second quarter of 2009, as defense
spending slumped. The Fed will keep purchasing securities at the
rate of $85 billion a month, the  Federal Open Market Committee 
said after a two-day meeting. Gold rallied 7.1 percent in 2012,
advancing for a 12th year on global stimulus measures.  “A reevaluation of the U.S. economic recovery combined
with a reaffirmation of a highly accommodative monetary policy
is gold-bullish,” Howard Wen, an analyst at HSBC Securities
(USA) Inc., wrote in a note. The so-called overall trajectory
for gold and silver appears higher, Wen said.  Gold for April delivery slipped 0.2 percent to $1,677.70 an
ounce on the Comex in  New York . Bullion held in exchange-traded
products rose from a two-month low to 2,612.836 metric tons
yesterday, halting a four-day drop that was the longest period
of declines since April, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Global Rebound  Platinum has rallied this month on prospects for increased
demand as the global economy rebounds, with a faster expansion
in  China , and after Anglo American Platinum Ltd., the largest
producer, said it will idle some shafts. The metal used in
autocatalysts traded little changed at $1,684.49 an ounce.  Platinum and related metals may have so-called price spikes
this year and next because of growing demand and a lack of
investment in mines, Steve Shepherd, an analyst at JPMorgan
Chase & Co., said in a report today. “Good news for the metals
may stem from bad news at the mines,” he said.  Cash silver was 0.2 percent lower at $31.98 an ounce after
jumping as much as 2.6 percent yesterday. The metal is 5.4
percent higher this month, rebounding from a 9.2 percent drop in
December, which was the worst monthly showing since May.  Palladium slid 0.2 percent to $748 an ounce, after climbing
to a 16-month high of $759.50 yesterday. The metal has risen 6.3
percent this month, for a third monthly gain.  To contact the reporter on this story:
