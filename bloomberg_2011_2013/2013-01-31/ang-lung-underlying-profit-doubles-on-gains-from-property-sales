Hang Lung Properties Ltd. (101) , the  Hong
Kong  developer investing more than $8.5 billion building malls
in mainland  China , said 2012 underlying profit almost doubled
after the company sold more properties in the city.  Profit excluding revaluation gains and deferred taxes
climbed to HK$6.18 billion ($797 million) from HK$3.12 billion
a year earlier, Hang Lung said. That compares with the HK$4.79
billion average estimate of 14 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.
Sales rose to HK$7.37 billion from HK$5.71 billion, the company said.  Hang Lung Chairman  Ronnie Chan  is betting on rising
consumption by China’s expanding middle class to fuel demand for
high-end shopping malls. The company hasn’t purchased land in Hong
Kong, the world's most expensive place to buy a home, in more than
a decade and has been selling apartments and commercial properties
in the city to help fund expansion in other Chinese regions.  Hang Lung's financial position “should allow it to
take advantage of potential new acquisition in both mainland
China and Hong Kong,” Deutsche Bank AG’s Hong Kong-based
analysts  Tony Tsang  and Jason Ching wrote in a note to clients
after the results were announced.  The Hong Kong-based company’s shares closed 1 percent lower at
HK$29.25 in Hong Kong, after declining as much as 1.7 percent.  Rental profit from China, which includes shopping malls in
Shanghai, Jinan and Shenyang, rose 18 percent to HK$2.37 billion,
while in Hong Kong it gained 4 percent to HK$2.53 billion,
Hang Lung said.  The company made HK$846 million from apartment sales in
Hong Kong during the year, Hang Lung said. It also booked a gain
of HK$2.15 billion from the sale of investment properties. Hong
Kong is the world’s most expensive to buy a home, according to
property broker  Savills Plc. (SVS)   Hang Lung still has about 1,400 unsold completed
residential units in the city, Chan said in a briefing in Hong
Kong today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
