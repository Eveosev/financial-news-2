Power contracts for 2014 delivery in
 Germany  and  France  fell to records as European emissions
allowances declined.  Baseload German 2014 electricity, for supplies delivered
around the clock, lost 11 percent this month, while French power
declined 8.7 percent and carbon permits dropped 48 percent in
the same period. Power can track emissions which affect
production costs.  German power, a benchmark contract in  Europe , lost 65 cents
to 40.35 euros ($54.77) as of 5:30 p.m. Berlin time. That’s the
lowest price on record for the next-year contract, according to
broker data compiled by Bloomberg. French 2014 power slid for a
second day, dropping 70 cents to 43.75 euros, broker data show.  EU carbon permits for December fell as much as 42 cents, or
11 percent, to 3.38 euros a ton on the ICE Futures Europe
exchange in  London .  “European power markets are structurally challenged by
overcapacity, continuing renewables investments and weak
demand,” Per Lekander, a Paris-based analyst at  UBS AG (UBSN)  said in
an e-mailed research note. Twenty to 30 gigawatts of capacity
closures are needed to fix the situation, he said.  February power in Germany lost as much as 1.7 percent to a
record 41.30 euros while the equivalent French contract slid 2.3
percent to 48.85 euros a megawatt-hour, the lowest since the
contract started, broker data show.  Above-average wind forecasts in Germany next week are
having a knock-on effect on the February contract, Gary Hornby,
an analyst at Inenco Group Ltd. in Lytham St. Annes,  England ,
said by e-mail. Wind output may be more than 13 gigawatts every
day next week and rise to as much as 20 gigawatts on Feb. 4 and
5, he said.  Wind generation in Germany reached a record 23,033
megawatts today compared with an average of 4,872 gigawatts,
according to  data  from European Energy Exchange AG.  EnBW Energie Baden-Wuerttemberg AG (EBK)  halted its 721-megawatt
Bexbach coal-fed plant until Feb. 4, the company said on its
website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
