Norwegian  retail sales  rose more
than estimated last month as the economy of western  Europe ’s
largest oil exporter showed resilience.  Sales, excluding motor vehicles and petrol stations, rose
0.2 percent in the month and fell 1.6 percent in the year, the
Oslo-based statistics office said in a statement today. Sales
were expected to rise 0.1 percent in the month, according to a
Bloomberg survey of six economists.  The central bank last month kept  its benchmark deposit rate 
unchanged at 1.5 percent and stuck to plans for a rate increase
as early as March as it tries to damp a run-away housing market
and record high private debt burdens. Norway’s economic strength
and higher rates than elsewhere have stoked demand for the
krone, which rose to a record on an import-weighted basis this
year.  In a separate release, the statistics agency said  credit
growth  slowed to 6.5 percent in December from 7.1 in November.
Household credit growth was unchanged at 7.2 percent while
business loan growth slowed to 5 percent from 6.4 percent.  Unemployment in western Europe’s largest oil exporter
unexpectedly rose to 3.5 percent in November from 3.3 percent
the previous month, the agency said yesterday. Exports dropped
an annual 9.7 percent in December, official data showed.  The krone weakened 0.2 percent against the euro to 7.4430
as of 10:08 a.m. in Oslo. Versus the dollar, the krone was 0.2
percent weaker at 5.4888.  To contact the reporter on this story:
