Tractor Supply Co. (TSCO) , the operator of
more than 1,100 farm-equipment stores, surged the most in more
than six months after fourth-quarter profit topped analysts’
estimates because of higher sales of animal and pet merchandise.  The shares  advanced  9.8 percent to $103.67 at the close in
New York, the biggest daily gain since July 26. Tractor Supply
increased 26 percent last year, topping the 13 percent gain for
the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  Net income rose 13 percent to $79.5 million, or $1.11 a
share, from $70.5 million, or 96 cents, a year earlier, the
Brentwood, Tennessee-based company said yesterday in a
statement. Analysts projected $1.03, the average of 23 estimates
compiled by Bloomberg.  Revenue rose 3.7 percent to $1.29 billion, and same-store
sales gained 4.7 percent, helped by sales of feed for animals
and pets. Profit excluding some items will be as much as $4.47 a
share this year, topping analysts’ average projection of $4.36.  To contact the reporter on this story:
