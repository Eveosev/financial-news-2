The U.K.’s Financial Services
Authority banned short-selling of  Saipem SpA (SPM)  shares after a
record drop prompted Italian authorities to investigate a stock
sale in  Europe ’s largest oil-services provider.  The FSA said today the decision to ban short-selling of
Saipem in the U.K. followed significant price movement and
consultation with another competent authority.  Saipem  plunged 34 percent yesterday  when the Milan-based
company cut a forecast for 2013 profit. The day before, Bank of
America Corp. had managed the sale of almost 10 million shares,
or 2.3 percent of the company’s stock, for an institutional
investor that’s yet to be identified.  Italian stock-market regulator Consob said yesterday it was
monitoring trading in Saipem shares after the placement and
price plunge.  Saipem rose as much as 4.5 percent to 20.91 euros in Milan
trading and traded at 20.70 euros at 10:56 a.m. local time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
