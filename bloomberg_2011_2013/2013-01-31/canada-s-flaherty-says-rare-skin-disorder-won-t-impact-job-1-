Canadian Finance Minister Jim Flaherty revealed he has a rare skin disorder that is being
treated with steroids.  Flaherty, 63, has been diagnosed with bullous pemphigoid, a
rare skin condition causing blisters that he is treating with
the steroid prednisone, according to a statement from his
office. Flaherty, who has been questioned about a change in his
appearance by reporters, said side effects of the treatment
include bloating and weight gain.  “This treatment has in no way impacted Minister Flaherty’s
ability to do his job, as he has been dealing with this health
issue for nearly a year now while carrying out his duties,”
Flaherty’s director of communications Dan Miles said in an e-
mailed statement.  The illness was reported by the Globe and Mail earlier
today. Flaherty told the newspaper in an interview he would like
to stay on as finance minister until the  federal budget  is
balanced and that he had informed Prime Minister Stephen Harper
of his disease late last year. Flaherty has said he is aiming to
balance the budget by the fiscal year beginning April 2015.  Harper “wishes minister Flaherty well and looks forward to
continuing work with him” on the budget, Harper’s director of
communications Andrew MacDougall said in an e-mail.  The condition is clearing up and Flaherty is hopeful his
appearance will return to normal soon, Miles said in the
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
