First Solar Inc. (FSLR) , the world’s
largest thin-film solar manufacturer, may receive the lowest
rates ever for selling U.S. solar energy, less than power from
new coal plants, for a project it acquired in New Mexico,
according to a regulatory filing.  First Solar bought the Macho Springs project from Element
Power Solar, according to a statement today.  El Paso Electric
Co. (EE)  agreed to buy the electricity for 5.79 cents a kilowatt-
hour, according to a Jan. 22  procedural order  from the New
Mexico Public Regulation Commission.  That’s less than half the 12.8 cents per kilowatt-hour
average price for new coal plants, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Thin-film photovoltaic power typically sells for 16.3
cents a kilowatt-hour, according to Bloomberg New Energy
Finance.  The price would be “the lowest solar power purchase
agreement price we have ever seen,” Aaron Chew, an analyst at
Maxim Group LLC in New York, said today in an e-mail. It’s less
than half the price that First Solar will get for its Antelope
Valley, Topaz, and Agua Caliente projects, he said.  El Paso Power has until tomorrow to submit additional
information on how renewable-energy credits related to the 50-
megawatt project may affect the utility’s costs.  Alan Bernheimer, a spokesman for Tempe, Arizona-based First
Solar, wouldn’t confirm the rate in the regulatory filing.
“That information is usually confidential,” he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
