The  University of Michigan , playing
its first game in 21 years as the top-ranked men’s college
basketball team, beat Northwestern University 68-46.  In other games last night involving top-five teams, it was
No. 3 Indiana 97, Purdue 60; No. 4 Florida 75, South Carolina
36, and No. 5 Duke 75, Wake Forest 70.  Michigan’s Trey Burke scored 18 points and Glenn Robinson
III added 13 to lift the Wolverines to 20-1 overall and 7-1 in
the Big Ten conference.  Michigan led 36-21 after a first half in which it made 10
of its first 11 shots and had no turnovers. The Wolverines
committed two turnovers in the second half to tie the national
low for any team this season, according to STATS.  “There’s been times we had two turnovers in the first
minute,”  Michigan  coach John Beilein told reporters. “We’ll
take it and we’ll move on.”  Alex Olah scored 10 points to lead the Wildcats, who fell
to 12-10 and 3-6 in the Big Ten.  To contact the reporter on this story:
