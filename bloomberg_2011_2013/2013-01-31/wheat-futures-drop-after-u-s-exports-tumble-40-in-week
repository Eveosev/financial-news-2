Wheat futures fell as exports
tumbled 40 percent from the U.S., the world’s top shipper.  The government said today that exports dropped to 387,877
metric tons of in the week ended Jan. 24 from 647,545 tons a
week earlier. Since June 1, shipments have declined 11 percent
from a year earlier, Department of Agriculture  data  show.  “Demand has been slow to get moving,” Jon Marcus, the
president of Lakefront Futures & Options LLC in Chicago, said in
a telephone interview. “Wheat has been really tired. At this
time of the year, there isn’t a whole lot of news to trade off
of.”  Wheat futures for March delivery fell 0.6 percent to $7.82
a bushel at 11:04 a.m. on the Chicago Board of Trade.  The grain has climbed 0.5 percent this month, partly on
U.S. winter-crop concerns. In 2012, the price rose 19 percent,
the most among 24  raw materials  in the Standard & Poor’s GSCI
Spot Index  Wheat is the fourth-largest U.S. crop, valued at $14.4
billion in 2011, behind corn, soybeans and hay, government data
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
