Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) ’s co-head of Global
Markets Brazil, Nuno Correia, left the company as part of a
global cost-cutting effort.  Correia’s departure comes as Deutsche Bank is “adjusting
its structure to seek improvement of its operational excellence
and to reduce expenses worldwide,” a spokeswoman for the lender
said today, asking not to be identified in keeping with company
policy. Correia won’t be replaced, she said. Fabio Ostronoff, a
vice president, also left the Frankfurt-based company.  Deutsche Bank cut employees in its Brazilian investment
bank and research units last month as part of an effort to save
4.5 billion euros ($6.1 billion) by 2015. The firm, which has
about 500 employees in Brazil including workers from outsourcing
services, didn’t say how many jobs were eliminated.  Correia declined to comment when reached by telephone.  The lender named Joel Roberto head of  investment banking  in
Brazil last week to replace Jaime Singer, who is leaving to
pursue personal projects, a spokeswoman said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
