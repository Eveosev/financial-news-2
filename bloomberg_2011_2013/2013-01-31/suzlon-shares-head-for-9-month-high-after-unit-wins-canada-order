Suzlon Energy Ltd. (SUEL) , India’s biggest
wind turbine maker, rose to its highest level in almost 10
months after its German unit won a 350 megawatt order in  Canada .  The shares surged 16 percent to 24.55 rupees, the highest
since April 4, 2012, at the close in Mumbai.  Repower Systems SE, based in Hamburg, will supply the
Canadian unit of  Electricite de France SA  175 turbines, each
capable of producing 2 megawatts of electricity, Suzlon said in
a statement to stock exchanges today.  The order, with supplies beginning this year, is Repower’s
largest contract. The win comes a week after Suzlon’s lenders
approved a 95-billion rupee ($1.78 billion) debt-restructuring
plan, which will help bring down the company’s repayment costs.
Suzlon, based in Pune, India, on Oct. 11 failed to pay $209
million, the biggest convertible note default by an Indian
company.  The first phase of 150 megawatts will start generation in
December 2014. The remaining 200 megawatts will be ready a year
later. The order is part of an initial agreement in 2009 between
Repower and EDF for 954 megawatts of  wind turbines , Suzlon said
in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
