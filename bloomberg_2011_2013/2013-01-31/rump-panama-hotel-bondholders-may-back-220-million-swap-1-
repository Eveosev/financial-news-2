Creditors of the Trump Ocean Club in
Panama are probably going to accept a restructuring deal for
$220 million of bonds, said Ajata Mediratta, a partner at
Greylock Capital Management.  Newland International Properties Corp, the Ocean Club
developer, announced a proposal today with the negotiating
committee after missing a $31.9 million amortization payment in
November 2011, said Mediratta, who leads a committee
representing more than 75 percent of defaulted bondholders.  The
Trump Ocean Club is developer Donald Trump’s  first hotel (2706)  and
apartment complex to open outside the U.S.  “This is something that’s been heavily negotiated with the
company,” Mediratta said in a telephone interview from New York
today. “The exchange committee intends to accept it and I
expect the majority of bondholders will as well.”  The agreement “may include the use of a pre-negotiated and
pre-packaged Chapter 11 process under New York law” to expedite
the restructuring, according to an e-mailed statement from
Newland today.  Newland will offer a proposal to all bondholders over the
next few weeks, John McCormack of Gapstone Group LLC, which is
advising the developer, said today in a phone interview. He
declined to disclose terms of the restructuring.  The price of the defaulted 2014 bonds rose 5.3 cents to
64.5 cents on the dollar yesterday, the last day for which
pricing is available, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
