Phil Mickelson missed a chance to
become the sixth golfer in U.S. PGA Tour history to shoot a
round of 59 in an official event when a 25-foot birdie putt on
his final hole today  caught the lip  of the cup and spun out.  Mickelson, 42, had 11 birdies in an 11-under-par round of
60 that matched the Phoenix Open course record at TPC
Scottsdale’s Stadium Course. He also had a 60 at the course in
winning the tournament in 2005.  Mickelson, who started play on the 10th hole, was 10 under
through 13 holes before pars on four of his final five holes.
His 18-foot birdie putt at the par-4 eighth hole stopped an inch
short of the cup before his attempt at matching the record
caught the lip on the right side of the ninth hole, spun around
the back and stayed out.  “You don’t get chances to shoot 59 very often and to have
that putt on line, I’m kind of mortified that didn’t go in,”
Mickelson said in a televised interview. “I couldn’t envision
which side it was going to miss on when it was a foot out. It
looked like it was right in the middle and didn’t go in.”  Mickelson started walking with his putter pointed toward
the hole. When it lipped out, he put his hand to his head in
disbelief before breaking out in a smile. Mickelson’s caddie,
Jim “Bones” Mackay, dropped to his hands and knees on the
green.  “Somehow it moved at the end low,” said Mickelson, who
holds a four-shot lead. “Even at that pace, you think it’s
going to lip in. That’s tough to take, but I’m ecstatic with 60,
don’t get me wrong.”  Record Scores  Stuart Appleby was the most recent player to shoot a 59 on
the PGA Tour, during the final round of the 2010 Greenbrier
Classic. Paul Goydos, David Duval, Chip Beck and Al Geiberger
are the only other golfers with 59s in an official PGA Tour
round. Bo Van Pelt shot a 59 yesterday during the Phoenix Open
Pro-Am.  Mickelson shot a 59 during the 2004 Grand Slam of Golf, an
unofficial event that features the four major championship
winners. In that round, the four-time major champion missed an
eagle putt on the 18th hole that would have given him a 58.  Mickelson birdied six of his final seven holes the previous
time he shot 60 at the 2005 Phoenix Open. Mark Calcavecchia
(2001) and Grant Waite (1996) also shot rounds of 60 at the
tournament at TPC Scottsdale.  Mickelson failed to break 70 in tying for 51st place at the
Farmers Insurance Open last week at Torrey Pines near San Diego.
He opened his round today with four straight birdies and birdied
eight of his first 10 holes.  To contact the reporters on this story:
