Manfra, Tordella & Brookes Inc. , a
precious-metals dealer, sued the owner of a lower  Manhattan 
building over damage to hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth
of its inventory from superstorm Sandy.  The company filed the suit against the owners of  90 Broad
Street  in  New York  State Supreme Court today, seeking more than
$4 million in damages. Manfra, Tordella & Brookes said its whole
inventory of precious metals -- which was stored in a specially
constructed vault in the sub-basement of the building -- must be
replaced, reconditioned or cleaned.  “The water severely damaged MTB’s gold and other precious
metals inventory and destroyed office files, computers and other
equipment,” the company said in a court filing. “Additionally,
the water effectively suspended MTB’s business operations for a
period of several months during what would normally have been
its busiest time of year.”  The 56-year-old company is a wholesaler and retailer of
precious metals, primarily bullion bars and coins, according to
the court filing. It also serves as one of a handful of
authorized depositories of gold, platinum and palladium for the
 New York Mercantile Exchange .  A representative of defendant 90 Broad Owner LLC couldn’t
immediately be located for comment.  The case is Manfra, Tordella & Brookes Inc. v. 90 Broad
Owner LLC, 150926/2013, New York State Supreme Court, New York
County (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
