Estonia â€™s business environment
improved last year as the number of bankruptcies declined and
more new companies were formed last year, Justice Minister Hanno Pevkur said.  The number of bankruptcies fell to 166 last year, compared
with 546 in 2009 and 492 in 2010, Pevkur, the former minister
for social affairs, told a news conference in Tallinn today,
citing preliminary data. He did not provide a figure for 2011.  Pevkur said 19,203 new businesses were registered in Estonia
last year, up 8.5 percent from 2011, helped by legal changes
allowing to start a private company without an initial share
capital contribution upon registration.  To contact the reporter on this story:
