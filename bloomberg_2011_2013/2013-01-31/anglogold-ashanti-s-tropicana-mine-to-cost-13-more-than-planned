AngloGold Ashanti Ltd. (ANG) , Africa’s
largest producer of the metal, said the cost to develop its
Tropicana gold project in Western Australia will be as much as
13 percent more than its previous estimate.  The mine will cost A$820 million ($852 million) to A$845
million to build, the Johannesburg-based company said in a
statement today. Gold production, estimated at 470,000 ounces to
490,000 ounces in the first three years, is planned to start
during the quarter through December, said AngloGold, which owns
70 percent of the project.  Independence Group NL (IGO)  has the rest.  “The West Australian construction market is overheated and
this, along with extreme skills shortages, has impacted labor
productivity and subsequently costs,” Chief Executive Officer
 Mark Cutifani , who will leave the company on March 31 to take
the helm at  Anglo American Plc (AAL) , said in the statement.  Gold producers in South Africa, where mines are getting
deeper and more difficult to operate as orebodies are depleted,
are exploring outside the country for new projects. A wave of
work stoppages since a wildcat strike at  Lonmin Plc (LMI) ’s Marikana
operation in August spread to other platinum, gold, coal and
iron-ore mines, have cut output from South African mines.  AngloGold approved the Tropicana project in November 2010
and estimated it will cost as much as A$775 million, with
production costs of A$600 per ounce. By the end of December, the
mine was 56 percent complete, the company said.  The stock  fell  for the first time in three days, losing 1.2
percent to close at 249 rand in Johannesburg, making it the
worst performer in the five-member FTSE/JSE  Africa  Gold Mining
Index after Harmony Gold Mining Co., the continent’s third-
largest producer of the metal. More than 826,000 shares changed
hands, or 73 percent of the daily average over the last three
months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
