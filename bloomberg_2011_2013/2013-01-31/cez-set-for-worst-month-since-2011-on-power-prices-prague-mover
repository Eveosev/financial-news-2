CEZ AS (CEZ)  headed for its worst monthly
slump since September 2011 on speculation record-low electricity
prices will undermine the biggest Czech utility’s future
profits.  The stock fell 0.1 percent to 614.40 koruna by 3:22 p.m. in
 Prague , taking January losses to 9.7 percent and trading close
to its lowest level since 2008 at 613 koruna reached three days
ago.  European stocks dropped and power for next-year delivery in
 Germany , where CEZ sells part of its output, slid to an all-time
low today as retail sales in the continent’s biggest economy
declined more than expected. The electricity price is set for
the worst monthly retreat since 2009 as a dispute within the
European Union over its cap-and-trade program has sent the price
of carbon-emission allowances plunging.  “Should electricity stay at these low levels for a longer
period, this would obviously gradually reduce CEZ profits,”
 Josef Nemy , an analyst at  Komercni Banka AS (KOMB)  in Prague, wrote in
e-mailed comments today.  Lower electricity prices for a longer period would not hurt
CEZ until next year because the company sold its 2013 production
before this month’s decline, Nemy said. CEZ sold 94 percent of
this year’s output in the first 10 months of 2012 while presales
for 2014 stood at 48 percent, the company said on Nov. 8.  Nemy  recommends  buying CEZ shares with a 12-month price
estimate of 740 koruna.  The electricity price slipped 1.3 percent today to 40.45
euros a megawatt-hour, the lowest level since Bloomberg began
tracking the futures contract in 2007. Carbon permits have
slumped 47 percent this month to an all-time low of 3.54 euros.  Carbon Prices  Falling carbon prices are reducing the profitability of
CEZ’s investments into low-emission technologies, Hospodarske
Noviny newspaper reported on Jan. 25, citing the company’s
Trading Director Alan Svoboda. The utility generates more than
40 percent of its output from zero-emission nuclear stations and
operates the world’s largest wind park in  Romania .  The European Parliament’s industry committee recommended a
week ago rejection of the European Commission’s proposal to curb
an excess of permits by delaying their further issuance. The
plan, designed to lift the cost of pollution and push generators
toward cleaner technologies, is mainly opposed by  Poland , which
has no nuclear reactors and relies mainly on high-emission power
stations burning brown coal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
