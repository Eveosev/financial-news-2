Areva SA (AREVA) , the French maker of atomic
reactors, reported 2012 sales that missed analysts’ estimates as
uranium mining and processing revenue dropped in the fourth
quarter.  Fourth-quarter revenue declined 4.2 percent from a year
earlier to 2.8 billion euros ($3.8 billion), the Paris-based
company said in a statement today. Full-year sales climbed 5.3
percent to 9.34 billion euros, compared with the 9.54 billion-
euro average of analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  The company, which is cutting spending and selling assets
to shore up a balance sheet that has been impaired by
construction delays at a nuclear plant in  Finland  and soured
investments in African uranium mines, reduced its 2013 earnings
forecast last month.  “The growth of sales revenue in nuclear is slightly lower
than forecast due to the shifting of deliveries initially
scheduled for the end of 2012 to the beginning of 2013,” Chief
Executive Officer Luc Oursel said in the statement, adding that
results were also hurt by “provisions recorded for a power
plant modernization project.”  Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization will exceed 1.1 billion euros in 2013, down from a
previous forecast of at least 1.25 billion euros, the company
said in December.  “Cost reduction efforts deployed throughout the group more
than offset the impacts in terms of Ebitda and free operating
cash flow expected for 2012,” Oursel said.  For 2012, Areva had forecast sales growth of 4 percent to 6
percent in the nuclear business and an Ebitda of more than 950
million euros.  The company’s backlog was little changed at 45.4 billion
euros at the end of 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
