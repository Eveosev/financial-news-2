The Philippine peso fell for the
first time in three days on concern the central bank will curb
appreciation to support exports and introduce measures to
counter excessive capital inflows.  The government is discussing the impact of peso strength,
Economic Planning Secretary Arsenio Balisacan told reporters in
 Manila  today. Central bank Governor Amando Tetangco said
yesterday he’s weighing more curbs on fund flows. Capital
inflows have boosted Philippine stocks and fueled a 5.5 percent
rally in the peso in the past 12 months, the best performance
among the region’s currencies. The economy expanded 6.8 percent
last quarter, official data showed today, exceeding the 6.3
percent median estimate in a Bloomberg survey.  “Expectations of intervention are leading to” weakness in
Asian currencies, said Saktiandi Supaat, head of foreign-
exchange research at  Malayan Banking Bhd. (MAY)  “The peso’s decline
is marginally smaller than that of other Asians because it’s
supported by the better-than-expected economic data.”  The peso weakened 0.1 percent to 40.688 per dollar in
Manila, according to Tullett Prebon Plc, paring this month’s
gain to 0.9 percent. It reached 40.550 on Jan. 14, the strongest
level since March 2008.  One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves
in the  exchange rate  used to price options, fell 20 basis
points, or 0.2 percentage point, to 4.3 percent.  Foreign investors bought $620 million more Philippine
stocks than they sold this month through yesterday, according to
exchange data.  Government bonds  were steady, with the yield on the 3.875
percent bonds due November 2019 holding at 3.73 percent,
according to prices from Tradition Financial Services. The rate
was 4.25 percent at the end of last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
