Croatia  has completed all
requirements needed for its European Union entry on July 1 ahead
of the European Commission’s final assessment in the spring,
Foreign Minister Vesna Pusic said.  European Enlargement Commissioner Stefan Fule on Oct. 10
outlined 10 areas in which Croatia needed to improve, such as
completing the sale of state-owned shipyards, enhancing border
crossings with Bosnia-Herzegovina on the Adriatic coast, and
improving conflict-of-interest and freedom-of-information laws.  “Our last remaining issue was the sale of shipyards, and
that is resolved,” Pusic told reporters in Brussels today.  Croatia is set to become the 28th member of the world’s
largest trading bloc nine years after Slovenia became the first
former Yugoslav republic to join the EU.  The Adriatic nation, which is trying to emerge out of its
second recession in two years, stands to receive 10 billion
euros ($13.5 billion) in EU funds through 2020.  To contact the reporter on this story:
