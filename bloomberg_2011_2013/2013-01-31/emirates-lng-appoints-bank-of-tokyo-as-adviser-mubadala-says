Emirates LNG, which plans to import
liquefied natural gas into the  United Arab Emirates , appointed
Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd. as its financial adviser,
according to one of the company’s shareholders.  Mubadala Development Co. and International Petroleum
Investment Co., two Abu Dhabi state-owned investment funds, are
partners in the project to develop a receiving terminal at
Fujairah on the U.A.E.’s eastern coast to import LNG, gas cooled
to a liquid for transport by seaborne tanker.  Emirates LNG was formed as a project company to develop
technical and financial plans for the facility and is consulting
with Bank of Tokyo as its adviser, Kelly Thomson, Mubadala’s
head of structured finance, said at a conference in Dubai on
Jan. 29. The company will further develop the scope of the
project before settling on financing plans, she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
