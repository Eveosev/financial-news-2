LDK Solar Co. (LDK) , the second-biggest
maker of wafers used to make solar cells, received approval for
a 440 million yuan ($71 million) loan from  China Development
Bank  Corp. to upgrade its Mahong polysilicon facility.  LDK will use the loan to invest in hydrochlorination
technology that will cut production costs, according to a
statement on its website yesterday. The company said it has
invested more than 12 billion yuan in the facility, swelling its
debt burden.  Manufacturers of the raw material for solar panels have
seen a 43 percent decline in the average spot price in the past
year due to excess supply, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The plunge has led some companies including Ningxia
Sunshine Silicon Co. to file for bankruptcy.  China Development Bank in 2010 extended as much as 60
billion  yuan  to LDK in a five-year credit facility. The Mahong
plant had a capacity to produce 15,800 metric tons of
polysilicon annually, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance.  LDKâ€™s American depositary receipts, each worth one ordinary
share, jumped 9.1 percent to $1.68 at the close in  New York 
yesterday, the most since Jan. 4.  To contact the reporters on this story:
