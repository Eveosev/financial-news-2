Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank PJSC (ADCB) 
surged to the highest level in more than four years after the
third-biggest United Arab Emirates bank by assets boosted its
annual dividend, stoking optimism other lenders will follow.  The stock jumped 3.5 percent to 3.55 dirhams, the strongest
level since September 2008, at the close in Abu Dhabi, bringing
this month’s gain to 18 percent. ADCB was the second-biggest
gainer on the benchmark  ADX General Index, (ADSMI)  which rallied 1.1
percent today.  First Gulf Bank PJSC (FGB)  led the increase by index
points with an advance of 2.4 percent after full-year net income
at the lender controlled by Abu Dhabi’s ruling family rose.  ADCB “reported excellent results with growth in net income
and handsome dividends,” said Nabil Farhat, a partner at Abu
Dhabi-based Al Fajer Securities. “Investors are searching for
high-yielding stocks, mainly banks.”  ADCB said it would pay a  25 percent cash dividend  for 2012
compared with 20 percent the year earlier after  fourth-quarter
 net income rose 19 percent, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Abu Dhabi banks have a  dividend yield  of 4.2 percent,
compared with 3.1 percent for the  Bloomberg GCC 200 Financial
Index. (BGCCFINL)  U.A.E. banks are recovering from the impact of the global
credit crisis which slowed lending, hit investment banking and
led to a surge in loan-loss charges as defaults rose.  Shares of First Gulf advanced to 12.8 dirhams, the highest
close since August 2008. The company recommended a  cash dividend 
of 83 fils per share for 2012.  In Dubai,  Emirates NBD PJSC (EMIRATES) , the biggest U.A.E. bank,
raised its cash dividend to 25 fils, after paying 20 fils in
each of the previous three years. The stock, which was unchanged
at 3.8 dirhams today, rallied 33 percent this month and has a
12-month dividend yield of 5.3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
