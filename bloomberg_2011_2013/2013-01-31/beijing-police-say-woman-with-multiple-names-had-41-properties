A woman from northwestern  China ’s
Shaanxi province who had multiple identities owned 41 properties
in Beijing totaling 9,666.6 square meters (104,050 square feet),
Beijing’s police department said.  The properties include homes,  office space , commercial
buildings and parking spaces, the Beijing Public Security Bureau
said on its Sina Corp. Twitter-like Weibo page.  The woman, a former bank official named Gong Aiai, had four
household registrations and the police officials who were
responsible for administering her registration in Beijing have
been suspended, the state-run Xinhua News Agency reported on
Jan. 24.  The revelations come amid a crackdown on corruption
initiated after Xi Jinping became the ruling Communist Party’s
General Secretary in November. Chinese leaders including Xi have
said corruption and official malfeasance risk weakening the
party’s grip on power.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
