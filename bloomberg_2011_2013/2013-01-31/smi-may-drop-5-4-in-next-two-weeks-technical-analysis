Stocks in  Switzerland  may drop more
than 5 percent by the middle of February, after the benchmark
Swiss Market Index climbed to a 4 1/2-year high on Jan. 28.  The equity benchmark could decline to 6,990 if it fails to
break above a level of 7,518.47, said Ouri Mimran, a technical
strategist at Natixis in Paris. That’s a drop of 5.4 percent
from yesterday’s close. The resistance represents the 61.8
percent  Fibonacci retracement  of the decline from June 2007
through March 2009 during the financial crisis.  “The SMI is approaching a barrier that could hold in the
coming sessions,” Mimran said. “A technical correction could
take place. We’re targeting 6,990, which represents the  April
2010 high . It’s also not far from the 50 percent retracement
level of 6,891.”  The SMI has surged 8.3 percent since the end of December,
posting its best start to a year since 1988, when the index came
into being, as U.S. lawmakers agreed on a compromise budget and
the Swiss franc weakened against the euro. Still, the gauge
dropped 0.9 percent to 7,387.9 yesterday.  The SMI and its 14-day relative strength index, which
measures how rapidly prices rise and fall, have diverged,
indicating that Swiss shares will decline, Mimran said.  The RSI (SMI) 
reached a high of 83.35 on Jan. 17 and then failed to climb
higher in subsequent trading days. The SMI set an intraday high
of 7,457.65 on Jan. 18 and then extended its advance to 7,495.83
on Jan. 28.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
