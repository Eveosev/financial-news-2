Altria Group Inc. (MO) , the largest
seller of tobacco in the U.S., said fourth-quarter profit rose
32 percent as it boosted Marlboro cigarette prices.  Net income increased to $1.1 billion, or 55 cents a share,
from $836 million, or 41 cents, a year earlier, the Richmond,
Virginia-based company said today in a statement. Analysts
projected 55 cents, the average of 11  estimates  compiled by
Bloomberg.  Altria’s Philip Morris USA business raised prices on all
cigarette brands by 6 cents a pack in December following a 6-
cent increase in June. Marlboro’s share of U.S. smokers
increased to 42.6 percent in the fourth quarter from 41.6
percent a year earlier after promotions spurred demand for new
varieties of the top-selling U.S. cigarette brand.  “Philip Morris continues to take cigarette share,” Bonnie Herzog, an analyst at Wells Fargo & Co. in New York, wrote today
in a note. She has an outperform rating on the shares, the
equivalent of a buy.  Altria, which also produces Copenhagen snuff, Black & Mild
cigars and Chateau Ste. Michelle wine, said it will earn $2.35 a
share to $2.41 a share in 2013. Analysts project earnings of
$2.38, on average. Profit last year was $2.21, excluding some
items.  The shares slipped 0.1 percent to $33.68 at the close in
New York. Altria has advanced for four straight years, including
a 6 percent gain in 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
