Ethanol strengthened against
gasoline for the first time in almost two weeks after the Obama
administration reaffirmed the nation’s renewable fuel standards
and as plant shutdowns reduced output to record levels.  The spread narrowed 1.49 cents to 56.78 cents a gallon a
day after the Environmental Protection Agency proposed rules to
raise the country’s renewable fuel use to 16.55 billion gallons
from 15.2 billion in 2012. A 2007 energy law requires the use of
36 billion gallons of biofuels by 2022.  “It seemed to put the market into a buying frenzy, until
people realized” that it was expected, said  Ian Jackson , a
trader at SCB & Associates LLC in  Chicago . “It was a little
flash in the pan.”  Denatured ethanol for February delivery rose 0.2 cent to
$2.458 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade, the highest price
since Oct. 11. Futures advanced 12 percent in January, the first
monthly gain since October and the biggest since July.  Gasoline for February delivery slumped 1.29 cents, or 0.4
percent, to $3.0258 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . The contract covers reformulated gasoline, which is
made to be blended with ethanol.  The discount of the grain-based additive to gasoline
contracted for the first time since Jan. 18 and snapped
ethanol’s longest streak of losses versus the motor fuel since
February 2010.  Under the EPA  proposal , 9.6 percent of all fuel used this
year will come from renewable sources.  Production Slips  Ethanol also rose on shrinking production. The Energy
Information Administration said  output  fell to 770,000 barrels a
day last week, the least since the Energy Department’s
analytical division began tracking weekly data in June 2010.  “The production numbers we’ve been seeing the last few
weeks have been really poor and we’re starting to see that
affect the market,” said Julie Ward, assistant vice president
at R.J. O’Brien & Associates, a broker in  Des Moines ,  Iowa .  Eighteen ethanol plants have been idled since June as the
worst drought since the 1930s baked corn crops and raised costs
for producers, said Geoff Cooper, vice president of research and
analysis at the  Renewable Fuels Association , a Washington-based
trade group.  Corn for March delivery added 0.25 cent to $7.405 a bushel
in Chicago. One bushel makes at least 2.75 gallons of ethanol.  Based on March contracts, producers are losing 23 cents on
each gallon of the fuel, up from 22 cents yesterday, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. The figures exclude the revenue
that can be made from the sale of dried distillers’ grains, a
byproduct of ethanol production that can be fed to livestock.  Brazil Ethanol  The fuel also strengthened against gasoline after Brazil,
which uses sugarcane as a feedstock, said yesterday that it will
increase its ethanol mix in gasoline to 25 percent in May from
20 percent, Ward said.  “That just might have a psychological effect,” she said.
“ Brazil ’s been bringing in a lot and maybe the market is having
a knee-jerk reaction.”  Spot ethanol in Sao Paulo  cost $2.13 a gallon in the week
ended Jan. 25, data compiled by Bloomberg show, about 13 percent
cheaper than today’s U.S. futures price.  The country was the primary exporter of ethanol to the U.S.
through the first 10 months of 2012, the most recent EIA  data 
shows.  Demand for ethanol in the U.S. last week was lower than it
was a year ago. Ethanol-blended gasoline made up 87 percent of
the total U.S. gasoline pool in the week ended Jan. 25, down
from 90 percent a year earlier, EIA data showed.  Ethanol advanced in most spot market regions. The fuel rose
1.5 cents to $2.565 a gallon in  New York  Harbor, 4 cents to
$2.45 in Chicago and 3 cents to $2.505 on the  Gulf Coast . It was
unchanged at $2.615 on the West Coast.  The value of Renewable Identification Numbers, known as
RINs, rose 27 percent to 30.5 cents for corn-based ethanol, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. The advanced forms climbed 1.5
cents, or 3.1 percent, to 50 cents. The EPA also proposed
changes intended to boost confidence in trading of RINs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
