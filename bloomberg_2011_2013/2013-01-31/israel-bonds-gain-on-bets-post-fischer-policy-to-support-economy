Israel ’s benchmark government bonds
rose, sending the yield lower for the first time in five days,
on bets central bank policy will continue to support the economy
once Stanley Fischer steps down as governor.  The yield on the 4.25 percent Mimshal Shiklit notes
maturing in March 2023 dropped one basis point, or 0.01
percentage point, to 4.09 percent at the close in Tel Aviv, the
lowest level since since Jan. 29, when Fischer announced his
early resignation. The yield jumped eight basis points on Jan.
29 on the news, triggering concern that Fischer’s policies,
which helped the economy recover from the global financial
crisis, may be interrupted.  “There was some sort of panic after the announcement and
now the market has balanced out,” Yshai Shilo, a bond trader at
I.B.I.-Israel Brokerage & Investments Ltd. said today by phone
from Tel Aviv. “Investors understand that the bank is in good
hands and there are suitable candidates to replace him.”  Fischer, who has led the central bank since 2005, said
yesterday there are several good candidates to take his job when
he leaves in June. The shekel strengthened for the first time in
five days, gaining 0.2 percent to 3.7216 a dollar, taking its
advance this month to 0.3 percent, according to prices compiled
by Bloomberg.  Two-year interest-rate swaps , a reflection of investor
expectations for rates, also dropped for the first time in three
days, declining four basis points to 1.87 percent. Under
Fischer’s lead, the central bank’s monetary policy committee
gradually lowered the key interest rate by 1.5 percentage points
since 2011 to 1.75 percent to spur the economy, which has
suffered from the fallout of the  European debt crisis .  Supporting Growth  Israel gets about 40 percent of gross domestic product from
exports, and the U.S. and  Europe  are key destinations for its
products. Economic growth slowed to 3.3 percent last year from
4.6 percent in 2011, according to statistics bureau data.  Israel’s unemployment rate was 6.9 percent in 2012 and rose
to 6.9 percent in December from a revised November rate of 6.8
percent, the statistics bureau said today. Annual inflation in
December was 1.6 percent, within the central bank’s target range
of 1 percent to 3 percent.  Consumer price rises may average 2.23 percent in the next
two years, according to the two-year break-even rate. The rate,
which reflects the yield difference between the inflation-linked
bonds and similar-maturity fixed-rate government debt, rose for
a third day, adding five basis points to 223.  The Tel Aviv Bond 40 Index, which measures inflation-linked
and fixed-rate corporate bonds, advanced 0.1 percent to 281.84
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
