Ukraine plans to stop two vessels
which are loading wheat in contravention to an export limit
agreed to between traders and the government, industry group
Agrarian Confederation reported on its  website .  The Confederation cited First Deputy Agriculture Minister
Ivan Bisyuk in its report, which didn’t specify how much wheat
was being loaded in the southern ports.  A 6 million metric ton limit on wheat exports for the
marketing year which ends in July was reached in December,
according to the  Agriculture Ministry . Ukraine’s harvest fell 29
percent to 15.76 million tons this year due to drought,
according to the state statistics office.  The government may revise the wheat export policy as early
as the end of March, when the condition of winter wheat and
possible stockpiles becomes clear, according to the Agrarian
Confederation’s report.  -- Editors: Sharon Lindores, Nicholas Larkin  To contact the reporter on this story:
