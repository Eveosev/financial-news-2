European stocks  fell for a second
day, paring their biggest monthly advance since July, as
companies from AstraZeneca Plc to  Banco Santander SA (SAN)  slid after
reporting earnings.  AstraZeneca lost 3.2 percent after the drugmaker forecast
that profit and sales will slide this year. Santander and Royal
Dutch Shell Group Plc both declined more than 2.5 percent as
fourth-quarter earnings missed analysts’ estimates.  The  Stoxx Europe 600 Index (SXXP)  retreated 0.5 percent to 287.22
at the close, as more than two stocks fell for every one that
rose. The equity benchmark has still advanced 2.7 percent in
January, its eighth month of gains and its longest winning
streak since 1997.  “Over the last six months, we’ve had a big re-rating of
stocks, but we haven’t had the earnings power coming through,”
Toby Nangle, head of multi-asset allocation at Threadneedle
Asset Management told Francine Lacqua on Bloomberg Television.
“Earnings are going to be critical. We need to get delivery on
what we’ve already paid for.”  The valuation for the Stoxx 600 has climbed to 12.2 times
estimated earnings from a price-earnings ratio of 10.6 at the
end of June. Some 19 companies on the Stoxx 600 report earnings
today, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. In western
Europe, 59 percent of companies reporting earnings since Jan. 8
have beaten analysts’ estimates. About 56 percent have exceeded
projections for revenue.  National benchmark indexes retreated in 15 of the 18
western-European markets today.  France ’s CAC 40 dropped 0.9
percent and the U.K.’s FTSE 100 slid 0.7 percent, while
 Germany ’s DAX lost 0.5 percent.  Stock Pickers  “What’s interesting in this environment, with growth quite
challenged, is the stock dispersion has been much greater,”
said London-based Nangle. “So you are seeing good earnings
being much better and bad earnings being really punished by the
market -- that’s great for stock pickers.”  AstraZeneca (AZN)  slid 3.2 percent to 3,053 pence, its biggest
selloff in nine months, after forecasting falling profit because
of increased competition from generic medicines.  Sales will decline by a “mid- to high-single digit
percentage” at constant exchange rates in 2013, compared with
the average analyst projection of a 3 percent slide. The company
also said earnings fell for a fourth straight quarter.  Santander Slides  Santander declined 3.5 percent to 6.18 euros as Spain’s
largest lender set aside money for further loan losses in its
home market. The bank reported fourth-quarter profit of 401
million euros ($545 million), missing the 801.6 million-euro
 average estimate  of 11 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Shell fell 2.8 percent to 2,241 pence after  Europe ’s
biggest oil company reported  fourth-quarter profit , excluding
one-off items and inventory changes, of $5.6 billion. That
missed the $6.2 billion average analyst estimate in a Bloomberg
survey. Net income advanced 3 percent to $6.7 billion.  Anheuser-Busch InBev NV tumbled 7.8 percent to 63.90 euros,
its biggest drop since January 2009. The U.S. Justice Department
sued to prevent the company from purchasing the half of Grupo
Modelo SAB that it doesn’t already own for $20.1 billion. The
regulator said the deal would hurt competition in the U.S. beer
market. AB InBev said it no longer expects to complete the deal
in the first quarter of this year.  TeliaSonera AB (TLSN)  slid 1.7 percent to 45.89 kronor as  Sweden ’s
largest phone company said that fourth-quarter earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and one-off items
declined 3.2 percent to 8.97 billion kronor ($1.4 billion).  Lonmin Plc posted the biggest gain on the Stoxx 600,
surging 14 percent to 360 pence. The mining company reported a
17 percent increase in platinum sales in the first quarter,
saying it has successfully restarted and increased production.  Ericsson, STMicro  Ericsson AB rallied 7.6 percent to 74 kronor. The world’s
largest maker of wireless networks reported a 5 percent increase
in revenue for the fourth quarter to 66.9 billion kronor,
exceeding the  average analyst estimate  of 65.8 billion kronor.
The company also reported a net loss of 6.46 billion kronor
after writing off its wireless-chip alliance with
 STMicroelectronics (STM)  NV.  STMicroelectronics gained 4.1 percent to 6.39 euros,
rebounding from an earlier loss of as much as 3.6 percent, as
the chipmaker finalizes plans to pull out of ST-Ericsson by the
third quarter. Ericsson has said that the two companies may shut
down their joint venture.  Infineon Technologies AG climbed 3.9 percent to 6.65 euros
after Europe’s second-biggest chipmaker forecast that earnings
will improve in the current quarter as demand from the car
industry increases. Sales will probably climb by a “mid-single-
digit” percentage, the company said.  The volume of shares changing hands on the Stoxx 600 was 24
percent greater than the average of the last 30 days, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
