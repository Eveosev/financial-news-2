Cobbetts LLP, which has almost 500
employees in four offices, becomes the first major U.K.  law firm 
to seek protection from creditors since 2010.  The firm, the 62nd-largest by revenue in the U.K., said the
weak economy led it to the decision to appoint administrators to
find a buyer.  “The appropriate course at this time is for the firm to
obtain the protection of an interim statutory moratorium to
enable a sale of the business,” Cobbetts said in an e-mailed
statement.  “We are in an environment where the legal market across
the U.K. looks pretty flat,” said Tony Williams, principal at
Jomati Consultants LLP. “Winners and losers are starting to
emerge and Cobbetts is a firm that was squeezed from all
sides.”  Halliwells LLP went into administration in 2010 in the face
of mounting debt and a number of failed merger discussions. U.S.
law firm Dewey & LeBoeuf LLP filed for bankruptcy in May after
its chairman was ousted, almost all its partners quit and
creditors began suing for unpaid bills.  Cobbetts, known for its real estate and midmarket corporate
work, had revenue of 45.4 million pounds ($71.7 million) in the
2011-12 financial year, according to Legal Business Magazine.
The firm has offices in Birmingham, Leeds, London and
Manchester.  Patrick Names Former Staff Chief Cowan to Kerry Senate Seat  Massachusetts Governor  Deval Patrick  appointed his former
chief of staff, William “Mo” Cowan, a former partner at Mintz
Levin Cohn Ferris Glovsky & Popeo PC, to replace  John Kerry  for
five months, making him the only black member of the  Democratic
Party  in the  U.S. Senate .  Kerry, a Democrat whom the Senate confirmed as the next
secretary of state Jan. 29, plans to resign his seat Feb. 1 and
Cowan will fill it until a June 25 special election. A graduate
of  Duke University  and Northeastern University Law School in
 Boston , Cowen most recently was a special adviser to Patrick.  “His service on the front lines in our effort to manage
the worst economy in 80 years and build a better and stronger
commonwealth for the next generation has given him an intimate
understanding of the issues we face,” Patrick said yesterday at
a news conference at the Statehouse in Boston. He called the
appointment an “affirmation of the American dream.”  Cowan, 43, said there would be “no daylight” between his
policies and those of Kerry, and that he won’t run for the seat.
Kerry is replacing Secretary of State  Hillary Clinton .  “I’m here to do the work of Kerry,” he said. “This is a
temporary assignment.”  For more, click here.  Delaware Needs a Fifth Federal Judge, U.S. Judicial Panel Says  Delaware , home to courts that specialize in business cases,
needs a fifth federal judge to help the district court keep up
with increasing corporate litigation, a panel of judges
concluded.  If the recommendation by a subcommittee of the  Judicial
Conference of the U.S.  is accepted in March, Congress will be
asked to create a position as the number of U.S. patent suits is
rising.  “It makes sense to add capacity for dealing with this
situation, which most of us expect to persist,” Frank Scherkenbach, a patent attorney at Fish & Richardson PC whose
clients included Microsoft Corp., said in an e-mail. “It makes
sense to add that capacity in one of the courts most affected by
these recent trends.”  Delaware handles more patent cases per judge than any of
the other 93 federal districts, with 179 cases filed for each of
the four judges from September 2011 to June 2012, according to
the Judicial Conference. During the same period, all types of
cases climbed in the state, putting the load at 1,077 cases per
judge, second-highest in the U.S.  The subcommittee met in December and issued a memorandum
outlining its recommendation earlier this month.  Business costs rose more than fourfold since 2005 over
royalty demands filed by patent owners seeking quick profits,
according to a study by Boston University School of Law.  Companies face $29 billion in expenses from 5,842 claims of
infringement filed in 2011 by so-called non-practicing entities,
patent owners collecting license fees instead of making
products. That’s up from 1,401 claims and $6.6 billion in costs
in 2005, according to the study, published in June.  The court vies with the Eastern District of  Texas  as the
busiest courthouse when it comes to new patent-infringement
filings, according to an April 2012 study by  James Pistorino , a
lawyer with Perkins Coie LLP in Palo Alto, California.  For more, click here.  French Lawyers Turn Google Defeat Into Must-Have Counsel: Taxes  French tax raids against companies like  Google Inc. (GOOG)  are
becoming so common that a cottage industry is springing up among
lawyers.  France’s biggest law firm put together 17 pages on “Your
Company in the Face of a Tax Raid” as a primer last week. Tax
Executives Institute Inc. is hosting classes for members on the
tax effects of cloud computing and may create a whole set of
recommendations after Google lost a high-profile French case
last year, Bloomberg BNA reported.  The tax administration is more and more willing to raid
offices and seize proof companies have permanent establishments
in France and are avoiding taxes, according to Fidal Direction
Internationale, the top law firm. The government issued a report
on Jan. 18 urging tighter international rules to curb ways that
global Internet companies such as  Amazon.com (AMZN)  Inc.,  Apple Inc. (AAPL) ,
 Facebook (FB)  Inc.,  EBay Inc. (EBAY)  and Google limit their taxes.  “The authorities’ tendency to assimilate tax optimization
and  tax fraud  should not be underestimated,” Audrey-Laure
Illouz, the Paris-based tax partner who edited Fidal Direction’s
guidebook, wrote in the introduction.  Her practical advice on dealing with raids authorized under
article L. 16B of the French tax procedure code includes not
leaving the inspectors alone “even for a short moment” and to
try and limit what they take to only what seemed to be listed in
the warrant.  For more, click here.  Attorney Pleads Guilty to Conspiring to Help Rothstein Wife  A Florida attorney who represented the wife of convicted
Ponzi schemer Scott Rothstein pleaded guilty to conspiring to
help her hide expensive jewelry from the  Internal Revenue
Service .  Scott Saidel, 45, admitted yesterday in federal court in
Fort Lauderdale, Florida, that he conspired to help Kimberly
Rothstein sell jewelry, including a 12-carat diamond that she
was supposed to turn over to federal authorities after her
husband’s $1.2 billion  Ponzi scheme  collapsed in November 2009.  “He has accepted responsibility for his actions,”
Saidel’s attorney, Tama Kudman, said outside of court after the
hearing.  The Ponzi scheme orchestrated by Scott Rothstein involved
persuading wealthy investors to buy stakes in what he said were
payouts in confidential sexual harassment and workplace
discrimination lawsuits. The cases were fabricated. Rothstein
used forged court documents and phony bank records to sell the
scheme to investors, including four  hedge funds  and several
wealthy South Florida businessmen.  The scheme fell apart over Halloween weekend 2009 when he
was unable to bring in new investors to pay off old ones. He
fled to Morocco, but returned a few days later and has
cooperated with federal authorities and the trustee appointed in
the bankruptcy of his former Fort Lauderdale law firm,
Rothstein, Rosenfeldt & Adler.  The case is U.S. v. Saidel, 12-cr-60204, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of Florida (Fort Lauderdale).  For more, click here.  Deals  Kinder Morgan Buys Copano for $3.2 Billion, Adds Shale  Weil Gotshal & Manges LLP and Bracewell & Giuliani LLP

share, about 23 percent more than  Copano’s (CPNO)  closing price of
$33.13 on Jan. 29, the Houston-based company said yesterday in a
statement. Including preferred shares and debt, the acquisition
is worth about $5 billion, according to the statement.  The deal adds Copano’s interests in about 6,900 miles
(11,100 kilometers) of pipelines and nine plants to Kinder
Morgan Energy’s 46,000 miles of lines, according to the
statement. Copano expands Kinder Morgan’s reach into the
gathering and processing business, which includes pipelines that
move gas from wells to delivery points and processing plants
that strip out valuable liquids such as ethane and propane.  For more, click here.  Firm News  Jackson Lewis to Open an Office in Puerto Rico  Employment law firm Jackson Lewis LLP is opening an office

withhold from the U.S. documents detailing its calculations for
the oil flow rate during the 2010  Gulf of Mexico  spill,
prosecutors said.  The company’s guilty plea to criminal charges means it
can’t assert attorney-client privilege to keep the information
confidential, prosecutors said yesterday in a filing in federal
court in New Orleans. Since BP’s lawyers were “intimately
involved” in aiding the company’s criminal conduct, the
customary shield over their work is eliminated, the U.S. said.  BP Exploration & Production Inc. on Jan. 29 won final
approval of its plea to 14 criminal counts related to the
explosion of the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig, which killed 11
workers and sparked the worst offshore  oil spill  in U.S.
history. Among those charges was a count for obstructing justice
by lying to the  U.S. Congress  about the size of the spill, which
the government said dumped more than 4.1 million barrels of
crude into the gulf.  “Because BP used its attorneys to aid in its wrongdoing,
it can no longer claim privilege with respect to communications
related to developing the flow-rate information and
communications forming the basis of BP’s false and misleading
statements,” prosecutors said in the filing. This applies even
if the lawyers were unaware they were aiding criminal conduct,
the government said.  BP previously admitted in court papers “that the
preparation of the false and misleading documents in question
were attorney-directed efforts,” according to the filing. BP’s
fraudulent statements were “drafted in a collaborative process
led by  Wilmer Hale  and involving both in-house and external
lawyers,” government lawyers said.  Wilmer Hale Pickering Hale and Dorr LLP , a 1,000-lawyer
corporate defense firm based primarily in Boston and Washington
D.C., had no immediate comment on the government filing, Molly
Nunes, a firm spokeswoman, said today.  BP initially told the government and the public that the
flow rate was from 1,000 to 5,000 barrels a day, when internal
estimates pegged the rate as high as 96,000 barrels a day,
prosecutors said.  “Nothing in the plea deprives BP of the right to invoke
the core protections provided under federal law,”  Scott Dean , a
spokesman for London-based BP, said in an e-mailed statement.
“We will respond to the government’s motion on a schedule set
by the court.”  BP agreed to pay $4 billion in fines and penalties to
resolve all criminal charges tied to the fatal explosion and
spill. BP pleaded guilty to 11 counts of felony seaman’s
manslaughter and two counts of violating federal environmental
protection laws.  Separately, BP entered a consent judgment with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission to pay an additional $525
million for lying about the size of the spill.  Prosecutors yesterday asked U.S. District Judge  Carl
Barbier  in New Orleans to force BP to turn over copies of “all
previously withheld documents” related to flow-rate estimates
BP executives provided Congress and the SEC during the first
months of the spill, according to the filing.  The case is In re Oil Spill by the Oil Rig “Deepwater
Horizon” in the Gulf of Mexico on April 20, 2010; 2:10-md-2179,
U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Louisiana (New
Orleans).  For more, click here.  To contact the reporter on this story:
