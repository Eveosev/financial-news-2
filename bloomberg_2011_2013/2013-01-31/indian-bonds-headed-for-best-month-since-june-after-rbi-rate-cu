India’s benchmark bonds completed
their best month since June after the central bank cut  interest
rates  for the first time since April.  The  Reserve Bank of India  reduced its repurchase  rate  by 25
basis points to 7.75 percent on Jan. 29 and predicted the
economy will  expand  5.5 percent in the year ending March 31, the
least since 2003. Governor Duvvuri Subbarao also cut the amount
of deposits lenders must set aside as  reserves  to 4 percent from
4.25 percent, effective Feb. 9, releasing 180 billion rupees
($3.4 billion) into the banking system.  “Yields will continue to soften in the coming months in a
gradual manner,” said  Anoop Verma , a fixed-income trader at
 Development Credit Bank Ltd. (DEVB)  in Mumbai. “The timing of the next
rate cut will be dictated by macro-economic data as the central
bank seeks to maintain a cautious balance between growth and
inflation.”  The yield on the 8.15 percent bonds due June 2022 fell 14
basis points, or 0.14 percentage point, this month to 7.91
percent in Mumbai, according to the central bank’s trading
system. It rose two basis points today. The rate touched 7.80
percent on Jan. 14, the lowest level for a benchmark 10-year
bond since July 2010.  The RBI will reduce the repo rate further by 50 basis
points in 2013, Verma predicted. The monetary authority cut this
week its inflation estimate for March to 6.8 percent from 7.5
percent.  “There is an increasing likelihood of inflation remaining
range-bound around current levels going into 2013-2014,” the
 Reserve Bank  said in its policy review on Jan. 29. “This
provides space, albeit limited, for monetary policy to give
greater emphasis to growth risks.”  The one-year interest-rate swap, a derivative contract used
to guard against fluctuations in funding costs, rose two basis
points this month to 7.63 percent in Mumbai, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
