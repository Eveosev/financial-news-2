Copper trimmed the biggest monthly
advance since September as the  U.S. economy  unexpectedly shrank
in the fourth quarter. Aluminum, zinc and nickel also fell.  Metal for delivery in three months dropped as much as 0.2
percent to $8,207.50 a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange,
before trading at $8,212 by 11:01 a.m.  Shanghai  time. The
contract headed for 3.6 percent rally this month. Copper for
March delivery on the Comex in  New York  declined 0.3 percent to
$3.7395 per pound.  Gross domestic product fell at a 0.1 percent annual rate,
weaker than any economist forecast in a Bloomberg survey and the
worst performance since the second quarter of 2009. The Fed will
keep buying securities at a rate of $85 billion a month, the
 Federal Open Market Committee  said after a two-day meeting. The
dollar traded near a 14-month low versus the euro.  “The rally in the copper price this month is driven by the
expectation of a better global economy this year, not by a
substantial improvement on the physical market,” Ma Jian, an
analyst at Orient Futures Co., said by phone from Shanghai.
“Having said that, we still expect it to keep up the relatively
strong momentum heading into February.”  Rio Tinto Group, the second-biggest mining company, is
considering a temporary halt to construction work at its $6.2
billion Oyu Tolgoi copper and gold project in Mongolia as the
government demands a greater share of profit, according to two
people familiar with the plans.  The May contract on the Shanghai Futures Exchange rose 0.4
percent to 59,480  yuan  ($9,564) a ton.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
