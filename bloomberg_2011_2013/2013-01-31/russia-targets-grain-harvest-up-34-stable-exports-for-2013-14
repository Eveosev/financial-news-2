Russia , the world’s third-biggest
 wheat exporter  in 2011-12, aims to raise the grain harvest 34
percent to 95 million metric tons for the 2013-14 season and to
have stable exports, Agriculture Minister Nikolai Fedorov said.  “This is what we need to have a good domestic market and
export potential, as well as to keep Russia playing its role on
global food market,” Fedorov told reporters in Moscow today.  Russia’s harvest was damaged by drought this season,
curbing exports. The grain crop shrank 25 percent to 70.7
million metric tons, and the wheat harvest was 33 percent
smaller at 37.7 million tons, according to Agriculture Ministry
data. The country hasn’t restricted shipments as it did in 2010
when it banned exports following a severe drought.  Exports this season are forecast to be 14.8 million tons,
46 percent lower than a year earlier, according to the ministry.
For 2013-14 the shipment potential is expected to be at least 15
million tons, Fedorov said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
