Former National Football League
cornerback William James was sentenced to seven months in prison
for failing to file an income tax return with the Internal
Revenue Service.  James, 33, pleaded guilty last May 23 in federal court in
Camden, New Jersey. He admitted that he failed to file a return
in 2005, when his salary was $5.5 million. James played
professional football from 2001 to 2010 with the  New York 
Giants, Philadelphia Eagles, Jacksonville Jaguars, Detroit Lions
and San Francisco 49ers.  “Although he had repeatedly been advised by the IRS and by
his personal accountant that he was obligated to file a tax
return, James ignored their notices and failed to file a
return,” U.S. Attorney Paul Fishman said in a statement.  James, who was formerly known as William J. Peterson,
already has served four months in custody. He agreed in pleading
guilty to pay back taxes and penalties of $470,254.  Lori Koch, his federal public defender, didn’t immediately
return a call seeking comment on the sentence.  The case is U.S. v. James, 12-cr-363, U.S. District Court,
District of New Jersey (Camden).  To contact the reporter on this story:
