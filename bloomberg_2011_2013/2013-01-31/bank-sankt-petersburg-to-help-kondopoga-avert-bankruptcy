The Republic of Karelia, a region in
 Russia ’s northwest, picked OAO Bank Sankt-Petersburg to help
pulp and paper producer OAO Kondopoga avert bankruptcy.  Kondopoga, the biggest Russia’s newsprint paper producer,
has debts of as much as 10 billion rubles ($332 million), the
Karelia regional government said in a statement on its website
today.  OAO Sberbank (SBER) , UralSib,  OAO VTB (VTBR)  and OAO Bank Vorozhdenie
are among the plant’s creditors, while Bank Sankt-Petersburg
will manage the debt restructuring and further investments in
the Kondopoga’s development, the administration said.  “The bank has experience in anti-crisis management in
diversified areas and expects deep improvements at the plant,”
the Karelia press service said, citing Alexander Khoudilainen,
the republic’s governor.  Bank Sankt-Petersburg is expecting proposals from Karelia
officials to manage the factory, said bank spokeswoman Anna
Barkhatova. She declined to comment further as the agreement
hasn’t been signed.  OAO Kondopoga produced 750,000 tons of newsprint paper in
2012 and claims about 39 percent of the Russian market.  To contact the reporter on this story:
