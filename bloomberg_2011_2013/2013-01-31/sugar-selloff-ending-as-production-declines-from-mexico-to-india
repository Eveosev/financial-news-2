Sugar output is poised to drop for
the first time since 2009 as farmers from  Mexico  to  India  cut
plantings after the biggest two-year price slump since 1999.  Global output will decline to 165 million metric tons in
the 2013-14 marketing year that will start in October in most
countries, according to DZ Bank AG,  Germany ’s largest
cooperative lender. Production will be a record 172.3 million
tons in 2012-13 after three straight expansions, the  U.S.
Department of Agriculture  estimates. Raw sugar in  New York  will
rise 8.8 percent to average 20.5 cents in the fourth quarter,
the mean of nine bank estimates compiled by Bloomberg shows.  Farmers are cutting production after futures tumbled 39
percent in the past two years and dry weather in India, the
world’s second-biggest producer, encouraged growers to choose
crops that don’t need as much water. Global output this year
will climb less than 1 percent after rising more than 5 percent
a year in the past three years, USDA data show. Demand will rise
2.1 percent while stockpiles at the end of 2012-13 will be 38.3
million tons, the most in five years, the data show.  “You will have a normal increase in consumption because of
lower prices and in terms of production you will see a decline
in some countries because of big carryover stocks,” said
Fabienne Pointier, an analyst at Lausanne, Switzerland-based
researcher Kingsman SA, owned by McGraw-Hill Cos. “The 2013-14
season is moving toward a more balanced situation.”  Another Surplus  Sugar fell 16 percent last year on ICE Futures U.S., on
forecasts that global production would exceed demand by 6.2
million tons in 2012-13, a third consecutive surplus, based on a
November estimate by the  International Sugar Organization  in
London. Sugar was the third-biggest decliner in the Standard &
Poor’s GSCI gauge of 24 commodities last year. Prices are down
another 3.4 percent this year to 18.84 cents a pound.  The analyst estimates were collected before the Kingsman
Sugar Conference in Dubai starting Feb. 2. The annual event
attracts 600 people from 45 countries in the city that is home
to Al Khaleej Sugar Co., the world’s biggest sugar refinery.  Sugar production in India, the largest consumer, will fall
next season from 24.3 million tons in 2012-13, according to the
Indian Sugar Mills Association in  New Delhi . Drought in the
states of Maharashtra and Karnataka, which together account for
45 percent of output, will encourage farmers to cut plantings,
said ISMA’s president M. Srinivaasan. Production in Maharashtra
will drop to 4 million tons in 2013-14 from 6 million tons this
season, according to the Sugar Commissionerate of Maharashtra.  Mexican Farmers  Indian millers’ inability to pay farmers because of high
cane prices may mean plantings could also be down in the state
of  Uttar Pradesh , the nation’s largest sugar cane growing state,
according to  Jonathan Kingsman , founder of Kingsman, who has
traded sugar for more than 30 years.  U.S. farmers will probably reduce plantings in 2013-14 and
Mexican growers may not spend too much in husbandry, according
to Pointier of Kingsman. Inventories in the U.S. will gain to 2
million tons by August, the most since 2000, the USDA forecasts.
Mexico sends most of its sugar exports to the U.S. under the
 North American Free Trade Agreement , or NAFTA.  The global sugar surplus may shrink to 3.5 million tons in
2013-14 from 4.86 million tons a year earlier,  Kona Haque , a
London-based analyst at Macquarie Group Ltd. estimated in a
report on Jan. 18. Prices will fall to an average 17.5 cents a
pound in the second quarter on ICE, and rebound later this year
as ethanol output in Brazil takes some surplus away, she said.  Brazil Outlook  “The surpluses are a cumulative issue, so even if we have
a smaller surplus in 2013-14 than in 2012-13, it’s still a
fourth year of excess supplies,” said Tom McNeill, a director
at researcher Green Pool Commodity Specialists Pty in  Brisbane ,
 Australia . “Sugar still needs to drop to at least 16 cents to
17 cents for growers to get the message to slow production.”  In  Brazil , output in the 2013-14 season that starts in the
South American country in April, will total a record 39.9
million tons, Macquarie forecasts. In the center south region,
which accounts for about 90 percent of the country’s output,
production may reach 35 million to 37 million tons, said Toby Cohen, a London-based director at Czarnikow Group Ltd., which
traded sugar in more than 90 countries in 2011. That compares
with 34.1 million tons in 2012-13, industry group Unica says.  Brazilian millers may devote more cane to making ethanol at
the expense of sugar after the government said it will raise the
amount of the biofuel blended into gasoline to 25 percent from
the current 20 percent and fuel prices were increased.  Ethanol Mix  A 20 percent jump in Brazil’s ethanol demand would erase
the sugar surplus, Ben Pearcy, chief development officer and
managing director of sugar and bioenergy at  Bunge Ltd. (BG) , said on
Nov. 28 in an interview at a conference in London. Brazil’s
output may be smaller than forecast if sugar prices drop enough
to make ethanol more profitable, Czarnikow’s Cohen said.  Brazil will raise the amount of ethanol in gasoline in May,
Energy Minister Edison Lobao said yesterday.  Petroleo Brasileiro
SA (PETR4) , the state-controlled  oil company , increased gasoline prices
at refineries by 6.6 percent, it said in a statement on Jan. 29.  The European Union may also reduce sugar output, according
to Stefan Uhlenbrock, an analyst at Ratzeburg, Germany-based
F.O. Licht GmbH. Some growers in  Europe  may try to hold back
because of a surplus, while farmers in Russia and Ukraine are
set to lower planted areas, he said by phone on Jan. 25.  China Imports  Lower sugar prices may help spur demand.  China , last
season’s biggest buyer, imported about 740,000 tons in the first
three months of 2012-13, customs data show. Imports for the
whole season are estimated by the USDA at 2 million tons. In
another sign of demand, Indian refiners have contracted to
import about 919,000 tons of raw sugar since Oct. 1, ISMA said.  “Going into 2013-14, Brazil looks as though it will be the
exception as production elsewhere could be going into reverse,”
said Cohen of Czarnikow. “With consumption increasing and
rising affordability as sugar prices fall, that should all be
doing the job of bringing the market closer to a balance.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
