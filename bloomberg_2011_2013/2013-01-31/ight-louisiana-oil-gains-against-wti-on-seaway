Light Louisiana Sweet crude
strengthened against West  Texas  Intermediate after  Enterprise
Products Partners LP (EPD)  said that terminal constraints on the
Seaway pipeline will last until late 2013.  Seaway, which was reversed last summer to relieve a
historic oil glut in the center of the U.S. by moving the crude
to the  Gulf Coast , will have limitations at its terminus in
Texas until a new pipeline lateral is done, Enterprise said. The
discount for WTI oil at Cushing,  Oklahoma , the U.S. benchmark,
widened to the most in three weeks against Brent oil.  “This was about Seaway not being able to expand their
outbound capacity,” said  Andy Lipow , president of Lipow Oil
Associates LLC in Houston. “WTI clearly came under pressure.”  Light Louisiana Sweet’s premium to WTI widened 35 cents to
$18.20 a barrel as of 12:17 p.m. in  New York , according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Heavy Louisiana Sweet added 35 cents to
$18.10 a barrel over WTI.  Restrictions at Seaway’s Jones Creek terminal in Texas,
which was limited on Jan. 23 to 175,000 barrels a day, will be
alleviated when Enterprise finishes the new pipeline lateral to
its Echo terminal in Houston, Bill Ordemann, Enterprise’s vice
president for crude and natural gas, said on a conference call.  Oil supplies  at Cushing, the delivery point for New York-
traded futures, reached a record 51.9 million barrels on Jan.
11, according to the Energy Information Administration, the
Energy Department’s statistical arm. They were at 51.8 million
last week, the EIA reported yesterday.  U.S. crude production climbed 19 percent last year, driven
by advances in fracking and horizontal drilling.  Seaway Limits  “If the Seaway pipeline is limited with offtake via Jones
Creek, that is going to limit the ability to draw down inventory
at Cushing in the face of ever-increasing midcontinent oil
production,” Lipow said.  WTI’s discount to Brent widened more than $1 to $18.17 a
barrel at 2:02 p.m. New York time. When WTI weakens and Brent
strengthens, it typically boosts the value of U.S. grades that
compete with foreign oils priced using the European benchmark.  Poseidon oil’s premium to WTI widened 35 cents to $13.35.
Mars Blend’s strengthened 20 cents to $13.10 a barrel over WTI,
and Southern Green Canyon’s grew 25 cents to $13.  The premium for  Thunder Horse , a sour crude with lower
sulfur content than Mars, Poseidon and Southern Green Canyon,
widened 50 cents to $15.50 above WTI.  Western Canada Select’s discount to the U.S. benchmark
narrowed 25 cents to $31.75. Syncrude, a Canadian light
synthetic oil processed from  oil sands , strengthened 10 cents to
a premium of 85 cents a barrel.  West Texas Sour’s discount to WTI widened 25 cents to $4.75
a barrel. WTI in Midland was $2.75 less than WTI in Cushing,
weaker than yesterday’s $2.60 discount.  To contact the reporter on this story:
