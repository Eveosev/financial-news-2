mood in the market has been buoyed by generally good earnings,

drop in nine months, as the drugmaker said sales will fall by a
“mid- to high-single digit percentage” at constant exchange
rates in 2013 and profit will drop even more. Analysts had
forecast that sales would decline 3 percent. The company also
