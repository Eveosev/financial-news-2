New Jersey Governor  Chris Christie 
will make his first television appearance on  CBS Corp.’s (CBS)  “Late
Show,” where host  David Letterman  can crack wise in person
about his girth and bluster.  The 50-year-old Republican, who is running for a second
term, is a regular target of Letterman’s irreverent Top 10
lists. In September 2011, as Christie considered a run for U.S.
president, Letterman, 65, introduced a White House-themed
countdown by putting the governor’s weight at 400 pounds (181
kilograms).  “I want Chris Christie in this race,” Letterman said
before introducing his list. “I just want to be able to
meaningfully say, ’Hey! Bring it, fat boy!’”  Christie is scheduled for the Feb. 4 broadcast, according
to a network news release.  The governor, married with four children, has said he has
struggled with weight control since his teenage years, and has
told interviewers that jabs don’t bother him. He has made comic
turns on NBC’s “Saturday Night Live” and the network’s “Late
Night With Jimmy Fallon,” where he and the host performed a
cover of  Bruce Springsteen ’s “Thunder Road.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
