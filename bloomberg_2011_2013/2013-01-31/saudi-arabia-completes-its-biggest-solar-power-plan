Saudi Arabia completed its biggest
ground-mounted photovoltaic plant as the world’s largest crude
oil exporter seeks to generate a third of its electricity with
energy from the sun by 2032.  Germany’s  Phoenix Solar AG (PS4)  developed the 3.5-megawatt plant
in Riyadh that uses 12,684 panels from China’s  Suntech Power
Holdings Co. Ltd. (STP)  and inverters from  SMA Solar Technology AG (S92) ,
Phoenix Solar said in an e-mailed statement.  “This project represents an important milestone in the
development of the solar industry in the Kingdom of Saudi
Arabia,” Ron Shen, Suntech’s vice president of Asia Pacific,
Middle East and Africa, said in a separate statement.  Saudi Arabia plans to boost renewable energy use as a way
to pare back on oil consumption used for domestic desalinization
and power plants, potentially saving 523,000 barrels of oil
equivalent a day over the next 20 years. The country aims to
have 41,000 megawatts of solar capacity within two decades,
Maher al-Odan, a consultant at the King Abdullah City for Atomic
and Renewable Energy, said last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
