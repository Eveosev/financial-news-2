Fortinet Inc. (FTNT) , a maker of computer-
network security systems, rose the most since November 2009
after reporting fourth-quarter sales that topped analysts’
estimates, buoyed by large corporate contracts.  Fortinet shares  climbed  22 percent to $23.59 at the close
in New York. The stock has climbed 4.9 percent in 12 months,
compared with a 14 percent increase for the Russell 1000 Index.  The Sunnyvale, California-based company yesterday said
quarterly sales jumped 25 percent to $151.2 million, while
analysts on average had projected $144.3 million, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Software deals of more than $500,000
fueled the revenue gains, said Brian Freed, an analyst at
Wunderlich Securities Inc.  “Fortinet grew their large deals 80 percent year over
year,” said Freed, who rates the shares a hold, in an
interview. “I’m definitely more positive than I was
yesterday.”  Fourth-quarter profit, excluding some costs, was 17 cents a
share, the company said in a statement, compared with an average
analyst estimate of 15 cents. Sales in the first quarter will be
$138 million to $141 million, Fortinet said on a conference
call.  To contact the reporter on this story:
