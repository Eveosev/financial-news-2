Martin Coward, the co-founder of
Ikos Asset Management Ltd., apologized in open court to his ex-
wife and former business partner for leaking divorce papers
containing personal information to members of the media.  Coward will pay 50,000 pounds ($78,990) in damages, which
Elena Ambrosiadou will donate to charity, and write a letter to
the media clarifying the ban on publishing any material from the
documents, her lawyer said today.  “It gives my client no pleasure to have had to pursue
these proceedings but in the light of the serious threat of
intrusion into the private lives of both herself and her son she
felt that there was no alternative,” said  Isabel Martorell , a
lawyer at Carter-Ruck, reading the apology in a  London  court.  Ikos, which uses computer algorithms to spot profitable
trades in  futures markets , has been embroiled in court battles
and spying allegations worldwide. The former couple, who started
divorce proceedings in  Greece  in 2009, have filed more than 40
lawsuits against each other in at least four countries over the
last two years.  Coward admitted he leaked Greek divorce documents to a
journalist at the U.K.’s  Daily Telegraph , then provided another
107 people at 53 organizations with private information about
the estranged couple’s family life and son, according to the
apology filed at the  High Court  in London.  Coward’s spokesman didn’t immediately respond to calls for
comment.  An Ikos affiliate paid 4 million pounds to settle lawsuits
with two former employees in November over unpaid bonuses and
the return of an award payment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
