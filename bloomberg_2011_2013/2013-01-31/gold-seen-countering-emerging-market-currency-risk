Gold may be a cheaper tool to use as
a hedge against swings in emerging-market currencies, according
to a study by a group funded by mining companies.  The World Gold Council, based in  London , examined eight
periods of “crisis conditions,” and found returns from
portfolios that included gold in hedging were 2.4 percent better
than investments lacking measures to counter exchange-rate risk.
Gold topped currency hedges by 1 percent, the group said today
in a  statement .  Economic growth in  emerging markets , along with
“aggressive” monetary policies in developed countries, led to
increases in interest-rates disparities and higher exchange-rate
hedging costs, the council said.  “Gold has a positive correlation to emerging market
growth, and a negative correlation to the dollar and other
developed-market currencies,” Juan Carlos Artigas, the global
head of investment research at the council, said in the
statement. “Given these qualities, there is a strong argument
for complementing existing exchange-rate hedging strategies with
gold.”  Barrick Gold Corp., the world’s largest producer, Newmont
Mining Corp. and AngloGold Ashanti Ltd. are among council
members.  To contact the reporter on this story:
