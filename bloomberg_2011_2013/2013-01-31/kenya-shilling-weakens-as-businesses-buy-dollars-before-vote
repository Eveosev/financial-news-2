  Kenya ’s shilling weakened,
reversing gains made this week, as importers accumulated dollars
ahead of elections.  The currency of East Africa’s biggest economy depreciated
as much as 0.2% to 87.70 a dollar and traded lower at 87.65 a
dollar by 1:08 p.m., snapping yesterday gains, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The shilling has fallen 1.8 percent this
year, compared with a 5.5 percent weakening of the South African
rand and 7 percent drop by the Malawian Kwacha, the worst
performing African currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  “The Kenyan shilling outlook remained bearish as importers
stocked up on dollars ahead of national elections in March,”
analysts at Nairobi-based  NIC Bank Ltd. (NICB) , led by Bernard Matimu,
said in a note to clients today. “The shilling could weaken to
89 before the elections,” it said.  Kenya will hold its presidential vote on March 4, the first
since a disputed 2007 poll sparked two months of violence in
which more than 1,100 people died.  Tanzania’s shilling depreciated for the third day,
weakening 0.4 percent to 1,623.50 a dollar, the lowest since Dec
13, 2011, while the Ugandan shilling weakened 0.3 percent to
2,665 a dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
