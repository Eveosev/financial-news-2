Alps Electric Co. (6770) , a Japanese
electronics supplier for carmakers and  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  jumped the
most in more than 22 months after announcing it will cut 3,000
jobs worldwide to help stem losses.  Alps surged 9.7 percent, the most since March 2011, to
close at 533 yen in Tokyo trading after the announcement. The
 company  led gains on the  Nikkei 225 (NKY) , which rose 0.2 percent.  The company forecast a net loss of about 8.5 billion yen
($93 million) for the year ending March, compared with a
previous forecast for 1.3 billion profit, as sales to consumers
will remain sluggish, it said in a statement. Alps plans to
boost sales of car electronics and smartphone-related products.  “The job cuts are aimed at improving profitability,”
Satoshi Yamamoto, a company spokesman said by phone today. The
reductions will be conducted in the fiscal year ending March
2014, he said. While Alps, which has about 32,000 workers, will
focus on cutting part-time and contract workers, full-time staff
will also be affected, Yamamoto said.  Alps cut its full-year operating profit forecast by 32
percent to 8 billion yen while reducing the sales estimate by
0.6 percent to 541 billion yen.  Alps has gained 3.3 percent this month. Before today’s
share-price gain, the stock had lost 5.8 percent since the start
of the year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
