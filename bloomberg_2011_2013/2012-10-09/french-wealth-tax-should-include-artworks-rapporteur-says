France ’s wealth tax should include
artworks, Christian Eckert, the National Assembly’s rapporteur
on budget affairs, said in an interview in Les Echos.  Cultural assets have been excluded from France’s wealth tax
since its creation in 1982. The tax is owed by those with real
estate and investment assets worth more than 1.3 million euros
($1.7 million).  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
