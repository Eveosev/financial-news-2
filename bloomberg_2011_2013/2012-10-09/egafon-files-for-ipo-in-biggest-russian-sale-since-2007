OAO  MegaFon ,  Russia ’s second-largest
wireless carrier by customers, will push ahead with a share-sale
plan that could become the largest initial public offering by a
Russian company since VTB Bank’s in 2007.  Sweden’s  TeliaSonera AB (TLSN)  will sell a stake, and MegaFon will
also offer its own stock, which will start trading in  London  and
Moscow this quarter, the operator controlled by billionaire
 Alisher Usmanov  said today in a regulatory filing. While the
offer size will depend on investor demand, people familiar with
the matter said last week that MegaFon may raise $3 billion from
the sale of a 20 percent stake.  Russian companies are returning to stock offerings after
the central bank sold a $5.2 billion stake in  OAO Sberbank (SBER)  last
month. MegaFon’s IPO is a part of shareholder agreement reached
in April when billionaire Mikhail Fridman’s Altimo cashed out of
the operator and Usmanov boosted his ownership to a controlling
stake, resolving years of governance disputes with TeliaSonera.  “MegaFon is a much clearer investment case focused on the
Russian telecom-market growth,” said Konstantin Chernyshev,
head of research at Moscow-based UralSib Financial Corp. UralSib
values MegaFon’s equity at $13 billion, and including debt, at
$17.8 billion, or 4.8 times estimated 2012 earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.  MegaFon, based in Moscow, didn’t say how many shares it
plans to sell or at what price. TeliaSonera said it may divest a
stake of as much as 10.6 percent, keeping at least 25 percent
ownership.  Risk Premium  Morgan Stanley (MS)  and Russia’s  Sberbank CIB (SBER)  are managing the
sale with help from  Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) ,  Citigroup Inc. (C)  and
VTB Capital, MegaFon said. Their valuation for MegaFon’s equity
vary from $12.3 billion to $16.1 billion, implying a multiple
including debt of 5 to 5.7 times projected Ebitda for this year,
a person with knowledge of the matter said, asking not to be
identified because the details are private.  The sale’s arrangers will have a so-called over-allotment
option to sell an additional 15 percent of the total size of the
offer, according to a copy of the term sheet obtained by
Bloomberg News. MegaFon will trade under the ticker MFON.  OAO Mobile TeleSystems, Russia’s biggest wireless company,
is trading at 5 times 2012 earnings, while the multiple for
 VimpelCom Ltd. (VIP) , the third-largest operator by subscribers, is
4.5 times, according to UralSib. The Russian telecom operators
are trading at a 19 percent discount to developed markets peers
as investors demand a high risk premium to hold Russian assets,
Chernyshev said.  Telefonica Sale  Telefonica SA (TEF) , Spain’s largest phone company, is seeking to
sell shares of its German wireless unit at 6.5 to 7 times
estimated 2013 Ebitda at the higher end of a range, people
familiar with the matter have said. MegaFon’s operating income
before depreciation and amortization was 42 percent of sales in
the second quarter, compared with Telefonica Deutschland AG’s
Oibda margin of 26 percent.  Telefonica Deutschland’s IPO won’t compete with MegaFon as
the two companies have different investor bases, said Alexander Vassiouk, director at  Prosperity Capital  Management in Moscow.  At $3 billion, MegaFon’s IPO would be one of the biggest in
Russia in recent years.  OAO Rosneft (ROSN) , the country’s largest oil
producer, raised $10.4 billion in an IPO in 2006, followed a
year later by  VTB Bank (VTBR) ’s $8 billion stock sale.  United Co.
Rusal (486) , the biggest aluminum producer, raised $2.2 billion in a
Hong Kong listing in 2010.  Rising Sales  Initial share sales in Europe, the Middle East and Africa
have raised about $6 billion this year, compared with $37
billion in the same period last year, data compiled by Bloomberg
show.  MegaFon has 62 million subscribers, according to a company
presentation last month. It also owns units in Tajikistan,
Abkhazia and Ossetia. The company, led by Chief Executive
Officer Ivan Tavrin, reported first-half revenue of $4.2
billion, a 14 percent increase from a year earlier. MegaFon had
considered an IPO as early as a decade ago.  Mobile TeleSystems rose 0.5 percent to 224.44 rubles at
5:21 p.m. Moscow time, while OAO Rostelecom, Russia’s dominant
long-distance phone operator, added 2.5 percent to 137.19
rubles. VimpelCom  lost  1.4 percent yesterday in New York.  MegaFon may use the proceeds to reduce its 156 million
rubles ($5 billion) of debt or for investments such as network
improvements, Tavrin told reporters on a conference call today.
MegaFon doesn’t need the proceeds to fund acquisitions and
doesn’t plan any takeovers abroad, he said.  Dividend Play  The operator said it plans to hand out 50 percent of profit
or 70 percent of free cash flow as dividends, whichever is
higher. This means MegaFon will be a “strong dividend play,”
paying out some $600 million to $800 million a year through 2015
and implying a dividend yield of as much as 6 percent, according
to UralSib.  “It’s the price that matters,” Alexander Vassiouk, a
director at  Prosperity Capital  in Moscow which has $4 billion
under management, said yesterday by phone. “MegaFon will be
attractive if sold at the same price-to-earnings multiple as  OAO
Mobile TeleSystems (MBT) , while offering a comparable dividend
yield.”  Russia’s richest man Usmanov, the main owner of MegaFon, is
valued at $18 billion by Bloomberg Billionaire Index. He also
controls Russian iron-ore producer  Metalloinvest (METIN)  and Internet
company  Mail.ru Group (MAIL) , which owns  Facebook Inc. (FB)  shares among
other assets. He is also a shareholder of London soccer club
Arsenal.  Usmanov, 59, acquired Russian mobile-Internet provider
Scartel earlier this year. Scartel, which operates under the
 Yota  brand, agreed  in March  to develop fourth-generation network
jointly with MegaFon. The company will let MegaFon use its
equipment to provide so-called LTE communication services, in
turn getting access to MegaFon’s network.  To contact the reporter on this story:
