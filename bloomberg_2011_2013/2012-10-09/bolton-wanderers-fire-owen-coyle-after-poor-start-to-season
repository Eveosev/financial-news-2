Bolton Wanderers fired coach Owen Coyle following relegation from the Premier League and a poor
start in the second-tier Championship this season.  Coyle, a former player with the northwest England soccer
team, joined the Trotters from local rival Burnley in January
2010 as a replacement for Gary Megson.  Bolton ended an 11-year stay in the English top division
last season and is 18th in the 24-team Championship with 11
points from 10 games. Coyle, 46, described the 2-1 defeat at
Millwall in the team’s last game as the lowest point of his
coaching career.  “Owen poured his heart and soul into the job, both on and
off the pitch, and he led our club with great dignity during
some very challenging times,” Chairman Phil Gartside said in a
statement on the club’s website. “It is the right time for a
change. We set a target at the beginning of the season and want
to get back on track.”  The team will be temporarily coached by academy manager
Jimmy Phillips and head of academy coaching and development
Sammy Lee, Bolton said.  “I have always been driven to act in the best interests of
the club and care passionately about it,” Coyle said. “I had
fantastic times here as a player and it has been a privilege to
have held the post of manager.”  Coyle, born in  Scotland , played for Scottish teams
including Dumbarton, Airdrieonians and Motherwell, and
represented the Republic of Ireland on one occasion. In 2007 he
left his post as St. Johnstone coach to join Burnley, where he
won promotion to the Premier League in 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
