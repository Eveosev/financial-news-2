Oil Search Ltd. (OSH) , Papua New Guinea’s
biggest oil and gas producer, rose the most in more than two
months after signing an accord with  Total SA (FP)  to explore for
natural gas in the Gulf of Papua.  The stock climbed 3.2 percent to A$7.78 at the close in
Sydney, its biggest gain since July 19. The benchmark index
added 0.5 percent.  Oil Search, partner in a $15.7 billion liquefied natural
gas venture in Papua New Guinea led by Exxon Mobil Corp., is
looking to develop fields that may underpin a second LNG project
in the Pacific nation. The deal is the first foray by Total,
 Europe ’s third-largest oil company, into exploration and
production in  Papua New Guinea , Oil Search said in a statement
today.  The two companies will hold equal stakes in five licenses
in the gulf and form a partnership to look at other licenses in
the Pacific nation, excluding the Highlands region. An offshore
drilling program is expected to start in the first quarter of
2013, according to Oil Search’s statement.  Total would develop and operate the downstream plants
should drilling lead to the approval of an LNG project, Oil
Search said. The agreement depends on conditions including
approval from Papua New Guinea’s minister for petroleum and
energy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
