Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)  co-founder Bill
Gates, who stepped down in 2008 from a day-to-day job at the
world’s biggest software maker, said he has no plans to return
to the company in an active role.  “I am committed now full time to my foundation work,”
Gates, 56, said in Abu Dhabi today.  Gates served as chief executive officer of Microsoft until
2000, when he started the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, a
charitable organization that fights hunger, disease and poverty.
He maintained other management roles at Microsoft until 2008 and
remains the Redmond, Washington-based company’s chairman.  “I didn’t retire from Microsoft because I thought things
were getting boring,” Gates said. “I did decide that the
philanthropic world is where my contribution would be more
unique and so that’s what I will work on full time for the rest
of life.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
