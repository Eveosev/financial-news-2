The  Art Institute of Chicago , the
home of paintings by  Henri Matisse  and  Pablo Picasso , is selling
about $100 million of taxable and tax-exempt bonds partly to
shore up unfunded pension obligations.  The institute, founded in 1879, features 300,000 works in
its permanent collection. It plans to issue about $61 million of
tax-exempt debt as soon as this week through the  Illinois 
Finance Authority and $40 million of taxable bonds itself,
according to offering documents. The securities mature from 2013
to 2040. The sales will be led by Morgan Stanley.  The institute joins municipalities across the U.S. --
including  Chicago  and Illinois -- that are struggling to cope
with growing retiree benefit costs. Funding for state retirement
plans fell for a fourth straight year in 2011 to 71.7 percent,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg, as insufficient
contributions and inadequate investment gains overcame cuts
by more than 40 legislatures to benefits since 2007.  With  interest rates  in the $3.7 trillion muni market near
their lowest level since the 1960s, “the current low-yield
environment presents a very favorable opportunity for the
Institute to refinance its debt and to re-examine its  capital
structure ,” Erin Hogan, director of public affairs at the
museum, said in an e-mail. “We are hoping for strong demand for
the bonds.”  Illinois has borrowed $7.2 billion since 2010 for pension
benefits, according to Bloomberg data. The worst-funded state
retirement system has only 43.4 percent of assets needed to
cover promised obligations.  Pension Burden  Moody’s Investors Service said in an Oct. 5 report that
pension expenditures are expected “to continue to rise for the
majority of local governments, despite a variety of approaches
to trying to contain these costs.”  The Art Institute is rated A1 by Moody’s, its fifth-highest
grade, in part reflecting the museum’s pension and retirement
liabilities. The benefits totaled $64.5 million in the 2012
fiscal year, according to the Moody’s report.  Proceeds of the museum’s taxable bond sale will be used
“without limitation” to pay for “accelerating funding to the
Institute’s unfunded pension-benefit obligations,” Hogan said.
The  retirement plan  had enough assets to meet about 65 percent
of obligations to employees as of June 30, 2011, up from 53
percent the year before, Bloomberg data show.  The museum employed about 1,030 full- and 573 part-time
workers as of June 30 this year, according to offering
documents. None is represented by unions.  Demand Rising  As U.S. interest rates have neared  record lows , municipal-
bond investors have shown demand for lower-rated debt similar to
the Chicago museum’s securities this year. The difference
between taxable single-A rated obligations and top-grade munis
 narrowed  to 1.58 percentage points in April, the smallest since
2008. The current spread is 1.7 percentage points, Bloomberg
data show.  The museum completed its Modern Wing in 2009, with works
from Matisse, Picasso and  Salvador Dali . The section’s operating
expenses reduced the institute’s credit strength, according to
 Standard & Poor’s .  Still, it completed a $375 million campaign for the wing in
2011, and more than $322 million of cash pledges have been
collected, S&P said in a July report. The New York-based company
rates the museum A+, fifth-best.  The Illinois Finance Authority, a so-called conduit issuer,
last sold bonds on behalf of the museum two years ago, Bloomberg
data show. The debt maturing in 2040 was priced to yield 4.93
percent in May 2010.  Editors: William Glasgall, Mark Schoifet.  To contact the reporter on this story:
