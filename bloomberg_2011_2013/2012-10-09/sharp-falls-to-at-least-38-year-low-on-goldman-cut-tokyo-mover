Sharp Corp. (6753) , the Japanese electronics
maker on course to post a second straight full-year loss,
dropped to the lowest level in at least 38 years in Tokyo
trading after Goldman Sachs Group Inc. cut its rating to sell.  Sharp slumped 15 percent to 151 yen, the lowest since at
least 1974. The stock was the  biggest loser  on the benchmark
 Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average, which fell 1.1 percent. Japanese
markets were shut yesterday for a public holiday.  The maker of Aquos televisions may need to issue  new stock 
to raise funds, eroding  shareholder value , Goldman Sachs
analysts led by  Takashi Watanabe  wrote in a report on Oct. 6.
Goldman Sachs, which cut the stock’s  rating  from neutral, also
reduced Sharp’s 12-month price estimate by 31 percent to 120 yen
because of expectations that  earnings per share  will be diluted
by about 50 percent with the new stock.  “Even assuming continued financial support from its banks,
we are more convinced Sharp will need to issue fresh equity,”
Goldman Sachs wrote in the report. Sharp’s equity-to- asset  ratio
“could deteriorate further if more inventory valuation losses
or fixed-asset writedowns emerge,” the brokerage said.  Sharp isn’t in a position to comment on the views of
Goldman Sachs,  Miyuki Nakayama , a spokeswoman at the Japanese
company, said by telephone today.  The company will need to book 106 billion yen ($1.4
billion) of unrecognized pension reserves next fiscal year,
trimming the equity ratio to 4 percent at the end of March 2014,
Goldman Sachs said. That compares with about 24 percent in the
year ended March 31, the report showed.  The brokerage widened its estimate for Sharp’s net loss
this fiscal year to 474.5 billion yen from 374.5 billion yen to
include 100 billion yen in deferred tax-asset writedowns. Sharp
on Aug. 2 forecast a loss of 250 billion yen for the 12 months
ending March 31.  To contact the reporter on this story:
