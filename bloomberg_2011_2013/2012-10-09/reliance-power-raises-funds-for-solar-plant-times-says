Reliance Power Ltd. (RPWR)  raised $302
million for a 100-megawatt solar thermal power project in India,
the Economic Times said, citing executives it didn’t identify.  The foreign currency-denominated debt will be provided by
 Axis Bank Ltd. (AXSB) , Dutch development lender Nederlandse
Financierings-Maatschappij voor Ontwikkelingslanden NV, the U.S.
Export-Import Bank and the Asian Development Bank, it said.  The ADB said in April it would lend $103 million to the
project, expected to be completed in May at a cost of $415
million. The Ex-Im Bank in April also agreed to an $80.3 million
loan to purchase turbines from Areva SA’s U.S. unit.  Solar thermal technology uses sunlight to produce steam for
conventional turbines.  To contact the reporter on this story:
