Most Asian  stocks  dropped, led by
Japanese shares, as investors awaited a meeting of  Europe ’s
finance ministers to tackle the debt crisis.  Canon Inc. (7751) , a camera maker that gets about 31 percent of
its sales from Europe, fell 1.4 percent in Tokyo. HTC Corp.
tumbled 7 percent in Taipei after Asia’s No. 2 smartphone maker
posted a record decline in quarterly profit.  China ’s  Shanghai
Composite Index (SHCOMP)  rallied as mainland lenders rebounded from
yesterday’s losses.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  slipped 0.4 percent to 121.68
as of 7:40 p.m. in Tokyo, with five shares falling for every
four that rose. The regional benchmark index gained 4 percent
last month amid speculation China will follow central banks
worldwide in adding stimulus to boost growth. A regional index
that excludes Japan gained as much as 0.7 percent before paring
its advance in the afternoon.  “What is certain is that more and more central banks are
easing their monetary policy,” said David Gaud, a senior
portfolio manager at Edmond de Rothschild Asset Management in
Hong Kong, which oversees $18 billion. “Bonds have been an
asset class mostly held by global investors, so it makes sense
now to start to see some spill-over into the equity side because
equity as an asset class is very cheap on a relative basis.
There is a valuation case for Asia at this point.” The
International Monetary Fund cut its global growth outlook today
and warned of even slower expansion unless policy makers in the
U.S. and Europe address threats to their economies.  Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  fell 1.1 percent as
markets reopened following yesterday’s holiday. Taiwan’s  Taiex
Index  slipped 0.4 percent.  Singapore ’s Straits Times Index slid
0.4 percent. South Korea’s Kospi Index lost 0.1 percent. China’s
 Shanghai  Composite Index jumped 2 percent, while Hong Kong’s
Hang Seng Index rose 0.5 percent.  Business Confidence  Australia ’s S&P/ASX 200 Index gained 0.5 percent after a
survey showed business confidence recovered in September amid
prospects of interest-rate cuts. The Reserve Bank of Australia
trimmed its benchmark rate on Oct. 2.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index lost 0.1 percent
today. The gauge dropped 0.4 percent in New York yesterday ahead
of meeting of European leaders to discuss the region’s debt
crisis. Finance ministers from all the 27 countries in the
European Union will convene today in the lead up to a summit in
Brussels on Oct. 18-19.  German Chancellor Angela Merkel is scheduled to visit
Greece today as European finance ministers hailed the nation’s
efforts to cut its budget, raising chances that aid will keep
flowing to the recession-wracked country.  IMF Forecast  The world economy will expand 3.3 percent this year, the
slowest pace since the 2009 recession, and 3.6 percent next
year, the IMF said today. That compares with July predictions of
3.5 percent in 2012 and 3.9 percent for 2013.  Exporters dropped. Canon lost 1.4 percent to 2,425 yen in
 Tokyo . Sony Corp., Japan’s biggest exporter of consumer
electronics, sank 3.6 percent to 914 yen.  HTC sank 7 percent to NT$267 in Taipei. The smartphone
maker reported third-quarter net income dropped 79 percent from
a year earlier to NT$3.9 billion ($133 million). The results
missed the NT$4.43 billion average of eight analysts’ estimates
compiled by Bloomberg.  Sharp Corp., a Japanese electronics maker on course to post
a second straight full-year loss, slumped 15 percent to 151 yen
in Tokyo, the lowest close in at least 38 years. Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. cut its rating on the stock to sell from neutral,
saying the company’s financial situation may continue
deteriorate even if gets support from creditors.  Copper, Oil  The Asian benchmark equity gauge  traded  at 12.8 times
estimated earnings, compared with 13.9 times for the S&P 500 and
12.1 times for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.  Raw-material producers advanced after crude and copper
futures rebounded.  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , the world’s No. 1 mining
company and Australia’s largest oil producer, added 0.7 percent
to A$33.47 in Sydney.  PetroChina Co. (857) , China’s biggest energy
company, climbed 2.1 percent to HK$10.14 in Hong Kong.  Chinese banks were among the biggest contributors to gains
of the Shanghai Composite Index today. Industrial & Commercial
Bank of China Ltd., the world’s biggest lender by market value,
gained 1.3 percent to 3.80  yuan  in Shanghai.  China Construction
Bank Corp. (939) , the country’s second-largest lender, rose 2 percent
to 4.06 yuan.  To contact the reporters on this story:
