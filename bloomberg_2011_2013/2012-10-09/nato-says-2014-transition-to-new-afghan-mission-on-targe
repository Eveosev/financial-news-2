Plans to withdraw NATO military
forces from  Afghanistan  by the end of 2014 are on target and
defense ministers are drafting a new mission to provide support
and training for Afghan security personnel after they leave.  “We remain committed to launching a new mission to train,
advise and assist Afghan security forces after 2014,” North
Atlantic Treaty Organization Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen told journalists in Brussels today. “Tomorrow, I will
look to ministers to endorse the broad framework for that new
mission in Afghanistan.”  NATO’s 28 members convened today in Brussels to discuss
Afghanistan, the security situation in  Syria  and ways to
maintain European defense amid budgetary cutbacks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
