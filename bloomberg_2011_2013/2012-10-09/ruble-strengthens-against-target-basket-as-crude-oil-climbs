The ruble climbed against the central
bank’s target currency basket as crude oil,  Russia ’s chief
export earner, gained in London.  The ruble rose 0.3 percent as of 7 p.m. in Moscow to
35.2164 against the euro-dollar basket, which Bank Rossii uses
to smooth exchange rate fluctuations that can crimp exporters’
competitiveness. It weakened less than one kopek to 31.1649
against the dollar and advanced 0.6 percent versus the euro to
40.1682.  Brent crude  rose 1.3 percent to $113.23 a barrel by the
close of  currency trading  in Moscow. Oil and gas account for
about 50 percent of Russia’s government revenue. Non-deliverable
forwards showed the ruble at 31.6100 per dollar in three months
compared with 31.6135 yesterday.  The extra yield investors demand to own Russia’s dollar
bonds over U.S. Treasuries gained three basis points to 190,
according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s EMBI Global Index. An index
of five-year government bond yields rose one basis point to
7.429 percent.  Serbia’s central bank added the ruble to a list of 12
currencies that banks in the Balkan nation are allowed to trade
in the local market. Russia is  Serbia ’s second-biggest trading
partner after Germany, accounting for 7.4 percent of the Balkan
country’s exports and 10.7 percent of its imports.  To contact the reporter on this story:
