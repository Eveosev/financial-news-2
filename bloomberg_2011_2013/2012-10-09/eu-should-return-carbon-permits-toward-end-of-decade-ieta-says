The European Union should return
withheld carbon allowances near the end of the decade to make
its plan to resuscitate prices more effective, according to the
International Emissions Trading Association.  The bloc is seeking to curb supply starting next year to
ease a supply glut. Returning all allowances in a single year
would risk a “price crash,” the Geneva lobby group said today
in an e-mailed statement.  The EU should remove a higher portion of allowances in 2013
rather than in subsequent years, IETA said. That year “is for
several reasons better supplied than subsequent years and this
would also send a stronger signal of political determination,”
the lobby said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
