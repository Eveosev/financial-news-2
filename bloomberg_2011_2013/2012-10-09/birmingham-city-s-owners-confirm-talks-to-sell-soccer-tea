Birmingham City’s Hong Kong-based
owners said they’re in talks with two possible buyers of the
English soccer team.  The club was relegated from the elite Premier League in
2011, a month before its largest shareholder,  Carson Yeung , was
arrested in  Hong Kong  on money laundering charges.  Parent company  Birmingham International Holdings Ltd. (2309)  said
in a statement to the Hong Kong stock exchange yesterday that
talks with the unidentified parties, who signed confidentiality
agreements and received due diligence materials, are at an early
stage. Shares in the company were suspended in June 2011.  “To the best of the board’s knowledge, information and
belief, having made all reasonable enquiries, the prospective
buyers and their ultimate beneficial owners are third parties
independent of the company and its connected persons,” the
company said.  Birmingham -- previously controlled by David and Ralph Gold,
and  David Sullivan  -- was bought by Yeung in October 2009 in an
81.5 million-pound ($131 million) deal.  Yeung, a former hairdresser, will go on trial in November
after being charged in June 2011 with five counts of dealing
with property “known or believed to represent proceeds of an
indictable offense” with a total value of HK$721.3 million ($93
million), according to documents read in a Hong Kong court.
Yeung, 51, denies the charges.  Soccer authorities imposed a transfer embargo on the team
after it failed to submit accounts for 2011.  International Investments  At a 2007 press conference, Yeung said he had investments
in energy, hotels and property. An October 2009 statement by
Birmingham City Football Club said Yeung has “accumulated many
years of experience in international investment” and was
chairman of Hong Kong Rangers Football Club from 2005 to 2006.  Birmingham was relegated three months after winning the
League Cup, its first major trophy in 48 years. The team is 21st
in the second tier Championship after 10 games, one place above
the relegation zone.  The case is Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and
Yeung Ka-sing Carson, ESCC2717/2011 in the Hong Kong Eastern
Magistrates’ Court.  To contact the reporters on this story:
