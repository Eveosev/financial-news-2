Baidu Inc. (BIDU)  fell the most since August
in New York after  Credit Suisse Group AG (CS)  became the third
investment bank this month to cut its recommendation on the
owner of  China ’s most popular search engine.  American depositary receipts of Beijing-based Baidu dropped
6.2 percent to $107.16 at 11:15 a.m., the biggest slump since
Aug. 29.  Baidu was  cut  to underperform from neutral at Credit Suisse
a week after  Jefferies Group Inc. (JEF)  lowered its recommendation on
the shares to hold from buy, and  Raymond James Financial Inc. (RJF) 
reduced its rating to outperform from strong buy.  Qihoo 360 Technology Co.’s (QIHU)  entrance in China’s Internet
search market will cut into Baidu’s sales and profit, the three
banks said.  Baidu’s domination of the Internet search market is
“waning,” Wallace Cheung, an analyst at Credit Suisse in Hong
Kong, wrote in an e-mailed report today. A slowing Chinese
advertising market will also put pressure on the company’s
profit, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
