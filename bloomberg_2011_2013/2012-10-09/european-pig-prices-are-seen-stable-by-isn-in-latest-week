European Union pig prices were mostly
stable, while falling in  France  on increased supply,  Germany 
industry group Interessengemeinschaft der Schweinehalter
Deutschlands e.V. reported.  German pig prices were unchanged from last week at 1.876
euros ($2.43) a kilogram (2.2 pounds), Damme, Germany-based ISN
wrote in a weekly  report  on its website today. That compares
with 1.476 euros a kilogram a year ago.  EU pig-meat production is expected to fall 0.4 percent this
year and 3.2 percent in 2013 on a combination of higher feed
costs and new animal-welfare rules, the bloc wrote in a short-
term forecast last week. Germany is the EU’s biggest pork
producer, followed by  Spain  and France, Eurostat data show.  “In the ongoing week the European slaughter pig market
moves sideways,” ISN wrote. “Only France sees a discernible
price decline.”  Weekly pig-meat  prices  in France dropped to 1.889 euros a
kilogram from 1.937 euros a week ago, the group said. Pig costs
were stable in Spain at 1.961 euros, in the Netherlands at 1.81
euros and in  Denmark  at 1.826 euros, ISN reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
