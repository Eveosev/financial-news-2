Genesis Energy LP (GEL)  said Quintana
Capital Group LP, a Houston-based private-equity firm, sold
“substantially all” of its stake in the pipeline company after
holding it for two years.  The Quintana sale is part of a purchase by the Davison
family of  Louisiana , which raised its stake in Houston-based
Genesis to about 17 percent of Class A units and 77 percent of
Class B units, according to a statement today.  The Davison group, which included five board members,
appointed Genesis Chief Executive Officer Grant Sims chairman
and Kenneth Jastrow lead independent director. Four directors
appointed by Quintana stepped down.  Genesis, which agreed in 2007 to buy energy assets from the
Davison family, is a master-limited partnership that owns
pipelines, storage terminals and trucking operations.  Quintana, which has former Commerce Secretary Donald L. Evans as a principal, bought its stake in Genesis from  Denbury
Resources Inc. (DNR)  in 2010.  Genesis  fell  0.7 percent to $33.57 at the close in New
York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
