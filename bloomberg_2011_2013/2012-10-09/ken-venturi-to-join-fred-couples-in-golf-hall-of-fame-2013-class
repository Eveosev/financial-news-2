Ken Venturi, who won the 1964 U.S.
Open and later spent 35 years as a television golf analyst, was
selected to join Fred Couples in the World Golf Hall of Fame’s
2013 induction class.  Venturi, 81, was chosen in the lifetime achievement
category and will be enshrined with Couples on May 6 in St.
Augustine,  Florida . Couples, whose 1992 Masters Tournament
victory was one of his 15 career U.S. titles, was selected last
month for induction into the Hall of Fame.  Venturi won 14 times on the U.S. PGA Tour and is best
remembered for his U.S. Open victory at Congressional Country
Club outside  Washington , where he almost collapsed while playing
36 holes on the final day in heat that topped 100 degrees
Fahrenheit (38 Celsius).  “The last time I had tears in my eyes was when I won the
U.S. Open,” Venturi said on a conference call yesterday. “This
has been a special day and I’m deeply honored.”  Venturi in 1956 almost became the only amateur to win the
Masters, leading for the first three rounds before shooting a
final-round 80 to blow a four-shot lead and finish second, one
shot behind Jack Burke Jr. Venturi also was the runner-up to
Arnold Palmer at the 1960 Masters.  Venturi went into broadcasting after his playing career was
cut short by wrist injuries that affected the use of his hands.
He spent 35 years as the lead golf analyst for CBS Sports before
retiring in 2002.  “Jack Whitaker summed up my life pretty good when he said,
‘Fate has a way of bending the twig and fashioning a man to his
better instincts,’” Venturi said. “The one I think about is, I
wonder what I could have done if I hadn’t lost the use of my
hands.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
