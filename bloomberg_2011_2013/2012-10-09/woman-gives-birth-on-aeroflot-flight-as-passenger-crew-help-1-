OAO Aeroflot,  Russia ’s largest
airline, diverted a Moscow-bound flight from the Ukrainian city
of Simferopol to Kharkiv after a passenger gave birth to a girl
in mid-flight, the company said.  The crew safely delivered the baby yesterday with the help
of a nurse who was among the passengers, the Moscow-based
carrier said today in an e-mailed statement. The birth was the
first on an Aeroflot route since a boy was born in September
2005 on a Moscow-Los Angeles flight.  The woman was 29 to 30 weeks pregnant, meaning she wasn’t
in violation of air travel regulations, the Kharkiv airport said
in a  statement  on its website.  “The young mother and newborn were conscious when the
plane landed and were taken to a local perinatal center,” the
airport’s press service said in the statement. The mother and
the girl, who weighed 1.05 kilograms (2.3 pounds), are in
satisfactory condition, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
