Coffee futures fell to a four-week
low in  New York  on speculation that rain in Brazil, the world’s
largest producer and exporter, will improve harvest prospects.
 Orange juice  also slid, while cotton gained.  Showers may drop as much as 0.75 inch (1.9 centimeter) of
rain on coffee-growing areas of Brazil by Oct. 13, Telvent DTN
said today in a report. The price on Oct. 3 reached the highest
since July 24 on concern that dry weather would hurt flowers on
coffee trees, reducing the size of next year’s harvest.  “The favorable weather is helping the crop,” John Caruso,
a senior broker at R.J. O’Brien in  Chicago , said in an telephone
interview.  Arabica coffee for December delivery dropped 2.2 percent to
settle at $1.653 a pound at 2 p.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in New
York, after reaching $1.641, the lowest for a most-active
contract since Sept. 10.  Brazil ’s exports fell 24 percent in September from a year
earlier, partly because a strike by port officials delayed
shipments, the council of coffee exporters said yesterday.
Stockpiles at warehouses monitored by ICE rose  “After the nice run we had last week, producers are now
selling the market,” Caruso said. “Traders expect the exports
to pick-up steam.”  Orange-juice futures for November delivery slid 0.7 percent
to $1.12 a pound in New York, the fifth consecutive decline.  Cotton futures for December delivery increased 0.1 percent
to 71.84 cents a pound on ICE, adding to yesterday’s 0.4 percent
gain.  To contact the reporter on this story:
