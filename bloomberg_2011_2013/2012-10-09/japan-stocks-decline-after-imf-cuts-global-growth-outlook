     Oct. 9 (Bloomberg) --　Japanese  shares  fell after the market
opened after a public holiday, with the  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average
dropping the most in almost two weeks, after the  International
Monetary Fund  cut its global growth outlook.  Komatsu Ltd. (6301) , a construction-machinery maker that gets 80
percent of its sales overseas, dropped 3.4 percent.  Honda Motor
Co. (7267)  paced losses among automakers on a report it plans to cut
Chinese production along with Toyota Motor Corp. and Nissan
Motor Co.  Sharp Corp. (6753)  fell to the lowest since 1974 after its
equity rating was cut by Goldman Sachs Group Inc. CellSeed Inc.,
which develops regenerative medicine, added 4.4 percent after a
Japanese professor won the  Nobel Prize  for stem-cell research.  The Nikkei 225 dropped 1.1 percent to 8,769.59 as of the
trading close in  Tokyo , the biggest decline since Sept. 26. The
broader Topix Index retreated 1.3 percent to 727.68, with 29 of
the gauge’s 33 industry groups falling. Shares also fell after a
report showed growth of Japan’s current account surplus slowed
in August.  “At the start of this year, hope was that Japan would be
the best among developed nations, but pessimism began to take
over toward summer,” said Koji Toda, chief  fund manager  at
Resona Bank Ltd. in Tokyo, which oversees about 15 trillion yen
($191 billion). “Japanese stocks can’t keep up with gains in
U.S. and European equities on policy expectations. Plus, demand
concern in  China  is dealing the latest blow.”  Topix Valuations  The Topix has risen 1.2 percent this year through last week
as a wave of stimulus measures was introduced in  Asia , the U.S.
and  Europe  to fight the global slowdown in growth. Shares on the
gauge trade at about 0.88 times book value, compared with 2.25
for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and 1.51 times for the Stoxx
Europe 600 Index. A number lower than one means a company can be
bought for less than the value of its assets.  The IMF said today the world economy will expand 3.3
percent this year, the slowest pace since the 2009 recession,
and 3.6 percent next year. That compares with July projections
of 3.5 percent growth in 2012 and 3.9 percent for 2013. The
Washington-based global lender now sees “alarmingly high”
risks of a steeper slowdown. The IMF’s 188 member countries are
meeting in Tokyo this week.  “Asia is of course a world major trader and major exporter,
and it’s suffering from not only a slowdown in China, but also
across all of Europe,” said Matthew Sherwood, Sydney-based head
of markets research for Perpetual Investments, which oversees
about $25 billion. “We are looking at balance-sheet risks in
each individual company because we are in a capital-constrained
world. Therefore, companies that can fund their own balance
sheets are in a very strong relative position.”  Komatsu, Panasonic  Exporters fell, with Komatsu dropping 3.4 percent to 1,494
yen.  Panasonic Corp. (6752) , an electronics company that generates
about 47 percent of its sales outside Japan, slid 3.5 percent to
496 yen.  Companies on the Nikkei 225 for which geographic revenue
data are available get 31 percent of their sales outside Japan,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Carmakers fell after the Nikkei newspaper reported Japan’s
three largest automakers plan to halve production in China as a
territorial dispute continues to damp demand for Japanese goods.  Honda lost 2.5 percent to 2,361 yen. Toyota slid 1.5
percent to 3,000 yen, while Nissan declined 1.9 percent to 656
yen.  Sharp slumped 15 percent to 151 yen, the lowest in at least
38 years. The company’s rating was cut to sell/neutral and its
target price lowered to 120 yen by Goldman Sachs, which said the
electronics maker may have to issue new stock to raise funds.  Futures on the  S&P 500 (SPXL1)  added 0.2 percent today after the
index dropped 0.4 percent in New York yesterday, with Apple Inc.
pacing declines among technology stocks.  Among stocks that rose, CellSeed jumped 4.4 percent to 788
yen after  stem cells  derived from a mouse’s skin won a Nobel
Prize for Kyoto University professor Shinya Yamanaka, 50. Japan
Tissue Engineering Co., a biotechnology company, jumped 7.2
percent to 70,200 yen.  To contact the reporter on this story:
