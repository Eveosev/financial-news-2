The European Union should introduce
“ambitious” targets for cuts in  carbon emissions  for 2030,
according to  Fortum Oyj. (FUM1V)   Investment into energy production needs a “predictable
policy and long-term objectives,” Anne Brunila, executive vice
president of corporate relations and strategy at  Finland ’s
largest utility, said at a seminar in Helsinki. “Unfortunately,
the reality is different.”  The EU doesn’t have a legally binding reduction target for
after 2020. European leaders have called for a cut of 80 percent
from 1990 levels by 2030. Political risk and unpredictable
regulation hamper investment by EU power utilities, while
national objectives and a general lack of coordination undermine
the EU Commission’s target for an internal energy market,
Brunila said.  “Nearly all new power capacity being built is based on
public subsidy,” she said. “By 2020, less than 2 percent of
new production assets may be financed on market terms, and the
rest funded by governments.”  Carbon prices in the world’s largest cap-and-trade program
fell to a record 5.99 euros ($7.77) a metric ton in April after
the financial crisis hurt industrial production and cut demand
from industry for emission permits. That boosted the glut of
allowances to almost a half of the average annual pollution
limit in the system. Permits for December traded at 7.91 euros
at 12:55 p.m. on the ICE Futures Europe Exchange in  London .  50 Percent  “If the EU is to meet its goal of cutting emissions by 80
percent by 2050 from 1990 levels, a sufficiently robust interim
target is needed for 2030, to prop up CO2 prices and trigger
investments,” Brunila said in a separate interview. “Whether
the target should be 40 or 50 percent, or something else, I
cannot say.”  In March,  Germany ’s biggest utility EON AG said the bloc
should adopt a target to cut greenhouse-gas emissions by 50
percent by 2030 to rescue the region’s carbon market.  The bloc needs to “backload,” or postpone the auctioning
of carbon permits, and introduce a “structural fix” with a
permanent set-aside of allowances to tackle the glut, Brunila
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
