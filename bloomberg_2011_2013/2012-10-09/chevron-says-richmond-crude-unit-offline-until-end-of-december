Chevron Corp. (CVX)  said a fire-damaged
crude-processing unit a California refinery won’t resume
production before the end of the year as retail gasoline prices
surged to a record in the state.  The crude unit was knocked out of service during an August
blaze at the refinery near  San Francisco . Chevron, based in San
Ramon, California, announced the extent of the closure in a
statement today.  The Richmond disruption was the first in a chain of events
that crippled Californian fuel markets and led to gasoline
shortages that have forced some filling stations to shut and
others to raise prices close to $5 a gallon. Governor  Jerry
Brown  this week ordered regulators to ease pollution rules to
speed delivery of fuel supplies.  Regular gasoline at the pump climbed to an all-time peak of
$4.671 a gallon, according to data published today by AAA, the
nation’s largest motoring organization. That’s up from the
previous record of $4.668 reported at the same time yesterday.
Prices jumped 50 cents last week as refineries reduced output
and Chevron shut a crude pipeline because of contamination.  To contact the reporters on this story:
