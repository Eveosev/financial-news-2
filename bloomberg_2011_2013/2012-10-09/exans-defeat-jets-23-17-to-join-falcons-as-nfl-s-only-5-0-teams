Arian Foster  rushed for 152 yards and
a touchdown as the Houston Texans beat the New York Jets 23-17
to join the Atlanta Falcons as the only 5-0 teams in the
National Football League.  Matt Schaub  also threw a touchdown pass and Shayne Graham
kicked three field goals for the Texans last night at MetLife
Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey. It was the final game of
Week 5 of the regular season.  “That’s a good running back, a talented football team and
they made some plays,” Jets coach  Rex Ryan  said.  Houston beat the Jets for the first time in six meetings
and has now outscored its opponents 149-73 this year.  The Jets lost their second straight home game to fall to
2-3 and next host the  Indianapolis Colts  on Oct. 14. The Texans
return home to host the Green Bay Packers in Week 6.  Houston took a 17-7 halftime lead as Schaub opened the
scoring with a 34-yard touchdown pass to Owen Daniels in the
first quarter, Foster scored on a 13-yard run in the second
quarter and Graham added a 27-yard field goal.  Graham had two more field goals in the third quarter while
Joe McKnight scored on a 100-yard kickoff return for New York.  Nick Folk  pulled the Jets within 23-17 in the fourth
quarter with a 21-yard field goal. Houston’s defense then
stiffened, ending New York’s next two possessions with a sack
and an interception to hold on for the win.  Jets quarterback  Mark Sanchez  passed for 230 yards, with
one touchdown and two interceptions. New York finished with 69
rushing yards to 169 for the Texans.  “We got good production out of the run game, more than we
have all year,” Foster said. “It’s a good feeling.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
