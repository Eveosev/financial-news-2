Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s government
is preparing an energy-savings initiative to counter rising
electricity prices in Germany and reduce power consumption 10
percent by the end of this decade.  Germany wants to “at least double” the number of low-
income households that receive free  energy efficiency  consulting
starting next year, Environment Minister Peter Altmaier told
reporters today in Berlin. The consulting, which may be coupled
with incentives to invest in more efficient household
appliances, should be extended to every household by 2020, from
about 10 percent now, he said.  The plan is to help consumers “cheat rising power prices
and make the German energy switch a success,” Altmaier said
after meeting with energy executives and consumer groups.  Altmaier’s program, which will be fleshed out with greater
detail next month, comes as German consumers have been warned
that the fee they pay to subsidize renewable-energy sources is
expected to climb 50 percent next year.  Germany ,  Europe ’s
biggest power market that plans to exit nuclear energy
generation by 2022, seeks to add more solar and wind generators
in the coming years while maintaining a secure and affordable
supply.  Merkel’s government is debating how to reform its clean-
energy subsidy system, which has helped raise the share of
renewable sources to 25 percent of the electricity mix, to keep
costs in check. Altmaier will present his plan on Oct. 11.  To contact the reporter on this story:
