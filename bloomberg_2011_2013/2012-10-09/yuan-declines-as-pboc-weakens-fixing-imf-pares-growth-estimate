The yuan closed little changed as a
weaker daily  reference rate  and the International Monetary
Fund’s downgrade of its growth estimate was tempered by
speculation  China  will enact more stimulus measures.  The People’s Bank of China lowered the fixing by 0.02
percent to 6.3441 per dollar, which was 0.9 percent weaker than
yesterday’s closing spot price. The IMF cut its estimate for
2012 growth by 0.2 percentage point to 7.8 percent. The Chinese
Communist Party is holding its congress starting Nov. 8, which
will also include a once-a-decade power handover, while U.S.
presidential elections are due next month.  “The PBOC doesn’t favor any fast gains in the yuan given
the fixings are so much weaker than the spot,” said Patrick Cheng, a currency analyst at Haitong International Securities Co.
in Hong Kong. “Slower global growth is still taking a toll on
Chinese exports. However, the  yuan  may keep edging to new highs
occasionally as the congress and U.S. elections are
approaching.”  The yuan closed at 6.2878 per dollar in  Shanghai , from
yesterday’s 6.2872, according to the China Foreign Exchange
Trade System. The currency touched 6.2812 yesterday, the
strongest level since China unified official and market exchange
rates at the end of 1993. Yesterday’s high exceeded the central
bank’s reference rate by a record 0.98 percent, near to the
maximum 1 percent divergence that is permitted.  Yuan Outlook  The most-accurate forecasters for the yuan predict the
currency will weaken this quarter as China prevents gains that
may hurt exports. The yuan will slip 0.2 percent to 6.3 per
dollar in the three months through December, according to Credit
Agricole CIB and BNP Paribas SA, which had the best estimates
for the last six quarters as measured by Bloomberg Rankings.  In  Hong Kong ’s offshore market, the yuan was little changed
at 6.2920. It touched 6.2881 earlier, the strongest level since
Feb. 9. Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards fell 0.02 percent
to 6.3930, a 1.6 percent discount to the onshore spot rate. One-
month implied volatility, a measure of exchange-rate swings used
to price options, was little changed at 1.2 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
