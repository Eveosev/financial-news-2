The past week has been Big Bird's big moment. And our feathery yellow friend and his Sesame Street pals want none of it. It started last Wednesday during the first presidential debate, when Republican presidential nominee  Mitt Romney  said he would stop the subsidy to the Public Broadcasting Service. "I love Big Bird," he said. "But I’m not going to keep on spending money on things to borrow money from  China  to pay for it." In response, Big Birds started popping up everywhere from Twitter feeds to campaign events.  President  Barack Obama 's re-election campaign released an  ad  this morning mocking Romney's avian attack. "Big. Yellow. A menace to our economy," the narrator states. "Mitt Romney knows it's not Wall Street you have to worry about, it's Sesame Street." Hours after the ad went online, Sesame Street Workshop, the nonprofit organization behind the show,  responded  on its website: "We do not endorse candidates or participate in political campaigns. We have approved no campaign ads, and as is our general practice, have requested that the ad be taken down." The group might want to reiterate that message to the Republican National Committee, which posted a  graphic of the Count  from Sesame Street adding up Obama's references to characters from the show. It seems when politicians ask, "Can you tell me how to get to Sesame Street?" the Muppet answer is "Take a hike!" (Kirsten Salyer is the social media editor for Bloomberg View.
