Li & Fung Ltd. (494) , the world’s largest
supplier of clothes and toys to retailers, appointed former
 Citigroup Inc. (C)  banker Ed Lam as chief financial officer to help
implement its acquisition strategy.  Lam previously headed the Hong Kong corporate and
investment banking unit of Citigroup, Li & Fung said in an e-
mailed statement yesterday. As a banker, he worked with Li &
Fung said on acquisitions and loans, equity and bond sales, and
trade finance, the company said.  “The new appointment seems like good news on the surface,
but it doesn’t offer an immediate remedy to the company,”
Steven Leung, a director of institutional sales at UOB Kay Hian
Ltd., said by telephone from Hong Kong, “The bigger issue
remains whether the company can weather weak retail sentiment in
the U.S.”  Li & Fung posted a 22 percent decline in core operating
profit in the first half as U.S. consumers curbed spending amid
a slowing economy. The Hong Kong-based company has relied on
acquisitions to boost growth, spending about $3 billion on deals
from 2006 to 2011, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Lam has “a proven track record in M&A and leading
financial strategy which will complement our existing management
team,” Spencer Fung, the company’s chief operating officer,
said in the statement.  Li & Fung dropped 0.3 percent to HK$11.94 as of 10:17 a.m
in Hong Kong trading. The city’s benchmark Hang Seng Index fell
0.4 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
