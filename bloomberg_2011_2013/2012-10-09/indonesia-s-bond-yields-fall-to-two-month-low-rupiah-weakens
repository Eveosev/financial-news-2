Indonesia ’s bonds advanced, pushing
the two-year yield to the lowest level since August, as foreign
holdings reached the highest in a year. The rupiah dropped to a
one-week low.  Global funds purchased  2.36 trillion rupiah  ($246 million)
of local debt last week, taking total ownership to 244.3
trillion rupiah on Oct. 4, the highest level since September
2011, Finance Ministry data show. The  International Monetary
Fund  said today the world economy will grow 3.3 percent this
year, the slowest pace since 2009, compared with the 3.5 percent
it predicted in July. Indonesia’s growth accelerated to 6.37
percent in the second quarter from 6.3 percent in the preceding
three months, official data show.  “The market is still in a wait-and-see mode, with some
investors seeking higher yields such as those offered by
Indonesian bonds,” said Billie Fuliangsahar, the head of
treasury at PT Rabobank International Indonesia in Jakarta.
“The lower growth forecast from the IMF has little impact as
the local economy remains strong.”  The yield on the government’s 11 percent notes due October
2014 dropped one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 5.28
percent as of 3:29 p.m. in Jakarta, the lowest level since Aug.
13, prices from the Inter Dealer Market Association show.  The rupiah declined 0.2 percent to 9,609 per dollar, the
lowest level since Sept. 27, prices from local banks compiled by
Bloomberg show. One-month implied volatility, which measures
exchange-rate swings used to price options, held at 6 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
