Banco do Brasil SA , Latin America’s
largest lender by assets, said a capital injection from the
government will boost its Basel II capital ratio by about 50
basis points.  Brazil  gave the federally controlled bank 8.1 billion reais
($4 billion) last month. About 3.2 billion reais of the total
counts toward Tier I and Tier II capital ratios as of September,
the Brasilia-based company said today in a regulatory filing.
The rest can be applied once the company shows it cashed in
bonds it received from the government, according to the filing.  The capital injection was part of Brazil President Dilma Rousseff’s effort to get state-controlled banks to reduce fees
and interest rates they charge customers to revive growth in
Latin America’s biggest economy. Banco do Brasil’s shares  fell 
to a two-month low yesterday after the company cut fees on 24
services.  The bank said its Basel ratio will increase about 50 basis
points, or 0.50 percentage point, according to the filing. The
bank reported the ratio was at 14.6 percent at the end of the
second quarter, which includes $750 million it raised after
selling subordinated bonds due in January 2023.  Banco do Brasil fell 0.1 percent to 22.77 reais in Sao
Paulo trading, compared with a 0.6 percent decline for the
Bovespa benchmark index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
