The pound advanced against the euro,
ending the longest run of declines in almost three years, as
German  Chancellor Angela Merkel  maintained pressure on Greece to
meet austerity pledges.  Sterling dropped to the lowest level in four weeks versus
the dollar after the  International Monetary Fund  cut its
economic outlook for the U.K. and as data showed manufacturing
shrank more than economists forecast in August. Ten-year gilts
slipped as the Debt Management Office sold 1.75 billion pounds
($2.8 billion) of bonds due in June 2032. The U.K. economy grew
at its fastest pace in five years in the third quarter, the
National Institute of Economic and Social Research said today.  “Greece and its creditors have yet to reach a
compromise,” said  Neil Jones , head of European hedge-fund sales
at Mizuho Corporate Bank Ltd. in  London . “This has caused
investors to lose confidence and sell the euro against the
dollar, meaning it has also fallen against the pound.”  The U.K. currency strengthened 0.5 percent to 80.55 pence
per euro at 5:05 p.m. London time. It had weakened for seven
days, the longest streak since the period ending Nov. 26, 2009.
Sterling fell 0.2 percent to $1.5988 after touching $1.5977, the
lowest level since Sept. 10.  “I want  Greece  to remain in the euro,” Merkel told
reporters during a break in talks with Greek Prime Minister
Antonis Samaras during her first visit to  Athens  since the debt
crisis began in 2009. “A lot has been done, much remains to be
done.”  IMF Outlook  At stake is Greece’s membership in the 17-nation euro and
the payment of 31 billion euros ($40 billion) from bailout
commitments first made in 2010. In Luxembourg, where finance
ministers from all 27 European Union nations were gathering, the
bloc’s economy chief Olli Rehn said policy makers intended to
clear the funds’ release in the coming weeks.  The pound also rose against the euro as European Central
Bank President  Mario Draghi  said the region faces risks from
financial instability  Draghi told the European Parliament in Brussels today that
there is no alternative to austerity as euro-area officials are
pushing debt-strapped nations across southern  Europe  for more
cuts, despite the risk they will deepen economic recessions
gripping the region.  British Prime Minister  David Cameron  announced today he is
prepared to look at holding a referendum on Britain’s
relationship with the European Union.  The U.K. economy will contract 0.4 percent this year before
expanding 1.1 percent in 2013, the IMF said in its World
Economic Outlook today. It previously projected growth of 0.2
percent and 1.4 percent in those years.  IMF Forecast  The 17-country euro area  economy  will shrink 0.4 percent
this year and grow 0.2 percent in 2013, less than the 0.7
percent predicted three months ago, the Washington-based lender
said.  U.K. gross domestic product rose 0.8 percent, compared with
0.1 percent in the quarter through August, Niesr, whose clients
include the  Bank of England , said in an e-mailed statement in
London today. That’s the fastest expansion for a calendar
quarter since the third quarter of 2007.  U.K.  factory output  dropped 1.1 percent from July, when it
rose 3.1 percent, the  Office for National Statistics  said today
in London. The median forecast of 25 economists in a Bloomberg
News survey was for a decline of 0.7 percent. Total  industrial
output  fell 0.5 percent, matching economists’ forecasts.  Gilts Sale  The pound has strengthened 0.7 percent in the past six
months, according to Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes,
which track 10 developed-market currencies. The euro fell 2
percent and the dollar weakened 0.1 percent.  The 10-year gilt yield was little changed at 1.73 percent.
The 1.75 percent bond due September 2022 was at 100.21.  The U.K. sold the 2032 gilts at an average yield of 2.661
percent, compared with 3.015 percent at a similar sale on April
12. Investors bid for 2.12 times the amount of securities
allotted, up from 1.39 times at the previous auction.  Gilts returned 3 percent this year through yesterday,
according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. German bonds gained
3.1 percent and U.S. Treasuries rose 1.8 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
