Money-market indicators showed the
level of stress in short-term unsecured interbank lending in
euros held near the lowest since 2007.  The difference between the euro interbank offered rate and
overnight index swaps, known as the Euribor-OIS spread, was 12.9
basis points, or 0.129 percentage point, at 8:50 a.m. in  London ,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The measure reached
12.8 on Oct. 1, the lowest since August 2007.  The cost for European banks to borrow in dollars rose for
the second day. The three-month cross-currency basis swap was 24
basis points below Euribor from minus 23.7 yesterday. The one-
year basis swap was little changed at minus 24.  The European Banking Federationâ€™s euro overnight index
average, or Eonia, of unsecured lending deals was set at 0.094
percent yesterday from 0.093 percent on Oct. 5. The Eonia swap,
an estimate of average overnight borrowing costs over the next
three months, was nine basis points from 8.5 yesterday.  Lenders cut  overnight deposits  at the European Central Bank
yesterday, placing 290 billion euros ($375 billion) with the
Frankfurt-based central bank from 296 billion euros yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
