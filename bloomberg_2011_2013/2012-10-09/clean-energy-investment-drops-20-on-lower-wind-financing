Investment in renewable energy fell
20 percent from a year ago in the third quarter as wind farm
financings dropped and the pace of spending eased in the U.S.
and  India , Bloomberg New Energy Finance said.  The $56.6 billion injected into clean energy projects in
the third quarter was down 5 percent from the second quarter and
indicates that investment may fall for the first time in eight
years when figures for the whole of 2012 are tallied, the
London-based researcher said in a statement today.  The industry is suffering from excess capacity that’s
driven down prices for solar panels and wind turbines, meaning
developers pay less to install each megawatt of capacity.
Governments are paring support for the industry across the U.S.,
India and  Europe  after a record $280 billion was invested in
clean and low-carbon technologies in 2011.  “The location of some of the biggest projects financed in
quarter three this year highlight the geographical shift that is
taking place in clean energy, with established markets such as
the U.S., Europe and  China  losing momentum while newer markets
in South America, Asia and  Africa  pick up steam,” said  Michael Liebreich , chief executive officer of New Energy Finance.  Spending in the U.S. was $7.3 billion, down 28 percent from
the previous quarter and 62 percent on the same period last
year. Investment in India also slid 16 percent from the second
quarter and 60 percent from a year ago. Brazil showed a 94
percent increase to $1.9 billion from the three months ended in
June and a 24 percent boost from the same quarter a year ago.  Investment in solar power reached $33.8 billion, more than
double the $15.5 billion invested in wind in the third quarter.  Developers in  Morocco  were granted the go-ahead for a 160-
megawatt solar thermal plant costing $1.2 billion and a 300-
megawatt wind farm for $563 billion. In  Brazil , they won consent
for a 258-megawatt plan for wind projects costing $497 billion.
The largest financing was from a group of 22 small hydroelectric
projects totaling 980 megawatts in Ukraine, according to data
collected by New Energy Finance.  To contact the reporter on this story:
