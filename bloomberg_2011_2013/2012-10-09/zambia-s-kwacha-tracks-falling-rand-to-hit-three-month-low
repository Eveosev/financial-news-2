Zambia’s kwacha fell to its lowest in
more than three months against the dollar as the currency of
 Africa ’s biggest copper producer tracked South Africa’s slumping
rand, according to  Investrust Bank Plc. (INVESTRU)   The kwacha slumped as much as 0.7 percent to 5,148 a dollar
before paring its loss to 5,130 by 6 p.m. in Lusaka, the weakest
since July 3. It’s the second-worst performer over the past
three months after its Malawian counterpart among the African
currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  “The kwacha is strongly correlated to the South African
rand,” Mwewa Kyamulanda, a Lusaka-based currency trader with
Investrust Bank, said by phone from the capital. “It is most
likely that investors pulling out of the rand could be pulling
out of the kwacha too.”  The rand has lost 6.4 percent against the dollar over the
past three months as wildcat strikes spread across its mining
industry, affecting gold, platinum, chrome and coal producers.  A general flight from emerging-marking countries seen as
riskier by investors after the International Monetary Fund
decreased its global economic growth expectations may have also
contributed to the kwacha’s slide, Kyamulanda said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
