Iraq ’s Cabinet agreed to double the
capital of state-owned Trade Bank of Iraq to one trillion dinars
($858 million), State Minister Ali al-Dabbagh, the official
government spokesman, said in an e-mailed statement today.  Baghdad-based Trade Bank is under investigation for alleged
irregularities and its former president and chairman, Hussein al-Uzri, is facing an arrest warrant issued by the Iraqi
authorities, Ali al-Allaq, secretary general of the Council of
Ministers, said in June 2011. He has since been replaced by
Hamida al-Jaf.  Iraq’s central bank has asked private banks operating in
the country to raise their capital to 250 billion dinars by the
end of June 2013 to increase lending, investment and
competitiveness. The country has seven state-owned banks, 23
private banks and eight foreign lenders, according to the
central bank website. Iraq also has 11 Islamic banks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
