The premium for California-blend
gasoline, or Carbob, rose after Exxon Mobil Corp. reported late
yesterday its Torrance,  California , refinery plans to flare
between tomorrow and Oct. 31.  The emissions aren’t related to a breakdown, Exxon said in
a notice to state regulators. The 150,000-barrel-a-day refinery
resumed normal operations Oct. 5 after an Oct. 1 power failure
that reduced output.  California gasoline premiums surged as a result of the
outage and after a fire that knocked out a crude-processing unit
at  Chevron Corp. (CVX) ’s plant in Richmond, near San Francisco, in
August. The shutdown of a Chevron pipeline that delivers crude
to Northern California because of contamination also reduced
supplies.  The premium for California-blend gasoline in  Los Angeles 
versus futures on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  surged 22.5
cents to 57.5 cents a gallon at 1:43 p.m. in New York, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. The same fuel in  San Francisco 
jumped 22.5 cents to 49.5 cents above futures.  California-grade, or CARB, diesel in Los Angeles was
unchanged at 15.5 cents a gallon higher than heating oil futures
on the Nymex. The fuel in San Francisco was steady at  15 cents
a gallon versus futures.  Conventional, 87-octane gasoline in Portland, Oregon, added
8 cents to 36 cents against gasoline futures.  To contact the reporter on this story:
