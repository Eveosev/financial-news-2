Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A) ’s plan to
sell two small railroads it owned when it bought Burlington
Northern Santa Fe Corp. will satisfy U.S. rail regulators.  The U.S. Surface Transportation Board, in a  letter  today to
Burlington Northern Executive Vice President Roger Nober, said
that “prompt” sales of the railroads would be “an appropriate
remedy.”  West Virginia Democrat  Jay Rockefeller , the chairman of a
U.S. Senate committee overseeing railroads, last week said the
purchase by Berkshire, where  Warren Buffett  is chief executive
officer, should have been reviewed by the rail regulator and not
just U.S. financial regulators.  STB Chairman Daniel Elliott told Burlington Northern to
send the board written progress reports on Nov. 1 and Dec. 1
with the status of the sales.  To contact the reporter on this story:
