Kuwait plans to increase spending by
9.3 percent in the current fiscal year, as the  International
Monetary Fund  forecasts a slowdown in the economy of OPEC’s
third-biggest producer.  The 2012-2013 budget, approved late yesterday by the
Cabinet, has projected spending of 21.2 billion dinars ($75.5
billion), above expenditures of 19.4 billion dinars forecast in
the last fiscal year that ended on March 31, state-run  KUNA  news
agency reported, citing Finance Minister Nayef Al-Hajraf.
Revenue is forecast at 13.9 billion dinars. KUNA didn’t say what
oil price the budget is based on.  “It’s good news, because the initial spending forecast was
22.7 billion dinars,” Jassim Al-Saadoun, head of Kuwait-based
Al-Shall Economic Consultants, said by phone today. “Spending
is still too high and unsustainable, and in the medium to long
term it will be disastrous.” Spending projections include about
9 billion dinars for salaries and wages, he said.  While Kuwait’s economy grew 8.2 percent in 2011, it was the
slowest among the six Gulf Cooperation Council countries in the
previous five years. The IMF forecasts economic growth at 6.3
percent this year and 1.9 percent in 2013.  Kuwait will exhaust all oil revenue by 2017 if the
government’s current spending policy continues, the IMF said in
May. Current spending is “very high” and must be reduced with
more going toward investments and capital expenditures, central
bank Governor Mohammad Al-Hashel said on Oct. 1. His predecessor
of 25 years, Sheikh Salem AbdulAziz Al-Sabah, resigned in
February, criticizing the government’s increase of public
expenditures “to unprecedented levels.”  Spurring Savings  Al-Hajraf said last month the government will raise revenue
allocations to its Future Generations Fund this fiscal year to
25 percent from 10 percent to “encourage saving.” The decision
won’t be at the expense of  capital spending , he said.  Kuwait posted a record surplus of 13.2 billion dinars in
the last fiscal year as  oil prices  and output rose. Government
revenue was 30.2 billion dinars, including oil revenue of 28.6
billion dinars, and spending was 17 billion dinars, 12.5 percent
below budget.  The budget will be issued by a decree from the emir that
needs to be approved by the new parliament when it is elected.  To contact the reporter on this story:
