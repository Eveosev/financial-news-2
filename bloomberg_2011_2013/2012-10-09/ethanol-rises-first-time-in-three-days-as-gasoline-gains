Ethanol futures rose for the first
time in three days as gasoline prices increased and production
stayed at a record low.  Futures gained as gasoline surged to the highest level in
more than a week as U.S. refinery shutdowns threatened supplies.
Ethanol  production  tumbled 3 percent in the week ended Sept. 28
to 785,000 barrels a day, the least since the Energy Department
began publishing weekly data in June 2010.  “The strong gasoline market is helping ethanol a little
bit,” said Mike Blackford, a consultant at INTL FCStone Group
in  Des Moines ,  Iowa . “The underlying fundamentals of the
ethanol market have been altered with cutbacks in production.”  Denatured ethanol for November delivery rose 1.2 cents, or
0.5 percent, to settle at $2.408 a gallon on the  Chicago  Board
of Trade. The more active December contract increased 0.4
percent to $2.395.  In cash market trading, ethanol on the West Coast was
unchanged at $2.575 a gallon, data compiled by Bloomberg showed.
In the U.S. Gulf, the additive increased 1.5 cents to $2.465.
Ethanol in Chicago gained 2 cents to $2.405 a gallon, and, in
New York, the biofuel advanced 1.5 cents to $2.495.  Gasoline for November delivery climbed 6.56, or 2.3
percent, to $2.9587 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange , the highest settlement since Sept. 28. The contract
covers reformulated gasoline, made to be blended with ethanol
before delivery to filling stations.  Oil Rally  Crude oil for November delivery rose $3.06, or 3.4 percent,
to end at $92.39 a barrel.  Corn for December delivery was unchanged at $7.42 a bushel
in Chicago.  Based on December contracts for ethanol and corn, plants
are losing about 35 cents on each gallon of the biofuel
produced, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That doesn’t
include profit from the sale of dried distillers’ grains, a
byproduct of ethanol production that can be fed to livestock.  To contact the reporter on this story:
