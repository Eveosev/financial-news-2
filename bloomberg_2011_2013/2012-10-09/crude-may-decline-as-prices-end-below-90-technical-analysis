Oil may drop below $80 a barrel after
settling below $90 for a second day, according to a  technical
analysis  by Bill Baruch, senior market strategist at
Iitrader.com in  Chicago .  Failing to break above $90, near the November contract’s
100-day moving average of $90.60, may send futures to the July
25 intraday low of $87.50 and trigger a further decline, Baruch
said. After closing below the 100-day moving average at $99.68
on May 4, the November contract fell to $78.73 on June 28, the
intraday low for the year.  “The continued close below $90 will encourage selling,”
Baruch said. “It’s going to get ugly if we break that $87.50
level. We could go all the way down to this year’s low near
$78.”  Oil for November delivery slid 55 cents, or 0.6 percent, to
settle at $89.33 a barrel yesterday on the  New York  Mercantile
Exchange. It was the third close below $90 in four days.  Prices may rebound if they stay above $87.50 this week,
Baruch said. The November contract expires on Oct. 24.  To contact the reporter on this story:
