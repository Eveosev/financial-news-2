Getin Noble Bank SA (GNB) , the Polish
lender controlled by billionaire Leszek Czarnecki, headed for
the lowest in more than a week as ING Groep NV initiated
coverage with a sell recommendation.  The  stock  lost as much as 4 percent before paring its loss
to 2.3 percent at 1.71 zloty, the weakest level on a closing
basis since Sept. 28, by 11:16 a.m. in Warsaw. ING set the
share-price estimate at 1.55 zloty a share.  Getin Noble is looking to “shift to a more stable model
based on long-term relationships with good clients,” Piotr Palenik, a Warsaw-based analyst at ING, said in a research note
yesterday. “We like the change but upside will be visible in
2014 or even later.”  The shares are unchanged this year, compared with a 12
percent advance in the WIG20 stock index, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The company’s second-quarter net income
fell to 82.4 million zloty ($26.2 million) from 714.8 million
zloty a year earlier, it said on Aug. 10.  To contact the reporter on this story:
