(Corrects percentage decline in second paragraph.)  Chevron Corp. (CVX)  said third-quarter
earnings were “substantially” lower than second-quarter
results amid lower oil output, falling crude prices and weaker
U.S. refining returns. The stock fell 1.7 percent.  Oil and natural gas output fell 4 percent to the equivalent
of 2.518 million barrels a day in June and July from 2.624
million for the entire second quarter, the  San Ramon ,
California-based company said in a statement today.  Chevron said production fell as Hurricane Isaac shut wells
in the Gulf of Mexico and oilfield repairs were carried out in
the U.K. and Kazakhstan. The company received an average price
of $96.86 for each barrel of crude pumped outside the U.S., 2.4
percent less than in the prior quarter.  Chevron’s refining profit declined after an August fire
damaged a crude-processing unit at a Richmond, California,
plant. The unit will remain out of service through the end of
December, the company said. A refinery in Pascagoula,
Mississippi, was shut for part of the quarter as Isaac passed
through the region, according to the statement.  Chevron declined 1.7 percent to $115.36 at 5:25 p.m. in New
York.  Chevron, the second-largest U.S. energy company by market
value, is scheduled to release full third-quarter results on
Nov. 2.  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)  is the biggest U.S. energy company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
