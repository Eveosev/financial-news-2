The euro rose from a one-week low
against the dollar after failing to fall below its 200-day
moving average.  The 17-nation currency pared its advance after Standard &
Poor’s cut  Spain ’s debt rating to one level above junk. The euro
declined earlier after meetings of European finance ministers
this week failed to reassure investors the euro region’s
sovereign-debt crisis will be contained. South Africa’s rand
climbed for a second day as transport-union members returned to
work after a strike.  “It’s more market participants driving it, not really the
fundamentals, which basically point to a downward-euro trend,”
said Alfonso Esparza, senior currency analyst in Toronto at the
online currency-trading firm Oanda Corp.  Europe ’s shared currency rose as much as 0.2 percent to
$1.2914 after earlier falling to $1.2835, the lowest level since
Oct. 1. It closed at $1.2875 at 5 p.m. in  New York  after the
Spanish rate cut. The euro’s 200-day moving average is $1.2823.
The level is seen by some traders as a barrier to further
decreases.  The euro fell 0.2 percent to 100.66 yen, after sliding
earlier to 100.44 yen, also the least since Oct. 1.  Japan ’s
currency gained 0.1 percent to 78.19 per dollar.  S&P cited mounting economic and political risks as it
lowered Spain’s debt rating two levels to BBB- from BBB+.  Finance Ministers  European finance ministers meeting in  Luxembourg  this week
saluted  Greece ’s determination to trim its budget. The region’s
crisis began in the nation three years ago. Ministers paired the
encouragement with a demand that Greece commit to a list of 89
policy steps before an Oct. 18-19 leaders’ summit.  The euro closed at a four-month high of $1.3130 on Sept.
14, the day after the  Federal Reserve  announced a third round of
asset purchases under the quantitative-easing stimulus strategy.
The U.S. central bank said it would buy $40 billion of mortgage
bonds a month until the economic recovery is well-established.  The  European Central Bank  announced an unlimited bond-
purchase program for euro-bloc governments on Sept. 6 to stem
the region’s debt turmoil.  The shared currency has traded this week between $1.2835
and $1.3049.  “There’s not been any news,” Kit Juckes, head of foreign-
exchange research at Societe Generale SA in  London , said in a
telephone interview. “In a sense, this is a permanent war
between bad news in Europe and globally and desire not to fight
the Fed and central banks and their money printing.”  Beige Book  The 17-nation currency gained earlier after a Fed regional
business survey said the  U.S. economy  expanded “modestly” last
month. The Fed’s  Beige Book  business survey said expansion in
the U.S. economy last month was supported by improvements in
housing and auto sales, even as the labor market showed little
change.  “ Consumer spending  was generally reported to be flat to up
slightly since the last report,” the Fed said in the survey,
which is based on accounts from the 12 district Fed banks.
Conditions in manufacturing were “somewhat improved,”
according to the report, which provides anecdotal evidence on
the health of the economy two weeks before the  Federal Open
Market Committee  meets in  Washington  on Oct. 23-24.  The euro fell earlier after the  International Monetary Fund 
said Europe’s banks may need to sell more assets through 2013 if
policy makers fail to stem the fiscal crisis.  Shrink Assets  Failure to implement fiscal tightening or set up a single
supervisory system in the timing agreed could force 58 European
Union banks from  UniCredit SpA (UCG)  to Deutsche Bank AG to shrink
assets by as much as $4.5 trillion, the IMF said in its Global
Financial Stability Report. That’s up 18 percent from its April
estimate.  The euro rose 0.6 percent over the past month against nine
industrial-nation counterparts tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-
Weighted Indexes. The dollar gained 0.5 percent, and the yen
slipped 0.2 percent.  The IMF also lowered its growth forecasts this week. The
world economy will expand 3.3 percent this year, the slowest
pace since the 2009 recession, versus the July forecast of 3.5
percent, the Washington-based organization said in a report. The
euro region’s economy will contract 0.4 percent in 2012, 0.1
percentage point less than forecast in July, and grow 0.2
percent in 2013, versus 0.7 percent predicted earlier, it said.  Mexico ’s peso and the Indian rupee were among the worst-
performing currencies among 31 major peers of the greenback.  The rupee declined for a fourth day, dropping 0.6 percent
to 53.059 per dollar. S&P said the nation may lose its
investment-grade  credit rating  if economic growth slows and
political opposition to policy changes increases.  Peso Drops  The Mexican currency sank after the IMF lowered its growth
forecast for  Latin America  and the Caribbean area for 2012 and
2013. The currency depreciated 0.8 percent to 12.9774 per dollar
after losing as much as 0.8 percent yesterday, the most in more
than two weeks.  The peso may strengthen to its highest level versus the
 U.S. dollar  in more than a year following a corrective phase,
according to JPMorgan Chase & Co., citing oversold and diverging
momentum measures.  The currency may depreciate to the range of 12.91 to 12.95
per dollar before weakening to 13 in the short term, Niall O’Connor, a New York-based technical analyst at JPMorgan, wrote
today in a note to clients. It then may bounce off that level
and gain to 12.55 to the greenback, the strongest since
September 2011, O’Connor said.  The rand rose against most of its 16 major counterparts
tracked by Bloomberg, gaining as much as 0.4 percent to 8.7882
per dollar before trading at 8.7453, up 0.1 percent.  The South African currency weakened 6 percent in four days
of losses through Oct. 8 as strikes in the country’s mining and
transportation industries spread to other areas of the economy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
