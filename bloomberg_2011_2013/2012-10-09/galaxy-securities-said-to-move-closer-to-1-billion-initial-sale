China  Galaxy Securities Co. moved a
step closer to an initial stock sale after getting a government
waiver from a shareholding rule that had barred it from going
public, said two people with knowledge of the matter.  The Beijing-based brokerage may seek to raise about $1
billion in  Hong Kong  and  Shanghai , said the people, who asked
not to be identified because the plan is private.  Galaxy Securities is controlled by a unit of China’s
sovereign wealth fund that also owns a stake in Shenyin & Wanguo
Securities Co. No single investor can control more than one
brokerage, and firms like Galaxy Securities can’t go public
until they meet the shareholding rule, the nation’s securities
regulator said in 2008.  Central Huijin Investment Ltd. , a unit of China Investment
Corp., owned 79 percent of Galaxy Securities at the end of 2011,
according to Huijin’s website. Huijin held a 37 percent stake in
Shenyin & Wanguo at the time, the website shows.  Two phone calls to Galaxy Securities’s press office went
unanswered yesterday. The China Securities Regulatory Commission
didn’t immediately respond to faxed questions.  Even after receiving an ownership waiver, Galaxy Securities
still needs CSRC approval for the planned IPO, the people said.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
