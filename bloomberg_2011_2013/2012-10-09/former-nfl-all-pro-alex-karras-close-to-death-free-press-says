Former Detroit Lions defensive tackle
Alex Karras has been given days to live after suffering kidney
failure within the past two weeks, the  Detroit Free Press
reported , citing a friend of the Karras family.  Lions President Tom Lewand said in a  statement  last night
that the organization is “deeply saddened” by the news.  Karras, 77, is a three-time All-Pro who played 12 National
Football League seasons with the Lions from 1958-70. He then
went on to a television and movie career, spending three years
as an NFL analyst on ABC’s “Monday Night Football,” getting
cast as Mongo in the 1974 movie “Blazing Saddles” and starring
in the ABC sitcom “Webster.”  “Perhaps no player in Lions history attained as much
success and notoriety for what he did after his playing days as
did Alex,” Lewand said. “We know Alex first and foremost as
one of the cornerstones to our Fearsome Foursome defensive line
of the 1960s and also as one of the greatest defensive linemen
to ever play in the NFL.”  The Detroit Free Press reported that Tom McInerney, a
friend of Karras’s since the 1950s, said Karras’s wife, Susan
Clark, told him of her husband’s kidney failure. Karras has also
had dementia and cancer in recent years and is part of the mass
concussion lawsuit more than 3,000 former players have filed
against the NFL, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
