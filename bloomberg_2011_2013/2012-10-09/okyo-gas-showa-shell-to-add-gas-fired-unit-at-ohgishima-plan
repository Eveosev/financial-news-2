Tokyo Gas Co. (9531)  and  Showa Shell Sekiyu
K.K. (5002)  will build an additional natural gas-fired unit at the
Ohgishima plant near Tokyo.  Ohgishima Power Co., a joint venture between the two
companies, both based in Tokyo, will install the 407-megawatt
thermal facility at the plant, which currently has two gas-fired
units with a combined capacity of 814.2 megawatts, in the
Kanagawa prefecture, south of Tokyo, the companies said today in
a joint statement.  Tokyo Gas plans to increase its electricity output to as
much as 5,000 megawatts by 2020 from 2,000 megawatts last year,
it said in its  long-term business plan  announced in November.
The importance of thermal-power generation will increase in
 Japan ’s energy mix as the country aims to phase out nuclear
power by the decade ending 2039 and as renewable energy is still
expensive and often unstable, the government said in September.  The two companies may invest as much as 40 billion yen
($511 million) to build the No. 3 Ohgishima unit, the Nikkei
newspaper reported Oct. 6, without saying how it obtained the
information. Shin Shizukuishi, general manager of  Tokyo  Gas’s
total energy business department, declined to comment on the
project cost at a news conference today.  Tokyo Gas owns 75 percent stake in the joint venture
Ohgishima Power with Showa Shell holding the rest.  To contact the reporter on this story:
