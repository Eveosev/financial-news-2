Buccaneer Energy Ltd. (BCC) , an energy
producer that entered Alaska in 2010, said it plans to drill at
least four onshore wells and three offshore wells in the state
over the next year as it seeks to boost output.  The company, based in Sydney, has been getting prepared for
drilling, including with seismic work, Jim Watt, president of
the Buccaneer Alaska LLC unit, said during an interview at an
Oil Council conference in Houston yesterday.  “Now we’re to the point where we’re funding drilling,”
Watt said. “And this is where we’re going to see a step change
in value as we move forward, especially over the next 6 to 12
months.”  Buccaneer is seeking to produce natural gas for an  Alaska 
market that can be tight, especially during winter months, Watt
said. The company has a gas sales agreement with an annual
weighted price of $6.24 per thousand cubic feet, according to a
report on its website. That’s higher than gas futures in New
York, which settled at less than $3.50 per million British
thermal units yesterday.  Buccaneer, which is listed for trading in  Australia , may
examine a further listing in areas such as the U.S. and  Canada 
as it grows and moves forward with drilling, Watt said. In
January, Buccaneer said it began production in Alaska at its
Kenai Loop project.  The company’s sales agreement in Alaska allows it to
deliver as much as 15 million cubic feet of gas a day, according
to a report on its website. Gas exports also are possible from
Alaska. Buccaneer’s initial project in the state has been
producing about 5 million cubic feet a day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
