Williamson Tea Kenya Ltd. (GWKL) , a producer
of the leaves, surged the most in eight months on bets higher
prices will boost the company’s profit this fiscal year.  Williamson’s stock rallied by the daily limit of 10 percent
to 220 shillings as of 2:46 p.m. in the capital, Nairobi, with
the volume of shares traded at 12 times the three-month moving
average. A close at that level would mark the largest gain since
Feb. 10.  “They have posted profits for three consecutive years and
tea prices have been in a sweet spot for a long time so they
will do better since there is a lot of cash on the balance
sheet,” Aly Khan Satchu, chief executive officer of Nairobi-
based investment company Rich Management Ltd., said in a phone
interview today.  Kenya , the world’s biggest exporter of black tea, said Oct.
1 the average tea price through August rose 4 percent to $3.15 a
kilogram (2.2 pounds) from a year earlier. Tea-export earnings
in East Africa’s largest economy are forecast to increase to 110
billion shillings this year from 109 billion shillings in 2011
on better prices, even as output slides, according to the Tea
Board of Kenya.  Williamson in June posted a 21 percent increase in revenue
to 3.28 billion shillings for the 12 months through March,
boosting profit 1 percent to 884.4 million shillings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
