Mostly warm, dry Midwest weather
last week helped U.S. farmers move past the halfway point
in collecting the soybean crop and closer to completing the
corn harvest.  About 58 percent of the soybeans were collected as of
Oct. 7, up from 41 percent a week earlier and 40 percent,
on average, from 2007 to 2011, the  U.S. Department of
Agriculture  said today in a  report . The  corn  harvest was 69
percent complete, up from 54 percent a week earlier and an
average of 28 percent for the previous five years.  The
harvest pace is the fastest since the USDA began collecting
the data in 1981.  “Farmers are wrapping up corn and soybean harvests in
central  Iowa  with about 90 percent completed,” said Kent Jessen, the director of merchandising for Heartland
Cooperative in  West Des Moines , Iowa. “August rain helped
to boost soybean yields, and corn yields are a little
better than first feared” after drought in June and July
damaged crops, said Jessen, who manages grain supplies for
52 depots in 17 counties in the state, the biggest producer
of both crops.  Corn futures for December delivery closed unchanged at
$7.42 a bushel on the  Chicago  Board of Trade. Soybean
futures for November delivery dropped 0.1 percent to $15.50
a bushel.  Approximately 37 percent of the soybeans were in good
or excellent condition as of Oct. 7, up from 35 percent a
week earlier, the USDA said. About 25 percent of the corn
crop got the top ratings as of Sept. 30, the department’s
final assessment for that crop.  Winter Wheat  The winter-wheat crop, grown in the Midwest and Great
Plains, was 57 percent planted as of Oct. 7. That compares
with 40 percent a week earlier and 59 percent, on average,
from 2007 to 2011. About 23 percent of the plants had
emerged, compared with 12 percent a week earlier and the
previous five-year average of 30 percent. The crop goes
dormant over the winter until about March, and is harvested
starting in May.  Rains the past week from  Arkansas  to Ohio improved
soil moisture for planting,  Allen Motew , a meteorologist
for QT Weather in Chicago, said today in a note to clients.
A warmer, wetter weather pattern will prompt faster
planting the next two weeks from Texas to  Nebraska , Motew
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
