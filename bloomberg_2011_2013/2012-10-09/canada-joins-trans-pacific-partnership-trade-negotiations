Canada joined 10 other countries,
including the U.S. and  Malaysia , in negotiations on a Pacific
region trade pact, Trade Minister Ed Fast said.  Canada formally entered the talks after completing domestic
consultations on the agreement under discussion by the Trans-
Pacific Partnership, whose market represents more than 658
million people with about $20.5 trillion in output, Fast said in
an e-mailed statement today.  “Opening new markets and increasing Canadian exports to
fast-growing markets throughout the Asia-Pacific region is a key
part of our government’s plan to create jobs, growth and long-
term prosperity,” Fast said.  The other countries are Mexico, Australia, Brunei, Chile,
 New Zealand , Peru, Singapore and Vietnam.  Canada was invited to join the talks in June during the
summit of leaders from the Group of 20 nations in Los Cabos,
 Mexico .  To contact the reporter on this story:
