Newfield Exploration Co. (NFX) , a petroleum
producer focusing about a third of its spending on the mid-
continental U.S., rose the most in more than three months after
Continental Resources Inc. announced a shale-oil discovery in
 Oklahoma  may yield more than a billion barrels.  Newfield, based in The Woodlands,  Texas , climbed 6.1
percent to $32.62 at the close in New York, the most since June
29.  A shale-oil discovery in Oklahoma may add the equivalent of
1.8 billion barrels of crude to Continental’s reserves and is
geologically similar to the Bakken region, the Oklahoma City-
based company said in a slide presentation today. Newfield has
about 135,000 net acres in the Cana Woodford project in
Oklahoma, which is near Continental’s discovery, according to a
September slide  presentation .  Newfield plans to spend about $300 million in the Cana
Woodford as its transitions into a company that focuses on oil
and liquids production, according to the September presentation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
