Individual Greek investors accounted
for 40 percent of trading in the nation’s stocks during
September, the highest level for the month since at least 2007,
according to Athens Exchange Chairman Socrates Lazaridis.  That’s a 10 percentage point increase from last year, data
provided by Hellenic Exchanges SA as of Sept. 28 showed.
Overseas institutions, such as pensions and mutual funds, made
up 35 percent last month, down from 46 percent a year ago, based
on a statement from the exchange.  “In 2012, we’ve seen an increase in the participation of
local investors in trading activity,” Lazaridis said in an
interview at Bloomberg’s  New York  headquarters yesterday. “It
is the first time that local investors have shown more activity
than international investors. Confidence starts from the local
community.”  The  Athens Stock Exchange Index (ASE)  has surged 74 percent since
its 2012 low on June 5 and has posted the third-biggest gain out
of 24 developed market benchmark gauges this year, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The measure is still 84 percent
below its 2007 peak.  The benchmark for Greek equities tumbled 52 percent last
year as the country struggled through a sovereign debt crisis
and speculation that it would leave the 17-nation euro. New
International Monetary Fund forecasts put  Greece ’s debt at 182
percent of gross domestic product in 2013, up from an April
forecast of 161 percent and making it harder to reach a target
of 120 percent by 2020.  Foreign Ownership  Foreign investors owned 50 percent of the market value of
stocks listed on the Athens Stock Exchange last month, according
to Lazaridis in the interview. About $14.5 million has flown
into the U.S-listed exchange traded fund  Global X FTSE Greece 20
ETF (GREK)  this year, according to data by New York-based research firm
XTF Inc.  “What is also important is to see that foreign investors
did not abandon the Greek market,” he said. “Some foreign
investors left, but there were some new investors who came in.”  Individual investors made up 27 percent of trading in Greek
equities during September 2007 before the financial crisis
began, while international institutions accounted for 56 percent
at the time, the data show.  Greece has been mired in a recession since 2008. While the
country has narrowed its deficit from more than 15 percent of
gross domestic product in 2009 to 9.1 percent last year, it
faces continued austerity measures and budgets cuts that have
crimped consumers and businesses. Economists surveyed by
Bloomberg predict Greece’s economy will contract through 2014.  German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  arrived in Greece yesterday
for the first time since the debt crisis began in 2009 after the
finance ministers yesterday hailed the country’s determination
to cut its budget and reshape its economy, raising the chances
that aid will keep flowing to Greece.  To contact the reporter on this story:
