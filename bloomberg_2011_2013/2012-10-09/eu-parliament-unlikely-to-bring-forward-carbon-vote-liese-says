The European Parliament is unlikely
to bring forward its first vote on a change to the European
Union emission trading law that would enable curtailing an
oversupply of carbon permits, a member of the assembly said.  “It’s difficult,” Peter Liese, a German Christian
Democratic member of the parliament, told a seminar in Brussels
today. “I’d not be honest if I promised that we could
accelerate the vote. It’ll probably be the timetable that has
been circulated.”  The parliament’s environment committee, of which Liese is a
member, is scheduled to vote on the amendment to the EU
emissions trading legislation on Feb. 19. The committee decision
will be followed by a vote by the whole assembly and will then
require qualified majority support by national governments in a
process known as co-decision.  “Co-decision in the parliament normally takes at least
nine months and most of the time is more than one year,” Liese
said today. “To speed it up now is possible but to speed it up
more than the timetable that has been adopted is very
difficult.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
