A 14-year-old girl who campaigned
against the Taliban in  Pakistan  was injured after she and a
schoolmate were shot by an unidentified gunman in the tribal
region of Swat, police spokesman Ziaur Rehman said.  Malala Yousufzai was nominated last year for the
 International Children’s Peace Prize  after she wrote a blog
under an assumed name for the British Broadcasting Corp. to
publicize Taliban atrocities, the  Associated Press  of Pakistan
reported.  The Pakistani Taliban claimed responsibility for the
attack, Geo television reported today, without saying where it
got the information.  A bearded gunman approached a vehicle taking children home
from school and asked for Yousufzai before shooting her and
another girl, the channel reported, citing one of the occupants.  An army helicopter moved the activist to a hospital in
 Peshawar , the provincial capital of the Khyber Pakhtunkhawa,
following intensive care in a local facility in Swat, Geo TV
said.  President Asif Ali Zardari condemned the attack, calling it
a “dastardly act” in a statement issued today by his office.
Pakistan will “continue its fight against militants till its
logical conclusion,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
