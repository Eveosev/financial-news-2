Wall Street’s cash bonus pool is
likely to fall for a second straight year as the financial
industry grapples with market turmoil, economic weakness and new
rules,  New York  state Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli said.  Revenue and compensation trends have “edged downward”
since February, when DiNapoli estimated that the 2011 pool for
Wall Street declined by 13.5 percent to $19.7 billion, the
comptroller said today in a report.  “Based on those trends, the total cash bonus pool for work
performed in 2012 is likely to decline for a second year in a
row,” DiNapoli said in a statement.  The last time the pool shrank for  two consecutive years  was
in 2007 and 2008, at the beginning of the global financial
crisis, according to the comptroller’s office.  Member firms of the New York Stock Exchange earned $10.5
billion in the first half of 2012, and profits may climb to $15
billion by year-end, said DiNapoli, a 58-year-old Democrat. Last
year, the firms earned $12.6 billion in the first six months,
then lost $4.9 billion as the  European debt crisis  deepened, he
said. Wall Street firms cut 4,800 jobs from May through August
of this year, he said.  “The securities industry remains in transition, and
volatility in profits and employment show that we have not yet
reached the new normal,” DiNapoli said. “The securities
industry is still grappling with the fallout from the financial
crisis, new regulations and slow economic recovery.”  Employee Expectations  DiNapoli’s forecast of a shrinking bonus pool contrasts
with employee expectations. Of 911 financial professionals who
responded to a survey e-mailed by  eFinancialCareers.com , 48
percent anticipated a higher payout, up from 41 percent in a
similar survey last year, the job-search website said in a
statement yesterday.  “The mood is better, some people will be happier, but we
still have another quarter to go,” Constance Melrose,
eFinancialCareers.com’s managing director in the Americas, said
in a telephone interview. “People are less pessimistic than
they were a year ago.”  Wall Street employees took home an average cash bonus of
$121,150 in 2011, according to DiNapoli’s February estimate.  Since the beginning of 2012, the industry in New York City
has lost 1,200 jobs, DiNapoli said. Wall Street firms cut 28,100
employees during the financial crisis and have added back only
7,900 since November 2007, he said.  Economic Concern  In 2011, the average salary reached $362,950, 0.5 percent
higher than in 2010, DiNapoli said. That’s higher than before
the financial crisis, he said.  The central worry for Wall Street workers is the U.S.
economy, with 59 percent saying that it has the biggest
potential negative influence on financial-services compensation,
according to the eFinancialCareers.com survey. Ten percent said
 Europe ’s debt crisis is the biggest concern and 12 percent chose
the Dodd-Frank Act, which revamped financial regulation,
according to the survey.  In fiscal 2008, Wall Street accounted for more than 20
percent of New York state’s tax revenue and 12 percent of New
York City’s. By fiscal 2011, those percentages had dropped to 14
percent and 7 percent, respectively, DiNapoli said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
