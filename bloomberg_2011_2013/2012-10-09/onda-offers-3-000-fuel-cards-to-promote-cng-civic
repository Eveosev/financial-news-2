Honda Motor Co. (7267) , the only automaker
selling compressed natural gas cars to U.S. drivers, will offer
$3,000 of the fuel to buyers of its CNG-powered Civic to expand
sales of the vehicle amid surging  California  gasoline prices.  The promotion for Honda’s Civic Natural Gas is being done
with  Clean Energy Fuels Corp. (CLNE) , the largest owner of U.S. natural
gas stations, the carmaker said in a statement today. The fuel
debit card can be used only at stations operated by Clean
Energy,  23 percent  owned by billionaire  T. Boone Pickens .  “We want to draw even more consumer attention to the many
environmental and cost-saving benefits of the vehicle,” said
Angie Nucci, a Torrance, California-based spokeswoman for Honda.  Honda has said it wants to sell as many as 5,000 of the
Indiana-built Civic Natural Gas this year. The Tokyo-based
company’s promotion of natural gas, a domestically sourced fuel
that’s cheaper than gasoline and emits less tailpipe exhaust,
comes as U.S.-based  General Motors Co. (GM)  and Chrysler Group LLC
are readying pickups powered by the fuel.  Gasoline prices jumped late last week in California owing
to reduced output at the state’s refineries. The average price
of unleaded regular gasoline in California was  $4.67 a gallon  as
of early today, according to AAA’s website. Regular gasoline at
the pump averaged  $3.82 a gallon  nationwide on Oct. 8.  The Civic Natural Gas sedan costs $26,305, or $2,105 more
than a hybrid version, according to Honda’s  website . The car
averages 31 miles (50 kilometers) per gallon equivalent of fuel,
and holds the equivalent of 8 gallons of compressed gas.  Honda has inventory of about 1,500 Civic Natural Gas
vehicles, Nucci said. While the promotion runs until the end of
2012, the fuel cards don’t expire, she said.  The equivalent of a gallon of compressed natural gas cost
an average of  $2.05 in July , according to the Energy Department.
Incentives for owners in California also include a permit
allowing solo drivers to use highway car pool lanes.  Honda’s American depositary receipts fell 2.3 percent to
$29.83 at the close in  New York . They’ve declined 2.4 percent
this year. Clean Energy fell 2 percent to $13.59 and has
risen 9.1 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
