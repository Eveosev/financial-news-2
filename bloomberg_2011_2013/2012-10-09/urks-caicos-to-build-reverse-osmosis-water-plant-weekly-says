The Turks & Caicos government has
agreed to build a new salt-water reverse osmosis water
production plant on Grand Turk, the Weekly News said, cited an
$890,000 contract signed by Governor Ric Todd.  Matrix, a unit of Florida water treatment provider Aqua-
Chem Inc., will design, supply, install and commission the plant
in a project expected to be completed by February, the weekly
reported. Production capacity of the SWRO plant will be about
300,000 gallons a day. Water demand on Grand Turk is about
350,000 gallons a day, the publication said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
