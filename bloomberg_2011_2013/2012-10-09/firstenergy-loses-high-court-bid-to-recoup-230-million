The U.S. Supreme Court turned away an
appeal by two  FirstEnergy Corp. (FE)  units that sought to recoup $230
million they say they spent to acquire power for serving their
Pennsylvania retail power customers.  The nation’s highest court today left intact a Pennsylvania
state court decision that said a 1998 settlement precluded
FirstEnergy’s Metropolitan Edison and Pennsylvania Electric from
recovering the disputed money through higher rates.  The costs stem from “transmission line losses,” the
electricity that dissipates because of friction or resistance as
power travels through lines.  FirstEnergy is based in Akron,  Ohio .  The case is Metropolitan Edison v. Pennsylvania Public
Utility Commission, 12-4.  To contact the reporter on this story:
