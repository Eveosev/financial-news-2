Russian  consumer confidence  fell in
the third quarter for the first time since January-March 2011 as
people turned less optimistic about the economic outlook.  The consumer confidence index fell 2 points to minus 6, the
weakest since the fourth quarter of last year, the Federal
Statistics Service in Moscow said in a statement e-mailed today.  Russia, where consumer spending accounts for about half the
economy, is facing slowing growth after inflation accelerated to
a 10-month high in September. The World Bank yesterday cut its
forecasts for economic expansion this year and next, citing the
country’s weak harvest, global economic turmoil and faster price
growth eroding purchasing power.  “A deterioration is likely given the faster inflation,
increase in tariffs and the general discussion among the public
about a looming crisis,” Dmitry Polevoy, chief economist for
 Russia  and Kazakhstan at ING Groep NV in Moscow, said before the
release. “Slower retail sales growth and lending are also
indirect indicators that may show some decline in optimism.”  The most significant weight on consumer sentiment was a
drop in optimism about the economy in the near term, the service
said. That index fell 6 points to minus 2, according to the
report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
