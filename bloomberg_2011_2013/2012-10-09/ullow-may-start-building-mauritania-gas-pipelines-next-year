Tullow Oil Plc (TLW) , the U.K.-based
explorer with the most licenses in  Africa , will start work on a
natural gas project in Mauritania once talks with potential
buyers are finished, said Tim O’Hanlon, vice president of
African business.  Construction of facilities including pipelines for the
Banda gas field will begin after customer negotiations are
finished at the end of next year, he said in an interview on the
sidelines of an industry conference in Nouakchott, the capital,
today. Gas production is planned for late 2014 or early 2015, he
said.  Mauritania, a $3.6 billion economy which earns foreign
currency from exports of  iron ore , gold and fish, plans to build
a power plant to use Banda gas, the state-owned Horizons
newspaper reported in July. Tullow, which has a 22 percent stake
in the country’s Chinguetti field, estimates reserves at Banda
of 500 billion cubic feet, O’Hanlon said.  Kinross Gold Corp.’s (K)  Tasiast gold mine is also planning to
use Banda gas for electricity production, he said. Talks are
being held with other potential buyers, according to O’Hanlon.  To contact the reporter on this story:
