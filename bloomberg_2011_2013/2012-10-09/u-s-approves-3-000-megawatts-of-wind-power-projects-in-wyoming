The U.S. has approved the development
of two wind-power projects in  Wyoming  that may generate as much
as 3,000 megawatts, enough electricity for almost 1 million
homes.  The Bureau of Land Management authorized site-specific
environmental analysis to begin at the Chokecherry and Sierra
Madre projects in southeastern Wyoming, according to a  statement 
today. The  Power Company of Wyoming LLC  will develop and operate
as many as 1,000 turbines on about 220,000 acres, according to
the statement.  “Wyoming has some of the best wind energy resources in the
world, and there’s no doubt that this project has the potential
to be a landmark example for the nation,” Interior Secretary
Ken Salazar said in the statement.  The effort is part of President  Barack Obama ’s strategy to
promote wider use of renewable energy on federal land. The U.S.
Interior Department has approved 33 utility-scale wind, solar
and geothermal projects since 2009 that will total more than
10,000 megawatts of capacity.  To contact the reporter on this story:
