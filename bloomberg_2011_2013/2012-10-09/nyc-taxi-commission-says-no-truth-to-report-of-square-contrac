Shares of  VeriFone Systems Inc. (PAY)  pared
losses after the  New York City  Taxi Commission refuted a report
that rival payments company Square Inc. was near a deal to put
its credit-card reader in more city cabs.  VeriFone lost less than 1 percent to close at $30.58,
reversing an earlier retreat of as much as 8.5 percent after the
New York Post  reported  that the city was close to completing a
deal to outfit 1,000 taxis with Square’s readers, citing
researcher PrivCo.  “There is no truth whatsoever to PrivCo’s reported
statements regarding a deal in the works between Square and the
TLC,” Allan Fromberg, a spokesman for New York City’s Taxi and
Limousine Commission, said in an e-mailed statement.  VeriFone, the largest maker of credit-card terminals,
competes with Square in the fast-growing market for payments
made via smartphones and tablets. Both companies have
accessories and software that let merchants -- including cab
drivers -- accept credit and debit card payments. VeriFone makes
readers that are used to process transactions in about half of
New York City’s cabs, Fromberg said.  “VeriFone serves about 35,000 taxis in the U.S. and, to be
clear, the article says Square will roll out 1,000 taxis and is
worth about $15 million in revenue,”  John Williams , an analyst
at UBS Securities LLC, wrote in a research report today. A share
loss of that size “is manageable given VeriFone’s $20 million
quarterly taxi revenue run rate.”  Victoria Brown, a spokeswoman for  San Jose , California-
based VeriFone, declined to comment. Aaron Zamost, a spokesman
for San Francisco-based Square, said in an e-mailed statement
that PrivCo’s statements on a Square deal “have no basis in
fact.”  Contracts Expiring  Creative Mobile Technologies LLC and VeriFone have city
contracts to install readers in cabs, and they evenly split the
market, Fromberg said. Those contracts expire in February, and
regulations will be issued by the end of the year with
requirements companies must meet to be considered for the
contract in the future, he said.  Square has a pilot program with the city to outfit 12 taxis
with Apple Inc.’s iPads and technology that enables the devices
to read cards, Fromberg said. There is no pending contract for
this, he said. The taxi commission has issued a request for
proposals for an application that would let riders pay using a
smartphone, Fromberg said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
