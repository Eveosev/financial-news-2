U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner and Indian Finance Minister Palaniappan Chidambaram
discussed lowering trade barriers and extending ways to expand
capital markets, while working toward steering the global
economy out of “uncertainties.”  “We discussed ways we can further lower barriers to trade
and investment to facilitate stronger growth and job creation,”
according to a joint statement from the two officials after
their meeting today in New Delhi. “We agreed to deepen our
cooperation bilaterally and in multilateral fora, including the
G-20 to contribute towards steering the global economy out of
uncertainties and achieve strong, sustainable, and balanced
growth going forward.”  Geithner’s visit for the annual meeting of the U.S.-India
Economic and Financial Partnership follows a recent Indian
policy revamp to open up to more foreign investment and revive
expansion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
