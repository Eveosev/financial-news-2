An Azeri court today sentenced 22
people to prison terms over charges of spying for neighboring
Iran.  The Baku Serious Crimes Court found the Azeri nationals
guilty of treason and collaborating with Iran’s Revolutionary
Guards Corps, Judge Alovsat Abbasov said by phone from the Azeri
capital. They received prison sentences ranging from 10 years to
15 years, he said.  The energy-rich Caspian nation’s ties to  Israel  and the
U.S. have caused tension with Iran. Azerbaijan said in March it
arrested members of an armed group that collected intelligence
about foreign embassies and companies, including  BP Plc (BP/) , for the
Revolutionary Guard.  Azerbaijan has a 756 kilometer (470 mile) border with Iran
and most of its population shares Iran’s Shiite Muslim religion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
