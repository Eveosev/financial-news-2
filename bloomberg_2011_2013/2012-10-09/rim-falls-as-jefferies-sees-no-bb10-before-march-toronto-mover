Research In Motion (RIMM)  Ltd. fell the most
in about two weeks after Jefferies & Co. said the company
probably won’t release BlackBerry 10 smartphones until March,
missing the fiscal fourth quarter.  That delay would push back the timing of any BB10 licensing
deals with other companies until after the software’s release,
 Peter Misek , a Jefferies analyst, said in a research note today.
Waterloo, Ontario-based RIM’s fiscal year ends Feb. 28.  RIM fell 5.3 percent to $7.80 at the close in  New York , the
biggest decline since Sept. 21. The shares have dropped 46
percent this year.  RIM is counting on BB10 to revive sales growth and stop
market share losses to Apple Inc.’s iPhone and devices running
Google Inc.’s Android operating system. While RIM Chief
Marketing Officer Frank Boulben said in July that BB10 would
debut in some markets in January, the company has since stuck to
the timing of a release in the first calendar quarter of 2013.  “The business uncertainty means parties are unlikely to
acquire or license from RIM until BB10 launches,” Misek said.
He has the equivalent of a sell rating on the stock.  Chief Executive Officer Thorsten Heins reiterated the
first-quarter timing on a conference call with analysts last
month and said that he’s met with CEOs at various organizations
over the past several months to discuss software licensing and
partnerships.  Nick Manning, a RIM spokesman, said the company is on
target to start delivering BB10 phones in the first calendar
quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
