Jefferies Group Inc. (JEF) , the New York-
based investment bank, had a trading loss on one of 65 days in
the fiscal third quarter and reduced its net short position on
five risky European nations.  The firm generated daily net trading revenue exceeding $10
million on two days during the three-month period ended Aug. 31,
according to a regulatory filing today. The loss was less than
$2 million, the filing shows.  Average daily value-at-risk, a measure of how much the
company estimates it could lose in the  securities market  in a
single day, increased to $10.53 million from $8.83 million in
the second quarter, mainly because of an investment in  Knight
Capital Group Inc. (KCG) , Jefferies said. Excluding that investment,
average VaR fell to $8.35 million, it said.  Jefferiesâ€™s net exposure to sovereign issuers,
corporations, financial institutions and structured products in
Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain was negative $20.4
million at the end of August, the filing shows. That figure
decreased from a  net short  of $125.4 million on May 31.  To contact the reporter on this story:
