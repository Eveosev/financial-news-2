Kansas City  has broken ground on
three wastewater treatment facilities, part of $96 million in
infrastructure upgrades to meet state and federal requirements
for sewage disinfection, the Kansas City Star said.  The paper said the $48 million project at the Blue River
wastewater treatment plant in east Kansas City is the cityâ€™s
largest of six planned sewage initiatives. The upgrades follow a
2010 agreement with the Environmental Protection Agency and U.S.
 Justice Department  to fix sewer problems stemming from
allegations that Kansas City had polluted waterways.  The project, expected to be completed by the fall of 2013,
was backed by bonds approved by voters in August.  To contact the reporter on this story:
