What's not to be envied about the life of the Indian businessman Robert Vadra, a self-made man if ever there was one? Now 43, Vadra emerged from relative insignificance to a position of tremendous wealth, power and influence, especially in the Indian capital, New Delhi, where his name can move mountains. Of course, it helps that Vadra is married to Priyanka Gandhi, the daughter of former Prime Minister  Rajiv Gandhi  and granddaughter of former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. And his mother-in-law is  Sonia Gandhi , the president of the Congress Party, the most powerful woman in the land. Vadra could, b y his own candid admission , become a member of Parliament any time he liked, but he has chosen to stay out of public life and chart his own path in "business" (an impressive but sometimes vague word covering a gamut of activities). For years now, there has been talk about the vast tracts of real estate that Vadra has been buying in Faridabad, a suburb of Delhi. Everyone, whether bureaucrats, businessmen or editors, would like to be in his good books. Vadra's range of achievements and privileges is impressive. He is thought of more highly than any other citizen by the government, which has  granted him exemption  from security checks at all Indian airports, on par with the  Dalai Lama . Last year, the Hindustan Times ran a contest to decide the most stylish man in Delhi. The jury went for someone else, but Vadra won  "the People's Choice Awards." Why then, just when everything was going so swimmingly for Vadra, did some people have to come along and play party-pooper? Last week, Arvind Kejriwal and Shanti Bhushan, two leading lights of the group  India Against Corruption , which has for the last two years organized a mass movement against graft and hopes soon to become a political party,  held a news conference . There, they handed out details of Vadra's recent enormous surge of wealth on the back of sweetheart loans handed out to him by  DLF  Ltd.,  India 's biggest developer.  The press release  was titled "Robert Vadra acquires properties worth hundreds of crores from nothing. What is the source of these funds?" It provided evidence to show that Vadra's wealth had multiplied almost 600-fold in a few years, from 50 lakh rupees (about $100,000) to 300 crore (about $57 million) and alleged that this was because he had been sold prime land at knockdown prices by DLF. It  asked : Both DLF and Vadra moved swiftly to rubbish the allegations.  DLF said , “We would like to state that the business relationship of DLF with Mr. Vadra or his companies has been in his capacity as an individual entrepreneur, on a completely transparent and at an arm’s length basis.” It said that the figure of 65 crore mentioned by IAC was an interest-free "business advance," a claim met  with considerable skepticism  by auditors, particularly since the company's debt burden stands at more than 200 billion rupees. DLF's shares  fell by more than 7 percent on Oct. 8 , the first trading day after the controversy erupted. Vadra, meanwhile,  said  the charges leveled against him by Kejriwal and Bhushan were an attempt to "malign my family in order to gain cheap publicity for themselves and for the launch of their political party." He struck a more belligerent note on his Facebook page, calling his detractors  "Mango people in banana republic"  (sic). The first fruit metaphor was a labored pun on the word "aam," which means both "common" and "mango" in Hindi, and is used often by India Against Corruption when it claims to represent the "aam aadmi," or common man. As for " banana republic ," people were quick to point out that the health of the republic lay in good measure in the hands of Vadra's own family by marriage. Meanwhile, the best journalistic investigation of the claims made by Kejriwal and Bhushan was offered by Shalini Singh in the Hindu. In a piece called  "Behind Robert Vadra's fortune, a maze of questions,"  Singh wrote: As R. Sukumar remarked  in an editorial on Livemint  asking both Vadra and DLF to make better clarifications about their partnership, " The Hindu’s  description makes the business model of Vadra’s companies sound like a perpetual motion machine, with assets swelling despite no increase in business activity." Meanwhile, the Economic Times  reported : That would be a start, as the Congress Party doesn't seem to think the matter to be of great concern, and capitalism needs to make everyone play by the same rules if it is not to undermine its own moral claims. Meanwhile, it has become clear to many Indian citizens that their politicians have discovered that, in a liberalizing and expanding economy, there's no faster way to generate wealth than by leveraging both connections and concessions in getting into real-estate investments. (A  real-estate scandal in Mumbai  recently led to the unseating of the chief minister of Maharashtra.) In a piece on the subject on the website Firstpost,  Abhay Vaidya wrote : Depressing news, to be sure, but all the more reason why it should be brought out into the open. Now that someone has done the dangerous work of speaking out, though, many more details are sure to be revealed in the coming weeks about the business acumen -- or funding network -- of India's first son-in-law.
