Mid-sized U.S. banks can wait until
next September to begin self-administered stress tests under
regulators’ rules approved today that call for public
disclosures of some of the findings.  The  Office of the Comptroller of the Currency ,  Federal
Deposit Insurance Corp.  and the  Federal Reserve  established
guidelines for tests that lawmakers included in the Dodd-Frank
Act as a way for banks with more than $10 billion in assets to
show they can withstand an economic crisis. Banks with more than
$50 billion in assets must start the tests this year, and those
between $10 billion and $50 billion get an extra year.  “I believe the implementation timeline in the final rule
strikes the right balance,” Comptroller of the Currency  Thomas Curry  said at today’s FDIC meeting, adding that the agencies
will address another concern from banks -- that regulators
coordinate their approaches to the tests. “As supervisors we
should avoid pushing and pulling companies in different
directions,” Curry said.  FDIC statistics show 108 U.S.-regulated banks meet the size
threshold for participation in the internal tests overseen by
the FDIC, OCC and the Fed. The capital-adequacy testing, using
hypothetical conditions posed by the regulators, require large
banks such as New York-based  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  and  Charlotte ,
North Carolina-based  Bank of America  Corp. to report results to
the regulators early next year, followed by a publicly released
summary.  Smaller Banks  Smaller institutions, such as  Portland , Oregon-based
regional lender  Umpqua Holding Corp. (UMPQ) , will use data through
Sept. 30, 2013 to report results the following year. They won’t
start releasing public summaries until June 30, 2015.  “Stress testing is a key tool to ensure that financial
companies have enough capital to weather a severe economic
downturn without posing a risk to their communities, other
financial institutions, or to the general economy,” Fed
Governor Daniel K. Tarullo said in a statement today.  The self-administered tests are in addition to those given
to the 19 largest U.S. bank holding companies by the Fed, which
gave passing marks to 15 in March.  Because each of the regulators has distinct jurisdictions,
there will be cases in which the largest banks are subjected to
tests from more than one agency. A big  bank holding company 
among those already tested annually by the Fed will also have to
administer the new Fed self-tests, as well as tests from the
other agencies in their subsidiaries -- the OCC’s tests for
national banks and the FDIC’s for state banks that aren’t Fed
members.  New Schedule  Banks with more than $50 billion in assets will receive
stress scenarios from regulators next month, and based on their
Sept. 30 data will analyze how they fared under each scenario.
The schedule will remain in place in subsequent years, with
stress scenarios released for all affected banks each November.  FDIC board member Jeremiah Norton cautioned investors
against relying too heavily on  stress-test  results.  “I hope that we don’t send the signal that because a firm
passes the stress test that investors -- again, mainly creditors
and counterparties but equity holders as well -- don’t need to
worry,” Norton said. “The government doesn’t always know
what’s going to happen, doesn’t have the crystal ball that looks
perfectly into the future.”  Nonbank financial firms designated by the Financial
Stability Oversight Council as systemically important will also
have to conduct stress tests, according to the Fed’s rule.  Deposit Insurance  The FDIC also voted today to finalize a rule it proposed in
March to change how banks evaluate assets to determine their
payments to the deposit insurance fund. In the rule, firms above
the $10 billion threshold that hold riskier assets will shoulder
more of the burden of protecting depositors while leaving
unchanged the total collected by the FDIC.  The agency also issued an update on the insurance fund,
saying its projections for how much bank failures will cost the
fund from 2012 through 2016 have dropped by $2 billion to an
estimated $10 billion. The fund will gain about $12.4 billion
this year from assessments on banks.  “The rapid recapitalization of the Deposit Insurance Fund
reflects an industry that is stronger today than at any point in
the last four years,” said  James Chessen , chief economist at
the  American Bankers Association  in  Washington , in a statement.
“The banking industry is returning to profitability and
failures continue to decline sharply. As a result, the Deposit
Insurance Fund is growing faster than expected and will have the
resources to weather any contingency that could arise.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
