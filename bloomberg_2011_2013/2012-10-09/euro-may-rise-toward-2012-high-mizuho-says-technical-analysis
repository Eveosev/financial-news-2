The euro may rise to around the
highest level for this year, Mizuho Securities Co. said, citing
trading patterns.  Losses in the 17-nation euro from the Sept. 17 high of
$1.3172 have been curbed as the currency held above the 38.2
percent Fibonacci retracement level of its July-to-September
gains, according to Kengo Suzuki, a currency strategist in Tokyo
at the unit of  Mizuho Financial Group Inc. (8411) ,  Japan ’s third-
largest bank by market value.  “The euro’s short-term upward trend hasn’t collapsed
yet,” said Suzuki. “If it breaks above $1.32 and confirms its
bullish trend, it may strengthen, targeting around its February
high in the next few weeks.”  The shared currency traded at $1.2984 as of 9:52 a.m. in
Tokyo from $1.2968 at the close yesterday in New York. The
year’s high is $1.3487 reached on Feb. 24, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Fibonacci analysis is based on the theory that prices rise
or fall by certain percentages after reaching a high or low. A
break above resistance, or below support, indicates it may move
to the next level. Support refers to an areas where buy orders
may clustered. Resistance is where there may be orders to sell.  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
