Global oil markets are “sufficiently
supplied” and excessively high prices are threatening to derail
the global economy, the International Energy Agency said.  While “the market is sufficiently supplied as far as crude
goes” there are “some problems” with oil product markets in
 Europe  and the U.S. because of refinery closures, Maria van der Hoeven, executive director of the IEA, said at a press
conference in London today. Current “prices are far too high
for the global economic recovery,” Fatih Birol, the agency’s
chief economist, said at the conference.  The agency, whose members hold strategic oil reserves to be
used in a supply crisis, remains ready to act if necessary, van
der Hoeven and Birol said at the conference, where the agency
launched a new study on  Iraq ’s energy potential.  Brent crude oil futures traded near $113 a barrel today on
the ICE Futures Europe exchange in London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
