The zloty weakened for the first time
in three days after the  International Monetary Fund  cut Polish
 economic growth  forecast to the slowest pace since 2009.  The zloty depreciated 0.1 percent to 4.0708 per euro as of
11:55 a.m. in Warsaw, the second-steepest decline among more
than 20 emerging-market currencies tracked by Bloomberg. The
yield on five-year notes rose two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 4.20 percent.  Expansion in Poland, the European Union’s largest eastern
economy, will decelerate to 2.4 percent this year, and 2.1
percent in 2013, from 4.3 percent in 2011, the IMF said in its
World Economic Outlook late yesterday. That bucks the trend for
emerging European economies that will expand at a faster pace
next year, driven by a recovery in the crisis-hit euro area.  “The zloty may retreat somewhat,”  Grzegorz Maliszewski ,
chief economist at  Bank Millennium SA (MIL)  in Warsaw, wrote in e-
mailed report. “The IMF cutting growth forecast is consistent
with weaker currency.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
