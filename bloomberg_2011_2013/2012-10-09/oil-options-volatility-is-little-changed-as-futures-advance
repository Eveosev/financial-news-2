Crude oil options volatility was
little changed as underlying futures jumped 3.4 percent.  Implied volatility for options expiring in November, a
measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge of
options prices, was 31.14 percent as of 3:57 p.m. in  New York ,
down from 31.25 percent yesterday.  Volatility for options expiring in December was 31.49
percent, down from 31.53 percent yesterday.  November-delivery crude oil rose $3.06 to $92.39 a barrel
on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , the highest settlement
since Oct. 1. Prices have gained 20 cents this month, following
an 8.5 percent advance in the third quarter. December-delivery
crude rose $3.05 to $92.78 a barrel.  The most active options in electronic trading today were
November $100 calls, or bets that prices will rise, which gained
12 cents to 17 cents a barrel at 4:11 p.m. with 2,456 lots
trading. November $85 puts were the second-most active, with
2,132 lots exchanged as they fell 31 cents to 13 cents a barrel.  Calls accounted for 62 percent of the 56,270 contracts in
electronic trading. One contract covers 1,000 barrels of oil.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on open-
outcry volume, where the bulk of options activity occurs.  In the previous session, calls made up 57 percent of the
73,286 contracts traded.  December $120 calls were the most actively traded options
with 5,208 lots changing hands. They fell 1 cent to 10 cents a
barrel. December $100 calls declined 7 cents to 65 cents on
volume of 4,240 lots.  Open interest was highest for December $120 calls with
59,470 contracts. Next were December $80 puts with 48,941 lots
and December $125 calls with 45,076.  To contact the reporter on this story:
