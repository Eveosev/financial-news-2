Estonia has applied to join the
European Union countries seeking cooperation on introducing the
financial transaction tax, Prime Minister Andrus Ansip said in a
speech in parliament today.  The government had decided on Sept. 27 to participate in
the group of countries looking for ways to implement the
financial transaction tax “to be able to affect the
decisions,” Ansip said. “The decision on whether Estonia will
actually introduce such a tax still lies ahead,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
