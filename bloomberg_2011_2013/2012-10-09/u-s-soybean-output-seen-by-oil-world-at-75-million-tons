U.S. soybean production is estimated
to fall to 75 million metric tons this year from 84.2 million
tons in 2011, better than expected by the government, industry
researcher Oil World said.  The outlook for U.S. soybeans has improved, and there’s
“general consensus” that the U.S. Department of Agriculture
forecast of 71.7 million tons is “significantly too low,” the
Hamburg-based researcher wrote in an e-mailed report today.  Soybean futures traded in  Chicago  declined 8.9 percent in
September after climbing 7 percent in July, on speculation
damage caused by the worst U.S. drought in more than 50 years
was less severe than suggested by USDA estimates.  “There are still many reports of surprisingly high yields
despite this summer’s historic drought,” Oil World said. “With
larger carry-in stocks and a higher than expected crop, U.S.
soybean supplies in 2012-13 will be less tight than expected.”  U.S. soybean yields are estimated to drop to 2.48 tons per
hectare, or 37 bushels per acre, according to Oil World. That
compares with 2.82 tons per hectare in 2011, it wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
