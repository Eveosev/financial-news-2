Thailand ’s government bonds rose
after the International Monetary Fund cut its global growth
forecast, citing Europe’s worsening debt crisis and weaker U.S.
expansion. The baht strengthened.  The world economy will grow 3.3 percent this year, the
slowest since the 2009 recession, compared with a July
prediction of 3.5 percent, the Washington-based lender said
today. International investors  purchased  $455 million more local
sovereign notes than they sold this month through yesterday,
according to data from the Thai Bond Market Association.  “There’s good appetite for assets in Asia where the growth
is relatively stronger than developed nations, providing the
room for currencies to gain,” said Tohru Nishihama, an
economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute Inc. in  Tokyo .
“But investors don’t want to take risks aggressively and the
funds are flowing more to bonds rather than stocks, supporting
the regional debt markets.”  The yield on the 3.25 percent notes due June 2017 dropped
two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 3.28 percent as
of 8:32 a.m. in Bangkok, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  The baht climbed 0.1 percent to 30.64 per dollar, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. One-month implied volatility, a
measure of exchange-rate swings used to price options, was
unchanged at 4.27 percent.  Asia’s developing economies will expand 6.7 percent this
year, compared with a July estimate of 7.1 percent, according to
the IMF. The  Asian Development Bank  and the  World Bank  also
lowered their growth estimates for the region this month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
