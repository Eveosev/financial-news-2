Japan will help  Indonesia  build 410

including roads, railways, harbors, airports and power plants,
in Jakarta by 2020.  The two governments approved a master plan for the
development of 45 projects today in  Tokyo , they said in a joint
statement. Construction of 18 priority projects from the total
