Cooking-oil imports by India, the
world’s largest consumer after  China , probably jumped for a
second month in September as the biggest monthly slump in  palm
oil  prices in four years spurred demand from refiners.  Purchases rose 4 percent to 950,000 metric tons last month
from 912,341 tons a year earlier, according to the median
estimate in a Bloomberg survey of five processors and brokers.
Imports of crude and refined palm oils increased 8 percent to
750,000 tons from 692,200 tons, the survey showed. The  Solvent
Extractors’ Association of India  will publish data on Oct. 15.  Palm oil has slumped 19 percent since the end of August as
stockpiles climbed to record levels in Indonesia and  Malaysia ,
the biggest producers, and a global economic slowdown pared
demand from China to  Europe . Rising Indian imports may help trim
inventories in  Asia  amid a seasonal increase in production.  “The price-fall over the last month and rupee appreciation
helped boost imports during the lean supply period,” said
Sandeep Bajoria, chief executive officer of Mumbai-based broker
Sunvin Group. “A lot of cargoes are due in October as well
because of lower prices.”  Palm oil for delivery in December rose 0.8 percent to 2,457
ringgit ($799) a ton on the Malaysia Derivatives Exchange today.
Futures fell 15.7 percent in September, the most since October
2008. India’s rupee gained 5.1 percent in September, the biggest
rise since January, lowering costs for commodities priced in
dollars.  Discount Widens  Palm oil comprises almost 80 percent of India’s cooking-oil
imports. The country buys palm oil from Indonesia and Malaysia,
and  soybean oil  from Brazil and  Argentina .  The slump in palm oil prices widened it’s discount to
soybean oil, boosting demand, said Pradip Desai, managing
director of Palmtrade Services Pvt., a Mumbai-based broker.  Soybean oil’s premium over the tropical oil reached $378.98
a ton on Oct. 2, the most since September 2008, and was at
$333.91 today. Soybean oil and palm oil are used in foods and
fuels.  “The discount in prices has given importers some incentive
to buy,”  Desai said. “Imports have ballooned in September as
the shortfall was not being met by the domestic crop, but from
October there will be some replenishment of supplies from the
new crop harvest.”  Record Imports  Imports are set to surpass 10 million tons for the first
time after dry weather damaged  India ’s oilseed crops and as
demand climbs, GG Patel & Nikhil Research Co. Managing Partner
Govindlal G. Patel said last month. Purchases may gain 5.4
percent to 10.3 million tons in the year starting Nov. 1 from
about 9.78 million tons this year, said Patel, who’s traded
cooking oils for more than three decades.  India’s monsoon-sown oilseed output may fall to 13.9
million tons from 14.6 million tons a year earlier, while
consumption will increase 4 percent to 17.1 million tons in
2012-2013, he said. Shipments in the nine months through August
jumped 19 percent to 8.16 million tons, according to the
extractors’ association. India bought 8.7 million tons in
2010-2011.  Crude  soybean-oil  imports probably fell to 70,000 tons in
September from 120,488 tons a year earlier, while sunflower-oil
purchases may have climbed to 80,000 tons from 58,686 tons,
three of the respondents from the survey said. Stockpiles of all
vegetable oils at Indian ports may be 500,000 tons, said Atul Chaturvedi, chief executive officer of Adani Wilmar Ltd.  To contact the reporter on this story:
