Tunisia’s Women and Family Affairs
Ministry said it has sued a children’s magazine after it
published a story detailing how to make Molotov cocktails.  The Tunis-based ministry said in a statement today that the
article, published in the September edition of “Rainbow,”
posed a threat to the lives of youngsters and encouraged acts of
vandalism or terrorism.  “I take full responsibility for the article’s
publication,” Editor-in-Chief Mongi Chebbi said in a phone
interview, while declining to elaborate further.  To contact the reporter on this story:
