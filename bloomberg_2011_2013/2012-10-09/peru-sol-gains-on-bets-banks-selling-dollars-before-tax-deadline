Peru ’s sol advanced on speculation
banks are selling dollars to increase holdings of the local
currency before taxes come due.  The sol appreciated 0.1 percent to 2.5870 per  U.S. dollar 
at today’s close, according to Deutsche Bank AG’s local unit.
That is the strongest level on a closing basis since 1996,  data 
from Peru’s financial regulator show.  Local banks may be buying soles on the expectation that the
monthly period for company tax payments that begins Oct. 12 will
cause the dollar to weaken further, said Antonio Diaz, a trader
at Banco Internacional del Peru in  Lima .  “Banks may be selling dollars in advance” to obtain soles
“a bit more cheaply,” Diaz said.  The central bank bought relatively small amounts of dollars
in the  spot market  last week, which allowed the sol to gain 0.3
percent and encouraged speculation policy makers are tolerating
greater appreciation in the currency, he said.  The central bank bought $40 million today after purchasing
$20 million a day from Oct. 3 through Oct. 5. Yesterday was a
public holiday in Peru.  The yield on the nation’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol-
denominated bond due August 2020 was little changed at 4.25
percent, according to prices compiled by Bloomberg. The price
dropped 0.03 centimos to 123.58 centimos per sol.  To contact the reporter on this story:
