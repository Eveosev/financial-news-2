The ringgit rebounded from its
biggest loss in four months on optimism Chinese growth will
recover, brightening the outlook for Malaysian exports.  The  International Monetary Fund  predicted today Asia’s
largest economy will expand 8.2 percent in 2013, compared with
7.8 percent this year, while Malaysia’s gross domestic product
will increase 4.7 percent from 4.4 percent. A purchasing
managers’ index for services in China released yesterday by HSBC
Holdings Plc and  Markit Economics  indicated a preliminary
reading of 54.3 in September, compared with 52 the month before.
China was Malaysia’s second-biggest export market in August.  “The better Chinese data is giving some support to Asian
currencies including the ringgit,” said Azmi Shukri Rahman, a
foreign-exchange trader at CIMB Investment Bank Bhd. in  Kuala
Lumpur .  The ringgit advanced 0.4 percent to 3.0642 per dollar as of
9:31 a.m. in Kuala Lumpur, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The currency dropped 0.8 percent yesterday, the most
since June 1. The ringgit is unlikely to strengthen beyond 3.06
per dollar, Azmi Shukri said. One-month implied volatility, a
measure of exchange-rate swings used to price options, climbed
two basis points to 7.02 percent.  Industrial production  in  Malaysia  fell 2 percent in August
from a year earlier after increasing 1.4 percent in July,
according to the median estimate of 18 economists in a Bloomberg
News survey before official data due tomorrow.  Government bonds  declined. The yield on the 3.314 percent
notes due October 2017 rose one basis point, or 0.0 percentage
point, to 3.30 percent, according to Bursa Malaysia. The
treasury will auction 2.5 billion ringgit ($816 million) of
Shariah-compliant securities maturing in August 2017 on Oct. 12,
the central bank said on its website yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
