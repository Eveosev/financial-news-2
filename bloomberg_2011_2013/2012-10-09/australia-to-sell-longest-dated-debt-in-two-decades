(Corrects to show that sale would be longest-dated bonds
in three decades in headline, first paragraph of story initially
published on Oct. 9.)  Australia  plans to sell 16 1/2-year
debt tomorrow, the longest-maturity bonds on record in
government data stretching back three decades.  The 3.25 percent April 2029 issue is expected to yield
around 17 to 20 basis points more than the April 2027 security,
currently Australia’s longest-dated note, according to an e-
mailed statement from the Australian Office of Financial
Management. The funding arm said the syndicated issue will be of
benchmark size, without providing further details.  “It will be a welcome addition to the existing bond
lines,” said Su-Lin Ong, Sydney-based head of Australian
economic and fixed-income strategy at  RBC Capital Markets , which
is a joint lead manager on the transaction. “It’s often been
asked why Australia doesn’t have a true longer-dated bond. It’s
broadly consistent with general demand for Australian fixed
income.”  The new bond would be the longest maturity sold by the
Australian government since at least 1982, AOFM data show. The
last time the country extended its yield curve was in October
2011, when it sold $A3.25 billion ($3.3 billion) in 15 1/2-year
securities. Demand for Australian debt, the highest-yielding
sovereign AAA securities, helped drive down yields to records
this year, with the benchmark 10-year note touching 2.698
percent in June.  The  10-year rate  was at 3.09 percent as of 12:12 p.m. in
Sydney, while the 2027 note yielded 3.42 percent.  ‘Rather Cheap’  The proposed pricing for the 2029 bond “looks rather
cheap,” according to a client note from  Commonwealth Bank of
Australia (CBA) ’s Philip Brown, Adam Donaldson and Alex Stanley. “We
strongly suspect the bond will price within the nominated range.
But we think the bond will offer value when it does price.
Further, we expect the bond to slowly settle and tighten.”  Australia has sold A$13 billion of the A$35 billion in
Treasury bonds it plans to offer in the 2012-2013 financial
year, according to AOFM data. Issuance will shrink this year as
the government seeks to end four years of budget deficits.  After accounting for maturities of A$26 billion, net
issuance for the current financial year is expected to $9
billion, government data show. The net figure for 2011-12 was
A$44 billion, with gross issuance of A$58.2 billion.  Citigroup Inc., UBS AG and Royal Bank of Canada’s RBC
Capital Markets unit are joint lead managers for the 2027 issue,
while Barclays Plc, Deutsche Bank AG and  Westpac Banking Corp. (WBC) 
are co-managers, according to the AOFM.  Following the syndicated issue, Australia won’t sell any
more of the 2029 bond line until February, the funding arm said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
