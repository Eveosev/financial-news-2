Houston Texans linebacker Brian Cushing is out for the remainder of the National Football League
season after tearing a ligament in his knee.  Cushing, 25, tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his
left knee two nights ago in the Texans’ 23-17 win against the
 New York  Jets, Houston coach  Gary Kubiak  said at a news
conference.  “We lost him for the year and he’s going to have surgery
in two or three weeks when the swelling goes down,” Kubiak said
yesterday. “It’s a big blow for our team.”  Cushing, who leads the Texans with 29 tackles this season,
was injured with about 10 minutes remaining in the second
quarter when he was cut-blocked by Jets guard Matt Slauson. Cut
blocks, in which a blocker dives at the legs of a defender, are
legal unless the blocker is headed back toward his own goal line,
Kubiak said. He declined to comment on whether Slauson’s block
was illegal, saying it was “in the league’s hands.”  “When I went on the field after he got hit he knew he was
in pretty good pain,” said Kubiak, who had yet to speak to
Cushing after the diagnosis. “Players tend to know when
something’s not right.”  The Texans, who with the  Atlanta Falcons  are the only 5-0
teams in the NFL, next host the  Green Bay Packers  on Oct. 14.  To contact the reporter on this story:
