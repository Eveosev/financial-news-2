Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT)  is testing same-
day delivery of general merchandise ordered online as it seeks
to bolster its e-commerce business ahead of the  holiday shopping
season .  The retailer began testing the Wal-Mart To Go delivery
service in Minneapolis, Northern Virginia and Philadelphia this
month, according to an e-mailed statement today. Wal-Mart, the
world’s largest retailer, plans to add the service, which costs
$10, in San Jose, California and San Francisco by early
November.  The move is Wal-Mart’s latest attempt to leverage its
brick-and-mortar stores to boost online sales amid competition
from  Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) , the world’s biggest online retailer. In
2010, Wal-Mart debuted Site to Store, allowing shoppers to order
goods online and pick them up in person and the chain  already
delivers groceries ordered on the Web in San Francisco and San
Jose.  The new service “is a huge opportunity for us and we
believe that it is uniquely Wal-Mart,”  Bill Simon , chief
executive officer of Wal-Mart U.S., said at a conference Sept.
5.  Under the program, customers can order merchandise such as
toys, electronics and sporting goods online before noon and
choose a 4-hour window from 4 p.m. onward for delivery. There’s
no minimum-purchase requirement, the Bentonville, Arkansas-based
company said.  Local stores will supply the products, which will be
delivered by  United Parcel Service Inc. (UPS) , except in San Jose and
San Francisco, which has the existing grocery-delivery service.
There is no end-date set for the program, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
