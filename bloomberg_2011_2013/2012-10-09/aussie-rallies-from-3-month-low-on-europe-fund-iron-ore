The Australian dollar rallied from a
three-month low reached yesterday after finance ministers in
 Europe  declared the region’s permanent aid fund operational and
gains in commodity prices boosted demand for the currency.  The so-called Aussie climbed versus its U.S. counterpart
following a slide last week that was the biggest in five months,
after finance ministers from the euro area’s 17 nations set up a
full-time fund to aid the region’s debt-ridden countries. Prices
for  iron ore , Australia’s key export, rose yesterday to the
highest in more than a month. Demand for New Zealand’s dollar
was tempered after a report today showed charge-card spending
fell more than economists forecast.  “There’s a lack of bad macroeconomic news out there to
push the Aussie lower,” said  Andrew Salter , a strategist in
Sydney at  Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. (ANZ)  “Anything
that takes a euro catastrophe out of the equation is positive
for risk sentiment.” Gains in iron prices have also underpinned
the Aussie, he said.  The Australian dollar added 0.4 percent to $1.0231 at 4:40
p.m. in Sydney after touching $1.0149 yesterday, the lowest
since July 13. The Aussie fell 1.8 percent in the week through
Oct. 5, the biggest drop since the period ended May 4. It
climbed 0.5 percent to 80.19 yen today.  New Zealand ’s currency, nicknamed the kiwi, bought 82.26
U.S. cents from 81.93 yesterday. It rose 0.5 percent to 64.47
yen.  Iron Ore  Physical iron ore  with 62 percent content at the Chinese
port of Tianjin jumped 6 percent yesterday to $110.40 a ton, the
highest close since Aug. 16, according to The Steel Index  Ltd.
Markets in  China , Australia’s biggest trading partner, reopened
yesterday after national holidays last week.  Euro-area finance ministers yesterday declared the 500
billion-euro ($649 billion) European Stability Mechanism
operational, while saying that  Spain , its biggest potential
near-term customer, isn’t on the verge of tapping it. Ministers
from all 27 nations in the European Union will convene in
Luxembourg today.  The Aussie has weakened 3.8 percent in the past three
months, the worst performance after the  U.S. dollar  among the 10
developed-nation currencies tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-
Weighted Indexes. The kiwi lost 0.5 percent.  Forecasts Cut  Gains in the South Pacific currencies were tempered after
the  International Monetary Fund  cut its global growth forecasts.
The world economy will grow 3.3 percent this year, the slowest
since the 2009 recession, and 3.6 percent next year, the IMF
said today. That compares with July predictions of 3.5 percent
in 2012 and 3.9 percent in 2013.  A gauge of Australian  business confidence  rose to zero last
month from minus 3 in August, according to results released
today of a National Australia Bank Ltd. survey of more than 400
companies taken Sept. 18 to Oct. 1.  Australia  plans to sell 16 1/2-year debt tomorrow, the
longest-maturity bonds on record in government data stretching
back two decades. The nation’s 10-year yield was at 3.07 percent
from 3.08 percent yesterday.  In New Zealand, the  value of transactions  on electronic
cards fell 0.6 percent in September from the previous month,
when it rose a revised 2.7 percent, the statistics bureau said
today in Wellington. The median estimate of economists was a 0.3
percent decline in spending, according to a Bloomberg News
survey before the data were released.  New Zealand’s two-year swap rate, a fixed payment made to
receive floating rates, was little changed at 2.635 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
