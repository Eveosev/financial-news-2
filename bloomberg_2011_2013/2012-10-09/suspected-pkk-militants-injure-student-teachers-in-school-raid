A group of suspected PKK militants
raided a school in Turkey’s southeast, injuring a student and
two teachers in a firebomb and bomb attack today, Anatolia news
agency reported.  Masked militants tossed a homemade bomb as well as a
Molotov cocktail inside the Sehitlik High School in Diyarbakir,
the largest city in the country’s Kurdish-dominated southeast,
state-run Anatolia said.  The attack comes on the anniversary of the ousting of the
imprisoned chief of the Kurdistan Workers’ Party or PKK,
 Abdullah Ocalan , from his longtime home in Damascus on Oct. 9,
1998, by  Syria  after Turkey threatened Damascus with war for
harboring him. Ocalan, who was captured in  Kenya  in February
1999, is serving a life sentence on an island near Istanbul.  PKK militants have escalated their attacks in a war for
autonomy in the southeast. The conflict has left nearly 40,000
people dead since 1984.  To contact the reporter on this story:
