A replica of  Brazil ’s 2014 soccer
World Cup mascot, a native armadillo made of plastic, was
stabbed at dawn today in downtown Brasilia, the government’s
news agency reported.  For security reasons the 7-meter (23-foot) tall, damaged
figure, was removed and police have no suspects, the agency
said. Last week another model of the mascot was destroyed during
street protests in the southern city of  Porto Alegre .  The world soccer governing body FIFA announced the three-
banded Armadillo, an endangered species native to Brazil’s
central and northeastern savannas, as the official mascot in
September.  Unlike the smiling, colored mascot holding a soccer ball in
its hand, the real-life version is a brown, rodent-like creature
capable of rolling into a ball within its shell.  To contact the reporter on this story:
