SunPower Corp. (SPWR) , the solar-panel
manufacturer majority-owned by  Total SA (FP) , bought a minority stake
in the Australian renewable-energy company Diamond Energy Pty.  SunPower acquired 42 percent of the closely held company
and has the option of increasing its ownership, the San Jose,
California-based company said today in a statement. Terms
weren’t disclosed.  SunPower is seeking to diversify its business after  prices 
for solar panels fell 61 percent since the beginning of 2011.
The company began offering solar leases for residential rooftop
systems last year and said in August the business may account
for 25 percent of sales by mid-2013. The deal with Diamond
Energy is another way for SunPower to get closer to end
customers, according to Chief Executive Officer  Tom Werner .  “We look forward to this new venture and expect it to
serve as a model for SunPower’s continuing evolution into a
complete energy solutions provider,” Werner said in the
statement.  Diamond Energy, based in Melbourne, Australia, owns two
biogas plants and develops other renewable-energy generating
assets, including wind and solar farms. It also sells to
residential and commercial customers energy that it acquires
through power-purchase agreements with third parties. SunPower
will help the company develop solar projects for utilities and
commercial customers in Australia, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
