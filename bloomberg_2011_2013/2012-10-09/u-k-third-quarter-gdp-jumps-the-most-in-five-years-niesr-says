The U.K.  economy  grew at its fastest
pace in five years in the third quarter after a rebound from
one-off disruptions in the prior three months, the National
Institute of Economic and Social Research said.  Gross domestic product rose 0.8 percent, compared with 0.1
percent in the quarter through August, Niesr, whose clients
include the  Bank of England , said in an e-mailed statement in
London today. That’s the fastest expansion for a calendar
quarter since the third quarter of 2007.  Underlying growth was weaker than suggested by the headline
number, Niesr said. Stripping out distortions stemming from
June’s extra public holiday for Queen Elizabeth II’s Diamond
Jubilee, it measured the economy’s pace of expansion as closer
to between 0.2 percent and 0.3 percent.  “The strength of the figure for the three months to
September is largely an artefact of special events,” it said.
“ Economic growth  is expected to be at a significantly slower
pace in the coming quarters.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
