The premium for December European
Union carbon permits over United Nations Certified Emission
Reduction offsets widened to the most ever on  London ’s ICE
Futures Europe exchange.  The spread, traded as a separate contract, expanded 1.3
percent, or 8 cents, to 6.05 euros a metric ton as of 8:01 a.m.
London time. That’s the biggest differential since the contract
was first offered in 2008.  EU carbon for December, the industry benchmark, rose as
much as 1.3 percent to 8.02 euros a ton, and CER futures had not
yet traded on ICE.  To contact the reporter on this story:
