Canadian  stocks  fell the most in
three months after the  International Monetary Fund  cut its
global growth forecasts and warned of “alarmingly high” risks
of a steeper slowdown.  Research In Motion Ltd. (RIM)  lost 5.5 percent after Jefferies &
Co. said the release of the company’s BlackBerry 10 phone may be
delayed.  Taseko Mines (TKO)  Ltd. slid 5.5 percent as analysts at
Canaccord Genuity lowered the stock’s rating to hold.  The  Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index (SPTSX)  slumped 145.42
points, or 1.2 percent, to 12,273.57 in Toronto, its biggest
loss since July 6. The benchmark equity gauge is up 2.7 percent
this year. Raw-materials stocks  contributed  most to declines on
the S&P/TSX as all 10 industries retreated.  “The weight of all these macro issues are bearing down on
people, be it whether  Spain  will ask for money, will Germany do
anything and then this report reducing global GDP, it’s all
weighing on the market,” said Robert Sneddon, president of
Oakville, Ontario-based CastleMoore Inc., in a phone interview.
“And we’re seeing in the Canadian market some talk of housing
pressure starting to build.”  Canadian  housing starts  fell 2.3 percent to an annual pace
of 220,215 from a revised 225,328 in August, Ottawa-based Canada
Mortgage & Housing Corp. said today. Economists surveyed by
Bloomberg had forecast a median pace of 205,000 starts.  The world economy will grow 3.3 percent this year, the
slowest since the 2009 recession, and 3.6 percent next year, the
IMF said today, compared with July predictions of 3.5 percent in
2012 and 3.9 percent in 2013.  Taseko Cut  Taseko Mines slumped 5.5 percent to C$3.12 after Orest Wowkodaw, an analyst with Canaccord Genuity, cut the company’s
rating to hold from buy, citing recent price gains. The copper
and molybdenum mining company has risen 12 percent this year,
 compared  with a 2.3 percent loss for the S&P/TSX Materials
Index.  Endeavour Silver Corp. (EDR)  fell 6.2 percent to C$8.97 after the
company said an illegal work stoppage at its El Cubo mine in
Guanajuato, Mexico, is preventing management and personnel from
reaching parts of the site.  Fortuna Silver Mines Inc. (FVI) , which
also mines in Mexico, declined 7.6 percent to C$4.60.  RIM fell 5.5 percent to C$7.62 in Toronto after  Peter Misek , an analyst with Jefferies, said the company probably
won’t release BlackBerry 10 smart phones until March, missing
the fiscal fourth quarter. The delay would push back the timing
of any licensing deals with other companies until after the
release, Misek said in a research note today.  Gold Stocks  Alacer Gold Corp. (ASR)  fell 4.2 percent to C$6.68 and Novagold
Resources Inc. decreased 4.9 percent to C$4.87. Gold futures for
December delivery dropped 0.6 percent to settle at $1,765 an
ounce in New York, its lowest in more than a week.  Crew Energy Inc. (CR)  jumped 5 percent to C$7.93, its highest
price in six months, after Michael Harvey, an analyst at RBC
Capital Markets, raised the stock to an outperform from sector
perform rating and increased the price target to C$10 from
C$7.50 on the view its Montney natural gas asset base is
undervalued.  Trilogy Energy Corp. (TET)  rose 1.7 percent to C$27.68, as crude
for November delivery increased 3.4 percent to settle at $92.39
a barrel in New York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
