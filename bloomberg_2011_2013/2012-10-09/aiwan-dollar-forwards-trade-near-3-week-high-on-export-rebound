The  Taiwan dollar ’s one-month
forwards traded near a three-week high as a rebound in exports
stoked optimism the island’s economy will withstand a global
economic slowdown.  Investors based abroad bought $171 million more Taiwanese
stocks than they sold today, while government bonds advanced.
Shipments rose for the first time in seven months in September,
climbing 10.4 percent from a year earlier and beating the 1
percent median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey, official
data showed after the market closed yesterday. In neighboring
 South Korea , overseas sales dropped 1.8 percent in a third month
of contraction.  “The export data turned out to be quite strong,” said
Suan Teck Kin, an economist at  United Overseas Bank Ltd. (UOB)  in
 Singapore .“We may see a bit of positive sentiment there for the
Taiwan dollar. We are still seeing weakness in external trade in
some countries.”  One-month non-deliverable forwards traded at NT$29.29 per
dollar compared with NT$29.295 yesterday, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The contract reached NT$29.195 on Oct. 5,
the strongest level since Sept. 17.  In the  spot market , the Taiwan dollar ended little changed
as the central bank sold the currency toward close of trading,
said two traders familiar with the monetary authority’s
operations who declined to be identified.  Central Bank  “In the past two weeks, the Taiwan dollar at the end of
the day was biased toward the NT$29.40 to NT$29.45 area,” said
Suan.  “Possible intervention” curbed gains in the currency,
he said. Central banks intervene by arranging purchases or sales
of foreign exchange.  The currency closed at NT$29.399 against its U.S.
counterpart, compared with NT$29.402 yesterday, according to
Taipei Forex Inc. It has appreciated 3 percent this year. One-
month implied volatility, a measure of exchange-rate swings used

point, to 3.75 percent.  The yield on the 2 percent  government bonds  due July 2017
fell one basis point to 0.88 percent, according to Gretai
Securities Market. The  overnight interbank lending rate  was

the Taiwan Interbank Money Centre shows.  To contact the reporters on this story:
