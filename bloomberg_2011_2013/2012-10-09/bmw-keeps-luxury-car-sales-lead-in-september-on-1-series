Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW)  retained
its global lead among luxury carmakers as sales growth last
month outpaced gains at German rivals  Audi AG (NSU)  and  Daimler AG (DAI) ’s
Mercedes-Benz brand.  BMW-brand deliveries increased 14.3 percent to 146,843 cars
and sport-utility vehicles in September, the Munich-based
manufacturer said today in a statement. That compares with
growth of 13.6 percent to 136,600 deliveries at Audi last month
and 2 percent to 123,358 cars and SUVs at Mercedes.  Audi, a unit of  Volkswagen AG (VOW) , and Stuttgart-based Mercedes
each have a goal of overtaking BMW to lead the world’s luxury-
car sales by the end of the decade. Audi has narrowed the gap
with BMW this year, while growth at third-place Mercedes has
lagged behind increases at both competitors.  “Mercedes’s slower growth is down to the product
portfolio,” with the company planning vehicle introductions
only late in 2012, Christian Ludwig, a Dusseldorf, Germany-based
analyst at Bankhaus Lampe, said in a phone interview. “BMW and
Audi offer more dynamic models.”  BMW  rose  as much as 1.1 percent to 60.73 euros and was
trading up 0.5 percent at 10:58 a.m. in  Frankfurt . Volkswagen
gained 0.9 percent to 146.70 euros. Daimler declined 0.4 percent
to 38.14 euros.  Nine-month sales at the BMW brand increased 8.6 percent to
1.11 million cars and SUVs. Ingolstadt-based Audi reported a 13
percent jump in nine-month deliveries to just under 1.1 million,
while Mercedes posted a 5 percent increase to 964,926. BMW’s
lead against Audi as of Sept. 30 narrowed to 12,462 vehicles
from a 48,801-delivery advantage a year earlier.  6-Series Surge  BMW’s September sales were propelled by demand for the 1-
Series compact, which increased sales by 51 percent to 23,583
cars, the company said. Deliveries of the 6-Series coupe more
than tripled to 2,426 cars and the X1 SUV posted 33 percent
growth to 16,661 units.  Group sales at BMW, including the Mini small-car brand and
the Rolls-Royce ultra-luxury marque, rose 12 percent to 177,716
vehicles in September, propelled by a 59 percent surge in  China .
The company’s European sales increased 4.8 percent, with
combined BMW and Mini deliveries gaining 9.3 percent in  Germany ,
the manufacturer said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
