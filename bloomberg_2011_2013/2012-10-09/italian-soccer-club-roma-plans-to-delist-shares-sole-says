James Pallotta, the president of AS
Roma, said the Italian  soccer club  plans to delist its shares
that are publicly traded, newspaper  Il Sole 24 Ore  reported on
its website.  Pallotta, managing director of Boston-based Raptor Capital
Management LP, bought control of the team with a group of U.S.
investors last year. He said sports teams are long-term
investments that aren’t suited to the stock market, the
newspaper reported.  The move isn’t a priority and Roma has more pressing issues
including building a 60,000-seat stadium, Il Sole reported,
adding plans for that may be unveiled in three months.  To contact the reporters on this story:
