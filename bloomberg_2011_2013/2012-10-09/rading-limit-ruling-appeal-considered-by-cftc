The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading
Commission may decide as soon as this week to appeal a judge’s
ruling against trading limits for oil, natural gas and other
commodities, according to two people briefed on the matter.  The five-member commission plans to vote following a
recommendation from the agency’s general counsel’s office to
appeal the ruling, according to the people, who spoke on
condition of anonymity because the schedule is private. U.S.
District Judge Robert Wilkins ruled on Sept. 28 that the CFTC
failed to assess whether the limits imposed under the Dodd-Frank
Act were necessary and appropriate.  The decision blocked rules scheduled to take effect Oct. 12
that were challenged by the Securities Industry and Financial
Markets Association and International Swaps and Derivatives
Association Inc. The associations represent  JPMorgan Chase &
Co. (JPM) ,  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) ,  Morgan Stanley (MS)  and other banks
and energy-trading firms.  Steven Adamske , the CFTC’s spokesman, declined to comment.  Bart Chilton, one of three Democrats on the commission, has
urged the agency to appeal the ruling. The agency should also
consider a separate rulemaking that finds speculation limits are
necessary, Chilton said in remarks prepared for a speech today
at a  High-Frequency Trading Leaders Forum  conference in Chicago.  The case is International Swaps and Derivatives Association
v. U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, 11-02146, U.S.
District Court,  District of Columbia  (Washington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
