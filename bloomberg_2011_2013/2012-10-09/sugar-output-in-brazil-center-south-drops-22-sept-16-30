Sugar output in  Brazil ’s Center
South, the world’s largest producing region, declined 22 percent
in the second half of September after rain disrupted harvesting,
industry association Unica said.  Mills in the region, where about a fifth of the world’s
sugar is produced, made 2.21 million metric tons of the
sweetener between Sept. 16 and Sept. 30, down from 2.84 million
tons a year earlier, Sao Paulo-based Unica said in an e-mailed
report today.  Growers harvested 31.8 million tons of sugarcane in the
period, down from 36.9 million tons a year earlier. Ethanol
output dropped 12 percent to 1.44 billion liters (379 million
gallons).  Mills turned 48.6 percent of the cane into sugar, down from
51.8 percent a year earlier. The rest was processed into
ethanol.  For the entire crop year that started April 1, sugar output
is forecast to rise to 32.7 million tons, from 31.3 million tons
in the past season, Unica said Sept. 20. The region will produce
518.5 million tons of cane, up from 493.2 million tons in the
past season, Unica said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
