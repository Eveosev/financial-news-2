Cytec Industries Inc. (CYT)  agreed to sell
its coatings unit to private-equity firm Advent International
Corp. for $1.03 billion to focus on more profitable businesses
that make carbon-fiber composites and chemicals.  The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter,
Woodland Park, New Jersey-based Cytec said today in a statement.
Advent, based in  Boston , also will assume liabilities of $118
million.  Cytec, the world’s second-biggest producer of carbon-fiber
materials for airplanes, said in May that it would sell its
coating resins unit, its  largest by revenue , to focus on metal-
processing chemicals and composites. It hired JPMorgan Chase &
Co. as a financial adviser in January to review options. The
bank advised on the purchase by Advent.  “The timing and total value of the transaction lie at the
upper end of our expectations,” Michael J. Sison, a Cleveland-
based analyst at Keybanc Capital Markets who recommends buying
the shares, said in a note. Cytec is “divesting low-margin
businesses and focusing its growth on its higher margin
franchises.”  The deal’s enterprise value of $1.15 billion, which
includes net debt, is 7.8 times 2011 earnings before interest,
taxes, depreciation and amortization from the coatings unit, and
6.9 times estimated 2012 Ebitda, Sison said. He had estimated
the unit would sell for $600 million to $1.2 billion.  Buyback Program  Chemical deals larger than $100 million announced this year
had a median Ebitda multiple of 7.2, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  Cytec fell 0.9 percent to $64.09 at 1:39 p.m. in New York.
The shares have gained 43 percent this year.  The resins produced by the Cytec unit are used in coatings
for cars and in food and beverage cans. Advent plans to boost
the segment’s sales and earnings partly by raising output in
Asia and other  emerging markets , the private-equity firm said
today in a  statement  on its website.  Cytec’s coatings business is based in Brussels with
operations in  Europe , the U.S. and Asia, Advent said. The
segment accounted for $1.55 billion of sales, or 50 percent of
total revenue, in 2011, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The board of Cytec also approved an additional $452 million
stock buyback, taking the total repurchases now authorized to
$650 million, the company said in a separate statement. The
buyback will be funded with some of the proceeds from the
coatings sale, it said.  Cytec has been adding to its composites and separations
businesses. It acquired Umeco Plc, a U.K.-based producer of
composite materials used in planes and cars, in July. In April,
Cytec bought manufacturing assets of  India ’s Star Orechem
International Private Ltd. to help expand output of chemicals
uses to separate copper from mined ore.  (Cytec scheduled a conference call at 2 p.m. New York time,
