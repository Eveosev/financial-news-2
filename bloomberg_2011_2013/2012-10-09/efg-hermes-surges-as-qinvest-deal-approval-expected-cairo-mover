EFG-Hermes Holding SAE (HRHO)  jumped the
most in more than three months after saying it expects  Egypt ’s
financial regulator to approve the creation of an investment
bank with QInvest next week.  Shares of the biggest publicly traded Arab investment bank
rose 4.5 percent, the most since July 2, to 11.44 Egyptian
pounds at the close in Cairo. That valued the company at 5.47
billion pounds ($898 million) and brought the gain for the year
to 14 percent. The benchmark  EGX 30 Index (EGX30)  fell 0.4 percent
today, paring this year’s advance to 54 percent.  EFG-Hermes has met with the  Egyptian Financial Supervisory
Authority  and has “been assured that approval is on its way and
that there are no problems,” EFG-Hermes Chairwoman Mona
Zulficar said today in an interview. Approval is expected next
week for the deal that stands to pay stockholders a 4-pound
dividend a share.  “Renewed chatter on the super dividend is helping the name
jog higher” after Zulficar’s comments, said Wafik Dawood,
director of institutional sales at Cairo-based Mega Investments
Securities.  The transaction would transfer ownership of the firm’s main
businesses of brokerage, asset management and investment banking
to a new entity in Qatar to be 60 percent-owned by QInvest,
which has the option to buy the remaining shares after a year of
its completion.  EFG-Hermes expects to complete the deal within two months
once it has received approval from the EFSA, Zulficar said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
