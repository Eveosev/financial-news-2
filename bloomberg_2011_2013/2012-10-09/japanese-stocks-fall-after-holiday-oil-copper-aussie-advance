Japanese stocks fell as the market
opened after a holiday. Oil, silver and copper rose after a two-
day slide, while the Australian dollar strengthened.  Japan ’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average lost 0.4 percent at 9:31

 MSCI Asia Pacific excluding Japan Index  gained 0.2 percent, led
by commodity producers, while futures on the Standard & Poor’s

barrel after dropping 2.6 percent in the past two days. Silver
advanced 0.4 percent and copper in London added 0.3 percent. The

exporter, and it’s suffering from not only a slowdown in China,
but also across all of Europe,” said Matthew Sherwood,
Perpetual Investments’ head of investment-markets research in
Sydney. Perpetual manages about $25 billion. “We are looking at
balance-sheet risks in each individual company because we are in
a capital-constrained world.”  Japan posted a bigger-than-expected current-account surplus
in August, the  Finance Ministry  said today. The world economy

time high of 1,565.15 in the  S&P 500 .  Fortescue Metals Group Ltd. paced gains in iron-ore
producers, climbing 4.3 percent in Sydney, after iron-ore swaps
rose yesterday as Chinese buyers returned to the market after
