Wheat futures rose for the second
straight day on speculation that the U.S. will lower its
forecasts for global supplies as dry weather damages crops from
 Russia  to  Australia . Soybeans declined.  Global wheat supplies before next year’s Northern
Hemisphere harvest may be 172.77 million metric tons, down 2.2
percent from the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s estimate in
September, according to analysts in a Bloomberg survey. Today,
Russia cut its forecast for grain exports, and Australia last
month reduced its harvest projection.  “Fundamentals are still bullish,” said Kieran Walsh, an
agricultural-derivatives broker at Aurel BGC in Paris. “It
would not be entirely unexpected for the USDA report to cut
global production outlook, and Russian exports were at the lower
end of estimates.”  Wheat futures for December delivery rose 0.4 percent to
settle at $8.6425 a bushel at 2 p.m. on the  Chicago  Board of
Trade. The price gained 0.4 percent yesterday.  The USDA will update its forecasts on supply and demand on
Oct. 11. Last year, the U.S. was the world’s top exporter,
followed by Australia and Russia. The price has jumped 32
percent this year.  Soybean futures for November delivery fell 0.1 percent to
$15.50 a bushel. Earlier, the price reached $15.74, the highest
for a most-active contract since Oct. 1.  Corn futures for December delivery were unchanged at $7.42
a bushel. Earlier, the price gained as much as 0.9 percent.  In the U.S., corn is the biggest crop, followed by
soybeans, hay and wheat.  To contact the reporters on this story:
