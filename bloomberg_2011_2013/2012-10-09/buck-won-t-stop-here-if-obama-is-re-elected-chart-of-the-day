The dollar may strengthen over the
last four months of the year if President Barack Obama is re-
elected, and weaken if Republican challenger  Mitt Romney  is
victorious, according to historical patterns.  The CHART OF THE DAY shows the Dollar Index, which measures
the greenback against the currencies of six major U.S. trading
partners, has gained from September through December in years
since 1988 that a Democratic candidate has won the presidential
election. The index has declined over that four-month period in
years with a Republican victor.  “The dollar tends to have a positive correlation with an
incoming Democratic administration, perhaps since Democrats tend
to favor pro-growth policies to spur the economy,” said  Joe Manimbo , a market analyst in Washington at Western Union
Business Solutions, a unit of  Western Union Co. (WU)  This year, he
said, “a GOP victory would inject uncertainty into markets,
which would tend to weigh initially on risk and benefit safer
assets, like the dollar.”  The  Dollar Index  rose 0.6 percent yesterday after falling
0.8 percent the prior week. The gauge has declined 1.5 percent
since the beginning of September.  The index fell 6 percent in 1988, 2.7 percent in 2000 and
9.1 percent in 2004 amid Republican victories. It gained 17
percent in 1992, 1.9 percent in 1996 and 5.1 percent in 2008
amid wins for the Democratic party.  A Gallup poll of registered voters Oct. 2 to Oct. 8 showed
Obama ahead of Romney by three points, while a Pew Research
Center survey of likely voters Oct. 4 to Oct. 7 gave the
Republican nominee a four-point lead.  To contact the reporter on this story:
