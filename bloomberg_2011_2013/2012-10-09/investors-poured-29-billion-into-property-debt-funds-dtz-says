Investors are putting more money into
real estate debt funds after banks reduced the size of their
loan books to meet tougher regulatory requirements, DTZ Group
Plc said.  The amount of money earmarked for real-estate debt funds
rose 54 percent to $29 billion in the first half, according to a
report published today by the London-based real estate adviser.
The company estimates that funds are seeking to raise an
additional $17 billion to be deployed globally or in  Europe  by
acquiring bank loan portfolios or through lending.  In Europe, the amount of money earmarked for real estate
debt is probably inadequate to fill the funding gap caused by
lendersâ€™ retrenchment. Banks account for 94 percent of real
estate lending in Europe, or 2.4 trillion euros ($3.1 trillion),
and may reduce loans by as much a 25 percent in the next three
to five years, Morgan Stanley estimates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
