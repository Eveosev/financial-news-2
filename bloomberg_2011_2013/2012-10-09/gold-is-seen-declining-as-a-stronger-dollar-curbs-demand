Gold declined to the lowest in more than a week as a stronger dollar eroded demand for the precious metal as an alternative investment.  The dollar gained the most in more than two months against a basket of currencies after the  International Monetary Fund  said the world economy will grow 3.3 percent this year, the slowest pace since the 2009 recession. The region using the European currency will contract 0.4 percent this year, 0.1 percentage point worse than forecast in July, the IMF said. Gold rallied last week as central banks from the U.S. to Asia pledged to spur growth.  “The IMF forecast has taken some blush off the rose,”  Frank McGhee , the head dealer at Integrated Brokerage Services LLC in  Chicago , said in a telephone interview. “We are seeing some move towards the dollar.”  View related slideshow :  The Real Cost of Owning Gold Gold futures for December delivery fell 0.6 percent to settle at $1,765 an ounce as of 1:33 p.m. on the Comex in  New York , after earlier slipping to $1,762, the lowest since Sept. 27.
