Hungary ’s government, which requested
financial aid from the  International Monetary Fund  11 months
ago, placed full-page advertisements on the back pages of major
newspapers today, declaring it “won’t give in to the IMF.”  The country expects “respect and trust” from the IMF and
“we won’t give up Hungary’s independence,” the ad on the back
page of business daily  Napi Gazdasag  said. Other slogans
rejected cutting family benefits or introducing a property tax.  Prime Minister  Viktor Orban  on Oct. 1 ruled out an IMF loan
agreement that entails cuts in pensions, jobs or wages,
conditions which last month he said were demands of
international lenders. The IMF wants “more balanced” policies
that improve the growth outlook and doesn’t recommend austerity
measures on top of government plans, the fund’s representative
in Hungary said on Oct. 4.  Hungary’s talks for a loan of about 15 billion euros ($19.5
billion) were delayed repeatedly because of Orban’s resistance
to legal and economic conditions set by the IMF and the European
Union.  To contact the reporter on this story:
