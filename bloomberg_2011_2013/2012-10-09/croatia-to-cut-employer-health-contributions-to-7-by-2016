Croatia plans to cut employers’
mandatory health-fund contributions by almost a half to seven
percent by 2016 to boost the country’s competitiveness, Finance
Minister Slavko Linic said.  “We plan to have this done by the end of our mandate,”
Linic told entrepreneurs at a conference in Zagreb today.  The nine-month-old government of Prime Minister  Zoran Milanovic  reduced health contributions to 13 from 15 percent
earlier this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
