Statoil ASA (STL)  has leased 1,000 railcars
for use in the Bakken formation in  North Dakota  and plans to
deliver by rail to refineries on both coasts.  The Oslo-based energy company recently delivered a rail
shipment of Bakken crude to Irving Oil Corp.’s Saint John
refinery in  New Brunswick , Bill Maloney, Statoil’s executive
vice president for development and production in North America,
said in an interview in Houston. The 298,800-barrel-a-day plant
is Canada’s largest.  Statoil produced about 26,000 barrels of oil equivalent a
day in the Bakken in the first quarter. It expects to move 10
percent to 20 percent of the oil by rail, said Torstein Hole,
Statoil’s senior vice president for U.S. onshore development and
production.  Statoil expects to keep sending oil by rail to the Atlantic
and Pacific coasts, where prices are higher than at Cushing,
Oklahoma, the delivery point for the U.S. benchmark West Texas
Intermediate.  Brent crude  traded in London settled at a $22.52-a-barrel
 premium  to WTI yesterday, the highest since Oct. 20, 2011. It
costs $8 to $11 a barrel to ship crude by rail to the coasts,
Maloney said.  “Not only are we reaching better markets, but what we’re
taking out of the Bakken is increasing local prices,” Hole
said.  Bakken oil on the  spot market  in Clearbrook, Minnesota,
sold at a $2.50  premium  to WTI at 8:51 a.m. in New York, above
the one-year average of a $5.10 discount, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
