Ukraine’s corn harvest forecast was
cut on declining yields to 19 million metric tons from last
month’s estimate of 20 million tons, agriculture researcher
UkrAgroConsult said.  “With more than half of the corn harvested, yields are at
4.15 tons a hectare compared with 5.54 tons a hectare a year
ago,” Liza Malyshko, grain analyst at the Kiev-based
researcher, said by phone today.  The total grain harvest for this year is seen at 42.4
million tons, compared with the researcher’s estimate last month
of 43.4 million tons, according to UkrAgroConsult’s weekly notes
e-mailed yesterday. Forecasts for wheat and barley remained
unchanged at 14.2 million tons and 6.52 million tons
respectively.  To contact the reporter on this story:
