Citgo Petroleum Corp. has shut the
West plant at its Corpus Christi  refinery  in  Texas  for planned
work, according to a person with knowledge of the situation.  A crude unit in the refinery’s East plant is also shut and
undergoing work, said the person, who asked not to be identified
because the information is private. The maintenance is expected
to last another two to three weeks, said the person.  Fernando Garay , a Houston-based spokesman for Citgo, didn’t
immediately respond to an e-mail seeking comment.  Citgo said Oct. 1 in an e-mailed statement that the Corpus
Christi refinery had begun shutting units for planned work at
both the East and West plants. The company declined at the time
to identify the units or the duration of the work period.  Citgo’s Corpus  Christi East and West plants have a
combined capacity of 165,000 barrels a day, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
