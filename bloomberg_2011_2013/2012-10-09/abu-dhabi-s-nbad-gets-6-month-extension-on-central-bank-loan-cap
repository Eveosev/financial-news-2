National Bank of Abu Dhabi PJSC , the
 United Arab Emirates ’s largest lender by market value, secured a
six-month extension to comply with the central bank’s loan limit
rules.  The central bank extended the deadline for the Abu Dhabi-
based lender until March 2013, chief executive officer Michael
Tomalin told Dow Jones yesterday in  Kuala Lumpur , according to a
bank spokesman, who declined to be identified because of company
policy. The new loan rules won’t affect the bank’s growth in the
future, Tomalin said.  Banks in the U.A.E. can lend no more than 100 percent of
their capital to local governments and government-related
entities as of Sept. 30, 2012, the central bank said April 4.
There was no limit under previous rules. The central bank’s
assistant governor Saif Al Shamsi said Oct. 1 it won’t extend
its deadline for banks to comply with the new rules.  To contact the reporter on this story:
