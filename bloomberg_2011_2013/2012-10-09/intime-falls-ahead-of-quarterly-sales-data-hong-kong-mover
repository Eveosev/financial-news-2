Intime Department Store Group Co.
Ltd. (1833) , the third-biggest department store operator in China by
market capitalization, dropped by the most in a year in Hong
Kong trading ahead of the release of three-month operational
data.  Intime fell 8.2 percent, the biggest decline since Oct. 18,
2011, to HK$8.21 at the close of Hong Kong trading. That
compares with the 0.54 percent gain in the benchmark Hang Seng
Index.  Golden Eagle Retail Group Ltd. (3308) , China’s biggest
department store operator by market value, fell 4 percent and
No. 2  Parkson Retail Group Ltd. (3368)  dropped 1.9 percent.  “Investors are selling on the expectation of a lackluster
third-quarter sales figure, which the company is due to
announce,” said Albert Yip, a Hong Kong-based analyst at BOCOM
International who rates the stock “neutral,” with a share-
price estimate of HK$8.33.  China’s economic growth slid to a three-year low of 7.6
percent in the second quarter. The expansion rate may contract
to 7.4 percent in the current three-month period from a year
earlier, based on the median estimate of 23 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg News from Sept. 11 to Sept. 18.  To contact the reporters on this story:
