Alcoa Inc. (AA) , the largest U.S. aluminum
producer, cut its forecast for global consumption of the metal
by 1 percentage point as the Chinese economy slows.  Demand will increase by 6 percent this year, the New York-
based company said today in its third-quarter earnings
statement. Alcoa said in July that usage would rise 7 percent,
following increases of 10 percent in 2011 and 13 percent in
2010.  The International Monetary Fund today cut its global growth
forecast and lowered its projected expansion for  China , the
world’s biggest aluminum user, by 0.2 percentage point annually,
to 7.8 percent this year and 8.2 percent in 2013. Aluminum
prices on the  London  Metal Exchange have already declined in the
past year, touching a 34-month low in August, as global supply
exceeds demand.  “The global economy is clearly slowing,” Lloyd O’Carroll,
a Richmond, Virginia-based analyst for Davenport & Co., said
today in an interview. “That’s what the IMF said today and so I
think what Alcoa is doing is consistent with that.”  Alcoa had a third-quarter net loss of $143 million, or 13
cents a share, compared with net income of $172 million, or 15
cents, a year earlier.  Excluding costs related to environmental remediation and
the settlement of a lawsuit brought by  Aluminium Bahrain BSC (ALBH) ,
Alcoa had per-share profit of 3 cents. The average of 18
estimates compiled by Bloomberg was for break-even earnings per
share. Alcoa said it had improved productivity across all four
business units.  Price Decline  Sales fell to $5.83 billion from $6.42 billion, beating the
$5.56 billion average of 10 estimates.  The shares rose 0.5 percent to $9.18 at 4:40 p.m. after the
close of regular trading in New York.  Aluminum for delivery in three months on the LME averaged
$1,950 a metric ton in the third quarter, 20 percent less than a
year earlier. The metal traded at $2,054 a metric ton at 9 p.m.
today in London.  Prices below $2,000 may drive more production cuts, Ken Hoffman, a Bloomberg Industries analyst, said last week.  Aluminum will average $2,212 a ton next year, according to
the median of 22 analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg. The
metal traded at over $3,300 in 2008 before the financial crash,
and reached a 2011 intraday high of $2,803 a ton.  Alcoa, London-based Rio Tinto Group,  Norway ’s Norsk Hydro
and closely held Zeeland Aluminum have cut 1.21 million tons of
production since mid-2011, according data compiled by Bloomberg.  Alcoa is organized into four segments: alumina, which mines
bauxite and processes it into the precursor to aluminum; primary
metals, which smelts aluminum; flat-rolled products, which makes
sheets used in beverage cans as well as airplane wings and car
parts; and engineered products and solutions, which makes
aerospace fasteners, turbine blades and truck wheels.  To contact the reporters on this story:
