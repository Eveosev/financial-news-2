A finance department billing mistake
for water and sewer services will cost Port Orange,  Florida ,
about $800,000 in revenue that probably won’t be recouped, the
Daytona Beach News-Journal reported, citing the city manager.  A miscalculation of energy surcharge rate tables meant the
wrong amounts were billed for Port Orange’s wholesale water and
sewage services to Daytona Beach Shores for 43 months, the
newspaper said. The bottom line was “they weren’t charged
enough,” City Manager Ken Parker told the paper.  An investigation is under way and an auditor has been
called in but “the wrong data was entered, I think it was just
a plain human error,” Parker was quoted as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
