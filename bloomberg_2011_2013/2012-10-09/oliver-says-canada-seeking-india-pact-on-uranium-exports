Canada is working to finalize an
agreement with  India  that will ease the export of uranium by
companies such as  Cameco Corp. (CCO) , Natural Resources Minister Joe Oliver said.  The two countries signed a nuclear cooperation  pact  in June
2010 to enable Canada’s nuclear industry to sell materials and
equipment for civilian purposes to India. Canada has asked India
to ensure exports can be traced, in line with standards met by
countries such as the U.S.  Canada and India are negotiating an “administrative”
arrangement to address such issues, Oliver said today in a
telephone interview from New Delhi.  “Our government is very keen on completing that
arrangement and seeing it finalized,” Oliver said. “I’m
hopeful that can in fact be done,” he said, adding that Canada
has met its obligations under international non-proliferation
treaties.  Oliver is visiting India to promote  Canada ’s natural
resources, especially energy.  “The fundamentals are there,” he said. “We have the
resources they need, and they need a lot of resources.”  Canada and India started negotiations on a free-trade
agreement in November 2010. Trade between the countries rose to
almost C$5.2 billion ($5.3 billion) last year.  Prime Minister Stephen Harper and Indian Prime Minister
Manmohan Singh have pledged to triple bilateral trade by 2015.  To contact the reporter on this story:
