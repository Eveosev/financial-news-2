New World Resources Plc (NWR)  fell to its
lowest level in about three years after JPMorgan Chase & Co. cut
the stock recommendation to “underperform” from “neutral”
citing “weakness” in coking coal markets.  The stock slid 0.27 koruna, or 0.3 percent, to 85.7 koruna
in Prague trading. That’s the lowest level since July 2009.  JPMorgan expects NWR to “underperform due to a lack of
growth and weakness in coking coal markets, while the balance
sheet leverage continues to increase,” JPMorgan analysts wrote
in a research note dated today.  JPMorgan also lowered its price estimate for the shares to
260 pence from 530 pence.  The bank expects small and mid-size miners to continue to
underperform large diversified names and recommends investors to
favor “quality” over leverage, the note said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
