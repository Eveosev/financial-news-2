Spanish Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy 
said Francois Hollande doesn’t know the situation of Spanish
banks after the French president recommended an international
bailout for the lenders, Efe newswire reported.  “I don’t think Mr. Hollande said that because, logically,
he doesn’t know how the Spanish banks are,” Efe quoted Rajoy as
saying today in Chicago, where he’s attending a NATO meeting.  To contact the reporter on this story:
