People who have smoked a pack of
cigarettes every day for at least 30 years should get advanced
lung scans annually starting at age 55 to check for early
evidence of cancer while it’s still treatable, researchers said.  Low-dose  computerized tomography  may cut the risk of dying
from  lung cancer  by 20 percent, according to a report presented
today at the American Thoracic Society International Conference
and published in the  Journal of the American Medical
Association . For every person diagnosed with lung cancer, there
were 20 with suspicious findings that needed biopsies or other
follow-up to rule out a malignancy, the researchers said.  The risk of cancer is great enough in heavy smokers 55 to
74 years old to justify annual CT scans, according to guidelines
from the American College of Chest Physicians and the  American
Society of Clinical Oncology  based on the study results. They
aren’t recommended for older and younger smokers, people who
quit more than 15 years ago, patients with limited life
expectancies or those who light up less frequently.  “Low-dose computed tomography screening may benefit
individuals at an increased risk for lung cancer, but
uncertainty exists about the potential harms,” said researchers
led by Peter Bach, from  Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center 
in  New York . Because most patients are diagnosed with advanced
disease, there is renewed enthusiasm for the CT screening,
“which is able to identify smaller nodules,” the researchers
said.  Lung cancer is the  leading cause  of cancer-related death,
killing an estimated 160,000 people in the U.S. each year,
according to the  American Cancer Society .  To contact the reporter on this story:
