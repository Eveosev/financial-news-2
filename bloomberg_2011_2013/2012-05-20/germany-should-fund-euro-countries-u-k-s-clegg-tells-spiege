Germany must spend more money on
supporting European Union countries in crisis,  Der Spiegel  cited
British Deputy Prime Minister  Nick Clegg  as saying in an
interview.  A common currency won’t work without transfer payments,
while fiscal discipline alone won’t save the euro, Clegg told
the magazine. Direct payments to other governments or jointly
issued euro area bonds are unavoidable, Clegg said, according to
Der Spiegel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
