Babe Ruth ’s earliest-known jersey has
sold at auction for $4.42 million, a record for an item of
sports memorabilia.  A New York Yankees cap worn by Ruth in at least one game
during the early 1930s fetched $537,278, while the  Super Bowl 
ring won by former New York Giants’ linebacker Lawrence Taylor
following the 1990 National Football League season went for a
bid of $230,401, SCP Auctions said in a news release.  Ruth’s game-worn Yankees jersey, estimated to date from
about 1920, eclipsed the $4.34 million paid for James Naismith’s
founding rules of basketball in 2010. Ruth’s cap, sold by former
Yankees pitcher  David Wells , set a record for a baseball cap,
while Taylor’s ring established a new mark for a NFL
championship ring.  “This proves again that Babe Ruth is king in the sports
memorabilia world,” SCP Auctions President David Kohler said in
the company’s statement.  A bat used by Ruth during the 1920s sold for $591,007.
Other high-yielding items in the sale included a 1955 Roberto Clemente Topps rookie card that went for $432,690 and a 1954
Hank Aaron Topps rookie card, which had a winning bid of
$537,954.  Ruth hit 714 home runs and won seven World Series titles,
three with the  Boston Red Sox  and four with the Yankees. He
ranks third on the career home run list behind  Barry Bonds  and
Aaron after 22 years with the Red Sox, Yankees and Boston
Braves. An outfielder and pitcher, Ruth led the  American League 
in home runs 12 times and his 2,213 runs batted in are second
only to Aaron.  High School Fundraiser  Wells said in an interview with Mark Crumpton on Bloomberg
Television’s “Bottom Line” that he decided to sell the cap,
which he purchased for $35,000, to raise funds to help pay for
renovations to the baseball field at his San Diego high school.
The navy blue flannel cap with Ruth’s name embroidered into it
had an estimated sale price of $400,000.  Taylor’s ring features 19 diamonds and sold for more than
double SCP’s $100,000 estimate. Taylor gave the ring to his
son, Lawrence Jr., who elected to sell it, SCP said.  Taylor, 53, was selected to 10 Pro Bowls in a 13-year
career spent entirely in  New York . He was the NFL’s Most
Valuable Player in 1986, a three-time defensive player of the
year and was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in
1999.  The Giants beat the  Buffalo Bills  20-19 in the Super Bowl
on Jan. 27, 1991, as Bills kicker Scott Norwood missed a field
goal in the closing seconds.  The original rules of basketball, written by Naismith in
1891, were sold Dec. 10, 2010, at Sotheby’s in New York.  The two-page typed document with Naismith’s handwritten
notes were purchased by David G. Booth, executive officer of
Dimensional Fund Advisors.  To contact the reporter on this story:
