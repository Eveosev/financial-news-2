Presumptive Republican presidential
nominee  Mitt Romney  raised $11.7 million in April, less than
half as much as President  Barack Obama , Federal Election
Commission reports show.  Romney, a former Massachusetts governor, has now raised
$100.4 million for his campaign, also less than half as much as
the Democratic incumbent. Obama collected $25.7 million in April
and a total of $222.3 million. With $9.2 million cash on hand
entering May, Romney had less than a 12th of Obama’s $115.2
million in campaign money.  A big difference between the two candidates: Obama brought
in $10.7 million, or 42 percent of his total, in contributions
of $200 or less. Romney raised $2.4 million from small donors,
21 percent of his total.  The challenger is relying on the  Republican National
Committee  and political action committees to overcome the
fundraising gap. Through April 30, the Republican committee had
$34.8 million cash on hand compared with $24.3 million for the
Democratic National Committee, FEC records show.  Romney has started raising money jointly with the
 Republican Party , permitting donors to write bigger checks. Some
of those funds are also going to state parties. Obama is also
raising money jointly with his party.  April Donors  April donors included senior campaign adviser  Ed Gillespie ,
a former Republican National Committee chairman, U.S.
Representative Jim Renacci of Ohio and radio talk-show host Neal
Boortz.  Romney’s coffers have been fattened by an allied super-PAC,
Restore Our Future, which reported a bank balance of $8.2
million entering May. The PAC raised $4.6 million last month,
bringing its total to $56.5 million.  Donations to the super-PAC last month included $1 million
from John Kleinheinz, president of  Fort Worth , Texas-based
Kleinheinz Capital Partners Inc.; $985,000 from Harold Hamm,
chief executive officer of Continental Resources Inc. based in
Oklahoma City; and $250,000 from Stephen Zide, a managing
director at Boston-based Bain Capital LLC, the private-equity
firm that Romney co-founded.  C. Boyden Gray, White House counsel to President George
H.W. Bush, gave $50,000.  Romney Advertisements  The PAC announced on May 2 it would spend $4.3 million on
ads praising Romney for helping to find a business partner’s
daughter who had gone missing in  New York  City, and criticizing
two supporters of President Barack Obama: Hilary Rosen and
comedian Bill Maher, for comments about Romney’s wife, Ann, not
working outside the home.  Romney’s last Republican rival, U.S. Representative  Ron Paul  of Texas, reported raising $2 million last month to bring
his total to $39.1 million. He had $2.5 million in cash on hand.
Paul announced on May 14 he was ending active campaigning for
the Republican presidential nomination,  Both former U.S. House Speaker  Newt Gingrich  of Georgia and
former Senator  Rick Santorum  of Pennsylvania quit the
presidential race millions of dollars in debt.  Gingrich, who officially ended his campaign on May 2, owed
$4.8 million at the end of April, including $580,134 to himself
for travel. The former Georgia congressman’s largest creditor
was the air charter company Moby Dick Airways, owed $1 million.  He raised $786,783 last month, bringing his total to $23.4
million for the campaign. He had $806,751 in the bank at the end
of April.  Santorum Campaign  Santorum, who ended his campaign on April 10, was $2.3
million in debt entering May. Santorum’s campaign owed his
senior adviser,  John Brabender , $762,988 and $640,275 to

e-mail services.  He also owed $30,000 to Front Row Motorsports, based in
Statesville,  North Carolina , for sponsoring a car in NASCAR’s
Daytona 500 auto race in Florida in February. Santorum’s
