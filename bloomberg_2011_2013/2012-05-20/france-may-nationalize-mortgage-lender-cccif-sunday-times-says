France may nationalize Caisse
Centrale Credit Immobilier de France, one of its largest
mortgage lenders,  the Sunday Times  reported, citing unidentified
people with knowledge of the matter.  A purchase of CCCIF by a competitor may be another option
and  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA)  has been asked to find a buyer, the
newspaper said.  Calls by Bloomberg News to the offices of CCCIF and its
parent company CIFD today went unanswered.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
