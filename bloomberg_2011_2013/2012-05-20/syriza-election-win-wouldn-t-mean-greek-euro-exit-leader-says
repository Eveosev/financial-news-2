Syriza ’s opposition to the terms of
 Greece ’s financial-aid program doesn’t mean the country would
have to abandon the euro if the party forms a government after
June 17 elections, party leader Alexis Tsipras said.  Presenting the elections as a choice between Greece’s
memorandum with international lenders to stay in the euro and
leaving the single currency is “alarmist,” represents a
“vulgar propaganda campaign” against Syriza and is an attempt
to “terrorize the Greek people” with a false dilemma, Tsipras
said today in a speech in  Athens , according to an e-mailed
transcript of his comments from the party.  Two opinion polls for the Proto Thema and Real News
newspapers published yesterday showed the bailout-supporting
conservative New Democracy party, Greece’s biggest parliamentary
party after May 6 elections, beating Syriza if a vote were held
today. Another two for the Kathimerini and Metro newspapers put
Syriza in first place.  Luxembourg Prime Minister  Jean-Claude Juncker , who heads a
group of European finance ministers, said a majority of his
peers have doubts about Greece’s membership of the euro, Spiegel
reported yesterday, without saying where it got the information.  Scaremongering about Greece’s exit from the euro area,
which would involve “huge costs,” is nonsense and propaganda,
Tsipras said, referring to Juncker. Rather, it’s the continued
implementation of Greece’s memorandum that will lead the country
to bankruptcy and a return to the drachma, he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
