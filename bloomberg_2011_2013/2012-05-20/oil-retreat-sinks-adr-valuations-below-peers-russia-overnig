Russian stocks  traded in  New York 
fell, pushing valuations to the lowest versus emerging-market
companies in four months, as oil tumbled to a six-month low.  The  Bloomberg Russia-US Equity Index (RUS14BN)  of the most-traded
Russian companies in the U.S. declined to a seven-month low,
losing 11 percent to 83.71 in the week. Futures expiring in June
on Moscow’s dollar-denominated RTS Index slid 2.9 percent to
127,010 on May 18.  OAO RusHydro (RSHYY) , Russia’s largest hydropower
producer, retreated 20 percent to $2.46 in New York last week,
widening the discount to the company’s Moscow-listed shares to
4.6 percent, the most in three days.  Russian ADRs’ valuations  dropped  to 4.7 times estimated
earnings, about half the 9.7 multiple for members of the  MSCI
Emerging Markets Index (MXEF) , after oil, the nation’s largest export
earner, sank 3.5 percent last week as  Europe ’s debt crisis
worsened. Almost $4 trillion has been wiped from global equity
markets in May amid mounting concern that Greece will have to
leave the euro after elections next month.  “No matter how cheap Russian equities already are, and
they are extremely cheap, it’s not time to buy yet,” Rustam Botashev, deputy head of research at UniCredit Bank AG, said by
phone from Moscow on May 18. “We have to expect even more
volatility in this down trend. There are overall worries about
slowdown in global growth and decline in  oil prices .”  Bear Market  Russia was the first of the so-called BRIC countries to
enter a  bear market  in 2012 last week after the dollar-
denominated RTS Index extended a 20 percent decline on May 14
from a March 15 peak.  OAO Mechel (MTL) , Russia’s largest producer of coal for
steelmakers, fell 24 percent to $5.48 in New York last week, the
worst performer on the Bloomberg Russia-U.S Index. The company’s
Russian  stock  declined 17 percent in Moscow to 187.00 rubles, or
the equivalent of $5.97. One ADR is equal to one ordinary share.  American depositary receipts of OAO RusHydro were the
second-biggest decliners on the gauge last week. RusHydro lost
7.2 percent in New York on May 18, after dropping 3.4 percent to
80.74 kopeks, or 2.58 U.S. cents, in Moscow. One ADR is equal to
100 ordinary shares.  Activists who clashed with police before President Vladimir Putin’s May 7 inauguration are protesting non-stop in Moscow,
using the  Occupy Wall Street  movement’s tactics.  “Russian equities are under double pressure as two factors
are in play, including overall worries about a slowdown in
global growth and a decline in oil prices, as well as investors’
worries over Russian domestic policies,” Botashev said. “The
new government has not been formed yet and the delay adds to the
uncertainty.”  Sberbank, Gazprom  OAO Sberbank (SBRCY) , the country’s biggest lender, sank 18 percent
to $9.89 last week, the most since the five-days to Sept. 23,
and traded at a 1.2 percent discount to its Moscow-listed
shares.  OAO Gazprom (OGZPY) , the world’s biggest natural gas exporter and
Russia’s biggest company, tumbled 16 percent to $8.74, the
lowest since July 2009. The stock has dropped for a record ninth
consecutive week, losing 35 percent since March 16.  The  Market Vectors Russia ETF (RSX) , a U.S.-traded fund that
holds Russian shares, fell 10 percent last week to $24.16, the
lowest level since September 2009. The RTS Volatility Index,
which measures expected swings in the index futures, rose 2.9
percent to 45.76 points in New York, the highest since Dec. 19.  Oil,  Russia ’s major export commodity, dropped for a third
consecutive week and the Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot Index sank
2 percent to 629.50 last week to the lowest since Dec. 19.  Crude oil for June delivery slumped 1.2 percent to $91.48
on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  on May 18, the lowest since
Oct. 26. Urals crude, Russia’s chief export blend, fell 0.6
percent to $106.19, the lowest since January. Brent oil for July
settlement slipped 0.3 percent, to $107.14 a barrel on the
London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange on May 18.  United Co. Rusal, the world’s largest aluminum producer,
lost 0.9 percent to HK$4.40 at 1:30 p.m. in Hong Kong trading
today. The MSCI Asia Pacific Index rose 0.2 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
