Japanese and Australian  stock   futures 
fell after a gathering of the leaders of the Group of Eight
nations failed to deliver a unified strategy to quell the
European debt crisis.  American depositary receipts of  Sony Corp. (6758) , Japan’s No. 1
exporter of consumer electronics that depends on Europe for a
fifth of its revenue, slid 0.9 percent from the closing share
price in Tokyo. Those of  Mizuho Financial Group Inc. (8411) , Japan’s
third-largest bank by market value, lost 3.3 percent. Shares of
 James Hardie Industries SE (JHX) , an Australian building-materials
supplier, may be active after reporting profit that beat
analysts’ estimates.  Futures on Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  expiring in
June closed at 8,555 in Chicago on May 18, down from 8,600 in
Osaka, Japan. They were bid in the pre-market at 8,560 in Osaka
at 8:05 a.m. local time. Futures on Australia’s S&P/ASX 200
Index fell 0.2 percent today. New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index dropped
0.3 percent in Wellington.  “It’s very important that a clear way forward is
established” for the  European debt crisis , said Tim Schroeders,
a portfolio manager who helps manage $1 billion in equities at
Pengana Capital Ltd. in Melbourne. “Given we had a number of
false starts until we reached this juncture, people will await a
lot more clarity before reverting to a risk-on stance.”  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPXL1)  lost 0.1 percent
today after the index slid 0.7 percent in  New York  on May 18.  G-8 Meeting  The G-8 leaders who met at Camp David over the weekend
pushed for Greece to stay in the euro area and supported
boosting growth, even as Germany said Europe can’t spend its way
out of the debt crisis. They concurred at U.S. President Barack
Obama’s retreat outside Washington “that the right measures are
not the same for each of us.”  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  fell 5.1 percent last week,
capping the biggest weekly loss since September 2011, as
political chaos in Greece stoked risks the nation will exit the
euro zone and other debt-stricken nations such as Portugal and
Italy may follow.  The Asia Pacific Index dropped 1.1 percent this year
through last week, compared with a 3 percent gain by the S&P 500
and a 2.3 percent loss by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. Stocks in
the Asian benchmark are valued at 11.5 times estimated earnings
on average, compared with 12.3 times for the S&P 500 and 10
times for the Stoxx 600.  Chinese companies traded in the U.S. fell to the lowest
valuations versus the biggest emerging markets in a year. The
Bloomberg China-US Equity Index of the most-traded Chinese
shares in the U.S. dropped 7.2 percent in New York last week to
90.7, the biggest five-day decline since September.  To contact the reporter on this story:
