Nigerian troops said they yesterday
arrested six women, including the widow of the ThisDay newspaper
suicide bomber, in a raid on a hideout of the Islamist militant
group Boko Haram in the central city of Jos.  Boko Haram, which seeks to impose strict Islamic law in
 Nigeria , claimed responsibility for the April 26 attacks on
newspaper offices in Abuja, the capital, and the northern city
of Kaduna that killed at least eight people and injured 34.  “The wife of the bomber of ThisDay Office in Abuja was
arrested,” Colonel Victor Ebhaleme, field operations officer of
the joint  task force  in Borno state, said today by phone from
Maiduguri. Suspected Boko Haram members today shot dead a
civilian in a separate attack in Maiduguri, he said.  Authorities in Nigeria,  Africa ’s top oil producer, blame
Boko Haram for a surge of attacks since 2009 against government
buildings and security forces in the mainly Muslim north and
Abuja. Boko Haram, which means “Western education is a sin,”
claimed responsibility for attacks in Kano on Jan. 20 that
killed at least 256 people.  In yesterday’s raid in Rikkos, a district of Jos, troops
recovered more than 1,000 rounds of ammunition, four improvised
explosive devices, 19 detonators and 10 bags of fertilizers,
Ebhaleme said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
