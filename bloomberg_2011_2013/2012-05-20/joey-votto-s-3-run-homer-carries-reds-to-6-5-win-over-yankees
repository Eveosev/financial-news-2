Joey Votto hit a three-run homer to
help the  Cincinnati Reds  to a 6-5 victory over the  New York 
Yankees in a Major League Baseball interleague contest.  The loss ruined a career-high 12-strikeout performance by
the Yankees’ Ivan Nova before the home fans at Yankee Stadium.  Brandon Phillips had a run-scoring single in the first,
followed by Chris Heisey’s double in the second to gave the Reds
a 2-0 lead.  Russell Martin  hit his fourth home run this season in the
third inning and Raul Ibanez sent Robinson Cano home with a
double in the fourth to tie the game at 2-2.  Votto hit his three-run homer in the fifth, while Jayson Nix hit a home run for the Yankees in the bottom of the inning
to put the score at 5-3.  Philips scored on Mike Costanzo’s sacrifice fly in the
eighth to give the Reds a 6-3 lead.  Nick Swisher  and Nix each
drove in Yankee runs in the ninth.  Homer Bailey (2-3) allowed three runs on seven hits while
striking out seven in 6 1/3 innings. Jose Arredondo got his
first save after pitching a perfect 2/3 inning.  Nova (4-2) gave up five runs on seven hits in six innings
for the Yankees (21-19), who are in fourth place in the five-
team American League East, 5 ½ games behind the  Baltimore
Orioles .  The Reds (20-19) are in second place, 1.5 games behind the
St. Louis Cardinals in the National League Central division.  To contact the reporter on this story:
