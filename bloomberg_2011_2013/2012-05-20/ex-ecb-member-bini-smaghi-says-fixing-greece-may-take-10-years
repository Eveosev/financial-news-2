Greece ’s structural problems may take
up to 10 years to fix and the country may need assistance from
the World Bank to make needed adjustments, former European
Central Bank Executive Board Member Lorenzo  Bini Smaghi  said.  “I think what needs to be done is to have a longer term
perspective,” Bini Smaghi said in an interview with Dublin-
based RTE. “Greece will not be solved in one or two years, it
will take maybe 10 years.”  Greece’s bailout can’t be renegotiated and the country must
continue with adjustments to lower its wage level to be
competitive, Bini Smaghi said. European leaders needs to commit
to taking political action to resolve the European debt crisis
and not leave it to  European Central Bank , he said.  Eurobonds aren’t a “panacea” for the crisis and any shift
to them will be gradual and dependent on the ratification of the
fiscal compact, he said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
