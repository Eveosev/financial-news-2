Brazil central bank President
Alexandre Tombini said the real’s recent declines relative to
the U.S. dollar are in line with losses by other currencies and
that now isn’t the right time to remove a tax on foreign capital
inflows,  O Globo   reported , citing an interview.  The bank is prepared to react to a worsening of the global
economic outlook and the currency’s decline has had a moderate
impact on inflation, Tombini said, according to the article on O
Globo’s website today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
