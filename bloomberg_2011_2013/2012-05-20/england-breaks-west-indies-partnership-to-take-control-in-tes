England dismissed Shivnarine
Chanderpaul and Marlon Samuels in the middle session on day four
of the first cricket Test at Lord’s to leave the West Indies on
265-6 at tea, a lead of 110 runs.  Samuels made 86 runs and Chanderpaul 91 in the visitor’s
second innings. Denesh Ramdin was 23 not out at tea, with Darren
Sammy on 4.  England needs to take four more wickets before beginning
its run chase.   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
