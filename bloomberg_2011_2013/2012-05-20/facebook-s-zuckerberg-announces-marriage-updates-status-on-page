Facebook Inc. (FB)  Chief Executive Officer
 Mark Zuckerberg  announced his marriage to Priscilla Chan on his
Facebook page yesterday. The couple wed in a ceremony in the
backyard of his home in Palo Alto, California, the Associated
Press reported.  Zuckerberg, 28, wed his long-standing girlfriend Chan, 27,
before fewer than 100 guests, who had arrived expecting only to
celebrate Chan’s graduation from medical school, AP said.  The two updated their Facebook pages with a wedding photo,
and changed their relationship statuses to “married.” The
ceremony came after Facebook raised $16 billion in the largest
initial public offering on record for a technology company.  Facebook shares rose 0.6 percent to $38.23 as of 4 p.m. in
 New York  on May 18 after earlier trading at the IPO price of
$38, which valued the company at $104.2 billion. Zuckerberg’s
net worth rose $100 million to $19.4 billion, ranking him 26th
on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, ahead of  Google Inc. (GOOG) ’s
Sergey Brin and  Larry Page .  The Facebook photograph shows Zuckerberg in a suit rather
than his trademark hoodie, and Chan in a white wedding dress.
The pair met at Harvard University, where Zuckerberg founded the
social-networking site in 2004, and have been together for nine
years, AP reported, citing a guest authorized by the couple to
speak.  Zuckerberg, who was named Time magazine’s Person of the
Year in 2010, designed the ring featuring “a very simple
ruby,” AP said, citing the same source.  To contact the reporter on this story:
