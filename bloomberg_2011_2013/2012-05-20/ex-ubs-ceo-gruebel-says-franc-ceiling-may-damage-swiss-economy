The Swiss central bank’s defense of
the franc’s currency ceiling against the euro may cause
“considerable damage” to the nation’s economy,  Oswald Gruebel ,
former chief executive officer of  UBS AG (UBSN) , wrote in Der Sonntag.  The policy means the central bank has lost its independence
and exposes Switzerland to euro-zone debt, Gruebel wrote in the
Swiss  newspaper . The strategy should be reconsidered at some
point, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
