The Muslim Brotherhood’s presidential
hopeful jumped into third place in a weekly poll released days
ahead of the Egyptian vote, while former Arab League Secretary
General Amre Moussa saw his lead narrow.  Mohamed Mursi pushed past rival Islamist candidate Abdel- Moneim Aboul-Fotouh, who dropped to fourth place according to
the poll conducted by the Ahram Center for Strategic and
Political Studies. Mursi secured the support of 14.8 percent of
those surveyed, the state-run Al-Ahram said today, compared with
Aboul-Fotouh’s 14.6 percent. The elections are slated to begin
May 23.  In the previous week’s poll, Mursi had the backing of 9.4
percent of those surveyed. Aboul-Fotouh, who broke ranks with
the Brotherhood, had so far consistently been in the top three.
Moussa, who also served as foreign minister under ousted
President  Hosni Mubarak , saw his lead narrow to 31.7 percent for
the period between May 14-17, from roughly 41 percent the
previous week, according to the Ahram Center’s poll that
surveyed 1,200 people and had a margin of error of 3 percentage
points.  Mubarak’s last prime minister, Ahmed Shafik, was still in
second, with 22.6 percent of those surveyed citing him as their
preferred choice for the presidency.  To contact the reporter on this story:
