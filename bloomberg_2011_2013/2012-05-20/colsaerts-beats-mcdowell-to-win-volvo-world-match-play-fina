Nicolas Colsaerts of  Belgium  beat
Northern Ireland’s Graeme McDowell to win golf’s Volvo World
Match Play final today.  Colsaerts finished 1-up in Andalucia, Spain, to clinch a
first prize of 700,000 euros ($891,000).  The Belgian went ahead four times before finally seeing off
the challenge of McDowell, whom he’d beaten in the quarterfinals
last year.  The win takes Colsaerts into the top 50 of the Official
World Golf Ranking for a first time and lifts him into an
automatic qualifying spot for the Ryder Cup.  Earlier, McDowell defeated Spain’s Rafael Cabrera-Bello by
two holes in the semifinals while Colsaerts beat Paul Lawrie of
Scotland at the 20th hole.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
