U.K. Prime Minister  David Cameron 
said a Greek vote that rejects the terms of the country’s
bailout will send a message that the country is exiting the euro
currency.  “We now have to send a very clear message to people in
 Greece ,” Cameron told reporters in Chicago, where he’s
attending a NATO summit. “You can either vote to stay in the
euro, with all the commitments you’ve made, or, if you vote
another way, you’re effectively voting to leave.”  The comments are the strongest yet by Cameron on the
possibility of a break-up of the single currency. He spent the
Group of Eight leaders’ summit at Camp David urging fellow
European leaders to do more to protect the euro. Today, he
denied the meeting had been a failure, saying it had “helped to
crystallize the thinking.”  There’s no mechanism for a country to leave the euro, and a
Greek exit would increase market pressure on other European
countries deemed to be vulnerable. The yield on a benchmark
Spanish 10-year government bond closed at 6.2 percent at the
close on Friday, close to a five-month high.  Asked if leaders were simply putting off decisions, Cameron
said the Greek vote next month was going to force the issue.  “That is going to focus minds and focus decisions,”
Cameron said. “The crucial thing is that euro-zone leaders have
got to put in place contingency plans for both of those
eventualities, really clear plans to keep our economies safe and
stable. I will do everything in the U.K. to make sure we’re in
that situation too.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
