Punch Taverns Plc (PUB)  plans to offer
lenders control of the company in return for writing off part of
its debt,  the Sunday Times  said, without saying where it got the
information.  Punch, which has 2.3 billion pounds ($3.6 billion) of  debt ,
has started talks with lenders, according to the newspaper. The
company would remain listed, with lenders holding the majority
of its equity and investors a “significant” minority stake,
the Sunday Times said.  A spokesman for Punch, who declined to be identified,
citing the company policy, declined to comment when contacted by
telephone today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
