Egyptian security forces seized a
weapons cache that includes 191 rockets that were believed
headed for Gaza, the  Interior Ministry  said.  Three men were arrested after some of the weapons, which
included anti-aircraft and Grad rockets, were found in two
vehicles, the ministry said in an e-mailed statement today. The
rest, which were believed smuggled in from Libya, were found in
a storage facility, the statement said.  The seizure was the latest in a series of similar
discoveries of weapons that Egyptian authorities maintain are
being routed into the country from Libya. Security in  Egypt â€™s
western neighbor has yet to be restored months after a bloody
uprising that ended with the ouster and subsequent death of
longtime Libyan leader  Muammar Qaddafi .  To contact the reporter on this story:
