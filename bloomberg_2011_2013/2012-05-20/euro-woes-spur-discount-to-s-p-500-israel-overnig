Israeli stocks  traded in the U.S.
fell, sending valuations below the average multiple of Standard
& Poor’s 500 Index members for the first time in two months, on
concern  Europe ’s debt crisis will crimp demand for exports.  The Bloomberg Israel-US Equity Index of the most traded
Israeli companies in the U.S. slid 7.7 percent last week to
80.41. The retreat sent shares to trade at 12 times estimated
earnings, a discount to  S&P 500  companies for the first time
since March 19. Technology companies  Mellanox Technologies Ltd. (MLNX) 
and Allot Communications Ltd. sank in New York to trade at the
biggest discount versus  Tel Aviv  shares in at least three weeks.  Europe, which accounts for about 35 percent of all exports
from Israel, is facing a three-year debt crisis and may remove
 Greece  from the euro currency union because of its failure to
form a government. Almost $4 trillion has been wiped from global
equity markets in May as Moody’s Investors Service lowered debt
ratings at 16 Spanish banks while Greece’s credit rating was
reduced one level by  Fitch Ratings .  “The big problem is that Israel is a big exporter to
Europe so whether it’s Greece or Spain, any negative news is
affecting the companies,” Andrew Uerkwitz, an analyst at
Oppenheimer & Co., said by phone on May 18 from New York.
“People are calling into doubt that things aren’t going to be
as strong.”  The  S&P 500 (SPX)  Index retreated 4.3 percent last week, sending
valuations to 12.3 times estimated earnings, as speculation
about Greece reversed the biggest first-quarter rally since
1998. The Stoxx Europe 600 index declined 5.2 percent.  ‘Negativity Back’  Israel’s  TA-25 benchmark gauge  fell 1.3 percent to 1,067.98
at 9:49 a.m. in Tel Aviv after sliding 4.7 percent last week.
The shares trade at 9.9 times estimated earnings, the lowest in
at least two months, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The Bloomberg-Israel US Equity Index  fell  7.7 percent to
80.41 in New York last week, pushing the shares to the cheapest
level since January.  “Euro zone problems continuing to be around is bringing
the negativity back to the market,”  Jay Srivatsa , managing
director of equity research at Chardan Capital Markets LLC, said
by phone from New York on May 18. “We’re moving to the bearish
outlook versus the bullish. People don’t want to stick around
for the bearish.”  EZchip Semiconductor Ltd. (EZCH) , the  maker  of network processors,
slid 7.5 percent to $37.41 in New York, the sharpest weekly drop
since November. The company’s Tel Aviv shares dropped 5.7
percent today to 143.4 shekels, or the equivalent of $37.50. The
Yokneam, Israel-based company’s U.S. shares trade at 29 times
estimated earnings, about twice the multiple for companies
traded on the  Nasdaq Composite Index. (CCMP)   Even with the drop, “the stocks are still pretty high for
a bad market,” Srivatsa said. “People aren’t going to rush to
buy the stocks at these levels. They probably have a little ways
to go before people really start looking again.”  Biggest Discounts  Shares of Mellanox, the Israeli adapter maker, tumbled 6.7
percent to $54.12 in New York last week, widening the discount
to its Tel Aviv shares to $4.07, the biggest gap since April 26.
The Yokneam Elit, Israel-based company slipped 6.5 percent in
Tel Aviv today to 208.10 shekels, or $54.42.  Barclays Plc chose Mellanox as its top stock of Israeli
companies, according to its global technology outlook report
released May 17 after the close of the market.  Allot (ALLT) , the Hod Hasharon, Israel-based maker of networking
equipment, plunged 7.1 percent to $21.87 in New York, extending
its losses for a second week. The Tel Aviv shares tumbled 8.1
percent today to 84.28 shekels, or the equivalent of $22.04.  Internet Gold  Internet Gold-Golden Lines Ltd. (IGLD) , which owns 31 percent of
Bezeq Israeli Telecommunication Corp. through a third party,
tumbled 30 percent to $3.64 in New York, the biggest drop since
2008. The company’s Tel Aviv shares gained 2.2 percent today to
14.29 shekels, or $3.74.  MagicJack VocalTec Ltd. (CALL) , a Internet phone service provider,
fell 21 percent to $17.74 in New York, the  biggest  slide since
August 2010. Chief Executive Officer Dan Borislow sold an
aggregate of 958,464 ordinary shares to investors, according to
a May 18 statement.  Israel, whose population of 7.8 million is similar in size
to Switzerland’s, has about 60 companies trading on the Nasdaq
Stock Market, the most of any nation outside the U.S. after
 China . Israel is also home to more startup companies per capita
than the U.S.  To contact the reporter on this story:
