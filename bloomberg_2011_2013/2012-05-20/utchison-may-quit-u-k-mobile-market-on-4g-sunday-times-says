Hutchison Whampoa Ltd. (13)  may quit its
mobile-phone business in the U.K. unless it’s guaranteed part of
the fourth-generation spectrum the country will auction at the
end of 2012,  the Sunday Times  reported, without citing anyone.  Canning Fok, managing director at Hutchison, last month
told Prime Minister David Cameron that the company was prepared
to stop investing or quit the telecommunications market without
assurances it would receive a guaranteed allocation at the
planned 4G-spectrum sale, the newspaper said.  Hong Kong-based Hutchison, which runs the 3 mobile network
in the U.K., declined to comment to the Sunday Times.  Laura Cheung, a spokeswoman for Hutchison in Hong Kong,
didn’t immediately reply to a call to her pager today, which is
a public holiday.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
