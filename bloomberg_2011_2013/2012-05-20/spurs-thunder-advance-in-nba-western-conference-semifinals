The San Antonio Spurs rallied to beat
the Los Angeles Clippers 96-86, while the Oklahoma City Thunder
got a 103-100 comeback win over the  Los Angeles Lakers  in the
National Basketball Association’s Western Conference semifinals.  Tony Parker  had 23 points and 10 assists, and  Tim Duncan 
tallied 19 points and 13 rebounds as the Spurs rallied from a
24-point deficit to take a three games to none advantage in the
best-of-seven series.  The Spurs, down by 24 in the second quarter and trailing
53-43 at the half, rallied in the third quarter, outshooting the
Clippers 26-8 at Staples Center in Los Angeles.  “We didn’t plan on being down that much,” Duncan told
reporters. “We stuck with it.”  Blake Griffin had 28 points and 16 rebounds and reserve Mo Williams contributed 19 points to the Clippers who host Game 4
today.  “They came out like we expected, very strong. Blake was
making crazy shots,” Parker said. “We just took our time. It’s
a long game, a very long game. At halftime, we were very calm.”  The winner of the series will play the Lakers or the
Thunder, who host Game 5 in their series tomorrow.  At Staples Center,  Kevin Durant  hit a 25-foot 3-pointer
with 13 seconds left to put the Thunder ahead 101-98. James Harden sealed the win five seconds later with two free throws to
give the Thunder a 3-1 lead in their series.  Russell Westbrook  scored 37 points and Durant had 31 points
and 13 rebounds for the Thunder as they fought back from a 13-
point deficit.  Kobe Bryant , who sunk a basket at the buzzer, scored 38
points and Andrew Bynum contributed 18 for the Lakers. Los
Angeles had a 56-46 halftime lead.  In an Eastern Conference semifinal tonight, the Miami Heat
travel to the Indiana Pacers, who have a 2-1 lead in their
series.  To contact the reporter on this story:
