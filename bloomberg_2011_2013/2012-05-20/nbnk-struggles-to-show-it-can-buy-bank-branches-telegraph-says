NBNK Investments Plc (NBNK)  is struggling to
demonstrate to  Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY)  that it has sufficient
capital to buy the 632 branches the bank is selling, the  Sunday
Telegraph reported , citing unidentified people.  Talks between NBNK and Lloyds have yet to begin and the
only communication between the two parties in the month since
NBNK was admitted to the sale process has been written
correspondence, the newspaper reported.  NBNK said its management team has met with Lloyds
executives to pave the way for negotiations, according to the
Telegraph.  To contact the reporter on this story:
