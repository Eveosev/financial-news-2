Libya ’s crude oil output has risen to
“almost” 1.6 million barrels a day, Nuri Berruien, chairman of
the state-run National Oil Corp., said in a telephone interview
from Tripoli.  The North African country, which is rebuilding its oil
industry after the war that ousted former leader  Muammar Qaddafi 
last year, produced 1.465 million barrels a day in March,
Berruien said on March 31. Libya holds the continent’s largest
oil reserves, according to data from BP Plc, and pumped 1.6
million barrels a day before the conflict halted most of its
crude exports.  Operations at Ras Lanuf, Libya’s largest oil refinery, will
resume as soon as National Oil sells oil products and about 1
million barrels of substandard crude that are left over from the
Qaddafi era and stored at the plant, Berruien said. The facility
has a processing capacity of 220,000 barrels a day, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
