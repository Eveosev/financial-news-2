Irelandâ€™s central bank plans to ask
the boards of three state-supported lenders to take direct
responsibility for ensuring management is implementing measures
to resolve increasing mortgage arrears, the  Sunday Business Post 
reported, without saying where it got the information.  Officials from the central bank will attend board meetings
of Bank of Ireland Plc,  Allied Irish Banks Plc (ALBK)  and Permanent TSB
to express displeasure with progress in dealing with mortgage
arrears, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
