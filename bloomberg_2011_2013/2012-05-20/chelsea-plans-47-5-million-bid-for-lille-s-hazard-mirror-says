Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich has
sanctioned a 30 million-pound ($47.5 million) move for Lille
winger Eden Hazard, the Sunday Mirror  reported .  The Blues, who yesterday won European’s soccer’s  Champions
League , may pay the Belgian player wages of almost 200,000
pounds a week, the newspaper said, without citing anyone.   Manchester City and  Manchester United  are also interested
in Hazard, 21, although City this week was unable to agree to
terms with the player’s representatives, the Mirror reported.  Lille plans to open official talks with the three English
clubs tomorrow, the newspaper added.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
