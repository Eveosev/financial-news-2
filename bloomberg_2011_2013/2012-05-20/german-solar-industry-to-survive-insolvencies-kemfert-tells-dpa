The German solar industry will last
regardless of the recent insolvency filings of some members,
Claudia Kemfert, senior energy analyst at the DIW economic
institute in Berlin, was cited as saying in an interview with
Deutsche Presseagentur.  Solar is an industry for the future and employs 120,000
workers in  Germany , the newswire cited Kemfert as saying. The
recent market consolidations were to be expected, Kemfert said,
according to DPA.  To contact the reporter on this story:
