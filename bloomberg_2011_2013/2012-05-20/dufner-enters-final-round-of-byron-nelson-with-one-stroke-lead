Jason Dufner  enters the final round
of golf’s Byron Nelson Championship with a one-stroke lead after
firing a 1-under 69 yesterday.  Dufner had a bogey and two birdies during yesterday’s round,
leaving him at 8-under 202 for the first three rounds at TPC
Four Seasons Resort in Irving Texas.  “I feel good with where my game is at, what I’m doing out
there, getting more comfortable playing in final groups and
getting more comfortable trying to win these tournaments,”
Dufner told reporters. “I think the more you do it the more
comfortable you’re going to be, and the more successful you are,
it’s going to carry over.”  J.J. Henry and Jason Day shot 3-under 67 to share second
place with Dicky Pride, who had a 69 yesterday, at 7-under 203.
 Vijay Singh  was next at 6-under 204.  Day, the 2010 Byron Nelson winner, missed moving into the
lead with Dufner when he carded a bogey on the final hole.  “The first putt wasn’t the greatest, but the second was a
decent putt, and I just hit it too hard through the break,” Day
said. “One day that hole will pay me back, and hopefully it’s
tomorrow.”  Pride birdied five and seven, but didn’t make another
during the remainder of his round and dropped a stroke at 12,
where he twice found the rough and missed a lengthy par putt.  Henry was at three-under after a bogey at No. 8, but he
birdied four of his next eight holes to get to 7-under.  A second cut yesterday eliminated eight players whose
scores missed the 4-over cutoff, leaving 71 players.  To contact the reporter on this story:
