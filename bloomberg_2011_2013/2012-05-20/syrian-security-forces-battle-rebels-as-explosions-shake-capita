Syrian forces battled rebels on the
outskirts of Damascus and several loud explosions shook the
capital as more than 14 months of fighting to topple President
Bashar al-Assad showed no sign of abating.  Blasts could be heard since dawn today in Damascus and
fighting erupted at a checkpoint on a bridge in the area of Kafr
Sousa, the U.K.-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said
in an e-mailed statement. The death toll yesterday was at least
18, it said. The  Local Coordination Committees , an opposition
group, reported 29 killed yesterday.  More than 9,000 people have been slain by Assad’s forces
since March 2011, when protests began as part of the wave of
uprisings in the  Middle East , according to a United Nations
estimate in late March. Violence continues almost two months
after Assad and opposition forces accepted a peace plan by UN
special envoy  Kofi Annan .  Syria  today denied a report by Al Jazeera television citing
rebel leaders as saying that the Free Syrian Army killed senior
government officials, including Assad’s brother-in-law Assef
Shawkat, Defense Minister Dawoud Rajiha and Interior Minister
Mohammed al-Shaar. The claim was part of a “campaign of lies
and slander,” the official Syrian Arab News Agency said, citing
al-Shaar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
