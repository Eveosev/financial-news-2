Groupe Eurotunnel SA (GET)  expects delays
of more than four hours to its services this summer because of
insufficient border control staff, the  Sunday Times reported ,
citing unidentified people at the company.  Eurotunnel has cut the number of bookings available to car,
lorry and coach customers using the link between the U.K. and
France in order to ease expected congestion, the Times said.  The company is concerned that the diversion of U.K.
immigration staff to Londonâ€™s Heathrow airport during the
 Olympic Games  will leave the Channel Tunnel inadequately
covered, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
