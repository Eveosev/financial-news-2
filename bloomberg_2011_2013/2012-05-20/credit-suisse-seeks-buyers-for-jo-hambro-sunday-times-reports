Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN)  is selling JO
Hambro Investment Management,  the Sunday Times  reported, without
citing anyone.  Credit Suisse bought London-based JO Hambro, which employs
about 100 people, in 2001 for 100 million pounds ($158 million),
according to the newspaper. It may now be worth about 60 million
pounds, the newspaper said.  A spokeswoman for Credit Suisse in London declined to
comment on the report.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
