Juergen Stark, a former member of the
 European Central Bank ’s executive board, said the euro would
survive  Greece  leaving the common currency, Die Welt reported,
citing an interview.  The euro will last and its future isn’t dependent on a
certain number of members or a particular country remaining one,
the newspaper cited Stark as saying. He called a German exit
“unthinkable” and the idea the country could return to the
deutsche mark was “pure nostalgia,” Die Welt said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
