QinetiQ Group Plc (QQ/)  is planning joint
ventures for the first time to develop simulation and training
projects and a fiber-optic cable product called OptaSense, the
 Sunday Telegraph reported , without saying where it got the
information.  QinetiQ’s Chief Executive Officer Leo Quinn is seeking to
split the company’s business into three units, according to the
newspaper. The core division will focus on defense and aerospace
technologies, such as remote bomb-disposal devices, while the
other two will carry out more experimental research, the
