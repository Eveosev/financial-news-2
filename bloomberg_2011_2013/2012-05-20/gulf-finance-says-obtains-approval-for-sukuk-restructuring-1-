Gulf Finance House E.C. (GFH) , a Bahraini
investment bank implementing a recapitalization plan, said it
obtained approval from sukuk holders to restructure $110 million
of debt.  Holders of the Islamic bonds agreed to extend the maturity
to June 2018, with a two-year grace period for the principal
repayment amount in 2012 and 2013, the lender said in an e-
mailed statement.  “With the approval to restructure Gulf Finance House’s
sukuk, we are now in a better position to accelerate growth
initiatives for the future,” acting Chief Executive Officer
Hisham al-Rayes said, according to the statement. “We are
targeting to extend the maturities of our debt over a longer
term to retain our key assets.”  Gulf Finance’s floating rate sukuk was due July 26 with an
outstanding payment of $137.7 million, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The bank sold the five-year Islamic bonds
in 2007 at 125 basis points over the three-month London
Interbank Offered Rate. The rate was increased by 50 basis
points after the bank’s investment grade was reduced to junk,
according to the data.  The lender said on May 15 first quarter-profit dropped 92
percent to $1 million from $11.9 million in the same period last
year.  Gulf Finance House shares dropped 1 percent to 49.50 fils
at the close in  Kuwait City  today.  The shares , also listed in
Dubai and Bahrain, gained 22 percent in Kuwait Stock Exchange
this year, compared to a 10.45 percent rise in the benchmark
 index .  To contact the reporter on this story:
