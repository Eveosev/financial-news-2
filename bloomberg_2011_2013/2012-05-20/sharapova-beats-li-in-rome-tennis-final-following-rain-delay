Maria Sharapova  beat Li Na in three
sets in a rain-affected final of the Rome International tennis
tournament today, claiming victory in a tie-break following a
delay of over 2 1/2 hours. The men’s final between Novak Djokovic and  Rafael Nadal  was postponed until tomorrow.  Russia’s Sharapova, the defending champion, was tied at 6-6
with China’s Li before the break for rain. The 25-year-old took
the tie-break 7-5 when play resumed.  Sharapova, who collects her 26th WTA Tour title, lost the
opening set 6-4 and trailed 4-0 in the second before rallying to
win eight straight games.  She led 4-1 in the third set before Li recovered and had to
save a match point in the final game to stop the Chinese player
from claiming the title.  Li’s defeat leaves her without a title since last year’s
French Open. The year’s second Grand Slam, the only one to be
played on clay, starts May 27 in Paris.  World No. 1 Djokovic of Serbia will play third-ranked Nadal
of Spain in the men’s final tomorrow afternoon. Djokovic is the
defending champion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
