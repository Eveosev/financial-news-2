The  European Central Bank  increased
the limit of the Emergency Liquidity Assistance program for
Greek banks to 100 billion euros ($127.8 billion) from 90
billion euros,  Der Spiegel  reported, without saying where it got
the information.  The decision was taken at the May 15 meeting of the ECB
council, the magazine said in a preview of an article for its
next edition. The ELA program allows the Greek central bank to
supply liquidity to lenders cut off from regular ECB refinancing
because they canâ€™t provide adequate collateral.  To contact the reporter on this story:
