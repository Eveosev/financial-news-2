Duke University  advanced to the
semifinals of the men’s national college lacrosse tournament for
the sixth straight year, routing Colgate University to set up a
third meeting this season with the University of  Maryland .  The third-seeded Blue Devils beat the unseeded Raiders 17-6
yesterday, while No. 4  University of Notre Dame  defeated the
defending champion University of Virginia 12-10.  Duke (15-4) and  Notre Dame  (13-2) join Maryland (11-5) and
top-seeded Loyola University of Maryland (16-1) in the final
four of the National Collegiate Athletic Association tournament.
Loyola beat Denver 10-9 two days ago, when unseeded Maryland
upset No. 2 Johns Hopkins 11-5.  The semifinals are May 26 with the championship game two
days later at Gillette Stadium in Foxborough,  Massachusetts .  Duke’s Robert Rotanz scored five goals yesterday as the
Blue Devils improved to 7-2 all-time against Colgate and won its
first NCAA tournament meeting against the Raiders. It was Duke’s
13th visit to the NCAA tournament quarterfinals, while Colgate
was among the final eight for the first time.  Duke and Atlantic Coast Conference rival Maryland now meet
for the third time in 2012, as the Blue Devils lost 10-7 on the
road on March 3 and then beat the Terrapins 6-5 in the ACC
tournament semifinals on April 20.  Notre Dame, whose only trip to the title game ended in
defeat in 2010 to Duke, has won 12 of its past 13 games after
ousting No. 5  Virginia  behind three goals from Max Pfeifer.  It was the seventh all-time meeting between the fifth-
seeded Cavaliers and Fighting Irish, and the first since the
2006 NCAA Tournament, when Virginia captured one of its four
national titles under coach Dom Starsia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
