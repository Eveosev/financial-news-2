(Corrects stake sold in first paragraph.)  Discount Investment Corp. (DISI)  jumped the
most since August after its parent company IDB Development Corp.

since Aug. 14 to 9.972 shekels at 10:11 a.m. in  Tel Aviv .  Discount announced the deal, which gives Clal a value of
2.55 billion shekels.  To contact the reporter on this story:
