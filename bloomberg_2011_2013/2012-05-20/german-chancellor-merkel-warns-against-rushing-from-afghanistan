German  Chancellor Angela Merkel  said
NATO members and their allies shouldn’t rush to leave
Afghanistan, signaling tension within the alliance over France’s
vow to leave by year’s end.  Allies in Afghanistan that entered the conflict should
withdraw together and  Germany  will “resolutely defend” that
stance, Merkel told reporters today at the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization summit in Chicago.  France’s new president,  Francois Hollande , said on May 18
that he will keep to his campaign pledge to withdraw French
combat troops from Afghanistan by the end of this year, sooner
than the U.S. and other allies plan.  NATO members gathering in Chicago are seeking to reach
consensus on the way ahead in Afghanistan, a task that will test
U.S. President  Barack Obama ’s diplomatic skills and the
political cohesion of the 63-year-old group.  German Foreign Minister  Guido Westerwelle  said a rapid
unraveling of allied support in Afghanistan risks losing ground
gained in recent years.  “A race to withdrawal would only strengthen those who want
to sow insecurity,” Westerwelle said in Chicago.  Nations involved in the conflict should “stick with what
we agreed” to for a timetable to turn over security
responsibility to Afghan forces, Westerwelle said.  Obama has a 2014 deadline for NATO to transfer all combat
operations to Afghan security forces. Last year he said that the
33,000 U.S. troops sent in to stabilize the conflict will
withdraw by September 2012, just before the U.S. election.  To contact the reporter on this story:
