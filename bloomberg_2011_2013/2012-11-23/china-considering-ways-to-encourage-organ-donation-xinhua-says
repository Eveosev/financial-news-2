China  is considering ways to
encourage people to donate their organs after it phases out a
policy of relying on executed prisoners, the Xinhua News Agency
reported today.  The government is planning to offer organ donors
compensation such as lower medical fees, tax reductions,
“favorable” tuition fees and funeral expenses, the report
said, quoting Huang Jiefu, China’s vice minister for health. The
compensation will be mostly undertaken by the Red Cross Society
of China, Xinhua said, citing Huang’s comments at an event in
Guangzhou this week.  China plans to end its reliance on organ transplants from
condemned prisoners within two years, after the successful trial
of a human organ donation project, the  news agency  reported,
citing Huang.  To contact the reporter on this story:
