Just a few weeks ago  Harvard Business Review  and McKinsey & Co. opened the first leg of their 2012/13 M-Prize challenge: " Innovating Innovation ." The M-Prize's overall goal is to "surface the world's most progressive management practices and most provocative management ideas" and connect and celebrate individuals reinventing management. This particular challenge — where I'm serving as a judge — seeks "real-world case studies and bold ideas that demonstrate how every element of a company's management model can be retooled to make it innovation-friendly." The themes of the challenge overlap significantly with an e-book that I wrote with my colleague David Duncan called  Building a Growth Factory . The book's central theme is that companies can improve their ability to create growth through innovation by developing four key management systems (click  here  for more details): a growth blueprint; production systems that translate ideas into booming growth businesses; governance and controls that track and allocate resources; and appropriate leadership, talent and culture.  Given the overlaps, Dave and I wanted to highlight four areas where we would be excited to see fresh thinking and case studies — exactly the sort of thing the M-Prize was designed to encourage. Approaching innovation-driven growth systematically is no easy task. While we believe that the framework we propose in  Building a Growth Factory  is an important step forward, there still are a number of unanswered questions. We look forward to seeing inspiring ideas and case studies from the world's innovation talent.
