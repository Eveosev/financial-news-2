More than 100 children in  Romania 
have been sickened by a tuberculosis vaccine made in  Denmark ,
the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control said in a
 report  on its website today.  The children had symptoms including swollen lymph nodes and
abscesses, and 50 of the 115 children have been hospitalized
since March, the Stockholm-based ECDC said, citing Romanian
media reports. Romanian Health Minister Raed Arafat said in a
televised address yesterday that TB vaccinations would stop
until the cause of the side effects is determined.  The vaccine was made by  Statens Serum Institut , a
Copenhagen-based unit of Denmark’s health ministry, Nils
Strandberg Pedersen, the institute’s chief executive officer,
said by phone today. Lymph node swelling is a “completely
normal” side effect of the  bacille Calmette-Guerin vaccine  that
the institute has made for more than 50 years, Pedersen said.  “Whether the number is above the threshold that is
normally seen, I cannot say,” Pedersen said, adding that the
institute had received “only a few reports of side effects” so
far. “Abscesses are more rare, but also seen as a consequence
of the vaccine.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
