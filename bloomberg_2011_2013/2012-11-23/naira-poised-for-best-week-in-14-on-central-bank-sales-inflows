Nigeria ’s naira advanced, poised for
its best weekly gain in 14, after the central bank sold the most
dollars in eight weeks and on foreign-currency inflows into the
West African nation’s bonds.  The currency of  Africa ’s biggest oil producer rallied for a
third day, climbing 0.1 percent to 157.4 a dollar at 11:10 a.m.
in Lagos, the commercial capital. The naira has appreciated 0.7
percent this week, the most since the five days ended Aug. 17.  The central bank  sold $400 million  at foreign-currency
auctions this week, the most in eight. The regulator sells
dollars on Mondays and Wednesdays to keep the naira within a 3
percent band around 155 a dollar. Nigeria sold 116.18 billion
naira ($728 million) of Treasury bills and 50 billion of bonds
on Nov. 21.  The central bank’s sales and foreign-currency inflows into
the fixed-income markets “are the main factors” supporting the
currency this week, Jide Solanke, an analyst at First Securities
Discount House Ltd, said by phone today from Lagos. “We expect
stability in the naira.”  The naira’s appreciation could be traced to tight monetary
conditions, improved supply of foreign exchange to the market by
 oil companies  and increased inflows from portfolio investors,
central bank Governor Lamido Sanusi said Nov. 20 after the
regulator held its benchmark rate at a record-high 12 percent.  Inflation, which accelerated for the first time in four
months to 11.7 percent in October on widespread flooding of
farms, is still above the bank’s target of less than 10 percent.  JPMorgan Chase & Co. added Nigerian bonds to its benchmark
emerging-market index series last month, predicting the
inclusion may lure $1.5 billion to sub-Saharan Africa’s second-
largest economy. Barclays will add Nigeria to its local-currency
government bond index in March, it said Nov. 6. The credit
rating of sub-Saharan Africa’s second-largest economy was raised
one level on Nov. 7 to BB- by  Standard & Poor’s .  Yields on 10-year naira debt fell six basis points to 12.21
percent, according to yesterday’s prices compiled on the
Financial Markets Dealers Association website. Borrowing costs
on the nation’s $500 million of Eurobonds due January 2021
declined one basis point to 4.39 percent  Ghana ’s cedi weakened a fourth day, slipping 0.1 percent to
1.8975 per dollar in Accra, the capital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
