GDF Suez (GSZ)  SA, France’s biggest
distributor of natural gas, is taking the government to court
over its decision to cap a fourth-quarter increase in regulated
fuel rates.  The case was filed earlier this month at the Conseil
d’Etat, the country’s highest court, according to Jerome Chambin, a spokesman for GDF Suez.  The former monopoly’s third complaint in a year over energy
prices follows a similar one by Anode, a group of rival
distributors. The gas companies are mounting legal challenges
against successive French government decisions to limit
increases in gas prices to obtain rates that cover the cost of
imported supplies.  GDF Suez, which is 35 percent owned by the state, was
allowed to raise gas prices for households by 2 percent from
October, less than half of the increase it had requested. The
government said at the time its decision was based on the need
to safeguard the interests of consumers.  France ’s regulator ruled the latest increase should have
been 6.1 percent for households in order for distributors to
cover their costs of supply.  Anode and GDF Suez also took the former government to court
a year ago after being prevented from passing on supply costs to
consumers. The court ruled in their favor.  Les Echos reported today that a change in gas prices
related to the cost of supply may result in an increase of less
than 1 percent.  The Conseil d’Etat is scheduled to hear Anode’s latest
challenge Nov. 27, according to a court official.  To contact the reporter on this story:
