 The pound stayed little changed
against the dollar after a British Bankers Association report
showed U.K. mortgage approvals rose last month.  The pound traded little changed at $1.5931 as of 9:32 a.m.
London time. It was 0.1 percent weaker at 80.95 pence per euro.  Banks granted 33,039 loans for house purchase compared with
an upwardly revised 31,544 in September, the BBA said in an e-
mailed statement in London today. Approvals had been expected to
rise to 32,000 from an original September figure of 31,175,
according to median of 11 forecasts in a Bloomberg News survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
