The Australian dollar was poised for
a gain this week after global stocks rallied, buoying demand for
riskier assets.  Ten-year bond  yields  climbed to the highest in almost a
month amid speculation European finance ministers will agree on
an aid package for  Greece . Data this week also indicated
manufacturing is improving in  China ,  Australia ’s largest trading
partner, boosting demand for the so-called Aussie. The  New
Zealand dollar  headed for a weekly advance.  “There is some possible momentum building for maybe a
shift back towards $1.05 given the way the Aussie rejected that
move below $1.03,” said Jim Vrondas, a manager at online
foreign-exchange dealer OzForex Ltd. in Sydney. The Australian
currency could rise above $1.0420 early next week, he said.  The Australian dollar bought $1.0396 as of 4:50 p.m. in
Sydney from $1.0390 yesterday and $1.0339 at the end of last
week. The currency fell as low as $1.0288 on Nov. 16 and climbed
as high as $1.0425 on Nov. 20. The Aussie’s implied three-month
volatility fell to 7.4 percent, the lowest since October 2007.  The New Zealand dollar bought 81.67 U.S. cents from 81.59
yesterday and 81.27 on Nov. 16.  The  MSCI World (MXWO)  Index of  stocks  added 0.5 percent yesterday
and is up 3 percent this week. The MSCI Asia Pacific Excluding
 Japan  index of stocks gained 0.6 percent today. Markets in Japan
are closed today for a holiday, while the U.S. was shut
yesterday for Thanksgiving.  Bonds Decline  Aussie bonds fell today, pushing the yield on 10-year notes
up to 3.30 percent, the most since Oct. 26, from 3.25 percent
yesterday.  Bond rates climbed and the Australian dollar was supported
even as swaps traders added to bets that the  Reserve Bank  of
Australia will lower its benchmark rate from 3.25 percent when
it meets in December. Data compiled by Bloomberg indicate
traders see a 64 percent chance that policy makers will lower
the rate to 3 percent on Dec. 4, up from a 58 percent
probability yesterday.  The improving outlook for the Chinese economy has helped
buoy risk sentiment this week, with a private report on
manufacturing released yesterday indicating expansion for the
first time in 13 months. A preliminary reading of the by HSBC
Holdings Plc and Markit Economics purchasing managers index for
November was 50.4, compared with a final level of 49.5 in
October. Figures above 50 indicate growth.  In  Europe , finance ministers are scheduled to meet on Nov.
26 to discuss unlocking bailout funds for Greece. They failed
to reach an agreement after 11-hour talks broke up on Nov. 21.  “If anything from Europe, we’re probably going to get a
little bit more positive sentiment coming over the next week,”
said OzForex’s Vrondas. “It should only be relatively short-
lived, but probably going to be enough” to lift the Australian
dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
