Technip SA (TEC) , Europe’s second-largest
oilfield-services provider, expects a 2012 margin in line with
past years and sales of about 8 billion euros ($10.4 billion).  “The perspectives are good,” Chief Executive Officer
Thierry Pilenko said today at an investor conference. “This
year was robust with good profitability.”  This year’s margin will be around 10 percent, in line with
previous years, he said.  Technip reported last month a 21 percent increase in third-
quarter profit and raised targets for the full year after  oil
companies  pushed ahead with projects.  Technip said it’s seeking revenue “toward” 8 billion
euros and a subsea operating margin of around 15 percent and a
margin for onshore-offshore of 6.5 percent to 7 percent.  Europe’s largest oilfield-services provider is Italy’s
 Saipem SpA. (SPM)   To contact the reporter on this story:
