Centrais Eletricas Brasileiras SA (ELET6) ,
South America’s largest power generator, advanced in Sao Paulo
trading, snapping a five-day losing streak that pushed it to the
lowest in 10 years.  The state-run utility’s preferred shares jumped 4.1 percent
to 7.60 reais at 4:15 p.m. local time after surging as much as
10 percent. The gain pared this week’s decline to 34 percent.
The benchmark index gained 1.3 percent today and is up 3.2
percent in the past five days.  Eletrobras, as the utility is known, has plunged 51 percent
this month, the most among members on the MSCI  Brazil /Utilities
index, on concern President  Dilma Rousseff ’splan for rate cuts
of as much as 28 percent will erode profits. The prospect that
the stock price may have hit bottom probably has some traders
covering short positions, or bets on price declines, according
to Marcel Kussaba, the head of equity research at Quantitas
Asset Management.  “Eletrobras’s advance today is purely a technical move,
because it’s impossible now to make a valuation based on the
company’s fundamentals,” Kussaba said by phone from  Porto
Alegre , Brazil. “Nobody knows yet the size of the losses it
will suffer because of the new rules.”  The government is offering Eletrobras 14 billion reais
($6.7 billion) in cash as compensation for agreeing to modify
rates laid out in contracts set to expire in 2015 and 2017, less
than half the 30 billion reais the company had said it expected
to receive.  To contact the reporter on this story:
