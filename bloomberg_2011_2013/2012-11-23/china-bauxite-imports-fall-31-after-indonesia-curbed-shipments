Chinese imports of  bauxite  fell 31
percent from a year earlier last month after  Indonesia  curbed
mineral exports, restricting seaborne shipments of the ore used
to make aluminum.  Total deliveries to  China  slid to 2.14 million metric tons
from 3.09 million tons in October 2011, according to customs
figures. Imports from Indonesia plunged 56 percent to 1.05
million tons, the data showed.  Limits imposed by Indonesia on raw-material exports since
May will cut seaborne trade in bauxite by 5 percent this year,
Clarkson Plc, the largest shipbroker, said in a report published
yesterday. Courts in the country, which accounted for 49 percent
of last year’s 82 million tons of global shipments, annulled
parts of the laws in November, it showed.  “A lack of clarity over future Indonesian export policies
has made the outlook for bauxite trade uncertain,” Clarkson
said. “It is clear that if shipments are restricted, it would
not be simple to quickly replace any lost Indonesian supply.”  Supplies of the ore from  Australia  are limited, according
to Clarkson. The country increased bauxite exports to China by
11 percent so far this year, according to customs figures.  China, the world’s largest producer of aluminum, accounted
for 77 percent of growth in bauxite export trade between 2002
and 2011, the shipbroker said.  Overall imports of the ore into China fell 8.7 percent in
this year’s first 10 months from a year earlier, the customs
figures showed. Deliveries climbed 49 percent last year from
2010, when they jumped 53 percent in annual terms.  To contact the reporter on this story:
