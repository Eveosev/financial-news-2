Carson Yeung, who controls English
soccer club Birmingham City, lost a bid to delay his trial on
money laundering charges until June.  Hong Kong District Court Judge Stanley Chan today dismissed 
the argument of Yeung’s lawyer that the freezing of the
businessman’s assets has prevented him hiring a defense team to
prepare for trial next week. The court action will begin on Nov.
28 as scheduled, Chan said.  Birmingham International Holdings Ltd. (2309) , the West Midlands-
based team’s parent company, has been suspended in Hong Kong
since June 2011 when its chairman Yeung was charged with five
counts of money laundering with a total value of HK$721.3
million ($93 million). Yeung has posted HK$8 million in bail and
was refused permission to leave Hong Kong.  Yeung bought the team, which was relegated from the elite
Premier League in 2011, for 81.5 million pounds ($130 million)
in 2009. Birmingham International said last month it was in
talks with two possible buyers of the team.  The company also announced last month that its auditor BDO
had resigned citing reservations over its internal controls and
further delaying the release of its results.  The case is Hong Kong SAR v. Yeung Ka-sing Carson,
DCCC860/2011 in the Hong Kong District Court.  To contact the reporter on this story:
