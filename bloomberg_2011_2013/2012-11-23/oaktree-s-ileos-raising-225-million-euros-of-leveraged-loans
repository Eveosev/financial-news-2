Oaktree Capital Group LLC (OAK)  is seeking
225 million euros ($290 million) of loans for its Ileos Group
unit, a packaging company for beauty products it bought at the
end of last year.  Lenders are invited to investor presentations in Paris and
 London  on Nov. 28 and Nov. 29, respectively, according to an
statement from arranger Goldman Sachs Group Inc. The senior
secured loans include a 195 million-euro seven-year term loan B
paying an interest margin of 500 basis points more than
benchmarks, it said. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  Oaktree Capital acquired Nanterre, France-based Ileos in
December 2011 from 21 Centrale Partners. Ileos then agreed to
buy U.S. perfume-bottle maker Le Papillon last month for about
53 million euros, according to Goldman Sachs.  The other portions of the deal are a 15 million-euro six-
year revolving credit facility and a 15 million-euro six-year
debt earmarked for acquisitions, both paying an interest margin
of 475 basis points. The term loan B includes a portion that
will be available in dollars. Libor, a rate banks say they can
borrow from each other, will have a 1.25 percent floor.  The company’s leverage ratio, measuring its debt level to
earnings, will be 3.67 times, according to the statement.  Under a revolver, money repaid can be borrowed again. Term
Loan B’s are typically sold to non-bank investors such as
collateralized loan obligations, bank loan mutual funds and
 hedge funds .  To contact the reporter on this story:
