Croatia’s new property tax, which
the government plans to introduce from April 1, may erode
commercial banks’ profits through ensuing lower market values
for property,  Poslovni Dnevnik  reported, citing the  central
bank .  A systemic change of the market value of property could
affect the banks’ business results, the central bank said,
according to the Zagreb-based business newspaper. Property
prices may fall as higher taxes will be levied on second and
third homes and many people would try to sell them, the
newspaper said.  Such a change would not affect the banks’ capital adequacy,
Poslovni cited the central bank as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
