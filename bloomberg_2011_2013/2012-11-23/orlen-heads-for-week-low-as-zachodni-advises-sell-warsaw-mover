PKN Orlen SA (PKN)  slid to a week-low
after Bank Zachodni WBK SA recommended selling  Poland ’s biggest
oil refiner on expectations of lower refining margins.  The  stock  declined 0.5 percent to 45.76 zloty, the lowest
since Nov. 16, at the close in Warsaw. Trading volume was 45
percent of the daily average over the past three months,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Zachodni initiated coverage of Orlen with a share-price
estimate of 41.5 zloty, compared with a 40.37 zloty  average  from
15 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  “Operating results for the refinery segment are likely to
fall in 2013,” Tomasz Kasowicz, a Warsaw-based analyst at
Zachodni, said in a note today. The petrochemical margins may
also come under pressure in the next two years as “new, export-
oriented poly-olefin capacities from the U.S. may begin to flood
European markets,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
