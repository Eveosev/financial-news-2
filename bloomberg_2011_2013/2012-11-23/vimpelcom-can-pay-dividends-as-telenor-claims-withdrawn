Russia agreed to withdraw legal
claims against  Telenor ASA (TEL) , allowing the Norwegian phone
company’s affiliate  VimpelCom Ltd. (VIP)  to distribute dividends to
investors including billionaire Mikhail Fridman’s  Altimo .  The claims were removed after Altimo increased its stake in
VimpelCom, making it the telecommunications company’s largest
shareholder, the Federal Antimonopoly Service, or FAS, said
today in a  statement  on its website. VimpelCom jumped 3.2
percent to $11.03 by 9:55 a.m. in  New York , the biggest advance
since Nov. 1.  FAS said in April that Telenor had no right to increase its
holding in VimpelCom to a level exceeding Russian shareholders’
ownership without state approval. It also won a Moscow court
ruling banning VimpelCom from paying dividends.  Since then, Altimo bought more shares from Egyptian
billionaire  Naguib Sawiris  and other investors, boosting its
stake to 47.9 percent of voting shares versus Fornebu, Norway-
based Telenor’s 43 percent.  VimpelCom Chief Executive Officer Jo Lunder said on Nov. 14
that the supervisory board may recommend dividend payments for
2011 and 2012 after the injunctions are lifted. VimpelCom has a
policy to pay a dividend of at least 80 U.S. cents a share.  The withdrawal of the claims against Telenor still needs
formal court approval, with a hearing scheduled for Nov. 27.
“VimpelCom awaits a formal decision from the Moscow Arbitration
Court on the withdrawal request and an official removal of the
injunctions,” the company said in a statement today.  Telenor  declined  0.7 percent to 116.3 kroner in Oslo,
paring its advance this year to 19 percent. Vimpelcom has gained
16 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
