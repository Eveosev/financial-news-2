Oak River Insurance Co., a
subsidiary of  Warren Buffett ’s  Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A) , asked
clients to guard against identity theft after an employee
released some of their personal information.  The data are tied to about 2,700 workers’ compensation
claimants who had spinal surgery in Southern California between
2004 and 2011 or had urinalysis testing, diagnostics or other
medical treatment performed in the state between 2006 and 2011,
the unit of Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire said in a Nov. 21
 statement  posted online. The personal information included
medical records, Social Security numbers and health insurance
information, the insurer said.  Oak River is seeking to protect clients against identity
theft by offering them a free one-year subscription to a product
that helps detect misuse of personal information. A former
employee, while still working at the insurer, disclosed the data
between October 2011 and March 2012 to individuals cooperating
in an investigation of suppliers of medical services.  “We do not believe that access to individuals’ Social
Security numbers or other identifying information was the goal
of the disclosures,” the insurer said in the statement.  Oak River said it was unaware of any identity theft that
had occurred as a result of the disclosures.  To contact the reporter on this story:
