Nigeria,  Africa ’s largest oil
producer, plans to ship five cargoes of Bonga crude in January,
the same number as December, according to a loading program
obtained by Bloomberg News.  Three of the cargoes will be of 997,500 barrels and two of
1 million, the plan showed. The schedule for Qua Iboe, the
country’s benchmark grade, isn’t yet available. Loading programs
are monthly schedules of crude shipments compiled by field
operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan their supply and
trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
