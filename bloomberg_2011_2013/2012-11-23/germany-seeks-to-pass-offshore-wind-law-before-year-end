German Environment Minister  Peter Altmaier  said he is seeking to pass a law that will to provide
investment security for the offshore wind industry before the
end of the year.  Altmaier said he’s “very optimistic” that an agreement
can be reached on who is liable for delays in connecting sea-
based wind farms to the power grid, an issue that caused
utilities including EON SE and  RWE AG (RWE)  to postpone investments.  “It’s right to pass the law before year-end so that it can
enter into force early next year,” Altmaier told reporters
today in Berlin. “It’s to provide clarity that the expansion of
offshore  wind energy  won’t grind to a halt because of these
problems. There are a lot of jobs depending on it and I want us
to send a signal of optimism.”  The delays have been a setback to developers eager to meet
Germany’s target of 25 gigawatts of sea-based turbines by 2030
as the country exits nuclear energy generation.  EnbW Energie
Baden-Wuerttemberg AG (EBK) , the country’s third-biggest utility, on
Nov. 14 postponed a decision to invest more than 1.5 billion
($1.9 billion) euros in a North Sea wind farm because it wasn’t
clear when the project can be connected to the grid.  Germany added 45 megawatts of offshore wind turbines in the
first half, less than expected, mainly because of the holdups.
Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s Cabinet endorsed a draft bill in
August. The bill, which includes charging grid operators and
power consumers for installation risks.  “I believe we have a chance to settle this in the coming
days,” Altmaier said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
