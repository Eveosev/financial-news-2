Rex Burkhead ran for 69 yards and
the go-ahead touchdown as No. 14  Nebraska  beat  Iowa  13-7 to
advance to college footballâ€™s Big Ten conference title game.  Nebraska captured the Legends Division with the victory and
will play two-time defending Big Ten Champion  Wisconsin  for the
conference championship at Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis on
Dec. 1.  Quarterback Taylor Martinez completed 8 of 14 passes for 63
yards in Iowa City, Iowa, for the Huskers, who won their sixth
straight game to finish the regular season 10-2 and 7-1 in the
conference.  Quarterback James Vandenberg connected on 11 of 24 passes
for 92 yards, with two interceptions, for Iowa (4-8, 2-6).  The Cornhuskers and Badgers will meet for the second time
this season. During the Big Ten opener on Sept. 29, Nebraska
rallied from a 17-point third-quarter deficit to tie the score
at 27-27 entering the fourth quarter, then scored a field goal
for the 30-27 victory.  Wisconsin returns to the Big Ten Football Championship game
after earning a 42-39 victory over Michigan State in the
inaugural contest to claim a second straight conference title
and trip to the Rose Bowl Game. The Badgers are looking for
their 14th Big Ten title and a third straight crown for the
first time in school history.  Nebraska, which has won 43 conference titles, is looking
for its first Big Ten Championship.  To contact the reporter on this story:
