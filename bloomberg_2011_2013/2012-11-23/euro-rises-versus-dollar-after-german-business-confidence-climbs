The euro advanced against the dollar
after data showed German business confidence unexpectedly rose
in November.  Europe â€™s shared currency climbed 0.2 percent to $1.2905 at
9:05 a.m. London time. It was 0.2 percent weaker at 106.03.  The Munich-based Ifo institute said its business climate
index, based on a survey of 7,000 executives, climbed to 101.4
from 100 in October for its first gain in eight months.
Economists predicted a drop to 99.5 according to the median of
48 forecasts in a Bloomberg News survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
