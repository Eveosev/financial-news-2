Mano Menezes was fired as coach of
Brazil’s national soccer team after failing to win this year’s
London Olympics gold medal and the  Copa America  in 2011.  The announcement, in a statement yesterday on the Brazilian
Soccer Federation’s Facebook page, comes less than two years
before Brazil hosts the final rounds of the  World Cup .  Brazil, the only nation to win five World Cup trophies, has
fallen to 13th in world soccer ruling body FIFA’s standings,
behind South American rivals Argentina, Colombia and Uruguay.  Menezes, then coach of the Brazilian soccer club
Corinthians, took over on July 24, 2010, after the team led by
 Carlos Dunga  lost in the quarterfinals of the World Cup in  South
Africa .  In his almost 2 1/2 years in charge of the national team,
Menezes, 50, recorded 21 wins, six losses and six ties. His last
game as coach was a 2-1 loss to Argentina three days ago.  Brazil will announce his successor in January, according to
the federation. The country is set to host the next World Cup
from June 12 to July 13, 2014.  To contact the reporter on this story:
