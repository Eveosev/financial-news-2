France ’s soft-wheat crop  planting 
was 94 percent complete as of Nov. 19, compared with 100 percent
that had been sown at that time last year, FranceAgriMer said.  About 72 percent of the winter crop, to be harvested in
2013, had  emerged  from the soil, compared with 97 percent at the
same time in 2011, the agency reported on its website today.
Parts of the country have had excess rain. Wheat planting in
France, the European Union’s biggest grower, started at the end
of September. About 76 percent of the crop was in good or
excellent  condition , compared with 95 percent a year earlier.  Tillering , the leaf-development phase that follows
emergence, had started for 10 percent of the wheat crop,
compared with 38 percent last year. Seventeen percent of winter
 barley  crops had reached this stage, compared with 56 percent a
year earlier. About 99 percent of barley crops had been  planted 
and 89 percent  emerged  from the soil.  Durum wheat, used to make pasta, was 74 percent  planted ,
compared with 94 percent last year, FranceAgriMer said. Twenty-
two percent had  emerged  from the soil, down from 81 percent in
2011.  Ninety-seven percent of corn crops had been collected as of
Nov. 19, according to the report. The  harvest  was completed by
the same time last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
