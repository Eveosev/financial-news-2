Teollisuuden Voima Oyj,  Finland ’s
biggest nuclear operator, is planning to increase output from
its 1,760-megawatt Olkiluoto reactors in 2017, bolstering
Finland’s energy independence.  “We may decide to boost capacity from the two 880-megawatt
units in 2017, adding significantly to net electricity output,”
spokesman Lauri Inna said today by phone from the reactor site,
without elaborating how much capacity will rise.  The increase may provide support to the nation’s energy-
intensive pulp, chemicals and basic metals industries, which
contribute twice the European average to the economy, according
to the  International Energy Agency . Finland embraced nuclear
power in the 1970s to cut its dependence on imports from the
 Soviet Union , because it lacks the oil and hydropower supplies
of neighbors such as Russia and  Norway .  “It will be a natural step to assess whether a further,
much bigger boost will be possible to implement in five years by
modifying the reactor generators, something we’ve done twice in
the past, on the condition however that we can maintain safety
and high utilization rates,” Inna said.  The company, co-owned by Finland’s biggest utility  Fortum
Oyj (FUM1V) , operates two nuclear stations that supply 17 percent of
Finland’s power use, and raised installed capacity at the units
by 20 megawatts each in 2010 and 2011 by investing 160 million
euros ($206 million) into improving power turbines. It has a
third atomic unit under construction, set to be the world’s
biggest at 1,400 megawatts, and a fourth one planned.  To contact the reporter on this story:
