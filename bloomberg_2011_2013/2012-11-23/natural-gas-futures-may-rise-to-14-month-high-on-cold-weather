Natural gas may rise to a 14-month
high above $4 next week on speculation that cold weather will
boost demand for the heating fuel, a Bloomberg survey showed.  Nine of 13 analysts, or 69 percent, forecast that futures
will advance on the New York Mercantile Exchange through Nov.
30. Three, or 23 percent, said gas will decline and one said
prices will stay the same. Last week, 50 percent of participants
said gas would rise this week.  Forecasters including MDA Weather Services in Gaithersburg,
 Maryland , predicted temperatures on the East Coast and in the
Midwest will be normal or below normal from Nov. 26 through Dec.
5. U.S. gas  demand  peaks during the heating season from November
through March. Unusually cold weather has helped reduce a
 stockpile surplus , Energy Department data show.  “Nobody expects to have milder weather than last year,”
said John Woods, president of JJ Woods Associates and a Nymex
floor trader. “It’s more of a hedge for the first part of the
winter season. They are looking to buy the stuff so they don’t
get caught too late.”  Natural gas for December delivery advanced 11.3 cents, or 3
percent, in the first three days of this week to $3.903 per
million British thermal units in New York, the highest
settlement price since Oct. 31, 2011. Gas last traded above $4
on Sept. 15, 2011. The U.S. market was closed yesterday in
observance of the Thanksgiving holiday. The futures are up 15
percent from a year ago.  Supply Report  U.S.  gas stockpiles  fell 38 billion cubic feet in the week
ended Nov. 16 to 3.873 trillion, the Energy Department said Nov.
21. The decline last week included the  reclassification  of 7
billion cubic feet from working gas, or inventories available
for delivery, to base gas, or supplies needed to maintain
adequate pressure, the department said.  The supply  surplus  narrowed to 4.5 percent above the five-
year average from 5.6 percent the previous week.  The gas survey has correctly forecast the direction of
prices 49 percent of the time since its June 2004 introduction.  Bloomberg’s survey of natural-gas analysts and traders asks
for an assessment of whether Nymex natural-gas futures will
probably rise, fall or remain neutral in the coming week. This
week’s results were:  RISE   FALL   NEUTRAL  9      3      1  To contact the reporter on this story:
