Mark Thompson , the newly installed
chief executive officer of  New York Times Co. (NYT) , testified at an
internal inquiry by the British Broadcasting Corp. into why it
canceled a news report about alleged sexual abuse at the
broadcaster, raising concerns of a cover-up.  Thompson, who joined Times Co. earlier this month, was in
charge of the BBC when it canceled a segment by its
“Newsnight” program investigating claims that Jimmy Savile, a
popular BBC presenter, had sexually abused dozens of underage
girls over a period of decades. Savile died last year.  Thompson met today with Nick Pollard, a journalist and
former head of  British Sky Broadcasting Group Plc (BSY) ’s Sky News who
has been asked by the BBC to look into the network’s decision
not to air the “Newsnight” report, according to  Robert Christie , a spokesman for Times Co. The CEO went to London for
the holidays, Christie said. He said he didn’t know when
Thompson will return to New York.  Thompson has said he wasn’t aware of the abuse allegations
and didn’t participate in stopping “Newsnight” from airing the
segment.  “I was not involved in any way in the decision-making
about the ‘Newsnight’ investigation into Savile,” Thompson said
in an interview last month.  Times Co. Chairman and Publisher Arthur Sulzberger Jr. said
the lingering scandal at the BBC has been a challenge for the
company.  “The British stuff hasn’t made things easy,” he said two
days ago in a brief interview. “But Mark is a good man.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
