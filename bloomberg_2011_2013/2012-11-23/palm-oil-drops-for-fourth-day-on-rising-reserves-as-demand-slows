Palm oil  declined for a fourth day
to the lowest level in more than a week on speculation that
stockpiles in Malaysia, the largest producer after Indonesia,
will climb from a record as exports drop.  The contract for February delivery lost 0.7 percent to
2,395 ringgit ($783) a metric ton on the Malaysia Derivatives
Exchange, the cheapest settlement price at close for the most-
active contract since Nov. 12. Futures, little changed this
week, are heading for a 25 percent drop this year.  Inventories gained for a fourth month to reach an all-time
high of 2.51 million tons in October, according to data from the
Malaysian Palm Oil Board. Shipments dropped 3.8 percent to 1.01
million tons in the first 20 days of November from a month
earlier, Societe Generale de Surveillance said on Nov. 20.  “There are some concerns that the stocks may climb again
because of the poor export data,” said Ivy Ng, an analyst at
CIMB Group Holdings Bhd. “Production is supposed to come off
but exports have also come off, so the issue is whether the
production fall is bigger than the export fall.”  Palm oil for May delivery closed little changed at 6,762
 yuan  ($1,086) a ton on the  Dalian Commodity Exchange .  Soybean
oil  for the same month gained 0.2 percent to end at 8,548 yuan a
ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
