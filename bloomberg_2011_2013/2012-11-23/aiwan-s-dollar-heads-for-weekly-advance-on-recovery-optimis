Taiwan ’s dollar advanced this week
and  government bonds  dropped for the first time in a month on
optimism the island’s economy is recovering.  Industrial production increased 4.6 percent from a year ago,
more than the 2.6 percent gain economists in a Bloomberg survey
estimated, official data showed today.  Export orders  rose in
October by the most eight months, according to a Nov. 20 report.
Taiwan saw the lowest trading volumes in its currency yesterday
since March 2, according to Taipei Forex Inc.  South Korea ’s
Deputy Finance Minister Choi Jong Ku said yesterday the
government will take action to curb excessive won volatility.  “There’s still risk-taking appetite in the market,” said
Tarsicio Tong, a Taipei-based foreign-exchange trader at  Union
Bank of Taiwan. (2838)  “But volume has dropped a lot. Traders are
being cautious as the economic outlook isn’t certain yet, and
the central bank may be more proactive when Taiwan’s neighbors
are taking action.”  Taiwan’s dollar appreciated 0.3 percent this week and 0.1
percent today to NT$29.171 against its U.S. counterpart, based
on Taipei Forex Inc. prices. The currency touched NT$28.959 on
Nov. 12, the strongest level since September 2011. One-month
implied volatility fell 30 basis points, or 0.3 percentage point,
to 3.7 percent during the five-day period. It was steady today.  The yield on the 1.125 percent notes due September 2022
rose two basis points to 1.13 percent from the end of last week,
according to Gretai Securities Market. That’s the first weekly
increase in  benchmark 10-year yields  since Oct. 19. The yield
advanced one basis point today.  The overnight  interbank lending rate  was steady today and
