Gold futures topped $1,750 an ounce
and silver climbed to a six-week high as the dollar’s drop
spurred demand for the metals as alternative investments.  The greenback fell to a three-week low against a basket of
major currencies as data showed German business confidence rose
in November and speculation mounted that Europe’s policy makers
will agree to keep aid flowing to Greece. Gold reached a five-
week high.  “The dollar weakness is supporting gold,”  Michael Smith ,
the president of T&K Futures & Options in  Port St. Lucie ,
Florida, said in a telephone interview.  Gold futures for December delivery rose 1.3 percent to
$1,751.40 at 12:45 p.m. on the Comex in  New York . That’s the
biggest gain for a most-active contract since Nov. 6. Earlier,
the metal touched $1,755, the highest since Oct. 17.  Floor trading was closed yesterday for the U.S.
Thanksgiving holiday.  Holdings in gold-backed exchange-traded products rose to a
record 2,605.3 metric tons on Nov. 21, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. The  U.S. Mint  sold 67,000 ounces of American
Eagle gold  coins  this month, exceeding the 59,000 ounces for all
of October, data on its website showed.  Silver futures for March delivery gained 2.3 percent to
$34.206 an ounce. Earlier, the price reached $34.25, the highest
since Oct. 11.  Platinum futures for January delivery advanced 2.1 percent
to $1,617.10 an ounce on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , while
palladium futures for December delivery increased 2.5 percent to
$667.60 an ounce.  To contact the reporter on this story:
