The U.K. will spend 46 million
pounds ($73 million) on 51 Foxhound patrol vehicles from  General
Dynamics Corp.’s (GD)  Force Protection unit, Defense Minister Philip Dunne said.  The contract, to supply front-line units in  Afghanistan ,
marks the latest phase of a 340 million-pound  government
investment  in the British-built  Foxhound  since 2010 to provide a
total of 376 vehicles, the Ministry of Defense said in an e-
mailed statement today.  Foxhound is “a real procurement success story, taking only
40 months to develop it from the initial design to deployment in
Afghanistan,” Dunne said. “Balancing the MoD’s budget means we
can now confidently invest in equipment like Foxhound, which has
the flexibility and adaptability to operate in a wide variety of
environments, providing capability for the Army well into the
future.”  -Editors: Eddie Buckle, Andrew Atkinson  To contact the reporter on this story:
