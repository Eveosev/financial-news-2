France ’s sugar-beet harvest, the
biggest in the European Union, was 85 percent completed as of
Nov. 18 compared with 95 percent at the same time a year ago,
growers federation CGB reported.  Harvest conditions have been “difficult” after rain
soaked fields, becoming increasingly so further north in the
country, the Paris-based CGB wrote on its  website  yesterday.  Beets continued growing in November, prompting some sugar
processors in the Loiret, Aisne and Nord-Est regions to lift
their outlook for productivity, according to the report. Higher-
than-expected beet weight means French sugar processors will on
average operate 100 days this campaign, two more days than
initially estimated, CGB said.  “While the work is ending in most beet-growing regions,
lifting continues in particularly critical conditions in the
coastal zone,” the CGB wrote.  Processors received 60 percent of the beet crop as of Nov.
18, according to the growers group. Soil content in cargoes was
12.5 percent of the weight of cleaned beets, 5 percentage points
higher than last year, the CGB said.  “Very heavy” rain in October disrupted the supply of the
roots to processors, prompting some sugar factories to lift
restrictions on soil content in beet cargoes to keep their
plants running, industry researcher Institut Technique de la
Betterave said Nov. 6.  The CGB repeated a forecast for white, or refined, sugar
yields of about 12.5 metric tons per hectare (2.47 acres) of
beets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
