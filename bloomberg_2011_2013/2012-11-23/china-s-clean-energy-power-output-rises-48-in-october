Electricity generated from clean
energy in  China  rose 48 percent to 92.7 billion kilowatt hours
in October from a year ago as installations grew.  In the year to October, electricity generated from clean-
energy sources, including from hydro and nuclear plants,
increased 26 percent to 810.2 billion kilowatt hours, the State
Electricity Regulatory Commission said in a  statement  yesterday.
That amounts to 20.4 percent of on-grid electricity, 3.6 percent
higher from a year ago.  Power from wind farms surged 40 percent last month compared
with the same period a year earlier, SERC said. The nation added
7.2 gigawatts of wind-power generation capacity in the first 10
months, raising the total to about 56 gigawatts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
