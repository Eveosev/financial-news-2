OAO Gazprombank,  Russia ’s third-
largest lender that is partly owned by the country’s natural-gas
export monopoly Gazprom, hired Alfa Bank’s Philip Halperin as a
senior adviser to the management board.  Halperin, who had worked as chief risk officer at Alfa
Bank, said by telephone today that he has joined the lender,
without elaborating on his responsibilities. The Yale-educated
American had worked at Alfa, the lending arm of billionaire
Mikhail Fridman’s Alfa Group, from 1999 until earlier this year.  Gazprombank, based in Moscow, earlier this year hired Erik Depoy as an equity strategist from Troika Dialog and Denis Shulakov from Barclays Plc as global head of capital markets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
