(Corrects headline to show Moneyval isn’t a body of the
European Union.)  Latvia  has improved legal mechanisms
to combat  money laundering , helping clinch convictions for
violating the controls, a European watchdog said.  The Baltic country brought its laws on money laundering in
line with international standards and adopted better regulations
for asset recovery, particularly by subjecting indirect proceeds
from the crime to confiscation, Moneyval, the Council of
Europe’s monitoring body for money laundering and terrorism
financing, said in an e-mailed report today.  Still, Latvia needs better rules on freezing terrorist
assets under the United Nations Security Council resolutions,
according to the report. The watchdog also advised the nation to
simplify procedures for reporting transactions suspected of
involvement in financing terrorist groups.  To contact the reporter on this story:
