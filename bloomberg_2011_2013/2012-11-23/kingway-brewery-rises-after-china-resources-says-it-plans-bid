Kingway Brewery Holdings Ltd. (124) , the
Chinese company that has called for bids for its beer business,
rose the most in a month in Hong Kong trading after  China
Resources (291)  Enterprise Ltd. said it plans to make an offer.  The Guangdong-based brewery  climbed  3.1 percent to HK$2.68,
the biggest increase since Oct. 24, giving it a market value of
about HK$4.59 billion ($592 million).  China  Resources, which
closed 2.5 percent higher at HK$26.25, has no timeframe for its
bid, Vincent Tse, a Hong Kong-based head of strategic planning,
said today, declining to provide further details.  “Kingway is a good asset,” Tse said. “The tough
operating environment in Guangdong has improved.”  Kingway put the  assets  up for sale in January as it lost
market share in its home province to competitors including
 Tsingtao Brewery Co. (168)  The company slumped to a loss in the first
half as falling sales and rising costs wiped out profits.  Tse didn’t say whether China Resources was targeting the
entire Kingway business, or just the beer operations.  China Resources’s venture with  SABMiller Plc (SAB)  sells Snow,
the No. 1 beer brand in China, which had a 22 percent market
share last year, according to Euromonitor International, a
London-based researcher.  To contact the reporter on this story:
