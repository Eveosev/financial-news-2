European banks’ reluctance to make
unsecured loans to one another rose for a fourth week to the
highest in more than a month, according to a money-market
indicator.  The difference between the euro interbank offered rate and
overnight indexed swaps, known as the Euribor-OIS spread, was
12.7 basis points at 8:30 a.m. in  London  from 12.4 on Nov. 16,
data compiled by Bloomberg show. The measure is the highest
since Oct. 8.  The cost for European banks to borrow in dollars was little
changed with the three-month cross-currency  basis swap  at 27
basis points below Euribor. The one-year basis swap was 28 basis
points below Euribor. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  The European Banking Federation’s euro overnight index
average, or Eonia, of unsecured lending deals was set at a
record low 0.071 percent yesterday from 0.072 percent the day
before. The Eonia swap, an estimate of average overnight
borrowing costs over the next three months, was unchanged at 6.3
basis points.  Lenders increased  overnight deposits  at the European
Central Bank yesterday to 229 billion euros ($295 billion) from
226 billion euros the day before.  To contact the reporter on this story:
