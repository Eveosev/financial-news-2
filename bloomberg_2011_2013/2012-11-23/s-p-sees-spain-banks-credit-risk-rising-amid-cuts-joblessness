Standard & Poor’s  said its view of
Spanish banks has become more negative and it expects credit
risk to rise.  “Spanish banks are facing higher credit risks as Spain’s
weakening economy, public sector cuts, austerity measures, and
high unemployment will likely hamper the creditworthiness and
resilience of public and private sector borrowers,” the company
said in a statement today.  Spain’s efforts to win back market confidence by increasing
taxes and cutting benefits have failed to reduce borrowing costs
while sending the economy deeper into  recession . Unemployment at
a record high of 26 percent prompted a surge in bad loans to
10.7 percent of the total and tipped companies that depend on
domestic demand for sales into losses.  “The rapidly deteriorating creditworthiness of the Spanish
sovereign, as evidenced by multiple downgrades over the last 12
months, is a leading indicator of greater credit risk in lending
to households, corporations, and the public sector,” S&P said.
“Banks are now more exposed to the weaker public sector.”  S&P rates  Spain  BBB-, one step above junk, after cutting
the rating six times since 2009, when it stripped the country of
its AAA grade. Spanish banks hold 192 billion euros ($248
billion) of Spanish debt, or about 32 percent of the outstanding
total, compared with 94 billion euros at the end of last year,
data from the Treasury show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
