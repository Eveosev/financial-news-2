OAO MRSK Holding jumped the most in
two months as Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a decree
giving the company a majority stake in Federal Grid Co.  MRSK rose 6.1 percent to 2.017 rubles by the close in
Moscow, the biggest gain since Sept. 25. The amount of shares
traded was 575 million, equivalent to almost two times the
three-month daily average. Federal Grid jumped 7.2 percent to
21.17 kopeks.  Putin signed a decree yesterday transferring 79.55 percent
of Federal Grid’s shares to MRSK Holding, according to an e-
mailed copy of the document. The nation’s largest electricity
distribution company will be renamed OAO Rossiskiye Seti,
according to the document.  “The decree effectively brings to an end the more than
six-month discussion over the potential ownership structure,”
VTB Capital analysts led by Mikhail Rasstrigin wrote in an e-
mailed note. It is “fully in line with the government’s recent
suggestions,” they said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
