Belgian  business confidence  rose
from the lowest level in three years in November as executives
in the services and trade industries said demand prospects
improved following a recovery in activity.  The confidence index for  Belgium  increased to minus 13.4
from minus 13.5 in October, the Brussels-based  National Bank of
Belgium  said today in a statement. Economists had predicted the
index to be unchanged in November, according to the median of 13
forecasts in a Bloomberg News  survey .  The improving sentiment among Belgian executives mirrors
similar moves in Germany and  France , Belgiumâ€™s two largest
export destinations. While the Belgian economy stagnated in the
third quarter, narrowly escaping a recession, sentiment among
executives in the manufacturing industry fell for a third
straight month in November amid a deteriorating demand outlook
to the lowest level in more than three years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
