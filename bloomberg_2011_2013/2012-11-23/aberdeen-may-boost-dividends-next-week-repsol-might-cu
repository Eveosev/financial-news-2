Aberdeen Asset Management Plc (ADN)  and
 United Utilities (UU/)  Group Plc are among eight companies in the
Stoxx Europe 600 Index that may boost their dividends next week,
while  Repsol (REP)  SA might cut its shareholder payout, data compiled
by Bloomberg show.  Aberdeen may raise its final dividend by 19 percent to 6.2
pence, according to Bloomberg Dividend Forecasts that factor in
earnings and options prices. United Utilities, Britain’s biggest
publicly traded water company, may increase its interim dividend
by 6.7 percent to 11.4 pence. Repsol, the Spanish oil producer
that had its Argentinian unit nationalized this year, may lower
its interim dividend by 26 percent to 42.5 euro cents.  Companies in the  Stoxx 600 (SXXP)  could increase shareholder
payouts by 7 percent in 2013, according to estimates compiled by
Bloomberg. Per-share earnings are forecast to grow 13 percent in
that period.  Severn Trent (SVT)  may boost its payout to shareholders by 8.1

estate investment trust this year,  Gas Natural SDG SA (GAS)  and
 Viscofan SA (VIS)  are also among the companies that may increase their
dividends next week.  The Stoxx 600 has rallied 3.8 percent so far this week, and
is heading for the biggest weekly advance in almost a year, as

the mend and optimism grew that America’s Congress will reach a
budget compromise. The benchmark measure added 0.4 percent to
