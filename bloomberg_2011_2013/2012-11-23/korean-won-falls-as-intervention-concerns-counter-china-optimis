South  Korea ’s won extended its
retreat from a 14-month high as concern the government will act
to stem currency gains offset optimism the Chinese economy is
set for recovery. Government bonds declined.  South Korea’s Deputy Finance Minister Choi Jong Ku said
yesterday there is “herd behavior” in currency market and that
the government will take action to curb excessive fluctuations.
The won is the best performer among the 11 most-traded Asian
currencies since end of June. A preliminary reading released
yesterday signaled  China ’s manufacturing may expand in November
for the first time in 13 months. The  Kospi (KOSPI)  index of shares rose
for a second day.  “There’s risk appetite in the market with data from China,
but caution against government intervention will restrict won
gains,” said Kim Dong Young, a Seoul-based currency dealer at
 Industrial Bank of Korea. (024110)   The won closed at 1,086.14 per dollar in Seoul, compared
with 1,085.73 yesterday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
It touched 1,080.05 yesterday, the strongest level since Sept. 9,
2011. The currency appreciated 0.6 percent this week. One-month
implied volatility, a measure of expected moves in exchange
rates used to price options, fell 25 basis points, or 0.25
percentage point, to 5.65 percent.  The U.S. told  Japan  and South Korea it detected North
Korean preparations to launch a long-range ballistic missiles,
the Asahi newspaper reported, without saying where it got the
information.  The yield on the government’s 2.75 percent bonds due
September 2017 rose two basis points today to 2.92 percent,
Korea Exchange Inc. prices show. The rate rose eight basis
points this week, the biggest increase for a benchmark five-year
 note  since August. The one-year interest-rate swap advanced one
basis point to 2.80 percent today and climbed three basis points
this week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
