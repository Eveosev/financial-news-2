Philippine bonds headed for a weekly
gain on speculation a government report next week will show
economic growth last quarter was the least in 2012, prompting
speculation of more interest-rate cuts. The peso rose.  Expansion in the $225 billion economy probably eased to 5.4
percent last quarter, from 5.9 percent in the previous three
months, according to the  median estimate  of 21 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg News before a report due Nov. 28.
Government spending accelerated in October, Budget Secretary
Butch Abad said this week.  “The budget and gross domestic product data coming out are
expected to be bond friendly,” said Jill Singian, a bond
portfolio manager at  Bank of the Philippine Islands (BPI)  in Manila.
“Weaker growth means there may be more room for accommodation
by the central bank. People are also expecting government
revenue to show strength.”  The yield on the 6.125 percent bonds due October 2037  fell
10 basis points, or 0.1 percentage point, this week to 5.78
percent as of 11:19 a.m. in Manila, according to Tradition
Financial Services. The rate was little changed today.  The Senate approved a bill this week to increase excise
taxes on tobacco and liquor, a measure that Finance Secretary
Cesar Purisima said may add an estimated 40 billion pesos ($974
million) to government coffers in the first year of
implementation.  Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas cut its  benchmark interest rate 
a fourth time this year to a record-low 3.5 percent in October.
Policy makers next meet to decide on borrowing costs Dec. 13.  The peso gained 0.7 percent this week to 41.07 per dollar
in  Manila , data from Tullett Prebon Plc showed. It was little
changed today.  One-month implied volatility, which measures expected moves
in exchange-rates used to price options, dropped 10 basis points
this week to 4.6 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
