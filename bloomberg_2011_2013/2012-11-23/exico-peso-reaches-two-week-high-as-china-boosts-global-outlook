Mexico ’s peso touched its strongest
level in two weeks as signs that  China ’s manufacturing is
rebounding helped boost optimism in the global economy and the
outlook for exports from the Latin American country.  The currency advanced 0.2 percent to 13.0298 per  U.S.
dollar  at 4 p.m. in Mexico City, extending this year’s rally to
7 percent, the biggest among the dollar’s 16 most-traded
counterparts tracked by Bloomberg. It earlier touched 12.9895
per dollar, the highest value since Nov. 7. Yields on inflation-
linked debt fell after the government reported prices rose by
more than forecast during the first half of the month.  The peso rallied after a survey that indicated the first
expansion in China’s factory output in 13 months fueled optimism
the world’s second-largest economy is recovering, according to
 Eduardo Suarez , a Latin America strategist at Bank of  Nova
Scotia . Concern about slowing global expansion helped fuel a 1.3
percent fall in the peso over the past two months.  “It’s the whole growth story,” Suarez said by telephone
from Toronto. “Global sentiment was weighing on it and now that
sentiment is improving, it is rebounding.”  The preliminary reading of a Chinese purchasing managers’
index released today by HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics
was 50.4 for November. It compares with a final level of 49.5
for October. Markets in the U.S., the chief destination for
Mexican exports, are closed for the Thanksgiving holiday.  Mexico’s consumer prices rose more than economists forecast
in the first half of November. Prices climbed 0.79 percent, the
national statistics agency said on its website today, compared
with the 0.72 percent median estimate of 18 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg.  Yields on inflation-linked securities known as Udibonos due
in December 2013 fell five basis points, 0.05 percentage point,
to 0.26 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Yields on Mexico’s peso bonds due in 2024 rose four basis
points to 5.57 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The price fell 0.48 centavo to 138.79 centavos per peso.  To contact the reporter on this story:
