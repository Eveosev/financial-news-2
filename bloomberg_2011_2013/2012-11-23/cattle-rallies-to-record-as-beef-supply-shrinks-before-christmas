Cattle futures extended a rally to a
record amid shrinking supplies of U.S. beef and increasing
demand for the meat as grocers boost purchases before the
Christmas holiday.  U.S. commercial beef output in the 10 months through Oct.
31 fell 1.1 percent from the same period in 2011, the government
said in a  report  today. The herd as of July 1 shrank to the
smallest since at least 1973. Ranchers culled herds after the
worst drought since 1956 eroded crop yields, sending corn, the
main ingredient in feed, up as much as 68 percent since mid-
June.  Grocers are stocking up on beef, which is often served as
part of the Christmas meal, before the Dec. 25 holiday, said
 Christian Mayer , a market adviser at Northstar Commodity
Investments Co. Consumers may pay as much as 6.5 percent more
for the  meat  in 2012, the biggest increase of any food item, the
 U.S. Department of Agriculture  said today.  “The number of cattle is still really tight,” Mayer said
in a telephone interview from  Minneapolis . “People are buying
beef. They need to buy it especially for holiday orders,” he
said, referring to grocer purchases.  Cattle futures for February delivery rose 0.8 percent to
settle at $1.32725 a pound at 12:13 p.m. on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange. Earlier, the price reached $1.32925, a
record for the most-active contract.  Beef Production  Commercial beef production totaled 21.69 billion pounds
(9.84 million metric tons) in the first 10 months of 2012,
compared to 21.92 billion pounds a year earlier, USDA data show.
Beef output will drop 4.2 percent next year, the government has
forecast.  Meatpackers processed 387,000 cattle in the first three
days of this week, down 1.3 percent from a year earlier, USDA
data show. Wholesale  beef  rose 0.6 percent to $1.9599 a pound as
of midday, the highest since Oct. 30, USDA data show.  Feeder-cattle futures for January settlement gained 0.3
percent to close at $1.47875 a pound in  Chicago .  Hog futures for February settlement increased 0.3 percent
to settle at 87.375 cents a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
