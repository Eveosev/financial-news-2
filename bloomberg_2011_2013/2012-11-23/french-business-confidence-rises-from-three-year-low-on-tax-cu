French  industrial confidence  climbed
from the lowest in more than three years after President
 Francois Hollande  unveiled a payroll tax cut for businesses that
will go into effect next year.  Sentiment among factory executives rose to 88 in November
after falling to 85 in October, national statistics office Insee
in Paris said in a statement today. Economists had expected a
reading of 87, according to the median of 19 forecasts gathered
by  Bloomberg News .  Hollande this month announced a 20 billion-euro ($25.8
billion) tax credit for businesses, and plans to reduce
 government spending  by 60 billion euros over five years in an
attempt to turn around an economy that has barely grown in more
than a year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
