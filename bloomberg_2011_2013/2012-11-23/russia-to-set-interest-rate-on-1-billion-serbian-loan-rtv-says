Russia’s  Finance Ministry  will
probably decide this week or next on the  interest rate  it will
charge Serbia for a $1 billion loan,  Radio Televizija Vojvodine 
reported, citing Serbia’s Mining and Natural Resources Minister
Milan Bacevic.  Other terms on the sovereign loan, which should be cheaper
than commercial borrowing, have been agreed, including that an
initial $300 million will help finance Serbia’s spending this
year, while the rest will be for 2013 and disbursed in three
parts, the report said, quoting Bacevic.  To contact the reporter on this story:
