The Cypriot government has made
“good progress” with the so-called troika toward a bailout
agreement the eastern Mediterranean island needs to refinance
its banks and pay its bills.  Cyprus and the troika, comprising the European Commission,
 European Central Bank  and  International Monetary Fund , have
“made good progress toward agreement on key policies to
strengthen public finances, restore the health of the financial
system and strengthen competitiveness, so as to pave the way for
the economy to return to sustained growth and financial
stability,” the troika said in a statement today.  Cyprus in late June became the fourth euro-area nation to
request a financial rescue since a 2010 bailout of  Greece . The
rescue will encompass banks weakened by their exposure to the
 Greek economy  as well as the public sector.  President Demetris Christofias said yesterday that the
Cypriot government is “working very hard” to strike an aid
agreement. Finance Minister Vassos Shiarly said Cyprus may need
as much as 17.5 billion euros ($22.7 billion) of aid, almost the
size of the country’s economy.  “Discussions are expected to continue from respective
headquarters with a view to making further progress toward a
potential program,” the troika said. “The preliminary results
of a bank due-diligence exercise, expected in the next few
weeks, will inform discussions between official lenders and
Cyprus on financing solutions consistent with debt
sustainability.”  European Union Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner
 Olli Rehn  said the “decisive progress” in Cyprus’s bailout
negotiations is “an important step toward full agreement.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
