U.S. stocks  had their biggest weekly
rally since June after President Barack Obama expressed
confidence on a budget agreement with Congress and data from
China to Germany bolstered optimism about global growth.  All  10 groups  except for utilities in the Standard & Poor’s
500 Index rose during the Thanksgiving-shortened week. An index
of homebuilders climbed 5.4 percent amid better-than-estimated
housing data.  Bank of America Corp. (BAC)  jumped 8.6 percent after an
analyst said the lender may commit as much as $10 billion to
dividends and share repurchases in 2013.  Salesforce.com Inc. (CRM) 
surged 11 percent after revenue beat estimates.  Apple Inc. (AAPL) 
gained 8.3 percent, ending a streak of eight weekly losses.  The S&P 500 advanced 3.6 percent to 1,409.15 for the week,
extending its 2012 gain to 12 percent. The  Dow Jones Industrial
Average  rallied 421.37 points, or 3.4 percent, to 13,009.68.
Both gauges had the best week since June 8.  “What you’re seeing out of Washington before the break is
a very cooperative tone,” Bill Greiner, who oversees $14
billion as chief investment officer at Mariner Wealth Advisors
in Kansas City, Missouri, said in a phone interview. “There is
a gathering sense that the deceleration in economic growth in
China seems to be bottoming right now. Both of those areas are
adding to a little bit strength in the market.”  The  S&P 500  began the week with the biggest advance in two
months after Obama met with senior Democrats and Republicans on
Nov. 16 for talks to avoid a so-called fiscal cliff of $607
billion in automatic tax increases and spending cuts next year.
The index continued to climb after Israel and the Palestinian
militant group Hamas agreed to call a halt to more than a week
of air strikes and missile attacks. Data showed the first
expansion in China’s manufacturing industry in 13 months and an
unexpected gain in German business confidence.  Shopping Season  The S&P 500 rallied 1.3 percent on the last day of the
week, posting the best post-Thanksgiving performance since 2007,
as the American  holiday shopping season  began. The index has
gained an average 0.6 percent during the week of Thanksgiving,
according to data since World War II compiled by Bloomberg. That
compares with 0.15 percent in all calendar weeks in the same
time frame.  Concern that Obama’s re-election set up a budget showdown
with the Republican-controlled House of Representatives sent the
S&P 500 down 7.7 percent from its 2012 high in September through
Nov. 15. Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said on Nov.
20 that the central bank doesn’t have the tools to offset the
potential harm to the economy from the fiscal cliff.  ‘Speed Bump’  “I don’t see a lot more downside to the markets even if we
go off the fiscal cliff,” Brian Jacobsen, who helps oversee
$208 billion as chief strategist at Wells Fargo Advantage Funds
in San Francisco, said in a Bloomberg Television interview on
Nov. 20. “The fiscal cliff would be somewhat of a speed bump if
you look at the long trajectory of history.”  Companies whose growth is most tied to economic swings led
the rally over the week. The  Morgan Stanley Cyclical Index (CYC)  rose
4.7 percent, the most since December 2011. Raw-materials
producers, consumer-discretionary and technology companies
gained the most among 10  S&P 500 (SPX)  groups, jumping at least 4.3
percent.  An S&P index of  homebuilders  climbed 5.4 percent, with all
its 11 members rising, as sales of previously owned U.S. homes
gained and confidence among U.S. homebuilders unexpectedly
increased to a six-year high.  PulteGroup Inc. (PHM)  surged 8.6 percent
to $17.03 while  Lennar Corp. (LEN)  added 7.1 percent to $38.68.  Lowe’s Cos., jumped 9.9 percent to $35.15 after the home-
improvement retailer said fiscal third-quarter profit topped
analysts’ estimates, helped by better merchandising decisions
and the recovering U.S. housing market.  Black Friday  A measure of retailers in the S&P 500 rose 4.7 percent for
the week. Black Friday marked the traditional beginning of the
holiday shopping season in the U.S., when retailers lure
customers with deep discounts.  Teen apparel retailer  Abercrombie & Fitch Co. (ANF)  rallied 8.6
percent to $44.40.  Dollar Tree Inc. (DLTR) , which sells everything from
toys to pet food and cleaning supplies for $1 or less, jumped
8.3 percent to $42.03.  Macy’s Inc. (M) , the second-largest U.S.
department-store chain, added 3.9 percent to $41.73.  Bank of America rallied 8.6 percent, the most in the Dow,
to $9.90. The lender has improved capital by the most among the
biggest U.S. banks and could fare comparatively well after
Federal Reserve stress tests, Ed Najarian, an analyst with
International Strategy & Investment Group Inc., wrote in a note.
The bank, which may have the equivalent of about $30 billion in
capital beyond the minimum required by regulators, may dole out
$5 billion to $10 billion for dividends and stock buybacks next
year, he wrote.  Salesforce, Microsoft  Salesforce.com rose 11 percent to $159.45. The software
maker reported fiscal third-quarter sales that beat analysts’
estimates, benefiting from contracts with large corporate
customers.  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) , the world’s largest software maker, gained
4.5 percent to $27.70.  Apple advanced 8.3 percent to $571.50, after slumping as
much as 25 percent from a record on Sept. 19. Even amid investor
concerns about product shortages, stiffening smartphone and
tablet competition and management changes, demand for Apple’s
products remains strong and the stock slide is unfounded,  Brian White , an analyst at Topeka Capital Markets, wrote in a report
on Nov. 19.  Tyson Foods Inc. (TSN)  surged 14 percent to $19.25 for the
biggest gain in the S&P 500. The largest U.S. meat processor
said profit will increase about 10 percent in fiscal 2014 and
2015 after remaining unchanged in the year ahead as the company
adds more prepared foods and international sales.  HP Tumbles  Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ)  slumped 3.2 percent, the most in the
Dow, to $12.44. The company accused Autonomy Corp., the software
maker it bought last year, of a broad range of financial
falsehoods that contributed to a $8.8 billion writedown, adding
to challenges facing Chief Executive Officer  Meg Whitman  in the
midst of a multiyear turnaround. Autonomy managers denied the
allegations. Hewlett-Packard also forecast fiscal first-quarter
profit that missed analysts’ estimates.  HP shares plunged 12 percent on Nov. 20 to the lowest level
in 10 years. It rebounded 6.2 percent during the following two
sessions.  Best Buy Co. tumbled 15 percent, the most in the S&P 500,
to $11.70. The consumer-electronics retailer posted a $10
million third-quarter net loss as sales at established stores
fell more than expected. S&P and Fitch Ratings cut the
retailer’s credit ratings.  Cliffs Natural Resources Inc. (CLF)  declined 12 percent to
$31.23. The largest U.S. iron-ore producer will delay parts of
an expansion at an iron-ore project in Quebec and idle some
production at two U.S. operations because of weaker demand for
the steelmaking raw material.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
