KKR & Co. (KKR) , the private-equity firm
run by Henry Kravis and George Roberts, agreed to buy brokerage
Alliant Insurance Services Inc. from  Blackstone Group LP (BX)  for an
undisclosed price.  Employees of Alliant, which is based in Newport Beach,
California, own 45 percent of the company and will roll over a
“substantial” amount of their investment in the company under
KKR’s ownership, the companies said today in a statement.  “This transaction will enable Alliant to remain
independent and maintain its market leading position,” Tom Corbett, the company’s chief executive officer, said in the
statement.  Private-equity firms are buying insurance-services
companies for their steady cash flow and low capital
expenditures. A group led by CVC Capital Partners Ltd. agreed
last month to buy insurance-claim adjuster Cunningham Lindsey
Group Ltd. in a deal valuing the company at as much as $1
billion including debt.  New York-based Blackstone, the world’s largest manager of
alternative assets such as private equity, real estate and hedge
funds, is exiting Alliant five years after buying it in 2007 for
an undisclosed amount at the height of the buyout boom.  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  advised Blackstone and Alliant on
today’s deal, which is expected to close by the end of the year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
