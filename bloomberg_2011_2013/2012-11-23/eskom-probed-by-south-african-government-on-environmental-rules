Eskom Holdings SOC Ltd. is being
investigated over what the South African government says are
breaches in environmental rules by the state power utility.  “We have started investigations into certain individuals
at Eskom,” Frances Craigie, a director of enforcement at the
Department of Environmental Affairs, said by telephone from
 Pretoria . In one example, Eskom’s Camden power station east of
Johannesburg broke air and water pollution guidelines, she said.  The department will investigate possible criminality by
some Eskom employees, Craigie said, declining to elaborate.  Many issues at Camden have been fixed and others need to be
addressed through longer term projects, Hilary Joffe, an Eskom
spokeswoman, said today by e-mail. The company has yet to review
an enforcement  report  released by the department, she said.  Eskom, which generates 95 percent of the electricity used
in  Africa ’s biggest economy, is spending about 500 billion rand
($56 billion) through 2017 to revive old plants and build new
ones to overcome a shortage in capacity. The company increased
tariffs by an average 25 percent in each of the past six years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
