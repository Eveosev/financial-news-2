Copper gained, poised for a second
weekly advance, after signs that  China ’s economy is rebounding
raised expectations that consumption in the world’s largest user
will increase next year.  Metal for delivery in three months rose 0.2 percent to
$7,728 a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange at 3:18 p.m. in
 Shanghai , after falling as much as 0.6 percent. It’s gained 1.6
percent this week, extending last week’s 0.5 percent climb.  “Copper will probably continue to be traded at $7,700 to
$7,800,” said Wang Na, an analyst at Guolian Futures Co. While
 Europe  has again become a concern, China seems to be improving
and a tight global market is underpinning prices, Wang said.  China’s factory output may have expanded for the first time
in 13 months in November, according to a preliminary survey from
HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics yesterday. Codelco, the
largest producer, reported a 5 percent drop in nine-month output
to 1.25 million tons as ore grades fell at its Chilean mines.  The February-delivery copper contract closed 0.2 percent
higher at 56,140  yuan  ($9,014) a ton on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange. The March-delivery contract rose 0.2 percent to $3.514
a pound on the Comex in New York. Tin, nickel and zinc climbed
in London, while aluminum and lead were little changed.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
