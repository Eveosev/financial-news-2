LDK Solar Co. (LDK) , the second-biggest
maker of solar wafers, was sued by  Shanghai Rural Commercial
Bank  for overdue loans worth 100 million  yuan  ($16 million), the
website of the Economic Information Daily reported.  The two parties weren’t able to resolve a dispute before a
court hearing on Nov. 21, the newspaper said, citing LDK Solar’s
Chief Executive Officer Tong Xingxue. The report didn’t say
which court the suit was filed in.  The Shanghai-based bank refused to extend the repayment
tenure of loans it gave LDK Solar Hi-Tech (Suzhou) Co. last
year, according to the newspaper, which is managed by the
official Xinhua News Agency.  Two phone calls to LDK Solar spokesman Li Longji weren’t
answered. A call to Shanghai Rural’s media department also
wasn’t answered.  To contact the reporter on this story:
