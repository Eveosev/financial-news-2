Greece , declared free of malaria
almost 40 years ago, is battling to prevent the mosquito-borne
disease from making a comeback as local transmission has
resurfaced in the past two years.  Outbreaks of locally transmitted malaria since 2011 in the
regions of Laconia and East Attica are making it urgent to
increase surveillance and take mosquito control measures to
eliminate the risk of the disease becoming re-established,
researchers from the Hellenic Center for Diseases Control and
Prevention  wrote  in the journal Eurosurveillance yesterday.  Once entrenched in Greece, malaria was officially
eliminated in 1974. Immigrants from countries where malaria is
widespread have brought the disease with them, raising the risk
that malaria could again gain a foothold in Greece, according to
the report.  “It is becoming urgent to strengthen surveillance and
perform integrated mosquito control that will help eliminate the
potential risk of malaria reintroduction and reestablishment,”
the researchers wrote.  This year 16 cases of locally-transmitted malaria have been
reported in Greece as of Oct. 26, after 27 cases were reported
last year,  according  to the European Centre for Disease
Prevention and Control.  Greek health authorities are working with the European
Centre for Disease Prevention and Control and the World Health
Organization to combat malaria, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
