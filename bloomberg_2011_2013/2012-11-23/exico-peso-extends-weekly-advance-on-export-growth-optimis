Mexico ’s peso extended its biggest
weekly gain since September as signs of a global recovery
boosted the outlook for the Latin American country’s exports.  The currency appreciated 0.5 percent to 12.9647 per  U.S.
dollar  at 4 p.m. in Mexico City, boosting this week’s rally to
1.3 percent. The peso has strengthened 7.5 percent this year,
the most among the dollar’s 16 most-traded counterparts tracked
by Bloomberg.  The peso gained along with most of its emerging-market
peers today after a report showed German business confidence
unexpectedly rose in November from the lowest in 2 1/2 years.
The peso rose yesterday after a survey indicated the first
expansion in  China ’s factory output in 13 months.  “There haven’t been catastrophes externally,”  Ramon Cordova , a currency trader at Banco Base SA in San Pedro Garza
Garcia, Mexico, said in telephone interview. “The outlook for
Mexico is getting better and better.”  The Munich-based Ifo institute said today its business
climate index climbed to 101.4 in November from 100, the first
gain in eight months. Economists predicted a drop to 99.5. A
U.S. Commerce Department report on Nov. 20 showed that housing
starts rose 3.6 percent to an annual pace of 894,000, the
fastest since July 2008. Mexico sends about 80 percent of its
exports to the world’s biggest economy.  Yields on Mexico’s peso bonds due in 2024 rose three basis
points, 0.03 percentage point, to 5.6 percent, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The price fell 0.23 centavo to 138.55
centavos per peso. The yield is up 13 basis points this week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
