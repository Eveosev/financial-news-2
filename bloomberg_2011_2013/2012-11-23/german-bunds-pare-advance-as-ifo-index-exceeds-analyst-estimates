German 10-year bunds pared an
advance after a gauge of German business confidence unexpectedly
rose in November.  Yields on 10-year securities fell less than one basis
point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 1.42 percent at 9:07 a.m.
London time, after declining as much as two basis points to 1.41
percent.  German business confidence rose to 101.4 this month from
100.0 in October. The median forecast of 48 economists in a
Bloomberg survey was for a decline to 99.5.  To contact the reporter on this story:
