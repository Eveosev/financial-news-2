Russia ’s parliament will open the
first reading of a draft law banning smoking in public places on
Dec. 14 and plans to pass the bill in 2013, missing this year’s
target date set by the government, a lawmaker said.  “There are lots of questions about the draft -- we are
talking about several hundred amendments,” Oleg Kulikov, a
member of the Communist Party and deputy head of parliament’s
health committee, said by phone from Moscow today. The
amendments “will not eliminate any proposed measures, but may
introduce changes to the timetable of their implementation.”  Russia, the world’s second-largest market for cigarette
makers after China, proposed measures that will outlaw all
tobacco advertising and sponsorship as well as kiosk sales
immediately, with bans on cigarette trade in small retail
outlets and smoking in public places taking effect Jan. 1, 2015.  The government wants the law passed this year, Deputy Prime
Minister Olga Golodets said in an interview Oct. 18.  Philip
Morris International Inc. (PM) ,  British American Tobacco (BATS) , Japan
Tobacco and  Imperial Tobacco (IMT) , which control 93 percent of the
Russian market, hooked women and children on smoking, Prime
Minister  Dmitry Medvedev  said in a video blog Oct. 16, vowing to
crack down on the habit.  The tobacco lobby in Russia is “strong enough” to
continue efforts to push through amendments in parliament,
according to Golodets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
