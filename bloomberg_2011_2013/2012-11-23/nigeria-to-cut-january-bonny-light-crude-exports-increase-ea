Nigeria ,  Africa â€™s largest oil
producer, is scheduled to export six cargoes of Bonny Light
crude in January, one less than a revised plan for December,
according to a loading program obtained by Bloomberg.  The country will also ship two cargoes of EA Blend, one
more than is scheduled to load next month, with one of the
December shipments deferred until January, a separate program
showed.  Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude shipments
compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan
their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
