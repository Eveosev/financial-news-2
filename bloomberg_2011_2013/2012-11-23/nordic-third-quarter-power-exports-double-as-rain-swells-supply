Power exports from the Nordic area
more than doubled in the third quarter as a glut of water and
falling demand rendered the region unable to absorb surplus
supply, a report by  Norway ’s energy and water directorate shows.  Net sales to countries outside the region increased to 4.4
terawatt-hours from 1.9 terawatt-hours a year earlier, according
to the e-mailed  report . Norway’s and  Sweden ’s combined exports
rose 23 percent to 11.8 terawatt-hours, of which Denmark and
 Finland  absorbed 7.5 terawatt-hours. The four countries’ power
demand in the quarter fell by 0.4 percent from a year earlier to
79.7 terawatt-hours, the directorate said.  The Nordic area gets more than half of its power supplies
by running water through turbines. Wet periods generally trigger
exports and dry spells cause imports as electricity flows from
low-price areas to high-price areas, tracking the supply-demand
balance. The region currently has 9.94 terawatt-hours more power
available than the seasonal average, according to Markedskraft
AS data on Bloomberg.  Norway’s power exports may rise to a record this year. The
country has shipped 17 terawatt-hours abroad, equivalent to half
of  Denmark ’s yearly demand, amid abundant hydroelectric output,
industry association Energy Norway said on Nov. 15.  To contact the reporter on this story:
