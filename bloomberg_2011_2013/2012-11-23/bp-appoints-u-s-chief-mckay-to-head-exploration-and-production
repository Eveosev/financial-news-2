BP Plc (BP/) , Europe’s second-biggest oil
company, is reorganizing the management its of exploration and
production business.  Lamar McKay , the head of U.S. operations, will move to
London to become chief executive officer of upstream, reporting
to CEO Bob Dudley, BP said in a statement in London today.  The move undoes one of Dudley’s first acts when he took
over in 2010 following the Gulf of Mexico oil spill. Dudley
eliminated the post of head of exploration and production and
put three executives in charge that reported directly to him.  Andy Inglis , the head of exploration and production from
2007 until 2010, left the company in the wake of the spill. His
role was replaced with an expanded management team as well as
heads of safety and of strategy and integration.  Exploration will still be led by Mike Daly, a BP veteran of
more than 25 years. Bernard Looney, who previously ran the
company’s  North Sea  business, remains in charge of development.
Bob Fryar heads up production. They will now report to McKay.  McKay, a petroleum engineer who’s been with the company 32
years, has been chairman and president of BP America since 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
