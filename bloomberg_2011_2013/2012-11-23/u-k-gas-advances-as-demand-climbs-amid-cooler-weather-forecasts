U.K. natural gas for next-working
day delivery rose for a fourth day as demand increased amid
predictions of cooler weather.  The contract climbed as much as 1.8 percent, according to
broker data compiled by Bloomberg. Demand in the 24 hours to 6
a.m. tomorrow will be 272 million cubic meters, the most since
Nov. 18,  National Grid Plc (NG/)  data show. Temperatures in  London 
will fall as low as minus 2 degrees Celsius (36 Fahrenheit) on
Dec. 1 and minus 3 degrees on Dec. 3, down from 6 degrees today,
according to CustomWeather Inc. data.  Day-ahead gas  climbed 0.6 pence, or 0.8 percent, to 67.1
pence a therm, after reaching 67.75 pence, the most since Oct.
29. Next-month gas added 0.9 percent to 68.65 pence a therm.
That’s equivalent to $11 per million British thermal units and
compares with $3.90 per million Btu of front-month U.S. gas.  Imports rose to meet the higher demand, with Norwegian
flows reaching 117 million cubic meters a day, the most since
Nov. 19, according to Gassco AS data. Imports from  Belgium  were
at a rate of 14 million cubic meters a day, also a four-day
high.  The  delivery network  will contain 332 million cubic meters
of gas at 6 a.m. tomorrow, down from 343 million at the start of
today, National Grid data show.  Gas accounted for 36 percent of U.K. power production at
4:40 p.m., grid data show. Coal also generated 36 percent,
nuclear 13 percent and wind 4.2 percent.  Electricity for the next working day dropped 2.4 percent to
50 pounds a megawatt-hour, broker data show. Month-ahead power
jumped 1.2 percent to 51.10 pounds a megawatt-hour.  EON AG halted its 1,940-megawatt Kingsnorth coal-fed power
plant in southeast  England  at about 9:30 p.m. yesterday,
according to the company’s website. All four 485-megawatt units
are scheduled to start on Nov. 26, EON said. The utility will
close Kingsnorth once it has used its final 300 hours under the
European Union’s Large Combustion Plant Directive because the
plant does not meet the required environmental standards.  To contact the reporter on this story:
