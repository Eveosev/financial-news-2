The following is the text of
 Canada ’s consumer price index report for October released
by Statistics Canada.  Consumer prices rose 1.2% in the 12 months to October,
matching the increases in August and September. Energy prices
rose at a slower year-over-year rate in October compared with
September, while air transportation, food purchased from stores
and property taxes posted larger price gains.  Energy prices  Energy prices advanced 1.7% in the 12 months to October,
after rising 2.9% in September. This slower increase was led by
smaller price gains for electricity and gasoline.  The cost of electricity increased 1.7% on a year-over-year
basis in October, after rising 6.0% in September. This smaller
increase in the electricity index was the result of price
declines recorded in Alberta.  Gasoline prices rose 4.0% in the 12 months to October,
following a 4.7% increase in September. Prince  Edward Island 
(+9.0%) had the largest year-over-year increase, while British
Columbia (+0.3%) had the smallest.  Natural gas prices declined 11.6% in the 12 months to
October, after decreasing 14.2% in September. Despite a monthly
price increase, the natural gas index was one of the largest
downward contributors to the year-over-year change in the All-
items Consumer Price Index (CPI) in October.  Excluding energy, the CPI rose 1.1% in the 12 months to
October, after rising 0.9% in September.  12-month change in the major components  Consumer prices rose in every major component in the 12
months to October, except for clothing and footwear.  Chart: Prices rise in every major component except clothing and

following a 1.6% increase in September. The October increase was
led by year-over-year price gains for meat (+5.1%) and food
purchased from restaurants (+2.1%).  Prices for transportation rose 1.7% on a year-over-year
basis in October, after rising 1.6% in September. The increase
in the transportation component in October was led by price
gains for gasoline. Consumers also paid more for air
transportation.  Shelter costs increased 0.9% in the 12 months to October,
after rising 1.2% in September. Consumers paid 2.8% more in
property taxes. Homeowner’s replacement cost and rent also
increased. Conversely, mortgage interest cost decreased 2.6%,
continuing a pattern of year-over-year declines observed since
2009.  12-month change in the provinces  The largest year-over-year increase in consumer prices in
October occurred in Newfoundland and Labrador, while the
smallest occurred in British Columbia.  Prices in Newfoundland and Labrador rose 2.2% in the 12
months to October, a full percentage point above the national
average of 1.2%. This difference was mainly attributable to
larger year-over-year price increases in Newfoundland and
Labrador for food purchased from stores and electricity.
Additionally, since natural gas is not widely consumed in the
province, the downward contribution of natural gas recorded for
Canada in October is not a factor in the province’s All-items
CPI.  Consumer prices in British Columbia increased 0.5% in the
12 months to October, after rising 0.7% in September. In
addition to recording the smallest year-over-year price increase
for gasoline, British Columbia posted a decline in homeowner’s
replacement cost.  In  Alberta , consumer prices rose 0.6% on a year-over-year
basis in October, after advancing 1.4% in September. This slower
increase in the Alberta CPI in October compared with September
was the result of price decreases for electricity.  Seasonally adjusted monthly CPI increases  On a seasonally adjusted

monthly basis, the CPI increased 0.3% in October, after rising
0.2% in September.  The seasonally adjusted index for transportation advanced
0.9%, matching the increase in September. The food index rose
0.5% in October, after declining 0.2% the previous month. The
index for recreation, education and reading was the only major
component to record a decrease, while the clothing and footwear
index posted no change.  Bank of Canada’s core index  The Bank of Canada’s core index
( http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/62-001-x/2012010/technote -
notetech2-eng.htm) rose 1.3% in the 12 months to October,
matching the increase in September.  On a monthly basis, the seasonally adjusted core index
increased 0.1% in October, after posting no change in September.  Note to readers  The special aggregate “Energy” includes: electricity;
natural gas; fuel oil and other fuels; gasoline; and fuel, parts
and supplies for recreational vehicles.  The Bank of Canada’s core index excludes eight of the
Consumer Price Index’s most volatile components (fruit, fruit
preparations and nuts; vegetables and vegetable preparations;
mortgage interest cost; natural gas; fuel oil and other fuels;
gasoline; inter-city transportation; and tobacco products and
smokers’ supplies) as well as the effects of changes in indirect
taxes on the remaining components.  A seasonally adjusted series is one from which seasonal
movements have been eliminated. Users employing Consumer Price
Index data for indexation purposes are advised to use the
unadjusted indexes. For more information on seasonal adjustment,
