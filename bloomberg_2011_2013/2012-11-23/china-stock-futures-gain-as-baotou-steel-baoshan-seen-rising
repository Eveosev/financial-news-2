China   stocks  rose, sending the
benchmark index to its first weekly gain in three weeks, as
consumer-staple and finance companies climbed.  Ping An Insurance (Group) Co. (601318)  advanced for a third day,
leading gains by financial shares. Inner Mongolia Baotou Steel
Rare-Earth Hi-Tech Co. increased 1.4 percent after the Financial
Times said China will extend rare-earth subsidies. Wuliangye
Yibin Co. rallied following a six-day slump amid concerns over
the quality of Chinese liquor products.  JiuGuiJiu Co. (000799)  plunged 10
percent after a four-day trading halt as it apologized for
excessive levels of plasticizer in its drinks.  The Shanghai Composite Index closed 0.6 percent higher at
2,027.38, taking its weekly gain to 0.6 percent. Stocks advanced
as the official Xinhua News Agency reported a pledge by Vice
Premier Li Keqiang to deepen reforms to promote scientific
development and transform the pattern of the nation’s economic
development. The  CSI 300 Index (SHSZ300)  climbed 0.7 percent to 2,192.68.
The  Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  of Chinese companies
traded in Hong Kong added 0.9 percent.  “Investors are comforted by the signs of reforms but as
you can see, the gains are not very strong,” Zhou Lin, an
analyst at Huatai Securities Co., said by phone from Nanjing.
“Such rebounds are never sustainable because volumes remain low
and confidence is weak. We need to see more concrete measures.
This is not a time to enter the market yet.”  The Shanghai Composite dropped below the  2,000 level  during
intraday trading twice this week and rallied to close above that
level amid speculation of government support. The index dropped
0.7 yesterday even as a purchasing managers’ index signaled the
nation’s manufacturing industry may have expanded in November
for the first time in 13 months.  Key Level  Shanghai Composite trading volumes were 17 percent lower
than the 30-day average for this time of day, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Thirty-day  volatility  on the index was at
13.2, compared with this year’s average of 17.4.  The gauge has fallen 1.4 percent since new leaders were
named by the ruling Communist Party Nov. 15 amid concern they
will fail to accelerate the pace of measures to liberalize the
world’s second-largest economy. The gauge has slumped 7.8
percent this year and  trades  at 9.6 times estimated profit for
2012, compared with the 17.8 average multiple since Bloomberg
began compiling the data in 2006.  The nation needs to break all “systematic” obstacles that
hinder scientific development, Xinhua cited Vice Premier Li as
saying. The provincial government of eastern Zhejiang introduced
12 detailed policies for financial reform in Wenzhou city,
Xinhua reported separately, citing the city’s government.  HSBC Stake  It’s possible the nation may widen the  yuan ’s trading band
in the first quarter, Xinhua said in another article about the
currency’s appreciation in the past month. The news agency
didn’t cite anyone, nor did it indicate any government intention
to widen the trading band. The yuan has appreciated 0.3 percent
against the dollar since Oct. 23.  Ping An, China’s second-largest insurer, gained 1.7 percent
to 37.12 yuan, taking its three-day advance to 5.1 percent. The
stock had slumped 4.8 percent on Nov. 19-20 after HSBC Holdings
Plc it’s in talks to sell its 15.6 percent holding in Ping An.  The $9.6 billion stake offers investors a share in a
diversified business with stable profit growth, according to
analysts at Capital Securities Co. and BoCom International.  Inner Mongolia Baotou (600111)  climbed 1.4 percent to 33.67 yuan.
China will extend subsidies of $35 million to $40 million
annually, the Financial Times reported. Baoshan Iron & Steel Co.
added 0.4 percent to 4.63 yuan after saying it had bought back
352.2 million shares as of Nov. 22.  Liquor Makers  A gauge of consumer staple companies in the CSI 300 Index
gained 1.5 percent, the most of 10  industry groups . Liquor
makers led the consumer gauge’s 4.8 percent slump this week
through yesterday as the nation’s quality watchdog found
excessive levels of plasticizer in drinks made by JiuGuiJiu.  Wuliangye Yibin, the nation’s second-largest publicly
traded liquor maker, gained 0.9 percent to 27.71 yuan, while
 Sichuan Swellfun Co. (600779)  climbed 1.8 percent to 19.40 yuan. Both
stocks lost at least 10 percent this week. Kweichow Moutai Co.
advanced 2.2 percent to 222.11 yuan.  “Other liquor makers fell when Jiuguijiu was halted,”
said Huatai’s Zhou. “The bad news is priced in. This doesn’t
mean it’s time to buy the shares. Don’t touch the shares for
now.”  JiuGuiJiu declined 10 percent to 42.82 yuan as it resumed
trading. The spirit maker apologized yesterday to consumers and
investors in a stock exchange filing and said it is co-operating
with requests from the provincial quality watchdog to run strict
checks on its distribution and packaging processes.  The  Bloomberg China-US 55 Index (CH55BN) , the measure of the most-
traded U.S.-listed Chinese companies, did not trade as U.S.
markets were closed for a holiday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
