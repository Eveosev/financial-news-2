Nigeria  needs to improve security
patrols on its pipelines to curb theft, according to  Royal Dutch
Shell Plc (RDSA) , the nation’s largest oil producer.  Shell removed 135 illegal connections from its pipelines in
the first ten months of the year,  Tony Okonedo , a Lagos-based
company spokesman, said today by e-mail. At least 96 caused
spills, he said.  “Every time SPDC shuts down production to undertake
repairs and disable identified theft points, the crude thieves
use the opportunity of pressure drop along the line to install
new ones elsewhere along the facility,” he said. SPDC is
Shell’s Nigerian unit.  Shell shut 25,000 barrels a day of crude output on Nov. 11
from its Imo River field after finding several crude theft
points on a connecting pipeline. Those arrested in connection
with that incident are from a contractor company providing
surveillance services, Okonedo said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
