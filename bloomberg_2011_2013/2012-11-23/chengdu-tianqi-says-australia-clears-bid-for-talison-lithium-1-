Chengdu Tianqi Industry Group Co., a
closely held Chinese maker of battery chemicals, said the
Australian government cleared its proposed C$806 million ($808
million) takeover of Talison Lithium Ltd.  Chengdu Tianqi was advised by  Australia ’s Foreign
Investment Review Board that it had no objections, the Chengdu,
Sichuan Province-based company said today in a statement. The
company said it can now proceed with a purchase of 5.73 million
Talison shares to bring its stake to 20 percent.  Chengdu Tianqi made its unsolicited C$7.15-a-share bid for
Perth, Australia-based Talison on Nov. 19, trumping an agreed
C$6.50-a-share offer from  Rockwood Holdings Inc. (ROC)  that was
announced in August. The bidders are vying for one of the four
companies that control most of the world’s production of
lithium, a metal used in batteries for electric cars and laptop
computers.  Talison said today that it postponed Nov. 29 meetings for
investors to vote on the offer from Princeton, New Jersey-based
Rockwood until Dec. 13. Talison said separately that it’s still
in talks with Chengdu Tianqi.  Talison rose 2.5 percent to C$6.95 at 9:57 a.m. in Toronto.  Chengdu Tianqi said Nov. 19 it has Chinese government
approvals for the deal. Rockwood said Nov. 21 its own bid is the
company’s best and final offer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
