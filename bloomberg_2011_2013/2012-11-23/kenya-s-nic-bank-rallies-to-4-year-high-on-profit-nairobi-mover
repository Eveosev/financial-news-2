NIC Bank Ltd. (NICB) , the best performing
stock among Kenyan lenders this year, climbed to the highest
level in more than four years after saying profit in the first
nine months of the year surged 36 percent.  Shares in the Nairobi-based lender advanced 6.7 percent to
40 shillings by 11:45 a.m. in the capital. A close at that level
will be the highest since April 2008. The volume of shares
traded was five times the three-month daily average, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Net income in the nine months through September climbed to
2.4 billion shillings from 1.77 billion shillings a year
earlier, the lender said yesterday. Net interest income, the
money banks make from loans, grew 34 percent to 3.99 billion
shillings.  “The company released good results and the stock has
particularly gone up today in reaction to that,” Rufus
Mwanyasi, head trader at Nairobi-based Canaan Capital Ltd., said
in a phone interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
