Taiwan’s shares rose, driving the
benchmark index up the most in 11 months, after Finance Minister
Chang Sheng-ford said government-controlled funds should buy
equities.  The benchmark Taiex index closed 3.1 percent higher at
7,326.01, the biggest advance since Dec. 21.  Formosa
Petrochemical Corp. (6505)  surged the most in 13 months and  Taiwan
Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (2330) , which has the biggest weighting
on the index, jumped to a record.  State-controlled funds and banks that are partially owned
by the government should buy local stocks at lows, the  Central
News Agency  cited Chang as saying yesterday. The index fell to
7,088.49 on Nov. 21, the lowest level since July 26. Taiex
trading volumes were 49 percent higher than the 30-day average,
while the gauge’s 30-day  volatility  rose to 14.7, the highest
level since Aug. 22, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  “The market had been performing very badly recently and
investors are catching onto any cues to enter the market,”
Bryan Chen, a  fund manager  at Taipei-based Union Securities
Investment Trust Co., said in a phone interview today.  The National Stabilization Fund, created in March 2000 to
provide support when markets are threatened by non-economic
factors, isn’t intervening in the market at this stage, Deputy
Finance Minister Tseng Ming-chung said by phone in Taipei today.  Taiwan’s Cabinet plans to propose stock market-stimulus
measures in a month, Taipei-based Unique TV reported, citing
Cabinet spokeswoman Cheng Li-wun. Cheng didn’t pick up calls to
her office and her mobile phone.  Zhen Ding  Formosa Petrochemical climbed 6 percent to NT$84.50, the
biggest gain since Oct. 24, 2011. Taiwan Semiconductor added 4.6
percent to a record NT$95.50.  Zhen Ding Technology Holding Ltd. (4958) , which designs and makes
circuit boards, rose by the daily 7 percent limit to NT$78. The
stock posted the biggest gain in the Taiex as concern eased that
government funds will halt investment in companies with lower
market capitalization.  SinoPac Securities Corp. raised its share-price estimate on
Zhen Ding to NT$108 from NT$104 today, saying the recent decline
was an “overreaction” to earlier reports that government funds
would be banned from investing in smaller and overseas-
incorporated companies. Zhen Ding slumped 11 percent in the week
to Nov. 21.  The island’s statistics bureau is scheduled to report
revised third-quarter gross domestic product data at 4:30 p.m.
in Taipei today. Taiwan’s economy probably expanded 1 percent
from the previous year, according to the median estimate of 13
economists surveyed by Bloomberg. The government reported a
preliminary growth rate of 1.02 percent on Oct. 31.  To contact the reporters on this story:
