Maremotrices de Energias Renovables ,
a Mexican builder of systems that generate electricity from the
motion of waves, plans to start building 30 megawatts of
projects in February that will save companies money on their
energy bills.  Marersa, as the company is known, expects to receive $100
million of mezzanine equity from an investment bank throughout
next year to help fund the development of the four plants,
Director of Finance and Administration Rafael Ortiz Markivich
said in a telephone interview without disclosing the name of the
investor.  Marersa, based in  Mexico  City, will install about 450
floating buoys that harness the movement of waves to create
hydraulic pressure which is converted into electricity,
Markivich said. It has pledged to sell the energy at 20 percent
lower prices than electricity bought from state power utility
Comision Federal de Electricidad.  “We have the cheapest renewable energy in Mexico,” Diego
Carrion, sales and business manager for Marersa, said in a
telephone interview. “Wind farms may be able to offer between a
10 and 12 percent discount” on grid electricity.  The company expects to sign additional contracts to sell
energy from about 70 megawatts of plants by June with companies
including Wolfsburg, Germany-based car-maker  Volkswagen AG (VOW) , he
said. The average price of electricity in Mexico is 1,300
Mexican pesos ($100) a megawatt hour.  Marersa expects to start operating in February a 3-megawatt
plant for CFE in Baja California state, which cost $5.4 million
to build, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
