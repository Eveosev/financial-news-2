European Union carbon rose the most
in 11 days as German power for 2013 advanced for the first time
in more than a week.  Permits for December gained 3.2 percent to 7.01 euros
($9.10) a metric ton on  London ’s ICE Futures  Europe  exchange.
German baseload power for 2013 increased for the first time
since Nov. 14, climbing 0.3 percent to 46.65 euros a megawatt-
hour, according to broker data compiled by Bloomberg.  It fell
to a record 46.40 euros on Nov. 20.  Germany sold permits for next year at 6.75 euros a ton in
its fifth such auction. Bidders sought 9.2 million permits in
the event, more than three times the volume for sale. Buyers
yesterday bid for twice as many permits as were offered by the
EU in its fourth sale of allowances for the next phase of the
bloc’s carbon market.  The EU,  Greece ,  Germany  and the U.K. sold a total of 21
million tons of permits this week as the EU ramped up its
auctioning program before the start of the third phase, which
runs from 2013 through 2020. The EU, Germany and Greece will
offer more than 13 million tons of allowances next week.  United Nations Certified Emission Reductions for December
rose 2.5 percent to 81 cents on ICE Futures Europe, the highest
for four days.  The executive board of the UN’s Clean Development
Mechanism, the body responsible for regulating CERs, delivered
9.3 million tons of credits to the market today, UN  data  show.
That’s more than 10 times as many as yesterday and the biggest
issuance in a single day since Sept. 16, 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
