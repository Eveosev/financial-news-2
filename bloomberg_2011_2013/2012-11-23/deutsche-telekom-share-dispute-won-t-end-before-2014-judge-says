Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE) ’s dispute with
thousands of investors over a share sale more than a decade ago
won’t be resolved before 2014, a German top court judge said.  The Federal Court of Justice will take at least two years
for the appeals procedures in the case that bundles suits by
more than 16,000 shareholders, Presiding Judge Ulrich Wiechers
said at a conference in Berlin today.  “My personal ambition is to resolve the appeals before I
retire in 2014,” Wiechers said. The judges in the case won’t be
able to make a start before the second half of 2013, once briefs
between parties on appeals arguments are exchanged, he said.  The court will examine whether a Deutsche Telekom
prospectus may have misled investors in connection with a 13
billion-euro ($16.8 billion) share sale in 2000. The
shareholders, who mostly held small stakes, are seeking about 80
million euros in compensation. The Higher Regional Court in
 Frankfurt  had dismissed the case in which Deutsche Telekom has
denied any wrongdoing.  More than 16,000 investors, many of whom were buying shares
for the first time, argued that they were misled because
Deutsche Telekom’s sales prospectus contained dozens of
mistakes. They claimed the company improperly reported the value
of real estate and didn’t disclose in a timely way its intention
to acquire U.S. phone operator VoiceStream in 2000.  The suit bundles shareholders’ claims under a special
process known as a model case established in 2005 to help courts
handle multiple investor actions. Individual suits were filed as
early as 2002 and the model case, which later bundled them,
started in 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
