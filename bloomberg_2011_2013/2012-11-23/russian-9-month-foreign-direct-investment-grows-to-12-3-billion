Russian  foreign direct investment 
grew 4.6 percent in the first nine months from a year earlier to
$12.3 billion, with manufacturers and the financial industry
receiving the most capital.  Total foreign investment, including loans and flows into
securities markets, shrank 14.4 percent to $114.5 billion, the
Federal Statistics Service in Moscow said today in an e-mailed
statement.  The world’s biggest energy exporter is struggling to
reverse  capital outflows  that have reached $61 billion in the
January to October period. President Vladimir Putin returned to
the Kremlin in May pledging to improve the business climate and
lure foreign capital to boost investment to 25 percent of
economic output by 2015 from 21 percent last year.  The financial industry received the largest amount of
investments in the first nine months, followed by manufacturing
and wholesale and retail companies, according to the statistics
service. Cyprus was the largest foreign investor in the period,
followed by the Netherlands, Luxembourg,  China , the U.K. and
 Germany .  The central bank may increase its forecast for net capital
 outflow  this year, Bank Rossii First Deputy Chairman Alexey Ulyukayev said today. This month the central bank raised this
year’s projection to $67 billion, from an earlier estimate for
$65 billion.  To contact the reporters on this story:
