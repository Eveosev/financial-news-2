San Francisco 49ers coach Jim Harbaugh declined to name tomorrow’s starting quarterback at New
Orleans, saying “there’s no competitive advantage for us to
release that information, for our organization or for our
team.”  Alex Smith was the starting quarterback for the 49ers (7-2-
1) all season until he suffered a concussion Nov. 11. Colin Kaepernick took his place on Nov. 19, throwing two touchdown
passes in a 32-7 win against the Chicago Bears.  Harbaugh said Smith went through his final medical test
yesterday and will be cleared to play today if there still are
no symptoms. The coach said Smith has had no concussion symptoms
for the past three days.  Harbaugh told reporters after practice yesterday that he
would not comment on whether Smith and Kaepernick had been told
who would start against the Saints (5-5). He also declined to
comment when asked whether the rest of the team had been told.  “Again, it’s just not something we think is an advantage
for us to talk about,” Harbaugh said. “It’s unorthodox. So be
it. You can call me names if you want, or make sport of me. But
that’s the way we’re going to go about it.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
