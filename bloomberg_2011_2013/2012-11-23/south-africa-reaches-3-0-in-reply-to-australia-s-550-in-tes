Graeme Smith hit an unbeaten century
and Morne Morkel took a five-wicket haul to lead South Africa’s
fightback on day two of the second cricket Test against
 Australia  in  Adelaide .  Captain Smith finished on 111 as the touring team reached
217-2 to trail Australia by 333 runs on the first innings.
Morkel earlier finished with 5-146 to help dismiss Australia for
550 after it resumed at 482-5.  Smith shared a 138-run opening stand with Alviro Petersen,
who made 54 before getting run out. Hashim Amla was then stumped
by wicketkeeper Matthew Wade off the bowling of part-time spin
bowler David Warner for 11.  Left-hander Smith combined with Jacques Rudolph for 48 runs
to guide the Proteas to stumps without further loss as they seek
to retain their status as the No. 1-ranked Test team in the
three-match contest.  Morkel took three wickets in the morning session, including
removing home captain Michael Clarke for 230, for his fifth
five-wicket haul in Tests and first against Australia.  The Australians lost their last five wickets for 68 runs in
the morning session after plundering the South African bowling
attack for 5 1/2 runs an over on day one. James Pattinson
smashed 42 off 35 balls to help lift the total after Australia
fell to 504-9.  Clarke added six runs to his overnight score after
yesterday becoming the first batsman in elite Tests to register
four double centuries in a calendar year. Warner and Mike Hussey
also reached triple figures in Australia’s innings.  South Africa would stay atop the International Cricket
Council’s Test rankings by avoiding defeat in the best-of-three
contest, while Australia can overtake the Proteas at No. 1 with
a series victory.  To contact the reporter on this story:
