Dave Smith, who headed up Lloyds
Banking Group Plc’s Australasian unit, was hired as chief
executive officer of  Australia ’s National Rugby League.  Smith’s appointment ends a 5 1/2-month search to find a
replacement for David Gallop, who left the role in June after 10
years in the job. Gallop has since taken a similar position with
Australia’s soccer federation.  Smith, a Welshman who moved to Sydney nine years ago, will
start with the NRL on Feb. 1, the Australian Rugby League
Commission said today in a statement. Smith said at a televised
news conference that his commitment with Lloyds International
will run until the end of January.  “I decided 18 months ago to change direction and to look
for opportunities in sports management and have been waiting for
the right opportunity,” Smith told reporters. “I believe I
have the set of skills that will make a difference.”  Shane Mattiske will continue to act as the NRL’s interim
chief executive until Smith takes over, the commission said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
