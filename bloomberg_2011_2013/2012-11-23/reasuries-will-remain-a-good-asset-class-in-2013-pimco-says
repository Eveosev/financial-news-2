Treasuries will remain supported
next year because they provide good insurance against economic
risks, according to Tony Crescenzi, a portfolio manager and
strategist at Pacific Investment Management Co.  “Investors will still want bonds,” Crescenzi said in an
interview on Bloomberg Television’s ‘Bloomberg Surveillance’
with  Tom Keene . “Treasuries provide good insurance against
macro risk.”  The  Federal Reserve  will keep rates low until 2015 or 2016,
he said.  “The Fed is anchoring the bond market quite strongly, it
will remain a good asset class, meaning one that will give
investors comfort,” Crescenzi said. “Pimco is avoiding, or
trying to keep a low weighting, on maturities beyond 10 years,
because we know the Fed’s intent is to reflate a deflated
economy.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
