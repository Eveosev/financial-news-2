Argentine oil workers in three
provinces are holding a 24-hour strike today to demand higher
wages, newspaper Cronista said.  Workers in La Pampa, Neuquen and  Rio Negro , which produce a
third of the countryâ€™s crude production, may hold another, 48-
hour strike on Nov. 28 if they fail to get a response from the
companies, the Buenos Aires-based newspaper said, citing labor
union leader Guillermo Pereyra.  To contact the reporter on this story:
