OAO Transneft fell for the second
day, heading for a one-week low, on concerns its investment
program for next year will make higher dividends unlikely.  Transneft lost 0.7 percent to 62,599 rubles by 1:28 p.m. in
Moscow, the lowest level on a closing basis since Nov. 16. The
stock lost 2 percent yesterday. The amount of shares traded
today was 4,534, equivalent to 39 percent of the three-month
trading average. Thirty-day volatility climbed to 27.781, the
highest since Oct. 24.  The board of  Russia ’s state-run oil pipeline operator
approved an investment program for next year of 161.4 billion
rubles ($5.2 billion), according to a statement yesterday on the
company’s website. The plan exceeded expectations of analysts at
 Alfa Bank  and VTB Capital, according to e-mailed notes.  “As higher  capital expenditures  reduces the chances of
generous dividends going forward, we believe some market
participants may prefer selling their Transneft holdings,” Alfa
Bank analysts led by Alexander Kornilov, said in an e-mailed
note.  Russia approved regulations requiring state companies to
pay no less than 25 percent of their net income in dividends,
according to a document posted on the government’s website on
Nov. 16.  To contact the reporter on this story:
