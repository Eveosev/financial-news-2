Hong Kong  Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying said he was negligent for not seeking approval for
renovations he made to his house and promised to remove all
illegal structures immediately.  Leung, a property surveyor who became the city’s top
official on July 1, said he added flower racks without first
getting the necessary approval, according to a statement today.  Hong Kong’s building authority ordered Leung in June to
remove structures, including a gate and a trellis. Lawmaker
Albert Ho, who ran against Leung for the chief executive
position, had challenged Leung’s win in court by arguing he
misled the public.  “I admit I was negligent and was not prudent in dealing
with the matter,” Leung said in the 14-page statement. “I
wasn’t clear in explaining and caused public misunderstanding.”  Ho’s case was dismissed in court this month. Some of the
additions to Leung’s house were made by the previous occupant,
while other changes got approval from the building authority,
Leung said in his statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
