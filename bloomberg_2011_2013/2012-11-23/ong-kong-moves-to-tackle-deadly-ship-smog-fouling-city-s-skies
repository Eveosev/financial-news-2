Hong Kong  will force oceangoing
ships to burn cleaner fuel while at berth, bringing relief to
residents facing a third straight year of near-record pollution.  The city also said it would phase out polluting trucks and
buses and clamp down on smoky vehicles, according to a
 government release today  which detailed an emissions reduction
plan to 2020.  Forcing ships to switch to the more expensive, cleaner fuel
may reduce the smog that causes more than 3,000 premature deaths
a year in Hong Kong, where the world’s highest rents, shortages
of schools and the filthiest air of any global financial hub are
deterring skilled workers. Vessels can now burn oil containing
3,500 times the sulfur as auto diesel sold in the city.  Soot from burning marine fuel accounted for 31 percent of
respirable particles in Hong Kong’s air in 2008, according to
the city’s government.  The decision to replace the current voluntary program that
international shipping companies say rewards polluters was part
of a raft of measures Hong Kong and the neighboring Chinese
province of Guangdong endorsed to meet 2015 air emission
targets.  To contact the reporters on this story:
