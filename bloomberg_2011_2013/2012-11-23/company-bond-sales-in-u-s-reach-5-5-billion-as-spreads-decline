Baidu Inc. (BIDU)  and  British Sky
Broadcasting Group Plc (BSY)  led companies in the U.S. selling $5.5
billion of bonds this week as relative yields narrowed amid
almost record-low borrowing costs.  Baidu, owner of China’s most-popular search engine, raised
$1.5 billion in its debut issue and Middlesex, U.K.-based BSkyB
sold $800 million in its first offering since 2008, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Sales dropped from $32.5 billion
last week and compare with $1.1 billion in the five days ended
Nov. 25, 2011.  “There seems to be an insatiable demand for new names,”
 Tom Murphy , a portfolio manager at Columbia Management
Investment Advisers LLC in  Minneapolis , who oversees about $26
billion of investment-grade credit, said in a telephone
interview. “It has been a phenomenal time to be an issuer and
to try to lock in these all-time lows in coupons.”  Yields rose to 3.669 percent on Nov. 21 from 3.639 percent
at the end of last week, according to the Bank of America
Merrill Lynch U.S. Corporate & High Yield Master index. That’s
close to the unprecedented low of 3.578 percent reached on Oct.
19. The extra yield investors demand to own bonds from the
riskiest to the most creditworthy borrowers rather than
government debentures decreased 5 basis points this week to 243
basis points.  With the week shortened by the closure yesterday of U.S.
bond markets for the Thanksgiving holiday, investment-grade bond
sales reached $5.1 billion while high-yield issues totaled $450
million, Bloomberg data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
