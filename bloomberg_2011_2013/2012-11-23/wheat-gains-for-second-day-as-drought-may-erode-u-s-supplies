Wheat rose for a second day in Paris
on speculation global supplies will tighten because of dry
weather in the U.S., the world’s largest exporter of the grain.  Only 34 percent of U.S. winter wheat was rated good or
excellent as of Nov. 18, the worst condition since tracking of
data began in 1985, Department of Agriculture figures show.
Prices climbed 39 percent this year in Paris trading after
droughts in the U.S.,  Russia  and eastern  Europe . European Union
export licenses for soft wheat in the marketing year begun July
2 are up 11 percent from a year earlier.  “Matters are made worse for the hard, red winter wheat
crop in that temperatures are warm, causing the wheat to mature
earlier than it should and thus putting that crop at risk should
normal cold winter temperatures return,” economist  Dennis
Gartman  said of the U.S. today in his daily Gartman Letter.  Milling wheat for delivery in January added 0.3 percent to
the day’s high of 271 euros ($350) a metric ton by 2:28 p.m. on
NYSE Liffe in Paris. Prices are up 0.6 percent this week.
Agricultural markets on the Chicago Board of Trade will open
later today following yesterday’s Thanksgiving holiday.  Argentina , which had above-normal rains in recent weeks,
may produce 10.1 million tons of wheat, the Buenos Aires Cereals
Exchange said yesterday. That compares with the USDA’s estimate
for the country of 11.5 million tons.  Corn for delivery in January gained 0.2 percent to 254
euros a ton in Paris. Rapeseed for delivery in February declined
0.2 percent to 470.75 euros a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
