Commerzbank AG (CBK)  Chief Executive
Officer  Martin Blessing  said a solution next week on Greece is
“vital.”  Investors in financial markets are relying on the European
Union and the  International Monetary Fund  reaching an agreement,
Blessing said in a speech at the Frankfurt European Banking
Congress today.  Greece’s fiscal woes have defied three years of rescue
efforts and rekindled doubts about Europe’s crisis-containment
strategy. More than 11 hours of talks to resolve the impasse
failed this week amid a decision by EU ministers to grant Greece
two extra years to cut its deficit.  Debt purchases by the European Central Bank calmed markets,
but can only be “bridging loans,” Blessing said. Bold
political moves on European integration are needed to stop the
euro area from falling apart, he said.  “Time is running out,” Blessing said. “There are only
two options - more integration or breakup.”  Banks should also implement Basel III capital rules “soon
rather than later” and  Europe  will not accept the U.S. suddenly
reneging on its commitments, Blessing said.  “We will not accept that America suddenly drops Basel III
to favor its banks,” he said. “What we need is a level playing
field.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
