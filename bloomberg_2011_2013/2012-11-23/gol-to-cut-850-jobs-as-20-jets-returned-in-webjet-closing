Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes SA (GOL) ,
 Brazil ’s second-biggest airline, will eliminate about 850 jobs
and return 20  Boeing Co. (BA)  737 jets to lessors as it shutters the
newly acquired Webjet unit.  Domestic flight capacity will fall by as much as 8 percent
in the first half, Gol said today in a U.S. regulatory filing.
Sao Paulo-based Gol said it expects unspecified one-time costs
in the fourth quarter before the moves “improve operational
efficiency as of 2013.”  Webjet’s fleet “mostly consists of aging Boeing 737-300
aircraft that are advanced age, technologically out of date and
consume large amounts of fuel,” Gol said. “Given the Brazilian
sector’s new cost standards, this model is no longer
competitive.”  Unloading the planes extends Gol’s push to return to profit
after  adjusted losses  in five of the past six quarters. The
airline has been paring flights and jobs and swapping smaller
jets for larger models so it can fill a larger share of seats on
each flight.  “The deteriotation in our earnings made Gol start a
process of rationalization,” Chief Executive Officer Paulo Kakinoff said on a conference call. Passengers booked on Webjet
flights will be accommodated on Gol planes, he said.  Gol rose 1.9 percent, the most since Nov. 6, to 9.86 reais
at the close in  Sao Paulo . That pared the stock’s decline this
year to 21 percent.  Webjet Approval  The 96 million reais ($45.8 million) acquisition of closely
held Webjet Linhas Aereas SA won Brazilian regulatory approval
last month after being announced in July 2011. All of Webjet’s
planes were leased, according to Ascend Online Fleets data
compiled by trade publication Aviation Daily.  The 20 planes will be returned in the first half, with 16
of those coming in the first quarter, according to  Gol, (GOLL4)  which
didn’t identify the lessors.  Boeing’s single-aisle, twin-engine 737-300 entered service
in 1984 and was delivered through 1999, according to the
planemaker’s website. That model has since been supplanted by
larger, more fuel-efficient versions. Gol’s 114-plane fleet
consists of newer 737-700s and 737-800s, according to the
airline’s website.  Kakinoff, who became CEO in July after founder Constantino de Oliveira Jr. stepped down, agreed last month to buy 60 of the
737 Max variant in a deal valued at $6 billion at list prices.  To contact the reporters on this story:
