The leu gained, paring its decline
for the week, and foreign bond yields rose.  The Romanian currency strengthened less than 0.1 percent to
4.5329 per euro by 4:13 p.m. in Bucharest. Yields on 2019 euro-
denominated bonds advanced seven basis points, or 0.07
percentage point, to 4.823 percent, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  Romania ’s central bank capped lending at 6 billion lei at
its weekly repo auction on Nov. 19 even as demand rose to 30
billion lei, tightening funding for lenders. It started
restricting funding on Oct. 8 to support the leu, which slumped
to a two-month low of 4.5716 per euro on Oct. 5.  Inflation will end this year at 5.1 percent, the bank said
Nov. 7. That compares with an August 6 forecast of 3.2 percent.  A campaign for general elections started on Nov. 9 in
Romania as the ruling coalition of Prime Minister Victor Ponta
goes head-to-head with the opposition party supporting president
Traian Basescu. Parliamentary elections will be held on Dec. 9.  To contact the reporter on this story:
