The U.S. East Coast and Ohio Valley
are expected to be warmer than normal at the start of December
after colder temperatures prevail for most of the next 10 days.  Temperatures may rise about 3 degrees Fahrenheit (1.7
Celsius) along the coast and as much as 8 degrees across the
Midwest and eastern Canada from Dec. 3-7, according to  Matt Rogers , president of Commodity Weather Group LLC, based in
Bethesda,  Maryland .  “The cold could be stronger than forecast for the
Northeast and mid-Atlantic toward the middle of next week, but
it may end faster than previously forecast for the Midwest by
late next week,” Rogers said in a note to clients. “That
advances the next warm-up into the first weekend of December.”  Meteorological winter starts Dec. 1 while the calendar
marks the season change on Dec. 21. The winter months are when
the most natural gas and heating oil are consumed, and cooler-
than-normal weather in the high-population areas of the East
Coast and Midwest helps boost demand for energy to warm homes
and businesses.  Before the warmer air arrives, the eastern U.S. and  Canada 
may have temperatures 3 to 5 degrees below normal in the last
week of November.  To contact the reporter on this story:
