Vietnam ’s three-year bonds rallied
by the most since August on speculation banks invested surplus
cash in debt amid a slowdown in credit growth. The dong was
little changed.  Vietnamese lenders bought 89 percent of the 132.3 trillion
dong ($6.3 billion) of notes issued by the government this year,
the Dau Tu Chung Khoan magazine reported today. Banks stepped up
purchases of the securities as slowing economic growth curbed
lending and swelled their capital, said Nguyen Tan Thang, fixed-
income investment director at Ho Chi Minh City Securities Joint-
Stock Co.  “For banks there are no attractive or promising investment
channels apart from buying bonds,” he said. “It’s all about
liquidity and most of the buyers are banks.”  The yield on three-year bonds fell 25 basis points, or 0.25
percentage point, to 9.40 percent this week, according to a
daily fixing from banks compiled by Bloomberg. That’s the fifth
straight weekly decline and the biggest since Aug. 3.  Vietnam’s  economy  may expand 5.2 percent this year, the
government forecast in September, the slowest pace since the 4.8
percent growth posted in 1999, according to International
Monetary Fund data.  The dong traded at 20,853 per dollar as of 3:37 p.m. in
Hanoi, compared with 20,865 yesterday, and little changed from a
week ago, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The  State Bank  of Vietnam set its  reference rate  at 20,828,
unchanged since Dec. 26, according to its website. The currency
is allowed to trade as much as 1 percent on either side of the
fixing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
