A  tax fraud  case involving managers
and former bankers of  UniCredit SpA (UCG)  and Barclays Plc should be
heard in Bologna rather than Milan, a judge ruled today.  Prosecutors in Bologna will consider the evidence and
whether to request charges. Twenty individuals were indicted in
June for their role in the alleged tax fraud. UniCredit used the
so-called Brontos vehicle, arranged by Barclays, to evade taxes,
according to Milan prosecutor Alfredo Robledo.  UniCredit in August said it settled disputes with Italyâ€™s
tax authority, including the Brontos case.  One of the UniCredit units involved in the case is legally
based in Bologna.  To contact the reporter on this story:
