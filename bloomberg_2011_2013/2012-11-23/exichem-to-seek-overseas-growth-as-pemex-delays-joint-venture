Mexichem SAB, the chemical maker
that has bought more than 15 companies since 2007, has decided
to seek international expansion after a proposed petrochemical
joint venture with  Petroleos Mexicanos  has faced delays, the
company said today.  Mexichem cited repeated delays by Petroleos Mexicanos, the
state oil company, to approve a joint venture to produce vinyl
chloride monomer, a chemical intermediate used in making
plastic. The company said it “has decided to give priority to
it’s vertical integration outside Mexico.”  Mexichem will “continue with its profitable and solid
growth strategy despite not having this association,” the
company said in a filing sent today to the nation’s stock
exchange. The project’s delays hinder the development of
Mexico’s petrochemical industry, Mexichem said without offering
more details about how it reached the decision.   Petroleos Mexicanos, the world’s fourth-largest oil
producer, delayed the approval of the joint venture with
Mexichem on Oct. 2 after the company’s board postponed an
extraordinary meeting to discuss the transaction. Pemex, as the
company is known, hasn’t scheduled a new meeting.  To contact the reporter on this story:
