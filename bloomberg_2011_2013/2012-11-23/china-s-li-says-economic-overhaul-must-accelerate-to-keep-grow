Chinese Vice Premier  Li Keqiang ,
promoted last week to the No. 2 spot in the ruling Communist
Party and set to take the job of premier in March, said three
decades of economic opening must be accelerated as the push to
overhaul the economy encounters obstacles.  Li, speaking Nov. 21 at a meeting in Beijing, said  China 
needed to accelerate economic overhaul, citing areas including
improving state-owned enterprises and the taxation system,
according to  remarks  published on the government’s website.  “At present reform has encountered a ‘fortress area’ and a
‘deep water area,’” where there are countercurrents that can
push back progress, Li said. “We must overcome difficulties and
get rid of all institutional obstacles that hinder scientific
development.”  Li didn’t cite specific policies the government would push
to boost the economy and overhaul the country’s growth model.
Economic growth in the past decade accelerated under Premier  Wen
Jiabao  to an  average  10.6 percent a year following decisions
made under his predecessor, Zhu Rongji, to reshape the
management of state-owned companies and open  China’s economy  and
financial industry to foreign investment as part of its entry
into the  World Trade Organization  in 2001.  In a Nov. 21 article in the Communist Party’s flagship
People’s Daily newspaper, Li said China had to deepen its rural-
to-urban population shift to support the growth necessary for
the nation to overcome the so-called middle income trap of
economic stagnation.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
