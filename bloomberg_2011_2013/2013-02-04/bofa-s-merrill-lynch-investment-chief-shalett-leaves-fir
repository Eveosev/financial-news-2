Bank of America Corp. ’s Lisa Shalett,
who was chief investment officer for the firm’s Merrill Lynch
brokerage for two and a half years, will leave the company.  Shalett decided to “pursue other opportunities,”
according to a staff memo today from Andy Sieg, head of the
 Charlotte , North Carolina-based firm’s global wealth and
retirement  unit . Christopher Wolfe, CIO for the private banking
group, will be her interim replacement, Sieg said.  Shalett departs from Bank of America, the second-biggest
U.S. lender by assets, more than a year after her former boss
 Sallie Krawcheck  was asked to leave. Krawcheck, who ran the
wealth-management division until September 2011, hired Shalett
from AllianceBernstein LP in July 2010.  Susan McCabe, a Bank of America spokeswoman, confirmed
Shalett’s departure and said the firm was seeking a permanent
replacement. Shalett didn’t immediately return a call seeking
comment on her departure.  Shalett was responsible for global investment strategy at
the brokerage, home to the so-called Thundering Herd of about
15,000 financial advisers, according to a Merrill Lynch  website .
She worked her way from being an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein
& Co. to chief executive officer of the research firm. At
AllianceBernstein, Shalett served as head of global growth
equities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
