South African corn futures fell to
the lowest in more than eight months as the rand gained against
the dollar on Feb. 1, reducing the cost of imports.  White corn for delivery in March, the most active contract,
dropped 2.4 percent to 2,052.20 rand ($230) a metric ton, the
lowest since May. 7, on the South African Futures Exchange in
Johannesburg. The yellow variety for July delivery, surged 2.1
percent to 1,994 rand a ton.  The rand had strengthened 1.3 percent to 8.8398 per dollar
by the close on Feb. 1, its biggest daily gain since Oct. 9. The
currency was little changed in early futures trading though it
weakened 0.9 percent to 8.9199 by the 12pm close.  “The rand had strengthened drastically on Friday, bringing
down the import parity price,” Brink van Wyk, a trader at BVG
(Pty) Ltd., said by phone from  Pretoria .  The nation is the continent’s largest producer of corn.
White corn is a staple food and the yellow variety is used as
 animal feed .  Wheat for delivery in March decreased 1.6 percent to 3,598
rand a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
