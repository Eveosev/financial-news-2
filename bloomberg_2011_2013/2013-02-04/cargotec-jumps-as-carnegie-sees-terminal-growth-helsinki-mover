Cargotec Oyj (CGCBV) , a Finnish maker of port
cranes and forklifts, rose the most in three weeks in Helsinki
trading after Carnegie Investment Bank AB said growth in the
terminal unit will boost the stock price.  Cargotec rose  as much as 4 percent, the most since Jan. 15,
to 21.77 euros and gained 2.3 percent at 1:35 p.m. in the
Finnish capital. That was the biggest increase on the Nasdaq OMX
Helsinki 25 Index. Trading volume on the stock was 44 percent of
the three-month daily average.  Cargotec’s terminal business accounted for 44 percent of
the Helsinki-based company’s revenue at end of the third quarter
when its sales grew 27 percent. Carnegie analyst Timo Heinonen
today raised his recommendation to buy from hold, citing higher
earnings from the unit.  The stock offers “at least 50 percent upside for the
patient investor,” Heinonen said. “New management has an
impressive record.”  Cargotec named  Finnair Oyj (FIA1S) ’s Mika Vehvilaeinen as chief
executive officer last week. Vehvilaeinen starts in the role at
the beginning of next month. The company reports fourth-quarter
earnings on Feb. 12  Cargotec’s share price will match its current stock price
in the next 12 months, according to an  estimate  of six analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg. The 12-month price estimate of 21.67
euros is the highest since Oct. 15, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
