Facebook Inc. (FB)  tumbled the most in
more than four months after predicting that the average revenue
per user will decline as the social network expands in regions
such as Asia where advertising spending is lower.  The shares dropped 5.5 percent to $28.11 at the close in
 New York , the biggest decline since Sept. 24. The  stock  has
fallen 26 percent since an initial public offering in May,
compared with an 11 percent gain for the Nasdaq Composite Index.  Worldwide, Facebook generated an average revenue of $5.32
per user last year, an increase of 6 percent from 2011, the
 Menlo Park , California-based company said in a regulatory
filing. Global growth will decline in the first quarter of 2013,
“driven by seasonality,” and may continue to slump as
membership gains are bigger in  Asia  and other markets where ad
spending lags behind the U.S., Facebook said.  “While we never modeled it, we had been hoping Facebook ad
revenue could potentially increase,” Doug Anmuth, an analyst at
JPMorgan Chase & Co., wrote in a research report today. He
estimates that sales will fall 8 percent in the current period
from the fourth quarter, driven in part by a 12 percent decline
in average revenue per user.  While fourth-quarter  sales  topped analysts’ estimates,
mobile advertising was a concern for some investors. Mobile
contributed 23 percent of total ad revenue, or about $306
million, according to Facebook. That compares with 14 percent in
the third quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
