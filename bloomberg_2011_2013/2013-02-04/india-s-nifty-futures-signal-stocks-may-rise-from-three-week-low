Indian (SENSEX)  stocks declined for the third
day, led by state-owned lenders after Bank of Baroda’s profit
missed analysts’ estimates.  The BSE  India  Sensitive Index, or Sensex, lost 0.2 percent
to 19,741.77, according to preliminary closing prices, erasing
gains of as much as 0.6 percent.  State Bank of India , the
nation’s biggest lender, tumbled the most in three months. Bank
of Baroda, which is not a part of the Sensex, plunged the most
since October 2008.  Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd. (BHEL) , India’s
biggest power-equipment maker, decreased 3 percent.  The Sensex closed on Feb. 1 at its lowest levels since Jan.
11 amid concern over valuations as earnings from Bharti Airtel
Ltd., India’s largest cell-phone operator, and Bharat Heavy
Electricals trailed estimates. The Sensex declined 1.6 percent
last week, the most since the week ended Nov. 16, even as the
Reserve Bank of India cut interest rates on Jan. 29.  “The rally is not getting the support from macro or
earnings numbers,” Alex Mathews, head of research at Geojit BNP
Paribas Financial Services Ltd., said in a phone interview from
Kochi, South India. “ Bank of Baroda (BOB) ’s earnings triggered a
selloff in state-owned lenders.”  Nine of the 10 biggest losers on the 60-member  BSE India
Public Sector Undertakings (BSETPSU)  were state-owned lenders, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. The gauge fell 1.7 percent, the
most among 13 sectoral indexes of the BSE Ltd.  To contact the reporter on this story:
