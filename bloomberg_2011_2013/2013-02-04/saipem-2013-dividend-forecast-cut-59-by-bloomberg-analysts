Saipem SpA (SPM) ,  Europe ’s largest oil-
services provider, had its dividend forecast cut by 59 percent
by Bloomberg analysts.  The company’s dividend from 2013 earnings to be paid in
2014 was forecast to decrease to 35 euro cents a share from a
previous estimate of 85 cents. The forecast for Saipem’s 2012
dividend was also cut, by 6.7 percent, Bloomberg analysts said
today in a note.  The company tumbled a record 34 percent on Jan. 30 after it
announced that 2013 earnings before interest and tax would be
less than half the amount expected. Saipem was scheduled to meet
Italy’s market regulator Consob today as Consob investigates a
stock sale of almost 10 million shares, or 2.3 percent of the
company, made prior to the company’s statement.  The seller, who hired Bank of America Corp. to manage the
sale, hasn’t been named.  Saipem’s shares gained 2.9 percent to 20.68 euros in Milan
today as of 11:04 a.m. local time.  To contact the reporters on this story:
