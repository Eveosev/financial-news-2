U.S.  Gulf Coast imports  of light
crude will probably drop to zero by 2014 amid North America’s
“unprecedented oil boom,” according to Bank of America Corp.  Shipments of light-grade crudes to the U.S. region, which
are currently about 500,000 barrels a day, will decline as
domestic production displaces imports, the bank said in a note
dated yesterday. Light-crude accounts for 15 percent of U.S.
 total imports , compared with 20 percent a two years ago.  “Rising volumes of light crude from  Texas  and North Dakota
steadily displaced the need for seaborne imports of similar
quality from places like Nigeria and  Angola ,” Sabine Schels, a
commodity strategist at BofA in London said. “With
transportation infrastructure now expanding significantly, more
and more of these domestic light crudes will travel to the major
refining centers around the country, particularly the Gulf
Coast.”  The increase in domestic light-crude output won’t displace
imports of heavier grades because of demand for distillate
products such as diesel and heating oil.  “We estimate that running light crude through complex
refineries could restrict throughput by 20 percent to as much as
50 percent,” the bank said. “Further, if refiners blend
domestic light supplies with heavy imported grades they will
likely produce too many light ends and not enough distillates.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
