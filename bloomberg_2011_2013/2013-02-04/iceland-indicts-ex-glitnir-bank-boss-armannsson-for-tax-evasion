Iceland indicted the former chief
executive officer of failed lender Glitnir Bank hf, Bjarni Armannsson, for  tax evasion .  Armannsson failed to declare capital-gains income, interest
income and the proceeds of dividends, or 199 million kronur
($1.6 million) for the 2006 to 2008 tax years, Iceland’s Special
Prosecutor’s Office said in the Dec. 17 indictment, according to
documents released by the office today.  A call to Armannsson’s mobile phone seeking comment after
regular business hours was unanswered.  Armannsson was the head of Glitnir from 2000 until 2007.
The bank was one of several debt-laden Icelandic banks to fail
in October 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
