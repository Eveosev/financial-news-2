Chinese equities slid the most since
June in New York as  China Petroleum and Chemical Corp.  sank on
plans to sell shares at a discount and  Youku Tudou Inc. (YOKU)  tumbled
after being downgraded.  The  Bloomberg China-US Equity Index (CH55BN)  of the most-traded
Chinese shares in the U.S. fell 3.1 percent to 97.87 yesterday,
the lowest level this year. American depositary receipts of
Sinopec, Asia’s biggest refiner, slipped the most in a year,
while video company Youku Tudou posted the biggest drop in two
months after Maxim Group LLC cut the stock to sell from hold.
 Sohu.com Inc. (SOHU)  slumped the most since April after forecasting
first quarter net income that came below analysts’ estimates.  Sinopec, which has  rallied  35 percent from a Sept. 6 low in
Hong Kong, plans to raise about HK$24 billion ($3.1 billion)
selling so-called H shares at $8.45 apiece, a 9.5 percent
discount to the level they closed at yesterday. The Beijing-
based company -- which will use the cash for “general corporate
purposes,” according to the filing -- may buy $8 billion of
assets outside of China from its parent, the Wall Street Journal
reported last month.  “Usually a discount is offered when the market is bad and
this one is a bit too big given their share prices have posted
quite some gains since September,” Michael Ding, lead manager
of the  China Region Fund (USCOX)  at U.S. Global Investors Inc., which
oversees $2.2 billion, said in a telephone interview from San
Antonio,  Texas . “It looks like they need funds for investment
and working capital.”  Discount Widens  The  iShares FTSE China 25 Index Fund (FXI) , the largest Chinese
 exchange-traded fund  in the U.S., lost 2.8 percent to $40.63,
the biggest drop since June. The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX) 
declined 1.2 percent to 1,495.71 after data showed American
factory orders rose less than estimated in December.  Sinopec’s ADRs dropped 7.2 percent to $112.57, the biggest
slump since Feb. 21. Its ADRs, each representing 100 underlying
shares, traded 6.6 percent below its Hong Kong stock, the widest
discount since December 2008.  The company plans to sell 2.85 billion new shares, or 3.2
percent of total outstanding stock, before Feb. 14, according to
a filing yesterday. The shares will also be offered in the U.S.
to qualified institutional buyers, it said in a separate
statement. Beijing-based Sinopec  last  offered new equities
raising HK$10.7 billion in March 2005, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  Profitability Unlikely  Youku Tudou, formed from a merger of  China ’s biggest video
websites, tumbled 7.2 percent to $21.59, losing the most since
Dec. 4. Tudou will probably add 20 percent sales growth to the
combined company this year while its costs may increase by 50
percent, making profitability unlikely before 2014, Echo He, an
analyst in New York at Maxim, wrote in an e-mailed report
yesterday.  Sohu, a Beijing-based operator of games and video websites,
slid 5.6 percent to $46.49 in New York, the largest decline
since April.  The company forecast adjusted earnings of as much as 55
cents per share for the first quarter, according to a statement
yesterday. That was below the 77-cent  average estimate  of five
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Sohu’s fourth-quarter net income
dropped 8 percent to $23 million, the company said, compared
with a $21.2 million average of seven analysts’ estimates
compiled by Bloomberg.  Sohu said first-quarter sales may rise as much as 32
percent from a year earlier to $299 million, more than the $280
million average by analysts.  The company’s price estimate was  lowered  to $56 from $62
yesterday at JPMorgan Chase & Co.  Baidu Forecast  Baidu Inc. (BIDU) , owner of China’s most-used search engine,
declined 6 percent to $102 after the close of trading yesterday.
The Beijing-based company forecast first-quarter sales will rise
at least 38 percent to $945.4 million, compared with a $967
million mean projection of 10 analysts in a Bloomberg survey.
Its fourth-quarter profit of $1.28 per ADR was in line with
estimates.  Implied volatility, the key gauge of options prices, for
one-month contracts closest to Baidu’s ADRs was 5 points higher
than that for Sohu Jan. 29, the widest gap since January 2011,
data compiled by Bloomberg show. Investors are concerned rising
costs and competition will erode profit, Ming Zhao, founder of
86Research Ltd., the Beijing-based equity research firm, said in
a phone interview Feb. 1.  Jordan Deal  E-House China Holdings Ltd. (EJ) , a Shanghai-based property
agent, slid for a fifth day, dropping 5.5 percent to a one-month
low of $4.6. Suntech Power Holdings Co., the world’s biggest
solar-panel maker, tumbled 7.6 percent to $1.58, the biggest
loss since Jan. 7.  Yingli Green Energy Holding Co., the world’s biggest
silicon-based solar panel maker by capacity, added 1.3 percent
to $3.09, the highest since May 16. The Baoding, China-based
company has supplied 65 kilowatts of photovoltaic modules to
Jordan’s Kawkabuna for Energy Solutions, it said yesterday in a
statement. That is Yingli’s first order in the Jordanian market.  New Phoenix Media Ltd. (FENG) , the Beijing-based Internet, TV and
mobile-news provider, climbed 2.2 percent to $3.66 yesterday in
New York, the highest level in three months.  Intel Corp., the Santa Clara, California-based chipmaker,
owned 5.4 percent in New Phoenix shares by the end of 2012, the
U.S. company said in a regulatory filing yesterday.  Zoomlion Denies  ADRs of Zoomlion Heavy Industry Science & Technology Co.,
China’s second-biggest construction-equipment maker, dropped 4.7
percent to $13.15 in U.S. over-the-counter trading, the largest
slump since Oct. 25.  The company denied allegations in a press article published
yesterday that it had reported fictitious sales and falsified
accounts, according to its filing to the Hong Kong stock
exchange.  Thirty-day volatility  on the China-US gauge rose to 19.4
yesterday, the highest level since Dec. 10 and compared with an
average of 18.3 over the past six months. The  Bloomberg Chinese
Reverse Mergers Index (CHINARTO) , which tracks a basket of companies that
gained U.S. listings after buying firms that already trade,
retreated 1.3 percent from a nine-month high to 79.1.  The  Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  dropped 0.5 percent
to 12,156.58 yesterday, after rallying 1.8 percent last week.
The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  of domestic Chinese shares gained
0.4 percent to 2,428.15, climbing for a sixth day in the longest
stretch of gains since Feb. 28 last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
