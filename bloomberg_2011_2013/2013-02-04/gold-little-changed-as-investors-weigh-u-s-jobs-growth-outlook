Platinum futures rose to the highest
in almost 17 weeks as output declined at  Anglo American Platinum
Ltd. (AMS) , the world’s biggest producer. Palladium extended a rally
to the highest since September 2011, and gold gained.  Anglo American, based in Johannesburg, reported a loss for
2012 as production of the refined metal dropped 8.8 percent
while costs surged. “Supply challenges” will continue this
year, the company said. Global output slumped 10 percent in
2012, Johnson Matthey Plc has estimated.  “The fundamentals are very bullish,” James Cordier, the
founder of Optionsellers.com in Tampa,  Florida , said in a
telephone interview. “Prices will remain high as end-users are
rushing to secure supplies.”  Platinum futures for April delivery rose 0.6 percent to
settle at $1,698.10 an ounce at 1:10 p.m. on the New York
Mercantile Exchange. Earlier, the price reached $1,709, the
highest for a most-active contract since Oct. 9. The metal has
gained 10 percent this year.  Platinum and related metals may have “price spikes” this
year and next because of higher consumption and a lack of
investment in mines, JPMorgan Chase & Co. said on Jan. 31.
Autocatalysts account for 33 percent of global demand, while
industrial applications make up 28 percent, according to Johnson
Matthey.  Palladium futures for March delivery rose 0.2 percent to
$757.80 on the Nymex. Earlier, the price reached $761.90, the
highest since Sept. 9, 2011.  Gold futures for April delivery gained 0.3 percent to
$1,676.40 an ounce on the Comex in New York.  Silver futures for March delivery slid 0.8 percent to
$31.716 an ounce on the Comex. As of Feb. 1, inventory climbed 6
percent this year to 157.1 million ounces, the highest since
1997, exchange data show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
