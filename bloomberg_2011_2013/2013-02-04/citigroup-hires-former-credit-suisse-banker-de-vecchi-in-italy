Citigroup Inc. (C)  hired Luigi de Vecchi
for the newly created role of chairman of continental Europe for
corporate and investment banking, starting in May.  De Vecchi, who will be based in Milan, was previously the
global co-head of investment banking at  Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) 
for three years, Citigroup’s James Bardrick and Manuel Falco,
co-heads of banking for Europe, the  Middle East  and Africa, said
in a memorandum to employees today. The contents of the document
were confirmed by a spokeswoman at Citigroup in London.  “Continental Europe remains one of our largest growth
opportunities, and we look forward to leveraging Luigi’s deal
experience and relationships across the region and further
strengthen our Italian franchise,” Bardrick and Falco wrote.  Citigroup Chief Executive Officer  Michael Corbat  in January
overhauled management of regional operations outside the U.S.,
naming Jim Cowles CEO of Europe, the Middle East and Africa. The
bank also appointed Linos Lekkas as head of investment banking
for Central Europe, Middle East and Africa last month as the
third-biggest U.S. lender reorganizes staff amid job cuts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
