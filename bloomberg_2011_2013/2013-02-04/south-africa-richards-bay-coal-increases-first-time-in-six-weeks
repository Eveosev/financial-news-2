Coal export prices at South Africa’s
Richards Bay, the continent’s biggest terminal for shipping the
fuel, increased for the first time in six weeks.  Coal for  immediate delivery  gained $1.08, or 1.3 percent,
to $85.92 a metric ton in the week to Feb. 1, according to IHS
McCloskey data on Bloomberg. That’s the first weekly gain since
Dec. 21.  The fuel is quoted on a free-on-board basis, which excludes
delivery costs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
