Russia  may allow imports of Georgian
wine by the spring, seven years after a ban was imposed, public
health chief Gennady Onishchenko said, RIA reported.  Russia is sending staff to inspect Georgian wineries that
have applied for a resumption of shipments, Onishchenko said
following talks with Georgian officials, according to RIA.
Registering Georgian goods in Russia will be the next step,
followed by “access to the Russian market via customs,” he
said.  A ban on Georgian wine and mineral water was imposed in
2006 after a spy scandal. It deprived the Caucasus nation of its
biggest foreign market for the products. Russia extended the
embargo to postal and transport links after the two countries
fought a war in 2008 over a Georgian breakaway region. Flights
were resumed in 2010.  To contact the reporters on this story:
