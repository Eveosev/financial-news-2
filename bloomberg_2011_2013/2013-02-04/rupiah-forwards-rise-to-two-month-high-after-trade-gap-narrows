Indonesia ’s rupiah forwards reached
the strongest level in almost two months after the country’s
trade deficit narrowed.  December’s  shortfall  was $155 million, according to a
report released Feb. 1. That compared to a revised $618 million
gap in November and $1.9 billion in October. Overseas investors
bought $179 million more local stocks than they sold last week
and added 2.32 trillion rupiah ($240 million) to their local-
currency sovereign debt holdings in the four days through Jan.
31, exchange and finance ministry data show.  “The trade deficit looks to be on a narrowing trend,”
said Mika Martumpal, a currency analyst at PT Bank CIMB Niaga in
Jakarta. “When the  trade gap  closes, considering the strong
capital inflows to Indonesia, there would be no other way for
the rupiah to go but up.”  One-month non-deliverable forwards rose 0.2 percent to
9,670 per dollar as of 3:49 p.m. in Jakarta, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. They reached 9,660 earlier, the highest level
since Dec. 6. The contracts were very close to the spot rate,
which advanced 0.5 percent to 9,667, according to prices from
local banks.  A daily  fixing  used to settle the derivative contracts was
set at 9,679 today by the Association of Banks in  Singapore .  Dollar Supply  The spot rate was stronger than the offshore fixing for the
first time in six weeks on Feb. 1. The central bank has been
increasing the supply of dollars in the domestic market to
reduce the disparity since the second week of January, Hendar,
 executive director  for monetary policy at  Bank Indonesia , said
in a Jan. 28 interview. Like many Indonesians, he goes by only
one name.  “With the narrowing difference between the rupiah’s
onshore and offshore levels, participants in the  currency market 
will be confident of sufficient dollar supply,” Bank Indonesia
spokesman Difi Johansyah said in a mobile-phone message today.  One-month implied volatility for the rupiah, which measures
expected moves in exchange rates used to price options, was
steady at 6.5 percent.  Consumer-price gains accelerated to 4.6 percent last month
from 4.3 percent in December, the government reported on Feb. 1.
The yield on the 5.625 percent bonds due May 2023 was little
changed at 5.26 percent, according to prices from the Inter
Dealer Market Association.  To contact the reporter on this story:
