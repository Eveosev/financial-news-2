Egypt  will hold parliamentary
elections within 2 months, the independent al-Masry al-Youm
newspaper said today, citing presidential spokesman Yasser Ali.  The Shura Council, the upper house of parliament, has until
the end of this month to determine the date of the vote, the
Cairo-based paper reported.  An opposition proposal to form a government of national
salvation before the parliamentary elections has been rejected,
Al-Masry cited Ali as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
