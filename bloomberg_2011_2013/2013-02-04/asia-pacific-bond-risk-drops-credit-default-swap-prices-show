 The cost of insuring corporate and
sovereign bonds against non-payment in the Asia-Pacific region
fell, according to traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index dropped two basis points
to 117 basis points as of 11:26 a.m. in Sydney, according to
Westpac Banking Corp. prices. The benchmark is set to extend its
decline this year to 10.5 basis points, after retreating for a
fifth straight month in January, according to data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  decreased two basis points to 113 as of
8:26 a.m. in  Hong Kong , Westpac prices show. The gauge climbed
2.8 basis points in January, rising for a second consecutive
month, according to CMA, which is owned by McGraw-Hill Cos. and
compiles prices quoted by dealers in the private market.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index fell one basis point to 128
basis points as of 9:28 a.m. in  Tokyo , according to Citigroup
Inc. prices. The measure is headed for its lowest level since
August 2011, CMA prices show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
