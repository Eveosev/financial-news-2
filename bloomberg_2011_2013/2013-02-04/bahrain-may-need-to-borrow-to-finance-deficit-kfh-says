Bahrain may need to borrow to finance
its  budget deficit  as spending is expected to top revenue this
year,  Kuwait Finance House (KFIN)  said.  The smallest Gulf Cooperation Council economy may see a
deficit that is equal to 6.1 percent of its gross domestic
product this year, as spending is expected to reach $9.2
billion, the bank said in an e-mailed report today, citing a
Finance Ministry draft budget.  Bahrain based its fiscal budget on oil prices of $90 per
barrel, $10 more than a year ago and more than double the price
it used in 2010, the bank said. The kingdom will need an oil
price of $103.80 to break even, the bank forecast.  To contact the reporter on this story:
