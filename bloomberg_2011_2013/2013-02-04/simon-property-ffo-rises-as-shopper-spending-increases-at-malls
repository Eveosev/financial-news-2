Simon Property Group Inc. (SPG) , the
largest U.S. mall owner, reported funds from operations that
beat analysts’ estimates amid increased shopper spending at its
regional retail centers and outlet malls.  FFO, which gauges a property company’s ability to generate
cash, climbed in the fourth quarter to $827.4 million, or $2.29
a share, from $678.9 million, or $1.91, a year earlier, the real
estate investment trust said today in a statement. The  average 
estimate of 19 analysts in a Bloomberg survey was $2.17 a share.  Demand for space at regional malls is rising, helping to
boost revenue at Indianapolis-based Simon. U.S. retail sales
excluding autos  advanced  4.1 percent in December from a year
earlier, according to data from the Commerce Department. Simon
is the U.S.’s biggest owner of both regional malls and outlet
centers, where retailers sell at a discount.  “They’re doing very well,”  Rich Moore , an analyst at  RBC
Capital Markets  in Solon,  Ohio , said in a telephone interview
before earnings were announced. “The notion that there are
bargains to be had at the outlet center is enticing to people.”  Simon raised its quarterly  dividend  to $1.15 a share from
$1.10, the sixth straight increase.  Fourth-quarter revenue rose 15 percent from a year earlier
to $1.34 billion. Occupancies at Simon’s U.S. properties climbed
to 95.3 percent from 94.6 percent. The base minimum rent in the
quarter was $40.73 a square foot, up from $39.40 a year earlier.
Tenant sales increased 6.6 percent to $568 a square foot.  The company estimates that FFO for the year will be $8.40
to $8.50 a share. The 19 estimates of analysts in a Bloomberg
survey is $8.42. For 2012, FFO was $7.98 a share.  Fourth-quarter results were announced before the start of
regular U.S. trading. Simon rose 1.1 percent to $161.97 on Feb.
