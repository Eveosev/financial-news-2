Copper futures fell from a four-month
high in  New York  as signs of political turmoil in  Europe 
rekindled concerns that the region’s debt crisis will erode
global economic growth and commodity demand.  Spanish bonds dropped as Premier  Mariano Rajoy  faces
opposition calls to resign amid contested reports about illegal
payments. The  dollar  strengthened against the euro, reducing the
appeal of raw materials as alternative investments. A  gauge  of
six industrial metals has declined 3.4 percent in the past 12
months.  “Concerns over Europe may be working to lower metal
prices, especially as the dollar firms up,” Sterling Smith, a
futures specialist at Citigroup Inc. in Chicago, said in a
telephone interview.  Copper futures for March delivery fell 0.4 percent to
close at $3.7685 a pound at 1:09 p.m. on the Comex in New York. 
Earlier, the price reached $3.7925, the highest for a most-active
contract since Oct. 5, on signs of economic optimism in  China ,
the world’s top user of the metal, and the U.S., the second-
biggest.  Hedge funds  and other large speculators reduced their
copper net-long positions by 12 percent to 14,448 futures and
options contracts in the week ended Jan. 29, government data
show. That’s the lowest since Dec. 4.  On the London Metal Exchange, copper for delivery in three
months climbed 0.2 percent to $8,305 a metric ton ($3.77 a
pound). Nickel and zinc also rose, while aluminum declined. Tin
and lead were unchanged.  To contact the reporter on this story:
