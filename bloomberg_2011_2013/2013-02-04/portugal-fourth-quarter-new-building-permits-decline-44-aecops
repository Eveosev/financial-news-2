Portuguese construction companies are
suffering from record-low demand for new projects after their
order book fell 44 percent in the last quarter of 2012 from the
same period a year earlier.  “The unprecedented drop in demand in 2012 is considered by
businessmen to be one of the main factors hampering activity”
in the sector,  Portugal ’s Association of Public Works and
Construction, or AECOPS, said in a statement today.  The slump in the country’s building sector has hurt cement
consumption, which dropped 27 percent last year to the lowest
level since 1973, AECOPS said. Unemployment in the sector rose
34 percent in the eleven months through November, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
