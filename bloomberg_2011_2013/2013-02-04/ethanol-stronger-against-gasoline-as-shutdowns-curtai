Ethanol strengthened against gasoline
on speculation that plant shutdowns will help drain a glut of
the biofuel and lift prices.  The  spread  narrowed 2.61 cents a gallon to 55.15 cents as
at least five mills have been idled this year and the most
recent Energy Information Administration report showed
 production  at the lowest level since the agency began tracking
weekly data in June 2010.  “The number of plant closures is definitely going to start
taking a toll,” said Michael Slider, director of biofuels at
Elgin, Iowa-based Fauser Energy Resources. “It’s going to get
tight pretty quick and prices will go up.”  Denatured ethanol for March delivery fell 1.6 cents, or 0.6
percent, to $2.46 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade.  Gasoline for March delivery dropped 4.21 cents, or 1.4
percent, to $3.0115 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . The contract covers reformulated gasoline, which is
made to be blended with ethanol.  Ethanol for February delivery decreased 2.9 cents, or 1.2
percent, to $2.44 a gallon. The contract expires tomorrow.
Prices have gained 11 percent this year.  Production fell 2.8 percent to 770,000 barrels a day in the
week ended Jan. 25, from the previous week, or 11.8 billion
gallons on an annualized basis, the EIA report showed.  Slowing Production  Ag Processing Inc., a grains processor, on Feb. 1 became
the latest company to stop operations, idling its plant in
Hastings,  Nebraska , because of high corn prices.  Valero Energy Corp. (VLO) ,  Abengoa SA (ABG) , Poet LLC, White Energy
Inc. and  Biofuel Energy Corp. (BIOF)  are among the producers that have
temporarily shut distilleries after drought conditions in the
Midwest reduced corn yield, increasing prices. Nineteen ethanol
plants have been idled since June as the drought wilted the corn
crop, according to the  Renewable Fuels Association , a
Washington-based trade group.  Corn for March delivery fell 1.75 cents to $7.3425 a bushel
in Chicago. One bushel makes at least 2.75 gallons of ethanol.
The crush spread, or the price of ethanol minus the price of the
corn needed to make it, is minus 21 cents a gallon.  The biofuel slipped in most spot market regions. The
additive fell 0.5 cent to $2.57 a gallon in  New York , 0.5 cent
to $2.48 in Chicago and 0.5 cent to $2.63 on the West Coast and
was unchanged at $2.52 a gallon in the U.S. Gulf, data compiled
by Bloomberg show.  Renewable Fuels  Under a 2007 energy law, U.S. refiners are to use 13.8
billion gallons of renewable fuels, such as ethanol this year
and 15 billion by 2015.  Stockpiles rose 2.3 percent to 20.5 million barrels, the
highest since Dec. 14, the EIA report showed. Ethanol-blended
gasoline made up 87 percent of the total U.S. gasoline pool in
the week ended Jan. 25, down from 90 percent a year earlier.  Slider said an influx of Brazilian supply into states in
the Southeastern U.S., such as  Florida , has exacerbated the glut
of the fuel and displaced product from the ethanol-dense
Midwest.  “If it fills up tanks in Florida, that stops shipments
from the Midwest,” Slider said. “Definitely the Florida market
is well supplied by imports and you can even say oversupplied.”  Imports averaged 9,000 barrels a day in the week ended Jan.
25, up 80 percent from a year earlier, EIA data showed.  Spot ethanol in Sao Paulo  cost $2.21 a gallon last week,
data compiled by Bloomberg show, about 9.4 percent cheaper than
today’s U.S. futures price. Imports from  Brazil  totaled 1.4
million barrels in November, more than double the amount from a
year earlier, Energy Department show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
