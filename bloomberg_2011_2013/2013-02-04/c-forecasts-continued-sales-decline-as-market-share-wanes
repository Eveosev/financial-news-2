HTC Corp. (2498)  forecast its sixth
consecutive decline in quarterly sales as the Taiwanese
smartphone maker faces a loss of market share to Chinese rivals.  First-quarter revenue will be NT$50 billion ($1.7 billion)
to NT$60 billion, the Taoyuan, Taiwan-based company said in a
statement today. That’s below the NT$64.8 billion average of 19
analyst  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  HTC dropped out of the global top five by smartphone market
share last quarter as  Samsung Electronics Co. (005930) , Huawei
Technologies Co. and  ZTE Corp. (000063)  gained share. A new smartphone,
codenamed M7, to be unveiled this month may help boost sales and
shipments next quarter.  “The M7 could enter mass production in late February, with
shipments ramping up from 1 million in 1Q13 to 2.5 million in
2Q13,” Birdy Lu, who rates the stock  hold  at Daiwa Securities
Co. in Taipei, wrote in a Feb. 1 report. Sales may rise as much
as 20 percent in the second quarter from the current period, he
wrote.  Net income  dropped  91 percent last quarter to NT$1 billion,
the lowest in eight years, the company reported Jan. 7. Revenue
of NT$60 billion and operating profit of NT$600 million were
equal to its own guidance  given  Oct. 26.  Gross Margin  HTC fell 1.6 percent to NT$285.50 at the close of trading
in Taipei before the earnings were announced, taking its decline
to 5 percent this year following a 40 percent drop  last year .  Gross margin will be from 21 percent to 23 percent, lagging
the 24 percent average of 17 analyst estimates compiled by
Bloomberg. Operating margin will be 0.5 percent to 1 percent.  Gross margin was 23 percent in the fourth quarter and
operating margin was 1 percent, it said.  Net income is expected to be NT$2.56 billion in the first
quarter, according to the average of 17 analyst estimates
compiled by Bloomberg. HTC doesn’t provide net income guidance.  HTC, whose global smartphone share climbed to 10.7 percent
in the second quarter of 2011, posted a 25 percent drop in
shipments last year,  according  to IDC. Its declining share put
it outside the top five, with less than 4.3 percent in the
fourth quarter, the researcher said Jan. 24.  Samsung, Huawei, Sony and ZTE all gained share for the
period, it said. Shenzhen, China-based Huawei, with 90 percent
shipment growth, climbed to become the world’s third-largest
vendor in the third quarter.  “We’re most confident now because last year we achieved a
lot, and we changed a lot,” Chief Executive Officer Peter Chou
told employees Feb. 1 at the company’s year-end party after
showing off the M7 handset which will be released at press
conferences in  London  and  New York  on Feb. 19.  HTC named a new marketing chief in November following the
appointment of Chang to the CFO post in April and a new North
America Chief in July. In an internal e-mail, Chou told
employees in August to “kill bureaucracy,” according to a copy
obtained by  Bloomberg News .  A global patent battle with Apple Inc. was settled during
the fourth-quarter after HTC agreed to pay royalty to the iPhone
maker. Terms of the deal weren’t disclosed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
