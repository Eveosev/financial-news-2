The Euro Stoxx 50 Index will decline
after futures trading on the gauge of euro-area stocks formed a
pattern that indicates the recent rally has reached its end,
according to a technical analyst at BBSP SAS in Paris.  Euro Stoxx 50  futures  on Jan. 31 made a bearish price flip,
meaning the closing price on that day was lower than the final
price four trading sessions earlier.  “This reflects a change of dynamic in the short term,”
Jean-Charles Gand, a senior market strategist at the brokerage,
said in a telephone interview. “Friday’s close didn’t reverse
this and today if we close at the same levels, it will be
confirmed again. I would look to benefit from a correction to
reinforce positions.”  Gand said futures expiring in March may drop to 2,664.5,
during the next five days. In the longer term, Gand has a year-
end target for the Euro Stoxx 50 of 3,710, which represents a 37
percent rally from the close on Jan. 31. The equity benchmark
slid 1.2 percent to 2,677.4 at 12.30 p.m. in  London  today. The
Euro Stoxx 50 has climbed for the last eight months, its longest
such winning streak since July 1998.  The world’s developed stock markets have posted their best
start to a year for two decades. The MSCI World Index of
equities in 24 markets rose 5 percent in January, its biggest
advance since 1994, as individual investors pumped record
deposits into mutual funds, U.S. profits increased for an 11th
quarter, central banks held  interest rates  at record lows and
growth from  Europe  to  China  improved.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
