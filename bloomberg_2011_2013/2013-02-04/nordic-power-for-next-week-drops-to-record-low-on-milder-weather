Nordic electricity for delivery next
week fell after forecasts for milder temperatures pointed to
lower heating demand.  Baseload power, for delivery around the clock, declined as
much as 4.9 percent to 40.05 euros ($54.43) a megawatt-hour, a
record for the  contract , and traded at 41 euros as of 3:49 p.m.
on Nasdaq OMX Group Inc.’s energy exchange in Oslo.  Low temperatures in  Stockholm  may rise to zero degrees
Celsius (32 Fahrenheit) on Feb. 6 from minus 3 today, according
to CustomWeather Inc. data on Bloomberg. Milder weather damps
demand for electric heating in the region, which meets more than
half its power needs by running water through turbines.  EU carbon permits for December erased earlier losses,
rising 2.5 percent to 4.49 euros a metric ton on the ICE Futures
Europe exchange in  London . Carbon prices can influence
generating costs at coal and gas-fed plants.  The benchmark near-quarter electricity contract gained 1.1
percent to 35.95 euros a megawatt-hour after losing 7 percent
since Jan. 16 on Nasdaq OMX.  “We think there is a good chance of the near-quarter power
price climbing further upward after the recent losses,” Swedish
bank SEB AB said today in an e-mailed statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
