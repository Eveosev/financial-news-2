JFE Holdings Inc. (5411) , Japan’s second-
biggest steelmaker, rose to its highest in 19 months and led a
rally in shares of domestic mills amid optimism a weakening yen
and demand growth will boost earnings.  JFE Holdings surged as much as 10.3 percent to 2,256 yen,
its highest intraday level since July 7, 2011, on the Tokyo
Stock Exchange. It traded 9.4 percent higher as of 1:11 p.m.
local time.  Kobe Steel (5406)  gained 9.3 percent to 129 yen, while
 Nippon Steel & Sumitomo Metal Corp. (5401)  rose 9 percent, its biggest
increase in two years, to 278 yen.  The 32-member Topix Iron & Steel Index was the biggest
gainer among industry gauges, climbing as much as 7.7 percent.  A weaker yen will benefit Japanese steelmakers by making
their products cheaper than those from Asian rivals in overseas
markets. Steel sales in  Japan  and abroad will grow on demand
from infrastructure projects and carmakers, said Masayuki Otani,
a Tokyo-based strategist at Securities Japan Inc. The shares are
rallying on these expectations, he said.  The Japanese currency fell to 92.97 per dollar on Feb. 1,
the weakest since May 2010. The yen rose 0.1 percent to 92.70 as
of 12:31 p.m. in Tokyo today.  Daiwa Securities Co. analyst Jiro Iokibe upgraded his
rating on JFE Holdings to buy from neutral, according to an
investor note dated Feb. 1. JFE Holdings last week reported a
profit in its fiscal third quarter, compared with a loss a year
earlier, aided by lower costs and a weaker yen.  To contact the reporter on this story:
