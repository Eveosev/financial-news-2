BP Plc sold two cargoes of  North Sea 
Forties crude at the lowest differential in more than two weeks.
Petraco SpA failed to buy Russian Urals grade.  Daily exports of Brent, Forties, Oseberg and Ekofisk
crudes, which make up the Dated Brent benchmark, will decrease
by 12 percent in March from this month, loading programs
obtained by Bloomberg News show.  North Sea  BP sold Forties lot F0212 to Total SA for loading on Feb.
17 to Feb. 19 at 25 cents more than Dated Brent, a Bloomberg
survey of traders and brokers monitoring the Platts pricing
window showed. That compares with deals on Jan. 22 at premiums
of 35 and 40 cents and is the lowest since a Jan. 17 trade at 20
cents more than the benchmark  Trafigura Beheer BV bought Forties consignment F0218 from
BP at a 30 cent premium to the benchmark, the survey showed. The
cargo will on Feb. 24 to Feb. 26, two days earlier than
originally scheduled, making it the third lot for loading this
month to be advanced, according to two people with knowledge of
the matter.  Total failed to buy the grade loading Feb. 15 to Feb. 23 at
a premium of 55 cents while Morgan Stanley bid for a Feb. 26 to
March 3 cargo at plus 40 cents without finding a seller,
according to the survey.  Brent lot B0107 has been deferred by five days and will now
load from Feb. 3 to Feb. 5, according to three people with
knowledge of the matter.  Reported crude trading typically occurs during the Platts
window, which ends at 4:30 p.m.  London  time. Forties loading in
10 to 25 days fell 25 cents to 33 cents a barrel more than Dated
Brent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s the
lowest since Dec. 31.  Brent for March settlement traded at $116.02 a barrel on
the ICE Futures  Europe  exchange in London at the close of the
window, compared with $116.84 in the previous session. The April
contract was at $115.14, a discount of 88 cents to March.  BFOE exports will be 870,968 barrels a day versus 985,714
barrels in February, which was the highest in a year, according
to the plans. This month’s schedule includes one lot of Brent
that was deferred from January. Loadings in March will be the
lowest in two months.  Mediterranean/Urals  OAO Lukoil’s Litasco sold 140,000 tons of Urals to Eni SpA
at a discount of $1.20 to Dated Brent on a delivered basis to
Augusta,  Italy , the survey showed. That’s 20 cents less than its
unsuccessful offer in the previous session equals the lowest
trade since Oct. 2.  Petraco bid unsuccessfully for the blend loading Feb. 22 to
Feb. 26 at $1.60 less than Dated Brent on a delivered basis to
Rotterdam, the Platts survey showed. That compares with a Feb. 1
deal at a $1.55 discount.  The Urals discount to Dated Brent in the Mediterranean
widened by 37 cents a barrel to 72 cents, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. That’s the biggest differential since
Jan. 9. In northwest Europe, the  discount  was at $1.48, compared
with 96 cents in the previous session, the data show. That’s the
widest since Oct. 9.  West Africa  Benchmark Nigerian Qua Iboe blend was unchanged at $2.33 a
barrel more than Dated Brent, Bloomberg data show.  Vitol Group signed a long-term  management contract  with
Gabon Oil Co., according to Lucien Mboumba, an oil specialist
working in the Ministry of Petroleum and Energy in the country’s
capital, Libreville. He declined to disclose details of the
value or duration of the contract.  “Vitol will help GOC to manage and look after the state’s
portfolio in the  petroleum industry ,” Mboumba said. Gabon’s
export crude grades include Rabi Light, Rabi Blend and Mandji.  To contact the reporter on this story:
