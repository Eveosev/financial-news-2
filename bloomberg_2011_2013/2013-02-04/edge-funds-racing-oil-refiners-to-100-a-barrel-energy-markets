Hedge funds  and refiners vied to buy
oil futures last month, pushing crude to the highest level since
September, as the U.S. added jobs and expanded manufacturing
while the government said fuel demand will rebound this year.  Money managers increased net-long positions, or  wagers  on
rising U.S. prices, to a nine-month high of 218,604 in the week
ended Jan. 29, according to the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission’s Feb. 1 Commitments of Traders report. It was their
seventh week of increasing bullish positions, the longest run of
gains in records dating back to June 2006.  Oil climbed for an eighth week, the longest stretch of
weekly advances since 2004, on signs that economic growth is
accelerating. Bullish wagers held by refiners and producers
advanced for a fifth week to the most since at least June 2006.
The Energy Information Administration said that petroleum
consumption will rise in 2013 for the first time in three years.  “It looks like we’re headed for $100, if not higher, which
is getting the attention of both investors and commercial market
participants,”  John Kilduff , a partner at Again Capital LLC, a
New York-based energy hedge fund, said by phone Feb. 1,
referring to U.S. crude. “There’s been a lot of positive
economic news, supply jitters and a cutback in OPEC
production.”  West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. benchmark, advanced $1.33
a barrel, or 1.4 percent, to $97.57 on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  in the week covered by the report. WTI fell 1.2 percent
to $96.59 a barrel as of 10:19 a.m. in  New York .  OPEC Cutback  WTI oil gained 6.2 percent in January as positive economic
news bolstered demand forecasts, while the  Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries  cut output. Geopolitical unrest
including an attack on a gas plant in  Algeria  and civil war in
Syria spurred concern that there may be supply disruptions in
North Africa and the  Middle East .  Producers, merchants, processors and users switched to
 bullish wagers  last month after a bearish stretch dating back to
at least June 2006 that saw selling by producers outweigh buying
by refiners and other commercial users. The category increased
net-long positions by 271 futures and options combined, or 2.6
percent, to 10,840, the latest report showed.  “There’s been a significant rally since mid-December,”
Kilduff said. “The commercials have to cover their
vulnerabilities to what is now clearly a bullish market.”  Oil Demand  U.S. petroleum  consumption  will rise to 18.71 million
barrels a day in 2013 from 18.65 million last year, the EIA, an
arm of the U.S. Energy Department, said in its Jan. 8 Short-Term
Energy Outlook.  OPEC reduced production by 525,000 barrels a day, or 1.7
percent, in January to 30.5 million, the lowest level since
October 2011, according to a Bloomberg survey of  oil companies ,
producers and analysts.  “While the positive economic sentiment has provided a
strong base for this shift upward in prices, the sensitivity of
the oil markets to the multitude of geopolitical events has left
a greater impression over the past week,” Miswin Mahesh, an
analyst at Barclays Plc in London, said in a Feb. 1 note to
clients.  Futures gained 0.7 percent on Jan. 22 as German investor
confidence climbed more than economists expected.  Germany ’s ZEW
Center for European Economic Research said its index of investor
and analyst forecasts rose to 31.5, from 6.9 a month earlier.  WTI gained 0.8 percent on Jan. 24 after the Labor
Department said that applications for  unemployment  insurance
fell by 5,000 to 330,000 in the week ended Jan. 19, the fewest
in five years. In addition, the Conference Board’s measure of
the outlook for the next three to six months advanced by 0.5
percent, the New York-based group said.  Chinese Manufacturing  Manufacturing in  China  also expanded. The preliminary
reading of a  Purchasing Managers ’ Index was 51.9 in January,
according to a Jan. 24 statement from HSBC Holdings Plc and
Markit Economics. That compares with the 51.5 final reading for
December and the 51.7 median estimate in a Bloomberg survey.  The U.S. accounted for 21 percent of the world’s oil
consumption in 2011, according to  BP Plc (BP/) ’s Statistical Review of
World Energy. China, the second-biggest crude-consuming country,
was responsible for 11 percent of global demand, while Germany
used 2.7 percent.  Oil advanced to a four-month high on Jan. 28 after the
Commerce Department reported that U.S. orders for  durable goods 
had increased 4.6 percent in December. It was the first gain
since September, the data show.  Futures leapt again on Jan. 29 after  home prices  in 20 U.S.
cities climbed by the most in more than six years. The S&P/Case-
Shiller  index  of property values climbed 5.5 percent in November
from the same month in 2011, the biggest year-over-year gain
since August 2006.  Federal Reserve  Crude rose to $97.94 a barrel on Jan. 30 after the  Federal
Reserve  maintained its asset-buying program to bolster the
economy. The Fed said at the end of a two-day meeting that it
will keep purchasing securities at the rate of $85 billion a
month. It was the highest price since Sept. 14.  WTI futures capped the longest stretch of weekly gains in
more than eight years on Feb. 1 after the Labor Department said
that payrolls gained by 157,000 in January, and the  Institute
for Supply Management ’s factory index reached a nine-month high.  Net-long positions in WTI held by money managers, including
hedge funds, commodity pools and commodity-trading advisers,
jumped by 12,701 futures and options combined, or 6.2 percent,
the CFTC report showed.  Oil Trade Flow  “We are getting more overbought,”  Tim Evans , an energy
analyst at Citi Futures Perspective in New York, said by phone
Feb. 1. “The trade flow may continue, but there’s a
considerable contrast between accumulated long positions of WTI
oil futures and options and the market fundamentals.”  An oil boom in states including Texas,  Oklahoma  and  North
Dakota  has been flowing into storage. Inventories gained 5.9
million barrels in the week ended Jan. 25 to 369.1 million
barrels, the EIA reported last week.  America’s oil  production  averaged 6.993 million barrels a
day in the week ended Jan. 25, according to the EIA. Rising oil
and natural gas output helped the U.S. meet 84 percent of its
energy needs in the first 10 months of last year, on pace to be
the highest annual level since 1991, government data show.  In London, hedge funds and other money managers raised
 bullish bets  on  Brent crude  to 179,735 contracts, the highest
level in two years, according to weekly  data  released today by
ICE Futures Europe.  Gasoline Wagers  Hedge funds and other large speculators also increased
bullish U.S.  gasoline  wagers, adding 7,523 futures and options
combined, or 9.9 percent, to reach 83,915, the highest since
Oct. 16, according to CFTC data.  Gasoline futures gained 14.35 cents a gallon, or 5.1
percent, to $2.9734 in the week covered by the report before
rising to $3.0536 on Feb. 1, the highest since Sept. 28. Futures
declined 0.9 percent to $3.0256 as of 10:20 a.m. in New York.  Regular gasoline at the pump, averaged nationwide, advanced
for a 18th consecutive day to $3.523 a gallon yesterday,
according to Heathrow, Florida-based AAA, the largest U.S.
motoring group. It was the highest price since Oct. 29.  Money managers raised bets on U.S.  heating oil  by 4,337
futures and options combined, or 15 percent, to 33,427, the CFTC
report showed. Futures gained 1.3 percent to $3.1092 a gallon in
the week covered by the report and settled at $3.1606 on Feb. 1.
The fuel declined 0.2 percent to $3.1551 as of 10:22 a.m. in New
York today.  Net-long wagers on four U.S. natural gas contracts advanced
by 6,777 futures equivalents, or 5.7 percent, to 126,798 in the
week ended Jan. 29, according to the CFTC data. It was the
highest level since the week ended Nov. 27.  The measure includes an index of four contracts adjusted to
futures equivalents: Nymex natural gas futures, Nymex  Henry Hub 
Swap Futures, Nymex ClearPort Henry Hub Penultimate Swaps and
the ICE Futures U.S. Henry Hub contract. Henry Hub, in Erath,
 Louisiana , is the delivery point for Nymex futures, a benchmark
price for the fuel.  Natural gas fell 33.2 cents, or 9.3 percent, to $3.226 per
million British thermal units on the New York Mercantile
Exchange in the week covered by the report. The fuel advanced
