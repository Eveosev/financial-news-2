North Harris County Regional Water
Authority in  Texas  is selling about $107 million of bonds,
refunding debt to cut costs after such securities beat the
municipal market the past two years.  The obligations, slated for sale this week, are rated A+,
the fifth-highest grade by  Standard & Poor’s , which changed its
outlook to positive from stable Jan. 30. S&P said the authority
has a sustainable financial position even as it takes on
capital-intensive projects.  Water and sewer bonds  returned  7.7 percent in 2012 and 11.8
percent in 2011, outperforming the broader $3.7 trillion muni
 market  in consecutive years for the first time since 2008,
according to S&P data.  “Capital market conditions remain favorable and should
spur more borrowing this year,” S&P analysts led by Theodore Chapman in  Dallas  said last week in a report. Refinancings to
lock in long-term  interest rates  and fund projects drove
issuance from U.S. water and sewer agencies up more than 40
percent in 2012 from 2011, according to the New York-based
company.  The North Harris County authority expects to save $24
million through the refunding, according to minutes of a board
meeting Dec. 3. Officials project an average interest rate of
3.05 percent for the new bonds, compared with 5.03 percent on
the 2003 securities to be paid off. The agency will have about
$433.5 million in debt following the sale, which has a final
maturity of 2033, bond documents show.  The authority, formed in 1999, serves a suburban Houston
area covering about 335 square miles (870 square kilometers),
according to its website. The district had a population of about
602,000 in the 2010 Census, S&P said.  The issuer may return to the market next year, Cyndi
Plunkett, financial assistant to the general manager, said from
Houston. Its capital-improvement plan calls for $60.3 million in
projects this fiscal year and $111.3 million in 2014.  To contact the reporter on this story:
