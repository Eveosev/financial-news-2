Scania AB (SCVB)  won an order for 709 buses
for the Winter Olympic games in Sochi next year, more than half
the amount the Swedish truckmaker, controlled by  Volkswagen AG (VOW) ,
delivered in  Europe  last year.  GAZ, a unit of Russian billionaire Oleg Deripaska’s Basic
Element, will produce the buses using Scania chassis at its
plant near Moscow, the companies said today in a statement.  The contract has a value of about 6 billion rubles ($200
million), GAZ said. The buses will be delivered this year and
used for transportation in Sochi during the Olympic games in the
first quarter of 2014 before they’re put into service in the
Moscow region, Scania said.  “Putting such a large number of buses into operation means
that the Scania brand will receive wide exposure in  Russia ,”
Hans Tardell, the managing director for Scania’s Russian unit,
said in the statement.  Scania delivered 1,312 buses last year to European
customers, a 32 percent decline from a year earlier, according
to a company report. The Swedish automaker sold 43 buses in
Russia in the first nine months of 2012, 87 percent more than
the same period a year earlier.  GAZ’s Golitsyno plant near Moscow produced only 20 buses in
the first nine months of 2012, down from more than 200 in each
of the two previous year, according to company reports.  Sales of bus and coaches expanded 1.4 percent in the
European Union in 2012 from a year earlier even as the Italian
and French markets shrank, the Brussels-based European
Automobile Manufacturers’ Association, or ACEA, said on Dec. 29.
Russia’s bus market grew 14 percent to 3,616 in the first nine
months of 2012 compared with a year earlier, according to a
survey by the Association of European Businesses in Russia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
