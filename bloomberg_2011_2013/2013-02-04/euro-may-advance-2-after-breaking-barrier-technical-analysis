The euro may strengthen 2 percent
against the dollar, extending its best start to a year since the
currency’s 1999 creation, after it rose above a level of so-
called resistance, Commerzbank AG said, citing trading patterns.  The single currency may rise to $1.3833, the most since
Nov. 9, 2011, after it “cleared major resistance in the 1.3485
to $1.3525 band,” the bank said in an e-mailed note today. The
$1.3833 level represents the 61.8-percent retracement of the
2011-2012 move, it said.  “The euro has seen a weekly close above the 200-week
moving average and the 55-month moving average, and we will need
to adjust higher our forecast and outlook,” wrote technical
analysts Karen Jones and Axel Rudolph in  London . “This has
introduced scope to $1.3833.”  The euro lost 0.6 percent to $1.3556 at 1 p.m. London time
today. The 200-week moving average was at $1.3532 and the 55-
month gauge at $1.3526, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The bank said the 17-nation currency may fall toward
$1.3459 after the recent rally before it resumes gains.  The single currency is the top performer this year among 10
developed-market currencies tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-
Weighted Indexes, having appreciated 2.7 percent. The
dollar fell 0.3 percent while the yen dropped 7.4 percent.  Resistance is an area on a price graph at which technical
analysts expect sell orders to be clustered.  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to forecast changes in a bond,
commodity, currency or index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
