Gasoline followed crude oil lower as
 Iran  expects to resume talks later this month with world powers
over its nuclear program, easing concerns that Mideast oil
production would be disrupted.  Futures fell as discussions will be held Feb. 25 in
 Kazakhstan , Iran Foreign Minister  Ali Akbar Salehi  said.  The
meeting would be the first talks since the breakdown last June
of negotiations between Iran and the so-called P5+1, which
includes the U.S., China, France, Germany, Russia and the U.K.
The U.S. and Israel say Iran is pursuing atomic weapons.  “The entire market is under pressure with the announcement
that Iran is going to meet with members of the P5+1,” said  Andy Lipow , president of Lipow Oil Associates LLC in Houston. “The
market is viewing it as a step to resolve the disagreement over
 Iran’s nuclear program .”  Gasoline for March delivery declined 3.64 cents, or 1.2
