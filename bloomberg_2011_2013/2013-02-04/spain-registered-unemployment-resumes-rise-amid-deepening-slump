Spain’s  registered unemployment  rose
in January as a fifth year of economic downturn left the country
with a third of the euro-area’s jobless.  The number of people registering for jobless benefits rose
by 132,055 from December to 4.98 million, the Labor Ministry in
 Madrid  said today. Spain’s unemployment rate reached a record 26
percent, the statistics agency reported on Jan. 24.  Companies in the euro area’s fourth-largest economy are
using new labor rules to reduce costs as the deepest austerity
measures in the nation’s democratic history undermine demand.
Building-material producer  Cementos Portland Valderrivas SA (CPL)  is
 firing staff , while retailers such as Carrefour, El Corte Ingles
and Ikea are talking with unions to cut wages and increase
working hours.  Economists forecast unemployment will continue to rise this
year and the International Monetary Fund predicts a 1.5 percent
economic contraction. Exports fell in November from a year ago
and the number of tourists visiting in December declined as the
only drivers left for Spanish economic activity weakened amid a
European slowdown.  To contact the reporter on this story:
