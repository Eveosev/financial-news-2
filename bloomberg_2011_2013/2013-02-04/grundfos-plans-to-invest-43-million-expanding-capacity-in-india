Grundfos Pumps, the largest pump
manufacturer, announced plans to double production capacity in
 India  and invest about 2.3 billion rupees ($43 million) by
setting up an additional unit.  The Chennai expansion may result in 1,000 new jobs in
India, where the unit of  Denmark â€™s Grundfos A/S started
operating in 1998, group president Carsten Bjerg said today in a
statement. Grundfos pumps provide heating and hot water service
systems, cooling, ground and domestic water supply as well as
sewage and wastewater, dosing and disinfection systems.  To contact the reporter on this story:
