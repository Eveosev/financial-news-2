China ’s yuan declined to its lowest
level in a month after the central bank cut the currency’s
reference rate, prompting speculation authorities are protecting
the nation’s exports against a weak yen.  The People’s Bank of China lowered the yuan’s  fixing  by
0.07 percent to 6.2860 per dollar today, the weakest level since
Jan. 7. The currency is allowed to diverge a maximum 1 percent
from the daily fixing.  Japan ’s yen has weakened 7 percent
against the dollar this year, the worst performance among the 11
most-traded Asian currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  “China is trying to preserve its export competitiveness as
the yen has dropped so much, even though Chinese officials won’t
allow a rapid  yuan  depreciation,” said Patrick Cheng, foreign-
exchange analyst at Haitong International Securities Co. in Hong
Kong.  The yuan fell 0.04 percent to 6.2294 per dollar as of 9:52
a.m. in  Shanghai , prices from the China Foreign Exchange Trade
System show. It touched 6.2304 per dollar, the weakest level
since Jan. 7. One-month implied volatility in the Chinese
currency, a measure of expected moves in the exchange rate used
to price options, dropped three basis points, or 0.03 percentage
point, to 1.35 percent, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  China’s  non-manufacturing  Purchasing Managers’ Index rose
to 56.2 in January from 56.1 in December, according to official
data yesterday. A reading above 50 indicates expansion. U.S.
payrolls expanded in January and revisions to previous months’
showed even bigger gains, data showed last week.  In Hong Kong’s offshore market, the yuan dropped 0.05
percent to 6.2158 per dollar, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Twelve-month non-deliverable yuan forwards slid 0.09
percent to 6.3235, and traded at 1.5 percent discount to the
onshore exchange rate, the data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
