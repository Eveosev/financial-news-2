The presidents of the world’s two
largest economies, the U.S. and China, should hold a summit
meeting every year, the  U.S.-China Business Council  said.  A regular discussion would help lower barriers to foreign
direct investment in China, encourage Chinese investment in the
U.S. and ensure equal treatment in obtaining commercial licenses
in China, John Frisbie, the president of the group, said in
Washington today. The council represents about 240 American
companies with business in China, including  Apple Inc. (AAPL) , Ford
Motor Co. and  Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT)   President  Barack Obama  spoke with his Chinese counterpart
Hu Jintao 12 times during the American leader’s first term,
Frisbie told a news conference. Obama is now in the process of
winning Senate approval for the members of his second-term
administration, while in China Xi Jinping was named general
secretary of the Communist Party in November, and is set to
consolidate his power by taking over as president in March.  “An annual presidential summit should be considered,”
Frisbie said. “At this time of transition I think that’s
something that would be worth the two sides exploring”  To contact the reporter on this story:
