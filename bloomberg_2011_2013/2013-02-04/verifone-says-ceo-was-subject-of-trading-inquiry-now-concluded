VeriFone Systems Inc. (PAY)  said Chief
Executive Officer Douglas Bergeron’s trading was the subject of
inquiries by the U.S. Attorney and Securities and Exchange
Commission, which ended their probes without action.  Following a story in the Wall Street Journal, the company
received a subpoena from the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the
Southern District of New York regarding Bergeron’s trading of
VeriFone stock during a specific time frame, according to a
regulatory filing today. VeriFone, the largest maker of credit-
card terminals, also got a request for information from the
staff of the SEC, the company said in the filing.  The San Jose, California-based company said it cooperated
with the inquiries and provided information to support its view
that Bergeron’s actions were in compliance with all laws and
regulations, as well as VeriFone’s own trading policies.  “Based on recent communications, the company understands
that the U.S. Attorney’s Office and the SEC have concluded their
inquiries,” VeriFone wrote in the filing. “No claim, action or
other proceeding was asserted by either authority and the
company believes this matter to be concluded.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
