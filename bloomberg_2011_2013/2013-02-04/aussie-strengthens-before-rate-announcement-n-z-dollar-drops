The Australian dollar rose against a
majority of its counterparts amid speculation the central bank
will hold interest rates unchanged.  The Aussie gained versus 13 of its 16 most-traded peers
before the release of data forecast to show the nation’s trade
deficit narrowed. New Zealand’s dollar, nicknamed the kiwi, fell
from the highest level versus the greenback since September 2011
as political turmoil in  Europe  spurred fears the 17-nation euro
bloc’s sovereign-debt crisis will worsen, damping risk appetite.  “ Australia  has close to the highest interest rates in the
Group of 10, and in a slow-growth in world, capital will go to
Australia,”  Richard Franulovich , senior currency strategist at
Westpac Banking Corp in New York, said in a radio interview on
“Bloomberg Surveillance” with  Tom Keene . “The currency is more
expensive than fundamentals justify.”  Australia’s dollar strengthened 0.3 percent to $1.0438
yesterday in New York trading and fell 0.2 to 96.43 yen.  The New Zealand dollar declined 0.2 percent to 84.32 cents
after touching 84.93 cents, a 17-month high. The kiwi fell 0.6
percent to 77.90 yen.  Standard & Poor’s GSCI Index of 24 raw materials dropped
0.8 percent.  The Reserve Bank of Australia will hold its cash rate
target unchanged at 3 percent today, according to the median
forecast in a Bloomberg News survey.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and JPMorgan Chase and Co. last
week dropped their forecasts for a rate cut at the first meeting
of the year after a 76 percent rebound in the price of iron ore,
the nation’s biggest export. The RBA has lowered the benchmark
rate by 1.75 percentage points since Nov. 1 2011, as it seeks to
spur industries that will help to offset a peak in resource
investment.  China Growth  The Aussie and the kiwi were supported by data over the
weekend showing  China ’s services industries grew at the fastest
pace since August.  The non-manufacturing purchasing managers’ index rose to
56.2 in January from 56.1 in December, the Beijing-based
National Bureau of Statistics and China Federation of Logistics
& Purchasing said in a statement. A reading above 50 indicates
expansion.  China is Australia’s largest trading partner and New
Zealand’s second-largest export destination.  Australia’s imports probably outpaced exports by A$800
million ($834.7 million) in December, compared with an A$2.64
billion shortfall in November, according to economists surveyed
by Bloomberg News.  The Aussie fell 0.5 percent during the past three months
among the 10 developed-nation currencies monitored by the
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The kiwi gained 0.8
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
