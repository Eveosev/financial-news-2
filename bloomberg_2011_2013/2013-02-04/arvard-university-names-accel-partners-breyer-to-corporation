Harvard University said James Breyer,
a  partner  at venture-capital firm Accel Partners, joined the
college’s governing body, known as the Harvard Corporation.  The appointment of Breyer, a 1987 Harvard Business School
graduate, brings the board’s number of members to 13, the
Cambridge, Massachusetts-based institution said today in a
 statement  on its website.  Harvard President Drew Faust began expanding the
university’s board, also known as the President and Fellows of
Harvard College, in 2010, following losses in its endowment
during the financial crisis that began in 2008. Breyer’s record
at Accel includes investment in more than 30 consumer, media 
and technology companies that have completed initial public 
offerings or mergers, including  Facebook Inc. (FB) , according to the
statement.  “Jim Breyer is one of his generation’s most creative and
admired venture capitalists,” Faust and Robert Reischauer, the
Corporation’s senior fellow, said in the statement. “He
combines wide experience in new technology and media with an
expansive international outlook and an extraordinary capacity
for catalyzing innovation and entrepreneurship.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
