Mario Draghi ’s membership in the
Group of Thirty, a policy group with members from both private
and central banks, doesn’t undermine his independence as
governor of the  European Central Bank , the ombudsman for the
European Union said.  Draghi’s membership in the group doesn’t affect
the “independence, reputation and integrity” of the Frankfurt-
based ECB, the ombudsman said in a  report  on his website. The
investigation followed a complaint from Corporate Europe
Observatory, a group that aims to curb the influence enjoyed by
corporations in EU policy making, according to its  website .  The “agendas and diversity of the speakers” at Group of
Thirty meetings mean it “should be characterized as a
discussion forum, rather than an interest group or a lobby
seeking to promote private interests,” the ombudsman, Nikiforos
Diamandouros, said in the report.  The  Group of Thirty  brings together senior executives at
private banks including Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Banco
Santander SA, central bank governors, politicians and academics
to discuss financial policy. Draghi’s predecessor at the ECB,
 Jean-Claude Trichet , is the group’s chairman.  The ombudsman, who investigates complaints about lapses in
administration at EU institutions, also said the ECB should
mention Draghi’s membership in the group on its website “in the
interests of transparency.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
