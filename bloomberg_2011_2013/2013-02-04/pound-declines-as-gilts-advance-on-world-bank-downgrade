Swatch Group AG (UHR) , the biggest maker of
Swiss timepieces, said its sales last year would have been 500
million francs ($550 million) higher if the franc were still at
2010 levels.  Gross sales increased by 14 percent in 2012 from a year
earlier to 8.14 billion francs, the Biel, Switzerland-based
company  reported today . Net income climbed 26 percent to 1.6
billion francs, exceeding the 1.49 billion-francs average of 15
analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  “Foreign currencies stabilized somewhat against the Swiss
franc but remain significantly weaker than two years ago,” the
company said in a statement. “The signals from the markets
around the world clearly indicate continued healthy growth
potential for the Swiss watch industry.”  The franc traded at 1.2358 per euro at 11:08 a.m. in
 London , compared with an average of 1.381 during 2010. The  Swiss
National Bank  put a ceiling on the currency in 2011 to prevent
it from strengthening beyond 1.20 per euro as investors sought a
haven from Europe’s debt crisis.  The franc weakened 0.2 percent last year, according to
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Currency Indexes, which track 10
developed-nation currencies. It jumped 8.1 percent during 2010
and 0.6 percent in 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
