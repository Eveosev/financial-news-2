United Technologies Corp. (UTX)  said it
plans to buy back as much as $5.4 billion in stock as it resumes
share repurchases after a yearlong pause following the
acquisition of Goodrich Corp.  The program, which will repurchase as many as 60 million
shares, will total about $1 billion in 2013, in line with
previous projections, the Hartford, Connecticut-based company
said today in a statement. The company has 916.5 million shares
outstanding, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, so the
buyback would be about 6.5 percent of the total.  Suspending share repurchases in 2012 was part of Chief
Executive Officer  Louis Chenevert ’s plan to marshal  United
Technologies ’ cash and protect the company’s credit ratings as
it digested the $16.5 billion takeover of Goodrich.  United Technologies fell 0.3 percent to $89.54 at the close
in New York. The shares have climbed 9.2 percent this year,
 compared  to a 4.9 percent gain for the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index.  There’s no timetable associated with the program, which
replaces a 60 million-share repurchase authorization from 2010,
Ian Race, a United Technologies spokesman, said by telephone
after the announcement.  Chenevert and Chief Financial Officer Greg Hayes have both
said in meetings with analysts and investors that they hope to
buy back more than $1 billion of shares this year.  “Of course my boss is pushing me to do a lot more, but
it’s January, so we’ll see what happens,” Hayes said during a
conference call following the company’s fourth-quarter earnings
announcement last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
