David Akers  kicked a 27-yard field
goal for the San Francisco 49ers, who trail the Baltimore Ravens
21-6 after the second quarter of the Super Bowl.  Joe Flacco  capped the Ravens’ opening drive with a 13-yard
touchdown pass to Anquan Boldin at the Superdome in New Orleans
before the 49ers pulled within 7-3 on a 36-yard field goal in
the first quarter by Akers.  Ravens quarterback Flacco then found Dennis Pitta with a 1-
yard pass for a touchdown midway through the second quarter
before throwing a 56-yard scoring pass to Jacoby Jones to extend
Baltimore’s lead to 21-3.  The 49ers are seeking to join the Pittsburgh Steelers as
the only team with six Super Bowl wins. San Francisco last won
the National Football League championship after the 1994 season.  The Ravens won in their only prior appearance in the Super
Bowl following the 2000 NFL season. All-Pro linebacker  Ray
Lewis , the only player on Baltimore’s roster remaining from the
last championship team, has said he’s retiring after the game.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
