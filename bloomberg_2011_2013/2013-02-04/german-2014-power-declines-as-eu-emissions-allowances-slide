 Power contracts for 2014 delivery in
 Germany  and  France  climbed for a second day as European Union
emissions allowances gained.  Baseload German 2014 electricity, for supplies delivered
around the clock, rose 1.4 percent while French power gained 1.8
percent and carbon permits increased 5.5 percent. Power can
track emissions, which affect production costs.  German power, a benchmark contract in Europe, climbed as
much as 65 cents to 42.10 euros ($57.07), the highest price
since Jan. 23, according to broker data compiled by Bloomberg.
The contract traded at 42.05 euros as of 4:42 p.m. Berlin time.
French power advanced 80 cents to 45.30 euros, broker data show.  EU carbon permits for December rose as much as 27 cents, or
6.2 percent, to 4.61 euros a ton on the ICE Futures  Europe 
exchange in London. The increase will be “short-lived” and
carbon prices will continue to deteriorate, Per Lekander, a
Paris-based analyst at UBS AG, said today in an e-mailed
research note.  Next-week power in France and Germany gained amid forecasts
of lower-than-average temperatures. Week-ahead power in Germany
rose 15 percent to 46.50 euros while the French contract climbed
16 percent to 56.25 euros, broker data show.  Temperatures in  Frankfurt  are forecast to fall to minus 5
degrees Celsius (23 Fahrenheit) on Feb. 10 versus a 10-year
seasonal average of 0 degrees, according to CustomWeather Inc.
data on Bloomberg. In Paris, minimum temperatures will decline
to minus 3.6 degrees on Feb. 9 compared with a 10-year average
of 4 degrees.  Electricite de France SA  is scheduled to halt its 880-
megawatt Bugey-5 and 1,300-megawatt Cattenom-4 reactors on Feb.
9 for maintenance, French grid operator RTE says on its website.  The German  next-month clean-spark  spread, a measure of the
profit utilities get from selling electricity after accounting
for the cost of gas and emissions permits, fell as much as 9.6
percent to minus 16.26 euros a megawatt-hour, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. March became the front month for power
and coal contracts on Feb. 1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
