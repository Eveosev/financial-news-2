Alno AG (ANO)  rose the most in 11 weeks in
Frankfurt trading after the German supplier of built-in kitchens
reported its first annual operating profit since 2005 in a
preliminary earnings statement today.  Alno, based in Pfullendorf, climbed as much as 9.8 percent,
and traded up 8.1 percent at 1.18 euros as of 9:11 a.m. Volume
exceeded the three-month daily average after just 11 minutes of
trade.  Earnings before interest and tax  came in at 1.1 million
euros ($1.5 million) compared with a 10.7 million-euro loss the
year earlier even as sales slipped 1.5 percent.  Alno, which employs about 1,800 people, gets more than one-
quarter of its sales outside  Germany . The company is sacrificing
sales in a bid to boost the quality of its earnings, a strategy
it intends to “pursue unwaveringly” this year, Max Mueller,
Alno’s chief executive officer, said in today’s statement.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
