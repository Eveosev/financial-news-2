Morgan Stanley (MS) ’s Jeanmarie McFadden,
the global head of corporate affairs, is retiring from the Wall
Street firm.  McFadden’s duties included overseeing media relations,
marketing and community affairs, according to an internal memo
from Chief Executive Officer James Gorman and obtained today by
Bloomberg News. Wesley McDade, deputy head of corporate affairs
at the New York-based bank, will become acting chief.  McFadden, 49, who was a member of the management committee, 
led Morgan Stanley’s corporate communications group since 2006 
and served under former CEO John Mack, with whom she also worked 
at  Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN)  before he returned to Morgan Stanley 
in 2005. She helped lead the firm’s public relations efforts as 
the company almost collapsed during the financial crisis and got 
a taxpayer bailout in 2008, which it repaid the next year.  “As global press coverage of our industry intensified in
recent years, Jeanmarie’s instincts, relationships and news
judgment made her a trusted adviser to senior management,”
Gorman, 54, wrote in the memo.  The Wall Street Journal reported on McFadden’s departure
earlier today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
