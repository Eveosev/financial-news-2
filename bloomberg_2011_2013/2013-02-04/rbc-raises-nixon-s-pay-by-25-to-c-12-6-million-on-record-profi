Royal Bank of Canada  increased Chief
Executive Officer  Gordon Nixon ’s 2012 total compensation by 25
percent from a year earlier as the country’s largest lender beat
its financial targets and posted record annual profit.  Nixon, 56, received C$12.6 million ($12.6 million)
including a salary of C$1.5 million, performance deferred share
units of C$6.6 million,  stock options  worth C$1.65 million, an
incentive award of C$2.85 million and other compensation valued
at C$44,877, Royal Bank said today in a regulatory filing. That
compared with C$10.1 million a year earlier. The amounts exclude
pensions.  Royal Bank earned a record  net income  of C$7.54 billion for
the year ended Oct. 31, up 17 percent from a year earlier. The
Toronto-based bank said it reached its medium-term goals for
earnings-per-share growth, return on equity,  capital ratios  and
dividend payouts.  Royal Bank gave Doug McGregor, the Toronto-based co-head of
the RBC Capital Markets investment bank, about C$10.4 million
for last year, a 27 percent increase, according to the filing.
Mark Standish, McGregor’s New York-based counterpart, also was
awarded C$10.4 million, up 27 percent from 2011.  David McKay, group head of Canadian banking, got a 9.4
percent raise to C$5.14 million and Janice Fukakusa, chief
administrative officer and chief financial officer, received a
17 percent boost to C$4.61 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
