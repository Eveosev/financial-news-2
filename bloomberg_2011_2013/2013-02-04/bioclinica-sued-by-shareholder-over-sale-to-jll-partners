BioClinica Inc. (BIOC) , which provides
clinical trial management services, was sued by an investor who
claims the stock is undervalued in a $123 million buyout offer
from New York private-equity firm JLL Partners Inc.  Because of the company’s future prospects, directors of
Newtown, Pennsylvania-based BioClinica could have negotiated a
higher price than the agreed-upon $7.25 a share, said James
Gerson in the Delaware Chancery Court complaint made public
today in Wilmington.  “Despite the persistent economic downturn throughout the
United States, the company has seen a significant operating
improvement in the last 12 months,” lawyers for Gerson said in
the filing. They ask a judge to halt the transaction under its
present terms and to award damages.  Mark Weinstein, BioClinica’s chief executive officer,
didn’t immediately respond to a request seeking comment on the
lawsuit.  BioClinica, which reported $83.9 million in 2011 sales,
fell 3 cents to $7.23 at 12:34 p.m. in New York.  The case is Gerson v. BioClinica, CA8272, Delaware Chancery
Court (Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
