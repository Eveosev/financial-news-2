The  Super Bowl   power failure , which
appeared to recharge the San Francisco 49ers offense in the
second half, also led to a record surge in mobile traffic for
 AT&T Inc. (T) , the nation’s second-largest wireless carrier.  From 8 p.m. to 9 p.m. New York time, a span covering the
halftime show and the power disruption during the Feb. 3 game,
customers used 78 gigabytes of data inside the New Orleans
Superdome, AT&T said yesterday. That was almost double the peak
volume of last year’s Super Bowl and the most ever for an in-
stadium championship game.  While the burst of data use was aided by the blackout, it’s
consistent with the surge in data traffic AT&T is contending
with as its customers snap up more smartphones. Data traffic has
doubled every year since 2007, the company said a year ago.  According to estimates provided by AT&T’s online data-use
 calculator , 78 gigabytes would equal about 234,000 social-media
posts with photos or more than 10 straight days of streaming,
high-definition video. The stadium held 71,024 fans, according
to the  National Football League .  Total data traffic for the game, as people texted, posted
to Twitter, e-mailed and uploaded photos, was 388 gigabytes,
also a record and 80 percent higher than the 2012 Super Bowl,
said  Mark Siegel , an AT&T spokesman. There were also 73,000
mobile-phone calls during the game, he said.  About half of the Superdome’s lights went out in the power
failure, which occurred just after the resumption of play in the
championship football game’s second half. The Ravens had
extended their lead to 28-6 before the blackout and struggled to
fend off a comeback from the 49ers, preserving a 34-31 victory
in the final seconds.  Torod Neptune, a spokesman for  Verizon Wireless , the
biggest U.S. mobile-phone company, didn’t immediately respond to
e-mail and voice messages seeking the carrier’s traffic figures
for the game.  AT&T rose less than 1 percent to $35.53 at 9:59 a.m. in  New
York . The shares had climbed 4.5 percent this year through
yesterday, compared with a 4.9 percent increase in the Standard
& Poor’s 500 Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
