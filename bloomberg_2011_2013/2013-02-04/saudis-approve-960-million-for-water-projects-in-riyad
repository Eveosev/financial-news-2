Saudi Arabia’s water and electricity
ministry has approved almost $1 billion in spending for new
water, sanitation and irrigation projects in the capital  Riyadh .  Municipal authorities announced $960 million of projects
connecting such towns in the Riyadh area as Daramaa, Mazahmiya
and al-Queaia with a desalinated water transport system and
expanding drinking water supplies in the capital by building a
pumping station in the Sa’ad well field as well as designing
water and sewage plants, according to the website statement.  Saudi Arabia spent $1.1 billion last year on 128 water and
sanitation contracts in Riyadh, according to the statement. The
ministry has posted 89 projects around the kingdom this year on
their official website.  Last month, Minister of Water and Electricity Abdullah Al- Hussayen said the government allocated $6.4 billion for water
and sanitation projects in 2013. Saudi Arabia’s National Water
Company has started work on a $133 million water storage plant
in Jeddah to improve water supplies in that city.  To contact the reporter on this story:
