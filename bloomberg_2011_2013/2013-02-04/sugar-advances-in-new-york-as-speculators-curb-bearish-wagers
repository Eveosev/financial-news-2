Sugar futures climbed for a fourth
day in  New York  after speculators curbed their bearish bets.  Money managers and so-called non-reportables reduced their
net short, or bet on lower prices, to 5,893 futures and options
by Jan. 29 from 18,302 a week earlier, Commodity Futures Trading
Commission data on Feb. 1 show.  Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4)  said last
week it’s raising gasoline prices. That may boost ethanol demand
and encourage millers in  Brazil  to use more cane to make ethanol
rather than sugar.  “The net short has started to be pared back for the first
time in a while,” said Keith Flury, an analyst at Rabobank
International in London, by phone. “Maybe people are
reassessing the situation in terms of ethanol demand in
Brazil.”  Raw sugar for March delivery climbed 0.3 percent to 18.95
cents a pound by 7:50 a.m. in New York on ICE Futures U.S. The
fourth consecutive advance is the longest streak since Oct. 2.
White, or refined, sugar fell 0.1 percent to $502.10 a metric
ton on NYSE Liffe.  Cocoa rose 0.1 percent to $2,208 a ton on ICE and arabica
coffee dropped 0.5 percent to $1.472 a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
