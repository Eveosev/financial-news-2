Japan  Airlines Co., the nation’s
second-largest carrier, jumped the most since re-listing in 2012
after its full-year profit forecast beat analysts’ estimates.  The stock rose 5.1 percent, the most since Sept. 19 when it
relisted, to 4,010 yen at the close of trading in  Tokyo  today.  The carrier also known as JAL raised its full-year  net
income  forecast by 16 percent to 163 billion yen ($1.8 billion)
yesterday as demand for travel to  Europe  and the U.S. outweighs
the impact from the grounding of  Boeing Co. (BA)  787s. Japan Air,
whose seven Dreamliners make up about 3 percent of its fleet,
also said the cancellation of 787 flights would probably cut 1.1
billion yen in revenue in the year ending March 31.  The company’s outlook is “definitely a positive,” said
 Ryota Himeno , an analyst at Barclays Plc in Tokyo. “I’m more
cautious about the next fiscal year and what happens if the 787
problem drags on and the yen gets weaker.”  JAL earlier predicted net income of 140 billion yen for the
year ending March 31. The new forecast beat the 156.7 billion
yen average estimate of 11 analysts compiled by Bloomberg before
the company’s announcement. The carrier also boosted its sales
projection by 1.1 percent to 1.23 trillion yen, matching
analysts’ estimates.  All Nippon Airways Co. (9202) , the world’s biggest operator of
787s, and six other airlines have halted Dreamliner flights
after the U.S.  Federal Aviation Administration  ordered the
grounding following a lithium-ion battery fire and an emergency
landing by an ANA plane on Jan. 16.  1.4 Billion Yen  The yen yesterday weakened beyond 93 per dollar for the
first time since May 2010. The yen has declined more than 6.5
percent against the dollar since the start of this year, the
most among 16 major currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  JAL’s announcement of a dividend of 180 yen a share is also
positive for the stock, said Takashi Hiroki, chief strategist at
Monex Securities in Tokyo.  ANA said last week that cancellations of 787 flights cut
1.4 billion yen from sales in January. The carrier, which has no
buffer of planes to cover its 17 Dreamliners, has pulled 830
Dreamliner flights from Jan. 16 through Feb. 18.  JAL hasn’t started any compensation talks with Boeing on
the 787s, President Yoshiharu Ueki told reporters yesterday.  Aviation regulators in the U.S., Japan and other nations
ordered airlines to park their 787s after an ANA plane made an
emergency landing in Takamatsu, Japan, on Jan. 16. A week
earlier there was a battery fire on a  Japan Air (9201)  787 in Boston.  Route Delay  JAL will delay the retirement of two Boeing 767 planes. The
airline said it’s canceling six 787 flights in the second half
of this month, and delaying the introduction of a new Helsinki
route, after 36 cancellations since the emergency landing
through Feb. 3.  Airlines so far have received 50 of the aircraft, which
entered service 16 months ago and start at a list price of about
$207 million. While deliveries have been halted, 787 production
is continuing, Boeing said last week. The planemaker predicted
shipments of more than 60 Dreamliners this year among a total of
up to 645 commercial planes.  JAL yesterday said it was delaying the start of service to
Helsinki with the 787, which was due to begin Feb. 25. The
carrier started international flights to  Boston  with the 787
last year, and has since included service to  San Diego , as well
as adding the plane to current routes including Tokyo-Singapore.  Earnings Impact  The impact on JAL’s and ANA’s profits may not be that big
even if they can’t fly the 787s for a year, said Yasuhito Tsuchiya, an analyst at Bank of America-Merrill Lynch. In such
an event, operating profit at JAL would be reduced by 4 billion
yen and at ANA by 5 billion yen, according to Tsuchiya.  The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board is working
with Boeing to study the batteries’ history since the 787
entered service late in 2011, according to the investigative
agency.  GS Yuasa Corp. (6674)  and the batteries it supplied are at the
center of the investigation by U.S. and Japanese authorities.
U.S. investigators are asking for data on the performance of the
devices as ANA said last week it had replaced 10 of the battery
and charger systems on its planes.  The NTSB said it found “no anomalies” with the JAL 787
battery in tests that covered electrical, mass measurements and
infrared thermal imaging of each cell, according to a statement
on Feb. 1.  The 787 is Boeing’s most advanced jet and uses new
technology such as carbon-fiber materials to save weight and
improve efficiency. ANA and JAL together have signed up for 111
of the Dreamliners, about 13 percent of the  848 orders  for the
plane, according to Boeing’s website.  To contact the reporters on this story:
