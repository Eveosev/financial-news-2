Samsung Electronics Co. (005930) , the world’s
largest maker of mobile phones, said it was boosting venture-
capital funding by $100 million to help create new businesses
for its unit making memory chips and electronics parts.  The company unveiled the Catalyst Fund for early stage
startups, as well as a strategy and innovation center in  Menlo
Park ,  California , at an event near the site on Sand Hill Road.
The company and affiliates also run the $1 billion Samsung
Ventures America Fund.  “We must reach out to global hot spots and global
talent,” Young Sohn, president and chief strategy officer of
device solutions for Samsung, said at the event. “This is the
epicenter of disruptive forces.”  Like other companies such as  Intel Corp. (INTC) , Google Inc. and
Microsoft Corp., Samsung is trying to use its  cash  to encourage
the development of technology that will benefit its business in
the future. Traditional venture-capital investors aren’t
investing in basic science and technology startups, creating a
gap that Samsung intends to help fill, Sohn said.  Samsung’s venture arm, now headquartered in Seoul, has more
than $1 billion in assets under management and did 20 deals
worth $160 million last year, Sohn said. Investments by the new
funds will be in the areas of Internet-connected devices, mobile
health, computer-human interface, cloud-data centers and mobile
privacy, he said.  Shares of the Suwon, South Korea-based company  fell  0.1
percent to 1,435,000 won in South Korean trading today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
