U.S.  Gulf Coast  gasoline strengthened
after a fire at unit at  Alon USA Energy Inc. (ALJ) ’s Big Spring,
Texas, refinery.  Yesterday’s fire was caused by a leak from the bottom of a
vacuum tower, which was in the process of being closed for
planned work, the company said in an e-mail today. It was
extinguished quickly and early indications were that the damage
was minor, Alon said.  The  Big Spring refinery  has the capacity to process as much
as 70,000 barrels a day, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The
work may draw from Gulf Coast gasoline  supplies , which were 82.1
million barrels as of Jan. 25, according to Energy Information
Administration data.  Conventional, 87-octane gasoline strengthened 1 cent to
trade at a discount of  19.5 cents  versus futures on the  New York 
Mercantile Exchange at noon. Reformulated, 84-octane gasoline,
or RBOB, gained 1 cent to 15.5 cents below futures.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel  on the Gulf Coast weakened 0.67
cent to 0.38 cent above heating oil futures, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The  same fuel  fell 0.37 cent to 6.38
cents above futures in New York Harbor, where 84-octane RBOB
held at parity for a second day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
