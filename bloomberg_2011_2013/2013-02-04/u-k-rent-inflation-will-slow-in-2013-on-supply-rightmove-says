U.K. residential property rent
inflation will slow this year as purchases by landlords boosts
supply,  Rightmove Plc  said, citing a survey.  Seventy-four percent of professional landlords intend to
expand their portfolios in 2013, the London-based property
company said in an e-mailed report today. Investors will be
lured by tenant demand and “attractive” returns, it said.  “Buy-to-let investors, attracted by evidence of sustained
demand and strong yields, will provide much needed supply
relief,” said  Miles Shipside , director and housing market
analyst at Rightmove. “Greater supply of rental property coming
on tap is good news for tenants.”  Eighty-eight percent of landlords said the minimum average
return they are seeking is 5 percent, Rightmove said. The
average U.K. rental yield is 5.73 percent, meaning the “right
balance of rent versus return is being achieved,” according to
the report.  Separately, Lloyds Bank said a measure of companies’
expectations for trading in the next year rose 6 points to an
18-month high of 46 in January. An  index  of optimism about the
economy fell to a four-month low, it said.  A U.K. gauge of new job growth climbed to 138 last month
from 134 in December, recruitment company Reed.co.uk said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
