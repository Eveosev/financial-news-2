Individuals last month allocated the
largest proportion of investments to stocks since July 2011 as
equities rallied after lawmakers reached a budget compromise,
the  American Association  of Individual Investors said.  Respondents devoted 61.4 percent of their investments to
equities in January, compared with an average of 60 percent, the
report showed. While allotments for fixed income declined to 20
percent over the same period, individuals have historically held
even less -- about 16 percent -- of their investments in bonds.
Cash portions also dropped, falling 2.2 percentage points to
18.4 percent, well below their average of 24 percent.  The  Standard & Poor’s 500 (SPX)  Index capped its best January
since 1997, returning 5.2 percent including dividends, as
companies reported better-than-estimated earnings and lawmakers
reached a compromise to avoid most of the so-called fiscal cliff
of more than $600 billion in spending cuts and tax increases.
Bullishness reached a two-year high, a separate survey from the
AAII showed on Jan. 24.  “January was a strong month for the stock market,” AAII
Vice President Charles Rotblut wrote in the report. “Optimism
among individual investors about the short-term direction of
stock prices has improved. Clarity about the tax rates, the
avoidance of the fiscal cliff and continued economic growth also
helped.”  Individuals added $3.1 billion to U.S. stock mutual funds
in the first week of this year, the most since at least 2000,
after withdrawing almost $250 billion in the past four years,
according to data from research firm EPFR Global, scarred by the
2008 financial crisis that wiped out $11 trillion in market
value.  Investors have piled into less volatile securities during
the past six years, adding more than $1.1 trillion to bond
funds, based on data from the Washington-based  Investment
Company Institute . About $150 billion was withdrawn from mutual
funds that invest in American stocks in 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
