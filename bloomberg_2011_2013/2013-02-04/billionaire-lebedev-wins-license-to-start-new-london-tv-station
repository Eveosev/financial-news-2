Russian billionaire Alexander Lebedev
and his son, Evgeny, won the right to operate a new  London  TV
station that will rely on content from the family’s London
Evening Standard and Independent newspapers.  London Live TV  beat four other applicants for the right to
a 12-year license to broadcast to an estimated 4 million homes,
U.K. communications regulator Ofcom said in a statement today.  Lebedev’s free-to-air channel won against bids by former
mayoral candidate Steven Norris and former Channel 4 Chairman
Luke Johnson. London is one of 21 U.K. markets where Ofcom is
adding local TV stations. London Live aims to operate from early
2014 for 18 hours a day, focusing on news, current affairs and
general interest topics in London, said Andrew Mullins, managing
director of the Evening Standard and Independent newspapers.  “People are interested in more local content,” Mullins
said in an interview today. “Our TV guide will be alongside
BBC1 and BBC2, and this gives us great opportunities.”  London Live isn’t expected to be “hugely lucrative”
during its initial years, Mullins said.  “It’s very difficult to secure high yields for advertising
given the dominance of the big players,” he said.  London Live is established under a company called ESTV, in
which Evgeny Lebedev owns 100 percent, Mullins said. A spokesman
for Alexander Lebedev declined to comment on the license.  To contact the reporter on this story:
