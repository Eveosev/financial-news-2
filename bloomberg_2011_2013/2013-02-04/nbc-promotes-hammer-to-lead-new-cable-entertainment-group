NBC Universal  promoted Bonnie Hammer
to oversee an expanded lineup of cable channels and studios,
operations that produce about half of the company’s cash flow.  Hammer will be in charge of the newly formed Cable
Entertainment Group, according to an e-mailed statement today
from the New York-based company. NBC also named former Univision
Chief Executive Officer Joe Uva to the newly created position of
chairman, Hispanic enterprises and content.  With the change, Hammer adds Bravo, Oxygen, Style, Sprout
and TV One to a portfolio of seven networks that already
includes USA Network, SyFy and E!, as well as Universal Cable
Productions.  NBC also named Lauren Zalaznick, currently chairman of NBC
Universal Entertainment & Digital Networks, an executive vice
president of the company, focusing on digital operations. All
three report to Steven Burke, NBC Universal’s CEO.  Comcast, which own a majority of NBC Universal, fell 1.1
percent to $38.19 at the close in  New York . Shares of the
Philadelphia-based company, the largest cable service in the
U.S., rose 58 percent last year compared with a 37 percent gain
in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Media Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
