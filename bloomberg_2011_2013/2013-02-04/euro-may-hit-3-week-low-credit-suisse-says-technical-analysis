The euro may fall to its lowest level
against the dollar in almost three weeks after failing to break
a key level of resistance, according to Credit Suisse Group AG.  The 17-nation currency, which has gained 1.8 percent versus
the greenback during the past two weeks, will target a support
level of $1.3490 after failing to increase past $1.3711, Cilline Bain, a London-based technical analyst at Credit Suisse, wrote
today in a client note. The euro might fall to $1.3257, its
lowest level since Jan. 16, if it breaks through that support,
Bain said.  “The market is fairly overextended with the extent of the
rally over the last couple of weeks,” Bain said in a telephone
interview. “The short-term upper trend line at $1.3490 is
probably a natural area for the market to target on the
corrective dip.”  The 17-nation currency decreased 0.6 percent to $1.3559 at
10:30 a.m. in New York after falling as much as 0.7 percent, the
most since Jan. 18. The euro reached $1.3711 on Feb. 1, its
highest level since November 2011.  A break above the resistance zone from $1.3711 to $1.3727
may result in a move higher to $1.3835, Bain said. That would be
the euro’s highest level since November 2011. Credit Suisse has
a year-end forecast of $1.40, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  The European Central Bank will make its next policy
decision on Feb. 7. The ECB, which has held its refinancing rate
at 0.75 percent since July, will make no change, according to
the median forecast of 58 economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  “I would expect the catalyst for this whole corrective
phase, if we were to see a deeper sell-off, to be the ECB,”
Bain said.  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to forecast changes in a
security, commodity, currency or index. Resistance refers to an
area on a chart where sell orders may be clustered. Support is
an area where there may be buy orders.  To contact the reporter on this story:
