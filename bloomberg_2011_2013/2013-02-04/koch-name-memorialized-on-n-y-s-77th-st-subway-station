New York ’s Metropolitan
Transportation Authority won’t approve U.S. Representative
Carolyn Maloney’s proposal to rename a subway station in honor
of Edward I. Koch, the three-term mayor who died last week.  “The MTA has a policy not to rename stations for
individuals,” said Aaron Donovan, a spokesman for the MTA.  Maloney, a Democrat first elected to Congress in 1992, said
yesterday that the station at 77th Street and Lexington Avenue
would bear the mayor’s name. She will hold a press conference at
1:45 p.m. today at the station, said Jacob Tugendrajach, her
deputy communications director.  “Right now, we’re basically trying to explore the avenues
of how to best honor Ed Koch,” Tugendrajach said in a telephone
interview. “The congresswoman’s excited to try to recognize him
at his favorite corner and wants to figure out the best way to
do that.”  “We heard pretty quickly from the MTA that renaming might
not be the best route, so now we’re broadening that.”  Koch, 88, died Feb. 1 of heart failure at New York-
Presbyterian Columbia Hospital. Serving from 1978 through 1989,
he presided over the Wall Street-fueled economic boom of the
1980s, turning a $1 billion budget deficit into a $500 million
surplus in five years.  Koch’s funeral was today at Temple Emanu-El in  Manhattan . A
shiva will be held tomorrow for family and friends at Gracie
Mansion, the mayor’s residence.  To contact the reporter on this story:
