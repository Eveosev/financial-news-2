Harmony Center, the biggest party in
 Latvia ’s parliament that is in opposition, won’t seek a
referendum on the country’s plan to adopt the euro next year.  “Harmony Center considers delaying the ‘Euro adoption
policy law’ to be an irresponsible action” since an elected
parliament made the decision, Janis Urbanovics, the party’s
parliamentary leader, said in an e-mailed statement today.
Still, the government should allow a referendum given the low
level of public support for the switchover, he said.  Lawmakers on Jan. 31 cleared the path for Latvia to apply
for euro-area membership starting Jan. 1. Two-thirds of the
country opposes the move, according to a December survey by the
polling company TNS, which asked 1,024 Latvians and didn’t give
a margin of error.  Harmony’s 31 deputies sticking to the party line would mean
that a referendum initiative by Iveta Grigule, a lawmaker for
Union of Greens and Farmers, a fellow opposition party, will
probably fall short of the required 34 signatures in the 100-
member legislature.  To contact the reporter on this story:
