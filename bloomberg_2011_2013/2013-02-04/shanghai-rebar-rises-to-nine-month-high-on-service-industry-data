Steel reinforcement-bar futures
climbed to the highest in almost nine months after data showed
 China ’s service industries grew at the fastest pace since
August.  Rebar for delivery in May gained as much as 0.7 percent to
4,197 yuan ($674) a metric ton on the Shanghai Futures Exchange,
the highest level since May 10, 2012. The contract traded at
4,183 yuan at 10:37 a.m. local time.  China’s services industries rose as gains in retailing and
construction aided government efforts to drive a recovery. The
non-manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index climbed to 56.2 in
January from 56.1 in December, the National Bureau of Statistics
and China Federation of Logistics & Purchasing said in a
statement yesterday. A reading above 50 indicates expansion.  “The data has shown that the demand is improving and that
companies’ confidence in the economy will strengthen,” Fang
Guodong, an analyst at Wanda Futures Co., said in a report
today.  Spot  iron ore  at Tianjin port rose for a third day on Feb.
1, advancing 0.5 percent to $153.20 a dry ton, according to The
Steel Index Ltd. The average spot  price  for rebar was little
changed at 3,755  yuan  a ton on Feb. 1, according to data from
Beijing Antaike Information Development Co.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
