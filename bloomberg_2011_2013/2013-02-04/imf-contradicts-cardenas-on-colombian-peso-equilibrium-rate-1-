The  International Monetary Fund  said
the Colombian peso is “broadly in line” with the economy’s
fundamentals, even as the government and the central bank step
up efforts to weaken the currency, according to a report
published today.  Finance Minister  Mauricio Cardenas  told reporters in Bogota
today that the peso rate “doesn’t correspond to reality.” The
currency strengthened 0.6 percent to 1,785.93 per dollar at
11.19 a.m. in Bogota. Cardenas said Jan. 29 that the peso is
stronger than its equilibrium rate of 1,950 per dollar.  Central bank Governor Jose Dario Uribe said Jan. 28 that
the Colombian central bank will boost daily dollar purchases 50
percent to at least $30 million and will buy more than $3
billion between February and May. The currency has gained 8.5
percent since the start of 2012, the fifth-best performer of 25
major emerging market currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  The Andean nation has room for further monetary easing “if
downside risks materialize,” the IMF said in the report. The
economy is vulnerable to a “steep drop in  oil prices ” or a
sharp growth slowdown in its trading partners, the IMF said in
the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
