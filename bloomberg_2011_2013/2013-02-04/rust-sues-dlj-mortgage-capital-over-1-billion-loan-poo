Credit Suisse Group AG’s (CSGN)  DLJ Mortgage
Capital unit faces a lawsuit by a trust seeking repurchase of
defective loans in a pool of more than 5,000 mortgages with an
aggregate principal balance of about $1 billion.  An analysis of more than 1,500 loans in the trust found
that almost 80 percent breached representations and warranties
asserting that the mortgages met minimum quality standards and
“complied with sound underwriting practices and applicable
legal requirements,” according to the complaint.  “Given that thousands of loans were pooled in the trust,
some breaches of” DLJ’s representations and warranties “could
reasonably have been expected,” the trust said in the suit.
“However, the sheer number of defective loans that DLJ conveyed
to the trust far exceeds what was contemplated” by a pooling
and serving agreement and related documents.  The suit was filed by  U.S. Bank National Association ,
acting as trustee, in  New York  State Supreme Court in  Manhattan 
on Feb. 1.  “We will vigorously defend against this latest attempt by
sophisticated parties to improperly shift responsibility for
alleged losses to Credit Suisse,” Drew Benson, a spokesman for
Credit Suisse, said in a phone interview.  The case is Home Equity Asset Trust 2007-1 v. DLJ Mortgage
Capital Inc., 650369/2013, New York State Supreme Court, New
York County (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
