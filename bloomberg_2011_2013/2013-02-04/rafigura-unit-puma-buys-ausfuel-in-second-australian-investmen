Trafigura Beheer BV agreed through
its Puma Energy unit to acquire Australian petrol station owner
Ausfuel from  Archer Capital  and other investors to become the
nation’s largest independent fuel retailer.  Buying Ausfuel, owner of the Gull, Choice and Peak service
stations, gives Puma an additional 110 retail sites in Australia,
the Singapore-based company said today in a statement, without
disclosing the terms. Puma will pay Ausfuel about A$625 million
($652 million), said a person with knowledge of the matter.  The deal follows Puma’s purchase last month of Neumann
Petroleum and its 120 petrol stations in Queensland and New
South Wales states. The unit of Amsterdam-based Trafigura, the
world’s third-largest independent oil trader, is making its
first investments in Australia after studying the market for the
last two years.  The unit, formed in 1997, has expanded to include a retail
network of more than 1,300 petrol stations globally and has
operations in Europe, the  Middle East ,  Africa ,  Latin America  and
Asia, Puma said last month.  Private equity firm Archer Capital bought a majority stake
in Ausfuel in May 2010, Puma said.  RFC Ambrion advised Puma, while Morgan Stanley advised
Archer Capital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
