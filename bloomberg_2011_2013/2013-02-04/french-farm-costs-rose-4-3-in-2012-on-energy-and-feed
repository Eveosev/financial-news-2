French farm-production costs rose
about 4.3 percent last year on higher expenses for energy and
animal feed, with the biggest rise for livestock breeders, the
Agriculture Ministry reported.  An index of agricultural-input costs averaged 134.2 points
in 2012, the ministry wrote in a  report  on its website today,
compared with 128.6 points reported for 2011. The cost of
agricultural inputs jumped 7 percent in December, it said.  The cost of animal feed, which makes up about a quarter of
the index, advanced 6.7 percent last year, the report showed.
Energy and lubricants, making up about 11 percent of farmers’
costs, increased 9.2 percent.  “After a surge in August, the prices haven’t stopped
rising through to December, linked to a strong price push for
animal feed,” the ministry wrote. “In December 2012, the
purchasing price for animal feed continues its increase.”  The index for fertilizer, accounting for 12 percent of
farming costs, climbed 4.2 percent last year and expenses for
seeds and planting material rose 3.5 percent, the report showed.  Farmers of commodity crops saw costs climb 3.4 percent last
year, according to the ministry. Expenses for livestock and
dairy producers that graze their animals rose 4.4 percent, while
costs for those that keep pigs, cattle and poultry indoors
jumped 5.5 percent in 2012, the report showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
