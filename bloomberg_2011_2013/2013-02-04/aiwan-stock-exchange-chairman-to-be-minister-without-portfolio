Schive Chi, Taiwan Stock Exchange
chairman since 2008, will become a government minister without
portfolio as part of an executive branch shake-up that started
on Jan. 31.  Schive, 65, will focus on finance and economic issues, the
Cabinet said in an e-mailed statement today.  The leadership changes follow Vice Premier Jiang Yi-Huah’s
promotion to premier and the planned re-appointment of central
bank Governor Perng Fai-Nan to a fourth five-year term. Taiwan
President Ma Ying-jeou is battling a 14 percent approval rating
as he seeks to strengthen an economy that grew at the slowest
pace in three years in 2012.  Taiwan’s Cabinet can have as many as nine ministers without
portfolio handling areas from labor policy to agriculture to
sports to science and technology development.  Schive was formerly the vice chairman of the Council of
Economic Planning and Development, president of the Taiwan
Academy of Banking and Finance, and chairman of the Department
of Economics at National Taiwan University.  The government is yet to announce Schive’s replacement as
stock-exchange chairman, Michael Lin, senior executive vice
president and the spokesman of the Taiwan Stock Exchange, said
by phone today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
