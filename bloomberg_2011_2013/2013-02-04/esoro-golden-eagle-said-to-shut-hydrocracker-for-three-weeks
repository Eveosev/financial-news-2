Tesoro Corp. (TSO) ’s Golden Eagle refinery
shut a hydrocracker over the weekend because of a leak and is
expected to keep the unit out of service for three weeks, a
person with knowledge of the repairs said.  The hydrocracker was halted Feb. 2 after a hole was found
in a line at the Northern  California   refinery , said the person,
who asked not to be identified because the information isn’t
public. The work may last longer than three weeks because the
plant is waiting for new equipment, the person said.  Tina Barbee, a spokeswoman at Tesoro’s headquarters in San
Antonio, declined to comment on the shutdown. She said earlier
today that the refinery was performing planned work.  Golden Eagle can process 170,000 barrels of feedstock a
day, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The plant refines crude
oils from Alaska, California and foreign sources, according to
Tesoro’s website.  Hydrocrackers convert heavy hydrocarbons into lighter fuels
such as high-octane gasoline and high-grade  fuel oil .  The refinery was already conducting a maintenance
turnaround on the No. 6 boiler. The unit, which was scheduled to
return to service this week, may remain shut until next week for
additional tube repairs, the person said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
