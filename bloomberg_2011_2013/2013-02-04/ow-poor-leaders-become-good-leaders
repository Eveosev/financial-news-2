In our previous blog,  Bad Leaders Can Change Their Spots , we described a group of 71 leaders who were able to elevate their leadership effectiveness from the 23rd percentile to the 56th percentile â€” that is, from being poor leaders to good ones. While many readers were impressed that it could happen, many more were curious (and even doubtful) about how it could happen. Admittedly, not every leader can do this. But all 71 of these individuals (who represented three-quarters of the entire group of poor leaders in this study) did accomplish this seemingly Herculean shift. How?  Using  360-degree feedback data  over a 12- to 18-month period, we were able to track what, exactly, the leaders who'd made the most significant progress were doing. We found that practically all of them (more than 80%) significantly improved their ability to executive nine particular leadership skills.
