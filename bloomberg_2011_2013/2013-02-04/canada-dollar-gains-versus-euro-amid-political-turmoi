The Canadian dollar posted its
biggest gain in three weeks against the euro amid a renewal of
political turmoil in Spain and Italy.  The Canadian currency gained gain as Spanish Prime Minister
 Mariano Rajoy  faced calls to resign after newspaper reports
alleged he accepted illegal cash payments. A poll showed former
Italy’s premier Silvio Berlusconi closed the gap on front-runner
Pier Luigi Bersani even as he appeals a four-year prison
sentence for  tax fraud .  “Euro is off the highs which is contributing to some
selling of euro/U.S., euro/Sterling as well as euro/Canada,”
said  Jack Spitz , managing director of foreign-exchange at
National Bank of Canada, by phone from Toronto. “The market by
and large is somewhat more neutral on the Canadian dollar now,
rather than being overly bullish or bearish.”  The loonie, as the Canadian dollar is known for the image
of the aquatic bird on the C$1, rose 0.6 percent to C$1.351 per
euro at 8:25 a.m. in Toronto, after strengthening to as much as
C$1.3494. Against its U.S. counterpart, the Canadian currency
was little changed at 99.63 cents per  U.S. dollar . One loonie
buys $1.0037.  To contact the reporter on this story:
