Aspen Pharmacare Holdings Ltd. (APN) , South
Africa’s largest generic drugmaker, said it’s in talks on a
possible acquisition of Dutch ingredient manufacturing capacity
and product lines from U.S. medicine producer  Merck & Co. (MRK)   Aspen is in discussions with Merck’s European unit MSD on
the potential purchase of an ingredient-making operation
“situated primarily” in the Netherlands and a related set of
finished products, Aspen said in a statement today, without
giving further details.  The drugmaker, which supplies medicines in more than 150
countries, is acquiring product lines to expand in Australia,
Latin America and sub-Saharan Africa.  GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK) , U.K’s
largest drugmaker, owns 18.6 percent of Aspen.  Aspen  fell  0.8 percent to 162.10 rand after rising earlier
in the day by as much as 2.2 percent. The stock has surged about
60 percent in the last 12 months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
