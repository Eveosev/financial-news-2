Thai billionaire Dhanin Chearavanont
stands to make at least HK$12 billion ($1.5 billion) of profit
from his purchase of a stake in Ping An Insurance (Group) Co.,
 China ’s second-largest insurer, from  HSBC Holdings Plc. (HSBA)   Ping An’s  shares  fell 2.8 percent to close at HK$68.90 in
Hong Kong today, compared with the HK$59 per share Dhanin’s
Charoen Pokphand Group Co. agreed to pay for the 1.2 billion
shares.  “It’s a pretty profitable trade for Charoen Pokphand,”
said Olive Xia, Shanghai-based analyst at Core Pacific-Yamaichi
International Ltd. “For Ping An, the approval removed
uncertainty over the deal.”  Hong Kong shares of Ping An, which is also listed in
 Shanghai , have  gained  about 20 percent from the HK$57.65 closing
price on Dec. 4, the day before the sale was announced. Ping
An’s stock has advanced as improving global and Chinese
macroeconomic outlooks lifted the  Hang Seng China Enterprises
Index (HSCEI) , which tracks China-incorporated companies listed in Hong
Kong, 16 percent since Dec. 4.  HSBC announced on Dec. 5 the planned sale of the 15.6
percent stake in Ping An in two phases for about $9.4 billion.
The first installment of 256.7 million shares was transferred on
Dec. 7, according to a HSBC statement on Feb. 1.  Ping An’s Hong Kong shares lost 2.8 percent today following
the announcement after market closing on Feb. 1 that China
Insurance Regulatory Commission had cleared HSBC to sell the
remaining 976.1 million shares to Charoen Pokphand. It declined
the most since Jan. 8, the day when China’s Caixin magazine
reported on its Website that China Development Bank Corp. halted
HK$44 billion loans to help finance Charoen Pokphand’s purchase.  Charoen Pokphand has paid for the second batch of shares in
cash and the deal is expected to be completed on Feb. 6, HSBC
said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
