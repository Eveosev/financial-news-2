Heineken NV (HEIA) , the worldâ€™s third-
largest brewer, said it started a strategic review of its
Hartwall business in  Finland .  The company will finalize the review by the end of the
year, the Amsterdam-based brewer said in a statement today.
Heineken will examine options for the business within or outside
of Heineken, it said.  The unit, which it acquired in the 2008 purchase of
Scottish & Newcastle, has about 850 employees and makes cider,
wine and spirits in addition to beer and soft drinks, the
company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
