Standard & Poor’s  predicts that
 Spain ,  Portugal  and Ireland will all have current-account
surpluses this year as they reform their economies after the
sovereign debt crisis pushed them to seek bailouts.  The forecast is part of a report on countries’ progress in
rebalancing growth published today. Since 2008, exports have
risen 13.6 percent in Ireland, 4.4 percent in Spain and 4.6
percent in Portugal, according to S&P’s analysis.  “Peripheral European economies are adjusting externally
with speed,” said  Frank Gill , a credit analyst at S&P in
London. “What’s more, with the significant exception of Greece,
exports are leading this adjustment, while unit labor costs are
falling back to more competitive levels.”  Data measuring countries’ rebalancing progress “are
substantially higher in 2012 than in 2011, confirming an
acceleration of external re-balancing amid declining unit labor
costs,” S&P said. “This is not to understate the difficulties
that lie ahead. We consider high unemployment a threat to
cohesion across Europe.”  While Greece’s current-account deficit also shrank, the
improvement was generated by reducing internal demand and
imports, rather than improving exports. Greek imports are down
6.4 percent since 2008, while exports dropped 1.3 percent, S&P
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
