Yields on Colombian peso bonds fell
as speculation that inflation slowed last month boosted demand
for the fixed-rate securities.  The yield on the government’s 11 percent peso-denominated
note due in 2020 fell two basis points, or 0.02 percentage
point, to 4.95 percent at 9:12 a.m. in Bogota, according to the
central bank.  Consumer prices rose 2.24 percent in January, compared with
2.44 percent in the prior month, according to the median
estimate of 22 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. The national
statistics agency is slated to publish the monthly report
tomorrow. Slower inflation boosts returns on fixed-rate bonds.  “The market is expecting inflation to be pretty low,”
Taimyra Batz, an analyst at Ultrabursatiles SA brokerage in
Bogota, said in a phone interview.  The peso declined 0.5 percent to 1,784.30 per U.S. dollar,
its biggest drop since Jan. 22.  To contact the reporter on this story:
