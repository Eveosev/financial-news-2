U.S. nuclear-power generation fell
for a third day as  Great Plains Energy Inc. (GXP)  shut the Wolf Creek
plant in  Kansas .  Nationwide production dropped 1.2 percent to 93,232
megawatts, or 91 percent of capacity, the lowest level since
Jan. 28, according to U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission data
compiled by Bloomberg. Output was 1.4 percent higher than a year
ago, with eight of 104 reactors offline.  Wolf Creek 1, a 1,166-megawatt  unit  about 3.5 miles (5.6
kilometers) northeast of Burlington, Kansas, was shut early
today after operating at full power yesterday. Cassie Bailey, a
company spokeswoman at the plant, and the unit would be closed
for eight weeks for refueling.  Output in the NRC’s West region, which includes Wolf Creek,
fell 6.4 percent to 17,507 megawatts, the lowest level for the
date in records going back to 1996. Six of the eight shut U.S.
reactors are in the region.  The 1,149-megawatt Diablo Canyon 2 reactor, about 12 miles
southwest of San Luis Obispo,  California , remained closed for a
second day after operating at full power Feb. 2. A spokesman for
 PG&E Corp. (PCG) , which operates the unit, wasn’t immediately
available for comment.  Reactor maintenance shutdowns, usually undertaken in the
U.S. spring or fall when energy use is at its lowest, may
increase consumption of natural gas and coal to generate
electricity. The average refueling down time was 46 days in
2012, according to the Nuclear Energy Institute.  To contact the reporter on this story:
