News Corp. (NWSA)  sold its IGN Entertainment
websites to  J2 Global Inc. (JCOM) ’s Ziff Davis for an undisclosed
amount.  The transaction will add to J2 Global’s 2013 earnings,
excluding transition costs, the company said today in a
statement. The price is less than the $100 million News Corp.
sought for the business, people familiar with the deal said last
week.  Rupert Murdoch, chairman and chief executive officer of
News Corp., is leaving some businesses as his New York-based
media company prepares to split into separate publishing and
entertainment entities. IGN was once part of an interactive
division that included MySpace.  IGN operates  Gamespy.com , devoted to video games, and
Askmen.com, which offers advice on sports and grooming.  News Corp. gained 1.5 percent to $28.16 on Feb. 1 in New
York. The Class A stock has  climbed  10 percent this year. J2
Global, which bought Ziff Davis publishing in November, rose 0.2
percent to $31.87 and has gained 4.2 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
