Michelin inspectors awarded 632
French restaurants the Bib Gourmand label for “pleasurable
dining at an affordable price,” including 98 which they
recommended for the first time.  The venues range from small bistros to Italian and Asian
restaurants, Michelin said in a press release sent today by e-
mail. The Bib Gourmand label is awarded to restaurants that
offer a complete three-course meal for 31 euros ($42) or less.  “The inspectors have noted that many chefs who have worked
in the very best restaurants have now decided to open their own
establishments where they serve simple, convivial, authentic
cuisine at affordable prices,” according to the statement.  As examples it named Terroir Parisien in Paris, where
Yannick Alleno offers local produce, and  Malthazar  in Marseille,
opened by former two-star chef Michel Portos.  The “Bonnes Petites Tables  France  2013” guide is on sale
from today for 17.90 euros. The Michelin guide to France for
2013 will be published on March 1.  The new Bib Gourmand restaurants listed by Michelin:  Muse highlights include  Richard Vines  on food,  Warwick
Thompson  on London theater,  Catherine Hickley  on German books
and  John Mariani  on wine.  To contact the writer on the story:
