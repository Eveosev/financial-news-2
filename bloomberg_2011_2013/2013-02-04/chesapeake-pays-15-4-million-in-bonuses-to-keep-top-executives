Chesapeake Energy Corp. (CHK)  awarded
bonuses in the form of 810,000  stock options  to retain outgoing
Chief Executive Officer  Aubrey McClendon ’s leadership team at
the second-largest U.S. natural gas producer.  The retention bonuses for Chief Financial Officer Domenic Dell’Osso, Chief Operating Officer Steve Dixon and Martha Burger, the human resources director, will vest one-third each
in 2016, 2017 and 2018, Oklahoma City-based Chesapeake said in a
filing today.  The options have an exercise price equal to the close of
Chesapeake shares on Jan. 29, when the board approved the
awards, according to the filing. The stock closed at $18.97 that
day.  Dell’Osso received 300,000 options, the company said. Dixon
and Burger received 360,000 and 150,000, respectively. The
options are subject to accelerated vesting in the case of
termination without cause, though not for retirement or
voluntary resignation.  McClendon, 53, last week agreed to resign by April 1 from
the company he co-founded in 1989. McClendon fell from grace
with analysts and investors such as billionaire  Carl Icahn  after
revelations that he used personal stakes in thousands of
company-owned wells as collateral for private loans. No
successor CEO has been named.  Chesapeake shares have increased 6 percent since
McClendon’s resignation was announced on Jan. 29, and closed in
New York today at $20.11. The shares tumbled 25 percent in 2012.  McClendon was displaced as chairman in June and four new
directors were elected.  Exxon Mobil Corp. is the largest U.S. gas producer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
