The forint retreated after the
biggest weekly rally in six months as  Hungary  cut its offer of
six-week Treasury bills at an auction amid lower bids from
investors.  Demand for riskier assets fell today amid signs political
uncertainty in the euro area’s weakest economies was returning.
Hungary raised 40 billion forint ($184.6 million) in debt, 10
billion forint less than planned at today’s sale, according to
results from the Debt Management Agency on Bloomberg. Investors
bid for 56 billion forint in debt, compared with 149 billion
forint at the last sale of that maturity on Jan. 7.  The forint weakened 0.5 percent to 293.74 per euro by 3:33
p.m. in Budapest. The currency of Hungary, the most indebted
nation in the east of the European Union, jumped 1.7 percent
last week, the second-biggest rally among more than 100
currencies tracked by Bloomberg. The average yield at the bill
auction was 5.50 percent, compared with 5.66 percent at the last
sale.  To contact the reporter on this story:
