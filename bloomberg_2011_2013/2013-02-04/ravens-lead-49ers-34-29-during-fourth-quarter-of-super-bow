Justin Tucker kicked a 38-yard field
goal for Baltimore to give the Ravens a 34-29 lead over the  San
Francisco 49ers  with four minutes, 23 seconds to play in the
fourth quarter of the  Super Bowl , which was delayed for about 34
minutes by a partial power outage.  Joe Flacco  capped the Ravens’ opening drive with a 13-yard
touchdown pass to Anquan Boldin at the Superdome in New Orleans
before the 49ers pulled within 7-3 on a 36-yard field goal in
the first quarter by  David Akers .  Ravens quarterback Flacco found Dennis Pitta with a 1-yard
pass for a touchdown midway through the second quarter before
throwing a 56-yard scoring pass to Jacoby Jones to extend
Baltimore’s lead to 21-3. Akers then kicked a 27-yard field goal
as time expired in the first half.  The third quarter began with Jones returning the kickoff
108 yards for a touchdown to give the Ravens a 28-6 advantage.
Shortly afterwards, a partial power outage knocked out some
lights in the stadium, causing a delay in play of about 34
minutes.   The 49ers scored 17 unanswered points in four minutes, 10
seconds after play resumed to close to 28-23.   Quarterback Colin Kaepernick found  Michael Crabtree  with a
31-yard touchdown pass,  Frank Gore  scored on a 6-yard dash into
the end zone and Akers kicked a 34-yard field goal.  Tucker kicked a 19-yard field goal for the Ravens before
Kaepernick ran for a 15-yard touchdown and the 49ers failed with
a two-point conversion attempt that would have tied the game at
31-31 with 10 minutes to play.  The 49ers are seeking to join the Pittsburgh Steelers as
the only team with six Super Bowl wins. San Francisco last won
the National Football League championship after the 1994 season.  The Ravens won in their only prior appearance in the Super
Bowl following the 2000 NFL season. All-Pro linebacker  Ray
Lewis , the only player on Baltimore’s roster remaining from the
last championship team, has said he’s retiring after the game.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
