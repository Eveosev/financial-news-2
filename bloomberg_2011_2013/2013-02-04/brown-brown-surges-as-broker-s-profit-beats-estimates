Brown & Brown Inc. (BRO)  jumped the most
since April after the insurance broker’s fourth-quarter profit
beat analysts’ estimates on stronger-than-expected revenue.  The broker climbed 5.4 percent to $28.97 at 4:15 p.m. in
New York. The  Daytona Beach , Florida-based company has  rallied 
14 percent this year, double the gain in the Standard and Poor’s
Midcap 400 Index.  Earnings per share were 29 cents, beating by two cents the
average  estimate  of 17 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. So-called
organic revenue, which excludes recently purchased businesses
and some fees from insurers, climbed 5.4 percent, the insurer
said in a statement after the close of regular trading on Feb.
1. That exceeded the 2.1 percent growth estimate of Meyer Shields, an analyst with Stifel Nicholas & Co.  “We expect organic growth to steadily improve along with
the middle-market economy and rising commercial insurance rate
increases in 2013,” Shields said in a note today.  Shields has a buy rating on the company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
