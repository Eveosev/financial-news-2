Keith Anderson , a former chief
investment officer for  George Soros , hired Doug Paul, who worked
for 43 years at  Credit Suisse (CSGN)  Group AG, as president of the
hedge fund he started after leaving Soros Fund Management LLC,
according to a person familiar with the matter.  Paul, 69, served as a vice chairman for Credit Suisse for
the past 13 years and has known Anderson, 53, for almost three
decades, said the person, asking not to be identified because
the information is private. Anderson’s fund, New York-based
Anderson Global Macro, is scheduled to start trading this year
and will chase macroeconomic trends by wagering on bonds,
currencies, commodities and stocks, the person said.  Anderson didn’t return a phone call seeking comment.  Anderson worked for Soros’s hedge fund from February 2008
through July 2011, when Soros returned the remaining outside
capital and turned the firm into a family office. Prior to
joining Soros, Anderson spent two decades at money manager
 BlackRock Inc. (BLK) , a New York-based firm he co-founded where he was
global fixed-income chief.  To contact the reporters on this story:
