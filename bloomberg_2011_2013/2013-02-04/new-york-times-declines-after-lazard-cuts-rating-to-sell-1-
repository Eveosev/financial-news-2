New York Times Co. (NYT)  shares fell the
most in almost three months after Lazard Capital Markets cut 
its recommendation for the stock to sell from neutral.  The stock dropped 6.1 percent to $8.33 at the close in New
York, the biggest one-day decline since Nov. 7. Shares of the
company had climbed 10 percent last year.  New York Times Co. is expected to continue its streak of
shrinking annual sales this week when it delivers earnings
results. The company has been trying to combat an industrywide
decline in newspaper advertising by getting online readers to
pay up for digital subscriptions.  The company cut about 30 newsroom jobs last month out of a
total of 1,150 because of declines in ads. The business side of
operations has already been reduced by more than 60 percent in
the past few years.  “These are financially challenging times,” Chairman
Arthur Sulzberger said in December in a memo to employees. “The
advertising climate remains volatile and we don’t see this
changing in the near future.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
