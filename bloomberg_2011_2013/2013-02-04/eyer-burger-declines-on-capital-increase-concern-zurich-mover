Meyer Burger Technology AG (MBTN)  fell to
the lowest price in a month after Chief Executive Officer Peter Pauli was quoted as saying he won’t exclude a capital increase
for the solar-equipment maker over the next 24 months.  Meyer Burger fell as much as 6.5 percent to 7.80 Swiss
francs, the lowest intraday price since Jan. 4. The Thun,
Switzerland-based company’s shares were trading 5.8 percent
lower at 7.85 francs at 10:38 a.m. in Zurich. Meyer Burger had
the sharpest decline among the 215 stocks on the Swiss
Performance Index, which rose 0.2 percent.  The company needs to evaluate all financing options to get
through the next 24 months, CEO Pauli said, according to Swiss
financial news website cash.ch.  “Liquidity may become tight by late 2013 and that  capital
requirements  will obviously depend on the length of the solar
crisis,”  Michael Foeth , an analyst at Bank Vontobel AG in
Zurich said by e-mail. Meyer Burger would prefer other financing
options like open credit lines or mortgages “but the longer the
order trough lasts, the higher the chances for a capital
increase.”  Solar-cell and panel manufacturers -- Meyer Burger’s
clients -- are battling overcapacity after a boom in Chinese
 government spending  flooded the market with cheap equipment.
Pauli cut 250 jobs in November to reduce costs by 30 million
francs ($33 million) amid declining sales.  Meyer Burger spokeswoman Ingrid Carstensen and spokesman
Werner Buchholz could not immediately be reached by phone or e-
mail to confirm Pauli’s comments.  To contact the reporter on this story:
