UBS AG (UBSN) , Switzerlandâ€™s biggest bank,
will probably report a fourth-quarter loss after booking a fine
for trying to rig global interest rates and a charge for
reorganization.  The Zurich-based company may post a net loss of 2.16
billion Swiss francs ($2.37 billion), compared with a profit of
319 million francs a year earlier, according to the average
estimate of 12 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. The estimates
ranged from a loss of 2.31 billion francs to a loss of 2.07
billion francs.  UBS was fined about 1.4 billion francs in December by the
U.S., U.K. and Swiss regulators for trying to rig global
interest rates. The bank said at the time that it expects to
report a fourth-quarter loss of between 2 billion francs and 2.5
billion francs. The company also said in October that it would
be booking reorganization costs of about 500 million francs in
the fourth quarter, after announcing that it would shrink its
debt-trading unit and fire 10,000 employees over three years.  UBS is scheduled to publish earnings tomorrow before the
market opens. The following is a table of fourth-quarter mean
estimates of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg, as well as the
year-earlier and third-quarter results. The last column shows
how many analysts contributed figures. The numbers are in
millions of francs, unless stated otherwise, and losses are in
parentheses.  To contact the reporter on this story:
