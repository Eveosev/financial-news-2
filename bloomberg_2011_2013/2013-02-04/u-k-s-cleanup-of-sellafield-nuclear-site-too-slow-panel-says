The U.K.’s Nuclear Decommissioning
Authority isn’t showing enough urgency in completing the cleanup
of radioactive waste at its Sellafield facility in the north of
 England , a panel of lawmakers said.  “It is unclear how long it will take,”  Margaret Hodge , a
lawmaker from the opposition  Labour Party  who chairs the Public
Accounts Committee, said in an e-mailed statement. “It is
essential that the authority brings a real sense of urgency to
its oversight of Sellafield so that the timetable for reducing
risks does not slip further and costs do not continue to
escalate.”  Hodge’s panel of lawmakers released a report today in which
it said it’s “implausible” that the authority can’t speed up
construction of an underground storage facility at the site for
nuclear waste, which is currently slated to take another 27
years. The total cost of decommissioning Sellafield has now
reached 67.5 billion pounds ($106 billion).  “Successive governments have failed to get to grips with
this critical problem,” Hodge said. “A solution to the problem
of long-term storage of the waste is as far away as ever.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
