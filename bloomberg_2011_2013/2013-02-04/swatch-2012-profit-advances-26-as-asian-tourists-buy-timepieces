Swatch Group AG (UHR) , the biggest maker of
Swiss timepieces, reported a 26 percent increase in 2012 profit
as the company produced more watches and took advantage of
expanded production capacity at its factories.  Net income rose to 1.6 billion Swiss francs ($1.8 billion),
the Biel, Switzerland-based company said today in a statement.
Analysts expected 1.49 billion francs, according to the average
of 15 estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Swatch Group showed “surprise margin strength” in the
second half of the year, helped by “strong capacity
utilization, cost controls and manufacturing improvements,” Jon Cox, an analyst at Kepler Capital Markets, said by e-mail.  Operating profit at the company’s production unit, which
makes components for watches, rose 37 percent, with earnings as
a proportion of sales widening almost 4 percentage points to 20
percent. The unit sells movements, which are the mechanisms that
make watches tick, for Swatch Group’s own brands such as Omega,
as well as to to third parties. The operating margin of the
watch and jewelry unit widened 0.8 percentage point to 23.5
percent after a first-half decline.  Growth Potential  “The signals from the markets around the world clearly
indicate continued healthy growth potential for the Swiss watch
industry,” Swatch said. “There is a realistic prospect of
long-term growth in the Swiss watch industry of 5 percent to 10
percent per year.”  Operating profit rose 23 percent to 1.98 billion francs,
beating the 1.88 billion-franc average estimate. Swatch said
Jan. 10 that gross revenue climbed 14 percent in 2012.  Swatch proposed a 17 percent dividend increase to 6.75
francs per bearer share and 1.35 francs per registered share.  Cie. Financiere Richemont SA (CFR) , the world’s second-biggest
luxury-goods company, said Jan. 21 that sales in the Asia-
Pacific region stalled during the three months through December.  Growth in  China  is a concern for luxury companies as buyers
in the country account for 25 percent of global luxury spending,
according to a September HSBC Global Research report.  Chief Executive Officer Nick Hayek said Jan. 30 he expects
mainland China’s watch market to expand about 10 percent in
2013, helped by demand for mid-range and entry-level pieces.
Hayek has said he sees no reason for the Swiss watch industry
not to have “healthy” growth this year as Swatch Group
acquires the Harry Winston watch and jewelry unit for about $1
billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
