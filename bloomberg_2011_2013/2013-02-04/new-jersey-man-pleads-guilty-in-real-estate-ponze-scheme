A  New Jersey  man pleaded guilty to
charges that he defrauded investors in a real-estate Ponzi
scheme.  David Connolly, 51, of Watchung, pleaded guilty today to
one count of money laundering and one of securities fraud,
according to a statement by U.S. Attorney Paul Fishman.  From 2006 through 2009, Connolly took in more than
$50 million from more than 200 victims of a real-estate
investment fraud that resulted in losses of at least $9 million,
prosecutors said.  He told investors their money would buy properties that
would generate rental income to pay distributions, the
government said. Connolly misrepresented the propertiesâ€™
condition, financial performance and amount of equity,
prosecutors said.  In 2009 the scheme collapsed when Connolly began to default
on mortgage payments.  Sentencing is set for June 4. Connolly faces maximum
penalties of 20 years in prison on the securities fraud count
and 10 years for  money laundering . He may be fined as much as
$5.25 million.  Connolly entered the plea before U.S. District Judge
William Martini in  Newark .  The case is U.S. v. Connolly, 12-343, U.S. District Court,
District of New Jersey (Newark).  To contact the reporter on this story:
