(Correct spelling of Cardenas in second paragraph.)  Colombian Finance Minister  Mauricio
Cardenas  said he wants state-controlled oil company Ecopetrol SA
to raise more than half of its $2 billion 2013 financing needs
locally this year.  The “great majority” of the borrowing will be done
locally, Cardenas told reporters in Bogota.  To contact the reporter on this story:
