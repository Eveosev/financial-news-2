Euro-area  producer-price inflation 
held steady in December as slower energy-cost growth offset
faster inflation for intermediate goods.  Factory-gate prices  in the 17-nation euro region rose 2.1
percent from a year earlier, the European Union’s statistics
office in Luxembourg said today. That’s in line with the median
of 17 economists’ forecasts in a  Bloomberg News survey . From the
prior month, prices fell 0.2 percent.  Energy costs at the producer level rose an annual 3.7
percent in December after a 4.1 percent increase the previous
month, the statistics office said. Prices of intermediate goods
rose 1.6 percent after a 1.4 percent increase in November.  In Germany, Europe’s largest economy, producer-price
inflation accelerated to 1.5 percent from 1.4 percent. In
 France , it slowed to 1.7 percent from 1.9 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
