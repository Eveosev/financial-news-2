Egypt  will award a license to import
liquefied natural gas within two weeks as the nation’s users
prepare to buy in the fuel for the first time.  Egyptian Natural Gas Holding Co., or Egas, will probably
award the license to more than one of the five companies that
offered bids in the tender that closed yesterday, Sherif Soussa,
the state-run company’s chairman, said today in a telephone
interview from Cairo.  The nation’s industrial users will be allowed to import a
maximum of 1 billion cubic feet of natural gas daily starting in
the second half of 2013, Oil Minister Osama Kamal said in
November. Egypt was previously an exporter of the fuel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
