Nordex SE (NDX1) , a German wind-turbine
maker that has a plant in Arkansas, said the U.S. wind market
will grow at less than half of last year’s pace in 2013 even
after the extension of a subsidy for developers.  The U.S. will add 3 gigawatts to 5 gigawatts of wind
capacity this year after last year’s 13 gigawatts, Chief
Executive Officer Juergen Zeschky told reporters today at a wind
energy conference in Vienna. The Hamburg-based manufacturer
plans to restructure its U.S. business “to the right size in
the market,” he said, without elaborating.  “In the U.S. itself, we are set up in a way that if we win
a reasonable number of projects, doesn’t have to be huge, we can
support our organization,” Zeschky said.  Last year developers rushed to add projects on concern that
a production tax credit wouldn’t be extended, according to the
 American Wind Energy Association .  Nordex, which last month said it won a 67-megawatt order in
Uruguay, expects wind markets in Asia and  Europe  to remain
stable in 2013 with “significant” growth in northern Europe
and a decline in southern Europe, the CEO said.  The company sees no opportunity to do business in China,
the biggest wind market last year, without a partner, and will
focus in Asia on growing markets including  Pakistan , the
 Philippines  and Thailand, Zeschky said. Nordex in December said
it would cut 130 positions and stop making rotor blades at its
plant in China.  To contact the reporters on this story:
