Dirk Notheis, who stepped down as
 Morgan Stanley (MS) ’s  Germany  head last year amid a dispute over a
utility acquisition managed by the U.S. investment bank, has
joined an asset manager set up to boost lending to small- and
medium-sized companies.  Notheis and Marc Pahlow, formerly of private equity firm
 Carlyle Group (CG) , will lead Rantum Capital Management GmbH, the
Frankfurt-based company said in a statement today. Rantum will
offer “three digit million” euros of subordinated loans in its
first fund, according to the statement.  Rantum is trying to fill a gap left by banks as some so-
called Mittelstand companies, which form the backbone of
Germany’s economy, encounter borrowing difficulties because of
equity levels that are lower than those of peers in other
countries. The move marks a return to the business stage for
Notheis, who left Morgan Stanley as lawmakers probed the 2011
sale of Electricite de France SA’s stake in EnBW Baden-
Wuerttemberg AG to the German state of Baden-Wuerttemberg.  Rantum will probably lend 2 million euros ($2.7 million) to
20 million euros at a time and will raise funds from investors
including insurance companies, pension funds, foundations and
family offices, according to the statement.  Founders of the fund include Hans-Joachim Koerber, the
former chief executive officer of retailer  Metro AG (MEO) , Joachim Hunold, the founder of  Air Berlin Plc (AB1) , Lothar Steinebach, the
former finance chief of consumer chemicals maker Henkel AG, and
Michael Rogowski, the former CEO of machinery maker Voith GmbH.  To contact the reporter on this story:
