U.S., Japanese and Australian bonds
tumbled as stocks rallied after an American report spurred
optimism the world’s biggest economy will keep adding jobs.  The  gap  between U.S. 5- and 30-year notes widened to 2.35
percentage points, the most in four months and above the decade
average of 1.50 points. Rising long-term rates indicate traders
expect the economy to pick up, as they demand higher yields in
case inflation quickens.  Bill Gross , who runs the world’s
biggest bond fund at Pacific Investment Management Co., said he
is avoiding long-term bonds.  “The global economy continues to recover,” said Hiroki Shimazu, an economist in  Tokyo  at SMBC Nikko Securities Inc., a
unit of  Japan ’s second-largest publicly traded bank. “That is
pushing up yields and equity markets around the world.”  U.S. 10-year  yields  increased two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 2.04 percent as of 6:47 a.m. in  London ,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader data. The price of the 1.625
percent security due in November 2022 dropped 6/32, or $1.88 per
$1,000 face amount, to 96 11/32.  The rate on Japan’s December 2022 note climbed four basis
points to 0.805 percent, the highest since Jan. 15. The extra
yield investors demand to hold 10-year government bonds in the
U.S. instead of Japan widened to 1.28 percentage points, the
most since March.  Similar-maturity  Australian yields  touched 3.61 percent,
the highest since May. The equivalent rate for Singapore bonds
climbed to 1.55 percent, the most since September.  Stocks Advance  The  Dow Jones Industrial Average (INDU)  of U.S. shares exceeded
14,000 last week for the first time since October 2007. The  MSCI
Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  rose as much as 0.9 percent today to the
highest since August 2011.  China ’s  non-manufacturing  Purchasing Managers’ Index
increased to 56.2 in January from 56.1 in December, according to
a report yesterday. A reading above 50 indicates expansion.  U.S. payrolls increased by 157,000 workers in January,
following a revised 196,000 gain the prior month and a 247,000
jump in November, Labor Department figures showed Feb 1. The
unemployment rate unexpectedly climbed to 7.9 percent.  Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis President James Bullard
said in a Feb. 1 interview that he expects growth in the world’s
biggest economy to gain enough momentum to let the central bank
reduce the pace of bond-buying as early as the middle of the
year.  Continued Purchases  Bullard backed the Federal Open Market Committee’s decision
last week to continue purchasing securities at the rate of $85
billion a month, the third round of a policy known as
quantitative easing or QE. Fed officials have pushed the
benchmark interest rate close to zero and expanded central bank
 assets  to more than $3 trillion to spur growth and reduce
unemployment.  The Treasury Department will release today its borrowing
estimates for the current quarter and the three months beginning
April 1. The department has resorted to “extraordinary
measures” to continue funding the government after reaching its
statutory debt limit. The House of Representatives voted Jan. 23
to suspend the $16.4 trillion federal debt ceiling until May 19.  Derivatives traders are signaling there’s little chance of
a bear market in Treasuries for the next three years.  Demand for insurance against a steep rise in 10-year note
yields, the so-called payer skew in options on swaps, has fallen
to about its average since 2009, according to Barclays Plc data.
The gap between volatility on three-year options that allow
investors to pay fixed rates on 10-year  interest-rate swaps  and
those that grant the right to receive fixed rates has narrowed
to about 15 basis points from 25 points on June 1.  Unemployment Concern  “The concern and focus of the Fed is still unemployment,”
William O’Donnell, the head U.S. government bond strategist at
RBS Securities Inc. in  Stamford ,  Connecticut , said in an
interview on Jan. 28. “And in the Fed’s eyes it’s not good
enough yet,” he said.  A Bank of America Merrill Lynch index showed the debt
handed investors a 1 percent loss last month, the worst start to
a year since 2009.  Technical indicators are signaling the increase in yields
may be nearing an end.  The 14-day  relative strength index  for the 10-year Treasury
yield was at 71 today, above the level of 70 that suggests to
some traders the rate has advanced too quickly and may be set to
reverse course. The figure for the 30-year yield was at 71.8.  U.S. inflation will be benign in 2013, Pimco’s Gross said
in a Feb. 1 interview with  Tom Keene  on Bloomberg Radio’s
“ Bloomberg Surveillance .” It may pick up in 2014 to 2016, he
said.  Faster inflation “will create an upper drift in long-term
yields,” Gross said. “How do we play it? We avoid long-term
bonds.”  The Fed’s measure of inflation expectations for the period
from 2018 to 2023, known as the  five-year five-year  forward
break-even rate, climbed to 2.89 percent. It hasn’t been so high
since August 2011. The average over the past decade is 2.75
percent and compares with an annual inflation rate of 1.7
percent as measured by consumer prices.  To contact the reporters on this story:
