Frontier Agriculture Ltd., the U.K.’s
largest grain trader, said its feed-wheat pool obtained a base
price of 180.16 pounds ($283.55) a metric ton for grain shipped
in the fourth quarter.  Top-quality milling wheat obtained as much as 30 pounds a
ton on top of the base price, the Witham St. Hughs, England-
based trader wrote in a  report  on its website today.  Farmers can sell grain collectively through pool systems
such as the one managed by Frontier to increase their marketing
clout. U.K. farm-gate prices for feed wheat were about 135 to
140 pounds in October 2011, when farmers committed grain to the
pool, Andrew Flux, grain-procurement manager at Frontier, said
by phone today.  “The pools take some of the risk out of selling that
exists if you trade everything on an open market,” Rob Hayward
of Cousins Farm Ltd. was cited as saying in the statement.
“I’ve always used the pool but this last year more than ever
and that’s because the market is so volatile.”  London-traded feed wheat futures have climbed 28 percent in
the past 12 months, with March-delivery wheat closing at 214.40
pounds a ton on Feb. 1.  Frontier’s harvest-pool price for wheat sold at harvest
time in August and September was 174.09 pounds a ton. The trader
obtained a feed-barley pool price of 171.41 pounds a ton for
grain shipped in the fourth quarter, it said.  Frontier is a joint venture of Associated British Foods and
Cargill Plc. It employs more than 800 people and has a 25
percent share of the U.K. grain market, according to its
website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
