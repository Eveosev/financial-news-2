Panasonic Corp. (6752) , Japan’s biggest
television-maker after  Sony Corp. (6758) , rose the most in more than 38
years in  Tokyo  trading after posting an unexpected profit
because of a weaker yen, asset sales and job cuts.  The company surged by its daily limit of 100 yen, or 17
percent, the biggest gain since at least September 1974, to 692
yen in Tokyo.  Net income  was 61 billion yen ($658 million) in
the three months ended Dec. 31, the company said Feb. 1.
Analysts expected a 17 billion yen loss, based on the average of
three  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  The TV-maker and  Sharp (6753)  Corp. both reported improved results
in the quarter as the yen’s plunge boosted the value of overseas
sales. Osaka-based Panasonic has also eliminated more than
38,000 jobs since April to cut costs amid a projected second
straight annual loss, slower TV demand and competition from
 Samsung Electronics Co. (005930)   “Panasonic seems to have turned a corner,” said Masamitsu Ohki, a fund manager at Stats Investment Management Co., a
Tokyo-based hedge fund. “That is easing investor concerns about
its survival.”  Japanese exporters led gains in Tokyo trading after the yen
weakened to the lowest level since 2010 versus the dollar and
euro.  Sony, scheduled to report earnings Feb. 7, surged 7.5
percent to 1,457 yen, the highest close since April 12. The
company will announce a new PlayStation 4 game console at a Feb.
20 event, according to Michael Pachter, an analyst with Wedbush
Securities in Los Angeles.  Panasonic Turnaround  Sharp, Japan’s third-biggest television maker, gained 5.5
percent to 347 yen, the highest close since July 11. The company
reported its first operating profit in five quarters on Feb. 1.  Panasonic, which also makes hair dryers, refrigerators and
car-navigation systems, is scheduled to announce a new medium-
term plan by the end of March. Kazuhiro Tsuga, who was promoted
to president in June, has said the company may pull out of
businesses with operating margins of less than 5 percent by
March 2016.  The company reiterated its forecast for a full-year loss of
765 billion yen.  The TV-maker has already announced plans to cut 8,000 jobs
in the six months ending March 31. Its workforce shrank to
321,896 as of Sept. 30, from about 385,000 two years earlier.
Other turnaround measures include ending smartphone sales in
 Europe , closing domestic plants for lithium-ion power cells and
suspending investment for solar-cell facilities in  Malaysia .  Cutting Costs  Panasonic’s results beat the consensus, “thanks to a
bigger-than-expected impact from cost-cutting,” Shunsuke Tsuchiya, a Tokyo-based analyst at Credit Suisse Group AG, wrote
in a report. “There is a limit to what can be achieved by cost-
cutting alone. We look forward to seeing specific measures to
combat the decline in sales.”  Shutting divisions is a “worst-case” scenario, and the
company will try to safeguard jobs whether units are sold,
restructured or closed, Tsuga said last month. He didn’t
elaborate on which operations may close.  In October, the company said it will generate 110 billion
yen in cash from selling  assets  by March 31. It also intends to
boost appliance sales outside  Japan , strengthen its business
making home-energy management systems and to offer more products
for corporate customers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
