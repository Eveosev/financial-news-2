Anadarko Petroleum Corp. (APC) , the second-
biggest U.S. independent oil and natural gas producer by market
value, reported fourth-quarter output that exceeded its own
forecast and profit that surpassed analysts’ estimates.  Net income was $203 million, or 40 cents a share, compared
with a net loss of $358 million, or 72 cents a share, a year
earlier, The Woodlands, Texas-based company said in a statement
today. Excluding one-time items such as writing down the value
of certain assets, per-share profit was 20 cents more than the
71-cent average of 28 analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Fourth-quarter sales volumes rose 8.5 percent from a year
earlier to the equivalent of 741,000 barrels of oil a day. That
surpassed a forecast from Oct. 29, when Anadarko said it
expected daily sales for the quarter to be 711,000 to 730,000
barrels. Output surged in the Wattenberg field of  Colorado ,
Eagle Ford Shale in  Texas  and Marcellus Shale of  Pennsylvania .  “They’ve been surprising to the upside regularly now,”
said  James Sullivan , an analyst at Alembic Global Advisors in
 New York  who has an overweight, or buy, rating on Anadarko
shares and owns none. “It’s a good quarter, it’s kind of an on
pace quarter.”  Anadarko also is exploring in locations including the  Gulf
of Mexico  and off the coast of Africa. The company said it has
drilled a development well at its Lucius project in the Gulf,
finding 910 net feet of so-called oil pay, which Sullivan called
a “pretty good result.”  Crude Price  The company’s proved reserves totaled the equivalent of an
estimated 2.56 billion barrels of oil at the end of 2012,
according to the statement. That’s up from 2.54 billion barrels
at the close of 2011. The company said about 46 percent of its
proved reserves were liquids at the end of 2012, with 54 percent
being natural gas.  Anadarko remains on track to meet a goal of having 3
billion barrels of oil equivalent of proved reserves by the end
of 2014, Chief Executive Officer Al Walker said in the
statement.  The company’s average sales price for crude dropped to
$97.74 a barrel in the quarter from $104.82 a year earlier,
while its average gas price declined to $3.28 per thousand cubic
feet from $3.43 a year earlier.  Anadarko’s revenue dropped 11 percent from a year earlier
to $3.41 billion in the fourth quarter.  Today’s earnings report was issued after the close of
regular trading on U.S. markets. Anadarko rose 0.9 percent to
$81.20 at 4:59 p.m. in New York.  ConocoPhillips (COP)  is the largest U.S. independent oil and gas
producer by market value. Independent  oil companies  don’t own
refineries or a chemical business.  (Anadarko is scheduled to hold an earnings conference call
tomorrow at 10 a.m. New York time. To listen, go to
