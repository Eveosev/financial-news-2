Australia ’s National Retail
Association urged the  Reserve Bank  to hold rather than lower
 interest rates  tomorrow so it has time to assess December
shopping data, acknowledging it was unusual for the group to
advise against a cut.  “The RBA is clearly running out of shots in the locker in
terms of how far it can cut rates,” Trevor Evans, the
association’s chief executive officer, said in a statement from
Brisbane today. “Those few remaining cuts must be made when
they are absolutely needed, including in the case of further
economic emergencies.”  A government report Feb. 6 will probably show retail sales
rebounded in December, gaining 0.3 percent from November,
according to the median estimate of economists surveyed by
Bloomberg. While traders see little chance of a cut tomorrow,
they’re pricing in about a 70 percent chance it will lower
borrowing costs by June 30, swaps data compiled by Bloomberg
showed.  The RBA eased monetary policy six times from November 2011
to December last year. The overnight cash rate target is 3
percent.  Christmas sales results are likely to be “encouraging, but
not spectacular,” Evans said in the statement. “Rates are
already at the ‘emergency’ levels of the global financial
crisis, and the RBA is therefore limited in how much lower it
can move.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
