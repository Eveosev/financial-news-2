Dutch Infrastructure Fund BV, a
Schiphol-based  fund manager , raised more cash than planned for
its DIF Infrastructure III fund, part of which will finance
renewable-energy projects.  The fund obtained 604 million euros ($818 million) from
investors at its third close, exceeding a 600 million-euro goal,
the company said today in a website  statement . DIF will seek
public-private partnerships, or PPPs, and clean-energy
investments offering long-term, steady gains, it said.  “The larger the fund, the more we can do with renewable
energy,” Managing Partner Wim Blaasse said by phone from
Schiphol. The company plans to allocate about a quarter of the
fund to renewables, targeting investments in western  Europe  and
 North America , he said.  The fund reached its second close in December having first
raised finance in May. It has a cap of 750 million euros at
final close, or the last opportunity for new investors to step
in, slated for the end of this quarter.  DIF is the preferred bidder on a number of clean-energy and
PPP deals, Blaasse said, declining to give details.  To contact the reporter on this story:
