Asia’s benchmark  stock  index rose to
the highest level in 18 months as U.S. payrolls expanded and
China services industries grew at the fastest pace since August,
adding to optimism in the global economic recovery.  Rio Tinto Group (RIO) , the world’s second-largest mining company,
advanced 1.2 percent in Sydney, leading gains among companies
with earnings closely tied to economic growth.  Sony Corp. (6758) ,
trying to reverse a two-year decline in PlayStation sales,
surged 7.5 percent in Tokyo amid speculation the firm is
prepping a new version of the home console.  Panasonic Corp. (6752) ,
Japan’s second-largest TV maker, soared 17 percent after
reporting an unexpected third-quarter profit.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  added 0.5 percent to 133.4 as
of 7:24 p.m. in Tokyo, with five stocks advancing for every four
that fell. Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average rose 0.6 percent
after capping a 12-week winning streak on Feb. 1., the longest
run of weekly gain since 1959, according to Nikkei Inc.  “Economic news was universally good,” said Matthew Sherwood, head of investment markets research at Perpetual
Investment, which manages about $25 billion in Sydney.
“Corporate leaders are becoming more confident about the growth
outlook. Investors are starting to feel the same way, even
though questions remain about the strength of corporate earnings
growth.”  Sale Cleared  Hong Kong’s  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  fell 0.2 percent with volume
about 76 percent higher than normal for the time of day as HSBC

was cleared by regulators. Shanghai Composite Index rose 0.4
percent and Singapore’s Straits Times Index rose 0.2 percent.

percent fewer shares changing, the data show.  Standard & Poor’s
500  Index futures were little changed.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 jumped 1 percent on the final
trading day of last week after U.S. payrolls rose 157,000 in
January following a revised 196,000 advance in December and a
247,000 surge in November. The gains indicated the labor market
was making progress even as lawmakers quarreled over the  federal
budget . Futures on the  S&P 500  rose 0.1 percent today.  China’s services industries grew at the fastest pace since
August as gains in retailing and construction aid government
efforts to drive a recovery in the world’s second-biggest
economy. The non-manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index rose
to 56.2 in January from 56.1 in December, the Beijing-based
National Bureau of Statistics and China Federation of Logistics

analyst with Wedbush Securities in  Los Angeles , said he is 100
percent certain that Sony will announce the PlayStation 4 at a
Feb. 20 event, citing his checks with game developers and
retailers. Dan Race, a Sony spokesman, didn’t respond to phone
calls and e-mails seeking comment.  Panasonic rose 17 percent to 692 yen. The TV, electronics
and home appliances maker improved earnings in the third quarter
as the yen’s plunge boosted the value of overseas sales.  Buyout Offer  MISC Bhd gained 17 percent to 5.21 ringgit in  Kuala Lumpur 
as Petroliam Nasional Bhd., Malaysia’s state-owned energy
company, offered to buy out the shipping liner in a deal worth
8.7 billion ringgit ($2.8 billion).  Ping An slid 2.8 percent to HK$68.90 as regulators cleared
HSBC’s sale of its stake in China’s second-biggest insurer and
Europe’s largest bank said it expects to complete the transfer
on Feb. 6. The transaction will generate a $2.6 billion profit
for HSBC, bolstering Chief Executive Officer  Stuart Gulliver ’s
efforts to improve profitability hurt by U.S. probes of alleged
money laundering and compensation claims from U.K. clients.  To contact the reporter on this story:
