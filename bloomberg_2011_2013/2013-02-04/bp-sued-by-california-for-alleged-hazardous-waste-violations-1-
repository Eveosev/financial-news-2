Officials at  BP Plc (BP/)  units allegedly
instructed some gas stations in  California  to position leak
detection sensors so they were unable to detect leaks at the
earliest possible opportunity, state prosecutors alleged in a
lawsuit.  The BP units including Atlantic Richfield Co. were sued by
the California Attorney General’s office and seven county
district attorneys over claims they violated environmental laws
by failing to inspect and maintain underground  storage tanks  at
780 gas stations in the state. The complaint was filed today in
state court in Oakland.  Since 2006, BP West Coast Products, BP Products North
America Inc. and ARCO tampered with or disabled leak detection
devices, failed to test secondary containment systems and didn’t
conduct monthly inspections or maintain operation alarm systems,
Alameda County District Attorney Nancy O’Malley said in an e-
mailed statement.  “The majority of these alleged incidents are procedural
violations concerning documentation,” BP said in an e-mail. “A
small number of alleged violations relate to the monitoring of
tanks. None of the alleged violations posed any harm to human
health or the environment.”  BP addressed the issues as soon as it learned of alleged
violations, the company said.  The lawsuit seeks a court order requiring the company to
comply with state law and unspecified civil penalties.
California filed a similar lawsuit against  ConocoPhillips (COP)  in
January.  The case is California v BP West Coast Products,
RG13665900., California Superior Court, Alameda County
(Oakland).  To contact the reporter on this story:
