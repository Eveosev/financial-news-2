Marfrig Alimentos SA (MRFG3)  rose to a two-
month high after the chief of the Brazilian meatpacker’s biggest
unit told newspaper O Estado de S. Paulo he’s planning a price
increase.  Shares of Marfrig,  Latin America ’s second-biggest
meatpacker,  climbed  1.8 percent to 10.61 reais at 2:36 p.m. in
 Sao Paulo  after earlier rising to 10.69, the highest intraday
level since Dec. 3. The stock was the best performer in the
benchmark Bovespa index, which fell 1.6 percent.  Sergio Rial, chief executive officer of Sao Paulo-based
Marfrig’s Seara unit, plans to reduce the price difference
between Seara-brand products and those of Brasil Foods SA’s
Sadia, the market leader, according to the  report . The
percentage difference should be in the single digits, down from
15 percent currently, he told the newspaper in an interview.  The Seara brand is part of the Seara Foods unit, which
accounted for 69 percent of Marfrig’s revenue in the third
quarter of 2012, according to its  website .  Rial, 52, who has been designated to take over as Marfrig’s
chief at the start of 2014, also plans to reduce the number of
items in Seara’s portfolio and increase outlets to 100,000 from
70,000 currently, the newspaper said.  A Marfrig press official who asked not to be identified
according to company policy confirmed Rial’s comments when
contacted by  Bloomberg News .  The company’s shares have gained 30 percent over the past
year, while the Bovespa fell 9 percent in the period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
