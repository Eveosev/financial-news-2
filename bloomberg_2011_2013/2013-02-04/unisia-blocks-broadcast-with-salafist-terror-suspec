Tunisia said Abu Iyad, leader of
Ansar al-Sharia, is suspected of terrorism and blocked a radio
station interview with him.  About an hour before the interview was scheduled to air, a
judge leading the investigation into the terrorism charges
called “Mosaique FM” and said it couldn’t broadcast the words
of Abu Iyad because he is the subject of a lawsuit, the radio
station said on its website today.  The judge was quoted by the station as saying that “Abu
Iyad is wanted by Tunisian and international judiciaries for
terrorist cases,” including an attack on the U.S. embassy last
September, in which four people were killed.  Even publicizing the interview could “threaten the public
order,” the radio station quoted the judge as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
