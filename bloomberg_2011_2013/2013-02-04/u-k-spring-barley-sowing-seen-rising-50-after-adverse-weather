U.K. farmers are set to increase
planting of spring barley by 40 percent to 50 percent this year
after “abysmal” weather in 2012, according to Frontier
Agriculture Ltd.  “We are likely to see a huge increase in the U.K. spring-
barley crop and supply may outweigh usual demand,” Jonathan Hoyland, a barley trader at Witham St. Hughs, England-based
Frontier, said in an online  report  today.  Farmers should start selling part of their grain now to
lock in prices and avoid the risk of having to sell spring
barley at a discount after harvest or being unable to find local
markets for their crops, according to Frontier.  “Conversely, an unexpected event elsewhere could still
benefit the U.K. market and create demand at any point, as
happened previously with both the French and Danish barley crops
suffering from weather-related issues,” Frontier said. “At the
moment, this remains an unquantifiable factor.”  The grain trader is a joint venture of Associated British
Foods Plc and Cargill Inc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
