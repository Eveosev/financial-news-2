Russia , the world’s third biggest
 wheat exporter  last season, will export about 200,000 metric
tons of grain this month, the Institute for Agricultural Market
Studies said.  Shipments were about 100,000 tons last week through
yesterday, the smallest weekly total this marketing year, said
Oleg Sukhanov, an analyst at the company known as Ikar in
Moscow. Grain exports this season have exceeded 14 million tons,
including 10 million tons of wheat, he said. The  Agriculture
Ministry  is forecasting 14.8 million tons for the whole season
that ends June 30.  Russia is expected to be the fifth-biggest wheat exporter
this season after the U.S.,  Canada , the European Union and
Australia, the U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates. Wheat
for March delivery rose 0.5 percent to $7.6875 a bushel on the
Chicago Board of Trade by 7:42 a.m. local time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
