Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) ’s oil
production in Brazil, South America’s largest economy, dropped
35 percent in December from a year earlier.  Shell’s output dropped to 48,499 barrels per day in
December from 74,753 barrels a day in the same month of 2011,
according to monthly  data published  today by Brazil’s oil
regulator, known as ANP. Shell dropped to third place among
crude producers in Brazil in July, after being overtaken by
 Statoil ASA. (STL)  State-controlled  Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4) , or
Petrobras, is the largest producer.  Petrobras accounts for 94 percent of Brazil’s oil and
operates 18 of the country’s 20 largest oil and gas fields. The
other two are Statoil’s Peregrino and Shell’s Ostra, both of
which are offshore. Ostra produced 28,000 barrels of oil per day
in December, compared with 48,000 barrels per day a year
earlier.  Brazil  is one of the regions where Shell is seeking to
expand its offshore presence, together with the Persian Gulf and
Southeast Asia, Chief Financial Officer Simon P. Henry said in a
Jan. 31 conference call with analysts.  To contact the reporters on this story:
