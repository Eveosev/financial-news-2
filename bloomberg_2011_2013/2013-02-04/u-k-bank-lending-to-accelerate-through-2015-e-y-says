U.K. lending to households and
companies will begin growing again this year and keep increasing
through 2015, the Ernst & Young Item Club outlook showed.  Lending may rise 1.8 percent this year, 3.8 percent in 2014
and 5 percent in 2015 after shrinking an estimated 7 percent in
2012, according to the outlook compiled by the London-based
group published today. Corporate and mortgage lending will drive
the “modest” growth this year, while  consumer lending  will be
little changed and begin growing again in 2014, it said.  “Although 1.8 percent growth in lending may seem modest,
it will be the fastest growth in bank lending since 2010 and
marks the beginning of the end of the painful period of
deleveraging,” Carl Astorri, senior economic adviser to the
Ernst & Young Item Club outlook on financial services, said in
the statement. “As lending continues to pick up in 2014 and
2015, the money should start to trickle through to cash-starved
small and medium-sized enterprises.”  Lending to the non-bank private sector will expand 3.8
percent next year, reaching its 2010 peak of 1.65 trillion
pounds ($2.6 trillion) and increase close to 5 percent in 2015,
according to the statement. Deposits at U.K. lenders fell an
estimated 7.2 percent in 2012, which was driven by “non-
resident foreign currency linked to the repatriation of capital
by banks” in the euro region, it said.  “But this negative influence should be more moderate in
2013 as the situation in the  euro zone  stabilizes, allowing
total deposits for U.K. banks to start rising again,” the Ernst
& Young Item Club said.  Corporate loan write-offs will drop to 1.2 percent of total
loans this year after peaking at an estimated 10.9 billion
pounds last year, helped by a economic recovery in the U.K.
Still, “bank profitability will remain under pressure because
of the impact of low real interest rates on margins, as well as
higher regulatory and compliance costs and generally subdued
capital market activity throughout the euro zone,” it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
