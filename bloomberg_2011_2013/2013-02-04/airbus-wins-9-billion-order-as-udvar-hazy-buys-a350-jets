Airbus SAS won a $9 billion order
from Steven Udvar-Hazy’s  Air Lease Corp. (AL)  that includes 25 A350
wide-body jets, a competitor to  Boeing Co. (BA) ’s grounded 787
Dreamliner.  The purchase consists of 20 A350-900s, the first variant of
Airbus’s new long-range plane due to enter service, and five
larger A350-1000s. Air Lease also agreed to buy 14 single-aisle
A321neos that previously had been under option, Airbus said
today in an e-mail.  Air Lease’s order is a boost for Airbus as Boeing works to
fix electrical faults that spurred regulators to order the
global Dreamliner fleet parked last month. Udvar-Hazy, the
lessor’s chief executive officer and founder, has 12 787s on
order and hadn’t yet ordered any A350s, a model that will make
its commercial debut in 2014 after suffering delays.  Airbus’s A350 has “caught up on orders” with this and
other recent purchases, Zafar Khan, an aerospace analyst at
 Societe Generale , said in an interview on Bloomberg Television.
He advises to buy Airbus’s parent European Aeronautic, Defence &
Space Co. and sell Boeing.  In December, Qatar Airways Ltd. almost doubled its order
for A350-1000s to 37 and added three more A350-900s. Airbus has
orders for 582 jets in that family of aircraft, compared with
about 800 orders Boeing had for the 787 when it entered service.  Air Lease is already a big Airbus customer, with A330 and
A320 family models making up about 40 percent of its fleet,
according to the Los Angeles-based company’s most recent
quarterly filing.  List Prices  Deliveries of Air Lease’s A350s will take place from 2018
through 2022, Airbus said. The A350 order was first disclosed in
company filings and subsequently announced by Toulouse, France-
based Airbus.  The  A350  is Airbus’s biggest twin-engine model, with
seating for about 314 passengers on the A350-900 variant, which
has a list price of $287.7 million. The larger A350-1000 can
hold 350 passengers and has a published price of $332.1 million.
Buyers typically get a discount from list prices.  The A321 is the planemaker’s largest narrow-body plane, and
the version with new engines that Air Lease ordered carries a
list price of $117.4 million and seats about  185 passengers .  Udvar-Hazy earned a reputation as the godfather of the jet-
leasing industry after starting International Lease Finance
Corp. in 1973, which he sold to American International Group
Inc. in 1990. He left ILFC in 2010 and founded  Air Lease .  To contact the reporters on this story:
