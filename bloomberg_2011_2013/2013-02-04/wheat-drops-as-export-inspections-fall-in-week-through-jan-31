Wheat fell for the third straight
session, after a Department of Agriculture report showed
inspections of U.S. grain for overseas delivery in the week
through Jan. 31 plunged 32 percent.  Government officials  inspected  15.2 million bushels of
wheat for export, down from 22.3 million a week earlier, USDA
data show. About 599.8 million bushels have been inspected for
delivery since the start of the marketing year on June 1, down
11 percent from  a year earlier, according to the USDA.  “This morning the export inspection numbers in wheat were
a little less than expected,” Dewey Strickler, the president of
Ag Watch Market Advisers in Franklin,  Kentucky , said by
telephone. A stronger  dollar , which rose for the first time in
five sessions against a basket of six currencies, may be making
U.S. grain less attractive to overseas buyers, he said.  Wheat futures for March delivery dropped 0.5 percent to
$7.615 a bushel at 12:19 p.m. on the Chicago Board of Trade.
Prices declined 2.8 percent in the previous two sessions.  In the U.S., wheat is the fourth-largest crop, valued at
$14.4 billion in 2011, behind corn, soybeans and hay, government
data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
