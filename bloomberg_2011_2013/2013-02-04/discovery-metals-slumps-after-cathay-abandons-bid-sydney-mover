Discovery Metals Ltd. (DML)  fell to the
lowest price in five months in Sydney trading after Chinese
private equity firm Cathay Fortune Corp. said it won’t proceed
with a A$830 million ($865 million) takeover bid.  Discovery Metals, which has a  copper mine  in Botswana,
dropped 7.5 percent to 96.25 Australian cents at 11:52 a.m.
local time, the lowest since Sept. 6. The Brisbane, Australia-
based company is trading 43 percent below Cathay Fortune’s
A$1.70 a share offer.  Cathay Fortune Investment Ltd., the bidding group that
consists of Shanghai-based Chinese billionaire Yu Yong’s Cathay
Fortune and partner China-Africa Development Fund, will allow
its bid to lapse, it said late Feb. 1 in a statement. The
decision comes after a downgrade in reserves and lower-than-
expected ore grades at Discovery Metals’ Zeta deposit in
Botswana. The offer will close closes Feb. 15.  Discovery said last month that the total copper metal
content at the Zeta mine was 13 percent lower than its initial
estimate and the sulphide-material grade 15 percent less than
forecast. It also said that its cash cost for the six months
ended Dec. 31 was $4.28 a pound (0.45 kilograms), compared with
the $1.28 a pound average estimated in its feasibility study,
because of lower ore grades and higher energy costs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
