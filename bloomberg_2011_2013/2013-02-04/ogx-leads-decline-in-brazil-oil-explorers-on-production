OGX Petroleo & Gas Participacoes SA (OGXP3) ,
the  oil company  controlled by billionaire  Eike Batista , fell to
a four-year low after reporting a drop in average production at
its main field.  OGX dropped 3.1 percent to 4.02 reais at the close in  Sao
Paulo , the lowest since Dec. 10, 2008.  Average daily production per well at OGXâ€™s Tubarao Azul
offshore field in the Campos Basin fell to 4,900 barrels a day
of oil and natural gas in January, from 5,100 in December, the
Rio de Janeiro-based company said today in a presentation.  Production from a third well began in early January,
lifting total output at the field to 13,200 barrels a day from
10,100 in December, OGX said.  OGX withdrew long-term production targets last year after
the first two wells at Tubarao Azul pumped less than initial
expectations. The stock fell 68 percent last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
