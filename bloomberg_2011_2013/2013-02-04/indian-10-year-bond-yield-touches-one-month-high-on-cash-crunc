The yield on  India ’s benchmark bonds
due 2022 rose to the highest level in a month on speculation a
shortage of cash in the banking system will limit debt
purchases.  Commercial lenders have  borrowed  an average of $1.04
trillion rupees ($20 billion) a day from the central bank last
week, compared with $966 billion rupees in the preceding period.
The  Reserve Bank  of India’s Jan. 29 guidance of “limited” room
for interest-rate reductions is also causing yields to rise even
after the policy rate was cut by 25 basis points, according to
 IndusInd Bank Ltd. (IIB)   Cash shortages mean “the impact of policy action may not
result in significant transmission to yields,” said J. Moses Harding, executive vice president at IndusInd in Mumbai.
“Relief will be from reduced market borrowing from the
government for the rest of the fiscal year through March 31 and
possible support from the RBI through open-market debt
purchases.”  The yield on the 8.15 percent bonds due June 2022 rose
three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 7.94 percent in
Mumbai, according to the central bank’s trading system. The rate
is the highest since Jan. 3.  The  Reserve Bank of India  may resume buying sovereign notes
if the yield looks like rising past 7.95 percent, according to
IndusInd Bank. The government has completed more than 90 percent
of budgeted borrowings for the year ending March 31. Finance
Minister Palaniappan Chidambaram said on Feb. 1 that the
government is committed to fiscal targets and policies needed to
take the economy back to a higher growth path.  To contact the reporter on this story:
