Copper advanced to a four-month high
and zinc touched a one-year high on signs that the Chinese and
U.S. economies are recovering, boosting the outlook for demand
in the world’s two largest users. Aluminum, nickel, lead and tin
also rose.  Copper for three-month delivery rose as much as 0.7 percent
to $8,346 a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange, the highest
level since Oct. 5, and was at $8,309 at 4:32 p.m. in Tokyo. The
price climbed 3.2 percent last week, the biggest advance since
September. Futures for delivery in May gained 0.5 percent to
close at 59,950  yuan  ($9,623) a ton on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange.  In the U.S., manufacturing grew more than forecast last
month and hiring increased, separate reports showed on Feb. 1.
Manufacturing in  China , the second-biggest economy, expanded in
January for a fourth consecutive month, signaling that global
growth picked up at the start of 2013. Copper is used to make
pipes and wires.  “Rising Chinese and U.S. manufacturing output painted a
positive backdrop for commodity demand,” analysts led by  Mark Pervan  at  Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. (ANZ) , said in a
report today.  U.S. payrolls expanded 157,000 in January after a revised
196,000 advance in December and a 247,000 surge in November,
Labor Department data showed on Feb. 1. The Institute for Supply
Management’s manufacturing  index  climbed to 53.1 in January, the
highest level since April, from 50.2 the prior month, according
to a report from the Tempe, Arizona-based group.  Copper  stockpiles  monitored by the Shanghai exchange
dropped last week to the lowest level in two months. Inventories
fell for a third week, losing 8,029 tons to 197,091 tons, data
from the bourse showed on Feb. 1. Still, reserves monitored by
the LME gained 1.1 percent to 376,000 tons, the highest since
Dec. 16, 2011, bourse data showed on Feb. 1.  Copper for delivery in March was little changed at $3.7795
a pound on the Comex in New York.  On the LME, zinc advanced as much as 0.6 percent to $2,190
a ton, the highest since Jan. 27, 2012, and lead climbed as much
as 1.2 percent to $2,479.25 a ton, the highest since Jan. 3.
Nickel rose as much as 0.6 percent to a four-month high of
$18,737 a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
