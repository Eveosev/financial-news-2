Guinea ’s mining code amendment will
be business friendly and allow bauxite producers to compete
internationally, Mines Minister Mohamed Lamine Fofana said.  The country consulted with companies on amendments to the
2011 law to ensure producers are profitable even though Guinea
is further from China, the biggest market, than rival producer
Indonesia, Fofana said today in an interview in  Cape Town . The
new code will be submitted to parliament by Feb. 15, he said.  “Our vision today is to really create a good business
environment for all the companies so that there is no doubt and
no more uncertainty,” the minister said.  The biggest exporter of bauxite, used to make aluminum, is
also home to iron ore and gold projects run by companies such as
Rio Tinto Group and  Vale SA. (VALE5)  Mining makes up 80 percent of the
West African nation’s foreign currency inflows, Fofana says.  To contact the reporter on this story:
