time in three days as economic reports from the U.S. and  China 
showed signs of recovery in the world’s two largest economies. A

healthy,” said Lewis Wan, Hong Kong-based chief investment
officer at Pride Investments Group Ltd., which oversees about
$250 million. “It sent a very good sentiment to the Hong Kong
market. In China, the recovery is also very healthy. We expect
to see some profit taking in the coming few days just before the
long holiday because the market itself has been rallying.”  Hong Kong market will be shut for three days next week for
the Lunar New Year holidays, while markets in mainland China
will be closed for the whole week.  Winning Streak  The Hang Seng Index last month capped its fifth monthly

efforts to drive a recovery in the world’s second-biggest
economy. The  non-manufacturing   Purchasing Managers ’ Index rose
