Goodman Group (GMG) , Australia’s biggest
industrial property trust, said it plans to begin warehouse and
office developments worth A$451 million ($470 million) across
the country.  Goodman will start 210,000 square meters (2.3 million
square feet) of projects after receiving pre-commitments from
new and existing tenants, the Sydney-based group said in an e-
mailed release, without providing a time frame for the plans.  “These new development projects demonstrate the strength
of our product offering and the quality of our long-term
customer relationships,” Jason Little, general manager for
Australia at Goodman, said in the statement.  Goodman, which has announced partnerships with groups
including WTorre Properties SA in  Brazil  and the Canada Pension
Plan Investment Board to invest in the U.S., is also continuing
to expand in  Australia  by boosting developments. The new
projects will be concentrated in Sydney’s western and
northwestern suburbs, and extend the group’s existing
relationships with Wesfarmers Ltd. and Canon Inc., according to
today’s statement.  Other tenants who have committed to space in the new
developments include Bunnings Ltd. and Fujitsu Ltd., Goodman
said. The group already has A$227 million of developments in
progress, it said.  Goodman  shares  were unchanged at A$4.64 as of 12:05 p.m. in
Sydney. They’ve climbed 7.2 percent this year, compared with a 6
percent gain in the benchmark S&P/ASX 200 Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
