Kazakhstan’s President  Nursultan
Nazarbayev  ordered the sale of state stakes in BTA Bank,
Alliance Bank and Temirbank in 2013.  Kazakh banks have taken “a range of measures to cut
foreign debt and this process must be continued,” Nazarbayev
said, according to a  statement  on his website today. No details
were provided on the sales or how to cut the debt.  Nazarbayev met today in the capital, Astana, with
Presidential Chief of Staff Karim Massimov, Prime Minister Serik
Akhmetov, sovereign wealth fund Samruk-Kazyna Chief Executive
Officer  Umirzak Shukeyev  and Deputy Prime Minister Kairat
Kelimbetov.  Kazakhstan’s government has used Samruk-Kazyna to prop up
banks rocked by a credit squeeze in 2009 using money out of $10
billion tapped from the National Oil Fund. State-run BTA Bank,
Alliance Bank and Temirbank restructured about $20 billion in
debt after defaulting that year. BTA restructured its debt in
December for the second time since 2010.  Samruk-Kazyna has been considering a merger of Temirbank
and Alliance Bank.  To contact the reporter on this story:
