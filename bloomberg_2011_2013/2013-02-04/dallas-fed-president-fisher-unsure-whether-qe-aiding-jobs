Richard Fisher , president of the
Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, said the central bank’s asset
purchase program, known as quantitative easing, may not be
helping the labor market.  “The efficacy is questionable,” Fisher said in an
interview with  Kathleen Hays  on Bloomberg Radio’s “The Hays
Advantage.” “I am not worried about price inflation. I am
worried about the efficacy of our policy as it affects job
creation.”  Fisher, who has been an outspoken critic of additional
monetary easing by the Federal Reserve, is not a voting member
of the Federal Open Market Committee this year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
