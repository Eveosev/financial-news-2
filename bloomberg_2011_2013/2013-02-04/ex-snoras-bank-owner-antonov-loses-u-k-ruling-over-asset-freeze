Former Bankas Snoras AB owner
 Vladimir Antonov , who is fighting extradition to  Lithuania  to
face fraud charges, lost a U.K. court ruling to lift a freeze of
his assets and delay a related civil lawsuit.  Judge Elizabeth Gloster in London today also denied
Antonov’s request to avoid giving a full list of his assets,
which he argued would provide a trail for Lithuanian
investigators to follow.  Antonov, a Russian, and his Lithuanian business partner
Raimondas Baranauskas were detained in London in November 2011
after Lithuanian authorities issued a European arrest warrant on
claims they forged documents and fixed accounts to siphon at
least 1.7 billion litas ($668 million) from the country’s third-
biggest bank by deposits, causing its collapse.  Snoras, based in Vilnius, filed a separate civil lawsuit in
Britain seeking a similar amount in damages, and won a court
order freezing Antonov’s assets. Antonov, accused of using the
money to buy luxury homes, cars and a U.K. soccer team, claims
the cases may be politically motivated due to articles in
newspapers he owned.  To contact the reporter on this story:
