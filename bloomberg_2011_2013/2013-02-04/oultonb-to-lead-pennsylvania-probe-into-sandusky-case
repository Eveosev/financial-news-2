H. Geoffrey Moulton Jr. was named to
lead  Pennsylvania ’s internal probe into the case against Jerry Sandusky, the former Pennsylvania State University assistant
football coach convicted last year of child sex abuse.  Moulton, a former federal prosecutor, “will assist us in
providing a comprehensive and independent examination of the
facts surrounding the handling of the Sandusky investigation,”
said Pennsylvania Attorney General Kathleen Kane in an e-mailed
statement. The findings of the investigation will be made public,
said Kane, 46.  Sandusky, 69, was convicted in June of 45 criminal counts
and sentenced to at least 30 years in prison. The case led to
the firings of Penn State President  Graham Spanier  and  Joe Paterno , who headed the school’s football program for 46 years.  After winning her party’s nomination last year, Kane made
reviewing the attorney general office’s handling of the Sandusky
case a key issue. Kane, a former Lackawanna County prosecutor
and mother of two children, is the first woman and first
Democrat elected to the state’s top law-enforcement office.  To contact the reporter on this story:
