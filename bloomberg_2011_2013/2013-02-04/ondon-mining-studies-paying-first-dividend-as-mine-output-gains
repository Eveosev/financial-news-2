London Mining Plc (LOND) , the second-largest
iron ore producer in Sierra Leone, is considering paying a first
dividend as output at its Marampa mine expands and prices rise.  Growth to a production rate of 5 million metric tons a year
by the fourth quarter will bolster profit and enable payment of
a dividend “at the right time,” Chief Executive Officer Graeme Hossie said today in an interview in  Cape Town ,  South Africa .  Rising output, up 46 percent last quarter, will help it
post net income of $69 million this year after a $68 million
loss, according to estimates from Jefferies Group Inc. analyst
Seth Rosenfeld. “Focus on operational improvements in 2013
rather than further expansion projects should limit execution
risk and improve free  cash flow ,” he said today in a note.
Higher cash flow “may pave the way for shareholder returns.”  London Mining fell 1.9 percent to 165.25 pence by 2:46 p.m.
in the U.K. capital. The company, which has sales agreements for
its ore with  Glencore International Plc (GLEN)  and Vitol Group, has a
market value of 229 million pounds ($360 million).  Talks with a potential Chinese investor to help fund an
expansion of Marampa to 20 million tons a year are continuing.
The mine produced 1.6 million tons last year, the company said
last month. Iron ore prices averaged $125 a ton last quarter, up
from $117 a ton in the previous three months, it said Jan. 24.  London Mining will report full-year results on March 21.  To contact the reporter on this story:
