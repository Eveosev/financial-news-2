Rubber surged to a 10-month high on
speculation that demand for the commodity used in tires may
increase after car sales in the U.S. rose in January.  The contract for delivery in July rallied as much as 4.3
percent to 337.4 yen a kilogram ($3,639 a metric ton) on the
 Tokyo  Commodity Exchange, the highest level for the most-active
contract since March 29, before trading at 331.9 yen at 12:26
p.m. local time. Futures rose 3.8 percent last week, the eighth
advance in nine weeks.  Toyota Motor Corp. and Ford Motor Co. led the four largest
automakers by U.S. sales in reporting January gains that topped
estimates, as buyers return to showrooms to begin a fourth
consecutive year of growth. The yen traded near the weakest
level since May 2010 amid optimism that the  Bank of Japan  will
boost monetary stimulus, boosting the appeal of commodities
priced in the currency.  “Strong auto data from the U.S. created a bullish mood in
the rubber market,” said  Kazuhiko Saito , analyst at broker
Fujitomi Co. in Tokyo. The yen’s drop beyond 92 per dollar also
spurred buying, he said.  Imports by  China , the world’s largest consumer, surged 18
percent last year to 3.37 million tons, the Association of
Natural Rubber Producing Countries said in a monthly bulletin on
Feb. 1. Imports may rise 0.9 percent this year to 3.4 million
tons, it said. Inventories gained 807 tons to 98,814 tons, based
on a survey of nine warehouses in  Shanghai , Shandong, Yunnan,
Hainan and Tianjin, the Shanghai Futures Exchange said Feb. 1.  Rubber for May delivery rose 1 percent to 26,735  yuan 
($4,292) a ton on the Shanghai Futures Exchange. Thai rubber
free-on-board gained 0.3 percent to 96.90 baht ($3.26) a
kilogram on Feb. 1, according to the country’s rubber research
institute.  To contact the reporters on this story:
