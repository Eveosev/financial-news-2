Commerzbank AG (CBK) , Germany’s second-
largest lender, posted its biggest quarterly loss in three years
after taking charges related to the sale of Bank Forum and a tax
asset writedown.  The fourth-quarter loss of 720 million euros ($976 million)
compares with a profit of 320 million euros in the year-earlier
period, the Frankfurt-based bank said today in a statement. Bank
Forum charges totaled 185 million euros, while Commerzbank wrote
down 560 million euros on deferred tax accruals.  “Management already indicated at the investor’s day some
deferred tax issues, but we are surprised by the large amount,”
Christoph Bast, an analyst at  DZ Bank  in  Frankfurt  with a hold
rating on the shares, wrote in a note. “This was due to
Commerzbank’s weaker earnings outlook in the medium term.”  Commerzbank last month announced plans to cut as many as
6,000 jobs over the next four years to achieve an after  tax
return  on equity of more than 10 percent at the core bank. The
lender, which is restructuring its retail unit as it offloads
sovereign debt and exits shipping and real estate funding,
expects the job losses to result in 500 million euros of charges
in the first quarter.  Commerzbank shares declined as much as 2.6 percent and were
1.8 percent lower at 1:18 p.m. in Frankfurt trading.  Realistic Costs  “The cost of the staff restructuring sounds pretty
realistic,” said  Christian Hamann , a Hamburg-based analyst with
 Hamburger Sparkasse , who recommends selling the shares. “If the
bank wanted to reduce headcount more quickly, they might face
twice or three times as much in costs.”  Full-year operating profit increased to 1.2 billion euros
from 507 million euros in 2011, the bank said. Revenue before
loan-loss provisions was unchanged at 9.9 billion euros in 2012,
while those provisions increased to 1.7 billion euros from 1.4
billion euros in 2011.  Commerzbank will publish detailed fourth-quarter financial
results on Feb. 15.  To contact the reporter on this story:
