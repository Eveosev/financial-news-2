Suzlon Energy Ltd. (SUEL) ,  India ’s largest
wind-turbine maker that’s undertaken a 95 billion rupee
($1.8 billion) debt-revamp plan, will cut operating costs by 20
percent by June, Chief Financial Officer Kirti Vagadia said.  Suzlon’s owners, who have invested 620 million rupees of
the 2.5 billion rupees they had to bring in under the program,
plan to invest another 630 million rupees by March, Vagadia said
today in a Bloomberg TV interview. The Pune-based company has
cut its interest rates by 3 percent and plans to use the funds
to expand, he said.  The company’s lenders approved the debt-restructuring plan
on Jan. 24. Suzlon on Oct. 11 failed to pay $209 million, the
biggest convertible note default by an Indian company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
