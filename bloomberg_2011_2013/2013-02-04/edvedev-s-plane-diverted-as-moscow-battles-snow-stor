Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev’s
plane was diverted from Moscow today as severe weather in the
Russian capital prevented him from landing.  Medvedev, who was returning from the Black Sea city of
Sochi, had to land in St. Petersburg and is waiting until the
weather conditions ease, Natalya Timakova, his spokeswoman, said
by phone. The prime minister had to cancel a meeting with his
deputies in Moscow, she said.  February, Russia’s second-coldest month, has been unusually
warm in Moscow with temperatures of about 0 degrees Celsius (32
Fahrenheit) that brought wet snow and disrupted traffic.  To contact the reporter on this story:
