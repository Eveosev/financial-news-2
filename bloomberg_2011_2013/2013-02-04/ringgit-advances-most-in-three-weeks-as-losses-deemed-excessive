Malaysia’s ringgit advanced the most
in three weeks as recent losses were judged excessive, and on
signs the  U.S. economy  is improving. Government bonds rose.  The ringgit fell the most against the dollar in 16 months
last week on speculation Prime Minister Najib Razak will call an
early election that may weaken the coalition’s grip on power.
The greenback’s 14-day relative strength index reached 70 today,
a level that suggests it may decline. The U.S. Institute for
Supply Management’s manufacturing  index  rose to a nine-month
high of 53.1 in January, beating all estimates in a Bloomberg
survey of 86 economists, official data showed Feb. 1.  “The ringgit is seeing a technical rebound because it was
oversold last week on election concerns,” said Saktiandi Supaat,
head of foreign-exchange research at Malayan Banking Bhd. in
Singapore. “ Asian currencies are seeing some improvement as
the U.S. ISM Manufacturing Index is showing signs of
expansion.”  The ringgit strengthened 0.4 percent to 3.1074 per dollar
as of 9:45 a.m. in  Kuala Lumpur , according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. That is the biggest increase since Jan. 10. The
currency dropped 2.3 percent last week, the most since Sept. 23,
2011. One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves
in the  exchange rate  used to price options, slid five basis
points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 7.95 percent.  Malaysia’s central bank held its benchmark  interest rate  
at 3 percent on Jan. 31, a decision predicted by all 22
economists surveyed by  Bloomberg News . The monetary authority
last changed the rate in May 2011.  The yield on the 3.418 percent bonds maturing in August
2022 dropped one basis point to 3.51 percent, according to Bursa
Malaysia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
