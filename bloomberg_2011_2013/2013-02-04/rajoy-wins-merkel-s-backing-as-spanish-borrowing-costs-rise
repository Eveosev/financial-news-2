German  Chancellor Angela Merkel 
expressed confidence in Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy’s
ability to stem the debt crisis as he faces corruption
allegations and rising borrowing costs for his country.  Rajoy and his government are working to reduce unemployment
and overhaul the economy “so Spain can return to its full
strength,” Merkel told reporters in Berlin after talks with her
Spanish peer today. “I’m convinced that the Spanish government
and Mariano Rajoy as prime minister can resolve this task, and
 Germany  will help him with all of our strength.”  Merkel and Rajoy met to prepare for European Union
negotiations on Feb. 7-8 on the EU’s next seven-year budget,
only to face questions at a joint news conference about Rajoy’s
political stamina. Merkel said they have a “relationship based
on trust” and voiced understanding for the plight of Spain’s
jobless, though she didn’t propose specific help.  Rajoy, in office since December 2011, faces opposition
calls to resign after reports in the El Pais newspaper that he
or members of his People’s Party received illegal payments.
Standing next to Merkel, he said the reports were false.  Spanish bonds slumped today, sending the 10-year yield up
23 basis points to 5.42 percent at 4:44 p.m. in Berlin. Italy’s
10-year bond yields also climbed. The euro fell 0.7 percent to
$1.3551.  To contact the reporters on this story:
