West Texas Intermediate rose from its
lowest closing level in a week in New York. Crude inventories
probably increased for a third week, a Bloomberg survey showed.  Futures advanced as much as 0.9 percent after their biggest
loss in two months yesterday. U.S. crude stockpiles probably
increased for a third week, according to a Bloomberg News survey
before Energy Information Administration data tomorrow. WTI’s
discount to the European benchmark, Brent, is at its widest this
year. The euro strengthened as much as 0.4 percent to $1.3569
against the greenback, making dollar-priced commodities cheaper.  “Oil is getting some support from the recovery in the
euro,” said  Christopher Bellew , a senior broker at Jefferies
Bache Ltd. in London, who estimates that gains have been
excessive. “Oil fundamentals point to a significant
retracement.”  Crude for March delivery gained as much as 90 cents to
$97.07 a barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile
Exchange and was at $96.81 at 1:51 p.m. London time. The volume
of all futures traded was 3.8 percent above the 100-day average.
The contract slid $1.60 yesterday to $96.17, the lowest close
since Jan. 25 and the biggest decrease since Dec. 6.  Brent for March settlement advanced 98 cents to $116.58 a
barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. The
volume of all futures traded was 37 percent above the 100-day
average. The European benchmark grade was at a premium of $19.81
to WTI futures, compared with $19.43 yesterday.  U.S. crude stockpiles probably rose  2.5 million barrels 
last week, according to the median estimate of seven analysts in
the Bloomberg survey. The industry-funded American Petroleum
Institute is scheduled to release separate inventory data today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
