Cattle futures rose for the first
time in a week after a government report showed the size of the
U.S. herd fell to 61-year low, signaling tightening beef
supplies. Hog prices dropped.  Beef and dairy farmers held 89.3 million head of cattle as
of Jan. 1, down 1.6 percent from the start of 2012, the  U.S.
Department of Agriculture  said in a report after the close of
regular trading on Feb. 1. That’s the smallest herd since 1952.
The most-severe drought since the 1930s reduced livestock-feed
supplies and destroyed pastures, spurring ranchers to shrink
herds.  “It’s a bullish report from a supply standpoint,”  Dennis Smith , an analyst at Archer Financial Services in  Chicago , said
in a telephone interview. “We’re still shrinking.”  Cattle futures for April delivery climbed 0.6 percent to
$1.3295 a pound 9:28 a.m. on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange,
poised for the first gain since Jan. 28.  Feeder-cattle futures for March settlement dropped less
than 0.1 percent to $1.49175 a pound.  Hog futures for April settlement fell 0.4 percent to 88.425
cents a pound. Earlier, the price touched 88.275 cents, the
lowest for a most-active contract since Jan. 24.  To contact the reporter on this story:
