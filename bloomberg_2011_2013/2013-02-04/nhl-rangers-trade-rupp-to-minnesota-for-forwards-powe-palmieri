The  New York  Rangers traded veteran
forward Mike Rupp to the Minnesota Wild for forwards Darroll Powe and Nick Palmieri.  Rupp, 33, was scoreless with 12 penalty minutes in eight
games this season with the Rangers, who have a 4-4 record since
the lockout-shortened National Hockey League season began on
Jan. 19. This is Rupp’s 10th NHL season.  Powe, 27, has 28 goals and 28 assists in 294 career NHL
games with Minnesota and Philadelphia. Known as a shot-blocker,
Powe ranked second among NHL forwards last season with a career-
high 91 blocks.  Palmieri, 23, has spent this season with the American
Hockey League’s Houston Aeros, scoring 10 goals with 11 assists
in 40 games. In 87 career NHL games, the 6-foot-3, 220-pounder
has 13 goals and 12 assists.  The Rangers face the New Jersey Devils in  Newark , New
Jersey, tomorrow night.  To contact the reporter on this story:
