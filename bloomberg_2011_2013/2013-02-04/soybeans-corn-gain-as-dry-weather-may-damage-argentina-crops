Soybeans reached a seven-week high on
speculation that warm, dry weather will reduce yield potential
in Argentina, boosting demand for U.S. supplies. Corn fell on
slowing export demand and reduced ethanol output.  Light rain provided limited relief to less than 30 percent
of the Argentina growing region in the past three days, and dry,
warm  weather  during the next week will increase crop stress on
about 40 percent of the fields from central Argentina to
Paraguay,  Commodity Weather Group LLC  said in a report today.
Soybeans  inspected  for export jumped 32 percent in the week
ended Jan. 31 to the highest since the week ended Nov. 15.  “The Argentina weather continues to provide support,”
Gregg Hunt, a market analyst at Archer Financial Services Inc.
in Chicago, said in a telephone interview. “Exports continue to
be much stronger than people expected, because the weather
concerns have encouraged buyers to ship supplies rather than
cancel and buy cheaper beans from South America.”  Soybean futures for March delivery gained 1 percent to
close at $14.8875 a bushel at 2 p.m. on the Chicago Board of
Trade, after touching $14.98, the highest since Dec. 17.  This year’s soybean harvest in Argentina may be 52.9
million metric tons, according to the average of estimates of 23
analysts in a Bloomberg survey. That’s less than the 54 million
forecast by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which will
update its estimates on Feb. 8.  Corn prices fell after the government said U.S. grain
inspected for  export  plunged to the lowest since July 2003
during the week ended Jan. 31, Hunt said. U.S. production of
 ethanol , made mostly from corn, fell 2.8 percent to an average
of 770,000 barrels a day in the week ended Jan. 25, the lowest
since the Energy Department began collecting weekly data in June
2010, the government agency said last week.  In Chicago, corn futures for March delivery slid 0.2
percent to $7.3425 a bushel.  Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, valued at $76.5 billion in
2011, followed by soybeans at $35.8 billion, government figures
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
