Japan ’s 10-year government bonds had
their biggest two-day  decline  since August after the yen traded
near its weakest level in 2 1/2 years and stocks advanced,
damping demand for the relative safety of the nation’s debt.  Benchmark yields climbed to the highest level in almost
three weeks as rates on Treasuries increased during Asia trading
after reports showed the U.S. added jobs and  China ’s services
industries expanded. Japan’s Ministry of Finance will auction
2.4 trillion yen ($26 billion) in 10-year bonds tomorrow, up
from 2.3 trillion yen last month.  “It appears that securities firms are selling the 10-year
bonds in preparation for the auction,” said  Takafumi Yamawaki ,
Tokyo-based chief rates strategist at JPMorgan Chase & Co., one
of the 24 primary dealers obliged to bid at Japan’s debt sales.
The weaker yen, stock gains and higher Treasury yields also hurt
sentiment for Japanese notes, he said.  The yield on the 10-year note climbed four basis points to
0.805 percent as of 3:57 p.m. in Tokyo from the end of last
week, according to Japan Bond Trading Co., the nation’s largest
interdealer debt broker. The price of the 0.8 percent security
maturing in December 2022 declined 0.367 yen to 99.954. The
yield, the highest since Jan. 15, had a two-day gain of 6 1/2
basis points, the biggest increase since Aug. 16.  Ten-year bond futures for March delivery fell 0.38 to
143.68 at the  Tokyo  Stock Exchange. The Nikkei 225 Stock Average
gained 0.6 percent, advancing for a fifth day.  The yen traded at 92.62 per dollar after touching 92.97 on
Feb. 1, the weakest since May 2010.  Retirement Fund  Japan’s public pension fund, the world’s biggest manager of
retirement savings, may change its asset balance as a new
government’s policies could erode the value of local bonds.  Managers of the Government Pension Investment Fund, which
oversees about 108 trillion yen in assets, will begin talks in
April about reducing its 67 percent target allocation to
domestic bonds, President Takahiro Mitani said in a Feb. 1
interview in Tokyo.  Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and the  Bank of Japan  have
pledged to restore economic growth and spur inflation, which
will mean higher  interest rates , Mitani said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
