Dennis Pitta scored a touchdown to
give the Baltimore Ravens a 14-3 lead over the San Francisco
49ers during the second quarter of the Super Bowl.  Joe Flacco  capped the Ravens’ opening drive with a 13-yard
touchdown pass to Anquan Boldin at the Superdome in New Orleans
before the 49ers pulled within 7-3 on a 36-yard field goal by
David Akers.  The 49ers are seeking to join the Pittsburgh Steelers as
the only team with six Super Bowl wins. San Francisco last won
the championship after the 1994 season.   The Ravens won in their only prior appearance in the Super
Bowl following the 2000 NFL season. All-Pro linebacker Ray
Lewis, the only player on Baltimore’s roster remaining from the
last championship team, has said he’s retiring after the game.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
