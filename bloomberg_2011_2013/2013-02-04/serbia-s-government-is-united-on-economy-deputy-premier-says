Revelations that  Serbia ’s Prime
Minister Ivica Dacic had meetings in 2008 with a businessman
later implicated in cocaine smuggling won’t lead to early
elections, said Aleksandar Vucic, the Serbian Progressive Party
leader and deputy premier.  “What is of paramount importance for us, however, is that
we continue work on pulling Serbia from the economic crisis, on
attracting investments” and improving ties with the European
Union, he said. “I don’t promise that there won’t be any
elections” before they are due in 2016, he said.  The coalition Serbian government, formed in June, is
seeking to pull the economy out of its second recession in three
years as well as reducing the budget deficit, stabilizing the
dinar and starting entry talks with the EU leaders.  To contact the reporter on this story:
