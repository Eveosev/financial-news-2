The Baltimore Ravens beat the San
Francisco 49ers to win the Super Bowl for a second time.  The Ravens won 34-31 at the Superdome in New Orleans in the
first Super Bowl to be played between teams coached by brothers.
John Harbaugh, 50, coaches Baltimore and Jim, 49, leads the
49ers.  The Ravens also won in their only prior trip to the Super
Bowl, after the 2000 season.  The 49ers were seeking to join the Pittsburgh Steelers as
the only National Football League team with six Super Bowl wins.  Joe Flacco  capped the Ravens’ opening drive with a 13-yard
touchdown pass to Anquan Boldin before the 49ers pulled within
7-3 on a 36-yard field goal in the first quarter by David Akers.  Ravens quarterback Flacco found Dennis Pitta with a 1-yard
pass for a touchdown midway through the second quarter before
throwing a 56-yard scoring pass to Jacoby Jones to extend
Baltimore’s lead to 21-3. Akers then kicked a 27-yard field goal
as time expired in the first half.  The third quarter began with Jones returning the kickoff
108 yards for a touchdown to give the Ravens a 28-6 advantage.
Shortly afterwards, a partial power outage knocked out some
lights in the stadium, causing a delay in play of about 34
minutes.   The 49ers scored 17 unanswered points in four minutes, 10
seconds after play resumed to close to 28-23.   Quarterback Colin Kaepernick found Michael Crabtree with a
31-yard touchdown pass, Frank Gore scored on a 6-yard dash into
the end zone and Akers kicked a 34-yard field goal.  Justin Tucker kicked a 19-yard field goal for the Ravens
before Kaepernick ran for a 15-yard touchdown and the 49ers
failed with a two-point conversion attempt that would have tied
the game at 31-31 with 10 minutes to play.  Tucker then kicked a 38-yard field goal to make it 34-29 to
the Ravens with 4:23 to play in the fourth quarter and Baltimore
took a safety with four seconds remaining to complete the
scoring.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
