Gold futures climbed to a record in
 Tokyo  as a weaker Japanese currency boosted the appeal of yen-
based contracts and platinum jumped to the highest level in more
than two years on gains in vehicle sales in the U.S.  Bullion for delivery in December rose as much as 1.2
percent to 5,000 yen per gram ($1,678 an ounce) on the Tokyo
Commodity Exchange before trading at 4,995 yen by 2:21 p.m.
local time. Platinum for the same month increased 2.7 percent to
5,130 yen per gram, the highest level for the most-active
contract since May 17, 2010.  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203)  and Ford Motor Co. led the four largest
automakers by U.S. sales in reporting January gains that topped
estimates, as buyers return to showrooms to begin a fourth
consecutive year of growth. Industrywide light-vehicle sales in
the U.S. increased 14 percent, according to researcher Autodata
Corp. The yen touched 92.97 per dollar on Feb. 1, the weakest
since May 2010. The currency fell 2.1 percent last week, losing
for the 12th straight week.  “The yen’s weakness helped boost the yen-based futures
contracts,” said  Kazuhiko Saito , an analyst at broker Fujitomi
Co. in Tokyo. The prospects of higher demand for precious metals
from  China  before the weeklong Lunar New holiday starting Feb.
11 also boosted prices, he said.  Platinum is used in jewelry and in auto catalysts that
reduce harmful emissions.  To contact the reporter for this story:
