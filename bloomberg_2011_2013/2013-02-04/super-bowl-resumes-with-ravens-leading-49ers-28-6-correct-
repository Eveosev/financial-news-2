(Corrects score in headline.)  The Super Bowl resumed after a power
surge knocked out lighting in about half the Superdome in New
Orleans, causing a delay of about 34 minutes during the third
quarter of the National Football League title game.  The outage happened after Jacoby Jones returned the second
half kickoff 109 yards for a touchdown to give the Baltimore
Ravens a 28-6 lead over the San Francisco 49ers.  Joe Flacco  capped the Ravens’ opening drive with a 13-yard
touchdown pass to Anquan Boldin before the 49ers pulled within
7-3 on a 36-yard field goal in the first quarter by David Akers.  Ravens quarterback Flacco found Dennis Pitta with a 1-yard
pass for a touchdown midway through the second quarter before
throwing a 56-yard scoring pass to Jones to extend Baltimore’s
lead to 21-3. Akers then kicked a 27-yard field goal as time
expired in the first half.  The 49ers are seeking to join the Pittsburgh Steelers as
the only team with six Super Bowl wins. San Francisco last won
the National Football League championship after the 1994 season.  The Ravens won in their only prior appearance in the Super  Bowl following the 2000 NFL season. All-Pro linebacker Ray
Lewis, the only player on Baltimore’s roster remaining from the
last championship team, has said he’s retiring after the game.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
