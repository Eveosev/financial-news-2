Russia said two of its citizens and
an Italian who were kidnapped in  Syria  in December were freed in
a swap for rebels detained by Syrian forces.  The Russian hostages are in good health and have been taken
to the Russian embassy in Damascus, the Foreign Ministry said
today on its website. The Italian will be handed over to
authorities from his country, the Moscow-based ministry said.  The two Russian men and their Italian colleague, who all
work at a Syrian steel plant, were seized Dec. 12, the ministry
said at the time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
