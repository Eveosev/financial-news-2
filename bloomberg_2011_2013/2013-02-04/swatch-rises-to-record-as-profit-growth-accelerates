Swatch Group AG (UHR) , the biggest maker of
Swiss timepieces, reported accelerating profit growth that beat
analyst estimates as the company sold more Omega and Longines
watches and expanded production capacity at its factories.  Net income increased 27 percent to 880 million Swiss francs
($967 million) in the second half of 2012, according to
Bloomberg calculations based on full-year results released today
by the Biel, Switzerland-based company. That compares with the
first half’s 25 percent gain. Full-year profit rose to 1.6
billion francs, exceeding the 1.49 billion-franc average of 15
estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Swatch gained as much as 4.7 percent to a record in Zurich
trading. The company is benefiting from higher exposure to mid-
range timepieces than competitor  Cie. Financiere Richemont SA (CFR) ,
which has a greater concentration in the high-end segment, said
Rene Weber, an analyst at Bank Vontobel in Zurich. Richemont
said Jan. 21 that revenue growth in  Asia  stalled during the
third quarter. Swatch said it expects the Swiss watch industry
to expand 5 percent to 10 percent per year over the long term.  “The big surprise was the improvement in margins at watch
and jewelry, which improved in the second half,” Weber said.  The operating margin widened 0.8 percentage point to 23.5
percent for the year after a first-half decline, Swatch said.  Swatch  shares  rose 2.9 percent to 532.50 francs at 9:39 a.m.
in Zurich trading. Richemont added 1 percent to 77.85 francs.  Full-year operating profit rose 23 percent to 1.98 billion
francs, beating the 1.88 billion-franc average estimate.  ‘Healthy Growth’  Earnings at the production unit, which makes components for
watches, rose 37 percent, with profit as a proportion of sales
widening almost 4 percentage points to 20 percent. The unit
sells movements -- the mechanisms that make watches tick -- for
Swatch Group’s own brands, as well as to third parties.  “The signals from the markets around the world clearly
indicate continued healthy growth potential for the Swiss watch
industry,” the company said.  Swatch said Jan. 10 that gross revenue climbed 14 percent
in 2012. Sales from the watch and jewelry unit climbed 16
percent to 7.3 billion francs in the year, “with growth
distributed over all continents,” the company said.  Swatch proposed a 17 percent dividend increase to 6.75
francs per bearer share and 1.35 francs per registered share.  Chief Executive Officer Nick Hayek said Jan. 30 he expects
mainland  China ’s watch market to expand about 10 percent in
2013, helped by demand for mid-range and entry-level pieces.
Hayek has said he sees no reason for the Swiss watch industry
not to have “healthy” growth this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
