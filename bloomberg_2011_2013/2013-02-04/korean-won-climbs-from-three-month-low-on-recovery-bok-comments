South Korea ’s won rose from a three-
month low after U.S. and Chinese data added to signs of recovery
in the world’s largest economies and comments from a Bank of
Korea official eased intervention concern.  Government bonds  fell.  It is too early for any central bank response to the yen’s
slide against the won, Bank of Korea board member Moon Woo Sik
said in an interview last week in  Seoul , published by Bloomberg
today. U.S. employers added 157,000 workers last month following
a revised 196,000 gain in December and a 247,000 surge in
November, Labor Department figures showed Feb. 1.  China ’s
services industry grew at the fastest pace since August, an
official report showed yesterday.  “There’s been a lot of talk about the won level and one of
the options is to cut  interest rates  and today’s comments
indicate that urgency has lessened,” said Sean Yokota, head of
Asia strategy at Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken AB in  Singapore .
The market is a “little bit more comfortable” with the won’s
advance, he said.  The won gained 0.8 percent to 1,088.33 per dollar as of
12:34 p.m. in Seoul, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It
had depreciated 3.9 percent in the past three weeks and touched
1,098.25 on Feb. 1, the weakest level since Oct. 26. The won
strengthened 1.3 percent to 11.74 per yen today, adding to gains
in seven of the past eight weeks.  “There’s some rebound in the won after last week’s sharp
decline,” said Cho Young Bok, a Seoul-based currency dealer at
Daegu Bank. “Support for the currency also came from some
dollar sales from shipbuilders and manufacturers of heavy
machinery.”  ‘All Ready’  One-month implied volatility in the won, a gauge of
expected moves in the  exchange rate  used to price options,
dropped 23 basis points, or 0.23 percentage point, to 8 percent.  The won gained 8.3 percent versus the dollar in 2012 and
touched a 17-month high of 1,054.49 on Jan. 15, prompting South
Korean officials including Finance Minister Bahk Jae-Wan to say
they would strengthen measures to curb the currency’s
appreciation. Bahk said Jan. 23 the rally was too steep and the
government was “all ready” for measures to reduce its
volatility.  South Korea’s economy expanded 1.5 percent in the fourth
quarter from a year earlier, the central bank said Jan. 24. That
was less than the 1.8 percent median forecast in a Bloomberg
News survey.  The yield on South Korea’s 2.75 percent bonds due December
2015 rose two basis points to 2.78 percent, Korea Exchange
prices show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
