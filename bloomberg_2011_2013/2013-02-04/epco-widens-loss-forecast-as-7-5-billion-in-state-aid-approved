Tokyo Electric Power Co., taken over
by the government after the Fukushima atomic disaster, widened
its net loss forecast to 120 billion yen ($1.3 billion) or more
than double the previous estimate.  The forecast by  Japan ’s biggest power company for the year
ending March 2013 compares with the 62 billion yen mean estimate
of 3 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. The utility known as Tepco
had a previous loss projection of 45 billion yen.  Tepco and eight other regional power companies face
mounting losses as they import more fuels for gas-fired plants
and others after the disaster on March 11, 2011, caused a
shutdown of all but two of Japan’s 50 reactors. The utilities
will have to pay a fuel bill of about 6.8 trillion yen this
fiscal year, almost double that in fiscal 2010, according to the
government.  The utility posted a loss of 2.2 billion yen for the nine
months ended Dec. 31, compared with a 623 billion yen deficit a
year earlier.  Tepco  shares  fell 1 percent to close at 209 yen on the
Tokyo Stock Exchange, a 90 percent decline since the day before
the March 11 disaster caused a meltdown of three reactors at the
Fukushima plant. The company released the earnings report after
the market closed.  The government today approved additional aid of 696.8
billion yen to help the utility pay compensation to those who
lost jobs, homes and livelihoods in the disaster, said Trade and
Industry Minister Toshimitsu Motegi, who oversees the power
industry. The utility requested the additional aid in January
after raising the estimate on payouts to 3.2 trillion yen from
2.5 trillion yen.  The total cost of decontamination and compensation may
exceed 10 trillion yen, twice the 5 trillion yen allocated by
the government, Tepco said in November. Decommissioning the
damaged reactors at the Fukushima Dai-Ichi plant may “far
exceed” 1 trillion yen the utility has allocated, it said at
the time.  To contact the reporters on this story:
