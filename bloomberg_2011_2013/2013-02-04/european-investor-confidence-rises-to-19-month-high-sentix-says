European investor confidence surged
to the highest level in more than 1 1/2 years, adding to signs
that the economy is beginning to emerge from recession, the
Sentix research institute said today.  An  index  measuring sentiment in the euro-area economy
advanced to minus 3.9 from minus 7 in January, the Limburg,
Germany-based institute said in an e-mailed statement. That’s
the highest level since July 2011. Economists had forecast a
gain to minus 1.7, according to the median of 16 estimates in a
Bloomberg News survey. A gauge of economic expectations climbed
to 15.8 from 12, while a measure of current conditions rose to
minus 21.8 from minus 24.3, Sentix said.  The 17-nation euro region succumbed to recession in the
third quarter last year, pushing unemployment to a record 11.7
percent. Since then, economic confidence has improved and
European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  said last month he
expects a gradual recovery later this year.  “The euro-area economy is about to begin to grow again,”
said  Sebastian Wanke , an economist at Sentix. “Investors have
taken a while to recognize that things took a sustained turn for
the better last summer.”  Financial markets have rallied since July, when Draghi
pledged to do whatever it takes to safeguard the euro. The Stoxx
Europe 600 Index rose for an eighth month in January, its
longest winning streak since 1997, and bond yields of debt-
strapped countries eased.  To contact the reporter on this story:
