Baltimore’s Jacoby Jones returned the
second half kickoff 109 yards for a touchdown to give the
Baltimore Ravens a 28-6 lead over the San Francisco 49ers in the
Super Bowl.  Joe Flacco  capped the Ravens’ opening drive with a 13-yard
touchdown pass to Anquan Boldin at the Superdome in New Orleans
before the 49ers pulled within 7-3 on a 36-yard field goal in
the first quarter by David Akers.  Ravens quarterback Flacco found Dennis Pitta with a 1-yard
pass for a touchdown midway through the second quarter before
throwing a 56-yard scoring pass to Jones to extend Baltimore’s
lead to 21-3. Akers then kicked a 27-yard field goal as time
expired in the first half.  The 49ers are seeking to join the Pittsburgh Steelers as
the only team with six Super Bowl wins. San Francisco last won
the National Football League championship after the 1994 season.  The Ravens won in their only prior appearance in the Super
Bowl following the 2000 NFL season. All-Pro linebacker Ray
Lewis, the only player on Baltimore’s roster remaining from the
last championship team, has said he’s retiring after the game.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
