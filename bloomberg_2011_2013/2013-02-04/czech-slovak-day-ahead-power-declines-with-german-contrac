Day-ahead electricity in the  Czech
Republic  and Slovakia declined along with comparable prices in
 Germany .  Day-ahead electricity on the coupled markets of the Czech
Republic and Slovakia fell 5.4 percent to 32.78 euros ($44.47) a
megawatt-hour in a daily auction, according to the countriesâ€™
market operators. German next-day electricity declined 6.3
percent to 32.80 euros a megawatt-hour.  Hungarian day-ahead power slumped 32 percent to 32.95 euros
a megawatt-hour.  Polish day-ahead  electricity  for the next day was little
changed at 148.01 zloty ($48.14) a megawatt-hour, exchange data
compiled by Bloomberg show. Increased power exports and
unplanned outages were offset by an expected rise in wind
output. Wind speeds in Warsaw may rise to 26 kilometers (16
miles) per hour tomorrow, double the 10-year average of 13 kph,
according to CustomWeather Inc. data on Bloomberg.  Polish power for 2014 increased 0.3 percent to 163.50 zloty
a megawatt-hour, broker data on Bloomberg showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
