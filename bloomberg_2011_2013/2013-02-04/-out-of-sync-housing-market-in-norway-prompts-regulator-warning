Norway’s regulator will need to set
stricter standards than those enforced elsewhere as record  house
prices  and private debt levels grow more out of step with
developments in other nations, its top official signaled.  “Our starting point is a concern for overheated Norwegian
household borrowing and house price development,” Morten Baltzersen, the Financial Supervisory Authority director
general, said in a Jan. 31 interview in Oslo. “As our cycle is
out of sync with the rest of  Europe , so is our starting point.”  The FSA was last year ordered by the  Finance Ministry  to
review rules to curb covered bond issuance -- used in mortgage
finance -- after it surged eight-fold since 2007. The government
also told the regulator to consider almost tripling risk weights
on  mortgage loans  to make banks think twice before selling more
home loans.  Near record-low  interest rates  in the world’s fourth-
richest nation per capita, falling unemployment and wage growth
have pushed private debt levels to an all-time high in Norway.
Western Europe’s largest petroleum exporter has withstood the
euro area’s debt crisis thanks to its oil wealth, helping real
 home prices  surge almost 30 percent since 2008. Property values,
adjusted for inflation, have almost doubled in the past decade.  “Even if a major housing collapse is not yet inevitable we
believe that it should be a matter of great urgency for the
Norwegian authorities to seek to cool their housing market soon,
to reduce risks that the housing market becomes even more
overextended,” said Tina Mortensen, a London-based analyst at
Citigroup Inc., said today in a note to clients.  Covered Bonds  The ministry asked the regulator in December to assess a
“qualitative” rule on loan transfers by banks to mortgage
units, according to  letters  released that month. The request to
craft new rules came after the watchdog earlier last year said
that the use of mortgages as bond collateral means fewer high-
quality assets are left on balance sheets, while the low funding
costs of covered bonds risk drawing financing from other areas.  Norway ’s covered bond market has grown to about 800 billion
kroner ($146 billion) from less than 100 billion kroner in 2007
and makes up about 20 percent of bank funding, FSA data shows.  The agency is preparing a reply to the ministry by March 1.
While Baltzersen declined to comment on specific deliberations,
he said the risks are clear.  Funding Dangers  “You could easily end up in a situation where, after a
turn in the housing market, it would be difficult to raise
further covered bonds and at the same time the best quality
assets of the parent banks are tied up in mortgage companies,”
he said. “That could also lead to problems in other market
funding, such as senior borrowing in the parent bank.”  House prices rose an annual 8.5 percent in January, while
private debt levels will grow to more than 200 percent of
disposable incomes in 2013, according to central bank estimates.  The government in December proposed tripling risk weights
on home loans, requiring banks to set aside more capital to
protect them against mortgage losses. At 35 percent Norway’s
risk-weight requirement will be stricter than in neighboring
 Sweden , where the regulator has set a 15 percent minimum.  “There is reason to believe that higher risk weights, all
other things equal, would enhance banks’ resilience and reduce
the propensity to expand household lending,” Baltzersen said.
“The higher the risk weights the more capital is tied to this
lending activity and the more expensive it becomes.”  Industry Good  The ministry wants the FSA to investigate whether banks
should reduce their accounting ties to their mortgage lending
units. It also told the regulator and the central bank to look
into whether credit units that issue covered bonds should have
restricted bank concessions limiting them to mortgage lending.  The proposed regulatory changes prompted JPMorgan Cazenove
and  Nordea Bank AB (NDA)  to cut their ratings on Norway’s biggest
lender  DNB ASA (DNB)  to neutral and sell respectively.  “What’s good for the banking industry in the long-run is
not necessarily rewarded in the equity market in the short
term,” Baltzersen said. “Over time it is an advantage for a
bank to be solid.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
