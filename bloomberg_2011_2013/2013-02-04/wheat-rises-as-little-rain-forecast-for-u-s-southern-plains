Wheat rose for the first time in
three sessions on forecasts for little or no rain this week in
the U.S. southern Great Plains, where winter varieties used to
make bread are grown.  The worst drought since the Dust Bowl era of the 1930s will
persist in parts of  Kansas , the biggest U.S. grower of winter
wheat, further curbing the condition of a crop that was rated
only 20 percent good or excellent at the end of January, Telvent
DTN said today in a report. Light rain during the weekend will
not help crop conditions, the forecaster said.  “The southern Plains is dry and not much moisture is
expected anywhere,” Jamey Kohake, a broker and branch manager
at Paragon Investments in  Silver Lake , Kansas, said in a
telephone interview.  Wheat futures for March delivery gained 0.6 percent to
$7.6925 a  bushel at 10:01 a.m. on the Chicago Board of Trade.
The price last month rose 0.2 percent, the first increase since
September.  In the U.S., wheat is the fourth-largest crop, valued at
$14.4 billion in 2011, behind corn, soybeans and hay, government
data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
