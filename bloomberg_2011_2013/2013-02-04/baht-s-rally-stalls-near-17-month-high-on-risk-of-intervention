Thailand’s baht was little changed
today, after strengthening in eight of the last nine weeks, on
concern policy makers will intervene to check appreciation that
puts exports at risk. Government bonds were also steady.  Finance Minister Kittiratt Na-Ranong said last week there
is concern the strong baht will hurt tourism and overseas sales.
The currency reached 29.66 per dollar on Jan. 31, matching a 17-
month high reached on Jan. 21, and official data show overseas
investors poured a net $4.3 billion into government bonds and
stocks this year through Feb. 1. Thailand’s  SET Index (SET)  of shares
reached its highest level since 1994 on Feb. 1.  “Fund inflows and gains in the local stocks should be
positive for the baht,” said Wee-Khoon Chong, a Hong Kong-based
strategist at Societe Generale SA. “But there’s concern about
intervention across the region, mainly for some Southeast Asian
currencies like the baht.”  The baht traded at 29.78 per dollar as of 8:41 a.m. in
Bangkok, unchanged from its Feb. 1 close, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. One-month implied volatility, a measure
of expected moves in the exchange rate used to price options,
dropped 30 basis points, or 0.3 percentage point, to 5.27
percent.  Overseas shipments , which account for about two-thirds of
Southeast Asia’s second-largest economy, rose 14 percent in
December after a 27 percent increase the previous month, a Bank
of  Thailand  report showed on Jan. 31.  The yield on the government’s 3.625 percent bonds maturing
in June 2023 was little changed at 3.68 percent, data compiled
by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
