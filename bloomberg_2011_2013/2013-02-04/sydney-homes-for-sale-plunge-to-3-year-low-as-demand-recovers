Sydney home sale listings plunged 13
percent in January from a year earlier to the lowest level in
three years as interest rate cuts spur property purchases,
according to  SQM Research Pty.   Homes offered for sale online dropped to 23,467 in Sydney,
the lowest level of January listings since 2010, the research
group said in an e-mailed statement. Across  Australia , property
listings declined 2.9 percent from a year earlier to 335,429,
the Sydney-based company said.  “There are a number of signals now that the market is
gaining some traction,” SQM Managing Director Louis Christopher
said in the statement. “The interest rate cuts are now working
and that a housing recovery is now occurring.”  The Reserve Bank of Australia, which has lowered its
benchmark rate by 1.75 percentage points since Nov. 1, 2011,
will keep the rate at 3 percent tomorrow, 24 out of 28
economists in a Bloomberg News survey forecast. Home prices
across Australia’s eight state and territory capitals rose 1.8
percent in January from a year earlier, the RP Data-Rismark home
value index showed last week.  Prices in Sydney  jumped 3.4 percent in January from a year
earlier to a median of A$576,500 ($600,944) as homes sell faster
and with less discounting, Brisbane-based RP Data said. Sales of
newly built homes rose 6.2 percent in December in their third
monthly gain, a Jan. 31 private report showed.  Darwin had the biggest decline in listings in January,
dropping by 15 percent from a year earlier, and  Melbourne  had
the biggest increase, rising 1.8 percent, SQM said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
