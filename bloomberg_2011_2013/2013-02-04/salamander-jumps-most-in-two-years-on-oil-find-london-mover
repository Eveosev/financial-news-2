Salamander Energy Plc (SMDR) , a U.K. oil
explorer active in  Asia , soared the most in almost two years in
London trading after saying it discovered oil off  Indonesia .  Salamander shares jumped almost 12 percent to 207.50 pence,
the biggest intraday gain since March 18, 2011. It was up 20.10
pence at 206.10 pence at 9:45 a.m. local time, valuing the
company at about 529.6 million pounds ($833 million). Salamander
led advancing stocks on the FTSE All-Share Index, and the volume
traded was 83 percent higher than the three-month daily average.  The South Kecapi-1 exploration well, the first in
Salamander’s multiwell program in the North Kutei basin,
discovered a combined 40 meters (131 feet) of net oil and gas,
the company said today in a statement. It flowed about 6,000
barrels of light oil and 8 million cubic feet of gas per day in
the Bontang contract area.  “The presence of oil is a positive surprise,” Phil
Corbett, a London-based analyst at Deutsche Bank AG, wrote in an
e-mailed report. The well could have flowed more than 14,000
barrels of oil a day if it wasn’t constrained by the testing
equipment, he said.  Corbett has a buy recommendation on Salamander and predicts
the shares will rise to 280 pence. Deutsche Bank acts as the
company’s broker. Of 18 analysts who report their
recommendations to Bloomberg, 11 have buy ratings on Salamander,
six advise holding the shares and one advocates selling.  To contact the reporter on this story:
