Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine
Engineering Co. (042660) , the world’s third-largest shipbuilder by
revenue, said it will supply South Korea with 10 wind power
turbines this year.  Daewoo will supply the 2-megawatt capacity turbines to a
joint venture with Korea East-West Power Co. The turbines will
go to a wind farm project in Younggwang, southwest of Seoul, the
company said in a statement.  The project will generate enough electricity to supply
13,000 households a year once it is completed in the third
quarter, Daewoo said, without disclosing the project’s cost.  The shipbuilder acquired DeWind Inc. from Irvine-based
Composite Technology Corp. for about $50 million in 2009 to move
into the wind-turbine industry. It is building  wind turbines 
using DeWind technology to meet demand from the U.S. and  Canada .  To contact the reporter on this story:
