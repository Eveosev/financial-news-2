The San Francisco 49ers scored 17
points after waiting out a 34-minute power failure to cut the
Baltimore Ravens’ lead to 28-23 heading into the final quarter
at the  Super Bowl  in New Orleans.  San Francisco trailed 28-6 after allowing the Ravens’
Jacoby Jones to return the second-half kickoff 108 yards for a
touchdown.  Michael Crabtree  then hauled in a 31-yard touchdown
pass from Colin Kaepernick,  Frank Gore  scored on a 6-yard run
and  David Akers  kicked a 34-yard field goal for the 49ers.  The largest deficit overcome for a winning team in the
National Football League’s Super Bowl was 10 points, by the 1987
Washington Redskins and the 2009 New Orleans Saints.  The 49ers’ third-quarter rally came after a power failure
at the Superdome knocked out about half the lights in the
stadium. Shortly after play resumed, San Francisco scored 17
points in a span of 4 minutes and 10 seconds.  Ravens quarterback  Joe Flacco  threw three first-half
touchdown passes as Baltimore opened a 21-6 halftime lead. The
Ravens’ defense forced two turnovers by the 49ers, including the
first interception by a San Francisco quarterback in six Super
Bowl appearances.  Flacco threw touchdown passes to Anquan Boldin, Dennis
Pitta and Jones, who scored on a 58-yard catch with 1:58 left in
the second quarter before starting the second half with his
kickoff return for a touchdown.  The 49ers (13-4-1) are seeking their sixth Super Bowl title
in as many appearances, with their most recent NFL championship
coming after the 1994 season. San Francisco entered the game as
a 3 1/2-point favorite, according to oddsmakers.  The Ravens (13-6) won their lone Super Bowl title following
the 2000 NFL season. All-Pro linebacker  Ray Lewis , the only
player on Baltimore’s roster remaining from the last
championship team, has said he’s retiring after the game.  To contact the reporter on this story:
