Anderson Investments Pte Ltd., a
wholly owned unit of Singapore’s Temasek Holdings, signed an
exchangeable rights subscription agreement with Indonesian
investment company PT  Multipolar. (MLPL)   Anderson paid 2.9 trillion rupiah ($300 million) for the
rights, which can be converted into a 26.1 percent stake in PT
PT Matahari Putra Prima, which operates hypermarkets in
 Indonesia , Multipolar said in a statement to the Jakarta Stock
Exchange today after the market closed.  Multipolar said the investment would support future growth
and expansion plans of Matahari.  Indonesian retailers may benefit from strong  consumer
spending  and this year’s increase in minimum wages. Private
consumption accounted for 63 percent of Indonesia’s GDP and had
risen by 5.7 percent in the third quarter from a year earlier,
according to government data.  Investment and domestic consumption will support economic
growth this year, forecast to expand 6.6 percent to 6.8 percent,
Finance Minister  Agus Martowardojo  said January 14.  Multipolar shares rose 24 percent today to 440 rupiah, the
highest close since August 18, 2005, and Matahari Putra’s stock
closed 24 percent higher to 1,530 rupiah, the biggest jump since
October 5, 2010. Both stocks outperformed the 0.2 percent rise
in the Jakarta Composite index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
