Lithuania called on European Union
leaders to approve a free-trade accord with Ukraine to show the
bloc is serious about pursuing closer ties with the former
Soviet republic.  The trade pact would potentially precede a planned
Association Agreement to reassure Ukraine and encourage it to
boost democratic standards, the Foreign Ministry in the capital,
Vilnius, said today  on its website . Ukrainian President  Viktor Yanukovych  is due to visit the Baltic nation Feb. 6 before
meeting EU officials in Brussels Feb. 25.  The signing of the Association Agreement, originally
scheduled for 2011, has been delayed because the 27-nation bloc
objects to the jailing of opposition leader  Yulia Tymoshenko , a
former prime minister. Russia wants Ukraine, whose economy is in
recession, to join a customs union with Belarus and  Kazakhstan 
in exchange for cheaper natural gas.  “A free-trade area would create substantial economic
benefits for both the European Union and Ukraine,” Vytautas
Leskevicius, Lithuania’s Deputy Foreign Minister, said today in
Brussels at a preparatory session for a European Council meeting
that starts Feb. 7, according to the ministry. Lithuania, which
holds the rotating EU presidency in the second half of 2013,
wants Ukraine’s Association Agreement finalized at a summit in
Vilnius in November, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
