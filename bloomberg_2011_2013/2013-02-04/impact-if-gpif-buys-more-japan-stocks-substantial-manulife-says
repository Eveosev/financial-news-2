Hidehiro Tomioka, who helps oversee
$1.3 billion in Japanese equities at Manulife Asset Management
(Japan) Ltd. in Tokyo comments on Japan’s Government Pension
Investment Fund’s decision to discuss changes to its asset
balance:  “They are a huge investor and any sort of meaningful
 asset-allocation  change will impact the market substantially.”  “The impact on the Japanese equities if they were to
increase would be substantial because they’re a big investor and
GPIF changing its asset allocation would be very symbolic. It’s
likely that other pension funds, both public and private, will
consider following suit.”  “I doubt that they will increase Japanese equities.
Because they are conservative, slow, the late-comers. I guess
they are still risk-averse.”  “If GPIF were to increase Japanese equities, the blue-
chips would be the ones that benefit the most. I would look into
these international blue-chips, if that were to happen.”  “With the  bond market  and long-term  interest rate , I don’t
think it’ll be that negative as demand for Japan government
bonds is still strong, especially from financial institutions.”  “If you look at the ratios, like loan-to-deposits, it’s
still low, so there’s still plenty of money chasing yield. The
impact would be minimal even if they did decide to sell some of
their bonds. For at least the next couple of years, demand still
looks favorable.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
