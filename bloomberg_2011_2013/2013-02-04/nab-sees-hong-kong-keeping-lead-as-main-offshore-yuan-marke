Steve Lambert, executive general
manager for global  capital markets  at  National Australia Bank
Ltd. (NAB) , the third-largest underwriter of yuan-denominated bonds in
 Hong Kong  this year, comments on the market for the currency
outside China.  Australia’s fourth-largest lender arranged 2.77 billion
yuan ($440 million) of Dim Sum bonds, including certificates of
deposit, in the city this year, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
The bank ranked 13th last year.  Lambert spoke in an interview on Feb. 1.  On the offshore market in Hong Kong and Europe:  “Hong Kong, for the next few years, will still be the key
center but I think you will start seeing a bigger bid
predominantly from Europe. So I think Europe will be
increasingly important and you will see deals that will be
targeted into London.”  On Australian companies’ interest in using the  yuan :  “Our better Australian corporate credits at the moment are
all pretty cashed up. And they do have a lot of choice about
where they fund themselves. We’re trying to present CNH as
another option, a very viable option,” he said, referring to
the yuan traded in Hong Kong.  To contact the reporters on this story:
