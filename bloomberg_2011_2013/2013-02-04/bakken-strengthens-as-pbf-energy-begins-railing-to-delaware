Bakken oil on the spot market
strengthened to its narrowest discount to the U.S. benchmark
crude in six weeks as  PBF Energy Inc. (PBF)  expects to receive its
first rail shipment from North Dakota at its Delaware refinery.  PBF finished construction on the second train unloading
terminal at its 182,800-barrel-a-day Delaware City refinery, the
company said in a statement. PBF expects to unload its first
unit train of Bakken oil this week, with 17 more scheduled to
arrive in the next two weeks.  Bakken oil priced in Clearbrook, Minnesota, narrowed its
 discount  to West Texas Intermediate in Cushing, Oklahoma, by 15
cents, to $3.10 a barrel at 12:13 p.m.  New York  time, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. The spread between the two oils
changed for the first time in two weeks and is the smallest
since Dec. 20.  Western Canada Select, a mixture of heavy crudes from
Alberta, strengthened by 75 cents a barrel to $30.75 below the
U.S. benchmark, the smallest discount since Jan. 2. Syncrude, a
synthetic light, sweet oil upgraded from bitumen, weakened 60
cents to 25 cents above WTI.  Gulf Coast oils strengthened as WTI weakened relative to
Brent, the European benchmark that offshore crudes are priced
against. The WTI-Brent discount grew 27 cents to $19.26 a barrel
at 12:37 p.m., the widest it’s been in a month.  The spread began growing last week after Bill Ordemann, a
vice president for  Enterprise Product Partners LP (EPD) , said
restrictions at the Seaway pipeline’s Jones Creek terminal in
Texas would last until a new pipeline lateral is finished in
late 2013.  Enterprise and  Enbridge Inc. (ENB)  expanded Seaway, which carries
crude to Houston from Cushing, to a capacity of 400,000 barrels
a day on Jan. 11 to help relieve a glut of crude oil stored at
Cushing, the delivery point for futures traded on the New York
Mercantile Exchange.  Light Louisiana Sweet oil , the benchmark light, sweet crude
on the Gulf Coast, strengthened by 30 cents to $19.60 above WTI.
Heavy Louisiana Sweet rose 20 cents to a $19.40 premium.  To contact the reporter on this story:
