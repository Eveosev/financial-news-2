MISC Bhd. (MISC) , the world’s second-largest
liquefied natural gas shipper, surged the most in 14 years in
 Kuala Lumpur  stock trading after receiving a takeover offer from
 Malaysia ’s state-owned energy company Petroliam Nasional Bhd.  The stock  advanced  17 percent to 5.21 ringgit at 10:21 a.m.
local time, poised for its steepest increase since Jan. 26,
1999, with trading volume triple its three-month daily average.
It was the biggest gainer in the  MSCI Emerging Markets Index (MXEF) ,
which added 0.5 percent.  Parent Petroliam Nasional, or Petronas, offered 5.30
ringgit per share in cash for the remaining 37 percent stake in
the shipping unit, according to a stock exchange filing on Jan.
31, valuing the deal at 8.8 billion ringgit ($2.8 billion.)
That’s 19 percent more than MISC’s last traded price of 4.45
ringgit on Jan. 31, before trading was halted for the
announcement. The exchange was closed Feb. 1 for a holiday.  “The takeover offer was a positive surprise,” Raymond Yap
and Calvin Yew, analysts at CIMB Group Holdings Bhd., wrote in a
report dated Feb. 1. “We suspect minority shareholders will
accept the offer given that the weak tanker shipping markets are
expected to keep the share price low over the next one to two
years.” They raised their share price estimate to 5.30 ringgit
from 4.32 ringgit to match the offer price.  Before today’s surge, MISC shares have tumbled about 46
percent over the past two years as it booked losses and exited
the liner industry. It shuttered its container-ship business
last year to focus on LNG tankers after the cargo-box unit made
$789 million of losses over three years due to global
overcapacity and falling rates.  Today’s share price jump boosted MISC’s gain this year to
21 percent, compared with the 3 percent decline in the benchmark
 FTSE Bursa Malaysia KLCI Index. (FBMKLCI)   MISC operates the world’s second biggest fleet of LNG ships
after Qatar Gas Transport Co., according to Clarkson Plc, the
world’s largest shipbroker.  To contact the reporter on this story:
