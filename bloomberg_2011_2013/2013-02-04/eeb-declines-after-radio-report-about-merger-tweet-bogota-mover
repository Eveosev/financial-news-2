Empresa de Energia de Bogota SA , the
electricity provider in  Colombia ’s capital, dropped to a one-
month low after W Radio reported the company’s newly appointed
president had mentioned on his personal Twitter account a plan
to merge city-controlled utilities.  Shares fell 2.2 percent to 1,330 pesos at 2:35 p.m. in
Bogota, headed for its lowest closing price since Jan. 2. The
company, which was added to the  Colcap index  last week, has
rallied 4.3 percent this year.  Fernando Gomez, who was named EEB president last week, said
on his Twitter social-media account that merging the energy
provider with the city’s water utility would make a stronger
company, W Radio reported on its  website , without saying when
the posting was made. The idea of merging the companies “is in
the past,” Gomez said in response to the report in an  interview 
broadcast on W.  “I don’t think the company needs significant changes or
differences than continuing the path for growth and profits that
it has handed to investors,” Gomez said on W.  A spokesman for EEB, Juan Felipe Gonzalez, declined to
comment on Gomez’s Twitter posts. The Twitter account cited by
W, @ferchogomez70, is private.  “The market didn’t like the Tweets from the new
president,” Juan David Ballen, an analyst at Alianza Valores,
said by e-mail.  Link to Company News:  To contact the reporters on this story:
