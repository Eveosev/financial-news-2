Analysts covering  Brazil  raised their
forecast for 2013 inflation for the fifth straight week, as
price pressures continue strong even while the economy struggles
to accelerate.  Brazil’s inflation in 2013 will accelerate to 5.68 percent,
according to the median estimate in a central bank survey of
about 100 analysts published today. The economists had forecast
5.67 percent the previous week.  President Dilma Rousseff’s government has expanded measures
aimed at spurring activity in the world’s second-largest
emerging market after two years of declining growth. Increased
consumption driven by tax cuts and near record-low unemployment
has been overshadowed by falling investment and weak business
confidence.  Economic growth slowed to 1 percent last year, the central
bank estimates, following expansion of 2.7 percent in 2011 and
7.5 percent in 2010. Even so, annual consumer price  inflation 
quickened to 6.02 percent through mid-January, the national
statistics agency said Jan. 23, and has exceeded the central
bank’s 4.5 percent target for the last 29 months.  Gross domestic product will expand 3.1 percent this year,
the survey showed, unchanged from the previous week. Economists
in the survey held their prediction for 2014 inflation at 5.50
percent and boosted their growth estimate to 3.70 percent from
3.65 percent.  Industrial output was unchanged in December from a month
earlier and contracted 2.7 percent last year, the national
statistics agency said on Feb.1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
