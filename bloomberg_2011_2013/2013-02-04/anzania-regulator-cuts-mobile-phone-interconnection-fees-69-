Tanzania cut the fees that mobile-
phone companies charge each other for calls across networks by
69 percent starting March 1 as it seeks to boost competition and
grow subscriber numbers.  The so-called interconnection rate will fall to 34.92
shillings from 112 shillings, the  Tanzania Communications
Regulatory Authority  said in statement posted on its website
today. The fee will be cut gradually to 26.96 shillings by 2017,
according to the statement.  “It is the considered view of the Authority that traffic
patterns will change through increase of subscribers and air
time,” TCRA said.    Vodacom Group Ltd.’s (VOD)  Tanzanian unit, the country’s biggest
operator by subscribers, on Jan. 21 said the reduction in the
interconnection fee may curb investment in telecommunications
infrastructure in East Africa’s second-largest economy.
Johannesburg-based Vodacom is 65 percent owned by Newbury,
England-based  Vodafone Group Plc. (VOD)   Tanzania has 47 mobile subscribers per 100 people, compared
with an average of 62 in neighboring Kenya and 100 in South
Africa, the continent’s largest economy, according to data
published on the website of the Geneva-based International
Telecommunications Union.  To contact the reporter on this story:
