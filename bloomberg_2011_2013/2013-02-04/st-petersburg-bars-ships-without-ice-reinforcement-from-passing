St. Petersburg’s main port barred
ships without sufficient anti-ice protection from entering
without icebreakers because of floe buildup in the Gulf of
Finland outside  Russia ’s second-largest city.  Ice thickness in the port area grew more than 30
centimeters (1 foot), the port’s administration said on its
 website  today. Seven cargo vessels were waiting to enter the
port and nine were waiting to steam away, it said.  The St. Petersburg port is the second-biggest general cargo
port in Russia and the biggest port in the country’s northwest.
It handled 57.8 million tons of cargo in 2012, 4 percent less
than a year earlier.  In February-March 2011, the ice grew to 1-meter thick,
hindering the passage of as many as 45 cargo vessels.  Toyota
Motor (7203)  Corp. and  Ford Motor (F)  Co. local plants suspended production
for several days because of delays in the delivery of car
components.  To contact the reporter on this story:
