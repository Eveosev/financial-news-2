The Australian state of Victoria is
considering laws that would designate the rainfall falling onto
 Melbourne ’s streets and down drains as property of the state,
the Age newspaper reported, citing Water Minister Peter Walsh.  The move, which would see licences to use the water sold to
the highest bidder, is part of a push to recognize rainwater as
“a valuable alternative-water-supply opportunity,” Walsh told
the newspaper.  Some 450 billion liters of stormwater runs off Melbourne
each year, about the same as the total amount of drinking water
consumed, the newspaper said, adding ownership of stormwater in
local-government drains would likely be owned by Melbourne
Water, which would issue usage licenses.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
