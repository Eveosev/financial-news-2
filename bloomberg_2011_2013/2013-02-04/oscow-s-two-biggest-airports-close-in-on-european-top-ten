Moscow’s two biggest airports are
closer to breaking into the Top 10 of  Europe ’s largest hubs
after more established centers like Rome and  Madrid  lost ground
last year as the the debt crisis rattled the countries.  Passenger traffic grew 9.6 percent to 28.2 million
travelers at Domodedovo airport, the Russian capital’s largest
hub, and 16 percent at Sheremetyevo International, according to
an Airports Council International Europe report released today.  The Russian aerodromes are gaining ground as their
traditional European rivals struggle to add travelers as a
sluggish economy hurts demand. London’s Gatwick Airport, ranked
No. 10, grew 1.6 percent in 2012 and served just over six
million more people than Domodedovo, while the difference in
traffic between Sheremetyevo and Paris Orly Airport was about
one million passengers, ACI said in the report.  “Europe is a two-speed aviation market,” Olivier Jankovec, Director General ACI Europe, said in a statement. “EU
airports are stuck in recession for both passenger and freight
traffic,”  Non-EU airports growth has jumped 38 percent since 2008,
compared with 2.5 percent at European Union hubs, Jankovec said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
