U.K.  10-year gilts  rose, pushing
yields to the lowest level in a week before a report analysts
said will show retail sales fell in August, underpinning demand
for the safest assets.  Sales including auto fuel slipped 0.3 percent from July,
according to the median estimate of 19 economists in a Bloomberg
survey. The U.K. Debt Management Office is scheduled to sell 4.5
billion pounds ($7.3 billion) of gilts due in September 2017.
The pound strengthened against the euro after a separate report
showed manufacturing and services industries in  Europe  shrank
more than estimated this month.  “The market’s attention has again turned to the underlying
health of the global economy,” said  Brian Barry , an analyst at
Investec Bank Plc in  London . “As such, safe-haven assets,
including gilts and bunds, are outperforming relative to riskier
assets.”  The 10-year gilt yield fell four basis points, or 0.04
percentage point, to 1.80 percent at 9:22 a.m. London time. The
1.75 percent bond due in September 2022 gained 0.335, or 3.35
pounds per 1,000-pound face amount, to 99.485.  A composite  index  based on a survey of purchasing managers
in services and manufacturing in the 17-nation euro area dropped
to 45.9 in September. A reading below 50 signals contraction.  Five-year gilts also advanced for a fourth day before the
auction, with the rate declining two basis points to 0.81
percent. The 1 percent 2017 securities attracted an average
yield of 0.942 percent when they were last sold on July 4.  Sterling gained 0.3 percent to 80.17 pence per euro. The
pound fell 0.2 percent to $1.6185, after touching $1.6164, the
weakest level since Sept. 14.  The pound has appreciated 0.7 percent in the past month,
according to Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes, which track
10 developed-market currencies. The dollar fell 2.6 percent and
the euro rose 3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
