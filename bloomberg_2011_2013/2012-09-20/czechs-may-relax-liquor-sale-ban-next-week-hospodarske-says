The Czech government may present a
plan to relax the sale ban on beverages containing over 20
percent of alcohol by Sept. 26 as it takes measures to control
liquor distribution,  Hospodarske Noviny  said, citing a decree
signed by Finance Minister Miroslav Kalousek.  The ban, imposed after dozens of people died from illegally
bottled liquor containing methyl-alcohol, will be relaxed to
allow the sale of bottles produced and sealed after the methanol
crisis, the newspaper said. The government plans to restrict the
distribution of hard liquor to licensed retailers only,  Lidove
Noviny  reported.  To contact the reporters on this story:
