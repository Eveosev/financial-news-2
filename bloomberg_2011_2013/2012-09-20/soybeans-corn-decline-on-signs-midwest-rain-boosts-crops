Soybean and corn futures fell on
speculation that Midwest rain during August limited crop damage
caused by severe drought in June and July in the U.S., the
world’s biggest producer of the commodities.  Soybean yields are about 5 bushels an acre higher than
farmers forecast, and corn yields have been a “pleasant
surprise” after rain in the past 30 days, Scott Stoller, a
grain merchandiser at Michlig Agricenter Inc. in Manlius,
 Illinois , said in a telephone interview. Dry weather expected in
the next two weeks will quicken the harvest, he said.  “The markets are reacting to the reality that U.S.
supplies will be larger” than the government forecast, Bill Biedermann, a market analyst at Allendale Inc. in McHenry,
Illinois, said in a telephone interview.  Soybean futures for November delivery fell 3 percent to
close at $16.1875 a bushel at 2 p.m. on the Chicago Board of
Trade. Earlier, the price touched $16.16, the lowest for the
most-active contract since Aug. 15. This week, the oilseed has
dropped 6.9 percent, heading for the biggest slump in three
months. The commodity soared to a record $17.89 on Sept. 4.  Corn futures for December delivery declined 1.4 percent to
$7.46 a bushel. The price has dropped 12 percent from a record
$8.49 on Aug. 10.  Corn output will fall 13 percent this year to 10.727
billion bushels (272.5 million metric tons), the lowest since
2006, the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  said on Sept. 12. The
soybean harvest may be 14 percent smaller at 2.634 billion
bushels. About 10 percent of the soybean crop and 26 percent of
the corn were harvested as of Sept. 16, agency data show.  Corn also fell as U.S. export  sales  for delivery before
Aug. 31 fell to 69,878 metric tons last week, compared with
598,126 tons a year earlier and the lowest for the date since at
least 2003, government  data  show.  “Export demand is awful,” Biedermann said.  Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, valued at $76.5 billion in
2011, followed by soybeans at $35.8 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
