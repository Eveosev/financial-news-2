China’s  yuan  rose to a five-month
high, breaching the 6.3 per dollar level, on speculation capital
flows into emerging markets will quicken as policy makers in the
world’s largest economies act to spur growth.  The  Bank of Japan (8301)  expanded its asset-purchase fund
yesterday, joining the Federal Reserve and the European Central
Bank in announcing plans to pump money into financial markets.
The People’s Bank of China Governor  Zhou Xiaochuan  wrote in a
commentary published in the Financial News this week that the
central bank will keep the continuity and stability of monetary
policies and at the same time make adjustments that are more
forward-looking, targeted and effective.  “With quantitative easing in major economies, funds are
flowing into Asia and China is among the top destinations,”
said Kenix Lai, a foreign-exchange analyst at  Bank of East Asia
Ltd. (23)  in  Hong Kong . “However, the yuan’s upside above the 6.3
level is limited as exporters are still facing great pressure.”  The yuan gained 0.20 percent to 6.2965 per dollar at 10:06
a.m. in Shanghai, according to the China Foreign Exchange Trade
System. The currency, which can trade as much as 1 percent on
either side of the central bank’s daily fixing, touched 6.2945,
the strongest level since April 17. The PBOC set the  reference
rate  0.02 percent stronger at 6.3380 per dollar today.  Economic Outlook  China’s 2012 expansion will surpass the 7.5 percent growth
target set earlier this year, Xinhua News Agency reported on
Sept. 15, citing Fan Jianping, director of the Economic
Projection Department at the State Information Center. Growth
will stabilize in the second half as the government takes steps
including faster approvals of major projects, Fan said.  Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards increased 0.15
percent to 6.4065 per dollar in Hong Kong, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. They traded at a 1.7 percent discount to
the spot rate in Shanghai.  One-month implied volatility, a measure of exchange-rate
swings used to price options, was little changed at 1.35
percent. In Hong Kong’s offshore market, the yuan rose 0.18
percent to 6.3094 today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
