Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)  will return two
of its six Polish shale gas exploration licenses to the

jointly with  Total SA (FP)  and Legionowo permit in central Poland and
has not decided about the future of the remaining four licenses,
Adam Kopysc, public and government affairs adviser for Exxon
Mobil Exploration and Production in Warsaw, said today in an e-
