New York Jets Pro Bowl cornerback
 Darrelle Revis  was cleared for contact today for the first time
since suffering a concussion in the first game of the National
Football League season.  Revis, 27, is expected to practice with the team today as
it prepares for its Sept. 23 game against the Miami Dolphins,
team spokesman Bruce Speight said in an e-mail. He will undergo
further evaluations after practice and his status for the game
remains unknown, Speight said.  A Pro Bowl selection in each of the past four seasons,
Revis was injured in the fourth quarter of the Jets’ Sept. 9
victory over the Buffalo Bills when he was accidentally kicked
in the head by teammate  Bart Scott . He had an interception, the
19th of his six-year career, prior to the injury.  Revis didn’t play last week in a loss to the Pittsburgh
Steelers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
