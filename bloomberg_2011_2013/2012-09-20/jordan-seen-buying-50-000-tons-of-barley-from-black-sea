Jordan bought 50,000 metric tons of
barley from the Black Sea region,  SovEcon  said, without saying
where it got the information.  The grain was purchased on a cost-and-freight basis from
 Korea â€™s Daewoo for delivery in the first half of December, the
Moscow-based agricultural researcher said today on its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
