Inmet Mining Corp. (IMN)  said it
anticipates mailing a formal C$112 million ($114.6 million) bid
for  Petaquilla Minerals Ltd. (PTQ)  to Petaquilla shareholders within
the next two weeks.  The offer, which was proposed Sept. 5, won’t proceed if
Petaquilla goes through with a $210 million private placement,
Toronto, Canada-based Inmet said today in a statement. Inmet is
proposing to pay C$0.48 or 0.0109 of an Inmet share for each
Petaquilla share.  Inmet is developing a $6.2 billion copper and gold mine in
Panama that will be the country’s largest. Buying Vancouver-
based Petaquilla would give it control of the nearby Molejon
gold mine, eliminating what Inmet’s Chief Executive Officer
Jochen Tilk said in a Sept. 5 conference call would be “a
potential source of disruption.”  Petaquilla dropped 3.2 percent to C$0.60 in Toronto,
implying investors expect a higher offer.  Petaquilla said Sept. 6 it was evaluating Inmet’s proposal.
Dimitri Zolotov, a spokesman for Petaquilla, couldn’t
immediately be reached today for comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
