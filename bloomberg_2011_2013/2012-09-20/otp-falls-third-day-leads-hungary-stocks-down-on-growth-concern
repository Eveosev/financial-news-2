OTP Bank Nyrt. (OTP) ,  Hungary ’s biggest
lender, fell for a third day, leading the country’s stocks lower
on concern that the slowing global economy is limiting appetite
for riskier assets.  The shares dropped 2.5 percent to 3,840 forint by the close
in Budapest, bringing the three-day slide to 6.1 percent. The
BUX index of shares declined 0.3 percent to 18,684.10,
retreating for a fourth day to the lowest in a week.  Emerging-market stocks fell the most in more than eight
weeks after a survey signaled Chinese manufacturing shrank and
data showed Japanese exports declined. Manufacturing in the
Philadelphia region shrank for a fifth straight month in
September, reinforcing signs the industry will offer less
support to the  U.S. economy .  “The general slump and negative mood in the world heralds
a decline” for the Hungarian market, Jozsef Miro, a Budapest-
based analyst at Erste Group Bank AG, wrote in a research report
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
