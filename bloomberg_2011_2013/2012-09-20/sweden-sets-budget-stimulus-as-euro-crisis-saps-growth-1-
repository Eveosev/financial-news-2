Sweden presented a stimulus budget
as eroding demand from the crisis-riddled euro area stymies
growth in the largest Nordic economy.  Sweden will post a 0.3 percent deficit of gross domestic
product this year and 0.6 percent in 2013, the government said
in its budget for 2013 handed out to reporters today in
 Stockholm .  “We’re in a difficult international economic environment
and now that Sweden has proved more resilient we have
prioritized investments for the future,” Finance Minister
 Anders Borg  said. The risk for weaker economic developments is
dominant in the main scenario, the ministry said.  The government estimates next year’s budget initiatives
will boost growth by 0.4 percentage point and raise employment
by 17,000 jobs in 2014. The central bank last week cut its main
rate for a third time since December to 1.25 percent as the
economy slowed more than estimated last quarter amid weakening
European  export  demand. Sweden sells about half of its output
abroad, of which about 70 percent go to  Europe .  The government said today that economic  growth  will be 1.6
percent this year and 2.7 percent next year, repeating earlier
forecasts. Inflation will average 1 percent in 2012 and 1.2
percent in 2013, while unemployment will average 7.6 percent and
7.5 percent, it predicted.  The krona weakened 0.1 percent to 8.503 per euro.  Sweden ’s
10-year yield fell three basis points to 1.55 percent.  Corporate Tax  Borg last month said the government will spend 23 billion
kronor ($3.5 billion), or about 0.7 percent of GDP, on new
initiatives next year after criticism from the Social Democrat-
led opposition that it’s not using its fiscal strength to
stimulate growth and cut unemployment.  The government will cut the corporate tax for a second time
since 2009 to 22 percent from 26.3 percent and the tax on
pensions for a fourth time since coming to power in 2006. It
also plans to boost spending on research and development,
investments in roads and railways and programs to cut youth
unemployment to boost the potential of the economy before
elections in 2014.  The four-party government coalition, which was elected for
another four years in 2010, is trailing the opposition in polls
half way through its current term, even after cutting Sweden’s
public debt ratio every year since 2009, The debt level will
reach 35.6 percent of gross domestic product this year, the
European Commission estimates. That compares with an average
burden of 91.8 percent in the 17-member euro area in 2012,
according to the commission.  Sweden’s economy, home to companies such as  Ericsson AB (ERICB) ,
the biggest mobile systems maker, and  Volvo AB (VOLVB) , the second-
largest truck maker, grew less than first estimated in the
second quarter at an annual 1.3 percent, down from an earlier
estimate of 2.3 percent.  The government has cut income taxes four times, reduced
unemployment and sickness benefits, and abolished the  wealth tax 
to increase the incentive to work since 2007. It has delayed
plans for another income tax cut to safeguard public finances.  To contact the reporter on this story:
