Arik Airlines Ltd. ,  Nigeria ’s
largest airline, said its domestic flights were suspended
indefinitely after employees of the Federal Airports Authority
of Nigeria stopped a plane from flying today in Lagos, the
commercial capital.  The airline, which operates  23 aircraft , flies at least
thrice weekly to  London  and New York. Its international
operations are not affected by the suspension, Arik Air said in
an e-mailed statement today..  The Lagos-based airline appealed to the government for
“urgent intervention” so it can resume its domestic
operations. Passengers will be re-booked on other flights when
operations resume, the airline said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
