DreamWorks Animation SKG Inc. (DWA) ,
maker of the “Shrek” films, rose the most since June after an
analyst upgraded the stock, citing the November film “Rise of
the Guardians,” a boost in production and higher TV profit.  DreamWorks Animation, based in Glendale,  California , gained
3.8 percent to $18.38 at the close in New York, the biggest
advance since a 5 percent rise on June 27.  Tony Wible , an analyst at Philadelphia-based Janney
Montgomery Scott LLC, raised his  rating  on DreamWorks Animation
to neutral from sell in a note today. The rating means Janney
views the stock as fairly valued and likely to perform in line
with comparable companies.  “Rise of the Guardians,” set for release Nov. 21, may be
a much-needed hit for DreamWorks Animation, Wible said. The
company is boosting production to at least three domestic films
a year and could make more through its Oriental DreamWorks
venture. The company may also benefit from higher TV revenue
under a new film distribution accord, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
