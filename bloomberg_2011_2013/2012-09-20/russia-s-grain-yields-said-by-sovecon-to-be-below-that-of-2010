Grain yields in  Russia , the world’s
third biggest  wheat exporter  last season, are lower than they
were in 2010 during the worst drought in half a century,
according to SovEcon.  The yield was 1.83 metric tons a hectare (2.47 acres) on
Sept. 18, lower than in 2010, Moscow-based researcher said on
its website today. It was 2.34 tons a hectare last year in
September and 1.92 tons a hectare in September 2010, Federal
State Statistics Service data show. SovEcon didn’t provide
comparable figures.  Russia’s grain production is set to decline 23 percent this
year because of dry weather, according to Agriculture Minister
Nikolai Fedorov. Siberia and Ural areas, which made up 23
percent of last year’s production, will have record low crops
this year, SovEcon said.  Twenty of Russia’s 83 regions have crop damage this year
and have declared emergencies because of the drought, according
to the  Agriculture Ministry . Some 8,763 farms have been affected
by dry weather. Russia has harvested 63 million tons of grain
from 76 percent of the planted area, Fedorov said yesterday.
That’s down from 77 million tons this time last year, he said.  Russia’s wheat exports may drop to 8 million tons this
season from 21.6 million tons a year earlier, according to the
 U.S. Department of Agriculture . That would make it the fifth
largest wheat shipper after the U.S.,  Australia ,  Canada  and the
European Union, according to USDA data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
