regional benchmark retreating from its highest close since May,
after Japan’s exports fell for a third month and on signs

than half of its sales outside Japan, slid 3.2 percent.  Nippon

since May 3 as central banks from  Europe  to the U.S. and  Japan 
took action to stimulate growth.  “We’ve very concerned about the near-term outlook for the
global economic picture,” said Peter Elston, Singapore-based
head of Asia-Pacific strategy at Aberdeen Asset Management,
which oversees about $270 billion. “There’s some fairly
significant weakness just around the corner and that’s going to
have a fairly big impact on corporates and markets. We’re fairly
cautious,” he told Bloomberg TV.  Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average slid 1.6 percent after a
Finance Ministry report today showed exports from the world’s
third-largest economy declined 5.8 percent in August from a year
earlier.  Australia’s  S&P/ASX 200 Index (AS51)  lost 0.5 percent, South

Times Index declined 0.4 percent.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slid 0.3 percent

target and sales of existing U.S. homes rose more than expected.  China Manufacturing  Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index lost 1.2 percent and China’s
Shanghai Composite dropped 2.1 percent as a preliminary report
today showed China’s manufacturing may contract for an 11th
month in September. The reading was 47.8 for a purchasing
managers’ index released by HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit
Economics. A number below 50 signals a contraction.  Exporters fell, with Kyocera sliding 3.2 percent to 6,700
yen. Canon Inc., a camera maker that gets 80 percent of its
sales overseas, fell 3.2 percent to 2,771 yen. TDK Corp., a
Japanese manufacturer of electronic parts that gets more than 25
percent of its revenue from China, declined 3.2 percent to 3,135

today showed the nation’s economic growth slowed less than

percent to 3,855 yen. NTT will buy back as many as 42 million
shares of common stock from Sept. 20 until March 29 “to improve
