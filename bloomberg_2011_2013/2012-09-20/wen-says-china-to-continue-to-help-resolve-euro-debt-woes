China  has moved foreign-exchange
reserves into Europe and will continue to “play its part” in
tackling the euro-area debt crisis, Chinese Premier  Wen Jiabao 
said.  “China has continued to invest in the bonds of European
governments and those of the EFSF, and actively discussed ways
of cooperation with the ESM,” Wen said through a translator at
a European-Chinese business conference in Brussels today. “As a
responsible long-term investor, China has pursued greater
diversification in its investment and Europe has been one of the
major markets for China’s foreign-exchange reserves investment.
China will continue to play its part in helping resolve the
European debt issue through appropriate channels.”  Wen also called on the international community to give
“stronger support to efforts made by  Europe .” In turn, he said
European countries must “stick together in times of
difficulty” and send a “clear message” about their commitment
to safeguard the euro.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
