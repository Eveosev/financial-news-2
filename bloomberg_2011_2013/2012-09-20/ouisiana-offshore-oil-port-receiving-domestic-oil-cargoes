The  Louisiana Offshore Oil Port ,
the largest waterborne petroleum import terminal in the U.S.,
has begun to receive tankers of domestic crude as well.  “We started receiving those in August,” Barb Hestermann,
a Covington, Louisiana-based spokeswoman for the port, said in a
telephone interview. “We are expecting to see those on a
regular basis.”  The port can accept 1.2 million barrels a day of oil
through its marine terminal, said Hestermann. LOOP has
traditionally taken delivery of foreign crude from ships and
offshore  Gulf of Mexico  crude by pipeline.  The domestic crude shipments that began last month have
arrived on vessels with capacities typically between 300,000
barrels and 350,000 barrels, Hestermann said.  “We recently made some modifications to our offshore
facilities to be able to handle this smaller-size tanker,” said
Hestermann.  Oil from the Eagle Ford and Bakken shale formations in
 Texas  and the Midwest helped boost U.S. oil production to the
highest level in 13 years in July, according to weekly Energy
Department data.  U.S. light, sweet crude may displace similar imports to the
 Gulf Coast  next year,  Bill Klesse ,  Valero Energy Corp. (VLO) ’s chief
executive officer, said at a conference this month.  Eagle Ford output was about 283,000 barrels a day this
June, up from about 98,000 barrels a day in June 2011 and no
barrels in April 2008, according to the Railroad Commission of
Texas, the state’s oil and gas regulator.  Gulf Imports  About 554,000 barrels a day of light, sweet oil from abroad
arrived in U.S. Gulf Coast ports in June, down from 964,000
barrels a day in June 2011 and about 1.25 million in June 2010,
Energy Department data show.  “We still are seeing foreign imports of sweet barrels”
although the amount has declined, Hestermann said.  The port is connected to onshore storage at Clovelly,
 Louisiana , and the 1.2 million-barrel-a-day Capline pipeline
system that moves oil from St. James, Louisiana, to Patoka,
Illinois.  Four refineries in Louisiana with a combined processing
capacity of about 1.28 million barrels a day can also get oil
from the St. James terminal.  LOOP has eight underground caverns that can store about 58
million barrels of oil and 15 above ground storage tanks with
about 9 million barrels of capacity, Hestermann said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
