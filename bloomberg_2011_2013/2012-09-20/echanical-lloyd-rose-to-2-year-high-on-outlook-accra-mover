Mechanical Lloyd Company Ltd. (MLC) ,
which imports vehicles to  Ghana , rose to the highest in two
years as investors speculate the company increased sales in the
third quarter.  The shares gained 8.3 percent to 13 pesewas as of the close
in the capital, Accra, the highest since Sept. 23, 2010.  “With the stable cedi that we have witnessed for some time
now, investors are expecting that the company to sell more cars
in the third quarter,” Nana Kofi Agyeman, a stock trader at
Merban Stockbrokers Ltd. in Accra, said by phone today. “Cedi
depreciation affects the value of cars and make it more
difficult for people to buy.”  Ghana’s cedi, which weakened in the first seven months of
the year by 16 percent against the dollar, appreciated 1.1
percent in August and is up 0.8 percent this month. It lost 0.5
percent to 1.9175 a dollar as of 2:02 p.m. in Accra.  Profit may increase 33 percent in the nine months through
September on higher sales, Agyeman said. “The electioneering
campaigns will also increase demand for the company’s
vehicles,” he said.  President John Dramani Mahama will seek to win his first
term in office and a second parliamentary majority for the
ruling National Democratic Congress party in the December polls.
Mahama, who replaced President John Atta Mills following his
death in July, faces Nana Akufo-Addo of the main opposition New
Patriotic Party.  Mechanical Lloyd’s profit increased 54 percent to 1.1
million cedis ($570,000) in the first half, said Agyeman.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
