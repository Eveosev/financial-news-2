Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. (BBBY) , the
operator of more than 1,000 home-furnishing stores, dropped 4.4
percent in late trading after it reported second-quarter profit
that trailed analysts’ estimates.  Net income fell 2.2 percent to $224.3 million from $229.4
million a year earlier, the Union, New Jersey-based company said
yesterday in a statement. Profit per share rose to 98 cents from
93 cents a year earlier after the number of shares outstanding
declined. Analysts projected $1.02 a share, the average of 25
estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Bed Bath & Beyond has been resorting to discount coupons to
drive traffic, cutting into profit margins, Brian Nagel, an
analyst at Oppenheimer & Co. in New York, wrote in a Sept. 18
note. The company’s long-term growth prospects look better as
the U.S. housing market picks up, he said.  “For at least the next few quarters we view the potential
for outsized sales and earnings at the chain as limited,” Nagel
wrote. He rates the shares market perform, the equivalent of a
hold.  The shares fell to $65.75 at 7:59 p.m.  New York  time
yesterday in late trading. Bed Bath & Beyond had gained 19
percent through the close of regular trading.  Total revenue rose 12 percent to $2.59 billion. Comparable-
store sales rose 3.5 percent in the quarter, trailing the
average estimate of 3.8 percent in a Bloomberg survey of six
analysts.  Profit Forecast  Bed Bath & Beyond said third-quarter profit may be 99 cents
to $1.04 per share. The average of 25 analysts’ estimates
compiled by Bloomberg is $1.03 a share.  Chief Executive Officer Steven Temares acquired furniture,
food and gifts chain Cost Plus in July for about $495 million,
adding 259 stores and a new e-commerce platform, to combat
competition from Amazon.com Inc. and  Target Corp. (TGT)  Bed Bath &
Beyond also will be able to integrate Cost Plus’s specialty-food
offerings in its stores to boost traffic, Charles Allen, a
Bloomberg Industries analyst, said in May.  The acquisition should add to earnings in the current
fiscal year, the company said in a May 9 statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
