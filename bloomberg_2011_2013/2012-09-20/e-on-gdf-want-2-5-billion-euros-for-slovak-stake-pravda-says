E.ON Ruhrgas AG and  GDF Suez (GSZ)  are
asking 2.5 billion euros ($3.2 billion) for a 49 percent stake
in  Slovakia â€™s largest gas company,  Pravda  reported without
saying where it got the information.  The German and French utilities are in talks with
Energeticky a Prumyslovy Holding AS, a Czech private-equity
firm, about the sale of the stake, the newspaper said. The
Slovak government is also considering whether to buy back the
stake, which it sold in 2002, Pravda said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
