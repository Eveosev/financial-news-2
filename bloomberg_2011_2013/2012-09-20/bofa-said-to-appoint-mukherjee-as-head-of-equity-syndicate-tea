Bank of America Corp. , the second-
biggest  U.S. bank  by assets, named Sumit Mukherjee to replace
Anne Walker as head of the firm’s U.S. equity syndicate team,
said two people with knowledge of the move.  Mukherjee, 33, who’s held half a dozen positions in the
bank and Merrill Lynch & Co. since 2001, most recently was a 
director  in the equity capital markets division catering to
corporate clients, said the people, who asked not to be
identified because the appointment hasn’t been made public.  Mukherjee will direct a team of about a dozen bankers
coordinating the marketing, pricing and distribution of shares
for every U.S. initial public offering the company manages, the
people said. The firm’s global banking unit posted a 27 percent
decline in second-quarter profit to $1.41 billion amid slowing
investment-banking revenue.  Walker, who joined Merrill Lynch about 14 years ago, was
named strategy chief of  Charlotte , North Carolina-based Bank of
America after Thong Nguyen was moved to a senior retail
position. The lender purchased Merrill Lynch in 2009.  Walker and Mukherjee didn’t return calls and e-mails
seeking comment on their promotions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
