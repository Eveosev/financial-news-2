Ethanol futures fell to an 11-week
low in Chicago on speculation that a drop in corn prices will
ease production costs.  Futures sank as corn tumbled on concern that rain in the
grain-abundant Midwest in August helped quench crops scorched by
drought in June and July, boosting yields. Ethanol is made from
corn in the U.S.  “There are certain farmers that are finding out their
yields are coming out better than anticipated,” said  Dan Flynn ,
a trader at Price Futures Group in Chicago.  Denatured ethanol for October delivery fell 3.5 cents, or
1.5 percent, to $2.247 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade,
the lowest level since June 29. Futures have gained 2 percent
this year.  In cash market trading, ethanol in  New York  sank 7 cents,
or 3 percent, to $2.29 a gallon and in Chicago the biofuel
decreased 5.5 cents, or 2.4 percent, to $2.225, data compiled by
Bloomberg shows.  Ethanol in the U.S. Gulf declined 5.5 cents, or 2.4
percent, to $2.285 a gallon and on the West Coast the additive
was unchanged at $2.39.  Corn for December delivery dropped 10.5 cents, or 1.4
percent, to $7.46 a bushel in Chicago. One bushel makes at least
2.75 gallons of ethanol.  Valero Energy Corp. (VLO) , the third-largest U.S. ethanol
producer, said yesterday that it restarted plants in Albion,
 Nebraska , and Linden,  Indiana , this month as the corn harvest
gets under way and margins improve.  Gasoline for October delivery surged 7.54 cents, or 2.7
percent, to $2.904 a gallon on the Nymex. The contract covers
reformulated gasoline, which is made to be blended with ethanol
before delivery to filling stations.  The gain in gasoline expanded its  premium  to ethanol to
65.7 cents, the highest since June 15, from 54.7 yesterday,
making the biofuel more attractive to blend for refiners, which
stand to pocket the difference between the two.  To contact the reporter on this story:
