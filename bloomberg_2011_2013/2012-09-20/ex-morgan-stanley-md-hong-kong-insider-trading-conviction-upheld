Hong Kong’s Court of Appeal upheld
insider-dealing convictions against former  Morgan Stanley (MS) 
managing director Du Jun while reducing his fine and prison
term, according to the city’s Securities and Futures Commission.  The appeal court lowered Du’s fine to HK$1.7 million
($219,000) from HK$23.3 million, and his jail term to six years
from seven, the SFC said in a  statement  on its website
yesterday. His lawyer argued before the appeal court in April
that Du’s sentence was too heavy in comparison with those given
to professionals convicted of similar crimes.  Du had been serving the longest jail sentence for the
offense since the former British colony criminalized  insider
trading  in 2003. District Court Judge Andrew Chan in 2009 found
Du guilty of nine counts of the offense and one count of
advising his wife to trade Hong Kong-listed  Citic Resources
Holdings Ltd. (1205) , a Chinese oil and coal producer, in 2007.  Du’s offenses occurred while he was a part of a team of
Morgan Stanley bankers advising Citic Resources on acquiring
oil-field assets in  China , the commission said.  The fine was reduced by the appeal court to take into
account civil proceedings by the SFC against Du that aim to
recoup losses incurred by his trading counterparties, the
commission said yesterday.  Du worked for Morgan Stanley in Hong Kong from 2001 until
May 2007, when he was fired. He returned to Hong Kong from
Beijing in 2008 after HK$46.5 million of his assets in the city
were frozen by the SFC.  He was arrested at the airport on his return. Du had
borrowed HK$50 million in margin financing from Morgan Stanley
for his transactions, more than double his 2006 basic salary and
bonus of HK$19 million, prosecutors said.  The case was  Hong Kong  SAR v. Du Jun, CACC334/2009 in the
Hong Kong Court of Appeal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
