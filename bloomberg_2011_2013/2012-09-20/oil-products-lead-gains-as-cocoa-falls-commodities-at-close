The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot
Index of 24  raw materials  rose 0.2 percent to 658.35 in  New
York , the first gain in four days. Gasoline, heating oil and
natural gas lead the gains while coffee posted the biggest
decline.  The UBS Bloomberg CMCI gauge of 26  prices  fell 0.4 percent
to 1,612.87, the fourth straight drop.  OIL PRODUCTS  Gasoline rose for the first time in four days as
inventories of the motor fuel on the East Coast shrank to a
four-year low and imports declined, according to Energy
Department data.  Nymex October gasoline gained 7.54 cents to settle at
$2.904 a gallon, after falling 6.2 percent the prior three days.  Heating oil for October delivery rose 5.35 cents, or 1.8
percent, to $3.0975 a gallon on the exchange, after declining 6
percent the first three days of the week.  CRUDE OIL  Oil was little changed as gasoline and heating oil futures
climbed while more Americans than forecast applied for
 unemployment benefits .  Gasoline rose on falling East Coast supplies. The Labor
Department said jobless claims reached 382,000 last week, more
than the 375,000 forecast by economists polled by Bloomberg. Oil
slumped yesterday after the Energy Department reported crude
stockpiles surged 8.53 million barrels.  Oil for October delivery fell 11 cents to settle at $91.87
a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , extending the
weekly loss to 7.2 percent. It was the fourth consecutive
decline. The contract expired today. The more-active November
futures rose 12 cents to $92.42.  Brent oil for November settlement rose $1.74, or 1.6
percent, to $109.93 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures
Europe exchange. The front-month European benchmark grade’s
premium to the corresponding West Texas Intermediate contract
widened for the first time in six days.  NATURAL GAS  Natural-gas futures advanced in New York for the first time
in six days after a government report showed a below-average
inventory increase.  Natural gas for October delivery gained 3.5 cents, or 1.3
percent, to $2.797 per million British thermal units on the
Nymex. The futures have declined 6.4 percent this year.  SOFT COMMODITIES  Cocoa futures in New York fell to a three-week low as
forecasts for rains eased crop concerns in  Ivory Coast  and
 Ghana , the world’s biggest growers. Coffee fell by the most in
eight weeks and cotton fell the most in a week.  Cocoa for December delivery fell 0.7 percent to close at
$2,519 a metric ton on ICE Futures U.S. in New York, after
touching $2,506, the lowest since Aug. 28.  Arabica-coffee futures for December delivery dropped 3.3
percent to $1.686 a pound on ICE.  Raw-sugar futures for March delivery rose 1.1 percent to
19.91 cents a pound in New York.  ICE cotton for December delivery fell 1.6 percent to close
at 75.22 cents a pound, the biggest drop for a most-active
contract since Sept. 12. Prices fell on signs that the global
economic slowdown is worsening, eroding demand for commodities.  Orange-juice futures for November delivery slid 0.4 percent
at $1.2605 a pound on ICE.  GRAINS, OILSEEDS  Wheat fell for the third time in four days as signs of
slowing economic growth in  China  escalated concern that global
demand may slow for commodities, including grain.  Soybean and corn futures fell on speculation that Midwest
rain during August limited crop damage caused by severe drought
in June and July in the U.S., the world’s biggest producer of
the commodities.  Wheat futures for December delivery fell 0.2 percent to
settle at $8.795 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade.  CBOT soybean futures for November delivery fell 3 percent
to close at $16.1875 a bushel. Earlier, the price touched
$16.16, the lowest for the most-active contract since Aug. 15.
This week, the oilseed has dropped 6.9 percent, heading for the
biggest slump in three months. The commodity soared to a record
$17.89 on Sept. 4.  Corn futures for December delivery declined 1.4 percent to
$7.46 a bushel. The price has dropped 12 percent from a record
$8.49 on Aug. 10.  PRECIOUS METALS  Gold futures fell as the dollar headed for the biggest gain
in seven weeks against a basket of major currencies, eroding
demand for the metal as an alternative investment.  Gold futures for December delivery fell 0.1 percent to
settle at $1,770.20 an ounce on the Comex in New York. The price
is little changed this week.  Silver futures for December delivery climbed 0.3 percent to
$34.682 an ounce on the Comex.  Nymex platinum futures for October delivery fell 1 percent
to $1,623.90 an ounce.  Palladium futures for December delivery fell 1.8 percent to
$661.10 an ounce on the Nymex.  BASE METALS  Copper futures fell the most in seven weeks as declines in
Chinese manufacturing and Japanese exports spurred concern that
a sagging global economy will curb metal demand.  Copper futures for December delivery dropped 1.4 percent to
settle at $3.759 a pound on the Comex, the biggest decline for a
most-active contract since Aug. 2. The metal jumped 11 percent
in the two weeks ended Sept. 14 as central banks expanded
economic stimulus.  On the London Metal Exchange, copper for delivery in three
months fell 1 percent to $8,270 a metric ton ($3.75 a pound).  Zinc, aluminum, lead and tin also dropped, while nickel
rose.  LIVESTOCK  Hog futures fell from a two-week high on signs of
increasing supplies of pork in the U.S. and easing demand.
Cattle also dropped.  The  U.S. Department of Agriculture  will release monthly
cold-storage data tomorrow, and pork inventory may be high,
“challenging” the market, said Lawrence Kane, a market adviser
at Stewart-Peterson Group in  Yates City ,  Illinois . Meatpackers
slaughtered 1.31 million hogs in the first three days of this
week, up 2.4 percent from a year earlier, government data show.  Hog futures for December settlement fell 0.7 percent to
close at 74.2 cents a pound on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
Earlier, the price reached 75.175 cents, the highest for a most-
active contract since Sept. 5.  Cattle futures for December delivery dropped 0.7 percent to
$1.2815 a pound. The price has climbed 5.5 percent this year.  Feeder-cattle futures for October settlement slipped 0.2
