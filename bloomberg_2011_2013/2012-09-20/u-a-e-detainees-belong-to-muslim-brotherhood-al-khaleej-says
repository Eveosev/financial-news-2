Sixty detainees in the  United Arab
Emirates  confessed that they belonged to the Muslim Brotherhood
and had received money from external groups to overthrow the
government and install Islamic rule,  Al Khaleej  reported.  The detainees, who had ties to Muslim Brotherhood movements
in at least three Persian Gulf countries, will soon be referred
to a special court for trial, the Sharjah-based newspaper said,
citing unnamed people close to the investigation. They had
worked in an organized manner, with an armed wing and offices in
each of the seven emirates making up the U.A.E., according to Al
Khaleej.  The group, which had money and investments, also recently
received 10 million dirhams ($2.7 million) from the Muslim
Brotherhood in another Gulf country, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
