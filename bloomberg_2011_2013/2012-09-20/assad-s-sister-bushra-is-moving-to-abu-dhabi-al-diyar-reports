Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s
sister has decided to move to Abu Dhabi because of the dangerous
situation in her country, Lebanon’s pro- Syria   al-Diyar  newspaper
said today.  Bushra al-Assad, whose husband Assef Shawkat was killed in
a July explosion, wants her children to pursue their education
in Abu Dhabi in a “secure atmosphere,” the newspaper reported,
without saying where it got the information. Shawkat, who was
Syria’s deputy defense minister, was one of four top security
officials who died in the explosion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
