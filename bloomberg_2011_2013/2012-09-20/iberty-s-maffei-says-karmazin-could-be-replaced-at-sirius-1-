Sirius XM Radio Inc. (SIRI)  doesn’t need
Mel Karmazin to succeed, said Liberty Media Corp. Chief
Executive Officer Greg Maffei, addressing speculation his
company seeks the ouster of the satellite-radio carrier’s CEO.  While Karmazin has done a “great” job running Sirius,
plenty of people could replace him, Maffei said today at a
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. conference in  New York . Karmazin, whose
contract ends Dec. 31, said Sept. 12 his instincts told him
Liberty didn’t need him at Sirius.  Liberty, which according to Maffei holds about 49.6 percent
of Sirius shares, has informed the Federal Communications
Commission it intends to take control of the company. Liberty
Chairman  John Malone  said in July he plans to spin off the stake
in New York-based Sirius, a move Karmazin said might increase
his interest in staying.  It’s unclear whether Karmazin wants to lead Sirius, which
has gained 37 percent this year in New York trading through
yesterday, under Liberty’s management, Maffei said.  Karmazin, who received $10.7 million in salary and bonus
last year according to data compiled by Bloomberg, said this
month that Liberty may not want to retain him because he’s
“expensive.”  Patrick Reilly , a Sirius spokesman, didn’t immediately
return a phone message today.  Liberty, based in Englewood,  Colorado , probably won’t
increase its stake in Sirius past 50 percent until it wins
approval from the FCC, Maffei said later in an interview.  Sirius  rose  3.2 percent to $2.57 at the close in New York.
Liberty climbed 1.7 percent to $104.14.  To contact the reporter on this story:
