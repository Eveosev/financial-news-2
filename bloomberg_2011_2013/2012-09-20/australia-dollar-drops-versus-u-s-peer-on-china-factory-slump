The Australian dollar fell against
its U.S. peer after Chinese manufacturing declined for an 11th
month, clouding the prospects for the nation’s resource exports.  The Aussie dropped against the majority of its 16 most-
traded counterparts as euro-area services and manufacturing
output fell to a 39-month low in September. The  New Zealand
dollar  advanced versus its U.S. peer as the country’s economic
growth slowed less than forecast last quarter amid stronger farm
output and construction.  “The direction of the news flow is once again turning
negative,”  Samarjit Shankar , a managing director for the
foreign-exchange group in Boston at Bank of  New York  Mellon,
said in a telephone interview. “The main drivers remain in
place with  risk aversion  in market participants coming back to
reality after the injection of liquidity from the  Federal
Reserve .”  Australia’s currency depreciated 0.4 percent to $1.0436
yesterday in New York after earlier falling as much as 1.1
percent, its biggest decline since July 23. It decreased 0.6
percent to 81.66 yen.  New Zealand’s dollar, nicknamed the kiwi, rose 0.3 percent
versus the greenback to 82.91 U.S. cents after earlier falling
as much as 0.7 percent. The kiwi gained 0.1 percent to 64.87
yen.  The Aussie dropped as a preliminary reading of a Chinese
 manufacturing survey  was 47.8 for a China purchasing managers’
index yesterday by HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics,
compared with a final level of 47.6 last month. A reading above
50 indicates expansion.  The kiwi rose against all of its major counterparts as
gross domestic product increased 0.6 percent last quarter,
exceeding the central bank’s 0.4 percent projection.  New Zealand ’s dollar has strengthened 4.3 percent this
year, the biggest increase among the 10 developed-nation
currencies on the Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The
Aussie has fallen 0.5 percent and the greenback is down 2.9
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
