A patent dispute between Actavis
Group HF and Paris-based  Sanofi (SAN)  over a drug to treat diabetes
and hypertension was referred to a European Union court by a
London judge.  Actavis, owned by Iceland-based private equity firm Novator
EHF, wants to sell a generic version of Sanofi’s Aprovel
treatment, according to a written ruling by Judge Richard Arnold
today. Aprovel, also sold as Avapro, generated 1.3 billion euros
($1.7 billion) in sales in 2011, according to Sanofi’s annual
report.  Sanofi and the drug’s distributor Sanofi Pharma Bristol-
Myers Squibb SNC argue that, although Aprovel’s patent expired,
their right to exclusively sell the product is covered by a
supplementary protection certificate.  The issue is unclear and should be referred to the  European
Court  of Justice, Arnold said.  The referral to the European court to determine the meaning
of rules covering supplementary protection certificates will be
made shortly, Sanofi spokeswoman Marisol Peron said in an e-
mail.  Actavis spokesman Frank Staud said in an e-mail the
certificate was invalid and the company sought to have it
revoked by the European court.  “Actavis is confident” the court will decide in its
favor, he said.  The case is: Actavis Group PTC EHF & Anr v. Sanofi-Aventis,
 High Court  of Justice,  Chancery Division , HC12C02525.  To contact the reporter on this story:
