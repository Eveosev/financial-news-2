Secretary of State  Hillary Clinton 
has added her support to the Pentagon’s efforts to win a final
year of congressional funding for development of an air-defense
system being developed by companies led by  Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT)   Providing one more installment of funds before canceling
the Medium Extended Air Defense System, or MEADS, “would signal
the U.S. commitment to working with allies to cooperatively
develop capabilities required for the challenges” facing the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization, Clinton said in a letter
dated yesterday to Senator Daniel Inouye, the Hawaii Democrat
who heads the Senate Defense Appropriations subcommittee.  Congressional critics say the system, designed to intercept
medium-range ballistic missiles, cruise missiles and drones, has
been plagued by cost overruns and performance failures. While
Inouye’s panel and the full Senate Appropriations Committee have
backed a final $380 million for the system, the three other
defense panels that authorize and appropriate defense dollars
denied the funding.  Development of MEADS is managed from Orlando, Florida, by
MEADS International Inc., a joint venture of Lockheed Martin,
based in Bethesda, Maryland; Lfk-Lenkflugkoerpersysteme GmbH,
based in Schrobenhausen, Germany; and MBDA, based in Valenton,
France. MBDA is jointly owned by  BAE Systems Plc (BA/) , European
Aeronautic Defence and Space Co. and  Finmeccanica SpA. (FNC)   To contact the reporter on this story:
