Fishers, farmers, hunters and
loggers faced the greatest risk of workplace death in the U.S.
last year, even as the number of fatalities in that group
declined, federal records show.  There were 557 fatalities in the agriculture, forestry,
fishing and hunting industries last year, down 10 percent from
621 deaths in 2010, according to  preliminary data  released today
by the  U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics . That’s 24.4 deaths for
every 100,000 full-time workers in the group, compared with 3.5
deaths for all categories.  “Fishing is inherently dangerous but it’s still important
to look at the several ways to make it safer,” Matt Rand, a
senior director at the New York-based Environmental Defense
Fund, wrote on the  group’s blog . “Inspections, the use of
safety gear and training all make a difference.”  A total of 4,609 fatal work injuries were recorded in 2011,
down from 4,690 in 2010, according to the report. The rate of
fatalities on the job declined in 2011 from 3.6 deaths per
100,000 full-time workers in 2010.  A total of 780 workers were killed as a result of violence
in 2011, including 458 homicides and 242 suicides. Almost 80
percent of all homicides were a result of shootings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
