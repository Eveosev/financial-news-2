(Corrects to remove euro reference in headline.)  Banks would have had a shortfall in
their capital levels of about $512 billion at the end of 2011,
had so-called Basel III bank rules been in effect, the  Basel
Committee on Banking Supervision  said in an e-mailed statement
today.  The Basel III rules are scheduled to fully apply in 2019.  To contact the reporter on this story:
