The Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries will reduce crude exports into next month as
refiners start maintenance, according to Oil Movements.  OPEC, which accounts for about 40 percent of global oil
supply, will export 23.66 million barrels a day in the four
weeks to Oct. 6, down 0.7 percent from 23.83 million a month
earlier, the tanker-tracker said today in its weekly e-mailed
report. The data exclude  Angola  and  Ecuador .  “It’s the end of summer and the beginning of the
maintenance season,”  Roy Mason , the researcher’s founder, said
by telephone from Halifax,  England . “The west enters first, the
east next. By December, shipments are on their way back up
again.”  Refiners often start repairs at this time of year as
gasoline consumption slows after the peak summer driving season
and before heating oil demand rises.  Exports from the Middle East, including non-OPEC members
Oman and Yemen, will decrease by 1.1 percent to 17.27 million
barrels a day in the four-week period, the report showed.  Crude on board tankers will average 471.82 million barrels,
down 2.5 percent from 483.69 million in the previous period, the
researcher said. Oil Movements calculates the volumes by
tallying tanker-rental agreements. Its figures exclude oil held
on board vessels as floating storage.  OPEC comprises Algeria, Angola, Ecuador, Iran, Iraq,
Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar,  Saudi Arabia , the United Arab
Emirates and Venezuela. The group plans to meet next on Dec. 12.  To contact the reporter on this story:
