Nigeria , Africaâ€™s largest oil
producer, plans to increase Agbami crude exports for November to
eight cargoes, one more than October, according to a loading
program obtained by  Bloomberg News .  Shipments of the grade will advance by 18 percent to
260,000 barrels a day. Each shipment is of 975,000 barrels.  The nation will also ship two consignments of Okwori, each
of 650,000 barrels, a separate loading program showed.  Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude shipments
compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan
their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
