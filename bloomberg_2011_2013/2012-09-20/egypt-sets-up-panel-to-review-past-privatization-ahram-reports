Egyptâ€™s cabinet has formed a
committee to review the sale of 185 public companies under the
regime of ousted President  Hosni Mubarak , the state-run
newspaper al-Ahram reported today.  The panel comes in response to a request from financial
prosecutors for the government to investigate the privatizations
after authorities found there were several conflicting methods
used in monitoring the sales of these companies, according to
the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
