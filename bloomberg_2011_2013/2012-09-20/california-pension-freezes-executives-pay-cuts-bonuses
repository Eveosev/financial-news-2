The  California Public Employees’
Retirement System , the largest pension in the U.S., reduced
bonuses 12 percent for investment officers after stocks dragged
down returns. Most also went without pay raises.  The pension distributed $3.6 million in performance bonuses
among 55 investment officers, down from $4.1 million last year,
according to Calpers data. The sums are based on  investment 
results over three years, including a 1 percent return last year
and 21.7 percent a year earlier. Chief Investment Officer  Joe Dear  was granted $87,750.  “The performance awards are based on multiple years of
performance and we are a long-term investor, and that’s what we
are trying to incentivize,” said  Brad Pacheco , a Calpers
spokesman. “For us to keep highly skilled investment managers
to run this fund, we have to be competitive and these awards are
part of that compensation.”  Volatility in  capital markets  has caused swings in the
$244.5 billion pension fund’s returns while it assumes it will
earn 7.5 percent annually to meet projected obligations. When it
underperforms, the state and its municipalities must make up the
difference. Calpers has earned 7.7 percent over the last 20
years.  The average  Wall Street  bonus fell 13 percent to $121,150
in 2011, the lowest since 2008, and down almost 40 percent from
a peak of $191,360 in 2006, according to estimates by  New York 
state Comptroller  Thomas DiNapoli  in February.  Beat Benchmarks  “The one-year shortfall is within the expected range of
returns for a portfolio like Calpers,” Dear said in a
statement. “The incentive payments are based on three-year
performance of 10.6 percent. Global equity and  fixed income ,
comprising 70 percent of the portfolio, beat their three-year
benchmarks, adding $1.6 billion of value, so it is appropriate
to compensate the portfolio managers for their success.”  The biggest bonus went to Arnie Phillips, a senior fixed-
income portfolio manager, who was awarded $152,608, Pacheco
said.  Calpers spends $40 million a year on compensation and
benefits for investment staff, compared with $44 million for
consultants and $1 billion on external managers. Using internal
management saves an estimated $114 million annually that would
have been paid to  Wall Street  in fees, Pacheco said.  Calpers froze wages this year for its executive staff and
all but 11 of the investment officers. Rank-and-file employees
still received merit raises.  “Now is not the time to be granting raises, given the
current fiscal challenges facing our state and local
governments,” Pacheco said.  Dear earned $522,594 in calendar year 2011 including bonus,
according to data provided by the state’s controller. He’s one
of 174 employees from the fund who were paid more than $100,000
last year. The pension system paid out a total of $167 million
in wages, the controller’s data shows.  To contact the reporter on this story:
