Taiwan ’s 10-year bonds advanced for
a third day, pushing the yield to a one-week low, as concern the
island’s economy is slowing spurred demand for safer assets. The
local dollar weakened.  Orders from abroad for Taiwanese goods dropped 1.5 percent
in August from a year earlier, declining for a sixth month,
official data showed today. The central bank will hold its
 benchmark   interest rate  at 1.875 percent today, according to 17
of 19 economists surveyed by Bloomberg. One predicted a 12.5
basis point cut and one forecast a 25 basis point reduction.
 Consumer prices  rose 3.42 percent last month from a year earlier,
the most in four years, government data show.  “Inflation in recent months was exceptionally high and
that limits the central bank’s policy room,” said Eric Hsing, a
fixed-income trader at First Securities Inc. in Taipei. “Prices
should stabilize soon, and yields should be able to drop as much
as five basis points in the next two months.”  The yield on Taiwan’s 1.125 percent notes due September
2022 dropped two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to
1.187 percent, according to Gretai Securities Market. That’s the
lowest level since Sept. 10. Benchmark 10-year yields touched
1.128 percent on July 25, the lowest level since Bloomberg
started tracking data in 2002.  The Ministry of Finance sold NT$35 billion ($1.2 billion)
of 10-year notes at 1.187 percent yesterday, lower than the 1.20
percent estimated by traders in a Bloomberg survey.  The  Taiwan dollar  fell 0.4 percent to NT$29.508 against its
U.S. counterpart, according to Taipei Forex Inc. The  overnight
money-market rate  held at 0.387 percent, a weighted average
compiled by the Taiwan Interbank Money Center shows.  -- Editors: Anil Varma, Simon Harvey  To contact the reporter on this story:
