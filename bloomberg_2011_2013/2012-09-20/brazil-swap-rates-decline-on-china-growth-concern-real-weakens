Brazil ’s swap rates dropped for the
first time in five days as concern that growth is slowing in
 China  overshadowed data showing the South American nation’s
consumer prices rose more than forecast.  Traders increased bets borrowing costs will stay low after
a report indicated that manufacturing in China, Brazil’s biggest
trading partner, will contract for an 11th straight month. The
IPCA-15 index showed consumer prices rose 0.48 percent in the
month through mid-September, faster than the 0.46 percent median
estimate of 41 economists surveyed by Bloomberg and up from 0.39
percent in the prior period.  “China is worrying because it’s the engine of the world
and our exports depend on it,” Eduardo Galasini, the head of
treasury at Banco Banif in  Sao Paulo , said in a telephone
interview. “The inflation figure was bad, but today the most
important data is Chinese manufacturing.”  Swap rates on the contract due in January 2014 decreased
three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 7.81 percent at
1:46 p.m. in Sao Paulo. The real was little changed at 2.0239
per  U.S. dollar .  Swap rates dropped after climbing yesterday to the highest
level this month as the Getulio Vargas Foundation’s second
preview of IGP-M inflation for September showed that the index
of producer, consumer and construction costs increased more than
forecast.  The central bank has cut Brazil’s benchmark lending rate by
500 basis points since August 2011 to a record low 7.5 percent.
Most traders are betting the easing has come to a close and that
policy makers will begin raising the Selic early next year.  Economic View  A weaker global economy may help tame inflation in Brazil
and limit the need for policy makers to raise  interest rates 
next year, Galasini said.  “With this  risk aversion  abroad, the rates may not need to
rise so much,” he said.  Euro-area services and manufacturing output fell to a 39-
month low in September, and  Japan ’s exports slid for a third
month in August, reports showed.  Brazil’s Treasury sold 4.6 billion reais ($2.3 billion) of
zero-coupon bonds due in 2013, 2014 and 2016 today, placing all
of the 5.8 million notes offered, according to a statement on
the Treasury’s website. The government also sold 219 million
reais of fixed-rate bonds maturing in 2018 and 2023. Of 300,000
notes offered, 210,000 were sold.  To contact the reporters on this story:
