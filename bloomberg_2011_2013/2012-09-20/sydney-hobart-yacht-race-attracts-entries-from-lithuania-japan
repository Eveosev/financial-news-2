A yacht from  Lithuania  entered the
Sydney to Hobart sailing race for the first time, while  Japan 
will be represented after a 15-year absence, organizers said.  Ambersail, a 60-foot craft that will have an all-Lithuanian
crew and be skippered by Simonas Steponavicius, is among the 30
entries received so far for the 68th edition ahead of the Nov. 1
closing date, the Cruising Yacht Club of Australia said today.  “This is a legendary yacht race,” Steponavicius said in
an e-mailed statement. “We decided that this was the year to
leave the beaten track of the Europe-Caribbean circle and head
down under.”  The CYCA said it expects a fleet of about 90 yachts to make
the start line on Dec. 26 in Sydney Harbour. The 628-nautical-
mile (1,163-kilometer) race takes competitors down  Australia ’s
southeast coast and across Bass Strait to the island state of
Tasmania.  Bangal7, owned by Yoshihiko Murase, will be the first
Japanese entry in the race since Summer Boy crossed the finish
line in 18th place in 1997, the CYCA said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
