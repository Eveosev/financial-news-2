George Soros ’s Soros Fund
Management LLC is in talks to hire Highbridge Capital Management
LLC’s Chief Risk Officer Subu Venkataraman, according to two
people with knowledge of the matter.  Venkataraman would assume the same role at Soros’s $23
billion family office, said the people, asking not to be named
because the talks are private. Venkataraman didn’t return calls
at his home yesterday seeking comment.  Venkataraman is leaving Highbridge at the end of December
after nine years with the New York-based investment firm,
according to another person familiar with the matter. He will be
replaced by Jeff Holman, head of quantitative portfolio
construction, who will take over on Oct. 1, the person said.  Representatives of Soros, also based in  New York , and
Highbridge declined to comment.  Venkataraman started his risk-management career in 1995 at
the  Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago  where he was a senior
financial economist, according to his biography on the  website 
of the Professional Risk Managers’ International Association. He
later worked at Morgan Stanley as the global head of risk
monitoring, according to the website.  Highbridge is owned by JPMorgan Asset Management, a unit of
New York-based JPMorgan Chase & Co., and manages more than $28
billion in  hedge funds  and other assets, according to its
 website .  Reuters reported Venkataraman’s planned departure from
Highbridge on Sept. 19.  To contact the reporters on this story:
