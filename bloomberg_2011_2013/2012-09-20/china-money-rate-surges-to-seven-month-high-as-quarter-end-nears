China ’s money-market rate surged to
the highest level in seven months amid speculation banks are
hoarding cash to meet quarter-end regulatory requirements and
holiday withdrawals.  The overnight repurchase rate climbed for a fourth day even
after the People’s Bank of China  injected  a net 101 billion  yuan 
($16 billion) into the financial system this week, ending a
three-week run of withdrawals. The central bank today conducted
55 billion yuan of seven-day and 105 billion yuan of 28-day
reverse-repurchase operations to add funds. China’s financial
markets will be shut for a weeklong break from Oct. 1.  “Cash supply has become quite tight as the holiday and
quarter-end approaches,” said Hu Hangyu, a Beijing-based bond
analyst at Citic Securities Co., the nation’s biggest listed
brokerage. “Even though the central bank has stepped up
injections, it can’t prevent a cash crunch.”  The one-day  repurchase rate , a gauge of interbank funding
availability, climbed 49 basis points to 4.01 percent as of 4:30
p.m. in  Shanghai , according to a weighted average rate compiled
by the National Interbank Funding Center. It earlier touched
4.02 percent, the highest since Feb. 24, and a 58 basis point
jump yesterday was the biggest since June.  The yields on seven- and 28-day reverse repos were kept
unchanged at 3.35 percent and 3.6 percent, respectively,
according to a central bank statement.  The one-year swap contract, the fixed cost needed to
receive the floating seven-day repurchase rate, fell four basis
point to 3.23 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The yield on the 2.95 percent government bond due August
2017 dropped one basis point to 3.29 percent, according to the
Interbank Funding Center. A basis point is 0.01 percentage
point.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
