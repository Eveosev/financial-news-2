Cincinnati Reds manager  Dusty Baker 
will remain hospitalized until at least tomorrow after being
diagnosed with an irregular heartbeat.  Baker, 63, will remain at a Chicago hospital so that
doctors can monitor his progress, Rob Butcher, a spokesman for
the team, said in an e-mail.  Baker, who also has led the Cubs and San Francisco Giants,
managed his 3,000th game two days ago in the Reds’ series-opener
at Chicago.  He left Wrigley Field two hours before yesterday’s game and
it was initially announced he would have X-rays to rule out
pneumonia, according to the  Associated Press .  Bench coach Chris Speier is serving as acting manager for
the Reds, who won last night, raising their record to 90-59.
They can clinch at least a wild-card playoff berth with a
victory this afternoon to sweep the series.  To contact the reporter on this story:
