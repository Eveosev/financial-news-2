Hyundai Motor Co. (005380) ,  South Korea ’s
largest automaker, expects yearly U.S. sales of more than
100,000 of its redesigned Santa Fe sport-utility vehicle,
including a stretched version with three rows of seats.  That sales target exceeds Hyundai’s current Sante Fe sales
by more than 20,000 models, said John Shon, manager of product
planning for the automaker’s U.S. operations. It also would
exceed the combined sales of the Santa Fe and the Hyundai
Veracruz, a 3-row SUV the automaker stopped making in May, Shon
told reporters today at a driving demonstration of the new
model.  Hyundai is seeking to lure U.S. buyers of the Toyota
Highlander, Nissan Pathfinder, Honda Pilot, Ford Explorer and
Edge, and Chevrolet Equinox, Shon said. The two-row version of
the 2013  Santa Fe  went on sale last month, starting at $25,275.
The stretched, 3-row model goes on sale early next year with a
price that will exceed $27,700, Shon said.  “Our sales target is north of 100,000” annual sales, Shon
said. “You saw our sales success of the Sonata. We more than
doubled sales.”  U.S. sales of the Santa Fe, mostly the older version, have
fallen 16 percent this year to 43,583, according to researcher
Autodata Corp. The outgoing design of the Santa Fe has been
averaging 75,000 to 80,000 sales annually, Shon said. The
Veracruz did about 13,000 in yearly U.S. sales, Shon said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
