Sotheby’s has scored two major
consignments ahead of the big November art auctions, with a
 Pablo Picasso  and a  Mark Rothko  that together could sell for as
much as $70 million.  Rothko’s 1954 “No. 1 (Royal Red and Blue)” has been
valued between $35 million and $50 million. It will lead
Sotheby’s evening sale of contemporary art on Nov. 13.  The seller of the Rothko is Anne Marion, owner of Burnett
Cos. in  Fort Worth ,  Texas , according to people with knowledge of
the transaction. Her husband John L. Marion was Sotheby’s
chairman and chief auctioneer. Sotheby’s declined to confirm the
seller of the work except to say that the painting is held in a
family trust.  The Rothko, almost 9.5 feet tall and 5.5 feet wide, was one
of eight pieces selected by the artist for his solo exhibition
at the Art Institute of Chicago in 1954. It has been exhibited
in many museums, including the National Gallery of Art in
 Washington , the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York and
the  Musee d’Art Moderne  in Paris.  In 1978, the painting was purchased by Ben Heller, a major
collector and private dealer of Abstract Expressionism. Sandra
Canning, who acted as an agent for the transaction, said Heller
paid $325,000.  “I would call it a very good Rothko. I would not call it a
masterpiece,” Heller said in a telephone interview. “It’s an
important, rare work.” He has owned more than a dozen Rothkos,
and gave the Museum of Modern Art its Barnett Newman
masterpiece, “Vir Heroicus Sublimis,” in 1969.  Heller subsequently sold the painting for less than
$500,000, he said.  Price Increase  When asked what he thought about  Sotheby’s (BID)  estimate, he
said, “I bought my first Rothko for $1,350 in the early 1950s.
So the price increase has been astronomical.”  Picasso’s portrait of his lover and muse Marie-Therese
Walter is expected to sell for $15 million to $20 million.
Painted in 1936, “Femme a la fenetre (Marie-Therese)” will be
part of Sotheby’s Impressionist and modern evening sale on Nov.
5.  Picasso held on to the painting until his death in 1973. It
was in the collection of Marina Picasso, the artist’s
granddaughter, and shown in “Picasso and Portraiture,
Representation and Transformation,” a 1996 MoMA exhibition
curated by William Rubin.  Both the Rothko and the Picasso have remained in the same
collections for about 30 years, Sotheby’s said.  To contact the reporters of this story:
