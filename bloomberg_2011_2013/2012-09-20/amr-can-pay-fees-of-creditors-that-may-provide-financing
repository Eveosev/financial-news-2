American Airlines (AAMRQ)  won approval to
move forward with negotiations with a group of creditors,
including  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) , that may provide financing for
the airline’s bankruptcy reorganization.  U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Sean Lane in Manhattan today approved
parent AMR Corp.’s request to pay the fees of the group’s
advisers as negotiations proceed.  Talks with the 12-member group come as the carrier works to
turn around operations after filing for bankruptcy in November.
Fort Worth, Texas-based American says negotiations with the
group are an “integral part” of its effort to restructure and
exit bankruptcy.  Jack Butler , an attorney for AMR’s unsecured creditors
committee, which is separate from the JPMorgan group, told Lane
at today’s hearing that the fee agreement is a “highly
desirable step forward” in the airline’s bankruptcy.  Others are also interested in providing financing, he said.  “The dialogue will go on with others,” Butler said.  Besides JPMorgan, the creditor group includes Claren Road
Asset Management, Cyrus Capital Partners and Pentwater Capital
Management, according to court papers.  The group’s law firm is Milbank, Tweed, Hadley & McCloy
LLP, and its financial adviser is Houlihan Lokey.  The case is In re AMR Corp., 11-15463, U.S. Bankruptcy
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporters on this story:
