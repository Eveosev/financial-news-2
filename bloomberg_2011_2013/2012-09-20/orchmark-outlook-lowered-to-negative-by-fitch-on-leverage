Torchmark Corp., the seller of life
insurance and annuities, had its outlook lowered by  Fitch
Ratings  on increased leverage.  The outlook was cut to negative from stable on the
“increased financial leverage of recent periods and Fitch’s
view that leverage will remain higher than historical levels,”
the ratings firm said today in a statement on the McKinney,
Texas-based insurer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
