Itron Inc. (ITRI) , a maker of energy-
saving meters, was selected by the utility  EON AG (EOAN)  for Hungary’s
largest smart-meter pilot program and said its meters will be
installed as part of Australia’s water-efficiency initiative.  The Liberty Lake, Washington-based company said today that
the Water Corporation of Australia would install 13,000 of its
smart-water meters across the Pilbara region of western
Australia to help detect leaks and spot unusual demand increases
to conserve water.  Itron also said it will supply at least 7,600 smart meters
for business and residential customers across Hungary, expanding
on a gas and electric meter pilot program that’s now underway.
No terms were given for either program.  Itron’s shares have risen 23 percent this year in  New York 
trading compared with a 6.4 percent decline in the 53-member
WilderHill Clean Energy Index over the same period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
