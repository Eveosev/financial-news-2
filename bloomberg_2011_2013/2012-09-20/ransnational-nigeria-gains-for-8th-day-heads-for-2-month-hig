Transnational Corp. of Nigeria Plc ,
which has investments in hotels, agriculture and oil, gained for
the eighth day and reached the highest in two months after it
was shortlisted to buy state-owned power utilities, signaling
further diversification in its group of companies.  The stock gained 5 percent to 1.06 naira at the close in
Lagos,  Nigeria ’s commercial capital. That’s the highest since
July 20.  Transnational,  Julius Berger Nigeria Plc (JBERGER) , and six others
are in the final list of companies to buy five  power plants ,
Abuja-based Bureau of Public Enterprises, Nigeria’s
privatization agency, said yesterday. Nineteen others are
seeking to acquire 10 distribution companies, the agency said.  The Lagos-based company plans to build eight hotels that
trade under the Hilton brand in  Africa ’s most populous country
to take advantage of a surge in business visitors, Chief
Executive Officer Obinna Ufudo said in an interview on May 25.
Transnational is also investing in the processing of fruits,
rice and cassava, he said.  “With the extent of diversification the company has
achieved, I believe they will do well,” Samuel Onukwue, chief
executive officer of Mega Equities Ltd., a brokerage, said by
phone today from Lagos. “Investors see value in it at the price
the stock is trading now.”  Profit for the second quarter through June rose to 939.9
million naira from 547.2 million naira, the company said on July
17.  The stock has risen 86 percent this year, compared with a
25 percent increase in the Nigerian Stock Exchange All-Share
