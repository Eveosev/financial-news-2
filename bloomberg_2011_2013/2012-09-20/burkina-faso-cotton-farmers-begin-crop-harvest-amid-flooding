Farmers in  Burkina Faso ,  Africa ’s
biggest cotton producer, have started harvesting the fiber as
rainfall flooded some growers’ fields, according to the national
producers’ union.  The 300,000 producers in the group planted 585,000 hectares
(1.4 million acres), Karim Traore, president of the
organization, said by phone yesterday from Bobo Dioulasso. About
200 hectares of cotton fields were flooded, he said.  Farmers in Burkina Faso plant cotton, the country’s second-
biggest foreign-currency earner, in May and June. Output is
expected to rise to 532,000 metric tons in the 2012-13 season
from 414,000 tons last year, according to the Interprofessional
Cotton Association, an industry group.  Producers have spent more money this year than in the last
harvest season to manage weeds and insects on their plantations,
Traore said. As much as 60 percent of seeds planted were of the
regular variety, he said.  Farmers were unable to plant as many genetically modified
seeds, which is meant to be resistant to some pests, as last
year after a mix-up, Societe Burkinabe des Fibres Textiles, the
country’s biggest buyer, said in May.  To contact the reporter on this story:
