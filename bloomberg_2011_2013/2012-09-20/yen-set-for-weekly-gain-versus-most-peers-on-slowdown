The euro advanced the most in a
week versus the dollar after a media report said euro-region
policy makers will unveil a financial bailout program for  Spain 
as early as next week.  The shared currency climbed for the first time in four days
against the yen after the Financial Times said Spanish and
European Union officials were working on plans to trigger
European Central Bank bond purchases to boost the Iberian
nation’s economy. The Australian dollar led gains among higher-
yielding currencies after a Federal Reserve policy maker said
the U.S. central bank may hold  interest rates  close to zero
until unemployment falls.  “The euro is up on a report Spain is reaching a compromise
on reforms that will make it easier for them to go ahead with a
bailout,” said  Adam Cole , global head of foreign-exchange
strategy at  Royal Bank of Canada  in  London . “Central bank
liquidity injections are positive for risk generally, it would
also be euro positive.”  The common European currency strengthened 0.4 percent to
$1.3020 at 6:28 a.m.  New York  time, trimming its weekly decline
to 0.8 percent. It appreciated 0.3 percent to 101.82 yen.
 Japan ’s currency was little changed at 78.19 per dollar.  The euro will decline to $1.24 by the end of this year,
according to the median of 50 bank forecasts in a Bloomberg
survey.  Germany ’s business climate index stagnated this month,
according to the median estimate of 27 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg before data is released on Sept. 24.  Last month’s 
reading was the lowest since March 2010.  Industry Drop  A report yesterday showed a composite gauge of services and
manufacturing shrank to a three-year low.  The euro has gained 2.2 percent in the past month, the best
performer among 10 developed-nation currencies tracked by
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The dollar fell 2.6
percent and the yen weakened 1.1 percent.  The so-called Aussie rose at least 0.2 percent against all
but one of its 16 major counterparts after Minneapolis Fed
President  Narayana Kocherlakota  said the central bank should
hold rates at around zero until joblessness drops below 5.5
percent. The rate has been above 8 percent since January 2009.  The Australian currency appreciated 0.7 percent to $1.0507,
after advancing 0.8 percent, the steepest climb in more than a
week. It added 0.7 percent to 82.22 yen.  The pound rose to the highest level in more than a year
against the dollar even as Britain reported its biggest August
budget deficit on record.  The U.K. currency added 0.4 percent to $1.6276, the
strongest level since Aug. 31, 2011. It was little changed at 80
pence per euro.  To contact the reporter on this story:
