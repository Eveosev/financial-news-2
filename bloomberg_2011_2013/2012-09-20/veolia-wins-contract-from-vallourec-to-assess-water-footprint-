Vallourec SA (VK) , a steel pipe producer
for the energy industry, awarded  Veolia Environnement SA (VIE)  a
contract to audit the “water footprint” of its biggest
production plants from France to Brazil and the U.S.  No terms were given for the contract with Veolia Water to
assess seven of Vallourec’s largest plants through a water index
indicator that evaluates their impact on water resources.  Sites to be examined will be Saint-Saulve’s tube and steel
mills and Deville-les-Rouen, also in France; Muelheim and Rath
in Germany; Youngstown, Ohio; and Belo Horizonte, Brazil.  Vallourec, based in Boulogne Billancourt, France, has cut
its water withdrawals by 40 percent a metric ton of tube
produced in 10 years, according to today’s statement. Water “is
essential in the industrial production process of Vallourec,”
it said.  Veolia Environnement  is the biggest water utility.  To contact the reporter on this story:
