Indonesia ’s rupiah fell for a third
day and bonds declined on concern the nation will post a record
current-account deficit this year.  The government expects the shortfall to be at a “safe
level” of below 3 percent of gross domestic product, Finance
Minister  Agus Martowardojo  said last week. Barclays Plc forecast
today the deficit to be at 2.5 percent of GDP this year, which
would be the most since Bloomberg began collecting the data in
1998. The broadest measure of trade widened to a record
shortfall of $6.9 billion in the second quarter, compared with a
deficit of $3.2 billion in the previous three months.  “The fundamentals for the rupiah remain weak,” said
 Prakriti Sofat , an economist at Barclays Plc in Singapore. “The
current account is weighing on investor sentiment.”  The rupiah weakened 0.1 percent to 9,558 per dollar as of
5:19 p.m. in Jakarta, prices from local banks compiled by
Bloomberg show. The currency touched 9,588 earlier, the lowest
level since Sept. 14. One-month implied volatility, which
measures exchange-rate swings used to price options, held at 5
percent.  The yield on the government’s 7 percent securities due May
2022 climbed three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to
5.93 percent, the highest level since Sept. 12, according to
closing prices from the Inter Dealer Market Association.  To contact the reporter on this story:
