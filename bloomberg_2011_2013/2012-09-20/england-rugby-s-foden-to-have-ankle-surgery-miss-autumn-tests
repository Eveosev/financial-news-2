Fullback  Ben Foden  will undergo
ankle surgery and is set to miss England’s autumn
internationals, the Rugby Football Union said on its website.  Foden sustained “severe damage” to ligaments in his right
ankle while playing for Northampton against Bath on Sept. 14 and
will have the surgery in the next few days, the  RFU said . The
27-year-old is expected to be sidelined for 10-12 weeks.  “It is unfortunate for Ben, who has had a good run in the
side and is a valuable leader,” England coach  Stuart Lancaster 
said. “But we have a number of back-three players who are
playing well and this offers a chance for them.”  Lancaster said he was “sure” Foden, who’s made 30
appearances for England, would be available for the start of the
Six Nations championship in February.  England opens its autumn Test  schedule  on Nov. 10 against
Fiji at Twickenham Stadium, followed by games against Australia,
South Africa and world champion New Zealand.  To contact the reporter on this story:
