Sugar prices may need to fall
further to boost consumption, as supplies of the sweetener
remain ample, according to Czarnikow Group Ltd.  World raw sugar production may outpace demand by 7.1
million metric tons in the 2012-13 season, the London-based
company said today in an e-mailed statement. Production may
total 180.6 million tons, down 400,000 tons from a projection in
May, while consumption may be 173 million tons, 900,000 tons
more than previously estimated, according to the report.  Raw sugar futures slid to a two-year low of 18.81 cents a
pound on Sept. 6 on ICE Futures U.S. in  New York , after climbing
16 percent in June and July as rains delayed harvesting in
 Brazil . “Unusually dry” weather in August allowed the harvest
to accelerate, Czarnikow said. The country’s center south, the
main growing region, may crush 525 million tons of cane, with
total sweetener production of 33.5 million tons expected, the
company said.  “We continue to forecast a fourth consecutive year of
rising cane sugar production, a trend not seen since the early
1990s,” Toby Cohen, a director at Czarnikow, said in the
statement. “A production surplus and lower prices should
encourage increased consumption. But consumers may not respond
as quickly as the market would like.”  India  may produce 25.9 million tons of sugar, down from a
previous forecast of 29.2 million tons, Czarnikow said. Output
may be the lowest since the 2009-10 season because of dry
weather. Consumption was pegged at 26.1 million tons, up 1
percent from a year earlier.  Production in the European Union may be 16.9 million tons,
200,000 tons more than estimated in May, because of warmer
weather, Czarnikow said. European exports for the season are
forecast to be 1.4 million tons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
