European Central Bank Governing
Council member  Christian Noyer  said the ECB must have oversight
of all euro-area banks when it takes up its new role as a
supervisor,  Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung  reported, citing an
interview.  The ECB, which is due to take the role from January under a
proposal by the European Commission, “must cover, in any case,
all 6,000 banks within the euro area,” FAZ quoted Noyer as
saying. “It’s better to forget about the entire project if it
only includes the 20 biggest banks.”  Asked whether there might be a conflict of interest between
monetary policy and banking supervision, Noyer, who heads the
Bank of  France , said that “14 out of 17 central banks in the
euro area are also responsible for banking oversight,” FAZ
reported. “ Monetary policy  is separated from banking
supervision by Chinese walls.”  With regard to the ECB’s new bond-buying program, Noyer
said it will be “up to elected governments and the IMF” to say
whether or not countries under the program “fulfill
conditionality,” according to FAZ. “We will not hesitate to
stop the bond purchases right away if a country doesn’t adhere
to the conditions under the ESM.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
