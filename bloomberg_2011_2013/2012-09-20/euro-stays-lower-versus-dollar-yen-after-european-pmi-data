The euro maintained losses versus
the dollar and the yen after a report showed a composite index
of services and manufacturing in the region shrank more than
economists estimated this month.  The euro fell 0.6 percent to $1.2976 at 9:17 a.m. London
time after weakening as much as 0.8 percent. The shared currency
dropped 0.7 percent to 101.53 yen.  A gauge based on a survey of purchasing managers declined
to 45.9 from 46.3 in August, London-based Markit Economics said.
The median forecast in a survey of economists was for an
improvement to 46.6. A reading below 50 indicates contraction.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
