Wheat fell for the third time in
four days as signs of slowing economic growth in  China  escalated
concern that global demand may slow for commodities, including
grain.  Manufacturing in China is falling in September and headed
for an 11th straight contraction, according to a purchasing
managers’ index released by HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit
Economics. The preliminary reading, if confirmed, would mark the
longest stretch of contraction in the survey’s eight-year
history. Fifteen of the 24 commodities tracked by the Standard &
Poor’ GSCI Spot Index were lower today. Wheat prices are down
4.8 percent this week.  “The Chinese manufacturing numbers are not good,” Darrell Holaday, the president of Advanced Market Concepts in Wamego,
 Kansas , said by telephone. “There’s more and more talk hard
landing for China.”  Wheat futures for December delivery fell 0.2 percent to
settle at $8.795 a bushel at 2 p.m. on the Chicago Board of
Trade. The price has slumped this week partly on speculation
that demand will decline.  Wheat is the fourth-largest U.S. crop, valued at $14.4
billion in 2011, behind corn, soybeans and hay, government data
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
