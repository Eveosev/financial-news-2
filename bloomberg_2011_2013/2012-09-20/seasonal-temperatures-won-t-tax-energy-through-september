After cooler air passes across the
Midwest this weekend, most of the U.S. will have seasonal
temperatures that won’t tax energy demand for heating or cooling
through the end of the month.  Seasonal weather is expected to dominate most of the
Midwest, the South and the East Coast from Sept. 25 to Oct. 4,
according to  Matt Rogers , president of the Commodity Weather
Group LLC in Bethesda,  Maryland .  “The majority of models show a very demand-neutral
pattern,” Rogers wrote in a note to clients. “This works
against both late-season Southern cooling demand and early-
season Northern heating demand.”  Temperature fluctuations outside normal levels have little
impact on energy markets at this time of year. Energy traders
and meteorologists use a base of 65 degrees Fahrenheit (18
Celsius) as the benchmark for when people won’t need heating or
air conditioning to remain comfortable.  The normal average temperature in New York on Sept. 27 is
65, according to  MDA EarthSat Weather  in Gaithersburg, Maryland.
It’s 61 in  Boston , 67 in  Washington , 70 in Atlanta, 62 in
Chicago, 76 in Houston, 59 in Seattle and 71 in Burbank,
California.  To contact the reporter on this story:
