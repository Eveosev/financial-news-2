A 471-page U.S. report that says
flaws plagued a federal gun operation indicates a “breach of
public trust” by senior Justice Department officials, House
Oversight and Government Reform Committee Chairman  Darrell Issa 
said.  The report “confirms the fundamental conclusions we have
found in our 19-month investigation into Operation Fast and
Furious,” Issa, California Republican, said in his opening
statement for the panel’s hearing today on the Justice
Department inspector general’s report. “This includes the
inexcusable response from senior department officials to
legitimate inquiries from Congress.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
