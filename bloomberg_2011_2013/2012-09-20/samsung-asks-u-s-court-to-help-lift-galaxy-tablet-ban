Samsung Electronics Co. (005930)  asked a
U.S. appeals court to help lift a U.S. ban on sales of its
Galaxy Tab 10.1 resulting from a dispute with  Apple Inc. (AAPL)   U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh in San Jose, California,
ordered sales of the tablet computer halted in June, saying it
was likely the device infringed a patent for a rectangular
tablet with curved edges, a polished reflective surface and
rounded back. A U.S. jury last month said Samsung didn’t
infringe that patent.  This week, the judge refused to lift the ban because an
appeal of her order is before the  U.S. Court of Appeals  for the
Federal Circuit in Washington. She said she might dissolve the
ban if granted jurisdiction. Samsung wants the appeals court to
give her authority to make that decision.  Apple, based in Cupertino,  California , said it would seek a
sales ban of the device based on the jury’s finding that other
patents were infringed. A hearing is scheduled for December.  In a filing today with the Federal Circuit, Suwon, South
Korea-based Samsung said its appeal of the June ruling would be
moot if the higher court sends the case back to Koh and she
lifts the ban. It’s asking for an expedited decision on its
request.  The case is Apple Inc. v. Samsung Electronics Co., 12-1506,
U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (Washington). The
lower court case is Apple Inc. v. Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd.,
11-cv-01846, U.S. District Court, Northern District of
California ( San Jose ).  To contact the reporter on this story:
