Royal DSM NV (DSM) , the world’s largest
vitamin maker, said it’s in exclusive talks to buy Cargill
Inc.’s cultures and enzymes business in an effort to gain a
bigger share of a 1 billion-euro ($1.3 billion) market.  “A possible combination of the Cargill cultures and
enzymes business with the dairy business of DSM Food Specialties
would be highly complementary, creating a strong global
player,” Heerlen, Netherlands-based DSM said in a statement
today.  The Cargill division supplies the dairy and meat industries
and has factories in Wisconsin and  France , generating sales of
about 45 million euros a year, DSM said. The acquisition would
be the eighth by DSM’s nutrition unit since the Dutch company
started transforming in 2010 from a commodity-chemical
manufacturer into a maker of enzymes, specialty plastics and
nutritional supplements, it said.  Industrywide demand for cultures and enzymes is growing
steadily at more than 5 percent a year, DSM said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
