Gasoline rose for the first time in
four days as inventories of the motor fuel on the East Coast
shrank and imports declined.  Futures advanced as East Coast  stockpiles  of reformulated
gasoline, or RBOB, are at a four-year low, according to Energy
Department data. Gasoline imports into  New York  Harbor slid 45
percent last week. Prices at the pump have fallen for six
consecutive days, according to AAA data.  “ Gas prices  have dropped and there’s tightness in the
Harbor,” said  Gene McGillian , an analyst and broker at
Tradition Energy in Stamford,  Connecticut . “But this may be a
correction rather than a sign the market’s turning higher.”  October-delivery gasoline rose 4.5 cents, or 1.6 percent,
to $2.8736 a gallon at 9:48 a.m. on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . Prices fell 6.2 percent over the prior three days.  Regular  gasoline  at the pump slipped 0.8 cent to $3.846 a
gallon yesterday and have dropped 2.5 cents in six days of
declines, AAA data show. Prices reached a 2012 high of $3.936 on
April 4.  U.S. gasoline  inventories  fell 1.41 million barrels to
196.3 million last week, the eighth consecutive decline and the
lowest level since October 2008.  Futures also gained as Irving Oil Corp.’s Saint John
refinery in New Brunswick shut a fluid catalytic cracker. The
298,800-barrel-a-day refinery exports half of its output to the
U.S. Northeast.  “RBOB inventories are low, imports were substantially down
and there’s the unscheduled shutdown of a gasoline-producing
unit that supplies the Northeast,” said  Andy Lipow , president
of Lipow Oil Associates LLC in Houston.  Heating oil for October delivery rose 2.35 cents, or 0.8
percent, to $3.0675 a gallon on the exchange, after declining 6
percent the first three days of the week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
