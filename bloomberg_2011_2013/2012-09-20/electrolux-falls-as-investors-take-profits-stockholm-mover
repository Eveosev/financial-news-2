Electrolux AB (ELUXB) , the world’s second-
largest appliance maker, fell the most in over four months after
investors reaped profits on the best-performing stock on the  OMX
Stockholm 30 Index (OMX)  this year.  Electrolux fell as much as 5.1 percent, the biggest
intraday drop since May 4, and was trading 4.7 percent lower at
163.2 kronor at 12:25 p.m. in Stockholm, where it’s based.  “I think it’s pure profit taking,” Anders Trapp, an
analyst at SEB AB in Stockholm, said by telephone today.  “This
week there have been some minor news that could be interpreted
negatively, and this creates profit taking for a share that has
performed extremely well this year,” he said.  The maker of Frigidaire refrigerators and AEG vacuum
cleaners has gained nearly 50 percent this year as price
increases in  North America  and Europe have taken hold,
outperforming the 38 percent rise for  Swedbank AB (SWEDA) , the second-
best performer on the OMX Stockholm 30 Index.  Electrolux fell 1.6 percent yesterday after U.S. shipments
of refrigerators, freezers and washers rose less than expected
in August. Chief Executive Officer Keith McLoughlin on Sept. 17
reiterated July forecasts that Europe’s wider appliance market
may shrink by as much as 2 percent this year and that demand in
North America is set to be somewhere between unchanged and 2
percent growth.  To contact the reporter on this story:
