The cost for European banks to
borrow in dollars held near the highest level in five days,
according to a money-markets indicator.  The three-month cross-currency  basis swap , the rate banks
pay to convert euro interest payments into dollars, was 22 basis
points below the euro interbank offered rate at 10:05 a.m. in
 London , according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The cost has
increased from minus 15.1 on Sept. 14, which was the cheapest
level since June 2011.  The one-year basis swap was 26.5 basis points, or 0.265
percentage point, below Euribor from minus 26 yesterday.  Three-month Euribor, the rate banks say they see each other
lending in euros, was set at a record-low 0.233 percent, down
from 0.238 percent yesterday. The benchmark is derived from a
daily survey of banks for the European Banking Federation.  A measure of European banks’ reluctance to make unsecured
loans to one another held at the lowest since June 2011. The
difference between Euribor and overnight index swaps, the
Euribor-OIS spread, was little changed at 15.9 basis points.  The European Banking Federation’s euro overnight index
average, or Eonia, of unsecured lending deals was set at 0.09
percent yesterday from 0.1 percent the day before. The Eonia
swap, an estimate of average overnight borrowing costs over the
next three months, was 7.7 basis points, the lowest since Sept.
5, compared with 8.3 yesterday.  Lenders cut  overnight deposits  at the European Central Bank
yesterday, placing 299 billion euros ($387 billion) with the
Frankfurt-based central bank from 318 billion euros the day
before.  To contact the reporter on this story:
