Zimbabwe ended on 93-8 after being put in to bat by South Africa
in today’s only ICC World Twenty20 cricket match.  Craig Ervine, with 37 runs, and Stuart Matsikenyeri, on 11,
were the only batsmen to reach double figures in the Group C
game in Hambantota,  Sri Lanka . Morne Morkel took 2-16 while
wicketkeeper-captain AB de Villiers took four catches.  It’s South Africa’s first game in this year’s event.
Zimbabwe lost to Sri Lanka by 82 runs two days ago.  Defending champion England’s first game in Group A is
against Afghanistan in Colombo tomorrow.  The top two in each of the four groups go through to a
Super Eight stage, from which the top two teams in each pool
advance to the semifinals. The final is in  Colombo  on Oct. 7.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
