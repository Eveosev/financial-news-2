Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd. (MM) ,  India ’s
biggest utility vehicle maker, unveiled a cheaper version of its
Xylo model to win potential customers of  Maruti (MSIL)  Suzuki India
Ltd.’s best-selling models and revive profit margins.  Mahindra yesterday started selling the Quanto, targeting
customers of Maruti’s Swift and DZire with the vehicle that’s 12
percent shorter in length than the Xylo, according to Pravin N. Shah, chief executive officer of its automotive division. The
company can produce 7,000 units of the Xylo and Quanto a month.  Chairman  Anand Mahindra  is banking on the success of the
Xylo platform to lure customers away from Maruti, India’s
biggest carmaker, and maintain Mahindra’s lead in the nation’s
fastest-growing vehicle segment. The company’s earnings  forecast 
may be raised by analysts should it sell more than 1,500 units
of the Quanto a month, said Umesh Karne, an analyst at Brics
Securities Ltd. in Mumbai.  “It’s a game-changer for us,” Mahindra’s Shah said in an
interview. “We can attract customers from hatchbacks and
sedans, allowing us to play in a bigger playground.”  It took Mahindra, which started making sports utility
vehicles with the Willys Jeep in 1945, about 32 months and 1
billion rupees ($18 million) to develop the Quanto, which has a
three cylinder, 1.5 liter engine, Shah said. The Xylo has a 2.2
liter, four cylinder engine.  The Quanto, priced at 582,000 rupees, will also compete
with Mahindra’s former partner Renault SA, which began selling
the Duster utility vehicle for 751,000 rupees in July in India.
Maruti introduced the 779,000-rupee Ertiga in April, a model
that shares a platform and components with its Swift and DZire
cars.  Easy Availability  A larger network and low-cost parts may help Maruti keep
buyers, said Brics’ Karne. Maruti, which started producing cars
in 1983, has 1,100 dealers and 2,958 service stations all over
the nation, compared with 300 dealers for Mahindra. The unit of
 Suzuki Motor Corp. (7269)  sells 15 brands in the South Asian nation.
Maruti Chairman R.C. Bhargava declined to comment on the
challenge from Mahindra.  Mahindra, which has  risen  fivefold since introducing the
Xylo in January 2009, fell 1.7 percent to 784.60 rupees in
Mumbai yesterday. The  BSE Auto Index (BSEAUTO)  has risen fourfold in the
period. Maruti gained 0.5 percent to 1,282.9 rupees.  Mumbai-based Mahindra reported its narrowest  operating
profit margin  in 9 years in the 12 months ended March as raw
material costs surged even as sales expanded at the fastest pace
since at least 2003, helped by the introduction of new  utility
vehicles . The market for such vehicles expanded 57 percent in
the five months to Aug. 30 even as passenger car sales growth
slowed to 0.9 percent in the period.  Operating Margin  Rising raw material expenses and slowing sales at
Mahindra’s  tractor  unit may result in operating profit margins
shrinking further to 9.3 percent in the year that started April
1 from 9.5 percent, according to a forecast of 12 analysts
compiled by Bloomberg.  The move to reduce the Xylo’s size by 53.5 centimeters (21
inches) and introduce a smaller engine will help Mahindra cut
costs. Companies have to pay an excise tax of 12 percent for
cars that are less than 4 meters long and have a diesel engine
capacity of 1.5 liters, less than a 27 percent levy for bigger
cars.  The pricing may entice “people to think about upgrading to
an SUV from a hatchback,” said Basudeb Banerjee, an analyst
with Quant Broking Pvt. in Mumbai. “The pricing is broadly in
line with the cost for a diesel variant of the Swift.”  Maruti last year sold 345,886 Swift, DZire, Estilo and Ritz
cars, according to data from the  Society of Indian Automobile
Manufacturers . Maruti first began selling the Swift hatchback in
2005. The diesel-fueled variant of the 1.2 liter engine capacity
Swift starts at 578,171 rupees.  ‘Tackle Challenges’  Mahindra sold 109,949 units of the Xylo, Scorpio and Bolero
vehicles in the same period. Total sales of its passenger
vehicles rose 36 percent to 245,700 units in the year ended
March 31.  Mahindra had to close bookings twice after getting swamped
with orders following the introduction of the XUV500 SUV last
year. Priced between 1.1 million rupees and 1.36 million rupees,
the XUV500 initially received 8,000 orders in 10 days, and led
Mahindra to increase production to 5,000 a month, from the
initial 3,000 unit capacity it had set up.  Mahindra will unveil the first jointly developed platform
with  Ssangyong Motor Co. (003620)  by 2015, seeking to integrate its South
Korean unit and boost margins. Mahindra will spend 300 billion
won ($267 million) to develop the vehicles with the automaker it
acquired last year, the company said in June.  “Mahindra’s continuous launches of competitive products
and its robust experience in utility vehicles will help it
tackle challenges,” said Brics’ Karne. New products will “push
its automotive volumes further.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
