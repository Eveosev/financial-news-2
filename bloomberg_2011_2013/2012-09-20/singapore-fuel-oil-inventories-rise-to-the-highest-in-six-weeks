Singaporeâ€™s stockpiles of residues
rose to the highest level in six weeks, according to data from
the Ministry of Trade and Industry.  Onshore inventories of  residues , a category that includes
 fuel oil  and low-sulfur waxy residue and excludes bitumen, rose
5.5 percent to 19.98 million barrels in the week ended Sept. 19,
 International Enterprise Singapore , a unit of the ministry, said
today in an e-mailed statement. That is the highest level since
the week ended Aug. 7. Supplies gained for a fourth week as
shipments from western countries rose in September.  Stockpiles of  light distillates  such as naphtha, reformate
and gasoline declined 9.9 percent to 8.61 million barrels.
 Middle distillates , a category that includes gasoil and
kerosene, dropped 2.6 percent to 9.24 million barrels.  The trade ministry unit surveys refiners,  oil companies  and
storage terminals on a voluntary basis. The results may exclude
some offshore storage capacity, International Enterprise said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
