OAO Gazprom (OGZD) ,  Russia ’s natural-gas
export monopoly, and ports operator Summa Group agreed to study
using liquefied natural gas as a bunker fuel for ships and to
build storage facilities in the North and Baltic Seas.  The two companies will at a later stage also consider
expanding cooperation in the Black and Mediterranean Seas and
the  Pacific Ocean , they said today in a joint statement after
signing a memorandum of understanding.  Gazprom, the world’s biggest gas producer, is promoting use
of the fuel to power ships and vehicles as a cleaner and cheaper
alternative to oil. Global demand for LNG, which is gas cooled
to a liquid for transportation by tanker, will more than double
by 2025, Deutsche Bank AG forecast in August.  Summa invests in Russian ports and a Rotterdam oil
terminal. Gazprom owns a majority share in Sakhalin Energy,
which operates Russia’s only LNG plant off the country’s Pacific
coast, and plans to build another near Vladivostok, also tapping
fields around Sakhalin Island. It’s also developing smaller LNG
projects to supply small business and to fuel vehicles.  To contact the reporter on this story:
