The head of  Amtrak  defended
taxpayer support for rail fares, saying highways have received
more in emergency assistance in the past four years than the
U.S. passenger railroad has gotten in its 41-year history.  “In the past four years, the federal government has
appropriated $53.3 billion from the general fund of the Treasury
to bail out the highway trust fund,”  Amtrak  Chief Executive
Officer Joseph Boardman said in testimony prepared for a
congressional hearing today. “That’s almost 30 percent more
than the total federal expenditure on Amtrak since 1971.”  Boardman appeared today at a House Transportation and
Infrastructure Committee hearing where Chairman  John Mica , a
Florida Republican, said the average taxpayer subsidy for the
past five years works out to $50.97 per ticket sold.  Amtrak, the U.S. long-distance passenger railroad, says it
covers 85 percent of its operating costs from ticket revenue. It
receives its capital and debt budget from the U.S. government.  Amtrak, based in Washington, has defended its taxpayer
support “since our creation,” said  Steve Kulm , a spokesman.  To contact the reporter on this story:
