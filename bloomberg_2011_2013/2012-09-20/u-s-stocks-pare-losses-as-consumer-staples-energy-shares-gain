U.S. stocks reversed early losses
as ConAgra Foods Inc. led consumer-staples companies higher
after boosting its profit forecast and energy shares halted a
three-day slump.  ConAgra, the maker of Orville Redenbacher’s popcorn, surged
6.4 percent after also increasing its dividend. Exxon Mobil
Corp., Chevron Corp. and Schlumberger Ltd. paced an advance in
energy producers.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index was down 0.2 percent at
1,458.18 at 2:31 p.m. in  New York  after sliding as much as 0.8
percent. The  Dow Jones Industrial Average  rose 6.35 points to
13,584.31 after erasing an earlier 75 point slide.  Benchmark indexes slumped earlier as data from China to
Japan and Europe fueled concern that the global economy was
slowing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
