New World Resources Plc (NWR) , the Czech
Republic’s biggest producer of coking coal, fell the most this
month as a drop in commodity prices overshadowed an upgrade from
PKO Bank Polski SA.  NWR retreated 2.7 percent to 90.01 koruna by the close in
 Prague , its steepest one-day drop since Aug. 30 and extending
losses this year to 34 percent.  Europe ’s benchmark coal price
fell 0.7 percent to $98.85 a metric ton in the Netherlands.  Basic-resources companies are among the biggest decliners
in Europe today after data showed manufacturing and services
output in the euro area, the biggest buyer of Czech exports,
fell to a three-year low in September. Chinese manufacturing
probably shrank for an 11th month and Japan’s exports tumbled
for a third month, according to separate reports.  “Trading in Asian markets brought a significant worsening
of investor sentiment because of renewed concern about the
global economy after Japanese exports and data on the Chinese
industry disappointed,”  Josef Nemy , a stock analyst at Komercni
Banka AS in Prague, wrote in a report to clients today.  PKO raised NWR to hold from sell in a report from Warsaw-
based analyst Artur Iwanski, citing the stock’s “significant
decline” and expectations coking coal will rebound next year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
