Hungarian Premier  Viktor Orban ’s
plan to introduce voter registration ahead of the 2014
elections, criticized by opposition parties, may cut voter
participation by a quarter, MTI said citing an Ipsos study.  The voter registration’s impact on political parties would
be proportionate, the Ipsos study said, according to the state
news service, which didn’t cite a methodology.  Former Hungarian prime minister Ferenc Gyurcsany, who heads
Demokratikus Koalicio, the smallest parliamentary party, staged
a hunger strike last week in Budapest against the voter
registration plan, saying if introduced elections would no
longer be free and fair.  Orban’s Fidesz party maintained its poll lead in September,
with its support rising to 19 percent, the highest level this
year, from 17 percent the previous month, MTI said, citing an
Ipsos poll. The biggest opposition party, the Socialist Party,
saw its backing increase to 15 percent from 14 percent, with the
extremist nationalist Jobbik’s support unchanged at 8 percent.  The poll was done “in the first half” of September by
asking 1,500 eligible voters, MTI said citing Ipsos, without
giving the margin of error.  To contact the reporter on this story:
