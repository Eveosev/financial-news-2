Jefferies Group Inc. (JEF) , the
investment bank that helped rescue  Knight Capital Group Inc. (KCG) ,
dropped the most in 10 months in New York trading after
reporting revenue and earnings that fell short of analysts’
estimates excluding gains from the deal.  Shares of Jefferies declined 7.3 percent to $14.52 at 4:15
p.m., after the company posted net income for the three months
ended Aug. 31 of $70.2 million, or 31 cents a share. Earnings
adjusted for the  Knight Capital  transaction were 24 cents a
share, compared with the  average estimate  of five analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg for 26 cents.  Jefferies helped arrange a $400 million bailout for Knight
Capital earlier this year after trading losses spurred by a
software failure. The share ownership added $103.3 million to
Jefferies’s principal-transaction revenue and 8 cents to its
earnings per share, according to a statement today from the New
York-based firm.  “There is some disappointment that more of the Knight gain
did not accrue to shareholders,” said  Douglas Sipkin , an
analyst at Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP. “Knight made a big
gain of $100 million, so why only 8 cents for shareholders? Why
are you paying out so much of that to employees?”  Jefferies set aside $440.4 million, or 60 percent of net
revenue, for compensation in the quarter, compared with $299.6
million, or 59 percent, a year earlier. The firm employed 3,814
people at Aug. 31, compared with 3,809 on May 31 and 3,842 on
Aug. 31 last year.  Cutting Costs  The compensation ratio should fall during the next several
years following a surge in headcount from 2008 to 2011,  Brian Friedman , chairman of the executive committee, said today on a
conference call. Jefferies is focusing on cutting costs, which
will make room for the ratio to decline, he said.  Total non-interest expenses increased to $608.3 million
from $468.7 million in the fiscal third quarter last year.  Net revenue jumped 45 percent to $738.9 million from last
year’s fiscal third quarter. The increase was driven by sales
and trading, which more than doubled to $475.7 million.
Investment banking revenue fell 11 percent to $260.2 million.  Revenue from fixed-income sales and trading surged to
$265.7 million from $33.1 million in the year-earlier period.
Equity sales and trading revenue climbed 66 percent to $210
million.  Revenue Miss  “Absent Knight, it was a revenue miss,” said  Jeff Harte ,
an analyst at Sandler O’Neill & Partners LP. Jefferies’s fixed-
income trading revenue missed Harte’s estimate of $278 million.
“My sense was that the market was thinking the consensus number
was conservative, but it turned out to be aggressive.”  Jefferies will probably report “solid financial results”
for the rest of the year, Moody’s Investors Service said this
month. The rating company said it may still cut Jefferies’s
credit grade as it faces the same capital-markets pressures that
prompted the downgrade of 15 other banks earlier this year.  The firm has kept leverage down and has a “more liquid,
less complex” balance sheet than its larger peers, Moody’s
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
