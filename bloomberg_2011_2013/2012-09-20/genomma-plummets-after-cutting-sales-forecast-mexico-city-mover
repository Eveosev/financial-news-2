Genomma Lab Internacional SAB (LABB) , a
Mexican producer of over-the-counter drugs, fell the most in
seven months after trimming its forecast for revenue growth.  The stock tumbled 6.1 percent to 26.01 pesos at the close
in Mexico City, the steepest intraday decline since Feb. 24. The
benchmark  IPC index  of 35 Mexican stocks slid 1.1 percent.  Genomma Lab reduced its 2012 sales growth forecast to 20
percent, compared with a previously projected range of 23
percent to 26 percent, according to an e-mailed statement today.
The Mexico City-based company said it had delays introducing
over-the-counter and personal care products through a client in
the U.S., prompting it to pare estimates.  Today’s decline wiped out Genomma’s advance this year,
putting it down 3.6 percent in 2012. The IPC has climbed 9.2
percent in the period.  To contact the reporters on this story:
