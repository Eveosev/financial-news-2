What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets, which resume trading at 5 p.m.
on the  Chicago  Board of Trade.  -- Soybean futures may open 1 cent to 3 cents a bushel lower on
speculation that rain during the past month across the U.S.
Midwest boosted yields,  Jerry Gidel , the chief grain analyst for
Rice Dairy LLC in Chicago, said in a telephone interview.  -- Corn futures are called to open steady to 1 cent a bushel
lower as dry weather forecast for the next 10 days may
accelerate harvesting and sales by Midwest farmers, Gidel said.  -- Wheat futures may open steady to 1 cent a bushel higher on
speculation that dry weather across the drought-parched southern
U.S. Great Plains will delay planting, reducing yield potential,
Gidel said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
