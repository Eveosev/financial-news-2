Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PBR)  is in talks
to sell its 40 percent stake in the Atlanta and Oliva offshore
fields that are located in the BS-4 block in the Santos Basin,
Upstream reported, citing people it didn’t identify.  Upstream didn’t say which possible buyer Petrobras, as the
Rio de Janeiro-based state-controlled producer is known, is in
talks with.  QGEP Participacoes SA (QGEP3)  and Barra Energia each have 30
percent stakes in the block that holds an estimated 2.1 billion
barrels of recoverable oil, the Oslo-based oil-industry
newspaper said in a newsletter distributed in Rio.  To contact the reporter on this story:
