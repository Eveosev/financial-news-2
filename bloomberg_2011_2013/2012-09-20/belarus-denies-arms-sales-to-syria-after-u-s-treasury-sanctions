Belarus denied selling materials to
 Syria  that were used to produce aerial bombs deployed in a
crackdown against civilians after the U.S. imposed  sanctions 
against Belvneshpromservice, a state-owned arms supplier.  The accusations are “groundless and untrue,” the
Belarusian Foreign Ministry in the capital, Minsk, said in a
 statement  on its website today. “This is no more than an
attempt to pressure Belarus for our country’s open and
principled position in favor of a peaceful settlement in the
Syrian conflict.”  The  U.S. Treasury  imposed sanctions on Minsk-based
Belvneshpromservice for “providing services” to Syria’s Army
Supply Bureau. The “actions seek to disrupt the flow of weapons
and communications equipment to the Syrian regime and help
prevent their use against the Syrian people,” Undersecretary
for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence David S. Cohen said in
a  statement  yesterday.  Belvneshpromservice is licensed by the government to
develop, produce, modernize and sell weapons, according to its
 website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
