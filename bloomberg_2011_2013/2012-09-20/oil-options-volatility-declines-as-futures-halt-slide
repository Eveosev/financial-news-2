Crude oil options volatility
declined as underlying futures were little changed after sinking
7.1 percent the first three days of the week.  Implied volatility for options expiring in November, a
measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge of
options prices, was 30.7 percent as of 3 p.m. in  New York , down
from 33.8 percent yesterday.  Crude oil for November delivery rose 12 cents to settle at
$92.42 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange .  The most active options in electronic trading today were
November $80 puts, which fell 17 cents to 26 cents a barrel at
2:42 p.m. with 2,096 lots trading. November $90 puts were the
second-most active, with 1,661 lots changing hands as they
declined 44 cents to $2.03 a barrel.  Bets that prices would fall accounted for 55 percent of the
41,002 contracts in electronic trading. One contract covers
1,000 barrels of crude oil.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on open-
outcry volume, where the bulk of options activity occurs.  In the previous session, bearish beats made up 53 percent
of the 224,119 contracts traded.  November $75 puts were the most actively traded options
with 8,767 lots changing hands. They rose 8 cents to 16 cents a
barrel. November $115 calls fell 17 cents to 13 cents on volume
of 8,747.  Open interest was highest for December $120 calls with
44,396 contracts. Next were December $80 puts with 43,937 lots
and December $100 calls with 43,440.  To contact the reporter on this story:
