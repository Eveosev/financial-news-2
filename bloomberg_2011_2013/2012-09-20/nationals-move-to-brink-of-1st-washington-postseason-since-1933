The  Washington Nationals  split a
doubleheader with the Los Angeles Dodgers, moving one win from
giving the nation’s capital a postseason baseball team for the
first time in 79 years.  The Nationals (90-58), who have the best record in Major
League Baseball, need one win in their 14 remaining games this
season to reach the playoffs as the National League East
division champion or as one of the league’s two wild cards.  The Nationals lead the NL East by five games over the
 Atlanta Braves . The top two non-division winners in each league
earn wild-card spots in the postseason.  Washington defeated the Dodgers 3-1 in the first game
yesterday at Nationals Park before losing the second game 7-6.
The teams play again tonight in Washington.  The last time a team in Washington made the postseason was
in 1933, when the Senators won the American League pennant and
then lost the  World Series  in five games to the  New York  Giants.  The Senators failed to make the postseason for the
following 27 years and moved to Minnesota after the 1960 season
to become the Twins.  An expansion team, also called the Senators, never advanced
beyond the regular season while playing 1961-71 in Washington.
That club moved to Texas and became the Rangers.  There was no major league franchise in Washington from 1971
until 2005, when the Montreal Expos moved to the U.S. capital
and became the Nationals.  The doubleheader split left the Dodgers (77-72) two games
behind the St. Louis Cardinals (79-70) for the second NL wild-
card spot. The Cardinals won 5-0 at home last night against the
 Houston Astros .  Atlanta (86-64) holds the first wild-card spot after a 3-0
win last night at the Miami Marlins.  To contact the reporter on this story:
