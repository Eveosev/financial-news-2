Liberty Global Inc. (LBTYA)  offered to buy
the remaining 49.6 percent of  Belgium ’s  Telenet Group Holding NV (TNET) 
for 1.96 billion euros ($2.5 billion), allowing the John Malone-
led cable company to forge closer ties between European units.  Telenet investors will get 35 euros a share in cash,
Liberty Global, based in Englewood,  Colorado , said today in a
statement. The offer is 13 percent higher than yesterday’s
closing price for Mechelen-based Telenet’s shares. Telenet
jumped to 34.97 euros at 12:46 p.m. Brussels time.  Liberty Global Chairman Malone and Chief Executive Officer
Michael Fries are expanding in  Europe , where demand for TV,
Internet and phone services delivered over cable is increasing.
Liberty Global has controlled Telenet since 2007, and it bought
German cable provider Kabel Baden-Wuerttemberg for 3.16 billion
euros last year and its larger competitor, Unitymedia, for 3.5
billion euros in 2009.  The deal will let Malone “push for stronger collaboration
and synergies with his other European operations,” said Marc Hesselink, an analyst with ABN Amro Bank NV in Amsterdam. “The
premium he paid on the Telenet share is also not excessive,
which makes it a good deal.”  The offer values Telenet at 5.6 times its earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. That compares
with a median multiple of 5.3 for 114 telecommunications deals
in Western Europe in the past year.  Growth Market  Telenet shares had advanced 5.5 percent this year through
yesterday. Liberty Global, which owns a 50.4 percent stake in
Telenet, fell 0.2 percent to $57.28 yesterday in  New York  and
has climbed 40 percent this year.  Ziggo NV (ZIGGO) , a Dutch cable
company, rose as much as 5.4 percent in Amsterdam.  Europe is Liberty Global’s biggest market, and the company
also has assets in  Latin America . Its European customers total
18.4 million. With Telenet’s 2.15 million cable-TV users,
Belgium is Liberty Global’s second-biggest market after  Germany .  Demand for cable services in Europe is increasing, with
customers migrating to digital connections from analogue.
Digital cable penetration among German households is projected
to rise to 23.7 percent in 2016 from 11.6 percent in 2011,
according to researcher IHS Screen Digest. Total TV, Internet
and phone subscriptions with cable companies in the country are
forecast to rise by 24 percent to 32 million in 2016.  Raised Forecasts  Telenet today raised its sales and profit forecasts for
2012, helped by growth in the number of subscribers that use
multiple services such as digital TV and mobile-phone
connections. Sales will probably rise 7 percent to 8 percent,
compared with a prior range of 5 percent to 6 percent, and
Ebitda growth should match that rate, it said.  The company said it will continue preparing a plan to buy
back an 18.2 percent stake at a price of 31.75 euros a share.
That price was revised down from an initially announced 35 euros
due to a decrease in the company’s capital. The buyback will
take place if Liberty Global doesn’t complete the offer or
doesn’t meet its conditions, Telenet said.  Telenet  gained  67,200 so-called triple-play customers using
TV, Internet and phone services in the first half from a year
earlier, bringing the total share to 38 percent of the company’s
clients. That allowed Telenet to boost average revenue per
customer 10 percent to 45.10 euros a month.  Liberty Global is being advised by Morgan Stanley and
Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer LLP.  To contact the reporter on this story:
