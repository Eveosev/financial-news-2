The German Foreign Ministry
summoned Belarus’s ambassador to protest the denial of visa
applications three days before parliamentary elections.  Limits to press and travel freedom are a “notably negative
signal” before the Belarus election, the Foreign Ministry in
Berlin said in an e-mailed statement today. The former Soviet
republic is holding the election on Sept. 23.  “The government has no understanding why election
observers -- including a delegate from the German Bundestag --
and journalists were denied visas in connection with the
upcoming parliamentary election in Belarus,” the ministry said.  Entry into Belarus by the German lawmaker, regime critic
Marieluise Beck, and a Lithuanian legislator were denied as
“undesirable,” Belarus Foreign Ministry spokesman Andrei
Savinykh told  Interfax news agency  yesterday. Calls placed to
the ministry in Minsk seeking comment were unanswered.  Beck told the Minsk-based Belapan news agency that the
denial of her visa is “further proof that the elections are a
farce.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
