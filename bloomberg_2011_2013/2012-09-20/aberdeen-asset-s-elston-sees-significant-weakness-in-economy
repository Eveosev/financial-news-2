Aberdeen Asset Management Plc (ADN) ,
which oversees about $270 billion, said it’s staying cautious as
it foresees “significant weakness” in the global economy.  The comments come even after the  European Central Bank 
announced a bond buying program on Sept. 6, and the U.S. Federal
Reserve unveiled a third round of quantitative easing on Sept.
13 to bolster growth. Japanese data showed today  exports  fell
5.8 percent in August from a year earlier, the third straight
decline, while a private survey signaled Chinese manufacturing
may contract for an 11th month in September.  “We’re very concerned about the near-term outlook for the
global economic picture,” Peter Elston, Singapore-based head of
Asia-Pacific strategy at Aberdeen Asset, said in an interview
with Bloomberg Television today. “The slowdown in trade
globally is very notable. A lot of companies are talking about a
weak trade picture.”  The  MSCI Asia Pacific (MXAP)  Index dropped 0.7 percent to 123.37
as of 10:56 a.m. in  Hong Kong  today, poised for its steepest
decline since Sept. 5. The Fed and ECB actions helped drive the
Asian gauge up by 5.5 percent this month through yesterday,
while the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index climbed 3.9 percent and
the Stoxx Europe 600 Index added 3.3 percent.  The MSCI Asia Pacific index trades at 12.8 times estimated
profit, compared with 14.1 times for the S&P 500 and 12.2 for
the Stoxx Europe 600 Index, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Elston’s comments are in line with predictions from Pacific
Investment Management Co., manager of the world’s biggest bond
fund, which said on Sept. 12 the likelihood of widespread
recessions across developed nations is increasing.  FedEx Corp. (FDX) , operator of the world’s largest cargo airline,
said this week global growth will slow to 2.3 percent this year
and 2.7 percent in 2013, pulling back on projections of 2.4
percent and 3 percent, respectively.  “There’s some fairly significant weakness just around the
corner and that’s going to have a big impact on corporates and
markets,” Elston said. “We’re still fairly cautious.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
