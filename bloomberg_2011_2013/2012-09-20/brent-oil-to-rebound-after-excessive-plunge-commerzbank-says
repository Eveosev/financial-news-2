Brent crude is set to rebound after
an “excessive” 8 percent plunge this week, according to
Commerzbank AG.  “We expect a counter-movement in the next few days,”
 Carsten Fritsch , an analyst based in Frankfurt, said in a
report. The drop in Brent, trading at $107 a barrel in London
today, appears over-done “given that other economic barometers
such as equity markets and copper have defended their gains over
the same period.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
