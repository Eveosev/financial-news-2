Nomura Holdings Inc. (8604) ,  Japan ’s
biggest brokerage, began eliminating about 30 percent of jobs at
its European, Middle East and African  investment banking 
division yesterday, according to a person briefed on the plans.  The cuts mostly affect bankers in the advisory and industry
coverage areas within the securities unit, the person said,
asking not to be identified because the plans haven’t been made
public. Officials at Tokyo-based Nomura declined to comment on
the reductions, which were reported by CNBC yesterday.  The cutbacks are part of the company’s $1 billion cost
reduction target, with almost half the savings coming from
 Europe . The revamp in strategy follows a four-year struggle to
build a business overseas after the purchase of Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc.’s European and Asian units in 2008.  The firm last week cut a team of London proprietary traders
focused on stocks, said two people with knowledge of the matter.
The group of about five was part of Nomura’s Angel Lane
Principal Strategies, a unit that makes wagers on markets with
capital provided by the bank, according to the people, who also
declined to be identified as the cuts hadn’t been announced.  Nomura will also eliminate four of its 12 investment
banking jobs in Dubai, a person with knowledge of the situation
said yesterday. The job reductions include Scott Ferguson, head
of investment banking in the  Middle East  and North Africa
region, said the person, who asked not to be identified because
the cuts haven’t been publicly announced.  To contact the reporter on this story:
