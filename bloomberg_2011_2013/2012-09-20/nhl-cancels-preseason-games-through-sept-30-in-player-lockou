The  National Hockey League  canceled
preseason games through Sept. 30 and prepared for a four-day
work week starting Oct. 1 as the player lockout extended into
its fifth day.  NHL owners locked out players on Sept. 16 following the
expiration of the league’s collective bargaining agreement. The
regular season is scheduled to begin Oct. 11.  The two sides, which have not formally met since the
lockout began, are at odds over revenue sharing and player
compensation. The NHL made a record $3.2 billion in revenue last
season.  This is the third lockout in a North American sports league
since March 2011. The  National Football League  missed one
preseason game while negotiating a new labor accord last year,
and the  National Basketball Association  canceled regular-season
games before an agreement was reached in late November.  NHL employees will have their salaries cut 20 percent as
they move to a four-day work week. League spokesman Gary Meagher
said the news was given to employees yesterday by Commissioner
Gary Bettman, the Canadian Press reported.  The Ottawa Senators and  Florida Panthers  announced layoffs
this week.  Some players have agreed to play overseas during the work
stoppage, including Evgeni Malkin, the league’s 2012 Most
Valuable Player, and Ilya Kovalchuk, a three-time All-Star. More
than 300 NHL players competed in Europe during the NHL’s
previous lockout, which resulted in the cancellation of the
2004-05 season.  To contact the reporter on this story:
