Brazil  raised its 2012 forecast for
dividends from state-controlled companies by 2.5 billion reais
($1.24 billion), which will help offset a drop in tax
collection, according to the bimonthly budget revision.  The government reduced its 2012 tax collection estimate by
11.7 billion reais to 665 billion reais after reducing levies on
 consumer goods  and payrolls to boost economic growth, the report
published today on the Planning and Budget Ministryâ€™s website
said.  The central government, which includes the Treasury, the
central bank and social security, targets a primary surplus
before interest payments of 97 billion reais this year. In the
first seven months of the year, the so-called primary surplus
was 51.9 billion reais, or 54 percent of the 2012 goal.  The 2012 economic growth forecast was cut to 2 percent from
3 percent, as Finance Minister  Guido Mantega  anticipated on
Sept. 13.  To contact the reporter on this story:
