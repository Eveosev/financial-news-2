Spain  sold 4.8 billion euros ($6.2
billion) of bonds, the most since January, as the Treasury
focused on short-term notes that would be targeted for central-
bank buying in the case of a bailout.  The Madrid-based Treasury sold 3.94 billion euros of a new
three-year benchmark at an average yield of 3.845 percent and
859 million euros of its 10-year benchmark at an average of
5.666 percent. That was the lowest since January and compares
with 6.647 percent when it was last sold on Aug. 2.  Bond yields, which have fallen since European Central Bank
President  Mario Draghi  said on Aug. 2 he may buy debt from cash-
strapped nations, were little changed from their pre-auction
levels. While Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy  says he continues to
analyze whether to seek the bailout that would trigger ECB debt
purchases, his deputy, Soraya Saenz de Santamaria, twice set out
arguments in favor of a rescue this week.  “The result is decent, but it doesn’t follow that the
market will react positively as it pushes back the timetable,”
said  Harvinder Sian , a fixed income strategist at Royal Bank of
 Scotland  in  London . “A bad auction will push Rajoy to seek a
bailout, a good one means he might vacillate again.”  The yield on the benchmark 10-year bond was 5.723 percent
after the sale from 5.724 percent beforehand and 5.693 percent
yesterday. That pushed the gap over equivalent German securities
to 414 basis points from 407 basis points yesterday.  As foreign investors withdraw from Spain, local lenders
have picked up the slack, data from the Treasury show. Spanish
banks held 32 percent of the outstanding debt in July, up from
17 percent at the end of last year, while non-residents cut
their holdings to 34 percent from 50 percent over the same
period. Helping fund those purchases, Spanish banks, which are
still reeling from real-estate losses, have increased their
dependence on ECB financing to record levels, Bank of Spain data
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
