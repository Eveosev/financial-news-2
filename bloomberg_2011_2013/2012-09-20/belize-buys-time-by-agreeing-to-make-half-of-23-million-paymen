Belize agreed to make about half of
a missed payment on $544 million of its debt, buying time as it
negotiates with creditors.  The Central American country will pay holders of a 2029
bond $11.7 million of the $23 million that they’re owed,
according to statement issued today.  “This suggests Belize doesn’t want to walk away from the
negotiation and cares about the public relations part of it,”
Joe Kogan, the head of emerging-market debt strategy at Scotia
 Capital Markets , said in a phone interview from  New York . “It’s
a step towards building goodwill. There’s some reason to expect
a better outcome than Belize offered initially.”  A day after Belize missed the payment on Aug. 20,  Standard
& Poor’s  lowered its rating to selective default and said
investors were likely to recover 30 percent to 50 percent of the
bonds’ face value in a restructuring. A 30-day grace period for
Belize expired yesterday.  The bond gained 0.55 cent to 34.85 cents today, the biggest
advance since Aug. 27, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Bank of Nova Scotia (BNS)  and Citigroup Inc. say the government’s
proposals to restructure debt presented Aug. 8 give the
securities a net present value of about 20 cents, the least
among 16 sovereign debt restructurings since 1998.  “By showing good faith in paying the partial coupon, they
show that they are not rogue borrowers,” Carl Ross, who covers
Central America and the Caribbean as a managing director at
Oppenheimer & Co. in Atlanta, said in an e-mail message before
Belize’s announcement. The brokerage holds no Belize debt.  Growth Outlook  The  International Monetary Fund  forecasts Belize’s economy
will expand 2.8 percent this year after growing 2 percent in
2011, compared with 4 percent growth for Central America.  About 35 percent of the country’s population lives in a
dwelling without a flush toilet or refrigerator, according to a
2010 census.  Tourism and services accounted for 55 percent of gross
domestic product in 2011. Manufacturing and construction made up
21 percent of the economy, while agriculture and fishing’s
contribution fell for a sixth consecutive year, to 11 percent,
according to the central bank.  To contact the reporters on this story:
