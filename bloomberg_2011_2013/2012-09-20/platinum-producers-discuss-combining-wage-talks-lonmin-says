The world’s largest platinum
producers are discussing combining wage talks to help curb
violent strikes that killed 46 people in the past five weeks.  “There are industry discussions,” acting Lonmin Chief
Executive Officer Simon Scott said today in Johannesburg, where
the company is based. “All of them” are in discussions that
are taking place “within the context of the Chamber of Mines.”  South Africa’s Chamber of Mines negotiates wages with
unions on the behalf of gold and coal producers including
 AngloGold Ashanti Ltd. (AU)  and  BHP Billiton (BHP)  Ltd. in a process called
centralized bargaining.  Lonmin and  Impala Platinum Holdings Ltd. (IMP) , the third- and
second-biggest producers of the metal, suffered strikes amid
clashes with police that left dozens dead.  Anglo American
Platinum Ltd. (AMS)  has set an ultimatum for miners to resume work
today after it idled Rustenburg mines last week as a
precautionary measure amid protests elsewhere.  “We want to find a way in future of settling these sorts
of wage disputes in a way that isn’t detrimental or harmful or
leads to violence or lawlessness,” Scott said.  Wages at Lonmin “didn’t particularly lag” behind rivals
and “weren’t particularly at the top,” Scott said. He agreed
to boost workers’ pay by 11 percent to 22 percent from Oct. 1 to
help end the strike.  To contact the reporter on this story:
