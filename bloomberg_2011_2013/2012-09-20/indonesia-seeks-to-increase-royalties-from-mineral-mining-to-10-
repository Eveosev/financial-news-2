Indonesia  has asked metal mining
companies including the local units of  Freeport-McMoRan Copper &
Gold Inc. (FCX)  and  Vale SA (INCO)  to raise royalties to 10 percent.  The government is seeking higher payments as part of
negotiations to extend the companies’ mining contracts, Deputy
Energy and Mineral Resources Minister Rudi Rubiandini said. PT
Freeport Indonesia currently pays 1 percent as royalty for
mining gold and 3.5 percent for copper.  “Ten percent is the proper rate for royalties,”
Rubiandini said in an interview yesterday. “We will sit with
them again and discuss this. It’s part of the renegotiation.”  Indonesia formed a team in January to review mining
contracts and consider raising the state’s share. The group has
until December 2013 to conclude the review, according to a
decree signed by President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono on Jan. 10.
Coal mining companies in Indonesia pay 13.5 percent as royalty
and the government is seeking to bring mineral miners to a
similar level, Rubiandini said.  Fourteen mining companies have agreed to raise the
royalties and are waiting for the government’s approval, he
said.  Freeport Indonesia operates the Grasberg mine in the Papua
province, which contains the world’s largest recoverable copper
reserves. The mine accounted for 19 percent of the parent’s
revenue last year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
