South Korea ’s consumer inflation
may ease to below 2.7 percent this year, Bank of Korea board
member Lim Seung Tae said, reiterating a projection made by the
central bank in July.  “Our inflation forecast may be lowered in October,” Lim
told reporters in Seoul today. “The global and domestic
economic environment has changed drastically and thus many are
changing their economic outlooks.”  Quantitative easing measures taken by major advanced
countries pose a challenge to the South Korean economy and to
policy makers, Lim said. Lim was the sole dissenter when the
central bank decided to cut the benchmark seven-day repurchase
rate to 3 percent in July, according to minutes released on Aug.
