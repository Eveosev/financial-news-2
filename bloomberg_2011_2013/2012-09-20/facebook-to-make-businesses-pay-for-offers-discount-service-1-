Facebook Inc. (FB) , owner of the world’s
largest social network, will begin requiring business clients
that use its Offers service to purchase advertisements, seeking
to generate sales from a feature that had been free.  Businesses that take advantage of Offers, which include
discounts on products and services, will now have to create an
ad to place them, the company said in an e-mailed statement. The
change should make Offers more relevant to users when they see
them in their news feeds on Facebook’s website.  “Businesses will still be able to run Offers for a minimal
budget, but ads must be created in order for people to see
Offers in their news feeds,”  Menlo Park , California-based
Facebook said in the statement.  Facebook is under pressure from investors to wring more
advertising revenue from its more than 950 million users as it
grapples with mounting competition from rivals such as  Google
Inc. (GOOG)  and  Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO)  Facebook is expected to lose its No. 1
ranking for display-based advertising to Google in the U.S. this
year,  according  to EMarketer Inc.  As part of the changes to Offers, Facebook also will let
businesses add a bar code or some other type of code, the
company said. This will enable businesses to better track
results of the Offers, which Facebook debuted earlier this year.  Facebook declined 3 percent to $22.59 at the close in New
York. The stock has dropped 41 percent since Facebook sold
shares for $38 apiece in an initial public offering in May.  To contact the reporter on this story:
