National support for renewable
energy, such as guaranteed electricity prices, is one of the
biggest threats to the European Union’s goal to create a single
power market by 2014, according to  RWE AG. (RWE)   So-called national capacity mechanisms may also affect
energy prices and undo the results of market coupling, bringing
about a re-fragmentation of the internal market, William
Webster, head of European power market design and regulation at
RWE, said today at a conference in  London .  Capacity markets allow utilities to fix prices for
guaranteeing backup power supply in advance, boosting margins
for gas- and coal-fired plants as renewables output rises.  “We won’t see a single European price by 2014,” Webster
said. “The European Commission would be happy to see day-ahead
price-coupling and a functioning intraday market for power.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
