German 10-year bunds stayed higher
after a report showed an index of euro-area services and
manufacturing output contracted more than estimated in
September.  The nationâ€™s 10-year rate was four basis points lower at
1.58 percent as of 9:05 a.m. London time.  A composite index based on a survey of purchasing managers
in both industries in the 17-nation euro area fell to 45.9 from
46.3 in August, London-based Markit Economics said today. The
median estimate of 23 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News
called for a reading of 46.6. A reading below 50 indicates
contraction.  To contact the reporter on this story:
