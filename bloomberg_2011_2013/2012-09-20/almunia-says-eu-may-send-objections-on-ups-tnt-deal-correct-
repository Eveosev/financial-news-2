(Corrects third paragraph to remove reference to number of
companies in market.)  United Parcel Service Inc. (UPS) , the
world’s biggest package-delivery company, may receive a formal
complaint from European Union antitrust regulators over its bid
for TNT Express NV, the bloc’s competition chief said.  Joaquin Almunia , the EU’s competition commissioner, said it
was “possible” that the agency may send a so-called statement
of objections to the companies.  “We are in phase 2, it will be a deep investigation,” he
told reporters in New York today. He said he was analyzing
concerns that the deal could cut the number of large operators
in the industry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
