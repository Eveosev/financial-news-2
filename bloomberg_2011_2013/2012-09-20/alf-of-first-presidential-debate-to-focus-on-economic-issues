Three of the six segments of the
first debate between Republican presidential nominee  Mitt Romney 
and President  Barack Obama  will focus on the economy, moderator
Jim Lehrer announced yesterday.  The debate, scheduled for Oct. 3 at the University of
Denver in Colorado, will also address health care, governing and
the role of government, said Lehrer, who is moderating the first
of three exchanges between the candidates sponsored by the
bipartisan Commission on Presidential Debates.  The 90-minute debate will be broken up into six 15-minute
segments, and Lehrer said the topics could change because of
news developments.  Four years ago, the second of the three debates between
Obama and Republican nominee Senator  John McCain  of Arizona drew
the largest audience, 63.2 million, according to Nielsen. The
first debate drew the smallest audience, 52.4 million. The vice-
presidential debate between  Joe Biden  and Sarah Palin outdrew
the presidential nominees, attracting a record 69.9 million
viewers, according to Nielsen.  Even so, the first debate “has greater potential to
benefit the challenger than the incumbent because it places both
on equal footing and gives the challenger a chance to
demonstrate competence,” said Kathleen Hall Jamieson, director
of the Annenberg Public Policy Center at the University of
Pennsylvania.  To contact the reporter on this story:
