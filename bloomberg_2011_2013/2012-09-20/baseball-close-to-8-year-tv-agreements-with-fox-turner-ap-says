Major League Baseball is close to
signing eight-year television agreements through 2021 with Fox
Entertainment Group Inc. and Turner Sports Inc., the  Associated
Press  reported, citing a person familiar with negotiations.  News Corp. (NWSA) ’s Fox will keep the rights to the  World Series 
and a league championship series every year, the person said,
according to AP. The contracts may be signed before the
postseason begins, it reported.  Baseball’s receipts from the two networks are likely to
double to an average of about $800 million annually, with Fox’s
share at $500 million, the AP said. Last month, ESPN signed a
deal that will pay MLB about $700 million a year through 2021.  Fox, which broadcasts a Saturday regular-season game each
week under its current deal, will have additional regular-season
rights under the new contract, AP said. Turner will televise a
championship series each year, two division series and 13
regular-season Sunday broadcasts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
