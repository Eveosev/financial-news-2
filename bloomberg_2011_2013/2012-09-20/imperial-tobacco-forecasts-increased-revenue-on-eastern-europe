Imperial Tobacco Group Plc (IMT) , the
maker of West and Davidoff cigarettes, forecast higher full-year
sales, helped by growth in Eastern Europe.  Net revenue from tobacco will probably increase about 4
percent excluding currency shifts in the 12 months through
September, the Bristol, England-based company said today in a
statement. That beat the median of nine estimates in a Bloomberg
News survey. Results will be in line with the company’s
expectations, the maker of Gauloises Blondes said.  Imperial’s shares have fallen almost 5 percent this month
on reports that Russia and France plan to impose greater
restrictions and taxes on smokers. The government in the U.K.,
where Imperial is the market leader, has said it is considering
banning logos from cigarette packaging, following legislation
passed by Australia that takes effect Dec. 1.  The total volume of tobacco sold by the producer will
probably decrease as much as 3 percent in the 12-month period,
Europe’s second-biggest tobacco company said, hurt by lower
sales of cigarettes in Ukraine and fine cut tobacco in  Poland  as
well as trade sanctions against  Syria . Analysts polled by
Bloomberg expect a 2 percent decline.  Imperial Tobacco  is
scheduled to report full-year results on Oct. 30.  To contact the reporter on this story:
