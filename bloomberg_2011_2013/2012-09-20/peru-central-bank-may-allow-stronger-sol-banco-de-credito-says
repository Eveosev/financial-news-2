Peru ’s sol is likely to strengthen
as much as 4 percent by the end of next year as the central bank
tolerates greater appreciation amid rising foreign investment,
according to  Banco de Credito del Peru. (CREDITC1)   The sol may rally to 2.55 per  U.S. dollar  this year and
trade stronger than 2.50 next year on rising foreign direct
investment and demand for the country’s bonds, said Juan Odar,
an economist at Banco de Credito, the nation’s largest lender.  Policy makers seek to create more volatility in the spot
market by buying dollars when the sol depreciates as well as
when it appreciates, central bank President Julio Velarde said
Sept. 14. The bank, which has bought a record $10.6 billion in
the  spot market  this year to stem gains in the sol, will no
longer attempt to halt the appreciation and will allow larger
swings in the currency in an effort to damp local demand for
credit in dollars, Odar said in a phone interview from Lima.  “People who borrow in dollars should assume a bit of the
currency risk because up to now it seems they didn’t take that
into account,” he said. “Greater volatility implies greater
caution on the part of whoever’s taking credit in dollars.”  The sol was little changed at 2.6030 per U.S. dollar at
1:12 p.m. in Lima, according to Deutsche Bank AG’s local unit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
