Thailand’s three-year government
bonds advanced and the baht retreated from near a five-month
high before data that economists predict will show declining
overseas sales.  Exports fell 5.9 percent in August, the biggest slide this
year, after a drop of 4.5 percent in July, according to the
median estimate of analysts in a Bloomberg survey before a
government report due Sept. 24 or Sept. 25. International
investors pumped $658 million into sovereign notes this week
through yesterday, according to  data  from the Thai Bond Market
Association. Three-year debt from the Southeast Asian nation
yielded 2.87 percentage points more than Treasuries.  “Exports are a concern amid weak global demand,” said
 Tsutomu Soma , manager of the investment trust and fixed-income
business unit at Rakuten Securities Inc. in  Tokyo . “Bonds in
 Asia  will probably receive a lot of funds due to their relative
safety and higher yields.”  The yield on the 3.625 percent bonds due May 2015 dropped
one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 3.22 percent as of
8:34 a.m. in Bangkok, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The baht lost 0.1 percent to 30.82 per dollar, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The currency touched 30.66 on Sept.
17, the strongest level since March 27. One-month implied
volatility, a measure of exchange-rate swings used to price
options, was unchanged at 4.27 percent.  Export growth this year may be lower than previously
forecast, according to minutes of the Bank of Thailand’s Sept. 5
meeting released yesterday. The monetary policy committee voted
3-2 to maintain the benchmark  interest rate  at 3 percent on that
day, with two members absent, they showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
