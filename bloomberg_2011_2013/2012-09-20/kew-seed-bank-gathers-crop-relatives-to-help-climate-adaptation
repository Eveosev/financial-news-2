(Corrects last paragraph of story published Sept. 20 to
show Kew will pass on wild crop species to pre-breeders.)  The U.K.’s Royal Botanic Gardens
Kew plans to start collecting wild relatives of 26 crop plants
in a partnership with the Global Crop Diversity Trust to prepare
for  climate change  in the future.  Climate change will likely cause a geographical shift and a
reduction in suitable growing ranges for many crops, Ruth
Eastwood, coordinator of Kew’s Crop Wild Relatives Project,
 wrote  on the Plantwise blog. Genetic traits of wild crop
varieties have been used to breed resistance against pest and
disease, as well as drought and cold, she wrote.  Without climate adaptation, future potato yields are
predicted to drop by as much as a third, according to Eastwood.
Climate conditions also contribute to the spread of pests and
disease, making the outlook “bleak,” she wrote.  Crop wild relatives “are important because unlike most of
our major crops, they have not been subject to genetic
bottlenecks and they are distributed across a diverse range of
habitats,” Eastwood wrote on Plantwise, a blog maintained by
plant disease and pest researcher CABI.  Kew’s Millennium Seed Bank Partnership will collect the
species and pass them to so-called pre-breeders, who will grow
the wild crop relatives and select them for certain traits,
according to Eastwood. The project targets the wild relatives of
crops including alfalfa, cowpea, eggplant, potato, rice and
wheat, she wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
