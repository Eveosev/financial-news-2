The U.S. asked Russia to extend to
next May an Oct. 1 deadline for the aid agency  USAID  to halt its
Russian activities ,  Kommersant  said, without citing anyone.  Secretary of State  Hillary Clinton  made the request in a
letter to her Russian counterpart,  Sergei Lavrov , according to
the Moscow-based newspaper. The U.S. Embassy in Moscow didnâ€™t
immediately respond to a request for comment.  The Russian Foreign Ministry said yesterday that the
closure of USAID was justified because the agency was
interfering in domestic politics by sponsoring civil-society
groups and seeking to influence elections. The move raised
tensions between the two countries and deepened a crackdown on
Russian nongovernmental organizations dependent on foreign
assistance.  To contact the reporter on this story:
