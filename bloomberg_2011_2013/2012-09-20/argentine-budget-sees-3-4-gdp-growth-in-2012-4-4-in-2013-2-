Argentina ’s economy will expand by
4.4 percent in 2013 after growing 3.4 percent this year,
promising payments to holders of securities linked to economic
growth for the next two years.  South America ’s second-biggest economy has to expand at
least 3.3 percent this year and 3.2 in 2013 to trigger a payment
to owners of warrants tied to the gross domestic product. Growth
was 2.5 percent in the first half of the year, Economy Minister
Hernan Lorenzino said.  “Argentina’s economy continues growing in an economic
international context where some important regions in the world
are in recession,” Lorenzino said in a presentation of the 2013
budget proposal to Congress. “Domestic consumption and
investment will fuel the country’s growth next year.”  President  Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner  has stimulated
domestic consumption this year by condoning average wage
increases of 25 percent and raising pension payments and
handouts to poor families as demand from  Brazil , the country’s
main trade partner, slowed. In the second quarter, expansion
slowed to 0.5 percent from a year earlier, according to the
 median estimate  of 10 economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  The national statistics agency will report second-quarter
GDP at 4 p.m. local time tomorrow .  Warrants tied to economic growth have risen 21 percent in
the past month to 13.28 cents as of 2:06 p.m. local time.  Debt Payments  Debt payments will rise to 55.6 billion pesos ($11.9
billion) in 2013 from 45.1 billion pesos this year. The
government will spend as much as $8 billion of the central
bank’s international reserves to pay debt in 2013, according to
the budget plan. This year it plans to draw $5.7 billion of
reserves after using $7.5 billion of the funds in 2011.  “This is bread for today, hunger for tomorrow,” said
opposition lawmaker Alfonso Prat-Gay, a former central bank
president. “The $24 billion in reserves that have been taken
won’t come back ever again. The government is paying debt
issuing pesos, paying debt with inflation.”  Tax revenue will increase 23 percent, enabling the
government to obtain a budget surplus of 0.02 percent of gross
domestic product in 2013, compared with a deficit of 1.58
percent of GDP this year, Lorenzino said.  Government spending  will continue to rise, boosting
domestic consumption, Lorenzino said. According to the bill
posted on Congress’s website today, Fernandez will increase
spending by 16 percent to 628.6 billion pesos.  Record Harvest  A record grains and soybean harvest will boost next year’s
 trade surplus , which will widen to $13.3 billion from $12.2
billion in 2012, Lorenzino added.  The peso will have an average value of 5.1 per dollar,
compared with 4.68 per dollar today, while  consumer prices  will
rise 10.8%, according to the budget proposal.  The International Monetary Fund’s board of directors this
week gave Argentina until Dec. 17 to respond to concerns about
the quality of its official inflation and GDP data. If the
deadline is missed, the board can issue a declaration of
censure, a warning that has never been used and that means
sanctions may be applied if the concerns aren’t addressed.  Since former President  Nestor Kirchner  replaced staff at
the national statistics institute, known as Indec, in 2007,
Argentina has reported average inflation of 8.8 percent a year,
versus the 23 percent rate estimated by independent economists.  “The only international lender in the world that still has
doubts about the statistics in Argentina is the IMF,” Prat-Gay
said. “All the other ones and even government officials know
that Indec lies.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
