India ’s 10-year sovereign bonds
gained, pushing the yield to a two-week low, as speculation the
government will lose its majority increased the allure of safer
investments such as government debt.  Trinamool Congress ministers will be pulled from the
federal cabinet on Sept. 21 over policy changes announced last
week,  Mamata Banerjee , leader of the second-largest party in the
governing coalition, said on Sept. 18. The central bank said
Sept. 17 it would cut the amount of  cash  lenders must set aside
as reserves to 4.5 percent from 4.75 percent, effective Sept.
22.  “The political uncertainty is supporting debt
investment,” said Srinivasa Raghavan, an executive vice
president of treasury at  Dhanlaxmi Bank Ltd. (DHLBK)  in Mumbai. “The
prospect of further monetary easing will also support bonds.”  The yield on the 8.15 percent notes due June 2022 fell one
basis point to 8.16 percent, the lowest level since Sept. 6, in
Mumbai, according to the central bank’s trading system.  Prime Minister  Manmohan Singh ’s government announced Sept.
14 that it would permit overseas investors to own 51 percent in
retail ventures and buy as much as a 49 percent stake in the
nation’s airlines, while also increasing diesel prices for the
first time since July 2011.  Asia ’s third-largest  economy  expanded 5.5 percent in the
three months through June 30, compared with the 5.3 percent
growth in the previous quarter that was the least since 2009.
Raghavan predicted the monetary authority will cut the
repurchase  rate  by 25 basis points to 7.75 percent at a review
on Oct. 30 to support expansion.  One-year  interest-rate swaps , or derivative contracts used
to guard against fluctuations in funding costs, were unchanged
at 7.71 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
