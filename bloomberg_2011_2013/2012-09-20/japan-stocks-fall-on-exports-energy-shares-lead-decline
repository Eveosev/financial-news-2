Japan   shares  fell the most in three
weeks as the yen rose and the nation’s exports declined for a
third month, adding to signs of global slowdown. Stocks extended
losses on China manufacturing data pointing to a contraction.  Canon Inc. (7751) , a camera maker that gets 80 percent of its
sales abroad, fell 3.2 percent.  Inpex Corp. (1605) , Japan’s top oil
explorer by market value, slid 3.5 percent after crude fell to a
six-week low.  Komatsu Ltd. (6301) , a construction-equipment maker that
gets 15 percent of sales in China.  The Nikkei 225 fell 1.6 percent to close at 9,086.98 in
 Tokyo , the biggest decline since Aug. 31. Volume on the gauge
was almost 25 percent above the 30-day average. The broader
 Topix (TPX)  Index slid 1.4 percent to 753.81, with almost five shares
dropping for each that gained. The yen advanced amid speculation
Japan’s central bank is lagging global stimulus efforts.  “Investors are keeping their eyes on monetary policy from
the U.S., European Central Bank and Bank of Japan,” said  Naoki
Fujiwara , who helps oversee $6.7 billion at Shinkin Asset
Management Co. in Tokyo. “Currency markets have a big impact on
earnings at Japanese companies.”  The Topix rebounded 8.4 percent from this year’s low on
June 4 as central banks around the world took measures to
stimulate growth. The price of shares on the gauge stood at 0.9
times book value, compared with 2.3 times for the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index and 1.5 times for the  Europe  Stoxx 600 Index. A
number less than one means that companies can be bought for less
than the value of their assets.  Futures on the  S&P 500  slid 0.4 percent today. The gauge
gained 0.1 percent yesterday after sales of existing U.S. homes
rose more than expected and the  Bank of Japan  boosted stimulus.  BOJ Easing  Japan’s central bank yesterday unexpectedly expanded its
asset-purchase target by 10 trillion yen to 55 trillion yen,
seeking to avoid a further slowdown in the world’s third-largest
economy. The move followed last week’s decision by the  Federal
Reserve  to buy mortgage-backed securities until the U.S. labor
market recovers. The European Central Bank earlier agreed to
unlimited government bond purchases to fight the debt crisis.  The yen appreciated to as high as 78.05 against the dollar
today in Tokyo, compared with 79.17 at the close of  stock
trading  yesterday. Against the euro, Japan’s currency climbed to
101.38 from 103.57. A stronger yen cuts overseas income at
Japanese companies when repatriated.  “The yen strengthened because foreign investors think the
BOJ’s latest stimulus isn’t keeping pace with the Fed’s third
round of quantitative easing and the  European Central Bank ’s
monetary policy,” Shinkin Asset Management’s Fujiwara said.  Canon lost 3.2 percent to 2,771 yen. Kyocera Corp., an
electronic components maker that earns almost a third of its
revenue from the U.S. and Europe, sank 3.2 percent to 6,700 yen.  Exports Decline  Japan’s exports fell 5.8 percent in August from a year
earlier, a third straight decline, as a territorial dispute with
China and weak global demand cloud the outlook for shipments.  Diplomatic tensions with China have escalated since Japan
purchased islands claimed by both nations. Nissan Motor Co. had
halted production at two plants in China while Panasonic Corp.
reported damage to its operations as protesters smashed store
fronts and cars. Fast Retailing Co. plans to reopen its clothing
shops there today.  Stocks linked to  China  fell on data showing that the
nation’s manufacturing may contract an 11th month in September,
adding to signs that the world’s second-biggest economy is
decelerating for a seventh quarter.  Komatsu slipped 3.1 percent to 1,619 yen. TDK Corp., a
manufacturer of electronic parts which gets more than 25 percent
of its revenue from China, declined 3.2 percent to 3,135 yen.  China Manufacturing  The HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics purchasing
managers’ index showed a preliminary reading of 47.8 from a
final reading of 47.6 last month. If confirmed, the data would
extend the gauge’s longest streak below the expansion-
contraction dividing line of 50 in the survey’s eight-year
history.  “The manufacturing data may have been affected by the
anti-Japanese protests,” Satoshi Nishitsugu, a senior
strategist at Okasan Securities Co. in Tokyo.  Energy shares declined the most among the Topix’s 33
industry groups after crude oil for October delivery lost 3.5
percent to $91.98 a barrel in  New York  yesterday, the lowest
settlement since Aug. 3 and the biggest drop since July 23.  Inpex sank 3.5 percent to 479,000 yen, while refiner JX
Holdings Inc. slipped 2 percent to 432 yen.  Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp., Japan’s top fixed-
line phone company, gained the most on the  Nikkei 225 (NKY) , rising
7.1 percent to 3,855 yen after NTT said it plans to spend as
much as 150 billion yen ($191 million) buying back up to 3.4
percent of its shares.  To contact the reporter on this story:
