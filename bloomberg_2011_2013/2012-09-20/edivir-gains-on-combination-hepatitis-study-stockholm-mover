Medivir AB (MVIRB) , a Swedish medical
research company, rose the most in over two weeks in  Stockholm 
trading after the company said it will perform a mid-stage
combination study with its hepatitis C treatment simeprevir.  The shares rose as much as 4.7 percent, the biggest jump
since Sept. 3. Medivir had increased 4 percent to 72 kronor as
of 12:07 p.m. local time.  The aim of the phase IIa study is to see how many patients,
suffering from chronic hepatitis C infection of genotype 1a or
1b, will be virus free 12 weeks after treatment, Stockholm-based
Medivir said today in a statement. Simeprevir, which is
developed jointly with Johnson & Johnson’s  Janssen Research &
Development Ireland (JNJ) , will be combined with Janssen’s non-
nucleoside inhibitor TMC647055.  “This study is in line with Medivir’s and Janssen’s
strategy to evaluate different combination possibilities with
simeprevir for interferon-free HCV treatments,” Medivir’s head
of Research and Development  Charlotte  Edenius said in the
statement. “This will broaden our understanding of
simeprevir.”  Simeprevir, or TMC435, is currently undergoing a late stage
study for treatment of chronic hepatitis C, Medivir said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
