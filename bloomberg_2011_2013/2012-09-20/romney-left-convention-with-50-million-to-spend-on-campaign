President  Barack Obama , buoyed by small-dollar donors and high-tech industry employees, raised more money last month than Republican challenger  Mitt Romney , who was boosted by  Wall Street  contributors.  Obama’s campaign entered the general election race with $88.8 million in cash, compared to $50.4 million for Romney coming out of the  Republican National Convention . The president raised $84.8 million in August, while Romney raised $66.6 million and borrowed an additional $20 million secured by general-election campaign donations -- most already in the bank -- to pay expenditures until he officially became his party’s nominee at the convention.  In total, Obama has raised a total of $441.3 million for his re-election to $283.6 million for Romney, who used some of his cash to pay bonuses to his top aides. The figures are based on disclosures filed yesterday with the  Federal Election Commission .  When national political parties and allied super-political action committees are included, though, Romney entered September with more cash to spend on his side than Obama, $165 million to $101 million.  The  Republican National Committee  overcame Romney’s campaign fundraising deficit, bringing in $35.6 million last month and entering September with $76.6 million in the bank. The  Democratic National Committee  raised just $5.6 million and reported taking an $8 million loan, finishing the month with $7.1 million in cash.  Party Money  The disparity between the parties’ national committee accounts is largely because the Democrats -- with an undisputed nominee -- have already been investing in swing-state voter turnout initiatives.  The DNC has distributed $60.7 million this year to state parties, most of it in presidential swing states, while the RNC has transferred $15 million. In  Ohio , which no Republican has ever won the White House without carrying, the DNC transferred more than $2.5 million last month to the state party. The RNC gave just over $550,000.  Obama, meanwhile, spent $66 million on ads last month, more than tripling Romney’s $18 million.  Romney Bonuses  The Romney campaign made payments totaling more than $200,000 to at least nine senior campaign staff members that supplemented their regular salaries. Political director  Rich Beeson  received $37,500 and campaign manager Matt Rhoades, policy director Lanhee Chen and communications director  Gail Gitcho  were among six aides who each received $25,000. Two others got $10,000 each. All of the payments were made Aug. 31, the end of the monthly reporting period and the day after the Republican convention ended.  A co-founder of the Boston-based private-equity firm  Bain Capital  LLC, Romney has relied on financial support from Wall Street. His eight biggest sources of contributions in August came from financial-services employees, according to a Bloomberg News computer-assisted analysis of FEC data.  Leading the way were employees of  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) , who have been Romney’s biggest source of campaign donations and contributed another $172,780 last month. Since he announced his candidacy last year, Romney has received $848,860 from Goldman employees and their families.  Bank of America  In August,  Bank of America Corp . employees gave $118,900 to Romney, while employees at  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  contributed $116,004 and those working at Bain Capital donated $73,470.  Obama, too, went back to his base. Employees of  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)  and  Google Inc. (GOOG) , his two biggest corporate sources of campaign contributions, were counted among his top two donors in August. Employees at Google gave $177,305 and those at Microsoft contributed $116,659, the computer analysis showed. Obama also raised $25.1 million in amounts of $200 or less.  Restore Our Future, a super-political action committee that takes unlimited donations and backs Romney, raised $7 million and spent $21 million last month -- more than during the three previous months combined.  The super-PAC, which had about $6.3 million in cash on hand at the end of August, had raised $96.7 million and spent $90.3 million for the 2012 election, based on the latest reports.  Top contributors last month, each for $1 million, included Odyssey Re Holdings Corp. in  Stamford , Connecticut, and Robert Parsons, founder and executive chairman of GoDaddy.com Inc.  American Crossroads  The other major pro-Romney super-PAC, American Crossroads, founded with the help of former President  George W. Bush ’s chief political adviser  Karl Rove , raised $9.4 million, the most in any month this year. The group has now brought in $56.8 million for the 2012 elections.  Houston homebuilder Bob Perry contributed $2 million, bringing his total to $6.5 million for the 2012 elections and to $13.5 million since September 2010.  American Crossroads spent $6.9 million last month, bringing its total to $25.5 million, and ended August with $32 million cash on hand.  Priorities USA Action, a pro-Obama super-PAC, raised $10.1 million in August, the first month it surpassed Restore Our Future. The group founded by former aides to the president has now raised $35.6 million for the 2012 election.  The super-PAC spent $9.5 million in August, its biggest- spending month to date, and $30.8 million in total. It began September with $4.8 million in the bank.  Priorities USA Action received $2 million from James H. Simons, a founder of Renaissance Technologies LLC, an investment firm in East Setauket,  New York , and $1 million from Houston lawyer Steve Mostyn, who’s now given more than $2 million to the super-PAC.
