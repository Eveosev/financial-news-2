The ruble dropped the most in
almost two months as crude oil,  Russia ’s main export earner,
declined for a  fourth day and a report signaled the global
economy is slowing.  The ruble depreciated as much as 1.5 percent, the biggest
intraday drop since July 23, before trading 0.5 percent lower at
31.3542 at 4 p.m. in Moscow. The currency has weakened 2.9
percent in four days, heading for its first weekly decline in
three weeks.  Oil dropped to a six-week low in  New York  as reports
signaled economies are slowing in  Asia  and  Europe . Euro-area
services and manufacturing output fell to a 39-month low in
September and Chinese manufacturing probably contracted for an
11 month, according to reports from London-based Markit
Economics and HSBC Holdings Plc. Oil and gas contribute about 50
percent of Russia’s state revenue.  “In the near future, the ruble can lose the advantage it
gained over the past weeks, following the resumed decline in  oil
prices ,” ZAO Raiffeisenbank said in an e-mailed note today.  Non-deliverable forwards showed the ruble at 31.8782 a
dollar in three months compared with 31.6875 yesterday.  The ruble gained 0.4 percent against the euro to
40.5875. The moves against the dollar and the euro left the
currency 0.1 percent weaker the central bank’s target basket.  The extra yield investors demand to own Russia’s dollar
bonds over U.S. Treasuries rose five basis points to 198,
according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s EMBI Global Index. An index
of five-year government bond yields compiled by Micex fell four
basis points to 7.588 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
