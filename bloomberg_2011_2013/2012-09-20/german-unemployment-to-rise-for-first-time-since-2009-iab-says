German  unemployment  will increase
for the first time since 2009 next year as the debt crisis in
the euro area leaves its mark on the region’s biggest economy,
the Federal Labor Agency’s IAB research institute  said .  The average number of unemployed people will rise by 37,000
to 2.93 million in 2013 from this year, the IAB said in a report
published today. The German economy will expand 0.8 percent in
2013, compared to 0.6 percent in 2012, it said.  “For years, the labor market has seen a positive trend,
which was only interrupted briefly by the global financial
crisis,” the institute said. “A lot points to the fact that
this process is coming to an end now.”  The pace of expansion in the German economy eased to 0.3
percent in the second quarter from 0.5 percent in the first as
budget cuts and recessions in euro-area trading partners eroded
demand for German exports. At the same time, investor confidence
in September rose for the first time in five months after the
 European Central Bank  unveiled a plan to buy  government bonds  to
stem the sovereign debt crisis.  To contact the reporter on this story:
