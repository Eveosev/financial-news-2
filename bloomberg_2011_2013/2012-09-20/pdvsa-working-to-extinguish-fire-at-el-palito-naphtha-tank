Petroleos de Venezuela SA, the
state oil company, is trying to extinguish a fire at a naphtha
tank at its El Palito refinery after putting out another fire at
a different tank, Oil Minister  Rafael Ramirez  said.  The fires were triggered by lightning that struck a seal on
the two tanks at 7:30 p.m. yesterday during a rainstorm, Ramirez
said in a telephone call broadcast last night on state
television. Two trucks were using fire-fighting foam to
extinguish the second fire, Ramirez said.  “I mean to clarify that it’s not an explosion or a fire at
the refinery,” Ramirez said. “It’s a situation at the refinery
that happens whenever there are these electrical storms.”  A gas leak at the country’s Amuay refinery, the country’s
largest, caused an explosion Aug. 25, engulfing nearby homes and
a National Guard post in flames and killing 42 people.
Firefighters worked for four days to extinguish flames at
 storage tanks  holding refined products. Nine tanks were damaged.  President  Hugo Chavez , who is seeking re-election in
October, ordered a probe into the accident and declared three
days of mourning.  To contact the reporter on this story:
