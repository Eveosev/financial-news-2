Peru ’s sol-denominated bonds rose,
pushing down yields for a sixth straight day, as the  Federal
Reserve  expanded monetary stimulus fuels demand for higher-
yielding, emerging market assets.  The yield on the nation’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol-
denominated bond due August 2020 fell four basis points, or 0.04
percentage point, to a record low of 4.21 percent, according to
prices compiled by Bloomberg. The price climbed 0.27 centimo to
123.98 centimos per sol.  The yield has dropped 21 basis points since Sept. 13 when
the Fed said it will make open-ended purchases of mortgage debt
until the economy recovers and keep the benchmark  interest rate 
near zero until at least mid-2015. Peru’s economic growth and an
overnight rate of 4.25 percent is a draw for foreign investors,
said Diego Alvarez, a trader at Banco Internacional del Peru.  “The monetary stimulus is having a positive impact on the
belly of the curve,” Alvarez said by phone from Lima. “The
gains in the long end are smaller because investors are
expecting a steepening in the Treasury curve given the outlook
for inflation.”  Fed Bank of Dallas President  Richard Fisher  said the U.S.
central bank’s third round of bond purchases will probably fail
to create jobs while risking faster inflation.  The sol was little changed at 2.6030 per  U.S. dollar , from
2.6020 yesterday, according to Deutsche Bank AG’s local unit.  Peru’s central bank bought $20 million in the spot currency
market today and paid an average of 2.6030 soles per U.S.
dollar, it said on its website.  The yield on the nation’s benchmark 6.55 percent dollar-
denominated bond due March 2037 fell seven basis points, or 0.07
percentage point, to 3.71 percent, according to Bloomberg
prices. The bond’s price rose 1.38 cent to 145.50 cents per
dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
