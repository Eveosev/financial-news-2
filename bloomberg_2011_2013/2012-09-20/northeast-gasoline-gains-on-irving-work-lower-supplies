New York  gasoline rose for a second
day as Irving Oil Corp. repaired units at its Saint John
refinery in New Brunswick and inventories in the Northeast
dropped to a 22-month low.  The work “within select areas of the refinery” is
expected to be completed over the next few weeks and there are
no production delays or issues with supply, Lesley Dickson, an
Irving spokeswoman, said in an e-mail yesterday.  The 298,800-barrel-a-day refinery exports more than half of
its production to the U.S. Northeast, according to the company’s
website. Total gasoline stockpiles in  New England , or the Energy
Department’s PADD 1A region, fell to 2.7 million barrels, the
lowest level since November 2010, according to Energy Department
data.  The premium for reformulated, 87-octane gasoline, or RBOB,
in New York Harbor increased 3 cents to 19.5 cents a gallon
versus futures traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at
3:02 p.m. Prompt delivery increased 10.54 cents to $3.099 a
gallon.  “There’s not much cushion in the RBOB system up in the
Northeast,” said  Andy Lipow , president of Lipow Oil Associates
LLC in Houston.  Stocks of RBOB on the East Coast, including PADD 1A,
dropped 1.91 million barrels to 14.1 million last week, the
lowest level since October 2008, according to the Energy
Department.  To contact the reporter on this story:
