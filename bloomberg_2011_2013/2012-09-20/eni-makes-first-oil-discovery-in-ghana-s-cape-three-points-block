Eni SpA (ENI) , Italy’s largest oil
company, made the first crude discovery in Ghana’s Offshore Cape
Three Points block, opening the prospect of increased production
in the West African country.  The company found oil 50 kilometers (31 miles) off Ghana at
a well drilled to a depth of 3,650 meters (12,000 feet). The
Sankofa East-1X well produced about 5,000 barrels of oil per
day, Eni said in a statement today.  “Eni plans for the immediate drilling of other wells to
delineate the size of the discovery and confirm the feasibility
of commercial development,” said the Rome-based company, which
has operated in Ghana since 2009.  Eni is also working on its plans to commercialize the
block’s gas reserves on the domestic gas market, in accordance
with the shareholders’ agreement with Ghana’s ministry of
energy.  After the December 2010 start of oil production for export
at the Jubilee field, operated by  Tullow Oil Plc (TLW) , Ghana’s
economy grew 14.4 percent in 2011, the fastest pace in Africa,
according to the  International Monetary Fund . Growth is forecast
at 9.4 percent this year according to the  Finance Ministry .  The country’s revenue from oil climbed 43 percent to $326.6
million in the first half of the year, with output averaging
62,985 barrels a day, according to a Bank of Ghana report from
August. Output is expected to rise “in excess of” 90,000
barrels by the end of the year.  The OCTP block is operated by Eni, with a 47 percent stake
in the project, Vitol Upstream Ghana Ltd., which has 38 percent,
and state company GNPC, which has 15 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
