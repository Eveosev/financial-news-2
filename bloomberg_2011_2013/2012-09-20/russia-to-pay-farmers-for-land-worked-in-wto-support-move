Russia ’s  Agriculture Ministry  will
support farmers with payments for every hectare (2.47 acres) of
land they work to ease their membership in the World Trade
Organization and help them pay off loans, according to the
country’s Grain Union.  The ministry identified “increasing financial stability of
agriculture producers” and “food independence” as priorities
in its agriculture development program for 2013, and through
2020, and will start per-hectare payments to farms from next
year, said Arkady Zlochevsky, the union’s president.  The government will pay 207 to 900 rubles ($6.59 to $28.64)
per hectare to grain and vegetable farmers, depending on output
volumes and climate conditions, he told reporters today in
Moscow.  Russia became the 156th member of the  World Trade
Organization  last month after completing almost two decades
of negotiations, marking the biggest step in global trade
liberalization since  China  joined a decade ago. The Russian plan
complies with WTO rules on farm support, Zlochevsky said. The
payments will partly replace subsidized  interest rates  for
farmers, the main support mechanism in the previous agriculture
program from 2008 through 2012, he said.  Russia may provide 15 billion rubles in per-hectare
payments next year, rising to 38 billion rubles in 2020,
Zlochevsky said, citing the ministry’s sector support program
for 2013-2020.  The support may help pay off debts in the agricultural
sector, Zlochevsky said. Agricultural companies have 1.7
trillion rubles of debt, compared with the sector’s annual
revenue of 1.4 trillion rubles, he said. The debt includes 400
billion rubles of bad loans, or those that are seen as hardly
payable, he said.  Pork, Poultry Output  The previous five-year support program produced mixed
results in addition to the debt burden, according to the union.
Pork and poultry production rose as planned, while targets on
milk output and technological efficiency weren’t achieved,
Zlochevsky said.  As a result of new support measures, Russia is targeting an
increase in cereals output to 115 million metric tons and grain
exports to 30 million tons by 2020, Zlochevsky said, citing the
ministry’s program. Last marketing year, the grain crop was 94.2
million tons and exports were a record 27.2 million tons,
according to ministry data.  Russia may lose 188 billion rubles next year and 257
billion rubles in 2014 as a result of lower  import duties 
stemming from WTO membership, Economy Minister Andrei Belousov
told lawmakers before the July 10 vote to ratify the accession.
The figure may reach 300 billion rubles by 2015 as the average
duty level drops to 6 percent from about 9.5 percent, he said.  Among concessions Russia won in its WTO talks was the right
to channel as much as $9 billion a year into agricultural
subsidies during a transition period, up from more than $5
billion at present, according to Belousov.  To contact the reporter on this story:
