Billionaire Bidzina Ivanishvili
asked the  European Court  of  Human Rights  to rule on the loss of
his Georgian citizenship as he prepares to challenge the ruling
party at Oct. 1 parliamentary elections.  Ivanishvili, whose wealth Forbes magazine puts at $6.4
billion, filed a suit against the Black Sea nation’s government
today, according to an e-mailed statement from his Georgian
Dream party.  “Georgian Dream believes the Georgian government action
was part of a deliberate effort to maintain its grip on power
and undermine the democratic choice of the people of Georgia,”
according to the statement.  Ivanishvili’s citizenship was revoked last year after he
entered politics to take on President Mikheil Saakashvili’s
United National Movement in a bid to become prime minister.  While  Georgia  allows dual citizenship, the billionaire, who
was already a Georgian and Russian subject, forfeited his right
to Georgian citizenship when he obtained a third, French,
passport, the Justice Ministry ruled. He has renounced his
Russian citizenship.  Ivanishvili may be able to reclaim his citizenship by
directly petitioning the president, but he hasn’t done so,
Manana Manjgaladze, a spokeswoman for Saakashvili, said last
year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
