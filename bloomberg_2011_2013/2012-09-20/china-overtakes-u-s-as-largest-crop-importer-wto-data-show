China passed the U.S. last year for
the first time to become the biggest importer of agricultural
products and also increased its exports, according to  data  by
the  World Trade Organization .  Imports, including food and beverages, rose 34 percent to
$144.7 billion in 2011 from $108.3 billion in 2010, according to
Bloomberg calculations based on data released by the Geneva-
based trade body. Exports gained 25 percent to $64.6 billion,
beating Canada to become the sixth largest, the data show.  Growth in the second-biggest  economy  and largest population
has boosted demand from soybeans and corn to feed livestock to
powdered milk and sugar to make beverages. Urbanization widened
China’s water and land shortages, further fueling a global rally
in crops amplified by drought-reduced supply.  “Whether it’s rice, wheat or soybeans, China’s needs are
huge and they are only going to get bigger, because it can’t
produce enough while urbanization is still progressing,” said
 Li Qiang , the Shanghai-based chairman of commodity researcher
Shanghai JC Intelligence Co. The country generally favors
importing unprocessed crops to raise animals rather than
processed products, he said.  The U.S. has long been a net exporter of crops, while
China’s shipments, while growing, are smaller than its imports,
Li said. China’s had a net-import bill last year of $80.1
billion, while the U.S. recorded $31 billion in net exports,
according to Bloomberg calculations based on WTO data.  China will more than double soybean  imports  since 2005 to
58 million tons in the marketing year ending Sept. 30, taking
about 60 percent of total global trade, according to data by the
 U.S. Department of Agriculture . Last year, imports of rice
jumped 58 percent from 2010 while sugar purchases gained 65
percent, according to  China  customs data.  Soybeans on the Chicago Board of Trade have gained 38
percent this year while corn has advanced 16 percent amid the
worst drought affecting the Midwest since 1936. Soybeans reached
a record $17.89 a bushel on Sept. 4, while corn touched an all-
time high of $8.49 on Aug. 10.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
