Serbia’s government will adopt
further measures to ensure the 2013 budget deficit goal of 3.5
percent of gross domestic product is reached, Finance Minister
 Mladjan Dinkic  said.  The Balkan nation needs to find new financing sources to
avoid paying high yields on domestic debt and will seek
multilateral loans, including an 850 million-euro ($1.1 billion)
credit from the Export-Import Bank of China, Dinkic told a
conference in Belgrade today.  “We need to change sources of financing because domestic
financing is the most expensive and the least productive as it
crowds out the private sector,” he said.  Torn apart by the Balkan wars waged by former President
 Slobodan Milosevic  in the 1990s, Serbia is now in a battle to
reduce the army of unemployed  getting agitated with a jobless
rate exceeding the levels of Spain and  Greece , home to the
longest out-of-work lines in the European Union.  With one in four Serbs out of work, Dinkic said the
government will enact measure to increase labor-market
flexibility.  To contact the reporter on this story:
