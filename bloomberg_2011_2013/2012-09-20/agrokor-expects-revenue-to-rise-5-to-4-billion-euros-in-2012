company, expects revenue to rise 5 percent to 4 billion euros
($5.18 billion) this year.  Agrokor, which owns Croatian retailer Konzum d.d. and ice-
cream maker Ledo d.d., sees about 800 million euro sales in
neighboring  Serbia  where it owns supermarket chain  Idea d.d .,

its bid for  Mercator Poslovni Sistem d.d.  to expand retail
