The most ancient branch of
anatomically modern humans are the Khoe-San of southwestern
 Africa , an ethnic group who speak languages characterized by
frequent clicks.  Genomic evidence places their geographical isolation from
other humans at around 100,000 years ago, even before the human
migration from Africa to Europe and Asia, according to a study
published today on the website of the Washington-based  Science
magazine . Today they live mainly in Namibia, South Africa and
Botswana.  The study, which tested the DNA of 220 people from 11
southern African populations, showed that the Khoe-San’s genetic
divergence pre-dates the “out of Africa event” of about 70,000
years ago when anatomically modern humans migrated to Europe and
Asia, Mattias Jakobsson, one of the researchers, said on a
conference call yesterday. The khoe-San have traditionally lived
a nomadic, hunter-gather lifestyle while some became herders.  Scientists from  South Africa ,  Sweden , the U.S. and  France 
studied approximately 2.3 million samples of DNA from each
individual. The Khoe-San’s genetic makeup differs from that of
other southern African populations, like the Bantu-speakers, a
broad group of languages that includes South Africa’s Zulu and
Shona of  Zimbabwe , according to the study.  “The Khoe-San retained their ancestral genomes,” Himla
Soodyall, a researcher on the study from Johannesburg-based
 University of the Witwatersrand , said in a conference call
yesterday. “They drifted and remained isolated until 3,000 to
3,500 years ago when they came into contact with West
Africans.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
