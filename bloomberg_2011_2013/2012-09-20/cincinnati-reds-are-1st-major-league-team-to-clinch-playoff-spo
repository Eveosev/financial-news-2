The Nationals became the first
Washington baseball team to reach the postseason in 79 years,
joining the  Cincinnati Reds  as the first two clubs to clinch
2012 playoff spots.  The Nationals (91-58), who have the best record in Major
League Baseball, defeated the visiting Los Angeles Dodgers 4-1
last night to clinch the National League East division title or
one of the NL’s two wild-card spots.  “It’s been a long time since we’ve had a chance to play
even one game in the playoffs,” Nationals third baseman  Ryan Zimmerman , who has been with the team since 2005, said in an on-
field interview. “I can remember being out of it in July and
August.”  Earlier in the day, the Reds (91-59) won 5-3 at the  Chicago
Cubs  to become the first MLB team to assure itself of a
postseason spot. The Reds lead the NL’s Central division.  The Nationals are the first Washington team to make the
postseason since the 1933 Senators won the American League
pennant and then lost the  World Series  in five games to the  New
York Giants .  The Senators failed to make the postseason for the
following 27 years and moved to Minnesota after the 1960 season
to become the Twins.  An expansion team, also called the Senators, never advanced
beyond the regular season while playing 1961-71 in Washington.
That club moved to Texas and became the Rangers.  There was no major league franchise in Washington from 1971
until 2005, when the Montreal Expos moved to the U.S. capital
and became the Nationals.  Washington’s ‘Natitude’  Zimmerman, 27, who was wearing a shirt celebrating the
team’s new “Natitude,” said the real goal is to win the NL
East and advance in the playoffs.  “This is kind of the pre-party, I guess you could say,”
he said. “Hopefully we’ll have a bigger party in a few days,
and an even bigger party later on in the year.”  The Reds played their second straight game without manager
 Dusty Baker , 63, who was hospitalized in Chicago after being
diagnosed with an irregular heartbeat.  Cincinnati General Manager Walt Jocketty visited Baker in
the hospital yesterday morning and talked to him after the
playoff-clinching victory.  “He’s in good spirits,” Jocketty told reporters. “He’s
happy the young guys came through.”  The  Atlanta Braves  (86-64), who did not play yesterday,
lead in the race for the NL’s first wild card. The St. Louis
Cardinals (80-70), who completed a three-game series sweep of
the Houston Astros with a 5-4 win yesterday, have a 2 1/2-game
lead over the  Milwaukee Brewers , a three-game margin over the
Dodgers (77-73) and a 4 1/2-game lead over the  Philadelphia
Phillies  for the second wild-card slot.  The Brewers (77-72) won 9-7 at the Pittsburgh Pirates
yesterday for their fifth straight win. The Phillies (76-74)
pounded out 21 hits in a 16-1 victory at the  New York  Mets.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
