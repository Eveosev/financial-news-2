The Arab Monetary Fund said it will
“soon” sign three new financing agreements with  Tunisia  and
one with Morocco.  The loans will bring its total contracted financing in 2012
to approximately $547 million, the Abu-Dhabi based fund said in
an e-mailed statement today. The fund said it granted loans to
Yemen and Jordan earlier this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
