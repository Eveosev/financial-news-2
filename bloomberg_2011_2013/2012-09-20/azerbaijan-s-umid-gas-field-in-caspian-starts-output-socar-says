State Oil Co. of Azerbaijan , or
Socar, started pumping natural gas from the Umid field in the
 Caspian Sea , company President Rovnaq Abdullayev said.  Daily production from the deposit, 40 kilometers (25 miles)
off the Azeri coast, is 1 million cubic meters of gas and 200
metric tons of condensate, or light oil, Abdullayev said today
in Baku.  Azerbaijan  announced the discovery of Umid, which means
Hope, in November 2010. It’s estimated to contain 200 billion
cubic meters of gas and 40 million tons of condensate, and is
among Caspian fields that may boost energy supplies to Europe as
the region seeks to reduce reliance on Russian fuel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
