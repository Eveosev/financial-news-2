(Corrects  tax rate  in first paragraph.)  The Argentine government will
charge a 19.1 percent tax rate for soybean biodiesel exports
during the next 15 days, deputy Economy Minister Axel Kicillof
said today in a press conference held in Buenos Aires.  President  Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner  announced
yesterday that from now on biodiesel exports will be charged a
variable tax rate linked to prices, saying the revision had been
requested by major producers of soybean biodiesel, such as Bunge
 Argentina  SA, Cargill Inc., Aceitera General Deheza SA, among
others.  Soybean biodiesel export taxes will be changed every 15
days, Kicillof said. The tax rate was set at 24 percent until
today. Argentina is the worldâ€™s largest exporter of soybean
biodiesel.  To contact the reporters on this story:
