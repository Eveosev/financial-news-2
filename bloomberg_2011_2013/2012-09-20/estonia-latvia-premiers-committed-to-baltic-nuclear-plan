Estonian Prime Minister  Andrus Ansip  and Valdis Dombrovskis, his Latvian counterpart, said
they’re “committed” to a nuclear power project in Lithuania.  Estonia needs to diversify its energy sources, as
dependence on electricity generation from shale-oil may become
costly because of  carbon emissions , Ansip said in a joint press
conference with Dombrovskis and Lithuanian Prime Minister
Andrius Kubilius in Vilnius today.  The Baltic region is seeking to cut its dependence on
energy imports from Russia by constructing a 1,300-megawatt
reactor in Visaginas, 150 kilometers (93 miles) northeast of
Vilnius. The Lithuanian government had intended to sign an
agreement with Japan’s  Hitachi Ltd. (6501)  to proceed with engineering
and preparation work; that was postponed when the country’s
legislature decided in July to hold a referendum on the matter.  Lithuania  plans to hold a preliminary stake of 38 percent
in the Visaginas facility, which would cost as much as $6.5
billion, according to initial estimates. Estonia may own 22
percent, while Latvia and Hitachi would each hold 20 percent.  The decision on whether to go ahead with the atomic plant
“is up to the Lithuanian people,” both Ansip and Dombrovskis
said. The referendum is scheduled for Oct. 14, along with a
general election.  “I will be disappointed if the answer is ‘No’,” Ansip
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
