NII Holdings Inc. (NIHD) , which sells
wireless service under the Nextel brand in  Latin America , rose
the most in six weeks after Chief Executive Officer Steve Dussek
boosted his stake by 12 percent.  NII rose 17 percent to $8.21 at the close in  New York , the
biggest jump since Aug. 6. The Reston, Virginia-based company’s
shares have  plummeted  61 percent this year as competition and
network spending cut into profits.  Dussek’s purchases may represent a show of confidence in
the company as it prepares to offer 3G, or third-generation,
services in Mexico, its second-largest market, said  Christopher King , an analyst at Stifel Nicolaus & Co. Dussek acquired 42,402
shares at $7 apiece yesterday, increasing his stake to almost
400,000 shares that include unvested, restricted stock,
according to a regulatory filing today.  “So many people have been waiting so long for some sign of
confidence, some positive development here,” said King, who
 advises  buying the shares, in a telephone interview today from
Baltimore.  Claudia Restrepo, a spokeswoman for NII, didn’t immediately
return a telephone message seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
