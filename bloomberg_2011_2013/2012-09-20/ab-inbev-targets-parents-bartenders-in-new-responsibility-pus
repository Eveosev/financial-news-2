Anheuser-Busch InBev NV (ABI) , the
world’s biggest brewer, said it will target parents and
bartenders as it boosts efforts to promote responsible drinking.  Websites including Mumsnet Ltd. in the U.K. and Facebook
Inc. in the U.S. will publicize a message for parents to discuss
alcohol consumption with their children, the brewer said in a
statement today. It’s providing training and identity-checking
devices to bartenders to counter underage drinking, and AB InBev
also expanded the parental responsibility campaign to  China , the
world’s biggest beer market.  AB InBev set six “ responsible drinking goals ” in 2011 to
be implemented globally by 2014. The brewer said it’s on pace to
reach at least 100 million adults with programs to help them
discuss alcohol consumption with their kids, and it spent almost
$55 million in 2011 in advertising responsible drinking. It
plans to spend at least $300 million in the three years through
2014.  Chief Executive Officer Carlos Brito is scheduled to join
staff from AB InBev tomorrow in its third annual beer
responsibility day, including an event in  New York ’s Times
Square where employees will approach adults asking them to
pledge to drink responsibly.  AB InBev is the world’s largest beermaker and sells brands
including Bud Lite and Beck’s. It reported revenue of $39.3
billion last year, and sold a total of 399.4 million hectoliters
of beverages globally. It agreed to expand its business by
buying full control of  Mexico ’s Grupo Modelo SAB, the maker of
Corona beer, in June for $20.2 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
