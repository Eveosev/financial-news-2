Vietnam ’s bonds declined, pushing
the five-year yield to the highest level in two months, as the
resignation of three Asia Commercial Bank executives highlighted
concern about instability in the nation’s financial industry.
The dong was steady.  The board at ACB, Vietnam’s biggest bank that isn’t owned
by the government, approved the exits of Chairman Tran Xuan Gia
and two vice-chairmen on Sept. 18, the lender said in a
statement yesterday. Police arrested the bank’s co-founder
Nguyen Duc Kien on Aug. 20 for allegedly “conducting business
illegally” and subsequently detained former Chief Executive
Officer Ly Xuan Hai for alleged economic mismanagement.  “Market sentiment is quite cautious now, given those
arrests and resignations of bank officials,” said Hoang Thanh Tam, head of the fixed-income department at Vietnam Maritime
Commercial Joint-Stock Bank in Hanoi. “Investors will hold off
to see how these events impact the financial sector and the
economy.”  The five-year yield rose three basis points, or 0.03
percentage point, to 10 percent, the highest level since July 19,
according to a daily fixing rate from banks compiled by
Bloomberg.  The dong traded at 20,870 per dollar as of 2:40 p.m. in
Hanoi, compared with 20,875 yesterday, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The central bank set its reference rate
at 20,828, unchanged since Dec. 26, according to its website.
The currency is allowed to trade as much as 1 percent on either
side of the fixing.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
