Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta
President  Dennis Lockhart  said the August jobs report was “far
from satisfactory” one week after the central bank announced
new stimulus measures to bolster the economy.  “The state of employment here and now and the immediate
outlook for jobs is front of mind for me and my colleagues,”
Lockhart said in the text of prepared remarks in Kansas City
today.  “In today’s labor market, the skills that matter most for
job finding and job keeping, as well as wage growth, encompass
abilities like critical thinking and analytical skills,”
Lockhart, who votes on the FOMC this year, said at a conference
at the Kansas City Fed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
