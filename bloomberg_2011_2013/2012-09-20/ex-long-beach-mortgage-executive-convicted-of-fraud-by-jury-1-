A former sales executive at
 Washington Mutual  Inc.’s subprime lending unit  Long Beach 
Mortgage was convicted of fraud by a federal court jury, the
U.S. said.  Joel Blanford, 44, was found guilty yesterday of six counts
of mail fraud for his involvement in a scheme to falsify loan
documents that earned him more than $1 million in commissions
from 2003 to 2005, U.S. Attorney Benjamin Wagner in Sacramento,
 California , said in an e-mail.  Blanford paid a loan coordinator in cash and checks to
falsify documents, provide false verification of borrowers’
employment or professional licensing status, and to turn a blind
eye to fraudulent representations contained in loan applications
and other documents submitted to Long Beach Mortgage,
prosecutors said. His commissions were based on the number of
loans the bank processed.  An earlier trial resulted in a hung jury. Sentencing is
scheduled for Dec. 10. The maximum penalty for mail fraud
affecting a financial institution is 30 years in prison and a
fine of as much as $250,000, or twice the value of the gain or
loss, whichever is greater.  Michael Cardoza, Blanford’s attorney, didn’t return a
voice-mail message yesterday seeking comment about the verdict.  From 2003 to 2006, Washington Mutual and its Long Beach
Mortgage unit increased mortgage securitizations from $4.6
billion to $29 billion, U.S. Senator  Carl Levin , a Michigan
Democrat, said in April 2010. In 2005, Long Beach was forced to
buy back $875 million of non-performing loans from investors. An
internal 2005 audit found that 83 percent of loans approved by
the bank’s Montebello, California, office were fraudulent, Levin
said, citing Washington Mutual e-mails.  Washington Mutual, based in Seattle, filed for bankruptcy
on Sept. 26, 2008, the day after its banking unit was taken over
by regulators and sold to  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  for $1.9 billion.  The case is U.S. v. Blanford, 08-00269, U.S. District
Court, Eastern District of California (Sacramento).  To contact the reporter on this story:
