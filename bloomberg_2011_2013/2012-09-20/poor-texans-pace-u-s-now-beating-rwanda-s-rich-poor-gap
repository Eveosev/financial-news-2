The annual snapshot of the U.S. by
the Census Bureau makes one thing clear: You don’t want to be a
female choreographer living in McAllen,  Texas , and renting your
home. On the plus side, the city’s Sun Belt location would put
you in a good position to be one of the small but growing number
of Americans using solar power for heat. Here are a few such
highlights from the 2011 American Community Survey of some 3.5
million households in places with more than 65,000 people:  EQUITY  Full-time female workers earn 79 cents for every $1 earned by
men. At the current annual gain of 0.4 cents, they will achieve
parity by mid-2063.  A government figure that measures the gap between rich and poor
shows U.S. income inequality has surpassed the level found in
 Rwanda  and is now double  Sweden ’s rate. The gap was highest in
the Naples-Marco Island,  Florida , metro area.  WORKING  Commutes lengthened to an average of 25.5 minutes.  The largest share of college graduates, more than 12 million
Americans, held business degrees, more than twice the 5.3
million people who majored in science or engineering fields.  Salaries fell or stayed flat in 339 of 526 occupations tracked
by the Census Bureau. The average salary for a dancer or
choreographer fell 32.5 percent to $24,419, the biggest drop
over the year.  Income fell 1.3 percent to $66,634 for 961,000 financial
managers, and dropped 4.3 percent to $70,421 for the nation’s
241,700 securities, commodities and financial services sales
agents.  Food-processing workers, who include slaughterhouse employees,
represented the fastest-growing occupation in the nation last
year. Their ranks grew to 94,600, a 51 percent increase from
2010, and salaries climbed 12.6 percent to a median of $31,400.  INCOME  Household income fell to $50,502 in 2011, a $1,045, or 2
percent, inflation-adjusted drop.  The nation’s capital remained home to the highest median
household incomes among U.S. metro areas. The Washington area
reported a median income of $86,680, a $378 drop from 2010.  Forty-two states reported declines in median household income.
The largest drop occurred in  Nevada , where the average household
suffered a $3,604 loss to $48,927.  Vermont  led the eight gaining
states, with a $1,888 increase to $52,776. Maryland remained
home to the highest-income households, with a median of $70,004.  The number of households making more than $200,000 grew to 4.3
percent, up from 3.9 percent. The number of households making
less than $10,000 climbed to 7.8 percent, up from 7.6 percent.  POVERTY  McAllen was the nation’s poorest metro area, with a poverty rate
of 37.7 percent. More than 1 in 3 of the Texas city’s
households, or 34.7 percent, reported receiving  food stamps , the
nation’s highest amount. McAllen took over the top poverty spot
from the Brownsville, Texas, metro area, which fell to No. 2
with a poverty rate of 34.1 percent. The Laredo, Texas, metro
area ranked third, with 32.9 percent of people living in
poverty.  Almost 21 million children lived in homes receiving government
disability, welfare or food stamp payments.  The price of bringing every poor American above the poverty line
became steeper, rising to almost $183 billion from the 2010
estimate of $170 billion.  HOMES  The median value of a U.S. home fell to $173,600, down 3.5
percent.  The number of traditional married-couple families continued to
fall further below majority status, dropping to 48.3 percent of
all U.S. households, down from 48.6 percent in 2010. The
percentage of married women fell to 46.6 percent from 47.1
percent in 2010.  The percentage of grandparents responsible for the full-time
care of their grandchildren fell to 38.7 percent, down from 39.1
percent in 2010.  Two  California  cities,  Newport Beach  and  Palo Alto , reported
median home values exceeding $1 million; 24 of the 25 cities
with the highest median home values were in California.  The lowest median home values were reported in Lumberton,  North
Carolina . Half of homes in the area close to the South Carolina
border were valued at $70,700, a 6.2 percent increase from 2007.  About 44 percent of renters reported paying more than 35 percent
of their income for housing; only 28.1 percent of owners said
they spent an equivalent amount.  The number of households that reported using solar power for
heat grew by about 7,500 to 49,000, an increase of 18 percent
over the 2010 tally. That still represents zero percent of the
nation’s 115 million households.  To contact the reporter on this story:
