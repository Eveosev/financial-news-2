Alberta oils for November delivery
weakened prior to refinery maintenance scheduled for the fourth
quarter in the U.S. midcontinent that may cut demand.  BP Plc (BP/) ’s Whiting, Indiana, plant, the Midwest’s largest,
will shut a crude unit known as Pipestill 12 starting Nov. 1 for
work scheduled to last 100 days, a person familiar with the
maintenance said April 19.  HollyFrontier Corp. (HFC)  will idle the
90,000-barrel-a-day West plant in Tulsa,  Oklahoma , starting in
November for work scheduled to last about five weeks, a person

$5.75 a barrel to $8 above West Texas Intermediate at 11:50 a.m.
in  New York , according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
