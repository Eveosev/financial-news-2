Trading of derivatives used to bet
on or hedge shipping costs will plunge 53 percent by value in
2012 after charter rates fell to the lowest level in more than
three years, according to Freight Investor Services Ltd.  The value of forward freight agreements bought and sold
will decline to $7 billion, estimates by the London-based
freight and commodity broker show. It projected a 6 percent
slide in the number of the contracts traded to 940,000, which
would be the fewest since the 511,000 tallied for 2006,
according to the  Baltic Exchange .  The steeper drop in the value of trading reflects the slump
in hire costs, which in March reached the lowest level since
December 2008 as the fleet of mineral- and grain-carrying ships
expanded amid slowing demand. Trading is down 14 percent in 2012
by volume, less than the drop of about 42 percent in year-to-
date average rates for Capesize ships, John Banaszkiewicz,
managing director at FIS, said by phone Sept. 17.  “The FFA market is alive and kicking,” he said at a
conference in Amsterdam on Sept. 14. “We have volatility and we
have liquidity.”  Each contract represents 1,000 metric tons of cargo or a
day’s charter of a ship. FFA volumes are reported by brokers to
the London-based  exchange , which provides assessments of freight
rates against which the contracts are settled.  Contract Defaults  Trading is down by about half since 2008 after the collapse
in shipping rates led to contract defaults. Almost all FFAs are
now cleared through clearing houses rather than settled by
counterparties in the over-the-counter market, according to
Banaszkiewicz. Investors bought and sold contracts worth $15
billion last year and $30 billion in 2010.  This year’s trading will equate to about 1.8 billion tons
of freight, including 380 million tons in the form of options,
Banaszkiewicz predicted. Amounts are calculated using a formula
that measures tonnage of commodities carried daily for each of
the four classes of dry-bulk vessels tracked by the exchange,
FIS analyst  Peter Norfolk  said by phone yesterday.  FFA trading this year came to 639,800 contracts as of Sept.
14, figures from the exchange showed, against 747,600 lots a
year earlier. Daily returns for Capesizes, the biggest commodity
carriers, averaged about $5,923 this year through Sept. 13,
compared with $10,370 a year earlier, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  Traders still need to manage freight risk even though lower
hire costs reduced the shipping component of commodity prices,
according to Banaszkiewicz. More cargoes are linked to daily
spot prices, rather than fixed-price contracts between
shipowners and customers lasting three to five years, he said.  “More and more people will need to lock in that risk,
banks, traders or charterers,” Banaszkiewicz said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
