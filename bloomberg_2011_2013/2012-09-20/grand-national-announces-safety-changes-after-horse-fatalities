The  Grand National , the world’s
most famous steeplechase, will implement a number of changes
after two horses were fatally injured at the race in April.  The start position will be moved forward 90 yards, away
from the crowd and grandstands at Aintree Racecourse in
northwest  England , the British Horseracing Authority (BHA) said
in a  statement  on its website following a review of the events
in the spring.  The Grand National, one of the biggest betting events in
the U.K. horseracing calendar, will be shortened to 4 miles
and 3 ½ furlongs from 4 ½ miles (7.2 kilometers). The BHA said
it would also take measures to prevent horses from getting
caught up in the starting tape.  “Our objective in recommending changes to the start is
to identify ways in which we can create a calmer and more
controlled environment for both horse and rider,” Jamie Stier,
director of raceday operations and regulation for the BHA, said
in the statement. “We recognize that there is pressure and
tension before the race and we want to alleviate that where
possible.”  The BHA won’t change the height of the fences or reduce the
40-horse field, even after calls to do so from animal rights
groups.  In April’s race, Neptune Collonges made a late charge to
beat Sunnyhillboy by a nose. Cheltenham Gold Cup winner
Synchronised and According to Pete were both put down after
sustaining injuries as only 15 horses reached the finish line.  Ten horses have been killed in the Grand National in the
past 12 years, according to the BHA.  To contact the reporter on this story:
