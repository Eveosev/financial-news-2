Mexico ’s currency held near a one-
week low as U.S. jobless claims were higher than projected,
dimming the outlook for the Latin American nation.  The peso was little changed at 12.8598 at 4 p.m. in Mexico
City, hovering near the weakest level since Sept. 12.  Mexico’s currency has rallied 8.4 percent this year, the
best performance among the greenback’s 16 most-traded
counterparts tracked by Bloomberg. It gained 1.5 percent on
Sept. 13, when the  Federal Reserve  announced a third round of
asset purchases known as quantitative easing.  “Before the Fed announced QE3, bad data were taken as
positive because they increased the probability of an economic
stimulus package,” Roberto Galvan, a currency trader at
Intercam Casa de Bolsa SA, said by phone from Mexico City.
“Nowadays bad data is back to being bad.”  Jobless claims in the U.S., the top destination for Mexican
exports, decreased by 3,000 in the week ended Sept. 15 to
382,000, Labor Department figures showed today. The median
forecast of 49 economists surveyed by Bloomberg projected
375,000 claims.  Separate reports showed euro-area services and
manufacturing output fell to a 39-month low in September and
 China ’s manufacturing probably contracted for an 11th month.  The Fed said Sept. 13 it will expand its holdings of long-
term securities with open-ended purchases of $40 billion of
mortgage debt a month.  The yield on peso bonds due in 2024 fell five basis points,
or 0.05 percentage point, to 5.58 percent, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The price rose 0.48 centavo to 139.13
centavos per peso.  To contact the reporter on this story:
