Canada’s Candu Energy Inc., owned
by  SNC-Lavalin Group Inc. (SNC) , is holding talks with Turkey about
building the country’s second nuclear plant, the Anatolia news
agency reported, citing Energy Minister  Taner Yildiz .  Yildiz said a bidder from Japan,  South Korea  or China may
emerge as the front-runner by the end of this month, according
to Anatolia. Talks with Candu are continuing at the technical
level today following a meeting with senior officials yesterday,
Yildiz said, the agency reported.  “The result of this race will be clear at the end of this
month,” the agency quoted him as saying in the central
Anatolian city of Kayseri.  Turkey is planning to build the second facility by 2023 at
Sinop on the Black Sea coast. Russia is to build Turkey’s first
atomic plant at Akkuyu on the Mediterranean.  To contact the reporter on this story:
