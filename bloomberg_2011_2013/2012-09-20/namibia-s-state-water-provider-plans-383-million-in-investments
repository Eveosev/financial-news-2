Namibia  Water Corp., the country’s
state-owned water provider, plans to invest about N$3.2 billion
($383 million) over five years on infrastructure, including a
desalination plant on the coast, the New Era newspaper reported.  Namwater Chief Executive Officer Vaino Shivute said at a
water conference in Windhoek that the utility, which derives
most of its revenue from tariffs, would provide about half the
funds, with the rest coming from sources including the
government, the New Era newspaper reported.  Areva SA (AREVA)  opened Namibia’s first desalination plant two
years ago. Water and power demand has increased in the southern
African country following a boom in uranium exploration and
mining.  To contact the reporter on this story:
