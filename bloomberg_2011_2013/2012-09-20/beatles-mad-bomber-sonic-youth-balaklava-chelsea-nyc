“Paul -- you wanted to play
Tripoli in 1969. Inshallah, you will play in a free  Libya 
soon!”  The Paul is McCartney and the text is embroidered on the
Libyan flag’s green and red stripes. It refers to a canceled
Beatles tour in North Africa in 1969 -- and more recent events
in the region.  In “The Breakup” exhibition at the  Lombard Freid Gallery ,
conceptual artist Michael Rakowitz draws parallels between the
dissolution of the Beatles and political events in the  Middle
East  in the late 1960s and early 1970s. It includes video and
audio footage as well as music and political memorabilia in
glass vitrines.  In one, the album cover for “A Hard Day’s Night” is
flanked by covers for recordings of Israeli Prime Minister David Ben Gurion and Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser.  Another display shows maps of  Jerusalem  and the English
town of Liverpool, a stone from the Western Wall and a piece of
brick from the Cavern Club in Liverpool, where the Beatles honed
their talents.  “They performed 292 times there between 1961 and 1963,”
Rakowitz wrote with a black marker on the glass surface.  Prices range from $4,000 to $35,000. The show runs through

entering  Anna Kustera Gallery .  Both emanate from a messy worktable overflowing with wires,
wax, old newspapers, electric drills, pliers, nails, chalk, duct
tape and empty beer cans.  The installation, “Worktable #9 ( Minneapolis ), he of
Righteousness,” simulates “the lair of a mad bomber,”
according to the press release. It’s the highlight of Gregory
Odell Green’s unsettling new exhibition, “The Second Principle
of History,” which tackles themes such as terrorism and
religious fanaticism.  Another object in the show is a 1908 Bible, opened to
reveal a black-and-white illustration and a bomb cut into the
pages. The title: “Biblebomb #1908.”  Framed in dark wood, “MATT.-V-44” is an illuminated Bible
page from the Gospel of Matthew. “Love Your Enemies” is
splayed across the surface in a large font while a smaller
typeface provides instructions on how to build a nuclear bomb.  Prices range from $2,500 to $40,000. The show runs through

 http://www.annakustera.com   Sonic Youth  An exhibition at  303 Gallery , just a few doors west, brings
together multimedia pieces by Karen Kilimnik and Kim Gordon, a
founder of the rock band Sonic Youth.  The show is sparsely installed and has a rebellious
sentiment. It feels like someone or something has been bouncing
off the walls, with black paint smears and crude writings in red
ink left on otherwise clean white surfaces.  Gordon’s three-channel video “Proposal for a Dance” is
projected on a wall and features two female performers in
Rodarte dresses and two electric guitars. They are making lots
of noise, whipping the instruments and rolling around on the
floor. Shots of a loud crowd appear on a separate channel, as if
the audience were present and at once disconnected from the
show.  Kilimnik’s video features black-and-white footage of
British female pop band Bananarama. The terrible quality of the
image underscores the cheesy content. Her 1992 “Blood
Drawings,” done in viscous red ink, are oddly immediate and
expressive.  Prices range from $30,000 and $100,000 for Kilimnik,
$12,000 and $18,000 for Gordon. The exhibition runs through

 http://www.303gallery.com .  Balaklava Swimming  “Balaklava Drive,” Moscow-based Sergey Bratkov’s 2009
black-and-white video at  Leo Koenig Inc. , shows lanky teenage
boys jumping excitedly into the water from a pier in the Black
Sea town once known as Balaklava.  Set to a quiet, nostalgic tune, the video can be watched
from an elevated platform, which recalls seaside promenades and
Soviet-era podiums. A pile of rocks, pieces of cement and broken
pipes on the floor by the screen allude to destruction.  The town of Balaklava, the site of a battle between the
British and Russian forces during the Crimean War, gave its name
to the headgear most recently favored by Pussy Riot.  Bratkov’s video is an edition of five; price: 20,000 euros
($26,118). “Balaklava Drive” runs through Oct. 20 at 541 W.
23rd St.; +1-212-334-9255;  http://www.leokoenig.com .  Muse highlights include Lance Esplund on  art  and Jeffrey
Burke on  books .  To contact the reporter of this story:
