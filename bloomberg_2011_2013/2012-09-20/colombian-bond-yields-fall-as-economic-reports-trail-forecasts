Yields on  Colombia ’s peso bonds
held near a two week high on reduced bets policy makers will cut
borrowing costs after a report showed the Andean nation’s
economy grew faster than expected in the second quarter.  The yield on Colombia’s 9.25 percent peso-denominated debt
due in May 2014 was little changed at 4.95 percent, according to
the central bank. It rose to 4.96 percent on Sept. 18, the
highest since Sept. 5. The yield had fallen earlier after
government reports yesterday fueled bets for an interest-rate
cut.  Colombia’s economy grew 4.9 percent in the second quarter
from a year earlier, its fastest pace in a year, the national
statistics agency said today. The average estimate of 29
economists surveyed by Bloomberg was for growth of 4.2 percent.  “The economy is showing it doesn’t need further
stimulus,” said Carmen Salcedo, an analyst at financial
services holding company Corp. Financiera Colombiana, known as
Corficolombiana. She predicts the central bank will leave the
overnight lending rate unchanged at 4.75 percent through year-
end.  Banco de la Republica will hold its next monetary policy
meeting Sept. 28.  The peso erased an earlier decline, gaining 0.2 percent to
1,794.03 per  U.S. dollar . It has gained 8.1 percent this year.  Colombia is worried about the strength of the peso, Finance
Minister  Mauricio Cardenas  told reporters in Bogota today. The
Treasury is ready to resume its intervention in the foreign
exchange market to weaken the local currency, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
