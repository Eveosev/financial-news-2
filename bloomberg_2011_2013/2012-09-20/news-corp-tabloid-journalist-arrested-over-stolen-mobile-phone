News Corp. (NWSA) ’s British publishing
unit said a journalist at its Sun tabloid, the best-selling
daily title in the U.K., was arrested in a probe into the
handling of stolen mobile phones.  London police arrested a 30-year-old journalist today over
a suspected conspiracy to take data from stolen phones and later
released him on bail without identifying him.  Daisy Dunlop , a
spokeswoman for News Corp.’s U.K. subsidiary, News
International, said in an e-mail the man works at the Sun.  The probe is part of Operation Tuleta, the Metropolitan
Police Service’s investigation into computer hacking and phone
theft by journalists. The probe was spawned by the evidence
uncovered in related phone-hacking scandal at News Corp.’s now-
defunct News of the World tabloid.  To contact the reporter on this story:
