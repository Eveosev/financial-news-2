Japanese and Australian stock
futures rose as investors speculated central-bank action to
stimulate growth will be enough to offset signs of weakening
economic expansion from Asia, to Europe and the U.S.  American Depositary Receipts  of  Sharp Corp. (6753)  rose 0.3
percent as the Mainichi newspaper reported  Intel Corp . is in
talks to invest more than 30 billion yen ($383 million) in the
Japanese TV maker. Shares of  Yaskawa Electric Corp. (6506) , a Japanese
industrial-robot manufacturer, may be active as Credit Suisse
Group AG advised buying the shares.  GrainCorp Ltd. (GNC) , eastern
Australia’s largest grain handler, may gain after JPMorgan Chase
& Co. upgraded the shares to overweight.  Futures on Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average expiring in
December closed at 9,035 in Chicago yesterday, up from 8,990 in
Osaka, Japan. They were bid in the pre-market at  9,030 in Osaka
at 8:05 a.m. local time. Futures on Australia’s S&P/ASX 200
Index advanced 0.3 percent today. New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index was
little changed in Wellington.  “Global central banks have done all in their power to
rescue the financial markets from the doldrums,” said  Gerard Minack , a Sydney-based strategist at Morgan Stanley. “Investor
positioning remains underweight, and putting money back in the
markets could lead to a self-fulfilling grind higher. Our
overall caution stems first and foremost from a belief that the
macro environment will not improve in the near term.”  Annual Gain  The  MSCI Asia Pacific (MXAP)  Index rose 7.6 percent this year
through yesterday as central banks in Europe, China, the U.S.
and Japan took action to stimulate growth. The Standard & Poor’s
500 Index has increased 16 percent and the Stoxx Europe 600
Index has gained 12 percent. The Asian benchmark traded at 12.7
times estimated earnings compared with 14.1 for the S&P 500 and
12.1 for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.  Futures on the  S&P 500 Index  advanced 0.1 percent today.
The gauge slid yesterday for the third time in four days as data
from in the U.S., China, Europe and Japan increased concern that
a global economic slowdown is worsening.  In the U.S., more Americans than forecast filed
unemployment claims last week and a gauge of leading indicators
fell in August, report showed yesterday. Manufacturing in the
Philadelphia region shrank for a fifth straight month in
September. In Europe, euro-area services and manufacturing
output fell to a 39-month low in September.  The  Bloomberg China-US Equity Index (CH55BN)  of the most-traded
Chinese shares in the U.S. sank 1.6 percent to 91.27 yesterday
after a manufacturing index signaled production may contract for
an 11th month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
