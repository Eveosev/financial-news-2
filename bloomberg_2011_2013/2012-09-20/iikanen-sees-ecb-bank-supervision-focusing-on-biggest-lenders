European Central Bank Governing
Council member Erkki Liikanen said cross-border bank supervision
in the euro area will focus on lenders with international
operations and significant presence in the bloc.  National watchdogs will have an important role supervising
the bulk of banks, Liikanen said in an interview published by
the Helsinki-based newspaper Demokraatti.  “We have to get to a situation in which banks can operate
profitably, financing the economy, companies and households,
while also managing their own profits and losses without
involving society and taxpayers,” Liikanen said, according to
the Social Democratic Party-owned newspaper. “Shareholders must
bear the brunt of the risk. It’s the owners’ task to ensure
banks operate in a way that avoids losses.”  Making the ECB bank supervisor in the euro area wouldn’t
mean compromising the independence of the Frankfurt-based
central bank in monetary policy, said the newspaper, citing
Liikanen.  To contact the reporter on this story:
