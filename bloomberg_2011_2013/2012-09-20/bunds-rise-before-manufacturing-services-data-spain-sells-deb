German  government bonds  rose for a
fourth day as demand declined at a Spanish auction of three-year
notes, underpinning demand for the euro area’s safest assets.  Ten-year  bunds  extended their daily rally to the longest
this month after a euro-area report showed services and
manufacturing output dropped to a 39-month low in September.
Spanish bonds halted this week’s advance that had been driven by
optimism the country will seek financial aid. Finland’s bonds
gained even as  Standard & Poor’s  said the nation risks losing
its AAA rating.  “Demand for safety remains well in place,” said  Michael Leister , a fixed-income strategist at Commerzbank AG in  London .
“German 10-year yields hitting 1.8 percent is not as
straightforward as it looked last week.”  Germany’s  10-year yield  fell five basis points, or 0.05
percentage point, to 1.57 percent at 4:12 p.m. London time. The
1.5 percent bond due in September 2022 rose 0.44, or 4.40 euros
per 1,000-euro ($1,295) face amount, to 99.325. The four-day
gain is the longest since the period ended Aug. 28.  Spain sold 3.94 billion euros of new benchmark notes due in
October 2015 at an average yield of 3.85 percent, compared with
3.68 percent at the previous auction on Sept. 6. Demand dropped
to 1.56 times the amount sold, down from a so-called bid-to-
cover ratio of 1.76 times. The country also sold 858 million
euros of 10-year bonds.  Spanish 10-year bonds also dropped after the auction, with
yields rising eight basis points to 5.78 percent.  Italy ’s 10-
year yields climbed seven basis points to 4.99 percent.  ECB Purchases  Spain’s 10-year yields have fallen around 60 basis points
since the close on Sept. 5, the day before European Central Bank
President  Mario Draghi  unveiled details of the ECB’s asset-
purchase plan, saying activation was dependent on countries
asking for help. The  Federal Reserve  said on Sept. 13 it would
buy mortgage securities to bolster the recovery.  “The longer Spain prevaricates in terms of requesting a
bailout the greater the chance that the bailout premium, as it
were, will be priced out of the market,”  Richard McGuire , a
senior fixed-income strategist at Rabobank International in
London, said on Bloomberg Television’s “The Pulse” with  Maryam Nemazee . “Yields will rise and the curve will flatten back,
forcing the government to make that request.”  Spanish bonds due in more than 10 years have been the best-
performing securities in the world this month, returning 11.5
percent, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the
European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. Similar-
maturity German bunds have been the second worst performers,
losing 4.4 percent, the indexes show.  Commerzbank Forecast  The additional bond purchases announced by the Fed and ECB
this month mean German 10-year yields may rise above
Commerzbank’s current year-end forecast of 1.70 percent as
demand for safety wanes, Leister said.  A composite index based on a  survey  of purchasing managers
in manufacturing and services in the euro area dropped to 45.9
from 46.3 in August, London-based Markit Economics said in an
initial estimate. A reading below 50 indicates contraction.  The euro area’s economy contracted by 0.2 percent in the
three months through June as fallout from the fiscal crisis
damped  consumer spending  and corporate investment. The region’s
unemployment rate is at a record 11.3 percent.  Volatility on Finnish bonds was the highest in euro-area
markets today, followed by Italy, according to measures of 10-
year or equivalent-maturity debt, the spread between two-year
and 10-year securities and credit-default swaps.  The Finnish government must stick to its budget-balancing
plans or face a downgrade of its top  credit rating , S&P said in
a statement.  Finland’s 10-year yield fell four basis points to 1.88
percent after rising to 1.98 percent on Sept. 17, the highest
since June 29.  To contact the reporters on this story:
