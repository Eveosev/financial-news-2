Ukraine’s hryvnia exchange rate
won’t move more than 2 percent in either direction in 2013,
according to Prime Minister  Mykola Azarov , who said there are
“no fundamental reasons” for the currency to depreciate.  Next year’s draft budget “envisages an average hryvnia
rate of 8.1 to 8.2 per dollar,” Azarov said in an interview
broadcast by the private Channel 5 television station.  The currency has lost 1.1 percent against the dollar this
year and traded little changed at 8.1328 as of 2:30 p.m. in the
capital, Kiev.  To contact the reporter on this story:
