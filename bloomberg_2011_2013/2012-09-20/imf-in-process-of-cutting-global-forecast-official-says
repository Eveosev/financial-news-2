The  International Monetary Fund 
will cut economic forecasts for the global economy “by a few
decimal points,” a fund official said today.  “The global economy has weakened, we are shaving off our
forecast for global growth by a few decimal points,” Khor Hoe Ee, an assistant director in the IMF’s Asia and Pacific
Department, said on a conference call with reporters. At the
same time, “we expect the global economy to recover gradually
over the next year.”  The most recent IMF forecast, released in July, projected
2012 global growth of 3.5 percent. The fund cut its estimate for
next year to 3.9 percent, from an April forecast of 4.1 percent.  IMF officials are due to release the new forecasts Oct. 9
amid signs growth is slowing in  emerging markets  that have been
driving global expansion. A Chinese manufacturing survey pointed
to an 11th month of contraction and  Japan ’s exports fell in
August, supporting the case for increased stimulus in the
region.  The IMF today reduced its growth forecast for  South Korea 
to 3 percent this year from a June estimate of 3.25 percent.  Khor, also the mission chief to  Korea , said the country’s
forecast will probably be cut further when the global forecasts
are released next month as slower demand worldwide hurts
exports.  -- Editors: Kevin Costelloe, Gail DeGeorge  To contact the reporter on this story:
