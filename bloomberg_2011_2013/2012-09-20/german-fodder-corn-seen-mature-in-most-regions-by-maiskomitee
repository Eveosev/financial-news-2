Germany â€™s silage corn is mature in
most regions after low rainfall in the past weeks boosted crop
development, industry group Deutsches Maiskomitee e.V. reported.  Dry matter content in plants has reached 34 percent to 39
percent in most regions south of Berlin, meaning the crop is
mature, the Bonn-based group wrote in a  report  on its website
today. Silage corn is used as fodder for livestock or as a
feedstock for biogas production.  To contact the reporter on this story:
