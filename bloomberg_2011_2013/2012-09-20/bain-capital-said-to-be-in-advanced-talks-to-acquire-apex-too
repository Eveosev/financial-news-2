Bain Capital  LLC is in advanced
talks to buy Apex Tool Group LLC, the maker of Craftsman hand
tools that is owned by  Danaher Corp. (DHR)  and  Cooper Industries Plc (CBE) ,
said a person with knowledge of the matter.  Bain may end up paying $1.5 billion to $1.8 billion for
Apex, said the person, who asked not to be identified because
the talks are private. While Boston-based Bain has emerged as
the lead bidder in the sale process, the talks could still
collapse, this person said.  Apex, based in Sparks,  Maryland , describes itself as one of
the world’s largest makers of hand and power tools. It has
dozens of its own brands, including GearWrench ratchets, and
makes some of the tools sold by Sears. Apex had net income of
$134 million on sales of $1.46 billion last year, according to a
Cooper regulatory filing. Apex employs 7,600 people, according
to its website.  Danaher and Cooper formed Apex in 2010 by combining their
tool businesses and naming Steve Breitzka, previously the head
of the Danaher tool unit, chief executive officer. Each has a 50
percent stake.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  is advising on the sale, people
familiar with the situation said in March.  Alex Stanton, a spokesman for Bain at Stanton Public
Relations & Marketing, didn’t respond to phone and e-mail
requests for comment. Calls made to Apex, Danaher and Cooper
after normal business hours weren’t answered.  The Wall Street Journal reported earlier that Bain is near
a deal to acquire Apex.
