KazMunaiGas Exploration Production (RDGZ) ,
the London-listed unit of  Kazakhstan â€™s state-energy company,
appointed Zhumabek Zhamauov as chief executive officer of its
Embamunaigas division.  The unit also named Abat Nurseitov as chairman at its first
board meeting in Atyrau today, KazMunaiGas EP said in an e-
mailed statement.  Embamunaigas, which pumps oil in western Kazakhstan, is one
of the two core oil-producing assets of KazMunaiGas EP.
Uzenmunaigas, the other, suffered labor strikes and violent
protests in 2011 as workers demanded higher pay. The disruption
underpinned a 7 percent drop in oil output at KazMunaiGas EP
over the year.  KazMunaiGas EP made Embamunaigas and Uzenmunaigas joint
stock companies this year on the instruction of Kazakh President
 Nursultan Nazarbayev .  To contact the reporter on this story:
