German  Chancellor Angela Merkel 
praised her former mentor and predecessor,  Helmut Kohl , saying
that she learned “an awful lot” about politics when she served
as a minister in his Cabinet.  Kohl was responsible for ensuring the political success of
German reunification, Merkel told television station Sat.1,
according to an e-mailed transcript of an interview to be
broadcast later today. Merkel served under Kohl as families
minister from 1991 to 1994, and then as environment minister
from 1994 to 1998.  “Looking back from today’s standpoint, it wasn’t always so
obvious that it would turn out to be so successful,” Merkel,
who grew up in communist East Germany, said of the 1990
reunification of East and West. As a result, Kohl has earned his
place in German history, she said.  “At the same time, I learned a lot from him about what the
business of politics entails,” she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
