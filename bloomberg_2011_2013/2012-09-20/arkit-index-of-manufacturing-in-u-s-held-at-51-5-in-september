The Markit Economics preliminary
 index  of U.S. manufacturing held at 51.5 in September from a
month earlier, the London-based group said today.  A reading of 50 in the purchasing managers’ measure is the
dividing line between expansion and contraction. The median
forecast in a Bloomberg survey of economists was 51.5. Estimates
ranged from 50 to 52.  The slowdown in global markets is keeping businesses from
placing more orders, limiting production. Weaker consumer
spending in the face of unemployment exceeding 8 percent and the
looming fiscal U.S. cliff of tax and government spending changes
are also dimming the outlook for U.S. manufacturing.  A Chinese manufacturing survey today pointed to an 11th
month of contraction, supporting the case for increased stimulus
as  Asia ’s growth slows. The preliminary reading was 47.8 for a
 China  purchasing managers’ index by HSBC Holdings Plc and
Markit, compared with a final level of 47.6 last month.  Euro-area services and manufacturing output fell to a 39-
month low in September as European leaders struggled to reverse
the single-currency bloc’s slide into recession.  A composite index based on a survey of purchasing managers
in both industries in the 17-nation euro area dropped to 45.9
from 46.3 in August, Markit said.  The Markit gauge of U.S. manufacturing debuted in May. The
company surveys purchasing managers in more than 30 countries
and regions, including Europe and China.  Markit’s preliminary purchasers figure is based on replies
from about 85 percent to 90 percent of those American
manufacturers who respond to the poll of the more than 600
companies surveyed.  Industrial production unexpectedly fell in August by the
most since March 2009, a report from the  Federal Reserve  showed
on Sept. 14.  To contact the reporter on this story:
