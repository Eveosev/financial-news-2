The president denounces the
 tax code  as “an outrage, one riddled through with special
privileges and inequities, that violates our most
fundamental American values of justice and fair play.”  His  Treasury secretary  agrees that the tax system is
“too complicated, it’s grotesquely unfair, and it’s a drag
on the economy because it discourages competition.”  Sound familiar? Those words were uttered by President
 Ronald Reagan  and his Treasury secretary, Donald Regan.
Similar sentiments have been repeated since the first
modern income tax became law in 1916.  For years, the federal government obtained most of its
revenue from a tariff supplemented by some excise taxes.
The income tax came into being for an obvious reason: The
federal government needed more money for an emergency. It
was first imposed during the Civil War and phased out
afterward. It was revived in 1894, only to be struck down
by the  Supreme Court . The 16th Amendment took care of that
objection.  From the very beginning, there were two opposing
camps. One school viewed the tax as strictly a revenue
vehicle and argued that it should be spread evenly across
the broadest-possible base. A second group argued that
industrialization had created a dangerous chasm between the
rich and everyone else, and that the income tax could
reduce that  gap  by placing the major burden on the
wealthiest citizens and the big corporations.  Battle Joined  Thus began the fight over a policy we know by the
cliche “soak the rich.” This clash extended to virtually
every form of taxation, including sales, estate, corporate
and excise levies.  President  Woodrow Wilson  opened the battle in 1916 by
supporting a highly progressive income tax to pay for
preparedness and later the fighting of World War I. His
backers also hoped to attack the deep-rooted problems of
special privilege, corruption and especially the
concentration of wealth. The Revenue Act of 1916
concentrated on the wealthiest taxpayers and doubled the
tax on corporate incomes (to a whopping 2 percent).  The  Republican Party  returned to power in the 1920s.
Treasury Secretary  Andrew Mellon , one of the richest men in
the U.S., spearheaded a rollback of taxes on corporations
and wealthy individuals. By 1928, the top marginal rate had
been cut to 25 percent from 73 percent and new loopholes
favored the rich.  The onset of the Great Depression in 1930, followed by
the election of  Franklin D. Roosevelt  in 1932, gave the
debate fresh impetus. Even before he took office, Democrats
shoved through the Revenue Act of 1932, which increased the
marginal rate to 63 percent from 25 percent. The Revenue
Act of 1935 raised the effective rate on the rich by 50
percent. Then came World War II, which required huge sums
of money.  The Revenue Acts of 1942 and 1943 revolutionized the
tax system. They broadened the base by lowering exemptions
and increased marginal rates to the highest level in
history. A surtax was imposed that rose from 13 percent on
the first $2,000 to 82 percent on income exceeding
$200,000. In 1945, the richest 1 percent of Americans paid
32 percent of the income taxes collected.  Deductions Proliferation  A dramatic shift had occurred. By 1950, the income tax
accounted for 51 percent of all taxes collected compared
with 16 percent a decade earlier. During the 1950s and
’60s, Congress gradually lowered the rate on top incomes.
Prosperity coupled with a growing population kept revenue
high despite a proliferation of  tax deductions . The onset
of stagflation during the 1970s ended this period of
relative calm as President  Jimmy Carter  denounced the tax
system as “a disgrace to the human race” and renewed the
fight for a more progressive approach, though he couldn’t
budge Congress.  A growing national movement against taxes found its
champion in Reagan. For a time, the idea of a “flat tax” --
eliminating all deductions, exemptions and credits in favor
of one single low rate -- gained currency. Instead, the
 Reagan administration  produced the Economic Recovery Act of
1981, which reduced rates by 25 percent, slashed the top
rate to 50 percent from 70 percent, indexed tax brackets
and accelerated depreciation rates for businesses.  In 1986, Reagan and Congress thrashed out a bill that
cut individual rates across the board; lowered the marginal
rate on the highest incomes to 28 percent from 50 percent;
increased personal exemptions and deductions enough to
remove about 6 million poorer Americans from the tax rolls;
and reduced the top corporate rate to 34 percent from 48
percent.  Subsequent administrations retreated from Reagan’s
bold approach. By 1994, antigovernment sentiment dominated
in Congress, and the fight over taxes became entangled with
the demand to reduce the  deficit  while somehow keeping the
deductions, exemptions and loopholes.  George H.W. Bush 
offered several proposals to cut taxes. There was renewed
talk of abolishing the income tax in favor of a national
 sales tax , but  deficit reduction  remained the primary
target until the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997, which
contained the deepest cuts since 1981.  The act didn’t cost the government much revenue
because it was offset by spending cuts. Strong economic
expansion enabled President  Bill Clinton  in 1998 to present
the first balanced budget in almost three decades.  Enter  George W. Bush . His Economic Growth and Tax
Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 included 10 percent
reductions for the lowest bracket and 35 percent for the
highest one.  Despite widening  deficits  and a costly war, the Jobs
and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003 reduced
the rates on dividends and  capital gains  to 15 percent.  Hardly Damp  How badly did the rich get soaked in all this? The top
marginal rate reached 77 percent in 1918, dropped to 24
percent in 1929, shot up to 63 percent in 1932, and climbed
to 79 percent by the eve of World War II. It soared to 94
percent in 1944 and 1945, and never fell below 91 percent
through 1963. For most of the 1970s, it hovered at 70
percent, then declined to 50 percent for the first half of
the 1980s. In 1987, it reached 38.5 percent, dropped to 28
percent the following year, rose to 31 percent in 1990, and
settled at 39.6 percent in 1993. In 2001, it slipped to
38.6 percent, then fell to 35 percent, where it has
remained ever since.  It seems that the wealthy hardly got damp. From 1979
to 2007, according to the  Congressional Budget Office , the
income of the 60 percent of Americans in the middle of the
income ladder rose 40 percent compared with an average 275
percent increase for the top 1 percent. During that time,
the top 400 incomes increased 392 percent while their
average  tax rate  fell 37 percent. By 2007, the top 1
percent held a larger share of total income than at any
time since 1928, and that gap is growing.  (Maury Klein is a professor of history emeritus at the
