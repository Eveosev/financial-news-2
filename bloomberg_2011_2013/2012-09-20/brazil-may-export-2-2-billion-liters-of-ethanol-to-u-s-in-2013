Brazil  may export about 2.2 billion
liters (581 million gallons) of ethanol to the U.S. next year,
up 30 percent from this year, to meet increasing demand for fuel
made from sugar cane, according to  SCA Trading SA .  The Environmental Protection Agency revises its annual
requirements for biofuel use every November, which will probably
boost the amount Brazil may export to the U.S. next year to
about 2.8 billion liters, Martinho Seiiti Ono, director of the
Sao Paulo-based trading company, said today at a conference.
Brazilian cane mills may be able to meet about 80 percent of
that demand, he said.  U.S. demand for Brazilian ethanol imports may reach 1.9
billion liters this year under the EPAâ€™s  Renewable Fuel Standard 
program, which requires oil companies to blend biofuels into
their fuel products.  To contact the reporters on this story:
