A British inquiry into the death of
former Russian spy  Alexander Litvinenko  will begin in early
2013, more than six years after he died in a  London  hospital
from radiation poisoning.  Judge Robert Owen, who is to lead the investigation,
apologized for the delay at today’s hearing in the U.K. capital.  A critic of the Kremlin who lived in London, Litvinenko,
43, died in November 2006 about three weeks after he was exposed
to radioactive polonium. The isotope was later discovered in at
least 12 London locations by the U.K. Health Protection Agency.  Lawyers for Litvinenko’s widow, Marina, said they believe
the Russian government played a part in his death.  “If that hypothesis were to be evidentially substantiated,
this would be an act of state-sponsored nuclear terrorism on the
streets of London,” Ben Emmerson, Mrs. Litvinenko’s attorney,
said today.  U.K. prosecutors said following a 2007 investigation that
former Russian intelligence officer  Andrei Lugovoi  should be
charged with murder.  Parts of the police report into Litvinenko’s death related
to his alleged ties to British intelligence services will be
kept secret during the inquiry at the U.K. government’s request,
said  Hugh Davies , a lawyer for the inquest.  The next preliminary hearing is scheduled for Nov. 2.  To contact the reporter on this story:
