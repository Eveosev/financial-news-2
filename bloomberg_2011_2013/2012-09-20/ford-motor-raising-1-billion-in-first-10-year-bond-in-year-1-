The finance unit of  Ford Motor Co. (F) ,
the second-largest U.S. automaker, raised $1 billion in its
first sale of benchmark 10-year bonds in more than a year.  The maker of the Mustang and the Expedition sports utility
vehicle sold the 4.25 percent debt to yield 260 basis points
more than similar-maturity Treasuries, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The coupon is the company’s lowest on
record for similar-maturity debt.  In Ford’s last benchmark sale in July, its second since
regaining investment-grade  ratings , the automaker sold $750
million of 3.5-year bonds, Bloomberg data show. Ford issued 10-
year bonds in July 2011, raising $2 billion with 5.875 percent
notes. Benchmark offerings are typically at least $500 million.  The new bonds may be rated Baa3, the lowest level of
investment grade, by Moody’s Investors Service. BNP Paribas SA,
Citigroup Inc., Deutsche Bank AG and Morgan Stanley managed the
sale for the Dearborn, Michigan-based company.  Moody’s increased its grade on Ford in May to Baa3,
following Fitch Ratings’s April upgrade of the company from junk
status, enabling the automaker to regain control of its logo and
other assets pledged as collateral to obtain a $23.4 billion
loan to keep the business going in 2006.  General Motors Co. (GM)  is
the biggest U.S. automaker.  To contact the reporter on this story:
