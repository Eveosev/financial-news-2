Jiangsu Zongyi Co. (600770) , a Chinese maker
of circuits and solar cells, bought and constructed Italy’s
largest roof-mounted solar photovoltaic plant.  The 55 million-euro ($71 million) plant in Marche will
power 4,500 homes, according to a statement from Watson Farley &
Williams LLP, the  law firm  that advised the acquisition,
construction and connection of the 13.5-megawatt project.  The plant covers the roof of industrial buildings at an
unidentified company and will benefit from tariffs incentivizing
solar power. It’s Italy’s largest roof-mounted PV plant,
according to the statement.  Jiangsu Zongyi, based in Tongzhou, has started work on a
further 7 megawatts to expand its projects in Italy to more than
50 megawatts, the law firm said in the statement.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
