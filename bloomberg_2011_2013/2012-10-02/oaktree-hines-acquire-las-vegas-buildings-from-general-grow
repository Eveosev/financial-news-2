Oaktree Capital Group LLC (OAK)  and Hines
bought a 1.1 million-square-foot (102,200-square-meter)
portfolio of Las Vegas buildings from  General Growth Properties
Inc. (GGP)  as the mall owner sells off its office holdings.  The purchase includes 32 office buildings, with two
additional development parcels, located in the Summerlin master-
planned community, Hines and Oaktree said in a statement. It is
the sixth venture between Los Angeles-based Oaktree’s real
estate division and Houston-based Hines in the past two years.  General Growth, the second-largest U.S.  mall  landlord, is
selling its office buildings and strip shopping centers to focus
on its regional mall business. Net operating income from the
Chicago-based company’s office and strip-center properties fell
10 percent to $10 million in the second quarter.  The Las Vegas buildings are in 13 campuses and have tenants
including AT&T Inc., Expedia Inc. and Williams-Sonoma Inc. Hines
assumed property management responsibilities on behalf of the
joint venture.  “The Oaktree/Hines partnership is well-capitalized, and
given the quality of these properties, we believe we can compete
very favorably in the market,” Ambrose Fisher, managing
director in Oaktree’s real estate group, said in the statement.  Oaktree had about $79 billion in assets under management as
of June 30.  A message left for  David Keating , a General Growth
spokesman, wasn’t immediately returned. The company is the
largest U.S. mall owner after  Simon Property Group Inc. (SPG) , based
in Indianapolis.  To contact the reporter on this story:
