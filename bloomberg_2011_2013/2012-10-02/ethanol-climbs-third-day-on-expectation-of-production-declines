Ethanol futures climbed for a third
day in  Chicago  on expectations that unprofitable production
margins will curtail output.  Futures gained a day after  Abengoa SA (ABG) , a Spanish
engineering and renewable energy company, said it will
temporarily idle a Madison,  Illinois , ethanol plant. That
followed  Biofuel Energy Corp.’s (BIOF)  Sept. 24 decision to shut its
115 million-gallon-a-year plant in Fairmont,  Minnesota .  “We saw Abengoa and we saw Biofuel Energy,” said Jerrod
Kitt, an analyst at Linn Group in Chicago. “That’s a lot of it.
We have an Energy Department report out tomorrow and it’s
probably going to show more production declines.”  Denatured ethanol for October delivery advanced 2.7 cents,
or 1.2 percent, to settle at $2.372 a gallon on the Chicago
Board of Trade, the highest price since Sept. 14 and the longest
streak of gains since Aug. 21. The futures have jumped 7.7
percent this year.  The Energy Department is set to release its weekly
petroleum status report tomorrow at 10:30 a.m. in  Washington .  Ethanol  production  in the week ended Sept. 21 fell 3
percent to 809,000 barrels a day, the least since July 27.  In cash market trading, ethanol in the U.S. Gulf sank 5
cents, or 2.1 percent, to $2.37 a gallon and in Chicago the
additive decreased 4.5 cents, or 1.9 percent, to $2.315, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  Ethanol on the West Coast slipped 2 cents, or 0.8 percent,
to $2.465 a gallon and in New York the biofuel declined 1.5
cents, or 0.6 percent, to $2.435.  Corn for December delivery gained 1.5 cents to $7.5825 a
bushel in Chicago. One bushel makes at least 2.75 gallons of
ethanol.  Based on December contracts for ethanol and corn, plants
are losing about 39 cents on each gallon of the biofuel
produced, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That doesn’t
include profit from the sale of dried distillers’ grains, a
byproduct of ethanol production that can be fed to livestock.  Gasoline for November delivery dropped 5.09 cents, or 1.7
percent, to $2.8692 a gallon in New York. The contract covers
reformulated gasoline, which is made to be blended with ethanol
before delivery to filling stations.  The motor fuel narrowed its premium to ethanol to 49.72
cents from 57.51 yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
