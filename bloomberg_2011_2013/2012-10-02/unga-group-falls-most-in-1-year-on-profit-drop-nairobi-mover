Unga Group Ltd. (UNGL) , a Kenyan grain
miller, fell the most in a year after the company unexpectedly
announced a decline in full-year profit.  The stock slumped 9.8 percent to 12 shillings at the close
in Nairobi, the capital, the biggest drop since Sept. 30, 2011.
The stock has slid 21 percent since the company announced last
week that profit for the 12 months through June slipped to 348.2
million shillings ($4.1 million) from 441 million shillings a
year earlier.  “The market was expecting profit after tax would grow by
as much as 10 percent,” Davis Mika, an analyst at Nairobi-based
Contrarian Investing Kenya. Ltd., said by phone today.
“Investors who had taken a position ahead of the announcement
are now pulling out.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
