Qatar Airways  Ltd., the Middle East’s
second largest carrier, “is open to joining any alliance” in
the industry, Chief Executive Officer Akbar Al Baker said.  “Its a two-way street,” Al Baker said today in an
interview in the Qatari capital Doha. “If somebody wants us to
join an alliance because it will impede our growth, we are not
interested.”  Most international airlines belong to one of the three
global marketing alliances -- Oneworld, SkyTeam and Star --
which typically allow them to sell seats on one another’s
flights as their own and to link frequent flier programs. Some
Gulf carriers are now likely to join one of the groupings,
 Willie Walsh , CEO of British Airways’ parent  International
Consolidated Airlines Group SA (IAG) , said in April.  Al Baker  commented after a report in the Financial Times
today that the airline agreed to join the Oneworld alliance,
which includes British Airways and  American Airlines . A press
conference announcing Qatar Airways’ membership would happen on
Oct. 8, the FT said.  “It’s not true,” he said. “It’s all rumors.”  Qatar Airlines is looking at all three of the alliances,
Chief Planning Officer Michael Swiatek said in Istanbul last
month.  The airline, which flies 111 aircraft to 118 destinations,
has orders worth more than $50 billion for 250 aircraft,
including  Boeing Co. (BA)  787s, 777s, Airbus SAS A350s, A380s and
A320s, according to a Sept. 23 statement. The carrier plans to
begin flying to six new destinations over the next six months,
it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
