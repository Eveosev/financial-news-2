Former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker, who advised President  Barack Obama , will give evidence
to a panel of British lawmakers looking into the behavior of
banks.  Volcker will testify on Oct. 17 to the Parliamentary
Commission on Banking Standards, a cross-party panel of 11
members of Parliament that was created in the wake of the Libor-
fixing scandal.  “The U.K. and America are world leaders in financial
services,” Chairman Andrew Tyrie of the ruling Conservative
Party said in an e-mailed statement in London today. “Public
trust in banks plummeted as a result of the banking crisis in
both these countries. Between us, we must lead the way in
restoring that trust.”  Volcker, chairman of the White House’s Economic Recovery
Advisory Board until last year, has advocated tighter rules for
banks’ capital, leverage and liquidity as part of a regulatory
overhaul in response to the financial crisis. He is the
architect of the “Volcker Rule,” which aims to prevent banks
that have federally insured deposits from trading for their own
account.  To contact the reporter on this story:
