Pakistan finished on 149-6 as Nasir
Jamshed top scored with 55 runs, setting Australia a victory
target of 150 in their “super eight” phase match in cricket’s
World Twenty20 competition in  Sri Lanka .  Jamshed combined with  Kamran Akmal  for 79 to help Pakistan
recover from 29-2 in the sixth over. Mitchell Starc was 3-20 to
lead the bowling for Australia, which won the toss and elected
to field in Colombo.  The World Twenty20, generally held every two years, is the
championship of the game’s shortest form. The Super Eight
consists of two groups of four, with the top two teams in each
advancing to the semifinals.  The teams are playing to join host Sri Lanka and West
Indies in the semifinals. India will play South Africa to decide
the final semifinalist from Group 2.  Sri Lanka yesterday beat defending champion England by 19
runs and West Indies defeated New Zealand in a “super over.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
