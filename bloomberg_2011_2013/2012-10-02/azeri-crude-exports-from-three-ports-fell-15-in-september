Azeri crude exports from the
Mediterranean port of Ceyhan and the Black Sea ports of Supsa
and Novorossiysk fell 15 percent to 2.1 million metric tons in
September from a year earlier.  Of the total, 1.65 million tons was shipped through Ceyhan,
according to data published today on the  website  of State Oil
Co. of  Azerbaijan , or Socar. No reason was given for the
decline.  Azerbaijan, the third-largest oil producer in the former
 Soviet Union  after Russia and  Kazakhstan , saw its crude
production slip 7.1 percent in the first half to 22.2 million
tons, the State Statistics Committee said in July.  Exports via the three ports in the first nine months fell
9.8 percent to 19.1 million tons from a year earlier, according
to Socar data. Out of that, 15.5 million tons were delivered
from Ceyhan.  The Caspian Sea nation pumped 45.6 million tons of oil and
25.8 billion cubic meters of gas last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
