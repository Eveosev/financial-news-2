William Demant Holding A/S (WDH)  rose the
most in more than two months in Copenhagen trading after UBS AG
said the Nordic region’s largest maker of hearing aids will
benefit from new product introductions.  William Demant rose as much as 4.1 percent to 538 kroner,
the most since July 19. The stock traded at 537.50 kroner at
10:06 a.m. in the Danish capital, making it today’s  biggest
gainer  in the benchmark Copenhagen 20 Index.  UBS added William Demant today to its list of most
preferred stocks, saying risks are “skewed to the upside” as
the Smoerum, Denmark-based company may introduce new products as
early as this month, the bank said. The majority of new products
in William Demant’s next market push will come later in 2012 or
early 2013, UBS said.  “We believe the company is well-placed to perform well
over the next product cycle,” the bank’s London-based analysts,
including Martin Wales, said in a note.  William Demant said in first-half report published on Aug.
16 that prices in the high-end hearing-aid market were under
pressure because producers are introducing fewer new products.  To contact the reporter on this story:
