Paper exports from  Finland  will fall
as much as 10 percent this year amid mill closures and low
demand in key regions, according to PTT Research Institute.  Paper prices could rise as much as 3 percent this year and
the next, the Helsinki-based research group said today. Pulp
exports are estimated to climb as much as 9 percent, while their
price may fall as much as 10 percent in 2012 and next year, PTT
said in an e-mailed statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
