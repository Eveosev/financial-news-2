Thailand ’s baht touched a two-week
high as a U.S. manufacturing report eased concern global
economic growth is slowing, spurring demand for emerging-market
stocks. Government bonds declined.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index of shares snapped a two-day
loss after the U.S. Institute for Supply Management’s factory
index for September rose to 51.5, more than the median forecast
in a Bloomberg survey of 49.7, and 49.6 in August. The U.S. will
release employment figures this week. Global funds bought $28
million more Thai equities than they sold yesterday and pumped a
net $89 million into sovereign debt, according to stock exchange
and the Thai Bond Market Association data.  “Better-than-expected numbers out of the U.S. improved
risk sentiment today, supporting stocks and emerging-market
currencies,” said  Hideki Hayashi , a researcher at the Japan
Center for Economic Research in  Tokyo . “Investors are waiting
for jobs data from the U.S.”  The baht added 0.1 percent to 30.75 per dollar as of 8:42
a.m. in Bangkok, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
currency touched 30.73 earlier, the strongest level since Sept.
17. One-month implied volatility, a measure of exchange-rate
swings used to price options, was little changed at 4.27 percent.  The U.S. is Thailand’s third-largest export market,
accounting for about 10 percent of the total shipments in the
first seven months of this year, official data show.  The yield on the 3.65 percent bonds due December 2021 rose
one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 3.51 percent,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
