Spanish  registered unemployment  rose
for a second month in September amid a worsening  recession .  The number of people registering for jobless benefits rose
79,645 from August to 4.7 million, according to data released
today by the  Labor Ministry  in  Madrid . That compares with an
increase of 95,817 in the same month last year.  The Bank of Spain said Sept. 26 the euro area’s fourth-
largest economy is still shrinking at a “significant” pace in
the third quarter. Its second recession since 2009 deepened in
the previous three months, pushing the European Union’s highest
 unemployment  rate to 24.6 percent, a record in the country’s 36
years of democratic history.  Economists contradict Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy ’s
forecast that unemployment has peaked at a quarter of the
workforce. The proportion of jobless will rise to 26.3 percent
in 2013, according to the median of six forecasts in a Bloomberg
survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
