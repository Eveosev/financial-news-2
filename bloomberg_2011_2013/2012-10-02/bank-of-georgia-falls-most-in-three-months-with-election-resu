Bank of Georgia Holdings Plc , which
began trading on the London Stock Exchange in February, fell the
most in more than three months as the country’s president
conceded defeat in yesterday’s election.  Bank of Georgia  declined  as much as 95 pence, or 7.4
percent, to 1,183 pence, the most since June 15, and traded at
1,200 pence at 12:10 p.m. in London, valuing the lender at 431
million pounds ($696 million).  Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili said today his
United National Movement Party will go to opposition after exit
polls and partial results showed billionaire Bidzina Ivanishvili’s coalition won the most votes in parliamentary
elections.  “The election will have made people a bit nervous,” said
Vivek Raja, an analyst at Oriel Securities Ltd. in  London . “I’m
not too worried in terms of the outlook for the bank’s
investment case, regardless of who wins this election.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
