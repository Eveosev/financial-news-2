Australia  qualified for the
semifinals of cricket’s World Twenty20 competition in  Sri Lanka 
despite a 32-run loss to Pakistan in Colombo.  Australia was 117-7 at the end of its 20 overs, falling
short of its victory target of 150. Australia just needed 112
runs to qualify for the next stage. Saeed Ajmal was 3-17 and
Raza Hasan was 2-14 to lead Pakistan in the “super eight”
match.  The World Twenty20, generally held every two years, is the
championship of the game’s shortest form. The Super Eight
consists of two groups of four, with the top two teams in each
advancing to the semifinals.  Australia joins host Sri Lanka and West Indies in the
semifinals. India will play  South Africa , which was eliminated
by Pakistan’s win, to decide the final semifinalist from Group
2. Either Pakistan or India can advance, depending on the run
rate.  “It’s disappointing,” Australia captain George Bailey
said. “Pakistan totally outplayed us today. To this point,
we’ve been terribly consistent and the goal is to get back to
that point.”  Pakistan finished on 149-6 as Nasir Jamshed top scored with
55 runs. He combined with  Kamran Akmal  for 79 to help Pakistan
recover from 29-2 in the sixth over. Mitchell Starc was 3-20 to
lead the bowling for Australia, which won the toss and elected
to field.  Sri Lanka yesterday beat defending champion England by 19
runs and West Indies defeated  New Zealand  in a “super over.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
