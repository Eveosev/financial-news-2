German power for 2013 delivery was
unchanged before a national holiday tomorrow as European Union
carbon permits fell.  Baseload next-year electricity, for supplies around the
clock, lost as much as 0.4 percent in earlier trading as carbon
declined as much as 2.4 percent.  Deutsche Bank AG said that lower coal prices and the
growing possibility of government intervention in the wholesale
market through some form of capacity-payment system poses
further downside risk to power prices.  Power for 2013 was unchanged at 47.75 euros ($61.55) a
megawatt-hour at 5:16 p.m. Berlin time, according to broker data
compiled by Bloomberg. Carbon for December delivery slid 5 cents
to 7.90 euros a metric ton on the ICE Futures Europe exchange.  Carbon prices remain dominated by “EU discussions about a
potential tightening of the EU-Emissions Trading Systems cap,”
Mark C. Lewis, an analyst at Deutsche Bank in Paris, said in an
e-mailed report.  The German 2013  clean-dark spread , a calculation of the
profit utilities get from selling electricity for next year
after accounting for the cost of coal and emissions permits,
rose 1.5 percent to 10.32 euros a megawatt-hour at 5:17 p.m.,
data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Power for next month fell 0.7 percent to 49.10 euros and
the day-ahead contract lost 44 percent to 28 euros a megawatt-
hour, broker data show.  Nuclear, Wind  EON AG started two of its nuclear power plants yesterday
after unplanned halts. The 1,410-megawatt Brokdorf unit started
after a turbine fault was fixed and EON’s 1,360-megawatt Grohnde
reactor started after an unplanned halt. Eight of  Germany ’s nine
reactors are generating power as  EnBW Energie Baden-Wuerttemberg
AG (EBK) ’s Neckarwestheim-2 is halted for maintenance.  Wind generation is forecast to increase tomorrow to about
14 gigawatts, Meteologica SA, a Madrid-based weather forecaster
said on its website. That’s above an  average  level of 5.2
gigawatts, according to data from Leipzig-based European Energy
Exchange AG on Bloomberg.  Wind speeds of 22.2 kilometers (14 miles) an hour are
forecast for tomorrow compared with 12.9 kph on Oct. 4,
according to CustomWeather Inc. data on Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
