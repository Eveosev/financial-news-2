Credit Agricole SA (ACA)  sold its biggest
structured note denominated in Japanese yen since at least 1999.  The French bank issued 7.74 billion yen ($99.3 million) of
the securities, its third offering tied to the Japanese currency
this year, on Sept. 27. The three-year notes pay fixed coupons
twice a year of 0.34 percent plus a potential bonus that depends
on the U.S. dollar-yen exchange rate, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. The data exclude securities where the amount of
principal returned can vary and go back to 1999.  Noteholders receive an additional 0.11 percent should the
exchange rate rise above an initial level, indicating a
weakening yen, on twice-yearly observation dates. The initial
rate is the average for the currency on Sept. 27, Sept. 28 and
Oct. 1 minus 5 yen, Bloomberg data show.  Charline Coue, a Paris-based spokeswoman at  France ’s third-
largest bank by market value, declined to comment on the notes.  The yen declined 1.45 percent this year against the dollar,
making it the worst performer among the Group of 10 currencies
tracked by Bloomberg. It advanced 0.05 percent to 78.03 against
the greenback at 08.45 a.m. in  London .  Previously, Credit Agricole’s biggest structured note in
the Japanese currency was 5 billion yen of 30-year securities
sold on May 11, 2006, with a coupon tied to the  Nikkei 225 ,
Bloomberg data show.  Structured notes are securities created by banks, which
package debt with derivatives to offer customized bets to
investors while earning fees and raising money. Derivatives are
contracts whose value is derived from stocks, bonds, currencies
and commodities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
