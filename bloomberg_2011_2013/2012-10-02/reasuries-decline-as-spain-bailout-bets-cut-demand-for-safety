Treasuries rose, pushing yields down
to almost three-week lows, as the Federal Reserve bought $1.9
billion of Treasuries as part of its plan to extend the duration
of is U.S. government debt holdings.  Benchmark  10-year notes  fell earlier with German bunds,
perceived to be among  Europe ’s safest debt securities, as
Spanish Economy Minister Luis de Guindos said yesterday that his
country is analyzing whether to seek a bailout. U.S. bonds were
also supported after former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker said the central bank’s latest mortgage-bond-buying
program isn’t creating inflationary pressure.  “We do have a buyback which is where most of the strength
is coming from,” Thomas di Galoma, a managing director at
Navigate Advisors LLC in  Stamford ,  Connecticut . “Market
participants are using any down-tick in the market to be a
buyer.”  Benchmark 10-year  yields  fell one basis point, or 0.01
percentage point, to 1.62 percent at 11:07 a.m. New York time
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices, after rising to as
high as 1.65 percent.  The Fed bought Treasuries maturing from February 2036 to
August 2042 as part of its program, known as Operation Twist, to
replace $267 billion of short-term debt in its portfolio with
longer-term Treasuries in an effort to reduce borrowing costs
further and counter rising risks of a recession.  To contact the reporters on this story:
