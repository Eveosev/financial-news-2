Commissioner  Joaquin Almunia  said recapitalization of Spanish
banks may be able to move forward in November now that an
independent review has established a 59 billion-euro ($76
billion) capital shortfall.  “I think this has been a very detailed exercise, a
rigorous one with a huge amount of work being done,” Almunia
told reporters today in Nicosia, Cyprus. “I think it is really
transparent and trustful.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
