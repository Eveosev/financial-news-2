Guinness Nigeria Plc (GUINNESS) , the nation’s
second-largest brewer by market value, headed for the highest
close on more than 10 years as investors bought the stock before
a dividend.  The stock gained 1.5 percent to 264 naira by 2:08 p.m. in
Lagos,  Nigeria ’s commercial capital. A close at this price will
be the highest since Jan. 25, 2002, when Bloomberg started
compiling data on the company.  Guinness will pay 8 naira a share or issue one bonus share
for every 33 shares held, Raheem Mohammed, chief operating
officer of Lagos-based Kundila Finance Ltd, said by phone today.
“Investors are taking position on the stock. The qualifying
deadline for the payment is Oct 5.”  Net income for the  Diageo Plc (DGE)  unit declined 18 percent to
14.6 billion naira ($92.6 million) from 17.9 billion naira a
year earlier, as distribution costs rose, the Lagos-based
company said on Sept. 17.  “If Guinness can take care of distribution costs going
forward, investors believe it will do well,” Mohammed said.  Guinness shares have risen 5.6 percent this year, compared
with a 26 percent rise in the Nigerian Stock Exchange All-Share
Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
