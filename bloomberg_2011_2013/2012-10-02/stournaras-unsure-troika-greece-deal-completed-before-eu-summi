Greece ’s Finance Minister Yannis
Stournaras extended the deadline for an agreement with the
country’s creditors in talks to unlock the next tranche of
international aid.  “We’ll see,” Stournaras said after a meeting with Prime
Minister Antonis Samaras in Athens today in response to a
question by reporters over whether Greece will conclude talks in
time for the EU summit on Oct. 18 and Oct. 19. His comments came
in an e-mailed transcript.  The government earlier said talks with the so-called troika
would be ready in time for an Oct. 8 meeting of euro-area
finance ministers in  Luxembourg . The troika is composed of
officials from the European Union, the  European Central Bank  and
 International Monetary Fund , which has pledged 240 billion euros
($310 billion) to Greece.  Greece’s three-party coalition government, formed after
elections in June, forged an in-principle agreement on 13.5
billion euros in pension, wage and benefit cuts last week.
Yesterday, Stournaras said the troika is disputing at least 2
billion euros of the package.  Agreement with the troika on the measures combining an
extra 3 billion euros in revenue with spending cuts amounting to
10.5 billion euros is imperative to allow the release of 31
billion euros under the country’s bailouts. That payment is
designed primarily to recapitalize the nation’s banks in a bid
to boost liquidity in a cash-starved economy.  To contact the reporters on this story:
