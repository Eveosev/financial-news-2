Gold futures fell from a 10-month
high in  New York  on renewed concern that demand in  Asia  will
remain slow. Silver also declined.  Imports of gold by  India , the world’s top buyer, fell 56
percent in the second quarter, according to the World Gold
Council.  Standard Bank  Plc said in a report today that weak
bullion demand has been in place since mid-September and is the
most severe in more than a year. In the three months ended Sept.
30, prices jumped 11 percent, the most since June 2010, as a
third round of monetary stimulus in the U.S. revived demand for
the metal as a hedge against future inflation.  “While the market has been going up on the stimulus fever,
lack of support from physical demand is putting some pressure on
prices,” Marc Ground, a commodity strategist at Standard Bank
in Johannesburg, said in a telephone interview.  Gold futures for December delivery fell 0.4 percent to
settle at $1,775.60 an ounce at 1:35 p.m. on the Comex in New
York, dropping for the second time in three sessions. Yesterday,
prices reached $1,794.40, the highest for a most-active contract
since Nov. 14.  Silver futures for December delivery slid 0.8 percent to
$34.669 an ounce in New York, after reaching $35.445 yesterday,
the highest since March 2.  Holdings in silver-backed exchange-traded funds slid 122.8
metric tons yesterday to 18,503.6 tons, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  Platinum futures for January delivery rose 0.1 percent to
$1,687.20 an ounce on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , the
sixth-straight increase.  Palladium futures for December delivery jumped 1.3 percent
to $654.20 an ounce on the Nymex.  To contact the reporter on this story:
