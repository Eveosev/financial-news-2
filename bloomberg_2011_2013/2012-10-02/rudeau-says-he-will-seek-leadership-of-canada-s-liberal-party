Canadian Liberal lawmaker Justin
Trudeau, the eldest son of former Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau,
will run for the leadership of the party his father led for more
than 16 years.  Trudeau announced his candidacy at an event in the Montreal
electoral district he currently represents.  The Liberal Party finished third in last year’s elections
that gave Conservative Prime Minister  Stephen Harper  a majority
of seats in Canada’s Parliament.  To contact the reporter on this story:
