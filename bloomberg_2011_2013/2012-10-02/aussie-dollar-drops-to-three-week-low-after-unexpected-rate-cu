The Australian dollar slid to a
three-week low against its U.S. counterpart after the  Reserve
Bank  of Australia unexpectedly lowered its benchmark  interest
rate  to the least since 2009.  The Aussie fell versus all of its 16 most-traded peers
after RBA Governor  Glenn Stevens  and his board cut Australia’s
overnight  cash-rate target  by a quarter-percentage point to 3.25
percent. New Zealand’s dollar touched almost a six-month high
versus the greenback after a report showed commodity export
prices advanced last month. It erased gains later.  Australia’s dollar weakened 0.9 percent to $1.0267 and
touched $1.0252, the lowest level since Sept. 6, yesterday in
New York. It depreciated 0.7 percent to 80.24 yen and touched
80.06 yen, also the weakest level since Sept. 6.  The  New Zealand dollar , nicknamed the kiwi, ended the day
little changed at 82.75 U.S. cents after reaching 83.37 cents
earlier. It touched 83.57 cents on Sept. 28, the highest level
since March 2. The currency rose 0.2 percent to 64.68 yen.  The kiwi was buoyed by a gain in ANZ National Bank Ltd.’s
commodity world price index, which advanced 3.5 percent to 263
in September, its highest level since April.  New Zealand ’s dollar has strengthened 4.6 percent this
year, the biggest increase among the 10 developed-nation
currencies monitored by the Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted
Indexes. The Aussie has fallen 1.9 percent, and the greenback is
down 2.5 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
