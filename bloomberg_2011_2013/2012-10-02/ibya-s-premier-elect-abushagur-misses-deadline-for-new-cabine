Libya ’s Prime Minister-elect  Mustafa Abushagur has failed to present his proposed Cabinet, missing a
self-imposed deadline of yesterday, according to the country’s
parliament.  “No new date has been set, but Abushagur must form a
government by Oct. 7 or risk being fired from his post,” said
Mohsen Al Ghariani, spokesman for the National Congress
president, in an interview today.  Abushagur is seeking the support of National Forces
Alliance leader Mahmoud Jibril, leader of the biggest bloc in
the congress.  To contact the reporter on this story:
