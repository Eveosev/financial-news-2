Finland’s economic growth will be
slower than previously forecast as its sales abroad wane and
industrial production declines,  Aktia Oyj (AKTAV)  said.  Gross domestic product will grow 0.2 percent this year,
compared with a 0.3 percent expansion forecast in May, the
Helsinki-based bank said in an e-mailed statement today. Growth
will accelerate to 0.7 percent in 2013, less than the previous
1.5 percent forecast, Aktia said.  “GDP is contracting as exports and industrial output
shrink,” said Timo Tyrvaeinen, chief economist at Aktia.
“There’s no improvement is sight as our competitiveness
continues to weaken.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
