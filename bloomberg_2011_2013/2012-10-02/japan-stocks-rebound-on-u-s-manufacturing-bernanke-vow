     Oct. 2 (Bloomberg) --　Japanese  stocks  fell amid concerns a
global economic slowdown will weigh on earnings. Shares gained
earlier after U.S. manufacturing data beat estimates and Federal
Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  renewed a pledge to sustain
stimulus.  Alps Electric Co. and unit Alpine Electronics Inc. each
plunged more than 12 percent after cutting earnings estimates.
Mobile-carriers NTT DoCoMo Inc. and KDDI Corp. dropped after
rival  Softbank Corp. (9984)  announced plans to buy eAccess Ltd.
Nintendo Co., a maker of gaming consoles that depends on the
Americas for 39 percent of its sales, gained 4.3 percent.  The  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average fell 0.1 percent to 8,786.05
at the 3 p.m. close in Tokyo after rising as much as 0.5 percent.
The broader Topix Index slid 0.2 percent to 731.19, with 21 of
its 33 industry groups dropping. Trading volume on the Nikkei
225 was about 16 percent below the 30-day average as markets in
China and  Hong Kong  were shut for a holiday.  “The  market sentiment  isn’t good or reacting to positives
much,” said Hiroshi Fujimoto, a  fund manager  at Tokyo-based
Shinkin Asset Management Co., which oversees the equivalent of
$6.4 billion. “As the global outlook worsens, investors are
getting cautious about declines in corporate earnings.”  The Topix has risen 0.4 percent this year as a series of
stimulus measures countered a slowdown in the global economy.
Stocks on the measure are valued at 12.7 times estimated
earnings on average, compared with 14 times for the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index and 12 times for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.  BOJ Outlook  The  Bank of Japan  in September unexpectedly boosted its
asset-purchase program by 10 trillion yen to 55 trillion yen.
Pressure is mounting on the central bank, which is meeting this
week, to do more after its Tankan survey yesterday showed
deepening pessimistic among manufacturers. Newly appointed
Economy Minister  Seiji Maehara  pledged a closer watch to make
sure a 1 percent inflation goal is met.  Alps Electric and Alpine Electronics dropped the most on
the Topix after reducing their earnings forecasts yesterday.
Alps needs to show a clear path to higher sales and earnings in
the touch-panel business, according to Credit Suisse Group AG.
Alps plunged 12.4 percent to 352 yen, while Alpine lost 12.2
percent to 621 yen.  Earnings season  in  Japan  starts this month with 139
companies set to report results on Oct. 26, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. A global economic slowdown coupled with a
strong yen are adding pressure to Japanese companies, which are
still recovering from last year’s record earthquake and nuclear
disaster as well as Thailand’s floods.  Bernanke Comments  Futures on the  S&P 500 (SPXL1)  added 0.2 percent today. The gauge
climbed 0.3 percent in New York yesterday as the  Institute for
Supply Management ’s factory index climbed to 51.5 last month
from 49.6 in August. Shares also rose yesterday after Bernanke
defended the Fed’s unprecedented bond buying, saying it will
spur growth, cut unemployment and support the dollar.  “Bernanke is communicating well with the market, and he’s
not going to say anything that may damp expectations for policy
easing,” said Akihiro Tsunoda, a senior investment manager at
Sompo Japan Nipponkoa Asset Management Co., which manages about
5 trillion yen ($64 billion) in assets. “It’s about the time
for Japanese stocks to bottom, but there isn’t enough momentum
to surge more than 1 percent.”  Companies that do business in the U.S. gained. Nintendo
climbed 4.3 percent to 10,450 yen in  Osaka .  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) ,
a carmaker that gets a quarter of its sales in  North America ,
gained 0.2 percent to 2,994 yen in Tokyo.  Softbank, Japan’s third-largest mobile carrier, said it
will buy eAccess for 52,000 yen a share, valuing the telecom at
about 180 billion yen ($2.3 billion). Softbank aims use the
acquisition to boost bandwidth speed and capacity after it began
selling Apple Inc.’s iPhone 5. The deal will help the carrier
compete against bigger rivals NTT DoCoMo Inc. and KDDI Corp.,
Softbank President Masayoshi Son said yesterday.  Softbank advanced 2.9 percent to 3,195 yen. NTT DoCoMo slid
1 percent to 125,400 yen, while KDDI lost 2.3 percent to 5,850
yen.  To contact the reporters on this story:
