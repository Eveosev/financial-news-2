South Korea ’s won weakened from an
11-month high as concerns about a contraction in Chinese
manufacturing outweighed improvement in U.S. factory output.
 Government bonds  declined ahead of the Bank of  Korea ’s minutes.  China ’s production shrank for a second month in September,
while U.S. manufacturing unexpectedly expanded after three
months of declines, figures showed yesterday. South Korean
 exports  fell 1.8 percent in September from a year earlier, a
third monthly drop, a government report showed. The central bank
will release at 4 p.m. local time details of its Sept. 13
meeting, when it unexpectedly held the benchmark  rate . The
nation’s financial markets were shut yesterday and will be
closed tomorrow for another public holiday.  “The won is reacting to mixed reports today after a
holiday, with contraction in China but positive data from the
U.S.,” said Byeon Ji Young, a Seoul-based currency analyst at
Woori Futures Inc. “With another holiday coming up tomorrow,
investors will refrain from placing active bets.”  The won weakened 0.2 percent from Sept. 28 to 1,113.75 per
dollar as of 9:39 a.m. in  Seoul , according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. It touched 1,110.55 on Sept. 28, the strongest level
since Nov. 4. One-month implied volatility, a measure of
exchange-rate swings used to price options, climbed 30 basis
points to 6.33 percent.  South Korea’s consumer  prices  rose 2 percent last month,
after reaching a 12-year low of 1.2 percent in August, official
figures showed today.  The yield on the government’s 3.25 percent bonds due June
2015 climbed one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 2.80
percent, Korea Exchange Inc. prices show. The one-year interest-
rate swap was steady at 2.86 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
