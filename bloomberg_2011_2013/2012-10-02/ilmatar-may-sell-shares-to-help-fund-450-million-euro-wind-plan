Ilmatar Windpower Oyj  may sell new
shares in an initial public offering next month as the Finnish
developer seeks funds for a 450 million-euro ($583 million)
expansion.  The Helsinki-based company may list on the  Nasdaq OMX First
North  exchange as it pursues a plan to build 300 megawatts of
Finnish wind projects by the end of 2015, Chief Executive
Officer Kalle Pykala said today by telephone. Ilmatar would hope
to raise about 10 million euros in a “first phase,” he said.  Finland , which lags behind neighboring  Sweden  and  Norway  in
wind-energy output, is seeking to add turbines by offering
generators a feed-in tariff, or premium rate for the power they
produce. It had 197 megawatts of wind capacity at the end of
2011, compared with almost 3,000 megawatts in Sweden and 520
megawatts in Norway,  European Wind Energy Association  data show.  “Finland is a very, very early-stage wind market, however
what is important is that the feed-in tariff system is very
attractive,” Pykala said. Wind farms get 105 euros a megawatt-
hour until 2015, when the rate drops to 83.50 euros. The system
offers about twice the megawatt-hour rate of Sweden, where a
green-certificate incentive program operates, he said.  Share-sale proceeds would initially help fund a four-
turbine project in Raasepori, according to the CEO. The company
would use debt to finance about 70 percent of its 300-megawatt
plan, he said.  Ilmatar, funded by shareholders and  venture capital  since
it started in 2009, is advised by Pohjola Bank Plc and hasn’t
yet decided on the IPO, Pykala said.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
