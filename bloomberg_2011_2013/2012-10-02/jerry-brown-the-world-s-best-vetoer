Last week, the  Sacramento  Bee  picked up  my not-so-flattering statement about  California 's lawmakers: "When you meet with people in the Legislature in Sacramento, the most striking thing is how stupid everybody is." That's harsh, I realize. But if you read Governor  Jerry Brown 's veto messages, you can readily determine that I'm not alone in my assessment. Brown's vetoes are wonderfully brief and dry, and can generally be read with an implied "you idiots" at the end. Here is what Brown wrote when he  vetoed a bill  about recycling over the weekend: He also  vetoed  a proposal to study California's wildly swinging tax revenues: Even when he's not getting out his veto pen, the governor sometimes takes time out to show his disdain for the legislature, as in this  signing message  from last September: If I had to work with the California legislature every day, I would probably be less reserved. I might break out the obscene acrostics, as  Arnold Schwarzenegger   did once . Brown is to be commended to channeling his disdain for his idiot co-workers into as professional a channel as could reasonably be expected.
