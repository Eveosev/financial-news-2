RAC Ltd. is seeking a 260 million-
pound ($421 million) loan to pay a dividend to its private-
equity owner  Carlyle Group LP (CG) , according to a person with direct
knowledge of the deal.  The U.K. roadside-recovery company is offering to pay an
interest margin of 550 basis points more than the London
interbank offered rate for the seven-year debt, said the person,
who asked not to be identified because the negotiations are
private. The deal will be offered to investors this week.  RAC is also seeking to amend the terms of its existing
senior facility and is offering to boost the interest margin on
a term loan B by 25 basis points to 500 basis points, the person
said. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  About 25 percent of the company’s original 620 million-
pound loan facility has been repaid or canceled since the
Washington-based buyout firm agreed to buy RAC in June last
year, the person said, giving the company a leverage ratio of
about 2.8 times earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and
amortization in September. Ebitda is expected to be about 128
million pounds in 2012 and revenue will increase to more than
460 million pounds, said the person.  BNP Paribas SA, Credit Suisse Group AG, JPMorgan Chase &
Co., Morgan Stanley and UBS AG arranged Carlyle’s buyout loans
last year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The facility
consisted of a 520 million-pound term loan B, a 50 million-pound
revolving credit and a 50 million-pound capital expenditure
portion. Term loan Bs are sold mainly to non-bank investors such
as collateralized loan obligations, bank loan mutual funds and
hedge funds. Under a revolver, money can be borrowed again once
it’s repaid.  Catherine Armstrong, a spokeswoman for Carlyle in  London ,
declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
