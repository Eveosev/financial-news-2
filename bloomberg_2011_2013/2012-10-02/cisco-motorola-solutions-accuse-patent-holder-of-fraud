Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO) ,  Motorola
Solutions Inc. (MSI)  and Netgear Inc., makers of wireless networking
equipment, sued a company they said is improperly using
threatened legal action to obtain patent-licensing fees from
cafes, convenience stores and other commercial establishments.  Innovatio IP Ventures LLC, a business that allegedly
licenses patents obtained from the chip-maker  Broadcom Corp. (BRCM) ,
and its agents, are engaging in racketeering, Cisco and the
other companies alleged in a revised complaint filed today at
the U.S. courthouse in Chicago.  “Defendants are conducting this pattern and scheme
through, among other things, fraud, deceit, misrepresentation,
and other forms of unfair and unlawful conduct,” according to
the 81-page document.  Matthew McAndrews, an attorney for Chicago-based Innovatio,
said he couldn’t immediately comment on the allegations.  The new allegations augment a lawsuit filed by Cisco and
Motorola Solutions against Innovatio last year seeking
preemptive judgments of invalidity and non-infringement of 17
patents.  That case was administratively consolidated with more than
20 others in a multidistrict case assigned to U.S. District
Judge James Holderman in  Chicago .  Innovatio denied many of the Cisco and Motorola allegations
in an answer it filed to their initial complaint in July and
countersued claiming infringement of its patents.  The case is In Re Innovatio IP Ventures LLC Patent
Litigation, 11-cv-9308, U.S. District Court, Northern District
of Illinois (Chicago).  To contact the reporter on this story:
