Taiwan ’s dollar strengthened as a
report that showed U.S. manufacturing expanded more than
economists’ forecast boosted demand for emerging-market assets.
Government bonds gained.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  of shares snapped a two-day
loss after the Institute for Supply Management factory index
rose to 51.5 last month from 49.6 in August, exceeding the most
optimistic estimate in a Bloomberg survey. Global funds bought
$123 million more of the island’s stocks than they sold today,
taking net buying this year to $2.9 billion, exchange data show.  “The U.S. data was a confidence boost for the market
today,” said Tarsicio Tong, a foreign-exchange trader at  Union
Bank of Taiwan (2838)  in Taipei. “But on the local news front there
isn’t much happening.”  The Taiwan dollar strengthened 0.1 percent to NT$29.385
against its U.S. counterpart, according to Taipei Forex Inc. It
reached NT$29.198 on Sept. 17, the strongest level since May 3.
The local dollar should stay between NT$29 and NT$29.50 for the
rest of the year, Tong forecast.  One-month non-deliverable forwards were little changed at
NT$29.295, a 0.3 percent premium to the spot rate, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. One-month implied volatility, a
measure of exchange-rate swings used to price options, was
steady at 3.71 percent.  Government bonds gained the most in more than a week. The
yield on Taiwan’s 1.125 percent bonds due September 2022 dropped
one basis point to 1.157 percent, the biggest decline since
Sept. 20, according to Gretai Securities Market. The  overnight
money-market rate  was steady at 0.389 percent, a weighted
average compiled by the Taiwan Interbank Money Center shows.  -- With assistance from Argin Chang in Taipei. Editors: Andrew Janes, Amit Prakash  To contact the reporter on this story:
