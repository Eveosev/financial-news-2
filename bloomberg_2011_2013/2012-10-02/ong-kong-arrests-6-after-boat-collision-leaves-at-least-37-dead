Hong Kong arrested six people and
started a criminal investigation after at least 37 people were
killed in the city’s worst maritime disaster in four decades.  A boat carrying more than 120 passengers, employees and
family members of  Power Assets Holdings Ltd. (6) ’s Hong Kong
Electric Co., collided with a commuter ferry about about 8:20
p.m. yesterday. The boat was heading from Lamma Island,
southwest of Hong Kong, to Victoria Harbor for a fireworks
display to mark China’s National Day.  More than 350 fire department officers worked through the
night to rescue the injured and recover the dead, Hong Kong
Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying said at a press conference
late today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
