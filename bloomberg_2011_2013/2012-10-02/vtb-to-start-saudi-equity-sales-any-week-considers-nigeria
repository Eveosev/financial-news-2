VTB Capital, the investment-banking
arm of  Russia ’s second-biggest bank, will start equity sales
trading in  Saudi Arabia  “any week,” according to Makram Abboud, chief executive officer for the  Middle East  and Africa.  “We’re almost ready to start trading Saudi, which was the
only remaining market in the Middle East,” Abboud said in an
interview at an investment conference organized by VTB in Moscow
today. “In Africa there aren’t that many developed equity
markets, but we’re looking at Nigeria for equity trading and a
few other markets.”  VTB has  offices  in Angola and Dubai in the United Arab
Emirates, Abboud said.  The bank will limit the size of its equity sales team in
the Middle East until the market recovers and liquidity
increases, Abboud said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
