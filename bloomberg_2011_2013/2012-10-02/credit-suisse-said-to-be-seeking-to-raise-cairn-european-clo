Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN)  is seeking to
raise a 300 million-euro ($388.1 million) collateralized loan
obligation for London-based Cairn Capital Ltd. in Europe,
marking only the third time such a fund has been issued in the
region since 2008.  The bank is in early stages of the transaction, which may
consist entirely of euro-denominated assets, according to a
person with knowledge of the deal, who asked not to be
identified because it hasn’t been announced publicly.  Europe has seen just two CLOs issued in the past four
years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Deutsche Bank AG
arranged one in 2011 for European Capital and  Intermediate
Capital Group Plc (ICP)  issued a fund in 2010. Sales of European CLOs
peaked at 35 billion euros in 2007, Fitch Ratings said. Demand
for the debt froze in 2008 when investors shunned hard-to-value
assets during the worst financial crisis since the 1930s.  “The first and most obvious reason there has not been a
pickup in CLO activity in  Europe  is that the arbitrage economics
for the equity doesn’t work,” Rishad Ahluwalia, head of global
CLO research at JPMorgan Chase & Co. in  London , said in a
telephone interview. “There isn’t enough excess spread to do a
European CLO today. The cost of CLO financing, given where CLO
spreads are, is just too wide to where loans are pricing in
Europe.”  Zoe Watt, a Cairn Capital spokeswoman in London who works
for Holloway & Associates, and Adam Bradbery, a London-based
spokesman for Credit Suisse, declined to comment.  Debt Pool  The spread on euro CLO AAA debt was 190 basis points more
than the euro interbank offered rate, according to JPMorgan
data. The average spread on new-issue euro institutional loans
for the three months ending Sept. 30 was 497.5 basis points more
than Euribor, according to Standard & Poor’s Capital IQ
Leveraged Commentary and Data. A basis point is 0.01 percentage
point.  New-loan issuance in Europe also lags behind the U.S.,
making it difficult to create a diversified pool of debt in
which a European CLO can invest, Ahluwalia said.  Borrowers in Europe raised $77.5 billion of leveraged loans
this year, down 50 percent from the same period in 2011,
Bloomberg data show. In 2007, at the height of the buyout boom,
$339 billion was raised through Oct. 2.  There have been $409.8 billion of leveraged loans arranged
in the U.S. this year, compared with $501 billion in the same
period of 2011 and down from $692.2 billion through Oct. 2 of
2007, the data show.  In the U.S., 71 funds backed by widely syndicated loans for
$30.8 billion have been raised this year, the most since 2007,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg and Morgan Stanley.  CLO Forecast  CLOs are a type of collateralized debt obligation that pool
high-yield, high-risk loans and slice them into securities of
varying risk and return.  JPMorgan said that $35 billion of CLOs may be raised this
year, increasing its forecast from $30 billion. Issuance may
reach $50 billion to $60 billion globally in 2013, the bank said
in a Sept. 7 report.  The price of AAA rated CLO debt in Europe rose to 94 cents
on the euro in August, the highest level since January 2008,
according to Morgan Stanley data. The debt dropped to as low as
69 cents in April 2009.  AAA CLO debt in the U.S. rose to 95.25 cents on the dollar
in August, the highest level since June 2011, according to the
Morgan Stanley data.  To contact the reporters on this story:
