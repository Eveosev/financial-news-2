France ’s market regulator issued
almost 6.2 million euros ($8 million) in fines against six
individuals and an investment firm for trading in shares of
Net2S SA in 2007 based on insider knowledge of an offer by  BT
Group Plc. (BT/A)   The fines ranged from 60,000 euros to 2 million euros, and
included a former BT official, and Intouch Investments, a firm
formed by two former investment bankers in  London  who were also
fined, according to the Autorite des Marches Financiers
 decision .  Two of those fined, a mother and son, will appeal, their
lawyer, Jean-Dominique Lovichi, said. “The fines are very
heavy” given their role, he said, and the AMF’s
investigation had “procedural irregularities.”  Alexis Marraud des Grottes, a lawyer for Intouch and the
two bankers, declined to comment on the decision.  A lawyer for the former BT official didn’t immediately
return calls for comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
