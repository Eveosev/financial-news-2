The pound strengthened against the
dollar, snapping a two-day drop, as a report showed an index of
U.K. construction contracted at a slower pace in September.  Gilts advanced, erasing an earlier decline, after borrowing
costs fell at a sale of 3.5 billion pounds ($5.7 billion) of 10-
year securities. Sterling weakened for a third day versus the
euro after dropping the most in more than two weeks yesterday. A
report tomorrow will show the U.K.  services  industry expanded
for a 21st month in September, according to the median estimate
of 29 economists surveyed by  Bloomberg News .  “We’ve bounced a bit in pound-dollar,” said  Jeremy Stretch , head of foreign-exchange strategy at Canadian Imperial
Bank of Commerce in  London . “Markets will be looking forward to
the services data tomorrow, which is hugely significant for
sterling.”  The pound advanced 0.3 percent to $1.6175 as 4:36 p.m.
London time, after touching $1.6109 yesterday, the lowest since
Sept. 13. Sterling dropped 0.3 percent to 80.11 pence per euro
after touching 80.18 pence, the weakest since Sept. 20.  The pound is more likely to weaken toward $1.60 this week
than rally to $1.62, Stretch said.  Construction Data  A gauge of  construction output , based on a survey by  Markit
Economics  and the  Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply ,
rose to 49.5 in September from 49 a month earlier, according to
a statement on Markit’s website today. The median forecast of 12
economists in a Bloomberg survey was for a reading of 49.9. A
reading below 50 indicates contraction.  A similar index for the services industry will show a
reading of 53, a separate survey showed before the data is
released at 9:30 a.m. in London tomorrow.  Sterling gained against the U.S. currency even as a report
showed U.K.  house prices  dropped in September. The average cost
of a home declined 0.4 percent from August, the  Nationwide
Building Society  said in a report today. From a year earlier,
values fell 1.4 percent to an average 163,964 pounds.  The pound has strengthened 0.2 percent in the past three
months, according to Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes,
which track 10 developed-market currencies. The euro gained 0.1
percent and the dollar weakened 3.2 percent.  The U.K. sold gilts due in September 2022 at an average
yield of 1.764 percent. That compares with a yield of 1.825
percent at a similar sale on Sept. 13, and a  record-low  auction
result of 1.719 percent on July 12.  The yield on 10-year gilts dropped two basis points, or
0.02 percentage point, to 1.72 percent, compared with the six-
month average of 1.75 percent. It earlier rose as much as four
basis points. The 1.75 percent security due in September 2022
rose 0.175, or 1.75 pounds per 1,000-pound face amount, to
100.27. Two-year rates were at 0.20 percent.  Gilts returned 3.2 percent this year through yesterday,
according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. German bonds gained
3.3 percent and U.S. Treasuries rose 2.3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
