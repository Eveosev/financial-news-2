Conergy AG (CGYK) , a German solar-energy
company, and Athens-based  MGD Energy  plan to operate six solar
plants in  Greece  with a total capacity of 3 megawatts, enough to
supply 1,100 households.  The plants will supply as much as 4.3 million kilowatt-
hours of electricity a year, according to a statement posted on
Conergyâ€™s website today.  Solar-power generation in Greece climbed 65 percent to
724.18 watts in the first half of the year, the state-controlled
electricity market operator, known as Lagie, said in July.  Conergy and MDG plan more joint projects in the country,
according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
