Nigeria’s naira retreated against the
dollar after strengthening last week as the central bank didn’t
hold a currency auction because of a public holiday.  The currency of  Africa ’s biggest oil producer slipped as
much as 0.2 percent to 157.55 per dollar and traded at 157.27 as
of 2:13 p.m. in Lagos.  The currency gained 0.3 percent last week as the Central
Bank of Nigeria sold $450 million in its regular Monday and
Wednesday auctions, the largest amount in seven weeks.
Yesterday’s auction wasn’t held as markets were closed to
celebrate Nigeria’s 52nd year of independence. The naira has
added 3.2 percent this year, the best performer in Africa,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The currency’s rally before this week was due to
“sufficient” dollar supply by the central bank, Ecobank
Transnational Inc. analysts, led by Paul-Harry Aithnard in
Paris, wrote in an e-mailed note to clients today. “The naira
outlook remains uncertain” because of strong import demand and
a “structural imbalance between dollar supply and demand.”  The West African nation relies on imports to meet more than
70 percent of domestic fuel needs because of a lack of refining
capacity, according to the Petroleum Ministry.  The yield on Nigeria’s 16.39 percent domestic bonds due
January 2022 increased 11 basis points to 12.82 percent,
according to Sept. 28 data on the Financial Markets Dealers
Association website. Yields on the nation’s $500 million of
Eurobonds due January 2021 were little changed at 4.78 percent
today.  Ghana ’s cedi gained 0.2 percent to 1.893 a dollar in Accra,
the capital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
