Infinis Plc, the renewable-energy
developer owned by  Guy Hands ’s Terra Firma Capital Partners
Ltd., got a 75 million-pound ($121 million) loan from  National
Australia Bank Ltd. (NAB)  for a group of U.K. wind farms.  The loan will finance the construction and operation of
five onshore projects with a combined capacity of 52.5
megawatts, Northampton, England-based Infinis said today in a
statement. It expects the projects to be operating by March.  The U.K., which through its so-called  Renewables Obligation 
program offers premium payments for clean energy, is attracting
investors from overseas. Mainstream Renewable Power Ltd., an
Irish developer, signed a 60 million-euro ($77 million) loan
agreement with Australia’s Macquarie Group Ltd. last month to
help fund its U.K. offshore wind parks.  The Infinis projects, all of which have planning consent,
include two in  Scotland : the 10-megawatt Westfield park in Fife
and the 12.5-megawatt Gordonstown Hill farm in Aberdeenshire.
They also include three in northern  England : the 15-megawatt
Wingates park in Northumberland and the Tedder Hill and
Blackstone Edge sites in Yorkshire, both with 7.5 megawatts.  Once all five plants are generating electricity, the
company will have almost 275 megawatts of operational  wind
energy , according to the statement. Infinis, which produced
about 9 percent of the U.K.’s renewable power in the year to
March, also has hydropower and landfill-gas sites.  Infinis was unable to provide further details on the loan
when contacted today.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
