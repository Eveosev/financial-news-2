Glencore International Plc (GLEN)  sought
European Union approval to buy  Xstrata Plc (XTA)  and create the
world’s fourth-biggest mining company, according to a person
familiar with the situation.  Glencore and Xstrata filed with the European Commission
today, said the person who asked not to be identified because
the approval process isn’t public.  Antoine Colombani, a spokesman for the European Commission,
declined to comment.  Reuters reported the filing earlier today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
