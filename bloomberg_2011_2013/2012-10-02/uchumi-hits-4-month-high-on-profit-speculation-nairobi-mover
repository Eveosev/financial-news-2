Uchumi Supermarkets Ltd., (UCSP)   Kenya ’s
best-performing stock this year, jumped to its highest level in
four months on speculation the company may this month announce
full-year profit increased at least 20 percent.  Shares in Kenya’s only publicly traded retail chain gained
as much as 3.1 percent to 18.50 shillings and were trading 1.4
percent higher at 18.20 shillings by 12:50 p.m. in the capital,
Nairobi. A close at this level will be the highest since May 24.  “Guys are anticipating top-line growth of 30 percent and
profit after tax of at least 20 percent,” Moses Waireri, a
research analyst at Nairobi-based Genghis Capital Ltd., said in
a phone interview.  Pretax profit for the six months through December climbed
26 percent to 204.3 million shillings ($2.40 million) while
sales grew 29 percent to 7.5 billion shillings, Uchumi said in
January. The company is expected to announce earnings for the 12
months through to June toward the end of the month.  Earnings will be boosted by increased consumer spending as
inflation slows, Eric Munywoki, a research analyst at Nairobi-
based Old Mutual Securities Ltd., said.  Kenyan inflation slowed for the 10th consecutive month in
September, with the rate dropping to 5.3 percent from 6.1
percent the previous month. The measure had risen to a high of
19.7 percent in November 2011.  Uchumi’s stock has more than doubled this year, compared
with a 28 percent gain for the  NSE All-Share Index. (NSEASI)   To contact the reporter on this story:
