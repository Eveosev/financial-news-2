India  needs to restrict  South Africa 
to 121 runs or fewer to advance to the semifinals of cricket’s
World Twenty20 competition in  Sri Lanka .  South Africa won the toss and elected to field, limiting
India to 152-6 in its 20 overs in Colombo. Suresh Raina top
scored with 45 runs as Robin Peterson was 2-25 for South Africa,
while Morne Morkel was 2-28.  South Africa was eliminated when Pakistan defeated
Australia by 32 runs in the first Group 2 match of the day.
Australia qualified by surpassing 112 runs, finishing 117-7.  The World Twenty20, generally held every two years, is the
championship of the game’s shortest form. The Super Eight
consists of two groups of four, with the top two teams in each
advancing to the semifinals.  Australia  joins host Sri Lanka and West Indies in the
semifinals. Pakistan would advance if South Africa scores higher
than 121 runs against India because of the teams’ run rates.    Sri Lanka yesterday beat defending champion England by 19
runs and West Indies defeated New Zealand in a “super over.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
