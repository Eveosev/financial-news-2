DaVita Inc. (DVA) , a provider of kidney-
dialysis services, said the U.S. Justice Department ended an
investigation into the company and took no action.  The inquiry, begun by the U.S. attorney in St. Louis in
March 2005, covered topics including financial relationships
with doctors and joint ventures, the Denver-based company said
in a statement today. Prosecutors also looked into the
administration and billing of Epogen, a drug for anemia, DaVita
said.  DaVita cooperated with the investigation, which ended
without the government filing charges, demanding payments or
seeking changes in company policies, according to the statement.  DaVita fell 0.2 percent to close at $103.44 yesterday in
 New York  Stock Exchange trading.  Peter Grauer, the chairman of Bloomberg LP, serves on the
 board  of DaVita.  To contact the reporter on this story:
