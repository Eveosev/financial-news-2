Soybean futures fell to a 11-week low
on speculation that rain will boost yield potential in  South
America , reducing demand for supplies from the U.S., the world’s
biggest exporter. Corn rose.  Rain  this week in southern  Brazil  and most of  Argentina 
will improve soil moisture for planting and early crop
development, Global Weather Monitoring said in a report today.
Soybean production in Brazil may rise 19 percent from a year
earlier to a record 79.1 million metric tons when harvesting
begins in January, the consultant Celeres said yesterday.  “Rain in South America means the crops are off to a good
start, and that increases the odds for a big harvest,” Brian Grete, the senior market analyst for Professional Farmers of
America newsletter in  Cedar Falls ,  Iowa , said in a telephone
interview. “Rising crop potential has reduced speculative
buying.”  Soybean futures for November delivery dropped 1.9 percent
to close at $15.305 a bushel at 2 p.m. on the Chicago Board of
Trade, after touching $15.265, the lowest since July 13.  The oilseed, used to make  animal feed  and vegetable oil,
has tumbled 14 percent since reaching a record $17.89 on Sept. 4
on speculation that August rains boosted U.S. yields. The
government will release its production update on Oct. 11.  Corn futures for December delivery gained 0.2 percent to
$7.5825 a bushel on the CBOT. The grain jumped 19 percent in the
three months ended Sept. 30, the biggest quarterly gain since
the end of 2010, after the worst drought in more than 50 years
reduced damaged crops. The U.S. Department of Agriculture
estimates production will tumble 13 percent this year.  Deutsche Bank AG said today that corn futures may rise 10
percent after the U.S. harvest is completed as demand exceeds
supply. About 54 percent of the corn was  gathered  as of Sept.
30, up from an average of 20 percent for that time of year in
the previous five seasons, the USDA said yesterday in a report.  Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, valued at $76.5 billion in
2011, followed by soybeans at $35.8 billion, government figures
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
