Palm oil  had its biggest daily plunge
since October 2008 and fell to the lowest level in almost three
years on concern slowing demand will cut shipments from the
biggest producers, swelling a glut as output expands.  The December-delivery contract lost 8.5 percent to 2,255
ringgit ($739) a metric ton, the lowest close for the most-
active month on the  Malaysia  Derivatives Exchange since November
2009. Futures have plunged 25 percent in five weeks.  Stockpiles in Malaysia will increase in October, November and
December and may reach a record 3 million tons by January,  Dorab Mistry , director at Godrej International Ltd., said Sept. 23.
Production peaks between July and October. Industry estimates
for the southern region of Peninsular Malaysia showed output
grew more than 26 percent in September, said Paramalingam
Supramaniam, a director at Pelindung Bestari Sdn.  “These figures were widely unpopular and paved the way for
large liquidation at the close,” said Paramalingam.
“Production pressure coupled with soybeans tumbling to the
lowest level since July prompted an outburst of fresh selling by
speculators.”  The southern states of Johor, Negeri Sembilan and Malacca
accounted for about 20 percent of crude palm-oil output in 2011,
according to the Malaysian Palm Oil Board.  The 14-day relative strength index was at 15.9 today and
has stayed below 30 since Sept. 25. A reading below 30 is seen
by some investors and traders as an indicator that the commodity
is oversold and poised to rise.  Prices Tumble  Futures have plunged 38 percent from a 13-month high in
April as a global economic slowdown hurts demand for the oil
used in everything from candy to biofuel. Exports from
 Indonesia , the top producer, declined 6.6 percent in August to
the lowest in two months as sales to  China  and the European
Union fell, said the Indonesian Palm Oil Association. In
Malaysia, the second-largest supplier, shipments fell 0.7
percent to 1.44 million tons in September, Intertek said.  “Slowing demand is probably more worrying and you’ve got
rising stockpiles as well,”  Carey Wong , an analyst at OCBC
Investment Research Pte., said by phone from  Singapore  today.
“Nobody is immune to the economic slowdown.”  Soybean oil  for December delivery dropped 1.5 percent to
50.44 cents a pound on the Chicago Board of Trade. That takes
soybean oil’s  premium  to palm to $373.46 a ton, the biggest
since October 2008. The gap has widened almost sixfold since the
beginning of May. Soybeans for November delivery lost 1.3
percent to $15.4025 a bushel, the lowest level for the most
active contract since July.  To contact the reporter on this story:
