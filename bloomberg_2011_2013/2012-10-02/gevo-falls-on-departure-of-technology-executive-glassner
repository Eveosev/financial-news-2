Gevo Inc. (GEVO) , a U.S. biofuel producer
backed by French oil company  Total SA (FP)  and specialty-chemicals
maker  Lanxess AG (LXS) , fell the most in six days after the company’s
vice president of technology left.  Gevo declined 4.3 percent to $2.01 at the close in New
York, the most since Sept. 26.  David Glassner, executive vice president of technology,
left the company effective Sept. 28, according to a regulatory
filing yesterday. Englewood, Colorado-based Gevo didn’t give a
reason for his departure and Christopher Ryan, president and
chief operating officer, is assuming the additional role of
chief technology officer.  The company has lost 39 percent of its market value since
announcing Sept. 24 that it’s halting isobutanol production at
its Luverne, Minnesota, plant. Gevo is shifting to ethanol at
the facility while it adjusts its manufacturing process for
converting corn into isobutanol, a biofuel that may be blended
with gasoline or refined into jet fuel and specialty chemicals.  Brant DeMuth, a Gevo spokesman, didn’t immediately return a
phone message today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
