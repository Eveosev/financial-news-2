Former Philippine President Joseph
Estrada plans to run for election as mayor of  Manila .  “We will make the city beautiful,” Estrada said today in
a televised briefing after filing a certificate of candidacy.
Estrada was ousted as president in 2001 on allegations that
included receiving illegal gambling payoffs. He was sentenced to
life imprisonment for corruption in September 2007, and was
pardoned by his successor, Gloria Arroyo, a month later.  The  Philippines  will hold elections in May 2013 for half of
the seats in the Senate, all seats in Congress and other local
positions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
