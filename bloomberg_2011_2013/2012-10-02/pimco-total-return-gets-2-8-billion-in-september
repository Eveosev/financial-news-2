Bill Gross ’s  Pimco Total Return Fund (PTTRX) ,
the world’s largest mutual fund, attracted $2.8 billion in
September, its ninth straight month of net deposits after
performance has rebounded this year.  The Pimco flagship fund has gathered $12.1 billion in new
cash for the year through Sept. 30, bringing assets to $278
billion,  Morningstar Inc. (MORN)  said today in an e-mail. September’s
deposits were the highest this year, the Chicago-based research
firm said.  Pacific Investment Management Co.’s Total Return Fund
advanced 9.2 percent in 2012 through yesterday, beating 97
percent of similarly managed funds, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. The fund continued to rebound from what Gross
called “a stinker” of a year in 2011, when it trailed 70
percent of competitors.  Gross reduced his holdings of Treasuries and government
debt to 21 percent in August from 33 percent the prior month,
according to the company’s website, the lowest since last
October.  Pimco, based in  Newport Beach , California, is a unit of
Munich-based insurer Allianz SE. It managed $1.82 trillion of
assets as of June 30.  To contact the reporter on this story:
