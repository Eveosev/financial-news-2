Gulf Coast gasoline strengthened to
the  highest level  in almost a week after Motiva Enterprises LLC
reported a fire at its Convent, Louisiana, refinery and as Citgo
Petroleum Corp. began shutting units at two Texas refineries.  A section of the larger of the Convent refinery’s two crude
units, known as vacuum pipestill No. 2, was shut yesterday after
the fire. Planned maintenance at Citgo’s East and West plants in
Corpus Christi began yesterday. The company declined to identify
the units or length of the outage in an e-mail.  The Motiva and Citgo plants, with a combined capacity of
420,000 barrels per day, account for almost 5 percent of total
Gulf Coast capacity, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The premium for reformulated, 87-octane gasoline on the
Gulf Coast advanced 1 cent to 5.75 cents a gallon versus futures
traded on the  New York  Mercantile Exchange at 2:05 p.m.  Ultra-
low-sulfur diesel  in the region rose by 1.12 cents to 6.25 cents
a gallon.  Western Refining Inc.’s Gallup refinery in New Mexico has a
capacity of 23,000 barrels per day and is also down for
maintenance until later this week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
