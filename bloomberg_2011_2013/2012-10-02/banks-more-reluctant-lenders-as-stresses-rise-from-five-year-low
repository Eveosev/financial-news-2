Banks became more reluctant to lend
to one another, with a gauge of stresses in European money
markets signaling an increase from the lowest level since 2007.  The difference between the euro interbank offered rate and
overnight index swaps, known as the Euribor-OIS spread, was 13.9
basis points, or 0.139 percentage point, at 8:45 a.m. in  London ,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s from 12.8 basis
points yesterday, which was the tightest since Aug. 8, 2007.  Three-month Euribor, the rate banks say they see each other
lending at in euros, rose yesterday for the first time since
June 28. The benchmark, derived from a daily survey of banks for
the European Banking Federation, was set at 0.223 percent, up
from a record-low 0.220 percent the day before.  The cost for European banks to borrow in dollars held near
a three-week high. The three-month cross-currency basis swap was
27 basis points below Euribor, from minus 27.6 basis points
yesterday, which was the most expensive since Sept. 5. The one-
year basis swap was little changed at 27 basis points below
Euribor, Bloomberg data show.  The European Banking Federation’s euro overnight index
average, or Eonia, of unsecured lending deals was set at 0.095
percent yesterday from 0.107 percent on Sept. 28. The Eonia
swap, an estimate of average overnight borrowing costs over the
next three months, was little changed at 8.4 basis points.  Lenders cut  overnight deposits  at the European Central Bank
yesterday, placing 295 billion euros ($380 billion) with the
Frankfurt-based central bank from 316 billion euros the day
before.  To contact the reporter on this story:
