A seven-day blockade of the Danube
river at the northern Serbian city of Novi Sad ended today after
workers protesting over unpaid wages, reached an agreement with
an employer.  The Novi Sad-based Dunav Grupa Agregati AD agreed under
government mediation to pay the six back monthly wages it owed,
Deputy Transportation Minister Pavle Galic said in a phone
interview today in Belgrade. The river traffic returned to
normal this morning, allowing a few hundred barges to pass, he
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
