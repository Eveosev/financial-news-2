European Union antitrust regulators
are analyzing whether a combination between  United Parcel
Service Inc. (UPS)  and  TNT Express NV (TNTE)  would be sufficiently challenged
by express delivery rivals  FedEx Corp. (FDX)  and  Deutsche Post AG (DPW) ’s
DHL Worldwide Express, the bloc’s antitrust chief said.  “An important issue in our analysis is whether the company
that resulted from the merger would be challenged enough by the
other two competitors; DHL and FedEx,” EU Competition
Commissioner  Joaquin Almunia  said in a speech in Nicosia,
Cyprus, today. “It is important that customers continue to have
access to these services at competitive conditions.”  The European Commission is examining whether the deal may
reduce competition for parcel delivery services in Europe. It’s
“possible” that regulators may send a statement of objections
listing their antitrust concerns with the deal, Almunia said
last month.  UPS agreed in March to buy TNT for 5.16 billion euros
($6.66 billion), or 9.5 euros a share, in cash. The transaction
would help it expand in Europe and vault to equal footing there
with Deutsche Post’s DHL, the market-share leader. The tie-up
with money-losing TNT would immediately add to earnings on an
adjusted basis once the deal is done, Atlanta-based UPS said at
the time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
