Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY)  sold
discounted shipping loans to Oaktree Capital Management LP,
according to TradeWinds.  The London-based bank sold $750 million of loans from its
$8 billion shipping portfolio to the Los Angeles-based fund at
50 to 55 cents on the dollar, the industry newspaper said,
citing ship finance professionals it didnâ€™t identify.  Lloyds spokesman Ian Kitts declined to comment by phone
today. So did an official at Oaktree who declined to be
identified.  To contact the reporter on this story:
