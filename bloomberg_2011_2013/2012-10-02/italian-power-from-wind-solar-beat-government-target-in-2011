Renewable power generation in  Italy 
rose by 8 percent to 82,961 gigawatt-hours in 2011 as more solar
and wind projects came online, the government’s renewable energy
regulator said.  Renewables accounted for 23.5 percent of final electricity
demand in Italy as solar photovoltaic power, along with wind and
bioenergy, compensated for a drop in hydropower, the agency
known as Gestore Servizi Energetici said today in an e-mailed
statement. That exceeded the government’s 19.6 percent target,
according to a  report  on the GSE website.  Italy last year had a boom in solar panel sales, becoming
the world’s biggest market with almost 9,300 megawatts of new
installations. Total installed renewable power capacity rose to
41,399 megawatts in 2011 from 30,284 a year earlier, GSE said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
