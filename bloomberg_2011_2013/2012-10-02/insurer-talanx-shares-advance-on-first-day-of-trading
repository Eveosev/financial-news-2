Talanx AG (TLX) ,  Germany ’s third-biggest
insurer, rose 2.2 percent on its first day of trading after an
initial public offering that saw the company narrow the share
price range when investors balked at the initial level.  The shares advanced to 18.70 euros as of 10:43 a.m. in
 Frankfurt  from the initial public offering price of 18.30 euros.
The Bloomberg Europe 500 Insurance Index fell 0.1 percent, while
Germany’s HDAX Index, which measures the total rate of return of
the 110 most highly capitalized stocks on the Frankfurt
exchange, was little changed.  Talanx, which is majority-owned by German mutual insurer
HDI Haftpflichtverband der Deutschen Industrie VaG, said it will
raise at least 467 million euros ($602 million) from the share
sale and will use the proceeds to finance growth and repay
loans. HDI, which is owned by its insurance customers, will keep
a majority stake should Talanx sell stock to the public.  The shares were priced at 18.30 euros apiece, the company
said in a regulatory statement yesterday, compared with the
original range of 17.30 euros to 20.30 euros. Earlier, the range
was adjusted to 17.80 euros to 18.80 euros each, according to a
term sheet obtained by Bloomberg.  Hanover-based Talanx revived the share sale on Sept. 20, a
week after calling it off for the second time in three months as
investors showed little enthusiasm for the price. The day after
Talanx canceled the IPO, the U.S. Federal Reserve announced a
third round of quantitative easing, sending benchmark stock
indexes to the highest levels since 2007.  Talanx, which has been considering the share sale for more
than a decade, owns a 50.2 percent stake in  Hannover Re (HNR1) , the
world’s fourth-biggest reinsurer.  To contact the reporters on this story:
