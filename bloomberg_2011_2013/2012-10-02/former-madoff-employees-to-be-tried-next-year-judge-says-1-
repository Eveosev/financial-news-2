Five longtime employees of  Bernard Madoff ’s investment firm will go to trial Oct. 7, 2013 for their
alleged roles in history’s biggest Ponzi scheme, a judge said.  U.S. District Judge Laura Taylor Swain set the date today
after the former Madoff employees, Daniel Bonventre, Annette Bongiorno, Joann Crupi, Jerome O’Hara and George Perez, pleaded
not guilty to new charges.  Prosecutors in the office of U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara in
Manhattan yesterday filed a new indictment alleging the five
joined a conspiracy to defraud investors that got its start in
the early 1970s. The charges add to the 17 criminal counts filed
against the former employees in November 2010, for a total of 33
counts.  Bonventre, 65, and Bongiorno, 64, worked for Madoff for 40
years, with Bongiorno rising to the level of supervisor and
account manager. Crupi, 51, an employee since 1983, tracked
daily bank account activity, prosecutors said. Perez, 46 and
O’Hara, 49, started at the firm in the early 1990s.  Assistant U.S. Attorney Lisa Baroni told Swain today that
the prosecution case against the five will take about two
months. Swain said she will set aside 3 1/2 months for the
entire trial.  Madoff, 74, pleaded guilty to fraud in 2009 for cheating
investors out of $20 billion in principal. He’s serving a 150-
year term in federal prison in North Carolina.  The case is U.S. v. O’Hara, 10-cr-00228, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York ( Manhattan ).  To contact the reporters on this story:
