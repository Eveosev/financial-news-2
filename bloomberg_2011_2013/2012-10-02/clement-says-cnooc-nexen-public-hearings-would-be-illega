     Oct. 2 (Bloomberg) --The government would be breaking the
law by yielding to pressure from the opposition  New Democratic
Party  to hold public hearings into  Cnooc Ltd. (883) ’s takeover of
 Nexen Inc. (NXY) , Treasury Board President  Tony Clement  said.  The NDP, the biggest opposition party in the country’s
legislature, introduced a motion yesterday calling on the
government to hold public hearings “into the issue of foreign
ownership in the Canadian energy sector with particular
reference to the impact of state-owned enterprises.”  Beijing-based Cnooc has offered to acquire Nexen, a
Calgary-based oil and gas producer, for $15.1 billion. The
government is reviewing the proposal under the country’s
foreign-takeover law, known as the Investment Canada Act.  “Basically they’re calling on the government of Canada to
break the law,” Clement said in an interview today after giving
a speech in Ottawa. “The law is very clear. Under the
Investment Canada Act, there is a legal process that if you
diverge from that process in any way, you are going to be
subject to legal consequences.”  The motion is scheduled to be debated today and voted on
tomorrow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
