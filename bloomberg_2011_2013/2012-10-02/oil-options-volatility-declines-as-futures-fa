Crude oil options volatility fell as
the underlying futures retreated in late trading to close lower
for the first time in four days.  Implied volatility for options expiring in November, a
measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge of
options prices, was 28.58 percent as of 4:50 p.m. in  New York ,
down from 28.68 percent yesterday.  Crude oil for November delivery fell 59 cents to settle at
$91.89 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . Prices

5 cents to 7 cents a barrel at 4:53 p.m. with 1,988 lots
trading. December $115 calls were the second-most active, with
1,725 lots exchanged as they fell 4 cents to 20 cents a barrel.  Calls accounted for 54 percent of the 28,400 contracts in
