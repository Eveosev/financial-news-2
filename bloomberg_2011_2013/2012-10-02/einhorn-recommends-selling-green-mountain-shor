Hedge fund manager  David Einhorn 
recommended short-selling  Green Mountain  Coffee Roasters Inc.,
the maker of Keurig single-serving coffee brewers, saying
competition will increase.  Einhorn, head of Greenlight Capital Inc., also said at the
Value Investing Congress in  New York  today that Green Mountain’s
capital expenditures remain inexplicable.  Einhorn has criticized Green Mountain since at least
October 2011, when he said the company needs to improve its
disclosure and had a “litany of accounting questions.”  Short selling refers to the practice of borrowing stock and
selling it, with the goal of profiting by repurchasing the
shares later at a lower price.  The shares rose 0.5 percent to $23.43 at 11:05 a.m. after
earlier dropping as much as 5.6 percent. The Waterbury, Vermont-
based company had declined 48 percent this year through
yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
