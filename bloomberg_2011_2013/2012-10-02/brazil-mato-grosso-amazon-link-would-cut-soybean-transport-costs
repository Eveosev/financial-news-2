Brazil could save 2 billion reais ($1
billion) a year in grain transport costs by setting up a barge
connection between northern Mato Grosso state and ports on the
 Amazon River , according to Soybean & Corn Advisor Inc.  The government will fund a feasibility study of a route via
the Teles Pires River that starts in Mato Grosso and the Tapajos
River, which joins the Amazon at the city of Santarem, Soybean &
Corn Advisor wrote in an  online report  today.  Two-thirds of Mato Grosso’s grain is transported by truck
to ports in southern Brazil and almost a third is transported by
rail the the port of Santos, with “very little” shipped by
barge, according to the Hinsdale, Illinois-based consulting
company led by Michael Cordonnier.  “The study will look at the engineering needed for locks
to overcome the drop in river level as well as the economics of
the projects and environmental hurdles that must be overcome,”
Soybean & Corn Advisor wrote.  Aprosoja, the Mato Grosso soybean and corn producers
association, estimates the cost of shipping a metric ton of
soybeans from the north of the state to a port would fall to 60
reais from 227 reais now, the consultant wrote.  Transporting part of Mato Grosso’s harvest north instead of
south would also help ease “chronic congestion” at  Brazil ’s
southern ports, Soybean & Corn Adviser wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
