New Zealand  canceled a visa for  Mike Tyson , the former heavyweight boxing champion convicted of rape,
after a charity which was expected to benefit from his visit
withdrew its support, Associate Immigration Minister Kate Wilkinson said.  The government had granted a special direction allowing
Tyson to enter the country for a speech next month that would
benefit the Life Education Trust. The trust has made it clear it
no longer wants to have any involvement with the event,
Wilkinson said in a statement.  The original decision to grant the visa in light of Tyson’s
conviction and prison sentence, had been a “finely balanced
call,” Wilkinson said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
