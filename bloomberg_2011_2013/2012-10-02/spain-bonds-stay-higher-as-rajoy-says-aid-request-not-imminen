Spanish  government bonds  stayed
higher after Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy  said he has no plans
to request a bailout for the nation in the near term.  Spain’s 10-year yields fell 13 basis points, or 0.13
percentage point, to 5.75 percent at 4:46 p.m. London time,
while the country’s two-year note yields declined 14 basis
points to 3.18 percent.  Asked at a press conference in Madrid today if a bailout
request was imminent, Rajoy said, “No.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
