Oilseed production in the European
Union will drop 2 percent from the previous season, as soybean
and sunflower output declines, Copa-Cogeca said.  The total oilseed harvest in the 2012-13 season may be
28.18 million metric tons, down from 28.76 million tons a year
earlier, the Brussels-based farm lobby said today in an e-mailed
report. Production of rapeseed, the 27-country bloc’s biggest
oilseed crop, was estimated at 19.33 million tons, up about 1.9
percent from a year earlier on larger harvests in  France  and
 Germany , the EU’s largest growers, according to the report.  Sunflower production was estimated at 7.77 million tons,
down 7.9 percent from the previous season, as lower planted
acreage in France, the biggest grower, spurred a drop in output,
according to the report. The sunflower harvest in Spain, which
experienced drought this year, was 38 percent smaller than the
previous season. Output also declined in  Italy  and  Hungary .  EU soybean production may be 974,800 tons, down 21 percent
from the previous season, Copa-Cogeca said. Crops in Italy,
France, Austria and Hungary are smaller than the previous
season, according to the report.  On Sept. 28, Copa-Cogeca released its estimate for EU soft
wheat  production  at 126.1 million tons, down 1.8 percent from
the previous season. The bloc’s total grain harvest, including
corn, barley and oats, may be 280.5 million tons, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
