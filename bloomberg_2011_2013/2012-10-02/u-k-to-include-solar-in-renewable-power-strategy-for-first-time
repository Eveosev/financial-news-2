The U.K. will include solar power in
its renewable-energy strategy this year for the first time,
according to a government official.  Solar will appear in the so-called renewables  road map ,
Alasdair Grainger, in charge of feed-in tariffs at the
Department for Energy and  Climate Change , said today in
Birmingham. The government will also unveil a detailed strategy
for photovoltaics in the next few months, he said.  The road map, Britainâ€™s annual policy update for clean
power, has so far only included technologies such as  wind
energy . The document is expected in late October, according to
Ray Noble, a consultant for the Solar Trade Association.  To contact the reporter on this story:
