Spanish Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy 
said he has no plans to request a bailout soon, fending off
mounting speculation that a bid was near.  Asked at a press conference in Madrid today if a bailout
request was imminent, Rajoy said: “No.”  Rajoy is weighing the terms of a Sept. 6 proposal by the
European Central Bank President to buy bonds of cash-strapped
nations including  Spain  if they make for a formal aid request
from the euro region’s government-run rescue funds. Reuters news
agency yesterday reported that Spain is ready to seek a bailout
as soon as this weekend.  Economy Minister Luis de Guindos said yesterday after a
meeting with European Union Economic and Monetary Affairs
Commissioner  Olli Rehn  that the country is still analyzing the
ECB bond-buying proposal. Rehn also met with Rajoy and Bank of
Spain Governor Luis Maria Linde on his visit to Madrid.  As Rajoy faces unrest on the streets of Madrid over budget
cuts and a separatist movement in Catalonia, leaders of the 17-
nation euro area are confronting a tougher approach from the
German-led pro-austerity bloc and talks in  Athens  over keeping
emergency aid on track. The first of three summits in the next
three months is set for Oct. 18-19.  The Spanish premier today called on European leaders to
implement their June agreement to forge a banking union “as
quickly as possible.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
