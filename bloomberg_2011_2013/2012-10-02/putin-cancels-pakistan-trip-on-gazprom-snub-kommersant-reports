Russian President  Vladimir Putin 
skipped a summit with regional counterparts in Pakistan because
of his tight schedule, according to  Yuri Ushakov , his foreign
policy aide.  Putin’s absence wasn’t related to a refusal to grant state-
run OAO Gazprom a contract to help build a  gas pipeline  from
Iran to India through Pakistan, Ushakov said. The Kommersant
newspaper today reported the president canceled the visit
because of the snub to Gazprom, citing unidentified people
familiar with the matter.  Pakistan has struggled to finance the $1.3 billion project,
already delayed by a decade, to fight power blackouts that have
crimped economic growth. The South Asian nation and Russia have
held talks about the link.  Russia is also concerned that it doesn’t damage relations
with India, a strategic partner that is antagonistic toward
Pakistan, the newspaper said.  Foreign Minister  Sergei Lavrov  is traveling to Islamabad to
meet with his counterpart from Pakistan on Oct. 3 and 4, as
relations between the countries develop “actively,” according
to a statement today on the ministry’s website. The two nations
are building both bilateral and multilateral ties through the
Shanghai Cooperation Organization and meetings with Afghanistan
and Tajikistan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
