The U.S. Treasury’s top international
official said Europe has put in place the “tools” to help
Spain borrow at affordable interest rates.  “They’ve made a series of very important commitments,”
 Lael Brainard , the Treasury’s undersecretary for international
affairs, said today in an interview with CNBC. “They have a set
of tools that can help governments like Spain continue to access
the markets at affordable rates while they continue making these
very challenging reforms.” She said Spain’s leaders have shown
“political will.”  Brainard also said the U.S. has “seen results” from its
relationship with China, including strengthening of the Chinese
currency. President  Barack Obama ’s “strategy of engagement”
has helped boost U.S. exports to China, she told CNBC.  To contact the reporter on this story:
