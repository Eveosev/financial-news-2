Wall Street dealers saw demand to
finance purchases of residential mortgage-backed securities
increase in the three months through August, according to the
 Federal Reserve .  About a quarter of dealers reported increased demand for
funding of mortgage securities backed by government-supported
finance companies, or agency bonds, the central bank said today
in its quarterly survey of senior credit officers. About two-
fifths reported an increase for non-agency debt.  No other major changes in market behavior were reported by
the 22 banks interviewed, the Fed said in a summary of the
report.  “Responses to the September survey pointed to no
significant changes in the credit terms applicable to important
classes of counterparties over the past three months,” the
central bank said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
