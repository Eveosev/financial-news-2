Bolivia had its credit rating raised
by  Fitch Ratings , which said the country’s rising foreign
reserves and falling debt levels improve its flexibility to deal
with economic “shocks.”  Fitch raised Bolivia’s long-term foreign currency rating by
one level to BB-, or three steps below an investment grade, and
said its outlook is stable. The upgrade put Fitch’s rating on
the country at the same level with  Standard & Poor’s  and Moody’s
Corp.  “Bolivia’s upgrade reflects the country’s strengthened
external buffers, improved sovereign debt profile and greater
diversification of financing sources,” Fitch analysts including
Cesar Arias wrote in a statement. “Increasing public investment
levels could support growth momentum.”  The South American economy’s government debt may fall below
30 percent of its gross domestic product by 2014 from 32 percent
last year, according to Fitch. Foreign reserves, which amount to
$13.4 billion, are equivalent to half the size of its GDP,
enough to cover 14 months of foreign debt payment, Fitch said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
