Heineken NV (HEIA) , the world’s third-
biggest beer-maker, sold $3.25 billion of debt denominated in
U.S. dollars to fund the acquisition of Asia Pacific Breweries
Ltd.  The sale included $500 million of 0.8 percent, three-year
notes to yield 55 basis points more than Treasuries with similar
maturities, $1.25 billion of 1.4 percent, five-year securities
at a spread of 85 basis points, $1 billion of 2.75 percent,
10.5-year bonds at 115 and $500 million of 4 percent, 30-year
debt at 130, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Heineken got approval to take control of Asia Pacific
Breweries on Sept. 28 in a buyout of joint-venture partner
Fraser & Neave Ltd. for S$5.6 billion ($4.6 billion).  The brewer last sold dollar-denominated debt in March,
issuing $750 million of 3.4 percent notes due in April 2022.
Those securities were quoted at 104.1 cents on the dollar to
yield 2.9 percent yesterday, according to prices compiled by
Bloomberg.  The new bonds may be rated Baa1 by Moody’s Investors
Service, the third-lowest level of investment grade, Bloomberg
data show. Barclays Plc, Citigroup Inc., Credit Suisse Group AG,
and JPMorgan Chase & Co. managed the sale.  To contact the reporter on this story:
