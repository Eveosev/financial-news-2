The  New York  Stock Exchange and
Nasdaq Stock Market should make companies that have multiple
classes of stock with unequal voting rights ineligible for
listing, the Council of Institutional Investors said.  Companies with two or more kinds of common stock often
concentrate voting power for founders, families or executives,
the Washington-based nonprofit group said in a statement. That
can “foster less accountability” from boards and executives
and increases the risks for investors, Anne Sheehan, director of
corporate governance for the California State Teachers’
Retirement System, said in the release.  Twenty of 170 initial public offerings between January 2010
and March 2012 were by companies with a multi-class, unequal
voting stock structure, said CII, which represents pension
funds, endowments and foundations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
