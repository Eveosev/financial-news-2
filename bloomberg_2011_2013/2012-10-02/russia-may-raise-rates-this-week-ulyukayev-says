Russia ’s central bank doesn’t rule
out raising interest rates or keeping them unchanged at its Oct.
5 meeting as inflation risks intensify, First Deputy Chairman
 Alexei Ulyukayev  said.  “We think that inflation risks are higher” than the
threat of an economic slowdown, Ulyukayev told reporters in
Moscow today. The ruble will probably remain at about 35 against
the central bank’s target basket of dollars and and euros in the
near future, Ulyukayev said.  Russia is splitting from policy makers in other major
economies focused on bolstering economic growth, with President
Vladimir Putin pledging to remain on a “steady and consistent
path aimed at subduing inflation.” Bank Rossii unexpectedly
raised all policy rates by a quarter-point last month after
price growth exceeded the upper limit of its target.  “We do not expect the Russian central bank to immediately
react to inflation challenges,”  Julia Tsepliaeva , head of
research at BNP Paribas in Moscow, said by e-mail. Tsepliaeva
predicts the regulator will keep borrowing costs unchanged this
month before raising them a quarter-point in November.  The ruble slid from the highest level in almost a week
against the dollar, dropping 0.3 percent to 31.13 per dollar as
of 11:59 a.m. in Moscow. The Russian currency lost 0.3 percent
against the euro to 40.1504 and was down 0.3 percent versus the
central bank’s euro-dollar basket.  To contact the reporter on this story:
