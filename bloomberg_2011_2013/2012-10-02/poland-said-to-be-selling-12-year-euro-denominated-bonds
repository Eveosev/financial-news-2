Poland sold 1.75 billion euros ($2.26
billion) of 12-year bonds today to complete its financing of the
2012 deficit and start meeting next year’s needs while yields
are at record lows.  The benchmark notes maturing in July 2024 were priced to
yield 3.385 percent, or 143 basis points above the benchmark
mid-swap rate and down from an initial guidance of 150, said a
person familiar with the offering, who asked not to be
identified because they weren’t authorized to speak about the
transaction.  Poland decided to sell the bonds to “take advantage” of
record low borrowing costs,  Piotr Marczak , the head of  Finance
Ministry ’s public debt department, wrote in an e-mailed response
to questions today. The country needs more than 4 billion euros
in foreign currencies for debt servicing in the first two months
of 2013, he said last week.  “ Interest rates  are relatively low at the moment,” Bart van der Made, who helps manage the equivalent of $14 billion of
assets at ING Investment Management, said by phone from the
Hague. “They might as well grab the moment when it’s there.”  The sale comes a day after the  Czech Republic  sold 750
million euros of notes due in 2022 that were priced at 116 basis
points above mid-swaps, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
 Poland  is rated A2 at Moody’s Investors Service, one grade below
the Czech Republic.  The yield on Poland’s existing 2023 euro bond increased two
basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 3.07 percent at 4:32
p.m. in Warsaw. The government sold the euro notes in June at
195 basis points above the mid-swaps.  The country’s decision to speed up borrowing for next year
is “insurance” in case the euro region’s debt crisis flares
up, Wojciech Kowalczyk, a deputy Finance Minister, told
reporters in Warsaw on Sept. 18.  Commerzbank AG, HSBC Holdings Plc, ING Groep NV and Societe
Generale AG managed the sale, the ministry said on its  website .  To contact the reporters on this story:
