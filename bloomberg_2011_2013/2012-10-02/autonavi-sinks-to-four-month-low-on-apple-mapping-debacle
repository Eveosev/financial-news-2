AutoNavi Holdings Ltd. (AMAP)  sank to a
four-month low amid speculation investors are selling shares of
the Chinese electronic navigation tool manufacturer because of
its link with  Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s flawed mapping application.  American depositary receipts of AutoNavi fell 1.3 percent
to $10.76 at the close of trading in  New York , the lowest since
June 4. The shares have declined every day since Sept. 24, when
 Consumer Reports  said Apple’s new mapping software for mobile
devices is “short on options.”  Apple, which apologized on Sept. 28 for shortcomings in the
app including misrouted directions and inaccurately located
landmarks, selected Beijing-based AutoNavi to offer map services
for users of the iOS 6 operating system in China, two people
with knowledge of the matter said in July. Initial problems with
Chinese maps on iOS 6 weren’t caused by AutoNavi, Yongqi Yang,
an executive vice president at the company, said last week,
according to a  report  by  Tencent Holdings Ltd. (700) ’s news service.  “The issue with Apple’s mapping app is probably hurting
AutoNavi’s brand a little,” Andy Yeung, a New York-based
analyst at Oppenheimer & Co., who rates the stock the equivalent
of buy, said in a phone interview. “AutoNavi has had similar
glitches in China with the latest Apple map application.”  AutoNavi’s Yang said his company’s partnership with Apple
started as early as February 2010, according to the Tencent
report.  Apple spokeswoman  Trudy Muller  declined to comment. A phone
message and e-mail sent to Jessica Barist Cohen of Ogilvy
Financial in New York, which represents AutoNavi, weren’t
immediately returned. Serena Shi, a communications manager at
AutoNavi, couldn’t be reached by phone after normal business
hours in Beijing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
