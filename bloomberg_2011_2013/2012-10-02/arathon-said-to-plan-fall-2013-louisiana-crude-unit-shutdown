Marathon Petroleum Corp. (MPC)  plans to
shut a crude unit at its Garyville  refinery  in Louisiana in the
fall of 2013, according to a person with direct knowledge of the
situation.  A platformer will also be shut during the work, said the
person, who asked not to be identified because the information
isnâ€™t public.  Shane Pochard, a Findlay, Ohio-based spokesman, declined to
comment in an e-mail.  The refinery has a capacity of 460,000 barrels a day,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
