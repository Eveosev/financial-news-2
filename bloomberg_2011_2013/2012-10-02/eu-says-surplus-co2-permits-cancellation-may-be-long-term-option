A permanent cancellation of surplus
carbon permits in the European Union’s emissions market may be a
long-term option for to improve the program, said  Jos Delbeke ,
director general for climate at the European Commission.  The commission, the EU regulatory arm, will discuss this
issue and other potential “structural” options to strengthen
the bloc’s emissions trading system in a report to be published
“in the coming weeks,” Delbeke said during the General
Assembly of the Zero Emissions Platform in Brussels today.  The commission’s proposal in July to delay sales of some
carbon permits as of 2013 is an “exceptional short-term measure
that goes hand-in-hand with the debate about structural
measures,” Delbeke said. A deeper overhaul of the system would
need more time because such decisions involve national
governments and the European Parliament, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
