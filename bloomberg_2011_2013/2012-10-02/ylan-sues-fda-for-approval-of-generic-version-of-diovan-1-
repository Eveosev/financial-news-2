Mylan Inc. sued the U.S. Food and
Drug Administration for approval to sell a generic version of
 Novartis AG (NOVN) ’s heart pill Diovan after a competitor failed to get
the drug on the market in time.  Mylan, in a lawsuit filed today in federal court in
Washington, said  Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd. (RBXY)  forfeited its right
to six-month exclusivity to sell the generic drug by not winning
FDA approval. Mylan argues the FDA’s refusal to approve its sale
of the drug is arbitrary and capricious and an abuse of
discretion.  “Ranbaxy failed to receive tentative approval prior to the
statutory 30-month forfeiture deadline, and no statutory
exception to forfeiture applies,” Mylan said in its complaint.  On Sept. 21, Mylan, based in Canonsburg, Pennsylvania,
announced a copy of Diovan HCT, a combination of the Novartis
drug and hydrochlorothiazide, a diuretic, while Novartis’ own
generics unit started marketing a branded version of the same
drug.  Sandy Walsh , an FDA spokeswoman, said the agency doesn’t
comment on pending litigation.  Diovan generated $5.7 billion in revenue around the world
last year, according to Basel, Switzerland-based Novartis’
annual report.  The case is Mylan Laboratories v. U.S. Food and Drug
Administration, 12-cv-01637, U.S. District Court,  District of
Columbia  (Washington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
