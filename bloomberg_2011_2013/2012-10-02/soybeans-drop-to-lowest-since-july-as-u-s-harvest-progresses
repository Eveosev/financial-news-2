Soybeans fell in  Chicago  to the
lowest price since July and corn slipped as harvesting in the
U.S. advanced at the fastest pace in at least three decades,
helped by warm, dry weather.  About 41 percent of the soybean crop in the U.S., last
year’s largest grower, was  harvested  as of Sept. 30, compared
with 15 percent a year earlier, the Department of Agriculture
said yesterday. Fifty-four percent of corn was  collected , up
from 18 percent. The harvest is progressing at the fastest rate
since the USDA began collecting data in 1981.  “It’s more the pace of harvesting that’s pushing prices
lower, as it eases supply concerns,” Chung Yang Ker, an analyst
at Phillip Futures Pte, said from  Singapore . “There’s also the
anticipation for larger-than-expected yields.”  Soybeans for November delivery fell 1.4 percent to $15.38 a
bushel by 7:05 a.m. on the Chicago Board of Trade. The oilseed
earlier touched $15.355, the lowest for a most-active contract
since July 13. Corn for December delivery dropped 0.7 percent to
$7.5175 a bushel.  Crops remain in the worst condition since at least 1988,
with 33 percent of  soybeans  and 50 percent of corn rated poor or
very poor as of Sept. 30 after drought this year hurt yields,
USDA data show. Farmers may collect 10.727 billion bushels of
corn, a six-year low, while the soybean harvest at 2.634 billion
bushels may be the smallest since 2003, the USDA said Sept. 12.
The agency is slated to update crop forecasts Oct. 11.  “As harvest results come in, the market appears to be more
comfortable with availability,” Deutsche Bank AG analysts
including Christina McGlone-Hahn said in an e-mailed report
today. “While sentiment has turned more negative as the quarter
comes to a close, we go back to fundamentals. Supply and demand
balances are tight, particularly in the soybean complex.”  Wheat for December delivery slid 1.4 percent to $8.72 a
bushel, extending yesterday’s 2 percent slump. In Paris,
November-delivery milling wheat fell 0.6 percent to 261 euros
($338) a metric ton on NYSE Liffe.  To contact the reporters on this story:
