Brazilian electric regulator plans to
sue Companhia Hidro Eletrica do Sao Francisco and ask for a 300
million reais ($148.1 million) compensation for not building
transmission lines, the general director of the so-called Aneel
said today.  Chesf, a subsidiary of  Centrais Eletricas Brasileiras SA (ELET6) ,
failed to build lines to connect wind farms in the Northeastern
states of Bahia and Rio Grande do Norte to the integrated
electric system, Nelson Hubner told reporters in Brasilia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
