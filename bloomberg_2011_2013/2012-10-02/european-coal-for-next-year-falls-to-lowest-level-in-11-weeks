European coal for delivery next year
decreased to the lowest level in more than 11 weeks.  Thermal coal for delivery next year to Amsterdam, Rotterdam
or Antwerp fell as much as 0.3 percent to $96 a metric ton, the
lowest level since July 16, according to broker data compiled by
Bloomberg. The contract traded 0.2 percent lower at $96.15 a ton
as of 2:08 p.m. in  London .  Deutsche Bank AG cut its European coal-price forecasts by
an average of $10 to $90 a metric ton in 2013 and $95 in 2014 to
reflect lower European import prices, driven in part by reduced
U.S. coal use in power generation, the bank said today in a
research report.  Bloomberg tracks information supplied by ICAP Plc, GFI
