Serb lawmakers backed five nominees
for the central bank’s Governor’s Council a month after four
members stepped down to protest a new central bank law.  Parliament’s Finance Committee backed Nebojsa Savic, co-
founder of the Belgrade-based FEFA Faculty of Economy and
Finance as the chairman of the council, whose members include
macroeconomists of the Belgrade-based Economics Institute Stojan Stamenkovic and Ivan Nikolic, as well as Miladin Kovacevic, the
deputy head of the Serbian Statistics Office. The fifth member
is Nikola Martinovic.  The nominations were approved a week after parliament
appointed three central bank vice governors.  Serbia  restored parliamentary control of the Narodna Banka
Srbije for the first time since the ouster of Slobodan Milosevic
in 2000, a move criticized by the International Monetary Fund,
the World Bank and the European Union, Serbia’s three biggest
lenders and investors.  Parliament appointed Jorgovanka Tabakovic, vice president
of the ruling Progressive Party, as governor on Aug. 6. The law,
adopted on Aug. 4, gave a 90-day deadline for all appointments,
including members of the Governor’s Council.  To contact the reporter on this story:
