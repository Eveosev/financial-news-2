Spain ’s  10-year bonds  advanced for a
fourth day, the longest streak of gains in three weeks, amid
speculation the nation is preparing to seek a sovereign bailout
that will trigger European Central Bank purchases of its debt.  Two-year Spanish yields slid to the lowest level in a week
after Economy Minister Luis de Guindos said Spain is studying
the ECB’s bond-buying proposal, having met with  European
Economic  and Monetary Affairs Commissioner  Olli Rehn  yesterday.
German 10-year bunds pared losses after Prime Minister  Mariano
Rajoy  said a request for aid was not imminent. Austrian bonds
rose after the nation sold 1.32 billion euros ($1.7 billion) of
securities maturing in 2019 and 2044.  “The market thinks that Spain asking for aid is just a
matter of time,” said Anders Moeller Lumholtz, an analyst at
 Danske Bank A/S (DANSKE)  in Copenhagen. “This would be positive for the
bonds and we see it happening within the next couple of weeks.”  Spain’s 10-year bond yields declined 13 basis points, or
0.13 percentage point, to 5.75 percent at 4:43 p.m. London time,
after reaching 5.72 percent, the lowest since Sept. 25. The 5.85
percent security maturing in January 2022 rose 0.93 or 9.30
euros per 1,000-euro face amount, to 100.685. Two-year note
yields fell 14 basis points to 3.17 percent, after dropping to
3.15 percent, also the lowest since Sept. 25.  Rajoy, who spent six months campaigning for ECB President
 Mario Draghi  to buy bonds, has been weighing the benefits of
seeking aid since Aug. 2.  ‘Let’s Do it’  Spain should seek a bailout as soon as possible,  Bankinter
SA (BKT)  Chief Executive Office Maria Dolores Dancausa told
broadcaster Antena 3 in an interview today.  “If we have to ask for external financing, let’s do it and
let’s do it as soon as possible,” Dancausa said in a recording
of the interview.  Spanish bonds stayed higher even after a report showed the
country’s  registered unemployment  rose for a second month in
September. The number of people claiming jobless benefits rose
by 79,645 from August to 4.7 million, according to data today
from the Labor Ministry.  The ECB will meet in Ljubljana, Slovenia, to review
monetary policy on Oct. 4. Forty-nine of 52 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg predict the central bank will keep its benchmark
 interest rate  at a record-low 0.75 percent. Three analysts said
the ECB will cut the rate by 25 basis points to 0.5 percent.  German Yields  Germany ’s  10-year yield  was little changed at 1.46 percent
after rising to 1.49 percent. The two-year note yield was little
changed at 0.04 percent.  Factory-gate prices in the 17-nation euro region rose 2.7
percent from a year earlier, after increasing a revised 1.6
percent in July, the European Union’s statistics office in
Luxembourg said today. Economists had forecast an increase of
2.6 percent, the median of 13 estimates in a Bloomberg News
survey showed.  Austria sold 550 million euros of notes maturing in 2019 at
an average yield of 1.326 percent in an auction today, down from
1.344 percent at a sale of the securities last month, the
Austrian Federal Financing Agency said on its website. The
nation also sold 770 million euros of 2044 bonds at an average
yield of 2.88 percent.  Austria’s seven-year note yields were little changed at
1.36 percent after falling to 1.35 percent. The 30-year bond
yield dropped two basis points to 2.90 percent.  Portuguese 10-year bond yields dropped one basis point to
8.92 percent. The country’s debt agency IGCP said today it plans
to carry out an offer to exchange bonds tomorrow as it seeks to
regain access to the markets.  The agency will offer to buy securities maturing in
September 2013 and will sell bonds maturing in October 2015, the
Lisbon-based IGCP said today in a statement on its website. The
IGCP plans to carry out the offer at 10:30 a.m.  Volatility on Irish bonds was the highest in euro-region
markets today, followed by Dutch and Italian securities,
according to measures of 10-year bonds, the spread between two-
and 10-year securities, and credit default swaps.  To contact the reporters on this story:
