TMM Real Estate Development Plc (TR61) ,
Ukraine’s biggest property developer, said first-half sales fell
37 percent as the construction industry contracted.  Revenue at TMM Real Estate declined to $14.3 million in the
six months ended June 30, 2012 from $22.8 million in the same
period a year earlier, the company said in an e-mailed statement
today. The lack of new projects caused more than a three-fold
decline in sales of completed property in the period to $5.5
million from $17.4 million a year earlier, TMM said.  Ukraine’s construction industry declined by 8 percent in
the first eight months of the year, Prime Minister Mykola Azarov
said on Sept. 19. This caused economic growth to slow to 1.5
percent in the period compared with 2.5 percent in the first
half of the year, said Azarov.  To contact the reporter on this story:
