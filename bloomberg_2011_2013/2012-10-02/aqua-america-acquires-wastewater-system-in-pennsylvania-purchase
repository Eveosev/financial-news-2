Aqua America Inc. (WTR) , a water utility
that operates in 10 U.S. states, acquired the wastewater system
assets of Kidder Township though its Pennysylvania subsidiary
for $11.3 million.  The  Bryn Mawr , Pennsylvania-based company said the deal,
part of a “growth-through-acquisition strategy,” demonstrates
that “with 80 percent of the water and wastewater systems still
in government control, the purchase of municipally owned systems
such as Kidder Township is an area of great growth potential.”  Aqua America serves almost 3 million customers from  Texas 
to New Yersey. The utility in July reported record earnings for
the second quarter on an 11 percent rise in revenue. The shares
have advanced 11 percent this year compared with a 14 percent
gain in the 18-member Bloomberg World Water Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
