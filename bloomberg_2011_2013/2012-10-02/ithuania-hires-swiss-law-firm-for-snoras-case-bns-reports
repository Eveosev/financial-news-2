The Lithuanian Finance Ministry hired
Swiss law firm Lalive and the Baltic law firm Sorainen Partners
to defend the country against claims arising from the takeover
of Bankas Snoras AB, the  Baltic News Service  reported.  The ministry and the law firms signed a three-year contract
worth 10 million litai ($3.7 million) on Sept. 24, the newswire
said.  Vladimir Antonov , the former majority owner of Snoras who
is fighting extradition from London and civil charges over the
lenderâ€™s bankruptcy, filed a suit against  Lithuania  over the
takeover on May 7, BNS reported.  Antonov says the charges against him are politically
motivated and discriminatory, according to BNS.  To contact the reporter on this story:
