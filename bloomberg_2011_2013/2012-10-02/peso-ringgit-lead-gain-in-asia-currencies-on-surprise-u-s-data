Asian currencies strengthened, led by
the Philippine peso and  Malaysia ’s ringgit, as a surprise
rebound in U.S. manufacturing improved the export outlook and
buoyed demand for emerging-market assets.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index of stocks snapped a two-day
loss after data showed yesterday that the U.S. Institute for
Supply Management’s factory index climbed to 51.5 last month
from 49.6 in August. That breached the 50 level, signaling
expansion, and beat the median estimate of 49.7 in a Bloomberg
survey.  “The ISM came out better than expected, so that provided
some support for risk sentiment,” said Sim Moh Siong, a
currency strategist at Bank of Singapore Ltd. “Investors are
diversifying away from the  U.S. dollar  and European debt.”  The peso climbed 0.4 percent to close at 41.605 per dollar,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The ringgit gained 0.4
percent to 3.0519 and Thailand’s baht advanced 0.2 percent to
30.73. The Bloomberg-JPMorgan Asia  Dollar Index  touched 117.37,
just shy of yesterday’s 117.40 that was the highest since March
12. The gauge later fell 0.2 percent.  Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said yesterday he
will sustain record stimulus that boosts the supply of dollars.
The Fed announced Sept. 13 it would buy $40 billion of mortgage-
backed debt a month until the economic recovery is well-
established.  The U.S. Labor Department is due to issue jobs data Oct. 5.
The  unemployment rate  may have climbed to 8.2 percent in
September, from 8.1 percent a month earlier, according to the
median estimate of  economists  in a Bloomberg News survey. It has
been more than 8 percent since January 2009.  Won Weakens  The baht touched a two-week high after global funds bought
$28 million more equities than they sold yesterday and pumped a
net $89 million into sovereign debt, according to data from the
stock exchange and Thai Bond Market Association. The U.S. is
Thailand’s third-largest export market, taking about 10 percent
of shipments in the first seven months of this year.  “Better-than-expected data out of the U.S. improved risk
sentiment,” said  Hideki Hayashi , a researcher at the Japan
Center for  Economic Research  in  Tokyo . “Now investors are
waiting for jobs data from the U.S.”  South Korea’s won dropped 0.1 percent to 1,112.68 from Sept.
28 as traders returned from a holiday yesterday, when China
reported manufacturing contracted for a second month in
September. Korean data issued today showed consumer prices
increased 2 percent last month from a year earlier, accelerating
from 1.2 percent in August and more than the 1.8 percent
forecast by economists. Financial markets will shut again
tomorrow for a public holiday.  Elsewhere in Asia, Indonesia’s rupiah rose 0.1 percent to
9,581 per dollar. Taiwan’s dollar advanced 0.1 percent to
NT$29.385 and Vietnam’s dong was little changed at 20,885.
Chinese markets are closed all week for holidays, while Indian
markets are shut today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
