INA Industrija Nafte d.d ., the
Croatian refiner controlled by Hungary’s  Mol Nyrt (MOL) , rose to a
record after the company was reinstated on the Crobex10, the
Zagreb stock exchange index of 10 leading companies.  INA’s stock rose 0.3 percent, or 12.25 kuna, to 4,500 kuna
at 11:21 a.m. in Zagreb, marking a 27 percent increase since
this year’s low on April 6. INA returned to the Crobex10 index
yesterday after being excluded for more than a year because of a
trading suspension.  “ Index funds  are buying the stock to rebalance their
portfolios after INA was reinstated,” Milan Potnar, an equity
analyst at  Soc-Gen Splitska Banka d.d. , said by phone.  Mol holds a 49.1 percent stake in INA, while the Croatian
government owns 44.84 percent. The government in the last two
years has attempted to increase its influence in INA, after Mol
won controlling rights to  Croatia ’s largest refiner in 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
