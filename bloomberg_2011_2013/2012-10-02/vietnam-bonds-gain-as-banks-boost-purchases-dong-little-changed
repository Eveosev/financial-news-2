Vietnam ’s five-year bonds rose,
driving yields down by the most in more than five weeks, on
speculation banks bought debt with surplus cash following a
slowdown in lending. The dong was little changed.  Loans increased 2.35 percent in 2012 from the end of last
year as of Sept. 20, the government said in a statement on its
website Sept. 27. The central bank already downgraded its full-
year estimate in August to between 8 percent and 10 percent,
compared with 15 percent to 17 percent previously, as a slowdown
in economic growth hurts credit.  “Right now liquidity in the system overall is good,” said
Nguyen Tan Thang, fixed-income investment director at Ho Chi
Minh City Securities Joint-Stock Co. “If banks have a lot of
money, they buy bonds.”  The yield on the notes fell four basis points, or 0.04
percentage point, to 10.15 percent, according to a daily fixing
rate from banks compiled by Bloomberg.  Vietnam’s  economy  may expand 5.2 percent this year, the
government said last month, which would be the weakest since 4.8
percent growth in 1999, according to International Monetary Fund
data.  Vietnam’s  overnight interbank deposit rate , at which banks
lend to each other, has fallen 435 basis points since Aug. 24 to
2.45 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The dong traded at 20,885 per dollar as of 3:51 p.m. in
Hanoi, compared with 20,883 yesterday, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. The  State Bank  of Vietnam set its reference rate
at 20,828, unchanged since Dec. 26, according to the website.
The currency is allowed to trade as much as 1 percent on either
side of the rate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
