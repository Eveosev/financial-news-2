(Corrects peso volatility level in second paragraph.)  Mexican peso volatility is holding
near a one-year low as record inflows from foreign investors
seeking to profit from the country’s higher-yielding assets
offset the  European debt crisis ’ drag on the currency.  One-month historical volatility, which measures the
magnitude of the peso’s fluctuations over the period, was 9.07
percent at 4 p.m. in Mexico City, the lowest level since July
2011, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The currency
depreciated 0.2 percent to 12.8563 per  U.S. dollar .  Foreign mutual funds, pensions and  hedge funds  have poured
a record amount into Mexican securities in 2012, according to
EPFR Global data. That surge has helped to fuel a 8.4 percent
rally in the peso, the biggest winner among the dollar’s most-
traded counterparts tracked by Bloomberg.  “These flows have been compensating a bit for global
uncertainty,”  Rafael Camarena , an economist at  Banco Santander
SA (SAN) , said by phone from Mexico City. The result has been “peso
stabilization.”  The peso posted the worst performance among major Latin
American currencies last year as the sovereign-debt crisis in
Europe and its effects on global growth damped demand for
higher-yielding assets.  Yields on peso-denominated bonds due in 2024 rose three
basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 5.43 percent today,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The price fell 0.26
centavo to 140.75 centavos per peso.  To contact the reporter on this story:
