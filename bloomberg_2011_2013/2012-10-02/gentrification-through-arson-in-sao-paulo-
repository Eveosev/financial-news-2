Real estate in  Sao Paulo  has been booming in recent years. Fires have devastated slums in or near the most desirable areas. Is there a connection? That's been a subject of debate in Brazil’s largest city for weeks.  So far this year, 34 fires have been recorded in Sao Paulo's so-called favelas. On her blog, Raquel Rolnik, a professor of architecture and urbanism at the University of Sao Paulo,  suggested the blazes were linked   to gentrification projects: She questioned why the city’s plan for fire prevention in precarious settlements was not working. Joao F. Finazzi, a student of international relations at Pontificia Universidade Catolica de Sao Paulo, developed the analysis further. In a blog piece titled "Don’t Believe in Spontaneous Combustion,"  he wrote  that the last nine favela fires had occurred in areas in which just seven percent of the city’s 1,565 favelas are situated. He documented how each of these areas had experienced among the steepest increases in real estate prices. For instance, the fire-struck Sao Miguel favela is situated next to the Ermelino Matarazzo neighborhood, which has seen the highest housing appreciation in the city: 214 percent between 2009 and 2011. Where property prices were not rising, there were fewer favela fires, though more favelas, Finazzi wrote. He concluded, "To think of coincidence in a situation like this is to want to close your eyes to the world." Both Finazzi and Rolnik said that the city council's commission of inquiry into the favela fires, which was set up in March, had achieved little so far. Finazzi linked to a  blog posting  in which journalist and political scientist Leonardo Sakamoto wrote scathingly of the prospect for corrective measures. "The contractors and real estate speculators are here, donating to campaigns, lending relatives to public jobs, influencing the observance and non-observance of rules," he said. "Meanwhile another favela burned in Sao Paulo." Sakamoto added: “ Brazil  is becoming a giant construction site. The problem is that there are people living in the places where they want to build.” The favela fires reached national attention after a particularly damaging inferno Sept. 17 in Moinho, a prime location under a bridge in the city’s old center. One person died and 320 were made homeless. It was the second fire in the same favela: two died and 1,500 were made homeless following a blaze there in December 2011. In an  opinion piece  in the Folha de Sao Paulo newspaper, Brazil’s biggest, Andre Delfino da Silva, coordinator of the Favela Residents Defense Movement, and Raimundo Bonfim, general coordinator of the Sao Paulo State Popular Movements Central, drew a link between recent fires and real estate prices and lamented the suffering of favela residents. The unsigned Drizzle Blog, named after the city’s famous light rain, for the Estadao newspaper,  lamented  the "hell in the lives of the hundreds of residents who lost the little they had, consumed by fire.” The piece added, "This is a precarious Sao Paulo, which many people don’t notice but that insists in existing without the authorities taking account.” Conservative columnist Reinaldo Azevedo took issue with press reports blaming the Moinho blaze on shortcomings of the city's fire prevention plan. In his widely read blog for the weekly news magazine Veja,  he wrote : Azevedo noted that the police said it suspected the fire started when one member of a fighting couple, both of whom were drug users, set fire to the other: As for what was behind the larger spate of favela fires, Jair de  Lima , coordinator of Sao Paulo’s  Civil Defense , was asked this question on the Sunday television show  Fantastico . His reply was that the city had passed through a long, dry spell. He said: He noted that favela houses are often precariously constructed; that many residents steal electricity from  power lines , which can result in short circuits; that furniture is cheap and flammable; and that stoves use bottled gas, which is prone to leaks. The show ran a tape of three shacks being set on fire at a fire brigade training center to demonstrate how quickly a blaze can spread. Yet the reporter of the segment  also said: “In some cases, according to Civil Defense, fire is started by criminal actions, caused by those interested in the land.” A long dry spell, highly flammable houses, motives for arson. It all adds up to a hot season for Sao Paulo's favelas, and good reason to question the city's fire prevention capacities. (Dom Phillips is the Rio de Janeiro correspondent for World View.
