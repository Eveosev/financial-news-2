The  Philippines  will seek “more
proactive action” from the United Nations General Assembly to
resolve maritime disputes, Foreign Affairs Secretary Albert del
Rosario said.  “The UN was created to protect the weak from the strong,”
he said, according to a copy of a speech e-mailed by his office
today. Del Rosario made the remarks at the UN meeting in New
York on Oct. 1, according to his office.  All states must respect their obligations to settle
territorial disputes peacefully under the UN Convention on the
Law of the Sea, del Rosario said. He didn’t mention  China , with
which the Philippines is locked in a dispute over areas of the
South China Sea.  To contact the reporter on this story:
