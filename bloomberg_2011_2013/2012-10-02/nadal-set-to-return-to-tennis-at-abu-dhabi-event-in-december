Rafael Nadal has committed to playing
an exhibition tennis tournament in Abu Dhabi in December, his 
first event since he lost in the second round of Wimbledon in
June.  Organizers of the Mubadala World Tennis Championship today
announced the third-ranked Nadal is among a line-up of players
including U.S. Open champion Andy Murray of Britain and
Australian Open winner  Novak Djokovic  of Serbia who will compete
at the Dec. 27-29 event.  Spainâ€™s Nadal, an eleven-time Grand Slam singles champion,
has been recovering from a knee injury since his Wimbledon
defeat.  The Abu Dhabi competition is a warm-up for the Australian
Open, which starts Jan. 14 in  Melbourne .  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
