Miguel Cabrera  of the Detroit Tigers
regained the American League lead with his 44th home run of the
season as he seeks to become Major League Baseball’s first
hitter to win the Triple Crown since Carl Yastrzemski in 1967.  Cabrera also leads the AL with a .329 batting average and
his 137 runs batted in are the best in the majors with two days
left in the regular season.  Cabrera, the Tigers’ third baseman, had four hits in five
at-bats last night as Detroit beat the Kansas City Royals 6-3 to
capture the AL Central Division title and earn back-to-back
postseason appearances for the first time since 1934-35.  Cabrera’s solo home run in the sixth inning last night
moved him one ahead of  Josh Hamilton  of the Texas Rangers for
the AL lead. In the AL batting race, Cabrera remains just ahead
of Los Angeles Angels rookie outfielder Mike Trout, who boosted
his average to .325 by going 4-for-5 last night.  Yastrzemski was the last hitter to win the Triple Crown 45
years ago by batting .326 with 44 homers and 121 RBI for the 
Boston Red Sox. Frank Robinson,  Mickey Mantle ,  Ted Williams , Lou Gehrig, Jimmie Foxx, Ty Cobb and Nap Lajoie are the only other 
players in AL history to win the Triple Crown.  Cabrera’s Tigers finish the regular season in Kansas City
with games today and tomorrow against the Royals.  To contact the reporter on this story:
