A federal appeals court in Manhattan
upheld a ruling against  Morgan Stanley & Co. (MS)  in a breach-of-
contract suit accusing it of failing to pay a  Citigroup Inc. (C) 
unit $245 million under a swap agreement.  Citibank NA arranged the swap for protection in the event
that a collateralized debt obligation based on a line of credit
provided to an entity called Capmark defaulted, according to the
ruling today.  Citibank sued in 2009, alleging that Morgan Stanley refused
to pay the shortfall owed under the swap after Capmark defaulted
on its loan agreements and the $366 million CDO was liquidated.
In 2011, U.S. District Judge Shira A. Scheindlin ordered Morgan
Stanley to pay $245 million plus interest.  The appeals court rejected Morgan Stanley’s argument that
it wasn’t obligated to pay because  Citibank NA  ordered the CDO
liquidated without Morgan Stanley’s permission.  Lauren Onis, a spokeswoman for New York-based Morgan
Stanley, declined to comment on the appeals court ruling.  “We are pleased with the decision of the Second Circuit of
Appeals affirming the judgment in our favor,” Danielle Romero- Apsilos, a spokeswoman for New York-based Citigroup, said in an
e-mailed statement.  The case is Citibank N.A. v. Morgan Stanley & Co.
