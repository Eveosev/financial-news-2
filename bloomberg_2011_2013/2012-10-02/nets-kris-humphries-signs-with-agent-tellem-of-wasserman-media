Brooklyn Nets forward Kris Humphries
has signed with agent Arn Tellem of Wasserman Media Group, which
now represents three-fifths of the team’s starting lineup.  The firm’s clients also include Nets center Brook Lopez and
guard  Joe Johnson , whom the team acquired in a trade with the
 Atlanta Hawks  during the offseason.  Humphries, who signed a two-year, $24 million contract
during the offseason, had been represented by agent Dan Fegan,
whose agency was a part of Lagardere Unlimited.  “My understanding is that Kris left because he is seeking
stronger marketing support for his brand than he thought he was
getting at Lagardere,” Fegan said in a telephone interview.
“Kris is a great person and a great player. Our entire team
wishes him well.”  The National Basketball Players Association, which governs
agents, said Humphries has no agent listed on file. His joining
Wasserman was confirmed via e-mail by agency spokeswoman
Stephanie Rudnick.  Wasserman will represent Humphries in contract,
endorsement, marketing and public relations matters.  The 2012-13 season marks the Nets’ first in Brooklyn, where
they’ll play in the $1 billion Barclays Center.  Humphries, 27, averaged a career-best 13.8 points and 11
rebounds last season. He gained increased notoriety for a 72-day
marriage to reality TV star  Kim Kardashian .  To contact the reporter on this story:
