Manila Water Co. signed a $137.5
million loan agreement with the  Land Bank  of the Philippines to
partially finance a sewer project, the utility said today in a
stock exchange filing.  The loan, which is funded by the  World Bank , will finance
the North and South Pasig Sewerage System project, said the
company that supplies water to half of the Philippine capital.
The shares rose 1.6 percent to a record close of 27.90 pesos.  Revenue at the  Ayala Corp. (AC)  unit will probably be better
than a year earlier, Chief Financial Officer Luis Juan Oreta
said on Sept. 28. Second-half sales will increase from a year
earlier even if revenue won’t be as strong as the first half, he
said.  Manila Water’s first-half net income increased 31 percent
to 2.63 billion pesos ($63 million) from a year earlier on
higher billing volume, it said in August. Revenue rose 24
percent as the total billed water volume increased 36
percent, the utility said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
