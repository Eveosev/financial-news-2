A recent deal by  Cheniere Energy Inc. (LNG) 
to sell liquefied natural gas based on Henry Hub pricing has
made it difficult to sign long-term LNG contracts based on  oil
prices , the head of  Apache Corp. (APA) ’s Canadian LNG export projects
said.  “It created quite a ripple through the marketplace,” said
David Calvert, an Apache vice president and manager of the
Kitimat LNG joint venture. He said at a conference in Calgary
the deal has created “unrealistic expectations.”  Calvert said that new projects like the Kitimat LNG
project, which is being planned to export Canadian gas to Asia
from the British Columbia port of Kitimat, need long-term
contracts based on oil prices rather than gas prices.  North American natural gas prices have plunged against oil
amid a glut. In Asia, natural gas trades at as much as five
times U.S. prices.  Apache owns 40 percent of the Kitimat project and gas
producers  EOG Resources Inc. (EOG)  and  Encana Corp. (ECA)  30 percent each.  To contact the reporter on this story:
