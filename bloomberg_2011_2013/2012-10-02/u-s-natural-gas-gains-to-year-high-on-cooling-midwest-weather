Natural gas futures gained for a
sixth day in New York, rising to a 10-month high, on speculation
that cold weather next week will boost demand for heating fuels.  Gas rose 1.5 percent as Commodity Weather Group LLC in
Bethesda,  Maryland , predicted below-normal temperatures in the
Northeast and Midwest over the next six to 15 days. Gas broke
resistance of $3.40 per million British thermal units yesterday,
finding support there, said  Chris Kostas , senior gas analyst for
Energy Security Analysis Inc. in Andover,  Massachusetts .  “The market is building up a little enthusiasm,” said
Dominick Chirichella, senior partner at the Energy Management
Institute in New York. “There is a lot of cold weather coming
in the next couple of weeks.”  Natural gas for November delivery rose 5.1 cents to $3.531
per million Btu on the Nymex, the highest settlement price since
Dec. 2. The futures are up 18 percent this year.  November $3.75 calls, bets that prices will rise, were the
most active gas options in electronic trading. They rose 1.4
cents to 6.6 cents on volume of 1,913 contracts as of 2:20 p.m.
Calls accounted for 61 percent of options volume.  The low temperature in  Chicago  on Oct. 12 may be 39 degrees
Fahrenheit (4 Celsius), 8 below normal, and  New York City  may be
7 below normal at 44 degrees, according to AccuWeather Inc. in
 State College , Pennsylvania. Heating demand in the lower 48
states may be 60 percent above normal Oct. 8 through Oct. 12,
data show from Weather Derivatives in Belton,  Missouri .  Cool Weather  The heating season from November through March is the  peak
demand  period for U.S. gas consumption. Last winter was the
fourth-warmest on record in the lower 48 states, which  cut
demand  for the fuel.  MDA Earthsat Weather in Gaithersburg, Maryland, said
continental U.S. temperatures from December through February,
the peak heating season, will probably be above the 10-year and
30-year ranges.  “The plus-$3.50 level, without any real heating demand, is
going to be unsustainable,” said  Gene McGillian , an analyst and
broker at Tradition Energy in  Stamford ,  Connecticut . “As prices
rise, the attractiveness of coal-to-gas switching, which has
been a main driver of our rally this summer, starts to fall
off.”  Power plants  have been “more responsive to changes in
relative fossil-fuel prices” in the last few quarters than in
past years, The Energy Department said in its Sept. 11  Short-
Term Energy Outlook . Power plants account for 36 percent of U.S.
gas consumption.  Fuel Use  Generators may consume 25.21 billion cubic feet a day of
gas this year, up 21 percent from 2011, before demand slumps 8.4
percent in 2013 as gas prices rise, according to the outlook.
Gas at the  Henry Hub  in Erath,  Louisiana , the delivery point for
New York futures, exceeded the average spot price for Central
Appalachian coal in June for the first time since October 2011,
according to the department.  U.S. inventories  ended the week of Sept. 21 at 3.576
trillion cubic feet, 8.6 percent above the five-year average for
the period, a department report showed last week. The  surplus 
was down from 61 percent at the end of March.  Production in the lower 48 states has increased as drilling
techniques such as hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, made it
economic to tap vast reserves locked in shale formations deep
underground.  Total U.S. production will gain 4 percent this year to
average 68.86 billion cubic feet a day from last year’s record
of 66.22 billion, the department estimated.  Technical Indicator  A technical indicator that measures the magnitude of price
gains relative to declines is showing that gas may be
overbought. The relative strength index, or RSI, was 72.7 today,
after rising yesterday to 73.3, the highest since March 2008. A
number above 70 is watched by traders for a move below that
level, which can be considered a sell signal, Kostas said.
“It’s an indication that the surge in buying has eased.”  A settlement above $3.40 for a second day may indicate gas
“might be in the process of breaking out to the upside,” he
said.  Gas futures volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was
426,823 as of 2:36 p.m., compared with the three-month average
of 375,000. Volume was 561,798 yesterday. Open interest was
1.106 million contracts. The three-month average is 1.105
million.  The exchange has a one-business-day delay in reporting full
volume and open interest data.  ----With assistance from Brian K. Sullivan in  Boston . Editors:
