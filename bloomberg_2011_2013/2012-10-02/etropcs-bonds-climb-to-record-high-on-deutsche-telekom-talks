MetroPCS Communications Inc. (PCS)  bonds
rose to the highest level since they were sold in 2010 after
reports that  Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE)  is in talks to combine its T-
Mobile USA unit with the U.S. wireless business.  The company’s $1 billion of 6.625 percent bonds due in
November 2020 jumped 4.4 cents to 110 cents on the dollar at
1:49 p.m. in New York, according to Trace, the bond-price
reporting system of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.
The yield fell to 5.1 percent from 5.8 percent. The Richardson,
Texas-based company’s bonds gained the most in trading reported
to Trace today, the data show.  Deutsche Telekom would hold the majority of shares of the
combined company, the Bonn-based company confirmed in a
statement today.  Bloomberg News  first reported discussions
between the telecommunications providers earlier today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
