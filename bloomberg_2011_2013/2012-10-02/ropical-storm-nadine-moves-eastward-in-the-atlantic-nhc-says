Tropical Storm Nadine, which formed
three weeks ago, is moving east-southeastward toward the Azores,
according to the National Hurricane Center.  Nadine was about 665 miles (1,070 kilometers) west-
southwest of the Azores in the Atlantic with winds of 65 miles
per hour, the Miami-based center said in an  advisory  at 5 a.m.
Atlantic Standard Time.  The center is also monitoring a system about 800 miles
west-southwest of the Cape Verde Islands that has a 60 percent
chance of becoming a tropical cyclone in the next two days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
