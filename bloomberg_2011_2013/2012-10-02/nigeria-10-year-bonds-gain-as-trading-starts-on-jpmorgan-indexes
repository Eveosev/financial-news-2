Nigeria’s 10-year bonds gained on the
first trading day after their inclusion in JPMorgan Chase &
Co.’s global emerging market benchmark indexes, pushing yields
lower.  Yields on the 16.39 percent bonds maturing January 2022
dropped 16 basis points, or 0.16 percentage points, to 12.66
percent, according to today’s prices published on the Financial
Markets Dealers Association website.  The most-traded bonds maturing in March 2014, October 2019
and January 2022 will join JPMorgan’s GBI-EM indexes between
Oct. 1 and Dec. 3, Giulia Pellegrini, the bank’s London-based
sub-Saharan  Africa  economist, wrote in a note to clients Sept.
25. JPMorgan first disclosed the plans in August after central
bank Governor Lamido Sanusi’s decision last year to attract more
funds by removing restrictions on foreign investors holding debt
of Africa’s biggest oil producer.  Yields “will probably drift lower in coming weeks on the
back of the foreign demand and as local institutional investors
and banks seek to increase their duration exposure,”  Samir Gadio , an  emerging markets  strategist at Standard Bank Group
Ltd. in  London , said in an e-mailed reply to questions today.  The naira, which has been devalued twice by the central
bank since 2008 because of falling oil prices and import demand,
has strengthened 3.1 percent this year, the best performer in
Africa, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  While inflation in Nigeria slowed to 11.7 percent in August
from a high this year of 12.9 percent in April, it is still
above the central bank’s 10 percent target.  To contact the reporter on this story:
