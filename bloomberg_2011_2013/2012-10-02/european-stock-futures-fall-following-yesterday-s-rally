European stocks  declined, after
yesterday rallying the most in more than three weeks, as
companies from Alstom SA to  Erste Group Bank AG (EBS)  sold shares.  Alstom sank 4.9 percent after selling a 350 million-euro
($453 million) holding. Erste Group slipped 2.8 percent after
the lender’s largest shareholder sold a 235 million-euro stake.
 PostNL NV (PNL)  added 4.4 percent after the postal company said it
will increase rates next year.  The  Stoxx Europe 600 Index (SXXP)  slipped 0.3 percent to 271.62 at
the close after earlier rising as much as 0.4 percent and
falling as much as 0.7 percent. The equity benchmark has still
 rallied 16 percent  from this year’s low on June 4 as central
banks in the U.S. and the euro area turned to bond purchases to
stimulate growth and ensure the transmission of record-low
 interest rates .  “It’s a difficult period for investors to place bets,”
said  David Hussey , who helps oversee $218 billion as head of
European equities at Manulife Asset Management in  London . “The
global economy is going to recover, it’s just going to take a
while. In the long term, we are bullish on equities, but that is
really long term. In the interim, we will continue to have this
horrible trading-range type mentality.”  The Stoxx 600 and the Euro Stoxx 50 Index, the gauge of the
largest companies in the euro area, have both failed to post
back-to-back gains or losses for the last 10 days.  European stocks yesterday rallied the most since Sept. 6
after stress tests bolstered confidence in  Spain ’s banking
system and a report showed  U.S. manufacturing  unexpectedly
expanded last month. The Stoxx 600 fell 2.7 percent last week
amid concern the U.S. Federal Reserve’s bond-buying program will
fail to encourage growth.  National Markets  National benchmark indexes fell in 10 of the 18 western-
European markets.  France ’s CAC 40 slipped 0.6 percent. The
U.K.’s FTSE 100 retreated 0.2 percent, while  Germany ’s DAX lost
0.3 percent. The volume of shares changing hands in Stoxx 600-
listed companies was 3 percent greater than the average of the
last 30 days, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Alstom (ALO)  retreated 4.9 percent to 26.85 euros after the
company sold stock at 26.65 euros apiece, a 5.6 percent discount
to yesterday’s close, to finance a Russian acquisition that it
announced in 2009. The  French engineering company  had said it
wouldn’t consider such a move.  Erste Group fell 2.8 percent to 17.18 euros after Erste
Stiftung, the Austrian bank’s largest shareholder, sold a 235
million-euro stake, reducing its holding to 20.2 percent. The 14
million shares were sold at 16.80 euros apiece.  Brenntag, Lloyds  Brenntag AG (BNR)  declined 1.7 percent to 98.83 euros after
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sold 496,212 shares in the chemical
distributor at 99 euros apiece.  Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY)  retreated 2.4 percent to 39.03
pence and  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc  dropped 3.3 percent
to 257.5 pence after UBS AG lowered its recommendation on both
lenders to hold from buy, citing concern the banks may have to
raise more capital.  PostNL climbed 4.4 percent to 2.81 euros, rising for the
first time in nine days, after the Dutch mail-service company
said it will increase postage stamp rates in 2013 because its
volume of deliveries has fallen.  Swiss Re Ltd. (SREN)  added 2.7 percent to 63 Swiss francs after
 Societe Generale SA (GLE)  upgraded the world’s second-biggest
reinsurer to buy from hold. The brokerage said that the company
may pay about $2.5 billion in special dividends through 2014.  Finmeccanica SpA (FNC)  gained 3.2 percent to 4.01 euros after  Il
Sole 24 Ore  reported that Economic Development Minister Corrado Passera has approved Fondo Strategico Italiano SpA’s offer for
the company’s Ansaldo Energia unit. The newspaper did not say
where it got the information.  Babcock, Bumi  Babcock International Group Plc (BAB)  climbed 2.4 percent to 945
pence after saying it remained confident of meeting its full-
year targets. The engineering-services company also said its
businesses continued to benefit from buoyant civil and military
markets in the second quarter.  Bumi Plc (BUMI)  surged 6.5 percent to 159.5 pence after PT Bumi
Resources said it will raise cash to accelerate the repayment of
its debt. The company, founded by  Nathaniel Rothschild  and owner
of 29 percent of the Jakarta-based miner, said on Sept. 24 that
it began investigating “potential financial and other
irregularities” and hired lawyers to look into a $637 million
writedown of development funds and exploration assets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
