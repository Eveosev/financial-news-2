Croatia  asked Slovenia to jointly
approach the  Bank for International Settlements  to settle a
banking dispute, almost two years after the BIS declined to
mediate over money owed to Croat savers by the predecessor of
Nova Ljubljanska Banka d.d.  “We are suggesting that both countries, once again, turn
to BIS over the issue,” Danijela Barisic, a spokeswoman at the
 Foreign Ministry  in Zagreb, said by phone.  Croatia, which needs Slovenia to ratify its European Union
membership to enter the bloc in July 2013, has barred NLB from
operating in neighboring Croatia while the dispute remains
unsettled. The Ljubljana-based debt is estimated at 312 million
deutsche marks ($204 million), the former German currency that
was widely used in former  Yugoslavia .  The Basel-based  BIS  in 2010 rejected a moderator’s role,
saying it could not bring any added value to negotiations.  An EU member since 2004, Slovenia blocked its neighbor’s EU
accession talks for 10 months in 2009 over a border issue. The
two countries in January agreed on a panel of legal experts to
work out a resolution. Slovenia’s France Arhar and Croatia’s
Zdenko Rogic met twice in recent weeks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
