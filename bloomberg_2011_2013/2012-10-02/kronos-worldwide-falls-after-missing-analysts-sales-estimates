Kronos Worldwide Inc. (KRO) , a producer of
titanium dioxide pigments for paints and plastics, gained after
reporting preliminary sales.  Kronos, based in Dallas, increased 2.6 percent to $15.16 at
the close in New York. The shares have fallen 16 percent this
year.  Third-quarter net sales will be $480 million to $495
million, compared with $548 million last year, because of lower
sales volumes, the company said in a statement today. Segment
profits will be $35 million to $45 million, compared with $159.2
million a year earlier, Kronos said.  The titanium dioxide industry has seen sales and production
volumes decline because of global economic weakness, Kronos
said. The company received  58 percent  of its revenue from  Europe 
in 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
