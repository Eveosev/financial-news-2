AT&T Inc. (T) , the largest U.S. phone
company, will buy 9.6 megawatts of fuel cells from Bloom Energy
Corp. to make its power costs more predictable.  AT&T is now Bloom’s largest non-utility customer, according
to a statement today. Dallas-based AT&T bought 7.5 megawatts of
the so-called Bloom Boxes in July 2011.  Bloom’s systems use a chemical reaction to generate
electricity from air and natural gas at a constant rate. That
helps users manage their power expenses, according to AT&T’s
Senior Energy Director John Schinter.  “They provide steady, recurring electricity production at
a relatively predictable cost, replacing the traditional
electricity bill, which can be volatile,” he said in the
statement. AT&T didn’t give a price for the purchase.  Power from Bloom’s systems costs “a good bit more” than
electricity purchased from utilities, Ted Hesser, an analyst for
Bloomberg New Energy Finance in  New York , said today in an
interview. “Presumably, they’re getting a more reliable source
of energy so they’re willing to pay a premium.”  Executives from Bloom, a closely held company based in
Sunnyvale,  California , weren’t immediately available for
comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
