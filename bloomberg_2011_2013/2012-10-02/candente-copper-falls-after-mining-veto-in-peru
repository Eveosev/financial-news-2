Candente Copper Corp. (DNT) , a Canadian
company exploring for the metal in  Peru , fell to its lowest in
more than two years after a rural community in Peru voted
against mining.  Candente  declined  8.1 percent to 40 Canadian cents at the
close in Toronto, the lowest price since Sept. 20, 2010. The
Vancouver-based company has fallen 59 percent this year.  A Sept. 30 vote by some members of the Comunidad Campesina
San Juan De Kanaris to stop mining isn’t “legally binding,”
according to Candente’s Peruvian counsel, the company said in a
statement today. The community previously voted on July 8 to
grant the company surface access for three years of exploratory
drilling.  Candente’s Canariaco Norte project in northern Peru is
estimated to hold 7.53 billion pounds of copper, according to
its website. “The company plans to mobilize for drilling as
soon as the remaining formal documentation is received from the
Ministry,” it said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
