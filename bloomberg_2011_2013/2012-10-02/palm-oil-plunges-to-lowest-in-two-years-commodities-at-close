time. The UBS Bloomberg CMCI  index  of 26 raw materials gained
0.2 percent to 1,638.729.  CRUDE OIL  Oil traded near the highest close in a week after a measure
of U.S. manufacturing beat economists’ forecasts and before a
report forecast to show shrinking fuel supplies in the world’s
biggest consumer of crude.  Crude for November delivery was at $92.33 a barrel, down 15
cents, in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile Exchange 
at 2:15 p.m. Singapore time. The contract climbed 0.3 percent to

down 6.6 percent this year.  OIL PRODUCTS  High-sulfur  fuel oil  was down 46 cents at $4.39 a barrel
below Asian marker Dubai crude at 10:02 a.m. Singapore time,

the biggest discount since May 14. Fuel oil swaps for November
slid $1, or 0.2 percent, to $663 a metric ton, PVM said.

to $18.75 a barrel at 10:02 a.m. Singapore time, according
to PVM. This crack spread, a gauge of processing profit, is the
narrowest since Sept. 12. Gasoil swaps for November were
unchanged after declining to $127.55 a barrel, PVM data showed.  BASE METALS  Copper was set to decline for the first time in four days
after a report said that the capital shortfall of Spanish banks
could be almost double a government estimate and as stockpiles
climbed to a one-month high.  Copper for delivery in three months lost as much as 0.4
percent to $8,270 a metric ton before trading at $8,291 on the
London Metal Exchange at 3:57 p.m. in Tokyo. The metal touched
$8,316.75 yesterday, the highest since Sept. 21. December-
delivery metal fell 0.2 percent to $3.78 a pound on the Comex.  PRECIOUS METALS  Gold may advance for a second day after Federal Reserve

reached a record 2,551.86 tons on Sept. 25, the data show.  GRAINS, OILSEEDS, SOFT COMMODITIES  Palm oil  plunged to the lowest level in more than two years
on concern that slowing demand will continue to cut shipments
from the two biggest producers and swell the global glut.  The December-delivery contract lost as much as 3.7 percent
to 2,373 ringgit ($777) a metric ton, the lowest price for the
most-active contract on the Malaysia Derivatives Exchange since
July 2010. Futures were at 2,378 ringgit at 3:34 p.m. in  Kuala
Lumpur , taking the five-day loss to 10.9 percent, the biggest
such decline since 2009.  Rubber jumped to a four-month high, erasing this year’s
losses, after the world’s largest producers began cutting
exports by the most since 2009, reducing supplies.  March-delivery rubber rose 3.8 percent to end at 270.4 yen
a kilogram ($3,464 a metric ton) on the  Tokyo  Commodity
Exchange, the highest settlement for the most active contract
since May 30. Futures have gained 2.7 percent this year.  Soybeans dropped to the lowest in more than two months and
corn fell as harvesting in the U.S. advanced at the fastest pace
in at least three decades, aided by warm and dry weather after a
drought reduced yields.  November-delivery soybeans lost as much as 0.6 percent to
$15.51 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade, the lowest price
for the most-active contract since July 27, and traded at

percent yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
