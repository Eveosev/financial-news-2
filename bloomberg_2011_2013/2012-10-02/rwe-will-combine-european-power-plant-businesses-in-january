RWE AG (RWE) ,  Europe ’s largest emitter of
carbon dioxide, will combine its fossil-fuel power plant
businesses in  Germany , the U.K. and the Netherlands into a
single Essen-based unit from the start of next year.  RWE Generation SE will have a total generation capacity of
50,000 megawatts and about 18,000 staff, Germany’s second-
largest utility said today in a statement.  RWE Generation will be “one of Europe’s biggest generation
companies,” Essen-based RWE said. “RWE Generation will deliver
greater synergy and improve efficiency in a market environment
that is currently difficult and uncertain,” said Rolf Martin Schmitz, RWE deputy chief executive officer, who  will oversee
the new company.  Frank Weigand, currently chief financial officer of RWE
npower, will become CFO of RWE Generation, and Alan Robinson
will become chief commercial officer. Currently he holds this
position at RWE Supply & Trading GmbH.  Matthias Hartung, who has already been appointed CEO of RWE
Generation and currently heads RWE Technology GmbH, will
additionally take the helm at RWE Power AG, the German power
generation unit, from Johannes Lambertz.  To contact the reporter on this story:
