OAO Phosagro,  Europe ’s largest
producer of phosphate fertilizers, may offer minority
shareholders of its OAO Apatit unit the opportunity to swap
their shares for parent-company stock,  RBC Daily  reported.  Phosagro said yesterday it will buy the Russian
government’s 26.7 percent stake in Apatit for about $360
million. The company will now need to make a mandatory offer to
Apatit minorities and may offer them Phosagro shares instead of
cash, the newspaper said, citing an unidentified Phosagro
official.  To contact the reporter on this story:
