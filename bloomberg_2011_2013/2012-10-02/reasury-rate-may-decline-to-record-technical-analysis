Treasury 10-year yields may decline
to a record low of 1.1 percent after having formed a so-called
double-top reversal,  Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc. (8316)  said,
citing trading patterns.  The benchmark rate peaked at 1.86 percent on Aug. 21 and
1.89 percent on Sept. 14, levels unseen since May, climbing from
the all-time low of 1.38 percent set on July 25. Between the two
highs, the yield bottomed out at 1.54 percent. The rate may fall
toward 1.1 percent by year-end, said Daisuke Uno, chief
strategist in  Tokyo  at a unit of  Sumitomo Mitsui , Japan’s
second-largest bank by market value.  “The next target will be around 1.1 percent, assuming that
yields drop about 0.4 percentage point, the difference between
the peak at 1.89 percent and trough at 1.54 percent,” Uno said.  Ten-year  yields  were little changed yesterday at 1.62
percent, based on Bloomberg Bond Trader data. The price of the
1.625 percent security due August 2022 was 100 1/32.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
