Manny Banuelos, the  New York Yankees ’
top minor league pitching prospect, will have surgery this week
to repair a ligament in his left elbow that probably will force
him to miss the 2013 season.  Banuelos, a 21-year-old left-hander, is scheduled for
surgery on Oct. 4 in  Pensacola ,  Florida , the Yankees said. The
team didn’t give details of the injury or a timetable for
Banuelos’s return, though it usually takes Major League Baseball
players 12 to 18 months to come back from the procedure, known
as Tommy John surgery.  Banuelos, who is listed as the Yankees’ top pitching
prospect by MLB.com, had been sidelined since May 18, when the
Yankees said he suffered a bone bruise in his pitching elbow. He
was shut down for the season in August, at which time the team
said Banuelos wasn’t expected to need surgery.  In six starts this year for the Yankees’ Triple-A minor-
league affiliate in Scranton/Wilkes-Barre, he had a 0-2 record
with a 4.50 earned-run average and 22 starts. Banuelos signed
with the organization in March 2008 and has averaged 9.2
strikeouts per nine innings in the minor leagues.  To contact the reporter on this story:
