Fortescue Metals Group Ltd. (FMG) , a
producer of iron ore, will hold a lender meeting tomorrow at
9:30 a.m. in New York to discuss a $4.5 billion covenant-lite
term loan itâ€™s seeking to refinance debt, according to a person
with knowledge of the transaction.  Credit Suisse Group AG is arranging the financing for the
Perth, Australia-based company and commitments will be due Oct.
10, said the person, who asked not to be identified because the
deal is private.  The five-year debt will pay interest at 4.75 percentage
points more than the London interbank offered rate, said the
person. Libor, a rate banks say they can borrow in dollars from
each other, will have a 1.25 percent floor.  Fortescue is proposing to sell the loan at 99 cents on the
dollar, the person said, reducing proceeds for the company and
boosting the yield to investors.  Lenders are being offered one-year soft-call protection of
101 cents, according to the person, meaning the company would
have to pay 1 cent more than face value to refinance the debt
during the first year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
