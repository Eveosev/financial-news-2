The  Chicago Bears  intercepted five
passes from Dallas Cowboys quarterback  Tony Romo , returning two
for touchdowns in a 34-18 win.  Chicago’s Charles Tillman scored on a 25-yard interception
return during the second quarter last night in Arlington, Texas,
and Lance Briggs returned another 74 yards for a touchdown in
the third. Romo’s five interceptions matched a career high as
the Cowboys fell to 2-2. The Bears are 3-1.  “You get pressure on the quarterback, you make him throw
the ball a little earlier, a little higher, and you give your
back seven the opportunity to make some plays,” Briggs said in
a televised interview. The Bears have now forced 14 turnovers
this season, the most in the  National Football League .  Jay Cutler  threw touchdown passes to Devin Hester and
 Brandon Marshall  for the Bears, whose road victory capped Week 4
of the NFL’s regular season.  The 2,978 points scored so far this season broke the record
for any four-week period in NFL history, surpassing the previous
mark of 2,961 points from Week 12-15 in 2004.  Following a scoreless first quarter last night, the Bears
got 10 points in less than two minutes, as Robbie Gould kicked a
43-yard field goal and Tillman extended his franchise record
with his sixth interception return for a touchdown.  The Cowboys pulled within 10-7 on a 10-yard scoring pass
from Romo to Miles Austin 14 seconds before halftime.  The third-quarter touchdowns by Hester and Briggs increased
the Bears’ lead to 24-7. After the teams traded field goals,
Marshall hauled in a 31-yard touchdown pass from Cutler with
6:28 remaining to go up 34-10. Dallas tacked on a touchdown and
two-point conversion with 34 seconds left, yet fell to 14-12 at
Cowboys Stadium.  To contact the reporter on this story:
