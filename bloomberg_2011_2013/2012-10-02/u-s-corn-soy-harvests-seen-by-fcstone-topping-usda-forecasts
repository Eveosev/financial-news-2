Corn and soybean production in the
U.S., the worldâ€™s largest grower and exporter last year, will
exceed a government forecast, according to estimates by  INTL
FCStone Inc. (INTL)   Corn output will be 10.824 billion bushels, up from 10.727
billion forecast last month by the  U.S. Department of
Agriculture , FCStone said today in an e-mail report from its
 West Des Moines , Iowa, office. A month ago, the commodity
researcher and brokerage company said production would fall to
10.607 billion, compared with 12.358 billion a year ago.  The  soybean harvest  will be 2.849 billion bushels, compared
with 2.739 billion estimated in September, FCStone said. Last
month, the USDA projected 2.634 billion, down from 3.094 billion
a year earlier.  The USDA will update its forecasts on Oct. 11. Corn is the
biggest U.S. crop, valued at $76.5 billion in 2011, followed by
soybeans at $35.8 billion, government figures show.  Corn futures on the Chicago Board of Trade rose to a record
$8.49 a bushel on Aug. 10, and soybeans surged to an all-time
high of $17.89 a bushel on Sept. 4.  To contact the reporter on this story:
