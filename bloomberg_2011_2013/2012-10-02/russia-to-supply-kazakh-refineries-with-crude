Russia will supply Kazakh refineries
with 7 million metric tons of crude this year and the same
amount in 2013, according to the head of the Central Asian
country’s Pavlodar refinery.  Kazakhstan ’s Shymkent refinery has already received 2
million tons this year, Pavlodar Chief Executive Officer
Shukhrat Danbay said at a conference in Astana today. The two
countries will continue talks for an agreement on 2014 supply.  Russia will also provide Kazakhstan with as much as 2
million tons of oil products a year, Danbay said, without being
specific on time frame. Kazakhstan, which is in a customs union
with Russia and Belarus, will compensate its northern neighbor
for export duties it would have received from shipments outside
the bloc.  The lost tax revenue will be about $500 million a year and
will be reimbursed using Kazakh oil priced at the same level as
the refineries paid for Russian crude, he said.  The Pavlodar refinery, which uses crude from Siberia, plans
to finish a $1.7 billion upgrade by 2016 so that it will be able
to process any grade of oil, he said.  KazMunaiGaz National Co. owns Pavlodar and, together with
China National Petroleum Corp., the Shymkent plant.  Pavlodar can process 100,411 barrels a day while Shymkent’s
capacity is 160,000 barrels a day, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
