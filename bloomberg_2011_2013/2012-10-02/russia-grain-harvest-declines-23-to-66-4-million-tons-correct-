(Corrects state grain plans in last paragraph.)  Russia , the third-biggest wheat
exporter last season, harvested 66.4 million metric tons of
grains as of Sept. 28, compared with 86.5 million tons a year
earlier, Deputy Agriculture Minister Ilya Shestakov told
reporters today in Moscow.  That is a decline of about 23 percent after dry weather
damaged crops and led to cuts in harvest estimates. Shestakov
reiterated the  Agriculture Ministry â€™s target of 72 million to 73
million tons of grain this year.  Domestic prices are about 8,658 rubles ($278) a ton for
third-grade wheat, he said. The state may sell 500,000 tons of
grain from stockpiles in state auctions to cut prices, he said.
The starting price of the auctions most likely would be
7,500 rubles a ton, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
