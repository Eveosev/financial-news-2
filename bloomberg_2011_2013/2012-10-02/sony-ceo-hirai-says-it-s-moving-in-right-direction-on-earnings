Sony Corp. (6758)  Chief Executive Officer
Kazuo Hirai comments on the Japanese electronics maker’s full-
year earnings outlook, its  cash  position after agreeing to
invest in  Olympus Corp. (7733) , and new 4K high-resolution TVs. He
spoke today at the CEATEC electronics show in Chiba, near Tokyo.  On the full-year earnings outlook:  “We see some ups and downs depending on  territories  and
 product  categories.”  “We are ahead of plans in turning the TV business around.
There are differences in product categories but overall, I think
we are moving in the right direction.”  On cash position after Olympus agreement:  “We have been looking at our cash balance, including
equivalents as well, and the way our  balance sheet  looks, and
making sure as we do these acquisitions, that we are mindful of
cash position.”  On Sony’s new 4K-resolution TV models:  “With 4K TV sets, pricing right now is not a mass market
proposition, but it’s more of our message to the market about a
leadership position we’d like to take in the 4K market as well
as making sure we have a flagship product to really get 4K
taking off right away.”  “Sony has a very deep DNA in creating the best picture and
the best sound, and 4K Bravia is kind of an example of that DNA.
We’re certainly committed to the TV business.”  On Sony’s revival:  “We’re basically executing the strategy announced in
April. I feel good about where we are. We obviously need to do
more and show  results .”  To contact the reporter on this story:
