p.m., the highest level since Dec. 7.  The UBS Bloomberg CMCI  index  of 26 raw materials increased
to 1,518.97 at 4:14 p.m.  CRUDE OIL   Crude oil rose for a sixth day, the longest stretch in 13
months, as  Iran  threatened to block transportation through the
Strait of Hormuz and confidence among U.S. consumers beat
expectations in December.  Crude advanced after Iran’s official Islamic Republic News
Agency cited Vice President Mohammad Reza Rahimi as saying the
country would bar shipments through the strait if sanctions are
imposed on its oil exports. Prices also gained as the Conference
Board’s index reached the highest level since April, exceeding
all forecasts in a Bloomberg survey.  Crude oil for February delivery climbed $1.66, or 1.7
percent, to settle at $101.34 a barrel on the New York

percent, to $109.27 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures
Europe exchange. The European contract’s premium to crude in  New

threatened to block the flow of crude oil.  Futures advanced as the Conference Board’s index jumped to
64.5 from a revised 55.2 reading in November.  January-delivery heating oil gained 1.78 cents, or 0.6
percent, to settle at $2.9085 a gallon on the  New York

$2.6888 a gallon, a seven-week high. Prices climbed 8 percent

below-normal temperatures may boost demand for the fuel without
curbing a growing inventory surplus.  Futures advanced as much as 2.2 percent and fell as much as
1.2 percent. Temperatures in Boston will drop to 14 degrees
Fahrenheit (minus 10 Celsius) on Jan. 6, 9 below normal, New

soybeans jumped the most in 11 weeks on speculation that adverse
weather threatens to reduce output in  South America , bolstering
demand for U.S. supplies.  About 50 percent of the crops in  Argentina  will be dry in
the next 10 days after weekend rain stayed north of the main
growing regions, Commodity Weather Group LLC said in a report.
As much as a third of  Brazil ’s crops face a lack of rain, the
forecaster said.  Corn futures for March delivery advanced 2.2 percent to

shipments. Hogs also dropped.  Meatpackers slaughtered 598,000 cattle last week, down 6.9
percent from a week earlier, government data show. Areas in
northern  Texas , Colorado, western Oklahoma and Kansas got 2
