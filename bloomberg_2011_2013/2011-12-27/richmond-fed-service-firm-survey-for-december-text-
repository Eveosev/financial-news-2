The following is the text from
the Richmond Federal Reserve Bank’s service sector activity
survey for December.  Activity in the broad service sector gained momentum in December,
bolstered by improvement in the non-retail services subsector,
according to the latest survey by the Federal Reserve Bank of
Richmond. However, total retail sales slowed and big-ticket
sales weakened compared to November’s survey. Shopper traffic
flattened at retail establishments. Retail inventories increased
more slowly than a month ago. At non-retail services firms,
revenues rose sharply in December. Survey participants were
upbeat about business prospects for the first half of 2012.  Hiring picked up notably at non-retail services firms, while
retailers reduced their payrolls further this month. Average
wage increases prevailed in the service sector.  Price change in the overall service sector increased at a
slightly faster pace in December than in November. Looking ahead
six months, survey respondents expected prices in the broad
service sector to increase at nearly the same rate as their
outlook a month ago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
