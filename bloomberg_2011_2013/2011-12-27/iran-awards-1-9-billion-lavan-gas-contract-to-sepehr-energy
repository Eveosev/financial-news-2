The Iranian Offshore Oil Co. awarded
a $1.9 billion contract to Sepehr Energy Co. to develop the
Lavan natural  gas field  after ending talks with Poland’s biggest
natural-gas company,  Mehr  reported.  The contract includes construction of a petrochemical
complex on Lavan island, agency said. Lavan contains about 10
trillion cubic feet of gas and has a capacity for producing 750
million cubic feet a day of natural gas, the state-run  news
agency  said.  Iran previously held talks with Poland’s biggest natural-
gas company over the development of the field, Mehr reported.
The country failed to reach an agreement with  Polskie Gornictwo
Naftowe i Gazownictwo SA (PGN)  due “to the company‘s long delays in
signing the deal,’’ Mehr said.  The field will come onstream in 54 months, the oil ministry
said on its website Shana.  To contact the reporter on this story:
