Following is the text of U.S.
consumer confidence from the Conference Board.  The Conference Board Consumer Confidence Index, which had
improved in November, increased further in December. The Index
now stands at 64.5 (1985=100), up from 55.2 in November. The
Present Situation Index increased to 46.7 from 38.3. The
Expectations Index rose to 76.4 from 66.4.  The monthly Consumer Confidence Survey, based on a
probability-design random sample, is conducted for The
Conference Board by Nielsen, a leading global provider of
information and analytics around what consumers buy and watch.
The cutoff date for the preliminary results was December 14.  Says  Lynn Franco , Director of The Conference Board Consumer
Research Center: “After two months of considerable gains, the
Consumer Confidence Index is now back to levels seen last spring
(April 2011, 66.0). Consumers’ assessment of current business
and labor market conditions improved again. Looking ahead,
consumers are more optimistic that business conditions,
employment prospects, and their financial situations will
continue to get better. While consumers are ending the year in a
somewhat more upbeat mood, it is too soon to tell if this is a
rebound from earlier declines or a sustainable shift in
attitudes.”  Consumers’ assessment of current conditions improved in
December. Those stating business conditions are “good” increased
to 16.6 percent from 13.9 percent, while those stating business
conditions are “bad” declined to 33.9 percent from 38.0 percent.
Consumers’ assessment of the job market was also more positive.
Those claiming jobs are “plentiful” increased to 6.7 percent
from 5.6 percent, while those claiming jobs are “hard to get”
decreased to 41.8 percent from 43.0 percent.  Consumers’ short-term outlook also improved in December.
The proportion of consumers expecting business conditions to
improve over the next six months increased to 16.7 percent from
13.7 percent, while those expecting business conditions will
worsen declined to 13.4 percent from 16.1 percent.  Consumers’ outlook for the job market was also more
favorable. Those anticipating more jobs in the months ahead
increased to 13.3 percent from 12.4 percent, while those
anticipating fewer jobs declined to 20.2 percent from 23.8
percent. The proportion of consumers expecting an increase in
their incomes improved to 17.1 percent from 14.1 percent.  The next release is scheduled for Tuesday, January 31, at
10:00 AM ET.  SOURCE: The Conference Board             http://www.conference -
