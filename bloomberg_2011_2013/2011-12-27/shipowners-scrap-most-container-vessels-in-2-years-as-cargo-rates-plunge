Shipowners scrapped the most
container vessels in two years this month as they seek to revive
cargo rates amid an oversupply of ships and higher fuel costs.  Vessels equivalent to 21,000 20-foot containers were
scrapped, the most since November 2009, according to  Alphaliner .
The dismantled ships were mostly panamax-sized ones and included
those that were as old as 19 years, the Paris-based maritime
data provider said in a weekly newsletter.  “Poor earnings prospects for such panamax ships will
likely drive further demolition sales in 2012,” Alphaliner said.
Panamax vessels are those that can travel through the  Panama
Canal .  Neptune Orient Lines Ltd.  and  China Cosco Holdings Co. (1919)  are
among shipping companies that posted losses this year as they
contend with lower cargo rates and fuel costs that jumped as
much as 43 percent. Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering Co.,
the world’s second-largest shipbuilder, expects its new orders
to drop 23 percent next year, it said Dec. 25.  A total of 219 ships with a capacity of 546,000 boxes were
idle as of Dec. 19, an increase from 526,000 two weeks ago,
according to Alphaliner.  To contact the reporter on this story:
