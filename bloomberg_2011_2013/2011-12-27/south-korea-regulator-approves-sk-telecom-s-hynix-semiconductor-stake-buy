SK Telecom Co. (017670)  won the antitrust
regulator’s approval to acquire a 21 percent stake in Hynix
Semiconductor Inc., bringing South Korea’s biggest mobile-phone
carrier one step closer to completing the transaction.  The Fair Trade Commission approved the purchase, according
to an e-mailed statement from the regulator today.  Seoul-based SK Telecom last month agreed to pay 3.4
trillion won ($3 billion) to buy the shares that brings the
mobile-phone operator into the $39 billion annual market for
computer-memory chips, dominated by Suwon, South Korea-based
 Samsung Electronics Co. (005930)  The sale, when completed, would end a
two-year effort by Hynix shareholders to dispose of the stakes
they gained through a 2001 government-led bailout.  SK Telecom fell 1.3 percent to 152,000 won as of 11:49 a.m.
in  Seoul , extending their loss this year to 12 percent. Hynix
declined 0.7 percent to 21,450 won.  To contact the reporter on this story:
