The U.S. Defense Department today
said reported cases of sexual assaults at the three major
military academies rose 58 percent for academic year 2010-2011
compared with the previous year.  There were 65 assaults reported in the most recent full
academic year compared with 41 for 2009-2010, the Pentagon said
in its Annual Report on Sexual Harassment and Violence at the
Military Service Academies. The Pentagon said it could not
“conclusively identify the reasons for this increase in
reporting behavior.”  Reports from the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis,  Maryland 
doubled to 22 and incidents at the U.S. Air Force Academy,
 Colorado  Springs, Colorado, increased 65 percent to 33, the
report sent to Congress said. Reported incidents at the U.S.
Military Academy at  West Point ,  New York , remained unchanged at
10 for the year.  “One sexual assault is one too many,” Defense Secretary
Leon Panetta said in a statement. “Whether it’s in our
academies or our ranks, at sea or ashore, there’s no place for
this unacceptable behavior.”  The Defense Department has two new policies to support
victims of sexual assault, according to a press release
accompanying the annual figures. Those who report incidents have
the option to request an expedited transfer from their unit; and
records of such assaults will be retained for as long as 50
years in some cases so victims may have access to them.  The annual report was mandated by Congress in 2007 after
reported cases of sexual assaults at the military training
schools in the 1990s and early part of this decade.  To contact the reporter on this story:
