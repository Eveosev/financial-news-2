Ethanol futures extended their
longest winning streak in more than four months on speculation
production costs are poised to rise.  Futures increased amid concern that corn crops in  South
America  will be damaged by heat and dry weather, leading to
increased demand for U.S. supplies. The grain is the primary
ingredient in U.S. ethanol production.  Both ethanol and corn futures have gained for seven days.
One bushel of the grain makes at least 2.75 gallons of ethanol.
About 5 billion bushels will go to ethanol production in 2012,
down 0.4 percent from the year before, the U.S. Agriculture
Department said in the World Agricultural Supply and Demand
report issued Dec. 9.  Denatured ethanol for January delivery added 3.8 cents, or
1.7 percent, to settle at $2.223 a gallon on the Chicago Board
of Trade, capping the longest streak of increases since Aug. 17.
Futures have fallen 6.5 percent this year, headed for the first
yearly decline since 2008.  Corn futures for March delivery climbed 13.75 cents, or 2.2
percent, to $6.3325 a bushel on the CBOT.  To contact the reporter on this story:
