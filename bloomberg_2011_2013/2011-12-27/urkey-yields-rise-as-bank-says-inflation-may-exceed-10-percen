Turkish bond  yields  rose after the
central bank said inflation may exceed 10 percent in December
and the first quarter, twice its target level.  Yields on the two-year benchmark notes increased 10 basis
points, or 0.1 percentage point, to 10.61 percent at 1:54 p.m.
in Istanbul to the highest intraday level in a week, according
to the RBS Istanbul Benchmark Bond Index. The lira was little
changed at 1.8929 per dollar.  Turkey ’s inflation rate may exceed 10 percent in December
and fall back to single digits from May, Governor Erdem Basci
said at a conference in Ankara today. Inflation will approach
the bank’s 5 percent target at the end of 2012, Basci said. This
year’s goal is 5.5 percent.  “The central bank foresees inflation remaining at
seriously high levels in the first four months, bond yields will
move accordingly,” Tufan Comert, a strategist at Garanti
Securities in Istanbul, said in a phone interview. “Lira
weakness may continue in the first quarter due to  Europe ’s debt
crisis.”  While trading is lower than usual because of year-end
holidays, “we can see trends shaping up from the second week of
January,” Comert said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
