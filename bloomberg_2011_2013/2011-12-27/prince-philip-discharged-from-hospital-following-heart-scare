Prince Philip, Queen Elizabeth’s
husband, left hospital this morning four days after being
admitted following a heart scare,  Buckingham Palace  spokesman
Zaki Cooper said.  Philip, 90, was taken to Papworth Hospital near Cambridge
on Friday night after complaining of chest pains. He underwent
treatment for a blocked coronary artery, the Palace said in a
statement on Dec. 24.  “On departure, Prince Philip thanked the staff at  Papworth 
for the excellent care he has received during his stay,”
 Buckingham Palace  said in an e-mailed statement today. “He is
very much looking forward to rejoining his family.”  The Prince, also known as the Duke of Edinburgh, was
rejoining the Queen and other members of the royal family at
Sandringham in Norfolk, the statement said. The Queen, who is
85, will celebrate her 60th year on the British throne in 2012,
when the royal couple is due to tour the U.K.  To contact the reporter on this story:
