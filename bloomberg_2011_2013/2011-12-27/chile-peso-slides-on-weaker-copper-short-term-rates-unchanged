Chile ’s peso weakened as the price
of copper, the country’s biggest export, declined on cooling
company profits in  China .  The peso depreciated 0.3 percent to 521.75 per  U.S. dollar 
as of 12:02 p.m. in Santiago from 519.95 yesterday.  Interest
rates  on term deposits were little changed from yesterday,
according to data from the Santiago exchange. The Bloomberg
JPMorgan Latin American Currency Index fell 0.2 percent.  Copper, which makes up more than half of Chile’s exports
and is a driver of peso valuations, fell 1.5 percent to $3.418 a
pound on the Comex in  New York  after a report suggested the
economy of China, the biggest buyer of the metal, may be
slowing.  “Copper’s down, everything else is flat,” said Ronald Volpi, head of spot currency trading at EuroAmerica Corredores
de Bolsa SA. “There’s little volume and little liquidity.”  Offshore investors in the Chilean peso forwards market
increased their bets against the currency to $6 billion on Dec.
23, the highest since Nov. 25.  The average monthly rate to borrow for 30 days or less was
0.5 percent, unchanged from a day earlier. The average monthly
rate paid to borrow for between 31 and 60 days rose to 0.53
percent from 0.52 percent, according to the stock exchange.  The average annualized interest rate paid to borrow pesos
for between 30 and 89 days fell 36 basis points, or 0.36
percentage point, on Dec. 23 to 6.60 percent from 6.96 percent
on Dec. 22, according to central bank data. The rate to borrow
for between 90 and 365 days fell 12 basis points to 6.36
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
