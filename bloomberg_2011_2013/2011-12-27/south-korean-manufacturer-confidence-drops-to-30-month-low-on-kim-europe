South Korean manufacturers’
confidence fell to a 30-month low as Europe’s sovereign-debt
crisis and North Korean leader  Kim Jong Il ’s death clouded the
country’s business outlook.  An  index  measuring expectations for January dropped to 79
from 83 for December, the Bank of Korea said in a statement in
Seoul today. That’s the lowest level since July 2009. A measure
of expectations at  non-manufacturing companies  also fell to 79
from 82.  The survey, conducted from Dec. 14 to Dec. 21, was based on
responses from 1,618 manufacturers and 890 non-manufacturers.
 North Korea  announced the death of its leader on Dec. 19, with
his son Kim Jong Un, thought to be under 30, to succeed as ruler.  South Korea’s consumer confidence fell to a three-month low
in December, a central bank report showed yesterday. Concern the
political outlook in the North will worsen is adding to economic
risks in  Asia , where exports face declining demand due to
Europe’s protracted crisis.  To contact the reporter on this story:
