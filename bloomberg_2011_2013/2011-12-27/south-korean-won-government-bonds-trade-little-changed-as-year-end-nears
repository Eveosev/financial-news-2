South Korea’s won weakened for a
second day on speculation importers stepped up dollar purchases
to settle bills.  Government bonds  were steady.  The currency extended this year’s losses to 2.8 percent,
headed for the first annual decline since 2008, as a central
bank survey showed  consumer confidence  in the country fell to a
three-month low of 99 in December from November’s 103. The  Kospi (KOSPI) 
Index of local shares fell 0.8 percent today.  “Currency declines were triggered by importers’ dollar
demand and stock-market losses,” said Yun Se Min, a Seoul-based
currency dealer at Busan Bank. “Trading volume is very low,
making prices fluctuate on small orders.”  The won slid 0.3 percent to 1,158.68 per dollar in Seoul,
after gaining as much as 0.3 percent earlier, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The currency touched a one-week low of
1,160.09.  The yield on the 3.5 percent bonds due September 2016 was
unchanged at 3.52 percent, according to Korea Exchange Inc.
prices.  Benchmark  five-year rates slid 56 basis points this
year, set for a second annual decline, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
