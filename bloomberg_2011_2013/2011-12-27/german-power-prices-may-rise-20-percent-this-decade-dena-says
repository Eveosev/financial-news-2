Electricity prices paid by German
households may rise 20 percent by 2020 as  Chancellor Angela Merkel  pushes to overhaul the country’s energy mix, according to
state-owned researcher Dena Energy Agency.  “Costs for generating power will rise further if
renewable, efficient fossil-fuel plants and power grids and
storage facilities are expanded massively,” as  Germany  exits
nuclear energy generation, Stephan Kohler, the head of Dena,
said in an e-mailed statement today.  Kohler urged the government, companies and consumers to
offset price increases by consuming less power.  Germany,  Europe ’s biggest economy, plans to close all its
nuclear power stations by 2022. Atomic energy accounted for 17.4
percent of the power mix in 2011, down from 22.4 percent last
year, according to the BDEW utility association.  To contact the reporter on this story:
