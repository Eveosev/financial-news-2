U.S. stocks were little changed,
with the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index poised for the biggest
fourth-quarter rally since 1999, while oil gained as higher-
than-estimated consumer confidence helped offset concern about a
drop in American  home prices . Copper and gold declined.  The  S&P 500 (SPX)  rose less than 0.1 percent to 1,265.43 at 4
p.m. New York time, and the  Dow Jones Industrial Average  fell
2.65 points to 12,291.35. Both are among the 10 best performers
in 2011 among 91 national indexes tracked by Bloomberg, and the
 S&P 500  has surged 12 percent this quarter. Crude jumped 1.7
percent after Iran threatened to block transportation through
the Straight of Hormuz. Copper lost 1.7 percent, and gold fell
0.7 percent.  The Conference Board’s  measure  of consumer sentiment topped
the median economist projection and climbed to the highest level
in eight months, adding to evidence that the U.S. economy is
improving. The S&P 500 erased its 2011 loss last week after the
fewest Americans since 2008 filed first-time claims for
 unemployment benefits . Data earlier today showed home prices in
20 U.S. cities dropped more than economists predicted.  “Confirmation of gradual improvement of the  U.S. economy 
bodes well for the global market,” Chad Morganlander, a Florham
Park, New Jersey-based money manager at Stifel Nicolaus & Co.,
which oversees more than $107 billion in client assets, said in
a telephone interview. “Still, the persistent fragility within
the global sovereign  debt market  will continue to create
uncertainty among investors.”  Trading volume for S&P 500 companies was 54 percent less
than the 180-day average, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The
 stock index  moved 0.56 percent between its lowest and highest
points of the day, the narrowest range since July.  Italian Auction  Italian 10-year  government bonds  erased losses before an
auction, with  yields  at 7 percent compared with 7.14 percent
earlier in the day. The nation is preparing to auction as much
as 20 billion euros ($26.2 billion) of debt in the next two
days. German debt rose, pushing the rate on two-year notes to
less than 0.2 percent for the first time since Bloomberg began
collecting the data in 1990, after International Monetary Fund
Managing Director  Christine Lagarde  said the world economy is in
danger because of  Europe ’s financial crisis.  In U.S. stock trading,  Sears Holdings Corp. (SHLD)  tumbled 27
percent after the retailer said it will close as many as 120
stores to cut costs amid declining sales. Mead Johnson Nutrition
Co. rose 5.8 percent after the world’s leading seller of
children’s formula said tests showed no bacteria in a batch of
the product used by a baby who died.  Bartels Forecast  The S&P 500 probably will retreat to near its 2011 low, or
about 15 percent, in the first half of next year before rallying
in the second half, Bank of America Corp.’s Mary Ann Bartels
said. The benchmark gauge for U.S. stocks is likely to test the
intraday low of 1,074.77 it reached in October, said Bartels,
the New York-based head of technical and market analysis at the
firm, in an interview today on Bloomberg Television’s “Inside
Track” with Scarlet Fu and Sara Eisen.  Oil increased for a sixth day, the longest stretch in 13
months, as  Iran  threatened to block transportation through the
Strait of Hormuz and consumer confidence beat estimates.  Crude advanced as much as 1.9 percent after Iran’s official
Islamic Republic News Agency cited Vice President Mohammad Reza Rahimi as saying the country would bar shipments through the
strait if sanctions are imposed on its oil exports.  Treasury 10-year note yields dropped from almost the
highest level in two weeks, slipping to 2 percent. America’s
government debt securities were headed for their best annual
return since 2008 on concern Europe’s sovereign-debt turmoil
will slow global economic growth. Yields erased their decrease
briefly today after the report on consumer confidence.  Euro, Franc  The euro traded at almost its lowest level since January
against the dollar as concern lingered that Europe’s debt crisis
will slow regional economic growth. The 17-nation currency
fluctuated before Italy sells bills and bonds tomorrow. The
Swiss franc and the yen also appreciated against the dollar as
U.S.  consumer confidence  beat forecasts.  The euro was little changed at $1.3069. It dropped to
$1.2946 on Dec. 14, the lowest level since Jan. 11. The common
currency weakened 0.1 percent to 101.76 yen. The dollar fell 0.1
percent to 77.87 yen.  To contact the reporters on this story:
