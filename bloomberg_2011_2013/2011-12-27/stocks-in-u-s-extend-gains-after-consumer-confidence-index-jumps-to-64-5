U.S. stocks extended gains as
confidence among consumers rose in December to the highest level
in eight months.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 0.2 percent to
1,268.30 at 10:02 a.m. New York time. The benchmark measure for
American equities climbed 5 percent over the previous four days.
The U.S. stock market was closed yesterday.  The Conference Board’s index increased to 64.5, exceeding
all estimates in a Bloomberg News survey and the highest since
April, from a revised 55.2 reading in November, figures from the
New York-based private research group showed today. The measure
averaged 53.7 during the recession that ended in June 2009.  The  S&P 500  erased its loss for 2011 last week as data on
 consumer confidence  and housing starts added to expectations the
U.S. can weather Europe’s debt woes. The index had fallen as
much as 19 percent from this year’s high in April on concern
Europe was struggling to tame its crisis. The gauge was up 0.6
percent in 2011 through Dec. 23 as utility shares and consumer
companies that sell necessities led the gains.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
