The cost for European banks to
borrow in dollars for a year declined, according to a money
markets indicator.  The one-year cross-currency  basis swap , the rate banks pay
to convert euro interest payments into dollars, was 97 basis
points below the euro interbank offered rate at 12:45 p.m. in
 London , compared with minus 98 basis points yesterday, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  The rate was 106.5 basis points under Euribor on Dec. 14,
the most expensive since December 2008. The cost has increased
from minus 49 basis points at the end of last year.  The three-month basis swap was little changed at 127 basis
points under Euribor. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  A measure of banksâ€™ reluctance to lend to one another in
 Europe  rose. The Euribor-OIS spread, the difference between the
borrowing benchmark and overnight index swaps, was at 99 basis
points from 97 yesterday. It was at 101 basis points on Dec. 1,
the biggest gap since January 2009.  Euribor for three months was set at 1.396 percent, down
from 1.404 percent, according to the European Banking
Federation.  Lenders increased  overnight deposits  at the  European
Central Bank , placing 347 billion euros ($454 billion) with the
Frankfurt-based bank on Dec. 22, the most since June 2010 and up
from 265 billion euros the previous day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
