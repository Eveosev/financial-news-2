Japan  said it would ease some
restrictions on weapons exports to allow its companies to
participate in international defense projects.  “We will participate with countries we already have
cooperative relations with and when the joint project will
contribute to our national security,” the government said in a
statement distributed to reporters today.  The move will allow Japan to defend itself “by
incorporating friendly nations’ technology,” Assistant Chief
Cabinet Secretary Shuichi Sakurai told reporters in Tokyo after
the announcement. Companies such as Mitsubishi Heavy Industries
Ltd., IHI Corp. and  Mitsubishi Electric Corp. (6503) , which will be
involved in Lockheed Martin Corp.’s F-35 Joint Strike Fighter
project, have called for easing the restrictions.  NATO countries and  Australia  could be possible export
destinations for Japanese defense technologies, Sakurai said,
without providing details.  The trade ministry will rule on each export case
individually, Chief Cabinet Secretary Osamu Fujimura said in a
briefing today. Japan awarded Lockheed a contract last week to
supply the F-35, a deal Fujimura said is unrelated to today’s
decision.  Lockheed has about 700  F-35  orders from overseas, and the
U.S. contractor will build 42 of the planes for Japan, according
to Japan’s defense ministry.  Japan has restricted weapons exports since the 1960s and
1970s, citing the nation’s pacifist constitution and the need to
prevent Cold War enemies from obtaining arms.  To contact the reporter on this story:
