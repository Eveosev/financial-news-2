Drew Brees  broke  Dan Marino ’s 27-
year-old National Football League record for most passing yards
in a single season as the  New Orleans  Saints beat the Atlanta
Falcons 45-16.  Brees completed a nine-yard touchdown pass to Darren
Sproles with 2:56 remaining to surpass the former Miami Dolphins
quarterback’s mark of 5,084 set in 1984. Brees received a
standing ovation from the crowd at the Superdome in New Orleans
after topping the milestone and now has 5,087 passing yards with
one regular-season game left.  Brees, 32, who threw for 307 yards and four touchdowns last
night, thanked his teammates, coaches and the entire Saints
organization in a televised speech after the game.  “There may be only one name that goes in the record book,
but it’s all about you guys,” said Brees, who has thrown for
more than 300 yards in 12 of 15 games this season. “I want
everybody to be proud of this because it’s all about you.”  The Saints, who had already locked up a postseason berth,
captured the National Football Conference South division title
and remain in contention for a first-round bye. New Orleans and
the  San Francisco 49ers  have 12-3 records, while the  Green Bay
Packers  have sealed the NFC’s No. 1 seed with a 14-1 mark.  The Saints have won seven straight games and end the
regular season on Jan. 1 against the  Carolina Panthers .  Matt Ryan passed for 373 yards and a touchdown for the
Falcons (9-6), who clinched an NFC wild card playoff berth when
the Packers beat the  Chicago Bears  on Dec. 25. Atlanta had its
two-game winning streak halted last night.  Marino, 50, congratulated Brees on his  Twitter page , saying
Brees’s accomplishment is a “great job by such a special
player.” Marino is a member of the Pro Football Hall of Fame
and his 61,361 career passing yards rank second in NFL history
to  Brett Favre .  Marino threw for more than 300 yards nine times in his
record-setting 1984 season, when he led the Dolphins to the
 Super Bowl  in his second year before they lost to the 49ers.  Brees, who’s in his 11th NFL season and sixth with the
Saints, said he wasn’t playing with records in mind. Brees has
passed for more than 4,300 yards in six straight seasons and in
2008 finished with 5,069 yards, 15 shy of Marino’s mark.  “I was trying not to think about the record or anything,”
said Brees, who led New Orleans to its first Super Bowl victory
after the 2009 season. “There are so many people that are a
part of this. It’s not about me.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
