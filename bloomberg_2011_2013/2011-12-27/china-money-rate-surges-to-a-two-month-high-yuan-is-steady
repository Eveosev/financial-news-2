China ’s money-market rate surged to
the highest level in almost two months on speculation cash
availability will wane as banks seek to boost capital to meet
year-end requirements. The yuan traded near a 17-year high.  The seven-day  repurchase rate  rose for a second day even as
the central bank scrapped a sale of  28-day   repurchase agreements 
that would have drained cash from the system.  “Banks’ cash demand is very high at the end of the year
because of  capital requirements ,” said Zhang Dedong, an analyst
at Bank of Beijing Co. in Beijing.  The seven-day repo, which measures interbank funding
availability, rose 17 basis points to 4.35 percent as of 10:45
a.m. in  Shanghai , according to a weighted average rate compiled
by the National Interbank Funding Center. It touched 5 percent,
the highest level since Oct. 31.  The monetary authority sold 4 billion yuan ($633 million)
of one-year bills at 3.4875 percent, according to a statement on
its website today. The yield was unchanged for a sixth week.
A total of 126 billion yuan of central bank bills and repurchase
contracts will mature in January, compared with 80 billion yuan
this month and 325 billion yuan in November, according to Guo Caomin, a bond analyst at Industrial Bank Co. in Shanghai.  “Because of the small amount of bill redemptions this
month and next, the central bank will probably rely on auctions
to add liquidity,” Bank of Beijing’s Zhang said.  Yields Drop  The one-year swap contract, the fixed cost needed to
receive the floating seven-day repurchase rate, climbed four
basis points to 2.81 percent, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  The yield on the 2.77 percent government bonds due January
2021 dropped one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 2.71
percent, according to the Interbank Funding Center.  The yuan traded at 6.3223 per dollar in Shanghai, little
changed from 6.3198 yesterday, according to the China Foreign
Exchange Trade System. It touched 6.3160 yesterday, the
strongest level since the country unified the official and
market exchange rates at the end of 1993.  The central bank set the currency’s reference rate 0.02
percent higher at 6.3152, the strongest level since a dollar peg
was scrapped in July 2005.  -- Judy Chen . Editors: Ven Ram, Anil Varma  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
