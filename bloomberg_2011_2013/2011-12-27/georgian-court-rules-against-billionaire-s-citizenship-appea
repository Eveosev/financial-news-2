A Georgian court upheld a
presidential ruling that revoked the citizenship of billionaire
Bidzina Ivanishvili, who plans to create an opposition party to
challenge the country’s leader, Mikheil Saakashvili.  Ivanshvili plans to appeal the decision, Eka Beselia, his
lawyer, said by phone today, adding that the court restored his
wife’s citizenship. Manana Manjgaladze, a spokeswoman for
Saakashvili, said the billionaire may be able to reclaim his
citizenship by directly petitioning the president.  Ivanishvili, a Rossiiskiy Kredit Bank  board member , was
stripped of Georgian citizenship in October. He remains a French
citizen after renouncing his Russian passport yesterday to help
his bid in  Georgia , Beselia said.  Forbes magazine in March  estimated Ivanishvili’s wealth  at
$5.5 billion, equal to almost half of Georgia’s $11.6 billion
economy. On Dec. 11, Ivanishvili held the inaugural rally of his
political campaign, called the “Georgian Dream” and aimed at
challenging the current government.  To contact the reporter on this story:
