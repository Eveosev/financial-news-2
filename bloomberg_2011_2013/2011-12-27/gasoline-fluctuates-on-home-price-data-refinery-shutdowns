Gasoline fluctuated as U.S. home
prices fell more than anticipated and refinery shutdowns in the
Northeast reduced capacity.  Futures swung between gains and losses as the S&P/Case-
Shiller  index  of property values in 20 cities dropped 3.4
percent from October 2010. Three Pennsylvania refineries that
account for about half of Northeast capacity are for sale, and
two have already closed.  “The market is really waiting on some direction from
either economic headlines or gasoline demand figures for the
holiday driving season,” said  Andy Lipow , president of Lipow
Oil Associates LLC in Houston.  Gasoline for January delivery slipped 0.17 cent to $2.6855
a gallon at 9:34 a.m. on the  New York Mercantile Exchange .
Prices swung between a high of $2.7025 and a low of $2.6725.  Prices advanced 8 percent last week, the biggest weekly
gain since March.  The median forecast of 27 economists in a Bloomberg News
survey  projected  a 3.2 percent decrease.  “Gasoline seems to have had a bid up because of the
refineries shut in the Northeast,” said  Gene McGillian , an
analyst and broker at Tradition Energy in Stamford,  Connecticut .  January-delivery heating oil gained 0.55 cent to $2.8962 a
gallon.  Regular gasoline  at the pump, averaged nationwide, was
unchanged at $3.231 a gallon yesterday, according to AAA data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
