Most U.S. Gulf oils weakened as the
difference between West Texas Intermediate and Brent narrowed a
seventh consecutive day.  The spread between the two benchmark crude futures for
February delivery decreased to $7.93, the smallest differential
based on settlement prices since Jan. 20.  When Brent decreases versus WTI, it weakens the value of
low-sulfur U.S. grades that compete with West African oil priced
against the European benchmark.  Light Louisiana Sweet ’s premium to WTI dropped 15 cents to
$8.50 a barrel at 4:03 p.m. in  New York , according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Heavy Louisiana Sweet  decreased $1.40 to
$9.10 over the U.S. benchmark.  Thunder Horse’s premium to WTI was unchanged at $6.50. The
premium for Mars Blend slipped 40 cents to $5 a barrel.
 Poseidon ’s premium weakened 35 cents to $4.10 a barrel.  Southern Green Canyon ’s premium increased 5 cents to $4 a
barrel and  West Texas Sour ’s discount widened 5 cents to $1.30
under WTI.  Syncrude ’s premium slipped 20 cents to $2.55 a barrel.
Syncrude is a light, low-sulfur synthetic oil derived from the
 tar sands  in  Alberta .  Western Canada Select ’s discount widened
60 cents to $16.35.  To contact the reporter on this story:
