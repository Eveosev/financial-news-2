Morgan Stanley, the bank whose
shares have declined 44 percent this year, said in a filing
today that 580 of the 1,600 job cuts announced earlier this
month may come from  New York City .  “Rolling layoffs” began Dec. 15, the New York-based firm
said in a submission to the state’s Labor Department. Affected
locations include 1221 Avenue of the Americas, 1 New York Plaza,
1585 Broadway and 750 Seventh Ave., the filing shows.  Chief Executive Officer  James Gorman , 53, is grappling with
 Europe ’s debt crisis and concern that U.S. economic growth will
slow, crimping demand for trading and investment-banking
services. Financial firms have disclosed plans to eliminate more
than 200,000 jobs globally this year.  Reductions will occur globally at all levels of the firm,
Mark Lake, a company spokesman, said on Dec. 15. The 1,600
figure amounts to about 2.6 percent of the 62,648 employees
 Morgan Stanley (MS)  had at the end of September. The decision to
reduce staff came as “we conduct our year-end performance-
management process and evaluate the right size of the franchise
for 2012,” Lake said at the time.  To contact the reporters on this story:
