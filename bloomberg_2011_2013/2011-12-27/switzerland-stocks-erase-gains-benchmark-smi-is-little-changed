Swiss stocks were little changed
before reports that may show  home prices  in 20 U.S. cities fell
at a slower pace and  consumer confidence  climbed in the world’s
largest economy.  Petroplus Holding AG, Europe’s largest independent refiner,
sank 26 percent after saying about $1 billion in uncommitted
loans under its revolving credit facility have been frozen by
its lenders.  The Swiss Market Index, a measure of the largest and most
actively traded companies, lost less than 0.1 percent to
5,889.65 at 9:32 a.m. in Zurich. The gauge has rebounded 23
percent from this year’s low on Aug. 10 as policy makers
intensified efforts to resolve the debt crisis. The wider Swiss
Performance Index rose was little changed today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
