The following is the text of
the Richmond Federal Reserve Bank’s manufacturing sector
activity survey for December.  Manufacturing activity in the central Atlantic region firmed
somewhat after stabilizing in November, according to the
Richmond Fed’s latest survey. The index of overall activity
edged higher as positive readings for shipments and new orders
offset a slight decline in the reading for employment. Modest
improvement was also evident in most other indicators. District
contacts reported that backlogs turned positive and noted that
capacity utilization steadied. Delivery times were virtually
unchanged, while finished goods inventories grew at a slightly
faster rate.  Looking ahead, assessments of business prospects for the next
six months were less optimistic in December. Contacts at more
firms anticipated that shipments, new orders, backlogs, capacity
utilization and  capital expenditures  would grow more slowly
during the next six months.  Survey assessments of current prices revealed that both raw
materials and finished goods prices grew at a slower rate in
December than a month ago. Over the next six months, respondents
expected growth in raw materials prices to rise at about the
same pace as they had anticipated last month, while they
expected price growth in finished goods to grow at a quicker
rate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
