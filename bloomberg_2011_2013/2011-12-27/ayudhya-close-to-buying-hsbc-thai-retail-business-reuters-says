Bank of Ayudhya Pcl (BAY) , the Thai lender
partly owned by  General Electric Co. (GE) , may be chosen to buy  HSBC
Holdings Plc (HSBA) ’s credit card and retail business in Thailand,
Reuters reported, citing people it didn’t identify.  The HSBC unit is worth as much as $1.28 billion and the
acquisition may be completed early next year, Reuters said. The
Thai lender is seeking Bank of Thailand approval for the
purchase, the Bangkok Post reported today, citing a source it
didn’t identify.  Ayudhya “welcomes opportunities to grow its business,”
Philip Tan, head of the bank’s consumer-finance group, said by
phone, declining to comment on the reports. Shares of the bank
rose 0.9 percent to 22.3 baht as of the 12:30 p.m. lunch break
in Bangkok, while the benchmark SET Index fell 0.2 percent.  HSBC Chief Executive Officer  Stuart Gulliver  is reversing
the London-based lender’s expansion over the past two decades,
selling assets and cutting jobs as the European debt crisis saps
profit and global regulators boost capital requirements. The
bank aims to cut as much as $3.5 billion of expenses over the
next two years to tackle wage inflation in faster-growing
economies and prepares for new capital rules, HSBC said in May.  Varanandha Sutthapreeda, vice president of communications
at HSBC in Thailand, declined to comment on the reports when
contacted by Bloomberg News.  To contact the reporters on this story:
