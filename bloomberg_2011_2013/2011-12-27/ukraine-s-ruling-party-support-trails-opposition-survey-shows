Ukrainian President  Viktor Yanukovych ’s party approval fell behind the main opposition
group for the first time in at least 20 months after the
imprisonment of his long-time rival,  Yulia Tymoshenko .  The ruling Party of the Regions had a 13.9 percent support
in December, compared with 16.6 percent three months earlier and
39.1 percent in April 2010, the  Razumkov Center for Economic and
Political Studies , based in the capital Kiev, said today in an
e-mailed statement. Tymoshenko’s party saw its rating rise to
15.8 percent from 13.8 percent. Parliamentary elections are
scheduled for next October.  Tymoshenko, 51, a former prime minister, was sentenced to
seven years in prison in October for her role in signing a 10-
year gas supply and transit agreement with  Russia  as the head of
the government in 2009. She denied any wrongdoing and said
Yanukovych engineered the case to eliminate her from elections
next year.  More than 55 percent of respondents believe Yanukovych and
his associates are resorting to political repression, the
Razumkov Center’s poll found.  The survey of 2,008 voting-age Ukrainians was conducted
Dec. 9-16 and had a margin of error of 2.3 percentage points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
