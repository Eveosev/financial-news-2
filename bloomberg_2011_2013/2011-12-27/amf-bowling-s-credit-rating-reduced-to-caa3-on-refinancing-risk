AMF Bowling Worldwide Inc. (AMBWQ) , the
world’s largest bowling operator, received a two-level downgrade
to Caa3 by Moody’s Investors Service.  Moody’s said the Richmond, Virginia-based company faces
“material refinancing risk,” according to a Dec. 23 report.
The ratings firm maintained a negative outlook on AMF’s $337
million of bank debt.  AMF’s $217 million first-lien term loan due 2013 traded at
84.6 cents on the dollar Dec. 23, down from 89.5 cents on
January 3, according to information provider Markit Group Ltd.  “Moody’s is concerned about the company’s ability to
refinance its  capital structure  in light of its high leverage
and soft revenue trends,” analysts at the New York-based
ratings firm Daniel Marx and Alexandra Parker wrote in the
report. AMF said it’s preparing itself for sale and hired Moelis
& Co., the investment bank founded by Kenneth Moelis, as a
financial adviser, the analysts said.  AMF has leverage, or debt to earnings before interest,
taxes, depreciation and amortization, of 7 times, according to
the report.  The bowling operator has a $40 million first-lien revolving
line of credit due 2012, a first-lien  term loan  due 2013 and an
$80 million second-lien term piece due 2013, according to the
analysts. The revolver is currently undrawn.  AMF operates 302 bowling centers. It filed for
reorganization in July 2001 and emerged with a confirmed Chapter
11 plan in February 2002 by giving unsecured creditors 7.5
percent of the new stock.  To contact the reporter on this story:
