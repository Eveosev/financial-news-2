Serbia may spend as much as 400
million euros ($523 million) on highway construction in 2012 as
it seeks to complete its main north-south route in three years.  The six-lane highway from the northern border with  Hungary 
to Macedonia in the south will be finished by 2015 when some 200
kilometers (125 miles) of the remaining sections are completed,
mostly with support from the  World Bank , the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development and the  European Investment Bank ,
said Mihajlo Misic, director of  Koridori Srbije , the state-run
road development company.  “We expect only a symbolic amount from the state budget,
the bulk of financing will come from the international banks,”
Misic told reporters in Belgrade today. The remaining sections
include a 83.3 kilometer (51.7 miles) link to the eastern
neighbor Bulgaria, which should be completed in 2014, he said.  Serbia has relied on foreign financing for the project as
it seeks to cut budget spending and reduce its  budget deficit  to
4.25 percent of gross domestic product in 2012 from 4.5 percent
this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
