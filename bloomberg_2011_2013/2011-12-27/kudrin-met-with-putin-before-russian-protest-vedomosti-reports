Former Finance Minister  Alexei Kudrin  met with Russian Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin  before
attending a mass protest in Moscow on Dec. 24 over alleged
election fraud, Vedomosti said, citing an  interview  with Kudrin.  Putin, who is seeking to return to the Kremlin next year,
isn’t afraid of the March presidential elections and is ready to
take “all necessary measures to ensure that they are honest,”
Kudrin was cited as saying by Vedomosti.  Speaking at the protest, Kudrin backed opposition calls for
the resignation of Russia’s senior election official and demands
for a repeat of the disputed Dec. 4 parliamentary poll.  To contact the reporter on this story:
