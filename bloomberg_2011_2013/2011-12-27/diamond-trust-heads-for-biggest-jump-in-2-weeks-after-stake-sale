Diamond Trust of Kenya Ltd. (DTKL) , a
Kenyan lender that is also publicly traded in Uganda and
Tanzania, headed for its biggest gain in two weeks after a
“strategic exit” by one of its investors.  The stock climbed 2.3 percent to 90 shillings as of 11:31
a.m. in the capital, Nairobi, its largest jump since Dec. 15.  “There is an investor who has sold a big bloc, it is a
strategic exit which now creates demand for that stock,” George Bodo, an equity strategist at Nairobi-based Apex Africa Capital
Ltd., said by phone today.  The amount of shares traded by the lender was more than
nine times its three-month average after two transactions,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg News.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
