A $450 million settlement by
 American International Group Inc. (AIG)  to resolve claims that it
cheated a workers’ compensation program was granted final
approval by a federal judge.  U.S. District Judge Robert Gettleman in Chicago said the
settlement is “fair, reasonable and adequate,” according to an
order filed Dec. 21. He said the ruling won’t take effect until
he issues a written opinion.  AIG was accused of underreporting the premiums it collected
on workers’ compensation policies to reduce payments to an
industry fund.  The settlement reached in January is less than a third of
what Liberty Mutual Holding Co. requested. Preliminary approval
was granted in July. Safeco Insurance Co. of America and other
insurers sued in April 2009. Liberty Mutual, an intervening
plaintiff, filed objections to approval of the settlement in
October.  “Liberty Mutual is disappointed -- but not surprised --
with the judge’s order approving the settlement,” John Cusolito, a spokesman for the Boston-based insurer, said in an
e-mail. “ Liberty Mutual  will review the judge’s final written
order, and anticipates an appeal.”  AIG fell 37 cents, or 1.5 percent, to $23.83 at 4:15 p.m.
in  New York  Stock Exchange composite trading. The stock has
fallen 51 percent this year.  The case is Safeco Insurance Co. v. American International
Group, 09-cv-02026, U.S. District Court, Northern District of
 Illinois  (Chicago).  To contact the reporter on this story:
