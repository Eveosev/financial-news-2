Wide receiver Braylon Edwards was
released by the  San Francisco 49ers , two weeks before the start
of the National Football League playoffs.  Edwards was cut today, team spokesman Bob Lange said in an
e-mail. The 28-year-old receiver, a Pro Bowl selection in 2007
who was traded to the New York Jets two years later, had 15
catches for 181 yards and no touchdowns in nine games this
season.  Edwards injured a knee on Sept. 18 and didn’t return until
Oct. 30. He also missed games on Dec. 4 and Dec. 19. In a
statement on his website, Edwards said the release was because
of the severity of his injury.  “I was released today by the 49ers due to my injury that
required more time to rehab and hasn’t allowed me to re-sync
with the offense,” he said.  Lange wouldn’t be specific about the reasons for Edwards’
release.  The 49ers are 12-3, tied with the  New Orleans Saints  for
the second-best record in the National Football Conference
behind the 14-1 Green Bay Packers.  San Francisco  would clinch a
first-round bye in the playoffs with a win over the  St. Louis
Rams  on Jan. 1.  Edwards has 341 receptions and 39 receiving touchdowns in
an eight-year career with the 49ers, Jets and Cleveland Browns.  To contact the reporter on this story:
