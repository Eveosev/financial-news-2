Prices of Arabian Light oil, the
major type of crude exported by  Saudi Arabia , are expected to
fall by 12 percent next year as demand declines, according to
 National Commercial Bank , the kingdom’s largest bank by assets.  Arabian Light will average $95 a barrel next year from an
average 2011 price of $107.80, the Jeddah-based lender said in
an e-mailed report today. This year’s price rose 39 percent from
last year, according to the report.  Saudi Arabia’s average oil production may fall to 8.8
million barrels a day next year from 9.2 million as demand from
Europe weakens, the bank said.  Saudi Arabian Oil Co., or Saudi Aramco, produces five types
of crude that range from Arabian Heavy to Arabian Super Light.
Arabian Light makes up about half of the country’s oil output,
according to  Saudi Aramco ’s figures.  To contact the reporter on this story:
