Saudi Arabia’s break-even price to
balance next year’s budget will rise to $71.5 a barrel from
$70.9 this year, according to  National Commercial Bank , the
kingdom’s largest lender by assets.  Saudi Arabia, the world’s largest crude exporter, is
expected to produce 9.2 million barrels a day on average in
2011,  Jarmo Kotilaine , the bank’s chief economist, said today in
response to e-mailed questions. The lender, known as NCB,
forecasts the country’s average oil production to fall to 8.8
million barrels a day in 2012, he said.  The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries signaled
in its meeting in Vienna on Dec. 14 that it’s prepared to allow
Saudi Arabia, the biggest member, to keep pumping crude at near
the highest rate in at least 30 years, while increasing its
combined output limit to 30 million barrels a day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
