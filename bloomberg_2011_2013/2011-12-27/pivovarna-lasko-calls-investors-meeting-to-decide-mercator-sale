Pivovarna Lasko (PILR)  Group d.d., the
biggest single investor in  Mercator Poslovni Sistem (MELR)  d.d., said
it will call a meeting of shareholders to decide on the sale of
a majority stake in the Slovenian retailer after the company
received a takeover offer from Mercator.  The supervisors said they approve with the sale of its 23
percent Mercator holding and will propose to its investors to
back the move, the Lasko, Slovenia-based company said in a
statement to the Ljubljana stock exchange today.  The sale of a 52 percent stake in Mercator was put on hold
after Nova Ljubljanska Banka d.d, the second-largest investor in
the Slovenian company, delayed a decision on the sale and Bozo
Jasovic, the chief executive officer of Slovenia’s biggest bank,
stepped down because of pressures to stop the sale to Croatia’s
Agrokor d.d.  To contact the reporter on this story:
