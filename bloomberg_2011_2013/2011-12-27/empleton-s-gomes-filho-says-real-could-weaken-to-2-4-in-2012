Carlos Thadeu de Freitas Gomes Filho, a senior economist at Franklin Templeton Investment,
talks about the potential effects of a worsening European debt
crisis on  Brazil ’s economy in 2012, including a possible 22
percent drop in the real from today’s level of 1.86 per dollar.
He spoke in a telephone interview from Rio de Janeiro.  On the possibility of a worsening European debt crisis:  “In this scenario, the real may weaken to between 2 and
2.4 per dollar while  interest rates  could fall to as much as 8
percent and inflation to as low as 4 percent.”  On the potential impact on Brazil should commodity prices fall
and reduce inflationary pressures, allowing for further interest
rate cuts:  “The external scenario impact should be deflationary.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
