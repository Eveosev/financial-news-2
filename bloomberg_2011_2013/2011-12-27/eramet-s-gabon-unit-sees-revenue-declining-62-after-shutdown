Eramet SA (ERA) ’s Gabonese unit, Comilog,
expects to post a 62 percent decline in revenue this year after
it halted operations for maintenance.  Sales are estimated at 468 billion  CFA francs  ($932
million) compared with 1.22 trillion francs a year earlier,
Michel Ravino, mining project manager at Comilog, said today in
a phone interview from the capital Libreville.  Comilog, based in the southeastern Gabonese city of Moanda,
is 67 percent owned by Eramet, the operator of the world’s
biggest ferronickel plant. Gabon’s government owns 25 percent of
Comilog.  To contact the reporter on this story:
