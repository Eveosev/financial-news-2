New York Times Co. (NYT) , struggling with
a drop in advertising sales, agreed to sell its regional-
newspaper unit to Halifax Media Holdings LLC for $143 million.  The cash deal is expected to be completed within a few
weeks, the New York-based company said today in a statement.
Times Co. said last week it was in talks with Halifax to sell
the 16 publications, including the Press Democrat in  Santa Rosa ,
California, and the Star-News in Wilmington,  North Carolina .  Times Co. Chief Executive Officer Janet Robinson is
retiring on Dec. 31 after seven years marked by falling
circulations and declining advertising revenue. The company’s
shares have fallen more than 80 percent since the end of 2004 as
management has grappled with ways to reinvigorate profit,
including charging for online content.  The unit’s sale will help Times Co. “continue our
transformation to a digitally focused, multiplatform media
company,” Chairman Arthur Sulzberger Jr. said in the statement.
He will also serve as interim CEO after Robinson steps down.  Halifax Media is based in  Daytona Beach , Florida, and owns
the Daytona Beach News-Journal. The 16 newspapers represent
“not only an important community service, but, in our eyes, a
good investment,” CEO Michael Redding said in the statement.  Times Co. fell 3 cents to $7.76 at the close in  New York .
The shares have dropped 21 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
