Tata Power Company Ltd. (TPWR) ,  India ’s
largest non-state utility, will buy  BP Plc (BP/) ’s stake in a joint
solar venture after the London-based company said it was exiting
the business.  Tata signed an agreement to buy 51 percent of the venture,
taking full control of India’s third-largest cell and panel
maker, according to a statement from the Mumbai-based company
today. Terms of the purchase weren’t disclosed.  “The favorable policy environment in India has led to an
increase in the size of the solar-module and solar-cell market
in India and is a great opportunity for the company to grow and
capture a healthy market share,” Anil Sardana of Tata Power
said in the release.  Tata said it will enter an agreement with BP to ensure
access to certain technology until 2013. BP Solar told its staff
in an internal letter earlier this month that business will wind
down over several months because it has become unprofitable.  To contact the reporter on this story:
