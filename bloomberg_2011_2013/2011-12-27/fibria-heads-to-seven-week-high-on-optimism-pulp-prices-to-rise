Fibria Celulose SA , the world’s
largest pulp producer, increased on speculation prices for the
raw material will rise.  Shares gained 1 percent to 14.44 reais at the close in  Sao
Paulo . The Bovespa added 0.6 percent. Fibria has declined 45
percent this year, compared with the benchmark’s 16 percent
drop.  Producer inventory data show stockpiles have fallen as
Fibria and its rivals plan price increases for January, said
Marcos Assumpcao, an analyst at Itau Corretora de Valores SA.  “Data for pulp producers came out showing a slight
decrease in inventories, so that started to help,” Assumpcao
said in a telephone interview. “Investors are less skeptical on
the name.”  Fibria dropped 1.1 percent yesterday after it said in a
Dec. 23 statement that banks will allow it to exceed debt caps
on 2.5 billion reais ($1.3 billion) of loans without paying a
waiver fee or higher rates. The company didn’t disclose the new
debt-to-earnings limits. The real’s 11 percent decline this year
versus the dollar boosted the cost of Fibria’s foreign
obligations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
