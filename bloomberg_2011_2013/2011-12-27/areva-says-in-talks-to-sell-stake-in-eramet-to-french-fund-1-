Areva SA , the world’s biggest
supplier of nuclear fuel and services, is in exclusive talks to
sell its stake in mining company  Eramet (ERA)  SA to Fonds Strategique
d’Investissement,  France ’s sovereign investment fund.  The Paris-based company, which owns a 26 percent stake in
Eramet, didn’t provide other details in its statement today.
Eramet has a market value of 2.52 billion euros ($3.3 billion).  Areva said on Dec. 13 it will cut jobs, freeze wages and
put several investments on hold in the U.S. and Africa to adapt
to slower growth in demand following the reactor accident in
 Japan  in March. Chief Executive Officer Luc Oursel, who took
over from  Anne Lauvergeon  in June, is streamlining the company,
which has invested about 10 billion euros in the last five years
to prepare for a boom in nuclear demand.  The CEO plans to sell at least 1.2 billion euros of
financial, mining and other assets by the end of 2013 to shore
up Areva’s finances as Standard and Poor’s threatens to cut the
company’s BBB+ credit rating.  Oursel said in October that it was up to the French
government, Areva’s main shareholder, to decide whether and to
whom Areva might sell its stake in Paris-based Eramet. He called
the holding “mainly a financial asset.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
