California-blend gasoline in  Los
Angeles  strengthened to the highest level in more than seven
weeks against futures as companies such as  Valero Energy Corp. (VLO) 
and  Tesoro (TSO)  Corp. planned refinery work next month.  Carbob in Los Angeles  advanced 1.5 cents to a premium of
25.50 cents a gallon versus gasoline futures on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange  at 2:25 p.m. New York time, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s the largest gap since Nov. 4.  San Antonio-based Valero plans to idle a crude unit and a
coker at the 135,000-barrel-a-day  Wilmington , California,
refinery for four weeks beginning next month, according to the
company’s website.  Tesoro, also based in  San Antonio , planned to flare gases
at its Wilmington refinery Dec. 28 through Dec. 30, according to
a regulatory filing. The notification is associated with planned
maintenance on a unit, spokeswoman Tina Barbee said in an e-
mail. She declined to be more specific.  Carbob in San Francisco  gained 1.25 cents to a premium of
22 cents versus futures, also the highest level since Nov. 4.  California-blend diesel, known as CARB diesel, in  Los
Angeles  fell 0.25 cent to a premium of 5 cents against heating
oil futures traded on the Nymex.  Conventional, 87-octane gasoline in  Portland ,  Oregon ,
gained 0.88 cent to a premium of 3.88 cents to futures.  To contact the reporter on this story:
