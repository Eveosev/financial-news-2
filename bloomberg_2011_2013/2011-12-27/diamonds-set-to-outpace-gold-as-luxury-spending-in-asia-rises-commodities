Diamond  prices are poised to rise
for the next four years, outpacing gold, as increased spending
on  luxury goods  in China,  India  and the  Middle East  outpaces
supplies of the precious stone, analysts said.  Average prices for rough, or uncut, diamonds will probably
climb 9 percent to $145 a carat next year, 1.4 percent in 2013
and 4.8 percent in 2014, according to Edward Sterck, an analyst
at BMO Capital Markets. They may gain 2.6 percent in 2015 and
3.2 percent in 2016, he said. Gold will drop for three years
starting 2013, following a 19 percent gain in 2012, according to
the median of seven analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Demand for diamonds may grow at double the pace of supply
through 2020 because of an expanding middle class in China and
India, Bain & Co. said this month in a report that didn’t give
price forecasts. The two countries, and the Middle East, will
account for 40 percent of global diamond consumption by 2015, up
from about 8 percent in 2005, according to  Anglo American Plc (AAL) ,
which controls De Beers, the world’s largest diamond miner.  “We expect emerging nations, first and foremost India and
China, to drive demand for diamonds in the upcoming years, while
consumption among developed nations is likely to moderate,”
said Vladimir Sergievskiy, an analyst at Moscow-based Finam
Investment. “On the supply side, the commissioning of new mines
should be largely offset by depletion of mature ones.”  Supply Shortage  Global demand for diamonds will probably outstrip supply by
7 million carats in 2016, compared with a shortage of 1 million
carats this year, Sergievskiy said. Prices may climb 9.7 percent
next year, 2.7 percent in 2013, 3.3 percent in 2014, 3.2 percent
in 2015 and 3.1 percent in 2016, he said.  Rough diamonds have advanced 24 percent this year,
according to an index compiled by  PolishedPrices.com , helping
OAO Alrosa, the largest diamond miner by output, and Anglo
American post profit gains.  The price of rough diamonds may fall an average 5.1 percent
in 2012 and remain little changed in 2013, said Richard Platt,
managing director of U.K.-based  WWW Diamond Forecasts Ltd. ,
which provides independent valuations. The gem should gain 2.9
percent in 2014 and 2.2 percent in 2015, he said.  Polished diamonds will perform better, reflecting growing
Asian demand for diamond jewelry and “flattish supply,” said
Platt, who expects prices to increase 4.7 percent in 2012, 9.3
percent in 2013, 6.6 percent in 2014 and 4.4 percent in 2015.  Gold Prices  On the gold market, spot prices have gained 12 percent this
year as investors seek a haven from financial-market turmoil
stemming from  Europe ’s debt crisis. Prices fell 0.2 percent to
$1,586.93 an ounce by 12:49 p.m. in  London  today, while February
futures declined for a fifth session, losing 0.5 percent to
$1,587.70 on the Comex in  New York . That streak, the longest for
a most-active contract since the five days through Oct. 28,
2009, compares with an 11th year of gains for spot prices.  “The current gold price doesn’t reflect the underlying
supply and demand fundamentals,”  Rob Henderson , chief economist
at National Australia Bank Ltd., said by phone from Sydney. “It
much more reflects an artificial demand for gold as a hedge and
as a store of value against inflation. That means the market is
prone to a pretty substantial correction sometime in the
future.”  Spending Power  That contrasts with the diamond industry, where prices
“have not been inflated by artificial demand to the same
degree,” Henderson said. “As countries like  China  and India
keep growing and the size of the middle-class population rises,
more people will be able to afford diamonds.”  Global demand for the gems is estimated to grow an average
6.4 percent a year to almost 247 million carats by 2020, while
output is likely to rise an annual 2.8 percent to 175 million
carats, the Bain report said. Output reached 133 million carats
last year. Demand for diamond jewelry will climb to more than
$100 billion by 2015 from $73.6 billion in 2010, Platt said.  While consumption of polished diamonds is expected to grow
in the “low single digits” in the U.S. for the next decade, it
may increase by as much as 15 percent in China and India, said
Laxmi Deepak, an analyst at Mape Securities Pvt. in Mumbai.  China overtook  Japan  to become the biggest buyer behind the
U.S., where demand rose 7 percent last year, compared with 25
percent in the communist nation, according to  De Beers .  ‘Buoyant’ Demand  “You can see in the Asian market, just walking around  Hong
Kong , demand for luxury goods is clearly very buoyant,” Rob Edwards, chief metals analyst at Renaissance Capital Ltd., said
in an interview in Hong Kong.  Prices of top-quality diamonds climbed 23 percent this
year, the biggest advance since at least 2006, according to the
 Rapaport Diamond Trade Index . The index calculates the average
price for the top 25 best-quality 1-carat diamonds. It rose 14
percent last year and fell 0.5 percent in 2009.  The industry’s positive outlook may attract buyers to  BHP
Billiton Ltd. (BHP) ’s Ekati mine in  Canada , which the world’s largest
mining company said may be offered for sale. The Melbourne-based
company agreed to sell its 51 percent ownership in the Chidliak
diamond project in Nunavut, Canada, to  Peregrine Diamonds Ltd. (PGD) ,
the companies said Dec. 20.  “There are lots of companies that would love to have BHP’s
diamond assets,” RenCap’s Edwards said. “Some mid-cap, junior
would probably pick that up.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
