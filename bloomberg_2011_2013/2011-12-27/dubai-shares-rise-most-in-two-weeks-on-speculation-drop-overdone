Dubai’s shares rose, with its
benchmark stock index headed for its largest gain in two weeks,
on bets a drop this month is overdone.  Emaar Properties PJSC, (EMAAR)  builder of the world’s tallest
skyscraper, gained as much as 2 percent.  Arabtec Holding Co. (ARTC) ,
the United Arab Emirates’ biggest construction company, snapped
a five-day losing streak. Dubai’s  DFM General Index (DFMGI)  edged up 0.5
percent to 1,336.70 at 11:33 a.m. in the emirate. The measure is
down 3.2 percent this month.  “These are regular market consolidation moves which come
after every sharp sell-off,” said Vipin Karnani, a financial
analyst at Al Fahim Group in Abu Dhabi. “Most of the stocks
have reached their support zones and thus are getting some
bids.”  The decline in Dubai’s benchmark this month left the 31
companies in Dubai’s benchmark measure valued at an average 9.51
times estimated earnings, compared with 10.1 times for the 820-
company  MSCI Emerging Markets Index (MXEF)  and 12.6 times for the  Dow
Jones Industrial Average. (INDU)   Emaar rose to 2.51 dirhams while Arabtec gained 2 percent,
the largest intraday gain since Dec. 21, to 1.56 dirhams.  Qatar’s  QE Index (DSM)  gained 0.1 percent and Kuwait’s  gauge (KWSEIDX) 
climbed less than 0.1 percent. The  Bloomberg GCC 200 Index (BGCC200) 
weakened less than 0.1 percent. Oman’s  MSM30 Index (MSM30)  decreased 0.2
percent and Abu Dhabi’s  ADX General Index (ADSMI)  dropped 0.2 percent
while Bahrain’s fell less than 0.1 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
