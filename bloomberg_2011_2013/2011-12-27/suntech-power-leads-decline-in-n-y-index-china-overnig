Chinese equities  listed in the U.S.
retreated from a one-week high, led by a drop in solar stocks,
after a government report showed industrial companies’ profit
 growth  slowed to the weakest pace in at least 10 months.  The Bloomberg China-US 55 Index (CH55BN)  slumped 0.3 percent to
95.48 as trading closed in  New York .  Trina Solar Ltd. (TSL)  and
Suntech Power Holdings Co., the world’s largest maker of
silicon-based solar panels, sank the most on the gauge on
speculation increasing competition will further erode profits.
Online-game operators  Shanda Games Ltd. (GAME)  and  Changyou.com Ltd. (CYOU) 
lost more than 3 percent, the most among Internet companies.  Net income at industrial companies increased 24.4 percent
in the first 11 months of 2011 from a year earlier, China’s
National Bureau of Statistics  said  on its website yesterday.
That’s down from 25.3 percent gain in the first 10 months and 27
percent in the first three quarters. Profits for state-owned
enterprises last month declined 14.2 percent from a year ago.  Profit at most Chinese companies “will probably continue
to be slow until they make some policy adjustments to help boost
growth again,” said Jeff Papp, a Lisle, Illinois-based analyst
at Oberweis Asset Management Inc. “Investors should find
certain areas that the government is targeting to spend money
on.”  Forty-one companies in the Bloomberg measure of the most-
traded Chinese shares in the U.S. declined while thirteen rose
after  the Shanghai Composite Index  sank 1.1 percent to 2,166.21,
the lowest since March 2009. The Standard & Poor’s 500  Index (SPX)  was
little changed at 1,265.43.  Growth Slows  China, the world’s second-largest economy, expanded 9.1
percent in the third quarter from a year earlier, down from 9.5
percent in the second. Consumer prices rose 4.2 percent in
November from a year ago, the slowest pace in 14 months. The
Chinese central bank cut the amount of cash lenders must set
aside as reserves this month for the first time since 2008.  Suntech Power dropped 6.1 percent to a one-week low of
$2.17 in New York trading. Trina, the fifth-largest supplier of
solar panels in China, also slid 6.1 percent, the most since
Dec. 14, to $7.04.  Prices for solar cells have skidded 62 percent this year as
Chinese companies led by Suntech boosted production and won
market share from European and Japanese rivals.  Foxconn Technology Group, the world’s biggest contract
manufacturer of electronics including Apple Inc.’s iPhone,
started work on a solar-module plant in  China ’s eastern province
of Jiangsu near the headquarters of Suntech, according to a Dec.
22  statement  of Funing county, where the plant is located. Trial
production will begin in May, the company said in a statement.  New Solar Plant  Foxconn plans to build new factories with “undreamed-of
scale and lower cost,” Jenny Chase, who leads a team of six
solar analysts at Bloomberg New Energy Finance, said Dec. 23.
“It will push capacity higher and prices lower.”  India  may initiate an anti-dumping probe in a month focused
on imports of Chinese solar products, China’s Commerce Ministry
said in a statement Dec. 19, amid escalating U.S.-China trade
fight over solar energy.  The ishares FTSE China 25 Index Fund, the biggest Chinese
exchange-traded fund in the U.S., dropped 0.4 percent to $35.18.
The Chinese  yuan  was little changed at 6.3226 per dollar,
according to the China Foreign Exchange Trade System. It has
appreciated 4.5 percent against the dollar this year, the most
among the 25 emerging-market currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  China Unicom (CHU)  ( Hong Kong ) Ltd., the nation’s second-largest
wireless network carrier, lost 0.8 percent to $21.25. China
Telecom Corp., the smallest one of the three mobile-phone
operators, fell 0.7 percent to $57.85.  PetroChina, Sinopec  Oil producers declined even as crude oil futures rose in
New York.  PetroChina Co. (PTR) , the largest oil producer in the
country, declined 0.2 percent to $121.43.  China Petroleum and
Chemical Corp ., known as Sinopec, retreated 0.6 percent, the
most in a week, to $106.13.  Crude oil for February delivery rose 1.7 percent to $101.34
a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , the highest
settlement since Nov. 16.  The Shanghai benchmark stock measure is trading at an
estimated  price-earnings ratio  of 10.4 times. That compares with
13.8 for Indian stocks, 10.3 for Brazilian shares and 4.6 for
Russian equities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
