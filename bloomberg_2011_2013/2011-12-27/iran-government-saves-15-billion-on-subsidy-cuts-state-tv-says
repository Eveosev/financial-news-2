Iran’s subsidy reforms have saved
the government $15 billion since December 2010, state TV
reported, citing Deputy Economy Minister Mohammad-Reza Farzin.  The most significant savings were in the  energy industry ,
Farzin told state television in an  interview  aired late
yesterday. Iran began phasing out three-decade-old subsidies
system last year under a five-year plan and replacing it with
cash payments. About 74 million Iranians receive monthly cash
payments, he said.  “The Iranian government plans to eliminate cash payments
for the wealthiest 10 percent of the nation,” Farzin said.
President  Mahmoud Ahmadinejad  said last week his government will
contact “wealthy” Iranians about halting the monthly cash
payments, according to a report by the state-run Fars news
agency.  To contact the reporter on this story:
