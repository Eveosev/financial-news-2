Indian stocks dropped the most in a
week, tracking Asian equities, amid concern a global economic
slowdown and a weak rupee will erode profits at local companies.  Tata Motors Ltd. (TTMT) , the country’s biggest truckmaker and
owner of Jaguar Land Rover, dropped for the first time in five
days.  DLF Ltd. (DLFU) , the largest developer, slid 2.8 percent.  State
Bank of India (SBIN)  paced declines among lenders.  The BSE India  Sensitive Index (SENSEX) , or Sensex, fell 87.91, or
0.6 percent, to 15,882.84, according to preliminary closing
prices at 3:30 p.m. in Mumbai. The gauge is headed for its
second-worst annual loss in more than three decades amid concern
the seven interest-rate increases by the nation’s central bank
this year and the rupee’s decline to a record will exacerbate
the effects of Europe’s crisis on corporate earnings.  “We have to see how the future unfolds, if inflation will
be killed, whether  interest rates  will go down and how the U.S.
recovery and the European crisis plays out,” Raamdeo Agrawal,
joint managing director at Mumbai-based  Motilal Oswal Financial
Services Ltd. (MOFS) , told Bloomberg UTV.  The S&P CNX  Nifty (NIFTY)  Index on the National Stock Exchange of
India Ltd. lost 0.6 percent to 4,750.50. The  BSE 200 Index (BSE200)  fell
0.6 percent.  The Indian rupee is Asia’s worst performer this year. It
fell to a record 54.305 a dollar on Dec. 15.  Most Asian stocks fell amid slow holiday trading, with the
regional benchmark headed for its worst year since 2008, as the
Bank of Japan warned of downside risks to the economy and South
Korean consumer confidence slid.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index dropped 0.2 percent to 113.61.
The measure is headed for a 17 percent decline this year, its
biggest annual loss since 2008. Markets in Australia, New
Zealand and  Hong Kong  are closed today.  In India, combined turnover on the National Stock Exchange
and the BSE Ltd. yesterday totaled $1.2 billion, compared with a
one-year average of $3.1 billion.  Overseas  investors  bought a net  2.72 billion rupees  ($52
million) of local  stocks (MXAP) , their first net purchase since Dec. 8.  To contact the reporter on this story:
