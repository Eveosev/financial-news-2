The ruble weakened for the first
time in six trading days, falling from its strongest level
against the dollar in more than three weeks.  The Russian currency depreciated 0.8 percent to 31.38 by
the end of trading at 7 p.m. in Moscow, its first decline
against the U.S. currency since Dec. 19, after closing at its
strongest level since Dec. 5 yesterday. The ruble retreated 0.8
percent to 40.9825 versus the euro. That put it at 35.7011
against the central bank’s target dollar-euro basket.  Oil futures were little changed after a report showed
American  home prices  dropped more than estimated after closing
at $99.68 a barrel on Dec. 23, their highest level since Dec.
13.  Investors increased bets the Russian currency will weaken
further, with non-deliverable forwards showing the ruble at
31.6714 per dollar in three months, compared with expectations
of 31.5815 per dollar yesterday. The contracts are a guide to
expectations of currency movements as they allow investors and
companies to fix the  exchange rate  at a particular level in the
future.  Russia’s dollar-denominated Eurobond due in 2020 fell,
pushing the yield two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point,
higher to 4.616 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
