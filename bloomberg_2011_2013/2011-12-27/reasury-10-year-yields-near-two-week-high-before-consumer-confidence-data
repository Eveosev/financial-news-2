Treasuries advanced, pushing 10-year
note  yields  down from almost the highest in two weeks, as
concern  Europe ’s sovereign-debt turmoil will slow global
economic growth buoyed demand for the safest assets.  America’s government-debt securities were headed for their
best annual return since 2008 as  Italy  prepared to sell as much
as 20 billion euros ($26 billion) of debt in the next two days.
Yields erased their decrease briefly today after a report showed
U.S. consumer confidence rose to an eight-month high.  “No one is taking any big bets given the uncertainties
that remain, so we have settled around these levels,” said
Donald Ellenberger, who oversees about $10 billion as co-head of
government and mortgage-backed securities at Federated Investors
in Pittsburgh. “Markets are very illiquid.”  Yields on 10-year Treasury notes dropped two basis points,
or 0.02 percentage point, to 2 percent at 5 p.m.  New York  time,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The 2 percent
securities maturing in November 2021 increased 5/32, or $1.56
per $1,000 face amount, to 99 30/32.  The benchmark yields have fallen 127 basis points in 2011,
which would be the biggest slide in three years. They advanced
18 basis points last week in the largest five-day  increase  since
July 1 as reports indicated U.S. economic recovery. The yields
touched 2.04 percent on Dec. 23, the highest since Dec. 13.  Treasury market  volume  slid today as the year-end U.S.
holiday approached. About $58.6 billion of Treasuries changed
hands through ICAP Plc, the world’s largest interdealer broker.
The 2011 daily average is $288 billion.  ‘Choppy and Thin’  “The market will trade rather choppy and thin,” said Paul Horrmann, a broker in New York at Tradition Asiel Securities
Inc., an interdealer broker. “There will be no breakout in
either direction.”  In a sign President  Barack Obama  may have little difficulty
financing a fourth consecutive year of $1 trillion budget
deficits, the U.S. government received record demand for its
bonds in 2011.  The Treasury Department attracted $3.04 for each dollar of
the $2.135 trillion in notes and bonds sold, the most since the
government began releasing the data in 1992 during the George
H.W. Bush administration. The U.S. drew an all-time high  bid-to-
cover  ratio of 9.07 for $30 billion of four-week bills it
auctioned on Dec. 20, even though they pay zero interest.  While  Standard & Poor’s  stripped the U.S. of its AAA credit
rating on Aug. 5, Treasuries due in 10 years or more have
returned 25.6 percent this year, larger than the broader
Treasuries market, which has gained a three-year high of 8.9
percent, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes. The
 S&P 500 Index  has increased 0.8 percent in 2011.  Borrowing Authority  The Obama administration will ask Congress to increase
federal borrowing authority by $1.2 trillion as the nation
approaches the debt limit set by law, according to a Treasury
Department official. The White House will send the request to
Congress on Dec. 30, the day the debt is projected to rise to
within $100 billion of the $15.194 trillion limit, the Treasury
official told reporters today on condition of anonymity.  The Budget Control Act of 2011 gives Congress 15 days to
pass a joint resolution disapproving the increase in the debt
limit. The president can veto such a measure.  Italy is scheduled to sell 9 billion euros ($11.8 billion)
of 179-day bills and as much as 2.5 billion euros of zero-coupon
2013 notes tomorrow. The nation will auction debt due in 2014,
2018, 2021 and 2022 on the following day.  European ‘Touchstone’  “The debt auctions are going to be an interesting
touchstone for the European sovereign-credit crisis,” said  Ian Lyngen , a government-bond strategist at CRT Capital Group LLC in
 Stamford ,  Connecticut . “While we anticipate a reasonable
response, the end of the year and the ongoing credit concerns
will weigh on the process.”  S&P said this month it may lower the credit grades of 15
euro nations including Italy, France and  Germany . The yield on
Italian 10-year bonds increased two basis points to 7 percent
today.  Although Europe has made progress in confronting debt
turmoil, the region needs to speed up implementation of crisis
measures, International Monetary Fund Managing Director
 Christine Lagarde  said in an interview, Le Journal du Dimanche
reported. The U.S. is already being affected, she said.  The Conference Board’s U.S. consumer-confidence  index  rose
this month to 64.5, exceeding all estimates in a Bloomberg News
survey and the highest since April, from a revised 55.2 reading
in November, figures from the New York-based private research
group showed today. The measure averaged 53.7 during the
recession that ended in June 2009.  Investors in a weekly survey by Ried Thunberg ICAP, a unit
of ICAP, remained bearish on Treasuries, the company said.
Ried’s index on the outlook on the market through March was 47
for the seven days ended Dec. 23 versus 49 the week before. A
figure below 50 shows investors expect rates to increase.  To contact the reporter on this story:
