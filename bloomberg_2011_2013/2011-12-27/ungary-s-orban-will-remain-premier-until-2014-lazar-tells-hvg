Hungarian Prime Minister  Viktor Orban  will remain in office until the end of the current
political cycle in 2014 even though “there’s a stir up,” news
website  HVG  said, citing a ruling party politician.  “One thing is for sure: Viktor Orban will remain prime
minister until at least 2014,” Janos Lazar, the leader of the
ruling Fidesz party’s parliamentary group, told HVG in an
interview published yesterday. “There’s now a stir up, although
I can’t tell whether it’s internal politics or generated from
the outside,” Lazar said.  Lazar expects  Fitch Ratings  “to follow its two other
brothers” and cut Hungary’s credit rating to junk, he said.  When asked whether Hungary will be able to finance itself
from the markets, Lazar said “let’s wait to see what happens in
the spring.”  Hungary will “sign a useful agreement,” with the
 International Monetary Fund  and the European Union,’’ Lazar
said, adding that the two institutions will probably criticize a
recently signed agreement with local banks to help foreign-
currency borrowers for the deal’s impact on the budget.  To contact the reporter on this story:
