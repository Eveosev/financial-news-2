Beacon Power Corp. , the maker of
electricity-storage gear that received $43 million in backing
from a program that supported failed solar-panel maker Solyndra
LLC, won a bankruptcy judge’s approval of sale procedures.  Judge Kevin Carey signed an order in Wilmington,  Delaware ,
today setting the deadline for non-binding indications of
interest at Jan. 9; the final bid deadline at Feb 1; an auction
of company assets on Feb. 3; and a sale-approval hearing Feb. 7.  The procedures are “in the best interests” of Beacon,
based in Tyngsboro,  Massachusetts , and its creditors, Carey
wrote in the order.  Beacon filed for court protection Oct. 30 after struggling
to raise private financing. It reported assets of $72 million
and debt of $47 million in its Chapter 11 petition.  The company uses flywheel technology to store energy for
quick use in electrical power grids.  Solyndra , which filed for bankruptcy in September, received
$535 million in federal loan guarantees and couldn’t compete
with government-subsidized foreign manufacturers.  The case is In re Beacon Power Corp., 11-13450,  U.S.
Bankruptcy Court , District of Delaware (Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
