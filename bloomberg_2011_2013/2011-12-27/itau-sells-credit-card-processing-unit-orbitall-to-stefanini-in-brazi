Itau Unibanco Holding SA ,  Latin
America ’s largest bank, agreed to sell its credit-and debit-card
processing unit Orbitall Servicos e Processamento de Informacoes
Comerciais SA to a Brazilian software producer.  Itau agreed to sell its Orbitall subsidiary to Jaguariuna-
based Stefanini Consultoria & Assessoria em Informatica SA for
an undisclosed sum, the Sao Paulo-based bank said in a
regulatory filing. Two people familiar with the transaction who
asked not to be identified because the deal wasn’t announced
told Bloomberg yesterday that the deal had taken place.  “Providing this kind of service to other financial
institutions is not related to the main activity in Itau
Unibanco’s conglomerate and this is what motivated the sale at
this moment,” according to the statement.  Stefanini, which provides information technology and
consulting, invested $100 million over the past 11 months to buy
two companies in the U.S., TechTeam Global Inc. of Southfield,
 Michigan , and CXI, and one in Colombia, Informatica &
Tecnologia, according to its website. The Brazilian company,
which operates in 28 countries and forecasts 2011 revenue of
1.25 billion reais ($673 million), has set aside another $120
million for acquisitions through 2013, 60 percent directed for
purchases outside of  Brazil , the website shows.  Orbitall, located in Sao Paulo, had net revenue of 529.7
million reais in 2009, according to the most recent data
compiled by Bloomberg. Itau increased its ownership in the
company to 100 percent from 33.3 percent after paying 281
million reais in 2004 for stakes held by New York-based
Citigroup Inc. and Uniao de Bancos Brasileiros SA, known as
Unibanco. Itau bought Unibanco in 2009 to become the region’s
largest bank by market value.  Itau ’s preferred shares rose 0.2 percent to 34.31 reais in
 Sao Paulo  today, compared with a 0.6 percent gain for the
benchmark Bovespa Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
