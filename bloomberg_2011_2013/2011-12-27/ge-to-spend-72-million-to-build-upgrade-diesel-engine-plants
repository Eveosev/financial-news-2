General Electric Co. (GE)  plans to spend
$72 million to add a diesel-engine plant and upgrade another in
Grove City, Pennsylvania, meeting demand for locomotives.  GE, the world’s largest maker of diesel locomotives, will
lay out $35 million to build the new plant, according to a
statement today. The factory will begin production by the end of
2012 and create 150 jobs by early 2013, the Fairfield,
Connecticut-based company said. GE is also spending $37 million
this year and next on the upgrade of a 40-year-old facility.  Demand for the remanufacture of engines is being driven by
locomotive overhauls and the need to comply with more-stringent
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency emission standards for
 diesel engines  that take effect in 2013, GE said.  GE’s transportation unit this year announced plans to add
more than 2,400 U.S. jobs and to invest $327 million in plants
in Erie, Pennsylvania, and Fort Worth, Texas. The Grove City
plant has annual production of about 2,000 new and
remanufactured engines, GE said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
