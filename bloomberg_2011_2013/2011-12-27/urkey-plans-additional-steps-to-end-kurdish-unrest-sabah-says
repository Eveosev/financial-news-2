Turkey  is drafting a second set of
proposals following its so-called democratic opening of 2009 to
end Kurdish unrest in the country’s southeast, Sabah  reported ,
without saying how it got the information.  Prime Minister  Recep Tayyip Erdogan  approved an initial
package of measures that include faster prosecution, an end to
long pre-trial imprisonments and the lifting of arrest warrants
on those members of the Kurdistan Workers’ Party, or PKK, who
voluntarily surrender and disarm, according to the Istanbul-
based newspaper. Other proposals include changing legal criteria
for what constitutes terrorism and abolishing certain
limitations on the freedom of speech and press, it said.  Turkey will push ahead with efforts to enable members of
the PKK, classified as a terrorist group by Turkey, the U.S. and
the European Union, to leave the organization, Sabah cited
Deputy Prime Minister Besir Atalay as saying. People should be
allowed to express all ideas as long as they don’t include
violence, Atalay said, adding that Turkey will eliminate harsh
measures that could cause human rights abuses.  In October, three of the 34 PKK members who entered Turkey
from the Habur crossing on the Iraq border on Oct. 19, 2009, as
part of the first wave of the government’s “democratic
opening” were sentenced to 10 years and 10 months each in
prison for committing crimes as part of a terrorist group. The
PKK has been fighting for autonomy in Turkey’s southeast since
1984 in a conflict that has cost about 40,000 lives.  To contact the reporter on this story:
