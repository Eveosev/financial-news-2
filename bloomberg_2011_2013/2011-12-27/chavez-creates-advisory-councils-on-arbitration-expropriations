Venezuelan President  Hugo Chavez 
created councils to advise the government on international
arbitration cases and the expropriation of assets in the South
American country.  Chavez, who has seized assets from 1,045 companies since
coming to power in 1999 according to Venezuelan manufacturing
association Conindustria, will receive a monthly report from the
boards, according to two decrees published today in the Official
Gazette.  The country faces about 18 arbitration cases filed by
foreign companies at the World Bank’s  International Centre for
Settlement of Investment Disputes , including U.S. oil companies
 Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)  and  ConocoPhillips. (COP)  The nationalizations have
cost the government at least $9.9 billion in compensation paid
to companies, while claims for $20 billion are under dispute at
international courts, according to Caracas-based research firm
 Ecoanalitica .  The arbitration council, or Superior Council for the
International Defense of the Sovereignty of Venezuela, will have
seven members including the prosecutor general, vice president,
foreign minister and oil minister, according to the Official
Gazette.  The Superior Strategic Council for Expropriations will
oversee the government’s policy of asset seizures to guarantee
“efficiency” and “legality,” the second decree said. The
council will have 15 members.  To contact the reporter on this story:
