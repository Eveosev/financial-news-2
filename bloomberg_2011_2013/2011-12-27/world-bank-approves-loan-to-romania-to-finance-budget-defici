The  World Bank  approved a 400
million-euro ($523 million) loan to  Romania  to help finance the
country’s budget deficit.  The disbursement follows changes in Romania’s fiscal
management, social protection and financial markets, the bank
said in an e-mailed Dec. 23 statement.  The loan completes a commitment to lend Romania 1 billion
euros as part of a 20 billion-euro international bailout signed
in 2009. The  International Monetary Fund  and the European Union
participated in the bailout that ended in May.  The World Bank will join the IMF and the EU in a new two-
year precautionary agreement with Romania, signed in March, as
the country needs “the bank’s guidance on policies and
reforming the state,” Finance Minister Gheorghe Ialomitianu
said today.  “It’s normal for the World Bank to be part of the accord
with a  credit line  that we can access in case of need,”
Ialomitianu said in an interview in Bucharest today. “The value
of the credit line hasn’t been discussed yet.”  Romania secured a 5 billion-euro accord with the IMF and
the EU, from which it doesn’t plan to draw money, and pledged to
reduce its budget deficit to 1.9 percent of the gross-domestic
product from an anticipated 4.4 percent of GDP this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
