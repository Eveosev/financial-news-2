China , the biggest supplier of rare
earths, will keep 2012 export quotas “basically level” with
this year, as high prices and a slowing global economy sap
demand.  The full-year quota may be about 31,130 metric tons,
according to Bloomberg News calculations based on first-round
quota figures given by the Ministry of Commerce in a  statement .
The quota was 30,184 tons in 2011 and 30,258 tons in 2010.  China produces at least 90 percent of the world’s rare
earths, used in  Boeing Co. (BA)  helicopter blades and Toyota Motor
Corp. hybrid cars. The slowing global economy and high prices
have curtailed demand from  Japan , Europe and U.S., prompting
speculation the country may slash quotas for 2012. China has
curbed output and exports since 2009, when quotas were set at
50,145 tons, to conserve resources and protect the environment.  “The quota has become pointless if export demand falls
short of the limits,” said Wei Chishan, a Shanghai-based
analyst at SMM Information & Technology Co., a data provider.
“Rare-earth users are under great pressure to pass on surging
costs, while the global slowdown has slashed demand.”  China, the world’s fastest growing major economy, exported
only 14,750 tons of rare earths in the first 11 months of this
year, or 49 percent of the full-year limit, “leaving a huge
amount of export quota unutilized,” the ministry said.  “It shows supply is sufficient,” SMM’s Wei said.  Environmental Protection  The government allocated 10,546 tons of first-round export
quotas to nine companies, including  China Minmetals Corp.  and
Sinosteel Crop., that have met the government’s environment
protection standards, the ministry said. Another 14,358 tons may
be granted to 17 other companies, including Baotou Iron & Steel
Group, China’s biggest producer, if they meet the standards by
the end of July, the statement said.  The first-round quotas will account for about 80 percent of
the full-year volume for 2012, the ministry said.  Rare earths are 17 chemically similar elements including
neodymium, cerium and lanthanum. The export prices from China
for eight rare earths found at the Mount Weld project in  Western
Australia  surged to $193.21 a kilogram on average in the third
quarter, compared with $31.35 in 2010, according to figures on
 Lynas Corp.’s website . The prices have since fallen 41 percent
to $113.43 a kilogram on Dec. 19, the company said.  Export Limits  China has set export limits on a range of mining products
including silver, minor metals and coke to conserve resources
and protect the environment. Raw-material restrictions have
stoked tensions between China and its trading partners including
the U.S. and the European Union, which said it has unfair
commerce and currency policies.  Complaints against China by the U.S., the European Union
and  Mexico  were bolstered by a World Trade Organization ruling,
which found in July that quotas, export duties and license
requirements on industrial ingredients such as coke, zinc and
bauxite violate global rules.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
