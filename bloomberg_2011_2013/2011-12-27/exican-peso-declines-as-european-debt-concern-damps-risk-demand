Mexico ’s peso fell to the lowest in
four weeks as concern about  Europe ’s sovereign debt crisis
damped demand for higher-yielding assets from the Latin American
nation.  The peso dropped 1.1 percent to 14.0161 per  U.S. dollar  at
11:24 a.m. in Mexico City, from 13.8632 yesterday. The currency
earlier touched 14.0395, the weakest level since Nov. 29,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Concern about Europe’s debt crisis has fueled a 12 percent
tumble in the peso this year, worst performance among Latin
America’s major currencies. Italy will sell 9 billion euros
($11.8 billion) of 179-day bills and as much as 2.5 billion
euros of zero-coupon 2013 bonds tomorrow. The peso extended
losses as institutional investors bought dollars, overwhelming
supply amid light trading before the year-end holidays,
according to  Ramon Cordova , a currency trader at Base
Internacional Casa de Bolsa in Monterrey, Mexico.  The peso’s decline “has a bit to do with waiting to see
what happens with the auctions in Italy,” Alejandro Padilla, a
strategist at Grupo Financiero Banorte-Ixe, said by phone from
Mexico City. “The market isn’t that convinced that all the
fiscal adjustment measures that were approved last week are
going to help investors maintain exposure to Europe.”  Italian Prime Minister  Mario Monti  secured final passage
for austerity and growth measures last week.  The yield on Mexico’s benchmark peso-denominated bond due
in 2024 rose eight basis points, or 0.08 percentage point, to
6.57 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The price
of the security fell 0.81 centavo to 129.83 centavos per peso.  To contact the reporter on this story:
