Entergy Corp. (ETR)  shut the  Pilgrim 1 
nuclear reactor near Plymouth, Massachusetts, to repair a
“minor leak,” said Rob Williams, a company spokesman.  The 685-megawatt reactor was closed for work on one of the
unit’s four safety relief valves, Williams said.  “The leak was captured inside the plant as designed and
was not a threat to workers or the public,” he said today in an
e-mail from Vermont.  Pilgrim 1 was operating at 100 percent of its capacity
yesterday, according to the  Nuclear Regulatory Commission .  Entergy said in a report to the NRC that a controlled
shutdown was initiated yesterday after a safety valve was
“declared inoperable.”  It’s unclear how long repairs will take after workers
safely gain access to the valves, located in the reactor-
containment building, said  Neil Sheehan , a spokesman for the
NRC. He said the agency has inspectors on site.  To contact the reporter on this story:
