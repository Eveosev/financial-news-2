China’s stocks  fell, driving the
benchmark index to a two-year low, after profit growth for
industrial companies slowed and a jump in interbank borrowing
costs signaled the nation’s cash crunch is worsening.  Anhui Conch Cement Co. (600585)  and SAIC Motor Corp. dropped more
than 2 percent after a report showed industrial firms’ earnings
growth in the first 11 months of the year decelerated.  China
Construction Bank Corp. (939) , the country’s second-largest bank, slid
to a two-month low after interbank borrowing costs surged the
most since June. China Vanke Co. and Poly Real Estate Group Co.
led declines for developers after Soufun Holdings Ltd. said home
transactions plunged last week.  “Tight liquidity and slowing economic growth are key
concerns for investors and that hasn’t changed,” said Wei Wei,
an analyst at West China Securities Co. in  Shanghai . “Stocks
have room for further declines because we don’t see a reversal
of fundamentals.”  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  fell 23.91 point, or 1.1
percent, to 2,166.21 at the close, the lowest close since March
2009. The  CSI 300 Index (SHSZ300)  lost 1.3 percent to 2,305.03. A measure
of small and medium-size companies slid 2.4 percent in Shenzhen.
 Hong Kong ’s market is shut today, while the U.S. was closed
yesterday for the Christmas holiday.  The Shanghai Composite has fallen 7.2 percent in December
as concern about an economic slowdown overshadowed the first cut
in reserve requirement ratios last month. The measure trades at
a record low of 10.4 times estimated earnings, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg dating back to 2006. For the year, the
measure is down 23 percent after the central bank raised
 interest rates  three times to cool inflation and exports to
 Europe  slowed because of the region’s debt crisis.  Slowing Profit  Shares worth 36.6 billion yuan ($5.78 billion) traded on
the  Shanghai Stock Exchange  yesterday, the lowest since Dec. 31,
2008, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The daily average
turnover is 22 percent lower this year than in 2010, Bloomberg
data showed.  Anhui Conch, China’s biggest cement maker, dropped 2.4
percent to 15.11 yuan. SAIC, China’s largest carmaker, slumped
4.1 percent to 13.44 yuan.  Sany Heavy Industry Co. (600031) , the biggest
Chinese machinery maker, fell 1.9 percent to 11.94 yuan.  Net income for Chinese industrial companies increased 24.4
percent in the first 11 months of 2011 from a year earlier to
4.66 trillion yuan ($737 billion), the National Bureau of
Statistics said on its website today. The pace compared with
25.3 percent gain in the first 10 months and a 27 percent rise
in the first three quarters.  Shibor Rate  Construction Bank lost 0.9 percent to 4.50 yuan. China
Citic Bank Corp., the banking unit of the nation’s largest
investment company, fell 1 percent to 3.97 yuan.  Huaxia Bank
Co. (600015) , partly owned by Deutsche Bank AG, retreated 0.7 percent to
11.10 yuan.  The Shanghai interbank offered  rate , a gauge of the cash
banks have on hand to lend to each other, has surged 105 basis
points this month to 5.85 percent, the biggest monthly gain
since June.  The jump in one-month interbank borrowing costs is adding
to speculation the People’s Bank of  China  will cut  reserve
requirements  to support economic growth.  “It’s possible the PBOC will cut the reserve ratio again
before the Chinese New Year,” a week-long holiday that starts
Jan. 23, said Lily Wei, a fixed-income manager in Beijing at
Harvest Fund Management Ltd., which manages about $1.7 billion.
“Demand for loans usually shoots up at the beginning of the
year. Given GDP and other indicators signal slowing, if the PBOC
really wants to boost growth, it’ll lower the reserve ratio.”  House Transactions  The central bank lowered the amount of cash commercial
lenders must set aside as reserves on Nov. 30, the first cut in
three years.  Vanke, the nation’s biggest listed property developer, fell
2.1 percent to 7.37 yuan. Poly Real Estate Group Co., the second
largest, lost 3.2 percent to 9.76 yuan.  China Merchants Property
Development Co. (000024)  retreated 2.3 percent to 17.80 yuan.  Housing transactions declined in 29 out of 35 cities
tracked by Soufun during Dec. 19-25, according to an e-mailed
report by Soufun, the country’s biggest real estate website
owner.  China will set a growth target of about 11 percent for
industrial output in 2012, the same goal as this year, the
Ministry of Industry and  Information Technology  said yesterday.
Industrial production will probably grow 13.9 percent this year,
China National Radio reported separately yesterday, citing
comments by Minister Miao Wei at a conference.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
