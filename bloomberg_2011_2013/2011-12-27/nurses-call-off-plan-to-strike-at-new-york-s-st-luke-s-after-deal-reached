The New York State Nurses
Association has called off plans to strike at  St. Luke’s-
Roosevelt Hospital Center  in  New York City  after reaching a
tentative agreement on benefits with hospital management, the
association said.  The agreement “addresses the nurses’ principal concerns
throughout the negotiations -- affordable health care, relief
for members with high prescription costs, safe staffing levels
for patients and nurses, and fair wages,” the association said
today in a  statement .  The organization represents the 1,300 registered nurses at
the  Manhattan  hospital. Similar bargaining sessions are taking
place today at Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan and  Montefiore
Medical Center  in the Bronx, where the nurses hadn’t issued a
10-day strike notice as they had at St. Luke’s-Roosevelt, said
Bernie Mulligan, a spokesman for the association. The group’s
3,000 members at New York-Presbyterian Hospital reached a deal
with management earlier this month, he said.  “Our members live and work in one of the most expensive
regions in the world,” Mulligan said in a telephone interview
today. “Affordable health care is a concern.”  The nurses will vote on the proposed four-year contract at
St. Luke’s-Roosevelt on Jan. 4, the association said. Hospital
spokesmen didn’t immediately return a telephone call seeking
comment. The strike had been planned for Jan. 3.  About 6,000 nurses in  California  took part in a one-day
strike last week against proposed benefit cuts at hospitals in
the San Francisco Bay area and  Long Beach .  To contact the reporter on this story:
