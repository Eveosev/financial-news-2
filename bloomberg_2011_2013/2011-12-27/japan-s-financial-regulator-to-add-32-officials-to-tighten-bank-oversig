Japan ’s  Financial Services Agency 
said it will hire 32 officials to help tighten oversight of
illegal trading at securities firms and other regulations as it
boosts its headcount and budget for next year.  The regulator plans to increase its net headcount to 1,548
people in 2012, the most in at least in five years, as its
budget grows by 4.1 percent to 23.1 billion yen ($296 million),
the agency said in an e-mailed statement.  The FSA penalized at least 35 financial institutions this
year, including  Citigroup Inc. (C)  and  UBS AG (UBSN) , for breaching
Japanese securities rules, according to its website. The
additional staff will help the FSA improve oversight and
participate in global regulatory changes as the debt crisis in
 Europe  widens, the agency said.  The regulator told Citibank Japan Ltd. earlier this month
to stop soliciting sales of products including mutual funds and
foreign-exchange deposits to retail customers for a month, after
it failed to fully explain their risks. Darren Buckley, who
heads the Japan unit, will step down in January.  Citigroup’s and UBS’s local securities units were also
ordered to suspend some derivatives transactions after staff of
the firms attempted to influence interbank lending rates,
according to the regulator.  Japan’s FSA currently employs 1,537 inspectors, analysts
and accounting and legal staff. The 32 new officials will join
the regulator as 21 leave the agency, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
