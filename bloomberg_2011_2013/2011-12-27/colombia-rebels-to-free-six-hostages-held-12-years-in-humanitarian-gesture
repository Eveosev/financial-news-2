Colombia ’s largest rebel group will
release six hostages, some of whom who have been held in
captivity for more than a decade, as a humanitarian gesture
following the death of its leader Alfonso Cano in November.  “The course that the country requires is the great march
toward peace,” according to a  statement  from the Revolutionary
Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, a copy of which was published
by media including  Venezuela ’s Telesur.  Those slated to be released include police officers Jorge
Trujillo, Jorge Romero and Jose Libardo Forero as well as three
other hostages the half-century old Marxist insurgency said it
would identify at a later date.  While the rebel group didn’t say when it would free the
hostages, that may take place by the first half of January,
Carlos Lozano, a journalist and member of the group Colombians
for Peace, told  Caracol Radio .  The hostages, which the FARC call ‘prisoners of war,’ were
captured by the guerrilla group in an assault on a town in Meta
province in 1999. They will be released to former Senator Piedad
Cordoba, an ally of Venezuelan President  Hugo Chavez , the FARC
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
