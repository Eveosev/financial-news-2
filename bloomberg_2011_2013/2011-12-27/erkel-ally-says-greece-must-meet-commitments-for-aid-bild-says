Wolfgang Bosbach , a German
politician from  Chancellor Angela Merkel ’s  Christian Democratic
Union , said continued aid payments to  Greece  depend on the
country’s meeting its commitments,  Bild-Zeitung  reported, citing
an interview.  “As long as it’s entirely unclear where Greece is going
politically, the country can’t expect that further billion-euro
aid is paid all the time,” Bild cited Bosbach as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
