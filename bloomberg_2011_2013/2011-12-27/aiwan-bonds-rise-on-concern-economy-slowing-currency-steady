Taiwan’s government bonds gained,
with  five-year  yields dropping from the highest level this
month, on concern the island’s economy is slowing. The local
dollar was little changed.  Industrial output  shrank for the first time in two years in
November, while export orders rose the least since September
2009, official data showed last week. The government sold NT$35
billion ($1.2 billion) of 10-year securities yesterday and
attracted bids worth 1.48 percent times the amount on offer, the
highest ratio since June.  “It’s all about fundamentals now, the November economic
data wasn’t impressive,” said  Albert Lee , a Taipei-based fixed-
income trader at Cathay United Bank Co. “Yields are also
falling as traders scale back their short-sell trades after a
pretty good bond sale result yesterday.”  The yield on the 1.25 percent notes maturing in September
2021, the most-traded  government securities , fell two basis
points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 1.273 percent, according to
prices from Gretai Securities Market.  The yield on the 1.25 percent notes due January 2017, the
new five-year debt that started trading today, fell four basis
points to 0.987 percent, according to prices from Gretai
Securities Market.  Benchmark  five-year rates rose to 1.03
percent yesterday, the highest this month.  Taiwan’s dollar was little changed at NT$30.312 against its
U.S. counterpart, according to Taipei Forex Inc.  The central bank will leave its benchmark rate unchanged at
1.875 percent when it meets on Dec. 29, according to 11 of 15
economists in a Bloomberg survey. Four predict a reduction to
1.750 percent.  The  overnight money-market rate , which measures interbank
funding availability, fell one basis point to 0.40 percent,
according to a weighted average compiled by the Taiwan Interbank
Money Center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
