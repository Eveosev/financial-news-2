Saudi Electricity Co. (SECO)  will start an
electricity-transmission company on Jan. 1 as part of a plan
aimed at turning the state-controlled power producer into a
holding company, the  Saudi Press Agency  reported.  The new holding company will also own a distribution
business and four separate power-generating companies, the
Riyadh-based service said, citing Saudi Electricityâ€™s Chief
Executive Officer Ali Al Barrak. The restructuring plan is
estimated to cost 200 million riyals ($53 million), it said.  Saudi Electricity has no plans to offer stakes in the new
entities in a public sale, SPA added, citing Al Barrak.  To contact the reporter on this story:
