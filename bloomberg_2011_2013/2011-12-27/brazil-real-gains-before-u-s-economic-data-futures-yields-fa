Yields on Brazil’s interest-rate
futures contracts fell for the first time in four days on
speculation the central bank will keep lowering borrowing costs
to spur economic growth.  Yields on the Brazilian futures contract due in January
2013 fell five basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 10.13
percent at 11:48 a.m. in  Sao Paulo , after a jump of 35 basis
points in the previous three days. The real was little changed
at 1.8585 per dollar, leaving it down 11 percent this year.  President  Dilma Rousseff ’s administration aims to boost
growth to 5 percent in 2012 from an estimated 2.9 percent this
year and has said there is room to use monetary policy to
stimulate the economy. Yields on the rate futures contract
jumped last week after a government report showed unemployment
fell to a record low and the central bank said in a quarterly
inflation report that “robust” domestic demand may keep
driving up consumer prices.  The market “suffered a huge correction after the inflation
report, overshooting a lot,” said Roberto Simoes, head of
proprietary trading at BES Investimento do Brasil. “The central
bank will continue cutting. The markets went too far in the
correction.”  Brazil’s central bank has cut the benchmark lending rate
150 basis points since August, to 11 percent, to shore up the
economy amid the debt crisis in  Europe . The next two-day policy
meeting starts Jan. 17.  Inflation Target  The bank said in its inflation report last week that it
sees some barriers to slowing inflation to the target of 4.5
percent, including household demand and a strong labor market.
Policy makers maintained that a “moderate adjustment” in the
benchmark Selic rate is “consistent with inflation converging”
to its 4.5 percent target in 2012.  Consumer prices rose 6.56 percent in the year through mid-
December, breaching the upper limit of the central bank’s target
range for an eighth month. The central bank aims to keep
inflation at 4.5 percent, plus or minus two percentage points.  Inflation will slow to 5.33 percent next year, according to
the median forecast in a central bank survey of about 100
economists on Dec. 23, less than the 5.39 percent forecast the
week earlier. Economists expect  Brazil ’s central bank to cut its
key rate by 0.5 percentage point to 10.5 percent in January, and
to 9.5 percent by the end of 2012 as inflation slows, the survey
found.  Brazil’s unemployment rate fell to 5.2 percent last month,
from 5.7 percent in October, the statistics agency said on Dec.
