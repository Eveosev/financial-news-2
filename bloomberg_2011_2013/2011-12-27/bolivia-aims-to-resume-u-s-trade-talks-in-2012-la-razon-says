Bolivia’s government aims to resume
talks with the U.S. next year to reduce import tariffs on the
Andean country’s textile exports, daily  La Razon  reported,
citing Vice President Alvaro Garcia Linera.  Bolivia’s  economy  expanded 5.4 percent this year, exports
totaled about $8 billion and central bank reserves rose to $12
billion, Garcia Linera told the La Paz-based newspaper.  Bolivia will focus on building hydroelectric plants and
spurring a domestic industry for lithium, potassium, natural
gas, ammonia and fertilizers over the next four years, La Razon
reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
