Hungarian Supreme Court Chief
Justice Andras Baka said the government is forcing him out of
his job before the end of his mandate because he was critical of
the Cabinet’s judicial overhaul, Index reported today.  Baka said he disagrees with giving one person the power to
name all new judges in  Hungary , he told the news website in an
 interview . Reducing the retirement age of judges was a
“political decision” to allow Prime Minister  Viktor Orban ’s
administration to pick new judges, Baka said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
