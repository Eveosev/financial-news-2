German notes rose, pushing the rate
on two-year notes to less than 0.2 percent for the  first time ,
as investors sought the safest assets before Italy auctions as
much as 20 billion euros ($26.2 billion) of debt.  Italian benchmark debt held three days of declines. German
bonds snapped a two-day drop after International Monetary Fund
Managing Director  Christine Lagarde  said the world economy is in
danger because of  Europe ’s financial woes. Dutch and Finnish
note yields also fell. Italy plans to sell 9 billion euros of
179-day bills and as much as 2.5 billion euros of zero-coupon
notes due in 2013 tomorrow. It will offer bonds due between 2014
and 2022 on Dec. 29.  “The auction will be quite a big event,” said Alessandro Giansanti, a senior rates strategist at ING Groep NV in
Amsterdam. “It will continue to drive Italian yields higher and
will have an effect on bunds with a flight to quality.”  The yield on two-year German notes dropped six basis points
to 0.17 percent at 4:50 p.m. London time, after reaching 0.158
percent, the least since Bloomberg began collecting the data in
1990. The 0.25 percent security due December 2013 rose 0.115, or
1.15 euros per 1,000-euro face amount, to 100.16.  Italian 10-year note yields were two basis points higher at
7 percent. The additional yield investors demand to hold the
benchmark securities instead of German bunds widened to as much
as 520 basis points, or 5.2 percentage points, the most since
Nov. 17.  Euro Crisis  German  government bonds  have rallied this year as Europe’s
debt crisis stoked demand for the region’s safest fixed-income
investments. The debt has handed investors a profit of 8.9
percent this year, the most since 2008, according to indexes
compiled by the European Federation of Financial Analysts
Societies and Bloomberg. Italian debt lost 5.9 percent, and
Greek securities dropped 63 percent, the indexes show.  Europe has made progress in tackling the financial woes but
needs to speed up the implementation of crisis-fighting
measures, Lagarde said in an interview with  Le Journal du
Dimanche . The U.S. is already being affected and growth
forecasts for  China ,  Brazil  and  Russia  are also being lowered,
she told the newspaper.  Spanish government debt advanced today even after Economy
and Competition Minister Luis de Guindos said yesterday in
 Madrid  the nation’s economy has suffered a “relapse” and will
contract as the  People’s Party  takes over the nation’s finances
from the Socialists. “The next two quarters aren’t going to be
easy,” he said.  Spanish Debt  Two-year Spanish note yields dropped 12 basis points to
3.58 percent and the rate on 10-year debt slipped four basis
points to 5.33 percent.  Germany ’s government is revising its forecast for 1 percent
economic growth in 2012 and will present a lower figure in mid-
January, Focus magazine reported yesterday, without citing
anyone.  The nation’s economy ministry denied the Focus report,
saying no decision has been made. An analysis of potential
growth is still ongoing, a spokeswoman said in an e-mailed
statement, declining to be identified, citing ministry policy.  The yield on  Finland ’s two-year notes slid as much as eight
basis points to 0.35 percent and Dutch two-year note yields
plunged 11 basis points to 0.22 percent.  Euribor futures also rose, pushing the implied yield on the
December 2012 contract eight basis points lower to 0.91 percent,
a sign investors were adding to bets for lower borrowing costs.  The  European Central Bank  last week lent 523 banks 489
billion euros for three years in its latest attempt to keep
credit flowing to the economy.  To contact the reporters on this story:
