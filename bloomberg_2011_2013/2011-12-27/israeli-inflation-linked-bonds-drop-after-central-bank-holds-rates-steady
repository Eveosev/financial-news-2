Israeli consumer price index-linked
bonds declined, pushing yields to the highest level in a week,
on speculation inflation will remain within the government’s
target range after the central bank held borrowing costs.  The yield on the inflation-linked notes maturing in June
2014 climbed four basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to
0.69 percent at 11:10 a.m. in  Tel Aviv , the highest since Dec.
20. The rate on the consumer price-linked bonds due April 2018
rose two basis points to 1.51 percent.  “There was nothing dramatic in the decision, we’re going
to continue in a low inflation environment with a global
recession and global  interest rates  staying low,” said Moshik Yaniv, head of the local fixed-income desk at Migdal Capital
Markets Ltd. in Tel Aviv.  The Bank of  Israel  yesterday maintained its  benchmark
interest rate  at 2.75 percent after reducing it twice in three
months, saying the economy was expanding and that policy makers
wanted to be able to react to future developments. Eight out of
20 economists  surveyed  by Bloomberg forecast the decision, while
12 predicted a quarter-point decrease. The bank lowered its 2012
 growth  forecast to 2.8 percent from a September prediction of
3.2 percent, citing the European debt crisis.  November inflation slowed to 2.6 percent, the  third month 
this year that the rate is within the government’s 1 percent to
3 percent target range. The two-year break-even rate, the yield
difference between inflation-linked bonds and fixed-rate
government bonds of similar maturity, rose four basis points to
197, implying an average annual inflation rate of 1.97 percent.  The yield on the benchmark 5.5 percent notes due in January
2022 rose three basis points to 4.56 percent. The shekel
weakened 0.3 percent to 3.7874 a dollar.  The  Tel Aviv Bond 40 Index , which measures inflation-linked
and fixed-rate corporate bonds, rose less than 0.1 percent to
257.11.  To contact the reporter on this story:
