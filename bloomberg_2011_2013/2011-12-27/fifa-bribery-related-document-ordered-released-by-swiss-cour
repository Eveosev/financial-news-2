A Swiss appeals court ordered the
release of a document related to a bribery case involving
soccer’s global governing body, FIFA.  The court in the canton of Zug rejected an appeal by FIFA
and others against a February 2011 decision by prosecutors to
grant access to the files in the case dating from 2010,
according to a judicial  filing .  FIFA  won’t appeal against the court’s decision and declined
to comment further until the dossier is published, the Zurich-
based organization said in an e-mailed statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
