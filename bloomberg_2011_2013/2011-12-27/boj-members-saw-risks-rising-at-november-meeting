A “few”  Bank of Japan (8301)  board
members said financial-market turmoil from the European debt
crisis and the yen’s appreciation were increasing risks for
growth, according to a record of last month’s board meeting.  Those members “pointed to the possibility that downside
risks to the economy had increased somewhat since the previous
meeting” held in October, according to minutes of the Nov. 15-
16 gathering published today in  Tokyo . The BOJ refrained from
altering policy at the time, and also kept its asset purchases
and benchmark  interest rate  unchanged this month.  Today’s report didn’t specify how many people shared that
view and members in the record aren’t identified by name. The
central bank last week lowered its economic assessment for a
second month at its December board meeting.  A lack of full subscriptions to BOJ offers to buy corporate
debt is one sign the central bank’s monetary easing has been
effective, according to today’s minutes. The central bank has
been buying corporate bonds as part of its 20-trillion-yen ($256
billion) asset-buying facility.  The BOJ also published minutes of a Nov. 30 board meeting,
when central banks around the world jointly reduced the premium
they charge commercial lenders to borrow dollars. Members said
there was a possibility a further deterioration in global-
financial markets may hurt  Japan ’s financial system and
conditions, according to the record.  To contact the reporter on this story:
