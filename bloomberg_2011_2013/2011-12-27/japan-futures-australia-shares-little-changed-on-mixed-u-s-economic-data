Japanese  stock (MXAP)   futures  and
Australian stocks were little changed after reports that U.S.
housing prices fell while consumer confidence gained gave mixed
signals about the health of the world’s biggest economy.  Futures (TPX)  on Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  were bid in the
pre-market at 8,440 in Osaka, at 8:05 a.m., compared with 8,450
yesterday. Volume on the Nikkei 225 yesterday was almost 60
percent below the 100-day average, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index was little changed
today. New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index rose 0.4 percent in Wellington.  “Any upside in stocks is likely to be limited amid the
sluggish turnover we’re seeing in the market,” said Hiroichi Nishi, an equities manager in Tokyo at SMBC Nikko Securities Inc.
“Economic prospects for the U.S. look a little brighter, but we
still need to keep an eye on the housing market.”  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPXL1)  slipped 0.1
percent today. The index was little changed yesterday in New
York as a better-than-estimated consumer confidence report
overshadowed a decline in home prices and concern about Europe’s
debt crisis.  In Japan, shares of  Tokyo Electric Power Co. (9501)  may fall today
after Industry Minister Yukio Edano said the utility should
consider temporary government control.  Nomura Holdings Inc. (8604)  may move after the Nikkei newspaper
said the brokerage will invest $100 million in a Chinese
private-equity fund. The report didn’t say where it got the
information.  Crude Rises  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , Australia’s No. 1 oil producer, dropped
0.5 percent in Sydney even after crude prices advanced for a
sixth trading session, the longest winning streak in more than a
year.  Crude settled at the highest level in six weeks after
 Iran ’s official Islamic Republic News Agency cited Vice
President Mohammad Reza Rahimi as saying the country would bar
shipments through the Strait of Hormuz if sanctions are imposed
on its oil exports.  The Bloomberg  China-US 55 Index  of the most-actively traded
Chinese equities fell 0.3 percent to 95.48 yesterday.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index declined 17 percent this year
through yesterday, compared with a gain of 0.6 percent by the
S&P 500 and a 12 percent drop by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.
Stocks in the Asian benchmark are valued at 12.7 times estimated
earnings on average, compared with 12.8 times for the S&P 500
and 10.5 times for the Stoxx 600.  To contact the reporters on this story:
