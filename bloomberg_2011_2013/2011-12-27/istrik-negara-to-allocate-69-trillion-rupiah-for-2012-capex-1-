PT Perusahaan Listrik Negara, 
 Indonesia ’s state-owned utility, will allocate 69 trillion
rupiah for  capital expenditures  in 2012, according to a
statement distributed to reporters in Jakarta today.  Listrik Negara will use the funds for building power plants,
developing renewable energy and providing electricity to more
villages, according to the statement. Listrik Negara targets
adding 2.54 million new customers next year, it said.  Listrik’s coal usage will increase by 34 percent to 39.6
million tons in 2012, as it reduces reliance on  petroleum  in
power stations, it said. Listrik Negara expects its natural gas
consumption to rise by 25 percent to 356.36 tera British thermal
units in 2012, the company said.  Listrik Negara plans to cut petroleum intake for
electricity generation by 30 percent in 2012 to 7.49 million
kilo liters, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
