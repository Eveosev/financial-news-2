      Dec. 27 (Bloomberg) --The Italian Treasury said it will go
ahead with a plan to sell a new debt instrument directly to
retail investors in 2012.  The new bond will be sold through  Italy ’s electronic debt
exchange known as MOT, the Rome-based Treasury said in its 2012
debt auction plan released today. The Treasury, which did not
give details on the new bonds, said it may also consider selling
existing bonds directly to retail investors through the program.  Italy needs to sell almost 450 billion euros ($586
billion) of debt next year to pay for maturing bonds and bills
and to cover the government’s budget deficit, Maria Cannata,
director of public debt, told Il Sole 24-Ore said on Dec. 24.  Italy’s Treasury faces 202 billion euros of bond
redemptions and will need to finance a deficit of 23.6 billion
euros, Cannata told the newspaper. The Treasury hasn’t yet
released the official goals of its 2012 debt program.  The Treasury announced on Dec. 23 that it would auction
four new bonds in the first quarter of next year and said it
would seek to sell between 9 billion euros and 12 billion euros
of each before they would replaced by a new benchmark. The
securities are a zero-coupon note maturing Jan. 2014, a three
year bond due in March 2015, a five-year bond due in May 2017
and a new 10 year maturing in Sept. 2022.  Auction Announcements  Other changes to the auction process published today
include making a single announcement of the amount and type of
securities to be issued three days before the start of the
auction “to manage more effectively the extreme volatility that
characterizes the market for government debt in this phase,”
the Treasury said. This year the Treasury would first announce
the bond that would be on sale and then days later announce the
amount to be sold.  The plan for 2012 will also allow specialists in  government
bonds  to buy more debt at follow-up auctions held the day after
the main debt sales. Probably starting from the second quarter,
primary dealers will be allowed to request bonds worth as much
as 15 percent of the amount sold at the main sale, higher than
the 10 percent in 2011. They will be allowed to order as much as
30 percent if it is the first tranche of a new bond, the
Treasury said.  To contact the reporter on this story: Chiara Vasarri in Milan
