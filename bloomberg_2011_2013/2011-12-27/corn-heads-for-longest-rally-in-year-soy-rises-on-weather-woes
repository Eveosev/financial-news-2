Corn rose, capping the longest rally
in a year, and soybeans jumped the most in 11 weeks on
speculation that adverse weather threatens to reduce output in
 South America , bolstering demand for U.S. supplies.  About 50 percent of the crops in Argentina will be dry in
the next 10 days after weekend rain stayed north of the main
growing regions, Commodity Weather Group LLC said in a report.
As much as a third of  Brazil ’s crops face a lack of rain, the
forecaster said.  “Current weather trends are raising the odds that the
South American crops will be reduced,”  Dave Marshall , a farm-
marketing adviser at Toay Commodity Futures Group LLC in
Nashville, Illinois, said in a report. “Odds favor continued
gains into the end of the year, as long as the South American
 weather forecasts  don’t change.”  Corn futures for March delivery rose 2.2 percent to close
at $6.3325 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the Chicago Board of Trade,
the seventh straight gain and the longest rally since Dec. 29,
2010. Earlier, the grain reached $6.3675, the highest for a
most-active contract since Nov. 17.  Soybean futures for March delivery rose 3.2 percent to
$12.095 a bushel, the biggest advance since Oct. 11. It was the
eighth straight gain, the longest rally since mid-July. Earlier,
the oilseed reached $12.15, the highest since Nov. 8.  Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, valued at $66.7 billion in
2010, followed by soybeans at $38.9 billion, government data
show. The CBOT was closed yesterday for a public holiday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
