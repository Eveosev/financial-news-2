U.S. stocks were little changed,
following the longest rally since September, as better-than-
estimated consumer confidence data overshadowed a decline in
 home prices  and concern about  Europe ’s debt crisis.  Mead Johnson (MJN)  Nutrition Co. jumped 5.8 percent after the
world’s leading seller of children’s formula said tests showed
no bacteria in a batch of the product used by a baby who died.
Sears Holdings Corp. plunged 27 percent as it plans to close as
many as  120 stores. (SHLD)  Financial shares in the Standard & Poor’s
500 Index fell 0.7 percent as Morgan Stanley slumped 3 percent.  The  S&P 500  rose less than 0.1 percent to 1,265.43 at 4
p.m. New York time, after rallying 5 percent in four days. It
has added 0.6 percent so far this year. The  Dow Jones Industrial
Average  lost 2.65 points, or less than 0.1 percent, to
12,291.35. The index has gained 6.2 percent in 2011. Both are
among the 10  best (SPX)  performers in 2011 among 91 national indexes
tracked by Bloomberg. About 3.6 billion shares changed hands on
U.S. exchanges, or 53 percent below the three-month average.  “I’m ready to kiss this year goodbye,”  James Paulsen , who
helps oversee about $333 billion as chief investment strategist
at Minneapolis-based Wells Capital Management, said in a
telephone interview. “You’ve got such a dead week with few
players. The consumer confidence report is the big one of the
day. With the data coming out of the U.S. getting better day in
and day out, people have calmed down a little bit.”  The S&P 500 was headed for the best fourth-quarter since
1999, rising 12 percent since the end of September, on better-
than-forecast economic data and steps taken by European leaders
to tame the region’s debt crisis. It fell as much as 19 percent
from this year’s high in April on concern over Europe’s woes.  Economic Data  Stocks swung between gains and losses today. Confidence
among U.S. consumers rose in December to the highest level in
eight months. Another report showed that residential real estate
prices  dropped  more than forecast in the year ended October.
Italian bonds erased losses that had driven yields to 7.14
percent today. The nation is preparing to auction as much as 20
billion euros ($26.2 billion) of debt in the next two days.  “Confirmation of gradual improvement of the  U.S. economy 
bodes well for the global market,” Chad Morganlander, a Florham
Park, New Jersey-based money manager at Stifel Nicolaus & Co.,
which oversees more than $107 billion in client assets, said in
a telephone interview. “Still, the persistent fragility within
the global sovereign  debt market  will continue to create
uncertainty among investors.”  Mead Johnson jumped 5.8 percent, the biggest gain in the
S&P 500, to $69.08. The Glenview, Illinois-based company fell 15
percent from Dec. 22 to Dec. 23 after Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and
other retailers pulled Enfamil Newborn formula from shelves.  Limit Oversight  MetLife Inc. (MET)  rose 0.3 percent to $31.20 after agreeing to
sell most of its U.S. deposit banking business to  General
Electric Co. (GE)  as the largest U.S. life insurer seeks to limit
oversight by the  Federal Reserve .  Gap Inc. (GPS)  gained 2.4 percent to $19.06. The clothing
retailer may rise to $22 or higher in the next year as it
expands its online business and opens stores outside the U.S.,
Barron’s reported.  Sears tumbled 27 percent, the most since 2003, to $33.38.
The shares also had the biggest decline in the S&P 500. The
store closures will generate $140 million to $170 million of
cash from sales of inventory and the leasing or sales of the
locations, the company said today. Sears will record total non-
cash charges of as much as $2.4 billion in the fourth quarter
related to a valuation allowance and goodwill impairment.  Banks Drop  The KBW Bank Index dropped 0.9 percent as 19 of its 24
stocks declined.  Bank of America Corp. (BAC)  slid 2.1 percent, the
most in the Dow, to $5.48.  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  declined 1.6
percent to $33.03.  Morgan Stanley slumped 3 percent to $15.29. The bank, whose
shares have declined 44 percent this year, said in a filing
today that 580 of the 1,600 job cuts announced earlier this
month will come from New York City.  The S&P 500 probably will retreat to near its 2011 low, or
about 15 percent, in the first half of next year before rallying
in the second half, Bank of America’s Mary Ann Bartels said.  The benchmark measure is likely to test the low of 1,074.77
it reached in October, said Bartels, the New York-based head of
technical and market analysis at the firm, in an interview on
Bloomberg Television’s “Inside Track” with Scarlet Fu and Sara Eisen. If events related to Europe’s debt crisis continue to
weigh on the market, the measure may fall as low as 934, she
said.  ‘Base-Building Process’  “Since August we’ve been in a base-building process,”
Bartels said. “The first half of 2012 is going to be a rough go
and the second half will be much more bullish.”  The S&P 500 could rally to about 1,300 to 1,350, close to
the high end of this year’s trading range, Bartels said. The
index peaked at 1,370.58 on May 2. Investors with “very, very
long-term” views, such as a span of one or two years, should be
buying stocks today, she said.  Stock swings that reached twice the five-decade average
left the S&P 500 with the smallest price change in 41 years and
utilities, soapmakers and health-care providers at the highest
valuations since 2008.  The S&P 500 rose 3.7 percent last week, sending the measure
to a gain of 0.6 percent for the year. The last time it moved
less on an annual basis was in 1970, when it fell 0.1 percent.
Within the gauge, companies least tied to economic growth, such
as  Biogen Idec Inc. (BIIB)  and  Hershey Co. (HSY) , increased an average 15.7
percent including dividends, returning 8.2 times more than the
index after adjusting for historical price swings. That’s the
biggest gap since at least 1989.  Bears vs. Bulls  Bears say that the 2011 performance means there are even
fewer stocks worth buying after valuations for defensive shares
increased 7.4 percent. With the U.S. showing more signs of
growth, bulls say the divergence between those shares and
companies most dependent on the economy preceded market-wide
rallies in 2001, 2007 and 2009.  “The combination of a very crowded trade and a market
that’s very cheap with a lot of doubters suggests to me the
place to put funds is in the market overall,” Andrew Slimmon,
the Chicago-based managing director of global investment
solutions at  Morgan Stanley (MS)  Smith Barney LLC, which has $1.7
trillion in client assets, said in a phone interview Dec. 19.  To contact the reporter on this story:
