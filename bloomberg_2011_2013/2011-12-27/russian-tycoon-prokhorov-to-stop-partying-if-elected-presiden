Russia’s billionaire bachelor
 Mikhail Prokhorov  pledged to stop partying and maybe even marry
if he is elected president.  “If I become president, I won’t be able to party
anymore,” Prokhorov, 46, said in an interview with Rossiya 24
state television broadcast today. “If the country says it’s
necessary, I’ll marry.”  The owner of the New Jersey Nets basketball club, who is
challenging Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin  in March presidential
elections, was detained five years ago in France on suspicion of
what authorities called “pimping.”  French police held Prokhorov for several days in January
2007 in the ski resort of Courchevel, where he was vacationing
with a group of friends that included eight young women who were
mistakenly believed to be prostitutes, the billionaire said in
an interview last year.  The investor, who owns stakes in aluminum producer United
Co.  Rusal (486) , investment bank Renaissance Capital and  Polyus Gold (PLZL) 
International Ltd., increased his wealth by almost $5 billion
last year to $18 billion, making him the third-wealthiest
Russian, Forbes said in its rich list published in April.  To contact the reporter on this story:
