Chinese rules governing insider
trading cases are under review by the nation’s judiciary, the
state run Xinhua News Agency reported, citing an official with
the country’s securities and futures watchdog.  A judicial interpretation will focus on the investigation
and burden of proof in such cases, said Gui Minjie, vice
chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission,
according to Xinhua. Such rulings are binding and typically
given by the Supreme People’s Court, Xinhua said.  The ruling would come soon, it said, without elaborating.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
