China  called for efforts to maintain
peace and stability on the Korean peninsula and the wider region
after the death of  Kim Jong Il .  Stability on the peninsula serves everyone’s interests, and
Kim’s son, Kim Jong Un, will continue to advance the cause of
socialism, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei said at a
regular briefing. Hong said China and North Korea are “friendly
neighbors.”  Maintaining stability and development in North Korea
“serves the common interest of all parties, and meets the
aspirations of the international community,” Hong said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
