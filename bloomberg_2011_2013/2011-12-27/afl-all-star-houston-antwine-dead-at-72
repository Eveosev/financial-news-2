Houston Antwine, a six-time American
Football League All-Star at defensive tackle and a member of the
New England Patriots’ 50th Anniversary Team, has died. He was
72.  Antwine died yesterday in  Memphis ,  Tennessee , the Patriots
said today in an e-mailed statement. His wife, Evelyn, passed
away this morning, the team said.  The Patriots didn’t provide a cause of death for either
person. Memphis Police Department spokeswoman Alyssa Macon-Moore
didn’t immediately return a voicemail seeking comment.  “For those of us who grew up watching the Boston Patriots,
this is a really sad day,” Patriots owner  Robert Kraft  said in
the statement. “In the 1960s, the defensive tackle tandem of
‘Twine’ and Jim Lee Hunt were as good as any in the league and
helped propel the Patriots to the franchise’s first division
championship in 1963.”  A native of Louise, Mississippi, Antwine attended  Southern
Illinois University , where he played tackle on the football team
and won a  National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics 
wrestling title. He is a member of the school’s athletic Hall of
Fame, according to the Patriots’ release.  Antwine was selected by the  Houston Oilers  in the eighth
round of the 1961 AFL Draft, and was traded before playing a
game to the Boston Patriots. He spent 11 of his 12 professional
seasons with the Patriots franchise in the AFL and  National
Football League , before playing his final season with the
 Philadelphia Eagles  in 1972.  Antwine led the Patriots in sacks in the 1967, 1968 and
1969 seasons, and had 39 sacks in 142 games with the team. He
was an AFL All-Star from 1963 to 1968 and a member of the
franchise’s All-Decade Team for the 1960s.  To contact the reporter on this story:
