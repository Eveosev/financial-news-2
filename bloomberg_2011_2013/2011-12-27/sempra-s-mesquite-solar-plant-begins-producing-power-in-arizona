Sempra Energy (SRE) , California’s third-
largest utility, began producing power at a 150-megawatt solar
project in Arizona that received a $337 million U.S. Energy
Department loan guarantee three months ago.  Workers at the Mesquite Solar 1 project connected 42
megawatts of  Suntech Power Holdings Co. (STP)  panels to the power
grid, San Diego-based Sempra said today in a statement.  The plant, located about 40 miles (64 kilometers) west of
Phoenix, is expected to be complete in 2013 and will produce
enough power for 50,000 homes, Sempra said. The company is
selling the power to California’s largest utility, PG&E Corp.,
under a 20-year contract.  Southern California Edison Co. is the state’s second-
largest utility.  To contact the reporter on this story:
