U.S. bus operators may face new
limits on drivers’ work hours, after the Department of
Transportation last week released revised rules for truckers and
airline pilots.  The agency is seeking public comment and data on driving
time and its association with safety as it considers new rules,
according to a  notice  set for publication tomorrow in the
Federal Register. Bus companies operate differently from
trucking companies, requiring the Federal Motor Carrier Safety
Administration to gather separate data, the notice said.  Rules for driving and on-duty time for bus drivers haven’t
been updated in “several decades,” the notice said. It is
looking into possible changes at a time the bus has become the
fastest-growing mode of U.S. transportation, with daily
departures up 7.1 percent this year, according to a DePaul
University study released Dec. 21.  Twenty-eight people have died in eight U.S. bus crashes
this year. The  National Transportation Safety Board  warned in an
Oct. 31 study that curbside operators, which account for most of
the industry’s growth, are seven times more likely to be
involved in a fatal wreck than intercity lines with more
conventional business models.  The agency will hear comments on Jan. 9 in Grapevine,
 Texas .  To contact the reporter on this story:
