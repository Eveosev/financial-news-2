Colombia ’s peso rose to a five-week
high on speculation economic growth will draw more foreign
investment to the South American country next year.  The peso touched 1,913.98 per  U.S. dollar , the strongest
intraday level since Nov. 18. It closed little changed today at
1,922.50, from 1,923 yesterday.  “Colombia’s good fundamentals point to a stronger peso
next year as the country attracts investment from abroad,” said
Francisco Chaves, a fixed-income analyst at brokerage Corredores
Asociados in Bogota.  The economy probably expanded more than 5.5 percent this
year, fueled by a surge in spending on infrastructure and a
record $13 billion in foreign direct investment, President  Juan Manuel Santos  said yesterday. That tops the average for  Latin
America , which is forecast to grow 4.4 percent this year,
according to a Dec. 21 report by the United Nations Economic
Commission for Latin America. Colombia will grow 4.5 percent
next year, more than the region’s 3.7 percent estimated pace for
2012, according to the  report .  The currency also gained today as investors closed out bets
for a drop, Chaves said. Increased dollar holdings at Colombian
banks this year have helped the peso avoid the kind of declines
it posted at the end of 2010, he said.  The central bank’s daily dollar purchases last year
depleted cash holdings of the U.S. currency in local banks,
sinking the peso to a seven-month low of 2,027.5 on Dec. 28,
2010.  “Investors were betting on a weaker peso at the end of the
year and since that didn’t happen they are purchasing pesos,
betting on gains next year,” he said.  The yield on the nation’s 10 percent bonds due in July 2024
fell one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 7.63 percent,
according to the stock exchange. The bond’s price rose 0.087
centavo to 118.648 centavos per peso.  To contact the reporter on this story:
