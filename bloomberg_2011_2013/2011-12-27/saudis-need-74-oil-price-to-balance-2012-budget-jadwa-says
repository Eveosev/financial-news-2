Saudi Arabia , the world’s largest
oil exporter, needs $74 a barrel for its crude exports next year
to balance its budget, Jadwa Investment Co. said.  For Saudi  oil prices  to reach $74 a barrel, the kingdom
needs around $70 a barrel for WTI and $78 a barrel for Brent,
Jadwa, a diversified investment business based in  Riyadh , said
in an emailed report today. Saudi Arabia, the largest Arab
economy, forecast a budget surplus of 12 billion riyals ($3.2
billion) in 2012 in a statement yesterday.  Daily Saudi production next year may average 8.8 million
barrels and domestic consumption will average 2.4 million
barrels as the country consumes more natural gas locally instead
of crude, according to the statement.  The 2011 budget was based on a price for Saudi oil of $56
per barrel and production of 8.3 million barrels per day, Jadwa
estimated.  “With a few days of the year left, it seems likely that
the actual price of Saudi oil will average $105 per barrel,” it
said. “Production will be around 9.3 million barrels per day,
after it was raised to compensate for the shortfall from
 Libya .”  Saudi Arabia raised output this year as demand rose, oil
minister Ali Al-Naimi said on Dec. 12 in Vienna. The kingdom
pumped 10.047 million barrels of crude a day in November, he
said. That’s the highest since at least 1980, according to data
from the U.S. Energy Department.  To contact the reporter on this story:
