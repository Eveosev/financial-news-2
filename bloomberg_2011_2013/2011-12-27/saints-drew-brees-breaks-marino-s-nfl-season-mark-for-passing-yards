New Orleans Saints quarterback Drew
Brees broke  Dan Marino ’s National Football League record for
passing yards in a season.  Brees threw a nine-yard touchdown pass to Darren Sproles
during tonight’s game against the Atlanta Falcons to surpass
Marino’s mark of 5,084 yards set in 1984. Brees entered the game
305 yards shy of the record.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
