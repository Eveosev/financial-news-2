Enterprise Products Partners LP (EPD) 
agreed to sell units of Energy Transfer Equity LP for about
$825.1 million, reducing its holdings in the rival pipeline
company by 83 percent this year.  Enterprise, the  second-largest owner (ETE)  of Energy Transfer,
will sell the 22.8 million units to unidentified buyers, the
Houston-based company said in a statement today. The sale will
leave it with about 6.5 million Energy Transfer units, down from
39 million in May, Randy Burkhalter, Enterprise vice president
for  investor relations , said in an interview.  Proceeds from the sale will be used for capital projects
and other purposes, Enterprise said. The company owns 50,000
miles (80,000 kilometers) of oil and refined-products pipelines.
It began buying Energy Transfer units in 2007 to expand its
natural-gas footprint, Burkhalter said. Enterprise, which opened
a $1.5 billion Louisiana gas pipeline last month, has found
other ways to invest in the fuel, he said.  Energy Transfer expects to close its $5.3 billion purchase
of Southern Union Co. in the first quarter of next year. Energy
Transfer, based in  Dallas , sued Enterprise for breach of
contract in October, after plans to build an oil pipeline
between Oklahoma and Houston were scrapped.  Vicki Granado, a spokeswoman for Energy Transfer, had no
immediate comment on the sale. ETC Holdings LP, an entity that
holds units for Energy Transferâ€™s chief executive officer and
management, owns the largest share of the company, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Energy Transfer climbed 3.5 percent to close at $41.20 in
 New York . Enterprise rose less than 1 percent to $45.58.  To contact the reporter on this story:
