The  New York Knicks  added former
Harvard University guard Jeremy Lin, who was waived three days
ago by the  Houston Rockets .  Lin, 23, played 29 National Basketball Association games as
a rookie last season with the Golden State Warriors. He averaged
2.6 points, 1.4 assists and 1.2 rebounds, and was released by
the Warriors on Dec. 9 to clear space under the league’s payroll
ceiling.  The 6-foot-3 Lin joins the Knicks two days after rookie
Iman Shumpert sprained his right knee in a season-opening win
over the  Boston Celtics .  Lin played four years at Cambridge, Massachusetts-based
Harvard. He was a unanimous first-team Ivy League selection as a
senior, when he was a finalist for the Bob Cousy Award as the
nation’s top point guard and for the John R. Wooden Award as the
national player of the year. He’s one of three former Harvard
players who have been in the NBA or American Basketball
Association.  Lin is among 41 players from the eight Ivy League schools
who have played in the NBA or ABA, according to  basketball-
reference.com . The most prominent ex-Ivy Leaguers may be
 Princeton University ’s Bill Bradley, who won two NBA titles with
the Knicks, and Geoff Petrie, a former rookie of the year who is
now the Sacramento Kings’ president of basketball operations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
