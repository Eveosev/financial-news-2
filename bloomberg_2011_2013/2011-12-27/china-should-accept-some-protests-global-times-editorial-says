China  should accept some protests
and its people should have the “independent ability” to
evaluate the nation’s political situation, an editorial in
today’s Global Times newspaper said.  Because protests and demonstrations aren’t encouraged in
China, the government must improve social governance, the
editorial said. It must make improvements in livelihoods and
fight corruption, according to the English-language publication,
which is affiliated with the People’s Daily newspaper published
by the ruling Communist Party.  The freedom to protest in China shouldn’t be
“unrealistically” compared with those of the West, the
editorial said.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
