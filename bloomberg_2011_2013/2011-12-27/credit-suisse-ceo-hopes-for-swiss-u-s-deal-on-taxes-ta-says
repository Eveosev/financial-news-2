Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN)  Chief
Executive Officer Brady Dougan “hopes” for an agreement by the
Swiss and U.S. governments to end a dispute on taxation and bank
secrecy,  Tages-Anzeiger  reported.  Swiss banking will prevail due to its consistent quality,
even without the advantage of bank secrecy in tax matters,
Dougan was quoted as saying by the Zurich-based newspaper.  “ Switzerland  will remain the place where wealthy people
want to handle their bank activities, even after they’ve paid
taxes,” Dougan said, according to the report. “The trend for
tax honesty continues.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
