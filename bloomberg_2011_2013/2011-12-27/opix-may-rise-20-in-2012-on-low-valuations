Japanese stocks may rise next year
for the first time since 2009, with analysts projecting a 20
percent gain on the  Topix Index , as the lowest valuations in
almost three years lure investors.  The Topix may advance to 873 by the end of 2012, according
to the median estimate of 21 strategists and investors surveyed
by Bloomberg News. The gauge closed yesterday at 724.25. The
gain would be the biggest since 2005 on the Topix, the worst-
performing major benchmark since the depths of the financial
crisis in March 2009.  Analysts at banks from Morgan Stanley to Credit Suisse
Group AG a year ago predicted Japan’s broadest equities index
would gain more than 10 percent in 2011. Instead, the March
earthquake and ensuing nuclear crisis, floods in  Thailand  and a
surge in the yen sent the gauge plunging 20 percent.  The decline has cut the value of shares on the Topix to an
average of 0.86 times estimated  book value , the lowest level
since March 2009 and less than half the value of shares on the
 Standard & Poor’s 500 Index. (SPX)  A number below one means investors
can buy companies for less than the value of their assets.  The natural disasters “are things that happen once every
80 years,” said David Herro, manager of the $7.1 billion
Oakmark International Fund, who in February called Japanese
shares a “steal.” About a quarter of the fund’s assets are
invested in Japan. “If you liked Japanese stocks last year at
120 percent of book, you should like them better at 90 percent
of book.”  The Topix has risen 3.3 percent, compared with an 87
percent rebound on the  S&P 500 , since the world’s major equity
indexes bottomed in March 2009. Only 10 primary indexes --
including the Athens Stock Exchange General Index -- have
underperformed the Japanese gauge in the period, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Strategists Year-End Forecasts for  Japan  Stocks in 2012:
