German parliamentarians from
 Chancellor Angela Merkel â€™s political bloc are demanding
conditions from Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  for agreeing
to speed up the addition of funds to the European Stability
Mechanism,  Financial Times Deutschland  reported, citing Gerda
Hasselfeldt from the Bavarian CSU.  The group is prepared to agree to a faster increase if
other countries beside  Germany  also ramp up payments to the
fund, the newspaper cited Hasselfeldt as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
