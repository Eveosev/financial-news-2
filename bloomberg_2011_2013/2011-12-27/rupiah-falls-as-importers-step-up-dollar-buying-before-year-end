Indonesia ’s rupiah dropped to a one-
week low on speculation importers are increasing dollar
purchases before the year-end to pay bills. Bonds gained.  The currency snapped a three-day rally after finance
ministry data showed that global funds cut ownership of
Indonesian government debt by 1 percent in the week through Dec.
20 to 221.8 trillion rupiah ($24.2 billion). The rupiah has
dropped 1.1 percent this year, headed for its first annual
decline since 2008.  “Dollar liquidity is generally thin at the end of the
year,” said Saktiandi Supaat, head of foreign-exchange research
at Malayan Banking Bhd. in Singapore.  The rupiah slipped 0.6 percent from Dec. 23 to 9,110 per
dollar as of 3:15 p.m. in Jakarta, according to prices from
local banks compiled by Bloomberg. It touched 9,200, the weakest
level since Dec. 15. Local financial markets were closed
yesterday for a public holiday.  The rupiah will decline to 9,150 by the end of March,
Saktiandi predicted.  The yield on the government’s benchmark 8.25 percent notes
due July 2021 fell five basis points from Dec. 23 to 6.05
percent today, according to the Inter-Dealer Market Association.  To contact the reporter on this story:
