Oil options volatility increased as
the underlying futures rose after Iran threatened to block
transportation in the  Strait of Hormuz  and data showed
confidence among U.S. consumers beat expectations in December.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
February, a measure of expected swings in futures and a gauge of
options prices, was at 31.3 at 12:30 p.m. in New York, from 30.9
on Dec. 23.  Crude rose as much as 1.7 percent after the Conference
Board’s  index  climbed to 64.5 from a revised 55.2 reading in
November. It was forecast to advance to 58.9, according to the
 median forecast  of 69 economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  “There is this feeling that the  U.S. economy  is going to
improve and the worse of the recession is behind us,” said
