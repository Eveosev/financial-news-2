Stock swings that reached twice the
five-decade average left the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  with
the smallest price change in 41 years and utilities, soapmakers
and health-care providers at the highest valuations since 2008.  The  S&P 500  rose 3.7 percent last week, sending the measure
to a gain of 0.6 percent for the year. The last time it moved
less on an annual basis was in 1970, when it fell 0.1 percent.
Within the gauge, companies least tied to economic growth, such
as  Biogen Idec Inc. (BIIB)  and  Hershey Co. (HSY) , increased an average 15.7
percent including dividends, returning 8.2 times more than the
index after adjusting for historical price swings. That’s the
biggest gap since at least 1989.  Bears say that the 2011 performance means there are even
fewer stocks worth buying after valuations for defensive shares
increased 7.4 percent. With the U.S. showing more signs of
growth, bulls say the divergence between those shares and
companies most dependent on the economy preceded market-wide
rallies in 2001, 2007 and 2009.  “The combination of a very crowded trade and a market
that’s very cheap with a lot of doubters suggests to me the
place to put funds is in the market overall,” Andrew Slimmon,
the Chicago-based managing director of global investment
solutions at Morgan Stanley Smith Barney LLC, which has $1.7
trillion in client assets, said in a phone interview Dec. 19.  Annual Loss  While the S&P 500 barely moved on a year-to-date basis,
2011 was one of the most volatile years on record. Eighty-five
companies fell 20 percent or more, compared with 11 in 2010 and
15 in 2009.  First Solar Inc. (FSLR)  of Tempe, Arizona, posted the
biggest declines in the gauge, falling 73 percent, and  Alpha
Natural Resources Inc. (ANR)  in Bristol, Virginia, tumbled 65 percent.  The  Dow Jones Industrial Average (INDU)  alternated between gains
and losses of more than 400 points on four days for the first
time ever in August. Daily share swings in the S&P 500 averaged
2.2 percent that month, the most for any August since 1932,
Bloomberg data show. The index moved 1.3 percent a day since
April, compared with 50-year average of 0.6 percent before the
collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. in 2008.  After rising 8.4 percent to start 2011 and reaching an
almost three-year high of 1,363.61 on April 29, the S&P 500 fell
as much as 19 percent to 1,099.23 on Oct. 3 as Congress and the
administration of President Barack Obama struggled over deficit
cuts and  Europe  was forced to bail out Greece.  Manufacturing, Retail  The measure has trimmed its decline since April to 7.2
percent as U.S. manufacturing and retail sales rebounded and the
 unemployment rate  fell to 8.6 percent in November from 9.2
percent in June. The S&P 500 erased its loss for 2011 last week.
The index rose less than 0.1 percent to 1,265.43 at 4 p.m.  New
York  time today.  Utilities and household product makers are the only
industries with gains since the S&P 500’s April peak, rising 8.5
percent and 3.9 percent, respectively. Banks have declined 19
percent since then, commodity companies slid 16 percent and
energy producers are down 12 percent.  The  Stoxx Europe 600 Index  has declined 12 percent in 2011,
while the MSCI Emerging Markets Index lost 20 percent and the
MSCI World Index of shares in developed nations dropped 7.6
percent. Government bonds worldwide have returned 5.4 percent
this year as of Dec. 22, according to Bank of America Merrill
Lynch index data. That compares with 3.8 percent last year and
is the biggest gain since 2008.  Job Losses  Job losses in the global banking and financial-services
industry this year have topped 200,000, according to Bloomberg
data, as trading slumped and investment losses grew. Revenue
from investment banking and trading at the 10 largest global
firms fell 12 percent in the first nine months of this year,
after a 23 percent decline in 2010, according to industry
consultant Coalition Ltd.  “I was in such a good mood when the year started and
everything just went sour,”  Keith Wirtz , who oversees $14.6
billion as chief investment officer at Fifth Third Asset
Management in Cincinnati, said in a Dec. 22 phone interview.
“We were dealing with factors that felt unique.”  As equities tumbled and price swings increased, investors
bought companies whose earnings rely the least on economic
growth. Utilities returned 19 percent in 2011 with dividends,
led by  Oneok Inc. (OKE)  Household goods makers increased 14 percent,
pacing by gains in  Kraft Foods Inc. (KFT)  and health-care stocks rose
13 percent as Pfizer Inc. jumped.  Defensive Returns  Investors received even more from utility, staples and
health-care stocks than the S&P 500 this year after adjusting
for price volatility. The average return including dividends
from the three defensive groups was 8.2 times the S&P 500’s
return after taking into account past price fluctuations,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s the biggest
outperformance in risk-adjusted returns in more than two
decades, the data show.  So-called cyclical stocks, or companies most tied to
economic growth, posted the biggest losses in 2011. Banks fell
16 percent including dividends,  led by (S5FINL)  Bank of America Corp. and
 Genworth Financial Inc. (GNW) , while commodity companies, including
 U.S. Steel Corp. (X)  and  Alcoa Inc. (AA) , dropped 8.7 percent as a group.  Now, defensive shares trade at an average price of 14 times
reported profits, according to Bloomberg data. The average
valuation in 2011 was 13.6, the highest since 2008. That
compares with ratios of 13.3 for the S&P 500, 11 for banks and
12 for mining and chemical companies. Non-cyclical companies
have traded 5.9 percent below the index’s valuation on average
since 1999, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Slowed Growth  “Many of those defensive-type of businesses have become
crowded and expensive,” Chris Sheldon, who helps oversee $400
billion as chief investment officer for Dreyfus in New York,
said in a telephone interview on Dec. 21. “We expect a twist in
the flavor to occur at some point next year. Europe’s debt
crisis has slowed growth worldwide, but not interrupted it.”  While profits at defensive companies are likely to fare
better next year if global growth decelerates, valuations for
the groups have gotten too expensive, leaving few attractive
names in equities, according to  Peter Sorrentino , a senior fund
manager at Huntington Asset Advisors in Cincinnati.  “It’s tough to get terribly excited about any group,”
Sorrentino, who helps oversee $14.5 billion in assets, said in a
telephone interview on Dec. 23. “We’re not pounding the table
that defensives are a compelling area right now. We’ve seen some
significant sell-offs in the more cyclical areas,” he said.
“It’s tough to ferret out something that can deliver some
positive alpha to a portfolio.”  Buying Opportunities  High valuations for foodmakers, drug companies and
utilities proved to be buying opportunities for the S&P 500 and
companies most tied to the economy during the past decade.
 Price-earnings ratios (S5CONS)  for staples, health-care and utility
stocks rose as much as 13 percent above the S&P 500 in 2001,
before the full index rallied 13 percent starting in September.
Cyclical groups, including commodity producers and retailers,
increased 19 percent in the same period.  The spread reached 16 percent in March 2007 before the
index jumped 13 percent to a record and cyclical stocks climbed
an average 16 percent. In November 2008, defensive stocks were
7.1 percent more expensive than the rest of the market. That was
four months before global stocks bottomed and the S&P 500
doubled, sending shares of cyclical companies up 135 percent.  Profits among defensive stocks are forecast to increase 3.8
percent in 2012, according to more than 7,000 analyst estimates
compiled by Bloomberg. Earnings are poised to climb 18 percent
for banks and 11 percent for mining and chemical companies.  Gain Momentum  Economists predict the  U.S. economy  will gain momentum in
2012 after slowing to a 1.8 percent annual rate this year from 3
percent last year, as the unemployment rate fell to the lowest
level in more than two years. Gross domestic product will expand
2.1 percent in 2012, according to the median estimate of
economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  Investors sought havens in companies such as Biogen, the
world’s largest producer of multiple sclerosis medicines. The
Weston, Massachusetts-based drugmaker’s return adjusted for risk
was 17 times the S&P 500’s in 2011, as success with experimental
drugs shielded its shares. Biogen surged 65 percent this year,
the fifth-biggest gain in the benchmark equity index.  Hershey’s return taking price swings into account was 15
times the S&P 500’s, as cocoa prices posted the longest string
of losses in five decades earlier this month. The risk-adjusted
return for Richmond, Virginia-based  Altria Group Inc. (MO) , the
largest tobacco seller in the U.S., was 15 times the S&P 500’s.  Utility Investments  Valentijn van Nieuwenhuijzen, who helps oversee $163
billion as head of tactical asset allocation at ING Investment
Management in The Hague, has reduced investments in utilities
and holds more shares in energy and technology companies than
are represented in indexes. He is keeping a “neutral” balance
between both groups, he said.  “The relative valuation between sectors has moved more
extreme,” van Nieuwenhuijzen said in a Dec. 20 telephone
interview. “We see big support from valuation both on equities
themselves and for cyclical sectors.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
