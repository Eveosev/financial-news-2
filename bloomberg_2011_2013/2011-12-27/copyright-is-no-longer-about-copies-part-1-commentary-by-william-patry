Hollywood’s best box office years
ever were 2009 and 2010. Net revenue from book sales was up 5.6
percent in 2010 from 2008. And sales of e-books, in particular,
grew 1,274 percent in those two years.  In the  music industry , while the decline in sales of
physical recorded music continued, the global performance-rights
market share increased an impressive 13 percent in 2010 over
2009. Even musical instrument sales increased 8 percent over
2009.  Yet, the widespread perception among copyright owners is
that legitimate markets are shrinking, and that copyright laws
are failing to stem their losses.  Failure can be judged only in relation to what we want our
copyright laws to do. Most often, defenders of these laws say
they should give authors the financial incentive to create works
and give the public access to cultural works. Copyright laws
should also enable creators to prevent their works from
appearing in contexts they don’t approve of.  But copyright law cannot accomplish all three of these
objectives at the same time without conflict. There are, to
begin, conflicts between authors and distributors over royalty
payments and distribution rights. There are conflicts among
authors: Some established ones favor extensive rights and resist
new technologies that challenge their control over their works
(think of Metallica and Prince), while most emerging artists
tend to favor the ability to copy from established artists and
explore new technologies in order to get their works before an
audience.  A Powerful Story  Then there are conflicts between the public and authors
over availability of works, pricing and the scope of rights. One
example is the 2009 dust-up over Amazon.com’s text-to-speech
feature for the Kindle 2, which allowed buyers of books to have
computerized voices read the text. This was of tremendous
benefit to the blind and in no way competed with authorized
audio books, which are read by performance artists. Yet the
Authors Guild of America objected, Amazon bowed to the pressure,
and no one benefited.  Copyright laws can, in fact, serve valuable purposes: They
can ensure that once works are created, their authors are able
to protect them and benefit from them economically. But
copyright laws rarely cause people to create things they
otherwise wouldn’t have. Nor are copyright laws responsible for
either commercial or critical success. The benefits from
ownership of copy rights have always flowed disproportionately
to gatekeepers who are interested in artificial scarcity and
monopoly profits, rather than abundance and diversity.  Why do so many think copyright laws directly lead to more
works and more money in authors’ pockets? Because the copyright
industries -- which are after all in the storytelling business -
- have constructed a very powerful story, complete with heroes
and bad guys, that policy makers want to believe. In this story,
the villains are file sharers and Internet companies out to
destroy the American (or fill in any other country’s) way of
life. And like Superman, legislators can swoop in and pass
stronger copyright laws to put the bad guys in jail. The sun
will come out; there will be milk and honey in the land again.
That’s a great story, but it doesn’t match today’s reality.  Today, owning copies of works is no longer the principal
goal of most consumers. More and more, people have works
streamed to them. So selling ownership of copies of works should
no longer be the principal business model for the copyright
industries.  We are now in a world of digital abundance, where one copy
of a work is as good as the next, and there is no longer any
need for a single, authorized gatekeeper. Copies can be made and
distributed globally at no extra cost, so creators can reach
vast audiences directly -- without a big cut of the financial
rewards going to gatekeepers. To make money in the world of
digital abundance, you just have to sell more copies for lower
prices.  Pricing Is Critical  Yet copyright policy makers often fail to appreciate that
the underlying issue today is pricing, not technology.
Technology is not the enemy but simply the means by which market
expectations are created and satisfied.  Young people (the prime audience for the core copyright
industries) have never lived in the world of artificial analog
scarcity and are voracious, intuitive consumers of every new
technology. For the copyright industries (often headed by people
in older generations) to ignore the digital DNA of their
principal consumers is suicide. Copyright content businesses
that don’t respond to consumer demand should not expect to stay
in business, and most assuredly, no government should help them
do so.  Copyright laws should not act to shore up outdated business
models against the tide of new technologies. Francis Gurry,
director general of the  World Intellectual Property
Organization , has rightly argued that successful copyright
policy has to be based on neutrality, and it should not
“preserve business models established under obsolete or
moribund technologies.”  The technological changes at hand are even more profound
than a mere switch from analog to digital. Today, ordinary
people, using the Internet and digital applications, are
unwittingly engaging in major copying endeavors. It makes no
sense to have laws that consider this copying to be
infringement.  We are fast approaching an era when there will be copyright
laws without copies in the traditional sense of the word.
Consumers have shown a growing preference for works to be
streamed to them, rather than buying physical media like DVDs or
CDs. Accessing works stored in the cloud (on someone else’s
computer servers) is now a significant business model, and will
probably be the dominant one in many areas. That enables
copyright owners to reach much larger audiences, with
significantly reduced costs of production and distribution.  Maintaining Scarcity  Yet, our copyright laws pose significant threats to these
developments. Incumbent gatekeepers do not like making the
transition away from the physical, because it eliminates their
traditional ability to create artificial scarcity and thereby
receive monopoly profits. In an effort to maintain scarcity in
the digital environment, copyright owners have obtained new
rights that give them the power over technologies developed by
third parties.  How? Through the use of “digital locks” -- software code
inserted into a CD, DVD or other consumer products to restrict
consumer access. The  1998 U.S. Digital Millennium Copyright Act 
and similar laws in other countries made it both a civil and
criminal offense to circumvent -- or “hack” -- such locks.  Here’s how it works, for example, with DVDs: In order to
sell players that would show the DVDs Hollywood sold to
consumers, electronics manufacturers had to build into their
machines a key that, when matched to a key in the DVD, allowed
the images to play in the correct order. Without the key,
viewers got an unwatchable visual mess. The manufacturers were
quite capable of simply breaking the algorithmic key, but the
law did not allow it.  That’s not the only way in which the new copyright laws
place the public in a worse position in the digital world than
in the analog world. A venerable principle of copyright law is
the first-sale doctrine: Once a lawful copy of a book or other
work is sold or given away, the owner of that copy can turn
around and resell it or give it away without permission or
payment. That’s why we can have second-hand bookstores. But if
the transaction is considered a license, as with e-books, then
the first-sale doctrine doesn’t apply, as thousands of startled
Amazon.com purchasers found out when their copies of  George Orwell ’s “1984” were remotely removed from their Kindles by
Amazon, after Amazon determined that its source wasn’t
authorized.  Digital locks can be used not just with individual
consumers, but also with libraries. Last March, HarperCollins
stunned the library world by announcing that a license to lend
its e-books will expire after 26 loans.  The Digital Millennium Copyright Act is a prime example of
our march backward, of how our laws are used to thwart
innovation and creativity. It’s the reason you can’t load
lawfully purchased copies of your DVDs into your iPod, why you
can’t transfer copies of many lawfully purchased works from one
electronic device to another, why DVDs bought in one country may
not work in another. (This is something that should have greatly
embarrassed President  Barack Obama  when he gave then-U.K. Prime
Minister  Gordon Brown  a set of DVDs of American movies, which
couldn’t be lawfully played on Brown’s player.) Under this law,
both consumers and technology are treated as the enemy.  (William Patry, senior copyright counsel at Google Inc., is
