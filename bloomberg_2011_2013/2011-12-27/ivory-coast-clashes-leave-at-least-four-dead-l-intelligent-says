At least four people were killed in
 Ivory Coast  yesterday in clashes between civilians and the
nation’s army, known as the Republican Forces,  l’Intelligent
d’Abidjan  reported, without citing anyone.  An unspecified number of people were injured and shops were
looted in the violence in Sikensi, about 100 kilometers (62
miles) north of Abidjan, the commercial capital, the newspaper
reported.  Last week, Prime Minister  Guillaume Soro  began talks with
senior military leaders after similar clashes left six civilians
dead. The Republican Forces include former rebels loyal to
President Alassane Ouattara, who fought troops that supported
ex-leader Laurent Gbagbo in a five-month crisis sparked by a
disputed November 2010 presidential election. As many as 3,000
people were killed in the fighting, according to the
 International Criminal Court .  To contact the reporter on this story:
