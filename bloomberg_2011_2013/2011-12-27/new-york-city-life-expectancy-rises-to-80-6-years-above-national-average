The  life expectancy  of a New York
City baby born in 2009 is 80.6 years, three years higher than in
2000 and above the national rate of 78.2 years, Mayor  Michael
Bloomberg  said today.  The mayor cited the cityâ€™s health interventions, including
its anti-smoking campaign and expanded testing and treatment for
the HIV virus. Bloomberg released the figures today in joint
statement with Deputy Mayor Linda Gibbs and Health Commissioner
Thomas Farley.  The life expectancy for 40-year-olds in New York increased
by two-and-a-half years to 82 from 2000 to 2009, the mayor said.
The gain was greater than the 1.2-year increase for the same age
group in the U.S. as a whole.  The mayor is the founder and majority owner of Bloomberg
News parent Bloomberg LP.  To contact the reporter on this story:
