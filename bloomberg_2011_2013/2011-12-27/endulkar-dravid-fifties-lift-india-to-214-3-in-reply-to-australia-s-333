Sachin Tendulkar ,  Rahul Dravid  and
Virender Sehwag hit half-centuries as India reached 214-3 to
trail Australia by 119 runs in their series-opening cricket Test
in Melbourne.  Dravid finished day two 68 not out after Peter Siddle
bowled Tendulkar for 73 in the fourth ball before stumps,
leaving Tendulkar on 99 centuries in international cricket.
Siddle earlier dismissed Dravid when he was on 65, though the
batsman survived because of a no-ball.  Sehwag made 67 from 83 balls before edging a James
Pattinson delivery onto the stumps. Ben Hilfenhaus got the other
wicket for Australia, which earlier added 56 runs after resuming
at 277-6, when Gautam Gambhir edged a catch behind to
wicketkeeper  Brad Haddin .  The teams are scheduled to play four Tests with matches in
Sydney, Perth and Adelaide to follow. India, seeking its
first Test series victory in Australia since it first began
touring there in 1947, holds the Border-Gavaskar Trophy after
winning the last two series at home.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
