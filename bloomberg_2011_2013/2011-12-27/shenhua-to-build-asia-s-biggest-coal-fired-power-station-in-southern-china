Shenhua Group Corp. plans to build
Asia’s biggest coal-fired power plant in  China ’s southern
province of Guangxi to help reduce electricity shortages in the
region, the official Xinhua News Agency reported.  The parent of Hong Kong-listed  China Shenhua Energy Co. (1088) 
signed an agreement with the local government to build an 8-
gigawatt plant at the port city of Beihai, Xinhua said in the
report today, without citing anyone. Construction will take
about five years, it said.  China, the world’s biggest polluter, relies on coal to
generate about 80 percent of its electricity. The plan to build
the thermal station in Guangxi comes after the province suffered
power shortages in recent years because drought reduced supply
from hydroelectric plants.  The coastal province has deep ports that will allow ships
to deliver coal to the plant, Xinhua reported, citing Shenhua
Chairman Zhang Xiwu. Guangxi will need to build docks to receive
coal delivered from Shenhua’s mines in Indonesia and  Australia ,
Xinhua said, citing Zhang.  Shenhua is China’s biggest coal producer.  China, the fastest-growing major economy, produces more
greenhouse gases blamed for global warming than any other
nation. The government wants to cut carbon dioxide emissions by
as much as 17 percent per unit of gross domestic product in the
five years through 2015, Premier  Wen Jiabao  said Feb. 27.  To contact the reporter on this story:
