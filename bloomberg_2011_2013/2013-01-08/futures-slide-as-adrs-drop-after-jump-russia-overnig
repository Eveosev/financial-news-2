Russian  stock futures  fell and
equities traded in New York declined, led by OAO  Mechel (MTL)  and  OAO
RusHydro (RSHYY) , after a five-week rally pushed company valuations to
the most expensive level since September.  Futures expiring in March on Moscow’s RTS Index slid 0.3
percent in U.S. hours to 157,120. The  Bloomberg Russia-US Equity
Index (RUS14BN)  of the most-traded Russian stocks listed in New York
retreated for a second day, losing 1.2 percent to 100.09, the
steepest slump in more than two weeks. Companies on the gauge,
which  includes  American depositary receipts of OAO Gazprom and
OAO Sberbank, traded for an  average  6.25 times estimated
earnings Jan. 4, the most expensive level since Sept. 14.  Russian stocks and ADRs in New York have  rallied  in 2013 as
oil, the nation’s biggest export earner, rose 1.5 percent and as
the deal to avert U.S. spending cuts and tax increases steadied
the outlook for the world’s biggest crude consumer. Oil ended
yesterday down less than 0.1 percent, and the  Standard & Poor’s
500 Index (SPX)  slipped 0.3 percent to the lowest level this year.  “ Russia  is part of this risk-on, risk-off dynamic that’s
affecting the whole world at the moment,” Ian Hague, a founding
partner at Firebird Management LLC, which manages $1.3 billion,
including investments in Russian equities, said by phone in New
York yesterday. “Oil demand is not particularly robust because
we’re still in a period of subdued economic growth.”  Extended Ruble  Russian markets resumed trading for 2013 yesterday after a
six-day holiday, with the 50-stock, ruble-denominated  Micex
Index (INDEXCF)  adding 2.7 percent to 1,514.82. The Micex traded down 0.1
percent at 1,513.35 as of 12:10 p.m. in Moscow today.  The  Market Vectors Russia ETF (RSX) , the largest exchange-traded
fund dedicated to Russian stocks, retreated 1 percent to $29.85
in New York, the lowest level since Dec. 28. The RTS Volatility
Index, which measures expected swings in equity futures, rose
3.1 percent to 22.49 points.  The ruble had its first extended trading session yesterday,
rallying the most since September against the central bank’s
dollar-euro basket. The currency ended yesterday 0.6 percent
stronger versus the dollar, up 1.5 percent against the euro and
1.1 percent higher versus the  basket , which is used by policy
makers to shepherd movements in the ruble.  President  Vladimir Putin  signaled last quarter that ruble-
denominated  government bonds  known as OFZs would be made
accessible to foreign investors for direct settlement in 2013.
Euroclear SA, owner of a global bond settlement system, opened
an account with Russia’s National Settlement Depositary Dec. 27
and is waiting for clearance from the market watchdog for the
account to become active, Stephan Pouyat, the bank’s head of
product management global reach, said by e-mail Jan. 4.  ‘Ongoing Inflows’  The opening up of the domestic sovereign  debt market 
“should mean ongoing inflows and increasing investor
participation from abroad,”  Nick Chamie , global head of
emerging-markets and currency strategy at Royal Bank of Canada,
said by phone from Toronto yesterday.  Futures contracts expiring in March on the ruble showed the
currency weakening 0.1 percent to 30.63 per dollar in New York
trading hours yesterday.  ADRs of  Mechel (MTLR) , Russia’s biggest producer of steelmaking
coal, tumbled 4.6 percent to $7.06 yesterday in New York, the
biggest one-day decline since Nov. 7. The ADRs rose in 2013 to
trade at the biggest  premium  to Mechel’s Micex-listed stock in
three years Jan. 7, with Russian markets closed Dec. 31 to Jan.
7 for New Year holidays.  Mechel surged 7.1 percent yesterday in Moscow to 218.9
rubles, or the equivalent of $7.22, and traded at a 2.2 percent
premium to the ADRs. One depositary receipt is equal to one
share.  Norilsk Jumps  RusHydro, Russia’s state-run hydroelectricity producer,
lost 4 percent to $2.42 in New York, also the biggest slump
since Nov. 7. The Moscow-based company’s  shares  on the Micex
added 0.9 percent, the most since in three weeks, to 74 kopeks,
or 2.4 U.S. cents.  OAO GMK Norilsk Nickel (NILSY) , the world’s largest nickel and
palladium producer, gained 1.1 percent to $19.05 in New York,
the biggest advance in almost a week. Norilsk’s shares in Moscow
added 2.5 percent to 5,744 rubles, or $189.52, the highest
closing price since March 19.  Demand for palladium, last quarter’s best performing
precious metal, is exceeding supply for a second consecutive
year as mine production stagnates while sales by automakers, the
biggest buyers, reach record highs, according to estimates from
Barclays Plc.  VimpelCom Ltd. (VIP) , Russia’s third-biggest mobile phone
provider, sank 3.7 percent to $10.57 yesterday in the U.S. for
the steepest one-day slump since Oct. 23.  Brent oil for February settlement added 0.5 percent to
$111.94 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange
yesterday, while Urals crude, Russia’s chief export blend,
gained 0.5 percent to $110.65 a barrel.  United Co. Rusal, the world’s largest aluminum producer,
rose 0.6 percent to HK$5.02 in Hong Kong trading as of 10:53
a.m. local time. The MSCI Asia Pacific Index gained 0.3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
