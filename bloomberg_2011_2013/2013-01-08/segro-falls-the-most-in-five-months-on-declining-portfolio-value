Segro Plc (SGRO) , the U.K.’s largest owner
of industrial properties, fell the most in more than five months
after the value of its portfolio decreased in the second half of
last year.  The shares dropped as much as 3.9 percent in  London 
trading, the most since Aug. 1. Segro’s real estate portfolio
fell by around 180 million pounds ($290 million), led by a 75
million-pound reduction for offices based in the U.K.’s
Southeast, the London-based company said in a statement today.  The revaluation “reduces the expected Dec. 2012 net asset
value to 295 pence,” Kate Barlow, a Peel Hunt Research analyst,
said in a research note. That’s 4 percent less than the 307
pence analyst consensus, she said.  The value of Segro’s offices in Pegasus Park,  Belgium , and
Vimercate, Italy, fell by 50 million pounds, while the remaining
25 million pounds decline came from undisclosed assets, the
statement said. The company’s shares were down 2.3 percent, or
5.7 pence, at 245.6 pence as of 9:38 a.m., giving the company a
market value 1.82 billion pounds.  To contact the reporters on this story:
