The Australian and New Zealand
dollars gained versus the majority of their most-traded
counterparts as commodities rose for a second day.  The South Pacific currencies were little changed against
the  U.S. dollar  as stocks declined. Iron, Australia’s biggest
export in dollar terms, climbed.  The Aussie dollar was little changed at $1.0504 yesterday
in New York trading. It rose 0.3 percent to A$1.2454 per euro
and dropped 0.9 percent to 91.43 yen.  New Zealand’s dollar, nicknamed the kiwi, was little
changed at 83.66 U.S. cents. It rose 0.2 percent to NZ$1.5637
per euro and slid 0.9 percent to 72.83 yen.  Standard & Poor’s GSCI Index of 24 raw materials rose as
much as 0.6 percent before paring the gain to 0.2 percent. Iron-
ore swaps advanced to the highest level in 14 months as  China ’s
accelerating economy boosted demand. January contracts gained
1.3 percent to $152 a dry metric ton, the highest since October
2011, according to GFI Group Inc.  China is Australia’s biggest trade partner and New
Zealand’s second-largest export market.  The  S&P 500 Index  fell as much as 0.7 percent before
trimming losses to 0.3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
