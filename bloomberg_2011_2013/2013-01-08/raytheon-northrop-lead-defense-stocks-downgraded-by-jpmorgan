JPMorgan downgraded  Northrop Grumman
Corp. (NOC) ,  Raytheon (RTN)  Co. and Harris Corp., three companies that were
among the best defense investments in 2012.  “Following a year in which the group as a whole performed
surprisingly well, we are downgrading some of the top
performers,” analyst Joseph Nadol wrote today in a note to
clients.  Nadol cut Raytheon, the largest missile supplier to the
U.S. Defense Department, to neutral from overweight. The
Waltham, Massachusetts-based company returned 23 percent in 2012
including dividend payments. Raytheon shares fell 1.1 percent to
close at $57.74 in New York.  Northrop Grumman, maker of Global Hawk drones, was revised
to underweight from neutral. The  Falls Church , Virginia-based
defense contractor returned 20 percent last year. Its shares
declined 1.9 percent to $67.34.  Harris (HRS) , a maker of communications equipment, was cut to
underweight from neutral. The Melbourne, Florida-based company
returned 40 percent last year. Harris shares fell 2.3 percent,
the biggest decline in more than two months, to close at $48.91.  Defense contractors face automatic Pentagon cuts totaling
about $45 billion this year unless the White House and lawmakers
agree by March 1 to an alternate deficit reduction plan.  “We believe that Republicans as a group put a higher
priority on spending cuts than they do on preserving the  defense
budget ,” raising the risk no deal will be reached before the
deadline, Nadol wrote in a separate note to clients today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
