Canadian heavy crude strengthened for
the first time in a week, rebounding after a selloff early this
year provoked by concern that growing production in western
 Canada  would overwhelm pipeline capacity.  Western Canada Select, a heavy blend mainly produced from
oil-sands bitumen, rose $1.60 a barrel to $36.25 below U.S.
benchmark West  Texas  Intermediate, according to Net Energy Inc.,
a Calgary oil broker.  The discounted price of WCS has grown from $30.50 below WTI
on the first day of trading this year, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Concern about limited pipeline space out
of Alberta has kept the price of the grade under pressure.  Several pipelines carrying Canadian crude to the U.S. are
full, including parts of Canada’s largest export system,
 Enbridge Inc. (ENB) ’s 2.5 million-barrel-a-day mainline.  Enbridge’s Lines 6A and 62 are overbooked by 10 percent
this month, and demand on Line 5 is 12 percent above capacity,
according to a company statement. Lines 6A and 62 can carry up
to 739,000 barrels a day, and Line 5 can ship as much as 491,200
barrels a day, according to Enbridge’s  website .  A new heavy-oil project,  Imperial Oil Ltd. (IMO) ’s 110,000-
barrel-a-day Kearl mine in  Alberta , is expected to begin
production early this year, meaning more supply will have to
travel through limited pipeline space.  Canada Exports  Canada exported 2.3 million barrels of oil a day during the
third quarter of 2012, up 4.5 percent from the same period a
year earlier, according to the National Energy Board.  Crude oils produced in another region suffering from
limited pipeline capacity, western Texas, weakened. West Texas
Sour declined $1.30 a barrel to a $17.50 discount, while West
Texas Intermediate oil delivered in Midland, Texas, slid 75
cents to $12.75 a barrel below the same grade priced at the U.S.
oil supply hub in Cushing,  Oklahoma .  A glut of supply from shale oil production has overwhelmed
pipeline capacity out of western Texas, causing crude prices
there to fall rapidly on any disruptions to local demand. On
Nov. 20, WTI Midland fell to $20 below Cushing.  Offshore Gulf of  Mexico  crudes strengthened as the  spread 
between WTI and Brent, the global overseas oil benchmark,
widened by 62 cents to $18.83 a barrel at 4:42 p.m.  New York 
time. As Brent’s premium increases, the price of offshore crudes
that compete with overseas imports also tends to rise.  Light Louisiana Sweet gained 25 cents and Heavy Louisiana
Sweet gained 30 cents to trade at $17.85 a barrel each over WTI
in Cushing. Mars Blend gained 45 cents to a $13.40 premium.  To contact the reporter on this story:
