U.S. gasoline demand slid last week
to the lowest level since  MasterCard Inc. (MA)  began tracking
consumption in July 2004.  Drivers bought 7.82 million barrels a day of gasoline in
the week ended Jan. 4, down 3.5 percent from 8.1 million in the
prior period, MasterCard’s SpendingPulse report showed. The
decline follows a drop of 9.5 percent in the seven days ended
Dec. 28.  The average for the four weeks ended Jan. 4 was 2.9 percent
below a year earlier. It has been down from the previous year
every week except one since March 18, 2011. Demand in 2012 was
3.6 percent below 2011.  The average pump price rose 3 cents in the past week to
$3.30 a gallon. Drivers are paying 0.9 percent less than a year
earlier.  The report from Purchase, New York-based MasterCard is
assembled by MasterCard Advisors, the company’s consulting arm.
The information is based on credit-card swipes and cash and
check payments at about 140,000 U.S. gasoline stations.  Visa Inc. (V)  is the biggest payments network company by
transactions processed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
