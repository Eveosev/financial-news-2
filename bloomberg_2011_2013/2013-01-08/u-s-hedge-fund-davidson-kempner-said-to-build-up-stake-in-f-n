Davidson Kempner  Capital Management
LLC, a $19 billion U.S. hedge fund manager, has been building up
a stake in  Fraser & Neave Ltd. (FNN) , the Singapore property and soft
drinks company at the center of rival takeover bids, said a
person with knowledge of the matter.  Davidson Kempner, based in New York, has accumulated just
under 5 percent of Fraser & Neave, said the person, who declined
to be identified as the information is private.  Reuters reported Davidson Kempner’s Fraser & Neave holding
earlier today. Robert Siegfried, an outside spokesman at Kekst &
Co. retained by Davidson Kempner, didn’t reply to an e-mail or
answer his office telephone outside of business hours today.  Thailand’s richest man  Charoen Sirivadhanabhakdi  agreed to
buy a 22 percent stake in Fraser & Neave in July, setting off a
fight for the company’s soft drink and property assets, and
prompting the sale of its beer unit to Heineken NV.  Overseas Union Enterprise Ltd. (OUE) , a Singapore-based property
company, has enlisted Kirin Holdings Co., Japan’s largest drinks
maker, in its rival bid in which OUE would get Fraser & Neave’s
property assets and Kirin the food and beverage unit.  OUE extended its S$13.1 billion ($10.7 billion), or S$9.08
per share, offer for Fraser & Neave to Jan. 14, according to a
stock exchange statement on Jan. 3. Charoen’s TCC Assets earlier
delayed the closing of its S$8.88 per share offer to Jan. 10.  To contact the reporter on this story:
