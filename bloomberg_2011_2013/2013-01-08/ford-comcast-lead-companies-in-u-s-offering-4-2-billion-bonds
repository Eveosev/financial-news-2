Bank of America Corp. (BAC) , the second-
biggest U.S. lender by assets, and automaker  Ford Motor Co. (F)  led
companies in the U.S. selling about $15 billion of bonds in the
busiest day in more than seven weeks.  Bank of America sold $6 billion of debt in three parts, the
largest dollar offering in about a month, and Ford issued $1.25
billion of five-year notes, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The sales are the most since  $18.3 billion  on Nov. 14
and compare with a 2012 daily average of $6.4 billion.  Issuance is rising after President  Barack Obama  and
lawmakers struck a deal last week that averted the so-called
fiscal cliff of income-tax increases on most Americans and
delayed automatic spending cuts until March 1. The 10-year
Treasury yield has increased 10 basis points since Dec. 31 to
 1.86 percent  today, spurring issuers to lock in borrowing costs
while they hover near record lows, according to Timothy Cox at
Mizuho Securities USA Inc.  Corporate treasurers “say, ‘I can’t afford to wait,’ ”
Cox, the New York-based executive director of debt capital
markets, said in a telephone interview. “The market is pristine
and there’s a window of issuance, which could be over the next
two months before the next cliff discussions come into play.”  Ford Offering  Bank of America Corp.  sold $1 billion of 1.25 percent,
three-year notes to yield 95 basis points more than similar-
maturity Treasuries, $2 billion of 2 percent, five-year
securities at a relative yield of 125 basis points and $3
billion of 3.3 percent, 10-year notes at 150 basis points,
Bloomberg data show. The sale is the largest in the U.S. since
 Intel Corp . issued $6 billion of bonds on Dec. 4.  Ford’s financing unit issued debt after its parent company
raised $2 billion of 4.75 percent, 30-year securities last week,
Bloomberg data show. The new 2.375 percent bonds priced with a
spread of 168 basis points.  Comcast Corp. (CMCSA)  offered $750 million of 2.85 percent, 10-year
debt, $1.7 billion of 4.25 percent, 20-year securities and $500
million of 4.5 percent, 30-year debentures, Bloomberg data show.
Little Rock, Arkansas-based  Windstream Corp. (WIN)  sold $700 million
of 6.375 percent, 10.5-year bonds to fund a tender offer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
