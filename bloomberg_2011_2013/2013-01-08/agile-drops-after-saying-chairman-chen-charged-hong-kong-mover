Agile Property Holdings Ltd. (3383) , a
Chinese developer, had its biggest drop in more than a year in
Hong Kong trading, after saying Chairman Chen Zhuo Lin was
formally charged with indecent assault.  The arrest is unrelated to the business of the group and
will not affect operations, the developer said in a statement to
the Hong Kong stock exchange today. The company, based in the
southern Chinese city of Guangzhou, will make a further
announcement when appropriate, according to the statement.  Chen was arrested by police in Hong Kong in August in
connection with an allegation of indecent assault and now faces
two counts, according to Agile. The company will have
to name a “major decision-maker,” and clarify its business
plans if Chen ceases to be the chairman, said Danielle Wang, an
analyst at DBS Vickers  Hong Kong .  “Agile’s share price will be under short-term pressure,”
said Wang, who maintained her “hold” rating on Agile. “The
stock is fairly valued in the long term.”  Agile dropped as much as 7.4 percent to HK$11.74, and
traded at HK$11.78 as of 2:32 p.m. local time. The stock is
headed for its biggest drop since Nov. 10, 2011.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
