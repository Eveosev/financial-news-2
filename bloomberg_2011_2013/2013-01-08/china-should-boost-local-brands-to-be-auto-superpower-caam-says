China  should strive to become an
“automotive superpower” to maintain  economic growth , by
increasing investment in research and encouraging official use
of local brands, the head of the nation’s carmakers group said.  The country’s automakers spend less than 2 percent of
revenue on research and product development, or about half the
global average, Dong Yang, secretary-general of China
Association of Automobile Manufacturers, said on his blog
yesterday. The government should offer incentives to encourage
research and adopt local brands for official use, he said.  China’s brands are losing share to offerings from carmakers
such as  General Motors Co. (GM) ,  Volkswagen AG (VOW)  and Hyundai Motor Co.
which count the world’s most populous nation as their biggest
market. Industrywide deliveries expanded 4 percent last year,
even amid concerns about excess inventory, overcapacity and
unhealthy price competition, Dong said.  “China should pursue a strategy of turning itself into an
automotive superpower,” Dong wrote in his blog on Sina.com.
“The auto industry has become an important pillar of the
Chinese economy and is crucial to maintaining stable and
relatively fast growth.”  Local automakers’ combined share of  sales  in China fell 1
percentage point in the first 11 months of last year to 41.3
percent, as German brands gained ground by 2.4 percentage
points, according to CAAM data.  CAAM is scheduled to hold a briefing on Jan. 11 to release
2012 data and its forecast for demand in 2013.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
