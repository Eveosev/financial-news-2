Australia ’s dollar snapped a three-
day gain after government data showed the nation’s retail sales
unexpectedly declined.  The country’s bonds advanced amid speculation the  Reserve
Bank  of Australia will cut  interest rates  by March to support
the economy. New Zealand’s dollar rose against all its major
counterparts after data showed building approvals for detached
houses surged to the highest in more than two years.  “The Aussie is struggling to rise,” said  Satoshi Okagawa ,
a senior global markets analyst in Singapore at Sumitomo Mitsui
Banking Corp., a unit of Japan’s second-biggest financial group
by market value. “I can’t see an immediate pickup in corporate
confidence or retail sales.”  The Aussie was unchanged at $1.0503 as of 4:55 p.m. in
Sydney after rising 0.4 percent in the past three days through
yesterday. New Zealand’s currency climbed 0.2 percent to
NZ$1.2524 per Australian dollar and rose 0.2 percent to 83.86
U.S. cents.  Australian retail sales fell 0.1 percent in November from
the prior month, the Bureau of Statistics said today, while
economists estimated a 0.3 percent increase. Job vacancies
dropped 6.9 percent the same month, a separate report showed.  The  yield  on Australia’s three-year note slid four basis
points to 2.8 percent.  New Zealand ’s two-year swap rate was
little changed at 2.75 percent.  Traders see a 60 percent likelihood that the RBA will cut
its benchmark rate to 2.75 percent or lower by March, according
to overnight index swaps data compiled by Bloomberg. The key
rate currently stands at 3 percent.  N.Z. Dollar  Permits in New Zealand for dwellings excluding apartments
rose 4.6 percent in November to 1,382, the most since May 2010,
the country’s statistics office said.  “There seem to be higher expectations for New Zealand than
Australia in terms of the resilience of their economies,” said
Takuya Kawabata, an analyst at Gaitame.com Research Institute
Ltd. in  Tokyo , a unit of Japan’s largest currency margin
company.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  of shares gained 0.4 percent,
bolstering demand for higher-yielding assets.  Australia’s dollar added 0.5 percent to 91.92 yen, while
its New Zealand counterpart jumped 0.8 percent to 73.38 yen.  To contact the reporter on this story:
