Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)  Chief Executive
Officer  Steve Ballmer , in a surprise appearance at a technology
trade show in Las Vegas, said the number of applications for new
Windows tablets has increased fivefold since late October.  There are four times more applications for Windows RT
computers now than there were when the device was introduced in
late October, Ballmer said yesterday at the International
Consumer Electronics Show. He said that more apps -- including
Twitter Inc., Dropbox Inc. and  Time Warner Inc. (TWX) ’s CNN -- are
coming.  Ballmer is striving to drum up interest in the latest
flavor of Microsoft’s flagship operating system while he plays
catch-up to Apple Inc. in the $63.2 billion market for tablets.
Early demand for some Windows tablets has appeared
“disappointing,” according to analysts at FBR Capital Markets.  The availability of a broad range of apps is crucial for
luring customers to mobile devices such as tablets. In December
alone, the number of new apps reached 10,000, Ballmer said.
Among them: Expedia Inc., Fitbit Inc. and AOL Inc.’s Huffington
Post.  Microsoft said in late 2011 that Ballmer’s address at the
2012 CES would be the company’s last keynote. He appeared
yesterday during a presentation by  Qualcomm Inc. (QCOM)  CEO  Paul Jacobs .  Microsoft sold five times more Windows Phone devices during
the week of Christmas than the same period a year earlier,
Ballmer said. He didn’t give specific numbers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
