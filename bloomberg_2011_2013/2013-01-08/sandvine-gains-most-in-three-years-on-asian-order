Sandvine Corp. (SVC) , which sells Internet
network management tools, jumped the most in more than three
years after receiving about $6.5 million in follow-on orders
from an Asian service provider.  Sandvine  soared  as much as 18 percent to C$1.63, the
highest since April 2009, and was up 8.7 percent to C$1.50 at
11:33 a.m. in Toronto. A close at that level would be the
highest since June 5.  “This is a multi-phase project and the deployment has
proceeded as expected,”   Tom Donnelly , chief operations officer
of sales and global services at Waterloo, Ontario-based
Sandvine, said in a statement. “We are just beginning the
second phase.”  The company said it first announced initial orders from the
customer, a “top five” communications service provider in
Asia, in May 2012.  Since that time, Sandvine has announced orders from Asian
operators worth about $20 million, Donnelly said. The company
has customers in Japan, Australia,  Hong Kong , Singapore and
Indonesia, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
