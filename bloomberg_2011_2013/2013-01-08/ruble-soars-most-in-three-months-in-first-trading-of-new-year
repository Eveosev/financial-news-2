The ruble strengthened against the
dollar and the euro in the first trading day of 2013, catching
up with gains in emerging-market assets.  Russia ’s currency appreciated 0.6 percent to 30.2120 per
dollar by the 11:30 p.m. close of trading in Moscow. It was the
steepest one-day rally since Dec. 27. The ruble jumped 1.5
percent against the euro to 39.6635, leaving it 1.1 percent
stronger at 34.4652 versus the  dollar-euro basket  used by the
central bank to manage the currency.  Global stocks and commodities rallied at the start of the
year after U.S. lawmakers agreed to a deal to avert automatic
spending cuts and tax increases that would have hobbled the
world’s largest economy. Crude, Russia’s biggest export earner,
rose for a third day in  New York , adding 0.1 percent to $93.27 a
barrel. Today was the first day of extended ruble trading hours
on Russia’s Moscow Exchange.  “The Russian currency is just catching up with the wider
market rally we have seen in recent weeks,” Tim Ash, a London-
based strategist at Standard Bank Group Ltd., said by e-mail
today.  The ruble will probably strengthen beyond 30 per dollar
this week from the 30.4075 level reached at the close of Russian
markets Dec. 28, according to Adam Myers, European head of
foreign-exchange strategy at  Credit Agricole SA (ACA)  in London.  Futures due in March showed the ruble weakening 0.1 percent
to 30.627 per dollar.  Yields on Russia’s ruble-denominated government debt due in
July 2022 rose 14 basis points to 6.99 percent. The Micex Index
of stocks climbed 2.7 percent to 1,514.82, before slipping 0.2
percent to 1,511.86 in the evening trading session.  The extra yield investors demand to own Russia’s dollar
bonds over U.S. Treasuries rose two basis points,or 0.02
percentage point, to 147 basis points, according to JPMorgan
Chase & Co.’s EMBI Global Index. An index of five-year
government bond yields rose four basis points to 6.5508 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
