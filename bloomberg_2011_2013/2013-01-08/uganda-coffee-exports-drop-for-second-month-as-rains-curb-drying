Coffee exports from  Uganda , Africa’s
biggest shipper of the beans, fell for a second month in
December from a year earlier after rains affected ripening and
drying of the crop, the coffee authority said.  Shipments declined to 240,403 60-kilogram (132-pound) bags
from 241,981 bags a year earlier, the Uganda Coffee Development
Authority said yesterday by e-mail from Kampala, the capital.  While exports were lower than an earlier forecast of
250,000 bags, they surpassed 223,401 bags recorded the previous
month because of a bigger crop, the authority said.  “Rains last month hampered the ripening and drying of
coffee and impacted negatively on exports,” David Muwonge, the
deputy executive director of the Kampala-based National Union of
Coffee Agribusiness and Farm Enterprises, said by phone.  The European Union, U.S.,  Sudan ,  Switzerland , India and
Russia are the major importers of Ugandan beans, according to
the authority.  Uganda’s coffee exports in the first three months of the
2012-13 season dropped to 641,828 bags from 684,443 bags a year
earlier, according to a tally of the authority figures by
 Bloomberg News .  The country’s export earnings from the crop dropped to
$392.75 million last season from $448.89 million earned from
3.15 million bags a year earlier, according to the UCDA.  The East African nation, the continent’s biggest grower of
the beans after  Ethiopia , consumes about 3 percent of its annual
crop, according to the Eastern Africa Fine Coffee Association.  Uganda was Africa’s biggest coffee exporter and the world’s
ninth-largest in the 12 months through September 2011, according
to the London-based International Coffee Organization. Robusta
beans, used in espressos and instant drinks, account for about
85 percent of Ugandan production, according to the authority.  To contact the reporter on this story:
