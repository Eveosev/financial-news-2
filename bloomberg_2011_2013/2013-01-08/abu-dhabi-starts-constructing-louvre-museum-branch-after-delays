Abu Dhabi , the oil-rich sheikhdom
that’s transforming itself into a business and cultural hub,
awarded a contract to build a branch of the Louvre museum on an
island off its coast after a property crash resulted in delays.  A venture of  Arabtec Holding Co., (ARTC)  Constructora San Jose SA
and Oger Abu Dhabi won a 2.4 billion-dirham ($653 million)
contract from government-owned Tourism Development & Investment
Co., according to a  statement  posted on Dubai’s stock market
today. Arabtec, whose  shares climbed  to the highest in more than
two months, said construction will start immediately.  Abu Dhabi, which holds about 6 percent of the world’s
proven oil reserves, said last January it was restarting real-
estate projects including branches of the Louvre and Guggenheim
museums that were suspended for two years while a review of
their viability was under way. The global credit crisis in 2008
caused a speculation-driven property boom to burst and caused
the cancellation or delay of about $757 billion of projects in
the  United Arab Emirates , Citigroup said in a report in October.  The museum, designed by  Jean Nouvel , will be built on
64,000 square meters (688,890 square foot) on Saadiyat island
and will be opened in 2015, Arabtec said in the statement. The
structure will be covered by a “shallow dome” that filters
light into the building, and evoke “the image of a city
floating on the sea.” The museum is part of a cultural district
that also includes a franchise of the Guggenheim and the Zayed
National Museum set to open in 2016 and 2017, respectively.  Construction of the Louvre’s concrete frames is set to be
completed by the first quarter of next year, while the main dome
will be finished by the end of 2014, Arabtec said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
