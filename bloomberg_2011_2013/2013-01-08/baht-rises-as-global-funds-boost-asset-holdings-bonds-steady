Thailand ’s baht advanced for a second
day after global funds boosted holdings of assets in the region,
home to the world’s fastest-growing economies. Government bonds
were little changed.  Foreign funds bought $208 million more Thai equities than
they sold this year through yesterday and poured a net $516
million into sovereign debt, according to data from the stock
exchange and the Thai Bond Market Association. Thailand’s
economy may have expanded 5.7 percent in 2012 and will grow 5
percent in 2013, the  finance ministry  forecast on Dec. 26.
Asia’s developing economies will expand 7.2 percent this year,
double the 3.6 percent projected for the world, according to
International Monetary Fund estimates published in October.  “Compared with other regions, Asia, especially Southeast
Asian nations, is in better shape and that attracts fund
inflows,” said  Hideki Hayashi , a researcher at the Japan Center
for Economic Research in Tokyo. “The current risk-on mood is
providing support for Asian currencies, including the baht.”  The currency rose 0.1 percent to 30.44 per dollar as of
3:02 p.m. in Bangkok, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves in
exchange rates used to price options, rose five basis points, or
0.05 percentage point, to 4.15 percent.  The Bank of Thailand meets to set  interest rates  tomorrow.
All 22 economists surveyed by Bloomberg expect the benchmark
will be left at 2.75 percent. It was cut by 25 basis points in
October.  The yield on the government’s 3.125 percent bonds due
December 2015 held at 2.95 percent, data compiled by Bloomberg
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
