Hungary, which is battling to exit
the European Union’s excessive-deficit procedure, is on track to
keep its budget deficit below the bloc’s 3 percent of economic
output limit, the  Economy Ministry  said.  The government’s cash-flow based shortfall was 607.5
billion forint ($2.7 billion) in 2012, after a surplus of 84.2
billion forint in December, the ministry said in an e-mailed
statement today. That’s equivalent to 2.1 percent of gross
domestic product, excluding the deficit of local councils.  “The 2012 cash flow-based deficit gives a good foundation
for meeting” the 2.7 percent of GDP deficit goal, according to
EU methodology, the ministry said. The official deficit data
will be sent to the EU at the end of March, the ministry said.  Prime Minister Viktor Orban has relied on new taxes,
including special levies on the banking and telecommunications
industries, to keep the budget shortfall below 3 percent and
avoid losing EU development funds.  The austerity helped drive the economy into its second
recession in four years as tax increases damaged investment,
lending, consumption and growth.  Talks with the  International Monetary Fund  and the EU on
aid of about 15 billion euros ($19.7 billion), which  Hungary 
originally requested in November 2011, stalled amid a
disagreement over the government’s fiscal policies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
