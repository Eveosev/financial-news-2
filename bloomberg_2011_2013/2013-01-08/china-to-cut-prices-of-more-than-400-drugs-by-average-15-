China will cut the maximum retail
prices of more than 400 varieties of drugs by an average 15
percent, including products from  Pfizer Inc. (PFE) ,  Novartis AG (NOVN)  and
 Merck & Co. (MRK) , to reduce health-care costs in the nation.  The changes, effective Feb. 1, will cover drugs used for
respiratory diseases and pain relief, as well as other
specialized medicines, the National Development and Reform
Commission said in a  statement  on its website.  This is the fourth set of state-mandated price adjustments
since 2011, with earlier cuts for drugs including antibiotics,
vaccines and cancer medicines, the NDRC said. The government
wants to reduce medical costs for China’s aging population,
through means such as requiring hospitals derive as much as half
their drug sales from cheaper essential medicines, Shanghai
Securities News said today, citing Health Minister Chen Zhu.  Among the products affected are Merck’s asthma treatment
Singulair, Pfizer’s  Zyvox , an antibiotic, as well as Novartis’s
epilepsy drug Trileptal, according to a  list  of prices released
by the government.  Prices of higher-end drugs will be reduced an average 20
percent in the latest adjustment, while some cheaper items that
face limited supply will have their prices raised to encourage
production, the NDRC said.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
