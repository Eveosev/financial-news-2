The  U.K. economy  will have a
“modest” recovery this year and business confidence is
strengthening, according to the British Chambers of Commerce.  A gauge of sentiment rose “markedly” in the fourth
quarter, though it remained weak by historical standards, the
London-based group said in a quarterly survey today. Measures of
domestic and export orders at both manufacturers and services
companies rose, it said.  “The economy is making progress, despite the numerous
challenges it has faced,” said BCC Director General John Longworth. “Despite rising business confidence that the outlook
will improve, it is clear that economic growth remains weak and
that nurturing it must be a top priority.”  Today’s survey follows similar reports yesterday that said
companies are becoming more optimistic in the economy, while
data last week showed that the Bank of England’s new efforts to
boost credit are beginning to yield results. Still, services
unexpectedly slumped in December, highlighting the fragility of
Britain’s recovery.  The Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee will keep
its  bond-purchase program  at 375 billion pounds ($602 billion)
on Jan. 10, said all 39 economists in a Bloomberg News survey.
It will also leave the benchmark interest rate at a record-low
0.5 percent, according to a separate poll.  Export Demand  The pound fell 0.2 percent to $1.6090 as of 7:44 a.m.
London time. It weakened to 81.52 pence per euro, from 81.39.  The BCC, which surveyed 7,662 businesses between Nov. 12
and Dec. 5, said its results suggest the economy didn’t shrink
in the fourth quarter. Manufacturers’ export orders rose to 11
percent from 8 percent in the previous three months, while
services export orders increased to 18 percent from 15 percent.  Manufacturers’ confidence that turnover will improve in the
next 12 months to 41 percent in the fourth quarter from 32
percent in the three months through September, while the
 profitability balance  increased 12 points to 30 percent.
Services companies’ confidence in turnover rose 10 points to 38
percent, the most since 2008. The profit outlook increased to
the highest level since 2007.  Separately today, the British Retail Consortium said
Christmas was “underwhelming” for U.K. retailers with sales
barely rising and the outlook for 2013 is little better.  Sales at stores  open at least a year gained 0.3 percent in
December from a year earlier, the worst performance since 2010,
when snowy conditions deterred shoppers. Total revenue climbed
1.5 percent, but would have fallen excluding buoyant online
revenue, BRC Director General Helen Dickinson said. Web sales
climbed 18 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
