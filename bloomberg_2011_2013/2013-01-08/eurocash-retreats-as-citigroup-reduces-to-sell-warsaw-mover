Eurocash SA (EUR) , Poland’s biggest
distributor of non-durable  consumer goods , declined for the
first time in five days after Citigroup Inc. downgraded it from
neutral to sell “on strong share performance.”  The  stock  slumped as much as 3.1 percent, and traded 1.4
percent lower at 47 zloty as of the 5:30 p.m. close in Warsaw
trading. Today’s volume on the stock was about 162 percent of
the three-month daily average, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The distributor has gained 7.6 percent this year,
compared with a 0.8 percent loss for the benchmark WIG20 Index.  “With the Polish economy slowing, we expect all key
players in the market to invest in price discounting,” Piotr Zielonka, a Warsaw-based analyst at Citigroup said in a research
today. “We believe Eurocash is also decreasing prices for its
franchise stores to be more competitive, which is putting
pressure on the company’s margins.”  Polish economic growth will slow to 1.8 percent this year
due to weakening exports and domestic demand, according to
European Union forecasts. That compares with 0.1 percent
expansion projected for the 17-country euro area.  To contact the reporter on this story:
