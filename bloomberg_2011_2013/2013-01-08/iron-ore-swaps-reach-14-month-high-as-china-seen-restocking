Iron-ore swaps rose to a 14-month
high on speculation  China , the largest importer of the
steelmaking raw material, needs to restock at a time of year
when the biggest suppliers often face weather disruptions.  January contracts gained 0.8 percent to $151.25 a dry
metric ton, according to GFI Group Inc. Thatâ€™s the highest for
the coming month since October 2011, according to GFI and SSY
Futures Ltd., two of the largest brokers of the contracts.  Traders are reacting to concerns that storms in Australia
and Brazil may disrupt supply, as in previous years, said Kerry Deal, head of iron-ore and bulk derivatives at Jefferies Hong
Kong Ltd. While China typically restocks in January, he said,
 port inventories  plunged 24 percent since the end of August to
72.97 million tons, within 3.4 percent of a more than two-year
low, according to researcher Beijing Antaike Information
Development Co.  To contact the reporter on this story:
