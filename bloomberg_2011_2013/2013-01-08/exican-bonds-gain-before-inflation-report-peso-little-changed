Mexico ’s peso bonds gained for the
first time in 2013 as speculation mounted that slowing inflation
will prompt the central bank to maintain benchmark interest
rates at a record low.  Yields on fixed-rate government debt maturing in 2014 fell
one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 4.8 percent at 4
p.m. in Mexico City, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The peso dropped 0.3 percent to 12.8030 per dollar.  A report tomorrow will show annual inflation slowed to 3.76
percent in December from 4.18 percent the prior month, according
to the median forecast of 12 economists surveyed by Bloomberg.
Shorter-term bonds are rallying as investors become increasingly
confident that policy makers won’t raise the 4.5 percent
benchmark rate as inflation eases to within their target range
of 2 percent to 4 percent, according to  Rafael Camarena , an
economist at Grupo Financiero Santander Mexico SAB.  “The topic of inflation is more reflected in the shorter-
term or medium-term debt,” Camarena said by phone from Mexico
City. “There are expectations for good inflation data
tomorrow.”  The government sold all 5 billion pesos of 28-day bills
that it offered at auction today, according to the central bank.
The Finance Ministry also auctioned 7 billion pesos of 91-day
securities, 9 billion pesos in 182-day notes and 9.5 billion
pesos in 364-day bills, all known as Cetes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
