Heating oil advanced on speculation
that refinery unit shutdowns will reduce supplies and that
higher gasoil prices in Europe will attract diesel shipments
from the U.S.  Futures rose as the U.S. neared winter refinery maintenance
season and Motiva Enterprises LLC again shut the new 325,000-
barrel-a-day crude unit at its Port Arthur, Texas, refinery
because of a leak. Gasoil climbed to the highest level since
Dec. 3 on ICE Futures Europe exchange in London.  “There’s the anticipation we’re entering into refinery
turnaround season which will impact supply, and the market
continues to await Motiva starting up its new crude unit,” said
 Andy Lipow , president of Lipow Oil Associates LLC in Houston.
“Higher gasoil prices attract exports from the U.S.”  Heating oil for February delivery rose 3.13 cents, or 1
percent, to $3.0634 a gallon at 10:17 a.m. on the  New York 
Mercantile Exchange, after touching $3.0752.  There is no timeline for the restart of the Motiva crude
unit, which has been idled since a Dec. 11 fire that was caused
by a leak on the unit’s heater outlet. The crude unit first shut
for repair just days after its May debut as the centerpiece of
an expansion to almost double capacity of the refinery to
600,000 barrels a day.  Gasoil for January delivery rose $8, or 0.9 percent, to
$946.50 a metric ton and touched $950, while February Brent
increased 38 cents to $111.78 a barrel.  Crack Spread  The February heating oil  crack spread , or premium of
heating oil over crude, jumped $1.51 to $35.67 a barrel.  “Refinery maintenance is ahead going into February and
March, and products will strengthen,” said Amrita Sen, chief
oil market strategist at Energy Aspects Ltd., a research
consulting company in  London . “And whenever Motiva can’t start
that crude unit, heating oil cracks get stronger.”  Philadelphia Energy Solutions plans to close the Girard
Point section of its Philadelphia refinery near the end of
January for about 60 days of work, a person familiar with the
situation said on Dec. 26.  Gasoline for February delivery gained 1.49 cents, or 0.5
percent, to $2.2923 a gallon on the exchange.  The average nationwide  retail price  for regular gasoline
rose 0.3 cent to $3.30 a gallon, AAA said today on its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
