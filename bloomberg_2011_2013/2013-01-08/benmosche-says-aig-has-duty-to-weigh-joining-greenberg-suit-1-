American International Group Inc. (AIG)  has
a duty to weigh whether to join a suit by former Chief Executive
Officer Maurice “Hank” Greenberg stating that the company’s
2008 U.S. bailout was unconstitutional, the insurer said.  “The Board of Directors has fiduciary and legal
obligations to the company and its shareholders to consider the
demand served on us,” CEO  Robert Benmosche  said today in a
statement from the New York-based insurer.  AIG’s board is scheduled to meet tomorrow to review the
case filed by Greenberg against the government in 2011. The ex-
CEO has said that the rescue cheated shareholders by diluting
their stake in the company. The insurer needed help after it was
unable to raise money in equity and bond markets to pay clients
who had bought protection against losses on mortgage-related
securities.  Benmosche last year repaid the remainder of its $182.3
billion rescue and has purchased ads citing the company’s
gratitude for the assistance.  “Tomorrow’s board meeting is about listening to all of the
parties involved and gaining a thorough understanding of the
issues,” Benmosche said. “We anticipate making a decision in
the next several weeks.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
