South Korea ’s government bonds rose,
pushing the five-year yield to a seven-week low, as speculation
a slump in U.S. Treasuries increased demand for emerging-market
assets.  Treasuries had their worst start to a year since 2009 after
the  Federal Reserve  indicated, according to minutes of last
month’s meeting released Jan. 3, that it may end its $85 billion
monthly bond purchases sometime in 2013. U.S. government
securities handed investors a 0.7 percent loss in 2013 as of
yesterday, Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes show. Bank of
Korea Governor Kim Choong Soo said last week the central bank
will seek other ways to spur economic growth than using monetary
policy.  “Investors are closely tracking the yield moves in the
world’s largest economy,” said D.J. Park, fixed-income analyst
at Samsung Futures Inc. in  Seoul . “Still, movement in the yield
in Korean bonds is likely to be limited as investors await the
central bank’s  interest-rate  decision this week.”  The yield on South Korea’s 2.75 percent bonds due September
2017 fell four basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 2.87
percent, according to Korea Exchange prices. That matched the
level for the benchmark  five-year yield  on Nov. 20 and Nov. 21.  Bank of Korea policy makers meet on Jan. 11 to decide on
borrowing costs. All 10 economists surveyed by  Bloomberg News 
forecast the benchmark interest rate will remain at 2.75
percent, while seven of 16 economists in a separate survey see a
25 basis point reduction by March.  The central bank kept the  seven-day repurchase rate  at 2.75
percent last month, after cuts of 25 basis points at reviews in
July and October.  Currency Market  The won rose 0.1 percent to close at 1,062.90 per dollar at
3 p.m. in Seoul, reversing a two-day decline, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. It touched 1,060.50 yesterday, the
strongest level since Aug. 4, 2011, before closing at 1,063.76
on speculation authorities took action to slow the won’s
appreciation.  Finance Minister Bahk Jae Wan said last week he was
concerned about herd behavior in the foreign-exchange market and
the government was actively considering measures to curb
volatility in the won, which was  Asia ’s best-performing currency
last year, with an 8.3 percent advance versus the dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
