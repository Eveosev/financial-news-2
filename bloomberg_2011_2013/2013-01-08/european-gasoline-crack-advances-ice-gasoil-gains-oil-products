European  gasoline barges  and its
crack, or premium to  Brent crude , advanced to the highest level
since October as Cargill Inc. bought the fuel.  Gasoil gained to the most in about five weeks on the ICE
Futures Europe exchange in London as Brent rose.  Light Products  Gunvor Group Ltd. sold a 1,000 metric-ton barge at $983 a
ton in the Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp area, according to a
Bloomberg survey of traders and brokers monitoring the Argus
Bulletin Board. That compares with deals from $970 to $981.50
yesterday and $1,005 on Oct. 19. Ethanol is added to the Eurobob
grade to make finished fuel.  Gasoline’s crack  rose to $7.19 a barrel as of 10:51 a.m.
local time, according to data from PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a
broker in  London . It was $7.09 yesterday and $7.25 on Oct. 15.  Naphtha’s crack , or discount to Brent, narrowed to $5.90 a
barrel from $6.01 the previous session, according to PVM data.  Middle Distillates  Gasoil for January delivery rose $10.75, or 1.2 percent, to
$949.25 as of 12:08 p.m. London time on the ICE exchange.  The contract’s discount to February futures was $1.75 a
ton, keeping the market in contango, a structure that can signal
falling demand or rising supply.  Gasoil’s crack  advanced to $15.31 a barrel versus $14.81 in
the previous session. Brent gained 0.9 percent to $112.40 a
barrel on ICE.  Structural deficits in global gasoil balances create risks
of a spike in the price of the fuel, according to Deutsche Bank.  “An improving macro backdrop, particularly in the second
half of 2013 and as  China  returns to potential growth rates,
should prove supportive for this part of the barrel,” the bank
said today in an e-mailed note.  To contact the reporter on this story:
