Iran  will start operating two
combined-cycle power plants with a combined generating capacity
of 648 megawatts, state-run  Press TV  reported, citing Mohammad
Reza Qalambor, the project’s manager.  The Shahid Bastami power station in the city of Shahroud
and the Quds facility in the city of Semnan will be inaugurated
today, Qalambor said, according to a report on the broadcaster’s
website. Iran has invested about $38 million in the plants in
the country’s central region, Press TV reported.  President  Mahmoud Ahmadinejad  in December started the
second phase of a combined-cycle power plant in the northern
city of Pakdasht, which the report said was the largest in the
 Middle East  and cost 2 billion euros. The Pakdasht facility has
12 units for burning natural gas to produce electricity and six
units that use steam, Press TV reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
