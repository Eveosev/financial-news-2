Lithuania plans to raise taxes on
high earners and property starting in 2014 as part of an
overhaul of the Baltic nation’s tax system aimed at boosting
revenue, Finance Minister Rimantas Sadzius said.  The revamp will involve personal income tax, the untaxed
minimum and social-insurance taxes, Sadzius said today. It will
also widen the scope of the property tax and may include a
review of value-added tax breaks, according to the minister.  “Making taxation progressive shouldn’t hurt average
earners,” Sadzius said in an  online conference  on the delfi.lt
news website. “The higher rates will be for people with very
large salaries.”  Prime Minister Algirdas Butkevicius, whose government took
office last month, made introducing progressive income taxes a
pledge in his election campaign and wants proposals by April for
enactment in 2014. At present, Lithuania taxes both personal and
corporate income at a flat rate of 15 percent, while dividend
income is taxed at 20 percent and VAT at 21 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
