The yield on  Vietnam ’s one-year bonds
fell to the lowest level in almost four years after the
government sold debt of that maturity at almost 50 basis points
less than the last sale. The dong was little changed.  The yield dropped by the most since May after the State
Treasury sold 926 billion dong ($44 million) of 364-day bills at
an average yield of 8 percent yesterday, compared with 8.49
percent on Dec. 24, according to a posting on the Hanoi Stock
Exchange  website . Yields have fallen as an economic slowdown
crimped credit demand, boosting cash levels at banks and
spurring lenders’ demand for debt, said Nguyen Duy Phong, a Ho
Chi Minh City-based analyst at Viet Capital Securities Co.  “Credit growth could improve compared to 2012 but not
significantly,” he said. “Investors feel there is still room
for fixed-income product values to increase further.”  The yield on the one-year bonds fell 23 basis points, or
0.23 percentage point, to 8.28 percent, according to a daily
fixing rate from banks compiled by Bloomberg. That’s the lowest
level since Feb. 20, 2009 and the sharpest decline since May 15.
The yield on benchmark five-year securities fell five basis
points to 9.68 percent, the lowest since Aug. 21.  The value of outstanding loans increased by around 7
percent in 2012, according to a Dec. 27 statement from the
central bank, which is targeting 12 percent credit expansion
this year. Lending growth may be slow in the first few months of
2013, Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung said in his New Year’s
message posted on the government’s website Jan. 1.  Dong Steady  The interbank overnight deposit  rate  dropped 13 basis
points to 3.45 percent, the fourth day of declines, according to
daily fixings by banks compiled by Bloomberg. The rate has
fallen 105 basis points since Jan. 2, signaling banks’ funding
availability has increased.  The dong traded at 20,840 per dollar as of 3:03 p.m. in
Hanoi, compared with 20,835 yesterday, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The  State Bank  of Vietnam set its
 reference rate  at 20,828, unchanged since December 2011,
