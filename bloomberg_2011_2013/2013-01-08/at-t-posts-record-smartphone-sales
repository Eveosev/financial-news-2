AT&T Inc. (T) , the second-largest U.S.
wireless carrier, sold more than 10 million smartphones in the
fourth quarter, setting a record, after demand for the iPhone
and Android devices spurred holiday sales.  The results topped AT&T’s previous record-high sales of 9.4
million smartphones in the year-earlier period, the Dallas-based
company said today in a statement.  The carrier is trying to bounce back from the third
quarter, when it added just 151,000 contract subscribers. That
compared with 1.5 million net additions at AT&T’s biggest rival,
 Verizon Wireless . AT&T is playing catch-up with Verizon in
rolling out a network using a technology called long-term
evolution, which allows for faster downloads.  Gaining smartphone customers is key to AT&T’s strategy
because they use more data -- and therefore have higher bills --
than subscribers who buy regular phones. Smartphone subscribers
generate twice as much revenue on average as other customers,
Ralph de la Vega, president of the AT&T Mobility division, said
today in the statement.  The company plans to report its full fourth-quarter results
on Jan. 24.  To contact the reporter on this story:
