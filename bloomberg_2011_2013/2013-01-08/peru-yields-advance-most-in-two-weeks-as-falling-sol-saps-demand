Peruvian bonds fell, pushing up
yields the most in two weeks, as declines in the sol curbed the
appeal of assets denominated in the local currency.  The yield on the nation’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol-
denominated bond due August 2020 rose two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 3.89 percent, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The price fell 0.2 centimo to 125.63 centimos per
sol.  The sol weakened for a second day as local banks boosted
dollar holdings after policy makers increased lenders’ reserve
requirements effective Jan. 1 to cool credit demand.  “There aren’t many dollars in the money market and that
could hit the sol in the short term,” said Diego Llona, a bond
trader at Banco Santander SA’s local unit. “That reduces demand
for sol bonds.”  The sol depreciated 0.1 percent to 2.5485 per U.S. dollar
at today’s close, according to prices compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
