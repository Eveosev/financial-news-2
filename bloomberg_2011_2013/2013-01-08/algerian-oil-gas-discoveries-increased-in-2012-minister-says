Algeria  made 31 oil and natural gas
discoveries last year, including 24 by state-run Sonatrach
alone, compared with 20 finds in 2011, Energy Minister Youcef Yousfi said.  The new discoveries didn’t keep pace with the amount the
country produced from reserves last year and Algeria needs to
attract foreign partnerships, Yousfi told parliamentarians in
Algiers. National demand for energy products will probably rise
to a range of 80 million metric tons to 100 million tons of oil
equivalent in 2030, from current consumption of 46 million tons
a year, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
