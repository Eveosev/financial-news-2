The U.S. Energy Department  increased
crude-oil price projections for 2013 and forecast that global
consumption will climb to a record.  West Texas Intermediate oil will average  $89.54 a barrel 
this year, up 1.3 percent from the December projection of
$88.38, the department said today in its monthly Short-Term
Energy Outlook. The U.S. benchmark grade averaged $94.12 in
2012, less than the December estimate of $94.26.  Brent, the benchmark grade for more than half the world’s
crude, will average $105.17 a barrel in 2013, up 1.4 percent
from last month’s forecast. The average cost of domestic and
imported grades used by U.S. refiners will be $94.27 a barrel in
2013, up 1.2 percent from the December projection of $93.11.  WTI will climb to an average $91 a barrel next year, while
Brent will slip to $99.25 according to the report. This is the
first edition of the outlook to have 2014 forecasts.  The spread between Brent and WTI, which will average $15.63
a barrel this year, will narrow to $8.25 in 2014. The Brent
premium will shrink because increasing pipeline capacity will
lower the cost of shipping oil from the central U.S. to
refineries on the  Gulf Coast , according to the report.  The department  increased its forecast  for global oil
consumption this year to 90.11 million barrels a day from 90
million estimated last month. Demand will be 1.1 percent higher
than last year’s average of 89.17 million. Global consumption
will climb to 91.46 million in 2014.  To contact the reporter on this story:
