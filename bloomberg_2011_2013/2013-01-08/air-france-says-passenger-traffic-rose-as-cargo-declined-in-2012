Air France-KLM Group (AF)  boosted
passenger traffic in 2012 by 2.1 percent, led by  Europe , as
cargo traffic dropped.  The number of passengers carried rose by 1.8 percent to
77.4 million, the Paris-based airline said in an e-mailed
statement today. The airline increased capacity by 0.6 percent
and filled more seats than in the prior year as its planes were
83.1 percent full, 1.2 percentage points more than in 2011.  The biggest jump in traffic, or revenue passenger
kilometers, came in Europe, up 3.6 percent on a 2.9 percent jump
in capacity.  Cargo carriage fell 6.3 percent, declining more than the
3.5 percent drop in capacity, with the load factor, or
percentage of available space filled, dropping 1.9 percentage
points to 64.5 percent.  December traffic was affected by severe weather conditions,
the carrier said, particularly in North America. Passenger
traffic in the month was stable on an 0.4 percent reduction in
capacity. The number of passengers carried fell by 2 percent to
6 million. Unit revenue per available seat kilometer was up
relative to the year-earlier month, Air France KLM said, without
providing a figure.  Air France will serve six destinations with its Airbus SAS
A380 superjumbos for the winter season, the carrier said. Those
are New York-JFK, Washington D.C., Los Angeles, Johannesburg,
Tokyo-Narita and  Singapore . Air France carried its three-
millionth passenger on an A380 in December.  To contact the reporter on this story:
