Gasoline pump prices in the U.S. will
peak at $3.60 to $3.80 a gallon this year, AAA Chief Executive
Officer Robert Darbelnet projected today.  Prices in 2012 reached $3.936 on April 4. The 2012 average
price was a record $3.60 a gallon, according to data from the
largest U.S. motoring organization.  Costs will be lower this year as “a result of increased
domestic oil production and lower demand,” Darbelnet said in an
e-mailed statement today. “Absent significant storms, major
wars or production and distribution outages, the single largest
factor that will influence gasoline prices in 2013 will be the
strength of the U.S. economy.”  The average price for a gallon of regular gasoline is
$3.30, 7 cents below a year ago and 5 cents less than a month
ago, AAA said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
