The Canadian dollar rose against the
majority of its most-traded peers before a housing report may
indicate the country’s real estate market is headed for a soft
landing rather than a crash.  The loonie, as the currency is nicknamed, fluctuated
against its U.S. counterpart before a report tomorrow projected
to show housing starts slowed in December. Crude oil, Canada’s
largest export, rose for a third straight day.  “I think most of the story is flows and repositioning,”
said  Greg Moore , a currency strategist at Toronto-Dominion Bank
by phone from Toronto. “It’s been very quiet, there’s been very
little data out, pretty few fundamental changes.”  The loonie was little changed against its U.S. counterpart
at 98.60 cents per  U.S. dollar  at 8:07 a.m. in Toronto. One
Canadian dollar buys $1.0142.  Construction started on 195,000 residential units in
December, down from 196,100 the month before, according to the
median estimate of a Bloomberg survey of 22 economists. The
government tightened mortgage rules in June to slow the increase
of  consumer debt  after the  Bank of Canada  cited the chance of a
housing downturn as a major risk to the economy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
