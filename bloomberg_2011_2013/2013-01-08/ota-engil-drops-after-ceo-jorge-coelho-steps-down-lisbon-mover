Mota-Engil SGPS SA (EGL) ,  Portugal ’s
biggest construction company, fell the most in more than a week
in Lisbon after Chief Executive Officer Jorge Coelho stepped
down for personal reasons.  The stock dropped as much as 6 percent to 1.78 euros, the
biggest intraday decline since Dec. 31. The Oporto-based company
traded down 3.9 percent to 1.82 euros at 8:55 a.m. in the
Portuguese capital, reducing its market value to 369 million
euros ($485 million). Trading volume was almost twice the three-
month daily average.  “Investors are always weary when CEOs leave companies,
especially when they have done a very positive job,” said  Pedro Oliveira , a trader at Go Bulling in Lisbon.  Mota-Engil was the second-best performer in Lisbon’s PSI20
index after  Banco BPI SA (BPI)  last year, with a 51 percent increase.  As CEO of Mota-Engil for five years, Coelho oversaw the
company’s international expansion to about 20 countries to
counter a slump in the domestic construction sector. Goncalo Martins, who was the company’s chief financial officer, will
replace Coelho, Mota-Engil said in a  regulatory filing 
yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
