Tesoro Corp. (TSO) ’s Golden Eagle oil
refinery in Northern California shut the alkylation unit over
the weekend for about 12 days of planned repairs, a person with
direct knowledge of the work said.  The refinery is performing scheduled maintenance on columns
at the alkylation plant, which produces a high-octane blending
component for gasoline, said the person, who asked not to be
identified because the information isn’t public. The unit was
shut Jan. 6, the person said.  Tina Barbee, a spokeswoman at Tesoro’s headquarters in  San
Antonio , said by e-mail that the Golden Eagle plant is
“undergoing planned (unspecified) maintenance.” The work
shouldn’t affect the refinery’s ability to meet supply
commitments, she said.  The plant can process 170,000 barrels a day of feedstock,
data compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
