The University of  Alabama  became the
third school since 1936 to win college football’s national
championship three times in a four-year span with a 42-14 rout
of the  University of Notre Dame .  Alabama junior quarterback AJ McCarron threw four touchdown
passes, while Crimson Tide running backs Eddie Lacy and T.J.
Yeldon each rushed for more than 100 yards and a touchdown last
night at Miami’s Sun Life Stadium.  It’s the 11th consensus national championship for Alabama,
which becomes the first school in the 15-year history of the
Bowl Championship Series to win back-to-back titles. The Crimson
Tide, who finished the season with a 13-1 record, also won BCS
championships following the 2009 and 2011 seasons.  “It was a total team effort and I couldn’t be more proud
of our guys,” McCarron said in a televised interview. “All the
hard work we put in during the season, it really paid off and
this is what we do it for.”  Notre Dame  lost for the first time in 13 games this season
and was denied its first national championship since 1988.  Alabama dominated from the start against a Fighting Irish
defense that had allowed 10.33 points a game this season, the
fewest at college football’s top level.  Alabama scored touchdowns on its first three possessions
and outgained Notre Dame 203-23 in total yards in rolling to a
21-0 lead. The Crimson Tide was up 35-0 midway through the third
quarter, finished with 529 yards of offense and had five scoring
drives of 80 yards or more. Notre Dame hadn’t allowed a
touchdown drive of more than 75 yards all season.  “Our offense did a great job,” Alabama coach Nick Saban
said after winning his fourth BCS crown in 10 years. “They
controlled the whole tempo of the game.”  Saban’s Success  Alabama’s latest championship continues its run of success
under Saban, becoming the first school to win consecutive titles
since the University of  Nebraska  in 1994-95. The only other
school to win consensus back-to-back titles since 1950 was the
University of  Oklahoma  in 1955-56.  Nebraska also won in 1997, giving it three titles in four
years. Notre Dame won championships in 1946, 1947 and 1949.  Saban, who won his first BCS title in 2003 while at
 Louisiana State University , becomes the fourth coach at college
football’s top level to win four championships. He joins
Alabama’s Bear Bryant (6), Notre Dame’s Frank Leahy (4) and the
 University of Southern California ’s John McKay (4). Saban, 61,
earned a $400,000 title bonus on top of his $5.9 million salary.  “I’m proud of these guys, I’m happy for them,” Saban said
as he was surrounded on the field by his players. “As a coach,
I want to win the game for them. I want them to be able to say
their legacy as a team 10, 20 years from now is that they won a
national championship.”  SEC Dominance  Alabama, which was a 9 1/2-point favorite, now has a record
34 bowl victories and gives the  Southeastern Conference  its
seventh straight BCS title. In addition to the Crimson Tide’s
wins, Auburn won in 2010,  Florida  claimed championships in 2006
and 2008, and LSU captured the BCS title in 2007.  “I’m really proud that they stayed focused and kept the
right mental disposition to do the things they needed to do to
be successful this season,” Saban said.  Notre Dame was the first team to reach the BCS title game
after starting the season unranked. Brigham Young in 1984 is the
last school to win the championship without being ranked
entering the season.  Bowl Losses  The Fighting Irish have now lost 11 of their past 13 bowl
games, including two in a row.  “We’re not there yet,” Notre Dame coach  Brian Kelly  said.
“Alabama showed us that the way they played the game. It’s up
to everyone coming back to take that next step.”  The Fighting Irish surrendered a 20-yard touchdown run by
Lacy on the game’s opening drive and a 1-yard run by Yeldon, a
freshman, on the first play of the second quarter to fall behind
21-0. Notre Dame had allowed a total of two rushing touchdowns
through its first 12 games this season.  McCarron completed 20 of 28 passes for 264 yards in
becoming the first quarterback to lead his team to back-to-back
BCS titles. Florida State’s Chris Weinke, Miami’s Ken Dorsey and
USC’s  Matt Leinart  all won in their first appearances in the BCS
championship game and then lost the second.  “It’s pretty special,” McCarron said. “It gives me
chills thinking about it. I owe everything to my teammates,
coaching staff. They made this all possible.”  Halftime Shutout  McCarron threw a 3-yard touchdown pass to  Michael Williams 
and an 11-yarder to Lacy with 31 seconds left in the first half
as Alabama led 28-0 at halftime. Before last night, the most
points allowed by Notre Dame this season was in a 29-26 triple-
overtime win against Pittsburgh on Nov. 3.  After a deep pass by Notre Dame quarterback Everett Golson
was intercepted at the Alabama 3-yard line on the Irish’s first
drive of the second half, the Crimson Tide marched 97 yards for
another touchdown. McCarron capped the drive with a 34-yard pass
to freshman Amari Cooper for a 35-0 Alabama lead.  Golson finally put Notre Dame on the scoreboard with 4:08
left in the third quarter by scoring on a 2-yard quarterback
option. It was the first score in the past two BCS title games
against Alabama, which shut out Louisiana State 21-0 last year.  The Crimson Tide responded with an 86-yard scoring drive
that culminated in McCarron’s fourth touchdown pass, a 19-yarder
to Cooper. Notre Dame’s final touchdown came on a 6-yard pass
from Golson to Theo Riddick with 7:51 left.  While Alabama and Notre Dame have combined for 1,692 wins,
the schools met only twice before in bowl games. Saban said last
night he’d enjoy his latest title for 48 hours before shifting
his focus to next season.  “This team did a great job from the word go and I’m proud
of what we were able to accomplish,” Saban said. “But two days
from now, we’ve got to start on next year.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
