Japan signed an agreement with
Mongolia to help offset its greenhouse gas emissions, the
Ministry of the Environment said in a statement today.  The agreement is the first of its kind as Tokyo seeks to
develop similar bilateral offset-credit mechanisms with
countries including Indonesia, Vietnam and Bangladesh.  Under the bilateral mechanism, Japan will cut carbon
dioxide emissions by setting up energy-management systems and
forest-protection projects in  developing countries  using
Japanese technologies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
