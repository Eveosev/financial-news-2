The European Union sold 3.5 million
prompt carbon emission permits at a lower price than bids on the
open market, signaling lower demand for the allowances.  The auction price was 6.35 euros ($8.33) a metric ton,
according to  data  from European Energy Exchange AG, the EU’s
appointed auctioneer. Carbon permits eligible from 2013 through
2020 for delivery within two days were bid at 6.38 euros and
offered at 6.46 euros a ton when the auction closed at 11 a.m.
Berlin time, according to data from ICE Futures  Europe .  At an auction yesterday, the first this year, the clearing
price was higher than the prevailing cost of prompt permits for
the first time since Oct. 23. The volume of bids in today’s sale
totaled 8.7 million tons, or 2.4 times the volume of permits for
sale, according to data from EEX. That’s lower than yesterday’s
bid ratio of 2.6.  To contact the reporter on this story:
