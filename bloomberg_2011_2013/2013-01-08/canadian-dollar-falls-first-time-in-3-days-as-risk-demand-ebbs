The Canadian dollar fell against its
U.S. counterpart for the first time in three days as global risk
appetite declined.  The currency erased gains from earlier today as stocks
declined and futures on crude oil, the nation’s largest export,
slipped. A report tomorrow is projected to show housing starts
slowed in December, which may indicate the country’s real estate
market is headed for a soft landing.  “We had a bid for risk assets and the Canadian dollar
overnight, but we’ve since come back,”  Shaun Osborne , chief
currency strategist at Toronto-Dominion Bank, said in a
telephone interview from Toronto. “Risk appetite and equities
still define the strongest correlation for the Canadian
dollar.”  The loonie, as the Canadian currency is known for the image
of the waterfowl on the C$1 coin, fell 0.1 percent to 98.67
cents per U.S. dollar at 5 p.m. in Toronto, after gaining as
much as 0.2 percent. One Canadian dollar buys $1.0135.  Crude oil dropped 0.1 percent to $93.12 per barrel. The
 Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  declined 0.3 percent.  Technical Levels  The Canadian dollar’s failure to move above a resistance
level at 98.26 has stalled a longer-term increase versus the
greenback, George Davis, chief technical analyst for fixed
income and currency strategy in Toronto at Royal Bank of  Canada ,
wrote today in a note to clients. If the loonie breaks through
resistance at 98.26, it would open up a move to 97.66 and then
96.92, which would be its highest level since Sept. 14, Davis
said.  A gauge of volatility declined to almost the lowest in 12
years. Implied volatility for three-month options on the U.S.
dollar versus the loonie touched 5.40 percent, the least since
Dec. 20. It touched 5.32 percent on Dec. 19, the lowest since
Oct. 11, 2000. Implied volatility signals the expected pace of
currency swings and is quoted and used by traders to set option
prices.  “I think most of the story is flows and repositioning,”
said Greg Moore, a currency strategist at  Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD) 
by phone from Toronto. “It’s been very quiet, there’s been very
little data out, pretty few fundamental changes.”  The country’s 10-year bond yield fell three basis points,
or 0.03 percentage point, to 1.91 percent. The price of the 2.75
percent notes maturing in June 2022 increased 29 cents to
C$107.25.  Government Debt  The Bank of Canada said it will sell C$3.4 billion ($3.5
billion) of five-year notes tomorrow. The 1.25 percent
securities will mature in March 2018. The central bank will
announce further details of a two-year note sale on Jan. 10.  Construction started on 195,000 residential units in
December, down from 196,100 the month before, according to the
median estimate of a Bloomberg survey of 22 economists. The
government tightened mortgage rules in June to slow the increase
of consumer debt after the Bank of Canada cited the chance of a
housing downturn as a major risk to the economy.  Canada’s Ivey index rose yesterday for the first time in
five months. Economists had forecast a reading of 49.8. Readings
of more than 50 indicate purchasing by governments and companies
advanced.  The loonie traded close to the 98.37 level reached Jan. 2,
when it gained the most in more than three months, after
lawmakers in the U.S. avoided automatic austerity measures by
agreeing to raise taxes on the wealthy and putting off decisions
on spending cuts.  Canada’s currency has gained 1 percent during the past 12
months versus nine developed-nation peers tracked by Bloomberg
Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The greenback has dropped 3
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
