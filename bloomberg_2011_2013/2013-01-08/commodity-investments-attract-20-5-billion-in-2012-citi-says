Investors put a net $20.5 billion
into commodity exchange-traded funds and index swaps last year,
led by purchases of energy and precious metals, according to
Citigroup Inc.  The rise contrasted with a net withdrawal of $12.3 billion
in 2011, analysts including Aakash Doshi and  Edward Morse  in  New
York  said in a report dated yesterday. Crude and other fuels had
a net inflow of $8.8 billion in 2012, while precious metals drew
in a net $6.7 billion, led by gold, they wrote.  The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Index of 24 raw materials
advanced 0.3% last year, the smallest gain since 2008, amid
concern that  China ’s expansion was slowing.  Brent crude  climbed
3.5 percent, rising for a fourth year, while gold posted a 12th
consecutive annual advance.  This year, in the period to Jan. 4, investors withdrew more
than $400 million from commodities as the dollar strengthened,
the analysts said. Minutes from the U.S. Federal Reserve showed
that policy makers debated an end to the bank’s asset-purchase
program in 2013, driving the Dollar Index to a six-week high.  To contact the reporter on this story:
