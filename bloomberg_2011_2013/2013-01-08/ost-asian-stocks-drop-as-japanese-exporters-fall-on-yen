Asian  stocks  fell, sending the
regional benchmark index lower for a second day, as earnings
results from HTC Corp. missed estimates and Japanese exporters
declined after the yen strengthened.  HTC,  Asia ’s second-largest smartphone maker, slipped 4
percent in Taipei. Samsung Electronics Co. the world’s largest
maker of mobile phones and televisions, lost 1.3 percent in
Seoul after reporting earnings.  Mazda Motor Corp. (7261) , which gets
about 72 percent of its sales outside of Japan, sank 5 percent
as the yen’s advance dimmed the outlook for overseas earnings.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  slipped 0.6 percent to 130.69
as of 7:18 p.m.  Tokyo  time, erasing gains of as much as 0.3
percent. The regional benchmark gauge posted its seventh weekly
advance last week, the longest winning streak since March last
year, after the  U.S. Congress  approved a budget deal and
manufacturing reports from China and the U.S. added to signs of
a global recovery.  “We don’t expect a no-brainer, one-way climb for stocks,”
said  Michael Kurtz , chief global equity strategist at Nomura
Holdings Inc. in Hong Kong. “Japan for its part has delivered a
key step toward expectations of a major pro-reflation policy
shift.”  Japan’s  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average climbed 22 percent through
yesterday from Nov. 14 when elections were announced, driving
the gauge into a  bull market  as the yen fell on expectations a
new government would call for more stimulus. Prime Minister
Shinzo Abe, a proponent for more monetary policy easing, will
have a chance to reshape the  Bank of Japan  early this year, when
the terms of Governor Masaaki Shirakawa and his two deputies
expire.  Nikkei, Kospi  The Nikkei 225 fell 0.9 percent, a second day of declines.
South Korea’s Kospi Index dropped 0.7 percent, while Taiwan’s
Taiex Index decreased 0.4 percent. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index
slid 0.6 percent.  Hong Kong ’s Hang Seng Index slid 0.9 percent
and China’s Shanghai Composite Index retreated 0.4 percent.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index surged 14 percent in 2012 as
central banks from the U.S., Europe, Japan and China took action
to spur economic growth. The Asia Pacific gauge traded at 14.1
times average estimated earnings, compared with about 13.2 times
for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and about 11.9 times for the
Stoxx Europe 600 Index, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Futures on the  S&P 500 Index  slipped 0.2 percent today. The
benchmark U.S. equities gauge fell 0.3 percent yesterday as
investors awaited the start of the corporate earnings season.  Samsung Profit  HTC declined 4 percent to NT$276.5 in Taipei. Operating
income was NT$600 million ($21 million) in the fourth quarter,
compared with the NT$1.11 billion average of 20 analyst
estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Net income was NT$1 billion,
the Taoyuan, Taiwan-based company said in a statement yesterday.
That’s the lowest since 2004 and less than the NT$10.9 billion
it posted a year earlier.  Samsung dropped 1.3 percent to 1.5 million won, after
climbing to a  record  last week. The company today reported an 89
percent increase in operating profit to 8.8 trillion won ($8.3
billion) in the three months ended December, according to a
preliminary earnings statement.  “Samsung has been posting profits that beat analysts’
estimates throughout last year,” Lee Jin Woo, a  fund manager  at
Seoul-based KTB Asset Management Co., which manages about $6.6
billion, said by telephone today. “Optimism about its earnings
has largely been factored in, in advance, with the stock
enjoying a nice rally late last year.”  Stronger Yen  Japanese exporters declined as the yen headed for its
biggest two-day advance since November. A stronger currency
reduces overseas earnings of Japanese carmakers and electronics
manufacturers when repatriated.  Mazda dropped 5 percent to 171 yen in Tokyo.  Toyota Motor
Corp. (7203) , the world’s biggest carmaker, slid 2 percent to 4,100
yen. Nintendo Co., the maker of wii game consoles, fell 3.1
percent to 8,700 yen.  Aozora Bank Ltd. (8304)  decreased 4 percent to 240 yen, extending
yesterday’s 10 percent selloff after the Japanese lender
confirmed Cerberus Capital Management LP will sell most of its
holdings.  China Pacific Insurance Group Co. declined 2.6 percent to
HK$30.20. Carlyle Group LP, sold its remaining stake in the
insurer, raising about $796 million, according to a document
obtained by  Bloomberg News .  Indecent Assault  Agile Property Holdings Ltd., the Chinese developer in
which JPMorgan Chase & Co. owns a stake, slumped 6.5 percent to
HK$11.86, the most since February 2012. Chairman Chen Zhuo Lin
was formally charged with indecent assault, the company said in
statement today. His arrest is unrelated to the business of the
group and will not affect operations, Agile said.  Among stocks that rose, Sharp Corp.,  Japan ’s largest maker
of liquid crystal displays, advanced 3.9 percent to 293 yen.
Sales increased in each of the last four months from a year
earlier, helped by recovering demand for LCD televisions,
President Takashi Okuda told reporters in Osaka yesterday.  Hermes Microvision, Inc., a Taiwanese supplier of
semiconductor inspection equipment, jumped 6.9 percent to 541
yen in Taipei after reporting unconsolidated sales in December
increased 62.5 percent from a year earlier.  To contact the reporters on this story:
