Lietuvos Draudimas AB, the Lithuanian
unit of RSA Insurance Group, expects the country’s non-life
insurance market to grow by as much as 7 percent this year as
citizens in the European Union’s second-fastest growing economy
have more cash to spend.  Assuming output growth of about 3 percent,  Lithuania ’s non-
life insurance market will expand by at least 6 percent to 7
percent, Lietuvos Draudimas, Lithuania’s largest property and
casualty insurer, said in an e-mailed statement today.  “This is a young market with much opportunity and room for
business development,” the company said, adding that less than
half of private homes and fewer than a quarter of apartments in
the country have insurance.  Lithuanian insurers wrote 902 million litai ($343 million)
of non-life premiums in the first nine months of 2012, 5.4
percent more than in the same period a year earlier, the central
bank said.  Private individuals in Lithuania spent an average 437 litai
on insurance last year, which is forecast to grow 15 percent in
2013 to 501 litai per capita, according to Lietuvos Draudimas.  To contact the reporter on this story:
