China’s  yuan  climbed toward a 19-year
high on speculation the nation’s new leaders will introduce
financial reforms that support growth and attract funds to the
world’s second-largest economy.  The People’s Bank of China raised the daily  reference rate 
by 0.11 percent, the most in eight weeks, to 6.2804 per dollar.
The economy has the potential to grow 8 percent annually over
the next 20 years should the nation reduce support for state
companies and unshackle banks, Lin Yifu, a former World Bank
chief economist, said yesterday in New York. Incoming President
 Xi Jinping , due to start his 10-year term in March, has vowed to
carry out reforms in the financial markets.  This year “will be all about confidence in the management
of economic policy and economic transition insofar as the
 renminbi  is concerned,” said  Sacha Tihanyi , a Hong Kong-based
senior currency strategist at Scotiabank. “A smooth transition
would serve to bolster both confidence and investment flows.”  The yuan advanced 0.07 percent to 6.2255 per dollar at
10:14 a.m. in Shanghai, according to the China Foreign Exchange
Trade System. It touched 6.2223 on Nov. 27, the strongest level
since China unified official and market exchange rates at the
end of 1993. The currency can trade as much as 1 percent on
either side of the PBOC’s daily fixing.  A report last week showed China’s services industries
expanded at the fastest pace in four months. The gauge for the
services industries was 56.1 last month versus 55.6 in November,
official data showed. A reading above 50 indicates expansion.
Manufacturing expanded for a third month, a separate report
showed on Jan. 1.  Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards strengthened 0.12
percent to 6.3110 per dollar in  Hong Kong , a 1.4 percent
discount to the spot rate in Shanghai, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. In Hong Kong’s offshore market, the yuan
rose 0.1 percent to 6.2058.  To contact the reporter on this story:
