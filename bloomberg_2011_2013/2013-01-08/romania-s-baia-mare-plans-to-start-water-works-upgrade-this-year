Baia Mare, a town in northwestern
 Romania , will start to expand and upgrade its water and sewage
network this year under a 60 million-euro ($79 million) project
part-financed by the European Union.  More than 200 kilometers (124 miles) of pipes will undergo
work, Mayor  Catalin Chereches  said in a  statement  on the local
administration’s website. The overhaul is part of a larger
project in Maramures County valued at 120 million euros,
according to the statement.  Baia Mare plans to complete the works by the end of 2014,
Chereches said yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
