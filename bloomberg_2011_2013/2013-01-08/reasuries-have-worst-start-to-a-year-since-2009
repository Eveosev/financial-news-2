Treasuries rose on demand for the
safest securities before three sales of notes and bonds totaling
$66 billion this week, starting with a $32 billion three-year
debt auction today.  Yields on the benchmark 10-year bond fell even after the
French government called speculation of a downgrade to the
nation’s credit rating “unfounded.” The three-year notes
scheduled for sale today yielded 0.39 percent in pre-auction
trading, compared with a record low 0.327 percent at the
previous auction on Dec. 11.  “It’s a flight to safety -- that’s the rumor, that’s
what’s driving the market right now,” said  Charles Comiskey ,
head of Treasury trading at  Bank of Nova Scotia (BNS)  in New York, one
of 21 primary dealers that trade with the  Federal Reserve .  Benchmark  10-year note  yields fell three basis points, or
0.03 percentage point, to 1.87 percent as of 11:21 a.m. New York
time, based on Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The 1.625 percent
security maturing in November 2022 rose 9/32, or $2.81 per
$1,000 face value, to 97 27/32. Yields on the  30-year bond  fell
four basis points to 3.06 percent.  The current three-year yield fell one basis point to 0.37
percent after increasing to 0.42 percent on Jan. 4, the most
since Oct. 26.  Debt Auctions  At last month’s sale of three-year notes,  bidders  that buy
directly from the Treasury purchased a record 24.8 percent of
the notes, compared with 12.5 percent at the previous 10 sales.  “People are more willing to buy given the levels and the
fact that the Fed is not selling up there anymore,” said  Thomas Roth , senior Treasury trader in New York at Mitsubishi UFJ
Securities USA Inc. “Today’s auction will go fine.”  The Fed concluded at year-end its Operation Twist program
of selling shorter-term securities and purchasing longer-term
government debt, thus reducing the available supply of shorter-
term debt.  The U.S. plans to sell $21 billion of 10-year notes
tomorrow and $13 billion of 30-year bonds on Jan. 10. The
amounts are unchanged from the last time the government issued
this combination of securities in December.  The central bank purchased $3.71 billion of Treasuries due
from October 2018 to December 2019 today, according to the Fed
Bank of New York  website .  Treasuries are off to their worst start to a year since
2009, handing investors a 0.7 percent loss in 2013 as of
yesterday, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes.
It was the biggest decline for a first week since the Treasury
was preparing to ramp up debt sales four years ago as it tried
to snap a recession.  Statutory Limit  Bonds slid last week after “several” Fed officials said
it would “probably be appropriate to slow or stop purchases
well before the end of 2013,” according to minutes of their
Dec. 11-12 meeting. The Fed said in December that it plans to
buy $45 billion of Treasuries a month in addition to $40 billion
per month of mortgage-debt purchases begun in September.  While Congress last week passed budget measures that
averted most of more than $600 billion in automatic tax
increases and federal spending cuts that were scheduled to start
this year, U.S. lawmakers will address the issue of  deficit
reduction  as they negotiate raising the  debt ceiling .  The U.S. reached the statutory limit of $16.4 trillion on
Dec. 31, and the Treasury began using extraordinary measures to
finance the government. It will exhaust that avenue as soon as
the middle of February, according to the  Congressional Budget
Office .  Bullish Bets  “A good resolution on fiscal issues will give a massive
boost to the economy, which is improving slowly but surely,”
said  Ciaran O’Hagan , head of European rates strategy at Societe
Generale SA in Paris. “Our forecast of 2.35 percent for 10-year
Treasuries by the end of the year is quite moderate, especially
given the recent move.”  Investors in Treasuries raised bullish bets in the week
ending yesterday and cut shorts, according to a survey by
JPMorgan Chase & Co.  The  proportion  of net longs was at four percentage points
in the week ending yesterday, reversing from a net short of six
percentage points in the week ending Dec. 17.  Investors raised neutral bets to 66 percent from 64
percent, the survey reported.  The percent of outright longs rose to 19 percent, from 15
percent in the week ending Dec. 17, the survey said, while the
percent of outright shorts, or bets the securities will fall in
value, dropped to 15 percent from 21 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
