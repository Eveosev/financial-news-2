Rolls-Royce Holdings Plc (RR/)  is expanding
its nuclear energy operations with the purchase of U.S.
engineering firm PKMJ Technical Services.  The acquisition for an undisclosed price aims to accelerate
growth in nuclear services, London-based Rolls-Royce said in a
statement today. It is the company’s second acquisition in the
U.S. in this industry, where it supports about half the nuclear
reactors.  Rolls-Royce, Europe’s largest maker of commercial  aircraft
engines , has been working to bolster its non-aerospace
activities in both renewable and nuclear energy. The company
last year announced a collaboration with  Hitachi Ltd. (6501)  to work on
new atomic reactors in the U.K.  “PKMJ supports every nuclear utility in the U.S. and
Canada with an impressive portfolio of services,” said Lawrie Haynes, president of Rolls’s nuclear business. The purchase
“represents another significant step towards growing our global
civil nuclear business,” he said.  Moon Township, Pennsylvania-based PKMJ employs about 100
people. The deal “provides us with an excellent platform from
which to grow the comprehensive plant optimization service that
we already provide,” PKMJ President  Paul Tobin  said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
