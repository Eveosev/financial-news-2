A GDF Suez-led group, including
Sumitomo Corp. and Abdullah Hamad Al Sagar & Brothers, won a
contract to build the Az Zour North Independent Water & Power
Project in  Kuwait .  The contract is for the construction and operation of a
1,500-megawatt gas-fired combined cycle power plant and an
associated water desalination facility with a capacity of 102 to
107 million imperial gallons a day,  GDF Suez (GSZ)  said today in an e-
mailed statement. The plant is expected to start commercial
operations in 2015, it said.  The facility will account for about 12 percent of Kuwait’s
installed power-generation capacity and about 23 percent of its
desalination capacity, according to the statement. All of the
plant’s output will be bought by the country’s Ministry of
Electricity & Water under a 40-year contract, it said. No price
was given.  To contact the reporter on this story:
