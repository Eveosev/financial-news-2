Volatility in  India ’s rupee fell to a
five-week low after overseas investors pumped money into the
nation’s stocks and bonds, helping allay concern about the
nation’s record current-account deficit.  Global funds bought $1.1 billion more Indian equities than
they sold in the first five days of this month, exchange data
show, after U.S. lawmakers averted more than $600 billion in tax
increases and spending cuts on Jan. 1. Foreign holdings of
rupee-denominated debt  rose  $238 million and touched a record on
Jan. 3. The inflows will help offset the nation’s record
current-account shortfall, according to Barclays Plc.  “There are things going in favor of the rupee, such as
ample global liquidity,” said Nick Verdi, a strategist at
Barclays in  Singapore . Volatility can fall further “because
some of the global tail risks that markets were facing are
receding, but at the same time the global economy is still
relatively soft,” he said.  One-month implied volatility, a gauge of expected moves in
exchange rates used to price options, fell eight basis points,
or 0.08 percentage point, to 9.62 percent in Mumbai, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. It earlier touched 9.5275
percent, the lowest level since Dec. 4.  The current-account deficit widened to $22.3 billion in the
quarter ended Sept. 30, government data showed Dec. 31.  The rupee advanced 0.4 percent 55.0050 per dollar, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  Three-month onshore rupee forwards traded at 56.01 per
dollar, compared with 56.20 yesterday, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Offshore non-deliverable contracts were
at 55.39, compared with 55.62 yesterday. Forwards are agreements
to buy or sell assets at a set price and date. Non-deliverable
contracts are settled in dollars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
