Kenya coffee prices climbed at the
first sale of the year after supplies declined, the Nairobi
Coffee Exchange said.  The average price for all coffee sold rose 29 percent to
$212.55 a bag, from $164.15 at the Dec. 11 sale, the exchange
said by e-mail from Nairobi, the capital, where auctions are
held. A bag weighs 50 kilograms (110 pounds).  The average price for the benchmark AA dropped 4.3 percent
to $321.67 a bag, within a range of $183 to $356 a bag, it said.  “There was fair demand as buyers were out of the market
for some time,” Mansukh Shah, a coffee trader at the Nairobi-
based Alanwood Ltd., said by phone. “The quality was average as
we still wait for the supply of better beans.”  Germany , the U.S.,  Canada , the U.K.,  Belgium , the
Netherlands,  Luxembourg ,  Sweden  and  Finland  are some of the main
importers of Kenyan beans, according to the Kenya Coffee
Producers and Traders Association, which owns the Nairobi Coffee
Exchange.  Sales at the auction more than doubled to 9,429 bags worth
$2.44 million from 4,243 bags valued at $851,663 at the previous
auction, the exchange said.  Kenya harvests an early crop from May through July, while
the main crop is reaped from September through December,
according to the Kenya traders group. The coffee season runs
from Oct. 1 through September.  The following are details of today’s auction in U.S.
