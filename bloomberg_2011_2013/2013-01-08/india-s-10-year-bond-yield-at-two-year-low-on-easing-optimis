India ’s 10-year bond yields were near
the lowest level in two years on speculation the central bank
will reduce  interest rates  this quarter to revive growth.  The  Reserve Bank  of India will lower the repurchase  rate  by
50 basis points to 7.5 percent by the end of March, after
keeping it unchanged since April, according to 11 of 20 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg. The next policy review is on Jan. 29. The
government deferred a bond auction scheduled for last week to
February after reviewing its cash position, according to a
finance ministry statement on Dec. 31.  “At current yields, investors have mostly factored in a 25
basis point cut in the repo rate this month,” said Debendra Kumar Dash, a fixed-income trader at  Development Credit Bank
Ltd. (DEVB)  in Mumbai. “Lower supplies are also favorable for bonds.”  The yield on the 8.15 percent notes due June 2022 rose one
basis point to 7.91 percent in Mumbai, according to the central
bank’s trading system. The rate was at 7.90 percent yesterday,
which was the lowest for a benchmark 10-year security since Dec.
28, 2010.  The government lowered its estimate for economic  growth  in
the year through March to as little as 5.7 percent, the least in
a decade, on Dec. 17. Reserve Bank Governor Duvvuri Subbarao
said a day later that policy makers’ focus needs to shift toward
supporting the economy from curbing inflation.  The one-year interest-rate swap, a derivative contract used
to guard against fluctuations in funding costs, fell two basis
points to 7.58 percent, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Seven
of the economists surveyed see a 25 basis point reduction at
this month’s central bank review, while one expects no change
and Woori CBV Securities Corp. predicts a quarter of a
percentage point increase.  To contact the reporter on this story:
