Japanese  shares  fell, with the  Nikkei
225 (NKY)  Stock Average capping a two-day loss, as the yen’s gain
against all its major counterparts cut the earnings outlook for
exporters.  Toyota Motor Corp., the world’s biggest automaker, declined
2 percent. Aozora Bank Ltd. dropped 4 percent, extending
yesterday’s 10 percent plunge, after confirming Cerberus Capital
Management LP is set to sell most its stake in the lender.
Nippon Building Fund Inc. slid 3.5 percent after the real estate
investment trust announced a share sale.  The Nikkei 225 slid 0.9 percent to close at 10,508.06 in
 Tokyo , with trading volume 25 percent higher than the 30-day
average. The broader  Topix (TPX)  Index fell 1 percent to 871.88.  “The yen’s weakness has been excessive and is getting
adjusted today,” said  Soichiro Monji , chief strategist at
Tokyo-based Daiwa SB Investments Ltd., which manages the
equivalent of about 6 trillion yen ($68.6 billion). “It’s no
surprise the market is experiencing a correction because the
recent rally ignored technical overheating signs.”  The Nikkei’s 14-day relative strength index was 73 today,
over the 70 threshold viewed as an indication of overheating,
after the benchmark gauge last week rose to a 22-month high. The
gauge has been over 70 for the past seven trading days.  The Topix has risen about 21 percent since Nov. 14 when
elections were announced, driving the gauge into a bull market
on expectations a new government would call for more stimulus.
An advance of 20 percent or more from a low signals a  bull
market  to some investors. The gauge is trading at 1.04 times
book value, compared with 2.19 for the  Standard & Poor’s 500
Index (SPXL1)  and 1.58 for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.  Yen Rises  Exporters dropped as the yen gained against all of its 16
major counterparts. A stronger currency cuts the value of
overseas earnings at Japanese exporters. Toyota fell 2 percent
to 4,100 yen. Nintendo Co., a maker of game players that gets 77
percent of its sales outside  Japan , slid 3.1 percent to 8,700
yen.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. raised its 12-month target for the
Topix to 1,000 from 930 amid optimism new Prime Minister Shinzo
Abe, who leads the  Liberal Democratic Party , will take measures
to bolster the economy ahead of upper house elections in July,
chief Japan strategist Kathy Matsui wrote in a note dated
yesterday.  Japan’s latest stimulus plan will top 20 trillion yen when
local government and private funds are included, the Nikkei
newspaper reported today.  ‘Policy Action’  “Market expectations for policy action are likely to last
until the biggest event of this year, which is whether the LDP
coalition can win back a majority in the upper house,” Monji at
Daiwa SB said.  Futures on the  S&P 500  dropped 0.1 percent today. The gauge
slid 0.3 percent in  New York  yesterday, retreating from a five-
year high as investors await the beginning of earnings season.  The  Nikkei Stock Average Volatility Index (VNKY)  dropped 6.6
percent to 19.15, indicating traders expect a swing of about 5.5
percent on the benchmark gauge over the next 30 days.  Aozora dropped 4 percent to 240 yen after saying Cerberus
will sell as many as 632.5 million shares at a price to be
determined as soon as Jan. 16.  Nippon Building Fund declined 3.5 percent to 892,000 yen as
it plans to raise up to 66.7 billion yen from a public share
sale.  To contact the reporter on this story:
