The  University of Alabama  defeated
the University of Notre Dame 42-14 to claim college footballâ€™s
national championship for the second straight year.  The victory at Sun Life Stadium in Miami gives the second-
ranked Crimson Tide (13-1) their third Bowl Championship Series
title in four years, while securing a seventh straight victory
in the game for Southeastern Conference teams.  Alabama coach Nick Saban has now taken the title four
times, his previous wins coming with the Crimson Tide in 2010
and 2012, and with  Louisiana State University  in 2003.  The top-ranked Fighting Irish (12-1) were seeking a 12th
national title and first since they last went undefeated in
1988.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
