Taiwan said it will seek to lure
NT$150 billion ($5.17 billion) in returning investment in 2013
from Taiwanese companies with overseas operations, as PresidentMa Ying-jeou strives to bolster economic growth.  The island will provide benefits such as lower tariffs on
equipment imports and higher quotas for hiring foreign workers
to achieve the goal, Duh Tyzz-Jiun, deputy minister at the
Ministry of Economic Affairs, said in Taipei today.  Maâ€™s government aims to spur an economy that the
 International Monetary Fund  estimates expanded 1.3 percent last
year, the  weakest pace  since the 2009 global recession. The
president said yesterday that Taiwan will try to liberalize its
business environment and deepen international trade links.  The island has so far approved eight applications for
returning investment, including from Largan Precision Co. and
Catcher Technology Co., worth a total of NT$110 billion over
three years and adding 15,000 jobs, according to the ministry.  The government originally outlined objectives for
attracting investment last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
