Cantor Fitzgerald LP, the brokerage
whose credit rating was cut twice last year, faces another
potential downgrade amid a slump in trading, Fitch Ratings said.  Fitch may lower Cantor’s credit grade from BBB, which is
two levels above junk, the ratings company said today in a
report. Revenue has declined for Cantor’s institutional equity
business and inter-dealer broker affiliate  BGC Partners Inc. (BGCP)   “Cantor’s institutional business and BGC’s financial
brokerage business will remain challenged in the medium term
because of lower trading volume,” Mohak Rao, a Fitch analyst,
wrote in the report. The rating may be lowered if Cantor’s
profits decline and it doesn’t pay down its debts, Rao wrote.  Cantor, led by Chief Executive Officer Howard Lutnick, 51,
has been expanding from its historical role as a middleman for
stocks and bonds into mortgages,  emerging markets , commercial
real estate and casino gambling. Moody’s Investors Service
reduced New York-based Cantor to junk in October after the
brokerage stopped providing it with information.  Standard & Poor’s last month cut Cantor one level to BBB-
from BBB, saying competition and the firm’s expansion plans are
pressuring profit. Cantor is a private partnership and doesn’t
report financial results.  To contact the reporter on this story:
