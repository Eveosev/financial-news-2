Natura Cosmeticos SA (NATU3)  fell the most in
three months after the Brazilian cosmetics company disclosed
that the government has ordered it to pay 627.9 million reais
($308.7 million) in back taxes.  Shares slumped 4.7 percent to 55.20 reais, the steepest
decline on a closing basis since Sept. 20. The benchmark Bovespa
index retreated 1.3 percent.  Natura, based in Itapecerica Da Serra, said in a regulatory
filing late yesterday that  Brazil ’s tax authority accused the
company of using incorrect prices to calculate the levy paid in
2008, and it must now pay the difference. Natura said it is
appealing the order because it can prove that “the procedures
adopted are legitimate,” according to the filing.  “The charges could strongly impact Natura’s results and
dividends if they are really applied,” Marcelo Varejao, an
analyst at brokerage Socopa Corretora, said by phone from  Sao
Paulo . “But this is a process that should take some time, and
the company already said it is going to defend itself.”  The company reported adjusted net income that rose 18
percent in the third quarter to 237.3 million reais from the
same period in 2011. Its dividend yield during the three-month
period was 2.63 percent, below the average of 2.68 percent of 68
companies on the benchmark Bovespa index.  Natura has risen 50 percent in the past year, while the
benchmark index gained 4.3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
