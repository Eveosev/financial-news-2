South Korea ’s workforce expanded last
month, with the  unemployment rate  unchanged from November as
jobs increased in manufacturing and in the service sector.  The  jobless rate  was at 3 percent in December, Statistics
Korea said in an e-mailed statement from Sejong, south of Seoul.
The median estimate in a  Bloomberg News  survey of 11 economists
was for a rate of 3 percent. The number of employed people
increased by 277,000, or 1.1 percent, to 24.4 million last month
from a year earlier.  Incoming President Park Geun Hye has vowed to make it more
difficult for companies to fire employees and to increase
assistance for low-income workers burdened with record  household
debt . The nation will create 320,000 jobs this year, the  Finance
Ministry  said in a Dec. 27 report, down from an estimated
440,000 million new positions in 2012.  “The unemployment rate looks good, but it is unlikely to
help lift domestic consumption,” Ma Ju Ok, an economist at
Kiwoom Securities Co. in Seoul said before the release. “There
are many workers in temporary positions.”  The ranks of self-employed increased to 5.7 million as of
last month, from 5.6 million in December 2011, according to the
most recent report from Statistics Korea.  South Korea’s won is Asia’s best-performing currency this
year, dragging on exports that unexpectedly fell in December for
the first time in three months. The won strengthened 0.1 percent
to 1,062.90 per dollar yesterday in Seoul.  Seasonally Unadjusted  The seasonally unadjusted jobless rate was at 2.9 percent
in December, up 0.1 percent from November, today’s report
showed.  The  Bank of Korea  meets to decide  interest rates  on Jan.
11, with 13 of 14 economists  surveyed  by Bloomberg News
predicting the policy rate to remain unchanged at 2.75 percent.
Park, who takes office next month, plans a fiscal boost in the
first half of the year by allocating 72 percent of budget
spending for 2013, or about $200 billion.  “The central bank is likely to wait for the incoming
administration’s policies to become clear,” Ma said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
