PSA Peugeot Citroen (UG) ’s banking unit
sold 3.1 billion euros ($4 billion) in asset-backed securities
in 2012 to help its effort to boost financing and end market
share losses in Europe’s slumping car market.  The funds were raised in issues last year in  France , the
U.K., Spain and Italy, the Paris-based manufacturer said today
in a statement. The sales of the bonds were part of an 11.5
billion-euro refinancing program to shore up the Paris-based
manufacturer’s Banque PSA Finance unit, spokesman Jean-Baptiste Mounier said by phone.  The unit, which provides loans to dealers and car buyers,
“increased the share of its funding undertaken through its
securitization program, thereby demonstrating its ability to
strengthen and diversify its funding sources,” the company said
in the statement.  Peugeot, Europe’s second-largest carmaker, has struggled to
match loan rates offered by cash-rich  Volkswagen AG. (VOW)  Peugeot
deliveries in the region fell 13 percent through November, and
its market share narrowed to 11.7 percent from 12.5 percent a
year earlier, according to European carmaking lobby ACEA. VW’s
market share rose to 24.9 percent from 23.3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
