Telefonica SA bonds fell in Europe as
 Spain ’s largest phone company offered 1.5 billion euros ($2
billion) of 10-year securities.  The company’s 4.71 percent notes due 2020 fell 0.4 percent
to 108.57 cents on the euro, one of the worst performers in Bank
of America Merrill Lynch’s Euro Non-Financial Corporate Index.
That sent the yield premium to benchmark government debt up six
basis points to 235, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  The Madrid-based company is taking advantage of a rally in
credit markets that has pushed relative yields on corporate
bonds to the lowest since January 2008. The spread over
sovereign debt has fallen to 136 basis points, according to Bank
of America Merrill Lynch’s Euro Corporate  index , compared with
301 basis points at the start of 2012.  “The issuer is plugging into the favorable environment and
locking in longer-term funding while the iron is hot, and it
will probably stay hot,” said  Suki Mann , a strategist at
Societe Generale SA in  London . “There’s not enough supply and
huge demand.”  Investors are hungry for securities from companies in
Europe’s weakest nations as they seek higher returns from
riskier assets. The relative spread of euro periphery non-
financial companies is at its lowest since July 2011, according
to Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s Euro Periphery Non-Financial
Index.  Credit-Default Swaps  The cost of insuring against default on Telefonica debt has
tumbled to an 18-month low, with credit-default swaps dropping
to 208 basis points from a record 572.5 in June.  The new bonds are being marketed with a spread of 230 basis
points more than the benchmark mid-swap rate, according to
bankers involved in the deal.  It’s only the third 10-year offering from a peripheral
issuer since the beginning of last year, and only the fifth
since the start of 2011, according SocGen’s Mann.  In credit derivatives markets, the cost of insuring
European corporate debt fell. The Markit iTraxx Crossover Index
of credit-default swaps linked to 50 companies with mostly high-
yield credit ratings declined 5.5 basis points to 424 basis
points.  The Markit iTraxx  Europe  Index of 125 companies with
investment-grade ratings declined 1.5 to 101 basis points. The
Markit iTraxx Financial Index linked to senior debt of 25 banks
and insurers fell 3.5 basis points to 119 and the subordinated
index declined seven to 196.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($13.1 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer
face value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
