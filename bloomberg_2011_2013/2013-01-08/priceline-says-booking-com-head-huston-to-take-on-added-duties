Priceline.com Inc. (PCLN) , the most valuable
online-travel agency, said the head of its Booking.com unit will
take on additional duties as its international business becomes
an increasingly dominant part of the company.  Darren Huston, who was named chief executive officer of
Booking.com in 2011, will also manage relations between
Priceline’s brands, coordinate relationships with affiliates and
suppliers, and handle strategic development for global
expansion, the Norwalk, Connecticut-based company said today in
a statement.  Huston, a former vice president at Microsoft Corp., took
over Booking.com after founder Kees Koolen stepped down. Since
acquiring Amsterdam-based Booking.com in 2005, Priceline’s
annual revenue has jumped more than fivefold, based on  estimates 
for 2012 revenue. The company’s international business  accounted 
for 71 percent of revenue in the third quarter, up from 66
percent a year earlier.  Priceline was  little changed  today at $657.42 at the close
in  New York . The stock has climbed 37 percent in the past year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
