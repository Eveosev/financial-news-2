The fire aboard a  Boeing Co. (BA)  787
Dreamliner in  Boston  yesterday caused “severe damage” to a
battery unit, U.S. investigators said today.  The battery, located in an electronics bay in the belly of
the new Japan Airlines Co. jet, triggered thermal damage to
equipment and the plane’s structure, according to the  National
Transportation Safety Board .  The damage was confined to within about 20 inches of the
battery pack, the agency said in its first statement since
opening an investigation into the fire.  The blaze aboard Boeing’s newest model is the latest issue
for a jet plagued by incidents since entering commercial service
in late 2011.  A previous fire in an equipment bay forced the test fleet
to be parked in 2010. Electrical faults in December forced
 United Continental Holdings Inc. (UAL)  and Qatar Airways Ltd. to
ground 787s, the first jet with a fuselage made chiefly of
composite materials instead of aluminum and with an all-electric
power system.  Airport firefighters extinguished the blaze after a
maintenance worker saw smoke in the cabin as the jet sat at a
Logan International Airport gate before its next departure,
Massachusetts Port Authority Fire Chief Robert Donahue said in
an interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
