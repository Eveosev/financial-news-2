The  Washington Nationals  have re-
signed Adam LaRoche to a two-year agreement after the first
baseman hit a career-high 33 home runs last season.  The 33-year-old’s new contract includes a mutual option for
the 2015 season, the Major League Baseball franchise announced
today in an e-mailed release. While financial terms of the
agreement were not released by the team, MLB.com reported today
that the deal is worth  $24 million .  LaRoche hit .271 with 100 runs batted in last season, his
second with the Nationals. He also won the Gold Glove as the
National League’s best defensive first baseman.  In nine MLB seasons with the Nationals, Arizona
Diamondbacks, Atlanta Braves, Boston Red Sox and Pittsburgh
Pirates, LaRoche has hit .268 with 197 home runs and 684 RBIs.
He is one of four active players to hit at least 25 home runs
with four different teams, according to the release, joining
 Adrian Beltre  of the Texas Rangers, Alfonso Soriano of the
Chicago Cubs and free agent  Jim Thome .  To contact the reporter on this story:
