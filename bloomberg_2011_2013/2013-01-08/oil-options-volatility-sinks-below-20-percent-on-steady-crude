Oil options volatility fell to the
lowest level since at least 2006 as the underlying futures were
little changed for the fourth straight day.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
February, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a
gauge of options prices, was 19.79 percent at 3:25 p.m. on the
 New York Mercantile Exchange , down from 21.19 percent yesterday.
That’s the lowest level in data compiled by Bloomberg going back
to March 22, 2006.  Crude oil for February delivery fell 4 cents to $93.15 a
barrel on the Nymex. It’s the fourth day in a row that
settlement prices moved 20 cents or less.  The most active options in electronic trading today were
March $110 calls, which slipped 1 cent to 9 cents a barrel on
volume of 2,536 contracts. The second-most active, with 2,255
lots exchanged, were February $90 puts, down 11 cents to 24
cents a barrel.  Bets that prices would fall, or puts, accounted for 54
percent of electronic trading volume.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on open-
outcry volume, where the bulk of options activity occurs.  In the previous session, puts accounted for 56 percent of
volume.  March $78 puts were the most active options yesterday, with
8,558 contracts trading as they fell 2 cents to 15 cents a
barrel. March $73 puts slipped 1 cent to 6 cents a barrel on
3,091 lots.  Open interest was highest for February $105 calls with
32,421 contracts. Next were March $70 puts at 27,580 lots and
February $110 calls with 25,916.  To contact the reporter on this story:
