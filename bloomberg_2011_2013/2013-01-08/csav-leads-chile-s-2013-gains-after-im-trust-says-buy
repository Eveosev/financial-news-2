Cia. Sud Americana de Vapores SA ,
 Latin America ’s largest shipping company, rose to a four-month
high as brokerage IM Trust SA assigned a buy rating after a
fleet overhaul that began early last year lowered costs.  CSAV jumped 4.4 percent to 51 pesos at 10:04 a.m. in
Santiago, the highest intraday level since Sept. 14. It was the
fifth straight increase, bringing this year’s gain to 19
percent, the most among members of  Chile ’s benchmark index.  Shares of CSAV, which is based in Valparaiso and controlled
by Chile’s richest family, probably will reach 70 pesos by year-
end, analysts Ignacio Spencer and Francisca Manuschevich wrote
in an e-mailed report today.  “We consider as positive the company’s increasing exposure
to trades where it has competitive advantages, such as South
American routes,” the analysts said. CSAV’s young fleet, with
an average age of three years, will generate an “attractive”
level of cash, IM Trust said.  The company also has moved to cut unprofitable routes and
reduce dependence on leased vessels, the analysts said.  CSAV lost $290 million during the first nine months of
2012, compared with a loss of $868 million a year earlier.  CSAV is controlled by heirs of founder Andronico Luksic,
with his son Guillermo serving as chairman. Andronico Luksic’s
widow,  Iris Fontbona , is ranked 31st in the Bloomberg
Billionaire’s Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
