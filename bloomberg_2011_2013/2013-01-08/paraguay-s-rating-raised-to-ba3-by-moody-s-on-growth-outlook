Paraguay’s credit rating was boosted
one level by Moody’s Investors Service, which cited the
country’s “improved medium-term growth prospects.”  Moody’s raised the nation’s rating to Ba3, three levels
below investment grade and in line with that of El Salvador and
Nigeria. The outlook on the rating is stable, Moody’s said in a
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
