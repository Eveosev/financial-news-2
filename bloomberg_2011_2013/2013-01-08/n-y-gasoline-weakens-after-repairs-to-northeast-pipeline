Gasoline in  New York  harbor weakened
for a fourth day after Colonial Pipeline Co. completed repairs
to a line that carries products to the U.S. Northeast.  Line 3, from Greensboro,  North Carolina , to Linden,  New
Jersey , resumed normal operation yesterday following pump
repairs that resulted in about a day of lost delivery, the
company said yesterday in a bulletin to shippers.  The segment can carry 825,000 barrels a day of gasoline and
other fuels including diesel. Repairs were initially scheduled
for completion last week but were delayed when Colonial found
“significant damage” to a pump.  Reformulated gasoline to be blended with ethanol in New
York Harbor narrowed  0.25 cent  to 3.63 a gallon above futures on
the  New York Mercantile Exchange  as of 2:29 p.m., according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Conventional,  87-octane gasoline 
weakened 1 cent to 4.38 cents over futures.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel ’s premium narrowed 0.25 cent to
4.13 over heating oil futures, the lowest level since Dec. 31.
The same fuel strengthened 0.63 cent to trade at a discount of 2
cents versus futures in the U.S. Gulf Coast. Reformulated, 84-
octane gasoline in the region strengthened 3.25 cents to  4.75
cents below futures .  Gulf Coast products advanced after Motiva Enterprises LLC
shut a 325,000-barrel-a-day crude unit at its Port Arthur,
Texas, refinery. The pipestill shut after a small leak Jan. 6,
according to Kimberly Windon, a Houston-based spokeswoman for
the plant.  To contact the reporter on this story:
