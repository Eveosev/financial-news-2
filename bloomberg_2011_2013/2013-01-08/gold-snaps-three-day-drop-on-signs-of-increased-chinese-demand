Gold gained, rebounding from a three-
day drop that touched the lowest price in more than four months,
on signs of increased demand in  China  and as the dollar weakened.  Spot gold rose as much as 0.4 percent to $1,653.05 an ounce,
and was at $1,649.68 at 4:28 p.m. in Singapore. Volumes for cash
bullion of 99.99 percent purity on the Shanghai Gold Exchange
surged to 19,504.8 kilograms yesterday, according to a statement
on the bourse’s website. That’s the highest ever for the
benchmark contract, according to data tracked by Bloomberg.  Cash bullion slumped to $1,625.85 on Jan. 4, the cheapest
since Aug. 21, after minutes from the U.S. Federal Reserve
indicated that policy makers may end the bank’s bond-buying
program this year, boosting the  Dollar Index (DXY)  to a six-week high.
The six-currency gauge fell for a second day today on
speculation recent declines in the euro and yen were excessive.  “The recent price drop has attracted some purchases,
evidenced by the volumes in China,” said Feng Liang, an analyst
at GF Futures Co., a unit of China’s third-biggest listed
brokerage. “Whether this rebound can be sustained depends on
the emergence of physical buyers, especially from China and
 India , at a time when demand is meant to be strong.”  In China, demand typically picks up before Christmas and
lasts through the Lunar New Year in February. India’s wedding
season, a peak-consumption period for gold jewelry, runs from
November to December and from late March through early May. The
countries are the two biggest bullion consumers.  China Volumes  Cash bullion of 99.99 percent purity retreated 0.6 percent
to 331.50  yuan  a gram ($1,656.25 an ounce) on the Shanghai Gold
Exchange. Yesterday’s record volumes followed the one-year high
of 9,309 kilograms on Jan. 4. Gold for June delivery slid 0.6
percent to 336.53 yuan a gram on the Shanghai Futures Exchange.  Gold for February delivery advanced 0.1 percent to
$1,648.60 an ounce on the Comex. Metal in exchange-traded
products, which reached an all-time high of 2,632.516 metric
tons on Dec. 20, stood at 2,622.301 tons on Jan. 7 after SPDR
Gold Trust Holdings updated its figures to show a drop of 1.35
tons, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Cash silver was little changed at $30.1075 an ounce, after
dropping to the lowest since August on Jan. 4. Spot platinum was
also little changed at $1,556 an ounce after three days of
losses. Palladium fell 0.3 percent to $668.25 an ounce.  To contact the reporter on this story:
