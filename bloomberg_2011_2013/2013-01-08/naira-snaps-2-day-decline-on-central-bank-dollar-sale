Nigeria’s naira strengthened the most
in three months after the state-owned  oil company  was said to
have sold dollars to lenders.  The currency of  Africa ’s biggest oil producer rallied 0.6
percent to 156.1000 a dollar as of 4:16 p.m. in Lagos, the
biggest gain on a closing basis since Oct. 4, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The currency lost 0.4 percent last week.  Nigerian National Petroleum Corp. periodically sells
dollars to lenders to meet local spending needs. The oil
industry is the second-biggest source of foreign currency after
the  Central Bank of Nigeria , which sells dollars at auctions on
Mondays and Wednesday. The central bank sold $150 million
yesterday in its first sale this year.  NNPC sold an undisclosed amount of dollars to banks today,
which supported the naira, Augustus Nwachukwu, an analyst at
Lagos-based Stanbic IBTC Holdings Co., said by phone. Tumini
Green, an NNPC spokesman, had no immediate comment when
contacted by Bloomberg.  Nigeria  plans to sell 166 billion naira ($1.1 billion) of
91-, 182- and 364-day Treasury bills at an auction Jan. 10, the
central bank said yesterday.  “The naira is supported by central bank dollar supply and
inflows for the purchase of Treasury bills,” Sewa Wusu, analyst
at Lagos-based Sterling Capital Ltd., said by phone.  The rate on the nation’s 10-year naira debt fell 24 basis
points to 11.28 percent, according to yesterday’s prices
compiled on the Financial Markets Dealers Association website.
Yields on the country’s $500 million of Eurobonds due January
2021 slid seven basis points to 3.854 percent.  The Monetary Policy Committee left the benchmark  interest
rate  unchanged at 12 percent last year. Nigeria’s  inflation  rate
rose for a second month in November to 12.3 percent from 11.7
percent, the  National Bureau of Statistics  said Dec. 17.  Ghana ’s cedi strengthened 0.4 percent to 1.8895 per dollar
in Accra, the capital.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
