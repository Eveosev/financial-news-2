Indonesian tycoons Edwin Soeryadjaya
and Sandiaga Uno are considering an initial public offering for
their private equity firm Saratoga Investama Sedaya, five people
with knowledge of the matter said.  The deal may raise at least $200 million, and investment
banks presented proposals to manage the IPO last month in
Jakarta, said two of the people, asking not to be identified as
the information is private. Saratoga, which may start the share
sale in mid-2013, will probably choose banks to arrange the
offering this month, one person said.  Saratoga, founded in 1998 by Soeryadjaya and Uno, oversees
more than $2 billion according to its  website . It closed its
third fund in May 2012. Among Saratoga’s investments are  PT
Adaro Energy (ADRO) ,  Indonesia ’s second-largest coal producer, and  PT
Tower Bersama Group (TBIG) , a provider of telecommunications
infrastructure.  Saratoga would become the first private equity firm with
shares traded in Jakarta, data compiled by Bloomberg show. At
$200 million it would be Indonesia’s biggest since PT MNC Sky
Vision’s $228 million sale in June last year, the data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
