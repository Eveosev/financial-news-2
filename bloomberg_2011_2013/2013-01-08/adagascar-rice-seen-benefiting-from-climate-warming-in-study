Madagascar’s rice growers are
expected to benefit from climate change as warmer weather boosts
yields, French agriculture researcher Cirad said.  Farmers in the island’s highlands grow rain-fed rice at the
lower limit of the crop’s temperature tolerance, meaning a
warmer climate will accelerate flowering and grain maturity, the
Paris-based researcher wrote in an  online report  today.  “This is the opposite of what should happen in southern
 Asia , where rice is grown at the upper limit of its temperature
tolerance and where the yields should undergo a general
decline,” Cirad wrote.  Researchers at Cirad and Malagasy agronomy institute Fofifa
used a computer model to simulate rice yields in Madagascar from
2010 through to 2099, according to the report. The results were
“surprising,” according to Cirad.  “The most pessimistic climate scenario is also that which
allows for the best yields,” Cirad said.  In the model with the greatest climate change effects,
average rice yields of 5,478 kilograms (12,077 pounds) per
hectare (2.47 acres) increased by 576 kilograms, according to
the report. The researchers said the study didn’t take into
account biotic limitations or violent weather events.  To contact the reporter on this story:
