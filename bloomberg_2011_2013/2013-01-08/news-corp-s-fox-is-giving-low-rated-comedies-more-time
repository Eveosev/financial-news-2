News Corp.’s Fox broadcast network is
sticking with the low-rated new comedies “Ben and Kate” and
“The Mindy Project” to give the shows more time to attract
audiences.  “Our shows weren’t rejected,”  Kevin Reilly , chairman of
entertainment at Fox, said today at a TV critics’ conference in
 Pasadena ,  California . “They weren’t even sampled.”  The shows will become hits as audiences discover them,
Reilly said. DVRs and on-demand viewing extend the time it takes
for programs to establish audiences, he said. Fox’s regular
schedule was interrupted 18 times in the first month of the TV
season because of Major League Baseball coverage and other
program changes.  “That level of interruption hit ‘Glee,’ where the show was
on four weeks, off four weeks,” Reilly said. “That means some
of these shows just haven’t gotten on viewers’ radar.”  “The Goodwin Games,” a comedy originally slated for a
January start, is being pushed back to March or later to give
the shows that began in September more time on the air, Reilly
said.  Through Dec. 30, Fox’s audience was down 23 percent in
total viewers for the season that began in September, according
to data from Nielsen. Its audience of 18-to-49-year-olds, a
demographic targeted by marketers, was also down by that amount.  News Corp. (NWSA)  fell 0.3 percent to $26.13 at the close in  New
York . The Class A stock gained 43 percent last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
