Greece ’s economic indicators signal
its recession may have bottomed out amid a drop in yields and a
surge in shares, Jan von Gerich at Nordea Bank AB said.  “Greece is starting to see some light at the end of the
tunnel,” von Gerich, Helsinki-based chief analyst for fixed
income at the Nordic region’s biggest bank, wrote in a note to
clients today. “Some economic data is starting to indicate the
worst being behind for the Greek economy.”  Economic confidence  in Greece rose to the highest level in
almost three years in December, the European Commission said
today. Still, the country, which has received two international
bailouts since 2010, is facing a sixth year of recession, even
as the euro-area debt crisis shows signs of easing.  The yield on Greece’s 2 percent 2023 bond has slid to 11.2
percent from 28 percent in July and the spread with German
securities of similar maturity has narrowed. The Athens Stock
Exchange General Index has gained 54 percent over the past six
months.  “These moves can very well continue,” von Gerich said.
Even so, “notable setbacks will be seen in the way.”  Greek policy makers have implemented austerity measures and
undertaken reforms to make the economy more competitive. Greece
is also seeking to sell state assets.  “The country has a long way to go in reforming its
economy, but it is not an impossible task,” von Gerich said.
“With enough patience and determination, also the Greek economy
could soon see at least somewhat better times ahead.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
