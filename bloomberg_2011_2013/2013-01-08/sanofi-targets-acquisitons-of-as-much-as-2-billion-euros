Sanofi (SAN) , France’s largest drugmaker,
will target “bolt-on” acquisitions in a price range of
1 billion euros to 2 billion euros, Chief Executive Officer
 Chris Viehbacher  said.  “We will continue to acquire in emerging markets,”
Viehbacher said today at the JPMorgan Chase & Co. health-care
conference in San Francisco. Viehbacher declined to comment on
whether Sanofi is interested in buying Bausch & Lomb, an eye-
care company said to be for sale by Warburg Pincus LLC for at
least $10 billion.  The Paris-based company still prefers returning cash to
shareholders through dividends rather than large share buyback
programs, Chief Financial Officer Jerome Contamine said during
an appearance with Viehbacher at a question-and-answer session
with analysts and investors.  To contact the reporter on this story:
