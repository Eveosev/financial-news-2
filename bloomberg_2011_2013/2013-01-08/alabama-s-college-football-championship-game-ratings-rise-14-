Television ratings for the University
of Alabama’s second consecutive college football national
championship victory rose 14 percent from a year earlier,
according to ESPN.  The  Walt Disney Co. (DIS)  network said the Crimson Tide’s 42-14
rout of the  University of Notre Dame  in Miami Gardens, Florida,
produced a 15.7 overnight rating, up from last year’s 13.8
rating for Alabama’s 21-0 win over Louisiana State University.  The rating was down 2.5 percent from the 16.1 rating for
the 2011 championship game between  Auburn University  and the
 University of Oregon . Overnight ratings measure audience size in
the biggest U.S. media markets.  Alabama became the third school since 1936 to win college
football’s national championship three times in a four-year span
with its win over the previously undefeated Irish.  It’s the 11th consensus national championship for Alabama,
which becomes the first school in the 15-year history of the
Bowl Championship Series to win consecutive titles. The Crimson
Tide, who finished the season 13-1, also won BCS championships
following the 2009 and 2011 seasons.  Notre Dame  finished 12-1 and was denied its first national
championship since 1988.  To contact the reporter on this story:
