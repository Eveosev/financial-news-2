The price of Mongolian mutton, the
nation’s staple food, rose 5.9 percent this month because of
increased gasoline costs, news website News.mn reported.  Mutton prices have risen to 6,614-6,800 tugrik ($4.75-4.89)
a kilogram, the news website reported yesterday, citing
estimates from Jan. 2 that it didn’t attribute. The price of a
liter of gasoline has reached 1,670 tugrik, an increase of 50
tugrik since the end of last year, according to the report.  Mongolia’s central bank at the end of last year gave the
country’s fuel importers 83 billion tugrik of loans after the
companies said they may have to increase gasoline prices to as
much as 2,010 tugrik, News.mn reported. As a result of the
loans, gasoline prices rose by only 50 tugrik, the news website
reported, citing O. Magnai, head of the Ulan Bator-based
Authority for Fair Competition and Consumer Protection.  Beef prices have risen as much as 3.1 percent, goat meat
has increased 3.7 percent and horse meat has gained 0.2 percent,
according to News.mn. Oil traded today near the highest level in
almost four months in  New York .  The price increase for gasoline was “reasonable,” the
report cited Magnai as saying. He was also cited as saying the
cost for diesel and other fuels could see further increases.  Mongolia’s long winters, dry climate and nomadic culture
have largely limited the growth of crops, which has resulted in
mutton become the cornerstone of traditional meals.  To contact the reporter on this story:
