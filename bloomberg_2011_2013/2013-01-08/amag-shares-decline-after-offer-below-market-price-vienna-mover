AMAG Austria Metall AG (AMAG) , an Austrian
aluminum-products maker, fell the most in more than seven months
after a mandatory takeover offer by two of the company’s biggest
shareholders was less than its current market price.  The  shares  dropped as much as 7.5 percent to 22.75 euros,
the biggest intraday drop since May 24. The stock was down 5
percent at 23.36 euros as of 12:09 p.m. in Vienna, giving the
company a market value of 823 million euros ($1.08 billion).  B&C Industrieholding GmbH, an Austrian non-profit
foundation’s investment vehicle, said yesterday it plans to
offer AMAG investors 20.81 euros a share plus their 2012
dividend. The compulsory offer was triggered after B&C and
 Oberbank AG (OBS)  announced that they’d combine holdings to support
the company. They’ll own 35 percent of AMAG after merging their
respective 29.99 percent and 5.01 percent stakes.  “The new investment vehicle does not intend to acquire all
AMAG shares and plans no squeeze out,” Christian Obst, an
analyst at Baader Bank who advises investors to buy AMAG shares,
wrote in a research note. “We do believe that AMAG will remain
a stock listed company.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
