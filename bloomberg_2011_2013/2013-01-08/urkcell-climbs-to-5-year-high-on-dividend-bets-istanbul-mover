Turkcell Iletisim Hizmetleri AS (TCELL) 
climbed to the highest level in almost five years amid
speculation that  Turkey ’s biggest mobile-phone company may pay
the first dividend since 2010 this year.  The shares rose 1.3 percent to 11.90 liras, the highest
since April 2008, at the close today in Istanbul. The gains came
one day after Bank of America Merrill Lynch said dividend
recovery could “drive Turkcell’s investment case” this year.
Shares traded were more than three times the three-month daily
average volume, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  A battle over Turkcell’s management between owners
Istanbul-based Cukurova Holding, Moscow-based Altimo and
Sweden’s  TeliaSonera AB (TLSN)  has obstructed dividend payments since
2010. The company may pay dividends for the period “sooner
rather than later,” Bank of America Merrill Lynch analysts
including Ali Yavuz Birdal and Michael Harris said in a report
yesterday, estimating a dividend yield of 12.8 percent for 2012
and 5.8 percent for 2013.  “With investors shifting toward relatively cheaper stocks,
Turkcell’s dividend story might be coming to the fore,” Haydar Acun, the chief executive officer of Istanbul-based Sardis
Securities, said by phone today. “A dividend yield of more than
10 percent is serious stuff in a place where annual inflation is
about 6 percent.”  Turkcell is trading at 13.5 times earnings, compared with
30.8 times for Cairo-based  Orascom Telecom Holding (ORTE) , and 14.7
times for  Poland ’s Telekomunikacja Polska, according to  data
compiled by Bloomberg . The  Istanbul Stock Exchange ’s National
100 Index is trading at an average price-to-earnings ratio of
12.2, the data show.  Sixteen analysts recommend buying Turkcell shares, 11 say
hold and one says sell, according to  data compiled by Bloomberg .  To contact the reporter on this story:
