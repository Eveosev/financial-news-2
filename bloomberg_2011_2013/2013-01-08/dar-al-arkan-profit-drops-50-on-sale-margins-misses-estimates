Dar Al Arkan Real Estate Development
Co. (ALARKAN)  reported a 50 percent decline in fourth-quarter profit,
missing analysts’ estimates, as lower margins on sales hurt the
biggest publicly traded Saudi property company by assets.  Net income dropped to 144 million riyals ($38 million) from
290 million riyals, the Riyadh-based company said in a  statement 
to the Saudi stock market today. The mean estimate of five
analysts was for a profit of 252 million riyals, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Profit fell mainly due to “lower gross margins on property
sales which are attributable to the geographical location of the
properties, higher operating expenses and finance costs,”
according to the company statement. Revenue grew 8 percent to
876.9 million riyals.  Dar Al Arkan has posted decline in profit for the past
three years as properties companies compete to benefit from
increased  government spending  on housing and infrastructure
projects. The kingdom is opening up its  property market  and
introduced a new mortgage law last year.  The shares climbed 14 percent in 2012 compared with a 6
percent increase for the benchmark Tadawul All Share Index. Nine
analysts say to buy the stock, while seven recommend holding it,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
