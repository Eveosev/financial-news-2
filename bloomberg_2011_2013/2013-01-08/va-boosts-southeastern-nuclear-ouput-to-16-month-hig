The  Tennessee Valley Authority  raised
production at the 1,126-megawatt Sequoyah 2 reactor for a third
day, boosting nuclear output in the Southeast to the highest
level in  16 months .  Total U.S. generation gained 0.5 percent from yesterday to
93,251 megawatts, or  91 percent  of capacity, according to U.S.
Nuclear Regulatory Commission data compiled by Bloomberg. Output
was 3.2 percent less than a year ago with six of 104 nuclear
reactors offline.  TVA increased Sequoyah 2 to 97 percent of capacity early
today, compared with  56 percent  yesterday. The unit, which is
situated about 17 miles (27 kilometers) northeast of
Chattanooga,  Tennessee , is returning to full power after
completing refueling and maintenance that began Oct. 15.  The reactor’s gain led generation higher by 1.5 percent to
30,007 megawatts in the Southeast, the highest level since Aug.
22, 2011, commission data compiled by Bloomberg show. The
Southeast, the  NRC’s Region 2 , covers an area from  Florida  to
 Virginia  and west to Mississippi.  Output rose by 66 megawatts to 20,957 megawatts in the
Midwest, or  Region 3 , on an increase in output at  Xcel Energy
Inc. (XEL) ’s Prairie Island 1 reactor in  Minnesota . The 551-megawatt
unit operated at  93 percent  of power from 81 percent yesterday.  Reactor maintenance shutdowns, usually undertaken in the
U.S. spring or fall when energy use is lowest, may increase
consumption of natural gas and coal to generate electricity. The
average refueling down time was 43 days in 2011, according to
the  Nuclear Energy Institute .  To contact the reporter on this story:
