China , the world’s largest carbon
emitter due to its dependence on coal, plans to add 49 gigawatts
of renewable-energy capacity this year in an effort to boost
power production without increasing its reliance on fossil
fuels.  China will add 21 gigawatts of hydroelectric capacity, 18
gigawatts of wind generation and 10 gigawatts of solar,
according to a  statement  today on the website of the National
Energy Administration. The agency, a unit of the National
Development Reform Commission, reported the results of a
national work meeting on energy in Beijing yesterday and was
attended by Zhang Ping, who heads the commission.  That will exceed other forecasts for China’s wind and solar
development. The country is expected to surpass  Germany  to
become the largest solar market by installing as much as 5.39
gigawatts of photovoltaic panels this year, according to a
November report from Bloomberg New Energy Finance. The London-
based research company anticipates 16.3 gigawatts of new, land-
based wind capacity in China this year.  “China must develop energy in sync with the ecosystem,
turning from excessive reliance on conventional hydrocarbon
energy to more reliance on new and renewable energy,” according
to the statement.  The world’s second-largest economy also will promote more
efficient use of coal and will develop its shale-gas and coal-
gas deposits and non-conventional oil and gas resources.  To contact the reporter on this story:
