Poland  is selling 1 billion euros
($1.3 billion) of six-year bonds today as it seeks to finance
half of this year’s borrowing needs by the end of March.  The notes maturing in 2019 may be priced to yield 65 basis
points above the benchmark mid-swap rate, according to a banker
with knowledge of the plans, who asked not to be identified as
the sale isn’t completed. The initial guidance was 65-70 basis
points, the banker said. BNP Paribas SA, HSBC Holdings Plc and
UniCredit SpA are managing the deal, the Finance Ministry said
on its website.  The European Union’s biggest eastern economy is returning
to international debt markets after selling a record $12.1
billion in foreign-currency bonds last year, the biggest amount
for a sovereign after  China , according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Poland, which seeks to finance this year’s borrowing
requirement early to protect against an escalation in the euro
region’s crisis, last sold 10-year notes in euros in November.  “We can carry out such a sale because of interest for our
bonds from foreign investors as well as the limited size of our
offer,” Deputy Finance Minister Wojciech Kowalczyk said in an
e-mailed statement today.  The extra yield on Poland’s euro bonds due in June 2018
over the mid-swap rate dropped to a record low of 54 basis
points last week from an average of 75 in December, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. Its 2020 euro notes trade at a yield
89 basis points above mid-swaps.  To contact the reporters on this story:
