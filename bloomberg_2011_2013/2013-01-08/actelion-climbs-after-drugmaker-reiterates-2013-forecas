Actelion Ltd. (ATLN)  climbed the most in
more than five months after the Swiss maker of the Tracleer lung
drug reiterated its forecast for 2013.  Actelion  rose  as much as 3.7 percent to 46.39 Swiss francs,
the biggest intraday jump since July 19, and was trading up 3.4
percent at 12:04 p.m. in Zurich. Volume exceeded the three-month
daily average by 13 percent.  Earnings in 2013 will about match figures from last year,
with “single-digit percentage growth” in 2014 and a double-
digit increase in 2015 because of sales of macitentan, a planned
successor to Tracleer, the Allschwil-based company said in a
 presentation  posted on its website after the close of trading
yesterday.  “Full year 2012 was an exciting year, laying the stepping
stone for further success by demonstrating that macitentan is a
very good and efficacious drug,” Andrew Weiss, an analyst at
Bank Vontobel AB, wrote in a note today. “Earnings guidance for
2013 is confirmed.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
