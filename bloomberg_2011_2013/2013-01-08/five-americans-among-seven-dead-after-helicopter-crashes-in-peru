Columbia Helicopters Inc. said seven
employees died after one of the company’s cargo helicopters
crashed in the Peruvian jungle.  Five American and two Peruvian crew members were killed
after the tandem-rotor helicopter crashed minutes after taking
off from Pucallpa airport yesterday afternoon.  The helicopter was working under contract to support oil
exploration, Aurora, Oregon-based Columbia said in an e-mailed
statement today. Company officials are headed to  Peru  to
investigate the incident, according to the statement.  “This is a very sad day for Columbia Helicopters,” said
President Michael Fahey in the statement. “We will work closely
with all authorities and witnesses to conduct a thorough
investigation.”  Bystanders reported seeing crew members throwing cargo from
the helicopter as the aircraft spiraled downwards, La Republica
reported. Three of the men jumped from the helicopter before it
hit the ground and exploded, the Lima-based newspaper said on
its website.  Todd Petersen, Columbia’s vice president of marketing,
didn’t immediately return a call seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
