The pound fell toward the weakest
level in a month against the dollar after an industry report
showed U.K. retail sales slowed in December, adding to signs
Britain’s economy is lagging behind U.S. growth.  Sterling weakened versus all except one of its 16 major
counterparts before a  Bank of England  meeting this week at which
policy makers are forecast to keep  interest rates  at a record
low as it struggles to stoke a recovery. The U.K. economy shrank
0.1 percent last year, while the U.S. expanded 2.2 percent,
according to analyst forecasts compiled by Bloomberg. Gilts
rose, with the 10-year yield falling the most in a week, as
investors sought safer assets.  “U.S. growth is outperforming U.K. to such an extent that
the last time we saw this kind of a differential was pretty much
in the 1980s,” said Peter Kinsella, a senior foreign-exchange
strategist at Commerzbank AG in  London . “Definitely you’ll see
lower levels in cable over the course of the year,” he said,
referring to the pound-dollar  exchange rate .  The pound fell 0.5 percent to $1.6037 at 4:24 p.m. London
time after declining to $1.6010 on Jan. 4, the lowest level
since Dec. 7. The U.K. currency depreciated 0.1 percent to 81.45
pence per euro after dropping to 81.62 pence, the weakest since
Dec. 31.  Sterling has fallen 1 percent in the past week, the worst
performer of 10 developed-market currencies tracked by Bloomberg
Correlation-Weighted Indexes. It gained 2 percent last year.  Retail Sales  Retail-sales growth at U.K. stores open at least a year
slowed to 0.3 percent last month from a year earlier, from 0.4
percent in November, the  British Retail Consortium  said.
Economists surveyed by Bloomberg forecast growth of 0.5 percent.  The Bank of England will keep its benchmark rate at 0.5
percent and the asset-purchase target at 375 billion pounds on
Jan. 10, separate Bloomberg surveys show.  “It’s a tough economic environment that we’re in,” Prime
Minister  David Cameron  said on  BBC Television ’s “Andrew Marr
Show” on Jan. 6. “Right now, Britain needs low interest
rates.”  The pound will weaken to $1.60 and strengthen to 80 pence
per euro by year-end, according to median estimates of analyst
estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Forecasting sterling against the 17-member common currency
is difficult given the economic risks in both regions, but the
pound may benefit from Bank of England policy, said  Neil Mellor ,
a foreign-exchange strategist at  Bank of New York Mellon Corp. (BK) 
in London.  Sterling ‘Underpinned’  “We believe cable will fall this coming year or over the
course of the next few months,” Mellor said. “Euro-sterling is
a little bit harder to pinpoint, but in the end it comes down to
the simple fact sterling is underpinned by a central bank with
independent monetary policy.”  The  10-year gilt  yield dropped six basis points, or 0.06
percentage point, to 2.03 percent after falling as much as seven
basis points, the biggest decline since Dec. 27. The 1.75
percent bond due in September 2022 gained 0.50, or 5 pounds per
1,000-pound face amount, to 97.58.  The Debt Management Office sold 1.5 billion pounds of 4.75
percent bonds due in December 2030 today at an average yield of
2.786 percent, compared with 2.586 percent at the previous
auction of the securities on July 3. Investors bid for 1.83
times the amount allotted, versus 2.06 times in July.  Buy Gilts  Investors should buy 2 percent gilts due in January 2016,
according to Scotiabank analysts  Alan Clarke , Frederic Pretet
and Rajae Bouhdadi.  “Given the decent sell-off that we have seen at the start
of 2013, the three-year to five-year sector in gilts is now
looking attractive,” the analysts wrote today in a note to
clients. The 2016 gilt “is particularly noteworthy as this
month its maturity will drop below three years, which may lead
to increased demand from central banks.”  The securities rose for a second day, with the yield
falling five basis points to 0.61 percent.  Gilts handed investors a loss of 1.8 percent this month
through yesterday, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg
and the European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies.
German bonds fell 1.3 percent and Treasuries slid 0.7 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
