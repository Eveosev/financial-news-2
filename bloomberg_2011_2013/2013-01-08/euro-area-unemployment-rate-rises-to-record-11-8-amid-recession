The euro-area jobless rate rose to a
record in November as the fiscal crisis and tougher austerity
measures deepened  Europe ’s economic troubles.  Unemployment in the 17-nation region rose to 11.8 percent
from 11.7 percent in October, the European Union’s  statistics
office  in Luxembourg said today. That’s the highest since the
data series started in 1995 and in line with the median estimate
of 27 economists in a Bloomberg News  survey .  The euro-area economy has shrunk for two successive
quarters and economists foresee a further decline in gross
domestic product in the final three months of last year, forcing
companies to cut costs by slashing jobs. The  European Central
Bank  estimates contractions of 0.5 percent and 0.3 percent in
2012 and 2013.  “In the southern areas of the euro zone, demand is very
weak and therefore there is no way to see fundamental
improvement in labor-market conditions,” said Uwe Duerkop, an
economist at  Landesbank Berlin . “There might be some
stabilization in the labor market in the second half of the year
where one can expect this trend of growing unemployment numbers
to stop, but that’s not the story for the moment.”  Today’s jobless report showed that  18.8 million people  were
unemployed in the euro area in November, up 113,000 from the
previous month. At 26.6 percent,  Spain  had the highest jobless
rate in the currency bloc.  Germany ’s jobless rate was 5.4
percent and  France ’s stood at 10.5 percent. Austria had the
lowest rate at 4.5 percent.  Youth Unemployment  The data also showed that youth unemployment was at 24.4
percent, with Spain’s rate more than double that at 56.5
percent.  Spanish banks are reducing work places. BFA-Bankia, the
biggest Spanish lender set to receive European bailout funds,
will cut about 6,000 jobs, or more than a quarter of its
workforce. Banco Santander SA plans to cut 3,000 jobs in its
Banesto SA unit as part of its buyout plan, Cinco Dias newspaper
reported on Jan. 4.  In France, Peugeot SA announced on Dec. 12 that it will
eliminate an additional 1,500 jobs by 2014, on top of 8,000 job
cuts announced in July. Germany’s Siemens AG said on Dec. 19 it
is eliminating 1,100 jobs at two energy units in Germany.  Europe’s economic malaise is deepening as governments
across the region impose budget cuts to narrow their fiscal
deficits. Spain and Cyprus last year joined the list of
countries seeking external aid, following Greece, Portugal and
Ireland.  Failure to find a solution to the euro area’s troubles, and
the U.S. debt-ceiling debate, will result in a “major world
economic crisis,” International Monetary Fund Managing Director
 Christine Lagarde  said on Jan. 5.  To contact the reporter on this story:
