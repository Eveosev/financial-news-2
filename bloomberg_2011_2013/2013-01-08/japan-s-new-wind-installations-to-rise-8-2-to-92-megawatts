Japan ’s new wind-power installations
will rise 8.2 percent to 92 megawatts in the year ending March
31, an industry group  forecast  today.  The country added 85 megawatts of wind-power capacity in
the previous period, according to a statement by the Japan Wind
Power Association. Installations were 256 megawatts in the year
to March 2011, data from the association show.  Last financial year’s drop came after the government ended
direct subsidies that paid for a third of the cost of renewable
energy projects in favor of a feed-in tariff program that
started in July and pays above-market rates for clean energy
projects such as solar, wind and geothermal.  Environmental impact assessments of wind projects that
began in October to address impact on birds and concerns about
noise also hurt the industry, the association said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
