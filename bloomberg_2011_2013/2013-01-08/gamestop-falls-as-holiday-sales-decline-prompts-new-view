GameStop Corp. (GME) , the world’s largest
video-game retailer, tumbled the most in more than seven months
after the company narrowed its full-year same-store sales
forecast, citing disappointing holiday results.  The shares  fell  6.3 percent to $23.19 at the close in New
York, for the biggest decline since May 17. The Grapevine,
Texas-based company gained 4 percent last year.  GameStop, which in November announced it would close 200
stores because of a “tough video game market,” said in a
statement today that comparable-store sales for the fiscal year
ending this month will fall between 7.5 percent and 9 percent
after holiday global sales declined 4.6 percent from a year
earlier to $2.88 billion. The company previously  forecast  an
annual sales drop of between 6 percent and 9 percent.  “GameStop experienced mixed results during the holiday
selling period,” Chief Executive Officer Paul Raines said in
the statement. “Our successful Wii U launch, strong digital
growth and continued momentum in the mobile space were countered
by a decline in store traffic.”  Total comparable-store sales, or those at stores open for
at least a year, fell 4.4 percent in the nine-week holiday
season ended Dec. 29, dropping 3.5 percent in the U.S. and 6.4
percent internationally, according to the statement.  While GameStop’s new forecast prompted  Tony Wible , an
analyst at Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, to trim his 2013 and
2014 profit estimates on “incremental weakness,” he reiterated
his buy  rating  on the stock.  “We have been waiting for pullbacks in GameStop as great
entry points on a controversial name,” Wible wrote in an
investor note. “Digital receipts were up over 40 percent and
iDevice sales continue to see momentum.”  He revised his per-share earnings estimates to $3.46, from
$3.48, for fiscal 2013 and to $3.79, from $3.80, for the next
year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
