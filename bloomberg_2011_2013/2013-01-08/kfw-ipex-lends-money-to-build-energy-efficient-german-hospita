KfW IPEX Bank GmbH, the export
finance unit of  Germany ’s state-owned development lender KfW
Group, is providing 23 million euros ($30 million) to build an
energy-efficient hospital in northwest Germany.  The “Wesermarschklinik” Hospital in Nordenham, Lower
Saxony, will use 30 percent less energy than a similar building,
according to a  statement  today on KfW’s website. It will be
built on pile foundations set in the ground that can be used to
draw and store geothermal heat, it said.  Germany is aiming for a 50 percent reduction in energy
consumption by 2050 compared with 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
