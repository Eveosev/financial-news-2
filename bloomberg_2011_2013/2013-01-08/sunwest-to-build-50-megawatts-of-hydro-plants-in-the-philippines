Sunwest Water and Electric Co.  will
build nine hydropower plants with combined capacity of 50
megawatts in the Philippine provinces of Antique and Aklan, the
company said in a statement.  The projects are at various stages of development, with an
8-megawatt run-of-the-river plant called Villasiga1 expected to
start operations in June, it said. The company, also known as
SUWECO, aims to complete the rest within five years.  “The entry of these hydropower projects are expected to
increase the sources of reliable, clean and cost-efficient
indigenous power in the island,” Antique Governor Exequiel
Javier said in the same statement.  Sunwest said it has 59 projects at different stages of
development and will generate total capacity of around 280
megawatts in 10 years. Hydro accounts for about a fifth of the
 Philippines ’ installed generating capacity, according to data
from the  Department of Energy .  To contact the reporter on this story:
