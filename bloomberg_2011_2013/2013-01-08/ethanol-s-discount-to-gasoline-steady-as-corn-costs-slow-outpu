Ethanol’s discount to gasoline was
little changed amid speculation that higher corn prices will
curtail output that’s down 16 percent from a year ago.  The grain-based additive was 57.44 cents a gallon less
expensive than gasoline, based on prompt-month contracts for
both commodities, compared with 57.24 cents yesterday.  “A lot of producers were out here buying today,” said Jim
Damask, a manager at StarFuels Inc. in Jupiter,  Florida . “Some
of them are short and corn’s strong. That’s put pressure on some
of the guys. They’re getting a little nervous being short.”  Denatured ethanol for February delivery rose 1.5 cents, or
0.7 percent, to settle at $2.22 a gallon on the  Chicago  Board of
Trade. Gasoline for February delivery gained 1.7 cents to
$2.7944 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile Exchange .  Corn for March delivery gained 3.25 cents, or 0.5 percent,
to $6.8875 a bushel in Chicago. One bushel makes at least 2.75
gallons of ethanol.  In cash market trading, ethanol in Chicago climbed 3.25
cents, or 1.5 percent, to $2.1975 a gallon and in the U.S. Gulf
the additive increased 3 cents, or 1.3 percent, to $2.265, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  Ethanol on the West Coast jumped 2.5 cents, or 1.1 percent,
to $2.365 a gallon and in  New York  the biofuel advanced 1.5
cents, or 0.7 percent, to $2.28.  Producers of the fuel have tempered output as drought in
the Midwest baked corn fields, cutting yields and raising
prices.  March Contracts  Based on March contracts for corn and ethanol, producers
are losing 27 cents on each gallon of the fuel made, unchanged
from yesterday, according to data compiled
y Bloomberg. The figures exclude the revenue that can be made
from the sale of dried distillers’ grains, a byproduct of
ethanol production that can be fed to livestock.  Output will remain at the current levels through the middle
of the year before recovering from the drought, the Energy
Department said today in its  Short-Term Energy Outlook .  Idled capacity will restart in 2014 to meet the U.S.
renewable fuels standards to use 14.4 billion gallons of ethanol
from 13.8 billion required this year, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
