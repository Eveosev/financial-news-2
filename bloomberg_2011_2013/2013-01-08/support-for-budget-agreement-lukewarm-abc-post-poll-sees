Americans are giving tepid support to
the Jan. 1 congressional agreement on spending cuts and tax
increases, an ABC News/Washington Post  poll  shows.  Respondents to the survey said they support the accord 45
percent to 38 percent, with 17 percent undecided.  President  Barack Obama  received majority support for his
handling of the negotiations, 52 percent to 37 percent.  A 51 percent majority disapproved of the way House Speaker
 John Boehner , an Ohio Republican, handled the talks, with 31
percent approving.  The ABC News/Washington Post survey of a random sample of
1,000 adults conducted by land-line and mobile phones Jan. 2-6
had a margin of error of plus or minus four percentage points.  To contact the reporters on this story:
