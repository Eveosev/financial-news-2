BullionVault , an online service for
investors to buy and sell physical gold and silver, said its
Gold Investor Index climbed to a 12-month high in December.  The gauge rose to 58.3 from 56.5 in November, climbing for
a fifth consecutive month, the London-based company said today
in an e-mailed report. A reading above 50 means more buyers than
sellers. Gold slipped 2.3 percent last month, cutting its annual
increase to 7.1 percent, and traded at $1,648.82 an ounce by 8
a.m. in  London .  Prices gained for a 12th straight year in 2012, the longest
winning streak in at least nine decades, as central banks from
the U.S. to  China  pledged more steps to boost economic growth.
Still, last year’s rally was the smallest in four years and the
metal slid about 7.9 percent in the past three months. Holdings
in gold-backed  exchange-traded products  are about 0.4 percent
below the Dec. 20 record, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  “What we’re seeing on BullionVault is that people are
increasingly concerned about high debt levels and loose central
bank policy,” Ben Traynor, an economist at BullionVault, said
in the report. “These trends could lead to higher inflation
down the road. People are buying gold to hedge that risk.”  BullionVault’s customers own more than 1 million ounces of
gold, it said. The metal is stored in vaults in London, Zurich
and  New York , according to its website. About 90 percent of the
company’s users live in the U.S., the U.K. or euro area, it
said.  To contact the reporter for this story:
