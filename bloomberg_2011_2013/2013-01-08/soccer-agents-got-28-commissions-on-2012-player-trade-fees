Agents and other intermediaries
received an average commission rate of 28 percent on the 11,555
cross-border player transfers that took place last year,
soccer’s governing body  FIFA  said.  The Zurich-based organization didn’t disclose how much
money changed hands in the global transfer market in a year when
stars including Zlatan Ibrahimovic,  Robin van Persie , Eden Hazard and Hulk changed clubs. Figures released last year by
European soccer body UEFA showed more than 3 billion euros ($3.9
billion) is spent annually on player trading.  FIFA is trying to reform its rules on agents and other
intermediaries. A committee on club soccer will meet to discuss
“a concrete final proposal at a special meeting” before FIFA’s
executive board gets together later this year, a statement said.  Today’s figures, which don’t include trading between clubs
in the same country, showed deals between Brazil and  Portugal 
were the most common with Brazilians the most traded players.
Both countries allow so-called third-party investors to own
stakes in players and benefit when athletes are sold at a
profit. FIFA is discussing whether to outlaw the practice and is
conducting an assessment that includes verifying the legal
impact of imposing a ban.  The governing body also plans to introduce an online
platform allowing clubs around the world to showcase talent to
prospective buyers directly without the need for agents.  “This will revolutionize the international and national
transfer system,” Jacques Anouma, chairman of FIFA’s Committee
for Club Football, said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
