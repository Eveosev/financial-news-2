Spain plans to sell 59 billion euros
($77 billion) of bonds after maturities in 2013 to finance the
euro-region’s second-largest budget deficit.  Net bond issuance for this year compares with net sales of
62.7 billion euros last year and an initial target of 35.8
billion euros for 2012, Spain’s Treasury chief, Inigo Fernandez
de Mesa, told reporters in  Madrid  today. Gross  issuance  will
reach 215 billion euros to 230 billion euros and include 23
billion euros in financing for Spain’s regions, he said. That
compares with 249.6 billion euros in gross issuance last year,
he said.  “Spain’s debt is sustainable,” said Fernandez de Mesa,
adding a bailout isn’t necessary for now as the government
expects borrowing costs to fall again this year. They dropped to
an average of 3.42 percent in 2012 from 3.9 percent a year
earlier. The Treasury expects to maintain the average life of
outstanding debt in 2013 at 6.06 years, he said.  Spain holds its first debt sale of 2013 on Jan. 10 as it
girds for 159.2 billion euros of redemptions this year. Prime
Minister Mariano Rajoy’s one-year-old government is trying to
avoid requesting aid from  Europe ’s rescue fund and the European
Central Bank to lower its borrowing costs.  Request Aid  “At some point, it is likely that the supply will tip the
balance, cause yields to rise and force Spain to request aid,”
Justin Knight, a London-based European rates strategist at UBS
AG, said in a telephone interview. “There simply aren’t enough
buyers,” he said, noting that the Treasury’s plan presented
today increases gross bond issuance by 44 percent compared to
the government’s September estimate in the 2013 budget plan.  Rajoy has pledged to trim Spain’s budget gap, which the
European Commission put at 8 percent of output in 2012, to 4.5
percent of GDP this year. Fernandez de Mesa said Spain’s fiscal
goals are discussed by the Commission and the government and the
effort to be made would take into account the country’s
deepening  recession .  The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development
predicts the Spanish economy will contract 1.4 percent this year
after shrinking 1.3 percent last year, according to forecasts
published on Nov. 27. It expects Europe’s fourth-largest economy
to grow 0.5 percent in 2014.  Flexible Approach  “The plans as they stand should not be seen as set in
stone,” London-based strategists for Barclays Plc including
Laurent Fransolet and  Huw Worthington  wrote in an e-mailed note.
“A flexible approach to financing will likely be adopted by the
Spanish Treasury again with privatization proceeds, private
placements and other sources of funding.”  The Treasury plans to have net bill sales of 12 billion
euros this year after reducing its stock of bills by 5.6 billion
euros in 2012. It will introduce a new, nine-month bill, while
dropping its 18-month note, Fernandez de Mesa said.  The Treasury’s current liquidity position is
“comfortable” as the daily cash balance averaged around 35
billion euros in 2012, 5 billion euros more than in 2011, he
said.  The yield on Spain’s  10-year benchmark bond  fell 4 basis
points to 5.07 percent at 3:57 p.m. in Madrid, while the  spread 
with similar German maturities widened to 359 basis points. That
compares with a euro-era high of 7.75 percent on July 25, before
ECB President Mario Draghi pledged to save the euro with a bond
purchase program known as OMT.  Anemic Growth  The “anemic growth outlook for 2013 is a big hurdle and
makes it likely that Spain may have to request activation of the
OMT,” said Fadi Zaher, head of fixed-income sales and trading
for Barclays Wealth and Investment Management in  London .
“Concerns about debt sustainability won’t vanish overnight.”  Spain is rated one level above junk by Standard and Poor’s
and Moody’s Investors Service, and two levels higher by Fitch
Ratings.  The Treasury, which plans to sell as much as 5 billion
euros in bonds maturing in 2015, 2018 and 2026 on Jan. 10,
estimated that the total debt stock would reach 759.7 billion
euros at the end of 2013, compared with 688.2 billion euros at
the end of 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
