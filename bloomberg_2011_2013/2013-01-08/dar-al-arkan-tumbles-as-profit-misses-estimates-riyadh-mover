Dar Al Arkan Real Estate Development
Co. (ALARKAN)  dropped the most in almost six months after fourth-quarter
earnings missed analysts’ estimates.  The shares slumped 6.1 percent, the most since July 11, to
8.5 riyals at the 3:30 p.m. close in Riyadh. The stock was the
biggest decline on the Tadawul All Share Index today.  Quarterly profit  at Dar Al Arkan, the biggest publicly
traded Saudi property company by assets, dropped to 144 million
riyals ($38 million) from 290 million riyals due to lower
margins on property sales, the Riyadh-based company said in a
statement to the Saudi stock market. The mean estimate of five
analysts was for a profit of 252 million riyals, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  “We are slightly concerned about the dent in the gross
margin, which we can only attribute to a decline in
profitability of quarterly land sales,” said Jan Pawel Hasman,
a real-estate analyst at EFG-Hermes Asset Management. “The
bottom-line weakness might have been additionally caused by
increased depreciation charges driven by the newly launched
investment properties, as well as increased marketing and
financing costs.”  Four analysts  have a buy rating on the stock, while three
recommend investors hold the shares, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
