The International Monetary Fund said
it expects economic growth in Cambodia to reach its potential of
7.5 percent in the medium term.  The Washington-based IMF forecast growth of 6.7 percent
this year, up from an estimated 6.5 percent in 2012, in its
annual assessment of the country’s economy published today.  “This outlook is subject to considerable risks, stemming
from the fragility of the global economy and domestic factors,
including potential labor market instabilities and extreme
weather,” the IMF said in a statement released today following
a Dec. 3 board meeting.  To contact the reporter on this story:
