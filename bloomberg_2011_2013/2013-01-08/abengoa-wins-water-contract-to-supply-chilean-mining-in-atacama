Abengoa SA (ABG)  said the solar-thermal,
water desalination and biofuels developer won a contract to
supply water to the mining sector in Chileâ€™s Atacama region.  The Seville, Spain-based company said the $65 million
contract was awarded by Cleanairtech Sudamerica SA, part of the
Compania Minera del Pacifico group, to develop a desalinated
water pipeline for the  mining industry  in Copiapo Valley.  The project about 800 kilometers (500 miles) north of
Santiago is due to be operational by December  Abengoa is carrying out the Zapotillo aqueduct water
pipeline project in Mexico, which will supply drinking water to
about 1.5 million inhabitants. Its projects also include Solana,
the largest plant using parabolic-trough solar-thermal
technology in  Arizona , and one of the first commercial second-
generation bioethanol plants, in Hugoton, Kansas, which will
come into operation at the end of this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
