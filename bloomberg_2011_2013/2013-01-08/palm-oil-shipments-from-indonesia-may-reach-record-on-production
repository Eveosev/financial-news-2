Palm oil  exports from Indonesia, the
world’s largest producer, may climb about 10 percent to an all-
time high this year as output gains to a record and sales of
refined products increase, according to an industry group.  Shipments may climb to 20 million metric tons from an
estimated 18.2 million tons last year, according to the
Indonesian Palm Oil Association. Output will probably expand 5.7
percent to 28 million tons, the group known as Gapki said.  Palm oil dropped 23 percent in  Kuala Lumpur  last year, the
worst slump since the financial crisis in 2008, as slowdowns in
Europe and  China  curbed demand, boosting stockpiles in Indonesia
and  Malaysia . Futures have rebounded 8.7 percent after slumping
to a three-year low of 2,217 ringgit ($728) on Dec. 13.  “Export of refined products may be more than 60 percent of
total shipments in 2013, because the tariffs are lower than
crude palm oil,” Susanto, head of marketing at Gapki, told
reporters in Jakarta today. That would compare with 58 percent
in 2012, he said.  Demand for refined products especially from China, the
world’s biggest edible oil consumer, is promising and will
continue to increase, he said.  Indonesia  exported about 3
million tons of palm oil to China in 2011, according to data
from Gapki. Shipments in the first 10 months of 2012 reached 2.4
million tons, down about 2 percent from a year earlier.  Tax Cuts  Indonesia needs to cut its export tax to avoid losing
market share to Malaysia in countries such as  India  and Pakistan
that typically buy more of the crude variety, Gapki Secretary-
General Joko Supriyono said.  Indonesia cut the export tax on crude palm to 7.5 percent
this month from 9 percent in December, while Malaysia set the
tariff at zero. The Indonesian duty for refined products such as
palm-based biodiesel and refined, bleached and deodorized palm
oil are set at zero for this month, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  Exports will depend on the “government’s policy, if we
have similar export tax level, like Malaysia, then we could
increase our exports,” Supriyono said. Shipments to  Pakistan 
may gain to about 1 million tons from about 600,000 tons last
year, if the government lowers the tax, he said.  Indonesia exported 5.8 million tons of palm oil to India in
2011, according to Gapki’s data. Shipments reached 4.6 million
tons in the first 10 months of 2012.  To contact the reporters on this story:
