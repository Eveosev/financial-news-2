General Motors Co. (GM)  surpassed  Ford
Motor Co. (F)  in federal-government sales for the first time since
receiving a U.S. bailout as Ford’s prices rose faster, according
to General Services Administration data.  GM directly sold 19,404 vehicles to the U.S. government in
the fiscal year ending Sept. 30, a 3.6 percent increase from
2011, according to data obtained under a Freedom of Information
Act request to the GSA, which coordinates most vehicle
purchases. Sales at Ford, which didn’t need a U.S. bailout, fell
43 percent to 10,734.  “GM is really just resuming the status quo from before
bailout, getting back to so-called normal,” said Michelle Krebs, a senior analyst at Edmunds.com, which tracks vehicle
sales and pricing. “And they have the right product again, so
it’s beyond the politics and it’s what’s practical.”  Automakers’ business with the federal government, while
less than 1 percent of U.S.  sales  for any carmaker, took on a
symbolic significance after the $80 billion U.S. bailout of GM
and the predecessor to Chrysler Group LLC U.S. in 2009. The
rescue sparked criticism from Republicans that the U.S. might
show favoritism to the companies in which it had a stake.  Total government-fleet sales were 3 percent of GM’s
business last year, Kurt McNeil, vice president for U.S. sales
and service, said on a Jan. 3 conference call.  The U.S. government said in December it plans to sell its
remaining  stake  in Detroit-based GM, which was 32 percent of the
company’s shares before a $5.5 billion buyback the automaker
announced Dec. 19. The government exited Chrysler, based in
 Auburn Hills ,  Michigan , in June 2011.  Competitive Bidding  Annual competitive bidding changes which manufacturer gains
an advantage and “drives volume to the lowest priced
vehicles,” Dan Cruz, a GSA spokesman, said in an e-mail. GM’s
average price per vehicle rose about 1.9 percent for fiscal
2012, compared to a 12 percent increase at Ford, according to
the GSA data.  “Agencies purchase the low-priced vehicle as equipped with
only a few exceptions,” Cruz said. “No preference is ever
given to a specific manufacturer.”  The GSA paid an average of $26,103 per vehicle, the data
showed. In September 2012, the average sticker price for a
retail model was $33,066, Edmunds.com said.  GSA purchases from Chrysler fell 11 percent to 9,468 cars
and trucks as sales to the federal fleet dipped about 8.6
percent to 50,114, the data showed. In 2009, as GM and Chrysler
emerged from bankruptcy, the government bought 89,380 units. The
U.S. auto industry sold 14.5 million cars and trucks last year,
according to Autodata Corp. in  Woodcliff Lake ,  New Jersey .  The GSA coordinates about two-thirds of U.S. government
vehicle purchases.  Cutting Back  The GSA decreased its spending last year and bought fewer
cars and trucks compared with the previous year. It bought $1.3
billion worth of vehicles in fiscal 2012 compared with $1.36
billion in 2011, $1.55 billion in 2010 and $1.95 billion in
2009.  GM had $409.2 million in sales to the agency last year, to
$241.3 million for Ford.  “Agencies purchase the number of vehicles they need in a
given year to meet their mission requirements and based on the
needs of their current fleet inventory,” Cruz said.  Ford was the top seller in the two fiscal years after GM
and Chrysler got their 2009 rescues. Before fiscal 2010, GM had
held the sales lead since at least 2005.  GM’s Malibu sedan was the top-selling model to the U.S.
government last year, with 4,341 sold. The government paid an
average of $15,778 for its Malibus, according to the data,
compared with the retail sticker price of $22,110.  The company’s larger Impala sedan and Tahoe sport-utility
vehicle were in the top 10. Chrysler had two top-10 vehicles,
the Dodge Grand Caravan minivan and Ram 1500 pickup.  Ford Dealers  GM wasn’t helped by the U.S. government being its largest
shareholder and must bid against all other manufacturers, said
Heather Rosenker, a Washington-based spokeswoman.  “We are proud of the service our trucks and cars provide
to the nation,” Rosenker said in an e-mail.  GM ceded its 77-year crown as the world’s largest automaker
from 2008 to 2010 to  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203)  While Toyota lost it to
GM in 2011 when an earthquake halted the flow of parts to
factories around the world, the Toyota City, Japan-based
automaker is poised to regain it for 2012 based on sales through
November.  Ford’s sales through the GSA are higher than they appear
because some purchases through dealers were listed separately in
the agency’s database, Christin Baker, a Washington spokeswoman
for the Dearborn, Michigan-based company, said in an interview.  Focus, Pickups  Brasada/Northside Ford in  San Antonio  sold 2,724 vehicles
to the U.S. government last year, the fifth-highest for any
seller, according to GSA. The dealership is one of about a half
dozen that sell hundreds of modified trucks and vans to the
government each year.  “Ford continues to compete with our full lineup of
vehicles of quality, green, safe, smart vehicles,” Baker said.  Two Ford pickups -- the F-250 and F-350 -- were top-20
vehicles that the GSA purchased through a dealer, the data
shows.  Ford’s top seller to the government was the compact Focus,
with the F-150 in fifth place.  GM’s return to the top spot at Ford’s expense will be
criticized by some people who opposed the bailouts, even if it’s
unwarranted and not all that important to revenue, said  Rebecca Lindland , an industry analyst with IHS Automotive.  The government is “buying these cars because they need
them, not because of anything to do with Government Motors,”
she said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
