U.S. natural-gas production rose to
an all-time high of 28.5 trillion cubic feet in 2011, led by
record output from shale deposits, an Energy Department report
showed.  Gross gas output rose 6.2 percent in 2011 from a year
earlier, the departmentâ€™s Energy Information Administration said
in its  Natural Gas Annual  report, released late yesterday.  Production of gas from shale deposits climbed 46 percent to
8.5 trillion cubic feet in 2011, the most in department data
going back to 2007. Shale accounted for 30 percent of total
output in 2011, up from 22 percent the previous year.  Shale production surged as drilling technologies such as
hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, made it more economical to
extract gas from rock formations such as the Marcellus in the
Northeast and the Bakken in North Dakota.  Output from other gas wells fell 7.2 percent to 12.29
trillion, the lowest level in data going back to 1967. The share
of total output from other gas wells fell to 43 percent from 49
percent, department data show.  Dry-gas production rose 7.4 percent to 22.9 trillion cubic
feet in 2011, an all-time high.  To contact the reporter on this story:
