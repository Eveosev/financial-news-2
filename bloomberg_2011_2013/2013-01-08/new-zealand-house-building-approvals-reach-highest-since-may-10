New Zealand  building approvals for
detached houses surged to the highest in 2 1/2 years in November
amid record-low  interest rates  and rebuilding in the earthquake-
devastated Canterbury region.  Permits for dwellings excluding apartments rose 4.6 percent
from October to 1,382, the most since May 2010,  Statistics New
Zealand  said in Wellington today. Total approvals fell 5.4
percent as apartment consents slumped to a 19-month low.  Increases in construction plans add to signs of a revival
in the housing market, led by low mortgage interest rates and by
rebuilding in Christchurch city and the surrounding Canterbury
district after earthquakes in 2010 and 2011. Central bank
Governor Graeme Wheeler on Dec. 6 said lower funding costs were
helping keep borrowing costs at bay, adding he will be
monitoring the housing market for signs of emerging inflation
pressure.  “Conditions have certainly eased on the interest rate
front,”  Craig Ebert , senior economist at Bank of New Zealand
Ltd. in Wellington, said in an interview yesterday. “We all
know interest rates need to be on the low side but just how
low?”  New Zealand’s dollar was little changed after the report,
buying 83.65 U.S. cents at 10:48 a.m. in Wellington.  New Zealand’s effective home-lending rate in October was
the lowest since records began in 1998, according to central
bank figures.  The central bank has kept the official cash rate at a
record-low 2.5 percent since March 2011. Eight of 16 economists
surveyed by  Bloomberg News  forecast Wheeler will raise borrowing
costs this year.  Total approvals rose 20 percent from November last year,
the statistics agency said, citing unadjusted figures. Consents
in Canterbury surged 71 percent to the highest in more than five
years, it said. Auckland approvals were little changed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
