European Union carbon allowances fell
as U.K. natural gas prices dropped, curbing demand for pollution
rights in the world’s biggest cap-and-trade system.  EU permits for delivery in December declined as much as 1.5
percent to 6.56 euros ($8.61) a metric ton on  London ’s ICE
Futures Europe exchange. The contract traded at 6.60 euros as of
8:35 a.m. in London.  U.K. natural gas for next month dropped 1 percent to 67.85
pence a therm. Carbon permits sometimes track gas because power
utilities burning the fuel need half the permits compared with
when they use more-polluting coal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
