Aviva Plc (AV/) , the U.K.’s second-biggest
insurance company by market value, sold its 19.4 percent stake
in Dutch insurer  Delta Lloyd NV (DL)  for 433.8 million euros ($568
million) as it retreats from less profitable markets.  Aviva sold 34.3 million shares of the Amsterdam-based
insurer in a stock offering for 12.65 euros each, a 1.6 percent
discount to yesterday’s closing price, the London-based firm
said in a statement. Aviva dropped as much as 2.6 percent in
London today and Delta Lloyd rose as much as 9.5 percent.  The sale “supports our strategy to narrow focus and make
Aviva a more nimble and athletic organization,” Chief Executive
Officer  Mark Wilson  said in a statement today announcing the
sale. “It will further increase Aviva’s cash and capital
position and is consistent with our focus on businesses where we
can earn higher returns.”  Aviva is selling or winding down almost a third of its 58
businesses and seeking to increase its capital reserves, which
were hurt by the European sovereign debt crisis. It held an
initial public offering in 2009 for  Delta Lloyd , which sells
life insurance in Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg.
Commercial Union, one of Aviva’s predecessor companies, bought
Delta Lloyd in 1973, according to the Dutch company’s  website .  The sale increases Aviva’s economic capital surplus
coverage ratio, or its capital reserves, by about 4 percentage
points to 169 percent, the insurer said in the statement. The
proceeds “will increase central group liquidity and will be
used for general corporate purposes,” it said.  Aviva fell 2.2 percent to 373.6 pence at 8:19 a.m. in
London while Delta Lloyd climbed 6.9 percent to 13.75 euros in
Amsterdam.  Morgan Stanley coordinated the so-called accelerated
bookbuilding of Delta Lloyd stock, and was joint book runner
along with  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  and Barclays Plc.  Wilson, formerly the CEO of Asian insurer  AIA Group Ltd. (1299) ,
took the top job at Aviva on Jan. 1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
