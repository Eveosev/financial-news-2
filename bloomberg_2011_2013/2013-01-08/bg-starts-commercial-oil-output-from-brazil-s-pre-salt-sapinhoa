BG Group Plc (BG/)  started oil production
at the Sapinhoa field off Brazil, one of the “Big Five”
discoveries in the pre-salt Santos Basin.  Along with  Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4)  and  Repsol YPF SA (REP) , BG
plans to pump an initial 25,000 barrels a day from the deposit
in BM-S-9 Block, the Reading, England-based producer said today
in a statement. Sapinhoa holds about 2.1 billion barrels of
recoverable oil and gas, according to Petrobras, Brazil’s state-
controlled oil producer.  The Cidade de Sao Paulo floating production, storage and
offloading, or FPSO, will reach peak output in the first half of
2014.  BG slumped the most on record on Oct. 31 after saying
output growth would stall in 2013 following delays at projects
in the U.S., North Sea,  Brazil  and  Egypt . The company plans to
invest $30 billion in Brazil, where it expects to pump about a
third of its worldwide output by 2020.  This is a “reassuring step forward” in light of the
production warning, Simon Hawkins, a London-based analyst at N+1
Singer Ltd., wrote in an e-mailed report.  Sapinhoa is the second of the so called “Big Five” fields
in the BM-S-9 and BM-S-11 blocks where investors plan to install
15 FPSOs.  The Lula field, formerly known as Tupi, was the first
find in the pre-salt deposit in the Santos Basin, and started
production in October 2010.  BG has a 30 percent interest in the BM-S-9 Block, of which
Petrobras is the operator with 45 percent and Repsol Sinopec
Brasil has 25 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
