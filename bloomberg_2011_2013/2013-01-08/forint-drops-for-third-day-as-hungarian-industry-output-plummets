The forint weakened for a third day
and  Hungary ’s five-year bond yields fell after data showed the
nation’s industrial output plunged the most in three years in
November, adding to speculation of further central bank easing.  Hungary’s currency depreciated 0.3 percent to 292.30 per
euro by 4:35 p.m. in Budapest. Yields on the government’s 2017
bonds dropped five basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, to
5.893 percent.  The central bank has cut  interest rates  every month since
August to help Hungary exit its second recession in four years.
Industrial production fell a workday-adjusted 6.9 percent in
November from a year earlier, the steepest decline since
November 2009, and fell 0.1 percent from the previous month, the
statistics office in Budapest said today. Economists had
predicted a 3.5 percent drop, according to the median of 10
estimates in a Bloomberg survey.  “The much worse than expected industrial output data may
give further ammunition to doves in the Monetary Council for
further easing,” Imre Kerekgyarto and Karoly Bamli, Budapest-
based currency traders at Commerzbank AG, wrote by e-mail today,
adding that the forint weakened after the publication of the
data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
