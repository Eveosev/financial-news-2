Seagate Technology Plc (STX)  said sales
rose to at least $3.6 billion in the fiscal second quarter,
exceeding an earlier forecast for $3.5 billion as the company
maintained share in the computer hard-drive market.  Gross margin, a measure of profitability, was more than 27
percent in the three months through Dec. 28, Dublin-based
Seagate said yesterday in a statement. The company previously
had forecast gross margin at the low end of a range of 27
percent to 32 percent. Analysts had estimated sales of $3.52
billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The higher projection contrasts with the outlook last year,
when Seagate reduced growth forecasts for some periods. The
company suffered from lessening demand for personal computers
and related components amid economic weakness and a shift toward
mobile devices, such as tablets, that mainly don’t require hard
drives. Unit shipments were 58 million last quarter, Seagate
said yesterday.  Shares rose to $32.04 in  late trading  yesterday after
closing at $31.39 in  New York . Seagate climbed 85 percent last
year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
