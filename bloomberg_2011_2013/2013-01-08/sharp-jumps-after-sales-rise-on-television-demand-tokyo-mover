Sharp Corp. (6753) ,  Japan â€™s largest maker of
liquid-crystal displays, surged in Tokyo trading to become the
second-biggest gainer on the Nikkei 225 Stock Average after
saying sales rose because of demand for TVs and home appliances.  Sharp rose 3.9 percent to close at 293 yen, the largest
gain since Dec. 26. The benchmark index slid 0.9 percent.  Sales increased in each of the last four months from a year
earlier, helped by recovering demand for LCD televisions,
President Takashi Okuda told reporters in Osaka yesterday. A
weaker yen is also benefiting Sharp, which in November warned
about its ability to survive after hemorrhaging 103 billion yen
($1.2 billion) in cash from operations in the fiscal first half.  The Osaka-based company, which lost 55 percent of its
market value last year, will disclose its strategy for
increasing capital in a medium-term plan by March 31, Okuda
said. He declined to say whether Sharp is in talks to sell new
shares.  The electronics maker is also on track to boost U.S. sales
more than 10 percent for the third straight fiscal year,
Toshiyuki Osawa, head of the U.S. unit, said yesterday at the
 Consumer Electronics Show  in  Las Vegas .  To contact the reporter on this story:
