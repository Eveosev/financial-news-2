Dwight Howard  and  Pau Gasol  of the
 Los Angeles Lakers  both are out indefinitely with injuries, the
latest setback for a team that’s lost four of its past five
games and is 15-18 overall.  Howard, 27, acquired in an offseason trade with the Orlando
Magic, was diagnosed with a torn labrum in his right shoulder
yesterday after aggravating an existing injury on Jan. 5. He’ll
receive treatment from the team’s training staff and be re-
examined in a week, the Lakers said in a statement.  Gasol, 32, suffered a concussion after getting hit in the
face during the fourth quarter of the Lakers’ loss to the Denver
Nuggets two days ago. He isn’t traveling with the team to games
in Houston today and San Antonio tomorrow.  The 6-foot-11 Howard, a three-time National Basketball
Association Defensive Player of the Year, is averaging 17.3
points along with a team-leading 12.4 rebounds and 2.6 blocked
shots for the Lakers this season.  The 7-foot Gasol, a four-time All-Star, is averaging 12.2
points and 8.4 rebounds.  The Lakers have lost their past three games and are in
third place in the Western Conference’s Pacific Division.  To contact the reporter on this story:
