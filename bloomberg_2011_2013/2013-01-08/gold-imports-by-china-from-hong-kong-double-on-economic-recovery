Gold imports by  China  from  Hong Kong 
almost doubled in November from a month earlier as expectations
of an economic recovery and lower prices spurred purchases.  Mainland China bought 90,764 kilograms (90.764 metric
tons), including scrap and coins, compared with 47,478 kilograms
in October. Shipments were 11.5 percent less than the 102,603.7
kilograms a year earlier, data from the Census and Statistics
Department of the  Hong Kong government show .  Gold, which slipped 0.3 percent in November, capped the
12th year of a bull run in 2012 as investors sought to hedge
against weaker currencies after central banks around the world
took action to boost economic growth. China’s gross domestic
product is poised to expand 8.1 percent this year, up from 7.7
percent in 2012 which was the weakest pace since 1999, according
to the median estimate of economists surveyed by  Bloomberg News .  Shipments almost doubled to 720,090.6 kilograms in the
first 11 months from 392,564.4 kilograms a year earlier,
Bloomberg calculations show. Net imports, excluding flows from
China to Hong Kong, were 61,786.6 kilograms in November from
23,844 kilograms a month earlier. China doesn’t publish such
data.  Exports of gold to Hong Kong from China were 28,978
kilograms in November, up from 23,634 kilograms in October,
according to  a separate statistics  department statement.
Shipments were more than the 9,505 kilograms a year ago. They
were 281,156 kilograms in the first 11 months from 85,430
kilograms a year earlier, according to Bloomberg calculations.  Gold for immediate delivery rose 0.4 percent to $1,653.70
an ounce at 6:17 p.m. in  Singapore  today. Holdings in gold-
backed exchange-traded products were at 2,622.3 tons yesterday,
about 0.4 percent below the record set Dec. 20, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
