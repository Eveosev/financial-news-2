Egyptian television presenter Tawfiq
Okasha was acquitted of insulting and incitement to kill the
president, according to a faxed court statement.  Okasha’s political-commentary al-Faraeen satellite channel
remains off-air, today’s statement said. It was shut down on
Aug. 9 in what Okasha described as an expected move given his
anti-Islamist views.  In June,  Egypt  elected Islamist President Mohamed Mursi,
who has vowed to uphold media freedoms. Opponents say he has
since cracked down on media critical of him and his Muslim
Brotherhood allies.  In a separate case, Egyptian freelance journalist Mohamed
Sabry faces an “unfair military trial,”  Amnesty International 
said in a  statement  yesterday. He is believed to be the first
civilian to be arrested and face a military trial since Egypt
passed a new constitution in late December.  The campaign,  “No Military Trials for Civilians,” 
gathered strength after the Egyptian army took over government
in February 2011. It claimed 12,000 civilians had been tried in
military courts during 17 months of army rule, more than during
ousted President  Hosni Mubarak ’s 30-year rule.  Article 198 of the new constitution, passed by referendum,
was criticized by the campaign’s head, Mona Seif, for continuing
to allow the military trial of civilians.  To contact the reporter on this story:
