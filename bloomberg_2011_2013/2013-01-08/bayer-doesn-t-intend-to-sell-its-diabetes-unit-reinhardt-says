Bayer AG (BAYN)  no longer plans to sell its
diabetes unit, Joerg Reinhardt, chief executive officer of Bayer
Healthcare, said in an interview in San Francisco.  “We are keeping it,” Reinhardt said. “We evaluated
different options and we came to the conclusion that we continue
to be the best owner.”  Financial Times Deutschland reported in July that Panasonic
Corp. and French drugmaker Sanofi were among parties interested
in the unit. Bayer will this year focus on “bolt-on
acquisitions of mid-sized numbers” to grow in areas such as
consumer health care and  emerging markets , Reinhardt said
earlier in the day, during a question-and-answer session at the
J.P. Morgan 31st annual healthcare conference.  “There are many areas we would like to grow into” in
pharmaceuticals, Reinhardt added.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
