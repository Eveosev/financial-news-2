MMX Mineracao (MMXM3)  & Metalicos SA, the
mining company controlled by billionaire  Eike Batista , was
ordered to pay 3.76 billion reais ($1.86 billion) in back taxes,
more than four times its estimated 2012 sales. Shares fell.  Brazil’s Internal Revenue Service said taxes are due after
 Anglo American Plc (AAL)  boosted its stake in the Minas-Rio mining
business, Rio de Janeiro-based MMX said in a regulatory filing
today. The agency also claims back taxes on gains related to
share sales between companies that indirectly control the miner,
according to a regulatory filing today.  MMX, which plans to appeal the ruling, said it won’t make
provisions for the payment. The total claim is more than four
times its estimated 2012 sales of 839 million reais, the median
of 11 analysts in a Bloomberg survey.  MMX dropped 4 percent to 4.27 reais at 1:22 p.m. in Sao
Paulo. Earlier, the stock fell as much as 4.5 percent to the
lowest since Dec. 18.  To contact the reporter on this story:
