Ghana ’s cedi climbed to the strongest
level in seven weeks as foreign investors prepared to buy bonds
and as the central bank sold dollars.  The currency of the world’s second-biggest cocoa producer
appreciated 0.4 percent to 1.8915 per dollar as of 2:16 p.m. in
Accra, the capital. A close at this level would be the highest
since Nov. 20, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “We began getting inflows for the upcoming bond auction,”
Chris Nettey, a currency trader at the local unit of Standard
Bank Group Ltd., said by phone. “That was helping with
liquidity on the market.”  The central bank will sell 400 million cedis ($212 million)
worth of three-year bonds on Jan. 10, the Bank of Ghana said
yesterday. The bank expects the sale to be oversubscribed, Adams Nyinaku, head of treasury, said by phone today. The bank sold
$29 million to banks today, including $21 million to support oil
imports, Nyinaku said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
