If you take a long view of U.S. politics, the current political moment comes down to just two facts. First, President  Barack Obama ’s re-election means that most of the provisions of the Affordable Care Act will probably be permanent. It will be the largest expansion of health insurance in a half-century. Second, the tax burden on middle-class Americans has been cut nearly in half since 1980. The fiscal-cliff deal made that almost entirely permanent. The average American now gives less of his income to the federal government than at any time since perhaps the  1940s  or  1950s . Both developments were among the top headlines of 2012. More important, though, they mark the culmination of two rivaling, decades-long U.S. political projects. For modern liberals, the Affordable Care Act finished the project of building a U.S. welfare state. Though the act is not everything they desired, it achieved a goal that had  eluded  liberals: close-to-universal health care. It was the final piece of the safety net they had been creating for years. Housing assistance passed in  1934 ,  Social Security  and federal  unemployment insurance  in  1935 , disability insurance in  1956 , food assistance in  1964 , Medicare and Medicaid in  1965  and children’s health insurance in  1997 . With Obama’s re-election  guaranteeing  his administration would oversee the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, 2012 brought an end to an almost 80-year liberal political effort. The major conservative project was completed in 2012 as well: reducing federal taxation. The fiscal-cliff deal was the  largest tax cut in U.S. history , even though it raised marginal tax rates on high incomes,  capital gains  and estates. For the vast majority of Americans, the reduction in their average tax rates is now permanent -- President  George W. Bush ’s cuts were temporary and set to expire after 10 years. What isn’t permanent, the five-year extensions of a number of refundable tax credits targeted for low-income households, has long-term support from both Democrats and Republicans. Victory for the conservative project, which began under President  Ronald Reagan , looks like an federal tax rate of about  10 percent  for the average U.S. household. Before Reagan, such households paid almost 20 percent of their income in taxes. For both parties, coming to the end of a political project means having to find a new one. For liberals, administering the welfare state isn't a political task; it's an administrative and technocratic project. For conservatives, any further cuts to middle-class tax rates will "starve the beast" so severely it will mark an effective return to the political project conservatives abandoned in the 1950s, when Senator Robert A. Taft died and  Dwight D. Eisenhower  became president: undoing the New Deal. This crossroads is something members of both political parties understand. Republicans have entered into a  period of disarray and internal debate  not only because they were forced to accept a relatively small increase in federal taxes, but also -- and perhaps more so -- because they legitimately do not know what the  Republican Party  will fight for in the coming years. The same rethink is happening, though it produces less tumult, for Democrats. Exhibit A is a president who often styles himself a principled pragmatist, a nonideologue who puts results before dogma. His  renomination address  to the Democratic National Convention, for instance,  lacked  what President  George H. W. Bush  once called " the vision thing ." Obama offered a few policy ideas, for sure, but no overarching mission for a new liberal political project. Though neither liberals nor conservatives have embraced new goals as large as creating a welfare state or cutting taxes, both are beginning to propose the outlines of such agendas. Liberals seem to be weighing a "War on Poverty"-type effort against inequality of economic opportunity. That was Obama’s focus in his  re-election victory speech , which  analysts   found   substantive  precisely because it began to articulate anew the goals of the liberal project. But we can also see alternate claimants for the liberal focus. One is the environmental effort. The Obama administration  entertained this agenda item  in his first term without ever incorporating it into his governing plan. Another option might focus on social inequality and civil rights: improving the status of immigrants, expanding gay rights and improving minority access to quality education. Conservatives are contemplating their own options. Some within the Tea Party caucus want to take up Taft’s abandoned battle against the spending side of the welfare state, and  House Republicans , especially Budget Committee Chairman  Paul Ryan , will have to define what they want from “ entitlement reform .” Or Republicans could  recast themselves  as libertarians in support of  marijuana legalization ,  patent reform  and "pro-market, not pro-business" economic policy, as  New York  Times columnist  David Brooks  has written. Alternatively, they might take a  communitarian  path, working to rebuild  degraded social and economic institutions  that supported advancement and opportunity for the lower-middle class in the past, as Brooks’ colleague Ross Douthat has argued. The next several years will probably be political chaos. Some of that can be explained by congressional use of fiscal ultimatums in discussions on the fiscal cliff and debt ceiling. Much of it, though, will be thanks to the messy process of rediscovering political projects. (Evan Soltas is a contributor to the Ticker.  Follow  him on Twitter.)
