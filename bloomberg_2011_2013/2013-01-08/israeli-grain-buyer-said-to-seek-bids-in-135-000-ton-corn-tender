Sherutei Bar Grains Import Ltd., an
Israeli importer, is tendering for 135,000 metric tons of corn
and as much as 60,000 tons of feed wheat, barley and sorghum,
according to two people with direct knowledge of the tender.  The company is seeking three 45,000-ton cargoes of corn on
behalf of its customers for delivery between Feb. 15 and May 10,
depending on the origin, said the people who asked not to be
identified, because the tender hasnâ€™t been publicly announced.
Sherutei is looking for 5,000 tons of barley and 5,000 tons of
sorghum from  Europe , or the  Black Sea region , to be delivered in
February, they said.  The company also wants two cargoes of feed wheat, 20,000 to
25,000 tons each, for delivery between March 10 and May 10, they
said. The bids are due by Jan. 10, they said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
