Royal Bank of Canada (RY)  Chief Executive
Officer Gordon Nixon said he doesn’t plan to be the head of
 Canada ’s biggest bank into his mid 60s, though his retirement
isn’t “imminent.”  “I’ve been 12 years in this role and at some point I think
it’s appropriate to turn it over and move on,” Nixon said today
at the RBC Capital Markets Canadian bank CEO conference in
Toronto. “But I’m only 55 and hopefully have some runway
left.”  Nixon, who became head of the Toronto-based bank in 2001,
said there would be an appropriate time to transition to a new
CEO and a “natural time” for succession.  “It certainly won’t be into my mid 60s, I can assure you
on that front, but it’s not imminent either,” Nixon said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
