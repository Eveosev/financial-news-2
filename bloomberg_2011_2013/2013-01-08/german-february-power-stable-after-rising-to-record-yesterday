Power for February delivery in
 Germany  was little changed after rising to a record yesterday on
forecasts of cold weather. The equivalent French contract fell
for the first time in four days.  Baseload German next-month electricity, for supplies
delivered around the clock, rose 0.1 percent to 51.15 euros
($67.09) a megawatt-hour as of 12:30 p.m. Berlin time. The
French February contract, which yesterday rose as high as 60
euros, the most since Dec. 4, lost 0.6 percent to 59.15 euros a
megawatt-hour.  Prices surged yesterday on forecasts for freezing weather.
Low temperatures in Frankfurt are forecast to drop to minus 9
degrees Celsius (16 Fahrenheit) until Jan. 22, from 3 degrees
today. The German February contract, which gained as much as 3.2
percent yesterday to a record 51.85 euros, is unlikely to rise
above 51.50 euros in the near future, said Frank Woskowski, a
power trader at AVU AG fuer Versorgungs-Unternehmen.  “The contract failed to rise above this level on Dec. 4
and Nov. 15 and should be capped here for now,” Woskowski said
by phone from Gevelsberg, Germany.  German power for delivery in 2014, a European benchmark,
was little changed at 45.15 euros a megawatt-hour.  To contact the reporter on this story:
