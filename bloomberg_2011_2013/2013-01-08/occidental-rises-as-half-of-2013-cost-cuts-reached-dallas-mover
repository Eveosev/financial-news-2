Occidental Petroleum Corp. (OXY) , the
largest onshore crude producer in the continental U.S., rose to
the highest point in more than two months after reaching half
its 2013 target for drilling cost cuts.  Occidental climbed 2.3 percent to $81.72 at the close in
New York, the highest since Oct. 25, even as an index including
43 of the largest  energy stocks  fell 0.2 percent.  The company may have reached as much as $450 million in
2012 cost savings from tactics including simplifying well design
and using conventional drilling methods, according to a slide
presentation by Chief Executive Officer Stephen I. Chazen
released today in a company filing.  Chazen is trying to cut drilling costs 15 percent in 2013
in order to boost the Los Angeles-based company’s flagging
shares, which fell 18 percent in 2012. Occidental is about
halfway to its target, Chazen said in the slides.  “The cost issue has been a cloud over the company the last
few months,” Brian Youngberg, an analyst at Edward Jones & Co.,
said in a telephone interview today. “Hopefully this will give
investors some confidence that they’re addressing the issue.”  The cost savings should add 25 cents to 35 cents a share to
Occidental’s fourth-quarter earnings, said Youngberg, who rates
the shares a buy and doesn’t own any.  Domestic production growth for Occidental in the final
three months of 2012 may be unchanged compared with the third
quarter, but the candor about improved operational efficiency is
positive for investors, Tim Rezvan, an analyst at Sterne Agee &
Leach Inc. in  New York , said today in a telephone interview.  “They’re well on their way,” said Rezvan, who has a buy
on the stock and doesn’t own shares.  To contact the reporter on this story:
