Continental AG (CON)  is seeking to cut
interest costs with a 4.5 billion-euro ($5.9 billion) loan
refinancing, according to two people with knowledge of the
matter.  Europe ’s second-largest auto-parts supplier is offering an
initial interest rate of 200 basis points more than benchmark
rates for a 3 billion-euro five-year  credit line  and 225 basis
points for a 1.5 billion-euro three-year  term loan , said the
people, who asked not to be identified because the terms are
private. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  The Hanover, Germany-based  company  is replacing debt
facilities due 2014 including a 2.875 billion-euro term loan
paying an initial interest margin of 300 basis points more than
the euro interbank offered rate and a 2.5 billion-euro revolving
credit paying 250 basis points, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Under a revolver, money repaid can be borrowed again.  Felix Gress, a spokesman for Continental, hasn’t returned
an e-mail and a telephone call seeking comment on the financing.  The company plans to sign the refinancing this month, Chief
Financial Officer Wolfgang Schaefer said in a Dec. 21 statement.
The new deal reduces the company’s loan volume, extends the
maturity of its debt and allows for the release of collateral,
it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
