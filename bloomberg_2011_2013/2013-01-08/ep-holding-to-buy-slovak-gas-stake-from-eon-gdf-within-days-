Energeticky & Prumyslovy Holding AS,
the second-largest Czech utility that’s co-owned by billionaire
 Petr Kellner , said it will buy a 49 percent stake in a Slovak
utility from EON SE and  GDF Suez (GSZ)  SA “within days.”  EPH, which owns assets in the Czech Republic, Germany and
Poland, is finalizing the purchase of the stake in Slovensky
Plynarensky Priemysel AS, according to Daniel Castvaj, a company
spokesman. He declined to disclose the price. GDF Suez spokesman
Jerome Chambin declined to comment, as did Alexander Ihl, a
spokesman for EON.  The sale required approval by the Slovak government, which
owns the remaining 51 percent of SPP, the country’s dominant gas
company. The government cleared the sale of Slovak Gas Holding
BV, the joint venture that owns the 49 percent stake in SPP,
last month after EPH agreed to Premier  Robert Fico ’s conditions
regarding price regulation.  The sale of the SPP stake is part of efforts by EON and GDF
Suez to cut operating costs and lower debt. GDF Suez wants to
sell 11 billion euros ($14.4 billion) of assets this year and
next to help lower net debt to 30 billion euros. EON has already
sold more than 14 billion euros of assets out of its 15 billion-
euro disposal program.  EPH, which is based in Prague, is also bidding for Czech
pipeline operator Net4Gas, owned by  RWE AG (RWE) , to gain control over
the transit of Russian gas from the east, Daniel Kretinsky, one
of the company’s owners, said last month.  EPH reported net income of 8.48 billion koruna ($436
million) for the first nine months of 2012, Castvaj said by
phone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
