Japanese stock futures fell,
indicating the benchmark Nikkei 225 Stock Average may drop for a
third day, amid concern a three-month slide by the yen that
helped boost the equity market already accounts for potential
stimulus measures.  American Depositary Receipts  of Nissan Motor Co., a
Japanese carmaker that derives almost 80 percent of sales
overseas, slid 1 percent. Shares of  Mitsubishi Electric Corp. (6503) , a
maker of air-conditioners and satellites, may be active as
 Mizuho Securities  downgraded its recommendation on the shares.  Futures on Japan’s Nikkei 225 expiring in March closed at
10,425 in Chicago yesterday, down from 10,480 at the close in
Osaka, Japan. They were bid in the pre-market at 10,420 in Osaka
at 8:05 a.m. local time. A third day of declines for the equity
gauge today would cap its longest losing streak since November.
Australia’s  S&P/ASX 200 Index (AS51)  gained 0.4 percent and New
Zealand’s NZX 50 Index advanced 0.3 percent.  “With investors now having digested the news from the  Bank
of Japan  and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe that Japan will stimulate
its economy later this month, the yen has now appreciated
against all but one major trading pair, showing that more may
need to be done to hold the currency down,” said Evan Lucas, a
Melbourne-based markets strategist at IG Markets Ltd., a
provider of equities, currencies and commodities trading
services.  Election Boost  The  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  surged 21 percent though yesterday from
Nov. 14, when Japanese elections were announced, on expectations
Abe’s new government would call for more stimulus. The yen
tumbled 12 percent over the past three months, the worst
performer among the 10 developed-nation currencies tracked by
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. That boosts the earnings
outlook for Japanese companies that repatriate profits back to
Japan. The yen strengthened today to 86.95 per dollar.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP) , the regional benchmark,
climbed 14 percent in 2012 as central banks from the U.S.,
Europe, Japan and China took action to spur economic growth. The
gauge is traded at 14 times estimated earnings, compared with
13.1 times for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and a multiple of
11.9 for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  Futures on the  S&P 500 Index  were little changed today. The
gauge lost 0.3 percent yesterday as investors awaited results
from Alcoa Inc. to unofficially start the corporate earnings
season. Alcoa, the largest U.S. aluminum producer, rose in
after-hours trading as sales beat estimates.  The  Bloomberg China-US Equity Index (CH55BN)  of the most-traded
Chinese shares in the U.S. dropped 1.2 percent to 99.58
yesterday in New York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
