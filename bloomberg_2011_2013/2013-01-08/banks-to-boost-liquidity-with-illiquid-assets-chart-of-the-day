Regulators are allowing banks to
boost liquidity with assets that proved tough to sell when
markets froze in the 2008 credit crunch.  The CHART OF THE DAY shows how relative yields on the
lowest-rated investment-grade corporate bonds, now accepted by
regulators as liquid assets, blew out to as much as 7.3
percentage points during the crisis when investors shunned the
notes, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data.
Higher-rated AA securities, previously the minimum accepted,
held tighter than 1 percentage point over benchmarks.  The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision eased rules on
the amount and range of easy-to-sell assets lenders must have
available to cover a 30-day run on deposits or other short-term
disruptions to funding. Corporate debt, which previously had to
be graded in the top four ratings categories to be considered
liquid, now can be graded as low as BBB-, one step above junk.  “I just don’t think corporate bonds are liquid enough to
be included, especially if you need to sell in any size,” said
Chris Bowie, head of credit portfolio management at Ignis Asset
Management in  London , which oversees about $110 billion of
assets. “Banks will struggle to sell in a crisis, or if
wholesale markets close like they did in 2008.”  The Basel Committee delayed full implementation of the
rules until 2019, rather than 2015 as originally proposed.
Lenders will be permitted to use lower-rated securities to cover
as much as 15 percent of their liquidity requirements and the
value of the corporate bonds used will be discounted by 50
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
