A second inquest into the 2011 death
of  Amy Winehouse  has confirmed that her death was caused by
alcohol.  The singer and songwriter had drunk more than five times
the legal drunk-driving limit, the London inquiry heard today.  St. Pancras Coroner Shirley Radcliffe confirmed an earlier
verdict of misadventure, or accidental death. The first inquest
was ruled invalid because the previous coroner did not have the
correct qualifications.  Winehouse’s parents Mitch and Janis, who run the  Amy
Winehouse Foundation , were not present for the new hearing. The
charity aims to help young people facing ill health, disability,
financial problems or addiction.  The singer was found in July 2011 with 416 milligrams of
alcohol per deciliter of blood, a potentially fatal level and
enough to stop her breathing and send her into a coma. The U.K.
driving limit was 80 milligrams.  The singer shot to fame with “Rehab” and won five  Grammy
Awards .  U.K. coroners have a range of possible verdicts, including
natural causes, suicide, misadventure or unlawful killing.  To contact the writer of this story:
