The yen fell versus the dollar for
the first time in three days, headed back toward a 29-month low,
as Prime Minister Shinzo Abe told  Bank of Japan (8301)  governor Masaaki
Shirakawa he wants the central bank’s inflation goal doubled.  The Mexican peso and  New Zealand ’s dollar gained as risk
appetite improved.  Japan ’s currency slid versus all of its 16
most-traded peers after Shirakawa said the BOJ was in close
contact with the government, adding to bets policy makers will
boost stimulus that tends to debase the yen. The bank meets next
week. The euro fell for a second day against the greenback
before the  European Central Bank  meets tomorrow.  “The market bias is still to take the yen lower,”  Vassili Serebriakov , a foreign-exchange strategist in  New York  at BNP
Paribas SA, said in a telephone interview. “Overall markets are
still focusing on the Bank of Japan and the upward revision of
the inflation goal or target. That’s what still motivates the
selling of the yen.”  The Japanese currency weakened 0.9 percent to 87.88 per
dollar at 5 p.m. in New York. It slid on Jan. 4 to 88.41, the
weakest level since July 2010. The yen declined 0.8 percent
today to 114.81 per euro after depreciating on Jan. 2 to 115.99,
the weakest since July 2011.  The euro depreciated 0.1 percent to $1.3064 after falling
0.3 percent earlier to $1.3037. It pared losses after failing to
drop below $1.30. The currency last traded below that level Dec.
12, before rising to an eight-month high of $1.3308 on Dec. 19.  ‘Steady Feature’  “It’s been a steady feature recently,”  Sebastien Galy ,
senior foreign-exchange strategist at Societe Generale SA, said
by phone from New York. “You don’t break below $1.30, and then
bounce back.”  The  Dollar Index (DXY) , which Intercontinental Exchange Inc. uses
to track the greenback against the currencies of six major U.S.
trade partners, rose for a second day. It advanced 0.3 percent
to 80.542 after touching a six-week high of 80.868 on Jan. 4.  Mexico ’s peso rose versus all of its major counterparts,
rallying 0.6 percent to 12.7223 to the U.S. currency. The  New
Zealand dollar , nicknamed the kiwi, gained 0.4 percent to 83.96
U.S. cents and touched 84.10, the highest level since Dec. 19.  Stocks rose, snapping a two-day slide, with the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index gaining as much as 0.5 percent before trimming
the gain to 0.3 percent.  The euro may rise versus the yen to the strongest level in
almost 21 months even as it approaches a key level of
resistance, Cilline Bain, a London-based technical analyst at
Credit Suisse Group AG, wrote today in a client note.  ‘Gained Traction’  The shared currency, which is in an upward corrective
period after falling to a 12-year low in July, has “gained
traction” at 113.50 yen and should test 116.02, Bain said. If
it breaches that level, the euro may reach 121.94 yen, the
highest since April 2011, she said. Resistance is an area on a
chart where sell orders may be clustered.  The yen declined versus major peers as Abe talked with
Shirakawa at a meeting of Japan’s Council on Economic and Fiscal
Policy in  Tokyo . The regular gatherings resumed today after
being abolished by the previous government. Minutes will become
available three business days after the meetings are held,
according to the Cabinet Office.  Abe said the BOJ should aim for 2 percent inflation, double
the current goal.  “The yen is going to continue to weaken further from
here,” said  Fabian Eliasson , vice president of corporate
foreign-exchange sales at  Mizuho Financial Group Inc. (8411)  in New
York. “You have BOJ meetings coming up where I think further
stimulus will be added into the market. I think they’re going to
continue to support a weaker yen.”  BOJ Meeting  The BOJ pledged last month to reconsider its inflation
target at its next board meeting on Jan. 21-22. Finance Minister
Taro Aso said last week that cooperation between the government
and central bank was important for ending deflation, which he
said is the government’s biggest economic priority. Shirakawa’s
five-year term ends on April 8.  The yen has tumbled 7 percent over the past month, the
worst performer among the 10 developed-nation currencies tracked
by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes, as Abe was elected
with a pledge to increase monetary stimulus to spur growth. The
dollar weakened 0.3 percent, while the euro gained 0.8 percent.  “We have been expecting a weaker yen for the longest time,
and finally we saw that move after the elections in Japan and
prospects for more easing by Bank of Japan,” Sireen Harajli, a
foreign-exchange strategist in New York at Credit Agricole SA,
said in a telephone interview.  The ECB will keep its main refinancing rate at a record-low
0.75 percent tomorrow, according to the median forecast of 55
analysts in a Bloomberg survey. Five predicted the central bank
will lower the rate to 0.5 percent.  Zloty Climbs  The Polish zloty rallied after  Marek Belka , Narodowy Bank
Polski governor, said the central bank may pause in its easing
cycle after lowering  interest rates  today for a third month.  The currency gained as much as 0.8 percent to 3.117 to the
dollar, the biggest intraday jump in a week, before trading at
3.1212, up 0.6 percent.  Sterling fell to the lowest level against the dollar since
Nov. 30 after data showed Britain’s trade deficit was little
changed in November as exports rose, led by chemicals and
intermediate goods. The pound touched $1.5993 before trading at
$1.6023, down 0.2 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
