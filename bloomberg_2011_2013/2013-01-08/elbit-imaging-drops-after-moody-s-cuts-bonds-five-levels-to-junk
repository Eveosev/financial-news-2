  Elbit Imaging Ltd. (EMIT)  bonds tumbled for
a fourth day after Moody’s Midroog cut the credit rating of the
Israeli real estate and medical investments holding company five
levels to junk. The benchmak  government bonds  were little
changed.  The yield on Elbit Imaging’s 5 percent bonds due April 2020
gained 12 basis points, or 0.12 percentage point, to 49.41
percent at 2:42 p.m. in Tel Aviv, the highest since Dec. 31. The
company faces more than 600 million shekels in debt payments
this year and has reserves of about 80 million shekels, Moody’s
said, lowering the rating for all of the company’s series A
through Series G notes and series 1 notes to B2. The shares
dropped 3.3 percent to 6.61 shekels.  “The ratings cut is based on the continued fast
deterioration of liquidity, without the creation of sufficient
sources to face in the long term the weight of repayments,”
Moody’s said after the market closed yesterday. “In the light
of this and in light of an absence of access to  capital markets ,
the company faces a significant challenge to meet its liquidity
needs in the coming year.”  Elbit Imaging expects to receive more than 200 million
shekels in 2013 from the sale of assets in the U.S.,  London  and
Holland, Moody’s said. The bonds were downgraded by Standard &
Poor’s Maalot to ilB/Negative from ilBBB/Negative in December.  The yield on the 5.5 percent Mimshal Shiklit government
notes due in January 2022 fell 3 basis points, or 0.03
percentage point, to 3.81 percent.The shekel advanced for a
second day, gaining 0.2 percent to 3.7636 per dollar, which
weakened against 23 out of 31 expanded major currencies tracked
by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
