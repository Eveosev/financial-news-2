The dollar may advance to 94 yen, the
strongest since May 2010, after a short-term setback this week,
UBS AG said, citing trading patterns.  UBS plans to buy dollars at 86.70 yen, which is above the
38 percent retracement of the greenback’s recent rally,  Richard Adcock , a foreign-exchange and fixed-income technical strategist
in  London , wrote in a note dated yesterday.  Stop-loss orders should be set at 85.40 yen, which is below
the 62 percent retracement, according to Adcock, citing
Fibonacci levels. A stop-loss is an automatic instruction to buy
or sell a currency at a certain level to limit losses.  “There is no major resistance until 94.134, the 38 percent
retracement of the June 2007 to October 2011 sell-off,” Adcock
wrote. Resistance is where sell orders may be clustered. “We
look to re-enter longs into setback to 86.70.”  The U.S. currency fell 0.3 percent to 87.55 yen at 1:35
p.m. in  Tokyo , down 0.7 percent this week. It touched 88.41 on
Jan. 4, the strongest since July 2010.  Fibonacci analysis is based on a theory that prices rise or
fall by certain percentages after reaching a high or low. Key
percentage levels include 23.6, 38.2, 50, 61.8 and 76.4.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
