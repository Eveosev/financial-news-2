Aerosvit, a private Ukrainian
airline, canceled 17 domestic and international flights as it
struggles to pay its bills.  Aerosvit dropped eight arrivals and nine departures, Kiev
Boryspil Airport said on its website today, warning passengers
of “possible deviations” in the carriers’ flight schedule in
the coming days.  The airline has been under a bankruptcy procedure since
Dec. 29, according to the website of the national registry for
court decisions, with outstanding debts of 4.27 billion hryvnia
($520 million) as of Dec. 27 and assets of 1.47 billion hryvnia
as of Nov. 30, according to court documents.  It canceled Kiev-bounds flight from Budapest on Jan. 7,
flights from  Stockholm  and Tel-Aviv on Jan. 6 and from  Ho Chi
Minh City  on Jan. 7, the country’s Foreign Affairs Ministry said
by e-mail yesterday. A Jan. 6 flight from  New York  and a Jan. 5
flight from Stockholm were delayed.  The company made a partial advance payment to Kiev Boryspil
Airport for services on Jan. 4. Outgoing flights from Boryspil
will not have ground service from tomorrow should it fail to pay
remaining service fees, the airport said last week.  Serhiy Kutsyi, Aerosvit’s spokesman, didn’t answer calls
from  Bloomberg News  today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
