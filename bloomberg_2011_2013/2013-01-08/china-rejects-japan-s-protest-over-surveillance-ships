China said it doesn’t accept Japan’s
protest over surveillance ships that approached islands in the
 East China Sea  claimed by both sides.  The ships were conducting normal duties around Chinese
territory, Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei told a briefing
in Beijing today.  Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga today said
the government summoned the Chinese ambassador to protest the
presence of four surveillance ships near the islands, known as
Senkaku in Japanese and Diaoyu in Chinese.  To contact  Bloomberg News  staff for this story:
