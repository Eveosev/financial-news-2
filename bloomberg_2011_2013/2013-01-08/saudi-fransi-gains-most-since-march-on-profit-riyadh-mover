Banque Saudi Fransi (BSFR) , partly owned by
 Credit Agricole SA (ACA) , rose the most in almost 10 months after the
lender’s fourth-quarter profit beat analysts’ estimates.  Shares in the Riyadh-based bank rose as much as 5.1 percent
to 30.9 riyals, the highest intraday price since March 24, and
were trading at 30.6 riyals as of 12:16 p.m. local time.  Fourth quarter net income rose to 808 million riyals
($215.5 million) from 661 million riyals, the lender said in a
statement yesterday. The bank had been expected to post net
income of 750 million riyals, the mean estimate of five
analysts, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Earnings per
share rose to 3.34 riyals from 3.22 riyals, the bank said.  “This is an encouraging start to the Saudi banks’
reporting,”  JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM)  analysts, including Naresh Bilandani and Christian Kern, wrote in a note to clients. It
“will likely set upbeat expectations for full-year reporting of
peers, given investor concerns on the sector post a damp third
quarter.”  Saudi Arabian lenders are benefiting from lending to
government projects as the world’s top oil exporter pursues more
than $500 billion of investments to develop infrastructure and
create jobs.  Al-Rajhi Bank (RJHI) , the kingdom’s biggest lender by
market value, will probably post a 7 percent increase in 2012
net income next week to 7.92 billion riyals, according to the
mean estimate of fourteen analysts compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporters on this story:
