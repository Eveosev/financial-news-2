Dustin Johnson takes a three-shot
lead into the final round of the U.S. PGA Tour’s season-opening
Tournament of Champions in  Hawaii .  After windy conditions canceled play for three straight
days at the Kapalua Resort’s Plantation Course in Maui, Johnson
shot 11 under par over 36 holes yesterday. He opened with a 4-
under 69 and followed it up with a 66 that included an eagle on
the par-5 18th hole.  Defending champion Steve Stricker is in second place at 8
under, with 2012 Masters Tournament winner Bubba Watson a stroke
further back. Keegan Bradley and Brandt Snedeker are tied for
fourth place in the 30-golfer field of 2012 PGA Tour winners, at
6 under par.  The tournament is scheduled to conclude with 18 holes today,
with the winner receiving $1.12 million. The PGA Tour’s last 54-
hole event was the 2011 Barclays Tournament at Plainfield
Country Club in Edison, New Jersey, which was shortened to three
rounds because of a hurricane.  The PGA Tour’s second event, the $5.7 million Sony Open, is
scheduled to start Jan. 10 in Honolulu.  To contact the reporter on this story:
