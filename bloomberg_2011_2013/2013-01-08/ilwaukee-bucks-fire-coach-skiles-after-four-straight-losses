The Milwaukee Bucks fired coach Scott
Skiles after the team lost its fourth consecutive game.  The Bucks are 16-16, trailing the Chicago Bulls and  Indiana
Pacers  by three games in the  National Basketball Association ’s
Central Division. Milwaukee lost to Indiana in its last game,
95-80 on Jan. 5.  “I believe this team can and will have success in the next
50 games and postseason,” Skiles said in a statement. “I want
to thank the players for all of their hard work.”  Assistant Jim Boylan will assume the head coaching role for
the remainder of the season, the team said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
