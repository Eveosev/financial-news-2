The leu retreated from an eight-month
high after  Romania ’s central bank signaled it may relax a three-
month old cap on leu sales at its weekly repurchase agreements
auctions.  The currency weakened less than 0.1 percent to 4.4066 per
euro by 4:55 p.m. in Bucharest, after strengthening to its
highest level since May 4 yesterday, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. Yields on Romania’s June 2016 euro-denominated
bonds rose four basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 3.09
percent.  The Banca Nationala a Romaniei held its benchmark rate at a
record low of 5.25 percent yesterday, the second-highest in the
European Union after  Hungary . The central bank, which has capped
leu sales since October to prop up the currency, said it will
seek “to ensure an adequate liquidity management” at its
monetary policy committee meeting.  “The central bank removed the term ‘firm liquidity
management’ introduced in the previous statement,” Vlad Muscalu, a Bucharest-based economist at ING Bank Romania SA
wrote in a note. “The adjustment suggests the bank will soon
soften its repo cap, raise or abandon it. Hinting at easing
liquidity conditions was definitely not expected.”  Policy makers extended a 4 billion-lei ($1.2 billion) limit
on repo sales for a seventh week, after first capping the amount
at 6 billion lei on Oct. 8 when the leu had sunk to its two-
month low. Demand for leu from commercial banks totaled 24.9
billion lei at the auction yesterday.  To contact the reporters on this story:
