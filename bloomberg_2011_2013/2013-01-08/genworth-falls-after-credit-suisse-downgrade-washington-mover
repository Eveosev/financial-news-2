Genworth Financial Inc. (GNW) , the insurer
that brought on a new chief executive officer last week,
declined in  New York  trading after Credit Suisse Group AG
downgraded the company on risks from long-term care coverage.  Genworth fell 3.5 percent to $8.04 at 4 p.m., the  biggest
drop  in the 80-company Standard & Poor’s 500 Financials Index.
The Richmond, Virginia-based firm, which also has a mortgage-
insurance unit, had surged 50 percent in the six months ended
yesterday as the real estate slump abated.  “Much of the rally has been the result of optimism for
Genworth’s U.S. mortgage insurance unit as a derivative play on
the U.S. housing market,” Credit Suisse analysts led by Thomas Gallagher said in a note today, cutting the company to
underperform from neutral. “Investors have been less focused on
fundamentals in the life insurance operations.”  Thomas J. McInerney, a former executive at  ING Groep NV (INGA) ,
was hired as Genworth’s new CEO after the stock plunged more
than 80 percent since the end of 2006. The insurer has been
increasing its focus on long-term care coverage, which helps
policyholders pay for home-health aides or residence in nursing
homes or assisted-living facilities.  Rivals including  MetLife Inc. (MET)  and Prudential Financial Inc.
have retreated from long-term care as near record-low interest
rates pressure returns on funds held for as long as decades to
back policies.  Long-term care is the “most interest-rate sensitive line
of business,” the analysts wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
