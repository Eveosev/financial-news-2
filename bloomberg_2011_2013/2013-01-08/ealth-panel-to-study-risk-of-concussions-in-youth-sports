The risk of concussions from youth
sports is being studied by a U.S. advisory medical panel as
college and professional leagues have increased their scrutiny
of potential sports-related brain injuries.  The  Institute of Medicine  has begun an investigation into
concussions related to sports for players from elementary school
age through young adulthood, the group said in a  posting  on its
website. The panel will review risk factors, screening and
diagnosis, as well as treatment and long-term consequences, it
said in the statement. The Washington-based nonprofit
organization provides advice to policy makers and the public.  Previous research has found that football is the deadliest
sport among young athletes, and deaths may have been prevented
if athletes with head injuries had been kept off the field,
according to a 2011 study in the journal Pediatrics. A study
published yesterday in the journal JAMA Neurology found physical
abnormalities in the brains of former NFL players, when compared
to peers.  The IOM panel said it will review available information on
concussions, especially in the context of the maturing brain,
and review the effectiveness of protective equipment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
