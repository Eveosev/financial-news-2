Invenergy LLC, a closely held
renewable-energy developer, received a $500 million equity
investment from the institutional fund manager Caisse de Depot
et Placement du  Quebec  for 13 operating wind farms.  The power plants have total capacity of about 1,500
megawatts, the Chicago-based developer said today in a
statement. Two are in  Canada  and 11 are in the U.S, including
the 138.6-megawatt Le Plateau wind farm in Quebec’s Gaspesie
region, which sells all of its electricity to the provincial
utility Hydro-Quebec.  Invenergy is retaining a majority stake in all of the wind
farms, according to the statement. The names of the other
projects weren’t disclosed.  “In addition to generating stable and predictable long-
term returns, the projects will enable us to broaden our
presence in a forward-looking sector -- renewable energy,”
Macky Tall, senior vice president of infrastructure at Caisse,
said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
