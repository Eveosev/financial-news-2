The forint, the world’s second-best
performing currency in 2012, will extend gains as  Hungary 
prevents its  budget deficit  from widening and the central bank
slows interest-rate cuts, according to CIB Bank Zrt.  The forint appreciated 8.1 percent in 2012, the biggest
gain among more than 100 currencies tracked by Bloomberg after
the zloty’s 9.3 percent advance. The currency of Hungary, the
most indebted nation in the east of the European Union, weakened
0.2 percent to 292.14 per euro by 4:16 p.m. in Budapest.  Hungary’s currency may appreciate to 285 per euro by the
end of this quarter, reach 282 in June and 280 by year-end, said
Budapest-based CIB, a unit of  Intesa Sanpaolo SpA. (ISP)  CIB was the
most accurate forecaster for the euro-forint  exchange rate  in
the six quarters through December, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  The Magyar Nemzeti Bank, which cut its benchmark rate by a
cumulative 1.25 percentage points in five consecutive months
last year to 5.75 percent, may slow monetary easing this year,
said Sandor Jobbagy, an analyst at CIB. The forint will also be
supported by the government’s efforts to keep the deficit within
the EU’s prescribed limit of 3 percent of gross domestic product
and by Hungary’s surplus in foreign trade and current account,
he said.  “There may be a slight appreciation if we look at the
whole year,” Jobbagy said by phone today.  CIB’s euro-forint forecasts for the first quarter and the
end of 2013 match the median of 19 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg. The median projection for mid-2013 is 285 per euro.  To contact the reporter on this story:
