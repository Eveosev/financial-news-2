Private-equity funds in China are
still holding 82 percent of the companies they’ve invested in
since 2007, as the frozen market for initial public offerings
keeps them from exiting, a study showed.  Funds hold 6,584 companies after disposing of 1,445 and
seeing 20 go bankrupt, according to a report from  China First
Capital , a Shenzhen-based firm that advises on private equity
and mergers. Investors still hold companies valued at $94.3
billion, compared with a total of $194.7 billion, according to
public data compiled by the firm and its own research.  China’s IPO market has been shuttered by regulatory delays,
while concern that accounts have been misstated has closed off
U.S. bourses to Chinese companies. Firms are under pressure to
return money to investors as funds raised several years ago
approach the end of their cycle, while the market for sales to
industry investors or other funds remains underdeveloped.  “The larger issue has been one of reduced access to public
markets for PE invested deals, rather than simply lower
valuations,” said the  China  First Capital report. Private
equity in China is “over-allocated to IPO exit.”  The backlog of IPOs pending approval in China grew to more
than 800 in December as regulators stopped allowing new
offerings on concern that they may weigh on the market.
Companies raised $14.6 billion through IPOs last year in
mainland China, down 64 percent from 2011, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  Private equity firms in China have raised $137.7 billion
since 2007, including a record $48.1 billion in 2011, according
to the Asian Venture Capital Journal. Meanwhile, new investments
fell 27 percent to $21.9 billion last year, the biggest drop
ever, according to AVCJ.  Of 7,500 unexited investments since 2001, at least 200 of
them are “quality secondaries,” or companies that have grown
25 percent a year since the original investment and can be sold
to another private-equity fund, China First Capital said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
