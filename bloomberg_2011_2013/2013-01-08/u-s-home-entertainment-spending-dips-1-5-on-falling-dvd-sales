U.S. consumers trimmed their spending
on home entertainment by 1.5 percent in the fourth quarter,
cutting outlays on DVDs for rental and purchase.  Spending totaled $5.66 billion in the final three months of
2012, down from $5.74 billion a year earlier, the Hollywood-
backed  Digital Entertainment Group  said today in a statement.
For the year, spending rose 0.2 percent to $18 billion, the Los
Angeles-based group said.  Studios have been counting on growth in digital sales,
streaming services and Blu-ray discs to counter faltering
purchases and rentals of traditional DVDs. For the quarter,
consumer outlays on downloads, video on demand and subscription
services increased 25 percent to $1.49 billion, the group said.
They rose 28 percent for the year.  Subscription DVD services shrank by 31 percent for the
quarter and 28 percent for the year, while store rentals fell
5.1 percent and 24 percent in the periods, respectively. Kiosk
rentals grew at a slower pace of 7.8 percent in the final three
months, compared with 16 percent for the year.  Spending on DVDs continued to tumble. While Blu-ray
purchases increased almost 10 percent for the year, total
spending on packaged media slumped 5.5 percent, the group said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
