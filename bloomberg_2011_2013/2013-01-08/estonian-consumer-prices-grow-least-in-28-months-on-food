Estonian  inflation  slowed to the
weakest pace in 28 months in December on lower food and
transport costs.  Consumer prices rose 3.5 percent from a year earlier, the
least since August 2010, compared with a 3.6 percent advance the
previous month, the statistics office, based in the capital,
Tallinn, said on its website today. That’s in line with the 3.5
percent median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of three analysts.
Prices fell 0.1 percent from November.  Declines in oil and food costs slowed last year’s average
annual inflation in the newest euro-area member to 3.9 percent
from 5 percent in 2011, the statistics office said.  In December, food was 5.4 percent more expensive than a
year earlier, compared with 5.8 percent in November. Transport
costs increased 0.6 percent from a year earlier last month, down
from 1.6 percent in November.  This year, inflation will be temporarily boosted in January
by Estonia’s electricity market opening and as state-owned
utility AS Eesti Energia starts buying carbon-emission quotas
from the market, the central bank said last month. Inflation may
be further boosted by large structural  unemployment , labor
deficit and higher-than-forecast  oil prices , the bank said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
