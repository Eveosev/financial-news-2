Oil was little changed in New York as
rising prices of gasoline and heating oil countered expectations
that U.S. stockpiles rose from a three-month low last week.  Prices moved less than 21 cents for the fourth straight day
as products jumped after Motiva Enterprises LLC shut a crude
unit at its Port Arthur, Texas, refinery and  inventories  were
expected to gain 2 million barrels, according to a Bloomberg
survey before an Energy Department report tomorrow.  “The strong product prices are offset by the fact that we
are expecting a crude inventory build,” said Phil Flynn, senior
market analyst at the Price Futures Group in  Chicago . “There is
an expectation that inventories will rise and that’s one of the
reasons that crude is more subdued than products.”  Crude oil for February delivery slid 4 cents to settle at
$93.15 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Prices are
down 8.3 percent in the past year. Trading volume was 17 percent
below the 100-day average at the close of floor trading.  Prices were little changed after the American Petroleum
Institute said U.S. oil inventories grew 2.36 million barrels a
day last week to 360.8 million. Crude was up 2 cents at $93.21 a
barrel at 4:33 p.m. in electronic trading.  Brent oil for February settlement advanced 54 cents, or 0.5
percent, to end at $111.94 a barrel on the London-based ICE
Futures Europe exchange. Brent volume was 24 percent above the
100-day average at the settlement.  Premium Widens  Brent’s premium over West Texas Intermediate oil in New
York widened to $18.79 from $18.21, the first increase in four
days. The premium has narrowed from $25.53 on Nov. 15 as
 Enterprise Products Partners LP (EPD)  and  Enbridge Inc. (ENB)  prepare to
resume service on the 500-mile (805-kilometer) Seaway link at
full rates after more than doubling its capacity to 400,000
barrels a day from 150,000.  Gasoline and heating oil advanced by at least 0.5 percent
for a second day as Motiva shut down the 325,000-barrel-a-day
crude unit on Jan. 6 after trying to restart it when a clamp
that was modified to fix an earlier leak failed.  The crude unit, the largest of three at Port Arthur, shut
for repairs several days after its May debut. It’s a key part of
a $10 billion expansion that will almost double the plant’s
processing capacity to 600,000 barrels a day.  Gasoline for February delivery rose 1.7 cents, or 0.6
percent, to settle at $2.7944. February heating oil advanced
2.64 cents, or 0.9 percent, to $3.0585.  “There was strength in products, the Motiva situation in
particular, that’s giving oil support,” said John Kilduff, a
partner at Again Capital LLC, a New York-based hedge fund that
focuses on energy.  Watching Stockpiles  Oil stockpiles increased by 0.6 percent to 362 million in
the seven days ended Jan. 4, according to the median of 10
analyst estimates in the Bloomberg survey. Eight respondents
forecast a gain and two a decrease.  Inventories tumbled 11.1 million barrels in the week ended
Dec. 28 as imports dropped to a 13-year low. Stockpiles have
 decreased  during December and risen in January for the past six
years because of inventory shifts for tax and accounting
purposes. Companies in Gulf Coast states minimize supplies at
the end of the year to reduce local taxes.  “It won’t shock me at all if we end up having a 5 million
to 6 million build,” said Bill O’Grady, chief market strategist
at Confluence Investment Management in St. Louis, which oversees
$1.4 billion. “It’s not uncommon to have big drops at the end
of year and that’s done for tax purposes.”  ‘Following Stocks’  Oil rose as much as 0.7 percent in intraday trading before
slipping with equities and the euro. The Standard & Poor’s 500
Index dropped as much as 0.7 percent. The euro fell as much as
0.5 percent against the dollar to $1.3057. A weaker euro and
stronger dollar reduce oil’s appeal as an investment
alternative.  “Oil is following stocks,” said Bill Baruch, a senior
market strategist at Iitrader.com in Chicago. Earlier “the
whole energy complex is higher due to strong products.”  The Energy Department increased oil-price projections for
2013 and boosted the global consumption forecast. WTI will
average  $89.54 a barrel  this year, up 1.3 percent from the
December projection of $88.38, the department said today in its
monthly Short-Term Energy Outlook. Brent will average $105.17 a
barrel in 2013, up 1.4 percent from last month’s forecast.  The department  increased its projection  for global oil
consumption this year to 90.11 million barrels a day from 90
million last month.  WTI slid in 2012 as the U.S. shale boom deepened a glut at
Cushing,  Oklahoma , America’s biggest storage hub and the
delivery point for the New York contract. That left it at an
average $17.48 a barrel below Brent last year, versus a premium
of about 95 cents in the 10 years through 2010.  Electronic trading volume on the Nymex was 378,117
contracts as of 4:33 p.m. Volume totaled 397,682 contracts
yesterday, 18 percent below the three-month average. Open
interest was 1.47 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
