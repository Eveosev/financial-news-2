Vitol Group failed to buy a cargo of
 North Sea  Forties crude at same differential for a second day.
Statoil ASA didn’t find a buyer for January loading Ekofisk or
Oseberg grades.  Vitol booked the first very large crude carrier this year
to haul Forties to South Korea, according to Athens-based Optima
Shipbrokers Ltd.  North Sea  Vitol bid without finding a seller for a Forties cargo
loading Jan. 23 to Feb. 3 at $1.50 a barrel more than Dated
Brent, a Bloomberg survey of traders and brokers monitoring the
Platts pricing window showed. That compares with a Jan. 21 to
Jan. 23 shipment it bought at the same price on Jan. 4.  Statoil offered Oseberg lot 20130104 for loading from Jan.
22 to Jan. 24 at $1.70 more than Dated Brent, 10 cents less than
yesterday, according to the survey.  The Norway-based producer also offered Ekofisk consignment
C11318 for loading from Jan. 25 to Jan. 27 at $1.60 more than
Dated Brent without finding a buyer while Vitol bid for a lot
loading from Feb. 1 to Feb. 3 at plus $1.35, the survey showed.  Reported crude trading typically occurs during the Platts
window, which ends at 4:30 p.m.  London  time. Forties loading in
10 to 25 days rose to $1.54 more than Dated Brent, data compiled
by Bloomberg show. That compares with a $1.49 premium in the
previous session and is the most since March 9.  Brent for February settlement traded at $111.69 a barrel on
the ICE Futures  Europe  exchange in London at the close of the
window, compared with $111.24 in the previous session. The March
contract was at $110.73, a discount of 96 cents to February.  Vitol chartered the Hanjin Ras Tanura supertanker to load
about 275,000 metric tons of the grade on Jan. 25 from Hound
Point in the U.K. at a cost of $5.95 million, according to a
fixture report e-mailed by Optima. Hound Point is the loading
terminal for the Forties blend of North Sea crude. The VLCC,
operated by the Hanjin Shipping Co., is the first cargo bound
for  South Korea  this year, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  A call to the Hanjin’s headquarters in  Seoul  outside of
regular office hours wasn’t answered. A London-based Vitol
official, who asked not to be identified because of policy,
declined to comment by phone.  Vitol hired another VLCC, the Umm Al Aish, for loading in
the first week of January that was later canceled, according to
fixture lists from Optima.  BP Plc forecast the share of the Buzzard crude in the
Forties blend to be at 37 percent this month, 40.1 percent for
February, 39 percent in March and 39.6 percent in April,
according to a statement on its  website .  Mediterranean/Urals  There were no bids or offers for Russian Urals crude for a
fourth day, according to the Platts survey.  The Urals differential to Dated Brent in the Mediterranean
was at minus 80 cents, 5 cents narrower than yesterday,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. In northwest Europe,
the  discount  increased to $1.35 from $1.25 in the previous
session, the data showed.  Iraq will ship 40 cargoes of Basrah Light crude from the
 Persian Gulf  in January, according to a loading program obtained
by  Bloomberg News .  A total of about 64.6 million barrels, or 2.08 million
barrels a day of the blend will be exported from the Basrah Oil
Terminal, according to the plan. This compares with 2.35 million
a day in the first half of December.  West Africa  Benchmark Nigerian Qua Iboe blend was unchanged at $2.38 a
barrel more than Dated Brent, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
