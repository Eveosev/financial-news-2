Corn futures rose for the second
straight day on speculation that the  U.S. Department of
Agriculture  will lower its crop projectins following the most-
severe Midwest drought since the 1930s. Wheat and soybeans fell.  The 2012 harvest probably was 10.65 billion bushels, down
0.7 percent from the USDA’s  estimate  in December, according to a
Bloomberg News survey of 31 analysts. Corn futures reached a
record $8.49 a bushel on Aug. 10. The USDA is set to release its
latest crop statistics on Jan. 11.  “It scares me that everybody is thinking production will
be lowered because our stockpiles are already low enough,”
Darrell Holaday, the president of Advanced Market Concepts in
Wamego,  Kansas , said in a telephone interview. “If we come in
even 100 million bushels lower on production, there’s room for
prices to go higher.”  Corn futures for March delivery gained 0.5 percent to
settle at $6.8875 a bushel at 2 p.m. on the Chicago Board of
Trade. The price, up 0.8 percent yesterday, has gained 7 percent
in the past 12 months.  Wheat futures for March delivery fell 0.1 percent at $7.505
a bushel. The price has gained 20 percent in the past 12 months.  Soybean futures for March delivery dropped 0.1 percent to
$13.865 a bushel. The oilseed has advanced 16 percent in the
past 12 months.  Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, followed by soybeans, hay
and wheat, USDA data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
