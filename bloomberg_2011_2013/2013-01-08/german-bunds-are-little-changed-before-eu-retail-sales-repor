Irish five-year notes surged, with
the yield dropping the most in almost seven weeks, as Prime
Minister  Enda Kenny  said a sale of the nation’s government debt
was a success.  Italian and Spanish bonds also advanced as Ireland received
orders for about 7 billion euros ($9.17 billion) for its 5.5
percent notes compared with the 2.5 billion euros the government
planned to sell, according to two people familiar with the
matter. German bunds rose after a report showed the euro
region’s unemployment rate climbed to a record in November. The
nation’s securities have had their worst start of the year since
at least 1990.  “Decent demand for Irish bonds bodes well for other
peripheral debt,” said Mohit Kumar, head of European fixed-
income strategy at Deutsche Bank AG in  London . “This is a very
positive development. Ireland has been taking a number of
positive steps that allow it to access the market again.”  Ireland’s five-year note yield dropped 12 basis points, or
0.12 percentage point, to 3.21 percent at 4:30 p.m. London time.
The rate fell as much as 13 basis points, the most since Nov.
21. The 5.5 percent security due in October 2017 rose 0.525, or
5.25 euros per 1,000-euro face amount, to 109.955.  The Dublin-based  National Treasury Management Agency  sold
about 2.5 billion euros of the 2017 notes, according to the
people familiar, who declined to be identified because they were
not authorized to speak about it. The agency said the securities
were allotted at a yield of 3.316 percent.  Irish Bailout  Ireland hired Barclays Plc,  Danske Bank A/S (DANSKE) , Davy, Royal
Bank of Scotland Group Plc and Societe Generale SA to sell the
securities. The country received a bailout in 2010 as the state
and its banks were frozen out of  capital markets . The Irish
government returned to international bond markets in July with a
sale of 4.2 billion euros of new debt.  “It is another sign of confidence of outside investors
that are looking at Ireland and see that the country has made
progress,” Kenny said today at a meeting of Bavarian lawmakers
in the southern German town of Wildbad Kreuth.  Irish bonds returned 0.5 percent this month through
yesterday, after gaining 29 percent last year, according to
indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European Federation of
Financial Analysts Societies.  Italian 10-year bond yields declined six basis points to
4.29 percent and the yield on similar-maturity Spanish debt fell
three basis points to 5.08 percent.  Economic Data  Demand for the safest securities was underpinned as a
report showed German factory orders dropped 1.8 percent in
November, after rising 3.9 percent in the previous month.
Economists had forecast a 1.4 percent decline.  The jobless rate in the 17-nation currency bloc rose to a
 record  11.8 percent in November from 11.7 percent a month
earlier. A separate report showed  retail sales  climbed 0.1
percent from October, when they dropped 1.2 percent.  “The recent economic data has been mixed and I’m not sure
if I agree with an argument that the worst is over,” said
Charles Berry, a government bond trader at Landesbank Baden-
Wuerttemberg in Stuttgart,  Germany . “Demand for top quality
will still be there in this environment.”  Germany’s  10-year bund  yield dropped three basis points to
1.49 percent after rising to 1.56 percent on Jan. 4, the highest
level since Oct. 26.  Worst Start  German bunds have lost 1.3 percent in 2013, the worst start
to a year since at least 1990, according to Bank of America
Merrill Lynch’s German Government Index.  The Netherlands sold 3.2 billion euros of three-year notes
with a zero coupon at an average yield of 0.318 percent. The
country last sold three-year debt on Nov. 27, when it auctioned
0.75 percent securities maturing in April 2015 at an average
yield of 0.129 percent.  The yield on the notes maturing in April 2015 was little
changed at 0.17 percent after the sale.  Volatility on Portuguese bonds was the highest in euro-
region markets today, followed by Dutch and Greek, according to
measures of 10-year or equivalent-maturity debt, the spread
between two- and 10-year securities, and credit default swaps.  To contact the reporters on this story:
