The Canadian government is not
considering participating in a direct military mission in the
African country of  Mali , Prime Minister Stephen Harper said.  Harper made the comment following a meeting with Benin
President Thomas Boni Yayi in Ottawa.  A military coup in Mali in March left a power vacuum in
Bamako, the capital. That enabled Touareg separatists -- many of
them former mercenaries for Libyan leader Muammar Qaddafi until
his ousting -- to join with Islamist rebels and seize the
northern half of Mali, including the ancient city of Timbuktu.  To contact the reporter on this story:
