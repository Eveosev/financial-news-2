Lindsay Corp. (LNN) , an Omaha, Nebraska-
based provider of irrigation systems, said fiscal first-quarter
revenue climbed 24 percent to $147.4 million from a year
earlier, buoyed by equipment sales during the U.S. drought.  The shares  rose  7.5 percent to $86.03 at the close in New
York, the highest since August 2008, as earnings of $1.15 a
share and revenue topped analysts’ estimates.  Irrigation equipment sales surged 33 percent to $134.2
million in the three months through November from a year earlier
as the worst U.S. drought since the 1930s Dust Bowl damaged farm
crops and cut inventories. Domestic revenue increased 59 percent
while irrigation sales overseas slipped 6 percent on lower
project revenue in the Mideast, the company said today in a
statement.  “Irrigation order volumes remained extremely robust
throughout the first quarter as drought conditions combined with
positive farmer sentiment, farm incomes and commodity prices
continued into fiscal 2013,” Chief Executive Officer Rick Parod
said in the statement. “The long-term fundamentals of the
business remain very positive as growth drivers of population
growth, expanded food production and efficient and
environmentally friendly water use remain imperative.”  The shares have climbed 55 percent over the past year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
