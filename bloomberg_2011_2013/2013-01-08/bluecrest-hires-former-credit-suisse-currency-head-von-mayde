Peter Von Maydell, the former global
head of foreign-exchange strategy at Credit Suisse Group AG,
said he has joined BlueCrest Capital Management LLP, Europe’s
third-biggest hedge fund, as a  money manager .  Von Maydell, who previously worked at Brevan Howard Asset
Management LLP and Deutsche Bank AG, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg, started at BlueCrest on Jan. 2, he said today in a
telephone interview from London. Ed Orlebar, a spokesman for the
hedge fund, declined to comment when asked if Von Maydell had
joined the company.  BlueCrest, founded by former JPMorgan Chase & Co. traders
 Michael Platt  and William Reeves, made 502 million pounds ($806
million) of fees in 2011, according to a U.K. Companies House
filing in September. That compares with 874 million pounds of
fees made during a 13-month period ended December 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
