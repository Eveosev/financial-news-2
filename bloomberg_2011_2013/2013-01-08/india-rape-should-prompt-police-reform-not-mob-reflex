In the  wake  of the savage gang rape
and killing of a 23-year-old student on a New Delhi bus last
month, many in  India  are behaving as if all can be set right,
provided the men guilty of this particular assault are made to
pay.  What’s needed instead are reforms to legal and medical
procedures for handling rape, as Indian activists have long
sought and the country’s highest court has ordered.  The popular emotional reaction to the present case, though
understandable, is unhelpful to the cause of justice. The bar
association connected to the court hearing the case, for
instance, has  banned  its 2,500 members from representing the
five men charged with the crime. Even if other lawyers
eventually represent them, their lack of counsel so far could
become grounds for an appeal.  Then, because the charges include murder, the prosecution
says it will seek the death penalty, and many Indians insist
that those found guilty be hanged. A number of officials also
propose making aggravated rape a capital crime.  Both measures would be backward steps for India. The
country hasn’t carried out a  death sentence  in almost eight
years, with the exception of the execution in November of the
surviving terrorist from the 2008 Mumbai attacks, in which 171
people died.  Backfire Potential  What’s more, attaching the death penalty to rape could
backfire. It could encourage rapists to kill their victims,
because dead women tell no tales. And police, prosecutors and
judges might be less willing to pursue rape complaints if the
accused’s life is at stake.  Already, the crime is vastly underreported in India. United
Nations figures show 63 rapes annually per 100,000 people in
 Sweden , 27 in the U.S. and just 1.8 in India.  Assuming a rape victim overcomes cultural reasons to drop a
case, such as fear of shaming her family or being deemed
unsuitable for marriage, she still faces obstacles. Police often
refuse to accept rape reports, as in the case of a 17-year-old
girl in Punjab who  committed suicide  last month after an officer
suggested she marry one of the men she said had gang-raped her.  There are medical hurdles as well. Victims are often sent
to separate facilities for treatment and various forensic tests,
so that they have to tell their painful stories and endure
intimate examinations multiple times.  Many undergo India’s notorious  “two-finger” test , in which
a doctor inserts two fingers into the vagina to test its laxity.
The doctor records either that the procedure caused the woman
pain or that it did not and she is therefore “habituated to
sex,” a notation used in court to cast doubt on a claim that sex
was forced.  Either way, the woman loses. India’s  Supreme Court  has
ruled that the test cannot be used in this way, yet the practice
continues.  As long as these barriers to prosecuting rape persist, it
will matter little what penalties India has on its books or
applies in the notorious bus case.  If India is serious about addressing rape, it must enable
cases to come to light even when a victim hasn’t been lethally
beaten, stripped and tossed on the side of the road, as the 23-
year-old Delhi student was. This means creating a  rape-response
system  that is sensitive to victims and ensures police
accountability, as a coalition of Indian activists have urged
Prime Minister  Manmohan Singh  to do.  Ideally, health care and forensic tests should be provided
at one time and place by one specially trained person, as the
 World Health Organization  advises in its  guidelines  for dealing
with victims of sexual violence. Care and exams should be
administered according to established protocols, and the two-
finger test should be banned.  Police procedures should also be made uniform. To ensure
police follow through on rape complaints, state governments must
monitor the number of cases filed, investigated and successfully
prosecuted.  And, as the Indian Supreme Court ordered in 2006,  Police
Complaint Authorities  should be established throughout the
country, so citizens can raise issues of police inaction or,
worse, participation in rape.  With these changes, the culture of impunity for rape would
begin to fade, and not just when a case becomes big news.  To contact the Bloomberg View editorial board:
