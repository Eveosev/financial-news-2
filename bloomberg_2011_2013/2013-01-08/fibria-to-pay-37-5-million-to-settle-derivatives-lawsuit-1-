Fibria Celulose SA (FIBR3) , the world’s
largest pulp producer, agreed to pay shareholders $37.5 million
to settle a lawsuit brought by a  Florida  municipal pension fund
over $2.13 billion of currency-derivative losses in 2008,
according to a court filing.  In November, lawyers in the case told a federal judge in
Miami that they had reached an agreement to settle the lawsuit
filed by the City Pension Fund for Firefighters and Police
Officers in the City of Miami Beach without disclosing the
amount.  In a Jan. 7 court filing, lawyers said Fibria agreed to pay
$37.5 million while details are still being worked out. Both
parties requested an additional 14 days to present a final
settlement for court approval.  The lawsuit was filed against Aracruz Celulose SA, a
Brazilian company that was then the world’s largest eucalyptus-
pulp maker. Sao Paulo-based Fibria was formed in 2009 after
Votorantim Celulose & Papel SA took over Aracruz.  The pension fund claimed in their complaint that Aracruz
lost more than $2 billion by purchasing currency-derivative
contracts as a “high stakes gamble” that went undisclosed to
the company’s shareholders.  The pension fund sought to proceed with their suit on
behalf of all investors who purchased Aracruz American
depositary receipts from April 7, 2008, to Oct. 2, 2008.  Joseph White, an attorney for the plaintiffs, and Douglas
P. Baumstein, who represents Fibria, couldn’t be reached
immediately for comment on the settlement.  The case is City Pension Fund for Firefighters and Police
Officers in the City of  Miami Beach  v. Aracruz Cellulose SA,
1:08-cv-23317, U.S. District Court, Southern District of Florida
(Miami).  To contact the reporter on this story:
