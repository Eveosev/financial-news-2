Copper gained for the first time in
four days as rising orders to remove the metal from the  London 
Metal Exchange warehouses in  Asia  fueled speculation that demand
in  China  is recovering. Other base metals also advanced.  Copper for delivery in three months on the London Metal
Exchange climbed as much as 0.4 percent to $8,102.50 a metric
ton, before trading at $8,075 as of 10:45 a.m. Shanghai time.
Futures for delivery in April traded little changed at 58,220
 yuan  ($9,349) a ton on the Shanghai Futures Exchange.  Orders to withdraw the metal from LME warehouses, or
 canceled warrants , have been at 29,200 tons a day in Asia since
the beginning of this year, the highest since Aug. 31. Total
canceled warrants fell to 70,275 tons yesterday from 71,575 tons
on Jan. 4, the highest since May 4.  “The inventory level along the industry chain in China is
quite low,” Lian Zheng, an analyst at Xinhu Futures Co., said
by phone from Shanghai. “Given the market consensus of a
recovering economy in the first and second quarter, there are
some restocking needs.”  China’s economy  has the potential to grow 8 percent
annually over the next 20 years should the nation reduce support
for state companies and unshackle banks, said Lin Yifu, a former
World Bank chief economist. The world’s second largest economy
is poised to grow 8.1 percent this year, from 7.7 percent in
2012, according to the median estimates of 49 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg last month.  Futures for March delivery on the Comex in New York traded
little changed at $3.6745 per pound. Nickel, zinc and aluminum
gained in London, while lead was little changed.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
