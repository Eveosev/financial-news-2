Italy’s jobless rate remained at the
highest level in more than 13 years as businesses refrained from
hiring as the country’s recession extended into a second year.  The  unemployment rate  in November held at a seasonally-
adjusted 11.1 percent, Rome-based national statistics office
Istat said in a preliminary report today. Economists had
predicted a reading of 11.2 percent, according to the  median  of
eight estimates in a Bloomberg News survey. Unemployment
remained above 10 percent for a 10th month.  Italian  household confidence  remained near a record low in
December as consumers were still pessimistic about the length of
country’s fourth recession since 2001. Still, confidence among
business executives rose in the same month after the nation’s
borrowing costs declined as Prime Minister  Mario Monti ’s
government stepped up efforts to bring the  budget deficit  under
3 percent of gross domestic product.  Italy entered the recession in the final quarter of 2011.
Both the government and the central bank expect a recovery in
the second half of 2013 amid increasing exports.  The  unemployment rate  for people between the age of 15 and
24 reached 37.1 percent, the highest since the fourth quarter of
1992.  To contact the reporter on this story:
