EDF Renewable Energy, a U.S. unit of
French utility  Electricite de France SA , has closed financing on
the 102.5-megawatt Shiloh IV Wind Project in  California .  The wind farm became operational last month and generates
electricity for about 40,000 homes, according to a statement
today from the San Diego-based company. Pacific Gas & Electric
Co. has a 25-year agreement to purchase the power.  EDF Renewables, formerly enXco, closed a sale-leaseback
deal with Union Bank of California Leasing, Inc., the third
arrangement between the companies in 2012, EDF Renewables CEO
Tristan Grimbert said in the statement. The Shiloh project
“demonstrates our ability to identify the optimal financing
solution for each individual project.”  REpower Systems SE, the German unit of Pune, India-based
 Suzlon Energy Ltd. (SUEL) , supplied 50 turbines for the project in
Solano County, California.  To contact the reporter on this story:
