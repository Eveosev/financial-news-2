Madeco SA (MADECO) , the wire producer owned by
Chile’s richest family, rose the most in 14 months after saying
it will consider splitting off its stake in a French company
into a separate unit.  Madeco’s shares advanced 7 percent to 19 pesos today in
Santiago for the biggest gain since Nov. 30, 2011.  The company’s board instructed management to begin studying
the steps required to separate the company into two, according
to a filing sent to Chile’s regulator yesterday after the market
closed. One part would hold Madeco’s holding in French wire
producer  Nexans SA. (NEX)  The second would hold interests in
industrial units such as packaging company Alusa SA and metal
tubes producer Madeco Mills SA.  Such a split could attract investors seeking more tailored
bets on the company’s operations, according to German Guerrero,
a partner at Santiago-based brokerage and asset management firm
MBI Inversiones.  “If you buy Madeco’s stock today on a bet on  Chile ’s
construction sector, you get exposure to  Europe  and maybe you
don’t want that at all,” Guerrero said in a telephone interview
from Santiago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
