An invasive type of biopsy to
diagnose the spread of skin cancer is becoming more common, even
as there remains a lack of evidence showing that the procedure
is beneficial, the  British Medical Journal  reported.  The so-called sentinel node biopsy has become standard in
the U.S., where it cost an estimated $686 million last year, BMJ
reported today in an article by a freelance journalist. Still, a
2006 study showed that the procedure failed to improve overall
survival after five years, and further analyses that might have
settled the question of effectiveness were never published,
according to the report.  In sentinel node biopsy, doctors take a sample from the
lymph node nearest to the skin cancer for testing. If it shows
that the cancer has spread to the node, patients are advised to
have some of the surrounding lymph nodes removed, according to
the article.  The procedure leads to unnecessary surgeries, which carry
with them the risk of complications, BMJ said.  Lymph nodes, found in the groin, neck and chest, are part
of the body’s immune system, collecting and destroying bacteria
and infections.  The 2006 study, published in the New England Journal of
Medicine, showed that while patients who had the biopsy lived
longer without the disease recurring, they actually didn’t live
longer lives than those who didn’t undergo the procedure,
according to BMJ. The study authors should release further
analyses of the overall survival data, the BMJ said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
