The  bull market  in U.S. equities that
began in 2009 may end this year, followed by a drop of as much
as 30 percent in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index by next year,
according to technical analysts at UBS AG.  The S&P 500 may gain 7.4 percent to as high as 1,570
forming a top for the 116 percent rally from March 2009 in late
summer this year, Michael Riesner and Marc Mueller in Zurich
wrote in a report yesterday. A “cyclical” bear market will
then follow, with the gauge dropping as low as 1,100 by 2014,
they added. The measure fell 0.3 percent to 1,461.89 yesterday.  “The March 2009 cyclical  bull market  is moving into a
mature stage and in this context, we see the  S&P 500  and risk
assets moving into a major top in 2013, followed by a new
cyclical bear into 2014,” the analysts wrote in the note.  They said the benchmark gauge began a long-term bearish
pattern in 2000 which, in turn, consisted of medium-term, or
cyclical, ups and downs. One part of this was the increase from
2009, which is now looking to reverse based on a triangular
pattern called the rising wedge forming on its price chart, the
analysts said.  The ensuing slump will not only end the current rally, it
will also complete the larger bearish trend that began at the
turn of the millennium, Riesner and Mueller wrote. Further, it
will set the stage for the start of a similarly long-term
bullish pattern about two years from now, they added.  Technical analysts describe a structural pattern as one
that lasts more than a decade and a cyclical trend as one that
goes on for several months to a few years.  Turning Point  U.S. equities are “moving into the ultimate endgame of
their structural bear market, which implies that the second half
of the decade should be much more bullish for equities based on
a new mega trend, which is selling bonds and commodities versus
buying equities,” the analysts said.  Riesner and Mueller advised investors to buy U.S. stocks in
November 2011, saying they expected a “lasting bounce” in the
 S&P 500. (SPX)  The measure advanced 14 percent in the following rally
through April 2, 2012.  Still, the analysts predicted in June the equity benchmark
would decline more than 5 percent by the end of the following
month before rebounding. The gauge added 5 percent in that time.  The S&P 500 gained 13 percent in 2012, after closing little
changed in the previous year.  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to predict changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
