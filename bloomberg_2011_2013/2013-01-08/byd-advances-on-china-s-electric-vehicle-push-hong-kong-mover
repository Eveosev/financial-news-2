BYD Co. (1211) , the Chinese carmaker partly
owned by  Warren Buffett ’s  Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A) , rose to a 10-
month high in  Hong Kong , gaining for a second day, after China
said it will encourage use of alternative energy vehicles.  BYD, China’s leading developer of electric vehicles,
climbed 2.2 percent to HK$23.65 as of the midday trading break
in Hong Kong, poised for its highest close since March 5. The
gain follows a 1.3 percent advance the previous day.  China’s cabinet said at the weekend that it will take
measures to ease traffic congestion with a goal of public
transport accounting for 60 percent of all motor vehicle use in
towns and cities. As part of the plan, the government will
encourage usage of alternative energy vehicles in the public
transportation system, potentially benefiting BYD which is
developing electric buses and taxis.  Nomura Holdings Inc. yesterday upgraded BYD to a buy from
neutral, with a target price of HK$30 from the previous HK$16,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Separately, BYD won an approval from the European Union to
sell its electric buses, the company said in a statement
yesterday. The approval allows BYD to sell the buses in all EU
member states without the need for individual national
permission, it said.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
