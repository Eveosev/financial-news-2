Canadian  stocks  erased losses in the
last half hour of trading as financial shares reversed earlier
declines and gold gained the most in a week.  Manulife Financial Corp. (MFC)  added 2.6 percent and  Bank of Nova
Scotia (BNS)  rose 0.2 percent.  Goldcorp Inc. (G)  jumped 3.2 percent, while
 Barrick Gold Corp. (ABX)  retreated 1.3 percent after it said it has
ended talks with China National Gold Group Corp. to sell its
African unit. Sears Canada Inc. lost 3.5 percent after same-
store sales fell for the nine-week period ended Dec. 29.  The  Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index (SPTSX)  rose 5.26 points,
or less than 0.1 percent, to 12,504.81 in Toronto, reversing
earlier losses of as much as 0.4 percent. The benchmark gauge
has risen 0.6 percent this year, trailing every developed market
in the world.  “We’re in a holding pattern: Everybody was waiting for the
fiscal cliff, and we had a rally after that, but now there seem
to be other mini-cliffs that the market is waiting for,” said
Anish Chopra, managing director and  fund manager  with TD Asset
Management Inc. in Toronto. The firm manages about C$204 billion
($206.5 billion).  The S&P/TSX rose 1.8 percent last week as a budget
compromise was reached in Washington that averted most of the
so-called fiscal cliff of spending cuts and tax increases.  Gold Futures  Goldcorp added 3.2 percent to C$35.81. Futures for February
delivery of the metal rose 1 percent to settle at $1,662.20 an
ounce on the Comex in New York amid increasing demand from
China, the world’s second-biggest buyer. That was the biggest
gain for a most-active contract since Dec. 31.  Materials producers and financial companies  contributed 
most to gains in the S&P/TSX as six of 10 industries rose.  Manulife added 2.6 percent to C$14.39. Bank of  Nova Scotia 
rose 0.2 percent to C$57.77.  Canadian Natural Resources Ltd. (CNQ)  declined 1.5 percent to
C$29.34 after an executive said the company needs to see higher
returns and lower costs before developing its gas projects.
Suncor Energy Inc., Canada’s largest oil producer, slipped 0.3
percent to C$33.14 and Encana Corp. declined 1.9 percent to
C$19.55.  Barrick decreased 1.3 percent to C$33.14 after cutting off
sale talks with China National for its African unit, African
Barrick Gold Plc. African Barrick was spun off by Barrick in
March 2010 and has since struggled to meet production targets
amid operational setbacks.  Sears Canada dropped 3.5 percent to C$9.70 after its
parent, Sears Holdings Corp., said the Canadian unit’s same-
store sales during the nine-week holiday shopping period slid
5.8 percent.  Fourth-quarter earnings before certain items including
taxes and interest is expected to be about half of the year-ago
result for the Canadian unit, Sears said in a statement. It
cited a decline in electronics sales as well as unseasonably
warm temperatures in most parts of  Canada .  To contact the reporter on this story:
