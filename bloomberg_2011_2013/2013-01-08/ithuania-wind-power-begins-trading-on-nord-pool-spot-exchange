Electricity from Lithuanian  wind
turbines  started trading on the Nord Pool Spot Exchange after
the Energy Ministry authorized state-controlled  Lietuvos
Energija AB (LNR1L)  to buy up power from local producers.  Trading started today on the exchange, which is owned by
Nordic and Baltic transmission system operators, the ministry in
the Lithuanian capital, Vilnius, said on its website. Lietuvos
Energija’s role is temporary, pending a public tender to choose
a permanent wind power intermediary, it said.  “All produced wind power will be offered to the market,”
the Vilnius-based company said in on its own website. “That
will ensure transparency, encourage the development of a free
market and strengthen the role of the exchange.”  Installed wind power capacity in  Lithuania  may double to
500 megawatts by 2015, the Baltic nation’s  wind energy
association  said in November. The expansion will help the
country reduce its reliance on Russian electricity imports and
offset a shortfall caused by the closure of nuclear capacity.  Grid operator  Litgrid AB (LGD1L)  said it would publish aggregate
Lithuanian wind power production plans daily by 10 a.m. in
Vilnius on its  website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
