Recurrent Energy,  Sharp Corp. (6753) ’s
renewable-power development unit, is delivering electricity from
a 38-megawatt solar farm to the Sacramento Municipal Utility
District under a 20-year agreement.  The project is Recurrent’s fourth for the California
utility. The solar farms have a combined capacity of 88
megawatts, enough to power 13,000 homes, the San Francisco-based
developer said today in a statement.  Google Inc. (GOOG)  and  KKR & Co. (KKR)  made equity investments in the
four power plants in December 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
