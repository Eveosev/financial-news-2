Telekom Austria AG (TKA) , one of two
European phone companies part-owned by  Carlos Slim ’s America
Movil SAB, forecast a fifth consecutive year of falling sales in
2013 and withheld predicting profit amid rising competition.  Revenue will decline to about 4.1 billion euros ($5.4
billion) this year, Vienna-based Telekom Austria said today in a
statement. That compares with a forecast for 2012 of 4.2 billion
euros. The company plans about 700 million in investments and a
dividend of 5 cents a share for last year and 2013.  Management expects “the challenges which characterized the
operational environment during 2012 to continue to dominate the
development in 2013,” the company said. “Due to continued low
visibility in its major markets, Telekom  Austria  Group considers
it prudent to limit the financial outlook for 2013 to revenue
and capital expenditure.”  The company, which completed a 390 million euro deal a week
ago to acquire 750,000 prepaid clients from Orange Austria,
hasn’t boosted revenue since 2008. Saturation of mobile-phone
markets in Austria and eastern  Europe , where it operates
networks in seven countries, has increased, prompting the
company to change strategy.  Stock Falls  Telekom Austria  fell  as much as 2.9 percent to 5.66 euros,
the biggest intraday drop since Nov. 30, and was trading down
1.8 percent at 9:17 a.m. in Vienna. The stock has declined 34
percent in the past 12 months, valuing the company at 2.53
billion euros.  The phone-network operator will “focus on the high-value
customer segment in its mature mobile markets,” Telekom Austria
said, adding that the new focus “will impact margins in the
short term.”  Telekom Austria twice reduced investor payout plans for
2012. The company originally set a dividend of 76 cents a share
before lowering it to 38 cents a share and then to 5 cents.  The 2013 revenue forecast is in line with analysts’
predictions, according to 15  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  Telekom Austria, which reports full-year 2012 earnings on
Feb. 28, had forecast that earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization last year would total 1.4 billion
euros to 1.45 billion euros. Analysts expect the company to
report sales of 4.26 billion euros and Ebitda of 1.42 billion
euros for 2012, according to estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
