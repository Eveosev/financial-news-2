The  Boston Celtics , playing without
suspended point guard  Rajon Rondo , defeated the New York Knicks
102-96 for their season-high third straight victory.  Paul Pierce  scored 23 points and  Kevin Garnett  added 19
points and 10 rebounds for the Celtics last night at New York’s
Madison Square Garden. Boston evened its record at 17-17 while
playing without Rondo, an All-Star who yesterday received a one-
game ban from the National Basketball Association for making
contact with a referee two days ago.  J.R. Smith led the Knicks with 24 points, while Carmelo Anthony had 20 on 6-of-26 shooting.  New York, which leads the Eastern Conference’s Atlantic
Division with a 23-11 record, was limited to 41 percent shooting
and had a two-game winning streak snapped.  Anthony and Garnett were each given technical fouls after a
confrontation in the fourth quarter.  ESPN reported  that the
Knicks player got into an altercation with Garnett after the
match, and city police officers and security guards were
required to break up the  incident  near the Celtics’ bus. Knicks
coach  Mike Woodson  helped calm Anthony, the website said.  The Washington Wizards, who have the NBA’s worst record and
were without their two top scorers, ended a five-game losing
skid by beating Oklahoma City 101-99 on Bradley Beal’s basket
with three-tenths of a second left.  The Wizards improved to 5-28, with two of their wins coming
against the defending NBA-champion Miami Heat and the Thunder
(26-8), who had entered last night’s game with the league’s best
record.  To contact the reporter on this story:
