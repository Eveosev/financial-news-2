Two former employees of HBOS Plc
along with six others were charged by U.K. prosecutors over
business loans made through a retail bank for around 35 million
pounds ($56.2 million).  The pair, described as senior managers for the bank, were
charged today with conspiracy to corrupt, fraudulent trading and
money laundering, according to an e-mailed statement from the
Crown Prosecution Service. The men were given gifts by financial
advisers to administer loans for companies having difficulties
between 2003 and 2010.  The men, along with two employees of the financial advice
firm, are scheduled to appear at a Reading,  England , court on
Jan. 18.  HBOS was taken over by Lloydâ€™s Banking Group Plc in 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
