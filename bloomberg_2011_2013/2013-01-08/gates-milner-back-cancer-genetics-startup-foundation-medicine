Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)  co-founder Bill Gates
and Russian billionaire Yuri Milner invested in genetics startup
Foundation Medicine Inc., joining prior backers including Google
Ventures and Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers.  Gates and Milner helped Foundation raise an additional
$13.5 million in an expansion of its Series B financing,
bringing the total raised in the round to $56 million, the
Cambridge, Massachusetts-based company said today in a
statement. Evan Jones, co-founder of Digene Corp., participated
in the financing and will join Foundation’s board.  Foundation makes tools that can inspect DNA to determine
individuals’ risk of cancer and help doctors make treatment
decisions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
