Israeli Finance Ministry officials
are meeting bond investors in the U.S. to gauge appetite for the
country’s debt amid central bank calls to lower the budget
deficit.  “Non-deal road shows are taking place to enable access to
markets,” the ministry said in an e-mailed answer to questions
from Bloomberg News. The accountant general’s office is studying
a “foreign issuance as part of its yearly work plan,” the
ministry said.  Globes reported in December that  Israel  is seeking to raise
as much as $1.5 billion in foreign bonds in order to diversify
funding sources. Israel is rated A1 at Moody’s Investors
Service, the fifth highest investment grade. The cost of
insuring Israel’s debt against default for five years dropped 63
basis points, or 0.63 percentage point, last year to 135,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Bank of Israel Governor Stanley Fischer has been calling on
the government to rein in the budget deficit, which he said will
reach about 4.2 percent of economic output in 2012, more than
double the original plan. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
called for early elections, scheduled for Jan. 22, citing
opposition from partners in the coalition government to his
budget plan.  Israeli economic growth slowed to 3.3 percent in 2012, the
Central Bureau of Statistics said  Dec. 31, compared with 4.6
percent in the previous year and 5 percent in 2010.  To contact the reporters on this story:
