Istanbul, Tokyo and  Madrid  today
submitted their plans to host the 2020 Summer Olympics as the
finalists compete to stage sport’s biggest event and attract
millions of tourists to their cities.  Heads of the delegations handed in their bid books for the
International Olympic Committee to evaluate before members tour
proposed venues and make a final decision in Buenos Aires in
September.  Istanbul, which has failed in four bids, stressed a growing
economy and a young, sports-loving population as part of its $22
billion plan to bring the event to  Turkey  for the first time.
Madrid said it would use mainly existing facilities and spend
$1.9 billion as Spain tries to recover from an economic
battering.  Tokyo , host of the 1964 Olympics, promised innovation
and safety as pillars of a bid with $4.5 billion in place to
complete building projects.  The bids delivered to the IOC’s headquarters in Lausanne,
Switzerland, run to several hundred pages and outline how each
city will stage as many as 28 sports and accommodate athletes,
dignitaries and tourists from more than 200 countries. The plans
also describe the projected legacy of the event.  An evaluation commission will visit the cities in March,
starting with a three-day trip to Tokyo. They will then move to
Istanbul and Madrid, which lost out to Rio de Janeiro in the
final vote for the 2016 games. The cities will have a chance to
make a final pitch in July before the IOC announces the winner
following an anonymous poll of its membership on Sept. 7.  To contact the reporter on this story:
