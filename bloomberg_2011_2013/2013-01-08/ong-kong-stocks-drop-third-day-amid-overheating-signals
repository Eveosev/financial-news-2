Hong Kong   stocks  fell, with the
city’s benchmark index retreating for a third day from a 19-
month high, as developers and energy companies dropped amid
signs the market may be overbought.  China Resources Land Ltd. (1109)  sank 1.7 percent, the developer’s
first decline in two weeks. China Life Insurance Co. fell 1.8
percent after CCB International Holdings Ltd. cut its rating on
the nation’s largest insurer. Cnooc Ltd. slid a second day after
sending icebreakers to clear offshore oilfields amid the coldest
winter in decades. Zoomlion Heavy Industry Science & Technology
Co. was suspending after the Ming Pao newspaper cited an
anonymous letter questioning the crane maker’s accounting.  The Hang Seng Index sank 0.4 percent to 23,241.45 as of
9:55 a.m. in Hong Kong. The measure has retreated 0.9 percent in
the three days after reaching its highest level since June 2011.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index of mainland companies
declined 0.7 percent to 11,886.59.  The  Hang Seng Index (HSI) ’s 14-day Relative Strength Index, a
measure of trading momentum, was at 74 yesterday, above the 70-
level that some investors view as an indicator an asset is
overbought. The RSI is at 70 today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
