United Bank for Africa Plc , the
Nigerian lender whose shareholders last month approved a
restructuring plan, surged the most in more than six years after
its commercial banking business was listed on the local bourse.  The stock jumped 9.8 percent to 5.14 naira by the close in
in Lagos, Nigeria’s commercial capital, its biggest rise since
August 2006. The shares traded were about 59 percent of the
stock’s three-month daily average volume, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  The lender listed its commercial banking unit at 4.26 naira
per share yesterday, it said in an e-mailed statement. UBA
Capital, the non-commercial banking and capital market
businesses of UBA, will trade as a separate company from Jan.
11. Africa Prudential Registrars, which acquired UBA’S share-
registration business, will also begin trading on the same day.  The new structure will enable UBA to focus on its “core
competence,” Abiola Rasaq, a Lagos-based banking analyst at
Vetiva Capital Management Ltd., said by phone today. “The bank
has more competence in commercial banking so this new
arrangement will help it to remain focused.”  The Central Bank of Nigeria introduced regulation requiring
lenders to spin off non-banking units, or adopt holding company
structures to retain them, as part of its reforms after the
near-collapse of the industry from a debt crisis.  To contact the reporter on this story:
