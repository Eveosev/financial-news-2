Target Corp. (TGT) , the second-largest U.S.
discount retailer, plans to match the prices year-round charged
by the e-commerce sites of Amazon.com Inc.,  Wal-Mart Stores
Inc. (WMT) , Best Buy Co. and Toys “R” Us Inc. in a bid to boost
sales.  The new policy, which takes effect immediately, will
combine Target’s holiday-season price policies into one year-
round and easy-to-use system, the Minneapolis-based company said
in a statement. Target’s stores will also match the prices of
goods found on its own website, it said.  Target has seen stagnant sales growth as U.S. low-priced
retailers fight for market share among Americans hit by
stubbornly high unemployment and the tepid housing recovery.
Price-matching proliferates among the major U.S. retailers
especially during November and December, which accounts for a
large portion of their annual sales and profits.  Target dropped 1.1 percent $60.64 at the close in New York.
The Minneapolis-based company’s shares gained 16 percent last
year.  Target said it first started matching prices in 2009 and
began matching select online competitors for the first time this
past holiday season. The company’s revenue growth is projected
to rise 5 percent in the current year, compared with 4 percent
last year, according to the average analyst estimate in a
Bloomberg survey.  The retailer posted December same-store sales that were
little changed, compared with an estimate for a 1.3 percent
increase from Retail Metrics Inc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
