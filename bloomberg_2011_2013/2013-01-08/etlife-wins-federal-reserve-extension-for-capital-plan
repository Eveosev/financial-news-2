MetLife Inc. (MET) , the largest U.S. life
insurer, said the  Federal Reserve  agreed to extend a deadline to
submit a capital plan by about six months as the company works
to exit banking to limit regulatory oversight.  The plan is due by June 30, the New York-based company said
today in a regulatory filing. The insurer said in October that
the deadline had been extended to Jan. 5 from Sept. 30.  The Fed has blocked MetLife Chief Executive Officer  Steven Kandarian  from boosting the dividend or  repurchasing shares  as
regulators considered how the largest U.S. banks would fare in a
financial crisis. Kandarian, 60, received regulatory approval in
December for a sale of MetLife’s bank assets and has reached
deals to divest reverse-mortgage and home-loan units.  The insurer’s annual  dividend  has been 74 cents a share
since 2007 and the company last authorized a buyback in 2008.
The Fed last year rejected MetLife’s plans to repurchase $2
billion in shares and boost its dividend to $1.10 a share after
finding that it would fall short of U.S. capital standards in a
severe economic downturn.  To contact the reporter on this story:
