Russian stocks and the ruble soared
the most in almost four months, catching up with gains in global
markets in the country’s first day of trading this year.  The Micex Index climbed 2.7 percent to 1,514.82 by 6:45
p.m. in Moscow. The ruble appreciated more than 1 percent
against the central bank’s euro-dollar target basket to 34.4722
by the close of the main session of  stock trading . Today is the
first day of extended ruble trading to 11:50 p.m. Moscow time.
OAO Novolipetsk Steel increased 6.9 percent and OAO Mechel,
 Russia ’s biggest coking-coal producer, added 7.1 percent.  Global stocks rallied since U.S. lawmakers agreed to a deal
to avert automatic spending cuts and tax increases. Crude, the
nation’s biggest export earner, rose to $93.45 a barrel.  “We have to see that jump up for Russia because it has to
basically catch up with the other equity markets,” Ilya Kravets, who helps manage $100 million of assets at Daniloff
Capital LLC, including Russian stocks, said by phone in  New York 
yesterday.  The ruble strengthened 0.4 percent against the dollar to
30.2825 and jumped 1.6 percent versus the euro to 39.6235.
Russia’s dollar-denominated RTS Index added 3.2 percent to
1,576.10. The yield on the government’s ruble-denominated 2027
bond advanced seven basis points to 7.14 percent.  OAO Bashneft, a regional oil producer, jumped 6.5 percent
to the highest level since Oct. 9.  The Micex rose 5.2 percent last year and trades at about
5.6 times  estimated earnings , the lowest valuation among 21
emerging-market gauges tracked by Bloomberg. The MSCI  Emerging
Markets  Index, which has gained 1.3 percent this year, trades at
a multiple of 10.9 times estimated earnings.  The Bloomberg Russia-US Equity Index of the most-traded
 Russian (INDEXCF)  companies in the U.S. slipped 1 percent yesterday to
101.28, the biggest decline since Dec. 21. The Market Vectors
Russia ETF, the largest U.S.-traded exchange-traded fund that
holds Russian shares, decreased 1.4 percent to $30.14, the most
in two weeks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
