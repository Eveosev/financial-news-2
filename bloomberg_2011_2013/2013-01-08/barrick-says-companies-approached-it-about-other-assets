Barrick Gold Corp. (ABX) , which said today
it ended talks to sell its African mining unit, has received
approaches from companies interested in some of its other
assets.  While Barrick, the world’s largest gold producer, will
consider new approaches for its  African Barrick Gold Plc (ABG)  unit if
it gets them, the company won’t actively solicit third parties
for a sale of the business, Chief Executive Officer Jamie Sokalsky said in a telephone interview today.  “We are being approached by companies, other buyers,” he
said.  “If there are opportunities to divest assets that are
worth more to someone else than us, we will absolutely take a
look at that,” Sokalsky said. Barrick doesn’t “have anything
to talk about at the moment.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
