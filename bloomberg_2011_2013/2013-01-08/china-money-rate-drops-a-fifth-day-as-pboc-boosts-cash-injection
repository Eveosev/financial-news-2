China ’s money-market rate declined to
a three-week low as the central bank injected cash into the
financial system through reverse-repurchase agreements.  The People’s Bank of China offered 20 billion  yuan  ($3.2
billion) of seven-day reverse repurchase contracts at a yield of
3.35 percent today and 18 billion yuan of 28-day agreements at
3.6 percent, according to a statement on its website. The
authority added 90 billion yuan through a similar auction at 3.3
percent on Jan. 5.  “There could be strong cash demand for corporate trade
settlement and also bonus payments for the Lunar New Year,”
said Jackit Wong, a regional ecoonmist in  Hong Kong  at Natixis
Asia Ltd. “I see some room for monetary easing this year to
lower financing costs and support economic growth.”  The seven-day  repurchase rate , which measures interbank
funding availability, dropped two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 3.15 percent as of 10:47 a.m. in  Shanghai ,
according to a weighted average compiled by the National
Interbank Funding Center.  The five-day drop, totaling 143 basis points, is the
longest easing stretch since July 12. Economists forecast the
PBOC will lower banks’ reserve-requirement ratio by 50 basis
points in the first-half of this year, according to the median
forecast in a Bloomberg News survey published on Dec. 19.  The one-year interest-rate swap, the fixed cost needed to
receive the floating seven-day repo rate, was unchanged at 3.39
percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It fell five
basis points yesterday.  The yield on the 2.95 percent government bonds due August
2017 was little changed at 3.19 percent, according to the
Interbank Funding Center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
