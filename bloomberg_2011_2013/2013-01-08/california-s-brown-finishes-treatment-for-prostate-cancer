California Governor  Jerry Brown  said
he has completed radiation treatment for prostate cancer, a
month after his office announced his illness.  “I’m ready and I’m raring to go,” the 74-year-old
Democrat told reporters today in Sacramento, the capital.
“Don’t expect me to leave too soon.”  Brown’s oncologist said in a Dec. 12 statement that the
governor had been diagnosed with early-stage, localized prostate
cancer, one of the most common forms of the disease affecting
men. Local stage means that there is no sign that the cancer has
spread outside of the prostate, according to the  American Cancer
Society ’s website. The gland is part of the male reproductive
system.  Brown had surgery last year to remove a basal cell
carcinoma from the right side of his nose. The procedure was
performed as an outpatient with local anesthetic and required
some reconstructive surgery, his office said at the time.  Among prostate-cancer survivors are  Warren Buffett , the
billionaire chairman of  Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A) , Rudolph Giuliani, the former  New York  City mayor, and Andy Grove, former
chief executive officer of the world’s largest computer
chipmaker,  Intel Corp. (INTC)   To contact the reporter on this story:
