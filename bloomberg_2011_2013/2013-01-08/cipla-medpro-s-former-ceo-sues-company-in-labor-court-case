Cipla Medpro South Africa Ltd. (CMP) , the
country’s third-largest drugmaker, said it is opposing a lawsuit
from former Chief Executive Officer Jerome Smith which alleges
his employment contract was ended unlawfully.  Smith claims about 18 million rand ($2.1 million) for the
repudiation of his fixed-term contract and more than 11 million
rand for unpaid bonuses, the company said in a regulatory filing
after the close of the Johannesburg Stock Exchange.  Cipla “will oppose the proceedings” in the Labour Court,
the company said.  Smith, who was CEO of the Johannesburg-based company for
almost five years, resigned on Oct. 8 before the start of a
disciplinary meeting into more than 20 charges, including gross
misconduct. The Takeover Regulation Panel probed the company
after shareholders, including Smith, lodged a complaint. The
regulator dropped its investigation, Cipla said today.  The company’s stock has risen 26 percent since Smith’s
resignation and closed at  9 rand  in Johannesburg. The four-
company FTSE/JSE Africa Pharmaceuticals and Biotechnology Index
advanced  17 percent  over the same period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
