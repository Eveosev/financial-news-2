Colombia ’s peso bond yields fell to a
record low after inflation slowed more than analysts forecast in
December, fueling speculation that policy makers will further
reduce borrowing costs to buoy economic growth.  The yield on the government’s 10 percent peso-denominated
debt due 2024 plunged 10 basis points, or 0.1 percentage point,
to 5.59 percent, according to the central bank. That’s the
lowest level since the securities were first issued in 2009. The
price rose 0.953 centavo to 136.74 centavos per peso. Colombian
markets were closed yesterday for a holiday.  Consumer prices rose 0.09 percent in December from a month
earlier, the national statistics agency said Jan. 5, less than
the 0.26 percent median estimate of 23 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg. Annual inflation slowed to 2.44 percent, below the
central bank’s 3 percent mid-point of policy makers’ target.  “Low inflation increases policy flexibility,” Felipe Hernandez, a  Stamford , Connecticut-based economist at Royal Bank
of Scotland Group Plc, wrote in a note to clients today. He
predicts Banco de la Republica will cut the  overnight lending
rate  a quarter percentage point to 4 percent this month and sees
“a high probability for at least one more cut” of 25 basis
points later this year.  Central bank minutes released Jan. 4 indicated the board
was split three ways when it surprised analysts by lowering the
benchmark  interest rate  by 25 basis points on Dec. 21 to 4.25
percent. More than one policy maker voted for a 50 basis point
cut and one opted for no change.  Peso Performance  The peso was little changed at 1,771.20 per  U.S. dollar .
The currency touched 1,750.50 on Jan. 2, the strongest intraday
level since July 2011.  That same day central bank Governor Jose Dario Uribe said
on RCN Radio that the strength of the peso is a concern and
reiterated Banco de la Republica will buy a minimum of $20
million a day through at least the first quarter. The central
bank printed pesos to buy a record $4.4 billion last year.  The economy grew 2.1 percent in the third quarter from a
year earlier, less than half the 4.9 percent rate in the prior
three months, the government reported Dec. 20. That was weaker
than all 28 forecasts compiled by Bloomberg. Uribe has said the
economy likely grew less than 4 percent in 2012 after expanding
5.9 percent in 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
