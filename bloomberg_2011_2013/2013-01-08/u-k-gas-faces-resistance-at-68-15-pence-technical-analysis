U.K. next-month natural gas must
break through an area of resistance at 68.15 pence a therm
before pushing higher, Futurestechs.com Ltd. said, citing
technical indicators.  The  level  was created by the 38.2 percent retracement of
the rally from October to December, Clive Lambert, a technical
strategist at Futurestechs in Billericay,  England , wrote in an
e-mailed research report today. The levels are derived from
Fibonacci numbers that some analysts believe hold clues to
market movements.  The  month-ahead  contract jumped 2.5 percent yesterday to
68.5 pence a therm, after reaching 68.75 pence, the most since
Dec. 7, according to broker data compiled by Bloomberg. It fell
1.4 percent to 67.55 pence a therm at 9:38 a.m. London time.  “Given the extremity of the gap higher perhaps a minor
period of consolidation is necessary and a test of the bulls’
willingness to buy dips needs to be seen before pushing ahead,”
Lambert wrote in the note.  To contact the reporter on this story:
