 A measure of investor protection on
U.S. and Canadian high-yield debt rose from the lowest level
since 2011 as so-called lite-covenant issuance diminished,
according to a new index from Moody’s Investors Service.  The average covenant score, in which 1 is the highest and 5
the weakest, improved to 3.84 in December from 3.9 in November,
according to Moody’s Covenant Quality Index, which debuted
today. That’s the first advance since June and up from the
weakest level since November 2011, Moody’s said.  “The decline of covenant quality began in July as issuance
rose,” analysts led by Alexander Dill wrote in a report today.
Covenants are rules that borrowers agree to follow over the life
of a debt issue.  Companies worldwide sold a record $3.95 trillion of debt
last year as the Federal Reserve forces investors to take on
riskier corporate debt for higher returns by holding short-term
U.S. interest rates near  record lows  to spur economic growth.
Investor protections were weaker last year than in 2011, Moody’s
said.  Bond issuance was “dominated” last month by pay-in-kind
notes, securities that allow issuers to repay holders with debt
instead of cash, Moody’s said. Those sales were offset by bonds
that had “moderate” quality, or securities with an index score
between 2.6 and 3.4.  Debt with lite-covenant packages, which lacks protection
against further debt incurrence or fails to restrict issuer
spending, earn the weakest possible score from Moody’s.  To contact the reporter on this story:
