Rubber traded near an eight-month
high on optimism that  China , the biggest buyer, will increase
inventories ahead of holidays and as crude oil climbed.  Rubber for delivery in June gained as much as 0.9 percent
to 306.4 yen a kilogram ($3,497 a metric ton) on the  Tokyo 
Commodity Exchange before trading little changed at 304 yen at
12:46 p.m. The contract rose to 313.7 yen yesterday, the highest
level since May 7.  Oil traded near a four-month high in New York before a
government report that may show refinery utilization rose and
stockpiles increased in the U.S. Natural-rubber inventories
gained 1,770 tons to 97,697 tons, the highest since March 2010,
the Shanghai Futures Exchange said on Jan. 4.  “Rising crude oil prices are supportive,” Chaiwat Muenmee,
an analyst at DS Futures Co., said by phone from Bangkok.
Optimism that China will build up stocks ahead of Chinese New
Year also gave a boost, he added.  The upside was limited after the Japanese currency headed
for the biggest two-day gain in five weeks, extending a rally
from its 2 1/2 year low, reducing an appeal of yen-denominated
contracts, said Naohiro Niimura, a partner at research company
Market Risk Advisory in Tokyo.  Rubber for delivery in May gained 0.2 percent to 26,135
 yuan  ($4,198) a ton on the Shanghai Futures Exchange. Thai
rubber free-on-board added 0.2 percent to 102.35 baht ($3.36) a
kilogram yesterday, according to the Rubber Research Institute
of  Thailand .  To contact the reporter on this story:
