Income disparities and government
budget deficits present the most likely risks to the global
economy in the next decade, according to the  World Economic
Forum .  Such threats leave the world more at risk as the financial
crisis persists, the Geneva-based group said today. The report,
presented today at Bloomberg’s London headquarters, was based on
a survey of 1,000 experts and industry leaders. Income and
budget imbalances were cited as the key threats in the same
survey a year ago.  “These global risks are essentially a health warning
regarding our most critical systems,” said Lee Howell, the
report’s editor and a managing director of the WEF. “National
resilience to global risks needs to be a priority so that
critical systems continue to function despite a major
disturbance.”  Rising greenhouse gas emissions were named the third most
likely global risk following a year assailed with weather shocks
such as superstorm Sandy.  The report, published two weeks before the forum’s annual
meeting in the Swiss resort of Davos, also suggested advances in
health care have led to complacency about medical risks. Another
threat is the unpredictability of technology in shaping
societies.  Among potential game-changers, or what the report calls
“X-Factors,” are runaway  climate change , the cost of living
longer or discovery of alien life.  To contact the reporter on this story:
