Vietnam’s  stocks  advanced the most
among Asia’s largest equity markets on speculation the
government will take steps to help companies cope with inflation
and a slowing economy.  The  VN Index (VNINDEX)  rose 1.8 percent to 441.83 as of 11:46 a.m. in
Ho Chi Minh City, heading for the highest close since May 22,
2012.  Bao Viet Holdings (BVH) , the biggest Vietnamese insurer, rallied
4.9 percent to 48,900 dong.  Masan Group Corp. (MSN)  jumped 4.8 percent
to 110,000 dong.  Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung requested ministries and
provinces to keep prices of essential goods and fuel stable
ahead of the Lunar New Year holiday in an attempt to rein in
inflation, according to a Jan. 7  statement  on the Finance
Ministry’s website. The government will take measures to address
economic challenges in 2013, Dung said Jan. 1.  Confidence is “being supported by fundamental positive
news such as recent government talks on measures to boost
companies this year,” Le Thi Hai Duong, brokerage manager at
Hanoi-based BIDV Securities Co., said by phone today. “Most
investors chose to buy stocks as it’s more profitable than
putting their money in banks or gold these days.”  Vietnam ’s inflation rate slowed for the first time in four
months in December, with  consumer prices  rising 6.81 percent
from a year earlier after climbing 7.08 percent in November. The
World Bank said on Dec. 5 that core inflation is “still very
high.”  Gross domestic product rose 5.03 percent last year, down
from 5.89 percent in 2011 and the least since 1999, the General
Statistics Office said in Hanoi Dec. 25.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
