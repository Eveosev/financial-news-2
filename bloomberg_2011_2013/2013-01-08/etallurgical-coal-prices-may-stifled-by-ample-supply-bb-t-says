Global metallurgical coal prices this
year may be stifled by ample supply and weak demand, BB&T
Capital Markets analysts said.  China ’s appetite for coal may be sparse before the
country’s New Year’s Holiday in February, BB&T analysts Mark Levin and Garrett Nelson wrote in a note to clients. The first-
quarter benchmark price for the fuel fell to $165 a metric ton,
the lowest level since pacts shifted to quarterly from annual
settlements in the first quarter of 2010.  “After the Chinese holiday, it’s anybody’s guess what the
world’s largest consumer does,” Levin and Nelson said in the
report. “With plenty of supply available from Australia, the
U.S., Mongolia, and now  Mozambique  to meet anemic demand, we
don’t foresee a big near-term rebound.”  Metallurgical  coal , used to make steel, is down 50 percent
from the record $330 a metric ton set in the second quarter of
2011 after floods in Queensland,  Australia , curtailed
production, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
