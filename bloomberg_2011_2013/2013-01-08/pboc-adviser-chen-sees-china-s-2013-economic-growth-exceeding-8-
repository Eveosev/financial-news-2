China ’s economic growth is likely to
exceed 8 percent this year, with inflation becoming a potential
concern in the second half, a central bank academic adviser said.  New yuan  lending  above 9 trillion yuan ($1.4 trillion) for
the year will be “enough to support” that level of growth, and
monetary policy makers may become more cautious in the second
half, Chen Yulu, president of Renmin University of China, said
today in Beijing in brief comments after an event with  France ’s
finance minister.  Chen’s forecast compares with median analyst projections
for 8.1 percent growth in 2013 after 7.7 percent expansion in
2012, which would mark the slowest pace since 1999. UBS AG
estimates new local-currency loans totaled about 8.3 trillion
 yuan  last year.  Inflation won’t be an issue in the first half of the year,
said Chen, who is also a finance professor at Renmin. He has
been an adviser to the People’s Bank of China since March.  --Zhou Xin. With assistance from Kevin Hamlin in Beijing.
