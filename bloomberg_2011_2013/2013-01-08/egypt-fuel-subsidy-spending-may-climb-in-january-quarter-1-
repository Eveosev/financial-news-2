The Egyptian government’s fuel
subsidies may climb to as much as 30.9 billion Egyptian pounds
($4.79 billion) in the three months beginning Jan. 1, state-run
Egyptian General Petroleum Corp. Chairman Hani Dahi said.  The North African country spent 30 billion pounds on the
subsidies in each of the previous quarters of the fiscal year
that started on July 1, 2012, Dahi said by phone from Cairo.  Egypt , with the Middle East’s biggest budget deficit, is
struggling to cap public expenditure, 20 percent of which went
to energy subsidies in the last fiscal year. The nation is
waiting to finalize an agreement with the International Monetary
Fund for $4.8 billion as its currency weakened against the
dollar and its foreign reserves plunged.  “Spending on fuel subsidies in the third quarter will rise
between 2 to 3 percent,” Dahi said. The government company,
known as EGPC, owes foreign partners $4.5 billion, $1.8 billion
of which it has agreed to pay back in instalments, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
