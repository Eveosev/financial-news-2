Arab media reacted negatively to  Mitt Romney 's trip abroad. "If his performance was any indicator of what he will bring in the event he wins the presidency, we have seen and heard enough to know that he will fail miserably," Octavia Nasr  wrote  Tuesday in leading Lebanese daily Annahar. In her column, entitled "Mitt Romney's Failed Attempt at Foreign Diplomacy," Nasr wrote that Romney's trip was in part an attempt to appeal to Jewish voters in swing states like  Florida , noting that Romney and Israeli Prime Minister  Benjamin Netanyahu  are friends and former colleagues. "It was natural for Romney to plan to visit  Israel  to improve his chances with Jewish-Americans and evangelicals." On his seven-day trip, which concluded Tuesday, Romney met with leaders in  Great Britain , Israel and  Poland .  Nasr portrayed the visits as a series of gaffes: In the pan-Arab daily newspaper Al-Hayat, columnist Elias Harfouche  wrote  Tuesday that Romney revealed a lack of understanding of the Israel-Palestine conflict and its history in citing cultural differences as the reason Israelis are more economically successful than Palestinians: In a speech in  Jerusalem  on Sunday, Romney referred to the city as Israel's capital. (The U.S. does not recognize it as such, considering Jerusalem’s final status as subject to negotiations.) His remark sparked the ire of Palestinian journalist Yasser Zaatreh, who expanded the circle of blame. "We feel disgusted by you and by your country and by your opponent too," Zaatreh  tweeted  Monday.
