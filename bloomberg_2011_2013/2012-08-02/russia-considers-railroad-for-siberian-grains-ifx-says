Russia may build rail links to
transport grain cargoes to the countryâ€™s eastern ports, Interfax
said, citing Deputy Agriculture Minister Alexander Chernogorov.  The agriculture ministry discussed with OAO Russian
Railways, the state rail monopoly, the idea of building links
from the Siberian grain-growing areas to the Far Eastern ports,
including Zarubino in the Primorye region, and financing
possibilities, Interfax cited Chernogorov as saying today at a
conference in the Siberian city of Novosibirsk.  To contact the reporter on this story:
