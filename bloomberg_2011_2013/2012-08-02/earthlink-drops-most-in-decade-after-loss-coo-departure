EarthLink Inc. (ELNK) , an  Internet service
provider , fell the most in a decade after the company reported a
second-quarter loss and said Chief Operating Officer Joseph Wetzel is leaving.  The shares dropped 10 percent to $6.09 at the close in New
York, the biggest one-day decline since August 2002. Through
yesterday, the stock had increased 5.6 percent this year.  Revenue sank 7 percent to $338.2 million in the second
quarter from $363.6 million in the same period a year earlier,
as sales to business customers declined, the Atlanta-based
company said today in a statement. The net loss was $1.11
million, or 1 cent a share, compared with income of $6.55
million, or 6 cents, a year earlier.  Analysts on average had estimated the company would report
net income of 3 cents a share on sales of $339 million,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg  Wetzel will depart on Dec. 31, the company said. EarthLink
didnâ€™t name a replacement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
