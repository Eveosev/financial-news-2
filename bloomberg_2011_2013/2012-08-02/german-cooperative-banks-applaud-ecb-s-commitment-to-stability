German cooperative banks welcomed the
 European Central Bank ’s “clear commitment” to stabilize the
euro area and its announcement today to work on more non-
standard monetary policy measures.  “The ECB should not limit itself to developing special
monetary policy tools,” Andreas Martin, a member of the board
of the BVR banking association, said today in a statement. “It
has to create long-term transparency of its stabilization
strategy.”  Martin urged policy makers to incorporate the temporary
European rescue fund, the European Financial Stability Facility,
as soon as possible in measures to stabilize bond markets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
