Vietnam ’s five-year bonds rose for a
fourth day, pushing the yield to the lowest level in almost four
weeks, as falling interbank lending rates boosted demand. The
dong was unchanged.  The  overnight interbank deposit rate  touched a seven-week
low of 1.47 percent on July 31 and has fallen more than 10
percentage points this year, according to data from banks
compiled by Bloomberg. High levels of cash in the banking system
have pushed down the rate, according to a July 23 research note
from Bank for Investment & Development of Vietnam.  “It’s more profitable for banks to invest in bonds than to
lend in the  interbank market ,” said Hoang Thanh Tam, head of
the fixed-income department at Vietnam Maritime Commercial
Joint-Stock Bank in Hanoi. “The overnight rates are at levels
much lower than bond yields.”  The five-year  yield  declined two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 9.75 percent, the lowest level since July 6,
according to a daily fixing rate from banks compiled by
Bloomberg.  The dong traded at 20,865 per dollar as of 3:08 p.m. in
Hanoi, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The central bank
set its  reference rate  at 20,828, unchanged since Dec. 26,
according to its website. The currency is allowed to trade as
much as 1 percent on either side of the fixing.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
