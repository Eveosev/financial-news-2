Arcam AB (ARCM) , a Swedish maker of
manufacturing technology, rose to its highest level in more than
four years after a new order lifted the company’s systems sales
to last year’s level and closer to its 2012 target.  The shares rose as much as 7.2 percent to 74.75 kronor, the
highest intraday price since May 9, 2008, after the company won
an order for its system from Lima Corporate SpA in  Italy . The
stock was up 5.4 percent to 73.5 kronor as of 2:30 p.m. in
Stockholm. Prosthesis-maker Lima already has seven machines from
Arcam installed.  The order for a so-called A1 system brings total sales this
year to the equivalent of 14 machines, which was what Arcam sold
last year, the company’s Chief Executive Officer Magnus Rene
said today by phone. The order book includes components sales at
a value of two systems. “We are in a situation where we know,
in principle, that sales are on the same level as last year,”
Rene said. “That is, of course, a good place to be.”  The maker of electron-beam melting technology, which builds
parts layer-by-layer by melting metal power, said on July 20 it
targets increased sales as well as improved profitability this
year compared with 2011.  Molndal, Sweden-based Arcam was the second-biggest gainer
in the  OMX Stockholm All-Share index , which was little changed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
