Italian bonds rose for a second day
after Prime Minister  Mario Monti  said the region’s permanent
rescue fund will gain access to central bank liquidity, adding
to optimism leaders are addressing the euro debt crisis.  German 10-year bund yields were six basis points from a
three-week high before the  European Central Bank  announces its
policy decision amid speculation it will introduce new measure
to support Spanish and Italian bonds. Spain’s 10-year bonds rose
as the nation auctioned 3.1 billion euros ($3.8 billion) of
securities maturing from 2014 to 2022. Two-year German notes
held losses from yesterday.  “Monti’s comments contribute to the general climate of
positivity in the market, which is supportive for Italian
debt,” said  Luca Cazzulani , a senior fixed-income strategist at
 UniCredit SpA (UCG)  in Milan. “Those investors expecting a big
announcement today will probably be disappointed but the threat
is still out there so they will probably be cautious about
shorting Spanish and Italian bonds.”  The Italian 10-year yield fell 11 basis points, or 0.11
percentage point, to 5.82 percent at 10:29 a.m. London time. The
5.5 percent bond due September 2022 rose 0.82, or 8.20 euros per
1,000-euro face amount, to 98.21.  Monti said the European Stability Mechanism would gain
access to ECB funds via a bank license.  License ‘Help’  “I think this would help, I think this will in due course
occur,” the premier said at a news conference in Helsinki
yesterday. Monti’s assertion was a rebuff to Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s Cabinet, hours after ministers meeting in Berlin
hardened their opposition to granting the planned bailout fund
access to central-bank resources.  The German 10-year yield was little changed at 1.37 percent
after rising to 1.43 percent on July 30, the highest level since
July 5. The two-year note yield was also little changed, at
minus 0.08 percent. A negative rate means investors who hold the
debt to maturity will receive less than they paid to buy them.  Spanish 10-year yields slipped eight basis points to 6.65
percent. They have declined from record highs since ECB
President  Mario Draghi  last week promised to “do whatever it
takes” to defend the common currency.  Spain  sold 3.13 billion euros of bonds, the Bank of Spain
said, compared with a maximum target of 3 billion euros.  The Treasury in  Madrid  sold its 10-year benchmark bond at
an average yield of 6.647 percent, compared with 6.43 percent
when it was last auctioned on July 5. Notes maturing in October
2016 had an average yield of 5.971 percent, compared with 5.536
percent last month and July 2014 securities yielded 4.774
percent.  German 10-year bund yields dropped seven basis points to
1.38 percent when the ECB cut its  benchmark rate  to a record-low
0.75 percent at its previous policy meeting on July 5.  German debt has returned 3.6 percent this year through
yesterday, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the
European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. Spanish
securities lost 4.7 percent, while Italy’s debt rose 8.1
percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
