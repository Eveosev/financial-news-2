Apache Corp. (APA) , the third-largest U.S.
independent oil and natural-gas producer by market value, fell
the most in more than seven months after quarterly profit
trailed analysts’ estimates.  Apache, based in Houston, dropped 4.9 percent to $82.58 at
the close in  New York , the biggest decline since Dec. 14.  Net income declined 72 percent to $356 million, or 86 cents
a share, from $1.26 billion, or $3.17, a year earlier, the
company said in a statement today. Excluding one-time items such
as reducing the value of Canadian properties on low gas prices,
profit was $2.07 a share, 46 cents less than the average of 27
analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Apache said it got an average of $97.66 a barrel for oil in
the second quarter, an 8.1 percent drop from a year earlier. The
company’s realized gas price in  North America  fell 35 percent
from a year earlier to $3.17 per thousand cubic feet. At the
same time, unscheduled maintenance on production projects
reduced output by the equivalent of about 16,000 barrels of oil
a day in the quarter.  “Production was lower than expected” in the quarter,  Leo Mariani , an analyst at  RBC Capital Markets  in Austin, Texas,
said in an e-mail today. He has a sector perform rating on
Apache shares and doesn’t own any.  Expectations for the company rose after the company’s
meeting with analysts in June, said Eliot Javanmardi, an analyst
at Capital One Southcoast in  New Orleans .  Bad Memories  Apache’s production has been affected by maintenance in the
past, and today’s report is “bringing back some of the bad
feelings” related to output, Javanmardi said in a telephone
interview. Javanmardi doesn’t own Apache shares and rates them
as an add, meaning the stock may perform better than peers.  The company said output was the equivalent of 774,486
barrels of oil a day in the second quarter, a 3.5 percent
increase from a year earlier. Capital One’s Javanmardi said he
was looking for about 800,000 barrels a day. In the first
quarter of this year, Apache’s output was more than 769,000
barrels a day.  The company also reported an average realized natural-gas
liquids price of less than $34 a barrel in the second quarter,
while Javanmardi said he expected it to be about $38.  Apache said it expects to meet a global production growth
forecast of 6 percent to 9 percent in 2012 compared with last
year, excluding some assets sold in 2011.  ConocoPhillips (COP)  and  Anadarko Petroleum Corp. (APC)  are the largest
U.S. independent oil and gas producers by market value.
