Rebecca Soni of the U.S. won the
women’s 200-meter breaststroke gold medal at the London Olympics
in a world-record time.  Soni finished in 2 minutes, 19:59, ahead of  Japan ’s Satomi
Suzuki in second place and Russia’s Iuliia Efimova in third.  Tyler Clary overtook U.S. teammate  Ryan Lochte  to win the
200-meter backstroke and set an Olympic record.  Lochte, a double gold medalist at the London Games, led the
race for the first 150 meters before being reeled in by Clary
and Japan’s Ryosuke Irie.  Clary touched in 1:53.41 at the
Aquatics Center.  Lochte finished in 1:53.94 seconds behind Irie’s 1:53.78
seconds.  Lochte finished first in the 400-meter individual medley
and was part of the 800-meter relay team that won gold. He’s
also taking on  Michael Phelps  in the 200-meter medley this
evening.  Soni, who improved her own world mark of 2:20.0 set
yesterday, is the first female Olympic champion from Beijing
four years ago to successfully defend her title in  London .  To contact the reporter on this story:
