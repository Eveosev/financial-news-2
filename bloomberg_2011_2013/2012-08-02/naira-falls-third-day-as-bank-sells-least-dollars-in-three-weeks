The naira fell for a third day
against the dollar on the Nigerian  interbank market  after the
central bank sold the lowest amount of U.S. currency in three
weeks.  The currency of  Africa ’s biggest oil producer retreated 0.4
percent to 161.43 a dollar as of 12:11 p.m. in Lagos, the
commercial capital, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The  Central Bank of Nigeria   sold $450 million  at its
foreign exchange auctions on Monday and Wednesday, the least
since it sold a total of $343.53 million on July 9 and July 11.
The Abuja-based regulator uses the auctions to stabilize the
naira.  If the central bank “is not going to sell more than that
it means you’ll have to go somewhere else,” Jide Solanke, a
Lagos-based analyst at First Securities Discount House Ltd.,
said by phone today.  The yield on  Nigeria ’s seven-year domestic bonds due June
2019 fell five basis points to 16.06 percent, according to Aug.
1 data on the Financial Markets Dealers Association website.
Yields on the nation’s $500 million of Eurobonds due 2021 rose 2
basis points to 5.35 percent today.  Ghana’s cedi slid 0.2 percent to 1.9575 per dollar in
Accra, the capital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
