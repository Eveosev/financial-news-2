The pound advanced against the dollar
and pared its decline against the euro after the  Bank of England 
left its key  interest rate  and its asset purchase target
unchanged.   Britainâ€™s currency was 0.2 percent stronger at $1.5568 at
12:02 p.m. London time. It was 0.2 percent weaker at 78.86 pence
per euro, after weakening as much as 0.5 percent earlier.   The U.K. central bank held its asset purchase target at 375
billion pounds ($583 billion) and left the benchmark rate at 0.5
percent, it said today in London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
