Absa Group Ltd. (ASA)  and its parent
company,  Barclays Plc (BARC) , have started joint life insurance
operations in Zambia, using the U.K. bank’s existing operations
in the southern African country.  Called Barclays Life, the unit will offer credit life
protection on loans, hospital cash plans and funeral cover,
Johannesburg-based Absa said in an e-mailed statement today.
Victor Munalula will be the life company’s managing director,
Absa said, adding that he has “held numerous senior and
executive roles within the Zambian insurance industry.”  Barclays bought control of South Africa’s Absa in 2005.
Outside of its domestic market, Absa has a presence in Tanzania,
Botswana and Mozambique, while Barclays has operations in 12
African countries.  To contact the reporter on this story:
