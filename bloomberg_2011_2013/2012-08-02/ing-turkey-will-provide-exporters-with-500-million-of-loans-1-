ING Groep NV (INGA) ’s Turkish banking unit
signed an agreement with the Istanbul-based textile and ready-
wear exporters association to provide $500 million of loans to
more than 9,000 of the group’s members.  ING Turkey will also provide consulting services for member
companies of the Istanbul Textile and Apparel Exporters
Association for their investments abroad and to help with their
trade with foreign firms, it said in a statement today.  “We are ambitious in terms of supporting exports,” said
Pinar Abay, chief executive officer of ING Turkey. “We want to
be the Turkish bank providing the most support for companies
involved in foreign trade.”  ING Turkey expects 30 percent growth in loans for small and
medium-size businesses and commercial banking in 2012, while 55
percent of that will come from lending to exporters, Abay said.  ING Bank  Turkey  also plans to triple profit this year, Abay
told Bloomberg Television in Istanbul today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
