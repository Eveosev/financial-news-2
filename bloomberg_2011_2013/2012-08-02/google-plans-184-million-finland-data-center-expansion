Google Inc. (GOOG) , owner of the world’s
most-popular search engine, plans to spend 150 million euros
($184 million) to expand its data center in Finland as demand
rises for online access to video and data.  The construction work to expand the facility in Hamina,
about 150 kilometers (93 miles) east of Helsinki, will last
about 18 months, Google said today in a statement distributed at
a media event at the site.  Google, based in Mountain View, California, needs more
capacity as demand increases for data-intensive services such as
its YouTube video website and Gmail. In April, the company said
it will spend more than $300 million building its largest Asian
data center in Taiwan, after announcing smaller centers in  Hong
Kong  and  Singapore  in September.  In 2009, Google said it planned to invest an initial 160
million euros to set up the Hamina facility in a former
newsprint mill -- Google’s first conversion of an existing
building into a  data center . The company paid 40 million euros
for the coastal paper mill, part of which was designed by
Finnish architect Alvar Aalto.  To contact the reporter on this story:
