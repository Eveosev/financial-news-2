An estimate of future average
overnight borrowing costs in euros rose from a record low in the
first increase in six days, a money-market indicator shows.  The three-month Eonia OIS swap rose to 5.5 basis points at
8:35 a.m. in  London  from 5.2 yesterday, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The European Banking Federation’s euro
overnight indexed average, or Eonia, of unsecured lending deals
was set at 11.2 basis points yesterday from 11.1 the day before.  The cost for European banks to borrow in dollars fell. The
three-month cross-currency  basis swap , the rate banks pay to
convert euro interest payments into the U.S. currency, was 42.5
basis points below the euro interbank offered rate, or Euribor,
from minus 44 yesterday.  The one-year basis swap was 44 basis points, or 0.44
percentage point, below Euribor from minus 43. Euribor is the
rate  banks  say they see each other lending in euros, according
to the same panel of banks that contribute to Eonia.  Banks cut  overnight deposits  at the Frankfurt-based
 European Central Bank  to 328 billion euros ($402 billion)
yesterday from 337 billion euros the day before.  Three-month Euribor fell to a record 0.381 percent
yesterday from 0.389 the previous day.  The London interbank offered rate, or Libor, for three-
month dollar loans declined to 0.442 percent yesterday from
0.443 percent, the lowest since Nov. 7. Libor is published by
the British Bankers’ Association.  To contact the reporter on this story:
