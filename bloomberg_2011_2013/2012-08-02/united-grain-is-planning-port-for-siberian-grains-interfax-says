United Grain Co. and a company
belonging to Summa Group,  Russia ’s largest port operator, want
to build a grains terminal at the Zarubino port in the eastern
part of the country, Interfax said, citing Dmitry Grant, adviser
to United Grain’s chief executive officer.  The terminal in Primorsky would have capacity of 10 million
metric tons and cost an estimated 7 billion rubles ($216
million), Grant said, according to Interfax. It’s designed to
handle 2 million tons of agriculture imports and 8 million tons
of exports a year, all from Siberia, according to the report. It
may be started in 2015 and be at full capacity by 2017, Interfax
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
