Japan  will combine two emission
credit programs as the government seeks to improve efficiency in
the country’s efforts to curb production of greenhouse gases.  “It’s important for Japan to keep promoting measures to
cut and absorb emissions,” a study group set up this year to
review the country’s incentives said today in a  report . “We
need to keep the credit programs for fiscal 2013 and after.”  The industry, environment and agriculture ministries began
a program in 2008 to spur low-carbon energy investment by small-
and medium-size businesses by offering larger companies credits
in return for providing their smaller peers with financial and
technical help.  The same year the Japan-Verified emission cutting program,
or J-VER, was begun by the environment ministry to certify cuts
in greenhouse gas from local projects as eligible for credits.  Both were to continue through fiscal 2012, the end of the
Kyoto Protocol’s first commitment period. Japan and  Russia  say
they won’t accept emissions targets after the 2008-2012 period.
The treaty sets reduction targets for developed nations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
