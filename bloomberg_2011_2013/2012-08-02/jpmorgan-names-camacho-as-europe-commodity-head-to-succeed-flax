JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  named Michael Camacho as chief executive officer of its commodities activities
in Europe, the  Middle East  and Africa to succeed Catherine Flax,
who will become chief marketing officer.  Camacho will also retain his duties as global head of
metals, reporting to worldwide commodities chief Blythe Masters,
spokesman Patrick Burton in London said today by phone. Camacho
will relocate to London from New York, according to Burton.  Flax, who has headed the EMEA commodities unit since
January 2010, will move to New York and report to Mary Erdoes,
chief executive officer of the asset-management unit, the
spokesman said.  Camacho was head of global structured commodities before
becoming metals chief this year to succeed  Peter Sellars , who
retired. Flax joined JPMorgan, the largest U.S. bank by assets,
in 2005 from UBS AG.  To contact the reporter on this story:
