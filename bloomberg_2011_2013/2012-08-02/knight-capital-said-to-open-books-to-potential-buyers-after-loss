Knight Capital Group Inc. (KCG)  opened its
books today to potential buyers, including private-equity firms
and at least one securities-industry rival, as it seeks an
investment or takeover to survive after a $440 million trading
loss, said two people with knowledge of the matter.  Knight hired Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Sandler O’Neill &
Partners LP for advice in the rescue talks, said one of the
people, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the talks
are private. The New York-based high speed trading firm is under
pressure to strike a deal within days, the people said.  A representative for Goldman Sachs declined to comment.
Spokespeople for Sandler O’Neill and Knight didn’t immediately
return calls seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
