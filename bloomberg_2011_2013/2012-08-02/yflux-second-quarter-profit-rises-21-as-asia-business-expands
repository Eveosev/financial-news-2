published on Aug. 2.)  Hyflux Ltd. (HYF) , Singapore’s biggest
water-treatment company, said profit rose 21 percent in the
second quarter from a year earlier as business expanded in Asia.  Net income was S$17.5 million ($14 million) in the three
months ended in June, from S$14.5 million, the company said in a
statement to the Singapore Stock Exchange. Sales surged 71
percent to S$190.4 million, mainly from projects in Asia outside
China.  “The global outlook remains challenging,” Olivia Lum,
Chief Executive Officer of Hyflux, said in the statement.
“However we still see opportunities in the Middle East and
North Africa region and we are well positioned to capture
these.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
