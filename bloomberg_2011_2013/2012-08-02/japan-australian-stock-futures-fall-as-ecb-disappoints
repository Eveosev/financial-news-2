Japanese and Australia  stock   futures 
fell after European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  failed
to reassure investors on immediate action to support growth and
a surge in Spanish bond yields added to concern about the
region’s debt crisis.  American depositary receipts of  Sony Corp. (6758) , Japan’s No. 1
exporter of consumer electronics, plummeted 8.8 percent from the
closing share price in Tokyo after cutting its profit forecast.
Those of  Sharp Corp. (6753) , Japan’s largest maker of liquid-crystal
displays, slumped 7.1 percent after widening its loss forecast
and announcing job cuts. ADRs of  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , Australia’s
biggest mining company and oil producer, dropped 1.2 percent as
crude prices fell.  Futures on Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  expiring in
September closed at 8,565 in Chicago yesterday, down from 8,630
in Osaka, Japan. They were bid in the pre-market at 8,560 in
Osaka at 8:05 a.m. local time. Futures on Australia’s S&P/ASX
200 Index slid 0.7 percent today. New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index
fell 0.3 percent in Wellington.  “If Spanish bond yields keep rising like this, it will
only increase the chance Spain will apply for assistance,” said
 Shane Oliver , Sydney-based head of investment strategy at AMP
Capital Investors Ltd., which has almost $100 billion under
management. “What was delivered was a commitment to action, but
not immediately. It is a disappointment and it’s a bit of a
setback.”  Spanish Yields  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index dropped 0.1
percent today. The index fell 0.7 percent in New York yesterday
after Draghi signaled the ECB intends to join forces with
governments to buy bonds in sufficient quantities to ease the
Europe’s crisis, while conceding that Germany’s Bundesbank has
reservations about the plan. Details on the plan will be
hammered out in coming weeks, he said after keeping the ECB’s
benchmark interest rate on hold at 0.75 percent.  Yields on Spain’s 10-year government bonds surged 43 basis
points to 7.17 percent yesterday.  On Aug. 1, the  Federal Reserve  also failed to bolster
confidence. Its pledge to provide additional support for the
economy disappointed investors anticipating a more definitive
sign of further monetary easing.  A jobs report today may give more clues about the Fed’s
next steps to ensure the recovery is not derailed. U.S. payrolls
may have increased by 100,000 workers in July, following an
80,000 gain in June, according to the median estimate of
economists surveyed by Bloomberg News ahead of Labor Department
figures. The  unemployment rate  is projected to hold at 8.2
percent.  Oil Falls  Oil for September delivery fell $1.78 to settle at $87.13 a
barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange .  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  fell 8.5 percent from this
year’s high on Feb. 29 through yesterday amid concern policy
makers won’t do enough to counter Europe’s debt crisis and
slowing economic growth in the U.S. and China. The regional
benchmark index traded at 12.1 times  estimated earnings ,
compared with 13.3 for the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPXL1)  and 11.1
for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  In China, the government today is scheduled to report data
on the nation’s non-manufacturing industries in July.  The Bloomberg China-US Equity Index of the most-traded
Chinese companies in the U.S. retreated 0.8 percent to 85.67
yesterday in New York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
