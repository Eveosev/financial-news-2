Oil futures fell in  New York  after
European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  failed to give 
details of a plan designed to shore up the euro by curbing
rising government borrowing costs in the region.  Futures tumbled as much as 1.6 percent after Draghi
signaled at a press conference in Frankfurt that the ECB will
join forces with governments to buy sovereign bonds in
sufficient quantities to remove all doubts about the future of
the euro. Draghi said last week he would do whatever it takes to
protect the currency, stoking speculation he would outline plans
following the central bank meeting today.  “Draghi’s walked us all the way up the hill and all the
way back down again,” said  Michael Hewson , an analyst at CMC
Markets in London. “We’ll continue to see choppy trading but
with a bias to the downside.”  Crude for September delivery fell as much as $1.40 to
$87.51 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  and was at
$88.76 at 9:10 p.m. local time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
