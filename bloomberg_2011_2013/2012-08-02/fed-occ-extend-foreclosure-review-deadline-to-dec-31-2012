The Federal Reserve and Office of the
Comptroller of the Currency extended to the end of the year
their deadline for borrowers to request a review of foreclosures
that may have been mishandled.  The deadline extension “provides more time to increase
awareness about the Independent Foreclosure Review and how
eligible borrowers may request a review, and to encourage the
broadest participation possible,” the regulators said in a
statement today in  Washington .  A group of the largest mortgage servicers was ordered by
the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and other banking
regulators last year to clean up their foreclosure practices and
hire independent consultants to see whether their methods in
2009 and 2010 unfairly hurt customers.  The 14 firms, including  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) ,  Citigroup
Inc. (C) ,  Bank of America Corp.  and  Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC) , could be
instructed to give lump-sum payments of between $500 and
$125,000 in each case involving improper practices.  People who lost homes to foreclosure in 2009 and 2010 can
file to have their cases reviewed for potential errors and
misrepresentations, and can do so through
