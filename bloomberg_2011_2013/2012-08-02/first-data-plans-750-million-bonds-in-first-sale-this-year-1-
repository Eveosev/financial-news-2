First Data Corp., the credit-card
processor owned by KKR & Co., sold $1.3 billion of secured debt,
in its first new bond offering this year.  The 6.75 percent, eight-year securities priced to yield 568
basis points more than similar-maturity Treasuries, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The securities are rated B1 by
Moody’s Investors Service, and B+ by  Standard & Poor’s .  Proceeds from the sale of the first-lien debentures, which
increased from $750 million, will be used for general corporate
purposes, according to a person familiar with the transaction,
who asked not to be identified because the terms are private.  The company tapped the  bond market  in December with a $3
billion offering. Those 12.625 percent securities, due January
2021, traded at 102.3 cents on the dollar to yield 12.2 percent
yesterday in New York, according to Trace, the bond-price
reporting system of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.  Deutsche Bank AG, Wells Fargo & Co., Citigroup Inc., Credit
Suisse Group AG, HSBC Holdings Plc and  SunTrust Banks Inc. (STI) 
managed the sale, Bloomberg data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
