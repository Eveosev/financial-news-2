NBC Sports Chairman Mark Lazarus said
he sees a “small chance” for a profit on the media company’s
coverage of the London Olympics because of larger TV audiences
and higher-than-projected advertising sales.  “We could make a little bit of money,” Lazarus said
during an Olympics media conference today. “We’ll know over the
next couple of weeks.”  The network’s TV audience has exceeded that of the Beijing
games four years ago over six nights so far, Lazarus said. That
has allowed NBC to charge more than expected for additional
advertising time the New York-based company is making available,
he said. The network initially projected a $200 million loss.  NBC Universal  Chief Executive Officer Steve Burke said
yesterday he expects to be “right around” break even.  The TV, film and amusement-park company expects about $1.2
billion in total revenue from the Olympics,  Brian Roberts , CEO
of parent  Comcast Corp. (CMCSA) , said on July 27. NBC Universal paid
about $1.18 billion for TV rights to the Olympics. The company
is spending about $100 million on production,  David Joyce , an
analyst at Miller Tabak & Co. in New York, estimated previously.  Comcast, based in Philadelphia, gained 1.7 percent to
$34.12 at the close in New York. The stock has risen 44 percent
this year,  ranking first  among the 16 companies in the  S&P 500
Media Index. (S5MEDA)   To contact the reporter on this story:
