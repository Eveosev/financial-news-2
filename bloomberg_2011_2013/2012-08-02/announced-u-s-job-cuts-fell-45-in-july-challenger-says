Employers in the U.S. announced
fewer job cuts in August than the same month last year as
government agencies and retailers pared reductions.  Planned  firings  decreased 37 percent from August 2011 to
32,239, according to figures released today by Chicago-based
Challenger, Gray & Christmas Inc. It was the fewest for any
month since December 2010.  “There is a chance workers might be spared from a renewal
of large-scale job cuts, but the situation beyond our borders
certainly will not inspire companies to start adding workers en
masse,” John A. Challenger, chief executive officer of
Challenger, Gray and Christmas, said in a statement. “The
ongoing crisis in  Europe  and weak economies around the globe
will undoubtedly take a toll on the economy.”  Compared with July, job-cut announcements fell 13 percent.
The figures are not adjusted for seasonal effects, so economists
prefer to focus on year-over-year changes rather than monthly
numbers.  Telecommunications led all industries with 4,584 planned
job cuts in August. There were 4,205 planned reductions in the
health-care industry.  Government agencies planned 1,193 dismissals in August,
down from 18,426 a year earlier. Job-cut announcements in the
finance industry fell to 535 in August from 8,094 12 months
earlier. Reductions among retailers totaled 862 last month, down
from 5,901 in August 2011.  California led all states with 8,859 announced dismissals
last month, followed by  Kentucky  with 3,033 job cuts.  Hiring Plans  The report also showed that employers announced plans to
take on 12,079 workers in August compared with 10,350 the prior
month. The  auto industry  showed the largest increase in hiring
plans last month, with 1,843 workers.  The Labor Department tomorrow may report that payrolls
climbed by about 127,000 workers last month after a 163,000
increase in July, according to the median forecast of economists
surveyed by  Bloomberg News . The  unemployment rate  probably held
at 8.3 percent.  Challenger’s data do not always correlate with figures on
payrolls or first-time jobless claims as reported by the
government. Many job cuts are carried out through attrition or
early retirement. Some employees whose jobs are eliminated find
work elsewhere in their companies and many announced staff
reductions never take place because business improves. The
totals also include foreign affiliates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
