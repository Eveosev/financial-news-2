Dangote Sugar Refinery Plc (DANGSUGA) ,  Nigeria ’s
biggest producer of the sweetener, climbed for the first day in
a week after saying first-half profit almost doubled.  The stock gained 3.3 percent to 4.65 naira by 1:22 p.m. in
Lagos, Nigeria’s commercial capital.  Net income for the period through June rose to 5.73 billion
naira ($35.5 million) from 3 billion naira a year earlier, the
company said yesterday in a statement published on the website
of the Nigerian Stock Exchange. Revenue rose to 53.6 billion
naira from 48.6 billion naira.  Dangote’s performance “was driven by a decline in input
costs -- raw sugar, which has trended lower since September 2011
on higher global supplies,” Stanbic IBTC Bank Plc said today in
a note e-mailed to clients.  Dangote Sugar shares have fallen 1.1 percent this year,
compared with a 13 percent rise in the  Nigerian Stock Exchange 
All-Share Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
