Russia ’s southern Stavropol region,
the country’s second-biggest grain grower, harvested 33 percent
less grain than a year earlier, according to regional
Agriculture Ministry data.  Stavropol’s farmers completed harvesting and got 4.2
million metric tons of grains, excluding corn, the ministry
said, citing Nikolai Velikdan, deputy head of the regional
government. Frosts in winter, drought in spring and summer and
rains during harvesting cut the crop, the ministry said in a
statement on its  website  yesterday.  Last year, Stavropol harvested 6.3 million tons of grains
excluding corn, according to the ministry. Total grains output
was 8.2 million tons, according to the state statistics data.  The average grain yield in the region was 2.22 tons per
hectare (2.47 acres), down from 3.9 tons in 2011, according to
Stavropol’s agriculture ministry data.  This year’s crop has better grain quality, Velikdan said.
Milling grain quality accounts for 89 percent of the harvest
this year, up from 82 percent a year ago, he said.  Wheat for September delivery dropped 1.6 percent to $8.6575
a bushel at 11:39 a.m. London time on the Chicago Board of
Trade.  To contact the reporter on this story:
