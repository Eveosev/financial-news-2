Petrominerales Ltd. (PMGC) , a Calgary-based
 oil company  that operates in the Andean region, dropped the most
in three months after reporting declines in production and
exploration results that disappointed investors.  Shares fell 17 percent to 13,780 pesos at 12:40 p.m. in
Bogota after losing 18 percent for the biggest decrease since
April 27. Petrominerales has lost 56 percent this year, compared
with a 4.7 return on the benchmark Colcap Index.  Production, which averaged 31,113 barrels of oil a day in
the second quarter, was 12 percent lower in July at 27,453
barrels. Second-quarter production was 9 percent lower than the
first quarter, the company said in a statement.  July output was 14 percent below RBC Capital’s forecast for
the third quarter, analysts Nathan Piper and Theresa Pfab wrote
in a report.  “Exploration drilling results continue to disappoint in
 Colombia , with the initial production test on the key Bromelia
well unsuccessful,” they wrote.  The initial interpretation of testing on the first zone of
a formation of the Bromelia prospect showed the residual heavy
oil found “would not be economic to produce,” the company said
in the statement. Petrominerales plans to complete testing in
other areas by early in the fourth quarter.  Petrominerales shares traded in Toronto fell to the lowest
intraday level since February 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
