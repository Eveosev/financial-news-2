Serbiia’s fiscal situation is worse
than expected and the deficit has reached 2.2 billion euros
($2.7 billion), Tanjug news agency cited Finance Minister
 Mladjan Dinkic  as saying.  The gap includes 170 million euros that the previous
government “pumped into three state-owned banks,” Tanjug
reported, citing Dinkic. The minister said he would need a month
to figure out what has been done with the budget and whether
there are any hidden deficits, according to Tanjug.  To contact the reporter on this story:
