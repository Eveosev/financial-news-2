Fuchs Petrolub AG (FPE) , the world’s
largest independent lubricants maker, reported first-half profit
that beat analyst estimates and said it still expects earnings
to gain this year as the economic climate is “satisfactory.”  Earnings before interest and taxes gained 8.9 percent to
145.4 million euros ($178.2 million), the Mannheim, Germany-
based company said today in an e-mailed statement. Analysts had
predicted 142.3 million euros, according to a Bloomberg survey.  Chief Executive Officer Stefan Fuchs is also sticking to a
full-year target to increase revenue as the company boosts its
sales force and seeks acquisitions. Competition for assets has
increased as Lubrizol Corp., bought by  Warren Buffett ’s
 Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A)  last year, seeks to boost revenue 60
percent to $10 billion with the help of two or three deals a
year, CEO  James Hambrick  said in April.  “The global economic situation worsened in the second
quarter of 2012,” Fuchs said in the statement. “Fuchs still
assesses the economic situation as satisfactory and expects to
continue to grow sales in the second half.”  Sales gained 11 percent to 910 million euros and net income
rose 11 percent to 101.9 million euros in the first half, said
the company, which is majority owned by the Fuchs family.
Analysts had expected 899.8 million euros in revenue.  To contact the reporter on this story:
