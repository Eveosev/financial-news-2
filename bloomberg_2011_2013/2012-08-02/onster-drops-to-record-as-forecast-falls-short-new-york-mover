Monster Worldwide Inc. (MWW) , the Internet
recruiting service exploring a possible sale, tumbled after
forecasting earnings that fell short of analysts’ predictions,
citing European economic weakness.  Shares fell 14 percent to $6.10 at the close in New York,
the lowest since March 2009. The stock has fallen 23 percent
this year. The New York-based company said earlier that earnings
in the current quarter will be 2 cents to 7 cents a share. That
missed the 9-cent average analyst estimate, based on data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Europe , where growth is being hampered by a debt crisis, is
a “big concern,” while  China  has also slowed
“significantly,” Chief Executive Officer Sal Iannuzzi said in
an interview today. Monster Worldwide’s efforts to find a buyer
may be hampered by disappointing results, said Jeffrey Silber,
an analyst at BMO Capital Markets in  New York .  “It will be tough in this environment for them to get the
price they would want on a sale,” said Silber, who rates
Monster Worldwide the equivalent of buy. “The economy is
shrinking in the hiring market, and that is probably the biggest
factor in earnings.”  Bookings, an indicator of future sales, will be flat or
down 10 percent in the current quarter from a year earlier, the
company said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
