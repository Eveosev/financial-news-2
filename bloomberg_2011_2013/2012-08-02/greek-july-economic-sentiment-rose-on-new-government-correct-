(Corrects to show IOBE foundation corrected its retail
sector sentiment figure in last paragraph.)  Greek economic sentiment improved in
July after national elections in June led to the formation of a
government under Prime Minister Antonis Samaras.  An index measuring short-term economic trends advanced to
76.1 from a seven-month low of 74.1 in June, the Athens-based
 Foundation for Economic & Industrial Research , known as IOBE,
said in an e-mailed report today.  Consumer confidence  improved
to minus 64.7 from minus 70.4, the foundation said.  Samaras formed a three-party coalition after the June 17
election on pledges to renegotiate the terms of a European Union
and International Monetary Fund bailout package and keep  Greece 
in the euro area. Inconclusive elections in May, in which
parties that rejected the terms of the bailout gained support,
had led to the second vote.  “The formation of a government had a positive effect,
especially on consumer confidence, where there are post-election
hopes for upcoming changes in the policies being implemented,”
IOBE said in the report.  Sentiment in the retail sector rose to 62.7, the highest
level in nine months, boosted by the sales season.  To contact the reporter on this story:
