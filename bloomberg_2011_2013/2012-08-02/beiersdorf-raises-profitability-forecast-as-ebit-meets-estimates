Beiersdorf AG (BEI) , the maker of Nivea
skin cream, raised its annual profitability forecast after
reporting second-quarter profit that matched analysts’ estimates
as sales rose in emerging markets.  The company now expects earnings before interest and taxes
as a percentage of sales to be about 12 percent, higher than a
previous forecast of between 11 percent and 12 percent. Adjusted
Ebit rose to 192 million euros ($235 million) from 183 million
euros in the year-earlier period, the Hamburg-based company said
in a statement today. The  average estimate  of 11 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg was 191.5 million euros.  “We are on the right track with our moves to strengthen
our brands and innovative capabilities as well as expanding our
presence and impact on the  emerging markets ,” Chief Executive
Officer Stefan Heidenreich said in a statement today.  Beiersdorf, which gets almost 40 percent of revenue outside
Europe, said revenue in the Americas gained 13 percent, while
sales in  Africa ,  Asia  and  Australia  advanced 19 percent. German
companies are tapping growth in emerging markets as the
sovereign-debt crisis curbs demand in the euro area, where
economic confidence is at a three-year low.  Sales dropped to 1.53 billion euros from 1.5 billion euros
a year earlier, the company said. That missed the 1.55 billion-
euro average estimate of 17 analysts. Beiersdorf expects sales
growth of about 3 percent this year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
