Light-distillate supplies in
 Singapore ,  Asia ’s biggest oil-trading, refining and storage
center, rose to the highest in four weeks, according to a unit
of the Ministry of Trade and Industry.  Inventories of naphtha, gasoline and reformate gained by
981,000 barrels, or 11 percent, to 10.3 million in the seven
days ended yesterday, International Enterprise Singapore said in
an e-mailed statement today. That’s the most since the week
ended July 4.  Middle-distillate stockpiles, including gasoil and
kerosene, rose 411,000 barrels, or 4.9 percent, to 8.9 million,
according to the data.  Residual-fuel stockpiles, including  fuel oil  and low-sulfur
waxy residue and excluding bitumen, increased for a second week,
gaining 2.2 million barrels, or 13 percent, to 19.8 million
barrels.  The trade ministry surveys refiners, traders and storage
terminals on a voluntary basis. The results may exclude offshore
storage capacity, International Enterprise said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
