Bank of America Corp. , the second-
biggest U.S. credit-card lender, said it will contribute a total
of $738 million to settle a price-fixing case brought by
retailers over credit-card swipe fees.  The lender agreed to pay $199 million in cash for claims
related to  MasterCard Inc. (MA)  in addition to $539 million that  Visa
Inc. (V)  previously deposited into a litigation escrow fund, the
Charlotte, North Carolina-based bank said today in a regulatory
filing.  Visa and MasterCard, the worldâ€™s biggest payment networks,
and some of the largest U.S. banks agreed last month to pay
merchants $6.6 billion and temporarily reduce credit-card swipe
fees, or interchange, to settle the antitrust lawsuit in federal
court in  Brooklyn , New York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
