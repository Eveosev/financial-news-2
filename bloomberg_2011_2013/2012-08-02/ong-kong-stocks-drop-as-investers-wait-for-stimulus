Hong Kong   stocks  fell, with the  Hang
Seng Index (HSI)  poised to snap its longest rising streak since
January, as investors wait for further stimulus measures in
Europe and the U.S. to counteract a worsening economic outlook.  China Resources Enterprise Ltd. (291) , a beverage maker and
supermarket operator that rose 15 percent in the last five days,
dropped 2.5 percent.  China Shenhua Energy Co. (1088) , the country’s
biggest coal producer, fell 1.9 percent after Sanford C.
Bernstein & Co. said prices for the fuel have yet to bottom.
China Yurun Food Group Ltd., the nation’s second-largest meat-
product supplier, rose 17 percent amid speculation China will
release corn from its state inventory, reducing the cost of pork
production.  The Hang Seng Index retreated 0.8 percent to 19,666.78 as
of 1:24 p.m., with more than three shares falling for each that
rose on the 49-member gauge, which increased 5 percent in the
last five days. Volume fell 18 percent compared with the 30-day
average for the time of day. The  Hang Seng China Enterprises
Index (HSCEI)  of mainland companies dropped 1.2 percent to 9,648.07.  “It seems that the market has gone too far, without the
stimulus package announced by the  Federal Reserve , the market
has an excuse for a single day pull-back,”  Castor Pang , head of
research at Core-Pacific Yamaichi International Ltd. in Hong
Kong. “If they don’t announce interest-rate cuts in Europe, the
short-term correction will become a major correction.”  The benchmark Hang Seng Index fell 8.6 percent from this
year’s high in February through yesterday on signs Europe’s debt
crisis is worsening while growth slows in China and the U.S. The
drop cut the  value  of shares on the gauge to 10.5 times
estimated earnings on average, compared with 13.4 for the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and 11.2 for Stoxx Europe 600 Index.  Coal Producers  Coal producers fell after  Michael Parker , a Hong Kong-based
analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein, said prices of the fuel haven’t
reached a bottom.  “There are, or will shortly be, hundreds of millions of
tons of idled coal production capacity in China right now,” he
wrote in an emailed research note today.  China Shenhua Energy fell 1.9 percent to HK$28.75.  China
Coal Energy Co. (1898) , the second-largest coal producer, lost 1
percent to HK$7.29. Huaneng Renewables Corp., a clean-energy
unit of China’s biggest electricity producer, fell 1 percent to
99 Hong Kong cents.  China Yurun rose 17 percent to HK$5.41, its steepest rise
since its listing in 2005. Pork prices fell 0.4 percent in the
week ended July 29 from the previous week, according to a
statement by the Ministry of Commerce.  “The government has signaled it is preparing to sell state
inventory” of corn to control prices, Shanghai JC Chairman Li
Qiang said, citing discussions with feed mills.  Futures, Volatility  Futures on the Hang Seng Index retreated 0.8 percent to
19,634. The  HSI Volatility Index (VHSI)  gained 2.2 percent to 21.31,
indicating traders expect a swing of about 6.1 percent in the
benchmark index during the next 30 days.  Cheung Kong (Holdings) Ltd. (1) , a Hong Kong property developer
owned by Asia’s richest man  Li Ka-shing , lost 1 percent to
HK$102.40. The company is scheduled to report earnings after
Hong Kong’s stock market closes today. Wharf Holdings Ltd., a
developer that gets two-thirds of its revenue in Hong Kong, slid
2 percent to HK$44.60.  “Investors are quite wary,” said Peter Elston, Singapore-
based head of Asia-Pacific strategy at Aberdeen Asset
Management. The firm oversees about $270 billion. “We are still
cautious about China. You look at the policy response to the
weakness, it’s all about boosting investment, which is how China
got into trouble in the first place.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
