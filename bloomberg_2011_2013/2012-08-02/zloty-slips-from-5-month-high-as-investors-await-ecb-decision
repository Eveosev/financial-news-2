The Polish zloty slipped from its
strongest level against the euro in five months as investors
awaited a policy announcement by the  European Central Bank .  The zloty weakened less than 0.1 percent to 4.1062 per euro
as of 12:25 p.m. in Warsaw. It advanced 2.6 percent last month
and closed yesterday at the highest since March 9.  ECB policy makers are meeting today for the first time
since President  Mario Draghi  pledged to do whatever is needed to
protect the euro.  Europe ’s common currency strengthened against
most of its 16 major counterparts today.  “Any disappointment may lead to a correction” in the
zloty, Rafal Benecki and Grzegorz Ogonek, economists at ING Bank
Slaski SA in Warsaw, wrote in a note to clients. “If ECB plans
are taken positively,” the zloty may gain to 4.08 per euro,
they said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
