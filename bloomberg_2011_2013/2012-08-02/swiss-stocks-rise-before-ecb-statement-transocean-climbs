Swiss stocks  closed at a 14-month
high, led by gains in Transocean Ltd.,  Nestle (NESN)  SA,  Novartis (NOVN)  AG
and  Roche (ROG)  Holding AG.  Transocean rose 1.3 percent after posting earnings that
beat estimates. Nestle, Novartis and Roche, which make up about
60 percent of the  Swiss Market Index (SMI) , advanced. UBS AG and
Credit Suisse Group AG,  Switzerland ’s largest lenders, fell 1.5
percent and 3.9 percent, respectively.  The Swiss Market Index added 0.1 percent to 6,407.3 at the
close of trading in Zurich, paring an earlier rally of as much
as 1.4 percent as European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi ’s
comments at a press briefing disappointed investors seeking more
definitive measures to stimulate the euro-area’s economy. That’s
still the highest level since June 2011. The market was closed
yesterday for a holiday. The broader Swiss Performance Index
lost less than 0.1 percent today.  “Draghi rowed back a bit at the press conference, which
clearly disappointed the markets,” said Benno Galliker, a
trader at Luzerner Kantonalbank AG in Lucerne, Switzerland.
“The situation seems a bit disoriented. Draghi seems like he’d
like to do more, but he can’t, and the ECB seems a bit clueless.
Investors are fleeing into the safest values like Nestle, Roche
and Novartis.”  ECB policy makers meeting in  Frankfurt  today left the
benchmark rate at a record low of 0.75 percent, as predicted by
51 of 55 economists in a Bloomberg News survey. Four predicted a
cut to 0.5 percent. The deposit rate was held at zero.  Bond Buying  Draghi signaled the bank will join forces with governments
to buy sovereign bonds in sufficient quantities to remove all
doubts about the future of the euro. Details of the bond-
purchase plan will be fleshed out in coming weeks, he said.  The SMI has rallied 5 percent since July 26, when Draghi
pledged to do “whatever it takes” to save a euro battered for
almost three years by spiraling bond yields in countries from
 Spain  to Greece.  The volume of shares changing hands in companies listed on
the SMI was 69 percent higher than the average of the last 30
days, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  In the U.S., central bankers led by Federal Reserve
Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  concluded their two-day meeting
yesterday saying they “will provide additional accommodation as
needed” to bolster the expansion. The  Federal Open Market
Committee  also said it will “closely monitor” economic data
and financial developments.  A Labor Department report showed that U.S.  initial jobless
claims  climbed to 365,000 last week, up from a revised 357,000
the previous week. Economists in a Bloomberg survey had called
for a rise to 370,000.  Transocean Jumps  Transocean, the world’s largest offshore-rig contractor, 
gained 1.3 percent to 47.10 Swiss francs. The company reported
second-quarter earnings that beat analysts’ estimates as it
controlled costs to maintain its rigs, partly to satisfy more
stringent safety regulations following the Macondo oil spill.  Excluding various one-time items including a $750 million
charge related to Macondo, per-share earnings beat the average
of 32 analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg by 28 cents.
Sales climbed 10 percent to $2.6 billion.  Nestle, the world’s biggest food company, rose 0.7 percent
to 60.45 francs, its highest price since at least October 1989,
contributing the most to the SMI’s advance. Novartis climbed 1.1
percent to 57.90 francs, its highest price since December 2010.
Roche, the world’s biggest maker of cancer drugs, added 0.6
percent to 174.40 francs.  Banks Fall  UBS (UBSN)  lost 1.5 percent to 10.14 Swiss francs and  Credit
Suisse (CSGN)  fell 3.9 percent to 16.01 francs.  Metall Zug AG (METN) , Switzerland’s biggest supplier of industrial
dishwashers, slumped 8.8 percent to 1,990 francs, the biggest
decline since November 2008, after Christian Arnold, an analyst
at Vontobel Holding AG, cut the stock to hold from buy.  Acino Holding AG (ACIN)  fell 2.1 percent to 109 francs after the
developer of drug delivery technologies reported first-half
profit that missed analysts’ estimates. Earnings before interest
and tax excluding acquisition-related items rose to 10 million
euros ($12 million) from 2.8 million euros, the company said.
The median of two analysts’ estimates was 11.2 million euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
