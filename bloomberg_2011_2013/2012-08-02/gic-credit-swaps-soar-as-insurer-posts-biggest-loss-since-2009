The cost to protect the debt of  MGIC
Investment Corp. (MTG)  jumped as the mortgage insurer reported its
biggest net loss since 2009 and its eighth consecutive
unprofitable quarter.  Credit-default swaps tied to MGIC increased 8.1 percentage
points to 39.4 percent upfront, according to data provider CMA,
which is owned by McGraw-Hill Cos. and compiles prices quoted by
dealers in the privately negotiated market. That’s in addition
to 5 percent a year, meaning it would cost $3.94 million
initially and $500,000 annually to protect $10 million of the
company’s debt for five years.  MGIC, which hasn’t reported a  profit  since the second
quarter of 2010, said that its net loss for the period ended
June 30 was $273.9 million, widening from a loss of $151.7
million a year earlier, the Milwaukee-based company said today
in a statement distributed by PR Newswire. That’s the largest
quarterly loss for the mortgage insurer since it forfeited
$280.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2009, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Mortgage insurers pay lenders when homeowners default and
foreclosures fail to recoup costs.  Credit-default swaps typically rise as investor confidence
deteriorates and fall as it improves. The contracts pay the
buyer face value if a borrower fails to meet its obligations,
less the value of the defaulted debt. A basis point equals
$1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10 million of debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
