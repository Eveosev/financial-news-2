Commodity-related stocks are poised
to beat benchmark indexes in the next few decades as resources
become scarcer, according to Jeremy Grantham, chief investment
strategist at Grantham, Mayo, Van Otterloo & Co.  “I am even more convinced than I was a year ago of the
inevitability of rising resource prices,” Grantham wrote two
days ago in a quarterly report to his fund company’s investors.
Producers will benefit at the expense of other companies, which
will have to cope with higher raw-material costs, he wrote.  The CHART OF THE DAY tracks the ratio of a Morgan Stanley
index of energy, metals and agricultural shares to the Standard
& Poor’s 500 Index, along with the Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB
Index of raw materials.  Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan Inc., the world’s largest
maker of fertilizer, and  Goldcorp Inc. (G) , the second-biggest gold
producer by market value, led the commodity-stock index to a
threefold gain since 2000. The  S&P 500  fell 6.3 percent during
the same period.  Institutions looking ahead more than 10 years “should move
steadily to adopt a major holding of resource-related
investments,” Grantham wrote. The Boston-based strategist
recommended focusing on owners of farms and forests.  His Grantham Foundation for the Protection of the
Environment is seeking to invest 30 percent of assets in the
category, he added. The current stake is about 20 percent. The
foundation had $353.8 million of assets at the end of 2010, the
most recent date available in regulatory  filings .  To contact the reporter on this story:
