Spain  sold 3.13 billion euros ($3.84
billion) of bonds today, exceeding a target of 3 billion euros
even as borrowing costs rose before a European Central Bank
policy makers’ meeting to discuss ways to ease the debt crisis.  The Treasury in Madrid sold its 10-year benchmark bond at
an average yield of 6.647 percent, compared with 6.430 percent
at the last auction on July 5, and debt maturing in October 2016
at an average rate of 5.971 percent, compared with 5.536 percent
last month. A July 2014 bond was sold to yield 4.774 percent.  Demand for the 10-year securities was 2.4 times the amount
sold, down from 3.18 times in July, while the bid-to-cover ratio
for the 2016 bonds was 2.72 compared with 2.56. It was 3 times
for the 2014 securities.  Spanish debt surged from  euro-era lows  after ECB President
 Mario Draghi  last week said he will do whatever is needed to
defend the euro. The central bank meets as European leaders
debate the role it could play alongside European rescue funds to
protect the area’s largest economies’ access to markets.  The yield on Spain’s  10-year bonds  fell 5 basis points to
6.66 percent at 10:57 a.m. in Madrid after the auction. That
left the gap with similar German maturities at 5.28 percentage
points, compared with a record 6.5 percentage points on July 25.  Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy  will hold a news conference in
Madrid after 2 p.m. with  Mario Monti  as his Italian counterpart
tours  Europe  to rally support for efforts to bring down
borrowing costs. In  Finland  yesterday, Monti said the euro-
area’s permanent rescue fund should have access to ECB liquidity
via a bank license, challenging German policy makers to back
more actions to tame the debt crisis.  To contact the reporter on this story:
