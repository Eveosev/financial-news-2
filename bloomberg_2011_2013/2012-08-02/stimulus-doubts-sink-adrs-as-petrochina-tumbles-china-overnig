Chinese energy producers fell in  New
York , sending the benchmark index to its longest losing streak
in two months, after central banks from  China , Europe and the
U.S. failed to deliver new stimulus to bolster growth.  The  Bloomberg China-US Equity Index (CH55BN)  of the most-traded
Chinese companies in the U.S. retreated for a fourth day, losing
0.8 percent to 85.67 yesterday in New York.  PetroChina Co. (PTR) , the
nation’s largest oil explorer, sank the most in six weeks and
 Yanzhou Coal Mining Co. (YZC) , the country’s fourth-largest producer
of the fuel, retreated from a one-month high. Container ship
operator  Seaspan Corp. (SSW)  climbed to a three-week high as second-
quarter adjusted profit beat analysts’ estimates.  The People’s Bank of China said yesterday it will keep
pursuing “prudent” monetary policy, reiterating the
government’s focus on stemming a slowdown without implementing a
stimulus comparable to that in late 2008. European Central Bank
President  Mario Draghi  said yesterday the ECB will join forces
with governments to buy sovereign bonds, after keeping the
benchmark interest rate on hold. The U.S. Federal Reserve
refrained this week from adding stimulus to the economy.  “There’s disappointment that there’s no white knight on
the horizon to save the world economy, therefore Chinese
cyclicals tied to domestic or global growth are going down,”
Nicholas Field, who helps oversee $23 billion of emerging market
assets at  Schroders Plc (SDR) , said in a phone interview from London
yesterday. “There’s been a slow reduction in expectations for
Chinese policy over this year.”  China ETF Drops  The  iShares FTSE China 25 Index Fund , the biggest Chinese
exchange-traded fund in the U.S., slid 1 percent to $33.96,
snapping a two-day increase. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index of
the biggest U.S. shares declined for a fourth day, losing 0.7
percent to 1,365.  China cut  interest rates  in June and July, the first
reductions since 2008, and is encouraging local governments to
boost investment as economists forecast 2012 growth will be the
slowest in 13 years. The country’s Ministry of Railways said on
July 31 that it plans to spend 470 billion  yuan  ($74 billion) on
railroads and bridges this year, less than the 601 billion yuan
directed toward the sector in 2009. Authorities enacted a 4
trillion yuan stimulus program during the global financial
crisis.  Draghi said the central bank may “undertake outright open
market operations of a size adequate to reach its objective.”
Commodities and oil fell.  Expectations ‘Too High’  “Markets are struggling to interpret what Draghi’s
comments mean for economic growth,” Joseph Tanious, a
strategist at JPMorgan Funds, who helps oversee $394 billion,
said by phone from New York yesterday. “Expectations for the
ECB may have been too high.”  PetroChina’s American depositary receipts dropped 2.9
percent to 121.98, the steepest decline since June 21, as crude
traded in New York fell 2 percent to $87.13 a barrel on the  New
York Mercantile Exchange . The ADRs, each representing 100
ordinary shares, traded 1.5 perent  below  its Hong Kong stock,
the widest discount in six weeks.  Yanzhou Coal declined 2.8 percent to $15.35, extending its
loss for 2012 to 28 percent. Coal prices in China haven’t
reached a bottom, Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. said in an e-mailed
research note yesterday.  China’s benchmark price for power-station coal fell for a
12th week to the lowest level since 2009 as electricity demand
slowed and hydropower output increased. Coal with an energy
value of 5,500 kilocalories per kilogram at the Chinese port of
Qinhuangdao dropped to a range of 620 yuan to 635 yuan a metric
ton as of July 30, according to the China Coal Transport and
Distribution Association.  Solars Decline  Yingli Green Energy Holding Co. (YGE) , the world’s sixth-largest
silicon-based solar module producer, lost 5.5 percent to a
record low of $1.55. Daiwa Securities Co. analysts cut the price
estimate for the stock to $1.4 yesterday from $3.25.  Suntech
Power Holdings Co. (STP) , the world’s biggest solar company, dropped
5.9 percent to 95 cents, tumbling for a fourth day.  Trina Solar
Ltd. (TSL)  sank 6.8 percent to $4.28, the lowest level since March
2009.  Hong Kong-based Seaspan added 1.4 percent to $15.80,
extending a six-day rally to 5.7 percent. The company said
adjusted net income was 35 cents per share for the quarter ended
June 30, from 24 cents a year earlier and compared with a 32-
cent  average forecast  of nine analysts in a Bloomberg survey.  Seaspan also said shareholders elected Harald Ludwig to be
a board director in a statement dated Aug. 1. Separately, Deep
Water Holdings LLC, based in Montana state, reported it held
22.4 percent of Seaspan ordinary shares in a  regulatory filing 
dated Aug. 1.  China Eastern Airlines Corp. (CEA) , the nation’s second-biggest
carrier, gained 1.2 percent to $17.27 yesterday in New York.  Andrew Orchard, an analyst at CIMB Securities HK Ltd. began
coverage on the stock with an outperform recommendation.  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  fell 0.6 percent to 2,111.18
yesterday while the  Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  of Chinese
companies traded in Hong Kong lost 1 percent, the most in a
week, to 9,669.21.  To contact the reporters on this story:
