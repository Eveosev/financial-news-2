Apple Inc. was sued in  Texas  over
allegations it knew of defects in the motherboards of its
MacBook and MacBook Pro laptop computers and didn’t correct
them.  “As the logic boards fail, the MacBook Pro and MacBooks
are rendered useless,” Omar Rosales said in the complaint filed
today in federal court in McAllen, Texas. “Apple is and was
aware of this substantial defect, but it failed to disclose
it.”  Rosales, in the complaint seeking class-action, or group
status to sue on behalf of all U.S. buyers of the  computers ,
asks for replacement computers, full refunds or reimbursement
for repair costs.  Rosales said his own 2008 MacBook failed after two years,
and he paid $335.58 to repair its defective motherboard,
according to the complaint. He said he since located hundreds of
similar complaints online from owners of MacBooks that failed
for the same reason.  “The web page listing MacBook Pro Logic Board Failure has
been viewed more than 100,676 times,” Rosales said in the
complaint.  Kristin Huguet, a spokeswoman for Cupertino, California-
based Apple, declined to comment on the lawsuit.  The case is Rosales v.  Apple Inc. (AAPL) , 7:12-cv-00251, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of Texas (McAllen).  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
