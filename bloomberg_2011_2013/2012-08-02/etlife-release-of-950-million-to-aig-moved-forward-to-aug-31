MetLife Inc. (MET) , which held part of the
purchase price in escrow after buying a unit from American
International Group Inc. in 2010, agreed to release $950 million
sooner than previously planned, AIG said in a filing today.  The insurers struck a deal last month which, “among other
things, provided that $950 million would be released to AIG on
August 31, 2012 instead of November 1, 2012 as originally
provided under the ALICO stock purchase agreement,” New York
based AIG said in a regulatory filing today.  Chris Breslin, a spokesman for New York-based MetLife, and
AIG’s Jim Ankner didn’t immediately return a call seeking
comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
