The pound fell to the lowest in
almost three weeks against the euro on bets the Bank of England
will be less aggressive than European policy makers in adopting
measures to stimulate the economy.  Sterling snapped a three-day drop versus the dollar and
gilts were little changed. The Monetary Policy Committee will
keep its bond-buying program at 375 billion pounds ($584
billion) and leave  interest rates  at a record-low 0.5 percent,
according to Bloomberg News surveys. European Central Bank
President  Mario Draghi  said last week that he will do whatever
is needed to preserve the 17-nation currency.  “The market is buying into the idea the ECB will deliver,
which is helping euro against sterling,” said Tom Levinson, a
foreign-exchange strategist at ING Groep NV in London. “It
would be a major surprise if the Bank of England announced
anything today.”  The pound fell 0.3 percent to 78.92 pence per euro at 11:37
a.m. London time, after depreciating to 79.07 pence, the weakest
level since July 13. The U.K. currency advanced 0.1 percent to
$1.5551, after dropping to $1.5523, the least since July 26.  Sterling has depreciated 1.7 percent in the past three
months, the fourth-worst performer among 10 developed-nation
currencies tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes
amid the deteriorating economy. The dollar gained 2.9 percent in
the period, while the euro slid 4.8 percent.  The yield on the 10-year gilt was at 1.51 percent after
falling to a record 1.407 percent on July 23. The 4 percent bond
maturing in March 2022 traded at 122.195.  Expanded Toolkit  The ECB may announce a plan today to tackle the debt crisis
that’s hurting global growth, even as it keeps its main rate at
0.75 percent, also an all-time low, according to another survey.  The  Bank of England  has expanded its toolkit with its
Funding for Lending Scheme to unclog bank credit and help pull
the country out of a double-dip recession. The worsening outlook
prompted banks including Morgan Stanley and Barclays Plc to
revise forecasts this week and predict more U.K. stimulus later
this year.  The British economy shrank the most since 2009 in the
second quarter, the  Office for National Statistics  said July 25.
Manufacturing contracted in June at the fastest rate in 2 1/2
years, data yesterday from  Markit Economics  showed.  Gilt Returns  Investors brought forward bets the Bank of England will
lower rates by October, according to Sonia forward contracts.
Policy makers will cut their benchmark rate by 25 basis points
to 0.25 percent by its Oct. 4 meeting, data from Tullett Prebon
Plc shows. Earlier today, traders were betting on a reduction in
November, the data showed.  U.K. gilts returned 3.9 percent this year, after surging 17
percent in 2011 as investors sought a haven from the euro-
region’s debt crisis, indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the
European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies showed.
German bunds gained 3.6 percent in 2012, with U.S. Treasuries
earning 2.6 percent.  The Bank of England increased its asset-purchase program by
50 billion pounds at its meeting on July 5.  The 10-year gilt yield declined 7 basis points to 1.66
percent and the pound fell 0.4 percent to $1.5525 on the day. It
strengthened 0.7 percent versus the euro.  To contact the reporter on this story:
