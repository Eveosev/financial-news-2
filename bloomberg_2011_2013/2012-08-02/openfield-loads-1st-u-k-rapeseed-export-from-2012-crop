Openfield Group Ltd., the U.K.’s
largest grain cooperative, said it started loading the first
major export cargo of rapeseed from the country’s 2012 harvest
at its Lingrain port facility in Boston,  England .  U.K. rapeseed production may fall this year after a
difficult growing season with “abnormal weather,” according to
Openfield. First harvest results show average yields of 3.1 to
3.5 metric tons per hectare (2.47 acres), with about 10 percent
to 15 percent of the crop cut, the cooperative wrote in a
 statement  on its website today.  “Of the early crop we have seen so far it is fair to say
that quality is not as good as last year,” John Thorpe,
Openfield’s head for oilseed rape, was cited as saying. “There
is still a lot of uncertainty as to the crop outcome.”  Loading of the 2,200 metric-ton capacity Union Topaz began
on July 30, with the cargo of rapeseed destined for Rotterdam,
Openfield said. The Lingrain facility can load 300 tons of grain
per hour, according to the company’s  website .  “We’re pleased to be off to a good start in what has been
a challenging growing season for the majority of U.K. growers,”
Adrian Morrell, Openfield’s store manager at the  Boston 
facility, was cited as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
