Russia ’s antitrust watchdog is urging
the government to open access to oil and gas deposits on the
continental shelf to non-state producers such as OAO Lukoil.  The Federal Anti-Monopoly Service has proposed changes to
the subsoil resource law that would drop a requirement that
bidders for the offshore licenses be state controlled, according
to a draft published on the service’s  website  yesterday. The
amendments would ensure the national security services have the
right to restrict access for companies with foreign investors.  The draft also retains requirements that producers have
five years of experience developing deposits offshore, according
to the document.  Lukoil, which President  Vladimir Putin  touted to investors
in June as an example of a Russian company with foreign
participation, has lobbied against the current law, which has
blocked it from seeking licenses to deposits in Russia’s Arctic
and Black seas. Vagit Alekperov, billionaire chief executive
officer, told Putin at the time that the second-largest Russian
oil producer is 50 percent foreign owned.  Lukoil has experience developing oil and gas projects in
the Caspian and Baltic seas.  OAO Rosneft, Russia’s largest oil producer, seeks to lead
the country’s offshore development, signing exploration accords
this year with Exxon Mobil Corp., Eni SpA and Statoil ASA. The
company has also offered Russia’s non-state companies, including
BP Plc’s Russian oil venture TNK-BP, possible participation in
projects on the continental shelf.  To contact the reporter on this story:
