Randy Lerner  sold the  Cleveland
Browns  to James Haslam III for more than $1 billion, ESPN
reported, citing an unidentified National Football League
executive.  Haslam is a part owner of the Pittsburgh Steelers and
president of Pilot Travel Centers LLC, the nation’s largest
operator of travel centers and truck stops. He is also the
brother of Tennessee Governor Bill Haslam.  Browns spokesman Neal Gulkis declined comment.  Lerner, 50, who also owns the Aston Villa soccer club, said
last week he was talking to Haslam about “making an
investment” in the team and he would share further details at a
later date.  To contact the reporter on this story:
