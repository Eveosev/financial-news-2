The trading losses at  Knight Capital 
Group Inc. renewed pressure on Washington regulators to prove
they are equipped to protect investors in markets that are
increasingly computerized and fragmented.  The software problem, which disrupted the market opening
Aug. 1, has cost Knight $440 million and left the company
looking for a financial infusion. It comes on the heels of other
high-profile technological lapses that botched the initial
public offerings of  Facebook Inc. (FB)  and Bats Global Markets Inc.  While the Securities and Exchange Commission has issued a
flurry of rules aimed at tamping down rapid market swings, some
former regulators, market participants and lawmakers said the
measures don’t go far enough. They called for the agency to
bolster its stable of experts, tighten oversight and intensify
its focus on high frequency trading.  “Things like this call the attention of regulators and
people on the Hill to what really goes on in these markets --and
they’ve been ignoring this stuff for years,” said  Bill Brown , a
professor at Duke University School of Law and a former managing
director at  Morgan Stanley. (MS)  “I hate to say this, but I am glad
the chickens are coming home to roost now before they end up
doing too much damage.”  SEC Chairman  Mary Schapiro , whose agency is the main market
overseer in Washington, today described the Knight event as
“unacceptable,” and promised to issue regulations to help
prevent similar mishaps.  Accelerating Efforts  “I have asked the staff to accelerate ongoing efforts to
propose a rule to require exchanges and other market centers to
have specific programs in place to ensure the capacity and
integrity of their systems,” she said in a statement. The
chairman also said the agency will hold a public meeting with
industry participants in the coming weeks “to discuss further
steps that can be taken to address these critical issues.”  Representative Maxine Waters of California, a senior
Democrat on the House Financial Services Committee, said the
panel should hold hearings to get to the bottom of the turmoil.  “Though we don’t yet know precisely what caused the
problem with Knight Capital, with a drumbeat of financial market
snafus continuing, it’s clear that the industry, with guidance
from regulators, needs to strengthen their internal controls,”
Waters said.  “Like the problems with the Facebook initial public
offering, events like this only further serve to undermine
investor confidence in the markets,” she said.  ‘Disturbingly Vulnerable’  Representative  Brad Miller , a North Carolina Democrat on
the Financial Services panel, said the Knight incident makes him
think that markets are “disturbingly vulnerable” and worry
that “the technology is not as reliable as we need.”  The SEC fueled the march to electronic trading when it
passed rules in 2005 designed to drive down costs for investors
and increase competition with the then-dominant  New York Stock
Exchange. (NYX)  Now about 50 venues get trades that are mostly handled
by computers.  A growing number of critics say the policy may have worked
too well, fostering so much fragmentation that the SEC and other
market cops can’t get a handle on what is happening in far-flung
trading venues until it’s too late. Buying and selling stocks is
cheaper and faster, but it also can be much riskier.  “Do we really think of the SEC as in control of the
markets anymore?” said James Fanto, who teaches  securities law 
at Brooklyn Law School.  Traditional Exchanges  Fanto said that when the traditional exchanges dominated
trading, the SEC gave at least the appearance of having
consistent oversight. That’s no longer the case, he said.  “It’s partly that they don’t have the resources and can’t
attract the people who could follow all this. It’s hard to do. I
think it just adds to the sense that they don’t know entirely
what’s going on either,” he said.  Arthur Levitt , a former SEC chairman, said the trading
system “needs greater transparency, and in the past few years,
it has become less transparent than ever.”  Now an adviser to  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  and Getco LLC, a
Chicago-based automated trading firm, as well a Bloomberg LP
board member, Levitt said the SEC and the Commodity  Futures
Trading (RTSIX)  Commission should set up an official review of
technology and market structure to show the public “what the
risks are in a clearer way.”  2010 Disruption  The biggest trading disruption came in May 2010, when a 20-
minute plunge in stock prices temporarily erased some $862
billion of market value. A report by the SEC and the CFTC pinned
the decline partly on an algorithm employed by one firm trading
 stock futures .  The SEC has opened an inquiry into the Knight incident.  Regulators say that Knight’s problems haven’t disrupted the
financial system. They were triggered by what Chief Executive
Officer Thomas Joyce called “a bug, but a large bug” in
software as the company, one of the largest U.S. market makers,
prepared to trade with an NYSE program catering to individual
investors.  “Technology breaks,” Joyce said in an interview from
Jersey City, New Jersey-based Knight on Bloomberg Television’s
“Market Makers” program with  Erik Schatzker  and  Stephanie Ruhle  yesterday. “It ain’t good. We don’t look forward to it.”  Dark Pools  The SEC has moved under Schapiro to get a better handle on
the changes to the markets. In January 2010, before the so-
called flash crash, the agency issued a paper seeking comments
on a wide range of issues, including high frequency trading and
dark pools, markets that don’t display price quotations.  It also implemented circuit breakers for individual stocks
and approved regulations laying out the rules for breaking
erroneous trades in late 2010. At least five stocks were halted
on the NYSE during the first 35 minutes of trading Aug. 1,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Still, dozens of stocks
swung more than 10 percent.  In June, the agency said it approved two plans to lessen
the chances of sudden market swings. One system, known as limit-
up/limit-down, prevents trades at prices outside a specified
range. The other plan made it easier to trip the market-wide
circuit breakers, introduced after the 1987 crash, that are
designed to halt trading during routs.  Those rules don’t go into effect until February 2013.  Monitoring Activity  The agency also passed a rule in July requiring exchanges
to build a system to monitor and analyze trading activity. Known
as a consolidated audit trail, it will enable examiners to
reconstruct market crises and expedite surveillance.  Levitt was among critics who said the system should capture
data in real time -- rather than after the fact -- so regulators
could potentially catch disruptions before they run out of
control.  Representative  Barney Frank , the top Democrat on the
Financial Services committee, said that the SEC and CFTC need
more funding to do their jobs.  “Technology advances, things get more complex,” Frank, of
Massachusetts, said on Bloomberg Television. The agencies have
“to hire very smart people, they’ve got to have first-rate
 information technology .”  Representative  Scott Garrett , a New Jersey Republican who
is chairman of the Financial Services subcommittee that oversees
 capital markets , said he planned to wait for regulators to fully
understand what occurred before making judgments about hearings
or legislation. Knight’s Joyce testified before Garrett’s panel
in June.  Fail-Safe System  “My reaction is to see what the SEC comes up with,”
Garrett said, noting that the committee had a hearing on the May
2010 event before regulators had completed their review and it
yielded little usable information. Still, Garrett added, “I
don’t know that you can come up with a fail-safe system.”  Joyce, in his testimony in June, touted Knight Capital’s
technology and data centers that “are some of the largest and
most reliable in the industry.”  “Knight has spent the last 17 years evolving our
technology infrastructure so that it can process millions of
trades a day on behalf of the retail investor -- in a fast,
reliable, cost effective manner -- while providing superior
execution quality and service,” Joyce said in his remarks.  James Angel, a professor at  Georgetown University ’s
business school in Washington who serves on the board of
exchange operator Direct Edge Holdings LLC, said Knight’s
trouble “underscores that the commission cannot declare victory
and go home” just because they have some new rules in the
offing.  Bolster Resources  More to the point, said Angel, the SEC needs to bolster its
“human and technological resources” so it can better
understand what is happening.  “They need to hire people with technology backgrounds and
they need to hire people with trading backgrounds; they need to
hire plumbers,” he added. “Until the SEC has enough plumbers
to really understand the market structure, they are going to
continue to be a day late and a billion dollars short.”  For Related News and Information:  To contact the reporters on this story:
