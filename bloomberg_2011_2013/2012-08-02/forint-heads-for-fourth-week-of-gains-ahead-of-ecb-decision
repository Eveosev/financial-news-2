The Hungarian forint headed for its
fourth week of gains before a European Central Bank policy
announcement on rates today.  The forint strengthened 0.2 percent this week and traded
less than 0.1 percent stronger at 280.28 per euro by 10:16 a.m.  ECB President  Mario Draghi  will speak at a press conference
in Frankfurt at 2:30 p.m., after policy makers decide on the
benchmark  interest rate  for the euro area. ECB officials will
keep the rate at a record low 0.75 percent, according to 51 of
55 economists in a Bloomberg News survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
