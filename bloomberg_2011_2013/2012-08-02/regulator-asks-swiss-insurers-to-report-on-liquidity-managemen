The  Swiss financial regulator  wants
insurers including  Zurich Insurance Group AG (ZURN)  and  Swiss Re (SREN)  Ltd.
to report on liquidity management practices to better understand
their capital strength.  Insurers are required to give a “structured” report of
their liquidity risks by the end of April 2013, the regulator
said in a  circular  on its website today. The reforms follow
recommendations of the International Association of Insurance
Supervisors, Finma said.  Switzerland  introduced new solvency regulations for
insurers in January last year to align insurers’ risks with the
capital they hold. Insurers in the European Union will be faced
with similar regulation from January 2014 .  “Alongside  capital management , liquidity management
provides a holistic view of capital strength and is a central
element of financial corporate governance,” the regulator said.
“It means the ability of a company to meet due payment
obligations in full and in time.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
