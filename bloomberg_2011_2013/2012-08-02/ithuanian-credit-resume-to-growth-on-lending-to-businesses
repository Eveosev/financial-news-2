Lithuanian credit portfolios returned
to growth in the second quarter, after shrinking in the previous
six months, as lending to businesses increased.  Credit grew 1 percent, or 0.5 billion litai ($180 million),
in the April-June period from the first quarter, the  central
bank  in the Lithuanian capital, Vilnius, said in a statement on
its website today. Lending grew 0.4 percent through the first
six months of this year, it said.  Lithuania’s banking system, which is majority owned by
Swedish lenders such as SEB AB and  Swedbank AB (SWEDA) , is raising
lending in the Baltic region after suffering losses in 2009 when
the region suffered the world’s steepest recession. Increased
lending is adding momentum to the region’s economic growth,
helping outpace most of the rest of the European Union.  Lithuania’s banking industry’s profit fell 42 percent in
the first half from last year on provisions and shrinking
revenue from interest, the central bank said. Twelve of a total
of 16 Lithuanian banks reported profit this year, it said.  Bank deposits grew 3.8 percent in the second quarter from
the previous three months, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
