Wacker Neuson SE (WAC) , a German
manufacturer of construction equipment and machines, dropped the
most in more than eight months after reducing its earnings
forecast as the euro crisis discourages customers.  The shares fell as much as 7.2 percent to 10.90 euros, the
steepest intraday decline since November, and were trading down
4.5 percent at 4:58 p.m. in Frankfurt.  The margin for earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization to sales will be 13 percent to 15
percent this year, compared with a previous forecast of at least
15 percent, the company said in a statement today.
“Uncertainties across markets coupled with the euro crisis are
curbing investments among European customers,” Wacker Neuson
said.  Europe  accounted for 73 percent of sales in 2011.  “The company will not rally in the next six months,”
Dominik von Podewils, a London-based analyst at Berenberg Bank,
said in a phone interview today. “I expect a lot of downgrades
in the manufacturing industry in Europe for the second half of
2012.”  Wacker Neuson’s second-quarter Ebitda fell to 37.3 million
euros ($45.5 million) from 45.7 million euros a year earlier.
The Ebitda margin declined 4 percentage points to 13.1 percent.  In May, affiliate Wacker Neuson Linz GmbH moved to its new
facility in Horsching,  Austria , causing delays in compact
equipment deliveries in June and increasing process and
logistics expenses, according to the statement.  Wacker Neuson, based in Munich, reconfirmed its full-year
revenue forecast of about 1.1 billion euros.  --Robert Valpuesta, David Risser.  To contact the reporter on this story:
