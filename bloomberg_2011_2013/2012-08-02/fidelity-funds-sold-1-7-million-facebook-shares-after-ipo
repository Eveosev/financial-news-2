Fidelity Investments , an early
investor in  Facebook Inc. (FB) , disclosed that 19 of its stock funds
sold 1.7 million shares in June, the month that followed the
social-networking company’s botched initial public offering.  The biggest sellers included the  Fidelity Puritan Fund (FPURX) ,
which sold 623,800 shares, cutting its total stake to 1.85
million, according to Fidelity data compiled by Chicago-based
 Morningstar Inc. (MORN)  Fidelity Disciplined Equity, managed by Keith
Quinton, sold 444,800 shares, leaving the fund with a total of
493,371 Facebook shares at the end of June.  Facebook and some existing stockholders raised $16 billion
through the IPO, a record for a technology company, after
increasing the number of shares offered by 25 percent and
boosting the price to $38 each. The IPO was plagued by trading
errors and the stock has since lost almost half its value,
closing  today  at $20.04 in  New York .  Stephen Austin, a spokesman for Boston-based Fidelity, said
that the firm’s portfolio managers make investment decisions
every day for what they believe are the best long-term interests
of each fund’s shareholders. Fidelity doesn’t comment on
individual holdings, Austin added.  Fidelity’s website discloses the holdings of its individual
mutual funds at the end of each month. The most recent data
available is for June. The Wall Street Journal reported
Fidelity’s sales of Facebook shares earlier today.  Danoff’s Fund  Last year, Fidelity said in regulatory filings that its
funds were buying stock in Facebook, whose shares traded at the
time on private markets such as SecondMarket Inc.  The $82 billion Fidelity  Contrafund (FCNTX) , run by William Danoff,
invested $74 million in Facebook Class B common stock during the
first quarter of 2011, according to a filing that May with the
Securities and Exchange Commission. The fund acquired 2.97
million Facebook shares for about $25 each, the filing showed.  Contrafund, Fidelity’s largest stock fund, held about 3.46
million Facebook shares as of March 31. By the end of May,
Contrafund’s stake had jumped to 13.44 million shares, according
to Morningstar. Danoff bought another 264,000 Facebook shares in
June, raising Contrafund’s total stake to 13.7 million shares.
By June 30, Contrafund held more Facebook shares than any other
single mutual fund included in Morningstar’s data.  Fidelity Independence, run by Robert Bertelson, added
200,000 shares to its holdings during June, while a pair of
Fidelity Index funds bought 1.33 million shares the same month.  According to Morningstar, 42 Fidelity stock funds held a
total of 31.4 million Facebook shares as of June 30. The
