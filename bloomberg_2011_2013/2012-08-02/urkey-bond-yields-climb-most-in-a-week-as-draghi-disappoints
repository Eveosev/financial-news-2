Turkish bond  yields  rose the most in
more than a week after the  European Central Bank  disappointed
investors seeking more definitive measures to contain the euro
region’s debt crisis. The lira gained against the euro.  Yields on benchmark two-year government debt climbed for
the first time in four days, increasing seven basis points, or
0.07 percentage point, to 7.67 percent, the biggest jump since
July 24, at the close in Istanbul. The lira appreciated 0.9
percent to 2.1916 per euro, the strongest since April 2011.  President  Mario Draghi  signaled today the ECB will join
forces with governments to buy sovereign bonds in sufficient
quantities to remove all doubts about the euro, with details to
be fleshed out in coming weeks. His comments come a week after
he pledged to do “whatever it takes” within the ECB’s mandate
to save the currency bloc. The European Union nations buys 37.1
percent of Turkish exports.  “The market clearly doesn’t like the uncertain scenario as
policy makers seem to be borrowing more and more time whilst
last week’s comments suggested that a ‘done deal’ could have
been presented today,” Matthew Rome, a trader at Newedge USA
LLC in  Chicago , said in an e-mailed note.  Draghi’s remarks last week were interpreted by most as a
signal the ECB will intervene in bond markets, forcing down
Spanish and Italian yields.  The euro initially climbed as much as 0.5 percent to
$1.2405 after Draghi’s comments before falling to as low as
$1.2174. The yield on  Italy ’s 10-year government bond rose 23
basis point to 6.129 percent and the yield on  Spain ’s 10-year
bond climbed 7 basis points to 6.716 percent. European and U.S.
stocks retreated.  To contact the reporters on this story:
