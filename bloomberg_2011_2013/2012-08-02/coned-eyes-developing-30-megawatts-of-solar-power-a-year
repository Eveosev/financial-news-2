Consolidated Edison Inc. (ED) , the largest
utility holder in  New York , expects to develop about 30
megawatts of solar projects a year, a company executive said.  Financing and good projects are now available for
investment, Mark Noyes, vice president of Valhalla, New York-
based Con Edison Development, said in an interview today.  The unit said this week that it bought two solar projects
in California totaling 92 megawatts from Chinese polysilicon
maker  GCL-Poly Energy Holdings Ltd. (3800)  for $266 million.  “Solar makes economic sense,” said Noyes. “Wind used to
make sense and possibly will make sense again in the future.”
Con Edison is also exploring development of tidal turbines and
power storage in the future.  The company finds about one opportunity for every 10
projects it evaluates and expects to get returns comparable the
rest of the industry of 14 percent to 20 percent on a levered
internal rate of return basis, Noyes said.  Regionally, Noyes expects to see  Rhode Island , Connecticut,
Texas, Colorado, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Arizona and North and South
Carolina as developing solar markets over the next year or two
as new policies are announced.  To contact the reporter on this story:
