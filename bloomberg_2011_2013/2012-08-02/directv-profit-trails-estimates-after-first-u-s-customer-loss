DirecTV (DTV) , the largest U.S. satellite-
television provider, reported second-quarter profit that trailed
analysts’ estimates after posting the company’s first net
decrease in U.S. subscribers.  Net income  rose 1.4 percent to $711 million, or $1.09 a
share, from $701 million, or 91 cents, a year earlier, the El
Segundo, California-based company said today in a statement.
Analysts had estimated $1.14 on average, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The company also said it bought back
$1.35 billion in stock last quarter.  Chief Executive Officer Mike White said earlier this year
that DirecTV was refocusing its strategy on customer retention,
rather than acquiring new subscribers. The company reported a
loss of 52,000 subscribers in the quarter, more than the 22,000
average of 14 analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. DirecTV
made gains in  Latin America , adding a record 645,000 users,
although average revenue per user declined 11 percent there.  “The metrics show clearly the implications of moving down
market in Latin America,” said  Paul Sweeney , an analyst at
Bloomberg Industries. “Net additions are up, while ARPU
declines.”  DirecTV shares fell 2.6 percent to $48.80 at the close in
New York. The stock has gained 14 percent this year.  Middle-Market Homes  DirecTV is expanding in Latin America by marketing less
expensive versions of its video product to middle-market
households. A weakening currency in  Brazil  also contributed to
the ARPU decline. DirecTV reported a $43 million pretax non-cash
loss associated with the revaluation of  U.S. dollar  denominated
liabilities.  The customer additions in Latin America were up from a gain
of 472,000 in the year-earlier quarter.  Total sales  increased 9.5 percent to $7.22 billion, in line
with the average estimate. U.S. average revenue per user rose
4.2 percent to $94.40, compared with an estimate of $93.93.  The increase in U.S. ARPU is a validation of DirecTV’s
strategy of focusing on selling current customers more services,
rather than acquiring new users with discounts and promotions,
said  Vijay Jayant , an analyst at ISI Group in New York.  DirecTV is cutting the price of its Sunday Ticket football
package by about 40 percent for existing customers this season
to entice more signups. Current customers can buy access to all
Sunday NFL games for $199.95, down from about $325.  Viacom Deal  Last month, DirecTV forged a new deal to broadcast  Viacom
Inc. (VIAB)  programs on its service, following a 10-day blackout that
prevented customers from seeing  MTV ,  Comedy Central , Nickelodeon
and other networks. The two sides had sparred over Viacom’s
demand for higher programming fees, which DirecTV said were
excessive.  DirecTV will have higher third-quarter churn than a year
ago because of the Viacom dispute, White said on a conference
call today, although he said he still expects churn for all of
2012 to be the same or lower than 2011.  DirecTV is paying Viacom more than $600 million a year 
for seven years following the July 20 deal, according to a
person with direct knowledge of the matter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
