Following is the text of the
quarterly business employment dynamics report from the Bureau of
Labor Statistics.  BUSINESS EMPLOYMENT DYNAMICS:  FOURTH QUARTER 2011  From September to December 2011 gross job gains from opening and
expanding private sector establishments were 6.9 million, a
decrease of 204,000 from the previous quarter, the  U.S. Bureau
of Labor Statistics  reported today. Over this period, gross job
losses from closing and contracting private sector
establishments were 6.5 million, an increase of 181,000 from the
previous quarter.  The difference between the number of gross job gains and the
number of gross job losses yielded a net employment change of
368,000 jobs in the private sector during the fourth quarter of
2011.  The change in the number of jobs over time is the net result of
increases and decreases in employment that occur at all
businesses in the economy. Business Employment Dynamics (BED)
statistics track these changes in employment at private business
units from the third month of one quarter to the third month of
the next. Gross job gains are the sum of increases in employment
from expansions at existing units and the addition of new jobs
at opening units. Gross job losses are the result of
contractions in employment at existing units and the loss of
jobs at closing units. The difference between the number of
gross job gains and the number of gross job losses is the net
change in employment.  The BED data series include gross job gains and gross job losses
at the establishment level by industry subsector and for the 50
states, the  District of Columbia , Puerto Rico, and the Virgin
Islands, as well as gross job gains and gross job losses at the
firm level by employer size class.  Gross job gains at expanding establishments totaled 5.5 million
in fourth quarter 2011, a decrease of 203,000 from the previous
quarter.  Opening establishments accounted for 1.3 million jobs gained in
fourth quarter 2011, essentially unchanged from the previous
quarter.  Contracting establishments lost 5.2 million jobs in fourth
quarter 2011. This is an increase of 52,000 from the prior
quarter.  In fourth quarter 2011, closing establishments lost 1.3 million
jobs, an increase of 129,000 from the previous quarter.  Gross job gains represented 6.3 percent of private sector
employment in fourth quarter 2011, while gross job losses
represented 6.0 percent of private sector employment  In fourth quarter 2011, the number of establishment births (a
subset of the openings data, see the Technical Note for more
information) rose by 6,000 to 197,000. These new establishments
accounted for 778,000 jobs, an increase of 15,000 from the
previous quarter.  Data for establishment deaths (a subset of the closings data)
are available through first quarter 2011, when 613,000 jobs were
lost at 185,000 establishments. These figures represent a
decrease from the prior quarter when 691,000 jobs were lost at
186,000 establishments.  During fourth quarter 2011, gross job losses exceeded gross job
gains in the construction, information, leisure and hospitality,
and other services sectors. The  construction industry 
experienced a net employment loss of 33,000 jobs after two
consecutive quarters of positive net growth. Professional and
business services, which include temporary help services,
accounted for 25 percent of the total private sector net job
change in the fourth quarter of 2011.  Gross job gains declined in all three major firm size classes
compared to the previous quarter. Firms with 1-49 employees
experienced the largest drop in gross job gains. Firms with 250
or more employees accounted for 85 percent of the total net
change in employment for the quarter.  In the fourth quarter of 2011, gross job gains exceeded gross
job losses in 41 states, the District of Columbia, and  Puerto
Rico .  California had the largest net employment gain of 79,832
jobs, followed by Texas with 65,886 jobs.  Arizona ,  Missouri ,
 North Carolina ,  South Dakota ,  West Virginia , and Puerto Rico had
both a rate of gross job gains at or above the U.S average of
6.3 percent, and a rate of gross job losses that was the same or
below the national average of 6.0 percent.  More Information Additional information on gross job gains and
