Pacific Basin Shipping Ltd. (2343) , Hong
Kong’s biggest dry-bulk ship operator, plans to sell a terminal
in  China  and its vehicle-carrying ships to focus on delivering
commodities after posting a $196 million first-half net loss.  The sales will allow Pacific Basin to “focus all our
attention and all our investment on the dry cargo business,”
Mats Henrik Berglund, who took over as chief executive officer
in June, said in an interview today in Hong Kong. The interim
loss was the first since its 2004 initial public offering.  The company plans to sell all six of its RoRo, or roll-on,
roll-off, vehicle-carrying ships eventually as part of a plan to
stem losses caused by a global glut in vessels, said Berglund.
Pacific Basin wrote down $190 million against its investment in
the vessels during the first half.  The company will sell its first RoRo “as soon as
possible,” and will divest the terminal in China as early as
this year, Berglund said.  Pacific Basin  owns and operates  a general cargo terminal in
Nanjing, Jiangsu province in a joint venture with the Nanjing
Port Group.  The company’s dry bulk ships, which haul commodities
including logs, nickel and copper, posted profit of $7.5 million
in the period.  To contact the reporters on this story:
