Hong Kong’s Air Pollution Index was
“severe” at the city’s Central roadside-monitoring station and
“very high” in both Causeway Bay and  Mong Kok , the
Environmental Protection Department said on its website today.  The index was 212 in Central business district, 200 in Mong
Kok and 182 in Causeway Bay as of 7 a.m. local
time, the department said. Roadside pollution of more than 100
triggers a government warning for people with heart or
respiratory illnesses to avoid prolonged stays in heavy-traffic
areas.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
