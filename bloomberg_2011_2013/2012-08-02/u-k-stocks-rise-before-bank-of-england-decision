U.K. stocks  declined, led by a
selloff in financial and mining companies, after European
Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  damped speculation he would
take immediate steps to support the economy.  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS)  and  Aviva Plc (AV/)  led banks
and insurers lower, both tumbling more than 4 percent.
 Antofagasta Plc (ANTO)  and Kazakhmys Plc also lost more than 4 percent
as copper retreated in London.  The benchmark FTSE 100 Index slid 50.52 points, or 0.9
percent, to 5,662.3 at the close in London after earlier rising
as much 0.9 percent. The broader FTSE All-Share Index also slid
0.9 percent, while Ireland’s ISEQ Index added 0.2 percent.  Stocks rallied on July 26 after Draghi told an audience in
London that he would do anything to protect the euro. Today, he
said that policy makers may undertake open-market operations and
that high yields are unacceptable.  “It’s not Draghi’s comment, but the lack of action” that
has hurt markets, said  James Ferguson , chief strategist at
Westhouse Securities Ltd. in London. “Talk is cheap. Draghi
fully understands what the issues are. He says all the right
things, but he still has got to get everyone else on board.”  Draghi signaled that the ECB intends to join forces with
governments to buy bonds in sufficient quantities to ease the
region’s debt crisis, but did not give details on how such a
program would work. He also that Germany’s Bundesbank had
reservations about the plan.  Bond Buying  The  Bank of England  earlier today left its existing bond-
buying program unchanged at 375 billion pounds ($581 billion) as
forecast by economists. The Monetary Policy Committee also held
its  key interest rate  at a record low of 0.5 percent.  RBS, which will report its earnings tomorrow, tumbled 5.1
percent to 204.5 pence.  Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY)  retreated 4.3
percent to 29.39 pence, while  Barclays Plc (BARC)  declined 3.6 percent
to 162.3 pence.  Aviva slid 4.7 percent to 285.2 pence, leading a gauge of
British insurers lower.  Prudential Plc (PRU) , the  U.K.’s biggest
insurance company by market value , sank 3.6 percent to 746 pence
and  Legal & General Group Plc (LGEN)  lost 2.2 percent to 126.6 pence.  Mining shares fell as base metals slipped on the London
Metal Exchange. Antofagasta lost 5.2 percent to 1,041 pence,
Kazakhmys Plc retreated 4.5 percent to 679 pence and Xstrata Plc
dropped 1.7 percent to 846.7 pence.  BAE Systems  BAE Systems Plc (BA/)  lost 1.1 percent to 309 pence as Europe’s
largest defense company reported a 9.8 percent drop in  first-
half sales  to 8.3 billion pounds, missing the  median analyst
estimate  of 9.1 billion pounds. The company also said the U.S.
may further reduce its  defense budget .  Smith & Nephew Plc (SN/)  posted the biggest gain on the FTSE 100,
climbing 2.4 percent to 675 pence. Europe’s largest maker of
artificial hips and knees raised its  interim dividend  50 percent
to 9.9 cents and said it plans to increase the payout in line
with earnings growth.  The company also reported second-quarter trading profit,
which excludes some costs, of $234 million, in line with the
average analyst estimate compiled by Bloomberg.  Schroders Plc (SDR)  gained 0.8 percent to 1,302 pence. The shares
rallied as much as 4.6 percent after the  fund manager  reported
net inflows of 2.7 billion pounds for the first half. Analysts
had predicted the company would report outflows.  Trinity Mirror Plc surged 19 percent to 37 pence for its
biggest rally in two years. The publisher of the  Daily Mirror 
and Sunday Mirror said that job cuts and falling prices for
newsprint will help its business this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
