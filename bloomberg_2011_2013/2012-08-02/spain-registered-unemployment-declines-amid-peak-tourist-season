Spanish  registered unemployment  fell
in July as the country’s peak tourism season was in full swing.  The number of people registering for jobless benefits
declined by 27,814 from June to 4.59 million, according to data
released today by the  Labor Ministry  in  Madrid . That compares
with a 42,059 drop last year.  Tourism is one of the biggest contributors to the euro
area’s fourth-largest economy. Its second recession since 2009
worsened in the second quarter, pushing the European Union’s
highest unemployment rate to 24.6 percent, a record in the
country’s 36 years of democratic history.  To contact the reporter on this story:
