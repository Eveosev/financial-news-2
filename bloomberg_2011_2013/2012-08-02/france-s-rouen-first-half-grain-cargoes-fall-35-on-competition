Grain shipments from the port of
Rouen, Europe’s largest cereal export hub, slumped 35 percent in
the first half from a year earlier on competition from the  Black
Sea region  and  South America .  The port on the Seine River, downstream of Paris, reported
grain shipments fell to 2.6 million metric tons from 3.98
million tons in the first half of 2011, according to an e-mailed
statement today.  The volume of grain handled by the port in the crop year
from July 1, 2011 through to June 30 fell 26 percent to 6.14
million tons, according to the report.  “Most of this decline is explained by the expected
reduction in outbound cereal shipments, linked in particular to
the return to market from the start of the 2012-13 season of the
Black Sea countries and the strong competitive position of South
American grains, as well as those from  North America  and
 Australia  in this first half,” the port wrote.  Total maritime cargo volume for the Seine River ports of Le
Havre, Rouen and Paris fell 7 percent to 42.7 million tons, as
increased container shipping failed to make up for a slide in
bulk products, the port reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
