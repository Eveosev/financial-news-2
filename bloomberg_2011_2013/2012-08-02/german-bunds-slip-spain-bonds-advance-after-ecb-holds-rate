German 10-year bunds fell after the
 European Central Bank  kept its main interest-rate unchanged amid
speculation President  Mario Draghi  will announce measures to
ease the region’s debt crisis.  Spanish and Italian 10-year bonds stayed higher as the
ECB’s key rate was left at an all-time low of 0.75 percent, an
outcome predicted in a survey of economists by Bloomberg. Policy
makers have previously purchased more than 200 billion euros
($246 billion) of  government bonds  before it suspended its
Securities Markets Program this year. Draghi will hold a press
conference at 2:30 p.m. in  Frankfurt  to explain the decision.  “They’ve got their eyes on something bigger than a rate
cut,” Eric Wand, a fixed-income strategist at Lloyds Banking
Group Plc in London, said before the decision. “They need to do
some form of enhanced SMP plus a combination of other short-term
measures that they can enact, which will buy some time, but
within those there needs to be some promise that we’re heading
down the route to resolution.”  The German 10-year yield rose one basis point to 1.38
percent at 1:07 p.m.  London  time. The 1.75 percent bund due in
July 2022 fell 0.100, or 1 euro per 1,000-euro face amount, to
103.415. The rate fell to match its June 1 record low of 1.127
percent on July 23. Two-year note yields increased two basis
points to minus 0.051 percent.  Spain’s 10-year yield fell eight basis points to 6.66
percent, with  Italy ’s equivalent-maturity rate 11 basis points
lower at 5.82 percent.  Draghi Pledge  Draghi pledged last week to “do whatever it takes” within
the central bank’s mandate to preserve the euro, stoking
speculation policy makers will undertake measures including
intervening in bond markets to support the region’s economies.  German 10-year yields dropped seven basis points to 1.38
percent when the central bank cut its rate 25 basis points to
0.75 percent on July 5.  Spain  sold 3.13 billion euros of bonds, the Bank of Spain
said, compared with a maximum target of 3 billion euros.  The Treasury in  Madrid  sold its 10-year benchmark bond at
an average yield of 6.647 percent, compared with 6.43 percent
when it was last auctioned on July 5. Notes maturing in October
2016 had an average yield of 5.971 percent, compared with 5.536
percent last month and July 2014 securities yielded 4.774
percent.  German debt has returned 3.6 percent this year through
yesterday, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the
European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. Spanish
securities lost 4.7 percent, while Italy’s debt rose 8.1
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
