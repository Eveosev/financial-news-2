Peru ’s local government bond yields
held at a record low as the fastest-growing economy and most
stable currency in the region attracted investors looking for
relative safety.  The yield on the country’s 7.84 percent bonds due in 2020
was unchanged at 4.54 percent, matching the record low reached
on July 16 for a second day, according to prices from Citigroup
Inc.’s local unit. The sol depreciated 0.2 percent to 2.6290 per
 U.S. dollar , according to prices from Deutsche Bank AG’s local
unit.  Peruvian bond yields have fallen in line with yields on
U.S. Treasury bonds and other regional benchmarks such as
Brazil’s 8.5 percent real debt due in 2024, which fell to a
record low of 6.49 percent on July 27. The sol is the least
volatile major currency in Latin America and annual  inflation 
decelerated in July to the slowest in more than a year, reducing
the risk that investments in local bonds will depreciate.  “There’s a bit of a flight to quality,” said Bret Rosen,
a local markets strategist at  Standard Chartered  in New York.
“Economic growth is strong, inflation had been low and there is
so little volatility in the Peruvian sol that when investors are
looking for somewhere to allocate in Latin America, Peru has
very little  currency risk .”  Peru’s central bank didn’t intervene in the  currency market 
today, it said on its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
