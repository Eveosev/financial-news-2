New York City  illegally reduced the
pension benefits of police officers called to active military
duty in the years after the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks,
the  Manhattan  U.S. Attorney claimed.  Calculations by the police pension fund failed to account
for compensation the officers would have received if the
military hadn’t called them up for service, U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said in a statement after suing the fund, the city and
the police department.  “This lawsuit is to ensure that soldiers remain on the
same footing as their civilian counterparts and receive all the
benefits to which they are entitled, and that they are not
penalized for their service,” Bharara said in the statement.  The city’s calculations relied only on base pay and failed
to include overtime or pay differential for night shifts that
the officers might have earned, Bharara said. Beneficiaries of
the lawsuit would be current and former officers called to duty
after Sept. 11, 2001.  Georgia Pestana, chief of the labor and employment law
division of the city’s law department, said that by law
employees facing military call-up must be treated like any other
employee who goes on leave.  “We believe that the pension benefits we provide to police
officers who have served in the military meet that standard --
and would not want to discourage anyone from military service by
providing them with less than what they are entitled to,”
Pestana said in an e-mailed statement.  The case is Goodman v. City of  New York , 10-cv-5236, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
