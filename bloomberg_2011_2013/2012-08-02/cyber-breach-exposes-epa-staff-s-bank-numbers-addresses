Thousands of employees of the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency had their Social Security
numbers, bank-routing information and addresses exposed in a
cyber breach of an internal computer database.  The “security incident” took place in late March, and
affected 5,100 employees and 2,700 other people, the agency said
today in a statement.  An EPA analysis “indicates it is unlikely the personal-
financial information has been used,” according to the
statement. “The agency has already added new safeguards in
response to this incident.”  Cyber attacks on U.S. computer networks increased 17-fold
from 2009 through 2011 and there are reports that digital
adversaries have stolen $1 trillion of U.S. intellectual
property, U.S. Army General Keith Alexander, head of the
National  Security Agency (GSAG)  and U.S. Cyber Command, said at a
security conference last week in Aspen,  Colorado , according to a
video of the event.  To contact the reporter on this story:
