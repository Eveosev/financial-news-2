Tesla Motors Inc. (TSLA) , the electric-car
company led by  Elon Musk , said it has produced its first 50
Model S luxury sedans and will accelerate output on a weekly
basis to meet a target of delivering 5,000 this year.  Since starting production in Fremont, California, on June
22, Tesla has made 29 customer cars and 21 vehicles for its
stores for use as loaners and for test drives, Christina Ra, a
Tesla spokeswoman, said in an interview. Some 50 more are to be
built in the next two to three weeks, and the daily production
pace is to expand every two to three weeks after that, she said.  “The ramp up is continuing and we are getting a lot of
invaluable information from having all these cars on the road,”
George Blankenship, Tesla’s vice president of sales, said in a
company blog post yesterday. “We have already logged more than
39,000 miles on the first 50 cars.”  Production and orders of Tesla’s first battery-powered
model designed and built wholly in-house are being monitored by
investors after an analyst’s report last month suggested the
company may struggle to meet its annual target. Tesla said last
week that while it would produce just 500 of the Model S this
quarter, output would accelerate rapidly late in the year to
meet the 5,000-car goal.  Tesla has slid 19 percent since  Theodore O’Neill , an
analyst with Wunderlich Securities Inc., cut his rating for the
stock to sell from buy in a July 18 report, citing the
likelihood the carmaker would struggle to fulfill its 2012
target. The company named for inventor  Nikola Tesla  said last
week it has 12,200 orders for Model S, which starts at $57,400
before a U.S. tax credit.  Tesla, based in  Palo Alto , California, fell 0.6 percent to
$26.10 at the close in New York. The shares have fallen 8.6
percent this year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
