Indonesia’s rupiah and government
bonds declined for a second day after the  Federal Reserve 
refrained from taking action to spur growth in the world’s
largest economy, damping demand for emerging-market assets.  The  Jakarta Composite Index (JCI)  of shares dropped by the most
since July 23 after the Federal Open Market Committee said the
U.S. economy slowed in the first half and it would provide fresh
stimulus if necessary. The  European Central Bank  will meet in
Frankfurt today to discuss ways to tackle the region’s debt
crisis, after President  Mario Draghi  said last week that he
would do “whatever it takes” to preserve the euro.  “Markets are disappointed by the Fed meeting, causing
declines in regional currencies,” said Nurul Eti Nurbaeti, the
Jakarta-based head of treasury research at PT Bank Negara
Indonesia. “The moves will be limited as investors wait for the
outcome of the ECB meeting. Draghi pledged to do whatever it
takes, but he has few feasible options.”  The rupiah weakened 0.1 percent to 9,478 per dollar as of
3:37 p.m. in Jakarta, prices from local banks compiled by
Bloomberg show. One-month implied volatility, which measures
exchange-rate swings used to price options, held at 7.5 percent.  The yield on the benchmark 7 percent bonds due May 2022
climbed one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 5.72
percent, according to prices from the Inter Dealer Market
Association.  To contact the reporter on this story:
