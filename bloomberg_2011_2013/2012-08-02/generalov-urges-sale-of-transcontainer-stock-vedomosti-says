OAO Transcontainer (TRCN)  minority
shareholders appealed to Prime Minister  Dmitry Medvedev  to allow
more shares to be sold instead of being handed to a new
international logistics operator,  Vedomosti  said, citing the
shareholders’ letter to the premier.  Sergey Generalov, who is chairman of the  Far Eastern
Shipping Plc. (FESH)  representing minority shareholders of the London-
listed rail freight operator, said the transfer of
Transcontainer’s shares to the new transportation operator from
 Russia , Belarus and  Kazakhstan , as proposed by OAO Russian
Railways, would hamper Russia’s railway reform and private
investments in the industry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
