The U.K. Financial Services Authority
fined Turkish Bank (UK) Ltd. 294,000 pounds ($457,000) for
failing to establish proper controls preventing  money
laundering .  The company, a subsidiary of Northern Cyprus-based Turkish
Bank Ltd., didn’t have adequate policies to manage its
relationships with other banks, didn’t carry out due diligence
on those banks and failed to keep proper records, the FSA said
in a statement.  “Turkish Bank fell far short of the standards we expect of
firms in managing their money laundering risks,” said FSA
director of enforcement Tracey McDermott. “This was despite
clear warnings from the FSA that it needed to improve.”  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA)  had to apologize and set aside $700
million for fines after U.S. senators found failings in its
money-laundering controls gave terrorists and drug cartels
access to the U.S. financial system.  Turkish Bank would have had to pay 420,000 pounds had it
not cooperated and settled at an early stage, the FSA said. Ufuk
Gungor, assistant general manager at the Borough High Street
branch of Turkish Bank, declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
