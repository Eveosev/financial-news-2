Time Warner Cable Inc. (TWC) , the second-
largest U.S. cable-television provider, reported second-quarter
profit that beat analysts’ estimates after gaining broadband
Internet subscribers.  Net income rose to $452 million, or $1.43 a share, from
$420 million, or $1.24, a year earlier, the New York-based
company said today in a statement. Excluding one-time items,
earnings per share were $1.48. Analysts projected $1.38, the
average of estimates  compiled  by Bloomberg.  Time Warner Cable is successfully marketing its Internet
product as both a stand-alone service and in a bundle with cable
TV and phone. The company added 59,000 residential broadband
subscribers, while  AT&T Inc. (T)  lost 96,000 subscribers and  Verizon
Communications Inc. (VZ)  gained 2,000.  “Time Warner Cable results were solid, with better-than-
expected profitability as costs were kept in check, but slightly
weaker subscriber performance,”  James Ratcliffe , a New York-
based analyst at Barclays Capital Inc., said in a note to
clients.  Time Warner Cable shares  climbed  2.7 percent to $87.94 at
the close in  New York . The stock has risen 38 percent this year,
 ranking it second  among the 16 companies in the  S&P 500 Media
Index. (S5MEDA)   Time Warner Cable lost 169,000 residential video
subscribers, more than the 143,000 estimate of 14 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg, and added 45,000 phone customers. The
second quarter is seasonally weak for most cable companies as
college students cancel subscriptions for the summer vacation.  Sales Gain  Sales rose 9.3 percent to $5.4 billion, topping the average
estimate of $5.38 billion. This is the first quarter that
includes three months of revenue from Insight Communications
Co., an acquisition completed in February.  Chief Financial Officer Irene Esteves confirmed the company
was on pace to meet or exceed its full-year forecast on earnings
per share and free  cash flow  growth. Time Warner Cable expects
2012 earnings to be in the “upper range” of $5.25 to $5.50 a
share, she said on a conference call. Free cash flow will grow
between 20 percent and 25 percent, she said.  Time Warner Cable said 2012 programming costs per
subscriber would increase 6 percent to 7 percent, less than the
company’s previous forecast for 8 percent to 9 percent.  Time Warner Cable also repurchased $440 million of its own
shares last quarter, up from buybacks of $353 million in the
previous three months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
