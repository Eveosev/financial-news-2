Belgacom SA (BELG)  has found a buyer for the
Phone House Belgium stores it was asked to sell by the nation’s
antitrust regulator,  De Tijd reported , citing an unidentified
labor union official.  The unit made the announcement to its staff yesterday
without disclosing the name of the buyer, according to the

approval for the purchase on condition it would sell about half
the stores.  To contact the reporter on this story:
