Reduced shipments of Middle East oil
to  Asia  and an increase in the supply of the largest crude
carriers curbed earnings for shipowners on the benchmark route,
according to RS Platou Markets AS.  The number of cargoes available for loading in the Middle
East during July declined by about 20 from June, Platou said in
an e-mailed report today. Refineries in Asia undergo maintenance
during the summer period, according to Platou, the investment-
banking unit of  Norway ’s largest shipbroker. The very large
crude carrier fleet is set to expand 6.9 percent this year,
exceeding 4.7 percent demand growth, according to data from
Clarkson Plc, the world’s largest shipbroker.  “We believe the rate decline thus reflects slower
activity, reduced volumes, likely shorter distances and possibly
increased vessel supply as floating storage declined,” Frode Morkedal, an analyst at Platou, said in the report.  The number of VLCCs booked to haul  Middle East  crude slid
to an 18-month low of 113 in July, the lowest since January
2011, Kevin Sy, a Singapore-based freight-derivatives broker at
Marex Spectron Group, said by e-mail. He singled out a drop in
bookings to carry the region’s crude to  China  as the biggest
contributor.  VLCCs able to haul 2 million barrels of Middle East crude
to Asia made an average return of minus $3,209 in July, the
worst on record for figures going back to July 2008, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
