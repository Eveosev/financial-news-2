South Korea ’s won fell for the first
time in six days, retreating from a four-month high, after the
 Federal Reserve  refrained from committing itself to additional
stimulus at a policy meeting yesterday.  The  Federal Open Market Committee  said it will provide
additional accommodation as needed, without signaling imminent
plans for a third round of asset purchases. European Central
Bank policy makers meet today to discuss ways to tackle the
region’s debt crisis. South Korea’s foreign-exchange  reserves 
rose by $1.97 billion to $314.35 billion in July, a three-month
high, central bank figures showed today. The  Kospi (KOSPI)  Index fell
for a second day.  “The market was a mixture of disappointment from the Fed
and caution ahead of the ECB meeting,” said Han Sung Min, a
Seoul-based currency trader at Busan Bank. “We saw more
importers buying the dollar than exporters selling the greenback
as well.”  The won weakened 0.5 percent to 1,131.70 per dollar at the
close in  Seoul , after advancing 2.2 percent in the previous five
trading days, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
currency touched 1,125.20 yesterday, the strongest level since
April 3. One-month implied volatility, a measure of exchange-
rate swings used to price options, fell 30 basis points to 7.80
percent.  The yield on South Korea’s 3.25 percent notes due June 2015
dropped four basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 2.79
percent, Korea Exchange Inc. prices show. Three-year debt
futures rose 0.14 to 106.14 and the one-year interest-rate swap
declined one basis point to 2.82 percent.  “There was speculation that lots of receive offers from
overseas came in the interest-swap market,” which affected bond
yields, said Huh Kwan, a Seoul-based fixed-income trader at
Korea Investment & Securities Co.  To contact the reporter on this story:
