Michael Phelps  won the 200-meter
individual medley to extend his record for the most medals won
by an Olympic athlete to 20.  Phelps won in 1 minute, 54.27 seconds at the Aquatics
Centre in London. His U.S. teammate  Ryan Lochte  was second in
1:54.90, with Laszlo Cseh of  Hungary  third in 1:56.22.  It was the final matchup between the 27-year-old friends.
Lochte dethroned Phelps as the 400-meter individual medley
champion on the opening day in the pool on July 28. Phelps
finished fourth in that race, the first time he walked away from
an Olympic final without a medal since the 2000 Olympics in
Sydney. He won a record eight gold medals at the Beijing
Olympics four years ago.  “I said to him when we were in the ready room that this
was our last 200 of the meet, and the last 200 together,”
Phelps told reporters. “We were just kind of joking around kind
of laughing about it. Ryan’s probably been one of toughest
competitors I’ve ever swum against, all-round competitors.”  Lochte said the silver medal was “not the color I wanted”
and that he was finished swimming in  London , taking himself out
of contention for the U.S. 400-meter medley relay team Aug. 4.  “I’m done,” he said. “It’s my birthday tomorrow and for
the first time in years I don’t have to swim.”  Phelps’s Golds  Phelps now has 16 career gold medals, also a record. He is
retiring after the London Games.  Five minutes after receiving his latest gold medal in the
200 medley awards ceremony, Phelps won his semifinal in the 100-
meter butterfly. The final in that event tomorrow will be
Phelps’ last individual Olympic race.  Lochte finished third in the 200-meter backstroke about 30
minutes before the medley final today. Tyler Clary, 23, of the
U.S. won the gold medal in an Olympic-record 1:53.41, with
Ryosuke Irie, 22, of  Japan  second. Lochte led that race for the
first 150 meters.  On July 31, Phelps broke the mark of 18 total medals set by
former Soviet Union gymnast Larissa Latynina when he first took
silver in the 200-meter butterfly behind South African Chad Le
Clos, and then gold in the 800-meter freestyle relay with the
U.S. team. This is the fourth Olympics for Phelps.  Lochte had been the 1-3 favorite at U.K. bookmaker William
Hill Plc to win the 200-meter medley after he set the fastest
time in the semifinals. Phelps had been the second favorite at
5-2, meaning a $2 bet would return $5 and the original wager.  Take Turns  Phelps and Lochte took turns winning the event in recent
years. Phelps won in Athens and Beijing, while Lochte set a
world record at last year’s world championships in  Shanghai  in
1:54:00. At the U.S. trials in June, Phelps narrowly beat
Lochte.  Rebecca Soni, 25, of the U.S. won the women’s 200-meter
breaststroke gold medal in a world-record time today.  Soni finished in 2:19:59, ahead of Japan’s Satomi Suzuki in
second place and  Russia ’s Iuliia Efimova in third. Soni had set
the world record of 2:20.00 yesterday.  Ranomi Kromowidjojo of the Netherlands won the women’s 100-
meter freestyle, supported by hundreds of orange-clad Dutch fans
in the stands. It was the second gold medal for the Dutch team
after Marianne Vos won the cycling road race at the weekend.  Kromowidjojo, who had been in fourth place after the first
leg, won in an Olympic-record 53 seconds, taking 0.05 second off
her own mark set yesterday. Aliaksandra Herasimenia of  Belarus 
finished second, while Yi Tang of  China  claimed bronze.  To contact the reporters on this story:
