Chile’s peso slid after European
Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  said  Germany  has
reservations about a bond-buying plan to contain the region’s
sovereign-debt crisis.  The peso depreciated 0.2 percent to 484.35 pesos per  U.S.
dollar  at the close in Santigago.  Draghi acknowledged concern among members of Germany’s
Bundesbank over the bond-buying plan, indicating the 23-member
ECB governing council has yet to reach an agreement. Global
stocks fell and copper, Chile’s principal export, declined to
the lowest in more than a month after Draghi’s comments, which
didn’t include an announcement about immediate measures to boost
growth in the euro region.  “It left the market wanting more,” said   a trader at
Bice Inversiones in Santiago. “What Draghi said didn’t meet
expectations, and that has hit everything and strengthened the
dollar.”  International investors in the Chilean peso forwards market
cut bets against the peso on July 31 to $8.4 billion, the lowest
since May 14, according to data published today by the central
bank.  To contact the reporter on this story:
