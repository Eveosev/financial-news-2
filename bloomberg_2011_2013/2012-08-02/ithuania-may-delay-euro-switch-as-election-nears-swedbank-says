Lithuania  may delay its euro-adoption
goal beyond 2014 because the currency area’s debt crisis is
worsening and its government lacks “political determination”
before a parliamentary ballot,  Swedbank AB (SWEDA)  said.  The Baltic nation may be wary of providing aid to ailing
euro-region members such as Greece, Swedbank economists Nerijus
Maciulis and Lija Strasuna said today in an e-mailed report.
While it has a good chance of meeting entry criteria by next
April, neighboring Latvia has stronger political resolve to
adopt the currency the following year, they wrote.  “There seems to be a more unanimous agreement to meet
Maastricht criteria for the sake of stability, but not
necessarily in order to adopt the euro immediately” in
Lithuania, Swedbank said. “There’s a probability Lithuania
won’t apply formally for euro adoption in 2014 -– much of this
will depend on election results in October, as well as the euro
area’s progress toward a sustainable solution.”  Lithuania and  Latvia  are next in line to join the 17-nation
euro area, while other eastern European nations such as  Poland 
and the Czech Republic slow preparations as the debt crisis
deepens. In 2006, Lithuania became the only nation rejected for
euro adoption after it missed an inflation target by 0.1
percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
