The pound may weaken more than 3
percent to a two-year low against the dollar after it failed to
strengthen above a key level of so-called resistance,
Commerzbank AG said, citing trading patterns.  Sterling’s inability to break through its 200-day moving
average means it is poised to decline over the next one to three
months, Karen Jones , head of fixed-income, commodity and
currency technical analysis, wrote today in a note to clients.
The U.K. currency may fall as low as $1.50, she said.  Repeated failure at the 200-day moving average “finally
took its toll and the market has sold off,” London-based Jones
wrote. So-called Fibonacci analysis also signaled the pound was
poised to decline, she said.  The U.K. currency was little changed at $1.5551 as of
11:18 a.m. in  London . The last time the pound declined below
$1.50 was in July 2010.  Sterling may find so-called support at $1.5458, which
represents a short-term uptrend drawn from its June 1 low of
$1.5269, Jones wrote. The currency may also find support at its
July low of $1.5393, she said.  Support refers to an area on a price graph where analysts
anticipate orders to buy a security. The stronger the support,
the more selling is needed to drop below that level. Resistance
is where they may be sell orders.  Fibonacci analysis is based on the theory that prices rise
or fall by certain percentages after reaching a high or low.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to predict changes in a security,
currency or index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
