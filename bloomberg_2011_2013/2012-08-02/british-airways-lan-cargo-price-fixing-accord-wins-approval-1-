British Airways (IAG)  and Chilean carrier
 Lan Airlines SA (LAN)  were among the carriers to secure final court
approval for settlements totaling $207 million in a lawsuit
accusing them of fixing cargo-shipping prices.  U.S. District Judge John Gleeson in Brooklyn,  New York ,
today signed off on the deals. The carriers were among dozens
sued for allegedly fixing cargo prices by coordinating fuel
surcharges worldwide. The settlements resolve claims from
customers that used the airlines’ freight services from 2000
through 2006.  “I find the agreements to be fair, reasonable and adequate
to the class,” Gleeson said in his order.  British Airways agreed to pay $89.5 million while Santiago-
based Lan and Brazilian partner Aerolinhas Brasileiras SA will
pay a combined $66 million. Other carriers involved in the
settlement include Malaysia Airlines, South African Airways
Ltd., Saudi Arabian Airlines Ltd.,  Emirates Airline , El Al
Israel Airlines Ltd. and Air Canada.  Today’s approval marks the third wave of settlements in the
case, which have now reached a total of $485 million, according
to court documents. The civil settlements follow earlier
criminal investigations into the alleged air-cargo cartel by
authorities in the U.S., South Korea and Australia.  The case is In Re: Air Cargo Shipping Services Antitrust
Litigation, 06-md-1775, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of
New York (Brooklyn).  To contact the reporter on this story:
