MetLife Inc. (MET) , the largest U.S. life
insurer, said sales of some coverage have declined after the
company charged customers more to cushion the impact of lower
interest rates on the firm’s fixed-income holdings.  “We’ve been pricing pretty aggressively” in universal
life and variable annuity lines, said William Wheeler, president
of the Americas division at the New York-based company, in a
conference call today. “That’s had an effect on our sales
levels there but I think that’s made good sense to do.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
