TIAA-CREF, the manager of retirement
accounts for employees of nonprofit institutions, acquired a
majority stake in GreenWood Resources Inc. to expand its bet on
timber.  “Timber assets can serve as a source of portfolio
diversification and a potentially stronger hedge against
inflation as compared to publicly traded equities and fixed-
income investments,” TIAA-CREF said today in a statement
distributed by  Business Wire  that didn’t disclose terms.  To contact the reporter on this story:
