ABB Ltd. (ABBN) , the world’s largest maker
of power transformers, was awarded a $55 million order to supply
three substations and power lines in Brazil from local company
Eolicas do Sul that will connect wind farms to the electricity
grid.  ABB will install the substations in the southern state of
Rio Grande do Sul, the Zurich, Switzerland-based company said
today in a statement. Two 138-kilovolt transmission lines will
link to a 400 megawatt wind power project that’s expected to be
built by 2014.  To contact the reporter on this story:
