Kenya ’s shilling weakened for a
second day this week as the central bank mopped up liquidity,
tightening  money supply .  The currency of East Africa’s largest economy depreciated
0.4 percent to 84.30 per dollar by 5 p.m. in Nairobi, the
capital.  The Central Bank of Kenya has withdrawn 23 billion
shillings ($273 million) since July 27 via open market
operations, compared with 6 billion shillings from July 23 to
July 26, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The bank has
mopped up 78 billion shillings since June 6 through term auction
deposits alone, a newly-introduced liquidity management tool.  The longer-tenure term auction deposits “have enhanced the
open market operations and stabilized the interbank rate around
the central  bank rate ,” the monetary policy committee said in
an e-mailed statement July 5. The rate banks charge each other
for overnight lending is called the  interbank rate , while the
central bank rate is set by the MPC.  The bank today accepted all 2.1 billion shillings in bids
for seven-day  repurchase agreements  at a weighted average yield
of 10.467 percent, an official, who asked not to be identified
in line with policy, said.  The Tanzanian shilling gained less than 0.1 percent, the
first time in six days, to 1,585 per dollar. Uganda’s shilling
weakened 0.4 percent, the highest since June 15 on a closing
basis, to 2,490 per dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
