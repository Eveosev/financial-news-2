Former Egyptian President  Hosni Mubarak ’s sons, Gamaland Alaa, were ordered detained for 15
days pending investigations on charges they bought plots of
lands for much lower than the market price, state-run Middle
East  News Agency  reported today.  Alaa and Gamal, who was in line to become the country’s
next ruler before the 2011 uprising that toppled his father,
face charges of participating in profiteering, facilitating the
takeover of public funds and hurting those funds, the news
service said, citing the judge leading the investigation.  Former lawmaker Essam Sultan also accused former Prime
Minister Ahmed Shafik of selling Mubarak’s sons 40,238 square
meters (48,124 square yards) of land for 75 piasters ($0.12) a
meter when the actual price was at least 8 pounds, according to
MENA, which cited Sultan’s complaint. The transaction took place
in 1993, when Shafik headed the Association of Pilot Officers
that owned the land, the news service said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
