KKR & Co., TPG Capital and Silver
Lake are among the buyout firms that have initial interest in
making an investment in  Knight (KCG)  Capital Group Inc., according to
two people with knowledge of the matter.  The firms are taking a preliminary look at Knight and
chances of a deal are small since Knight’s future is uncertain,
said one of the people, who asked not to be named because the
process is private. Knight, seeking a deal to  survive  a $440
million trading loss, has already opened its books to suitors,
said two people with knowledge of the matter.  Bank of America Corp. also was among several potential
partners in talks with Knight yesterday, said another person
with knowledge of the matter. Knight is working with Sandler
O’Neill & Partners LP as an adviser on the rescue talks,
according to another.  Representatives at TPG, KKR and  Silver Lake  declined to
comment. John Yiannacopoulos, a Bank of America spokesman,
declined to comment.  Knight Capital  told brokers it obtained short-term
financing to fund market making, giving the firm money for
today, said a person with knowledge of the matter.  Jersey City , New Jersey-based Knight, one of the biggest
U.S. market makers, is exploring strategic and financial
alternatives after a software malfunction cost the company
almost four times  what it earned  last year. The firm’s shares
lost 75 percent in two days after its computers flooded the
market with unintended trades, sending dozens of stocks into
spasms.  To contact the reporter on this story:
