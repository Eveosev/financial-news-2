Visteon Corp. (VC) , the auto-parts maker
focusing on growing Asian operations, fell the most since
emerging from bankruptcy in 2010 after lowering its annual
forecasts for sales and profit.  Visteon fell 12 percent to $28.61 at the close in  New York ,
its biggest drop since leaving bankruptcy in September 2010. The
shares have plunged 43 percent this year after dropping 33
percent in 2011.  The company today lowered its annual forecasts, citing
currency and declining vehicle production in Europe and other
regions. Sales this year will be $6.6 billion to $6.8 billion,
compared with a May forecast of as much as $7 billion. The
average estimate of five analysts in a Bloomberg survey was for
2012 sales of $6.86 billion.  Visteon, since exiting bankruptcy, has been shedding lower-
margin revenue in vehicle interiors and lighting to focus on
faster-growing operations in Asia. Visteon’s $29.12 closing
price on July 24 was its previous post-bankruptcy low after its
efforts to buy the remaining 30 percent of  Halla Climate Control
Corp. (018880)  were blocked by South Korea’s biggest institutional
investor, the National Pension Service.  Visteon said it expects full-year adjusted earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of as much as
$620 million. In May, it forecast as much as $660 million.  The company, based in  Van Buren Township , Michigan, was
spun off from  Ford Motor Co. (F)  in 2000.  To contact the reporter on this story:
