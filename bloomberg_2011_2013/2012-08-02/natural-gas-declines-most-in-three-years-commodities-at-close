in  New York , led by natural gas.  The UBS Bloomberg CMCI index of 26 prices declined 1.4
percent to 1,529.01.  NATURAL GAS  Natural gas tumbled the most in almost three years after a
government report showed that U.S. stockpiles rose more than
expected last week.  The Energy Department said inventories rose 28 billion
cubic feet in the week ended July 27 to 3.217 trillion cubic
feet. Analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg predicted a gain
of 23 billion.  On the New York Mercantile Exchange, gas futures for
September delivery fell 7.9 percent, the biggest decline since

fuel shipments from the U.K.’s South Hook terminal stayed near a
three-month high. Day-ahead power fell.  Within-day gas dropped for a third day, by 1.5 percent to
51.7 pence a therm, according to broker data compiled by

therm. That’s equivalent to $8.43 per million British thermal
units. A therm is 100,000 Btu.  CRUDE OIL  Oil fell in New York after European Central Bank President

Mediterranean for the second day.  Three out of 10 consignments of Nigerian Qua Iboe crude for

climbed 1.3 percent to $2.8696 a gallon.  Heating-oil futures for September delivery fell 0.6 percent
