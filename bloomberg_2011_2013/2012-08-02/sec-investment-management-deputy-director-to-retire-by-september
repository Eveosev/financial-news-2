Robert E. Plaze, the deputy director
of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s Investment
Management Division, will retire at the end of the month, the
agency announced today.  Plaze recently oversaw rulemaking for money-market mutual
funds and directed implementation of a Dodd-Frank Act rule
requiring private fund advisers to register with the SEC, the
agency said in a statement. Since joining the division in 1983,
Plaze helped establish rules for investment advisers, investment
companies and private fund advisers, according to the
commission.  “Few people have had as great an impact shaping the
regulatory landscape for the benefit of individual investors,”
SEC Chairman  Mary Schapiro  said in the release. “Bob’s keen
intellect and passion for investor protection have been central
to virtually every significant rule affecting mutual funds and
investment advisers for more than a generation.”  Plaze’s departure comes as the SEC is considering rules
that would require the $2.5 trillion money-fund sector to float
share prices or hold more capital. The SEC’s five commissioners
have received a 337-page staff proposal for the rules, which
three of the commissioners are resisting despite pressure from
the  Federal Reserve  to increase regulation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
