The southeast of  Europe  remained hot
at the end of July, with maximum temperatures in the Balkans and
countries on the Black Sea at least 5 degrees Celsius (9 degrees
Fahrenheit) above normal, U.S. satellite data showed.  Temperatures climbed above 35 degrees in southern France,
Spain, parts of  Italy  and in  Romania , Bulgaria and the Balkan
countries in the July 21 to July 31 period,  U.S. Department of
Agriculture data  showed .  Rainfall across most of southern Europe was below the
seasonal normal, according to the data. Northern France got
between 25 percent and 50 percent more rain than usual, while
southern England had as much as double the usual precipitation.  Soil moisture is below 30 percent across southern Europe,
falling below 10 percent in most of  Spain , central and southern
Italy, Greece, Hungary and central Bulgaria, the data showed.  Moisture levels in all the main grain-growing regions of
Hungary, Romania and mainland Italy have dropped below the year-
earlier level, according to the USDA.  Cumulative rainfall in Franceâ€™s biggest wheat-growing
regions of Centre and Picardie is near the long-term average,
according to the USDA data. Across south and central England,
rainfall has been more than usual, the data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
