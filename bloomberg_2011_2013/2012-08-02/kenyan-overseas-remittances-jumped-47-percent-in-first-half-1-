Kenyan  remittances  from citizens
living abroad, one of the country’s largest sources of foreign
currency, increased 47 percent to $596.2 million in the first
half of the year, the country’s central bank said.  Remittances to East Africa’s largest economy climbed to
$99.5 million in June, up from $71.9 million a year earlier and
down from $101 million in May, the Nairobi-based Central Bank of
Kenya said today in a  statement  on its website.  Kenya relied on  North America  for 45 percent of its
remittances in June and  Europe  for 30 percent, it said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
