Ophir Energy Plc (OPHR) , a U.K. explorer in
Africa, fell the most in almost 10 months in London trading
after a Tanzanian well showed less natural gas than expected.  The shares  plunged 10 percent to close at 522 pence, the
biggest one-day decline since Oct. 4.  Ophir found 500 billion to 2 trillion cubic feet of gas
resources at the Papa-1 well, it said today in a statement. With
partner  BG Group Plc (BG/) , Ophir had targeted 3.1 trillion cubic feet
to justify developing a two-unit liquefied natural gas plant,
Chief Executive Officer Nick Cooper said in June.  “This is a relatively poor result,” Stuart Joyner, head
of oil and gas analysis at Investec Bank Plc, said in an e-
mailed report. He downgraded London-based Ophir to  hold  from buy
on July 31.  To contact the reporter on this story:
