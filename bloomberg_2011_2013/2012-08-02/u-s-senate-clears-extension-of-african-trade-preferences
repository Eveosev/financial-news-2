The  U.S. Senate  voted to extend trade
preferences for African countries and renew an import ban on
goods from Myanmar, formerly known as Burma, clearing the way
for the measure to go to President  Barack Obama  for his
signature.  The Senate voted unanimously to pass the bill, which
extends for three years provisions allowing duty-free treatment
of apparel assembled in the least-developed sub-Saharan
countries even if the clothing is made from yarn or fabric
produced in China, India or elsewhere. Twenty-seven countries
are eligible for the break.  The House passed an identical measure, H.R. 5986, by voice
vote earlier today.  Allowing the Africa trade preferences to expire could harm
$800 million in African exports, according to a June 2012
Brookings Institution  report . The bill also would add  South
Sudan , which became independent last year, to the list of
countries eligible for trade preferences.  In addition to renewing for one year the import ban that
the U.S. has imposed on Myanmar since 2003, the measure also
would amend U.S. laws to carry out a trade agreement with the
 Dominican Republic  and five Central American countries.  The vote came after the Senate rejected 40-58 an amendment
offered by Oklahoma Republican  Tom Coburn  that would have
changed the way the measure was financed. Coburn had delayed
action on the measure until yesterday when he secured a vote on
his amendment.  The Senate bill is S. 3326.  To contact the reporters on this story:
