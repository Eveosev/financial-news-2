OAO Transneft,  Russia ’s oil-pipeline
monopoly, said crude exports from the Pacific port of Kozmino
may be disrupted after OAO Russian Railways limited the number
of rail tankers it can send to the coast.  Fifteen trains loaded with oil are stuck after the rail
operator decreased transportation volumes allotted to Transneft,
creating “a threat to the ship-loading program and Russian
exports,” the pipeline company said today by e-mail.  Transneft is extending the East Siberia-Pacific Ocean
pipeline to Kozmino this year to expand exports to the U.S.,
 China  and elsewhere in the region. Oil is now supplied to the
 port  via rail from the link’s current end near the Chinese
border. Transneft plans to load 1.4 million metric tons, or
about 320,000 barrels a day, at the port from Aug. 1 to Sept. 1.  Russian Railways blamed a train station part-owned by
Transneft for the congestion, saying “the operators’ untimely
submission of transportation documents is the reason for the
higher than normal backlog of tanker cars.”  The route in question served an average of 10 trains, or
668 wagons, a day in July, Russian Railways said today in an e-
mailed statement.  “No measures have been taken” to fix the situation,
Russian Railways said.  Transneft preferred shares fell 1.9 percent, the most in a
week, to 51,027 rubles in Moscow, while the Micex Index declined
1.1 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
