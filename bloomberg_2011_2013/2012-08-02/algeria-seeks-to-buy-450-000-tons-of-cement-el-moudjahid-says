Algeria ’s Cement Group, known as
GICA, wants to buy 450,000 tons of cement to reduce demand it
faces in the domestic market, the El Moudjahid newspaper said.  The deadline for bids is Sept. 2, the state-run newspaper
said today, citing the company. The domestic cement shortage
amounted to more than 2.5 million tons, according to GICA’s
estimates. The company produces more than 18 million tons of
cement annually and aims to raise that to 20 million tons by
2016 and 29 million ton by 2018, according to the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
