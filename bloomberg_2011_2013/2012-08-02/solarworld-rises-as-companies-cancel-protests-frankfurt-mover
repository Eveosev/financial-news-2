Solarworld AG (SWV)  rose the most in more
than a week in Frankfurt trading after two Chinese competitors
canceled protests against an anti-dumping complaint in Europe
led by Germany’s biggest solar-panel maker.  Solarworld climbed as much as 7.1 percent, the steepest
intraday gain since July 24, after  Trina Solar Ltd. (TSL)  and  Yingli
Green Energy Holding Co. (YGE)  canceled plans by its workers to stage
the demonstration. It advanced 5.8 percent to 1.245 euros a
share as of 11:22 a.m., trimming its loss this year to 62
percent and giving the company a market value of 139.1 million
euros ($171 million).  Solarworld is leading a push by about 25 European
manufacturers for the European Commission to probe whether
Chinese rivals sold products at a loss on regional markets. The
U.S. has proposed anti-dumping duties ranging from 31 percent to
250 percent on Chinese solar manufacturers after the Commerce
Department in May ruled they sold products below costs.  Trina,  China ’s fourth-biggest solar-module maker, quashed
the protest on the advice of government officials, a
spokesperson said. The demonstration by 10,000 workers at Yingli
Green Energy’s five plants was canceled due to “weather
conditions at the Tianjin and Hainan plants,” Liang Tian, a
company spokesperson, said by phone today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
