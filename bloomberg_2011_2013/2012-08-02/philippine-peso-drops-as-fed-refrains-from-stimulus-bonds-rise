The Philippine peso fell for a second
day after the  Federal Reserve  refrained from taking steps to
spur U.S. growth, increasing concern the global economy will
weaken.  The  Federal Open Market Committee  said yesterday it will
provide additional policy accommodation as needed, without
signaling imminent plans for another round of asset purchases.
Philippine bonds gained after the central bank said yesterday
that the nation’s inflation outlook gives more room for policy
action, if needed. Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas cut its benchmark
rate last week to a record low of 3.75 percent from 4 percent.  “The result of the Fed meeting is definitely negative for
emerging-market currencies,” said Rafael Algarra, executive
vice president of financial markets at Security Bank Corp. in
 Manila . “No monetary loosening means there is a risk of a
further slowdown in growth. It’s not positive for risk
appetite.”  The peso weakened 0.2 percent to 41.853 per dollar at the
close in Manila, prices from Tullett Prebon Plc show. One-month
implied volatility, a measure of exchange-rate swings used to
price options, was unchanged at 6 percent.  The yield on the Philippine government’s 5.875 percent
bonds due January 2018 fell eight basis points to 4.60 percent,
according to Tradition Financial Services.  “The global outlook is likely to continue to remain
weak,” Governor  Amando Tetangco  said today. “Our next move
will be data-dependent, including any shifts in capital flows
and their impact on financial market prices.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
