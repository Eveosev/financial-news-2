Cerebos Pacific Ltd. (CER) , maker of the
Brands essence of chicken, surged the most in more than 22 years
after Suntory Beverage & Food Ltd. offered to delist the company
in a transaction worth S$364.8 million ($293 million).  Suntory, which has about 82.6 percent of Cerebos, yesterday
offered S$6.60 a share in cash for the remaining 55.3 million
shares it doesn’t own in the Singapore maker of food products
and health supplements. The price represents a 23 percent
premium to the last traded price of S$5.38 on July 30.  “The delisting and exit offer will allow the company to
realize cost savings by eliminating listing, compliance and
other related costs,” according to a joint statement yesterday.
As a non-listed company, “Cerebos will enjoy greater
operational flexibility and efficiency in implementing its
strategic initiatives.”  Cerebos jumped 22 percent to S$6.55, the biggest gain since
March 1990.  The company has a total of 317.3 million shares and
additional 2.5 million options granted to employees, according
to the statement to the Singapore exchange.  Before the bid yesterday, Cerebos has climbed 8.5 percent
this year, compared with the 15 percent advance in the Singapore
benchmark  Straits Times Index. (FSSTI)   To contact the reporter on this story:
