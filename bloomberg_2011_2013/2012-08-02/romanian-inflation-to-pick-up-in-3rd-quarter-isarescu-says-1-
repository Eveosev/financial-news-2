Romanian inflation will accelerate in
the third quarter, though it will remain within the central
bank’s target band, said central bank Governor Mugur Isarescu in
Bucharest today.  The country’s currency, the leu, declined on capital
outflows, in part because of political turmoil, he also said at
a conference to discuss monetary policy, which will remain
“prudent.”  Isarescu said that an easing of the country’s political
turmoil will help stem capital outflows and there are reasons to
cut the nation’s economic growth forecasts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
