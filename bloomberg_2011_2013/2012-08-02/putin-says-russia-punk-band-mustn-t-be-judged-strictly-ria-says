Russian President  Vladimir Putin  said
while he didn’t see “anything good” in the behavior of members
of the punk group Pussy Riot, they shouldn’t be judged “too
strictly,” state news service RIA Novosti reported today,
citing Putin.  Putin said he hopes that a court considering charges of
hooliganism and religious hatred against the three female band
members will be reasoned, the  news agency  said.  The women face seven years in jail for a protest act
against Putin in Moscow’s Christ the Savior cathedral.  To contact the reporter on this story:
