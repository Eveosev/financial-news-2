(Corrects attribution in fourth paragraph.)  Yapi & Kredi Bankasi AS (YKBNK) , the Turkish
bank owned by  UniCredit SpA (UCG)  of  Italy  and  Koc Holding AS (KCHOL) ,
reported a 20 percent fall in second-quarter profit, missing
estimates, as it set aside more money for bad loans.  Net income dropped to 352.4 million liras ($196 million)
from 441.8 million liras in the year-earlier period, Yapi Kredi
said in a statement today. The bank was expected to earn 411.7
million liras, according to the average prediction of 12
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Turkish banks’ provisions may increase this year because of
non-performing loans caused by a slowdown in the economy, Duygun Kutucu, an analyst at EFG Istanbul Securities, said in a
telephone interview on July 31. Turkey’s economic growth is
forecast to cool to 2.3 percent this year from 8.5 percent in
2011, the  International Monetary Fund  said in April.  Yapi Kredi’s general provisions rose to 150 million liras
from 18 million liras, Cagdas Dogan, analyst at BNP Paribas
Equity Research in Istanbul, said in a telephone interview
today. Net fees and commission income fell to 415.1 million
liras from 434.6 million liras. Losses from derivatives trading
more than doubled to 461.5 million liras.  The shares fell 0.8 percent to 3.66 liras at 5:16 p.m. in
Istanbul. The main ISE National 100 index lost 0.6 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
