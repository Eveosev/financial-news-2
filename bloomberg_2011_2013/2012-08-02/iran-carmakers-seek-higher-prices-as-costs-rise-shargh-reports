Iranian carmakers have requested
ministry officials to allow an increase in the prices of
locally-produced automobiles, citing higher costs,  Shargh 
reported, without citing anyone.  The issue was raised at a meeting this week of executives
in  Iran ’s automobile industry with the deputy minister of
industries, mines and commerce, the Tehran-based newspaper said.
Representatives of Iran Khodro and SAIPA, Iran’s two biggest
auto producers, were at the meeting, Shargh reported.  The delegation presented reasons behind a recent drop in
car production in the country and mentioned “liquidity
problems” at the manufacturers and their parts suppliers, the
newspaper said, without elaborating. In Iran, prices of locally
manufactured cars are regulated by the state.  To contact the reporter on this story:
