Negotiators for 45,000 airport
security screeners reached their first labor agreement with the
U.S., the  American Federation of Government Employees  said.  The accord reached early today with the  Transportation
Security Administration , which oversees screeners at 450 U.S.
airports, didn’t include wages, a provision banned when
collective bargaining was allowed. The union didn’t release any
details in the statement announcing the agreement. The workers
also are barred from striking, TSA chief  John Pistole  wrote last
year in a  memorandum  that set guidelines for negotiations.  The agreement ends a 10-year political fight over union
representation and gives TSA workers protections opposed by
President  George W. Bush . Successor  Barack Obama , a Democrat
backed by labor unions in his 2008 campaign, reversed Bush and
his administration last year cleared the way for the workers to
craft a contract, with the restrictions on what issues could be
bargained.  Republicans have pressed to cut the size and scope of the
agency, which has been criticized by Congress and watchdog
agencies for lax screening of employees, purchases of equipment
that didn’t work and confrontations with children, senior
citizens and elected officials at checkpoints.  In addition to parking and uniforms, the union has been
allowed to bargain over attendance, how workers trade shifts and
how they win promotion to full-time employment, according to
Pistole’s February 2011 decision.  To contact the reporter on this story:
