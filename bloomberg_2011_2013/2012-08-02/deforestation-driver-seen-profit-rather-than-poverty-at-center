Global deforestation is now spurred
mainly by industrial agriculture, rather than subsistence-level
farming, the Center for International Forestry Research said,
citing Rhett Butler, the founder of environmental-news website
Mongabay.com.  The shift toward profit and regional or international
markets as a driver, rather than poverty and local needs,
creates opportunities for conservation because some of the
companies involved are sensitive to environmental campaigns, the
center said in a  blog  on its website. Cattle ranching is one of
the biggest spurs for deforestation in the Amazon, it said.  “We know that the commercial drivers for deforestation are
now more important than some decades back,” Sven Wunder, a
Brazil-based scientist with the center, was cited as saying.  A Greenpeace campaign in 2009 that targeted buyers of
secondary products such as leather contributed to policy changes
in  Brazil , according to Butler. The Amazon is the world’s
largest rain forest.  To contact the reporter on this story:
