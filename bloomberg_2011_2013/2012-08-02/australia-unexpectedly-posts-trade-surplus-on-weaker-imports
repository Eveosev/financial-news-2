Australia  unexpectedly recorded a
trade surplus in June as fuel imports declined and shipments
abroad stagnated. The local currency rose as a separate report
showed stronger retail sales.  Exports outpaced imports by A$9 million ($9.42 million),
from a revised A$313 million deficit in May, the Bureau of
Statistics said in a report in Sydney today. The median estimate
in a Bloomberg News survey of 22 economists was for a deficit of
A$375 million. The April balance was revised to a A$20 million
surplus from previously reported deficit of A$26 million.  The Australian economy, which has avoided a recession for
two decades, is driven by iron ore and coal sales to meet demand
in developing nations from India to China. The  Reserve Bank  of
Australia kept its benchmark  interest rate  unchanged last month
after lowering it by 75 points in May and June to 3.5 percent to
help shore up demand amid risks to the global economic outlook.  “Weather disruptions have been a significant deterrent to
goods exports over the previous few months,” Michael Blythe,
chief economist in Sydney at  Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) ,
said in a research report before the release. “In June, the
 trade balance  looks to have improved. Imports have moved lower
in the month. Export values will be supported by continued
strength in volumes of iron ore and coal volumes.”  Exports were little changed at A$26.629 billion, today’s
report showed. Imports declined 2 percent to A$26.619 billion on
a 20 percent fall in fuel and lubricants, the report showed.  Retail Sales  The Australian dollar bought $1.0463 at 11:49 a.m. in
Sydney, from $1.0456 before the data were released. The retail
sales report showed a 1 percent increase in June, more than than
median economists forecast for a 0.7 percent gain.  Powering the Australian economy is the biggest resource
boom since prospectors set off a gold rush in the 1850s. The
latest bonanza -- for  iron ore , coal and natural gas -- is
bringing investment projects the government estimates to be
worth A$500 billion. The nation’s unemployment rate, at 5.2
percent in June, is lower than 8.2 percent in the U.S. and 11.2
percent in the euro area.  Prices for Australian commodities dropped in July to the
lowest level since 2010 as Europe’s debt crisis weighed on
demand for resources in  Asia .  The commodity price index slid to 95.8 last month from a
revised 98.1 in June, the  Reserve Bank of Australia  said in a
statement on its website yesterday. The index declined 10.8
percent in Australian dollar terms over the past year, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
