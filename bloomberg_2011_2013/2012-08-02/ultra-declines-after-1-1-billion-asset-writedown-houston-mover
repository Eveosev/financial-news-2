Ultra Petroleum Corp. (UPL) , the natural-
gas producer with properties in Wyoming and Pennsylvania,
plunged the most in more than three years after reporting a $1.1
billion writedown on the value of assets because of low gas
prices.  Ultra, based in Houston,  tumbled  9.6 percent to $21.47 at
the close in New York, the biggest drop since June 2009.  The company had a second-quarter net loss of $1.19 billion,
or $7.76 a share, compared with a profit of $103.5 million, or
67 cents, a year earlier, according to a statement today. Ultra
said it recorded the one-time charge on certain properties after
gas in the U.S. touched a 10-year low in 2012.  Investors also may be disappointed that a planned sale of
some midstream properties wasn’t announced, while results from
the Niobrara formation in the western U.S. may be some time off,
 Leo Mariani , an analyst a  RBC Capital Markets  in Austin,  Texas ,
said in a telephone interview. Mariani has a sector perform
rating on Ultra shares, meaning investors should hold them, and
doesn’t own any.  To contact the reporter on this story:
