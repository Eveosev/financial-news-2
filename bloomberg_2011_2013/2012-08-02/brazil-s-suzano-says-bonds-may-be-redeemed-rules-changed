Suzano Papel & Celulose SA (SUZB5) ,  Brazil ’s
second-largest pulp maker, may buy back 500 million reais ($244
million) in local bonds or seek a third waiver on covenants
after debt jumped to a 10-year high, Chief Financial Officer
Alberto Monteiro said. Shares dropped.  “Today I’d prefer to buy back the local bonds, but it
really depends on a negotiation with the holders,” he told
reporters today in Sao Paulo. “We may have difficulties to meet
the covenants.”  Rules stipulate that the notes may be redeemed if net debt
surpasses four times earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization at the end of this quarter and the
next, Monteiro said. Net debt was 5.7 times Ebitda in the second
quarter, the company said today.  Net debt jumped to a 10-year high of 6.85 billion reais in
the second-quarter, up 63 percent from a year ago, as the
 Salvador , Brazil-based company is stepping up investments to
more than double output of pulp.  Suzano has renegotiated covenants on the local bonds twice
since 2010, paying a penalty fee on both occasions, according to
a presentation on its website.  Suzano dropped 3.3 percent to 3.87 reais at 2:46 p.m. in
 Sao Paulo  and slid as much as 3.5 percent, the steepest intraday
decline since July 2. The Bovespa index declined 1.4 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
