AAA Auto Group NV (AAA) , a Czech used-car
dealership chain, said its seven-month vehicle sales rose 16
percent as clients took credit to purchase vehicles.  AAA sold 30,437 vehicles in the first seven month of 2012,
compared to 26,233 cars a year ago, the Prague-based company
said late yesterday in an e-mailed statement. Sales in July
increased 15 percent to 4,596 cars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
