Japan  stocks  rose after the U.S.
Federal Reserve’s pledge to provide additional support for the
world’s largest economy if needed boosted exporters.  Toyota
Motor Corp. (7203)  advanced after sales in the U.S. beat estimates.  Sony Corp. (6758) , Japan’s No. 1 exporter of consumer electronics,
climbed 2.4 percent after the yen fell from a two-month high
against the dollar. Toyota, Asia’s biggest carmaker, advanced
1.3 percent.  Tokyo Electric Power Co. (9501) , operator of the crippled
Fukushima nuclear plant, led utilities higher after its
quarterly loss narrowed from a year earlier.  Aozora Bank Ltd. (8304) ,
controlled by Cerberus Capital Management LP, surged 9 percent
after saying it’s close to a deal with stakeholders to repay
public funds.  The  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average rose 0.1 percent to 8,653.18
at the close of trading in  Tokyo . The broader Topix Index
climbed 0.4 percent to 732.98.  “There remains a significant risk that policy makers will
keep intervening to support economic confidence and financial
markets,” said Mikio Kumada, a Singapore-based global
strategist for LGT Capital Management, which oversees more than
$20 billion. “Overly bearish investors still risk being caught
wrong-footed in rising markets. A reasonably constructive
investment approach remains appropriate for now, with a slight
tilt in favor of selected risky assets.”  The Topix lost 16 percent since this year’s peak on March
27 amid slowing growth in the U.S. and  China , and concern
Europe’s debt crisis is spreading. Shares on the gauge trade at
0.9 times book value, compared with 2.2 times for the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index and 1.4 times for the Europe Stoxx 600 Index. A
number less than one means that companies can be bought for less
than value of their assets.  Earnings Season  About a half of the 199 companies on the Topix that have
reported  quarterly earnings  since the start of last month and
for which forecasts are available have missed expectations,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg News.  Futures on the  S&P 500  gained 0.2 percent today. The gauge
dropped 0.3 percent in  New York  yesterday as the Fed’s pledge to
provide additional support disappointed investors seeking a more
definitive sign of further easing as the economy slows. A report
released the same day showed manufacturing in the U.S. shrank a
second month in July.  The  European Central Bank  is scheduled to make a policy
announcement today, with President  Mario Draghi  pledging policy
makers will do whatever is needed to preserve the euro.  Exporters advanced as the yen retreated from a two-month
high of 77.91 per dollar yesterday. Sony gained 2.4 percent to
964 yen. The electronics maker cut its full-year profit forecast
after the close of market today.  Bridgestone Corp. (5108) , a tiremaker
that generates 42 percent of its sales in the Americas, climbed
2.9 percent to 1,818 yen.  Toyota Sales  Toyota advanced 1.3 percent to 3,045 yen as its U.S. auto
sales through July rose 28 percent to 1.21 million, ahead of its
15 percent full-year target.  Tokyo Electric Power jumped 10 percent to 141 yen after
posting a net loss of 288.4 billion yen ($3.7 billion) for the
quarter ended June 30, after a loss of 572 billion yen in the
year-earlier period. It also widened its annual loss projection
to 160 billion yen.  Aozora Bank gained 9 percent to 194 yen after saying it
will soon announce details about the repayment of public funds.
The lender is convening an extraordinary meeting of shareholders
to implement a payment plan.  Nihon Unisys Ltd. (8056)  advanced 5.7 percent to 573 yen after
reporting first-quarter operating profit of 904 million yen,
against expectations of a 529.5 million yen loss.  Teijin Ltd. slumped 9.2 percent to 207 yen after the fiber
maker cut its fiscal-year operating profit forecast 19 percent
after a 73 percent drop in the quarter ended June 30.  To contact the reporter on this story:
