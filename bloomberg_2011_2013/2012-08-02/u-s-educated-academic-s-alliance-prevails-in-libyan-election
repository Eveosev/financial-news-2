A Libyan political alliance led by a
U.S.-educated academic and former opposition leader won 39 out
of 80 seats reserved for political parties in the country’s new
national assembly, according to final election results.  The National Forces Alliance, a collection of about 60
political groups headed by Mahmoud Jibril, defeated other
parties in the country’s first free election since the removal
of Muammar Qaddafi, according to ratified results released early
today by the election commission in Tripoli.  The Muslim Brotherhood’s Justice and Construction party
came in second in the July 7 vote, winning 17 of the party-list
seats, according to the commission.  Libya ’s new National
Congress has a total of 200 seats; the remaining 120 seats are
reserved for individual candidates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
