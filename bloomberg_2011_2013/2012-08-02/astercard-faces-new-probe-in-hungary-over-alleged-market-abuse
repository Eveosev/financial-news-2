MasterCard Inc. (MA) , the world’s second-
biggest payments network, said Hungary’s competition authority
opened a new probe against the company for “alleged abuse of
dominant position” in the domestic bank-card market.  MasterCard was informed of the investigation in June, the
Purchase, New York-based company said in its quarterly report
published yesterday. The probe is focused on the period
beginning December 2010.  Hungary’s antitrust regulator fined MasterCard and Visa
Europe 477 million forint ($2 million) each in 2009, saying they
colluded with local banks on fees charged to credit-card
customers between 1996 and 2008. MasterCard, which has denied
any wrongdoing, appealed that decision.  “If the Hungarian Competition Authority’s decision is not
reversed on appeal, it could have a significant adverse impact
on the revenues of MasterCard’s Hungarian customers and on
MasterCard’s overall business in  Hungary ,” the firm said,
referring to the 2009 probe.  MasterCard paid the fine in the fourth quarter of 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
