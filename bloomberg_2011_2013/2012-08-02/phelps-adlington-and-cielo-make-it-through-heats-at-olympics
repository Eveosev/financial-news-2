Defending champions and world record
holders  Michael Phelps , Rebecca Adlington and Cesar Cielo
comfortably made it through their heats in the Olympic swimming
competition this morning.  Missy Franklin of the U.S. reached the semifinals of the
200-meter backstroke, winning her heat in 2:07.54. She’s already
won gold in the 100-meter event.  Phelps went from last place on the turn to finish winner of
the final heat and second overall to make tonight’s semifinals
of the 100-meter butterfly.  Briton Adlington, who set the world record in the 800-meter
freestyle in Beijing four years ago, qualified for tomorrow’s
final as the fastest finisher.  Brazil ’s Cielo trailed only
Trinidad and Tobago’s George Bovell in the 50-meter freestyle.
The semifinal takes place tonight.  Phelps, who won a record 19th Olympic medal when the U.S.
800-meter freestyle relay team took gold, clocked a time of
51.72 seconds, a time bettered by Chad le Clos’s 51.54. Le Clos
beat Phelps in the 200-meter butterfly two days ago.  Adlington, a home favorite, left the pool to huge cheers
after clocking 8 minutes, 21.78 seconds. Denmark’s Lotte Friis
was second-quickest in 8:21.89 and 15-year-old American Kate
Ledecky won her heat to finish third quickest overall in
8:23.84.  Cielo’s time this morning of 21.80 seconds was only 0.03
seconds short of Bovell’s. Cielo’s teammate Bruno Fratus was
third-quickest with 21.82.  The U.S.’s Anthony Ervin qualified fourth fastest and
another American swimmer Cullen Jones also made it into the
semifinals.  To contact the reporters on this story:
