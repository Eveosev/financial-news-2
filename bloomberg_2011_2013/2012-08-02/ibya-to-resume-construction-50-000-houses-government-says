Libya’s Ministry of Housing plans to
build 50,000 houses over the next six to 18 months, the
government said today.  The planned construction will honor a commitment to urban
housing interrupted by last year’s revolt against former
dictator  Muammar Qaddafi , government spokesman Nasser al Mannae
said at a weekly press briefing in Tripoli. He didn’t provide
additional details.  “Given the displacement and damage caused by last year’s
conflict, there is now a pressing need for a really
comprehensive nationwide survey to determine how many houses
need to be built and where,” said Beth Hepworth, Director of
Frontier MEA, a research and advisory firm that conducted real-
estate market feasibility studies in Libya since 2007 and has an
office in Tripoli.  There are 70,000 to 90,000 internally displaced persons in
Libya,  according to UNHCR. Ongoing instability is still forcing
people to leave some areas.  “This will go some way to alleviate the housing crisis
that is affecting  Libya , but our estimates are that more than
ten times that number are needed,” said Hatem Benfayed, head of
the Tripoli-based Libya Housing Authority.  To contact the reporter on this story:
