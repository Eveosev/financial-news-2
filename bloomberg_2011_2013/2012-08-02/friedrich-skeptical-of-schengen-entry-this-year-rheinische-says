Bulgaria  and Romania may not be ready
to join the Schengen passport-free travel zone this year, even
on a restricted basis for only air and sea ports,  Rheinische
Post  quoted German Interior Minister Hans-Peter Friedrich as
saying.  “I believe open borders for Romania and Bulgaria are
impossible at this point in time,” the newspaper cited
Friedrich as saying in an e-mailed preview of an article to be
published today.  Germany and  France  had earlier proposed a two-step plan of
opening the countries’ air and sea ports and postponing a
decision on overland borders, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
