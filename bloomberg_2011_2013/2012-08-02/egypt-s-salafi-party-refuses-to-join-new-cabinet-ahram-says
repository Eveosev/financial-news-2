Egypt’s Salafi al-Nour Party has
refused to join the new Cabinet, the state-run al-Ahram
newspaper reported.  Al-Nour rejected a proposal by Prime Minister-designate
Hisham Qandil to appoint party member Khaled Alim Eddin as
 environment minister  because the party was not consulted on the
Cabinet formation, al-Ahram said, citing senior party member
Younis Makhyoun.  The new Cabinet is expected to be sworn in today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
