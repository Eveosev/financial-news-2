The ruble slid for a second day as
oil fell and European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  failed
to reassure investors he was ready to take immediate steps to
support the economy.  The Russian currency depreciated 0.5 percent to 32.4950 per
dollar by the close in Moscow. The ruble gained 0.5 percent to
39.5825 per euro and was little changed at 35.7110 against the
central bank’s target dollar-euro basket.  Draghi signaled the ECB intends to join forces with
governments to buy bonds in sufficient quantities to ease the
region’s debt crisis, while conceding  Germany ’s Bundesbank has
reservations about the plan. His comments come a week after he
pledged to do “whatever it takes” within the ECB’s mandate to
save the currency bloc. Oil, Russia’s main export earner, fell
0.9 percent to $88.07 a barrel in  New York  to the lowest since
July 13.  “We are seeing the ruble weakening a little because risk
globally is off the table,”  Bruce Bower , a partner at Moscow-
based hedge fund Verno Capital, said by phone today before
Draghi’s comments.  Investors increased bets on the currency weakening, with
non-deliverable forwards showing the ruble at 33.0775 per dollar
in three months, compared with expectations of 33.0100 per
dollar yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
