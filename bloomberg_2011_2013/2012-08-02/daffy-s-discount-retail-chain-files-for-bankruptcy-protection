Daffy’s Inc., the 19-store chain
selling discount designer brands in the U.S. Northeast, filed
for bankruptcy court protection after saying it would shut down
because of weak consumer spending.  The Secaucus, New Jersey-based company listed assets of as
much as $100 million and debt of as much as $50 million in
Chapter 11 documents filed yesterday in  U.S. Bankruptcy Court  in
Manhattan. Daffy’s said July 16 in an e-mailed statement that it
would close stores and liquidate merchandise during the next few
months.  Daffy’s joins  Syms Corp. (SYMSQ)  and its Filene’s Basement LLC
affiliate in bankruptcy. The two clothing chains filed for
bankruptcy in November as consumer spending dropped and
competition from discount retailers increased.  Daffy’s traces its roots to 1961 when Irving Shulman opened
a store called Daffy Dan’s Bargain Town in Elizabeth,  New
Jersey , according to the company’s  website . The retailer has
locations in New York, New Jersey and Philadelphia and about
1,300 employees as of July 15.  The company’s bankruptcy petition was filed by lawyers at
Weil Gotshal & Manges LLP.  The case is In re Daffy’s Inc., 12-13312, U.S. Bankruptcy
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
