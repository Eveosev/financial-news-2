Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO)  appointed  Marc Benioff , co-founder and chief executive officer of
 Salesforce.com Inc. (CRM) , and Kristina Johnson, CEO of Enduring Hydro
LLC, to its board.  The appointments, which bring the total number of directors
to 14, are effective Aug. 1, 2012, San Jose, California-based
Cisco said today in a statement.  Cisco shares have tumbled 13 percent this year as CEO John Chambers works to reverse a slowdown in sales growth and stem
market-share losses. The board expansion follows Cisco’s March
agreement to buy NDS Group Ltd. for about $5 billion, adding
software used in next-generation video services as it pushes
into Internet-based cloud computing.  “Marc has changed the face of technology through his bold
ideas around cloud computing and the social enterprise,”
Chambers said in the statement. “Kristina brings us an
unmatched expertise in science and technology, which will help
guide Cisco as we continue to innovate and transform our
customers’ experiences.”  In May, Chambers cited Europe’s debt crisis, weak
 government spending  and a drop in orders from large corporate
customers for a fourth-quarter profit forecast that was below
analysts’ estimates.  The company is scheduled to report earnings on Aug. 15.  To contact the reporter on this story:
