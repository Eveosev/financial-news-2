Class-action lawsuits against
Peregrine Financial Group Inc.’s Russell Wasendorf Sr. cannot
proceed because they were stopped by a judge’s order appointing
a receiver to assemble the assets of the brokerage’s founder,
the receiver said in a federal court filing in Chicago. Three
proposed class-action suits are seeking damages from Wasendorf
and other Peregrine officers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
