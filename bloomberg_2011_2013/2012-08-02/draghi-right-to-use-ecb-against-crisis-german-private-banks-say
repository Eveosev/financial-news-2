European Central Bank chief  Mario Draghi ’s pledge to do whatever is needed to protect the euro is
justifiable and should include the option of buying sovereign
bonds, the head of Germany’s BDB private banks group said.  “Naturally, it would be preferable from the policy point
of view for the ECB to concentrate on its price-stability remit,
but we’re not in normal circumstances,” BDB General Manager
 Michael Kemmer  said today in an  ARD  television interview. “If
the crisis becomes a blaze, you have to douse the flames, and
you don’t ask if the pond from which you draw water is the right
one.”  Economic indicators suggest that the risk of the ECB
sparking inflation is limited, Kemmer said. Draghi will hold a
press conference today at 2:30 p.m. in  Frankfurt .  To contact the reporter on this story:
