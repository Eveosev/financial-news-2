Crude oil output in  Nigeria , Africa’s
biggest producer, reached an “all-time high” after security
improved in the southern oil-producing Niger River delta region,
Andrew Yakubu, group managing director of the Nigerian National
Petroleum Corp., said.  Total production rose yesterday to 2.7 million barrels a
day from 2.4 million barrels, he said in an e-mailed statement
today from Abuja, the capital.  “The security measures put in place by the federal
government in the Niger Delta region was beginning to yield
positive results,” Yakubu, who was appointed to the job in
June, said in the statement. Security along oil pipelines and
production facilities has been restored, he said.  Energy companies have stepped up production as attacks on
installations in the delta declined following a 2009 government
amnesty for militants in the region fighting for a greater share
of oil resources. Attacks by armed groups cut more than 28
percent of the country’s output between 2006 and 2009, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  At least 90 percent of the country’s oil is pumped by the
state oil company, also known as NNPC, in joint ventures with
 Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) , Exxon Mobil Corp.,  Chevron Corp. (CVX) ,  Total
SA (FP)  and  Eni SpA. (ENI)   Nigeria depends on oil exports for more than 80 percent of
government revenue and 95 percent of foreign-exchange income.
The West African nation earned $196 billion from oil and gas
shipments in the four years through 2010, according to the
National Bureau of Statistics.  To contact the reporter on this story:
