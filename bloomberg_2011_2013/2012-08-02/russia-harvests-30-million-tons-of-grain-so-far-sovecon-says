Russia’s grain harvest is 30 million
metric tons since July 1 with yields dropping across the country
except for the Central federal district, down from 31.4 million
tons this time last year,  SovEcon  said.  Russia’s total yield is 2.25 tons a hectare (2.47 acres)
compared with 3.19 tons a hectare last year, Moscow-based
SovEcon said on its website today. The central area yield is
2.81 tons a hectare, up from 2.65 tons a year earlier, it said.  The  Agriculture Ministry  is considering lowering its grain
forecast for the whole year to 70 million tons because of
drought since May, Interfax reported today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
