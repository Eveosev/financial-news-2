The cost of insuring corporate and
sovereign bonds from non-payment in the Asia-Pacific region
declined, according to traders of credit-default swaps.  The  Markit iTraxx Asia  index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  fell 1 basis point to 158 basis points
as of 8:42 a.m. in  Hong Kong , Credit Agricole SA prices show.
The gauge fell 11 basis points last month and has ranged between
132.5 basis points and 210 basis points this year, according to
data provider CMA.  The  Markit iTraxx Australia  index fell 1 basis point to 167
as of 10:42 a.m. in Sydney, Credit Agricole prices show. The
measure dropped 19 basis points in July, its biggest monthly
decline since January, according to CMA, which is owned by
McGraw-Hill Cos. and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the
privately negotiated market.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index was unchanged at 185 as of
9:27 a.m. in  Tokyo , Deutsche Bank AG prices show. The benchmark
has ranged between 136 basis points and 217 basis points this
year, CMA prices show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
