Credit Agricole  SA will put about 2.5
billion euros ($3 billion) of capital into its Greek unit
Emporiki Bank SA before selling it,  Kathimerini  reported,
without saying how it got the information.  The capital need arises from a study of Greek banks’ loan
portfolios performed earlier this year by a unit of  BlackRock
Inc. (BLK) , and will make it easier for the French bank to sell
Emporiki, the Athens-based newspaper said.  In return Credit Agricole will retain a stake of about 5
percent in Emporiki after its sale, which has attracted interest
from  National Bank of Greece SA ,  EFG Eurobank Ergasias SA (EUROB)  and
Alpha Bank SA, Kathimerini said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
