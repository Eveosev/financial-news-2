German savings banks warned the
 European Central Bank  against damaging the “stability culture”
of the euro by sticking to low interest-rate policies and
flooding the markets with liquidity.  “The current ECB policy of keeping interest rates at a
record low, buying more sovereign debt and flooding the markets
with liquidity reduces the value of savings and, with that,
people’s provisions for old age throughout  Europe ,” Georg Fahrenschon, the president of the Berlin-based DSGV banking
group, said in a statement today. “The ECB is on the verge of
moving further away from the stability culture of the
Bundesbank.”  While non-standard measures are needed to fight the debt
crisis, pumping increasing amounts of liquidity doesn’t tackle
overindebtedness, which is the root cause of the crisis,
Fahrenschon said.  “The ECB shouldn’t forget that fighting fire with fire
leaves a lot of scorched earth behind,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
