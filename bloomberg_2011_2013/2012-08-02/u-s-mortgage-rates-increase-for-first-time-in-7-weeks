U.S.  mortgage rates  rose for the
first time in seven weeks, increasing from the record lows that
have helped stabilize the housing market.  The average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage climbed to
3.55 percent in the week ended today from 3.49 percent, the
lowest level in records dating to 1971, according to a statement
from McLean, Virginia-based  Freddie Mac . The average 15-year
rate rose to 2.83 percent from 2.8 percent.  Low borrowing costs and a shrinking inventory of available
properties are helping to bolster a real estate recovery. The
S&P/Case-Shiller  index  of prices in 20 U.S. cities decreased 0.7
percent in the 12 months through May, the smallest decline since
September 2010.  “ House prices  have turned the corner,”  Sal Guatieri ,
senior economist at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto, said in a
telephone interview. “The record-low mortgage rates are
supporting the best affordability in at least four decades.”  An index of applications for  refinancing  climbed 0.8
percent in the week ended July 27, the Washington-based  Mortgage
Bankers Association  said yesterday. The group’s  purchase  gauge
dropped 2.3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
