Norske Skogindustrier ASA (NSG) ,  Europe ’s
third-largest maker of newsprint, is targeting the bonds trading
the cheapest rather than those with the shortest maturities as
it buys back debt to trim its balance sheet.  “We are looking at the yield” when doing repurchases,
Chief Financial Officer Audun Roeneid said today in an interview
in Oslo. Norske Skog is looking at the bonds maturing 2014
through 2017, he said.  The company, based in Lysaker,  Norway , bought back $46.9
million of its euro and dollar denominated bonds in the second
quarter, according to Bloomberg calculations. The company is
trimming debt as it seeks to cut a 6.9 billion kroner ($1.14
billion) debt burden amid excess supply in the newsprint market
and competition from online media.  The buybacks in the quarter are positive as they signal the
company is “comfortable with liquidity situation,” Oeyvind
Hamre and other analysts at Pareto Securities ASA, said in an e-
mailed note to clients.  Yields on the company’s 7 percent notes maturing June 2017
fell 1.6 percentage point to 20.769 percent as of 4:14 p.m. in
Oslo, down from as high as 32.462 percent on Oct. 28.  Second-quarter earnings before interest, tax, depreciation
and amortization, or Ebitda, rose to 393 million kroner from 248
million kroner a year earlier, the company said in statement
today.  Cash flow  from operating activities before financial
items rose to 423 million kroner from 295 million kroner while
its net interest-bearing debt fell to 6.9 billion kroner from
7.1 billion kroner.  The company sold its Parenco mill and the Reparco recovered
paper business to H2 Equity Partners, it said in a separate
statement. The transaction will increase the company’s cash by
about 30 million euros ($36.8 million), the papermaker said,
without providing further details.  The sale of Parenco “should help liquidity further without
losing significant Ebitda,” Pareto said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
