Sugar beet yields in  Italy  are
suffering from prolonged drought, with production sliding 50
percent in some areas in the north where the harvest is
starting, farm-industry organization Confagricoltura reported.  Damage from a water shortage is affecting large areas of
Padua, Rovigo, Ferrara and Bologna provinces, with beet yields
falling to 25 to 30 metric tons per hectare (2.47 acres),
compared with an average 60 to 65 tons where irrigation was
possible, the Rome-based agriculture group wrote in an e-mailed
statement today.  Italian farmers planted sugar beets on 52,000 hectares this
year, 8,000 hectares more than in 2011, and if the lack of rain
in the north continues in August the effect on beet revenue will
be “heavy,” Confagricoltura said. Italy produced 506,523 tons
of beet sugar last year, European Union data show, about 3
percent of the bloc’s total output of the sweetener.  “The reduction of tonnage per hectare, while partly
compensated by increased sugar content in the beets, will
increase the impact of growing costs on company balance
sheets,” Confagricoltura said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
