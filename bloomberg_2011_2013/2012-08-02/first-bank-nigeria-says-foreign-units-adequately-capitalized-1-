Foreign units of  First Bank of
Nigeria Plc , the country’s third-biggest lender by market value,
are “adequately capitalized” and are not affected by a central
bank rule that stopped lenders from funding offshore operations,
Chief Executive Officer Bisi Onasanya said.  “In the unlikely event that we will be affected, we are
looking at various options, including reducing dividend payout”
in those units, he said today on a conference call from Lagos,
 Nigeria ’s commercial capital.  Banks in Nigeria must obtain new funds to recapitalize
their foreign units and won’t be allowed to use money already
raised by their parent companies, the  Central Bank of Nigeria 
said on July 26. Lenders that can’t raise additional capital for
foreign subsidiaries “in the host market” will have to close
the units, the Abuja-based regulator said.  First Bank holds a 75 percent stake in Banque
Internationale de Credit, a lender in the  Democratic Republic  of
Congo, and owns FBN Bank (UK) Ltd., which also has a branch in
Paris, according to information on its website.  First Bank shares rose 3.2 percent to close at 12 naira in
Lagos. The stock has gained 35 percent this year, compared with
a 13 percent rise in the Nigerian Stock Exchange  All-Share Index (NGSEINDX) 
over the same period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
