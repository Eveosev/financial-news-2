Egypt ’s highest body dealing with
Islamic religious questions issued a fatwa banning Muslims from
eating in public during the fasting hours of the holy month of
Ramadan, the state-run Ahram gate website reported.  Dar Al-Efta, which is affiliated with Egypt’s top Islamic
institution, Al-Azhar, urged the government to ensure the edict
is respected, Ahram reported, citing a statement from the group.  Breaking the fast isn’t a personal freedom and is an
“assault on the sanctity of Islam and hurts Muslim feelings,”
it added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
