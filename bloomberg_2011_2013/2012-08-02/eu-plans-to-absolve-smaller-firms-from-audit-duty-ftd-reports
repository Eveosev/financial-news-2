The European Union may absolve
companies with assets of less than 20 million euros ($24.5
million) of the obligation to have their annual reports audited,
 Financial Times Deutschland  reported, citing changes to a
proposal introduced by EU parliamentarian Klaus-Heiner Lehne.  The proposal, which the parliamentâ€™s Legal Affairs
Committee is set to vote on next month, would affect 250,000
companies across the region and may harm auditors which
specialize in smaller firms, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
