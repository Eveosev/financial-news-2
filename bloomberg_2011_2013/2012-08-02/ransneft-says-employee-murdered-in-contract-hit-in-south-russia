OAO Transneft,  Russia ’s oil pipeline
operator, said the murder of an employee in the southern region
of Dagestan was a contract killing linked to his work.  Sergei Saipudinov, a security officer responsible for
preventing theft from the regional pipeline network, was shot
dead last week, Transneft said in a  statement  on its website.  Thieves tapped into the network six times in the first half
of this year, down from about 20 incidents in the same period of
2011, Transneft’s local head, Jafar Nasirov, said in the
statement dated Aug. 1. Police found 13 illegal mini-refineries
in the region last year, the company said.  Russia’s North Caucasus region has been riven by separatist
violence since the collapse of the  Soviet Union  in 1991. Federal
forces fought two wars against rebels in Chechnya, and violence
has flared up in neighboring Dagestan. Six suspected militants
were killed by government forces last week, Interfax reported,
citing the National Anti-Terrorist Committee.  To contact the reporter on this story:
