A court decision in Mexico State will
give the Institutional Revolutionary Party an extra seat in
Mexico’s lower house, allowing its alliance to achieve a
majority, newspaper El Universal  reported .  A court in Toluca, the capital of the nation’s most
populous state, where incoming President Enrique Pena Nieto was
governor, took a seat away from the Progressive Movement that
includes presidential runner-up  Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador ’s
party, citing an error in the vote count, the newspaper said.  The added victory in the July 1 national election would
give a PRI-led alliance with the Green Party and the New
Alliance party 251 out of 500 seats in the Chamber of Deputies,
according to the newspaper. That would be enough for the PRI to
pass laws and regulations, without assuring the party sufficient
support for the constitutional changes needed to open the energy
industry to private investment.  Lopez Obrador ’s Democratic Revolution Party plans to appeal
the decision, El Universal said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
