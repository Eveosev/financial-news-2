U.S. Gulf Coast crudes strengthened
as the discount for West Texas Intermediate versus Brent oil
widened to the largest gap in more than two months.  The difference between the two grades increased $1.72 to
$18.77 a barrel based on September settlement prices, the widest
spread since May 16. When Brent gains versus WTI, it typically
strengthens the value of U.S. grades that compete with foreign
oils priced against the European benchmark.  Heavy Louisiana Sweet’s premium to the U.S. benchmark
widened $1 to $18 a barrel at 4:04 p.m. in  New York , according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Light Louisiana Sweet’s premium increased 75 cents to $19.  Poseidon’s premium added $1.05 to $13.45 and Southern Green
Canyon increased 25 cents to $12.25 a barrel over WTI. Mars
Blend gained $1 to $14.  The premium for  Thunder Horse , a sour crude with lower
sulfur content than Mars, Poseidon and Southern Green Canyon,
gained 75 cents to $16.50.  Syncrude’s discount to WTI narrowed 25 cents to $1.25 a
barrel. Syncrude is a synthetic oil upgraded from tar-like
bitumen in  Alberta  into refinery-ready crude.  Western Canada Select’s discount narrowed $2.75 a barrel to
$20 below WTI.  Bakken oil’s discount was unchanged at $4 a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
