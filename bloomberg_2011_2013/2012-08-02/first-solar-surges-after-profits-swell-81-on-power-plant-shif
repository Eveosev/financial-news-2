First Solar Inc. (FSLR) , the world’s biggest
maker of thin-film panels, rose the most in seven weeks after
second-quarter earnings rose 81 percent.  First Solar gained 21 percent to $17.93 at the close in New
York, the most since June 12. That trimmed its loss for the year
to 47 percent.  First Solar’s profit jumped after making a strategic shift
toward building solar farms with its modules. Net income was
$111 million, or $1.27 a share, compared with $61.1 million, or
70 cents, a year earlier, the Tempe, Arizona-based company said
in a statement yesterday.  Excluding restructuring charges, earnings were $1.65 a
share, 71 cents more than the average of 27 analysts’ estimates
compiled by Bloomberg. Sales climbed 80 percent to $957.3
million, largely from selling utility-scale power projects to
companies such as  Exelon Corp. (EXC)  and  Enbridge Inc. (ENB)   The company also announced plans to build a new project in
 California , the 139-megawatt Campo Verde solar farm, which will
sell power to  Sempra Energy (SRE) ’s San Diego Gas & Electric under a
20-year contract.  For the year, First Solar raised its earnings forecast by
20 cents, to a range of $4.20 to $4.70 a share, excluding
restructuring charges, from a May 3 estimate of $4 to $4.50 a
share.  Four Upgrades  Analysts at four companies upgraded First Solar today,
including Robert W. Baird & Co.,  Cantor Fitzgerald  and EVA
Dimensions, which all recommend that investors buy the shares,
according to  data  compiled by Bloomberg. ThinkEquity LLC’s
rating was raised to hold. The average 12-month price target
increased to $21.07 from $20.84 yesterday, the average of 35
estimates.  Four analysts rate the shares a sell, including Aaron Chew,
at Maxim Group LLC in New York, who has a 12-month target price
of $9. While the company raised its 2012 earnings forecast by 20
cents a share, he wrote in a research note today that this
figure “backed out all restructuring expenses in their non-GAAP
calculation but none of the one-time gains and benefits.”  Those expenses will add up to about 70 cents a share,
meaning that the company’s “guidance was quietly cut by 50
cents, suggesting a deteriorating outlook,” he estimated.
“Analysts are just dying to have a buy so they can jump on the
positive headlines.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
