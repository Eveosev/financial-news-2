U.S. policy makers must revive the
country’s export economy as private consumption struggles to
recover from the collapse of the real-estate bubble,  Yale
University ’s  Stephen Roach  told the  Handelsblatt  newspaper.  Insufficient investment in machines and infrastructure has
hurt the competitiveness of U.S. exports and made the economy
more dependent on consumption, which makes up about 70 percent
of economic growth, Roach said in a guest column.  Private consumption in the second quarter grew at an
annualized 1.5 percent in real terms, he said. Consumers are
saving and cutting debt and this is “in equal measure logical
and rational,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
