Oil options volatility fell,
following futures lower, after European Central Bank President
 Mario Draghi  failed to detail a plan to shore up the euro by
curbing rising government borrowing costs in the region.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
September, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a
gauge of options prices, was 30 percent at 4:10 p.m. on the  New
York Mercantile Exchange , down from 31.6 percent yesterday.  Oil for September delivery dropped $1.78, or 2 percent, to
settle at $87.13 a barrel on the Nymex after Draghi signaled
that the ECB will join forces with governments to buy sovereign
bonds in sufficient quantities to remove all doubts about the
future of the euro. Draghi said last week he would do whatever
it takes to protect the currency, stoking speculation he would
outline plans following a central bank meeting today.  “There’s renewed fears of whether we’re going to start to
see a global economic slowdown,”  Gene McGillian , an analyst and
broker at Tradition Energy in  Stamford ,  Connecticut , said by
telephone. “Usually when the market drops this significantly,
you’ll see volatility kind of move out.”  The most active options in electronic trading today were
September $80 puts, which gained 5 cents to 27 cents a barrel at
4:17 p.m. with 3,922 lots trading. September $100 calls were the
second-most active options, with 1,958 lots changing hands as
they dropped 7 cents to 7 cents a barrel.  Bullish Bets  Calls accounted for 54 percent of total electronic trading
volume. One contract covers 1,000 barrels of crude.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on floor
trading, where the bulk of options trading occurs.  In the previous session, puts accounted for 58 percent of
the 82,584 contracts traded.  September $83 puts were the most actively traded options
yesterday, with 6,768 lots changing hands. They fell 13 cents to
52 cents a barrel. September $80 puts declined 6 cents to 22
cents on volume of 5,438.  Open interest was highest for December $80 puts with 42,779
contracts. Next were December $100 calls with 40,225 lots and
December $120 calls with 38,712.  To contact the reporter on this story:
