About 20 percent of all the sugar
waiting to be loaded at main ports in  Brazil , the world’s
largest producer, is destined for  China , according to Williams
Servicos Maritimos Ltda.  Vessels waiting yesterday were set to take 563,100 metric
tons of the sweetener to the Asian nation, figures from the
Recife, Brazil-based shipping agency showed. An 18,000-ton cargo
scheduled last week for loading on the United Jalua at the port
of Paranagua was canceled, according to the data.  China, the world’s second-biggest sugar consumer after
 India , imported almost 2.7 million tons from the start of the
season in October through June, up from 910,000 tons a year
earlier,  customs data  showed. Chinese demand helped sugar to
climb in June and July after three months of declines.  “We know that buying from China halted the drop, and now
selling from washed-out cargoes appeared to have help curb the
rally for now,”  Michael McDougall , head of the Brazil desk at
broker Newedge Group in New York, said in a report yesterday.  Vessels waiting at the ports of Recife, Santos and
Paranagua yesterday would load a total of 2.82 million tons of
the sweetener, little changed from 2.8 million tons a week
earlier, the data showed. Shipments were also heading to
countries including Egypt, Malaysia, Iran, Canada and Algeria.  To contact the reporter on this story:
