Weight Watchers International Inc. (WTW) 
plunged the most in almost three months after the provider of
dieting services cut its annual earnings forecast, citing slower
enrollment.  The stock  tumbled  13 percent to $42.66 at the close in New
York, for the biggest decline since May 3. Through yesterday,
the shares had fallen 11 percent this year.  Weight Watchers, which is working with brand ambassador
Jessica Simpson, said it doesn’t expect her role as spokeswoman
to be enough to offset an anticipated weakening of enrollment
trends at meetings. Slower business in June and July, hurt by
economic uncertainty, is likely to continue in the second half
of 2012, Chief Executive Officer David Kirchhoff said.  “We are now operating under the assumption that enrollment
trends for the remainder of the year will be worse than we had
originally forecasted,” Kirchhoff said yesterday on a
conference call, after the company cut its forecast. “While we
originally expected second-half attendances to be roughly flat
to prior and for paid weeks to grow modestly, we’re now
forecasting high-single digit declines in attendances and paid
weeks,”  Full-year earnings per share will be $4 to $4.20 per share,
compared to a prior  forecast  of $4.60 to $4.80, the New York-
based company said in a statement yesterday. That compared to an
average analyst estimate of $4.60, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
