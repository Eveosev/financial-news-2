Aquarius Platinum Ltd. (AQP)  is set for a
record low in Sydney after the company suspended operations at a
mine in  South Africa  because of an attack by an armed mob that
left three people dead and at least 20 others injured.  The  stock  plunged as much as 13 percent to 49.5 cents and
traded at 50 cents as of 10:34 a.m. local time. That would be
the lowest since the Perth-based platinum mining company began
trading in September 1999.  Around 200 people, some armed, forced their way onto the
Kwezi shaft, a production unit at the Kroondal PSA mine in the
North West Province, throwing petrol bombs and threatening the
lives of employees, Aquarius said in a statement dated yesterday.
About 450 workers were evacuated and police have taken charge at
the site, the company said.  Aquarius, which also operates in  Zimbabwe , relies on its
South African mines for 75 percent of its fiscal 2011 sales,
 data  compiled by Bloomberg show. Kroondal, which began
production in August 1999, is Aquarius’s biggest mine, according
to the company’s  website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
