Treasuries climbed, pushing yields
toward record lows, after European Central Bank President  Mario
Draghi  failed to take immediate steps to support the economy.  U.S. government debt  reversed an earlier decline as Draghi
said there was “severe malfunctioning” in the region’s debt
markets while stopping short of announcing concrete measures to
resolve the situation, pushing Spanish and Italian bond yields
higher. He spoke after policy makers kept the benchmark interest
rate on hold at 0.75 percent. The number of Americans filing
applications for  unemployment benefits  rose last week before a
report tomorrow forecast to show the unemployment held steady
above 8 percent.  “All risk assets built in the possibility that they were
going to come in with something very solid today, and he didn’t
deliver on any measure at all,” Tom Tucci, managing director
and head of Treasury trading in  New York  at CIBC World Markets
Corp., said in a telephone interview. “We thought there was
going to at least be a relief valve created, and they couldn’t
even produce that.”  The 10-year yield  fell  five basis points, or 0.05
percentage point, to 1.48 percent at 5 p.m. in New York,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The 1.75 percent note
maturing in May 2022 rose 13/32, or $4.06 per $1,000 face
amount, to 102 15/32. The yield touched 1.38 percent on July 25,
the lowest ever.  The  30-year yield  fell four basis points to 2.55 percent
after touching an all-time low of 2.4405 percent on July 26.  Volatility Rises  Volatility climbed yesterday to 74.1 basis points, the
highest since June 22, according to Bank of America Merrill
Lynch’s MOVE index. It dropped to a five-year low of 56.7 basis
points on May 7, and has averaged 75 basis points this year,
touching a 2012 high of 95.4 basis points on June 15. The index
measures price swings based on options.  “The market was anticipating we would get an actual plan
as opposed to the measures that they appear to be considering,”
said  Jim Vogel , head of agency-debt research at FTN Financial in
 Memphis ,  Tennessee . “It doesn’t quite match the buildup to this
morning’s press conference. It’s not yet the all-clearing
announcement that people were anticipating.”  Any ECB bond purchases will be conducted in a way to soothe
investors’ concerns about seniority, Draghi told reporters at a
press conference in  Frankfurt  today. Details of the bond
purchase plan will be fleshed out in coming weeks, he said.  Spain, Italy  The additional yield investors demand to hold Italian and
Spanish 10-year bonds over the nations’ two-year notes widened
after Draghi’s comments, with the spread between  Italy ’s two-and
10-year yields growing to as much as 258 basis points at 4:25
p.m. London time, the most since May 14.  Spain ’s spread
increased to 235 basis points, the biggest since July 5.  Yields on Spanish bonds due in 10 years rose as high as 7.2
percent, while the interest rate on similar-maturity Italian
debt touched 6.35 percent.  “It comes across as an attempt to buy some more time,
having bought some time last week with his statements,” said
 Carl Lantz , head of interest-rate strategy in New York at Credit
Suisse AG, a primary dealer. “I don’t think the market has a
lot of patience for that.”  Jobless claims climbed by 8,000 to 365,000 in the week
ended July 28, Labor Department figures showed today in
 Washington . The median forecast of 47 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News called for an increase to 370,000.  The  U.S. economy  added 100,000 workers last month,
following a gain of 80,000 in June, according to a Bloomberg
survey of economists before tomorrow’s Labor Department report.
The jobless rate will stay at 8.2 percent, according to
economists. It has been more than 8 percent since February 2009.  Fed Buying  “Even if you get a very positive number, it’s only one
month, and we’re still not where we want to be,” Justin Lederer, an  interest-rate  strategist in New York at primary
dealer Cantor Fitzgerald LP. “I still believe the Fed does
another purchase program in September.”  Treasuries fell yesterday after the Fed refrained from
boosting monetary stimulus while indicating a sluggish economy
may prompt further steps to spur growth.  The central bank bought $2.3 trillion of mortgage and
Treasury debt from 2008 to 2011 in two rounds of so-called
quantitative easing to cap borrowing costs. It is now in the
process of swapping shorter-term Treasuries in its holdings with
those due in six to 30 years to put downward pressure on long-
term borrowing costs.  The Fed purchased $1.83 billion of Treasuries due from
February 2036 to February 2042 today as part of its Operation
Twist program.  There is a “significant chance” the Fed will implement a
third round of quantitative easing at its September meeting as
the economic data weaken, according to a report yesterday by
Michael S. Hanson, U.S. economist at Bank of America Corp. in
New York, and other economists and strategists at the company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
