South African vehicle-sales growth
accelerated in July, as the lowest interest rates in more than
three decades spurred  consumer spending  and vehicle rental
companies replenished their fleets, an industry group said.  Sales rose 18.3 percent from a year earlier to 54,067, the
Pretoria-based National Association of Automobile Manufacturers
of  South Africa  said in an e-mailed statement today. Sales
growth increased from 15.6 percent in June. The median estimate
of three economists surveyed by Bloomberg was 14.2 percent.  Vehicle-sales growth has quickened even as a debt crisis in
 Europe , which buys about a third of South African manufactured
exports, curbs growth in  Africa ’s largest economy. The economy
should expand 2.7 percent this year, down from 3.1 percent in
2011, according to the government and central bank.  “Despite prospects of further slowing in the domestic
economy, the automotive sector continued to perform remarkably
well,” with domestic sales estimated to increase by 10 percent
for the full year, the association said. Sales are being
supported by “historically low  interest rates , further
improvement in vehicle affordability in real terms and improving
demand for credit by households and businesses.”  The central bank cut its  benchmark interest rate  by half a
percentage point to 5 percent on July 19 to help support the
economy and boost consumer spending. Borrowing by households and
businesses rose 8.7 percent in June, up from 8.3 percent a month
earlier, the Pretoria-based bank said on July 30.  Passenger-car sales increased 18 percent in July from a
year earlier to 37,844, with rental companies accounting for
16.5 percent of sales. Purchases of light commercial vehicles,
such as pick-up trucks and minivans, rose 21 percent to 13,781,
Naamsa said. Sales of heavy trucks and buses rose 9 percent to
1,619 units.  Vehicle exports rose 12 percent to 27,625 last month, the
association said.  “The momentum of industry-export sales should improve
further over the balance of the year as various vehicle-export
programs were ramped up, particularly exports of light
commercial vehicles,” it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
