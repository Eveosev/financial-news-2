Ukraine reported its first outbreak
of the deadly pig disease African swine fever, the World
Organisation for  Animal Health  reported, citing a notification
by the country’s Ministry of Agricultural Policy.  The illness, which is harmless to people, was found in
three backyard pigs that died from a herd of five in the
country’s east, according to the  notice  published online today
by the Paris-based animal-health organization, known by its
French acronym OIE.  The disease is caused by a virus for which there is no
vaccine and has killed thousands of pigs in  Russia . The fever
may have been introduced in the region in 2007 when swine at a
dump in the Black Sea port of Poti ate garbage from a ship,
according to the  United Nations ’ Food & Agriculture
Organization.  Authorities are carrying out “a full range of measures to
eradicate the outbreak,” the OIE wrote. Those include culling
of pigs, quarantine measures and movement controls, according to
the notice.  Ukraine had about 7.48 million pigs at the start of 2012,
according to data from the  U.S. Department of Agriculture . The
virus was confirmed by laboratory testing on Aug. 31, according
to the OIE notice.  The disease has been previously found in European nations
including Spain and Portugal in 1960. Portugal needed 33 years
to rid itself of the fever and Spain took 35 years, according to
the OIE. The illness remains endemic on the Mediterranean Sea
island of Sardinia. Epidemics also took place in Brazil from
1978 to 1981 and  Haiti  from 1978 to 1984.  To contact the reporter on this story:
