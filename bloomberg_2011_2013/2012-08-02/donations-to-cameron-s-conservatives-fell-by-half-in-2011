Donations to Prime Minister  David Cameron ’s Conservative Party fell by 45 percent last year to
their lowest level since 2003, the  Electoral Commission  said.  The Conservatives received 23.7 million pounds ($36.7
million), down from 43.1 million pounds in 2010, when party
coffers were boosted by donations for the general election
campaign.  The opposition  Labour Party  saw donations decline to 31.3
million pounds, while the Liberal Democrats, the junior partner
in the coalition government, attracted 6.2 million pounds, a
third less than in the previous year.  While Cameron does not face national elections until 2015,
support for the Conservatives has fallen sharply following an
unpopular budget in March and poor news on the economy.  A YouGov Plc poll completed on July 23 gave Labour 43
percent support, the Conservatives 33 percent and the Liberal
Democrats 9 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
