Kenya Power Ltd. (KPLL) , the East African
nation’s sole electricity distributor, rose to its highest in
seven months before the release of full-year earnings.  The stock advanced 1 percent to 15.50 shillings by the 3
p.m. close in Nairobi, the highest level since Dec. 30.  “They will report good results mainly driven by network
expansion, increased operational efficiencies through network
upgrades and growth in customer numbers to drive revenues,”
Vimal Parmar, head of research at Nairobi-based Kestrel Capital
East Africa Ltd., said in a phone interview today.  Kestrel estimates full-year net profit will grow to 4.7
billion shillings ($55.8 million) from 4.22 billion shillings a
year earlier, with earnings per share of 2.4 shillings.  Kenya Power’s fiscal year ended June 30 and the company is
yet to set a date for the announcement of the earnings, a
spokesman said in a phone interview today.  In the six months to December, net income grew 2.7 percent
to 2.28 billion shillings, the company said Feb. 24.  To contact the reporter on this story:
