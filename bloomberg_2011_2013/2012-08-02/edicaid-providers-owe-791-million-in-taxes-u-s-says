Doctors, dentists and other health
providers in three states owed $791 million in back taxes while
they collected $6.6 billion in 2009  from  Medicaid, the insurance
program for the poor, government investigators found.  About 7,000 health providers in Florida, Texas and New York
owed back taxes while collecting payments from Medicaid, the
U.S.-state coverage plan, the Government Accountability Office,
the investigative arm of Congress, said in a  report  today.
Thirty-two of the providers owed more than $1 million and
collected more than $1 million in payments, the GAO said,
without naming them.  The federal government should prohibit health providers
with unpaid taxes from enrolling in Medicaid, said U.S. senators
who requested the report.  “People who cheat on their taxes show a clear disregard
for the law so they might be more likely to defraud Medicaid, or
even harm patients,” U.S. Senator  Tom Coburn , a Republican of
 Oklahoma , said in a statement.  The government’s ability to recoup unpaid taxes from
Medicaid health providers is more limited than in Medicare, the
insurance program for the elderly. Because Medicare is run
entirely by the federal government, the  Internal Revenue Service 
can continuously garnish payments to collect back taxes. Because
Medicaid is administered by states, its payments aren’t
considered federal and are more difficult to garnish, the GAO
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
