Egypt ’s culture minister and the
minister of state for military production kept their jobs as the
country’s new government neared completion before being sworn in
today by President Mohamed Mursi.  Ashraf el-Arabi will take over for outgoing Planning and
International Cooperation Minister Fayza Aboulnaga, joining the
ranks of newcomers to the Cabinet headed by Prime Minister-
designate Hisham Qandil. The Youth Ministry portfolio went to
Osama Yaseen, a member of the Freedom and Justice Party, the
Muslim Brotherhood’s political arm. That makes Yaseen one of the
few Islamists to be named in a government many secularists had
feared would be driven largely by the FJP’s agenda.  Ali Sabry, the minister of state for military production,
kept his job, as did Culture Minister Mohamed Saber Arab. That
brings to eight the number of holdovers from the outgoing
Cabinet.  To contact the reporter on this story:
