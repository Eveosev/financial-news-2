India’s bonds rose for a second day
on speculation banks will refrain from paring holdings, even
after the central bank cut their debt-investment requirements,
as a slowing economy saps demand for loans.  The  Reserve Bank  of India lowered this week the  proportion 
of deposits lenders must hold in fixed-income securities to 23
percent from 24 percent with effect Aug. 11, the first reduction
since 2010. The cut in the so-called statutory liquidity ratio
may not spur lending immediately, analysts at Barclays Plc
including Singapore-based Kumar Rachapudi wrote in a research
note, prompting banks to keep spare funds invested in debt.  “Banks are unlikely to decrease their bond holdings, given
that demand for credit remains muted,” analysts at Barclays
wrote. “We continue to recommend staying long on 10-year
 government bonds .”  The yield on the 8.15 percent securities due June 2022 fell
one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 8.22 percent in
Mumbai, according to the central bank’s trading system.  Bank lending in  India  increased at an average annual pace
of 17.3 percent so far this year, compared with 20.4 percent in
the whole of 2011, central bank data show.  The Reserve Bank of India kept the repurchase  rate 
unchanged at 8 percent at a policy review on July 31 and cut its
economic-growth forecast for the year through March 2013 to 6.5
percent from 7.3 percent.  One-year  interest-rate swaps , or derivative contracts used
to guard against fluctuations in funding costs, was little
changed at 7.76 percent, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
