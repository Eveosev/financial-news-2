OAO Mechel (MTL)  led New York-traded Russian
stocks lower and  RTS futures’ volatility  jumped as policy makers
in Europe, the nation’s biggest export destination, failed to
meet expectations for more stimulus measures.  The  Bloomberg Russia-US Equity Index (RUS14BN)  of the most-traded
Russian companies in  New York  fell to the lowest level in a week
as  Mechel (MTLR) , the nation’s biggest producer of cocking coal, traded
at the biggest discount to the Moscow shares in six weeks. The
RTS Volatility Index, which measures expected swings in the
index futures, rose to the highest level since June 28. Futures
expiring in September on the dollar-denominated RTS index
dropped 0.8 percent to 133,885.  Oil, Russia’s biggest export earner, tumbled to the lowest
level in three weeks and commodities retreated after ECB
President  Mario Draghi  signaled the bank will join with
governments to buy sovereign bonds, without listing definitive
measures to bolster growth. Last week, Draghi had pledged to do
“whatever it takes” to preserve the euro. Russia, the world’s
largest producer of nickel and palladium, received about half of
its 2011 budget revenue from sales of oil and natural gas.  “Investors are disappointed with the ECB decision,”
 Alexander Morozov , chief economist for Russia at HSBC Holdings
Plc in Moscow, said by phone yesterday. “They are adjusting
their positions. It has a very negative effect on Russian assets
and volatility of the market. There is no reason to expect any
appetite for risk any time soon.”  The  Market Vectors Russia ETF (RSX) , the biggest U.S.-traded
exchange-traded fund that holds Russian shares, retreated 1.5
percent to $26.08. The RTS Volatility Index advanced 3.2 percent
to 37.17 yesterday.  ‘Action and Clarity’  “Investors want to see action and clarity,” Sergey Dergachev, who helps manage $8.5 billion of emerging-market
assets at Union Investment Privatfonds in Frankfurt, said by e-
mail yesterday. “This uncertain environment is relatively bad
scene for Russian assets. The ECB signals were indeed a little
bit disappointing. Markets became nervous.”  ECB officials are working on the plan and details will be
fleshed out in coming weeks, Draghi told reporters in Frankfurt
yesterday. The central bank earlier kept the benchmark  interest
rate   on hold  at 0.75 percent.  Investors will watch U.S. nonfarm payroll figures from the
Labor Department today as an “important” indicator for market
direction, Dergachev said.  Payroll Report  A Labor Department report today may show that the pace of
hiring in July probably failed to reduce the U.S. jobless rate,
according to economists polled by Bloomberg. Unemployment is
projected to hold at 8.2 percent.  The  Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index (CRY)  of raw materials
fell 1.6 percent 294.50, the lowest since July 13, while the
Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot Index dropped 1.1 percent to 630.33.  Russia is home to some of the world’s biggest metals
producers, including  United Co. Rusal (486) , the largest aluminum
producer, and  OAO GMK Norilsk Nickel (NILSY) , the largest producer of
nickel and palladium.  Mechel’s American depositary receipts slumped 6.2 percent
to $6.20 yesterday, settling at a 3.8 percent discount to the
company’s Moscow-listed shares, the biggest gap since June 21.
The company’s Moscow  stock  rose 0.1 percent to 210 rubles, or
$6.44.  Norilsk Nickel  American depositary receipts of  Norilsk Nickel  fell 0.8
percent to $15.33 in New York, the lowest since July 25. The
stock slid 0.3 percent to 5,031 rubles, or $154.3, in Moscow.
Ten ADRs equal one common share.  Oil for September delivery sank 2 percent to $87.13 a
barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , the lowest level
since July 13. Prices have declined 12 percent this year.  Brent crude  for September settlement increased 0.1 percent
to $105.90 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe
exchange. Urals crude added 0.8 percent to $106.57 yesterday.  OAO  RusHydro (RSHYY) , Russia’s largest hydropower company, advanced
3.7 percent to $2.53 in New York yesterday. The  stock  rose 2.7
percent to 84.40 kopeks in Moscow, or 2.6 U.S. cents. Each ADR
represents 100 ordinary shares.  The company said yesterday that first-quarter revenue fell
to 85.2 billion rubles ($2.61 billion), beating  the 78.6
billion estimated by  Alfa Bank .  To contact the reporter on this story:
