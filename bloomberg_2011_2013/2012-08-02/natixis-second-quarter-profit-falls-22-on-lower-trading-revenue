Natixis SA (KN) , the investment-banking
and asset-management unit of Groupe BPCE, said second-quarter
profit dropped 22 percent as  Europe ’s debt crisis curbed trading
revenue.  Net income  fell to 394 million euros ($479 million) from
505 million euros a year earlier, the Paris-based bank said in a
statement today. That beat the 347 million-euro average estimate
of five analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Natixis and its parent, Groupe BPCE, are navigating
Europe’s sovereign-debt crisis with smaller risks compared with
French rivals. Chief Executive Officer Laurent Mignon said today
on a call with reporters that, excluding currency effects, the
bank has cut more than 6 billion euros of risk-weighted assets
since the start of October, out of a planned 10 billion euros in
asset reductions.  Natixis between the start of 2009 and mid-2011 already
trimmed risk-weighted assets by at least 60 billion euros, the
CEO said.  Natixis wants to reach a core capital ratio above 9 percent
at the start of 2013 under Basel III rules, the company said
today.  French banks had $334 billion euros in public and private
debt holdings in  Italy  and $115 billion in  Spain  as of the end
of March, Bank for International Settlements figures show.
That’s the lion’s share of the $534 billion in holdings they had
in the five troubled European economies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
