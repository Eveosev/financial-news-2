Canada’s dollar weakened for a third
day against its U.S. counterpart as risk appetite waned after
the European  Central bank  failed to introduce sufficient steps
to address the region’s debt crisis.  The Canadian currency fell against most of its 16 major
peers amid declines in stocks and crude oil, the nation’s
biggest export. It rose against the euro after ECB President
 Mario Draghi  said details of a plan to buy enough sovereign
bonds to remove doubts about the shared currency’s future would
be fleshed out in coming weeks. Data tomorrow may show the U.S.,
Canada’s largest trading partner, added 100,000 jobs in July.  “The one puzzle in the Canadian dollar is that it’s been
holding up better than one might have expected, given all the
concerns about global growth,”  Avery Shenfeld , chief economist
at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, said in a phone interview
from Toronto. “Whatever jitters we have on global growth are
now playing two ways on the Canadian dollar: they’re negative on
the prices of resources we export, but a plus for bond inflows
into a safe haven.”  Canada’s currency, nicknamed the loonie, weakened 0.2
percent to C$1.0074 per U.S. dollar at 5 p.m. Toronto time. It
appreciated earlier to C$1.0002, the strongest since May 15, the
last time the two currencies were at parity. One Canadian dollar
buys 99.27 U.S. cents.  The loonie gained as much as 0.8 percent versus the euro to
C$1.2197 before trading at C$1.2271, up 0.2 percent.  Stocks, Oil  Crude oil for September delivery fell 1.8 percent to $87.31
a barrel in  New York , and the Standard & Poor’s GSCI Index of
 raw materials  lost 1.1 percent. Raw materials including oil
account for about half of Canada’s export revenues. The  S&P 500
Index  dropped 0.7 percent.  Canadian  government bonds  rose, sending the benchmark 10-
year yield down four basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to
1.67 percent. The price of the 2.75 percent securities due in
June 2022 gained 36 cents to C$109.74.  Initial claims for jobless benefits in the U.S. rose less
than forecast last week, climbing to 365,000 in the week ended
July 28, according to Labor Department figures today in
 Washington .  The U.S. employment report for July, to be released
tomorrow, is expected to show payrolls increased by 100,000
after an 80,000 gain in June, according to the Bloomberg survey
median. The jobless rate, which has remained above 8 percent
since February 2009, is projected at 8.2 percent for a third
straight month.  U.S. Jobs  “If the number comes in extremely soft, I think whatever
risk-on trades that are still out there, they will certainly be
looking toward the exit,”  Dean Popplewell , head analyst in
Toronto at the online currency-trading firm Oanda Corp., said in
a telephone interview. “That will certainly hurt the commodity
currencies.”  The loonie fell yesterday after the  Federal Reserve 
refrained from adding monetary stimulus while pledging to take
new policy steps as needed to promote stronger economic growth
and employment.  “The Fed was rather transparent in following the leader,
and the leader was going to be the ECB,” Popplewell said. “The
market is being told to take a look at every economic indicator,
and we are now to second-guess what’s coming in September.”  Canada’s currency has appreciated 2.6 percent this year
against nine major counterparts tracked by Bloomberg
Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The  U.S. dollar  has added 0.9
percent, while the euro has tumbled 5.9 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
