Most Asian  stocks  fell, with the
regional benchmark index poised to drop a second day, as
investors await a policy announcement by the  European Central
Bank  after the  Federal Reserve  refrained from adding stimulus to
the  U.S. economy .  Samsung Electronics Co. (005930) , which gets 39 percent of its sales
in Europe and the Americas, lost 2.9 percent. Fiber maker Teijin
Ltd. slumped 9.2 percent in  Tokyo  after cutting its profit
forecast. China Yurun Food Group Ltd., mainland China’s second-
largest meat supplier, jumped 19 percent in  Hong Kong  after
Malaysian billionaire  Robert Kuok ’s Kerry Group Ltd. disclosed
it owns a stake.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index fell 0.1 percent to 118.1 as of
7:35 p.m. in Tokyo after swinging between gains and losses at
least 14 times. Seven of the 10 industry groups dropped on the
measure. The MSCI Asia Pacific excluding Japan Index declined
0.5 percent.  “Asian markets are hoping but not completely believing
that the ECB will do more,” said  Ayako Sera , a market
strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank Ltd., which has 33
trillion yen ($421 billion) in assets. “Investors didn’t expect
the Fed to make any moves, so its pledge to support the economy
if necessary gave some relief. Investors are being cautious,
taking into account the possibility of their expectations being
betrayed.”  Debt Crisis  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index fell 8.3 percent from this
year’s high on Feb. 29 through yesterday amid concern Europe’s
sovereign-debt crisis will worsen as the U.S. and Chinese
economies slow. The regional benchmark index traded at 12 times
 estimated earnings , compared with 13.4 for the  Standard & Poor’s
500 Index (SPXL1)  and 11.2 for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  rose 0.1 percent even
after the Ministry of Finance reported foreign investors sold
76.5 billion yen ($975 million) in Japanese stocks last week.
Tokyo Electric Power Co. soared 10 percent, leading utilities
higher, after Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said the owner of the
stricken Fukushima Dai Ichi nuclear plant will return to profit
next fiscal year.  South Korea’s Kospi Index fell 0.6 percent. Australia’s
S&P/ASX 200 gained 0.2 percent after the nation’s retail sales
in June matched the biggest advance since April 2011. New
Zealand’s NZX 50 Index advanced 1 percent. Taiwan’s financial
markets are closed today due to a typhoon.  Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index dropped 0.7 percent, snapping
five days of advances. The Shanghai Composite Index dropped 0.6
percent and Singapore’s Straits Times Index lost 0.5 percent.  ECB Announcement  The European Central Bank is scheduled to make a policy
announcement today, with President  Mario Draghi  pledging policy
makers will do whatever is needed to preserve the euro.  Companies that do business in Europe fell. Samsung
Electronics fell 2.9 percent to 1.263 million won in  Seoul .
 Hutchison Whampoa Ltd. (13) , an operator of retail chains that gets
55 percent of its  revenue  in Europe, slid 1.2 percent to
HK$68.65 in Hong Kong.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 0.3 percent
today. The gauge dropped 0.3 percent in New York yesterday, when
the Fed refrained from adding to record stimulus even as
economic growth slowed.  “People would like the Fed to do more because I think it
would improve the  market sentiment  a little bit,” said  Angus Gluskie , managing director at White Funds Management in Sydney
who manages more than $350 million. “But I think the fact that
the Fed is not doing anything and still saying they remain
prepared to, it’s not a huge negative. I think it’s neutral.”  Mazda, Sony  Japanese stocks rose after the Fed’s inaction pushed up the
dollar against the yen as traders pared bets on further monetary
policy easing. The yen fell 0.4 percent to 78.44 per dollar
yesterday after touching 77.91, the strongest level since June
1. A weaker yen enhances the value of overseas earnings at
Japanese exporters when repatriated.  Mazda Motor Corp. (7261) , which gets 28 percent of its sales in
 North America , added 2.2 percent to 94 yen.  Sony Corp. (6758) , Japan’s
No. 1 exporter of consumer electronics, rose 2.4 percent to 964
yen. The company cut its full-year profit forecast after Japan’s
stock market closed.  Of the 1,007 companies listed on the Asian benchmark gauge,
255 are scheduled to post earnings this week, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. About 55 percent of the 271 companies
that reported since July for which Bloomberg had earnings
estimates failed to meet expectations. Earnings per share at
companies on the index are expected to grow 19.5 percent this
fiscal year.  Pork Producer  China Yurun surged 19 percent to HK$5.51 in Hong Kong, its
steepest increase since listing in 2005. Kerry Group owns 5
percent of Yurun, according to a disclosure of interests filing
to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.  Shares of China Yurun, down 55 percent this year before
today, had plunged in July after its chairman and founder Zhu
Yicai dropped active management of the company.  Tokyo Electric Power soared 10 percent to 141 yen after
Goldman Sachs said the 1 trillion yen government capital
injection that the firm received may pave the way for additional
loans and lessen the chance of additional writedowns.  Teijin tumbled 9.2 percent to 207 yen after cutting its
fiscal-year operating profit forecast by 19 percent after a 73
percent drop in the quarter ended June 30. The stock was the
biggest loser on the Asia-Pacific measure.  To contact the reporters on this story:
