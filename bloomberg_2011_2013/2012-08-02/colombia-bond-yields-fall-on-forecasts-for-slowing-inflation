Colombia ’s peso bonds gained for a
fourth day as speculation that inflation slowed in July buoyed
demand for fixed-rate securities.  The yield on the government’s 10 percent peso-denominated
debt due in 2024 fell six basis points, or 0.06 percentage
point, to 6.60 percent, according to the central bank. The
bond’s price rose 0.55 centavo to 127.525 centavos per peso.  Today’s rally extended the decline in yields on the
benchmark bonds to 17 basis points since the central bank
unexpectedly cut  interest rates  a quarter percentage point to 5
percent on July 27.  Annual inflation  slowed to 3.11 percent in
July from 3.2 percent the previous month, according to the
median forecast of 24 economists in a Bloomberg survey. The
national statistics agency is slated to release figures Aug. 4.  “After the rally following the rate cut, inflation bets
continue to help bonds,” said Jorge Cardozo, an analyst at
Bogota-based brokerage Corredores Asociados SA. “Declines in
food prices will probably drive inflation lower.”  The peso weakened 0.2 percent to 1,790.50 per  U.S. dollar ,
paring its gain this year to 8.3 percent, still the best
performance among all currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
