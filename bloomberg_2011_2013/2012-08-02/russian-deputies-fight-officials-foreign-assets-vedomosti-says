Five Russian lawmakers, representing
parties from  United Russia  to the Communist Party, submitted a
draft law to the lower chamber of parliament that would bar
state and defense officials from possessing assets and bank
accounts overseas,  Vedomosti  said.  Deputies want to apply the ban on families of state
officials as well, the newspaper said. If passed, the initiative
gives officials six months to get rid of assets. Sanctions for
violations may include a fine of 10 million rubles ($310,000)
and as long as five years in jail, Vedomosti said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
