The Danish Bankers Association said
it welcomed a proposal by Business Minister Ole Sohn to create
an external authority to oversee the Copenhagen interbank
offered rate.  The government can’t accept that Cibor fixing be monitored
by the same banks that submit quotes, Sohn said earlier today,
the Borsen newspaper reported.  “The Danish Bankers Association’s sole objective is to
create confidence in Cibor,” the group’s Director Joergen A.
Horwitz said in an e-mailed statement today. “We therefore
welcome the minister’s proposal. A competent, public oversight
authority can help restore confidence in Cibor.”  The Bankers Association has “confidence in Cibor,”
Horwitz said. “But for us, just as for the minister, it’s
crucial that customers and market participants also have
confidence in the rate.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
