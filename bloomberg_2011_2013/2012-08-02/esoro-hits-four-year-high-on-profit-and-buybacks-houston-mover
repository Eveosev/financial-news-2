Tesoro Corp. (TSO) , the largest independent
refiner on the U.S. West Coast, rose to the highest level in
more than four years as profit surged 78 percent and the company
announced a $500 million share buyback plan.  Tesoro  climbed  14 percent to $31.79 at the close in  New
York , the biggest jump since Nov. 21, 2008, and the highest
price since April 2, 2008. Second-quarter net income rose to 
$387 million, or $2.75 a share, from $218 million, or $1.52, 
a year earlier, San Antonio-based Tesoro said in a statement 
today. Per-share profit was 61 cents  more  than the average of 
17 analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Chief Executive Officer Gregory Goff today said the company
will reinstate a 12-cent quarterly dividend, reduce debt, buy
back $500 million in shares and sell pipeline assets into a
master-limited partnership it controls. The planned sale could
generate as much as $450 million, Deutsche Bank AG analyst  Paul Sankey  said in a note today to clients.  “Greg Goff delivered another outstanding result,” said
Sankey, who is based in New York and rates Tesoro the equivalent
of a buy.  Tesoro didn’t set a time frame for the buybacks, according
to the statement.  With refineries in  North Dakota , Utah and  Washington  that
have access to U.S.-produced oil that trades at a discount to
global varieties, Tesoro has seen its value more than  double 
since Goff took over on May 1, 2010. The month before, a
chemical blast at the company’s Anacortes, Washington, plant
killed seven workers, the deadliest U.S. refinery accident since
2005.  The crack spread, a measure of refining profitability,
 averaged  $29.05 a barrel for companies that have plants near new
U.S. crude production. That was the highest total ever in the
April-to-June period, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Independent refiners don’t explore for or produce oil.  To contact the reporter on this story:
