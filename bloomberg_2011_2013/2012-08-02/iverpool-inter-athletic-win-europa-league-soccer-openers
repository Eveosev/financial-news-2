Liverpool,  Inter Milan  and  Athletic
Bilbao  started their Europa League soccer campaigns with
victories in the opening games of the third-qualifying round.  Stewart Downing’s long-range strike in the second half gave
Liverpool a 1-0 win at Gomel of Belarus last night in  Brendan Rodgers ’s first competitive match as manager.  Also playing under new coaches, Marseille began Elie Baup’s
tenure with a 1-1 draw at  Turkey ’s Eskisehirspor, while Guus Hiddink’s Anzhi Makhachkala beat Vitesse Arnhem 2-0 in  Russia .  Inter won 3-0 at Hajduk Split on goals by  Wesley Sneijder ,
Yuto Nagatomo and Philippe Coutinho. Athletic Bilbao, the
runner-up in last season’s all-Spanish final against  Atletico
Madrid , defeated NK Slaven Koprivnica 3-1 at home.  The return matches will be played Aug. 9, with the winners
of the two-game series advancing to the playoffs for a place in
the group stage of  Europe ’s second-tier club competition.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
