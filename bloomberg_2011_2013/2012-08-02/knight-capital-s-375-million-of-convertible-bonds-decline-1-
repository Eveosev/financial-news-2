Knight Capital Group Inc. (KCG) ’s bonds
declined after the firm said yesterday’s stock trading breakdown
will prompt losses of $440 million.  The company’s $375 million of 3.5 percent convertible bonds
due in March 2015 fell 8.625 cents to 74.5 cents on the dollar
and yielded 15.8 percent as of 2:45 p.m. in New York, according
to Trace, the bond-price reporting system of the Financial
Industry Regulatory Authority. The debt traded as low as 40
cents earlier.  Shares of the  Jersey City , New Jersey-based firm  have
plunged  72 percent in the past two days to $2.86 as of 2:57 p.m.
in New York after Knight’s computers helped spur sudden price
swings of 10 percent or more in dozens of companies. The firm,
whose projected loss is almost quadruple its 2011 net  income ,
said today it’s exploring strategic and financial alternatives
to strengthen its capital base.  The bonds are convertible to stock at $20.87 a share.
Investors who own the note can demand repayment upon a
“fundamental change” in the company including a sale for cash
or if a person or group discloses a more than 50 percent
ownership stake in Knight, according to a February regulatory
filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
