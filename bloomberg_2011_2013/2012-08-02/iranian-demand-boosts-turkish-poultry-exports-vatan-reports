Iranian demand for Turkish poultry
has risen sharply in the past month as western sanctions on the
Persian Gulf country have doubled the cost of poultry there,
 Vatan  reported, citing Sait Koca, the chairman of  Turkey â€™s white
meat association and the CEO of poultry company Beypilic.  Turkey exported poultry worth a total of $231 million in
the first six months of the year, 40 percent up on the
comparable period of 2011, and the increase was mainly due to
higher demand from Iran and  Iraq , according to Koca, the Turkish
newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
