Norbert Barthle, a German coalition
lawmaker and ally of Chancellor  Angela Merkel , said there’s no
reason why the temporary euro-area rescue fund shouldn’t buy
government bonds to help ease tensions in the region.  The European Financial Stability Facility “was designed
for moments like this and I don’t see any prima facie reason why
it should not buy bonds as part of a concerted action,”
Barthle, parliamentary budget spokesman for Merkel’s  Christian
Democratic Union , said in a phone interview responding to
European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi ’s announcement.  “Even so, the rules of the fund have to be observed,”
Bathle said. That means summoning the German parliament to vote
on primary-market purchases and the Budget Committee “for
secret deliberations in the secondary market.”  “Of course, I can neither speak for parliament as a whole
or the ECB, but I can say the EFSF was created for a purpose and
bond-buying is in the munual,” Barthle said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
