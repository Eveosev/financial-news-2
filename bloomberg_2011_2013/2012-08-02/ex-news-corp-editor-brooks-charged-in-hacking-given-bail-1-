Rebekah Brooks, the former editor of
 News Corp. (NWSA) ’s now-closed News of the World tabloid in the U.K.,
was was released on bail after being charged with unlawfully
intercepting voice-mail messages of people to get information
for news stories.  Brooks, 44, was ordered to report to Westminster
Magistrates’ Court on Sept. 3, the Metropolitan Police Service
said in a statement yesterday.  Brooks and others including Andrew Coulson, who had been
Prime Minister  David Cameron ’s press chief until the scandal
broke, conspired to hack the mobile-phone messages of more than
600 people between 2000 and 2006, British authorities said.  The alleged victims included actors  Brad Pitt  and Angelina Jolie and the murdered British schoolgirl Milly Dowler, who was
reported missing in 2002.  Brooks was charged with three counts of conspiring to
intercept communications in the course of their transmission,
without lawful authority. One of the counts applied to Dowler
and another to Andrew Gilchrist, a former union leader who sued
News Corp.’s News International unit in February for allegedly
hacking his phone.  Stephen Parkinson, a lawyer for Brooks, didn’t immediately
return an e-mail yesterday after regular business hours in
London.  Daisy Dunlop , a spokeswoman for News International, said in
an e-mail the company had no comment on the charges.  News Corp. chairman  Rupert Murdoch  shut down the 168-year-
old tabloid last year in the wake of the scandal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
