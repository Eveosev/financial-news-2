The Obama campaign responded to
Republican presidential candidate  Mitt Romney ’s choice of
Representative  Paul Ryan  of Wisconsin as his vice presidential
running mate by saying the ticket would take the U.S. back to
“the reckless Bush economic policies that exploded our deficit
and crashed our economy.”  In Ryan, Romney “has chosen a leader of the House
Republicans who shares his commitment to the flawed theory that
new budget-busting tax cuts for the wealthy, while placing
greater burdens on the middle class and seniors, will somehow
deliver a stronger economy,” the Obama campaign statement said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
