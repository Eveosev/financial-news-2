Cia. de Saneamento Basico do
Estado de  Sao Paulo , known as Sabesp and  Brazil ’s biggest water
utility, reported a 39 percent drop in second-quarter profit,
mainly due to currency exchange variations.  Earnings per share also fell by the same amount for the
period ending June 30 from a year ago, Sao Paulo-based Sabesp
said yesterday in a statement. Sabesp serves almost 28 million
people.  Sabesp said net operating revenue rose 5.8 percent to 2.48
billion reais ($1.23 billion) compared with the year-earlier
quarter and that the government of  South America ’s largest city
had authorized a 5.15 percent rise in water and sewage rates
effective Sept. 11. Brazil is the world’s second-biggest
developing economy.  The shares of the world’s fourth-largest sanitation company
in terms of customers have climbed 73 percent this year compared
with a 4.5 percent gain by the Bovespa index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
