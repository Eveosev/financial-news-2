Two  earthquakes  exceeding magnitude
6 struck northwestern Iran, killing at least 250 people and
injuring more than 2,000, Iran’s Press TV said.  The quakes struck the town of Ahar near Tabriz, the capital
of East Azerbaijan province, yesterday, Press TV said on its
 website . Four villages may have been destroyed in the area, it
said, citing unconfirmed reports.  At least 30 people were killed in Ahar and 40 died in
Varzagan, Al Jazeera television said, citing Iran’s semi-
official Fars news agency.  The  U.S. Geological Survey  said the quakes hit within 11
minutes of each other in the late afternoon. The first had a
magnitude of 6.4 with an epicenter 12 miles (20 kilometers)
west-southwest of  Ahar . It was followed by a magnitude-6.3
temblor 19 miles west-southwest of the city, according to the
USGS. Both occurred at a depth of less than 6.2 miles, the USGS
said in advisories on its website.  A 5.1-magnitude temblor occurred 51 miles from Tabriz early
today, the USGS said.  Communications were cut by the quakes and panicked
residents ran into the streets yesterday, according to Fars.  The USGS detected at least five smaller temblors after the
quakes, from magnitude 4.4 to 5.  Iran ’s Mehr news agency
reported 28 aftershocks.  Iran is prone to earthquakes. An estimated 40,000 people
were killed when an earthquake flattened the city of Bam in the
southern province of Kerman in December 2003.  To contact the reporters on this story:
