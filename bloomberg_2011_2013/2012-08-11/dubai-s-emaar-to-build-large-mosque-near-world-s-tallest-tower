Emaar Properties PJSC (EMAAR) , the  developer 
of the world’s tallest tower, said it is building a mosque in
Dubai’s Downtown development that can hold 800 people.  The 40,000 square-foot (3,716 square-meter) structure will
be named Sheikh Zayed Bin Mansour Al Nahyan Mosque after the
United Arab Emirates’ deputy prime minister and minister of
presidential affairs, the Dubai-based company said in an e-
mailed statement today. Emaar didn’t specify the cost of the
structure or the time of completion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
