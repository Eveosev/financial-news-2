Greece ’s inter-ministerial committee
for privatizations approved the sale of state stakes in  Elta SA ,
the country’s postal service, and  Hellenic Vehicle Industry SA .  Greece’s state assets sales  fund  will decide on the sale
process for as much as 100 percent the state owns in Elta, which
will be transferred to the sales fund at a later stage,
according to the  website  for government decisions.  The state will also sell as much as its 57 percent stake in
Hellenic Vehicle Industry SA, a Greek maker of buses and
military vehicles known as Elvo.  Mytilineos Holdings SA (MYTIL)  holds
the remaining shares. The committee appointed I.K. Rokas &
Partners as legal adviser and KPMG LLP as financial adviser for
the sale.  Greece’s postal services market is due to be fully
liberalized from Jan. 1, according to Elta’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
