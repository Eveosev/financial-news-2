Rangers rallied for a 2-2 tie at
Peterhead in their first game in the fourth tier of Scottish
soccer.  Kevin Kyle’s goal in the 90th minute gave Rangers the draw.
Barry McKay put the Glasgow side in front in the 27th minute
before Rory McAllister and Scott McLaughlin scored in the second
half for Peterhead.  Rangers, the 54-time Scottish champion, went into
liquidation in June after U.K. tax authorities rejected a plan
to allow the club to avoid bankruptcy. The club reformed and was
dropped to the lowest level of the Scottish Football League by a
vote of the other teams last month.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
