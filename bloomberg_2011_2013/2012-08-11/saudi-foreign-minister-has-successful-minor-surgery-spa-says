Saudi Arabia’s foreign minister,
Prince Saud Al-Faisal, underwent a successful “minor” surgery,
the Royal Court said in a statement posted on the website of the
Saudi Press Agency today.  “Al-Faisal suffered a minor blockage in the intestines
because of adhesions due to a previous surgery,” the Court
said. He underwent surgery to break the adhesions and he is in a
“stable condition,” it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
