Usain Bolt, the only man to
successfully defend the 100- and 200-meter titles at an
Olympics, went three for three by anchoring his Jamaican team to
a world-record 400-meter relay gold medal in  London .  The defending champions cruised to victory in 36.84 seconds
on the Olympic Stadium track. The U.S. came in second, matching
the old world-record time of 37.04.  Trinidad & Tobago  was third
in 38.12 after  Canada  was disqualified.  Bolt ran the last 100-meter leg, after teammates Nesta
Carter, Michael Frater and Yohan Blake.  “It is always a beautiful thing to end on this note,”
Bolt said in a televised trackside interview. “It is a
wonderful feeling. It was a great Olympics and I am happy. I
wish we could have gone faster, but I guess we leave room for
improvement.”  Jamaica has dominated the event since winning the 2008
Olympics with a world record. It took the world title in Berlin
in 2009, and improved its mark to 37.04 seconds at last year’s
championships in Daegu,  South Korea .  The Jamaicans competed today without Asafa Powell, who is
out for the season after injuring his groin in the 100-meter
final.  It turned out they didn’t need the former 100-meter world
record-holder. Bolt drew even with the U.S.’s Ryan Bailey before
storming down the home straight and leaning across the finish
line.  ‘Bolt, Bolt’  Bolt, who said before the race that a world record was
possible, led the crowd in a wave that drew chants of “Bolt,
Bolt, Bolt” as he returned to the track for the medals
ceremony.  For the Americans, just getting to the finish line had
proven difficult in recent times.  The U.S. quartet, which shattered a 20-year-old national
record yesterday in qualifying for the final, last won the 400-
meter relay at the 2000 Olympics in Sydney. In 2004, the
Americans were upset by the British team, then failed to finish
their heat in Beijing in 2008.  A disqualification came for the U.S. at the world
championships in 2009. In Daegu last year, American sprinter
Darvis Patton was obstructed at the last changeover.  The second-place finish ended Tyson Gay’s wait for an
Olympic medal. He ran the third leg on the silver-medal squad.  Tyson’s Tears  The 29-year-old American, the second-fastest man in the
world all-time behind Bolt, left the track in tears after
placing fourth in the 100-meter final a week ago. Gay was hurt
in Beijing and didn’t make the final of the 100 meters, and it
was his failed baton pass with Patton that resulted in the U.S.
failing to complete its heat four years ago.  “I really feel the missing piece of my heart is an Olympic
medal,” Gay said on the eve of the games.  Justin Gatlin, who took bronze in the 100 meters behind
Bolt and Blake, praised Gay’s efforts, which had the U.S.
marginally ahead before the final leg.  “There was energy coming from the blocks and Tyson did a
great job on the third,” Gatlin said. “We did it, we did a
great job and next year we’re going to do an even better race.”  Two days ago, Bolt won the 200-meter gold medal to complete
a historic sweep of the track sprints that the Jamaican runner
said made him a sports legend.  He became the only man to successfully defend both the 100-
and 200-meter titles at an Olympics, and the first runner to
retain two titles since  Finland ’s Lasse Viren won the 5,000- and
10,000-meters at  Montreal  in 1976. Bolt set an Olympic record of
9.63 seconds when he cruised to his 100-meter victory on Aug. 5.  Apart from Bolt, only eight men have completed the 100- and
200-meter sweep at one Olympics. Of those, only  Carl Lewis  of
the U.S. successfully defended the gold medal in the shorter
race.  To contact the reporter on this story:
