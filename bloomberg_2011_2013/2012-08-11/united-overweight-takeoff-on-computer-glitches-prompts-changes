A computer breakdown caused a  United
Continental Holdings Inc. (UAL)  flight to take off earlier this year
about 20,000 pounds (9,071 kilograms) heavier than pilots
believed, prompting the carrier to add extra checks to ensure
accurate weight calculations.  United sent pilots a weight estimate that assumed the coach
section of the  Boeing Co. (BA)  737-900 was empty when it was full,
according to three people familiar with the incident who asked
not to be named because they weren’t authorized to speak about
it.  While the pilots, who didn’t catch the mistake, had
difficulty getting the jetliner airborne, the plane wasn’t
damaged and the flight was completed without incident, one of
the people familiar with the event said. The pilots reported the
trouble to a United program that encourages employees to
identify safety issues, according to another person.  “Earlier this year, we experienced technology issues in
capturing correct passenger counts on a small number of our
flights,”  Megan McCarthy , a spokeswoman for the airline, said
in an e-mail yesterday.  The incident was recounted in a July 9 bulletin from United
management to its pilots, said one person, who couldn’t say when
the incident occurred.  United and the U.S.  Federal Aviation Administration , which
said the airline reported the breakdowns to it, said they’ve
taken steps to prevent such incidents in the future. United is
requiring its pilots to perform two additional, manual checks on
weight and balance calculations before each flight, the FAA said
in an e-mailed statement.  Difficult Liftoff  “The FAA has been monitoring the situation and is
satisfied with this interim measure while the airline develops a
permanent solution,” the agency said.  United has had computer and operational problems in recent
months as it transitioned to new passenger-service and aircraft
preventive-maintenance systems. Both were used at Continental
Airlines Inc. before it merged with United parent UAL Corp. in
2010.  All airlines estimate a plane’s weight before each flight.
The weight information, along with data on air temperature and
other factors, allows pilots to calculate the precise speed at
which they should lift the nose during takeoff.  If pilots try to take off with too much weight, it can
cause a plane to scrape its tail on the ground or to skid off
the runway without getting airborne, according to accident
reports.  Boeing’s 737-900 models can take off weighing as much as
187,700 pounds (85,141 kilograms), according to Boeing’s
 website . Even fully-loaded jets frequently take off at lower
weights.  Accident History  The incident exposed a safety risk that has caused several
accidents, including a 2004 crash in Canada that killed seven
people, according to accident reports and a recent NASA study.  On March 20, 2009, an Emirates Airlines Airbus SAS A340
carrying 275 people nearly crashed in  Melbourne  after pilots
made a 100,000-kilogram (220,460-pounds) error in pre-takeoff
calculations, according to an Australian Transport Safety Bureau
 report .  One of the pilots accidentally entered a weight of 262,000
kilograms into a laptop used for takeoff calculations instead of
the actual 362,000 kilograms, investigators found. The jet’s
tail skidded on the pavement as it failed to get airborne and
clipped an airport structure before climbing.  “There were no injuries, but this accident was considered
to be a close escape from catastrophe,” a NASA  report  on the
issue published in June said.  Seven people aboard an MK Airlines Ltd. Boeing 747
freighter died on Oct. 14, 2004, after making a 249,000-pound
(113,000 kilograms) error before attempting to take off in
Halifax,  Canada , according to the NASA report.  Typos, Miscalculations  The researchers also found that U.S. pilots had anonymously
told of similar incidents to the Aviation Safety Reporting
System, a NASA-run  program  that gathers safety reports from
pilots and others.  In one such case, pilots at an unspecified carrier reported
taking off 19,000 pounds (8,618 kilograms) heavier than
estimated because an airline employee had listed 33 passengers
instead of 133, according to the report.  “Although relatively few major accidents have yet been
caused by performance data errors, our study suggests that more
accidents are likely to occur unless existing measures to
prevent and catch these errors are improved and new measures
developed,” the report said.  The report recommended technology improvements and
additional cross-checks by pilots to ensure math errors, typos
and other miscalculations don’t become fatal.  Improving Reliability  Chicago-based United became the largest carrier in the
world after merging with Continental two years ago. The joining
of the two airlines has at times led to delays and other issues
as computer systems, labor groups and aircraft fleets were
blended.  United ranked last among 15 U.S. carriers in on-time
arrivals for June, the latest month for which figures are
available, at 70.1 percent, according to U.S. Transportation
Department data. It also ranked last in May at 77.8 percent. It
led in consumer complaints each month since February, according
to the DOT.  “The commitment from the leadership team is to put all the
resources, staffing and money we need into this,” Howard Attarian, United’s vice president of flight operations, said in
an Aug. 2 interview. “The No. 1 priority of the company is to
get back to reliability.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
