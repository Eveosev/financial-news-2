Syrian hurdler Ghfran Almouhamad was
disqualified from the London Games after testing positive for
doping, the  International Olympic Committee  said in a statement.  Almouhamad, 23, provided a test sample on Aug. 3 that
indicated the presence of methylhexaneamine, the IOC said. A
second test confirmed the result of the first.  Almouhamad competed in the womenâ€™s 400-meter hurdles on
Aug. 5 and finished eighth in the second heat of the first
round.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
