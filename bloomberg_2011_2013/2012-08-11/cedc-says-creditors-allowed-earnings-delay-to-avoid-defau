Central European Distribution Corp. (CEDC) 
bondholders agreed late yesterday to the company’s request to
delay release of second-quarter  earnings  until as late as Nov.
12, the company said in a regulatory statement today.  Poland’s second-biggest vodka producer had to secure
consent from a majority of bondholders or publish the results in
30 days to avoid a default and early payment of 430 million
euros ($528 million) of debt due in 2016.  To contact the reporter on this story:
