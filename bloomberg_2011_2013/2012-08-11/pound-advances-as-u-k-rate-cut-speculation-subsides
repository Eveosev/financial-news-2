The pound advanced for the first
time in three weeks against the euro after Bank of England
Governor  Mervyn King  said cutting U.K. interest rates may be
counterproductive.  Sterling reached the highest this month against the dollar
after King’s comments damped speculation policy makers will
reduce borrowing costs to spur growth. Ten-year gilts snapped
two weeks of declines amid bets the Monetary Policy Committee
will expand a bond-buying program to aid the recovery after the
London-based central bank cut its growth forecasts for this year
and next in its quarterly Inflation Report.  “The market had priced in a rate cut as early as
September,” said Sara Yates, a foreign-exchange strategist at
Barclays Plc in London, said by phone. “King dismissed this and
that’s supported sterling. He highlighted the difficulty of
cutting rates in the short term and showed he is a very strong
advocate of bond buying.”  The pound gained 1.1 percent over the week to 78.36 pence
per euro at 4:30 p.m.  London  time yesterday, when it appreciated
to 78.28 pence, the strongest since Aug. 2. The U.K. currency
climbed 0.3 percent to $1.5679, and reached $1.5701, the most
since July 31.  Policy makers have discussed a rate cut and “we concluded,
for the time being, that it would be more counterproductive than
beneficial,” King told reporters at a press conference in
London on Aug. 8. Asset purchases remain the central bank’s main
stimulus instrument, he said.  BOE Forecast  The 10-year gilt yield ended the week down two basis
points, or 0.02 percentage point, at 1.54 percent. The 4 percent
bond maturing in March 2022 gained 0.18, or 1.80 pounds per
1,000-pound face amount, to 121.825.  The  Bank of England  forecast annual gross domestic product
growth of about 2 percent in two years, compared with a
projection in May of 2.5 percent.  U.K. inflation slowed in July to 2.3 percent, the least in
more than 2 1/2 years, according to the median forecast of 35
economists surveyed by Bloomberg News before a report released
on Aug. 14. A day later, the U.K. central bank will release the
minutes of this month’s meeting, showing how officials voted
when they kept their asset-purchase target on hold at 375
billion pounds.  Sterling has advanced 1.9 percent in the past six months,
according to Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes, which track
10 developed-nation currencies. The dollar rose 2.4 percent and
the yen gained 1.5 percent.  Gilts have returned 3.4 percent this year through Aug. 9,
according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. German bunds earned
3.2 percent and  U.S. Treasuries  rose 1.9 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
