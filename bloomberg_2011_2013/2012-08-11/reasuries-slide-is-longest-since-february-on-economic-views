Treasuries fell, pushing the 10-year
note yield to the highest since May, as economic data showed
strength, dimming prospects for added monetary stimulus and
limiting demand for $72 billion of  U.S. debt  sold at auctions.  The benchmark notes  declined  for a third straight week, the
longest stretch since February, as European finance officials
took a pause from recent negotiations to contain the region’s
sovereign-debt crisis. Bond yields showed inflation expectations
rose to the highest in almost four months as retail sales were
forecast to have gained 0.3 percent in July, halting a three-
month string of declines, before a report Aug. 14.  “It’s a response to slightly improving economic data, but
more so, it’s a response to a slight slowdown in the bad news
that’s coming out of  Europe ,” said Aaron Kohli, an interest-
rate strategist BNP Paribas SA in New York, one of the 21
primary dealers that trade with the  Federal Reserve . “The U.S.
is muddling through, even if things aren’t as rosy as we’d like
them to be.”  The 10-year note yield  rose  nine basis points this week, or
0.09 percentage point, to 1.66 percent, according to Bloomberg
Bond Trader prices. The 1.625 percent note due in August 2022
traded at 99 22/32.  Off Lows  The yield reached 1.73 percent on Aug. 9, the highest level
since May 30. It had touched 1.38 percent on July 25, the lowest
ever. The 30-year yield increased 11 basis points to 2.75
percent after touching an all-time low of 2.44 percent on July
26.  The 10-year yield surpassed the level of U.S. consumer-
price increases. U.S. consumer-price inflation slowed to 1.5
percent in July from a year earlier, versus June’s 1.7 percent
reading, according to a Bloomberg survey before the Labor
Department report on Aug. 15.  The figure would translate into a real yield of 17 basis
points, based on today’s 10-year rate. It was negative 2.11
percentage points in October.  The  difference  between yields on 10-year notes and similar-
maturity Treasury Inflation Protected Securities, a gauge of
expectations for consumer prices during the life of the debt,
was 2.27 percentage points yesterday. It reached 2.29 percentage
points on Aug. 7, the highest since April 17. The average during
the past decade is 2.16 percentage points.  Futures Positions  Hedge-fund managers and other large speculators reversed to
a net-short position from a net-long position in 10-year note
futures in the week ending Aug. 7, according to U.S. Commodity
Futures Trading Commission data.  Speculative short positions, or bets prices will fall,
outnumbered long positions by 14,595 contracts on the Chicago
Board of Trade.  Last week, traders were net-long 2,055
contracts.  U.S. government securities have returned 1.9 percent this
year as of Aug. 9, versus 7.7 percent for an index of
investment-grade and high-yield company debt, according to Bank
of America Merrill Lynch data. The  MSCI All-Country World Index (MXWD) 
of stocks handed investors a 10 percent gain including
reinvested dividends, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Demand waned at sales of Treasury three-, 10- and 30-year
securities this week. The 10-year auction on Aug. 8 drew  bids 
for 2.49 times the amount of debt available, the least since
August 2009, dropping from 3.61 at the prior sale on July 11.  Economic Data  “There was generally more positive data,” said Michael Pond, co-head of interest-rate strategy in New York at Barclays
Plc, a primary dealer. “The market was also dealing with
supply, and so a concession was built in for there.”  The U.S. government’s budget deficit narrowed as spending
dropped by 11.9 percent from a year earlier and some payments
were accelerated to the previous month for calendar-related
reasons. The deficit  through July  for the 2012 fiscal year,
which ends Sept. 30, is $973.8 billion compared with $1.1
trillion at this point last year and the lowest for July since
2008.  The gap for July shrank 46 percent to $69.6 billion from a
$129.4 billion shortfall in July 2011, the Treasury Department
said yesterday in  Washington . Last month’s gap was smaller than
the projected $90 billion deficit, according to the median
estimate in a Bloomberg News survey. For the first 10 months of
this fiscal year the deficit was 11.5 percent narrower than in
the year-earlier period.  Monetary Stimulus  The U.S. central bank has held  interest rates  near zero
since 2008 and plans to keep them there through 2014 to
stimulate the world’s biggest economy. The Fed has also bought
$2.3 trillion of mortgage and Treasury debt from 2008 to 2011 in
two rounds of so-called quantitative easing, or QE.  The economy added 163,000 jobs in July, a government report
showed Aug. 3, more than the 100,000 projected by economists.
Initial claims for  unemployment insurance  unexpectedly dropped
by 6,000 to 361,000 last week, a report showed Aug. 9.  Retail sales rose 0.3 percent in July, according to the
median forecast of 45 economists in a Bloomberg News survey
before the Commerce Department report in Washington. The three
months of declines in the prior months was the longest such
streak since the period from July through December of 2008.  “Retail sales will be key as to giving the market short-
term confirmation as to whether QE probability is more or
less,” said Shyam Rajan, an interest-rate strategist at Bank of
America Corp. in New York, a primary dealer. “Our view is the
data will remain weak through August and September and the Fed
will launch QE.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
