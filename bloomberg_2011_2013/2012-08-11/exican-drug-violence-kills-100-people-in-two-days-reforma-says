A resurgence of drug-related
violence in Mexico has cost the lives of about 100 people in the
past two days,  Reforma  reported.  The latest confrontations bring the death toll in the first
10 days of August to 283 people, the Mexico City-based newspaper
said today. In one incident, drug traffickers attacked a
hospital in Mugica after injured police officers were taken
there.  To contact the reporter on this story:
