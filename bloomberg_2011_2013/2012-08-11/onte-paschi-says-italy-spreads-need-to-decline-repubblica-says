Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena SpA 
chief executive officer said Italian government bond spreads
need to fall by the end of the year to avert “strong”
contagion to the economy, La Repubblica reported.  The  European Central Bank , the European Financial Stability
Facility and the European Stability Mechanism must purchase
 government bonds  in the primary and secondary markets, Fabrizio Viola told the newspaper in an interview published today.  Viola said he doesn’t expect a reversal of trends including
the bank’s rising bad loans and writedowns in 2012, according to
the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
