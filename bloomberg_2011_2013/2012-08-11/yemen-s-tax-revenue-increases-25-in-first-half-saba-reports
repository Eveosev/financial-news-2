Yemen’s tax revenue increased by 25
percent to 233 billion rials ($1 billion) in the first six
months of the year compared with the same period in 2011, the
state-run SABA news agency reported, citing Ahmed Ghalib, head
of the tax authority.  Revenue declined last year as political unrest led to power
outages and fuel shortages, cutting factory output, SABA said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
