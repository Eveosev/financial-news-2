Asian  stocks  rose this week, with
the benchmark index posting its biggest weekly gain since
January, as economic data from the U.S. boosted confidence in
the world’s largest economy amid speculation China will do more
to support growth.  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) , Asia’s biggest carmaker by market value,
rose 3.4 percent this week in  Tokyo .  Rio Tinto  Group, the
world’s third-largest mining company, jumped 8.5 percent in
Sydney after earnings beat estimates. Aluminum Corp. of China
Ltd., the nation’s No. 1 supplier of the light metal, gained 7.3
percent in Hong Kong as commodity prices advanced.  DeNA (2432)  Co., the
Japanese operator of the Mobage social gaming network, soared 27
percent after its operating profit beat analyst estimates.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  rose 3 percent to 120.50 this
week, its biggest weekly advance since the five days ended Jan.
20. The gauge pared its gain on Aug. 10 as reports showed
China’s exports and new lending missed estimates and Singapore’s
economy unexpectedly contracted in the second quarter.  For the U.S., “expectations have been cut substantially,
so even a weak number will appear to be a good number,” said
 Binay Chandgothia , a Hong Kong-based portfolio manager at
Principal Global Investors, which manages $250 billion globally.
“If you look at policy noise out of China, it is kind of
turning to supporting growth. Markets are reasonably cheap.”  The Asia-Pacific measure retreated 8.5 percent from a Feb.
29 high through yesterday as Europe’s deepening debt crisis and
slower growth in the U.S. and China damped the outlook for
global demand.  Relative Value  Stocks on the index were valued at about 12.4 times
estimated earnings on average, compared with about 13.6 times
for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average gained 3.9 percent this
week, its biggest weekly gain since February, even after the
 Bank of Japan  refrained from adding stimulus to the economy and
machinery orders in the nation rebounded less than forecast.  Hong Kong ’s  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  climbed 2.4 percent, while
China’s Shanghai Composite Index rose 1.7 percent. Taiwan’s
Taiex Index advanced 3.1 percent, while South Korea’s Kospi
Index jumped 5.3 percent after the nation left its key  interest
rate  unchanged.  Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index gained 1.3 percent. The
nation’s employers added more jobs last month than economists
estimated, and the  Reserve Bank  of Australia raised its 2012
growth forecast on stronger-than-expected consumer demand.  Singapore Growth  Singapore’s  Straits Times Index (FSSTI)  gained 0.1 percent in a
week that was shortened by a holiday. The city state on Aug. 8
cut the upper end of its economic growth forecast for 2012 amid
the global slowdown.  Shares in Asia rose this week after a Labor Department
report showed U.S. payrolls climbed more than forecast even as
the jobless rate unexpectedly rose. Growth in the services
industry accelerated from a month earlier in July.  The rally in stocks gained strength as members of German
Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s coalition parties signaled they won’t
stand in the way of European Central Bank President  Mario
Draghi ’s bond plan to relieve the region’s debt crisis.  Toyota climbed 3.4 percent to 3,170 yen in Tokyo this week,
while Samsung Electronics Co., which gets 39 percent of its
sales in Europe and the Americas, rose 8.5 percent to 1.348
million won in Seoul.  Techtronic Industries Co. (669) , the maker of
Ryobi power tools that gets 72 percent of revenue from the U.S.,
climbed 5.5 percent to HK$10.70 in Hong Kong.  ‘Still Weak’  China’s inflation cooled for a fourth month. Consumer
prices rose 1.8 percent from a year earlier in July, after a
gain of 2.2 percent in June, the National Bureau of Statistics
said on Aug. 9. China’s producer-price index fell 2.9 percent,
while industrial production grew 9.2 percent from a year earlier
in July, missing the median analyst estimate of 9.7 percent.  “Asia’s economy is still weak, but as liquidity returns to
risky assets in U.S. and Europe, it’s coming into this region as
well,” said Koji Toda, chief  fund manager  at Resona Bank Ltd.
in Tokyo, which oversees the equivalent of $190 billion.
“China’s inflation has calmed, making it easier for policy
measures to happen. There’s some optimism Asia’s economies will
improve.”  Bank of Communications Co. , the mainland’s fifth-largest
lender, rose 1.7 percent to HK$5.27 in Hong Kong. Poly (Hong
Kong) Investments Ltd., which develops, invests and manages
properties in China, jumped 8.6 percent to HK$4.30. Komatsu Ltd.,
a Japanese construction-equipment maker that gets about 12
percent of its revenue from China, climbed 3.5 percent to 1,677
yen in Tokyo.  Energy Stocks  Rio Tinto (RIO)  jumped 8.5 percent to A$56.45 in Sydney after its
first-half profit of $5.9 billion beat the $5.04 billion average
of analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Inpex Corp., Japan’s
top energy explorer, gained 9.5 percent to 468,500 yen in Tokyo
after raising its full-year earnings forecasts. Aluminum Corp.
of China jumped 7.3 percent to HK$3.40 in Hong Kong.  Of the 390 companies in the Asia-Pacific index that have
reported earnings since May 16, and for which Bloomberg has
estimates, 55 percent have failed to meet projections.  DeNA soared 27 percent to 2,210 yen in Tokyo, jumping by
the most yesterday, after posting an operating profit of 18.4
billion yen ($235 million) for the three months ended June 30,
beating the 17.6 billion yen average of analyst estimates
compiled by Bloomberg.  Li & Fung Ltd. (494) , a supplier of clothes and toys to retailers,
plunged 12 percent to HK$12.90 in Hong Kong after slowdowns in
U.S. and Europe caused a 22 percent slump in first half
operating profit.  Among other stocks that fell,  Oki Electric Industry Co. (6703) ,
which through Aug. 8 was the best-performing stock this year in
the  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY) , plunged 22 percent to 91 yen. The
ATM maker said its Spain unit overstated accounts and it will
miss the deadline for filing financial reports, prompting the
Tokyo bourse to put the company on watch for possible delisting.  To contact the reporters on this story:
