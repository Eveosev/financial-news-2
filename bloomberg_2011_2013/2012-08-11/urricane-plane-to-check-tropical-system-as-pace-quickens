The seventh tropical depression of
the  Atlantic hurricane season  picked up speed as it churned west
toward the Windward Islands, prompting the U.S. to send a
hurricane reconnaissance aircraft today to investigate.  Tropical storm watches were issued for Guadeloupe,
Martinique, Dominica,  St. Lucia , Barbados and St. Vincent
warning about the system 235 miles (380 kilometers) east-
northeast of Barbados. The storm, moving at 24 miles per hour,
has sustained 35 mph winds, the  National Hurricane Center  said.  A tropical storm watch means at least 39 mph winds may
strike the resort islands. After passing the Windwards and
probably growing into a tropical storm, the system is forecast
to dissipate in 48 hours due to unfavorable upper-level winds,
the Miami-based NHC said in a 5 a.m. Atlantic time advisory.  A system off southern  Mexico ’s Pacific coast that’s
partially associated with the remnants of the former Atlantic
Hurricane Ernesto is given a 90 percent chance of re-forming
into a tropical depression this weekend, the NHC also said.  Tropical Storm Gilma’s winds weakened to 45 mph from 60 mph
about 675 miles from the tip of  Baja California , the center said
as well today. It’s no theat to land.  Forecasters are also tracking another potential storm in
the Atlantic near the Cape Verde Islands that has a 20 percent
chance of becoming a tropical cyclone within two days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
