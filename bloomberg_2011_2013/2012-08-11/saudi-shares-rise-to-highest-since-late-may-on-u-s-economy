Shares in  Saudi Arabia (SASEIDX) , the Arab
world’s biggest stock market, climbed to their highest since
late May on valuations and optimism in the U.S.  Etihad Etisalat Co. (EEC) , a Saudi Arabian telecommunications
operator, had its biggest gain since April 1.  Saudi British Bank (SABB) 
reached its highest close in more than a month while  Arab
National Bank (ARNB)  jumped the most in a week.  The Tadawul All Share Index gained 0.5 percent to 6,987.06,
the highest since May 29, at the close in Riyadh. The measure
has risen 8.9 percent this year. U.S. stocks rose for the fifth
week, giving the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index the longest rally
since March, amid better-than-expected earnings and optimism
that global central banks will take actions to stimulate growth.  “Usually around this time, end of Ramadan, investors lose
interest and tend to book profit ahead of the holidays,” Asim Bukhtiar, head of research at Riyad Capital, said in a phone
interview. “This year, valuations for banks and telecoms are
quite attractive and optimism in the U.S. about a recovery is
helping lift stocks here.”  Etihad Etisalat gained 2.3 percent to 67.5 riyals. Saudi
British Bank, 40 percent owned by HSBC Holdings Plc, rose 2.1
percent to 33.7 riyals. Arab National Bank added 1.7 percent to
29.5 riyals.  Saudi Arabia ’s stock exchange is the only Persian Gulf
bourse operating on Saturdays.  To contact the reporter on this story:
