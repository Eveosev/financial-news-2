New York  Yankees left-hander CC Sabathia, experiencing a painful pitching elbow, has been placed
on the 15-day disabled list for the second time in the 2012
Major League Baseball season.  Manager  Joe Girardi  announced the decision yesterday after
New York won 5-2 at the  Toronto Blue Jays  for their fourth
straight win. Sabathia, 32, had been scheduled to pitch tomorrow
against Texas.  The pain may be the result of inflammation, according to
the team’s doctors, Girardi said.  “That’s what you have when you’re a pitcher,” he said.
“So you deal with it.”  Sabathia is 12-3 with a 3.56 ERA this season. He missed 18
games starting in late June with a strained left groin.  Girardi said Sabathia felt soreness in the elbow after his
win three days ago at the Detroit Tigers, in which he allowed
five runs in 6 2/3 innings. The manager told reporters that
putting the left-hander on the disabled list was a precautionary
move, and that the injury did not appear to be significant.  In five starts since coming off the disabled list on July
17, Sabathia is 3-0 with a 3.89 ERA.  To contact the reporter on this story:
