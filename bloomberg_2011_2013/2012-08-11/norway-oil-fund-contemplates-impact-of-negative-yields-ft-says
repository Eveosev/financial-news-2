Norway’s sovereign wealth fund is
considering the impact on its investment strategy of negative
yields for German, Danish and Swiss two-year bonds, Yngve Slyngstad, head of Norges Bank Investment Management,  told  the
Financial Times.  “We are spending a lot of time thinking about what this is
indicating,” Slyngstad said. “We have to ask the obvious
question of why investors are paying for lending money and are
not just keeping it in cash.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
