General Motors Co. (GM)  is recalling
about 36,000 Chevrolet Impala police cars to replace part of the
suspension that may fracture and cause loss of control of the
vehicle.  The manufacturer will fix free of charge both front control
arms, which form part of the police sedan’s suspension, for the
model years 2008-2012 starting Aug. 21, the U.S. National
Highway Traffic Safety Administration said on its website. Non-
police Chevrolet Impala vehicles for those model years aren’t
affected by the safety recall, the agency said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
