President  Francois Hollande ’s first
100 days in office have left 54 percent of the French surveyed
by Ifop unhappy with his performance and 51 percent said they
think the country is changing for the worse, Le Figaro said
today, citing the pollster.  Forty percent think the countries that use the euro can
work together to resolve the economic crisis; a third say he can
cut  France ’s debt and public deficit; and 27 percent said he can
lower unemployment, the newspaper said, citing the poll.  The measures Hollande has taken since being elected were
more popular as 82 percent approved of the 30 percent salary cut
he and his ministers took, 75 percent backed the withdrawal of
combat troops from  Afghanistan , 71 percent favor the return to
retirement at 60 for some workers, and 59 percent backed the 2
percent increase in the minimum wage, Figaro said.  Ifop surveyed 1,004 people from Aug. 6 to 8 using an online
questionnaire for Figaro. No margin of error was given.  To contact the reporter on this story:
