Erste Group Bank AG (EBS) ’s exposure to
Czech sovereign bonds and deposits at the Czech National Bank is
“significantly higher” than the lender’s investments into
Austrian bonds, Chief Risk Officer Gernot Mittendorfer told
 Lidove Noviny  in an interview.  The lender has an “optimistic” view on the Czech market,
which is a “key” for Erste, and doesn’t have any interest in
withdrawing money from its Czech unit in order to invest it in
other countries, Mittendorfer, former chief executive officer of
Erste’s Czech unit Ceska Sporitelna AS, told the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
