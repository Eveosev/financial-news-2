Oberweis China Opportunities Fund (OBCHX) ,
the best-performing U.S.-based fund investing in Chinese stocks,
said Internet companies from  NQ Mobile Inc. (NQ)  to  Qihoo 360
Technology Co. (QIHU)  will extend a rally after jumping more than
three-fold this year.  NQ, a developer of mobile-security software, gained 4.7
percent last week, extending its 2013 surge to 278 percent.
Qihoo, an online security company, increased 13 percent this
month and is set for a 197 percent advance this year. The
Bloomberg China-US Equity Index of the most-traded Chinese
stocks in the U.S. climbed 0.8 percent in a third weekly gain.  China , which last year overtook the U.S. as the world’s
biggest smartphone market, will capture 35 percent of global
handsets shipment this year, up from 30 percent in 2012,
according to Bloomberg Industries. Recent data have signaled a
recovery in the world’s second-largest economy. While the
Shanghai Composite  Index (HSCEI)  rebounded 12 percent from a four-year
low on June 27, the measure still trades at a 17 percent
discount on average to those in the MSCI  Emerging Markets  Index.  “We are still extraordinarily bullish on China, and to
justify the relatively low valuations we see, the nation’s
growth rate would have to be much worse,” Jim Oberweis, the co-manager of the $158 million fund, said in a telephone interview
on Sept. 18. “The monetization of Qihoo’s mobile app could
become an important driver for its earnings in 2014. Growth in
use of smartphones made by companies like Samsung is helping
driving mobile security demand.”  Earnings Increase  Oberweis  forecasts  Qihoo’s earnings will grow 60 percent to
70 percent in 2014, while NQ is likely to increase profit by 30
percent next year.  The fund, started in 2005, has returned 39 percent this
year, the best among 39 U.S.-listed funds investing in Chinese
stocks, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “Even after a pretty good year so far, valuations are
still attractive,” Oberweis said. “It’s become more expensive,
but some names are still significantly below their true value
based on our earnings expectations.”  Companies on the China-US measure for New York-traded
stocks  reached  a five-month high of 13.3 times estimated profit
last week, still 27 percent below a multiple of 18.1 reached in
May 2012. The Shanghai stock benchmark traded at 9.6 times
forward earnings, compared with 11.5 for the MSCI gauge for
emerging-market equities.  Taper Speculation  Chinese stocks traded in the U.S. slumped on Sept. 20,
paring earlier gains in the week, after Federal Reserve Bank of
St. Louis President  James Bullard , a voter on policy this year,
said a small tapering of bond buying is possible next month. The
Fed announced Sept. 18 that it will maintain its pace of bond
purchases, which stoked a global rally in stocks.  Sohu.com Inc. (SOHU) , which  sold  a stake in its search unit to
 Tencent Holdings Ltd. (700) , advanced 11 percent for the week to
$72.06. It retreated 5.9 percent Sept. 20. Tencent, China’s
biggest Internet company by market value, paid $448 million for
a 36.5 percent stake in Sohu’s Sogou unit last week and merge
its own search service with Sogou.  Sohu’s slump is just “volatility driven by hype on these
partnerships and agreements,” David Riedel, president of Riedel
Research Group Inc. in  New York , said by phone. “We still think
Sohu is a good company, and see upside to the current price. The
correction is a buying opportunity.”  E-House China Holdings Ltd. (EJ) , a real estate brokerage,
gained 9.2 percent to $9.70, extending it advance to a third
week. Its American depositary receipts retreated 3.1 percent
Sept. 20 from the highest level since May 2011.  General Valuation  Web clothing retailer  Vipshop Holdings Ltd. (VIPS)  surged 27
percent to $60 last week, rallying the most since the week ended
Feb. 8. E-Commerce China Dangdang Inc. jumped 11 percent in the
steepest climb in six weeks to $9.84.  Phoenix New Media Ltd. (FENG) , a TV and Internet news outlet,
gained 11 percent last week to $11.66 in New York, bringing its
surge this year to 220 percent.  “Some smaller companies that are not involved in
acquisition activities are also benefiting as the general
valuation for Chinese companies has risen,” Tan Chiheng, an
analyst at Granite Point Capital Inc., which invests in Chinese
equities, said by phone from  Boston .  The iShares China Large-Cap  ETF (FXI) , the largest Chinese
exchange-traded fund in the U.S., climbed 0.6 percent last week
to $38.43 in New York. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slipped
0.7 percent Sept. 20 for a weekly rally of 1.3 percent.  The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index jumped 2.2 percent to
10,769.54 in a shortened week. The Shanghai Composite Index
retreated 2 percent to 2,191.85 in the three-day week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
