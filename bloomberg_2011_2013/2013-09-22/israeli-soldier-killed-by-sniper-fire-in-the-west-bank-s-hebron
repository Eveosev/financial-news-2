An Israeli soldier was shot and
died of his wounds late yesterday after gunfire was directed at
troops patrolling the Jewish settlement in the West Bank city of
Hebron.  Israeli security forces are searching the Hebron area for
the perpetrators, the army said in an e-mailed statement. About
500 Jewish settlers live in the city of a quarter-million
Palestinians, in a guarded neighborhood close to a holy site
said to house the tomb of the biblical patriach Abraham.  “Anyone who tries to uproot us from the city of our
forefathers will achieve the opposite,” Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu said today in an e-mailed statement. “We
will continue on one hand to fight terror, and on the other to
strengthen settlements.”  The soldier killed today is the second Israeli to die a
violent death in the West Bank during the past few days. On
Sept. 21 the army said an Israeli man was killed by a
Palestinian who worked with him at a Tel Aviv-area restaurant
and had planned to use the body as a negotiating asset in a bid
to free a relative imprisoned in an Israeli jail.  Israeli Economy Minister Naftali Bennett, who opposes the
peace talks with the Palestinians, sent a letter to Netanyahu
yesterday demanding a discussion on the recent acts of violence
against Israelis.  “The answer to terror must be war directed at murderers,
not discussions with those that encourage murder,” Bennett said
in the letter, according to an e-mailed statement from his
office.  To contact the reporter on this story:
