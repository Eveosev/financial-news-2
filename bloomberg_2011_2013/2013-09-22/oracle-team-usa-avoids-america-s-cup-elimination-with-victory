elimination in sailing’s America’s Cup by defeating Emirates
Team New Zealand.  The victory on San Francisco Bay today leaves the defending 
champions behind 8-4 in the series. Another race is set for this 
afternoon.  New Zealand needs one win to clinch the latest version of
the 162-year-old competition. The USA team, bankrolled by Oracle
