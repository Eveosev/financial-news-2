The  New York  Jets have a 2-1 record
behind their rookie quarterback and the  New York Giants  are 0-3
for the first time since 1996 after the most lopsided loss of
coach  Tom Coughlin ’s 10-year tenure.  Geno Smith threw two touchdown passes and ran for another
as the Jets beat the  Buffalo Bills  27-20 yesterday in a matchup
of the top two quarterbacks taken in this year’s  National
Football League  draft. Smith threw a 69-yard touchdown pass to
Santonio Holmes midway through the fourth quarter to snap a
20-20 tie after the Bills had erased a 14-point deficit at
MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey.  “The game on the line, the ball in your hands, that’s the
moment you live for, that’s the moment you dream of as a kid,”
Smith said. “You always want to be in that moment and you
always want to be successful. It was good to do that.”  Smith, who finished with 331 passing yards, also threw a
51-yard touchdown pass and ran for an eight-yard score. He was
drafted with the seventh pick in the second round, 23 selections
after Bills quarterback E.J. Manuel, who was sacked eight times
by the Jets’ defense.  The Giants, who started 5-2 or better in each of Coughlin’s
first nine seasons, were routed 38-0 at the Carolina Panthers to
fall to 0-3. Cam Newton threw three touchdown passes and also
ran for a score as the Panthers sent the Giants to their worst
shutout loss since Nov. 4, 1973, when they were routed 42-0 by
the  Oakland Raiders .  The  Miami Dolphins  improved to 3-0 for the first time since
2002 by beating the Atlanta Falcons 27-23 on Ryan Tannehill’s 1-yard touchdown pass to Dion Sims with 38 seconds remaining. It
was one of three Week 3 games in which a team was trailing and
scored the winning points in the final minute.  Late Rallies  The  Cleveland Browns  beat the winless Minnesota Vikings
31-27 on Brian Hoyer’s seven-yard touchdown pass to Jordan Cameron with 51 seconds left, while the Tennessee Titans got
past the San Diego Chargers 20-17 on Jake Locker’s 34-yard
touchdown pass to Justin Hunter with 15 seconds left.  The Seattle Seahawks improved to 3-0 as Russell Wilson
threw four touchdown passes in a 45-17 rout of the winless
Jacksonville Jaguars. The  New England Patriots  are unbeaten
through three games for the first time since 2007 after a 23-3
home win against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers (0-3). The  Chicago
Bears  are also 3-0 after a 40-23 win over the Pittsburgh
Steelers, who fell to 0-3 for the first time since 2000.  Richardson’s Debut  The  Indianapolis Colts  knocked off the defending National
Football Conference-champion 49ers 27-7 in San Francisco as
Trent Richardson,  Andrew Luck  and  Ahmad Bradshaw  all had rushing
touchdowns. Richardson made his Colts debut after being acquired
in a trade with the Cleveland Browns earlier in the week and
scored on a 1-yard run to cap the game’s opening drive.  The Cincinnati Bengals (2-1) scored three straight
touchdowns to erase a 30-14 deficit and pull out a 34-30 victory
over the Green Bay Packers (1-2), the Detroit Lions ended a 21-game losing streak in Washington with a 27-20 win over the
Redskins, and the Dallas Cowboys rolled past the St. Louis Rams
31-7 to improve to 2-1.  Elsewhere yesterday, it was Baltimore 30, Houston 9 and New
Orleans 31,  Arizona  7. Week 3 play, which began with the Kansas
City Chiefs winning 26-16 in Philadelphia against the Eagles
(1-2), concludes tonight with  Peyton Manning  and the 2-0 Denver
Broncos hosting the Oakland Raiders.  Jets Win  The Jets pulled out the home win against the Bills by
overcoming two interceptions by Smith and a franchise-record 20
penalties for 168 yards. New York finished with 513 yards of
offense and stopped the Bills on a fourth-down play with 1:43
remaining as Manuel threw a deep pass out of bounds.  “How many games are you going to win when you turn the
ball over twice and commit 20 penalties?” Jets coach  Rex Ryan 
said. “We have to get rid of the self-inflicted things.”  Bilal Powell had 149 rushing yards on 27 carries for the
Jets, while Holmes and Hill each topped 100 receiving yards.  The Panthers, after blowing fourth-quarter leads in losses
to Seattle and Buffalo in an 0-2 start, sacked Giants
quarterback Eli Manning seven times at Bank of America Stadium
in  Charlotte . Manning finished with 119 passing yards and was
intercepted once, while the Giants were outgained 194 to 60 in
rushing yardage.  No NFL team has reached the playoffs since 1998 after
beginning the season 0-3 and the Giants’ next game is against
the unbeaten Chiefs.  “Disappointing is not a strong enough word,” Coughlin
said at a news conference. “I expected more.”  Rookie Improvement  Tom Brady  helped lead the Patriots past the Buccaneers by
throwing two touchdown passes to rookie wide receiver Kenbrell
Thompkins, who struggled with running routes and had only six
catches while being targeted 21 times in the first two games.  “They’ve worked really hard to understand what we’re
trying to do on a weekly basis,” Brady said of Thompkins and
fellow rookie wideout Aaron Dobson, who had a team-high seven
catches for 52 yards. “It changes up a lot with our offense.”  Brady has thrown a touchdown pass in 51 straight games,
three shy of the NFL record held by  Drew Brees  of the Saints.  In Cincinnati,  Andy Dalton  threw two second-half touchdown
passes for the Bengals while Terence Newman scored on a 58-yard
fumble return with 3:47 remaining. It was among eight turnovers
for the game, in which the Bengals blew a 14-point lead against
the Packers and then rallied from a 16-point deficit.  It marked the first time since 1999 that an NFL team won a
game in which they allowed 30 straight points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
