England  and France’s top rugby
clubs confirmed plans for a breakaway European tournament to
start next season, after efforts to change to the current
 Heineken Cup  competition failed.  England’s  Premiership Rugby  and France’s  Ligue Nationale de
Rugby  released a joint  statement  today saying that the new
tournament, called the Rugby Champions Cup, will be open to
clubs from other European nations.  “The competition will be based on the principles of
qualification on merit, a strong competition format, equality
between the leagues, higher commercial values for the teams and
expansion into new European markets,” the clubs said.  The rugby world has been waiting for concrete details on
the new tournament ever since the English and French first
announced their proposal in a Sept. 10 statement, which said
that negotiations with Ireland,  Wales ,  Scotland  and  Italy  to
overhaul the Heineken Cup were at an end.  Today’s statement sheds little light on the breakaway
competition apart from its name and to announce a joint working
group “to prepare all necessary elements in good time for the
2014-15 season.”  Further information about the competition’s format and
commercial details will be made public next month, the clubs
added in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
