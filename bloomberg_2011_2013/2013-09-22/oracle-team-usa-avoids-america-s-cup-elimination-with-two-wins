Oracle Team USA again held off
elimination in the America’s Cup by defeating Emirates Team New
Zealand today in both races on San Francisco Bay.  The victories leave the defending champions behind 8-5
in the series, with more racing set for tomorrow.  New Zealand needs one more win to clinch the latest version
of the 162-year-old sailing competition. The USA team,
bankrolled by Oracle Corp. chief executive  Larry Ellison , has to
win the next four races to retain the Auld Mug.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
