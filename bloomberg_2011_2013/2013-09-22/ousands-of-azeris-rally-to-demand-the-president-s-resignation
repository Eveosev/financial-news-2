Thousands of opposition supporters
demanded the resignation of Azerbaijan’s President  Ilham Aliyev 
at a rally in the capital Baku today.  Aliyev is seeking a third term in office in the Oct. 9
election. His challenger is Camil Hasanli, a history professor
at Baku State University, who was nominated last month by the
National Council of Democratic Forces, a coalition of opposition
parties and groups. The group’s initial choice, Oscar-winning
screenwriter Rustam Ibrahimbayov, was disqualified from running
for holding Russian citizenship.  “There is a war being fought in Azerbaijan between good
and evil,” Hasanli, 61, told the crowd in Baku’s Mahsul stadium
today. “This is a war between justice and injustice, between
national and anti-national forces. We will win.”  Aliyev, 51, succeeded his father Heydar Aliyev in disputed
presidential elections 10 years ago. His family has ruled the
energy-rich Caspian Sea nation for more than 40 years.  Azerbaijan  ranks among the most repressive countries in the
world, in part for its intolerance toward opposition groups,
according to Freedom House, a Washington-based democracy
advocate partly funded by the U.S. government.  To contact the reporter on this story:
