BlackBerry Ltd. (BB)  has suspended the
introduction this weekend of its instant-messaging platform for
users of  Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s iPhone and phones based on  Google Inc. (GOOG) ’s
Android software while it fixes issues with the application.  BlackBerry Messenger, or BBM as it is more commonly known,
will still work for iPhone users who have downloaded it, the
Waterloo, Ontario-based company said in a blog  posting . An
unofficial version for Android that was posted online is at the
root of the problem and has been disabled, the company said.  BlackBerry decided earlier this year to make the free app
available to rival platforms in a bid to shore up the popularity
of its platform, which has been losing market share to Apple and
Android for years. Last week, BlackBerry said it will cut 4,500
jobs and take a charge of as much as $960 million for unsold
smartphone inventory as it fights to return to profitability.  BlackBerry said in the blog posting that more than 1.1
million Android users downloaded BBM in the first eight hours it
was available. The company will resume a staggered rollout of
the app for iPhone and Android as soon as it can.  To contact the reporters on this story:
