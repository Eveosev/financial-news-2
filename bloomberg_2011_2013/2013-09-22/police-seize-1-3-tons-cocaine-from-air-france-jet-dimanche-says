French police seized 1.3 metric
tons (2,866 pounds) of pure cocaine carried on an Air  France 
passenger plane from Caracas as well as 400 kilograms (881
pounds) transported by truck, Journal Du Dimanche reported,
citing comments by prosecutors in Nanterre yesterday.  Prosecutors held a press conference in the Paris suburb, at
which France’s Interior Minister Manuel Valls was present, to
discuss the haul, an Interior Ministry spokesman said by phone
today. He declined to confirm details reported by the newspaper,
referring calls to prosecutors, who couldn’t immediately be
reached.  “Air France is cooperating closely with the Interior
Ministry, which has requested maximum confidentiality in this
investigation,” airline spokesman Herve Erschler said by
telephone today. An internal investigation is also under way, he
said.  The contraband, confiscated on Sept. 11, was stored in 31
suitcases checked in by passengers who didn’t board the plane,
Journal Du Dimanche reported. The second seizure was from a
truck destined for Luxembourg from the eastern part of France,
the newspaper said.  The drugs were seized after an investigation by French
judicial police collaborating with their Spanish, British and
Dutch counterparts that was under way for several weeks,
according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
