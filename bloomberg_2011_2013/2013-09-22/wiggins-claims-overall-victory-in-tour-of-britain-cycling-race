Bradley Wiggins won the  Tour of
Britain  cycling race after finishing in the peloton in the final
stage of the eight-day tour.  The 33-year-old Team Sky rider, who became Britain’s first
Tour de France winner in 2012, led the race from stage three and
maintained the 26-second advantage he held going into the last
day.  Wiggins’s compatriot Mark Cavendish of Omega Pharma won
today’s 55-mile stage, a 10-lap race through central London, to
complete his third stage victory of the tour.  Switzerland’s Martin Elmiger, of IAM Cycling, took second
place overall while Britain under-23 rider Simon Yates claimed
third spot on the podium.  Wiggins, the current Olympic time-trial champion, pulled
out of the Giro d’Italia earlier this year and missed the Tour
de  France  with a knee injury. After today’s win he told ITV
Sport that his absence from the Tour de France spurred him on.  “From that day on I got back to what I do best -- training
hard and having goals that I really want to win, and this is one
of them,” Wiggins said.  Wiggins’s next target is the  World Championships  time-trial
in  Italy  on Sept. 25. Four days later he’s planning on being
part of the team helping 2013 Tour de France winner Chris Froome
win the World Championships road race.  To contact the reporter on this story:
