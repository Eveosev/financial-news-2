The Philadelphia Phillies removed
the interim tag from Hall of Famer Ryne Sandberg’s manager
title.  Sandberg, 53, signed a three-year contract through 2016
with a club option to extend the agreement through 2017, the
Phillies said in an e-mailed news release today.  Sandberg was promoted from third-base coach Aug. 16 after
the Phillies ended Charlie Manuel’s eight-plus season tenure,
which included a World Series victory and five straight division
titles.  The Phillies suffered a 4-0 loss to the visiting Los
Angeles Dodgers in Sandberg’s Major League Baseball managerial
debut and have gone 18-16 under him.  The Phillies are third in the five-team National League
East with a 71-83 record, 20 games behind the division-leading
Atlanta Braves.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
