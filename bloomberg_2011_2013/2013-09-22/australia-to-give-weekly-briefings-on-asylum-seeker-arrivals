Australia will give weekly media
briefings on the arrival of asylum seekers by boats as the
government seeks to curb the number of vessels coming to the
country, according to the Australian newspaper.  The briefings will be held by Immigration Minister Scott
Morrison and  Angus Campbell , deputy Army chief, and will begin
tomorrow, the  newspaper  said on its website. Under the former
Labor government, the Australian Customs and Border Protection
Service informed the media every time an asylum-seeker boat was
intercepted in Australian waters, according to Sky News.  Prime Minister  Tony Abbott ’s coalition won 90 seats in the
150-member lower house to Labor’s 55 in the Sept. 7 election. In
his victory speech, Abbott pledged to scrap former Prime Minister
 Julia Gillard ’s carbon-price system in his first term, put the
federal budget on track to a surplus, increase investment in
roads and stop asylum seekers arriving by boat.  “There will be regular, continuous, full disclosure,”
Environment Minister Greg Hunt said in an interview on  Sky News 
today.  The government will also provide monthly updates on
detention and statistics on bridging visas for asylum seekers
who arrive by boat, according to the Australian. The switch to a
weekly briefing denies people smugglers the opportunity to
exploit information about arrivals, the newspaper reported,
citing Morrison.  To contact the reporter on this story:
