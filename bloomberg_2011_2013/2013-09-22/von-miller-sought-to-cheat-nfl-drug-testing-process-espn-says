Von Miller , who accepted a six-game
suspension for violating the  National Football League ’s drug
policy, tried to manipulate the test, ESPN reported.  The Denver Broncos Pro Bowl linebacker unsuccessfully
conspired with a sample collector to corrupt the process, the
broadcaster reported, citing league sources it didn’t identify.
Miller was suspended Aug. 20.  The “star struck” Miami-based collector was willing to
substitute another person’s urine sample for a follow-up test
after the first produced a positive result, ESPN said. The
scheme was discovered after another collector noticed that
Miller hadn’t been in the city at the time the second sample was
supposedly collected, the report said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
