The average price for gasoline at
U.S. pumps tumbled to the lowest level in almost eight months as
crude oil price cuts reduced costs.  Regular gasoline slid 6.4 cents to $3.5207 a gallon in the
two weeks to Sept. 20, the least since Jan. 25, according to
Lundberg Survey Inc. The average, which reached a year-to-date
peak of $3.795 on Feb. 22, is about 31 cents below the year-earlier price of $3.8338 a gallon.  Gasoline slid as crude fell to a one-month low, cutting the
cost of production. The lowest price in the contiguous 48 states
among the markets surveyed was in Charleston,  South Carolina ,
with an average of $3.14 a gallon, according to the data, which
is based on information from about 2,500 filling stations by the
Camarillo, California-based company.  “Crude oil price cuts have moved down the supply chain,”
 Trilby Lundberg , president of Lundberg Survey, said in a
telephone interview. “That’s allowed refiners to cut wholesale
prices, which means retailers are now buying at lower prices.”  West Texas Intermediate crude for October delivery dropped
$1.72, or 1.6 percent, to $104.67 a barrel on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange  Sept. 20, the lowest settlement since Aug.
21. Prices fell 5.3 percent from $110.53 on Sept. 6, when
Lundberg conducted the previous survey.  Regional Prices  The highest price for gasoline was in  San Francisco , where
the average rose about 16 cents to $4.01 a gallon. The motor
fuel averaged $3.75 a gallon on  Long Island , New York, and $4 in
Los Angeles. Prices climbed to $3.9741 in  California , moving
opposite the national average, because of “refinery glitches,”
Lundberg said.  Outages occurred at  Phillips 66 (PSX) ’s  Los Angeles  refinery and
 Valero Energy Corp. (VLO) ’s Benicia plant in the past two weeks. The
sites have a combined capacity of 309,000 barrels a day,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Gasoline futures  for October delivery on the New York
Mercantile Exchange fell 16.95 cents, or 5.9 percent, to $2.6842
a gallon in the two weeks to Sept. 20.  Futures dropped for three consecutive weeks as refineries
 operated  at the highest seasonal rates in Energy Information
Administration data going back to 1989. U.S. plants processed
16.5 million barrels a day of crude and other feedstocks in the
week ended Sept. 15.  Gasoline stockpiles  are 5.2 percent above the five-year
average for this time of year after dropping 1.63 million
barrels in the week ended Sept. 13 to 216 million, according to
data from the EIA, the statistical arm of the Energy Department.  Crude Survey  Crude  inventories  slipped 4.37 million barrels in the week
ended Sept. 13 to 355.6 million. Stockpiles at Cushing,
 Oklahoma , the delivery point for WTI, fell 861,000 barrels to
33.3 million, the lowest level since February 2012.  WTI will probably decline this week after a U.S.-Russian
accord reduced the risk of an American attack on Syria and
speculation that Middle East shipments will be curbed, a
Bloomberg survey showed.  Fifteen of 34 analysts, or 44 percent, forecast crude will
decrease through Sept. 27. Thirteen respondents, or 38 percent,
predicted an increase and six said that there would be no
change.  To contact the reporters on this story:
