Australia will begin weekly
briefings tomorrow on asylum-seeker arrivals by boat, as the
government seeks to curb the number of vessels coming to the
country.  Additional briefings will be held as necessary, Minister
for Immigration Scott Morrison said in an e-mailed statement
today. Under the former Labor government, the Australian Customs
and Border Protection Service informed the media every time an
asylum-seeker boat was intercepted in Australian waters,
according to Sky News.  Prime Minister  Tony Abbott  pledged to “stop the boats”
when campaigning for the nation’s Sept. 7 election, in which his
coalition has won 90  seats  in the 150-member lower house to
Labor’s 55.  Abbott repeated that promise in his victory speech, along
with plans to scrap former Prime Minister  Julia Gillard ’s
carbon-price system in his first term, increase investment in
roads and put the  federal budget  on track to a surplus.  “People smugglers use information as a tactic to ply their
trade,” Morrison said in the statement. “Taking control of how
that information is released denies people smugglers the
opportunity to exploit such information.”  The government will also update detention and bridging visa
statistics for boat arrivals monthly, he said.  The change in how the Australian public is notified of boat
arrivals is “counter-productive,” the Labor party’s  Bill Shorten , who is vying for the party leadership after  Kevin Rudd 
resigned, said earlier today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
