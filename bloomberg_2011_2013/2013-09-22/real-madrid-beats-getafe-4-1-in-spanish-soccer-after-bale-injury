Real  Madrid  lost Gareth Bale to an
injury in the warm-up before beating Getafe 4-1 tonight to move
two points behind leaders Barcelona and Atletico Madrid in
Spanish soccer’s La Liga.  Cristiano Ronaldo got two goals, including a penalty, and
Pepe and Isco also scored at the Santiago Bernabeu stadium.
Getafe’s Michel was red-carded just before the end.  Bale, a reported world record 100 million-euro ($135
million) signing from Tottenham, injured a thigh before the game
and missed what would have been a home debut.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
