An Israeli man was in serious
condition after being shot today near the religious shrine known
as the Cave of the Patriarchs in the  West Bank  city of Hebron,
Israel Radio said.  An Israeli army spokeswoman, speaking anonymously in
accordance with military regulations, had no immediate comment.
The circumstances of the shooting were still being determined,
and Israeli forces were searching for the assailant, Israel
Radio said.  The Cave of the Patriarchs, reputed to be the burial place
of the biblical Abraham, is a holy site for Jews and Muslims.  The shooting comes a day after the army said an Israeli man
was murdered in the West Bank by a Palestinian who had worked
together with the victim in a Tel Aviv-area restaurant. The
Palestinian assailant had planned to use the murdered man’s body
as a negotiating asset to free a brother held in an Israeli jail
on security offenses, the army said.  Israeli Economy Minister Naftali Bennett, who opposes a
Palestinian state, said today that yesterday’s murder showed
that peace negotiations with the Palestinians are fruitless,  To contact the reporter on this story:
