University of  Florida  quarterback
Jeff Driskel will need surgery for a broken leg that will end
his season playing college football for the Gators, coach Will
Muschamp said.  Driskel broke his right fibula, the small bone in his lower
leg, when he was tackled after he threw an interception in the
first quarter of the No. 19 Gators’ 31-17 win against Tennessee
at Ben Hill Griffin Stadium in Gainesville, Florida.  “Jeff Driskel is as tough a kid as I’ve been around so
when he looked at the sideline and waved, I knew it was bad,”
Muschamp said in a televised interview.  Driskel completed 3-of-6 passing attempts for 33 yards
before he left the field on crutches. Tyler Murphy finished the
game, throwing for 134 yards and one touchdown.  Florida improved to 2-1 overall and 1-0 in the Southeastern
Conference.  Tennessee  evened its overall record at 2-2 and fell
0-1 in the SEC.  To contact the reporter on this story:
