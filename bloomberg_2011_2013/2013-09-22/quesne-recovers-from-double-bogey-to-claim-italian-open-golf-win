Three birdies in the last four
holes helped Julien Quesne clinch victory in golf’s  Italian Open 
today.  The Frenchman shot a back-nine 31 to finish 12-under par at
the Golf Club Torino, a shot ahead of Ireland’s David Higgins
and  England ’s Steve Webster.  Quesne’s second  European Tour  title looked unlikely when
the 33-year-old started his final round four strokes off the
lead. A double-bogey on the second hole seemed to widen his
chances even further, but he bounced back with birdies on the
fourth and sixth and a further five on the back nine for a 5-under final-round score of 67.  “After my double-bogey I just kept calm,” Quesne said
after the victory, which earned him a 250,000-euro ($338,500)
winner’s check. “To enjoy a second win on the European Tour is
like a dream for me.”  Overnight leader Marcus Fraser of  Australia  carded 74 to
finish joint-eighth on nine under.  To contact the reporter on this story:
