The attack on a shopping mall in
the Kenyan capital, Nairobi, is “an absolutely sickening and
despicable attack of appalling brutality,” British Prime
Minister  David Cameron  said today.  “These appalling terrorist attacks that take place, where
the perpetrators claim they do it in the name of a religion,
they don’t,” Cameron told the  BBC . “They do it in the name of
terror, violence and extremism and their warped view of the
world. They don’t represent Islam or Muslims in Britain or
anywhere else in the world.”  Cameron spoke after the Foreign Office in London said three
Britons are known to be among the dead.  “Because the situation is ongoing we should prepare
ourselves for further bad news,” Cameron said. “Our thoughts
also should be with the Kenyan government and the Kenyan people
at this time.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
