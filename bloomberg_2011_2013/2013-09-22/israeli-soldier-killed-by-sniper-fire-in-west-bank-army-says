An Israeli soldier was shot and
later died of his wounds today after gunfire was directed at
troops patrolling the Jewish settlement in the  West Bank  city of
Hebron, the Israeli army said in an e-mailed statement.  Israeli security forces are searching the Hebron area for
the perpetrators, the army said.  “This lethal attack illustrates the complex security
challenges the Israeli Defense Forces faces on a daily basis”
in the West Bank, army spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Peter Lerner
said in the statement.  Hebron, where about 500 Jewish settlers live, has been a
frequent site of conflict between Israelis and Palestinians.  The soldier killed today is the second Israeli to die a
violent death in the West Bank during the past few days.
Yesterday the army announced that an Israeli man was killed by a
Palestinian who worked with him at a Tel Aviv-area restaurant,
and planned to use the body as a negotiating asset in a bid to
free a relative imprisoned in an Israeli jail.  Israeli Economy Minister Naftali Bennett, who opposes the
peace talks with the Palestinians, sent a letter to Prime
Minister  Benjamin Netanyahu  demanding a discussion on the recent
acts of violence against Israelis.  “The answer to terror must be war directed at murderers,
not discussions with those that encourage murder,” Bennett said
in the letter, according to an e-mailed statement from his
office.  To contact the reporter on this story:
