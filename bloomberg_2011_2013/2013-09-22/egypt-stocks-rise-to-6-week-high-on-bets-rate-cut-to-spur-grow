Egypt ’s benchmark stocks index was
poised for the highest close in six weeks on speculation the
second interest rates cut in as many months will aid an economic
recovery.  The EGX 30 Index climbed 1.1 percent to 5,588.89 at 1:06
p.m. in Cairo, headed for the highest close since Aug. 13. About
239 million Egyptian pounds ($35 million) of shares traded,
compared with a one-year daily average of 352 million pounds.
Commercial International Bank Egypt SAE, the country’s biggest
publicly traded lender, increased 1 percent.  Shares rose on the first trading day after the central bank
reduced the benchmark overnight deposit rate by 50 basis points
to 8.75 percent, the lowest level in two years. The government
is trying to boost an economy  stuck  in the worst slump in two
decades after a popular uprising in 2011.  “Reducing  interest rates  definitely improves the outlook
for the market,” Hassan Kenawi, equities trader at Cairo-based
HC Brokerage, said by phone. “It improves valuations and makes
stocks more attractive for investors seeking higher returns as
bond yields fall.”  The government’s benchmark $1 billion of 5.75 percent
Eurobonds due in April 2020 tumbled 77 basis points last week to
7.2 percent, the lowest since May. The yield on  one-year 
treasury bills fell to 10.54 percent, the lowest since January
2011, at an auction on Sept. 19.  Commercial International rose to 37.78 pounds, set for the
highest close since Aug. 13. Alexandria Mineral Oils Co. jumped
3.5 percent to 73.5 pounds, the highest since January, after the
company said it would pay an 8-pound dividend.  To contact the reporter on this story:
