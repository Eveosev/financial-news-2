Demand for new Treasuries from
their biggest owners is proving impervious to rising yields and
the retreat of Wall Street dealers.  Bids submitted by investors including  mutual funds , foreign
 central banks , pension managers and insurance companies totaled
83 percent of Treasury debt auctioned this year, compared with
84 percent in 2012 and 37 percent in 2008 at the peak of the
worst financial crisis since the Great Depression, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Consistent demand from investors who control 81 percent of
the $11.6 trillion in Treasuries is helping balance declining
purchases from bond dealers and individuals in the worst year
for government debt since 2009. Yields are rising as the  economy 
improves, the U.S. prepares to refinance a record $1.38 trillion
next year, the budget deficit shrinks to the least since 2008,
the Federal Reserve plans to reduce its stimulus and Congress
battles President  Barack Obama  over raising the borrowing limit.  “Sovereign wealth funds and central banks are going to
continue to have demand for Treasuries,” James Sarni, senior
managing partner in Los Angeles at Payden & Rygel, which manages
$85 billion, said in a Sept. 17 telephone interview. “Despite
the fact there’s widespread concerns that rates are going up,
there’s still demand coming from individuals looking for
income,” while institutions prize their safety and liquidity,
said Sarni, who has been buying high-yield company bonds.  Buying Increases  Hedge funds and mutual funds received  20.6 percent  of the
$13 billion sale of 30-year bonds on Sept. 12, the most since
June 2012. That followed their purchase of 29.6 percent of the
$21 billion 10-year note offering on Sept. 11 and  20 percent  of
the $31 billion offering of three-year securities the day
before, both six-month highs.  This year they have bought $250.9 billion, or 17.3 percent
of Treasuries sold at auction, on pace to surpass the record of
14.4 percent set last year and 2.6 percent in 2008, government
data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Investors bid for 2.88 times the $1.521 trillion of notes
and bonds sold at Treasury auctions, down from the record 3.11
times the  $2.153 trillion  sold last year. While the bid-to-cover
ratio has fallen for the first time since 2008, demand is the
fourth-highest on record going back to 1994. When the U.S. ran
budget surpluses from 1998 to 2001, the ratio averaged 2.26
times.  Falling Yields  The Treasury received $579.2 billion of direct bids this
year and $677.8 billion from indirect bidders, totaling $1.26
trillion. The last time their demand was higher was in 2010 when
they bid for 91 percent. In 2008, there were $25.4 billion of
direct and $318.1 billion of indirect bids, or 37 percent of the
$922 billion of coupon securities offered.  The yield on the benchmark 10-year note fell 15 basis
points last week, or 0.15 percentage point, to 2.74 percent as
the Fed decided not to trim its $85 billion monthly bond
purchases. Yields touched 3 percent last month, up from this
year’s low of 1.61 percent in May, as Fed Chairman Ben S.
Bernanke said the central bank would consider reducing or ending
its stimulus.  The benchmark 10-year yield fell three basis points, or
0.03 percentage point, to 2.70 percent as of 11:56 a.m. New York
time, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader data. The price of the
2.5 percent security maturing in August 2023 rose 9/32 or $2.81
per $1,000 face amount to 98 1/4. Yields will end the year at
2.85 percent and rise to 3.10 percent by mid-2014, the median of
about 70 analyst estimates in a Bloomberg survey show.  Bond Losses  Treasuries of all maturities have lost an average of 2.95
percent this year, according to the Bloomberg U.S. Treasury Bond
Index. They are up 0.36 percent this month.  Foreign  official  holders, including central banks and
finance ministries, which make up part of the indirect bidding
total, held $4 trillion of Treasuries as of July, up from $1.64
trillion at the end of 2007, government data show.  International demand is being fueled in part by a desire
for dollar-denominated assets. The Bloomberg Dollar Index shows
the world’s reserve currency has risen 2.7 percent this year,
the most in five years.  Many direct bidders don’t want to be identified because of
concern that they may suffer repercussions from the 21 primary
dealers of U.S. government securities.  Officials at Pacific Investment Management Co. in Newport
Beach,  California , the world’s largest bond fund manager and
which invests about $2 trillion, said while they like direct
bidding, Pimco still places most of its auction orders through
dealers because they’re better able to handle bids for funds
with multiple accounts and custodians.  Yield Attraction  Pension funds, which need the predictable streams of
principal and interest from bonds to pay retirees, as well as
insurers who match bond purchases to cover underwriting claims,
have been drawn back to Treasuries by the higher yields, William O’Donnell, the head U.S. government bond strategist at primary
dealer RBS Securities Inc. in  Stamford ,  Connecticut , said in a
Sept. 17 phone interview.  “The flows into bonds will dwarf the Fed’s retrenchment,”
John Taft, chief executive officer of RBC Wealth Management
U.S.A. in New York, said in a Sept. 17 interview with  Tom Keene 
on Bloomberg Television’s “Surveillance.” Their increasing
demand “will keep rates low,” Taft said.  The need for safer assets, including government bonds, will
grow by as much as $5.7 trillion by 2020 as the Dodd-Frank Act
in the U.S. and capital standards set by the Bank for
International Settlements in  Basel , Switzerland, require more
top-graded debt as loss reserves, the Treasury Borrowing
Advisory Committee said in a May 1 report.  Risk Discouraged  The regulations, which discourage risk-taking by financial
institutions, are leading dealers to focus on “matching a
seller to a buyer and eking out a little bit of the differential
between the two rather than assuming risk and then
redistributing that risk,” Steve Rodosky, who runs Treasury and
derivatives trading at Pimco, said in a Sept. 18 telephone
interview.  This year’s losses have been fueled by anticipation that
the Fed will reduce its $45 billion in monthly purchases of
Treasuries. Individual investors withdrew $79 billion from
taxable bond mutual funds since the end of May, according to
Investment Company Institute data. Deposits in taxable fixed-income securities jumped 130 percent to $2.85 trillion from 2008
to 2012, according to the trade group.  The sharpest drop in demand for Treasuries has come from
the 21 primary dealers, whose bids fell for the first time in
five years to 1.93 times the $1.52 trillion sold, compared with
2.13 times in 2012, Treasury data show.  Taper Postponed  Primary dealer  holdings  of Treasury securities declined to
1.09 percent of the market from 1.14 percent at the end of 2012.
Dealers owned $126.8 billion as of Sept. 11, according to
central bank data, the most since April, down from a record
$145.7 billion in December. They have held an average of $92.3
billion in 2013, down from $93.1 billion last year.  Fed policy makers last week refrained from reducing the $85
billion pace of monthly  bond buying , saying they needs more
signs of lasting improvement in the economy.  “Conditions in the job market today are still far from
what all of us would like to see,” Bernanke said at a Sept. 18
press conference in  Washington  after a two-day meeting of the
Federal Open Market Committee. “The committee has concern that
rapid tightening of financial conditions in recent months would
have the effect of slowing growth.”  Republicans in the House of Representatives say they won’t
fund the government past Oct. 1 or raise the debt limit by the
middle of next month unless money to implement the Affordable
Care Act is removed. Obama has said he won’t negotiate over the
borrowing cap.  ‘Full Faith’  “We’re not going to set up a situation where the full
faith and credit of the United States is put on the table every
year or every year and a half, and we go through some sort of
terrifying financial brinksmanship because of some ideological
arguments that people are having about some particular issue of
the day,” Obama said Sept. 18 at a meeting of business
executives in Washington.  The  budget deficit  through August was $755.3 billion, the
smallest for the period since 2008. The Congressional Budget
Office forecasts the shortfall will fall to about $700 billion
by the Sept. 30 fiscal year-end from the $1.4 trillion record
set in 2009.  “There’s a lot more money chasing fixed-income assets so
you have a significant amount of people who always need to be
buying bonds,” Ira Jersey, an interest-rate strategist in New
York at Credit Suisse Group AG, one of the 21 primary dealers,
said in a Sept. 16 telephone interview.  Those buyers include individual investors who want safe
investments and central banks who need to hold dollar-based
assets because of trade flows, Jersey said. “All of those
things have contributed to this demand.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
