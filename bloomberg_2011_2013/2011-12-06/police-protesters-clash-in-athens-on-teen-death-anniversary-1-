Greek police used tear gas to
disperse protesters in  Athens  outside the Parliament house today
amid marches to mark the third anniversary of a death of a Greek
teenager.  About 5,000 police officers were deployed in the city
center to prevent a repeat of the riots that followed the
shooting of Alexis Grigoropoulos in 2008. An estimated 2,000
people, mostly young students, took part in todayâ€™s protest,
according to a police spokesman who declined to be identified.  Protesters threw rocks and other items at police as the
marchers reached the Parliament house, where lawmakers will vote
on the 2012 budget later today. The rally is the first of two
planned in the Greek capital today.  Grigoropoulos, 15, was killed by a policeman in December
2008. His death sparked weeks of protests around the country.  To contact the reporters on this story:
