Iraq bought 120,000 metric tons of
rice from  India  and  Pakistan , the Middle East country’s Grain
Board said.  The total amount consisted of 90,000 tons of the grain from
Pakistan and 30,000 tons from India, Hassan Ismail Ibrahim,
director general of the board, said by phone from Baghdad today.
The tender closed Nov. 30, he said.  Iraq consumes 1.25 million tons of rice a year, mostly
imported, according to Ibrahim. The harvest has started for this
year, with production forecast to climb to 250,000 tons from
last year’s 150,000 tons, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
