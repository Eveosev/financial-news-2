3M Co. (MMM)  said revenue may increase as
much as 6 percent next year amid growth in existing businesses
and a boost from mergers and acquisitions.  Sales may be $30.2 billion to $31.5 billion, according to
presentations today on the company’s  website,  in line with the
$30.6 billion average estimate of analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg. The maker of Scotch-Brite sponges and Nexcare
thermometers and adhesive bandages expects earnings per share of
$6.25 to $6.50 next year, also tracking estimates.  3M will repeat its approach of keeping costs low and
investing in more-profitable and innovative products such as
Cubitron II abrasives that have shark-tooth-shaped grains to
increase sales and competitive advantages, Buckley said. The  St.
Paul , Minnesota-based company said forecasting is difficult
because of economic turmoil.  “We have no sense of any settlement of the turbulent
global situation,” Chief Executive Officer  George Buckley  said
on a webcast of a meeting with investors in New York. “The
economy is much more likely to grow slowly than collapse.”  Western Europe’s economy “seems to be getting worse” and
there is more uncertainty in 3M’s “thought consciousness” than
there was previously, Buckley said.  “If we have a tough situation next year, and I don’t think
it’s going to be this tough, we will follow the same model,” he
said.  Acquisitions, Exchange Rates  Acquisitions already announced such as foam-core materials
maker Nida-Core Corp. and vehicle graphics firm Original Wraps
Inc. may boost 2012 revenue by about 1 percent and future
purchases may add as much as 3 percent more, 3M said. Currency
exchange rates may curb revenue as much as 2 percent.  3M rose 1.5 percent to $82.13 at the close in New York. The
shares have declined 4.8 percent this year.  The midpoint of 3M’s 2012 earnings forecast is $6.38 a
share, which was “better than expected,” C.  Stephen Tusa , an
analyst at JPMorgan Chase & Co., wrote in a note to clients.  The average of 17 analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg
was $6.27.  3M reaffirmed its 2011 per-share profit forecast of $5.85
to $5.95. The company had lowered that projection from $6.10 to
$6.25 on Oct. 25 when it posted third-quarter earnings that
trailed analysts’ estimates for the first time in 10 quarters.  That reduction implied a “weaker fourth quarter” and
makes the 2012 forecast “less conservative,” Tusa wrote.  Buckley, whose contract as CEO ends on his 65th birthday in
February, has declined to comment on whether he will continue
afterward and didn’t address retirement at today’s meeting.  Speculation that Buckley will step down next year increased
after 3M in May named Inge Thulin as chief operating officer, a
newly created position.  To contact the reporters on this story:
