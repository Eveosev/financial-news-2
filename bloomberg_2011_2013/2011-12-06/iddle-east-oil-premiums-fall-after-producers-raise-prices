The premiums for Middle East crude
sold to Asia fell against their official prices, which were
raised by government-run companies.  Murban , produced by Abu Dhabi National Oil Co., slipped 2
cents to a premium of 8 cents a barrel over its official selling
price, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Lower Zakum,
also produced in the emirate, slumped 4 cents a discount of 8
cents below its official level.  Abu Dhabi National increased the official prices for
November-loading Murban by 5 percent to $114.35 a barrel,
according to an e-mail sent to buyers today. That price puts the
grade at a premium of $5.35 a barrel to benchmark Dubai crude
for the same period, the highest level since July 2008.  Saudi Arabian Oil Co. yesterday increased the premiums for
its crude sold to  Asia  to records for its light, medium and
heavy grades. Arab Light climbed to $4.15 a barrel over the
average of Oman and Dubai for January, the company said in a
notice to buyers.  Oman  crude dropped 0.7 percent to $109.28 a barrel,
Bloomberg data showed.  Dubai  was down 1 percent at $108.08.
 Murban crude  declined $1.08 to $112.75 a barrel.  Oman futures for February delivery fell $2.29 to $108.81 a
barrel on the Dubai Mercantile Exchange at 5:27 p.m. Singapore
time with 1,627 contracts traded. The settlement price was
$109.36 at 12:30 p.m. in Dubai.  The January  Brent-Dubai  exchange for swaps, which measures
the European benchmark contract against the Persian Gulf grade,
widened 5 cents to $3 a barrel, according to data from PVM. The
exchange for swaps for February gained 18 cents to $3.35.  To contact the reporter on this story:
