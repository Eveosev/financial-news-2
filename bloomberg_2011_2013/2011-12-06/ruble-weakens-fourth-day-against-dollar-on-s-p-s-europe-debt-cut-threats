The ruble weakened the most in nine
days and bonds fell after  Standard & Poor’s  said it may strip
Germany and France of their AAA debt ratings and as Interior
Ministry troops patrolled Moscow amid anti-government protests.  Russia’s currency depreciated 1.1 percent to 31.205 per
dollar at the close in Moscow, the most since Nov. 23. The yield
on ruble government bonds due August 2016 jumped 13 basis points
to 8.04 percent, the biggest increase since Nov. 15.  S&P said yesterday it put 15 euro nations on review for
possible downgrades depending on the result of a European Union
summit on Dec. 9. U.S. Secretary of State  Hillary Clinton , at a
gathering of the Organization for Security Cooperation in  Europe 
today, called for an investigation into allegations of electoral
fraud in Russian elections last weekend. S&P said  Vladimir
Putin ’s reduced majority in parliament after the ballot may damp
his willingness for spending cuts needed for a higher rating.  Ruble trades currently “depend on European developments,”
 Denis Korshilov , head of fixed-income, currencies and
commodities at Citigroup Inc. in Moscow, said by e-mail. “The
level of uncertainty has moved up a bit after all the
discussions about falsifications and stronger protesting
behavior of the population. That probably resulted in some fresh
capital outflow.”  The benchmark Micex Index of stocks sank 4 percent, the
most since Nov. 21.  Elections, Police  About 2,000 servicemen and 2,000 police officers have been
on duty in Moscow every day since the Dec. 4 parliamentary
elections, a duty officer at the Moscow police press service
said by phone today. Police said about 300 people were detained
after a protest yesterday. The ruling United  Russia  party won
49.5 percent of the vote, its worst performance since 2003,
according to preliminary results.  “I wouldn’t get too excited about this -- Russia is very
unlikely to see an Arab Spring or Orange Revolution,” Tim Ash,
head of emerging-markets strategy at Royal Bank of Scotland
Group Plc, wrote in an e-mailed note. “Most Russians outside
Moscow and  St. Petersburg  still value the stability and growth
that Putin has delivered.”  Capital flight may exceed $85 billion this year, acting
Finance Minister Anton Siluanov said in Moscow yesterday.
Central Bank Chairman Sergey Ignatiev told reporters on Nov. 2
that outflows would total $73.6 billion this year.  The ruble has lost 2 percent against the dollar this year,
heading for a fourth consecutive annual decline.  Brazil ’s real
dropped 7.4 percent in the period,  India ’s rupee depreciated 13
percent and the  Chinese yuan  gained 3.8 percent against the U.S.
currency.  Forwards  Investors increased bets the ruble would weaken further,
with non-deliverable forwards showing the currency at 31.6025
per dollar in three months, compared with expectations of 31.225
per dollar yesterday.  Russia’s currency was 0.3 percent weaker at 41.73 per euro,
leaving it down 0.7 percent at 35.9413 against the central
bank’s target dollar-euro basket.  Russia’s $3.5 billion of Eurobonds due 2020 rose, pushing
the yield down nine basis points, or 0.09 percentage point, to
4.349 percent. Dollar-denominated notes due 2015 yielded one
basis points less than yesterday, at 3.022 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
