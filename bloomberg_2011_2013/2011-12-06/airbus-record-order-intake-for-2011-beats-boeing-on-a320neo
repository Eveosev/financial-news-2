Airbus SAS, the world’s biggest
planemaker, extended its lead over U.S. rival  Boeing Co. (BA) , with
11-month orders already topping its annual record following the
introduction of the A320neo.  Carriers placed 1,378 aircraft orders through November
after subtracting cancellations, the Toulouse, France-based
company said on its web site. That includes about 1,200 firm
orders for A320neos, which offer more fuel-efficient engines
than the existing A320 series. Boeing’s tally stands at 518
planes in the first 11 months.  Airbus has topped Boeing’s deliveries every year since
2003. While aircraft makers get the majority of payment upon
delivery, new purchase agreements carry initial pre-delivery
payments of as much as 5 percent upon signature, with 20 percent
of the sales price being paid out in stages before delivery,
boosting cash and providing capital for investing in planes.  The shares of  Airbus (EAD)  parent European Aeronautic, Defence &
Space Co. have gained 26 percent this year, outpacing the 10
percent increase in the value of Boeing stock. EADS was little
changed as of 4:30 p.m. in Paris, trading at 22.04 euros a
share. Boeing shares rose as much as 47 cents, or 0.66 percent,
to $71.56 in  New York  and traded at $71.50 as of 10:37 a.m. in
New York.  Boeing is lagging on orders partly because the Chicago-
based  company hasn’t yet started taking firm orders for its 737
MAX, a version of the 737 that will offer new engines and enter
service in 2017, two years after Airbus’s A320neo.  MAX Engines  Boeing decided to offer the MAX, which will carry more
fuel-efficient engines from  CFM International , a joint venture
of  General Electric Co. (GE)  and  Safran SA (SAF) , to fend off the A320neo
and help capture half of a $2 trillion market in the next 20
years.  The unit of European Aeronautic, Defence & Space Co.
delivered 477 planes through November, including 371 single-
aisle aircraft, 78 widebody planes, and 22 double-decker A380
jets. Airbus incurred 143 cancellations. Boeing delivered 387
planes through October, according to its web site.  Boeing says it has won 700 commitments from nine customers
for the MAX though will only accept firm orders when the
performance guarantees and pricing of the promised plane have
been set.  Jim Albaugh , chief executive of Boeing’s commercial
jet division, said Nov. 13 that discussions on pricing and
performance may be wrapped up before year end.  To contact the reporter on this story:
