European Goldfields Ltd. (EGU)  shares were
halted on the Toronto Stock Exchange after a report the
developer of mines in Greece has been approached about a
takeover by  Eldorado Gold Corp. (ELD)   The halt was reported in a statement today from the
Investment Industry Regulatory Organization of Canada.
Eldorado’s proposal to European Goldfields threatens to scuttle
a move by Qatar Holding LLC to buy a stake in European
Goldfields, Sky News’s Mark Kleinman reported on his blog,
without disclosing the source of the information.  European Goldfields, based in Whitehorse, Yukon Territory,
rose 15 percent to C$11.46 before the halt in Toronto. Eldorado,
which is based in Vancouver, fell 1.6 percent to C$17.13 at
10:32 a.m. in Toronto.  Steve Sharpe, European Goldfields’s senior vice-president
of corporate development, and Nancy Woo, a spokeswoman for
Eldorado, didn’t immediately return calls from Bloomberg News
for comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
