Annual inflation in Ecuador, which
uses the  U.S. dollar  as its official currency, quickened for the
10th consecutive month in November as windfall oil revenue
boosts economic growth.  Consumer prices gained 5.53 percent from the  year -earlier
period and 0.3 percent from October, the National Statistics and
Census Institute said today in a report on its  website . The
annual gain is the most since April 2009.  South America’s seventh-biggest economy has higher
inflation than its Andean neighbors Chile, Peru and Colombia. An
economic boom, fueled by windfall oil profits and government
loans for low-cost housing, has contributed to rising prices,
Finance Minister Patricio Rivera said last month.  “Food and non-alcoholic drinks are the articles that have
contributed the most,” the agency said in the report.  Producer prices rose 1.62 percent in November from October
and 4.88 percent from a year earlier, according to the report.
 Ecuador , the smallest member of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries, subsidizes fuel costs and the domestic use
of natural gas.  Prices are forecast to rise “a little more” than 5
percent this year, Economic Policy Minister Jeanette Sanchez
said yesterday on the ministry’s twitter account. The economy is
expected to grow 6.5 percent in 2011, according to the central
bank.  To contact the reporter on this story:
