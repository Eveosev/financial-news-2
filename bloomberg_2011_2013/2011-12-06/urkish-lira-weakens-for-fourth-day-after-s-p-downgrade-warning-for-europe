The Turkish lira depreciated for a
fourth day and headed for its weakest level in a week after
 Standard & Poor’s  said it may downgrade credit ratings of 15
euro nations.  The lira slid 0.4 percent to 1.8398 at 9:08 a.m. in
Istanbul, bringing this year’s losses to 16 percent, the second
worst performance among more than 20 emerging market currencies
tracked by Bloomberg.  Standard & Poor’s put  Germany ,  France  and 13 other euro-
area nations on review for a downgrade yesterday, saying
“continuing disagreements among European policy makers on how
to tackle” the region’s debt crisis risk damaging their
financial stability.  “The S&P decision affected the Turkish lira adversely in
the morning hours,” Fatih Keresteci, a strategist at HSBC Bank
AS in Istanbul, wrote in a note to clients.  The Treasury will offer new fixed-rate lira bonds due in
December 2013 in an auction today as part of its plan to borrow
1 billion liras ($543 million), against a domestic debt service
of 1.1 billion liras this month, according to its  website.   To contact the reporter on this story:
