The Cypriot  Finance Ministry  said
euro-region nations must take action now to mitigate the effects
of any future cut of their  credit rating  by  Standard & Poor’s .  The rating company put  Germany , France and 13 other euro-
area nations on review for a downgrade yesterday, citing the
possible risk to their financial stability from continuing
disagreements among European policy makers on how to tackle the
region’s debt crisis.  Cyprus expects the ratings of all euro-area nations to be
affected by S&P’s review, the Nicosia-based ministry said in an
e-mailed  statement  today. The company said it expects to
conclude the review after a European Union summit on Dec. 8-9.  S&P’s move “makes it even more imperative that all
necessary economic-policy measures are immediately taken at the
national level to mitigate the impact of the evaluations,” the
ministry said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
