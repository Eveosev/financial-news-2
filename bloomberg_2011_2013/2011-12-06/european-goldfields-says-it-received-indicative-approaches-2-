European Goldfields Ltd. (EGU) , a metals
explorer and mine developer with projects in Greece,  Romania  and
Turkey, rose the most in three years after saying it received
“preliminary and indicative approaches from third parties”
regarding potential deals.  “No formal offers have been received and there can be no
assurances that any transaction will result,” the Whitehorse,
Yukon Territory-based company said in a statement today, without
identifying the third parties.  European Goldfields gained 22 percent to C$12.12, the
biggest one-day climb since December 2008. Sky News’ Mark
Kleinman  reported  on his blog today that  Eldorado Gold Corp. (ELD)  had
approached the company about a takeover. The move threatens to
scuttle Qatar Holding LLC’s plan to boost its stake in European
Goldfields, according to the report.  Steve Sharpe, European Goldfields’ senior vice president of
corporate development, and Nancy Woo, a spokeswoman for
Vancouver-based Eldorado, didn’t respond to calls seeking
comment.  Eldorado fell 1.6 percent to C$17.13 at the close.  To contact the reporter on this story:
