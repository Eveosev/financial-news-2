Russia’s financial markets watchdog
is opening an insider-trading investigation into  OAO Rosneft’s 
share-price increase before the oil producer formed a strategic
alliance with  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)  in August.  The probe will take at least six months, Interfax said
today, citing an unidentified Federal Financial Markets Service
official. The regulator’s press service confirmed the report.  Rosneft, Russia’s largest oil producer, jumped 9 percent on
the Micex exchange in Moscow in the two days leading up to the
deal. The state-run company and Exxon Mobil signed the agreement
about an hour before the close of trading on Aug. 30. The
benchmark  Micex Index (INDEXCF)  gained 3.8 percent on Aug. 29 and 30.  Rosneft selected Exxon as a partner to tap the Kara Sea, a
little-explored area in the Arctic that may be an extension of
Russia’s western Siberian oil province, after an agreement with
BP Plc collapsed. The two will also explore deep-water Black Sea
deposits. In return, Exxon will offer Rosneft participation in
projects in  Canada , Texas, the Gulf of Mexico and elsewhere.  Rosneft’s press service didn’t immediately comment when
called by Bloomberg. Olga Shishkina, a spokeswoman for Exxon
Mobil in Moscow, declined by e-mail to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
