Egypt ’s central bank said today it
will “safeguard an orderly” foreign exchange market after
denying a newspaper report that it may stop supporting the
Egyptian pound.  El Shorouk newspaper cited a central bank official it
didn’t identify as saying that the regulator may stop supporting
the currency in the next few months. The pound has weakened 3.3
percent against the dollar this year, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg, after a popular revolt that toppled President
 Hosni Mubarak .  “The Central Bank of Egypt denies the announcement
published by El-Shorouk newspaper on Dec. 6, 2011, regarding the
 exchange rate  and foreign reserve,” the regulator said in an e-
mailed statement. “The central bank would like to underscore
that it continues to safeguard an orderly foreign exchange
market which has been the case since the launch of the foreign
exchange inter-bank market in December 2004.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
