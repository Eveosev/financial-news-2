Arnold & Porter LLP  and  Howard Rice
Nemerovski Canady Falk & Rabkin PC  will merge by Jan. 1 to
create a firm with more than 800 lawyers.  The combination expands Washington-based  Arnold & Porter ’s
West Coast presence and provides San Francisco-based Howard
Rice’s clients with national and international capabilities, the
firms said today in a statement.  “We are not only strengthening our presence in California,
but we are doing it with individuals who complement the skill
sets we offer elsewhere in the firm,” Arnold & Porter Chairman
Tom Milch said in the statement.  Doug Winthrop, chairman for Howard Rice, said that although
the 57-year-old firm had preferred to remain independent in the
past, the merger opportunity “was too good to pass up.”  Arnold & Porter has 700 lawyers working in nine offices
across the U.S. and  Europe . Howard Rice has 82 attorneys in just
one office, said John Buchanan, a firm spokesman. About 26 staff
members will be cut as a result of the merger, Buchanan said.  The combined firm will have more than 160 attorneys in  San
Francisco , Silicon Valley and  Los Angeles , according to the
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
