Washington  Redskins tight end Fred Davis and offensive lineman Trent Williams were suspended for
the final four games of the season for violating the National
Football League’s substance-abuse policy.  Davis is the Redskins’ leading receiver this season,
catching 59 passes for 796 yards and three touchdowns. Williams
has been a starting tackle since being selected by Washington
with the fourth pick in the 2010  NFL draft .  The NFL didn’t disclose the nature of their violations in a
news release. The Washington Post, citing unidentified people
familiar with the case, said both players tested positive for
recreational drug use at least three times.  The Redskins have a 4-8 record this season, losing seven of
eight games after a 3-1 start, and host the  New England Patriots 
this week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
