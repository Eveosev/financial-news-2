Ethanol futures fell in Chicago amid
lower demand for blending with gasoline and on speculation
 Europe ’s debt crisis will curtail exports.  Futures sank as European leaders wrestle with the region’s
debt crisis. The U.S. exports the biofuel to countries such as
the  United Kingdom ,  Finland  and the Netherlands. Separately, an
Energy Department report last week showed production of
conventional gasoline blended with ethanol, a proxy for use of
the fuel beyond government requirements, dropped the most in six
months.  “Ethanol was weaker today with the front of the curve
continuing to see pressure,” SCB & Associates LLC wrote in a
report. “Ongoing euro zone debt worries and thin trade combined
with the growing amount of product in the market as exports have
slowed and demand has slacked to weaken the market.”  Denatured ethanol for January delivery fell 2.3 cents, or 1
percent, to $2.181 a gallon on the  Chicago  Board of Trade.  In cash market trading ethanol on the West Coast tumbled 20
cents, or 7.3 percent, to $2.525 a gallon and in  New York  the
additive dropped 16.5 cents, or 6.1 percent, to $2.525,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol in Chicago decreased 15 cents, or 5.8 percent, to
$2.425 a gallon and in the U.S. Gulf the biofuel slid 13 cents,
or 4.8 percent, to $2.575.  U.S. ethanol exports averaged 84,000 barrels a day in
September, the most recent month  data  is available, down 14
percent from the record 98,000 barrels a day in July, according
to the Energy Department.  Production of conventional gasoline blended with ethanol 
tumbled 3.7 percent to 4.94 million barrels a day in the week
ended Nov. 25, the biggest drop and smallest amount since May 6.  Refiners receive a 45-cent tax credit for each gallon of
ethanol mixed with gasoline, a measure that’s set to expire Dec.
