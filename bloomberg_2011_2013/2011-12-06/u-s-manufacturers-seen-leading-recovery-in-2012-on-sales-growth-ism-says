U.S. manufacturers are more
optimistic about sales, spending and hiring for next year than
service companies, a sign factories will remain at the forefront
of the economic expansion, according to the  Institute for Supply
Management .  Purchasing managers at factories anticipate sales will grow
5.5 percent next year and  capital investment  will increase 1.9
percent, the Tempe, Arizona-based group’s semiannual forecast
showed today. Revenue and spending will increase at a slower
pace among service providers, which account for about 90 percent
of the economy.  “Manufacturing has demonstrated its resilience throughout
this challenging economic recovery period, with consistent
growth dating back to August of 2009,” Bradley Holcomb,
chairman of the group’s factory survey, said in a statement.
Manufacturers “expect to see continued growth in 2012.”  The increase in factory demand next year may fall short of
the improvement in 2011. The projected gain in 2012 sales
compares with a 7 percent increase for this year. For the
services industry, revenue is forecast to be stronger than the
1.5 percent gain in 2011.  Factory employment is projected to increase 1.3 percent in
2012, compared with a 1.1 percent projected rise at non-
manufacturing companies. Sales in the services industry will
increase 3.1 percent next year and investment spending will rise
0.1 percent.  ISM Factory Gauge  The  factory  gauge has averaged 55.4 so far this year,
reaching a 2011 low of 50.6 in August and since rising to 52.7
last month. The service index has averaged 54.6 in 2011. It
dropped last month to 52, its lowest since January 2010.  Growth in  emerging markets  is helping sustain demand for
U.S.-produced goods.  Deere & Co. (DE) , the world’s largest farm-
equipment maker, on Nov. 23 reported fiscal fourth-quarter
profit and forecast 2012 earnings that topped analysts’
estimates.  “We expect sound farmer confidence and strong equipment
demand,” investor communications manager Susan Karlix said on a
conference call.  “Globally, coming off 2011’s high levels, the
2012 industry outlook is for stable commodity prices and farm
income.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
