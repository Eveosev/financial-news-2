China Sunergy Co., a maker of solar
cells and modules, will boost the price of its American
depositary receipts by making them worth more of its underlying
shares.  The company will triple the number of ordinary shares an
ADR is worth to 18 from six, Nanjing-based China Sunergy said
today in a statement.  The move is similar to a reverse split, when a company
consolidates inexpensive stock to have fewer outstanding shares
with a higher price, said Daniel Ries, an analyst with Collins
Stewart LLC in  New York .  “It’s a very small company within the Chinese solar
market, and it lacks some of the cost advantages its larger
competitors get through scale,” Ries said today in a telephone
interview. “They’re trying a superior-technology strategy, but
it’s a very tough market right now.” He has a “neutral”
rating on the company’s ADRs.  The price of China Sunergy’s ADRs “is expected to
automatically increase proportionally” because of the new
ratio, the company said in the statement. The change will take
effect Dec. 21.  China Sunergy’s ADRs fell 4.4 percent to 66 cents at 11:02
a.m. in New York. They’ve dropped 84 percent this year through
yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
