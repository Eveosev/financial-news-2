The White House and Pentagon are near
agreement on a draft five-year  defense budget  that flattens
expenditures though 2017, with the lowest war spending since
2004, according to an Office of Management and Budget document.  The OMB also endorses a Navy plan to delay by two years
start of construction on the  Huntington Ingalls Industries Inc .
CVN-79 John F. Kennedy aircraft carrier, and provides $508
million to bankroll the new U.S. Office of Security Cooperation
in  Iraq . OMB said the White House has yet to decide on whether
defense civilian employees and military personnel will get a pay
raise.  Defense spending  in 2013 would be reduced 1 percent from
this year’s pending $525.3 billion budget request before growing
annually 1.8 percent in 2014, 2.3 percent in 2015, dropping to
1.9 percent in 2016 and increasing 2.2 percent in 2017,
according to the 23-page document, a Nov. 29 OMB “pass-back”
budget to the Pentagon. Bloomberg News obtained the document.  “This is the first time the Obama Administration has
proposed a defense budget for the coming year that is less than
the previous year,” said  Todd Harrison , a defense budget
analyst for the non-partisan Center for Strategic and Budgetary
Assessments in Washington.  The percentage increases are expressed in “nominal
growth,” not adjusted for inflation. The OMB numbers apply only
to Pentagon spending. Pentagon budget officials plan to conclude
the process by Dec. 20.  War Funding  The White House and Pentagon also have agreed to $82.54
billion in war funding for 2013 and $50 billion “placeholder”
amounts through the remainder of the plan.  The $82 billion assumes 68,000 troops in Afghanistan
through that fiscal year. There are 97,000 today. The request is
the lowest for war spending since fiscal 2004, when the Pentagon
requested about $69 billion, according to comptroller data.  “The $82.5 billion requested is consistent with the number
of troops they are projecting,” Harrison said. “Over the past
six years, the cost per troop in  Afghanistan  has averaged about
$1.2 million per-troop per-year, and that’s precisely what this
budget works out to on a per troop basis.”  The OMB data outlines the distribution of the initial $261
billion in reductions mandated by the Budget Control Act: $27.5
billion in fiscal 2012; $46.8 billion in fiscal 2013; $53.3
billion in 2014; $52.7 billion in 2015; $54.6 billion in 2016
and $53.5 billion in 2017.  Topline Numbers  The basic defense-only “topline” numbers currently are:
$523.8 billion in 2013; $533.0 billion in 2014; $545.5 billion
in 2015; $555.9 billion in 2016 and $567.9 billion in 2017.  The overall 2012-2021 defense plan calls for $5.652
trillion in spending, according to OMB. OMB calculated that the
total Budget Control Act-mandated defense cut over those years
is $488 billion -- or about an 8.5 percent overall decrease.  “This budget fits within the initial budget caps agreed to
in the Budget Control Act,” Harrison said. “It does not fit
under the caps imposed by sequestration, which would reduce the
base budget by about $54 billion below the amounts currently
projected for each year,” he said, referring to the potential
for another $500 billion in automatic cuts.  “This clearly indicates the Pentagon and the White House
are not preparing a budget that would comply with
sequestration,” he said.  Realistic Guidance  Russell Rumbaugh, a defense budget expert with the Stimson
Center in  Washington , said the new OMB guidance is “realistic”
given the budget caps.  “Although it doesn’t keep pace with inflation,” the OMB
guidance equals only a 6 or 7 percent reduction at the end of 10
years -- way below past build-downs. We’re probably still
staring at another reduction at some point, although it may only
happen each year,” Rumbaugh said.  The CVN-79 is the second of the Gerald R. Ford class
carriers Huntington Ingalls is building in  Newport News ,
Virginia.  The Navy proposal “would extend the funding profile from
the original eight to 12 years,” OMB said. The Navy would start
construction in 2015. Initial JFK construction started last
year.  OMB spokesman Ken Baer in an e-mail said, “We are in the
middle of a long and deliberative budget development process,
and no final decisions have been made. Until that process is
complete and the 2013 budget is released,  we cannot comment on
rumors and pre-decisional materials.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
