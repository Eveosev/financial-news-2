U.S. House lawmakers passed
legislation backed by  Netflix Inc. (NFLX)  that would ease a 1988 law
barring disclosure of movie-rental history without a customerâ€™s
written permission.  The House bill, H.R. 2471, passed today in a 303-116 vote.
The measure would let consumers give one-time online consent to
the release of their rental data, clearing the way for U.S.
implementation of a deal that Los Gatos, California-based
Netflix signed with Facebook Inc. in September. The Senate has
yet to introduce its version of the bill.  Netflix, a video-streaming and DVD subscription service,
has said the two-decade-old law stands in the way of the
Facebook agreement, which would make it easier for subscribers
of both services to share their favorite movies.  The House bill would change the Video Privacy Protection
Act, which was enacted after rental records of then-Supreme
Court nominee  Robert Bork  were published in the fall of 1987 by
a Washington tabloid.  To contact the reporter on this story:
