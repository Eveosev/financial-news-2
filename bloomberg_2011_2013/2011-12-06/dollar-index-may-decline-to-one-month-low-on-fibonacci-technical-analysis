The  Dollar Index (DXY)  is set to break
support lines and may fall to a one-month low, Gaitame.com
Research Institute Ltd. said, citing trading patterns.  IntercontinentalExchange Inc.’s index, which tracks the
greenback versus those of six major U.S. trading partners,
closed yesterday 0.4 percent higher than its 20-day average of
78.295 and has been above Nov. 30’s intraday low of 77.923.  “A downward push is likely to be deep” once the gauge
drops past these levels, said Takuya Kawabata, a researcher in
 Tokyo  at a unit of  Japan ’s largest currency margin company.  The Dollar Index may then fall to 77.213, which is the 50
percent retracement level from a Nov. 25 high to an Oct. 27 low,
Kawabata said, citing the daily Fibonacci chart. If the index
slides below that, it’s likely to decline to the 61.8 percent
retracement level of 76.626, he said, the lowest since Nov. 9.  The Dollar Index lost 0.1 percent to 78.605 yesterday.  Fibonacci analysis is based on the theory that prices rise
or fall by certain percentages after reaching a high or low. A
break above resistance, or below support, indicates it may move
to the next level. Support refers to an area where buy orders
may cluster. Resistance is where there may be orders to sell.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns to forecast changes in a security, commodity,
currency or index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
