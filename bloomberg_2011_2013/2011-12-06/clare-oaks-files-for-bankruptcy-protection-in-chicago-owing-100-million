Clare Oaks , operator of a continuing-
care retirement community in Bartlett,  Illinois , filed for
 bankruptcy protection  to restructure its debt.  The not-for-profit company listed assets of $107.2 million
and debt of $136.9 million as of June 30 in Chapter 11 documents
filed yesterday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in  Chicago . Clare Oaks
recorded revenue of $19 million for fiscal year ended June 30.  “Senior living facilities have experienced substantial
declines in occupancy as a result of market changes,” Paul
Rundell, chief restructuring officer of Clare Oaks, said in
court papers. The filing came after the company failed to
negotiate an out-of-court restructuring with its pre-bankruptcy
secured lenders, Rundell said.  The community, which opened in 2007, was founded by members
of the Sisters of St. Joseph of the Third Order of St. Francis,
a Roman Catholic religious institute. An affiliate of Life Care
Services LLC manages the community under a management agreement.  Continuing-care retirement communities provide senior
citizens living accommodations and related health-care services
during their retirement years, court papers show.  Entrance fees for residents range from about $170,000 to
$270,000 based on the size of the unit. In addition, occupants
pay monthly fees ranging from about $1,300 for independent
living units to as much as $7,390 for memory care residents,
court papers show.  The case is In re Clare Oaks, 11-48903,  U.S. Bankruptcy
Court , Northern District of Illinois (Chicago).  To contact the reporter on this story:
