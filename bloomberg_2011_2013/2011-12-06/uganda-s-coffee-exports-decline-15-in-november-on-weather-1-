Coffee exports from  Uganda ,  Africa ’s
biggest exporter of the crop, fell 15 percent in November, the
nation’s Coffee Development Authority said.  Shipments declined to 227,177 60-kilogram (132-pound) bags
from 266,726 bags a year earlier, the agency said today by e-
mail from the capital, Kampala. Exports for the first two months
of the season dropped 2.7 percent to 442,462 bags, according to
a Bloomberg calculation of UCDA data.  Uganda ranks behind  Ethiopia  as Africa’s biggest producer
of the crop, according to the London-based International Coffee
Organization. Robusta beans, which is used in espressos and
instant drinks, account for about 85 percent of the nation’s
annual production. The country consumes less than 3 percent of
its annual output, according to the Eastern African Fine Coffee
Association.  The country’s coffee exports in the 12 months from Oct. 1
through September next year may rise to 3.3 million bags, from
3.15 million bags in 2010-11, because of a bigger crop,
according to the agency. Exports in 2010-11 were worth $448.89
million, the authority said.  Exports in 2010-11 were $448.89 million from 3.15 million
bags, compared with $267.13 million from 2.67 million bags, the
agency said on Oct. 19.  To contact the reporter on this story:
