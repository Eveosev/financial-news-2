Canadian home sales may have slowed
for a third month in November, with fewer transactions seen in
 Vancouver  and moderating growth in Toronto, regional housing
data show.  November sales reported by 10 regional real estate boards
show a 5.6 percent increase from a year earlier, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg News, the slowest annual pace for
this group since May. The 10 markets recorded an 11 percent
annual gain in October.  Canadian home buyers have taken advantage of historically
low  interest rates  and available credit from banks, prompting
Finance Minister  Jim Flaherty  to tighten mortgage rules in
January.  Home sales in Toronto rose 11 percent in November from a
year earlier after growing at an 18 percent pace a month
earlier, according to  data  from the cityâ€™s real estate board.
Vancouver recorded a 5.9 percent drop in purchases from a year
earlier.  The  Canadian Real Estate Association  releases aggregated
national data in the middle of every month.  To contact the reporters on this story:
