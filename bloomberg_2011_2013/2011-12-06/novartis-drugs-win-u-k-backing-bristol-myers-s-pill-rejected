  Novartis AG (NOVN) ’s Tasigna and Glivec
drugs won the backing of the U.K.’s health-cost agency for use
against a rare blood cancer in draft treatment guidelines.  The  National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence 
rejected a competing product,  Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. (BMY) ’s
Sprycel, the agency said in a statement today.  Both Tasigna and Sprycel cost more than 30,000 pounds
($47,000) a patient, the agency said. Novartis offered a price
cut that allowed a recommendation for Tasigna, and the Basel,
Switzerland-based company asked that the discount be kept
confidential, the agency said. The guidelines also confirm a
2003 decision that Glivec is cost-effective.  The agency advises the National Health Service on which
medicines represent value for money.  To contact the reporter on this story:
