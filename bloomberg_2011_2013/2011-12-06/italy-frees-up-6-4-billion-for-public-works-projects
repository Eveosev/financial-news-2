The Italian government infrastructure
committee, known as CIPE, today cleared 4.8 billion euros ($6.4
billion) to fund public-works projects aimed at revamping the
countryâ€™s economic growth.  The funds will be used to upgrade a high-speed rail line in
Northern Italy and for projects including a motorway in the
South and the Mose, the system of adjustable dikes to protect
Venice from high tides that flood the city, the committee said
in an statement published on its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
