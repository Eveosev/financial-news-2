Estacio Participações (ESTC3)  SA, a Brazilian
private university administrator, plans to make as many as four
acquisitions next year to expand its network in the country’s
north and northeast.  The company plans to use 200 million reais ($112 million)
it raised from a local bond sale and $70 million in financing it
received from the  International Finance Corporation , the World
Bank’s arm for the private sector, to complete two to four
acquisitions in 2012, Chief Executive Officer Eduardo Alacay
said at an interview in  New York  yesterday.  Estacio is benefiting from Brazil’s economic  growth  and
better  income distribution  as more than 21 million people left
poverty in the last ten years and unemployment remain near
record lows.  “The public in the Northeast region is increasingly
investing in education,” Alacay said. “Growth dynamics of the
education sector are less volatile than those of the consumer
industry.”  Estacio’s revenue will grow around 13 percent per year over
the next three years, he said.  Estacio acquired four educational institutions this year
in the states of  Rio Grande  do Norte, Roraima and Rio de
Janeiro.  The Rio de Janeiro-based company has 240,000 students now,
with 45,000 in Brazil’s Northeast, Alacay said.  “Brazil today has 6 million university students and it
needs 10 million. Our role is to help in this growth, to
guarantee good-quality education on a mass scale,” Alacay said.  Estacio rose 4.7 percent to 19.45 reais the in Sao Paulo
trading. The shares lost 28 percent this year, compared with a
14 percent drop in the Bovespa benchmark index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
