Japan plans to present options for
its energy mix by the end of March before it draws up a new
master plan in the summer to replace an  energy policy  that
relied on nuclear power.  Proposals being considered include drastically increasing
energy conservation and speeding up the introduction of
renewable energy, according to the draft proposals handed out
today after an Advisory Committee on Natural Resource and Energy
subcommittee meeting in  Tokyo .  Japan is reviewing its policy after public confidence in
nuclear energy was shattered by the March 11 earthquake and
tsunami, which crippled  Tokyo Electric Power Co. ’s Fukushima
Dai-Ichi plant and triggered the worst atomic disaster since
Chernobyl 25 years ago. The existing energy master plan relies
on atomic energy to supply 53 percent of the country’s power
needs by 2030.  “Following the earthquake and the nuclear accident, we
need to revise that energy composition,” according to the
draft.  Japan  may allow consumers to decide how their power is
generated and offer bigger incentives for power saving to
stimulate changes in the country’s energy supply structure, the
draft said.  The nation needs to move away from the current system,
where 10 utilities and one wholesaler control the power
transmission network, making it difficult for independent
companies to enter the market, the subcommittee said in the
draft.  Regional utilities, led by  Tokyo Electric , and  Electric
Power Development Co. , known as J-Power, control the grid.  To contact the reporter on this story:
