Slovakia’s economic  growth  slowed to
3 percent in the third quarter from 3.5 percent in the previous
three-month period as the eastern euro-region member feels the
effect of the sovereign debt crisis.  On a quarterly basis, gross domestic product grew 0.8
percent from the second quarter, slowing from a 0.9 percent
advance in the previous period, the Slovak Statistical Office
said on its  web site, citing final data. The annual result
exceeds a 2.9 percent preliminary estimate released on Nov. 15.  The Slovak economy relies on exports to drive growth,
making it vulnerable to a slowdown in western  Europe , its main
trading partner. Households are also reluctant to spend as
employment hasn’t fully recovered to levels before the 2009
crisis and the economy is heading toward a deeper slowdown.  The  Finance Ministry  expects the economy to grow 3 percent
in 2011, slowing from a 4.2 percent expansion in the previous
year. In 2012, growth is set to falter to 1.7 percent, prompting
the government to give up on its original goal to reduce the
 budget deficit  to 3.8 percent of GDP.  Household consumption fell 0.9 percent in the third quarter
from the same period last year, while  government spending  was
down 3.3 percent and investment rose 5.9 percent. Exports of
goods and services rose 6.8 percent, while imports dropped 1.8
percent, the office said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
