(Corrects headline and first paragraph so say policy is
“progressive.")  Xstrata Plc (XTA)  will continue its
‘‘progressive’’ dividend policy, Chief Executive Officer Mick
Davis said today at the company’s investor day meeting in
 London .  The Collahuasi copper venture in  Chile  ‘‘hasn’t been a
great deliverer” this year, Davis said. “It’s been a
disappointing exercise for us.”  Even so, Xstrata will be able to deliver significant cost
reductions overall next year, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
