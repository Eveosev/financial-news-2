Ukraine’s  inflation  rate unexpectedly
declined in November to its lowest level since May 2003 as a
record grain harvest helped ease food costs.  Consumer prices rose 5.2 percent from a year earlier
compared with 5.4 percent in October, slowing for a fifth month,
the state statistics committee in the capital, Kiev, said today
on its website. That’s below the 5.7 percent median estimate of
11 economists in a  Bloomberg  survey. Prices rose 0.1 percent
from the previous month.  Inflation may slow to 7.5 percent this year from 9.1
percent in 2010, central bank Governor Serhiy Arbuzov said last
month. That would be the lowest rate since 2002. Prime Minister
 Mykola Azarov ’s government and the central bank are targeting
inflation below 10 percent next year, slowing to 5 percent in
2014, a rate that’s optimal for economic growth, according to a
statement today on the bank’s website.  The regulator “is unlikely to cut its policy rates as the
recent inflation slowdown was largely caused by a reduction in
unprocessed food prices and can hardly be considered
sustainable,” Iryna Piontkivska, an economist at Troika Dialog
in Kiev, said by phone. The central bank’s main discount rate is
7.75 percent.  Producer prices, an early indicator of inflation, rose 17.3
percent in November from a year earlier and advanced 0.6 percent
from the previous month, the statistics committee said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
