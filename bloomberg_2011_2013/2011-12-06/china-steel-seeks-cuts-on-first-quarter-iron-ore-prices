China Steel Corp. (2002) , Taiwan’s largest
steelmaker, is in talks with iron ore suppliers to cut first-
quarter prices amid declining demand.  The Kaohsiung-based steelmaker is negotiating with  Vale SA (VALE3) 
and other producers, Hung jui-pen, the company’s public
relations officer, said today by phone. China Steel and Baoshan
Iron & Steel Co. have asked suppliers, including  BHP Billiton
Ltd. (BHP)  and  Rio Tinto Group (RIO) , to reduce prices by 23 percent to cut
costs, according to the Economic Daily News.  The Taiwanese company joins mainland Chinese rivals in
cutting steel prices and production on expected weaker demand
from automakers and builders. China Steel hasn’t joined with
Boasteel or other mills to seek a cut in iron ore prices, the
company said in a statement to the  Taiwan  stock exchange. China
Steel fell 1.7 percent to NT$28.4 in Taipei trading at 13:30 p.m.  China Steel may reduce output by as much as 20 percent in
December as orders for the month decline, the Taipei-based
Commercial Times reported Nov. 5, citing an unidentified
official at the mill. The company said on Nov. 24 that it will
cut domestic prices on seven products by an average 7 percent in
January and February.  To contact the reporters on this story:
