Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) , Europe’s
largest oil company, expects growth in production next year to
be curbed by a slowing economy in the region.  “We see softening of the market,” Chief Executive Officer
 Peter Voser  said in an interview. “The economy will be
softening to 2012” in Europe “but we are still positively
optimistic for the world and we will still have growth. And the
outlook for 2013, 2014, 2015 should be more positive.”  European energy demand has also been reduced by mild
weather in the fourth quarter, Voser said in Doha, Qatar.  In March, Shell said production next year would rise to 3.5
million barrels a day. Extraction will reach 3.7 million by 2014
because of projects including the Pearl gas-to-liquids and
Qatargas 4 liquefied natural-gas ventures in the  Middle East .  Last year, production increased 5.5 percent to 3.314
million barrels of oil equivalent a day.  To contact the reporters on this story:
