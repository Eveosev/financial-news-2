A gauge of  Australian construction 
showed the building industry contracted at a slower pace last
month after the central bank cut  interest rates  for the first
time in 2 1/2 years.  The construction performance index rose to 39.6 in November
from 34.7 a month earlier, a survey by the Australian Industry
Group and the Housing Industry Association released in Sydney
today showed. The result was the 18th consecutive month under
50, the dividing line between expansion and contraction.  “The construction sector remains very uneven” and
“appears to be pulling back from the the accelerating pace of
decline reached in August and September,” Peter Burn, director
of public policy at the Australian Industry Group, said in a
statement.  Reserve Bank  of Australia Governor  Glenn Stevens  lowered
the benchmark borrowing cost a quarter percentage point to 4.5
percent on Nov. 1, the first reduction in 31 months, and
followed it yesterday with a cut to 4.25 percent to spur demand.
Employment in  Australia  weakened this year as the currency’s
climb hurt non-resource companies and consumers saved cash.  Today’s report showed new orders advanced 6.7 points to
38.6, and a gauge of employment rose 4.6 points to 41.9 last
month. Construction of houses gained 5.3 points to 38.6, while
apartments slid 2.2 points to 23.4, it showed.  Investors are betting Stevens will lower rates again at the
RBA’s next meeting in February to 4 percent, interbank cash-rate
futures show.  The Australian dollar, the world’s fifth-most traded
currency, was at $1.0246 at 8:56 a.m. in Sydney. It has weakened
in recent months as  Europe ’s debt crisis intensified, having
reached $1.1081 on July 27, the strongest since exchange
controls were scrapped in 1983.  To contact the reporter on this story:
