Bayerische Motoren Werke AG Chief
Executive Officer  Norbert Reithofer  said an end to the euro
would mean a “partial collapse” of  Germany ’s export industry,
 vbw-Unternehmermagazin  reported, citing an interview.  “Those that talk calmly about the euro and whether we
really need it should think again,” Reithofer was cited as
saying. “They should ask themselves, where would most German
exports go, and what would happen when a deutsche mark would
strongly appreciate against other currencies.”  “It would lead to a partial collapse of the German export
industry, and that is putting it conservatively,” Reithofer
said, the Bavarian publication reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
