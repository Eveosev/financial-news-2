The U.K. government is considering
whether to impose a charge on long-term welfare recipients who
sell their homes in return for helping with mortgage payments.  The Department for Work and Pensions currently pays 400
million pounds ($625 million) a year to welfare recipients under
its  Support for Mortgage Interest  program. It’s paid at 3.63
percent, regardless of the loan rate, on as much as 200,000
pounds of debt.  Welfare Reform Minister David Freud said today he was
looking at whether new claimants, who go on to take the money
for long periods, should have to agree to a charge against their
property, to be paid when the home is sold.  “The current system of SMI payments does not encourage
people to get on top of their own finances,” Freud said in an
e-mailed statement. “It is also not sustainable. In the future
this type of support must be fair and affordable so we are
seeking views from experts and the wider public, including
options for putting a charge on the homes of future claimants so
when they sell up we can recoup some of the costs.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
