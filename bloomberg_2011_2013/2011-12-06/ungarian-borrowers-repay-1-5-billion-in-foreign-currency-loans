Hungarian borrowers repaid 338.9
billion forint ($1.5 billion) in foreign-currency loans by Nov.
27 under a government program allowing mortgages to be
terminated at below-market exchange rates, financial regulator
 PSZAF  said.  Repayment of the 54,563 loans involved amounted to 248.4
billion forint at the discounted rates of 180 forint per Swiss
franc, 250 per euro and 200 forint per 100 yen, PSZAF said on
its website today.  The figures published by PSZAF are in line with comments by
the watchdog’s chairman Karoly Szasz on Dec. 4 that the program
cost the industry 90 billion forint in the first two months it
was in effect.  Hungarian lawmakers approved legislation on Sept. 19 that
allowed early repayment of foreign-currency home loans, forcing
lenders to take losses. The law may “substantially weaken”
financial stability and poses risks to public finances, the
 European Central Bank  said last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
