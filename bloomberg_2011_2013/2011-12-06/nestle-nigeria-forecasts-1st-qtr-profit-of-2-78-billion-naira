Nestle Foods Nigeria Plc (NESTLE) , the
country’s biggest food company by market value, forecast a 25
percent increase in first-quarter profit to 2.78 billion naira
($17.2 million).  Revenue will be 22.7 billion naira for the three months
through March, the Lagos-based company said today in a statement
published on the website of the  Nigerian Stock Exchange .  Nestle Foods, a unit of Nestle SA, the world’s biggest food
company, aims to double its business in Africa’s most populous
country of more than 167 million people within three years, the
company said in February after it opened a factory near Lagos,
the commercial capital. Nigeria is Nestle’s second-biggest
market on the continent after South Africa.  Nestle’s shares were unchanged at 400 naira by the 2:30
p.m. close in Lagos. The stock has gained 30 percent this year,
compared with a 21 percent decline in the Nigerian Stock
Exchange  All-Share Index. (NGSEINDX)   To contact the reporter on this story:
