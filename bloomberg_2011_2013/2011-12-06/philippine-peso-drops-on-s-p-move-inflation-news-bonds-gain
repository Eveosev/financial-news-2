The Philippine peso fell to a one-
week low after  Standard & Poor’s  said it may downgrade the
ratings of 15 European nations amid the region’s debt crisis.  Government bonds advanced after data showed inflation
slowed last month and central bank Governor Amando Tetangco said
 interest rates  may be cut early next year to help the economy.
The Manila-based  Asian Development Bank  trimmed its growth
forecasts for the  Philippines , saying banks in the country have
substantial exposure to  Europe .  “The peso is reacting to the S&P rating news,” said
Fernando Mangalindan, who trades sovereign bonds at Philippine
Savings Bank in Manila. “The inflation report is good for the
local  bond market  and we could see one rate cut in the first
quarter of next year.”  The peso dropped 0.4 percent to 43.46 per dollar in  Manila ,
trimming this month’s advance to 0.4 percent, according to
Tullett Prebon Plc. The currency traded at the weakest level
since Nov. 29.  Asian Development Bank predicts the Philippine economy will
expand 3.7 percent in 2011 and 4.8 percent in 2012, according to
a  report  published today. The forecasts compare with September
estimates for growth of 4.7 percent and 5.1 percent,
respectively.  Consumer prices  rose 4.8 percent in November from a year
earlier, following a 5.2 percent gain in October, the statistics
office said today. Economists had expected a 4.9 percent
increase, based on the median estimate in a Bloomberg News
survey.  Bonds Gain  The inflation data and Tetangco’s comments are “negative
