Sharp Corp. ,  Samsung Electronics Co. (005930) ,
and six other makers of liquid crystal display panels used in
computers and televisions agreed to pay $388 million to settle
price-fixing claims by direct purchasers of the products.  Sharp,  Japan ’s largest panel maker, paid $105 million;
Samsung, the world’s largest TV maker, paid $82.7 million; and
 Chimei Innolux Corp. (3481) , Taiwan’s largest maker of display panels,
paid $78 million, according to filings yesterday in  San
Francisco  federal court.  The companies allegedly fixed prices of the panels, driving
up prices for purchasers who bought the screens or goods
containing them from 1999 to 2006, according to a class action,
or group lawsuit, filed in 2007.  The litigation stemmed from a U.S. Justice Department
investigation that led to guilty pleas by LG Display Co.,
Chunghwa Picture Tubes and Sharp. The companies agreed in 2008
and 2009 to pay $585 million in criminal fines, the U.S. said.  In the class action accord, the companies denied
wrongdoing. A federal judge gave preliminary approval to the
eight settlements Oct. 4, according to court records. A final
approval hearing is scheduled for Dec. 19.  Chris Goodhart , a spokeswoman for Suwon, South Korea-based
Samsung, didn’t immediately return a call seeking comment about
the settlement. E-mails seeking comment after normal business
hours sent to Miyuki Nakayama, a spokeswoman for Osaka-based
Sharp, and from Miaoli, Taiwan-based Chimei’s public relations
department, weren’t immediately answered.  The case is In Re TFT-LCD (Flat Panel) Antitrust
Litigation, 07-01827, U.S. District Court for the Northern
District of California (San Francisco).  To contact the reporter on this story:
