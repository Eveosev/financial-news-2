Latvia’s estimate for 2.5 percent
economic growth next year is “too optimistic” because
conditions in the euro area are deteriorating, said central bank
Governor Ilmars Rimsevics said.  “This estimate is too optimistic and means that at the
time when the budget estimate was accepted,  Europe  was in one
situation and three months later the situation has worsened,”
Rimsevics said today on Latvian Television program  900 Seconds .
“We have to be ready no later than at the beginning of next
year to look at what else we can do.”  Rimsevics’ concern puts him at odds with Finance Minister
Andris Vilks, who said yesterday at a news conference that the
forecast was “very conservative.” The government yesterday
submitted the 2012 budget to parliament, its last under a 7.5
billion-euro ($10 billion) loan program from a group led by the
European Union and the  International Monetary Fund .  The Baltic country plans to cut its deficit to 2.5 percent
of gross domestic product next year so it can adopt the euro in
2014.  Latvia will have passed spending cuts and tax increases of
2.3 billion lati ($4.4 billion), or 17.8 percent of GDP, since
2008, when it sought its international loan, Vilks said
yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
