Cyprus is giving  Noble Energy Inc. (NBL) 
the right to transfer 30 percent of its gas-drilling rights in
Block 12 of the country’s exclusive economic zone to  Israel ’s
 Delek Group (DLEKG) , said Praxoula Antoniadou, the minister of commerce,
industry and tourism.  Noble remains the concession’s sole operator and will
fulfil its financial and technical obligations to Cyprus,
Antoniadou said in an interview today on state-run CyBC radio.  To contact the reporters on this story:
