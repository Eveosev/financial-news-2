RWE AG ’s Czech unit, the largest
supplier of natural gas to the country’s households, lost 13
percent of its customers in two years because its prices are too
high,  Hospodarske Noviny  reported, citing company spokesman
Martin Chalupsky.  RWE, which has long-term contracts with Gazprom OAO, is
losing customers to competitors who buy cheaper gas on the spot
market, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
