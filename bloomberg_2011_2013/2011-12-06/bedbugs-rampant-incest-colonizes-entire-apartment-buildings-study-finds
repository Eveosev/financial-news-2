Like any truly bad roommate, a single
female bedbug can infest an entire apartment, a study shows.  Bedbugs inbreed without ill effects, the researchers said,
so even a single female bedbug can lead to a colony of the
blood-sucking insects as a result of rampant incest.   Three colonized buildings in  North Carolina  and  New Jersey  
suggested the invasion started with only one or two insects. 
Another study traced 21 infestations from Maine to  Florida  and 
found most began in a single room.  “This tells us it’s absolutely critical to detect bedbugs
early,” said Coby Schal, an urban entomology professor at  North
Carolina State University  in Raleigh, in a telephone interview.
“The bed bugs were introduced once, which suggests the
frequency of introductions is low. It’s a rare event.”  Bedbugs were almost eliminated in the U.S. 60 years ago by
the pesticide DDT. International travel probably aided a
resurgence in the past 30 years, said Schal, also a study author.
The research was presented today at the  American Society of
Tropical Medicine and Hygiene in Philadelphia . While their bites
cause itchy allergic reactions, they don’t spread disease.  The number of infestations from the insects, which feed
only on blood, has grown as much as 100-fold since 1990, said
Rajeev Vaidyanathan, associate director of diseases from animals
at  SRI International , which is based in Menlo Park,  California ,
in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
