Woodside Petroleum Ltd. (WPL)  fell in
Sydney trading after a report said a court ruled that compulsory
land acquisition notices by Western  Australia  state for the
company’s Browse natural-gas processing hub were unlawful.  Australia’s second-biggest oil and gas producer dropped as
much as 1.8 percent to A$33.56 and traded at A$33.57 at 2:44
p.m. local time. The stock had risen as much as 0.6 percent
before the report by the Australian Associated Press. S&P/ASX
200 Index declined 1.1 percent.  Three land acquisition notices were declared invalid by
Chief Justice Wayne Martin of the Western Australia Supreme
Court, the AAP reported citing a lawyer representing an
indigenous group opposing the liquefied natural gas plant at
James Price Point. The court decision won’t affect the project’s
schedule, Woodside said in an e-mailed statement.  Chief Executive Officer  Peter Coleman , who took control of
Woodside in May, plans to develop an estimated A$75 billion ($76
billion) in Australian LNG projects with existing partners
including BP Plc and Chevron Corp. The company said previously
it was aiming to approve the Browse venture in mid-2012.  The Perth-based company’s partners in Browse are Chevron
Corp., Royal Dutch Shell Plc, BP and BHP Billiton Ltd. The
project may cost A$38 billion, according to an estimate by
Deutsche Bank AG.  To contact the reporter on this story:
