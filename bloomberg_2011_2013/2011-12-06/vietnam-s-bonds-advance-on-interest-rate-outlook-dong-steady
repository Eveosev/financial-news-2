Vietnam ’s one-year bonds advanced on
speculation consumer-price gains will slow and  interest rates 
will be cut. The dong was little changed.  Inflation is under control and the pace of price increases
will slow to about 9 percent next year, Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung said today. Consumer prices increased by 20 percent in
November from a year earlier, down from this year’s high of 23
percent in August, official data show. The government has asked
the  State Bank  of Vietnam to consider lowering interest rates,
Vu Duc Dam, chairman of the government office, said Dec. 1.  “Yields are declining because investors are expecting that
interest rates will come down,” said Cao Tan Phat, a Ho Chi
Minh City-based analyst at ACB Securities Co.  Yields  on one-year government debt fell 10 basis points, or
0.10 percentage point, to 12.78 percent, according to a daily
fixing from banks compiled by Bloomberg.  The dong traded at 21,008 per dollar as of 2:43 p.m. in
Hanoi, compared with 21,011 yesterday, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The central bank set the  reference rate 
at 20,803, unchanged since Oct. 28, its website showed. The
currency is allowed to trade up to 1 percent on either side of
the official rate.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
