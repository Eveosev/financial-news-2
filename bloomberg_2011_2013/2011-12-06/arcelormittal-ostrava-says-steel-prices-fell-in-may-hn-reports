ArcelorMittal (MT)  Ostrava, the Czech unit
of the world’s largest steelmaker, said steel prices started to
fall in May, Chief Executive Officer Tapas Rajderkar told
 Hospodarske Noviny .  The company doesn’t have many indications when prices might
recover, Rajderkar added in an interview.  The second and third quarters, usually the best, weren’t in
2011, while the final quarter has been the worst for the year,
Rajderkar told the newspaper.  The company, which last week said it will cut 600 jobs
through voluntary buyouts and attrition, may dismiss more people
depending on the market, the newspaper added.  To contact the reporter on this story: Lenka Ponikelska in
