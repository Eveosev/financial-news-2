Asia ’s naphtha crack spread widened,
signaling increased profit for refiners making the petrochemical
feedstock. SK Innovation Co.,  South Korea ’s largest refiner,
said a power outage shut part of its Ulsan refinery.  Light Distillates  Naphtha ’s premium to London-traded Brent crude futures rose
to $64.01 a metric ton as of 4 p.m. Singapore time from $58.48
at the end of trading yesterday in Asia, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. This crack spread is a measure of
processing profit.  Gunvor Group Ltd. sold 50,000 barrels of  92-RON gasoline  to
Gracewood International Ltd. in Singapore at $110.80 a barrel,
based on a Bloomberg survey of traders who monitored
transactions on the Platts window.  SK Innovation said the  power outage  shut “parts of
Operations” at the 840,000 barrel-a-day Ulsan refinery. The
electricity loss lasted about 20 minutes and affected
“a majority” of the units at the complex, Eom Ik Hoon, a
company spokesman at SK Innovation, said by phone from  Seoul .  Middle Distillates  Reliance Industries Ltd. sold two 150,000-barrel cargoes of
 gasoil , or diesel, with 10 parts-per-million of sulfur in
Singapore, according to the Bloomberg survey. The owner of the
world’s largest refining complex received $3.50 a barrel over
benchmark quotes from Royal Dutch Shell Plc and BP Plc for the
cargoes.  Shell sold 150,000 barrels of 0.5 percent sulfur gasoil to
Vitol Group, and BP sold a similar cargo to Hin Leong Trading
Pte, each at a premium of 60 cents a barrel, the survey showed.  Gasoil’s premium to Asian marker Dubai crude increased 20
cents to $18.05 a barrel at 2 p.m. Singapore time, based on data
from PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a broker. This  crack spread  is the
widest in a week.  Jet fuel’s premium to gasoil climbed 5 cents to $1.40 a
barrel, PVM data showed. A rising  regrade  indicates it is more
profitable to produce  aviation fuel  than diesel.  Fuel Oil   Brightoil Petroleum Holdings Ltd. bought two 20,000-ton
cargoes of  380-centistoke  fuel oil from Koch Industries Inc. in
Singapore, according to the Bloomberg survey. The Hong Kong-
based trader paid $17.50 a ton over average January quotes. Hin
Leong purchased a similar cargo from China International United
Petroleum & Chemical Corp., or Unipec, at an $8.50 premium to
December prices.  Fuel oil’s  discount  to Dubai crude narrowed 81 cents to
$5.03 a barrel at 2 p.m. Singapore time, based on PVM data. The
difference widened $2.94 over the previous four days, signaling
losses for refiners turning oil into residual products.  The premium of  180-centistoke  fuel oil to 380-centistoke
grade fell 25 cents to $13.75 a ton, PVM said. This  viscosity
spread  narrowed for the first time in five days, meaning bunker,
or marine fuel, dropped less than higher-quality fuel oil.  To contact the reporters on this story:
