Kazakhstan  plans next month to start
a fund made up of “problem” assets to help the country’s banks
saddled with souring loans, said Grigori Marchenko, chairman of
the central bank.  The share of bad credits will decrease next year as the
fund transfers some of the non-performing loans off bank balance
sheets and lending grows, Marchenko told reporters today in the
nation’s commercial capital, Almaty. Total loans may grow
between 12 percent and 15 percent next year, he said.  Loans overdue by more than 90 days at Kazakhstan’s 39 banks
reached 3.17 trillion tenge ($21.5 billion), or 31.4 percent of
total holdings, led by BTA Bank with 1.42 trillion tenge,
central bank data show. BTA may ask the Kazakh government to
back its second debt restructuring or provide additional state
funds to help avert bankruptcy, according to two people with
direct knowledge of the matter.  Kazakhstan initially aimed to create a fund for non-
performing loans by July 1. It may sell 150 billion tenge of
bonds, with the National Bank of Kazakhstan buying a third of
the securities should lenders and pension funds purchase two-
thirds of the debt in the first two sales, Marchenko said April
27.  To contact the reporter on this story:
