Zimbabwean police detained for
questioning Andrew Moyse, director of the Media Monitoring
Project of  Zimbabwe , the organization said.  Moyse was taken by five plain-clothed policemen from
Zimbabwe’s Law and Order Section and is being questioned about
“publishing or communicating false statements prejudicial to
the state,” the MMPZ said in an e-mailed statement today. He is
also being questioned about the possession of computer disks
containing information about massacres conducted in the 1980s,
it said.  Moyse “wasn’t arrested” though his detention follows the
arrest of two MMPZ officials in the western town of Gwanda
yesterday, said the statement.  Calls to Zimbabwe’s police spokesman in Harare weren’t
immediately answered.  To contact the reporter on this story:
