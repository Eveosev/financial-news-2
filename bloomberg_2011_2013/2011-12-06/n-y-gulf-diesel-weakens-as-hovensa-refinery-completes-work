Diesel fuel in  New York  and the U.S.
Gulf weakened as Hovensa LLC’s St. Croix refinery returned to
normal production levels after completing maintenance.  “Work was completed on several units including one of the
sulfur complexes and the acid plant,” David Roznowski, a
spokesman for the company, said in an e-mail. “Planning allowed
us to meet all customer commitments during the 2-month planned
turnaround,” he said.  The premium for ultra-low-sulfur diesel in  New York Harbor 
slipped 0.25 cent to 1.88 cents a gallon versus heating oil
futures traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 3:30 p.m.,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Prompt delivery rose
2.68 cents to $3.0405 a gallon.  The Hovensa refinery, a joint venture of state oil company
 Petroleos de Venezuela SA  and  Hess Corp. (HES) , receives and processes
crude oil from around the world via tankers. The plant sent
47,000 barrels a day of heating oil and diesel to the U.S. East
Coast in September, Energy Department data show.  The same fuel in the  Gulf Coast  fell 1.4 cents against
futures to widen its discount to 5.5 cents. It’s the lowest
level since Jan. 3.  To contact the reporter on this story:
