U.S. House Republicans led by
Representative  Darrell Issa  of  California  are investigating the
Environmental Protection Agency’s methane-emission estimates for

misleading, according to an e-mailed statement today from Issa,
chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee.  To contact the reporter on this story:
