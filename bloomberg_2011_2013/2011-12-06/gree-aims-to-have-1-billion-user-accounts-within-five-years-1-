Gree Inc. (3632) ,  Japan ’s second-biggest
social-networking service, aims to have 1 billion user accounts
in three to five years.  Gree  plans  to begin operating its new integrated global
platform in the three months ending June 30 to compete with
Facebook Inc. and  Zynga Inc. , it said. The Tokyo-based company
acquired Burlingame, California-based online-games network
 OpenFeint Inc.  for $104 million in April as it seeks to expand
overseas.  “Three to five years is possible,” President Yoshikazu Tanaka told reporters today in  Tokyo . “As social-networking
services expand, I believe it’s not far in the future.”  Gree has 150 million user accounts globally, with overseas
operations in nine countries. The social-network operator will
offer user-support services in 14 languages starting next year,
it said.  OpenFeint provides more than 5,000 games for smartphones,
it said on its website.  Shares of Gree fell 0.6 percent to 2,508 yen as of the 3
p.m. close of trading in Tokyo. The stock has more than doubled
this year, compared with a 16 percent decline in Japan’s
benchmark  Nikkei 225 Stock Average. (NKY)   To contact the reporter on this story:
