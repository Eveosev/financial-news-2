A court in  Nigeria  sentenced Ali
Sanda Umar Konduga, said to be a former spokesman of the Boko
Haram militant Islamic sect, to three years in jail today after
he was convicted on two felony charges, according to court
proceedings in Abuja, the capital.  Presiding Magistrate Oyebola Oyewunmi said he considered
Konduga’s “plea for leniency” in sentencing him following his
conviction on Nov. 22. Ali Ndume, a serving senator in the
legislature who pleaded not guilty when charged along with
Konduga, was denied bail until a trial date was determined.  Authorities in  Africa ’s top oil producer blame Boko Haram,
which draws inspiration from  Afghanistan ’s Taliban movement, for
a spate of bombings and attacks in the mainly Muslim north and
Abuja since last year.  The group claimed responsibility for the Aug. 26 suicide
car-bombing of the United Nations building in Abuja that killed
24 people. The group also said it was behind attacks in the
northeastern Yobe and Borno states on Nov. 4, which killed at
least 150 people and wounded dozens, according to Civil Rights
Congress, a rights group based in the region.  At least 425 people have died in attacks by the sect this
year, according to New York-based  Human Rights Watch .  To contact the reporter on this story:
