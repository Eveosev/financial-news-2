SuccessFactors Inc. (SFSF) , the software
company that SAP AG is buying for $3.4 billion, announced its
own deal today: the purchase of closely held  Jobs2Web Inc.  for
$110 million in cash.  Jobs2Web makes Web-delivered software that helps recruiters
use Twitter, LinkedIn and other sites to hunt for candidates.
SuccessFactors didn’t disclose the Jobs2Web agreement when the
SAP deal was announced on Dec. 3 because it wasn’t completed
yet, said SuccessFactors Chief Executive Officer Lars Dalgaard.  Jobs2Web, based in  Minnetonka ,  Minnesota , counts Microsoft
Corp., PepsiCo Inc. and Merck & Co. among its customers,
Dalgaard said. He declined to disclose Jobs2Web’s sales, saying
only that it has about 120 employees and is growing faster than
SuccessFactors’ own 77 percent third-quarter revenue growth.  “I’m going to do a lot more with this,” he said,
referring to Jobs2Web’s technology.  SAP is acquiring  San Mateo , California-based SuccessFactors
to expand deeper into cloud-computing software, which is
delivered as a subscription service online. Dalgaard will join
SAP and lead its cloud efforts after the deal closes in the
first quarter, possibly in January, he said.  Saswato Das, a SAP spokesman, said SuccessFactors is still
a separate company and it has the prerogative to make deals
until the SAP  acquisition  closes.  SuccessFactors shares rose 5 cents to $39.80 today, trading
near the $40 acquisition price. The shares had lost 9.4 percent
of their value this year before the deal was announced.  To contact the reporters on this story:
