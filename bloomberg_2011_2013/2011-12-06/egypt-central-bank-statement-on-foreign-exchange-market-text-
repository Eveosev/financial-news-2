Following is a statement from the
Central Bank of  Egypt  on the countryâ€™s foreign exchange market:  The central bank of Egypt denies the announcement published
by El-Shorouk newspaper on Dec. 6, 2011, regarding the  exchange
rate  and foreign reserves. The central bank stresses that any
announcement related to foreign exchange, foreign reserves, and
monetary policy would only be communicated by the governor.  In addition, the central bank would like to underscore that
it continues to safeguard an orderly foreign exchange market,
which has been the case since the launch of the foreign exchange
inter-bank market in December 2004.  To contact the reporter on this story:
