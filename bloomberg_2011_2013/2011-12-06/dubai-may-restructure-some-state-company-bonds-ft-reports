Dubai may restructure some bonds
issued by state-owned companies next year to help meet $3.8
billion in debt payments, The Financial Times reported, citing a
senior government official it didnâ€™t identify by name.  The official said he was confident a commercial deal could
be reached with bondholders, the newspaper said. The emirate is
also exploring other options including raising $2 billion from
local banks to help meet debt repayments next year, the London-
