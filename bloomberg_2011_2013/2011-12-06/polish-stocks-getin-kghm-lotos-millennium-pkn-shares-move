Poland’s  WIG20 Index (WIG20)  declined 18.95,
or 0.8 percent, to 2,273.18 at 2:52 p.m. in Warsaw, after
closing at a two-week high yesterday.  The following are among the most active stocks on the
 Warsaw Stock Exchange  today. Stock symbols follow company names.  KGHM Polska Miedz SA (KGH)  , Poland’s sole copper and
silver producer, declined 0.8 percent to 131.7 zloty, after
closing at a two-week high yesterday. The government plans to
raise about 1.8 billion zloty ($540 million) in new tax on
copper and silver extraction in 2012, the PAP newswire reported,
citing the budget draft approved by the cabinet today.  Copper fell in New York on revived concern that Europe’s
sovereign-debt crisis may worsen after  Standard & Poor’s  said it
might lower credit ratings for euro-area nations including
Germany and France.  PKN Orlen SA (PKN)  , Poland’s biggest oil company, fell
3.1 percent to 39.84 zloty and  Grupa Lotos SA (LTS)  , the
second-largest refiner, retreated 1.3 percent to 25.41 zloty as
crude oil declined.  PKO Bank Polski SA (PKO)  , Poland’s biggest lender, lost
1.5 percent to 34.05 zloty and state-controlled insurer  PZU SA (PZU) 
 fell 0.3 percent to 329 zloty, the first drop in six
days. The government plans to sell further stakes in the
companies next year to help finance the deficit, PAP reported,
citing the budget draft.  To contact the reporter on this story:
