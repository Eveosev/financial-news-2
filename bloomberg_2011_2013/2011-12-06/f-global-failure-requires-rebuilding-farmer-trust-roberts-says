The sudden collapse of MF Global
Holdings Ltd. will require lawmakers and regulators to rebuild
farmer trust in commodity markets, U.S. Senator Pat Roberts of
 Kansas  said.  “We have to convince our farmers and ranchers that our
financial markets are a viable risk-management tool,” Roberts,
the top Republican on the Senate Agriculture Committee, said
today in a speech at a  Washington  conference organized by Farm
Journal.  MF Global sought  bankruptcy protection  on Oct. 31 after
making wrong-way bets on European sovereign debt. Congress and
federal regulators including the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission are
investigating as much as $1.2 billion in missing customer funds.  The House Agriculture Committee last week voted to subpoena
Jon S. Corzine, the former chairman and chief executive officer
of MF Global, for a Dec. 8 hearing. The Senate Agriculture
Committee and the House Financial Services Oversight and
Investigations subcommittee separately announced plans to
consider subpoenas for Corzine this week.  Debbie Stabenow , the Michigan Democrat who leads the Senate
farm panel, said she expected the committee will issue a
subpoena today as Corzine, a former U.S. senator and Democratic
governor of New Jersey, hasn’t responded to a request for
testimony.  Roberts said MF Global is the “number-one” issue farmers
have been asking him about in recent weeks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
