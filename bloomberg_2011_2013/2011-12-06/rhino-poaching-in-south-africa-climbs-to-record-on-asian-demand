Rhinoceros poaching in  South Africa 
climbed to a record for a second year in 2011 amid growing
demand from Asia, where the animal’s horns are used in medicine.  As many as 405 rhinos have been killed so far this year, 22
percent more than in 2010, the South African National Parks
authority said in an e-mailed statement today.  Most of the animals were killed in the  Kruger National Park 
and in the country’s Limpopo and KwaZulu-Natal provinces, the
authority said. The number of arrests related to poaching
increased 27 percent to 210, it said.  South  Africa , home to 93 percent of Africa’s rhino
population, met with representatives from  Vietnam  in September
to address growing demand for rhino horns in  Asia , where they
are used for their supposed medicinal properties, including as a
purported cure for cancer.  The Javan rhino, one of three Asian species, is now extinct
in Vietnam after the last one was found dead in October,
according to the World Wildlife Fund. The Indian and Sumatran
rhinos make up the other Asian species.  White rhinos weigh as much as 2.7 metric tons (5,952
pounds) while black rhinos weigh up to 1.35 tons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
