A U.S. House subcommittee will hold a
hearing into reports of  General Motors Co. (GM) ’s Chevrolet Volt
catching fire, a spokesman for Representative  Darrell Issa  said.  The regulatory affairs subcommittee, led by Representative
 Jim Jordan , an Ohio Republican, will schedule a hearing for late
January, Jeffrey Solsby, a spokesman for the Oversight and
Government Reform Committee led by Issa, said today in an e-
mail.  The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has been
investigating three fires earlier this year in the Volt’s
battery pack following separate collision tests. GM has said it
is working with NHTSA to find the cause and determine if a fix
is needed.  Greg Martin , a GM spokesman, said the company hasn’t been
notified of the hearing and declined to comment in an e-mail.  The Volt “is safe to drive,” U.S. Transportation
Secretary Ray LaHood told reporters on  Capitol Hill  today.  LaHood said the department didn’t withhold information
about the battery fires after U.S. crash tests. The department
announced a safety investigation of the Volt Nov. 25.  “We’re not in the business of protecting the automobile
industry,” LaHood said. “We’re in the business of making sure
the cars are safe. That’s why we’re doing the investigation of
the Volt.”  The Detroit News reported the planned House hearing earlier
today via a Twitter account.  To contact the reporters on this story:
