Estonia “doesn’t share the
pessimism” about the euro region’s future with  Standard &
Poor’s , which yesterday warned that it may downgrade 15 nations
in the currency bloc, the  Finance Ministry  said.  A credit-rating downgrade “wouldn’t affect” Estonian
assets as the government has no plans to borrow from the market,
the ministry said in an e-mailed statement today from the
capital, Tallinn.  Estonia’ AA- rating, which was raised two notches by S&P in
August, may be cut by as many as two notches depending on the
result of a summit of European Union leaders on Dec. 9, the debt
evaluator said yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
