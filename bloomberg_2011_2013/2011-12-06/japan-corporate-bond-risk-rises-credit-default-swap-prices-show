The cost of insuring corporate bonds
in  Japan  against non-payment rose, according to credit-default
swap traders.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index increased 3 basis points to
193 basis points as of 9:44 a.m. in Tokyo, Deutsche Bank AG
prices show. Thatâ€™s the first increase in more than a week,
according to data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan added 0.5 basis point to 194.5 basis
points as of 8:44 a.m. in  Hong Kong , Credit Agricole prices
show. The Markit iTraxx Australia index fell 1 basis point to
183 as of 11:44 a.m. in Sydney, according to Credit Agricole SA.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default, and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
