(Corrects Ambrosiadou’s title in headline, first
paragraph.)  Ikos Asset Management Chief Executive
Officer Elena Ambrosiadou will donate 180,000 euros ($241,200)
for copies of eight statues exhibited in the Louvre to be
returned to  Greece ,  Kathimerini  reported, without saying where
it got the information.  The copies of the original second century B.C. statues,
which were removed from Ambrosiadou’s birthplace Thessaloniki by
French paleographer Emanuel Miller in 1862, after he received
permission by the Ottoman authorities to do so, the newspaper
said. They will return to Greece’s second largest city in 2012
when it celebrates the hundredth anniversary of becoming part
Greece, the Athens-based newspaper reported.  The statues, called “Las Incantadas”, or the enchanted
ones, by the city’s Sephardic speaking Jewish community and
“Eidola”, the idols, by its Greek population, show the
mythical figures Maenas, Dionysos, Ariadne, Leda, Ganymede,
Dioscuros, Aura and Nice, Kathimerini reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
