Former Boston  Red Sox  manager Terry Francona was hired by ESPN as an analyst for in-studio shows as
well as “Sunday Night Baseball” game telecasts.  Francona made his debut for the  Walt Disney Co. (DIS) 
network yesterday, ESPN said in a statement.  Bobby Valentine, hired last week as Francona’s successor as
Red Sox manager, had worked as an ESPN baseball analyst since
late in 2009.  The 52-year-old Francona managed the Red Sox from 2004
through 2011, leading the team to World Series championships in
2004 and 2007 and a regular-season record of 744-552.  Last season, he oversaw the biggest September collapse in
the history of Major League Baseball as Boston went 7-20 for the
month to lose a nine-game lead in the race for the American
League wild-card spot. The Red Sox were eliminated on the final
day of the regular season.  Francona worked as a broadcaster for News Corp.’s Fox
Sports during the American League Championship Series.  He then interviewed for the managerial opening with the  St.
Louis Cardinals  last month before deciding not to return to the
game next season.  To contact the reporter on this story:
