Crude oil inventories declined 5.04

stockpiles  rose 5.97 million barrels to 215.4 million.  Inventories at Cushing,  Oklahoma , the delivery point for
futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange, dropped 1.22
million barrels to 31.1 million.  The Energy Department is scheduled to release its inventory
report tomorrow at 10:30 a.m. in  Washington .  The government report may show stockpiles of crude oil fell
1.25 million barrels last week, according to the median of 12
responses in a  Bloomberg News  survey. Gasoline inventories

government requires that reports be filed with the Energy
Department for its weekly survey.  Crude oil for January delivery rose 14 cents to $101.13 a
barrel at 4:31 p.m. in electronic trading on the  New York
