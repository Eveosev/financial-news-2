The United Arab Emirates’ banking
system will come under pressure as the global economic crisis
and Abu Dhabi’s slowdown undermine asset quality and restrict
liquidity,  Fitch Ratings  said.  Banks in the country will “face new headwinds” brought on
by the “fragile” real-estate industry and problems at Dubai
government-linked entities and U.A.E. companies, the ratings
company said in a  report  today.  “The U.A.E. operating environment is not immune from
global issues and this threatens the recovery in the banking
system,” the report said, “Fitch is particularly expecting
several key economic sectors such as trade, tourism and services
to be negatively impacted.”  Fitch said it expects banks’ earnings to decline because of
low business volumes and new central bank rules on retail
lending. The main challenge is the banks’ ability to raise long-
term funding, which has become “more costly, especially for
Dubai-based banks” as liquidity in global markets declines, it
said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
