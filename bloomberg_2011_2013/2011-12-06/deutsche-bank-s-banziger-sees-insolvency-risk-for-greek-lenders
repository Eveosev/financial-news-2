Deutsche Bank AG Chief Risk Officer
Hugo Banziger said Greek lenders are at risk of insolvency if
retail customers withdraw cash and inter-bank lending dries up.  “ Greece  is an accident waiting to happen,” Banziger said
today at the  RiskMinds  conference in Geneva. “People don’t
trust the banks anymore,” he said, “so they take out 500 euro
bills and hide it somewhere in their apartments or houses.”  Should customers keep withdrawing deposits, Greek lenders
will have fewer assets to secure loans from the central bank and
foreign institutions, according to Banziger. “Then they become
insolvent,” he said.  Outflows from Greek banks totaled as much as 14 billion
euros ($18.7 billion) in the two months to the end of October,
 George Provopoulos , head of the country’s central bank, said on
Nov. 29. He said the decline continued in early November and has
since stabilized. National Bank of Greece SA, the nation’s
biggest lender, and two smaller rivals posted nine-month losses
in November as they wrote down their holdings of government debt
and clients pulled deposits.  To contact the reporter on this story:
