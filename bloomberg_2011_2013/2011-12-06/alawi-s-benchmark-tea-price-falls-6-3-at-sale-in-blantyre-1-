The benchmark price of tea in  Malawi ,
 Africa ’s largest producer of the crop after Kenya, fell 6.3
percent at a sale today, according to Tea Brokers Central
Africa, which manages the country’s tea auctions.  The top grade of tea, known as pekoe fannings, fetched
$2.40 a kilogram (2.2 pounds) in the commercial capital,
Blantyre, down from $2.56 a week earlier, Tea Brokers said in an
e-mailed report today.  Sales of the leaf fetched $76,143 from 43,520 kilograms,
compared with $142,139 from 88,080 kilograms at the previous
sale on Nov. 29, Tea Brokers said.  Tea is Malawi’s second-largest foreign exchange earner,
after tobacco, generating 8 percent of total export earnings.
The U.K. is typically the largest buyer of tea from Malawi.  To contact the reporter on this story:
