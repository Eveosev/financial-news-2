European Central Bank Governing
Council member Ewald Nowotny said  Standard & Poor’s  was
“politically motivated” when it said it may downgrade 15 euro
area countries.  “The timing and the scope of this warning has a clearly
political context -- a rating agency has entered the political
arena,” Nowotny said at a conference in Vienna.  “I would consider it problematic if politics would set is
priorities based on what rating agencies ask it to do, politics
has to set its own priorities,” he said.  “The ECB doesn't let itself be put under pressure,” 
Nowotny said when asked if the ECB was affected by S&P's action.  To contact the reporters on this story:
