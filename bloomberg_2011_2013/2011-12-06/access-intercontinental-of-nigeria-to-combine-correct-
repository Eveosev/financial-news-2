Access Bank Plc (ACCESS)  of Nigeria said that
it will complete its integration with  Intercontinental Bank Plc (INTERCON) 
by March after buying a 75 percent stake in the business.  “We have been able to fast-track the process and now aim
to achieve single entity status by March” before a required
target of “18-24 months,” Lagos-based Access said in a
statement today to the  Nigerian Stock Exchange . The process
“will leave Access Bank as the surviving entity.”  Shareholders will meet on Dec. 30 to vote on the
combination, the bank said.  Intercontinental is one of eight lenders bailed out by the
central bank in 2009 after a debt crisis caused in part by loans
to equity speculators. Five of them, including Intercontinental,
were acquired by investors and three were nationalized.  Access Bank is quickening the takeover process to “ensure
that the momentum is sustained and that value is preserved,”
according to the statement.  The lender’s shares fell to the lowest since Aug. 21, 2009,
losing 21 kobo, or 4.5 percent, to close at 4.50 naira in Lagos.
The stock has lost 53 percent this year, compared with a 21
percent decline in the Nigerian Stock Exchange  All-Share Index. (NGSEINDX)   To contact the reporter on this story:
