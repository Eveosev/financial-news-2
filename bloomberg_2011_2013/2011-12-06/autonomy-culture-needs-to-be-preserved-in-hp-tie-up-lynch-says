Autonomy Corp . chief Mike Lynch said
the U.K. software maker needs to preserve a “high-speed
culture” following its $10.3 billion acquisition by Hewlett-
Packard Co.  “Autonomy has a very different culture, a very high-speed
culture,” Lynch said at the Bloomberg Enterprise Technology
Summit in  London  today. It’s a company “that needs to be left
to do that.”  Hewlett-Packard Chief Executive Officer Meg Whitman, who
supported the Autonomy purchase, has compared the parent company
to a “mother tiger” not rolling on its cub, Lynch said. She
told her executives “not to smother” Autonomy, Lynch said in
an interview at the same conference.  The purchase of the U.K.’s second-largest software company
this year added to pressure on Hewlett-Packard’s then-CEO  Leo Apotheker  who had announced an overhaul on Aug. 18 that included
the Autonomy deal and a possible spinoff of the personal-
computer business. A month later, Apotheker was removed by
Hewlett-Packard’s board and the company named former  EBay Inc. (EBAY) 
CEO Whitman to succeed him.  Whitman has opted to fix Hewlett-Packard’s existing
businesses, while limiting the size of further acquisitions.
Lynch, who founded Autonomy in 1996, reports directly to
Whitman.  Asked about Autonomy’s future within Hewlett-Packard and
the prospect of selling other services, Lynch said that the
company now has access to the “toy store” of HP’s hardware.  To contact the reporter on this story:
