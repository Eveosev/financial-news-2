Bombardier Inc. (BBD/B)  still expects to
deliver its brand-new CSeries narrow-body aircraft on time in
2013, even after using much of the spare time built into its
schedule.  “Do we still believe we can make it? Yes,”  Guy Hachey ,
the head of the Montreal-based planemaker’s aerospace division,
reaffirmed today during a presentation for investors and
analysts in  New York .  The CSeries has a total of 300 firm orders, options and
letters of intent, and the engine and facilities are “right on
track,” he said. Some suppliers are behind and others are on
time, he said.  The jet will compete against the smallest variants of
single-aisle 737s from Boeing Co. and A320s from Airbus SAS.  Bombardier sees an opportunity in the bankruptcy
restructuring of American Airlines parent AMR Corp., which
already flies the planemaker’s CRJ aircraft, Hachey said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
