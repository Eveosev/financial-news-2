House Republican leaders are
“definitely working” on putting together a package of tax-cut
extensions that includes a payroll provision, according to U.S.
House Majority Leader  Eric Cantor .  Cantor, a Virginia Republican, said in an interview today
that details of the package were still “under discussion” and
that Republican leaders would present options to their caucus
before the end of the week.  Republican leaders should be able to persuade their members
to support the measure they craft, which will include spending
cuts, Cantor said.  Laena Fallon, Cantor’s spokeswoman, said today that the
House wouldn’t vote before next week on a payroll tax-cut
extension.  To contact the reporter on this story:
