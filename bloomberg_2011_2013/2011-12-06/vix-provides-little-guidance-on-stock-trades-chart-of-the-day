The most widely followed “fear
gauge” for stocks sends relatively weak signals most of the
time about whether to buy or sell, according to Tobias Levkovich, Citigroup Inc.’s chief U.S. equity strategist.  The CHART OF THE DAY compares the performance of the
Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, known as the
VIX, and the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index since stocks started
their most recent  bull market  in March 2009.  During the past four months, the VIX fell to 27.84 from a
second-half peak of 48.00. The readings are based on the prices
paid for S&P 500 options.  “At current levels, the VIX provides little guidance for
investing purposes,” Levkovich wrote in a Dec. 2 report. He
added that the index “is not that effective as a market-timing
tool unless it is at extremes.”  When the VIX was less than 30, the S&P 500 had an average
gain of 2.9 percent in the next six months, according to the
report. At less than 20, the average climbed to 3.8 percent.
Levkovich found a bigger gap at 12 months, when increases
averaged 6.9 percent when the index was less than 30 and 10.3
percent at less than 20.  Relatively high readings usually preceded larger gains in
stocks, according to the report. When the volatility index was
above 40, the  S&P 500  rose 14 percent for the next six months
and 29 percent for the next 12 months on average.  To contact the reporter on this story:
