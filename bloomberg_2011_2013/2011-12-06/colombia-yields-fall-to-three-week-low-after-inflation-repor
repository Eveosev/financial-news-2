Colombia’s peso bonds fell, pushing
yields to rise the most in two weeks, after  Standard & Poor’s 
warning that it may downgrade 15 euro nations led to reduced
appetite for higher-yielding, emerging-market assets.  The yield on the nation’s 10 percent bonds due in July 2024
rose six basis points, or 0.06 percentage point, to 7.6 percent,
according to the stock exchange. That’s the biggest increase
since Nov. 23. The bond’s price fell 0.544 centavo to 118.973
centavos per peso.  Germany, France and four other nations may lose their AAA
credit ratings depending on the result of a summit of European
Union leaders on Dec. 9, S&P said yesterday. S&P said today the
European Financial Stability Facility may also lose its top
rating. European leaders are due to gather in Brussels amid an
ongoing effort to resolve the euro region’s debt crisis.  “The market is awaiting results of this week’s summit,”
said Omar Escorcia, an analyst at Asesores en Valores SA
brokerage in Bogota. “The S&P warning adds to the uncertainty,
and it translates into less demand for emerging market assets.”  Colombia ’s benchmark bonds due 2024 earlier gained after a
report showed consumer prices rose less than estimated last
month.  Consumer prices rose 0.14 percent in November, led by an
increase in communications, transport and health costs, the
national statistics agency said in a  report  late yesterday.
Economists expected monthly inflation of 0.19 percent, according
to the median of 30 forecasts compiled by Bloomberg. Prices for
food, which has a 28 percent weight on the  consumer price index ,
fell 0.05 percent, according to the report.  Reduced Volumes  Low trading volume this month, as is usual ahead of the
year-end holidays, will likely keep the bonds due 2024 trading
between 7.50 percent and 7.85 percent for the remainder of 2011,
said Carlos Ramos an analyst at Interbolsa SA, Colombia’s
biggest brokerage.  Annual inflation was 3.96 percent in November, down from
4.02 percent in October, which was the first time in two years
that inflation surpassed the central bank’s 2 percent to 4
percent target.  The peso rose 0.1 percent to 1,933.40 per  U.S. dollar , from
1,935.55 yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
