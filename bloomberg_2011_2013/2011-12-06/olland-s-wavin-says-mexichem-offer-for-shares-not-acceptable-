Wavin NV (WAVIN) ,  Europe ’s biggest maker of
plastic pipes for sewers, said Mexichem SAB’s increased offer of
457 million euros ($612.2 million) was “unacceptable.”  The 9 euro-a-share offer “materially undervalues the
company and its prospects,” Zwolle, Holland-based Wavin said
today in a statement distributed by Thomson Reuters One.  Mexichem raised its offer today to gain “friendly”
support to buy Wavin NV as it seeks to expand its plastic pipes
business in Europe.  “Certain progress has been made on non-financial items,”
the company said in the statement. “Future discussions are
conditional on an offer price acceptable to the management
board.”  Mexichem, based in Tlalnepantla, Mexico, has bought more
than 15 companies since 2007. The shares rose 1.4 percent to
46.73 pesos at 2:26 p.m. in  Mexico  City.  To contact the reporter on this story:
