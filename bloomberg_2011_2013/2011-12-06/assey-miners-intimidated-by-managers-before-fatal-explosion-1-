Massey Energy Co. intimidated
workers, concealed hazards and failed to perform required
examinations before the deadly 2010 blast at its West Virginia
coal mine, according to a U.S. Labor Department investigation.  The  Mine Safety and Health Administration  concluded that
Massey’s corporate culture was a root cause of the tragedy that
killed 29 workers at the Upper Big Branch mine, the agency said
in a report posted today on its website.  Alpha Natural Resources
Inc. (ANR)  acquired Massey in June.  “Massey promoted and enforced a workplace culture that
valued production over safety, and broke the law as they
endangered the lives of their miners,” Labor Secretary Hilda Solis said in an e-mailed statement.  Alpha said today will pay $209 million and settle a
criminal investigation and civil proceedings related to the
April 2010 explosion, the deadliest U.S. mining disaster in 40
years. Alpha will pay $46.5 million to families of the miners
and $34.8 million will resolve outstanding regulatory actions,
the company said.  MSHA, in its report, concluded that the 29 miners died in a
massive coal-dust explosion that started as a methane ignition.  To contact the reporter on this story:
