Senate Majority Leader  Harry Reid 
took a step today toward a procedural vote on the nomination of
Richard Cordray to head the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection
Bureau.  The move, setting up a vote to limit debate on the
nomination, could lead to a procedural or “cloture” vote on
Thursday, according to Reid’s website. To pass, the motion would
need 60 votes from the 100 senators.  President Barack Obama in July nominated Cordray, the
former attorney general of Ohio, to be the first director of the
consumer bureau, which was created by the 2010 Dodd-Frank Law
that restructured U.S. financial regulation.  In May, 44 Republican Senators signed a letter saying they
would oppose any nominee to run the agency without significant
changes to the bureau’s structure. A block of 41 senators can
usually prevent the chamber from proceeding with a vote on the
nominee.  The only two Republican senators who did not sign the
letter were  Scott Brown  of Massachusetts and  Lisa Murkowski  of
Alaska. Brown has since said he would support Cordray.  To contact the reporter on this story:
