(Corrects currency conversion in first paragraph.)  Ezz Steel (ESRS) ,  Egypt â€™s biggest publicly
traded producer of the metal, has kept its price at 4,500
Egyptian pounds ($750) per ton of steel rebar this month,  Al
Alam Al Youm  reported, citing distributors.  Last month, the company reduced its price by 6.3 percent
because of a decline in demand, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
