budget law adopted today by the oil-producing former Soviet
republic’s parliament.  Budget revenue is expected to rise 5.7 percent to 16.4
billion manats ($20.9 billion) from this year’s 15.6 billion
manats, Akif Tavakkuloglu, a spokesman for the parliament, said
by phone today from Baku, the capital. Spending is forecast to
rise 7.1 percent to 17.1 billion manats from 15.9 billion manats
in 2011, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
