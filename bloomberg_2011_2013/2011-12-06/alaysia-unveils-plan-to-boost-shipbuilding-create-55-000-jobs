Malaysia  plans to boost its
shipbuilding and repair industry through regulatory intervention
and incentive packages for investment and human capital
development, Prime Minister Najib Razak said.  The government has developed a plan in conjunction with the
Association of Marine Industries of Malaysia which aims to
generate 6.4 billion ringgit ($2 billion) of gross national
income and 55,000 jobs by 2020, Najib said in a statement today.
Key contributions will come from an expected uptrend in building
and repairing oil and gas support vessels for energy exploration
and replacing state-owned Petroliam Nasional Bhd.â€™s ageing
vessels, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
