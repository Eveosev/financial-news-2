Multiplus SA , the frequent-flyer unit
of Brazilian airline  Tam SA (TAMM4) , headed to a six-month high after
its board approved changing the prices it pays the parent
company for tickets and the amount it charges Tam for air miles.  Multiplus advanced 4.3 percent to 32.02 reais at 4:31 p.m.
in Sao Paulo, the highest on a closing basis since June 3. The
benchmark Bovespa index gained 0.2 percent.  The board approved a revision in its contract with Tam,
according to a regulatory filing yesterday. It provides for a 10
percent cut in prices for tickets it buys from  Tam  and a 20
percent drop in prices it charges the parent company for
frequent-flyer points, Banco BTG Pactual SA wrote in a note.  “The revision’s impact is encouraging,” analyst Rodrigo
Goes wrote. The change should reduce nominal income in business
with Tam, while increasing “considerably” profitability from
financial institutions and other partners, provided Multiplus is
able to maintain stable air miles prices for them.  Revenue could fall 2.5 percent while earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and earnings per
share could rise 20 percent and 25 percent, respectively, Goes
wrote.  Tam’s board of directors hasn’t yet approved the proposed
contract changes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
