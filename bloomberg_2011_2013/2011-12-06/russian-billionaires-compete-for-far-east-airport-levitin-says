Russian billionaire  Oleg Deripaska ’s
Basel Aero, Viktor Vekselberg’s Renova Group and businessman
Roman Trotsenko’s OOO Novaport may compete to acquire an airport
in Vladivostok, a port city on the Pacific coast.  The terminal, which state-controlled Sheremetyevo
International Airport and state development bank VEB are
building at a cost of 5.9 billion rubles ($190 million), will
have a capacity to handle 3 million passengers a year,
Transportation Minister  Igor Levitin  told reporters today in
Moscow.  The airport will be sold after the Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation summit in the region next year, said Levitin, who is
also Sheremetyevo’s board chairman.  Renova, Basel Aero and Novaport are seeking to expand their
airport holdings as Russian air travel reaches a post-Soviet
record of 60 million passengers next year, according to Levitin.  Renova agreed to acquire 71 percent of a company that
controls the Kurumoch International Airport in the southern city
of Samara, winning a tender after agreeing to invest 12.3
billion rubles to upgrade the facility, billionaire Vekselberg’s
holding company said yesterday in an e-mailed statement. After
completing the investment program, Renova will have the option
to acquire 25 percent more.  In February, Renova agreed to acquire control of an airport
in  Nizhny Novgorod  and renovate the facility as the country
prepares regional cities for the 2018 soccer  World Cup .  To contact the reporter on this story:
