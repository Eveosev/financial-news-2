Greece â€™s November budget revenue was
13.3 percent down on a year earlier,  Kathimerini  reported,
without saying how it got the information.  Cumulative revenue in the first 11 months of the year
decreased 5 percent to 43 billion euros ($57 billion) from the
year-earlier period, the newspaper said. This might result in
Greece needing more than 2 billion euros of additional deficit-
cutting measures in 2012, Kathimerini said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
