Austerity measures backed by the
European Union nations trying to resolve a debt crisis are
“suicide,”  Joseph Stiglitz , a Nobel Prize-winning economist,
said.  Europe  should “take lessons” from the debt restructuring
experience of  Argentina , which defaulted on $95 billion of bonds
in 2001, Stiglitz said at a seminar in  Buenos Aires  today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
