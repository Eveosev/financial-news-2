Kinross Gold Corp. (K) , the third-largest
Canada-based miner by market value, said it reached a non-
binding agreement with Ecuador’s government to develop its Fruta
del Norte gold and silver mine in the South American nation.  Kinross said Ecuador agreed “in principle” to a sliding
scale of gold royalty fees between 5 percent and 8 percent
depending on sale prices, as well as a payment of $65 million
toward future royalties, the company said today in a statement
published by Marketwire. Kinross didn’t say when a final accord
may be reached.  Kinross is the first international mining company to
announce a contract accord with Ecuador’s government since a new
mining law was passed in 2009 establishing greater state control
over the country’s mineral resources. Kinross Chief Executive
Officer Tye Burt said in July the  Ecuador  mine is an “important
part” of the company’s growth profile.  “This agreement represents an important milestone in the
development of FDN,” Burt said today in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
