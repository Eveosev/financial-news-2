The U.S. Senate Agriculture Committee
voted to subpoena Jon S. Corzine, former chairman and chief
executive officer of  MF Global Holdings Ltd. , for a Dec. 13
hearing on the collapse of the New York-based brokerage.  Lawmakers on the panel today voted unanimously to issue the
subpoena. Corzine is already scheduled to appear in  Washington 
at a Dec. 8 hearing of the House Agriculture Committee, which
subpoenaed him last week.  MF Global filed for bankruptcy protection on Oct. 31. The
U.S.  Commodity Futures Trading Commission , Securities and
Exchange Commission and Justice Department are investigating as
much as $1.2 billion in missing customer funds.  “We believe that it’s necessary to compel Mr. Corzine to
testify,” Senator  Debbie Stabenow , the Michigan Democrat who
leads the panel, said today. “We’ve been in touch with Mr.
Corzine’s attorney. We have given him a deadline to get back to
us. We have extended that deadline, but we cannot keep
waiting.”  Corzine, a Democrat who served in the Senate and as  New
Jersey ’s governor, joined MF Global in March 2010 with a plan to
remake the company into an investment bank in the image of
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., where he had been co-chairman before
entering politics. Corzine resigned from MF Global on Nov. 4.  Steven Goldberg, a New York-based spokesman for Corzine,
declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
