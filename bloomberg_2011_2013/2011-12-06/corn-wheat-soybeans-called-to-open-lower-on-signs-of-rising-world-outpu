What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets.  -- Wheat futures may open 8 cents to 10 cents a bushel lower on
the  Chicago  Board of Trade, the Kansas City Board of Trade and
the  Minneapolis Grain Exchange  on speculation that demand for
U.S. exports will slow as Australian farmers harvest a record
crop and Canada reported an output gain of 9 percent, Chad Henderson, a market analyst for Prime Agricultural Consultants
Inc. in Brookfield,  Wisconsin , said in a telephone interview.  -- Corn futures are called to open 8 cents to 10 cents a bushel
lower on the CBOT on speculation that rising world wheat
production will reduce overseas demand for U.S. grain, Henderson
said.  -- Soybean futures may open 4 cents to 7 cents a bushel lower in
Chicago on speculation that rising oilseed production in  Canada 
and  India  and beneficial rains in  South America â€™s biggest
growing regions will curtail demand for U.S. supplies, Henderson
said. Soybean-oil futures are expected to open 0.25 cent to 0.35
cent a pound lower, and soybean-meal futures may open $1.50 to
$2.50 lower per 2,000 pounds.  To contact the reporters on this story:
