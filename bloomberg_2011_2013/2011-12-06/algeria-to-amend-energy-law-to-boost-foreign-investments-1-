Algeria  plans to amend its energy
law, including clauses on tax measures and contractual
arrangements between state energy company Sonatrach and its
partners, the official Algerie Presse Service reported.  The amendment is aimed at boosting foreign investments,
particularly in exploration, to increase the North African
country’s oil and gas reserves, the Algiers-based  news agency 
cited Energy Minister Youcef Yousfi as saying.  “We have to adapt to the international situation,” he
said in Doha, Qatar, according to APS. “We have oil reserves
that are largely comfortable, but you must provide local
security of supply in the very long term and strengthen the role
of Algeria as a key player in international trade energy,”  Since Algeria’s hydrocarbons law was amended in 2006, the
North African country has conducted three international bidding
rounds for oil and gas exploration, granting four blocks in
2008, three in 2009 and two in 2011, APS said.  Algeria, a member of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries, pumped 1.27 million barrels of oil a day in
November, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Algeria’s
proven oil reserves were 12.2 billion barrels at the end of
2010, making it holder of  Africa ’s fourth-largest crude
reserves, according to BP Plc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
