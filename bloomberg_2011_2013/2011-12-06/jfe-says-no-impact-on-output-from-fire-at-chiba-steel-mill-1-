JFE Holdings Inc. (5411) ,  Japan ’s second-
largest steelmaker, said there was no impact on operations from
a fire today at its Chiba mill.  There were no injuries from the fire, which was
extinguished at 12:24 p.m. Tokyo time, Toru Iwamoto, a spokesman
for the company’s JFE Steel unit, said by phone.  The fire occurred in a three-story storage facility on the
mill grounds, damaging an area of 1,000 square meters, said
Hidetoshi Miho, a spokesman for the Chiba City fire department.
The cause is still being investigated, he said.  This is the second fire at the Chiba facilities within four
days. Four workers were injured by an explosion at JFE Chemical
Co.’s sulfuric acid tank on Dec. 2.  JFE fell 4.1 percent to 1,464 yen at 1:50 p.m. in  Tokyo ,
the most in two weeks.  To contact the reporters on this story:
