Portuguese Economy Minister Alvaro Santos Pereira said indebted euro-area governments need
liquidity from the  European Central Bank  more than jointly
issued European bonds,  Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung  reported.  “More than euro bonds, EU states need liquidity,” Santos
Pereira said in an interview with FAZ. “ Germany  isn’t feeling
this yet, but most countries are having liquidity problems. For
that reason, the European Central Bank must take on a more
active role.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
