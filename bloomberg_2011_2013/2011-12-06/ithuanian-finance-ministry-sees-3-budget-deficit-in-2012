Lithuania’s budget deficit may total
3 percent of gross domestic product next year, the  Finance
Ministry  said today by e-mail.  That’s higher than an initial plan to cut the shortfall to
2.8 percent of GDP next year. The ministry lowered its 2012
economic-growth forecast to 2.5 percent from 4.7 percent last
week.  Lithuania is seeking to narrow its budget deficit from an
estimated 5.3 percent of GDP this year. The government has
pledged to reduce spending by 4 percent to help close the gap.  To contact the reporter on this story:
