David Knowlton, who sold his Watch
Hill Partners LLC to FBR Capital Markets in 2009, started an
advisory firm that he said will focus on a single client per
industry.  Three Ocean Partners, based in New York and involved with
mergers and acquisitions as well as recapitalizations and
restructurings, plans to open offices in  Los Angeles  and  London 
and partner with bankers in Brazil and  India  early next year,
the firm said today in a statement. Knowlton and his partners
plan to advise clients over the course of multiple years instead
of for specific investments.  “The investment banking landscape is in the midst of a
dramatic change and the premium today, as much as ever, is on
long-standing relationships,” Knowlton said in the statement.  Knowlton started Watch Hill Partners in 2003 and sold it to
FBR six years later. The firm advised clients on about $30
billion of deals, according to a profile of Knowlton on Three
Ocean’s  website . Knowlton, who previously worked at First Union
Corp. and Gleacher Natwest Inc., advised Hershey Trust Co. on
Hershey Co.’s failed attempt to buy Cadbury Plc for about $19
billion.  Three Ocean has already advised MidOcean Partners on its
acquisition of Pre-Paid Legal Services Inc. for $650 million,
which was completed in June, the firm said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
