Cadbury Nigeria Plc (CADBURY) , a manufacturer
of drinks and food products, forecast a 60 percent increase in
net income to 339.2 million naira ($2 million) for the first
quarter.  Pretax profit is seen at 470.5 million naira for the period
while revenue is estimated at 8.73 billion naira, the Lagos-
based company said in a statement published on the website of
the  Nigerian Stock Exchange  today.  Cadbury Nigeria returned to profit in 2010, after a loss in
the preceding year. Growth expectations are based on its
addition of another plant and improved sales, the company said.  The companyâ€™s shares were unchanged at 11.05 naira by the
2:30 p.m. close in Lagos. The stock has lost 57 percent of its
value this year, compared with a 21 percent decline in the
Nigerian Stock Exchange  All-Share Index. (NGSEINDX)   To contact the reporter on this story:
