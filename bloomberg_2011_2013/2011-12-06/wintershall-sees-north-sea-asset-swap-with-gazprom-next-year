BASF SE (BAS) ’s Wintershall AG unit will
complete talks on swapping some of its assets in the North Sea
for two Siberian deposits belonging to OAO Gazprom next year.  “The assets to be swapped with Gazprom will basically have
the same value,” Anna Bungarten, a spokeswoman at the Kassel,
Germany-based company, said in an e-mailed response to
questions. “The negotiations for a legally binding agreement
are still going on and will be finalized next year.”  Gazprom, Russia’s gas-export monopoly, expects to get 50
percent of oil and gas fields in the southern part of the North
Sea as part of the swap. Wintershall will get 25 percent plus
one share in blocks 4 and 5 of the Achimov formation in the
Urengoy field, with an option to raise its stake to 50 percent.  Wintershall has 25 platforms for natural gas in the
southern  North Sea  belonging to the Netherlands, and one each in
the U.K. and Germany. The company is expanding its presence in
the U.K., where it owns 20 licenses, and in  Denmark , Germany,
and  Norway . Details on which projects Gazprom will join haven’t
been disclosed.  Wintershall may double gas production at the Achimov
formation after the asset swap with Gazprom, company spokesman
Nicholas Neu said in August.  To contact the reporter on this story:
