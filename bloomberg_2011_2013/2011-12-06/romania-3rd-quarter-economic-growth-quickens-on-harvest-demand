Romania ’s economic growth quickened
in the third quarter to the fastest in three years, helped by a
bumper harvest, growing industry and a recovery in domestic
consumption, final figures show.  Gross domestic product  rose a seasonally unadjusted 4.4
percent from a year earlier, matching the preliminary report and
compared with 1.4 percent in the second quarter, the  National
Statistics Institute  in Bucharest said today. Output grew a
seasonally adjusted 1.8 percent from the previous quarter,
slower than a previous estimate of 1.9 percent.  The eastern European country’s economy will probably grow
1.5 percent in 2011, aided by western European demand for the
country’s manufacturing products, including Dacia SA cars. It
suffered its worst recession on record in the previous two
years, according to government and International Monetary Fund
forecasts.  GDP may exceed estimates and grow more than 2 percent this
year, should the fourth-quarter output rise 2.5 percent,
President Traian Basescu said on Nov. 14.  Agriculture and industrial output, the main growth drivers,
rose 22.1 percent and 5.9 percent in the third quarter, while
final household consumption rose 3.6 percent for the first time
since 2008, according to the institute.  The export-driven  economic growth  will probably slow next
year to between 1.8 percent to 2.3 percent, compared with a
previous forecast of 3.5 percent as  Europe ’s debt crisis slows
growth in Romania’s major trading partners, Jeffrey Franks, the
International Monetary Fund’s Mission Chief to Romania, said on
Nov. 7.  To contact the reporter on this story:
