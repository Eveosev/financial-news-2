Syrian border security forces
repelled an armed group of 35 men who tried to enter the country
from  Turkey , the official Syrian Arab  News Agency   reported ,
without saying how it got the information.  The men, identified as members of a “terrorist group,”
clashed with Syrian forces in the province of Idlib and fled
back to Turkey as some of them were injured, according to SANA.
The border patrol suffered no losses, the news agency said.  The region is to the east of Turkey’s southernmost province
of Antakya, where thousands of Syrians who fled President Bashar al-Assad’s crackdown on protesters live in tent cities. Riad al-
As’ad, a former Syrian colonel who left his post to form the
Free Syrian Army with other defectors, is among those who sought
refuge in the province.  To contact the reporter on this story:
