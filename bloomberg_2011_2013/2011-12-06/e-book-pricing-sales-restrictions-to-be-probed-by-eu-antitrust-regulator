Apple Inc. (AAPL)  and units of  News Corp. (NWSA) ,
 CBS Corp. (CBS) ,  Pearson Plc (PSON)  and  Lagardere SCA (MMB)  face a European Union
investigation into e-book publishing agreements.  The European Commission said it opened a formal antitrust
investigation to examine “whether these publishing groups and
Apple have engaged in illegal agreements or practices that would
have the object or effect of restriction competition” in
 Europe .  The probe will examine deals between Apple and Lagardere’s
Hachette Livre, News Corp.’s Harper Collins, CBS’s Simon &
Schuster, Pearson’s Penguin and Verlagsgruppe Georg von
Holtzbrinck GmbH and agency agreements between the five
publishers and e-book retailers. Britain’s Office of Fair
Trading said in a statement on its website earlier today that it
would drop its probe into e-books to allow EU officials to take
the lead.  EU Competition Commissioner  Joaquin Almunia  said last month
that he wanted to fight “artificial restrictions imposed by
some companies to cross-border trade” which are “particularly
important in the digital area where I have already started to
look at the distribution practices of certain products such as e
-books.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
