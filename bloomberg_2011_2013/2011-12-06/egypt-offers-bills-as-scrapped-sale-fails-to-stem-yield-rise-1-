Egypt  plans to raise 10.5 billion
pounds ($1.75 billion) in local-currency treasury bills over the
next week after failing to curb record borrowing costs.  The Finance Ministry canceled the sale of  six-month  and
 one-year securities  on Dec. 1 because investors demanded yields
higher than 15 percent, two government officials with knowledge
of the decision said at the time. Still, average yields on
 three-  and  nine-month  securities climbed 9 basis points and 14
basis points, respectively to 14.348 percent and 15.084 percent
at a Dec. 4 auction.  Yields on domestic debt are rising after a popular revolt
ousted President  Hosni Mubarak  in February. The country is
relying on weekly sales to fund 90 percent of its 134 billion-
pound budget deficit in the fiscal year that started in July,
the  Finance Ministry  said in September. Egypt’s currency has
weakened 3.3 percent this year after foreign investment declined
because of the unrest.  Egypt’s central bank said today a report in Al Shorouk
newspaper that it may stop supporting the pound in the next few
months is “incorrect,” said Nidal Assr, head of foreign
reserve management at the central bank.  The currency gained less than 0.1 percent to 6.0015 a
dollar at 3:31 p.m. in Cairo. Twelve-month non-deliverable
forwards for the currency, which provide guidance to
expectations, declined 0.4 percent to 7 a dollar.  The yield on Egypt’s 5.75 percent 10-year dollar bond due
April 2020 was little changed, advancing less than one basis
point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 6.95 percent.  The Arab country will seek bids for 3.5 billion pounds in
one-year securities and 2 billion pounds in six-month notes on
Dec. 8, according to central bank data on Bloomberg. It also
plans to raise 3.5 billion pounds in nine-month treasury bills
and 1.5 billion pounds in three-month debt three days later, the
data show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
