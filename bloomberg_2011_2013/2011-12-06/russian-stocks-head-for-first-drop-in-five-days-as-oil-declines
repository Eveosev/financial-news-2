Russian stocks sank the most in two
weeks after  Standard & Poor’s  said it may cut the credit ratings
of 15 euro countries and as Interior Ministry troops patrolled
Moscow after election protests.  The Micex Index tumbled 4 percent to 1,457.90 by the close
of trading in Moscow.  OAO Gazprom ,  Russia ’s gas-export monopoly
slid 4.7 percent and  VTB Group , the nation’s second-biggest
lender, dropped 5.7 percent. The dollar-denominated  RTS Index 
retreated 4.7 percent to 1,485.67.  Emerging-market equities retreated today after S&P put 15
countries, including  Germany  and France, on watch for potential
rating downgrades, curbing appetite for riskier assets in
developing nations. Troops today moved across Russia’s capital
in “a planned rotation,” according to a ministry press
officer, after thousands of people protested election results
last night in one of the largest anti-government rallies in
recent years.  “Investors are concerned that this will snowball into a
concerted display of mass popular dissent,” Julian Rimmer, a
trader of Russian shares at CF Global Trading in  London , said in
an e-mail. “In a country with a history like Russia’s it’s only
sensible to pay attention to developments like this, but
perspective needs to be maintained.”  Russian Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin ’s United Russia party
suffered its first election setback in a Dec. 4 parliamentary
vote, winning 49.3 percent compared with 64.3 percent four years
ago. The ruble sank 1.2 percent to 31.24 against the dollar,
heading for its sharpest retreat in almost a month.  OAO
Sberbank , Russia’s biggest lender, fell 4 percent, its steepest
drop since Nov. 21.  Police Patrols  Police detained around 300 people after yesterday’s rally
and some 2,000 servicemen and 2,000 police officers have been on
duty every day as part of reinforced security measures since the
election, the duty officer at the Moscow police press service
said by phone.  Putin, who is seeking to switch jobs next year with
President  Dmitry Medvedev  by running for president, may have to
contend with a more fractured legislature than when he was
president between 2000 and 2008.  The Micex has lost 14 percent in 2011 and trades at 5.1
times estimated earnings. That compares with a 15 percent slide
for Brazil’s  Bovespa (IBOV)  index, which trades at 10.5 times estimated
earnings, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The  Shanghai
Composite Index (SHCOMP)  trades at 11.1 times estimated earnings, and the
 BSE India Sensitive Index (SENSEX)  has a ratio of 14.4.  ‘Buy Into Weakness’  The Micex’s decline today is an opportunity to “buy into
the weakness,” CF Global’s Rimmer said.  Germany, France, the Netherlands, Austria, Finland and
Luxembourg, the euro area’s six AAA rated countries, are among
the nations being placed on “CreditWatch negative,” pending
the result of a summit of European Union leaders on Dec. 9, S&P
said yesterday.  “Investors collectively remain skeptical about how fixable
the problems are in Europe,” said Lewis Kaufman, a  Santa Fe ,
New Mexico-based money manager at Thornburg Investment
Management, who oversees the Thornburg Developing World Fund.
“There is relatively good value in a lot of blue-chip Russian
stocks, but it’s very hard to quantify adverse developments in
 Europe  and what they could mean if things go awry.”  Crude Oil   Crude for January delivery on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  declined 32 cents to $100.67 a barrel as of 6:15 p.m.
Moscow time, erasing an earlier increase of as much as 0.3
percent. Prices are up 10 percent this year.  Brent oil for January settlement rose 8 cents to $109.89 on
the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange while Urals crude,
Russia’s chief export blend, retreated 0.5 percent to $109.59.
Oil and natural gas contribute about 17 percent of Russia’s
gross domestic product.  OAO Rosneft, Russia’s biggest oil company, declined 4.1
percent to 215.55 rubles, the biggest drop since Nov. 21.  OAO
Lukoil , the largest private oil producer, fell 3.3 percent to
1,671 rubles.  The ruble depreciated for a fourth day, weakening 1.1
percent to 31.2050 against the dollar. OAO Sberbank, Russia’s
biggest bank, retreated 4.3 percent, to 86.16 rubles. VTB
dropped 5.7 percent to 6.74 kopeks, the biggest decline in the
 Micex Index (INDEXCF)  today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
