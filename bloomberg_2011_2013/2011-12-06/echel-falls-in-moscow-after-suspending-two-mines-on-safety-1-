OAO  Mechel (MTLR) , Russiaâ€™s largest producer
of steel-making coal, fell the most in two weeks after it
suspended work at two mines following complaints by the
industrial safety watchdog.  Mechel fell 4.6 percent in Moscow today to 340 rubles a
share. The company said it halted several facilities at the
Lenin and New-Olzherassk mines, part of its  Southern Kuzbass
Coal Co. (UKUZ)  unit, on orders from the Siberian branch of the safety
watchdog.  Mechel resumed output at the New Olzherassk mine last month
after halting it in August 2010 because coal was spontaneously
getting hotter and risking catching fire, according to a Nov. 16
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
