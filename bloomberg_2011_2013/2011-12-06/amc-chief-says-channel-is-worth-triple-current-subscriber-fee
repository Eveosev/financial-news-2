AMC, the cable network home to “Mad
Men” and “The Walking Dead,” said it merits subscriber fees
from pay-TV systems that are more than triple its current rate.  AMC deserves 75 cents for each subscriber, Josh Sapan,
chief executive officer of parent  AMC Networks Inc. , said today
at an investor conference in  New York . The network receives 24
cents a subscriber, according to Advertising Age.  The TV network, which five years ago began adding original
programming to a line-up of classic films, deserves higher
monthly fees based on ratings, audience engagement and viewers’
perception of value, Sapan said at UBS AG’s global media and
communications conference.  “We’re a different animal than we were,” Sapan said.
“AMC is way underpriced for what it actually is today.”  The network, also home to “Breaking Bad,” has about 95
million U.S. subscribers, Sapan said. At the higher rate, AMC
would collect about $855 million a year compared with $273.6
million annually, based on the 24 cent estimate.  AMC Networks is constantly renegotiating terms with pay-TV
carriers, Georgia Juvelis, a spokeswoman for the New York-based
company, said in an interview. Contracts expire on a rolling
basis and Sapan’s comments weren’t directed at a specific
carrier, she said.  AMC Networks fell 0.4 percent to $35.01 at the close in New
York. The stock is little changed since it began trading in
June.  To contact the reporter on this story:
