Royal  KPN NV (KPN)  is among mobile-phone
operators in the Netherlands visited today by the  NMa
competition authority  as part of an investigation into possible
antitrust violations.  KPN, the largest Dutch phone company, said in a statement
that its headquarters were raided today by the NMa as part of a
probe into “concerted practice with regard to mobile
telecommunications offerings on the Dutch consumer market,” and
“division of independent sales channels.” It said five KPN
employees are being questioned and the company is cooperating
fully.  T-Mobile is also cooperating fully with the investigation,
spokesman Michael Vos said via phone, confirming a visit from
the NMa this morning. “We are confident in the result,” he
said, while declining to elaborate on the probe.  Vodafone (VOD)  Group
Plc confirmed in a  statement  that it had been visited by the
competition authority.  In October, the regulator lowered fines imposed on KPN,
 Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE) ’s T-Mobile unit and Vodafone in 2002 for
colluding on subsidies that they gave retailers on mobile-phone
handsets, resulting in more expensive handsets for consumers.  KPN shares fell as much as 1.7 percent and were down 0.8
percent at 9 euros as of 1:38 p.m. in Amsterdam trading.
 Deutsche Telekom  rose 0.1 percent to 9.19 euros in Frankfurt and
Vodafone was 0.6 percent higher at 174.1 pence in  London .  Paul Trienekens, an NMa spokesman, declined to comment on
the details of the investigation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
