The  London Metal Exchange  added so-
called proximity hosting and upgraded its electronic trading
system that may help increase trading and revenue.  Proximity hosting allows members and clients to locate
their trading systems close to the exchange’s data center to
speed up orders, said Glen Chalkley, deputy head of business
development at the LME. Trading on the exchange may increase
from the upgrade after volume rose more than 20 percent so far
this year, the LME said in a statement today.  “Speed is certainly key,” said Caroline Davis, a managing
director in London at Ffastfill Plc, a trading software
provider. Proximity hosting should be of interest to “black
box” or algorithmic traders as well as other people who want to
reduce the time between an order and execution, she said.  The upgraded LMEselect 7 platform was developed by the LME,
Xchanging Plc and Cinnober Financial Technology AB, the exchange
said.  The upgrade also allows the exchange to manage “iceberg
orders” that hide the major part of a very large trade to
minimize the effect on prices, the LME said.  The exchange, which accounts for 80 percent of global
trade in metals futures, handled $11.63 trillion in contracts
last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
