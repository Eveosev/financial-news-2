Slovakia supports a French-German
proposal for closer fiscal union in the euro area and won’t
insist at a European Union summit that private creditors share
sovereign-debt losses, Finance Minister Ivan Miklos said.  The so-called private-sector involvement in potential
losses is not necessarily needed as part of an agreement on new
euro-area rules to be discussed by EU leaders later this week,
Miklos told reporters today in Bratislava, Slovakia.  The key element is to agree on “clear, strict, automatic
and enforceable” fiscal rules that will prevent profligacy, he
said. “If fiscal union means such enforceable rules, than such
a fiscal union shouldn’t be a problem for us.”  EU leaders meet on Dec. 9 to discuss tightening the euro-
area’s economic co-operation, including sanctions for deficit
violators as the two-year-old debt crisis continues to engulf
the region.  Standard & Poor’s  warned yesterday it may downgrade
national credit ratings across the bloc.  Miklos said it’s crucial that the new fiscal rules allow a
review of member states’ budgets before they are submitted to
national parliaments for approval. He “believes” that the
summit will lead to an agreement which will calm markets and at
the same time won’t include issuing joint bonds nor unlimited
purchases of distressed countries’ debt by the  European Central
Bank .  To contact the reporter on this story:
