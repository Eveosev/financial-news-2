Commodity trade financing may drop by
about 25 percent or more, L’Hebdo reported, citing Jacques-
Olivier Thomann, president of the Geneva Trading and Shipping
Association and global head of structured finance at BNP Paribas
(Suisse) SA.  As much as $2 billion of financing is offered in Geneva
every day, the magazine said in an article on its website dated
Nov. 30. Commodity trade financing is easier to cut because
transactions last 30 to 90 days, the magazine said, citing
Pierre-Olivier Fragniere, head of the international corporate
and private banking division at Banque Cantonale de Geneve.  To contact the reporter on this story:
