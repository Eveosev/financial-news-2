Corn rose from a two-month low and
soybeans gained on speculation that prices that have fallen at
least 20 percent since Sept. 1 will spark demand from food, meat
and fuel producers.  Cash  cattle  prices have risen 24 percent in the past year,
reaching a record yesterday, according to government statistics.
Cash  hogs  are up 27 percent. U.S.  ethanol  producers are making
31.37 cents a gallon, Bloomberg data shows. Corn and soybean
futures have dropped in the past three months as rising world
production reduced U.S. exports.  “Prices have fallen so much since September that there is
a little bit of buying beginning to surface” from U.S. fuel and
meat producers,  Dave Marshall , a farm marketing adviser for Toay
Commodity Futures Group LLC in Nashville,  Illinois , said in a
telephone interview. “Prices probably have fallen enough until
we know more about the South American weather situation.”  Corn futures for March delivery rose 0.9 percent to close
at $5.965 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the Chicago Board of Trade,
snapping a three-day decline. Earlier, the price fell to $5.80,
the lowest since Oct. 4. The grain dropped 6 percent in November
as overseas buyers shifted to cheaper supplies from Ukraine and
Argentina.  Soybean futures for January delivery rose 0.3 percent to
$11.295 a bushel in Chicago. The price, which touched a 13-month
low of $11.0275 on Nov. 25, dropped 7.1 percent last month.  In  Argentina , drier weather the next 15 days will reduce
soil moisture in about a third of the corn and soybean growing
areas, the  Commodity Weather Group LLC  said today in a report
today. Rains the next week in  Brazil  may begin to ease dryness
that’s affecting about 40 percent of the crops, the private
forecaster said.  “The soybean market found some support from the
uncertainty about the dry weather in  South America ,” Marshall
of Toay Commodity Futures said.  Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, valued at $66.7 billion in
2010, followed by soybeans at $38.9 billion, USDA data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
