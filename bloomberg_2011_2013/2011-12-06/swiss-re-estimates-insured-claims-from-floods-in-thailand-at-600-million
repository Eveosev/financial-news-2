Swiss Re Ltd. , the world’s second-
biggest reinsurer, estimates insured claims from the flooding in
 Thailand  at $600 million.  “The impact of this flood on the Thai economy and the
companies that operate there is likely to be significant and
could last some time,” said Brian Gray, chief underwriting
officer at the Zurich-based reinsurer. “The floods have forced
the closure of several major industrial estates.”  Thai Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra said on Dec. 3 that
all areas of Bangkok will be free from flooding by the end of
the month after northern and central Thailand experienced their
highest rainfall in 50 years. The total insured market loss from
the flooding, which claimed at least 657 lives, could be as much
as $11 billion, Swiss Re said.  “The claim is higher than expected and is not yet
finished” because of the complex loss assessment, said  Fabrizio Croce , a Zurich-based analyst with Kepler Capital Markets. “We
have to expect more claims, some potentially also delayed in
2012.”  Swiss Re dropped as much as 1.6 percent in Zurich trading
and was down 0.7 percent at 49.36 Swiss francs as of 9:01 a.m.
That valued the firm at 18.3 billion francs ($19.7 billion)  To contact the reporter on this story:
