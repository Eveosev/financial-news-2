Bonds issued by  Europe ’s bailout fund
fell after  Standard & Poor’s  said the European Financial
Stability Facility may lose its top  credit rating .  The EFSF’s 2.75 percent bonds due July 2016 fell 0.29 cents
on the euro to 101.27, the first decline since Nov. 25 based on
closing prices, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader data at 2:20
p.m. in London. The fund’s 2.75 percent December 2016 notes
dropped 0.33 cents to 100.81, and its securities due 2021 fell.  EFSF’s AAA rated bonds are on “CreditWatch negative”
after S&P put 15 euro-region nations that guarantee the bailout
fund on review for downgrade, citing “systemic stresses.” Six
countries in the euro zone still carry the top ratings from S&P
including Germany,  France , Austria, Finland, Luxembourg and the
Netherlands.  “Based on EFSF’s current structure, were we to lower one
or more of the current AAA ratings on EFSF’s guarantor members,
all else being equal, we would lower the issuer and issue
ratings on EFSF to the lowest sovereign rating on members
currently rated AAA,” S&P said in a statement today.  The EFSF has raised 16 billion euros ($21 billion) from
four bonds this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The fund’s 3.375 percent notes due 2021 lost 0.20 cents to
97.71. Its 3.5 percent securities due 2022 rose 0.32 cents to
98.54.  To contact the reporters on this story:
