Korea Resources Corp. , a state-run
resource explorer, plans to boost stockpiles of rare metals
including chrome 382 percent by 2016 to ensure supplies of the
materials used to make high-technology goods and electronics.  Stockpiles of nine metals, also including antimony,
titanium, tungsten, niobium, selenium and gallium, will likely
rise to 78,400 metric tons, or 60 days of consumption, from
16,249 tons at the end of October, Kim Young Ho, leader of the
stockpile and trading team, said at a conference in  Seoul  today.  South Korea , which relies on imports for almost all its
 mineral resources , has been stepping up efforts to boost
stockpiles as competition for supplies increases amid rising
prices. The new target is higher than a previous plan for 76,000
tons of reserves that was announced by the government last year
as the company reviewed projections for demand, Kim said.  “There always remains a potential for supply disruptions
with respect to rare metals,” said Kim. “Our primary purpose
for stockpiling is to provide companies in need with necessary
metals at the event of emergency. Prices are likely to continue
rising in the long term.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
