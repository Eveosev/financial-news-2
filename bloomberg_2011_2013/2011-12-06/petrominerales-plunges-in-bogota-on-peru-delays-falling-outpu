Petrominerales  Ltd. , a Calgary-based
company that explores for and produces oil in  Colombia , plunged
the most on record after it announced a drop in November output,
delays in Peru drilling operations and suspension of drilling at
two Colombian wells.  The shares fell 16 percent to 32,800 pesos in Bogota, the
lowest level since they began trading in August.  “The drilling results announced in the company’s
exploration update were not positive,” Maria Adelaida Velasquez, an oil sector analyst at  Interbolsa SA , Colombia’s
biggest brokerage, said in a phone interview from Medellin.  November production fell 5 percent from October,
Petrominerales said in a regulatory filing today. The company
suspended the Socaco-1 well and is considering using the Caspio-
1 well for water disposal after concluding continued drilling
“would not be economic,” the filing said.  Peru  drilling also was delayed due to low river levels and
adverse weather, the filing said.  Link to Company News: PMGC CB <Equity> CN   To contact the reporter on this story:
