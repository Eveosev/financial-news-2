Toll Brothers Inc. (TOL) , the largest U.S.
luxury-home builder, reported earnings that beat analysts’
estimates as prices rose and sales improved at its East Coast
communities.  Net income was $15 million, or 9 cents a share, for the
fourth quarter ended Oct. 31, compared with $50.5 million, or 30
cents, a year earlier, the Horsham, Pennsylvania-based company
said in a statement. Analysts expected earnings of 6 cents a
share, the average of 18 estimates in a Bloomberg survey.  “We produced our second consecutive quarter of pretax
profitability and our sixth consecutive quarter of pretax, pre-
impairment profitability,” Chief Executive Officer Douglas Yearley Jr. said in the statement. “Although U.S. housing
starts remain down 60 percent from historical norms, we produced
solid improvement in most key metrics.”  Toll Brothers’ fourth-quarter results were boosted by
demand for homes in the Boston-to-Washington corridor. While
builders have struggled to compete as  foreclosed properties  sell
at a discount and  consumer confidence  remains low, the company
is the top performer in the Standard & Poor’s 1500 Homebuilding
 Index (S15HOME)  this year.  Fourth-quarter revenue rose 6 percent from a year earlier
to $427.8 million. Home deliveries climbed 8 percent to 757
units.  New homes  in the U.S. sold at an annual pace of 307,000 in
October, the Commerce Department reported Nov. 28, keeping 2011
on pace to be the slowest sales year in records dating to 1963.  ‘Margin Improvement’  “Significant margin improvement will only be achieved once
we see the return of some urgency to the market, which should
lead to increased sales prices and paces,” Chief Financial
Officer Martin P. Connor said in the statement.  Because Toll Brothers has less than 1 percent of the U.S.
market share, a sales increase of a few hundred homes or a few
thousand dollars per unit “can have a more pronounced impact on
earnings per share,” Jack Micenko, an analyst with Susquehanna
International Group LLP in  New York , said in a telephone
interview before results were announced. He has a “positive”
rating on Toll and expected earnings of 3 cents a share.  The homebuilder has spent about $235 million on land and
related costs so far in the fiscal 2012 first quarter, compared
with $35.6 million in the entire fourth quarter. Construction of
developments will increase by 9 percent to 19 percent in the
current financial year, the company said in the statement.  CamWest Purchase  Toll’s sales may be boosted by as many as 200 units next
year because of its plans to open more New York City projects
and its purchase last month of CamWest Development LLC, a
closely held builder in  Seattle , Micenko said.  Newly signed contracts in the fourth quarter totaled $389.9
million for 644 units, up 24 percent in value and 15 percent in
units.  The average price for homes ordered was $606,000, up from
$565,000 a year earlier. Sales in the New York area accounted
for half of the increase in the average contract price for the
quarter, Yearley said Nov. 8.  Toll forecast deliveries of 2,400 to 3,200 homes this
fiscal year at an average price of $550,000 to $575,000 per
home. In fiscal 2011, the builder delivered 2,611 homes.  The company forecast having between 235 to 255 selling
communities at the end of its fiscal year, compared with 325 at
its peak in 2007. It ended fiscal 2011 with 215 communities.  The fourth-quarter results included inventory and joint
venture writedowns of $18 million.  Earnings were released before the start of regular U.S.
trading. Toll yesterday rose 51 cents to $20.74. Its shares are
up 9.2 percent this year, compared with a 5.5 percent decline in
the 12-member S&P homebuilding index.  To contact the reporters on this story:
