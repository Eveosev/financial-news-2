Integra Group, a Russian oilfield
services provider, received shareholder approval to merge a
seismic unit co-owned with  Schlumberger Ltd. (SLB)  and a company part-
owned by billionaire Gennady Timchenko after minority owners
sought to block the deal.  The merger between IGSS, in which Moscow-based Integra
holds 75 percent to Schlumberger’s 25 percent, with Geotech Oil
Services Holding Ltd.’s seismic business passed with 80.5
percent of the vote at an extraordinary general meeting
yesterday, Integra said today in a regulatory filing.  Integra, Schlumberger, Geotech and IGSS agreed on Nov. 9 to
combine operations to create what would become “one of the
largest land seismic companies globally,” according to a
statement at the time. Timchenko’s Volga Resources fund holds 25
percent of Geotech Oil Services.  Following the transaction, Geotech will control the
enlarged IGSS with a 52 percent stake and Integra’s ownership
would shrink to 36 percent. Schlumberger will hold 12 percent.  Prosperity Capital Management, on behalf of minority
shareholders in Integra, planned to vote against the deal
because of concerns about Geotech’s debt and a lack of audited
financial reports, according to a letter to Integra Chairman
John Fitzgibbons.  Prosperity, the largest Russia-focused equity investor with
about $5 billion of assets, said it manages investments on
behalf of funds that collectively own global depositary receipts
representing no more than 20 percent of Integra.  To contact the reporter on this story:
