Egypt ’s central bank may stop
supporting the Egyptian pound in the “next few months” because
of the drop in foreign currency reserves,  Al Shorouk  reported,
citing a bank official it didn’t identify.  The central bank has “done its part so far” and the
government must prepare an economic plan to encourage overseas
investment to counter the negative effects of a devaluation, the
Cairo-based newspaper cited the official as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
