Israel ’s inflation expectations rose
to the highest level in more than three months after lawmakers
raised corporate taxes, fueling investor concern consumer prices
may increase.  The two-year breakeven rate, which reflects market
expectations for inflation over the period, rose three basis
points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 219 at the 4:30 p.m. close
in Tel Aviv, the highest since Aug. 30. That implies an average
annual inflation rate of 2.19 percent. Inflation-linked bonds
due June 2013 rose, pushing yields down two basis points to
0.568 percent.  Israel’s parliament, or Knesset, yesterday boosted
corporate tax rates for companies and high earners as part of
measures aimed at reducing the cost of living for the poor and
middle class. The tax for companies was raised to 25 percent
from 24 percent, while families will receive a tax credit of 418
shekels ($112) a month for each child. The new measures take
effect on Jan. 1.  “Raising taxes on companies may hurt their earnings and as
a result they may need to raise prices,” Amir Kahanovich, chief
economist Clal Finance Brokerage Ltd. in  Tel Aviv , said by
telephone. “The tax changes may also deter foreign companies
from investing in Israel after the government previously had a
plan to lower corporate taxes.”  Tax Credit  Prime Minister  Benjamin Netanyahu  proposed the tax package
after demonstrators during the summer calling for lower prices,
more affordable housing and free pre-school education. Netanyahu
appointed a committee led by economist  Manuel Trajtenberg  that
recommended the tax changes, along with other proposals,
including a cut to the  defense budget .  The steps approved yesterday include raising the income-tax
rate for those who earn at least 1 million shekels a year to 48
percent from 45 percent. A gasoline tax increase will be
scrapped.  Israel posted a November budget deficit of 800 million
shekels as revenue from income taxes declined, the  Finance
Ministry  said in an e-mailed statement today. The revenue
shortfall for the first 11 months of the year was 3.3 billion
shekels, most of which was due to tax collection in the past
three months.  The  Tel-Bond 40  index of corporate bonds gained 0.2 percent
to 255.88. The shekel weakened 0.2 percent to 3.7450 against the
dollar as of 4:37 p.m. The yield on the benchmark bonds due
January 2022 advanced one basis point to 4.71 percent.  The  Bank of Israel  sold 1.5 billion shekels in Makam bills
due February 2012 at an average yield of 2.7 percent at an
auction today.     The central bank also issued 11.5 billion shekels
in one-year bills due December 2012 at an average yield of 2.8
percent compared with 2.86 percent at a Nov. 1 sale of similar
maturity securities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
