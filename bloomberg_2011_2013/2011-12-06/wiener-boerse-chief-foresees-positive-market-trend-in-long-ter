Stock markets in central and eastern
 Europe  are likely to rise in the long term, as some companies
have “done their homework” in recent years and will emerge
stronger from the crisis, according to Heinrich Schaller, who
heads the Austrian stock exchange.  “We see a positive trend in the long-term even though
we’re in a phase now where markets may fall sharply, because we
believe some companies are in a much better shape than three
years ago and they have done their homework,” Schaller, the
chief executive officer of Wiener Boerse AG, said at a
conference in Budapest today.  Shares prices have fallen in the region as the global
financial crisis and Europe’s debt woes have prompted investors
to shun riskier assets. Wiener Boerse controls the Prague,
Budapest and Ljubljana exchanges.  “A large part of liquidity is flowing into gold, at which
I can only shake my head,” Schaller said. “Against all
beliefs, gold doesn’t offer protection.”  Bullion is in the 11th year of a  bull market  and prices
reached a record $1,921.15 an ounce on Sept. 6 as investors
sought to diversify away from equities and some currencies.
Holdings in exchange-traded products backed by gold reached a
record 2,356 tons on Nov. 30.  To contact the reporter on this story:
