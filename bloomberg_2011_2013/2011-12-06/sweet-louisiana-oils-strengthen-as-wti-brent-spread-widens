The premiums for Light Louisiana
Sweet and Heavy Louisiana Sweet oils strengthened as West Texas
Intermediate crude’s discount to Brent widened.  The January WTI-Brent spread widened 71 cents to settle at
$9.53 a barrel. The gap for the contracts nearest to expiration
has narrowed by 66 percent since reaching a record of $27.88 a
barrel Oct. 14.  When Brent increases versus WTI, it strengthens the value
of low-sulfur U.S. grades that compete with West African oil
priced against the European benchmark.  Light Louisiana Sweet ’s premium above WTI increased 15
cents to $10.65 a barrel at 4:44 p.m. in  New York , according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Heavy Louisiana Sweet’s  premium
added 60 cents to $11.15.  Thunder Horse’s premium widened 10 cents to $8.85 above
WTI. The premium for Mars Blend added 40 cents to $6.70 a
barrel.  Poseidon  weakened 25 cents to $5.75 a barrel over WTI.  Southern Green Canyon ’s premium narrowed $1 to $5.25 a
barrel and  West Texas Sour ’s discount widened 5 cents to 85
cents.  The discount for  Western Canada Select  widened 85 cents to
$12.90 a barrel.  Syncrude ’s premium slipped 5 cents to $2.90 a barrel.
Syncrude is a light, low-sulfur synthetic oil derived from the
tar sands in  Alberta .  To contact the reporter on this story:
