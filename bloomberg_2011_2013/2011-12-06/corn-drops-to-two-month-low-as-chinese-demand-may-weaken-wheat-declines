Corn fell to a two-month low in
 Chicago  on concern Chinese demand for imported crops may slow as
the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  might raise grain-inventory
estimates. Wheat and soybeans declined.  A purchasing managers’ index for Chinese services
industries slid last month. From Sept. 1 to Dec. 1, the amount
of U.S. corn inspected for export dropped 10 percent from a year
earlier, USDA data show. China is the world’s biggest consumer
of corn, wheat and pork and the top soybean importer.  “The demand in China -- there’s evidence it’s slowing,”
said  William Adams , whose Resilience AG fund has gained 5.4
percent since its inception in August. “One could suggest that
they’re going to buy fewer soybeans, eat less pork and buy less
corn.”  Corn for March delivery retreated 1.5 percent to $5.82 a
bushel by 1:15 p.m.  London  time on the Chicago Board of Trade,
sliding for a fourth session. The grain touched $5.80, the
lowest price since Oct. 4.  Wheat for March delivery dropped 1.1 percent to $6.045 a
bushel. Milling wheat for March delivery traded on NYSE Liffe in
Paris fell 0.7 percent to 176 euros ($235) a metric ton.  The USDA may forecast 2012 global wheat stockpiles at
202.89 million tons on Dec. 9, up from a November estimate of
202.6 million tons, according to a Bloomberg News survey.  Higher wheat output in Australia and quality downgrades
will add to “a glut of feed grain,” Luke Mathews, a commodity
strategist at Commonwealth Bank of  Australia , said in a report
e-mailed today.  World inventories of  corn  may reach 122.13 million tons,
higher than the USDA’s forecast of 121.57 million tons last
month, according to the survey’s average estimate.  Soybeans for delivery in January fell 0.4 percent to
$11.2225 a bushel in Chicago.  To contact the reporters on this story:
