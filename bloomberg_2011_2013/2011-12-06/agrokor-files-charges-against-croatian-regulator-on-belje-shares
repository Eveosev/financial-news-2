Agrokor d.d.,  Croatia ’s largest
private company, is suing the  market regulator  over its decision
in October that Agrokor must complete the takeover of its
agricultural facility,  Belje d.d. (BLJERA)   Agrokor filed charges to the Constitutional and to the
Administrative court claiming the regulator known as Hanfa
violated its constitutional rights by requesting on Oct. 6 that
Zagreb-based company buy all of Belje’s shares following its
acquisition of a majority in Belje, Hanfa said today in a
statement on its website.  Agrokor, which bought Belje shares in 2005 and 2007, now
owns 67 percent of the eastern Croatian agricultural plant. The
purchase of the remaining shares may cost Agrokor as much as 100
million euros ($134 million) because it will have to offer about
300 kuna per share, the price of Belje’s stock when Agrokor’s
obligation originated in 2007. Belje’s shares were trading at 90
kuna per share at 1:44 p.m. today.  The deadline for completing the takeover was Dec. 5, Hanfa
said, adding that Agrokor has failed to comply.  Agrokor’s representatives said they were preparing a
statement when reached by phone in Zagreb.  Croatia’s largest food manufacturer on Oct. 17 made a non-
binding offer for Slovenia’s  Mercator Poslovni Sistem d.d. (MELR)  of
840 million euros ($1.12 billion) as it expands further in the
Balkans. Negotiations are under way with Mercator’s owners.  To contact the reporter responsible for the story:
