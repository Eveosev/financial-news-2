Iraq ’s Cabinet approved a federal
spending plan of almost $100 billion for 2012, state minister
and government spokesman Ali al-Dabbagh said.  The budget is based on an oil price of $85 a barrel and is
smaller than the $112 billion spending plan discussed by the
Cabinet in September, which was based on an oil price of $90 a
barrel, Dabbagh said by phone from  Baghdad . The deficit will be
about 16 trillion dinars ($14 billion), he said.  Revenue projections are based on exports of 2.6 million
barrels of oil a day, including 175,000 barrels from the
northern Kurdish region, higher than the 2.2 million barrels a
day forecast in last year’s budget. Iraq has $4.5 billion in
International Monetary Fund loans available should it need
additional funds, Dabbagh said.  Iraq, which has the world’s fifth-biggest crude reserves,
is seeking foreign investment and expertise to help boost energy
exports and pay to rebuild an economy and infrastructure
destroyed by conflict, economic sanctions and sabotage.  To contact the reporter on this story:
