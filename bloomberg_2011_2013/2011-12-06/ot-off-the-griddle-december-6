Good morning, and welcome back to the Griddle, a menu of fortified items for the busy person's media diet. One of the biggest business stories of our era is how rising incomes in  Asia  are driving demand for limited resources. Sometimes they’re illegal. This morning we  learn  that rhino poachers in  South Africa  felled 405 of the endangered beasts in 2011, a 22 percent increase over last year. More than 200 people have been arrested. The rhinos' horns are sold in  East Asia , where they are believed to have medicinal qualities, including a purported cure for cancer.
