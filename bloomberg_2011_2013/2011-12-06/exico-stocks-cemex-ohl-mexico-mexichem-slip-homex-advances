The following companies had unusual
price changes in  Mexico  trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of the close of trading.  The IPC  index (MEXBOL)  fell 0.1 percent to 37,071.17.  Mexican stocks declined as Standard & Poor’s put 15 euro-
area nations on watch for potential rating downgrades.  Cemex SAB (CEMEXCPO)  , the largest cement maker in the
Americas, fell 0.7 percent to 6.76 pesos. OHL Mexico SAB
(OHLMEX* MM), the Mexican unit of Spanish construction company
Obrascon Huarte Lain SA, fell 1.7 percent to 22.36 pesos.  Desarrolladora Homex SAB (HOMEX*)  , Mexico’s largest
homebuilder, rose 7.8 percent to 29.17 pesos. Homex expects 2012
sales to rise 37 percent to 39 percent, including contracts with
the federal government to build prisons, according to a
statement yesterday to the Mexican stock exchange.  Mexichem SAB (MEXCHEM*)  , Latin America’s biggest maker
of plastic pipes, fell 1.1 percent to 46.86 pesos. Mexichem
raised its offer to 457 million euros ($612.2 million) to gain
“friendly” support to buy Wavin NV, the Tlalnepantla, Mexico-
based company said today in a statement. Later, Wavin said the
offer was “unacceptable,” according a separate statement
distributed by Thomson Reuters One.  To contact the reporter on this story:
