Euro-area leaders are considering
allowing the single currencyâ€™s temporary bailout fund to run
concurrently with the European Stability Mechanism to be
introduced next year, the  Financial Times Deutschland  reported
without saying where it got the information.  The paper said leaders are considering the move as it would
allow almost double the financial firepower of the ESM to be
deployed. Advocates of the move also say euro area states should
contribute more to the International Monetary Fund, the paper
reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
