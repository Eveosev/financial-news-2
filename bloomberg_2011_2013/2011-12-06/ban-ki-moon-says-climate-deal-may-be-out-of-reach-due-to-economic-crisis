United Nations Secretary General Ban
Ki-Moon said global warming talks this week may not be able to
make a breakthrough because of the world economic crisis, though
envoys should work harder to limit climate change.  “We must be realistic about the opportunity of a
breakthrough in Durban,” Ban said at UN climate talks in the
South African port city. “There are great economic troubles”
and a far-reaching treaty “may be beyond our reach for now.”  “None of these uncertainties should prevent us from taking
real progress here in Durban. Now is the moment to be
ambitious.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
