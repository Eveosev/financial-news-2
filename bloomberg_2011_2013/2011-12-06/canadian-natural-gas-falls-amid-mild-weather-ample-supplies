Canadian natural gas fell amid mild
U.S. weather and abundant supplies that have pared demand for
furnace fuels.  Alberta  gas fell 0.9 percent after forecasters including
AccuWeather Inc. predicted warmer weather for large U.S. cities.
New York’s high will touch 56 degrees Fahrenheit (13 Celsius)
tomorrow, 10 degrees higher than normal, AccuWeather said. U.S.
stockpiles were 7.3 percent above the five-year average as of
Nov. 25, according to the Energy Department.  “An extremely mild November explains some of the recent
surge in the storage surplus,” said Stephen Smith, an analyst
and president of Stephen Smith Energy Associates in Natchez,
Mississippi. “Average onshore gas production has been routinely
running 5 billion to 6 billion cubic feet a day higher than a
year ago. It’s going to take a while to fix this problem.”  Alberta gas for January delivery fell 2.75 cents to C$3.07
per gigajoule ($2.88 per million British thermal units) as of
4:05 p.m.  New York  time, according to  NGX , a Canadian Internet
market. Gas traded on the exchange is shipped to users in  Canada 
and the U.S. and priced on TransCanada Corp.’s Alberta system.  Gas for January delivery rose 2.6 cents, or 0.8 percent, to
settle at $3.487 per million Btu on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange .  Spot gas at the Alliance delivery point near  Chicago  fell
6.61 cents, or 1.8 percent, to $3.6135 per million Btu on the
 Intercontinental Exchange . Alliance is an express line that can
carry 1.5 billion cubic feet a day to the Midwest from western
Canada.  Spot Prices  At the Kingsgate point on the border of  Idaho  and British
Columbia, gas slipped 5.25 cents, or 1.5 percent, to $3.4563,
according to ICE. At Malin,  Oregon , where Canadian gas is traded
for California markets, gas was down 5.1 cents, or 1.4 percent,
to $3.5702 per million Btu.  Volume on TransCanada’s Alberta system, which collects the
output of most of the nation’s gas wells, was 16.4 billion cubic
feet, 133 million under its target.  Gas was flowing at a daily rate of 2.8 billion cubic feet
at Empress, Alberta, where the fuel is transferred to
TransCanada’s main line.  At McNeil, Saskatchewan, where gas is transferred to the
Northern Border Pipeline for shipment to the Chicago area, the
daily flow rate was 1.95 billion cubic feet.  Available capacity on TransCanada’s British Columbia system
at Kingsgate was 842 million cubic feet. The system was forecast
to carry 1.88 billion cubic feet today, about 69 percent of its
capacity of 2.72 billion.  The volume on  Spectra Energy’s  British Columbia system,
which gathers the fuel in northeastern British Columbia for
delivery to Vancouver and the Pacific Northwest, totaled 2.9
billion cubic feet at 3:35 p.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
