CBS Corp. (CBS) , owner of the most-watched
U.S. television network, expects to pay more to air National
Football League games under new agreements being negotiated by
broadcasters.  “We’re aware if a new deal gets made, when it gets made,
the price of poker is going up, it should go up,” Chief
Executive Officer Leslie Moonves said today at a UBS investor
conference in  New York . “Even a bad football game out-rates
most programming.”  CBS will make money with any new NFL contract, Moonves
said, without providing specifics. CBS,  News Corp. (NWSA) ’s Fox and
 Comcast Corp. (CMCSA) ’s NBC are near a $24 billion agreement with the
NFL to extend TV rights through 2021, a 60 percent hike in fees,
Sports Business Journal reported on Dec. 5.  Higher sports fees are leading to unsustainable increases
in cable bills, Greg Maffei, CEO of Liberty Media Corp., and
 Viacom Inc.  CEO Philippe Dauman said  yesterday at the
conference.  CBS gained 2.3 percent to $26.23 at 4 p.m. in New York
trading. The shares have climbed 38 percent this year.  The NFL’s current contract with the three TV networks runs
through 2013, Sports Business Journal reported. With the new
contract, the networks also gain digital rights to put more
programming online, according to the publication.  Walt Disney Co. (DIS) ’s ESPN agreed to pay the NFL $1.9 billion a
season, a 73 percent increase, through 2021 to air national
match-ups on Monday nights, people with knowledge of the matter
said in September.  To contact the reporter on this story:
