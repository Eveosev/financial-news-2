OAO Mechel (MTL) , Russia’s largest producer
of steel-making coal, fell the most in a month in U.S. trading
after the miner stopped work at two sites amid safety concerns.  Mechel (MTLR) ’s American depositary receipts dropped 11 percent to
$10.45 in New York, the biggest decline since Nov. 9.  Several facilities at the company’s Lenin and New-
Olzherassk mines were shut following complaints to the Siberian
branch of Russia’s industrial safety watchdog, Mechel said in a
statement today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
