Former Primary Global Research LLC
executive James Fleishman lost a bid to have a conviction for
his role in an insider-trading conspiracy thrown out by a
federal judge.  U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff in  Manhattan  also rejected
Fleishman’s request for a new trial. Rakoff denied both requests
in a one-page order made public today.  Fleishman, of  Santa Clara , California, had argued that
prosecutors failed to establish that any of his alleged
contributions to the conspiracy occurred in  New York . He had
also said he was improperly barred from taking the stand in his
own defense when he was told that before he could be questioned
he had to turn over his personal diaries to prosecutors  Fleishman was convicted in September of two separate
conspiracy charges for what the U.S. said was a scheme to obtain
and pass confidential information from technology company
employees who moonlighted as consultants for  Mountain View ,
California-based Primary Global, a so-called expert-networking
firm.  The nonpublic information went to fund managers who paid
Primary Global for consultation calls, prosecutors said.  Fleishman’s sentencing is set for Dec. 21. He faces as long
as 20 years in prison on the most serious count, according to
prosecutors.  Ethan Balogh , a lawyer for Fleishman, didn’t immediately
return a voice-mail message left at his office seeking comment.  The case is U.S. v. Nguyen, 11-cr-32, U.S. District Court,
Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
