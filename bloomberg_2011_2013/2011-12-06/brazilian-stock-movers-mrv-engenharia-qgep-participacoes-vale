The following companies had  unusual (IBOV) 
price changes in  Sao Paulo  trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of the close. Preferred shares are
usually the most-traded class of stock.  The Bovespa index gained 1.1 percent to 59,536.16.  Banco do Brasil SA  (BBAS3) rose 1 percent to 24.41 reais.
 Latin America ’s biggest bank by assets said it hasn’t received
any request from its controlling shareholder to study a possible
capital increase, according to a regulatory filing. O Globo
reported yesterday that  Brazil ’s government, which controls the
bank, was considering an increase in Banco do Brasil’s capital.  Multiplus SA  (MPLU3 BS), the frequent-flyer unit of
Brazilian airline Tam SA, jumped 5 percent to 32.25 reais, the
highest in six months. The company’s board approved changing the
prices it pays Tam for tickets and the amount it charges Tam for
air miles, according to a regulatory filing. The move will
likely boost earnings per share by 25 percent, overshadowing the
resulting 2.5 percent loss in revenue, Banco BTG Pactual SA said
in a report.  QGEP Participacoes SA  (QGEP3 BS) rose 1.9 percent to 16.94
reais. The  oil company  controlled by Queiroz Galvao SA expects
to start crude production in 2013, Chief Executive Officer Jose Augusto Fernandes said in Sao Paulo today. QGEP expects to
produce about 6 million cubic meters a day of natural gas next
year, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
