Nigeria ’s naira weakened the most in
almost a week against the dollar on speculation that demand for
the U.S. currency will be fueled by year-end sales.  The currency of  Africa ’s biggest oil producer depreciated
as much as 0.3 percent to 161.6 as of 2:24 p.m. on the  interbank
market  in Lagos, the most since Nov. 30, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  “Nigeria being an import-dependent economy would always
have exchange issues; demand for dollars always pressurizes the
local currency,” Sola Fadahunsi, an analyst at GTB Asset
Management Ltd. in Lagos, said in an e-mailed reply to questions
today. The naira will weaken as “Nigerians would need dollars
to bring in stuff for year-end sales and companies will want to
bolster their dollar positions against 2012.”  The  Central Bank of Nigeria  on Nov. 21 lowered the midpoint
of its exchange-rate band at its twice-weekly auctions to 155
naira per dollar from 150 naira. Rising imports and weakening
oil prices, the source of more than 95 percent of Nigeria’s
foreign-exchange income, mounted pressure on the bank.  The  central bank  sold $200 million at a foreign-currency
auction yesterday, less than the $229 million  demanded  by
lenders. The  marginal rate , which is also used as the prevailing
exchange rate, depreciated by 0.1 percent to 156.50 per dollar,
compared with the previous auction on Nov. 30, the Abuja-based
bank said. The last time lenders’ demand was met was Nov. 16.  “I do not foresee a drastic plunge,” said Fadahunsi.
“Don’t think the authorities would just sit by and let that
happen; a plunging local currency is not the best signal to
foreign investment.”  Ghana ’s cedi slipped 0.2 percent to 1.6295 per dollar as of
1:25 p.m. in Accra.  To contact the reporter on this story:
