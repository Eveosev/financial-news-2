Japanese Finance Minister  Jun Azumi 
will be rewarding investors who buy more than 10 million yen
($129,000) in reconstruction bonds with gold in the governmentâ€™s
latest attempt to bolster demand for the debt.  Individual investors who hold the bonds for three years
will be eligible for a gold commemorative coin valued at 10,000
yen, the  Finance Ministry  said in Tokyo today. At 15.6 grams,
(0.55 ounces), it would be worth about $948 based on prices for
the precious metal. Only a limited number of coins will be
issued, the Finance Ministry said in a statement.  Azumi, whose hometown was devastated by the March 11
disaster, said today he bought 1 million yen of the debt to
support rebuilding efforts from the March 11 earthquake and
tsunami. Offering gold bolsters the value of the return on the
debt, which will be at 0.05 percent for the first three years.  Silver coins weighing 31.1 grams valued at 1,000 yen will
be distributed to those who own more than 1 million yen of the
bonds, the government said. The coins will be offered for debt
going on sale in March. All investors receive a thank-you note
from the minister, who showed his to reporters in  Tokyo  today as
proof of his purchase. Chief Cabinet Secretary Osamu Fujimura
also bought the bonds, Azumi said, without saying how much.  To contact the reporter on this story:
