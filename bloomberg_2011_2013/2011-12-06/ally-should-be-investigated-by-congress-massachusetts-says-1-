Ally Financial Inc.  should be
investigated by U.S. House and Senate committees, said
Massachusetts Attorney General  Martha Coakley , who sued the
company and other mortgage servicers over foreclosure practices.  Coakley asked the U.S. Senate Committee on Banking, Housing
and Urban Affairs and the U.S. House Committee on Financial
Services to investigate the lender, according to a letter dated
today and provided by Coakley’s office.  “The federal government should not tolerate Ally’s serious
misconduct and instead should hold them accountable for unlawful
actions taken against borrowers,” Coakley wrote to the chairmen
of the committees.  On Dec. 1, Coakley sued Detroit-based Ally,  JPMorgan Chase
& Co. (JPM) , Bank of America Corp.,  Citigroup Inc. (C)  and  Wells Fargo &
Co. (WFC)  for allegedly conducting unlawful foreclosures and deceiving
homeowners. The following day GMAC Mortgage, Ally’s mortgage
origination and servicing unit, announced that it would stop
buying new  mortgage loans  in the state.  “As we have said in the past, GMAC Mortgage is operating
in full compliance with the law,” Ally spokeswoman Gina Proia
said in an e-mailed statement today. “It is regrettable that
there is a call to spend additional taxpayer funds to further
investigate this matter beyond the extensive and expensive
investigations that have already been completed by numerous
federal and state agencies.”  Ally is 74 percent owned by the U.S. Treasury Department
after receiving three rounds of government bailout funds
totaling $17.2 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
