Confindustria,  Italy ’s employers’
lobby, called on lawmakers to swiftly approve the government’s
30 billion-euro ($40 billion) emergency budget plan.  “The package, though painful in some parts, is absolutely
needed” and Parliament must approve it “as soon as possible,”
Confindustria Director General Giampaolo Galli said in a speech
in Rome today. Italy’s economy is shrinking and will keep doing
so next year, providing “a reason for anxiety,” he said.  Prime Minister  Mario Monti ’s Cabinet approved the package
by decree on Dec. 4, meaning it takes effect immediately and the
legislature has 60 days to pass the measures for them to remain
in effect. Both houses of Parliament are expected to vote before
the Christmas recess.  The plan includes an overhaul of the pension system, a
property tax abolished by the previous government, higher levies
on gasoline and luxury goods such as yachts and sports cars, and
tax breaks for companies that hire women and young workers.  To contact the reporters on this story:
