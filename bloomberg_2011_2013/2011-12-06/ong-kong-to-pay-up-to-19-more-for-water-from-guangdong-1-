Hong Kong  agreed to pay as much as 19
percent more for water from the southern Chinese province of
Guangdong under a three-year supply deal.  The city will pay Guangdong HK$3.54 billion ($455 million)
for supplies from the Dong River next year, HK$3.74 billion in
2013 and $3.96 billion in 2014, the Hong Kong government said in
a statement yesterday. That compares with HK$3.34 billion paid
this year,  Guangdong Investment Ltd. (270) , a provincial water utility,
said in a statement yesterday.  The increase in payments takes into account inflation and
the yuan’s appreciation against the Hong Kong dollar, according
to the city government. The annual water-supply target remains
at 1.1 billion cubic meters, Guangdong Investment said.  “There is currently no plan to increase water tariffs,”
Gabriel Pang, spokesman at Hong Kong’s Water Supplies Department,
said by telephone today.  The city’s water bill per 200 cubic meters was less than
half that of the U.S. and  Japan  in 2009,  data  from the
International Water Association show.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
