Alliant Energy Corp. (LNT) , the owner of
electric utilities in the U.S. Midwest, revised the change-in-
control provisions for its retirement plans and executive
severance agreements.  The changes restrict the ability of a “successor to the
company” to amend employee retirement plans for three years
following the takeover of the utility, according to a filing
today with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  Alliant Energy, based in Madison, Wisconsin, amended its
executive severance plan to require that payments and benefits
start on the 60th day following termination, according to the
filing.  The company also changed the timing of severance payments
for executive officers to 10 days after the date of the change-
of-control of the company, the filing said.  The revisions are effective Jan. 1, 2012, the company said.
Alliant Energy has 1 million electric customers and 412,000 gas
customers in Iowa,  Wisconsin  and Minnesota, according to the
company’s  website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
