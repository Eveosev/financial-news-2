Missouri Public Service Commission
staff said they need more time to make a recommendation on
 Energy Transfer Equity LP (ETE) ’s $5.2 billion purchase of  Southern
Union Co. (SUG)   Staff notified the commission in a  filing  today that it
would make its recommendation on or before Jan. 6. The
commission had asked its staff to make the recommendation today.  The commission is reviewing the merger because Houston-
based Southern Union owns a natural-gas utility in the state,
Missouri Gas Energy Inc.  Energy Transfer, based in Dallas, agreed to buy Southern
Union on July 19 for $44.25 a share in cash and partnership
units. Shareholders are scheduled to vote on the sale Dec. 9 and
the deal is expected to close in the first quarter of 2012.  Missouri commission officials said they couldn’t comment
beyond the public filings. A spokeswoman for  Energy Transfer 
didn’t immediately return a phone call seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
