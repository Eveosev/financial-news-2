U.S. gasoline demand rose 1 percent
last week to a 14-week high as motorists refilled their tanks
after the Thanksgiving holiday weekend, according to  MasterCard
Inc. (MA)   Drivers bought 9.06 million barrels a day of gasoline in
the week ended Dec. 2, up from 8.97 million the week before,
according to MasterCard Inc.’s SpendingPulse report. That’s the
highest level since Aug. 26 and follows a 3 percent gain during
the prior week.  Fuel use fell below a year earlier for the 14th consecutive
time last week, down 4 percent from 2010 levels. Fuel demand
over the previous four weeks was 4.2 percent below a year
earlier, the 37th consecutive decline in that measure.  “While the post-Thanksgiving week produced week-over-week
gains similar to ones we had seen last year, given the overall
depressed levels of gasoline demand, we continue to observe
declines in year-over-year terms,” John Gamel, a gasoline
analyst and director of economic analysis for SpendingPulse,
said in the report.  Thanksgiving was on Nov. 24 this year and the holiday
period extended through Nov. 27.  On a regional basis, fuel demand rose in six of seven
geographic districts last week and was little changed in the
lower Atlantic region. The largest increase was in the Rocky
Mountain area where consumption jumped 5.8 percent.  Gasoline consumption in 2011 through Dec. 2 is down 1.5
percent from a year earlier, a wider gap than the prior week’s
1.4 percent difference, according to the second-biggest payments
network company.  Pump Price Falls  The average pump price fell 4 cents to $3.30 a gallon, the
lowest level since Feb. 25. Prices were 15 percent higher than a
year earlier.  Gasoline demand peaked this year at 9.56 million barrels a
day in the week ended July 1 as motorists filled their tanks
before the July 4 holiday weekend. The lowest level of
consumption came in the week ended Feb. 11 when consumers bought
8.47 million barrels a day.  The report from Purchase, New York-based MasterCard is
assembled by MasterCard Advisors, the company’s consulting arm.
The information is based on credit-card swipes and cash and
check payments at about 140,000 U.S. gasoline stations.  Visa Inc. (V)  is the biggest payments network company by
transactions processed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
