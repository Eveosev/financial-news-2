Oil options volatility fell as the
underlying futures closed higher after equities rebounded on a
report the European Union was in talks to double the size of its
rescue fund.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
January, a measure of expected swings in futures and a gauge of
options prices, fell to 33.9 at 5:45 p.m. in  New York , from 34.5
yesterday. Crude rose 0.3 percent after stocks advanced on a
Financial Times report of the EU talks. Prices had retreated
earlier as  Standard & Poorâ€™s  said it may cut European ratings.  The most active options contracts in electronic trading
