     Dec. 6 (Bloomberg) --The Italian government will gain an
additional 11 billion euros ($14.7 billion) a year after
reintroducing a tax on main properties and raising the existing
levy on other homes, the Ansa newswire reported, citing a
government document.  The main-residence tax will by itself generate revenue of
3.8 billion euros, Ansa said. The levy, abolished by the
previous government in 2008, is part of a 30 billion-euro
emergency budget plan approved by government decree on Dec. 4 to
shore up Italyâ€™s public finances and boost growth.  Another measure de-linking larger pensions from inflation
will generate 3.8 billion euros in spending cuts next year, Ansa
reported, citing the same document. A one-time charge of 1.5
percent applied to funds held abroad and repatriated or declared
in a tax amnesty through January 2011 will bring in revenues for
2.19 billion euro over the next two years, the  news agency  said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
