Bulgaria ’s financial regulator
approved an application to trade the government’s minority 33
percent stakes in the Bulgarian units of Austrian utility  EVN AG (EVN) 
on the  Bulgarian Stock Exchange .  EVN Bulgaria Electrosnabdiavane and EVN Bulgaria
Electrorazpredelenie, EVN’s two Bulgarian power units in charge
of distribution and grid operation, will be listed as public
companies, the  Financial Supervision Commission  in Sofia said in
an e-mail today.  The 33 percent stakes in Electrosnabdiavane and
Electrorazpredelenie, or 188,200 and 156,400 shares
respectively, will be offered, with a nominal value of 10 lev
($6.84) each, worth a total of 1.882 million lev for
Electrosnabdiavane and 1.564 million lev for
Electrorazpredelenie, the commission said.  The government is selling its minority stakes in all seven
power distributors, which were sold in 2005 to  Germany ’s E.ON
AG, CEZ AS and EVN in the run-up to joining the European Union.
EVN has 1.5 million customers in Plovdiv and Stara Zagora in
southern Bulgaria.  EVN Bulgaria shares will be traded through a “mixed closed
auction” organized by the bourse on its Privatization Market,
the commission said. The minimum price will be set by the asset-
selling agency in Sofia, the commission said.  E.ON (EOAN)  has signed an agreement with Czech utility Energo-Pro
to sell its 100 percent subsidiary in Bulgaria in a deal worth
133 million euros ($174.1 million), the company said on Dec. 3.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
