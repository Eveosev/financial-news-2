Croatia’s new government will seek to
delay a referendum on  European Union  entry because of time
constraints following Dec. 4 elections, said  Vesna Pusic , who is
slated to be the next foreign minister.  The Balkan country will sign an EU accession treaty on Dec.
9 in Brussels. It is scheduled to hold a referendum within 30
days of that date, according to a  parliamentary  decree. Changing
the timing of the referendum “most likely to February, and by
the end of March at the latest” will be one of the first things
the new government in Zagreb will do, Pusic said by phone today.  “It would be irresponsible to hold a referendum without
solid preparations,” said Pusic, a co-leader of the  Croatian
People’s Party , one of the four parties in a coalition that won
80 seats in the 151-member legislature. “It also wouldn’t be
good to hold a referendum so soon after the elections, which is
always a conflicting event.”  Croatia  concluded negotiations with the world’s biggest
trading bloc in June after five years of talks and is scheduled
to join the EU in July 2013. Croatia’s accession also needs to
be ratified by the parliaments of all 27 current member states.  Support for EU membership remained stable in Croatia at 53
percent in September, according to an  IPSOS-Puls  survey of 1,000
people. No margin of error was given.  To contact the reporter responsible for the story:
