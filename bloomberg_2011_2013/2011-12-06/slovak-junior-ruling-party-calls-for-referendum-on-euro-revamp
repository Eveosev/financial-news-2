Slovakia’s junior coalition member
said it will seek a referendum on a revamp of the euro region’s
rules should they “significantly” reduce the country’s
independence, Chairman Richard Sulik said.  European leaders will meet later this week to discuss
solutions to stop the two-year-old debt crisis from spreading.
Finance Minister Ivan Miklos said earlier today the country will
back a plan by Germany and  France  for tighter fiscal co-
operation within the euro-sharing bloc.  The Freedom and Solidarity party is against creating a
fiscal union with new institutions or any changes to the veto
powers of individual members of the bloc, Sulik said at a press
conference in Bratislava, Slovakia, today. Should the leaders at
the summit agree on such measures, the party, known also as SaS,
will propose the referendum for the same day as the elections on
March 10, he said.  SaS’ rejection of an overhaul of the European bailout
system in October brought down the Cabinet of Iveta Radicova in
a linked confidence vote. The party remains part of Radicova’s
care-taking government, which will rule the country until the
early vote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
