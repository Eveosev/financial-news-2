The  San Diego  Chargers beat the
Jacksonville Jaguars 38-14 to end a six-game losing streak and
keep their slim National Football League playoff chances alive.  Philip Rivers  threw three touchdown passes last night at
EverBank Stadium in Jacksonville,  Florida , as the Chargers won
for the second time in six road games to improve to 5-7 on the
season. San Diego trails the Denver Broncos and Oakland Raiders
by two games in the American Football Conference’s West division
with four regular-season games remaining.  Mike Tolbert and Ryan Mathews each had rushing touchdowns
for the Chargers, who scored the game’s final 28 points to halt
their longest losing skid since 2001, when they ended the season
with nine straight defeats.  The Jaguars, who last week fired coach Jack Del Rio and
announced the franchise would be sold, fell to 3-9.  To contact the reporter on this story:
