Soccer’s governing body postponed the
release of a file that will name executives who took payments
from bankrupt broadcaster ISL after a legal challenge.  FIFA planned to release the information at a meeting in
Japan Dec. 17. Today, the ruling body said that the challenge
meant it would have to delay the move. FIFA said it would
continue to try to publish the material.  “This does not change my stance,” FIFA President  Sepp
Blatter  said today in an e-mailed statement. “I remain fully
committed to publishing the files as soon as possible as an
important part of my many reform plans.”  The British Broadcasting Corp.’s “Panorama” program said
last year that former FIFA president Joao Havelange received $1
million from ISL, which owned World Cup television rights and
collapsed with debts of $300 million in 2001. Havelange has
denied the allegations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
