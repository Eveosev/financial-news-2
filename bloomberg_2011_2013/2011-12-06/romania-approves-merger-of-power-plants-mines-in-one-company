Romania  approved the merger of three
state-owned thermal  power plants  and coal mines into a new
company called Complexul Energetic Oltenia SA, the country’s
Economy Ministry said.  Complexul Energetic Craiova SA, Complexul Energetic
Rovinari SA, Complexul Energetic Turceni SA and Societatea
Nationala a Lignitului SA will merge “to create in the shortest
time period a strong and viable company which will ensure the
necessary framework for increased efficiency and needed
investments,” the ministry said today in an e-mailed statement.  Fondul Proprietatea SA , which holds minority stakes in the
companies, has agreed to the merger after it sued the government
last year to block a planned merger of Romania’s hydropower and
hard coal holdings into one company called Hidroenergetica SA
and coal-fired and hydropower plants and two nuclear reactors
under a second holding called Electra SA.  The Balkan nation plans to sell majority stakes in the
newly formed Oltenia to fulfill pledges to the  International
Monetary Fund  and the European Union. Romania may also merge
other two thermal power plants and coal mines under a second
company called Hunedoara SA, according to a law draft on the
 ministry’s website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
