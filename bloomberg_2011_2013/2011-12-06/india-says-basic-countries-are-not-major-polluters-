India,  China , Brazil and  South Africa 
are not major polluters and shouldn’t be asked to move first on
reducing greenhouse gas emissions, India’s lead envoy on the
environment said at a press conference of the Basic negotiating
group.  “Basic countries are not major polluters,” Indian
Environment Minister Jayanthi Natarajan said today in Durban,
South Africa. “They are emerging market economies. They have a
small footprint in the context of historical emissions. That is
why there should be action and fulfilment of promises by Annex I
countries.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
