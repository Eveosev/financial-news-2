Tullett Prebon Plc (TLPR) , a British inter-
dealer broker, is making contingency plans for the breakup of
the euro and is prepared to start trading new currencies, a
person familiar with the matter said.  Tullett is responding to enquiries from clients concerned
about the outlook for the single currency, said the person, who
declined to be identified because the preparations aren’t
public. The firm would be able to begin trading the new currency
within two days, the person said.  Tullett joins firms including  ICAP Plc (IAP)  in making
preparations for a possible break-up of the single currency as
the region’s sovereign debt crisis spreads. European Union
leaders are meeting on Friday to hammer out a plan to soothe
investor concern.  ICAP has tested trading of  Greece ’s drachma, the firm’s
chief executive officer of electronic broking, David Rutter,
said today in a Bloomberg Television interview. A spokesman for
Tullett declined to comment when contacted by Bloomberg News.  Inter-dealer brokers such as Tullett act as a go-between
for banks that trade bonds, stocks, currencies, energy and
derivatives. They typically handle more trades between banks
during periods of greater market volatility. Tullett, which
split off from U.K. stockbroker  Collins Stewart  in 2006,
competes against ICAP, the biggest broker of transactions
between banks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
