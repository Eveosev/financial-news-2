Lithuanian President Dalia Grybauskaite won’t back the government’s decision to slow
pension increases amid a worsening growth outlook, the  Baltic
News Service  reported.  The Cabinet decided yesterday to cut back on increases in
retirement benefits and raise pensions by half of the initially
planned amount. Grybauskaite said today the government cannot
save at “the expense of the most vulnerable,” BNS said, citing
her.  The government needs to save an additional 800 million
litai ($309.9 million) in the 2012 budget plan after the  Finance
Ministry  lowered its economic growth outlook to 2.5 percent from
4.7 percent next year. The government decided to backtrack on
pension increases to plug the shortfall after the ruling
coalition rejected increases in the value-added tax.  To contact the reporter on this story:
