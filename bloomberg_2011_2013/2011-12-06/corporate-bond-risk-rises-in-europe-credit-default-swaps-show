The cost of insuring against default
on European corporate debt rose, according to traders of credit-
default swaps.  Contracts on the Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 50
companies with mostly high-yield credit ratings increased 11.5
basis points to 761.5 basis points, according to JPMorgan Chase
& Co. at 7:30 a.m. in  London . An increase signals worsening
perceptions of  credit quality .  The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125 companies with
investment-grade ratings was up 3.25 at 176.75 basis points.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($13.3 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer
face value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
