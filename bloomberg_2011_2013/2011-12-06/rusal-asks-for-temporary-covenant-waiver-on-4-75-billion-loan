United Co. Rusal , the world’s largest
aluminum producer, has requested lenders temporarily waive
covenants on a $4.75 billion pre-export finance loan it signed
Sept. 29, according to a person with direct knowledge of the
deal.  Rusal has approached its 14 banks, led by coordinators BNP
Paribas SA and ING Bank NV, as the euro region debt crisis
threatens to slow economic growth and after failing to include
an investment project in financial projections, the person said,
who declined to be identified as the talks are private.  The financing consists of a $3.75 billion  term loan  that
pays initial interest of 285 basis points more than the London
interbank offered rate, and a $1 billion bridge portion,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. A basis point is 0.01
percentage point.  Reuters reported on the waiver request earlier today.
Rusal’s Moscow-based press office did not respond to a phone
call seeking comment outside regular business hours.  To contact the reporter on this story:
