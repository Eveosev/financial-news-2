Milan Zavadjil, the International
Monetary Fund’s senior resident representative in  Indonesia ,
comments on growth, investment and commodity prices at a forum
in Jakarta today.  On economic growth:  ”We expect the economy may grow 6.3 percent next year, the
same as the central bank forecast. Investment is picking up
strongly. Growth is not only strong, but it is getting more
balanced. Not just consumption, but investment.”  On foreign investment and exports:  ”It depends on global conditions. I can’t see foreign
investment slowing down, unless there is a very bad situation in
the world economy. The good news is commodities - even as global
economic risks increase, commodity prices are staying quite
strong, especially coal and palm oil. But if you have a very bad
slowdown, then clearly Indonesia’s exports are going to be
affected.”  On Indonesia’s main challenge in 2012:  ”Indonesia has a great need for infrastructure. It needs
to accelerate spending to support growth. Otherwise you could
have bottlenecks. I think the lack of spending on infrastructure
is a risk for growth. Indonesia needs to focus on roads and
ports to improve connectivity. The government has a good master
plan, but implementation of the master plan is what’s needed.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
