Boise State University  and San Diego
State are among five schools that will join the  Big East 
Conference in 2013,  CBSSports.com reported .  Boise State and San Diego State would join the Big East as
football-only members, while Houston, Southern Methodist and
 Central Florida  would play all sports, according to CBSSports,
citing unidentified people familiar with the situation. It said
an official announcement may come tomorrow.  Big East spokesman Chuck Sullivan didnâ€™t immediately return
messages seeking comment on the report.  The Big East would have 10 football-playing members with
the addition of those five schools and the departures of
Pittsburgh, Syracuse and  West Virginia . The Big East could then
add the U.S. Naval Academy as a football-playing member,
possibly as soon as next week, and is seeking to also add the
Air Force Academy, CBSSports said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
