Veolia Environnement SA (VIE) , the biggest
water company, is in talks with Electricite de France SA to
lower its stake in the French operations of their Dalkia energy
services venture to create a 50-50 partnership.  Veolia, which owns 66 percent, will exchange 16 percent for
businesses in faster-growing markets, Chief Executive Officer
Antoine Frerot said today at a press conference in Paris. The
partners will have a “simplified” partnership with Veolia
taking management control of the operation, which has contracts
for heating and cooling office buildings and hospitals.  The two utilities plan to move into the energy efficiency
business and trading in unused capacity, Frerot said. The move
will help Veolia improve debt-to-earnings ratios.  “Dalkia is essential to Veolia’s strategy,” and its
activities are “solid but need investment,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
