Al-Jazeera won the French
broadcasting rights for most of the  Champions League  soccer
games from 2012-13 through 2014-15, beating pay-television
channel  Canal Plus ,  Les Echos  reported, citing a decision by
UEFA, the European football association.  UEFA still has to sell the rights for 13 so-called premium
Champions League games per year including the final for the same
period, and Canal Plus may seek to buy them; TF1 paid 25 million
euros for the games for the current season,  Les Echos  said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
