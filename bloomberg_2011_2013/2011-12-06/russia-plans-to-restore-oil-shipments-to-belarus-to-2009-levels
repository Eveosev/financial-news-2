Russia , the world’s largest crude
producer, plans to restore oil exports to Belarus next year to
2009 levels.  Shipments will rise to 21 million metric tons, or 422,000
barrels a day, in 2012, an official at Russia’s Energy Ministry
said today, declining to be identified in line with policy.
Russia exported 361,000 barrels a day to Belarus from January to
November this year, according to preliminary data from the
ministry’s CDU-TEK unit.  A dispute over crude export duties between the countries
led to a drop in shipments this year and last.  To contact the reporter on this story:
