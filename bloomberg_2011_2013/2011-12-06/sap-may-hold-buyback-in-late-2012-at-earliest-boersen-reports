SAP AG (SAP)  may consider a share buyback
at the end of 2012 at the earliest,  Boersen-Zeitung  reported,
citing an interview with Chief Financial Officer Werner Brandt.  The acquisition of  SuccessFactors Inc. (SFSF)  will mean a
“slightly” negative net  liquidity  position at the end of the
first quarter that will have to be reversed during the year,
Werner said, according to the German newspaper. Share buybacks
are also dependent on how stock markets are performing, Boersen-
Zeitung cited Werner as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
