Representatives of the European
Commission, the  European Central Bank  and the  International
Monetary Fund , known as the troika, will focus on Greek banks’
writedown losses during a visit to  Athens  starting on Dec. 12,
 Kathimerini  reported, without saying where it got the
information.  The troika’s quarterly inspection will estimate the banks’
recapitalization needs, arising from writedowns of their Greek
sovereign debt holdings and an independent review of their loan
portfolios; then the banks can be recapitalized as soon as
 Greece  receives funds from a 130 billion-euro ($174 billion)
bailout agreed at an Oct. 26 European Union summit, the
newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
