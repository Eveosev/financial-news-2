European banking shares dropped, led
by Belgium’s  KBC Groep NV (KBC)  and France’s  Credit Agricole  SA, after
 Standard & Poor’s  said it may lower the credit ratings of 15
nations that use the euro.  KBC, Belgium’s biggest lender and insurer, fell as much as
8.9 percent and was down 6.2 percent to 10.60 euros at 11:16
a.m. in Brussels trading. Credit Agricole, France’s third-
largest  bank (ACA) , slid as much as 6.2 percent and traded down 3
percent at 4.91 euros in Paris. The 46-company Bloomberg Banks
and Financial Services Index declined 0.9 percent.  “Higher cost of borrowing is the real concern,” said
Julian Chillingworth, who helps manage 15 billion pounds ($23
billion) at Rathbone Brothers Plc in  London . “This creates
further strain on banks’ balance sheets.”  S&P put  Germany , France and 13 other euro-area nations
under watch for a downgrade yesterday, saying “continuing
disagreements among European policy makers on how to tackle”
the region’s debt crisis risk damaging their financial
stability. The move comes as European Union leaders plan to meet
Dec. 8-9 in Brussels to end a crisis that led to bailouts in
Greece, Ireland and Portugal and now threatens to engulf Italy.  Societe Generale (GLE)  SA, France’s second-largest bank, fell as
much as 5 percent and was down 2.1 percent at 19.73 euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
