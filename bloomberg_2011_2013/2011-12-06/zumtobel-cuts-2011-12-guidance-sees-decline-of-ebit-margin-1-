Zumtobel AG (ZAG)  fell the most in two
weeks after  Europe ’s biggest maker of industrial lighting cut
its revenue guidance for fiscal 2012, citing the deteriorating
economic environment.  Zumtobel fell 5.2 percent to 12.55 euros at the 5:30 p.m.
close of trading in Vienna, its biggest decline since Nov. 22.  “Against this backdrop, the Management Board can no longer
confirm the previous guidance for the 2011/12 financial year,
which called for an increase of approximately 10 percent in
Group revenues and an adjusted Ebit margin of slightly over 6.4
percent,” the Dornbirn, Austria-based company said in a
statement today.  The company now sees an “increase of substantially less
than 10 percent in revenues and a year-on-year decline in the
Ebit margin, in particular due to the Components Segment,”
Zumtobel said, adding that “in view of macroeconomic
developments and the related uncertainty over sales volumes and
capacity utilization, exact guidance on the expected Ebit margin
for the full year cannot be provided at the present time.”  Second-quarter net income fell 20 percent to 20.7 million
euros ($28 million) from 25.85 million euros a year earlier, hit
by “continuing growth investments and a weakness” in the
components segment, it said in its quarterly report today.  Zumtobel is mulling “adjustments” in the components unit,
Chief Executive Officer Harald Sommerer said in a telephone
interview today.  “We sill start with temporary cost reductions and won’t
switch to more sustainable ones until we also see that the
crisis is sustainable,” he said.  Zumtobel is betting on new products and aiming for LED
lighting to be responsible for a third of its revenues by fiscal
2015, Sommerer said, adding that LED was responsible for 12
percent of Zumtobel’s revenue in the six month ended Oct. 31.  To contact the reporter on this story:
