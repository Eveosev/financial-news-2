Tim Participacoes SA (TCSL4)  and  Tele Norte
Leste (TNLP3)  Participacoes SA gained more airwaves for wireless
services in a Brazilian government auction that raised 237.5
million reais ($132 million).  Tim, controlled by  Telecom Italia SpA (TIT) , acquired nine lots
of spectrum in the 1.8 gigahertz band for 109.3 million reais,
Brazil’s telecommunications regulator said today on its  website .
Tele Norte Leste, which operates under the Oi brand, spent 110.6
million reais for four lots in the same band. Both companies are
based in Rio de Janeiro.  The auction of airwaves left over from previous sales will
help carriers build more capacity as demand surges for mobile-
phone services such as Internet downloads, said Anatel, as the
regulator is known. Brazil had 232 million wireless
subscriptions at the end of October, up 19 percent from a year
earlier, according to government statistics.  America Movil SAB (AMX) , based in Mexico City, spent 14.5 million
reais for one lot in the 800 megahertz band, and Sercomtel SA
paid 3.03 million reais for a lot in the 1.8 gigahertz band,
Anatel said.  Tim is Brazil’s second-largest carrier after  Telefonica
Brasil SA. (TLPP3)   America Movil , controlled by billionaire Carlos Slim,
is third, followed by Oi. Sercomtel is sixth, according to
government statistics.  To contact the reporters on this story:
