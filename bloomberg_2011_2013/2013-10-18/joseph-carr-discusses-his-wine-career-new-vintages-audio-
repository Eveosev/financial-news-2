Joseph Carr, founder of Joseph Carr 
Wines, discusses how his failure to make it as a busboy in his 
first restaurant job led to a career as a sommelier, wine 
industry executive, and now a leading California wine producer. 
He also discusses some of his company's new vintages, and his 
involvement with this weekend's Martha's Vineyard Food and Wine 
Festival.  Carr talks with Bloomberg's  Kathleen Hays  and Vonnie 
Quinn on Bloomberg Radio's "The Hays Advantage."  (Source: Bloomberg)  Running time 11:53
