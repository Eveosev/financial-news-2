Ibovespa  futures  rose as higher
commodity prices boosted the outlook for Brazilian raw-material
exporters after data showed faster growth in China.  Homebuilder  MRV Engenharia e Participacoes SA (MRVE3)  may move
after saying third-quarter sales increased 35 percent from a
year earlier. Petrochemicals producer  Braskem SA (BRKM5)  may be active
after HSBC Holdings Plc raised its recommendation to the
equivalent of buy.  Ibovespa futures contracts expiring in December climbed 0.4
percent to 54,775 at 9:15 a.m. in Sao Paulo. The real
strengthened 0.1 percent to 2.1503 per  U.S. dollar . The Standard
& Poor’s GSCI index of 24 raw materials added 0.8 percent.
China’s third-quarter gross domestic product expanded 7.8
percent from a year earlier, the statistics bureau said, which
compared with 7.5 percent in the prior period.  In Brazil, consumer prices rose 0.48 percent in the month
through mid-October, according to the national statistics
agency. That was more than the forecasts of all 33 economists
 surveyed  by Bloomberg.  The Ibovespa entered a  bull market  Sept. 9 after rising 20
percent from this year’s low on July 3 through that day. The
gauge is still down 13 percent in dollar terms this year,
compared with a decline of 1.3 percent for the MSCI  Emerging
Markets  Index of 21 developing nations’ equities.  Trading volume of stocks in Sao Paulo yesterday was 7.74
billion reais, compared with a daily average of 7.61 billion
reais this year through Oct. 16, according to data compiled by
the exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
