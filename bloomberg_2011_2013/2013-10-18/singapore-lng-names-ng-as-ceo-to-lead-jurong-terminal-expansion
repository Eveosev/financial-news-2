Singapore LNG Corp., the operator of
the Southeast Asian country’s first liquefied natural gas
receiving and exporting terminal, appointed John Ng to succeed
Neil McGregor as chief executive officer from Dec. 1.  McGregor, who will become a non-executive director, is
being replaced in a planned succession, the company said in an
e-mailed statement today. Ng was previously the CEO of YTL
PowerSeraya Pte, an electricity retailer.  SLNG was formed in June 2009 by the Energy Market
Authority, Singapore’s energy regulator, to own and operate the
S$1.7 billion ($1.4 billion) terminal on Jurong Island. The
company will be led by a new CEO as it begins discussions with
contractors to expand the facility’s throughput capacity to 9
million metric tons a year.  An “expression of interest” has been issued to potential
contractors and a final  investment decision , including the
awarding of work, is expected to take place early in the second
quarter of 2014, according to the statement.  The LNG terminal started commercial operations in May with
an initial regasification capacity of 3.5 million tons a year.
This will increase to 6 million tons by the end of 2013 after a
third storage tank and additional facilities start up.  To contact the reporter on this story:
