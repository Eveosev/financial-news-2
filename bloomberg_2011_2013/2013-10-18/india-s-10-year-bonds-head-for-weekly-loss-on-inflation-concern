India ’s 10-year bonds posted their
first weekly loss in three on concern faster inflation will add
pressure on the central bank to raise interest rates.  Wholesale prices  climbed 6.46 percent from a year earlier
in September, the most in seven months, official data showed
Oct. 14.  Consumer prices  rose 9.84 percent, exceeding the 9.5
percent median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of economists, a
separate report showed.  Reserve Bank  of India Governor Raghuram
Rajan boosted the key repurchase rate by 25 basis points to 7.5
percent last month, the first increase since 2011, and has said
containing inflation is his top priority.  The yield on the 7.16 percent government notes due May 2023
rose six basis points, or 0.06 percentage point, this week to
8.55 percent in Mumbai, according to prices from the central
bank’s trading system. The rate has jumped 13 basis points from
a three-week low on Oct. 10. It slid five basis points today.  “The markets are certainly in for more rate hikes as the
central bank’s focus currently seems to be more on inflation
than growth,” K. Ramanathan, Mumbai-based chief investment
officer at ING Investment Management Pvt., said yesterday.  Living costs are rising faster even as the $1.8 trillion
economy grows at the  slowest pace  in a decade. Output at Indian
factories, utilities and mines rose 0.6 percent in August from a
year earlier, compared with a revised 2.75 percent increase the
previous month, official data showed on Oct. 11.  Ten-year notes fell in each of the last four months, the
longest run of losses since 2009, as the RBI raised  interest
rates  and curbed funding support to banks to stem a slide in the
rupee. The currency has rebounded to 61.265 per dollar from a
record low of 68.845 on Aug. 28, allowing the RBI to scale back
some of the measures. Rajan twice cut two rates at which the
central bank supplies cash to lenders in the past month.  The one-year interest-rate swap, a derivative contract used
to guard against fluctuations in funding costs, climbed five
basis points this week to 8.43 percent, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. It slumped in each of the past six weeks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
