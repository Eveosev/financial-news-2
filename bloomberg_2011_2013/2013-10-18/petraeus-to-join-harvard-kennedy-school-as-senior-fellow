David Petraeus, the retired four-star Army general who resigned last year as head of the CIA, has
been appointed a non-resident senior fellow at Harvard
University’s John F. Kennedy School of Government.  Petraeus will help lead a new project called “The Coming
North America Decades” at the school’s Belfer Center for
Science and International Affairs, the university said today in
a statement. The project will look at U.S. competitiveness in
light of policies related to technology, science and the economy
and will be connected to a related effort by the  Council on
Foreign Relations .  “We count ourselves fortunate to have David Petraeus
making a major intellectual investment,” Graham Allison, a
Harvard professor who runs the Belfer Center in Cambridge,
Massachusetts, said in the statement. “He has an inquiring
mind, strategic orientation, intellectual fearlessness, and
appreciation of the academy.”  Petraeus is known for advocating counterinsurgency
strategies in  Afghanistan  after the U.S. invaded the country
following the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, and in Iraq
after the U.S. invaded it in 2003, as well as leading the so-called troop surges in both countries. He resigned as director
of the CIA last year after he admitted to an extramarital affair
and was a visiting professor at the  City University  of New York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
