Japan’s  Topix index  swung between
gains and losses as real-estate companies and shippers advanced
while insurers and tiremakers retreated.  Mitsui Fudosan Co. (8801)  rose 1.4 percent after BNP Paribas SA
initiated coverage of the developer with a buy rating. Skymark
Airlines Inc. slid 2.3 percent after cutting its profit
forecast. Bridgestone Corp. paced declines among tiremakers
after saying it will close a domestic plant, citing a lack of
competitiveness.  The  Topix (TPX)  added 0.1 percent to 1,207.89 as of 9:38 a.m. in
Tokyo after falling as much as 0.2 percent. The measure is
headed for a 0.9 percent gain this week after rising 2.9 percent
last week. The Nikkei 225 Stock Average increased 0.1 percent to
14,599.91. The yen advanced 0.9 percent against the dollar
yesterday on signals the  Federal Reserve  may delay tapering of
asset buying after the government shutdown and debt impasse.  “While extending the Fed’s stimulus will increase the
investors’ risk tolerance, it also weighs on Japan as it leads
to a stronger yen,” said  Hideyuki Ishiguro , senior strategist
at Okasan Securities Co. in Tokyo. “Japanese shares are going
to lack direction.”  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index increased 0.2
percent. The measure rose to a record yesterday after President
 Barack Obama  signed a bill to fund the government through Jan.
15 and extend borrowing authority until Feb. 7. Investors will
now weigh the shutdown’s effects on  corporate earnings  and
economic growth as the impasse fueled bets the Fed will delay
reducing its $85 billion in monthly bond purchases.  The Topix traded at 1.26 times book value yesterday,
compared with 2.54 for the S&P 500 and 1.77 for the Stoxx Europe
600 Index. Volume on the Japanese gauge was 28 percent below its
30-day intraday average today. Its 30-day historic volatility
was at 16.11 yesterday, compared with its five-year median of
19.31.  To contact the reporter on this story:
