Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc. (CMG) , the
restaurant chain with the fastest-growing sales among its peers,
said third-quarter profit rose 15 percent as more advertising
boosted store traffic. The shares jumped the most in more than
six years.  Net income  climbed to $83.4 million, or $2.66 a share, from
$72.3 million, or $2.27, a year earlier, the Denver-based
company said in a statement yesterday. Analysts projected $2.78,
the average of 26  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  The chain is spending more on marketing and traditional
advertising, including a new campaign called Skillfully Made, to
help maintain  revenue  growth that was the fastest among
 restaurant chains  in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index last year.
Revenue is projected to increase 16 percent this year, slower
than the 20 percent increase in 2012, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  “The really good news here is that traffic accelerated,”
Peter Saleh, a New York-based analyst at Telsey Advisory Group,
said in an interview. “It was probably a lot of the
advertising; it was probably the catering initiative.”  Chipotle rose 16 percent to $509.74 at the close in  New
York  for the biggest gain since May 2, 2007. The shares have
 advanced  71 percent this year, while the S&P 500 Restaurants
Index has added 20 percent.  Sales at Chipotle restaurants open at least 13 months rose
6.2 percent in the quarter. Analysts estimated a 4.7 percent
gain, according to the average of 22 estimates from Consensus
Metrix. In the fourth-quarter, same-store sales will be
“similar or slightly better” than in the third quarter, Chief
Financial Officer John Hartung said during a conference call
with analysts yesterday.  Revenue Climbed  Comparable-store sales will rise at a “mid-single-digit”
percentage rate this year, Chipotle said. It previously
estimated same-store sales growth at a “low to mid-single
digit” rate.  Revenue climbed 18 percent to $826.9 million in the
quarter. Analysts estimated $820.3 million, on average.  The company’s price-to-earnings ratio was about 44 at the
close yesterday, the highest among North American restaurants,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Chipotle has become
more  valuable  to investors this year and trades at more than two
and a half times the S&P 500’s price-to-earnings multiple.  The chain is spending more money on billboard and radio
ads, Hartung said during a conference call in July. Chipotle’s
marketing costs will be about 1.6 percent of sales for 2013,
compared with 1.3 percent last year, he said.  Chipotle has recently introduced catering services and
started selling tofu in some of its locations to attract new
diners. The more-than-1,500-store burrito seller also has been
evaluating changing its standards to allow some beef treated
with antibiotics into its restaurants amid a supply shortage.  To contact the reporter on this story:
