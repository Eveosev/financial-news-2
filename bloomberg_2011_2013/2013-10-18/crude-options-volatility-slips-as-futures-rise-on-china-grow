Crude options volatility slid as
futures rose after economic growth accelerated in  China , the
world’s largest oil-importing nation.  Implied volatility for at-the-money December options, a
measure of expected futures swings and a key gauge of value,
slipped to 18.97 percent at 2:30 p.m. on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange , from 19.68 percent yesterday.  West Texas Intermediate crude for December delivery
advanced 24 cents to settle at $101.11 a barrel on the Nymex
after a report that China’s gross domestic product expanded 7.8
percent in the July-September period from a year earlier,
halting a two-quarter slowdown.  Puts, or bets that prices would fall, accounted for the top
six options traded today and 56 percent of electronic trading
volume.  The most active options were March $70 puts, which slipped
1 cent to 12 cents a barrel with 2,883 lots trading as of 2:33
p.m. January $80 puts fell 3 cents to 11 cents on volume of
2,776 lots.  In the previous session, calls accounted for 51 percent of
the 132,222 lots traded. December $100 puts were the most-active
options, with 6,102 contracts trading as they rose 37 cents to
$1.86 a barrel. December $110 calls fell 15 cents to 13 cents on
volume of 5,314 lots.  Open interest yesterday was highest for December $90 puts,
with 43,700 contracts. Next were December $80 puts with 41,977
lots and December $120 calls with 32,347.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on open-outcry volume, where the bulk of options activity occurs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
