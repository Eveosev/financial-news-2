The  California Public Employees’
Retirement System  said it will appeal a judge’s ruling that
found the city of San Bernardino eligible to remain in Chapter 9
bankruptcy.  Calpers said in a statement yesterday it will file its
appeal on the grounds that San Bernardino didn’t consider
alternatives to its bankruptcy filing, didn’t file for Chapter 9
in good faith and didn’t provide reliable financial information.  U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Meredith Jury in Riverside,
California, last month overruled the pension fund’s objection
and found in the city’s favor, saying it needs the “breathing
space” afforded by bankruptcy to renegotiate debts.  San Bernardino, located about 60 miles (97 kilometers) east
of Los Angeles, sought  bankruptcy protection  from creditors on
Aug. 1, 2012, blaming a fiscal emergency brought on by a $46
million budget shortfall. Since filing, the city has fought its
employee unions in an effort to cancel their contracts and quit
making certain payments to Calpers, the biggest U.S. pension
fund.  The case is In re San Bernardino, 12-bk-28006,  U.S.
Bankruptcy Court , Central District of California (Riverside).  To contact the reporter on this story:
