A challenge by four truckmakers
including  Daimler AG (DAI)  to an  Environmental Protection Agency  rule
allowing  Navistar International Corp. (NAV)  to continue producing
engines that didn’t comply with pollution standards by paying a
fine was thrown out by an appeals court  A new EPA rule eliminated the objectionable mechanism,
making the lawsuit moot, the U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington
ruled. The new EPA rule is the subject of a separate suit by
Daimler and its co-plaintiffs Detroit Diesel Corp., Mack Trucks
Inc. and  Volvo AB. (VOLVB)   While acknowledging that Navistar, based in Lisle,
 Illinois , no longer has EPA-issued certificates of conformity
that let it produce noncompliant engines, the other truckmakers
asked the court to declare the waivers invalid to bolster their
case that they suffered economic harm. The court declined.  “The prospect of such relief in an EPA enforcement action
or citizen suit by Daimler is unduly speculative,” Circuit
Judge Karen LeCraft Henderson wrote for a three-judge panel.  The case is Daimler Trucks North America LLC v. U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency, 12-1179, U.S. Court of Appeals,
District of Columbia ( Washington )>  To contact the reporter on this story:
