Palm oil gained for a second week on
speculation that rising exports from  Malaysia  may curb a build-up in stockpiles in the world’s second-largest producer.  The contract for delivery in January rose 0.1 percent to
close at 2,401 ringgit ($762) a metric ton on the Bursa Malaysia
Derivatives, near a five-week high of 2,409 ringgit on Oct. 16.
Futures climbed 0.9 percent this week. Palm for physical
delivery in November was at 2,400 ringgit, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  Shipments gained 12 percent to 799,853 tons in the first
half of this month, SGS (Malaysia) Sdn. said on Oct. 16.
Reserves dropped 32 percent to 1.78 million tons last month from
a record 2.63 million tons in December, data from the Malaysian
Palm Oil Board shows.  The rise in prices this week to the highest in more than
five weeks was helped by robust exports and receding
expectations of rising output, Gnanasekar Thiagarajan, a
director at Mumbai-based Commtrendz Risk Management Services
Pvt, wrote in a report today.  “It does look increasingly likely that the inventory will
not get anywhere near the 2.63 million tons, and will probably
peak at about 2 million tons to 2.1 million tons,” said Alvin Tai, an analyst at RHB Investment Bank Bhd. This is “something
the market can stomach very well.”  Soybeans for delivery in November gained 0.4 percent to
$12.98 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade, while soybean oil
for December climbed 0.8 percent to 41.45 cents a pound.  Refined palm oil for May delivery advanced 0.8 percent to
close at 6,020  yuan  ($988) a ton on the Dalian Commodity
Exchange and soybean oil for delivery in the same month ended
little changed at 7,168 yuan a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
