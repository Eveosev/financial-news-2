European Union carbon permits had
their biggest weekly gain since Sept. 6 after German  Chancellor
Angela Merkel  said she favored a proposal to reduce a surplus of
allowances.  EU permits for December fell 1 percent today to 5.13 euros
($7.02) a metric ton on  London ’s ICE Futures Europe exchange,
paring their weekly advance to 11 percent. They reached a two-week high of 5.50 euros a ton on Oct. 16.  Merkel said in a speech that she supports a proposal to
temporarily suspect sales of some carbon permits, known as
backloading, her most explicit backing yet for moves to address
an oversupply in the EU’s 53 billion-euro emissions trading
system. The support of Europe’s biggest economy may help break a
deadlock in EU talks on the glut fix.  “Merkel espousing backloading is good news for the ETS,”
Matteo Mazzoni, an analyst at Nomisma Energia srl in Bologna,
 Italy , said by e-mail yesterday. “It’s one of those comments
traders usually want to hear to bet on future moves.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
