Just when it seems HTC has stemmed its executive exodus, another senior figure departs the Taiwanese smartphone maker.  Lorain Wong joined HTC as vice president and head of global public relations, corporate and internal communications, this past June. She had for nearly a decade managed submarine cable provider Asia Global Crossing's marketing communications, rebranding the company to become Pacnet. Wong had previously worked for AT&T and "CBS Evening News."  Her foray into the smartphone business ended this week, Chief Marketing Officer Ben Ho, her direct manager, told Bloomberg News. She resigned for personal reasons and will remain as a consultant for three to four months, Ho said.   At least six senior executives have left HTC in the past 2 Â½ years, including its previous marketing chief John Wang and Chief Financial Officer Winston Yung. Wong becomes at least the third to depart the PR team in the past two years. She didn't answer calls to her mobile phone or HTC e-mail address today.  The resignation comes two weeks after she accompanied Chairwoman  Cher Wang  to the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in Bali. In a separate interview, Wang told Bloomberg that the  most challenging  time will come in the next few months as it refines its marketing message.
