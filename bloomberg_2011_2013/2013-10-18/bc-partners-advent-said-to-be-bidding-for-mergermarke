Four private-equity firms are in the
second round of bidding for Mergermarket Ltd.,  Pearson Plc (PSON) ’s
financial-information unit, according to four people with
knowledge of the matter.  Advent International Corp.,  BC Partners , Providence Equity
Partners Inc. and Warburg Pincus LLC have all been invited to
submit second-round bids as Pearson seeks as much as $500
million for the business, said the people, who asked not to be
identified because the talks are private.  Pearson, which appointed JPMorgan Chase & Co. to run the
auction, plans to complete the sale by the end of the year, one
person said. London-based Mergermarket was founded in 2000 to
offer financial news and information to clients including banks
and hedge funds, and was acquired by Pearson in 2006.  The London-based education company paid 101 million pounds
($167 million) for Mergermarket, which is currently part of its
FT Group, the publisher of the Financial Times newspaper.
Bloomberg LP, the owner of  Bloomberg News , competes with Pearson
in providing news and information to the financial-services
industry.  A Pearson spokesman declined to comment. Officials at
Advent International, BC Partners, Providence and  Warburg Pincus 
either declined to comment or didn’t immediately respond to
telephone requests seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
