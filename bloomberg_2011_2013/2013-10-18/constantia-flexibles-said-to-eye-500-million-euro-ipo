Constantia Flexibles Group GmbH, the
Austrian packaging maker owned by One Equity Partners LLC, may
raise about 500 million euros ($684 million) in a planned
initial public offering, according to one person with knowledge
of the sale.  A listing could come as early as December, two people said,
asking not to be identified because the talks are private. The
preferred exchange for the deal is  Frankfurt , and stock would
also trade in Vienna, they said. While the owners favor an IPO
for Vienna-based Constantia Flexibles, they would also consider
offers from industry buyers, they said.  JPMorgan Chase & Co.,  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  and Deutsche
Bank AG are managing the IPO, three people familiar with the
deal said in August. One Equity may sell 30 percent to 50
percent of the company in the transaction, Austrian daily
newspaper Die Presse reported today.  A spokeswoman for One Equity declined to comment on the
sale. A spokesman for the company didn’t immediately respond to
a call seeking comment.  Constantia Flexibles’ earnings before interest, tax,
depreciation and amortization, or Ebitda, rose 18 percent to 113
million euros in the first six months of this year as revenue
expanded. It said the outlook for the rest of 2013 was
“positive.”  IPOs on European exchanges have raised around $15 billion
this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, more than
twice the amount in the same period a year earlier.  To contact the reporters on this story:
