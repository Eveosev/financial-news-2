Heavy Louisiana Sweet crude
strengthened the most in more than three weeks as  China ’s growth
accelerated for the first time in three quarters, indicating
stronger demand for waterborne oils.  Heavy Louisiana Sweet’s premium to West Texas Intermediate
rose $1.30 to a premium of $2.10 a barrel at 4:03 p.m.,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It would be the largest
gain since Sept. 25.  Gulf crudes including Heavy Louisiana Sweet compete with
foreign oils priced against European benchmark Brent for space
in U.S. refineries. Brent’s premium over WTI rose as high as
$9.04 a barrel today, the highest intraday level since Oct. 14.  Gross domestic product  in China, the world’s largest oil-importing nation, rose 7.8 percent in the July-September period
from a year earlier, the National Bureau of Statistics said
today in Beijing. It’s the first time growth has accelerated in
three quarters.  The growth indicated higher demand for oils that can be
shipped to China. WTI in Cushing,  Oklahoma , is landlocked, and
U.S. crudes are largely prohibited from being exported.  Light Louisiana Sweet strengthened by 30 cents to a premium
of $1.80. Mars Blend, a medium-density, high-sulfur crude from
the  Gulf of Mexico , was unchanged at a discount of $4.35.  Crude from the Southern Green Canyon was unchanged at a
discount of $7.50. Poseidon crude rose 45 cents to $4.80 below
WTI.  To contact the reporter on this story:
