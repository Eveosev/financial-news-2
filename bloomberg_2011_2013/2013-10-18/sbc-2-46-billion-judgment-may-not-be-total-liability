As  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) , the biggest
European bank by market value, appeals the U.S. jury verdict
that produced a $2.46 billion judgment, additional liabilities
from the  securities fraud  case remain unresolved.  The money judgment, rendered Oct. 17 by U.S. District Judge
Ronald A. Guzman in  Chicago , doesn’t account for more than
25,000 still-pending claims exceeding $650 million, according to
a statement issued by trial-winning lawyers Michael Dowd and
Spencer Burkholz at San Diego-based Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd
LLP.  “Judge Guzman also ordered the defendants to pay post-judgment interest which will accrue during the defendant’s
appeal,” the lawyers said.  A Chicago federal jury in 2009 found executives at
Household International, now part of HSBC Finance Corp., misled
investors about its business practices.  The case was filed in 2002. That year the lender agreed to
pay $484 million in fines to settle claims lodged by more than a
dozen states that it deceived borrowers about their mortgages.  “We plan to appeal, and we believe we have a strong
argument,” HSBC spokesman Patrick Humphris said in an e-mailed
statement.  While the trial court jury had determined stockholder
losses from March 23, 2001, to Oct. 11, 2002, could be as much
as $23.94 a share, it made no lump-sum award, and the lender’s
liability remained open pending review of loss claims.  Dowd reported to Guzman in June that a claims examiner had
reviewed and approved claims worth almost $1.5 billion.  Earlier Order  The judge issued an order this month denying defense
requests to overturn the verdict or order a new trial and
directed entry of a judgment for more than $1.48 billion in
liability and $968 million in accrued pre-judgment interest.  Lawyers for both sides are due back before Guzman for a
status conference on Oct. 23.  Plaintiffs’ lawyers said Oct. 17 the judgment is the
biggest ever following a trial of securities fraud class-action
claims.  Household was acquired by London-based HSBC in March 2003
for $15.5 billion.  The case is Lawrence E. Jaffe Pension Plan v.  Household
International  Inc., 1:02-cv-05893, U.S. District Court, Northern
District of  Illinois  (Chicago).  To contact the reporter on this story:
