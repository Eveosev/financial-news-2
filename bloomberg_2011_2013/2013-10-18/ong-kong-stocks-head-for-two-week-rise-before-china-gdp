Hong Kong  stocks  rose, with the
benchmark index heading for a two-week advance, ahead of data
today expected to show  China ’s economic growth accelerated.
Shares also rose on speculation the Federal Reserve will
maintain stimulus in the wake of the U.S. budget showdown.  The  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  gained 0.7 percent to 23,260.03 as of
9:32 a.m. in Hong Kong, headed for an 0.2 percent advance this
week. The  Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI) , also known as the
H-share index, added 0.6 percent to 10,633.08.  The Hang Seng Index climbed 17 percent from this year’s low
in June through yesterday as economic data showed China’s growth
is stabilizing and after the Fed unexpectedly refrained from
cutting asset purchases. Hong Kong’s equity benchmark traded at
11 times estimated earnings yesterday, compared with 15.7 for
the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  China releases gross domestic product data today, with
economists predicting 7.8 percent expansion in the three months
through Sept. 30 from 7.5 percent in the previous quarter. Data
on industrial production and retail sales are also due.  Futures on the S&P 500 gained 0.2 percent. The U.S. equity
gauge yesterday climbed 0.7 percent after President  Barack Obama 
signed a bill ending the 16-day government shutdown and
extending the nation’s borrowing authority until Feb. 7. Shares
also rose on speculation the central bank’s reduction of
stimulus will be delayed.  Stimulus Outlook  BlackRock Inc. and Pacific Investment Management Co. say
the Fed will postpone tapering as a result of the debt-ceiling
debate. Policy makers in September said bond purchases this year
will be cut from a record $85 billion a month. The central bank
next meets Oct. 29-30.  Fed Bank of Chicago President Charles Evans, a consistent
advocate of pressing on with stimulus, said yesterday the
