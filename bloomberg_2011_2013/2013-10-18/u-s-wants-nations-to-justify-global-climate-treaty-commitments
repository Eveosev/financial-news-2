The U.S. said nations must be ready
to explain their emission-reduction pledges as it unveiled
proposals on how countries should conduct climate negotiations
before a global treaty in 2015.  “Each party will need to be prepared to justify their
commitment to the world,” the U.S. said in a submission
published on the  website  of the UN Framework Convention on
 Climate Change  in Bonn. Countries should submit draft pledges
early in 2015 so consultations can extend through that year.  Envoys from more than 190 nations are seeking to write a
treaty that would take effect in 2020, succeeding greenhouse gas
limits set out in the Kyoto Protocol climate agreement. The
UNFCCC, which oversees the talks, has asked nations to submit
their carbon-reduction targets and treaty proposals.  The U.S., the second-biggest emitter after  China , didn’t
ratify the 1997 Kyoto agreement that set pollution-reduction
targets for more than 30 developed countries. The 2015 deal is
designed to include all nations, including China and  Brazil ,
that don’t have Kyoto limits.  “We understand that there will be variation in type and
stringency of commitments among parties” to the convention, the
U.S. said in its submission.  President  Barack Obama ’s administration says it’s on track
to cut heat-trapping gases by a pledged 17 percent from 2005
levels in 2020. That’s about 5 percent lower than in 1990, the
international baseline, and compares with the 28-nation European
Union’s pledge for a 20 percent cut over the 30 years.  “Assuming submission of final commitments in late 2015,
the consultative process would need to begin relatively early in
2015, probably by around the end of the first quarter,” the
U.S. said in its submission. “We do not see an approach based
on formulas or involving categories of parties, particularly
categories designed 30 years before this agreement becomes
effective.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
