Indian (SENSEX)  stock-index futures gained
after the benchmark index fell the most in two weeks yesterday.  SGX CNX Nifty Index futures  for October delivery rose 0.6
percent to 6,108 at 10:02 a.m. in Singapore. The underlying CNX
 Nifty (NIFTY)  Index dropped 0.7 percent to 6,045.85 yesterday. The S&P
BSE Sensex fell 0.6 percent, the largest decline since Sept. 30.
The Bank of  New York  Mellon India ADR Index of U.S.-traded
shares rose 0.7 percent.  Profits at all five Sensex companies that have reported
earnings for the quarter ended Sept. 30 so far have beaten or
matched estimates. International investors were  net buyers  of
Indian stocks for a ninth straight day on Oct. 15, data from the
regulator showed yesterday, the longest series of purchases
since May.  “Fund flows have been strong, plus corporate results have
been better than expected,”  Arun Kejriwal , director at Kejriwal
Research & Investment Services Pvt. in Mumbai, said by phone
today. “What remains to be seen is how companies results in the
latter half of the earnings season play out.”  International investors bought a net $186 million of local
stocks on Oct. 15, extending this year’s inflow to $14.5
billion, data from the regulator show. That’s the second-largest
after Japan among 10 Asian markets tracked by Bloomberg.  Larsen & Toubro Ltd. (LT) , India’s largest engineering company,
may report today that its second-quarter profit dropped 22
percent to 8.93 billion rupees ($146 million), from 11.4 billion
rupees a year earlier, according to the median of 30 analysts in
a Bloomberg survey.  The Sensex has risen 5.1 percent this year and is  valued  at
14 times estimated 12-month profits, compared with the MSCI
Emerging Markets Index’s 10.8 times.  To contact the reporter on this story:
