Renaissance Capital’s Johannesburg-based Head of  Africa  Execution, Tony Marcia, has left the
Moscow-based investment bank, according to an internal memo sent
by the company to staff.  Marcia, who joined the company in 2010 after 20 years at
Merrill Lynch & Co., left the bank’s Johannesburg operation to
pursue other undisclosed opportunities, according to the memo
seen by  Bloomberg News .  “Tony joined the African team as head of African execution
in 2010 and has been a key driver in helping carry our African
business,” the bank’s Chief Executive Officer for Africa
Clifford Sacks said in the memo.  Sacks didn’t immediately respond to calls to his mobile
phone and office seeking comment. RenCap’s Russia-based
spokeswoman Lyudmila Bibina didn’t immediately respond to calls
and an e-mail seeking comment.  RenCap, as the bank is known, named Igor Vayn as sole CEO
earlier this month after John Hyman, who had shared the job,
decided to leave. The company has cut back expansion into
faster-growing  emerging markets  and has closed sales, trading
and research operations in Almaty, Kiev, Beijing,  Hong Kong .  It also shut some offices in Africa last year and sold
assets in African banks and farming, forestry and infrastructure
in Russia and countries that made up the former Soviet Union.  To contact the reporter on this story:
