Spanish defaults as a proportion of
total lending climbed to a record in August as companies and
consumers struggled to make loan payments in an economy with an
unemployment rate that’s still above 26 percent.  Non-performing loans  accounted for 12.1 percent of  lending 
in August, compared with 12 percent in July and 10.5 percent in
the same month a year earlier, the Bank of Spain said on its
website today. The stock of  bad loans  rose to 180.7 billion
euros ($247.2 billion) during the month as 2 billion euros of
lending turned sour.  Signs that Spain’s economy has stabilized after nine
successive quarters of contraction have eased borrowing costs
for the government and sparked a rally in banking stocks
including  Banco Popular Espanol SA (POP) , up more than 70 percent
since the end of June. As lenders shrink their balance sheets,
any sustained recovery will struggle to take hold, said Neil Smith, a banks analyst at Bankhaus Lampe in Bielefeld,  Germany .  “We may see false starts in this recovery, but for the
banks there is still a very long way to go,” Smith said in a
phone interview.  The International Monetary Fund predicts unemployment in
Spain won’t fall below 25 percent until 2018. Spain’s economy
may shrink 1.4 percent this year before growing 0.5 percent in
2014, according to the mean estimate in a Bloomberg survey of 43
economists.  To contact the reporters on this story:
