President Jeffrey Lacker said bankruptcy without government
support is “the first and most preferable option” in the event
of a failure by a big financial institution.  The stability of the financial system would be better
ensured should investors expect an orderly wind-down of failing
firms rather than government receivership and a taxpayer
bailout, Lacker said today in remarks prepared for a speech at a
Fed  conference  in Washington.  “The incentives of market participants will be much better
aligned with our public policy goal of a financial system that
effectively allocates capital and risks,” he said. “Large
financial firms will prefer to be less leveraged and less
reliant on short-term funding. Institutions and markets would,
accordingly, be more resilient in response to financial
stress.”  U.S. lawmakers and supervisors, including Fed officials,
have overhauled financial regulation to minimize the odds that
taxpayers will be called upon to rescue a financial institution
deemed too big to fail.  Lacker has called for lenders to hold more capital if they
own a brokerage, and has repeatedly said this year that the best
way to overcome the too-big-to-fail challenge is by drawing up
detailed plans for the wind-down of failing institutions.  The conference, sponsored by the Fed Board and the Richmond
reserve bank, addresses how to create orderly strategies and
planning for shutting down large financial firms on the brink of
failure.  To contact the reporter on this story:
