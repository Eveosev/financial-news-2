Chilean  swap rates  fell the most in
two years after the central bank unexpectedly cut the benchmark
interest rate yesterday, citing the prospects that the  Federal
Reserve  will keep U.S. borrowing costs low.  Two-year swap rates dropped 18 basis points, or 0.18
percentage point, to 4.41 percent at 11:10 a.m. in Santiago, the
lowest level on a closing basis since July 2012. The decline was
the biggest since October 2011. The peso slid 0.4 percent to
495.87 per dollar after rallying yesterday to a four-month high.  Chilean policy makers lowered the target lending rate by a
quarter-percentage point to 4.75 percent in the first reduction
since January 2012, pointing to prospects for slower inflation.
The Fed spurred demand for higher-yielding assets in  emerging
markets  when it said last month that it would maintain
$85 billion of monthly bond purchases to keep U.S. rates slow.  Chile ’s “central bank acted because of concern that
tapering will be delayed for a long time,” Sebastian Ide, the
head of rates trading at  Banco de Chile (CHILE)  in Santiago. “It’s this
concern about the rate differential.”  Traders are today pricing a  benchmark rate  of 4.5 percent
by February, Ide said. He expects the bank may cut borrowing
costs to as low as 4.25 percent.  The one-year break-even rate, a gauge of market inflation
projections, fell to 2.46 percent yesterday from 2.89 percent at
the end of August.  “Inflation has evolved below projections, remaining in the
lower part of the tolerance range, while market expectations
foresee a slower normalization towards 3 percent,” the central
bank said yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
