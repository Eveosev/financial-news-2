Panasonic Corp. (6752)  and Coronal
Management LLC bought 16.2 megawatts of California solar
projects from Macquarie Capital.  The nine projects in Tulare and Kings Counties in Central
California will provide enough power for about 14,500 homes
served by  Edison International (EIX)  once completed in 2014,
Panasonic’s Newark, New Jersey-based unit said today in a
statement.  The projects, which will be built by ImMODO Energy Services
Corp. and Panasonic Eco Solutions, bring Panasonic and Coronal’s
joint development to more than 30 megawatts during the past two
years. The two companies expect to have more than 100 megawatts
completed or in development by the end of 2014.  Jim Reilly, a spokesman for Panasonic, didn’t immediately
respond to an e-mail or call for comment. Terms of the deal
weren’t disclosed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
