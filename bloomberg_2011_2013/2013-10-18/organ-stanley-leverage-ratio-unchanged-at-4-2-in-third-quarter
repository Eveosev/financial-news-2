Morgan Stanley (MS) , owner of the world’s
largest brokerage, said its third-quarter  leverage ratio  was
unchanged at 4.2 percent, short of the minimum proposed by U.S.
regulators to ensure banks are able to absorb losses.  The company’s supplementary leverage ratio, a gauge of
capital to total assets, no longer includes a deduction for
clearing derivatives, and deposit growth cut the ratio 30 basis
points, Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat said on a conference
call with analysts today.  Morgan Stanley will exceed the requirement by 2015, Porat
said in an interview today. The New York-based company announced
in July it would buy back $500 million in stock, and Porat said
the firm’s plan to reach 5 percent by 2015 includes further
capital returns to shareholders.  To contact the reporter on this story:
