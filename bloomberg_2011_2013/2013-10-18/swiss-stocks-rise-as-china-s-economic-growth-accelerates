Swiss stocks  rose for a second day,
extending the biggest weekly rally in six weeks, as a report
showed growth in China, the world’s second-largest economy,
accelerated for the first time in three quarters.  Schindler Holding AG (SCHP)  climbed 4.3 percent after the elevator
maker said it plans to spend as much as 1.06 billion Swiss
francs ($1.18 billion) in a modified share buyback offer.  Sulzer
AG (SUN)  rebounded from its lowest price in almost a year as Berenberg
Bank recommended that investors buy the stock.  The  Swiss Market Index (SMI)  advanced 0.3 percent to 8,054.7 at
9:30 a.m. in Zurich. The gauge has risen 1.5 percent  this week 
as U.S. lawmakers reached an agreement to end the fiscal
impasses and avoid a government debt default. It has surged 18
percent so far in 2013 as central banks around the world pledged
to leave  interest rates  low for a prolonged period. The broader
Swiss Performance Index also gained 0.3 percent today.  The volume of shares changing hands in SMI-listed companies
was more than double the average of the last 30 days, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  China ’s  economy grew  7.8 percent in the three months
through September from a year earlier, the National Bureau of
Statistics said today in Beijing, matching the median estimate
in a Bloomberg News survey. The government has set an annual
growth target of 7.5 percent for this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
