NYSE Euronext (NYX)  canceled some options
trades tied to three of the most-watched U.S. equity indexes
after determining they were mistakes.  NYSE reviewed transactions executed between 4:12 p.m. and
4:15 p.m.  New York  time for contracts linked to the  Dow Jones
Industrial Average , Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and Russell 2000
Index as well as  Citigroup Inc. (C) , according to messages sent by
the exchange operator. Fewer than 150 trades were voided,
spokesman  Eric Ryan  said in an e-mail.  The nation’s stock and options markets are working toward
improving procedures and technology in response to breakdowns
that prompted U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman
Mary Jo White on Sept. 12 to demand they collaborate. Exchanges
are making progress toward that goal, CBOE Holdings Inc.
President and Chief Operating Officer Edward Provost said on
Oct. 4. His company owns the largest U.S. options market.  White met with exchange executives after a programming
error caused Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to send unintentional
stock options orders in the first minutes of trading on Aug. 20,
pushing prices on dozens of contracts to a dollar each,
according to a person briefed on the matter and data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Ryan said NYSE will continue to update customers on today’s
mistaken trades.  To contact the reporter on this story:
