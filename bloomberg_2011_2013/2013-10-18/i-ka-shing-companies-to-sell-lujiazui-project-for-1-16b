Billionaire  Li Ka-shing ’s Hutchison
Whampoa Ltd. and  Cheung Kong Holdings Ltd. (1)  will sell a project
in Shanghai’s Lujiazui financial district to buyers including
China Everbright Ltd. for $1.16 billion.  The companies will each sell a 50 percent stake in Extreme
Selection, the owner of the company developing the project at
Lujiazui Ring Road, Hutchison said in a statement to Hong Kong’s
exchange. HYZL Development Co. and HYZL Investment Co. will each
buy 47 percent, while Diamond Gate Group Ltd., a  China
Everbright Ltd. (165)  subsidiary, will take the remaining 6 percent,
according to an Everbright statement today.  Hutchison and Cheung Kong announced in October 2006 that
they would spend 1.74 billion yuan ($285 million) to develop
real estate in Lujiazui. Some 64 overseas companies had their
regional headquarters in the 31.8 square-kilometer district,
according to a government  website  for the area.  The Oriental Morning Post reported in August that  Cheung
Kong  planned to sell the Oriental Financial Center office
building, the only property with a Lujiazui address listed in
the company’s annual report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
