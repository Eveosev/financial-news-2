Banco do Brasil SA (BBAS3) ,  Latin America ’s
largest bank by assets, may have to resume contributing to
worker pensions after a six-year hiatus as inflation and falling
investment returns erode retiree-fund reserve levels.  Reserves in the lender’s pension fund, known as Previ, have
fallen to about 25 percent of projected payments, Previ
insurance director Marcel Barros said in an interview. Brazilian
law requires pension funds to keep reserves of at least 25
percent. In 2007, as an investment surplus swelled, Previ
allowed the bank to stop making contributions on behalf of
workers hired in 1997 or before, and special payouts were made
to the bank and pensioners starting in 2010.  There is a “big chance” that Previ will halt its special
payouts in early 2014 and that contributions will resume for the
pre-1998 workers, Barros said in a phone interview from  Rio de
Janeiro , where the fund is based. “We must obey the rules.”
Previ is managed by an independent board.  A press official for the Brasilia-based bank declined to
comment. Banco do Brasil shares  rose  2.1 percent to 28.35 reais
at the close in Sao Paulo.  Previ will know by December when the benefits will be cut,
according to Barros. The special payouts were scheduled to last
through 2014.  Previ’s special payouts since 2010 were based on an
inflation projection of 4.5 percent, Barros said.  Brazil ’s 12-month consumer inflation accelerated to 5.86 percent in
September from 5.28 percent a year earlier.  The fund has also suffered from a drop in stock dividends
from its holdings, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
