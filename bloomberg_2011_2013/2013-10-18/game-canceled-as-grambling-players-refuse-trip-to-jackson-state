The Grambling-Jackson State college
football game set for today was canceled because Grambling
players refused to get on buses scheduled to take them to the
contest in  Mississippi , Jackson State officials said.  Wesley Peterson, a spokesman for the Jackson State athletic
department, said yesterday in an e-mail that the game will not
be played as scheduled. Instead, the Tigers will play a
scrimmage game as part of homecoming events.  “This is an unfortunate situation for JSU fans, but it is
beyond our control,” said university President Carolyn Meyers
in a statement on the school’s website.  Players at Grambling, in the neighboring state of
Louisiana, also boycotted two practices this week. They have
said they are upset about cuts to the football team budget, a
result of state cuts in higher education.  Grambling coach Doug Williams was fired after two games and
interim coach George Ragsdale was removed from that position
this week after the Tigers fell to 0-7 this season.  Grambling athletic department officials did not immediately
respond to e-mails seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
