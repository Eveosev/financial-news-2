It's that time of year when pumpkins are carved, ghoulish costumes are worn and ghost stories are acceptable dinner conversation. In celebration of the mysterious, spooky and hair-raising, we've gathered homes for sale in some of America's most haunted cities. Don't worry: No ghost sightings have been reported in these houses ... at least not yet. Villisca, IA 107 W High St, Villisca, IA  3 bedrooms, 2 bath, 1,966 square feet  For sale: $85,000 Villisca, IA is haunted by an unsolved murder. In 1912, Josiah B. Moore, his wife and six children were bludgeoned to death in their beds, and there was never enough evidence to bring the murderer to trial. Now the  Ax Murder House  has been restored to its original condition and is open for tours or an overnight stay. If you'd rather not sleep under the same roof where an ax-wielding assailant roamed, however, a 3-bedroom home on a landscaped corner lot is available on West High Street. Weston, WV 333 N River Ave, Weston, WV   3 bedrooms, 2 baths, 2,180 square feet  For sale: $148,500  There's nothing like six fireplaces in a 1900s Victorian to set the scene for a good ghost story. This home is in the same town as the former Weston State Hospital, which housed thousands of people with mental illnesses before it closed in 1994. Now known as the  Trans-Allegheny Lunatic Asylum , the site is a nationally recognized landmark with a history of Civil War raids, a gold robbery and reminders of patients who died in its four walls. The Asylum also offers  ghost tours , with guests, staff and ghost hunters reporting "apparition sightings, unexplainable voices and sounds." Baltimore, MD 1703 Lancaster St, Baltimore, MD   2 bedrooms, 1.5 baths, 1,185 square feet  For sale: $259,999  According to Zillow's  mortgage calculator , you can own this 2-bedroom row house in Baltimore for $1,010 a month, assuming 20 percent down on a 30-year fixed mortgage. You can also lay claim to Fells Point, where the ghost of Edgar Allan Poe is believed to reside. Not convinced? Grab a drink at "The Horse" and find out  what locals have to say . New Orleans, LA 526 Dauphine St, New Orleans, LA 2 bedrooms, 2 baths, 1,489 square feet For sale: $510,000  A French Quarter condo is available on Dauphine Street, which is also home to The Sultan's Palace. The Sultan was a wealthy businessman who rented an estate in the 1800s and came to be known for his lifestyle of partying and holding women against their will. But the creepiest part of the story is how The Sultan died. Some say it was a pirate, while others say it was his brother vying for the sultanate. Either way The Sultan was reportedly buried alive while his family was hacked to pieces. Savannah, GA 510 E Saint Julian St, Savannah, GA  3 bedrooms, 3 baths, 2,863 square feet  For sale: $939,000  If a Savannah accent makes you want to come inside and stay awhile, you're not alone. In Georgia's oldest city, burial grounds have been covered up and built over, leading many to  believe  the town is ridden with ghosts of the past. With a history of Civil War-era skirmishes, Moon River Brewing Company has  reported  bottles being thrown across the room by an indescribable force. You can investigate the city's haunted history yourself from this 1797-built Savannah home. Three well-appointed bedrooms and a beautifully remodeled kitchen are selling points, though you may want to leave the lights on!
