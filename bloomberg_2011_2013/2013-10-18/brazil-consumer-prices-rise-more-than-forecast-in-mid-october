Brazil ’s  inflation  accelerated more
than economists forecast in the month through mid-October as the
central bank carries out the biggest rate-increase cycle among
major economies. Swap rates rose.  Consumer prices as measured by the IPCA-15  price index  rose
0.48 percent from Sept. 13 to Oct. 11, the national statistics
agency said in a report published on its website today. That was
the fastest since April and higher than every  forecast  from 33
economists surveyed by Bloomberg, whose median estimate was for
a 0.41 percent jump. Annual  inflation  of 5.75 percent was above
analysts’ prediction of 5.69 percent.  The central bank’s fight to rein in inflation has been
supported by the greatest currency appreciation of all major
economies since late August. Traders in the swaps market expect
further rate increases while the bank’s intervention program to
buoy the real may continue into next year.  Swap rates on the contract maturing in January 2015, the
most traded in  Sao Paulo  today, rose four basis points, or 0.04
percentage point, to 10.46 percent as of 9:07 a.m. local time.
The real strengthened 0.2 percent to 2.1482 per  U.S. dollar .  Central bank directors last week raised the Selic in their
fifth straight meeting by 50 basis points, or 0.5 percentage
point, to 9.5 percent, and have boosted the rate by 225 basis
points since April. Traders are betting on a fifth-straight
half-point increase at the next monetary policy meeting in
November.  Currency Swaps  The bank on Aug. 22 announced a $60 billion program of
currency swaps and credit line auctions to buoy the currency.
The real has strengthened 13.2 percent since then, more than any
other major currency tracked by Bloomberg. Policy makers may
extend the intervention program into 2014, bank President
Alexandre Tombini said in prepared remarks for a speech on Oct.
12.  Food and beverage prices rose 0.7 percent and had the
biggest impact on inflation in the month through mid-October.
Prices of household goods rose 0.97 percent. Policy makers
target 4.5 percent annual inflation, plus or minus two
percentage points.  Economists surveyed by the bank Oct. 11 forecast year-end
inflation of 5.81 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
