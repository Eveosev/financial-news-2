Amiad Water Systems Ltd. (AFS) , an Israeli
water-filtration producer whose shares trade in London, fell the
most in three years after warning of municipal and industrial
project delays amid a slowdown in the U.S. and  India .  “As a result, the company expects full-year 2013 revenue
to be in the range of $115 million to $120 million and net
profit to be in the range of $4 million to $6 million,” Amiad
said today in a trading statement. First-half revenue declined
almost 7 percent to $61.7 million due to European and U.S.
market conditions, it said last month.  The stock of the water-treatment company slid as much as 14
percent intraday, the most since June 2010, and traded at 281
pence at 2 p.m. in  London , its lowest in 18 months.  Last April the company reported revenue rose 12 percent to
$131.1 million from a year earlier, aided by contracts for
seawater reverse-osmosis and pre-filtration membrane protection
in oil and gas in  Australia . The AIM-listed company was founded
more than a half-century ago at an Israeli kibbutz.  To contact the reporter on this story:
