CBOE Holdings Inc. (CBOE) , which delayed
the expansion of VIX futures trading hours because of the U.S.
government shutdown, revealed the process will now take place on
Oct. 28 and Nov. 4.  Once both stages are complete, futures on the Chicago Board
Options Exchange Volatility Index, or VIX, will be available for
trading from 3 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. New York time every weekday,
with an additional session from 4:30 p.m. to 5:15 p.m. New York
time on Monday through Thursday. CBOE, the biggest U.S. options
exchange owner, announced the updated schedule on its  website 
today.  The two stages had been planned for Oct. 21 and Oct. 28
before the U.S. government shutdown, which ended this week,
caused the second delay of expanded VIX trading hours. A
software update to prepare for the shift caused a malfunction
that shut CBOEâ€™s main market for 3 1/2 hours in April, prompting
the first postponement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
