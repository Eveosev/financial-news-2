In Brazil, there is a tribe that doesn’t count. No, I don’t mean that they don’t matter; I mean  they don’t count: Those three terms equate to "a small size or amount," "a somewhat larger size or amount" and "a bunch." And if you show them a group of five or six objects, then ask them to replicate it from memory, they apparently have a very hard time. As the Slate article goes on to point out, citing research from anthropological linguist Caleb Everett published in Cognitive Science, this has implications: This makes me wonder if the function of math -- beyond the most rudimentary “a lot” or “a little” approximation -- isn’t to help us trade with strangers. Within forager bands, as within families, visual approximation probably suffices when you’re trying to ensure a reasonably fair division. But when you’re using barter, or money, more exact divisions become necessary. If you don’t trade much, and you have no interest in learning the languages of others, you have little need for exactitude.
