Investors pumped $8.9 billion into
money-market mutual funds yesterday, the first day of deposits
in more than two weeks, as an agreement by lawmakers in
 Washington  averted a government default.  Money funds that cater to institutions took in $11.1
billion, according to research firm Crane Data LLC in
Westborough,  Massachusetts , including $5.1 billion into funds
that almost exclusively buy Treasuries or other debt backed by
the U.S. government.  Republican Party leaders in Congress agreed Oct. 16 not to
block a measure to end a government shutdown and lift the
borrowing limit that Treasury officials said they would reach
the next day. The accord with President  Barack Obama  sets a Dec.
13 date for completing talks that opened yesterday on a broader
budget deal. It funds government operations through Jan. 15 and
suspends the debt limit through Feb. 7.  Yesterdayâ€™s net deposits were the first for U.S. money
funds since Oct. 1. Investors withdrew $61.9 billion this month
through Oct. 16, including $21.6 billion on Oct. 11, according
to Crane Data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
