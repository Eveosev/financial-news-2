BlackBerry Ltd. (BB) , the struggling
smartphone maker seeking a buyer, should be wary of any
transactions that would raise national-security concerns,
Canadian Prime Minister  Stephen Harper  said today.  Canada would examine those issues in any foreign bid for
Waterloo, Ontario-based BlackBerry that requires a review under
the nation’s takeover law, Harper said in an interview in
Brussels after he and European Commission President Jose Barroso
announced an agreement in principle on a trade deal.  BlackBerry is “a very important player in the IT sector
and the advanced information-technology and communications
sector,” he said. “So it would be very important that any
transactions involving BlackBerry in the future not lead to any
concerns about security in that particular area of the
economy.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
