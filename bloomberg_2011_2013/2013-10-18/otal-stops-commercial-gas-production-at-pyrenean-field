Total SA (FP) , Europe’s third-biggest oil
company, stopped commercial production of natural gas at the
Pyrenean Lacq field in southwestern France as resources ran dry,
according to an energy lobby group.  The oil producer halted output at the deposit this week,
Jacques Sallibartant, head of the Friends of Drillers group,
said by telephone. A company official declined to comment.  Total began operating the Lacq field in 1957. Its shutdown
comes as the company’s plans to explore for gas elsewhere in
France are thwarted by a ban on hydraulic fracturing. Paris-based Total had intended to hunt for shale gas at its Montelimar
permit in the south of the country to increase domestic output.  Natural gas meets about 15 percent of  France ’s energy
needs, with most coming from  Norway , the Netherlands, Algeria
and Russia, according to the French Energy Ministry’s  website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
