U.K. gilts rose with Treasuries,
gaining for a second day, on speculation the partial U.S.
government shutdown slowed economic growth and will prompt the
 Federal Reserve  to maintain its asset-buying stimulus program.  Benchmark 10-year gilt  yields  declined to the lowest in
more than a week after President  Barack Obama  yesterday signed a
measure that reopened federal services and extended the nation’s
borrowing authority until next year, averting a default. German
bunds also advanced today. The pound strengthened to the highest
in two weeks versus the dollar amid signs the U.K. economic
recovery is gathering momentum.  “The rally in gilts is correlated to the U.S. and
expectations of more bullish moves from here with tapering
perhaps being pushed back,” said Simon Peck, a U.K. rates
strategist at Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc in London.
“Domestic drivers have been relatively encouraging. Gilt
underperformance is going to continue in the medium term but it
could be a bouncy ride in the interim.”  The 10-year yield fell three basis points, or 0.03
percentage point, to 2.71 percent at 4:47 p.m.  London  time after
reaching 2.68 percent, the lowest level since Oct. 9. The 2.25
percent bond maturing in September 2023 rose 0.285, or 2.85
pounds per 1,000-pound ($1,619) face amount, to 96.015.  Data yesterday showed U.K. retail sales rose more than
analysts forecast last month, following an Oct. 16 report that
showed jobless claims fell in September by the most in 16 years.  The  Citigroup U.K. economic surprise index  was at 40.2
after rising to 40.9 yesterday, the most since Oct. 8. The
gauge, which shows whether data beat or fell short of
economists’ forecasts, dropped to 20.9 on Oct 14, the lowest
level since June 19.  Pound Gains  U.K. government bonds lost 3.2 percent this year through
yesterday, according to Bloomberg World Bond Indexes. Treasuries
dropped 2.2 percent and German securities declined 2 percent.  The pound rose 0.1 percent to $1.6187 after touching
$1.6225, the highest since Oct. 3. It climbed 1.3 percent
yesterday, the biggest gain since Sept. 18, and has risen 1.4
percent versus the U.S. currency this week, the most since the
period ended Sept. 13. Sterling was little changed at 84.60
pence per euro, having strengthened 0.4 percent this week.  “A move towards $1.64 could be on the cards for the
pound,” said  Valentin Marinov , head of Group-of-10 currency
strategy at Citigroup Inc. in London. “The primary reason for
short-term optimism could be renewed improvement in U.K. data.
The jobs and retail sales data is producing a nice uptick in the
economic surprise index.”  The pound appreciated 5.1 percent in the past six months,
the best performer among 10 developed-nation currencies tracked
by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The euro strengthened
4 percent, while the dollar weakened 1.4 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
