New York Rangers captain  Ryan Callahan  will miss three to four weeks of the National Hockey
League season after breaking his thumb in a 2-0 win against the
Washington Capitals two days ago.  Callahan scored against the Capitals, taking his season
tally to three goals in five games. He has a team-best two
power-play goals.  Callahan, 28, missed the preseason and the first game of
the regular season after undergoing surgery in May to repair a
torn labrum. The Rangers are playing without right wing Rick Nash, who is sidelined indefinitely with a concussion, and left
wing Carl Hagelin, who is recovering from the same offseason
surgery as Callahan and isn’t eligible to play until Oct. 29.  Callahan will miss tomorrow’s visit to the New Jersey
Devils as well as road games against the Philadelphia Flyers,
 Detroit Red Wings  and New York Islanders this month. The Rangers
face the Montreal Canadiens in their home opener Oct. 28 and the
Buffalo Sabres three days later.  In November, Callahan is likely to sit out games against
the Carolina Hurricanes,  Anaheim Ducks , Pittsburgh Penguins and
Columbus Blue Jackets. He may also have to miss matchups with
the  Florida Panthers  and the Devils.  To contact the reporter on this story:
