Chinese equities rose to the highest
level in two years in  New York , led by Internet companies  Baidu
Inc. (BIDU)  and Qihoo 360 Technology Ltd., as economic growth
accelerated for the first time in three quarters.  The Bloomberg China-US Equity Index of the most-traded
Chinese stocks in the U.S. advanced 1.7 percent to 107.13, the
highest close since September 2011. The gauge gained 2.3 percent
for the week. Baidu, owner of the nation’s largest search
engine, rose to the highest on record, while  software developer 
Qihoo climbed 8.1 percent. Real-estate broker  E-House China
Holdings Ltd. (EJ)  jumped to a one-month high as a government report
showed home sales surged in September from a month earlier.  Gross domestic product  rose 7.8 percent in the July-September period from a year earlier, the fastest expansion
since December, the National Bureau of Statistics said.
Companies on the China-US gauge will report an  average  35
percent increase in profit during the third quarter, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “Bearishness toward the Chinese economy” is fading,
Michael Ding, lead manager of the  China Region Fund (USCOX)  at U.S.
Global Investors, which oversees $2.2 billion, said by phone
from  San Antonio , Texas yesterday. “The economy is robust
enough to make the transition to consumption-led growth from
investment-led growth. Internet stocks are related to
consumption, which is supported by disposable income.”  Earnings Results  The iShares China Large-Cap  ETF (FXI) , the largest Chinese
exchange-traded fund in the U.S., advanced 0.1 percent to $38.15
in New York, trimming its weekly slump to 0.6 percent. The
Chicago Board Options Exchange China ETF Volatility Index,
measuring predictions of price fluctuations in the ETF, declined
5.4 percent to 21.46.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index added 0.7 percent to a
record 1,744.5. It gained 2.4 percent on the week as earnings
results from Google Inc. and General Electric Co. topped
estimates and as speculation grew that the  Federal Reserve  will
maintain its rate of asset purchases after Congress ended the
standoff over the  federal budget  and borrowing authority.  Companies on the China-US gauge are poised to report
average earnings of $2.14 a share during the third quarter, from
$1.58 in the year-ago period, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Baidu surged 7.9 percent to $165.91 yesterday, the highest
price since its 2005 debut. Trading volume for American
depositary receipts of the Beijing-based company was 87 percent
higher than the daily overage over the past 90 days. ADRs of
 Qihoo (QIHU) , operator of China’s second-largest search engine, climbed
to a record $94.67.  Home Sales  Google Inc., the world’s largest search-engine company,
reached $1,000 for the first time yesterday amid optimism about
new advertising for wireless devices and online video. The
stock, sold at $85 in a 2004 initial public offering, jumped 14
percent to $1,011.41 after the company reported third-quarter
sales and profit that beat estimates on Oct. 17.  E-House, based in Shanghai, added 4.9 percent to $9.88 as
trading volume rose to 88 percent above the three-month average.  China’s home sales jumped 34 percent in September as
authorities refrained from adding to property curbs, emboldening
buyers. The government in March stepped up a three-year campaign
to cool the housing market by ordering the central bank to raise
down-payment requirements for second mortgages in cities with
excessive cost gains. Some Chinese cities are facing increasing
pressure to meet the annual home-price targets they set earlier
this year, and to cap gains at the growth rate of local
disposable incomes.  Melco Jumps  Melco Crown Entertainment Ltd. (MPEL) , which operates gambling
facilities in Macau, surged 5 percent to $36.51, a record high.  Sands China Ltd. (1928) , the Macau casino operator controlled by
billionaire  Sheldon Adelson , reported on Oct. 17 that adjusted
property earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization increased 62 percent to $785.3 million in the third
quarter, beating analyst estimates, as its new resort drew more
gamblers.  The Shanghai Composite Index of domestic bourse rose 0.2
percent to 2,193.78, trimming a weekly drop of 1.5 percent. The
 Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  advanced 0.7 percent to
10,644.04, ending the week with a 0.6 percent increase.  To contact the reporter on this story:
