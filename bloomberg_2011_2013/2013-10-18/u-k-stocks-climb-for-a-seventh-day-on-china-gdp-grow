U.K. stocks  rose for a seventh day,
their longest rally since May, as a report showed that  China’s
economy  accelerated for the first time in three quarters.  Prudential Plc (PRU) , which generated 32 percent of its operating
income from Asia last year, climbed to its highest price since
at least 1988.  William Hill (WMH)  Plc lost 3.2 percent after JPMorgan
Chase & Co. lowered its rating on the bookmaker.  Anglo American
Plc (AAL)  declined 1.4 percent after saying that production at its
 Kumba (KIO)  Iron Ore Ltd. unit fell.  The  FTSE 100 Index (UKX)  added 46.42 points, or 0.7 percent, to
6,622.58 at the close in London. The equity benchmark has
advanced 2.1 percent this week as President  Barack Obama  signed
into law a measure extending the U.S. government’s borrowing
authority until early 2014 and ending a government shutdown that
started Oct. 1. The broader FTSE All-Share Index also rose 0.8
percent today, while Ireland’s ISEQ Index climbed 0.9 percent.  “The economic data coming in is reasonably strong,”
Michael Ingram, a market strategist at BGC Partners LP in
London, said by telephone. “The Chinese data indicates a broad-based acceleration across the economy.”  In China,  gross domestic product  increased 7.8 percent in
the third quarter from a year earlier, the National Bureau of
Statistics said. That matched the median estimate of economists
in a Bloomberg survey. The world’s second-biggest economy posted
growth of 7.7 percent and 7.5 percent in the first two quarters
as it slowed from a 7.9 percent expansion in the final three
months of 2012.  Prudential Climbs  Prudential rose 4.1 percent to 1,264 pence. Asia’s
contribution to the operating income of the U.K.’s  biggest
insurer  by market value increased in 2011 and 2012.  Reckitt Benckiser Group Plc (RB/)  climbed 3.4 percent to 4,502
pence, as makers of household goods climbed on the Stoxx Europe
600 Index.  William Hill lost 3.2 percent to 403.5 pence. JPMorgan
lowered its recommendation to underweight from overweight,
meaning that investors should reduce their holdings in the
operator of more than 2,300 betting shops. The brokerage said
increasing competition may cause analysts to lower their
forecasts for the company’s profit in 2014. JPMorgan also
lowered its price target to 400 pence from 550 pence.  Anglo American  Anglo American declined 1.4 percent to 1,532 pence. Kumba,
which is 70 percent owned by the mining company, said third-quarter iron-ore production at Sishen in South Africa decreased
24 percent to 9.5 million tons from a year earlier.  Computacenter Plc (CCC)  slipped 4.5 percent to 543 pence, its
biggest drop since June. UBS AG lowered the technology-services
provider to neutral from buy, citing its valuation. The shares
have climbed to 13.18 times estimated earnings from 11.81 times
at the end of last year, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  In the U.S., Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago President
 Charles Evans  said late yesterday that the central bank should
not begin reducing the pace of its $85 billion of monthly asset
purchases because the government stopped publishing the data
used to gauge the economy’s health during the shutdown.  Narayana Kocherlakota, president of the Minneapolis Fed,
said in a separate speech that policy makers should leave
 interest rates  at a record low to reduce  unemployment  even at
the risk of temporarily pushing inflation above the central
bank’s 2 percent target.  To contact the reporter on this story:
