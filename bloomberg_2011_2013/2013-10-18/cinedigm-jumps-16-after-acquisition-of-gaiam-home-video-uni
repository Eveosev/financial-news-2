Cinedigm Corp. (CIDM) , a Los Angeles-based
film distributor, jumped 16 percent after announcing the
acquisition of a film and television library yesterday.  The company is purchasing the home-entertainment division
of  Gaiam Inc. (GAIA)  for $51.5 million. The deal is expected to add
more than $15 million in annual earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization, Cinedigm said in a statement.  “It’s one of those rare acquisitions that works on every
level,” Cinedigm Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Chris McGurk said in a telephone interview. “We’re seeing the street
react to that.” Gaiam has “distribution rights to a huge
library, the WWE in DVD and digital, the NFL, Discovery
Networks. It’s real high-quality content that really adds to our
library.”  The combined business will have more than 32,000 film
titles and television episodes in its library and $320 million
in annual retail sales, according to the statement.  Cinedigm will finance the purchase through a combination of
borrowings and the sale of as much as $13 million in new shares.  The stock rose 24 cents to $1.77 at the  New York  close. The
shares are up 26 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
