U.S.  stocks  rose, giving the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index its best weekly gain since July, as
results from Google Inc. topped estimates and speculation grew
that the  Federal Reserve  will delay cutting monetary stimulus.  Google rallied 14 percent to surpass $1,000 a share for the
first time after reporting third-quarter sales that beat
analysts’ projections.  General Electric Co. (GE)  added 3.5 percent as
demand for industrial products boosted earnings.  Chipotle
Mexican Grill Inc. (CMG)  surged 16 percent to a record as customer
traffic rose. UnitedHealth Group Inc. slumped 3.7 percent,
extending yesterday’s 5.1 percent slide after the insurer
reported sales that fell short of analyst estimates.  The S&P 500 added 0.7 percent to 1,744.50 at 4 p.m. in  New
York , extending an all-time high. The gauge has rallied 2.4 in
the past five days, for its biggest weekly advance since July
12. The  Dow Jones Industrial Average  added 28 points, or 0.2
percent, to 15,399.65. About 6.6 billion shares changed hands on
U.S. exchanges, 12 percent higher the three-month average.  “People are looking at earnings but they’re also looking
at what they think is going to happen next,” Sarah Hunt, an
associate fund manager and analyst who helps oversee $4.5
billion at Purchase, New York-based Alpine Woods Capital
Investors LLC,said in a phone interview. “After this political
problem no one is expecting this to happen again in January.
People are just looking for a little bit of a better economic
backdrop to continue what’s been a pretty decent environment for
stocks.”  Taper Estimates  The  S&P 500  closed yesterday at a record of 1,733.15 after
Congress ended the standoff over the  federal budget  and
borrowing authority. The 16-day government shutdown government
reduced growth by 0.3 percentage point this quarter, economists
said in a Bloomberg News survey.  The slower growth and delayed reporting of economic data
will prevent Fed policy makers from paring the monthly pace of
asset buying until their March 18-19 meeting, according to the
median of 40 responses by economists in the survey conducted
yesterday and today. Economists had expected the central bank to
reduce purchases to $80 billion last month, according to a
Bloomberg survey before the September meeting.  The Fed stimulus has helped propel the  S&P 500 (SPX)  up by more
than 150 percent from its March 2009 low. The gauge has surged
22 percent this year and jumped to its previous intraday record
of 1,729.86 on Sept. 19, a day after the central bank
unexpectedly delayed tapering.  Data Delay  Investors will have to wait until Oct. 21 to get the next
snapshot of economic activity, when data on sales of existing
homes is released. The September U.S. jobs report, originally
scheduled to be released on Oct. 4, will be issued on Oct. 22.
The report was delayed by the partial shutdown. October
employment data will come out on Nov. 8, rather than Nov. 1.  A report today from  China  showed the world’s second-largest
economy grew by 7.8 percent in the July-September period,
accelerating for the first time in three quarters, as Premier  Li
Keqiang  spurred factory output and investment.  Industrial
production (CHVAIOY)  advanced in September by 10.2 percent as predicted by
economists.  “The numbers out of China are supporting markets today
after recent disappointing data,” Plassard said. “While
sentiment is still positive, the rally may be short-lived as the
debt-ceiling issue will come back to haunt us again soon.”  In the absence of U.S. economic reports, investors have
been watching third-quarter corporate earnings. Thirteen S&P 500
companies  released  results for the period today. Analysts have
raised their forecasts for profits and now forecast an average
increase of 2.5 percent for all companies in the gauge,
according to estimates compiled by Bloomberg today. That
compares with an expected gain of 1.4 percent as of Oct. 11.  Earnings Scorecard  Earnings at the 100 companies that have reported so far
grew by an average of 4.4 percent, while sales gained 2 percent.
Some 70 percent of the companies have topped analysts’ profit
estimates, while 56 percent have beaten on sales.  Gains in the S&P 500 have averaged 1.1 percent in the first
four weeks of earnings seasons since 2003, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. That’s about twice the usual four-week
gain in the index.  “My concern would be on a very short term basis that some
companies are going to use the drama of the past couple of weeks
as a pretext to lower the bar,”  Matthew Kaufler , a portfolio
manager at Federated Investors Inc. in Rochester, New York, said
by phone. His firm oversees $363.8 billion. “Even if there is
some weakness to forward guidance, I think that’s going to get
shrugged off and we’re going to finish the year pretty strong.”  Volatility Sinks  The Chicago Board Options Exchange  Volatility Index (VIX) , the
gauge of S&P 500 options prices known as the VIX, sank 3.3
percent to 13.04 today, the lowest since August 14. The gauge
plunged 17 percent in the past five days for the biggest weekly
decline since March.  Nine out of 10 main industries in S&P 500 advanced, with
technology and industrial companies rising at least 1.1 percent
to pace gains.  Google surged 14 percent to a record $1,011.41. The owner
of the world’s biggest search engine said  revenue , excluding
sales passed on to partner sites, of $11.92 billion exceeded the
average analyst as the number of promotions sold via mobile,
video and other services made up for shrinking advertising
prices.  Google’s rally helped the Nasdaq 100 Index gain 3.7 this
week, for its highest close since Oct. 23, 2000.  GE, Morgan Stanley  General Electric added 3.5 percent to $25.55 for the
biggest gain in the Dow. The company’s earnings beat analysts’
estimates as industrial sales climbed, led by demand for  jet
engines  and drilling equipment, and rising orders pushed its
backlog to a record.  Morgan Stanley advanced 2.6 percent to $29.69. Earnings
beat analysts’ estimates as equity-trading revenue jumped the
most among the biggest Wall Street firms and the wealth-management profit margin climbed.  Chipotle Mexican Grill surged 16 percent, the most since
May 2007, to a record $509.74. The chain is spending more on
marketing and traditional advertising to help maintain revenue
growth that was the fastest among  restaurant chains  in the S&P
500 last year.  Amazon.com Inc. rallied 5.8 percent to $328.93 to close at
a record. UBS AG analyst Eric Sheridan raised his rating on the
stock to buy from hold, saying he expects revenue growth to
accelerate in the fourth quarter.  Oil Services  Schlumberger Ltd. (SLB)  gained 2.8 percent to $93.99 as the
world’s largest oilfield-services provider said quarterly  net
income  climbed to $1.7 billion, or $1.29 a share, from $1.4
billion, or $1.07, a year earlier.  Baker Hughes Inc. gained 7.3 percent to $55.55 as the oil
services provider reported third-quarter profit that beat
analyst estimates and said it expects “solid, profitable”
international growth in 2014.  UnitedHealth dropped 3.7 percent to $68.76, a three-month
low. Shares in the largest U.S. health insurer yesterday fell
the most in more than two years after the company reported
worse-than-forecast results.  Home Depot Inc. slid 1.4 percent to $74.69 and Lowe’s Cos.
sank 2.8 percent to $47.66. Cleveland Research analyst Eric
Bosshard cut his estimates for both retailers’ third-quarter
same-store sales growth, citing moderating demand.  Intuitive Surgical Inc. (ISRG)  slumped 5.7 percent to $376.52. The
maker of surgical robots said third-quarter  net income  declined
to $156.8 million, or $3.99 a share, from $183.3 million, or
$4.46, a year earlier. Revenue dropped 7.2 percent to $499
million. That fell short of the average estimate of $525.9
million from 18 analysts compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
