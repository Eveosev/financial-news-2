Copper rose, heading for the first
advance in three weeks, as Chinese economic data may show a
recovery in the world’s biggest metals user.  Copper for delivery in three months on the London Metal
Exchange increased 0.2 percent to $7,247.25 a metric ton at 9:23
a.m. in  Shanghai . The metal gained 0.6 percent this week.  China may report today that economic expansion rebounded to
7.8 percent in the third quarter on year, according to the
median estimate of 48 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News,
after the pace slowed in the two previous quarters. The National
Bureau of Statistics will release data at 10 a.m. in Beijing.  “Trading is slow this morning as investors are waiting for
cues from the economic data, which should support sentiment,”
said Fang Junfeng, an analyst with Shanghai CIFCO Futures Co.  Copper for delivery in January advanced 0.4 percent to
52,020  yuan  ($8,529) a ton on the Shanghai Futures Exchange.
Metal for delivery in December was little changed at $3.2955 a
pound on the Comex in  New York .  On the LME, aluminum rose, while nickel, lead and zinc were
little changed.  To contact  Bloomberg News  staff for this story:
