Parque Arauco SA (PARAUCO) , a Chilean
shopping-mall developer, headed for its biggest weekly gain in
two months after Banco Santander SA named it a top pick because
of growing consumer demand and an attractive valuation.  Parque Arauco’s shares have climbed 3.2 percent this week,
the most since the week ended Aug. 9. Today they rose 1.2
percent to 987 pesos at 12:21 p.m. in Santiago. Chile’s
benchmark IPSA index gained 0.6 percent.  Santander increased its estimate for this year’s private-consumption growth in Chile to 6.3 percent from 5.2 percent,
according to an e-mailed note to clients dated today. Parque
Arauco’s plan to sell 115 billion pesos ($230 million) in new
shares sent the stock price tumbling by 9.1 percent from Sept.
26 to Oct. 1 and turned it into an attractive investment,
according to Rodrigo Ordonez, an analyst at Santander.  “At this price, and considering that they will surely use
the capital increase for growth plans, we like the stock,” he
said in a phone interview from Santiago.  Parque Arauco, based in Santiago, is  Chile ’s third-largest
shopping-mall developer and operator. The largest are  Cencosud
SA (CENCOSUD)  and Plaza SA, a unit of  SACI Falabella. (FALAB)   To contact the reporter on this story:
