Zenith Bank Plc (ZENITHBA) ,  Nigeria ’s third-largest lender, rose to the highest level in four months as its
valuation made it more attractive to investors, according to
Renaissance Capital.  The lender gained 2 percent to 22.06 naira in Lagos, the
commercial capital, the highest since June 12. About 110 million
shares traded, or 5.7 times the three-month daily average.  The stock is trading at a price-to-book value of 1.5 times,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That is “cheap
compared to its peers in the Nigerian banking industry and
emerging  market banks,” Adesoji Solanke, a Lagos-based banking
analyst at Renaissance Capital, said by phone. “We rate the
stock a buy, at a target of 25.30 naira.”  Nigeria’s largest lender,  Guaranty Trust Bank Plc (GUARANTY) , has a
price-to-book value of 2.7 times. Zenith looks attractive even
as  Renaissance Capital  reduced its full-year 2013 estimated
profit by 7 percent to 91 billion naira ($569 million), Solanke
said.  Zenith Bank said on Aug. 15 first-half net income was
little changed at 45.4 billion naira, compared with 42.4 billion
naira a year earlier, as the central bank ordered a reduction in
fees changed by lenders. Revenue rose 13 percent to 171 billion
naira.  The  Central Bank of Nigeria  told banks in sub-Saharan
Africa’s second-biggest economy to lower fees and commissions
starting April 1 to minimize conflict with clients. The cash
reserve requirement for federal, state and local government
deposits was raised to 50 percent from 12 percent, the regulator
said July 23.  Bigger banks like Zenith are more likely to withstand tight
market conditions owing to the size of the balance sheet,
Renaissance Capital said yesterday.  Zenith Bank’s shares have risen 13 percent this year
compared with a 20 percent increase for the Nigerian SE Banking
Index, which tracks the 10 largest banks in  Africa ’s biggest oil
producer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
