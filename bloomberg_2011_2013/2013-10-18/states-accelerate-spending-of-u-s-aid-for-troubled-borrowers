States experiencing the worst home-price  declines  and unemployment are speeding up their spending
of $7.6 billion in U.S. aid under a three-year-old program
designed to help their residents, the Treasury Department said.  The  District of Columbia  and 18 states including Florida
and  Michigan  have spent about $1.7 billion of the money in the
Hardest Hit Fund, part of the Troubled Asset Relief Program. The
states had spent only $511 million a year ago.  It took a while to set up aid programs, which range from
loan modifications for troubled borrowers to blight removal in
neighborhoods swamped by foreclosures, Treasury Assistant
Treasury Secretary Timothy Massad said today.  “It does take some time for people to create the
administrative structures and the controls,” Massad said in a
telephone interview. “We did start to see the money going out
the door fairly quickly, and now we’re seeing it accelerate
because states have fine-tuned their programs.”  States including California and  Arizona  have used the money
to provide aid unavailable under other federal programs,
including reducing the balance on loans backed by  Fannie Mae  and
 Freddie Mac . The regulator of the two government-controlled
mortgage-finance companies has barred such principal reductions
otherwise.  Hardest Hit Funds aided 126,858 homeowners through June 30,
Treasury said in the first of a series of quarterly  reports  on
the program.  To contact the reporter on this story:
