TPG China Media LP will buy  Twenty-First Century Fox Inc. (FOXA) ’s remaining 12.15 percent stake in China-focused broadcaster  Phoenix Satellite Television Holdings Ltd. (2008) 
for HK$1.66 billion ($214 million).  TPG will buy 607 million shares at HK$2.73 each from Fox
unit Star Entertainment Holdings Ltd., Hong Kong-based Phoenix
said in a filing to that city’s stock exchange yesterday. On
completion, Fox, controlled by  Rupert Murdoch , will no longer
hold a stake in Phoenix and its directors will resign, Fox and
TPG said in an e-mailed press release yesterday.  Star Entertainment sold 264 million shares, a 5.3 percent
stake, at HK$2.72 each in March, Phoenix said at the time.
Murdoch had owned a stake in the broadcaster since before the
company first sold shares to the public in 2000.  To contact the reporter on this story:
