Vivint Inc., the home security and
solar-energy provider acquired last year by  Blackstone Group LP (BX) ,
raised $540 million from two unidentified financial institutions
to build home power systems.  The funding is in addition to $200 million in tax-equity
financing announced in August, the Provo, Utah-based company
said in a statement today.  The funding includes $40 million in tax-equity financing
and the rest is “non-specific residential solar financing,”
Kady Cooper, a Vivint spokeswoman, said today by e-mail.  Some developers don’t have enough taxable income to use all
the tax credits related to renewable-energy projects, and sell
equity stakes to large backers that apply a portion of the
credit to their own tax bills, an arrangement called tax-equity
financing.  Blackstone bought Vivint in December for $2 billion. The
company designs, installs and maintains solar systems in
California, Hawaii, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey,  New
York  and Washington, D.C.  To contact the reporter on this story:
