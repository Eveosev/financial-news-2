Abengoa SA (ABG) , a Spanish clean-energy
developer, expects water projects to generate 20 percent of its
U.S. revenue within two years, up from a “very small” share
now, according to Chief Executive Officer Manuel Sanchez Ortega.  The Seville-based company forecasts most of the growth to
come from desalination, with the water-treatment business next-most important, he said today in an interview in New York.  The U.S. is Abengoa’s largest market, generating 1.03
billion euros ($1.4 billion) in revenue in the first half of the
year, about 30 percent of total sales, according to an August
 presentation . It created a unit in January to oversee its U.S.
operations.  “We have been working on a lot of new opportunities” in
water, he said. “We have invested a lot in the technology.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
