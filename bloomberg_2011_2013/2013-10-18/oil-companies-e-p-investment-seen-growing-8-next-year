Investment by oil and gas companies
in exploration and production may rise as much as 8 percent next
year as they seek to add reserves and expand output from  Norway 
to  Australia , the IFP Energies Nouvelles policy group said.  Spending may climb to $750 billion in 2014 from an
estimated $694 billion this year, the Rueil-Malmaison, France-based  IFP  said today in a report. Since the start of this year,
177 oil and gas discoveries have been made, it said.  Companies are stepping up the search for oil after prices
gained on rising demand. The quarterly average price for Brent
crude, an international benchmark, has remained above $100 a
barrel since the start of 2011, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. That’s in part countered by an increase in expenses.  Exploration and production investment “will continue to
grow but at a slower pace,” IFP President Olivier Appert told
reporters in Paris. “There is some tension in oil services due
to higher costs.”  IFP expects the market for seismic equipment and oilfield
surveys to grow at about 8 percent next year compared with an
estimated 12 percent in 2013. Investment in refining will be
about $71 billion compared with $70 billion this year, with
overcapacity projected to rise to 4 million barrels a day by
2020 from about 2.6 million barrels a day this year.  A “strong increase” in refinery upgrades in the Americas
and eastern Europe is fueling investment, as well as new
projects in Asia, in contrast to western Europe and  Africa ,
according to the think-tank.  To contact the reporter on this story:
