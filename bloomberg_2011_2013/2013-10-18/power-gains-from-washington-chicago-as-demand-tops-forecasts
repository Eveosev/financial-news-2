Spot wholesale electricity gained
from  Washington  to  Chicago  as demand topped forecasts on the
largest U.S. grid while Northeast markets slid on mild weather.  Prices reversed earlier losses on the 13-state PJM
Interconnection LLC network as demand climbed to 85,670
megawatts at 2:20 p.m., 4 percent above the day-ahead outlook,
according to its website. Power consumption was coming in below
forecasts in New England.  The high temperature in Washington today may be 72 degrees
Fahrenheit (22 Celsius), 4 above normal, while  Boston  may be 9
higher than average at 70 degrees, according to AccuWeather Inc.
in State College, Pennsylvania.  Spot prices at PJM’s benchmark Western hub, which includes
Washington rose $6.41, or 16 percent, to average $47.03 a
megawatt-hour during the hour ended at 2 p.m. from the same time
yesterday, grid data compiled by Bloomberg showed.  New York  City power dropped $19.20, or 41 percent, to
$28.10 a megawatt-hour, while Boston dropped $14.26, or 31
percent, to $31.74.  The premium of New York City spot on-peak power versus
Boston widened to $25.32 from yesterday’s average of $4.49. New
York power traded 95 cents above costs in the Hudson Valley, up
from 17 cents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
