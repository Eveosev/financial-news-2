Natural gas futures rose in New York
for the first time in three days as the outlook for unusually
cold weather heading into November signaled increased demand for
the heating fuel.  Gas reversed earlier losses to gain 0.2 percent as midday
government models showed a cold push in the eastern half of the
U.S., with below-normal temperatures forecast from Oct. 23
through Nov. 1, according to Commodity Weather Group LLC.
Government reports next week may show above-average  stockpile
gains  for the first half of October, when the weather was mild.  “The back half of October looks a little chilly and if you
extrapolate that into November, it’s a more bullish outlook,”
said  Kyle Cooper , director of research with IAF Advisors in
Houston. “I was shocked by the weakness in light of the weather
forecast. People don’t know how much supply is going to grow.”  Natural gas for November delivery rose 0.7 cent to settle
at $3.764 per million British thermal units on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange  after sliding to $3.685, the lowest intraday
price since Oct. 10. Trading volume was 4.3 percent above the
100-day average at 2:44 p.m. Gas fell 0.3 percent this week,
capping the third decline in four weeks, and has risen 12
percent this year.  The discount of November to December futures expanded for
the first time in seven days, widening 0.4 cent to 13.3 cents.
November gas traded 22.1 cents  below  the January contract,
compared with 21.7 cents yesterday.  Gas Options  January $5.50 calls were the most active options in
electronic trading. They were unchanged at 0.7 cent per million
Btu on volume of 2,273 at 3:27 p.m. Calls accounted for 60
percent of trading volume. Implied volatility for November at-the-money options was 32.96 percent at 3:15 p.m., compared with
31.33 percent yesterday.  A surge of cold air next week “will be the strongest of
the season so far, with sub-freezing low temperatures in the
Midwest,”  Matt Rogers , president of Commodity Weather Group in
Bethesda,  Maryland , said in a note to clients today.  Midday forecasts showed cooler changes to central states
next week with the possibility of “massive polar air masses”
driving into parts of the Deep South, Midwest and East 11 to 15
days from now, Rogers said.  The low temperature in  Chicago  on Oct. 25 will drop to 28
degrees Fahrenheit (minus 2 Celsius), 15 below normal,
AccuWeather Inc. said on its website.  Boston ’s low will be 33
degrees, 11 lower than average. About 49 percent of U.S.
households use gas for heating while 39 percent use electricity,
according to the Energy Information Administration, the
statistical arm of the Energy Department.  Winter Strip  Gas for the winter months, November through March, rose 0.7
cent to an average $3.917 per million Btu as of 3:31 p.m.,
according to Bloomberg fair-value prices.  “Investors want to keep the winter strip below $4 until we
start to see winter heating demand,” said Teri Viswanath,
director of commodities strategy at BNP Paribas SA in  New York .
“Considering the last few inventory reports surprised to the
upside, there is a chance that next week’s inventory reports
will show ample supplies on the market.”  The EIA said it will release two inventory reports next
week. Data for the week ended Oct. 11, which was delayed from
yesterday because of the government shutdown, will be issued
Oct. 22 at 10:30 a.m. Data for this week will be released on
Oct. 24 as the normal schedule is resumed.  Stockpile Estimates  U.S. inventories  probably rose 77 billion cubic feet last
week, based on the median of 17  analyst estimates  compiled by
Bloomberg. The five-year average gain for the period is 75
billion. Cooper said his early estimate for next week’s second
inventory report is an increase of another 80 billion cubic
feet, which would top the five-year average of 67 billion.  Gas stockpiles  totaled 3.577 trillion cubic feet in the
week ended Oct. 4, 1.6 percent above the five-year average for
the week, data show from the EIA. Supply gains topped the
averages in the three most recent reports.  The number of  rigs drilling  for gas rose by 3 this week to
372, according to Baker Hughes Inc. The rig count is down 14
percent this year.  Marketed gas output in the U.S. will average 70 billion
cubic feet a day in 2013, up 1.2 percent from a record 69.18
billion last year, the EIA said in its Oct. 8 monthly Short-Term
Energy Outlook.  The U.S. produced 87 percent of its own energy in the first
six months of this year, on pace to be the highest annual rate
since 1986, EIA data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
