The 38th  Marine Corps Marathon , the
world’s largest race without prize money, will be run Oct. 27 as
scheduled now that the U.S. government shutdown has ended.  “Runners, we are on,” director Rick Nealis said in a
video on the marathon’s website.  Nealis last night informed the 30,000 runners that the
26.2-mile (42.2-kilometer) race through downtown Washington will
take place. The director had said the shutdown was threatening
cancellation of the event.  The marathon, the fourth-largest U.S. race and ninth in the
world, sold out in two hours, 27 minutes in March.  Last year, 889 runners out of 23,519 finishers in the
Marine Corps Marathon qualified for the Boston Marathon, the
only mass participation race that requires qualifying times.  To contact the reporter on this story:
