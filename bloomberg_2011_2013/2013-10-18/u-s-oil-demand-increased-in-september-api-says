U.S. petroleum demand rose in
September from a year earlier as the economy grew, the  American
Petroleum Institute  said.  Total petroleum deliveries, a measure of demand, gained 2.7
percent to 18.6 million barrels a day, the API said in a report.
Third-quarter demand was 1.7 percent higher than 2012, the
industry-funded group said. U.S. manufacturing picked up last
month, according to the  Institute for Supply Management .  “Demand for petroleum products remains consistent with a
gradually improving economy,”  John Felmy , chief economist at
the API, said in a statement.  Gasoline deliveries increased 2.1 percent from a year
earlier to 8.74 million barrels a day, the API said. Demand for
distillate fuels rose 3.8 percent to 3.82 million.  Jet fuel use gained 1.5 percent from a year earlier to 1.4
million barrels a day. Demand for all other oils, a category
that includes liquefied petroleum gas, climbed 5.8 percent to
4.42 million barrels a day.  September’s crude production jumped 19 percent to 7.78
million barrels a day, the highest level for the month in 25
years. Output in the lower 48 states gained 16 percent to 7.24
million and Alaska rose 6.6 percent to 535,000.  For the third quarter, total oil consumption was 18.9
million barrels a day and gasoline demand was 8.95 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
