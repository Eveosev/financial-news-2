Treasury 10-year note yields touched
the lowest level in 12 weeks amid speculation the partial U.S.
government shutdown this month curbed growth and will spur the
Federal Reserve to keep buying bonds into next year.  Benchmark notes had the first gain in three weeks after
lawmakers ended the 16-day closure and avoided a default. Bills
due Nov. 21 dropped to negative levels for the first time in
more than two weeks. U.S. government securities are the most
expensive in almost three months, based on the 10-year  term
premium . The U.S. is scheduled to release September’s payrolls
report on Oct. 22.  “The economic numbers don’t warrant tapering at this
point,” said Thomas di Galoma, head of U.S. rates sales at ED&F
Man Capital Markets in New York. “They may turn softer because
of what’s taken place in  Washington  over the last month.”  The U.S. 10-year  yield  dropped one basis point or 0.01
percentage point to 2.58 percent at 5 p.m. in New York after
dropping to 2.54 percent, the lowest level since July 24,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The 2.5 percent note
maturing in August 2023 rose 3/32, or 94 cents per $1,000 face
value, to 99 10/32. The yield dropped 11 basis points on the
week.  Yields on  30-year bonds  dropped two basis points to 3.64
percent after touching 3.62 percent, the lowest since Aug. 12.  The rate on $55 billion in bills maturing Nov. 21 dropped
to negative 0.005 percent, the lowest level since Oct. 2. It
touched 0.21 percent on Oct. 11, the highest level since
issuance in May.  Volume, Volatility  Treasury trading  volume  at ICAP Plc, the largest inter-dealer broker of U.S. government debt, dropped 33 percent to
$249 billion, from $373 billion yesterday. The average this year
is $316 billion.  Volatility in Treasuries as measured by the Bank of America
Merrill Lynch MOVE index was at 72.46 today, up from 70.09
yesterday, the lowest level since May 24. It climbed on Sept. 5
to 114.2, the highest level in two months. It touched a record
low 49 on May 9.  The  term premium , a model that includes expectations for
interest rates, growth and inflation, fell to 0.21 percent, the
lowest level since July 22. The gauge has declined from this
year’s high of 0.63 percent set Sept. 5, signaling the cheapest
levels of 2013. A positive reading indicates investors are
getting yields that are above what is considered fair value.  Investment Losses  Treasuries have lost investors 2.2 percent this year,
according to  Bloomberg US Treasury Bond Index. (BUSY)  The Bloomberg
Global Developed  Sovereign Bond Index (BGSV)  has lost investors 2.7
percent in 2013.  The seven-day  relative strength  index for the Treasury 10-year note yield was at 32 today, down from 40 yesterday and 67
on Oct. 15, according to Bloomberg data. A reading lower than 30
or above 70 suggests the security may be poised for a change in
direction.  The standoff over U.S. fiscal policy that shut the
government “encouraged our enemies” and slowed economic
growth, President  Barack Obama  said yesterday. Speaking at the
White House after federal agencies opened for the first time
since Oct. 1, Obama said the U.S. suffers because of repeated
fiscal brinkmanship.  In September, most Fed policy makers said the central bank
would probably reduce bond purchases -- used to support the
economy by putting downward pressure on borrowing costs -- this
year from the current pace of $85 billion a month. The central
bank purchased $1.56 billion in Treasuries maturing from
February 2036 to February 2043 today as part of the program.  High ‘Anxiety’  Economists now expect the Fed to delay the first cut to its
bond-buying program until March, according to the median
estimate of 40 economists in a Bloomberg News survey. In a Sept.
18-19 survey, economists said the central bank would first
reduce the purchases in December.  “There’s no reason for them to embark on tapering at a
rushed pace,” said  Sean Simko , who oversees $8 billion at  SEI
Investments Co. (SEIC)  in Oaks,  Pennsylvania . “You have the anxiety of
waiting for economic releases. Over the next month, the 10-year
yield will trade between 2.50 and 2.75 percent.”  Fed Bank of  Chicago  President Charles Evans, an outspoken
advocate who has voted for Fed stimulus, said in Chicago today
that the Fed keeps encountering problems it didn’t foresee. He
said yesterday the central bank should postpone tapering after
the shutdown stopped the flow of economic reports.  Even Dallas Fed President Richard Fisher, who has called
for reducing asset purchases, told reporters yesterday fiscal
discord has undermined the argument for tapering.  Slowed Growth  The government suspension shaved at least 0.6 percent from
U.S. fourth-quarter gross-domestic-product growth, Standard &
Poor’s said this week in a report. The economy expanded 2.5
percent in the second quarter, the Commerce Department said on
Sept 26.  The shutdown will probably slow fourth-quarter GDP by 0.3
percentage point, according to the median estimate of 40
economists in a Bloomberg News survey conducted Oct. 17 to 18.  The rate on $93 billion of bills maturing on Oct. 24 was at
0.01 percent after touching zero yesterday, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. It was as high as 0.68 percent on Oct.
16, before the agreement to lift the borrowing ceiling, and was
negative as recently as Sept. 27.  One-month rates were at 0.005 percent after surging to 0.45
percent Oct. 16, the highest level since October 2008. Even at
the height of concern about a default, yields remained lower
than historical levels, with one-month  rates  averaging 1.5
percent in the past decade.  The rally wasn’t enough to lift Treasuries from among the
worst-performing bond markets. U.S. government securities due in
a decade and more have fallen 8.8 percent this year, based on
indexes compiled by the European Federation of Financial
Analysts Societies and Bloomberg. Only similar-maturity
securities from Switzerland and Sweden fell more among the 144
EFFAS indexes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
