The U.S. Treasury Department asked
bond dealers to assess the impact of the recent debt-limit
impasse on the Treasury bill and financing markets.  The Treasury, in a statement today, also asked dealers to
comment on whether smaller, more frequent auctions of five-year
TIPS would be beneficial to the market.  The survey is for Oct. 31-Nov. 1 meetings between Treasury
officials and bond dealers in advance of the government’s
quarterly auctions of notes and bonds. The government’s next
refunding announcement is scheduled for Nov. 6.  Congress and Obama administration clashed this month over
government funding and a health-care law, putting the U.S. less
than 24 hours from running out of borrowing authority. The
agreement reached Oct. 16 funds the government through Jan. 15
and suspends the debt limit through Feb. 7.  To contact the reporter on this story:
