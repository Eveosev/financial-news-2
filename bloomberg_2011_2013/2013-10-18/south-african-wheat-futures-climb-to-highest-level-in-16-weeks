Wheat futures traded in South  Africa 
rose to a 16-week high and yellow corn advanced for an eighth
session in nine.  Wheat for delivery in December gained 0.4 percent to 3,475
rand ($355) a metric ton by the close on the South African
Futures Exchange in Johannesburg. That was the highest
settlement since June 26 for a most-active contract.  South Africa, a net importer of wheat, is sub-Saharan
Africa’s largest producer of the grain after Ethiopia and the
region’s biggest buyer after Nigeria and  Sudan , according to
U.S. Department of Agriculture data.  Yellow corn for delivery in December climbed 0.1 percent to
2,185 rand a ton and the white variety for the same delivery
month rose 0.4 percent to 2,376 rand a ton.  South Africa  is the continent’s biggest corn producer. A
meal made from white corn is a staple food in the nation and the
yellow variety is mostly fed to animals.  To contact the reporter on this story:
