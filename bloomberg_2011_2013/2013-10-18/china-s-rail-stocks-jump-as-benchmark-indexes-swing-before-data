China’s stocks  rose for the first
time in four days, led by consumer discretionary and industrial
companies, after the nation’s economic growth accelerated in the
third quarter.  Apparel maker  Youngor Group Co. (600177)  and BYD Co., the automaker
part-owned by  Warren Buffett ’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc., jumped
more than 7 percent to lead gains for consumer companies reliant
on growth. CSR Corp. and China CNR Corp., the largest train
makers, advanced at least 1.7 percent after Premier Li Keqiang
said he hopes China can help  Australia  as it studies building
its first high-speed railway. Inner Mongolia MengDian HuaNeng
Thermal Power Co. slid 3.5 percent to pace losses for utilities.  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  added 0.2 percent to 2,193.78
at the close. The nation’s economy expanded 7.8 percent in the
third quarter, government data showed today, matching the median
forecast of 48 economists compiled by Bloomberg. That compared
with growth of 7.5 percent in the previous quarter.  “The data suggest the economy is stabilizing and it’s a
big probability that the government’s annual growth target of
7.5 percent will be met this year,” said Wang Zheng, the
Shanghai-based chief investment officer at Jingxi Investment
Management Co., which oversees $120 million. “It’s positive for
stocks.”  The  Shanghai  gauge slid 1.5 percent this week, the first
weekly loss this month. The CSI 300 Index climbed 0.5 percent
today to 2,426.05, while the  Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI) 
rose 0.4 percent. The Bloomberg China-US Equity Index added 0.7
percent in New York yesterday.  Growth Outlook  The Shanghai index has risen 13 percent from its four-year
low on June 27, boosted by speculation the city’s new free-trade
zone will attract foreign companies and allow for financial
liberalization. The index trades at 8.7 times projected earnings
for the next 12 months, compared with the seven-year average of
15.4, according to  data  compiled by Bloomberg.  China’s economic growth accelerated for the first time in
three quarters, as Premier Li spurred factory output and
investment to meet the government’s expansion goal for 2013.  “Everything is picking up,” Stephen Green, head of
Greater  China  research at Standard Chartered Plc, said in an
interview in Shanghai today. “The economy isn’t going to
accelerate a lot in the fourth quarter, but continue to grow.”  Industrial production rose 10.2 percent in September from a
year earlier, the National Bureau of Statistics said. That
compared with the 10.2 percent median forecast of 48 economists
and a 10.4 percent gain in August.  Rail Stocks  Fixed-asset investment excluding rural households increased
20.2 percent in the January-to-September period from a year
earlier. Retail sales in September climbed 13.3 percent from a
year earlier after a 13.4 percent increase in August.  A measure of  consumer-discretionary stocks  in the CSI 300
gained 1.3 percent, the second most among the 10 industry
groups. Youngor surged by the 10 percent daily limit to 9.22
 yuan  after saying it paid 340 million yuan ($55.8 million) for a
4.04 percent stake in UnionPay Merchants Service Co.  BYD jumped 7.7 percent to 40.75 yuan. Shanghai will make a
“big push” into alternative energy cars, Wu Qizhou, the deputy
head of Shanghai’s municipal environmental protection bureau,
said at a briefing today.  CSR gained 1.7 percent to 4.19 yuan. China CNR advanced 3.2
percent to 4.55 yuan. China hopes to cooperate with Australia on
high-speed railway, Premier Li said after meeting Quentin Bryce,
Australia’s Governor-General, in Beijing, China Central
Television reported.  Stocks Outlook  A sub-index of utility stocks in the CSI 300 fell 0.5
percent for the steepest loss among industry groups. Inner
Mongolia Mengdian fell 3.5 percent to 3.61 yuan.  Hubei Energy
Group Co. (000883)  lost 3.2 percent to 5.59 yuan.  Chinese stocks may see some profit-taking before next
month’s Communist Party meeting, the results of an audit on
local governments’ debt and weaker economic data for October,
analysts led by Helen Zhu at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., wrote in
a report dated today.  Equities may be “subdued” or post “slightly negative”
returns near term unless there are positive surprises from
reforms or global demand, the analysts wrote.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
