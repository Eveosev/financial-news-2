The cost of insuring corporate bonds
against non-payment in  Japan  decreased, according to traders of
credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index fell 1.5 basis points to 85
basis points as of 9:06 a.m. in  Tokyo , according to Citigroup
Inc. prices. The measure is headed for its eighth consecutive
decline, the longest falling streak since March 12, according to
data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan was little changed at 132 basis points
as of 8:50 a.m. in  Singapore , Australia & New Zealand Banking
Group Ltd. prices show. The gauge is on track for a 24.4 basis-point drop this month, the most since June 2012, according to
CMA, which is owned by McGraw-Hill Cos. and compiles prices
quoted by dealers in the private market.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index was also little changed
at 106 basis points as of 11:50 a.m. in Sydney, ANZ prices show.
The benchmark is set for a 19.2 basis-point decline this month
and a nine basis-point fall this week, CMA data show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
