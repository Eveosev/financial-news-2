Happy Friday afternoon, Viewfinders. And have a great weekend. Now on with the links. Something is  missing  in this story about the Fed Sometimes I flag stories because they are informative. Others I highlight because they are odd, such as today’s Page 1 article in the Financial Times about when the Federal Reserve might begin tapering its asset purchases. The headline in this morning’s print edition says: “Shutdown will not deter Fed from eyeing December taper.” The funny part about the article is that the writers don’t explain how they know this. All they say is that the Fed “could” start to taper in December. Of course it could. So? Or maybe the  taper  will start in March? A Bloomberg News survey of economists points to the Fed’s March 18-19 meeting as the likely point for starting to taper. But they’re guessing, too. Back in the days when Alan Greenspan was running the Fed, he used to love seeing dueling headlines in newspapers with diametrically opposite interpretations of what he had told Congress the day before. Maybe in spite of all the central bank’s jabbering about improving communications, the Fed still likes it this way. Complacency  is back, and the speculative-bond market shows it Good piece in the Economist today about investors’ appetite for junk bonds: “Some observers think that the risks of high-yield bonds are being systematically underestimated. The spreads paid by high-yield issuers are low relative to the historical average, although they are more than sufficient to compensate investors given the low level of defaults. If central banks start raising interest rates to deal with a resurgence of inflation, or if the global economy slips back into recession, junk-bond investors may suffer a nasty shock. But for the moment they are enjoying the ride.” The  history  of Twitter from doodle to IPO Business Insider proves once again it’s very good at long-form journalism when it wants to be. I won’t spoil anything for you. Just make sure you have a good chunk of time set aside before sitting down to read this. It’s worth it. Free  grenades  for all the kiddies Did you know that during the early part of the 20th century after World War I the post office had a program to distribute hand grenades that had been converted into children’s savings banks? From the Liberty Street Economics blog at the New York Fed: “The children were loaned these hand grenade banks during their vacations in order to contribute to the War Savings Stamps effort. If a child saved enough money to buy a stamp, he or she was allowed to keep the grenade bank.” Good times. (Jonathan Weil is a Bloomberg View columnist.  Follow  him on Twitter.)
