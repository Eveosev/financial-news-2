Japan ’s government has put off key
labor market deregulation, as Prime Minister Shinzo Abe faces
resistance to a core part of his growth strategy to revive the
world’s third-biggest economy.  Fixed-term employment contracts may be extended to 10 years
from the previous five within special economic zones under
proposed new regulations, the Nikkei newspaper reported today.
Other changes, including lifting restrictions on working hours
for white-collar workers, will not go ahead, according to the
Nikkei.  Freeing up the labor market is crucial to the “third
arrow” of Abe’s so-called Abenomics policies to shake up
industry and lay a foundation for sustained growth. Relaxing
employment rules in certain areas or for some companies would be
“unacceptable,” the head of the Japanese Trade Union
Confederation Nobuaki Koga said yesterday after a meeting with
politicians and business leaders.  Investors will lose confidence in Japan’s economic revival
unless Abe adds substance to his growth strategy and relies less
on stimulus measures, Hideo Hayakawa, who previously served as
 executive director  at the  Bank of Japan , said in an interview in
 Tokyo  this week.  Business leaders had called for changes to labor
regulations to ease hiring and firing in what is still partially
a lifetime employment system in Japan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
