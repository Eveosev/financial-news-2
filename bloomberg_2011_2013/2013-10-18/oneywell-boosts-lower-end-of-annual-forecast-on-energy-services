Honeywell International Inc. (HON)  reduced
its full-year sales forecast amid lower demand for its defense
products and sees “continued slow growth” in 2014.  Sales this year at Honeywell, which makes products ranging
from home thermostats to aircraft instruments, will be a maximum
of $39 billion, down from a previous forecast of as much as
$39.3 billion. The average of 19 analysts estimates compiled by
Bloomberg was $39.2 billion.  Chief Executive Officer David Cote said revenue in the
third quarter was lower than expected, hurt by an 11 percent
drop in defense and space sales. The company is anticipating
budget declines at the U.S. Department of Defense next year and
sees a continuation of the across-the-board government spending
cuts known as sequestration.  “Looking ahead to 2014, we are planning for a continued
slow growth macro environment,” Cote said today in a statement.  Honeywell, based in Morris Township, New Jersey,  fell  2.5
percent to $84.58 at the close in New York, the  biggest decliner 
today among industrial companies on the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index. The shares have gained 33 percent this year compared with
a 22 percent increase for the S&P 500 Index.  Revenue in the third quarter rose 3.3 percent to $9.65
billion, trailing the $9.91 billion average of analysts’
estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Net income rose 4.2 percent to $990 million, or $1.24 a
share, from $950 million, or $1.20, a year earlier, Honeywell
said today. Analysts projected $1.24 a share, the average of 20
estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Profit Forecast  Sales rose 10 percent to $1.63 billion at its Performance
Materials and Technologies unit, which provides energy services
such as natural gas filtration. Transportation unit sales rose
6.1 percent and sales climbed 4.3 percent at Automation and
Control Solutions, the company’s largest unit.  Honeywell also boosted the lower end of its annual profit
forecast. Earnings per share for 2013 will be $4.90 to $4.95, up
from a previous projection of $4.85 to $4.95. The average of 22
analysts estimates compiled by Bloomberg was $4.95 a share.  “Going into today’s earnings, investors were already at
the high end of earnings guidance and the company just raised
the low end of the range,” said Christian Mayes, an analyst
with Edward Jones & Co., who has a buy rating on the stock. “So
maybe a little bit of disappointment from other investors on
that.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
