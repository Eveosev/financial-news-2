Petrus wines spanning more than half
a century and dating back to 1945 go on sale at a  Sotheby’s (BID) 
auction in  London  this week along with historic Pomerol from the
1920s and Burgundies including Echezeaux 1978 Jayer.  A case of Chateau Latour a Pomerol 1961 carries an upper
estimate of 50,000 pounds ($80,800), while 12 bottles of Petrus
1982 are priced to fetch as much as 38,000 pounds, according to
Sotheby’s online catalog. Two cases of Petrus 1990 and one of
its 1989 vintage each carry top estimates of 30,000 pounds.  The sale comes as the Liv-ex Fine Wine 50 Index, tracking
leading  Bordeaux  vintages from more recent years, has declined
since March 15, paring an 8 percent gain made in the previous 11
weeks to leave it 1 percent up since the end of December. Lower
demand from  Asia  has combined with sterling strength against the
dollar to leave the benchmark index little changed from the
level at which it was trading at the end of June last year.  “Overall it’s a good time to be investing, because prices
have come down so much over the last couple of years,’ said
 Chris Smith , investment manager at The Wine Investment Fund in
London. “We’re now well below the trend line, so that in itself
gives potential for a boost.” The fund, invested in Bordeaux,
manages $50 million.  Personal Cellar  Historic bottles in the sale include one magnum of Petrus
1945, with a top estimate of 16,000 pounds, another from its
1961 vintage valued at as much as 13,000 pounds and a magnum of
Latour a Pomerol 1929 priced to fetch as much as 5,500 pounds.  Petrus has 28 acres (11 hectares) planted with red-grape
vines, of which 95 percent are Merlot and 5 percent Cabernet
Franc. The Bordeaux vineyard is in Pomerol, on the right bank of
the Dordogne river. Fermentation is in temperature-controlled
concrete tanks and the wine matured in new oak barrels.  Lots in the first part of the sale come from the personal
cellar of Lily Lacost-Loubat, a former owner of Petrus who
inherited both that estate and  Chateau Latour  a Pomerol in 1961
from her aunt, according to an e-mailed Sotheby’s statement.
Proceeds from that part of the sale will go to a charity.  Wines elsewhere in the auction, which is estimated to raise
as much as 1.4 million pounds in total, include a single bottle
of Echezeaux 1978 Burgundy from Henri Jayer, carrying a top
estimate of 3,600 pounds, and eight bottles of Maison Leroy’s
Musigny 1978, priced to fetch as much as 14,000 pounds.  Here is a list of global wine auctions scheduled so far
