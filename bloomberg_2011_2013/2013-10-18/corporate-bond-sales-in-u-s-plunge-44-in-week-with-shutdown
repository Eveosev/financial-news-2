Sales of corporate bonds in the U.S.
dropped 22 percent as issuers avoided tapping the market with
Congress wrestling over the government’s borrowing limit and a
partial shutdown.  Neiman Marcus Group, the luxury retailer being purchased by
Ares Management LLC and the Canada Pension Plan Investment
Board, and Chicago-based Wm. Wrigley Jr. Co. led sales of $18
billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Offerings fell
from  $23.2 billion  last week and compare with $21.6 billion in
the similar period in 2012.  Issuance slowed with  Standard & Poor’s  forecasting the two-week closure that ended yesterday will reduce fourth-quarter
economic growth by at least 0.6 percent. Lawmakers in Congress
voted to fund the government through Jan. 15, and suspend the
debt ceiling through Feb. 7, potentially setting up more rounds
of political combat over taxes and spending.  “It’s not a permanent solution so I think we’re going to
revisit these stress periods over the next few months,”  Thomas Chow , a Philadelphia-based  money manager  at Delaware Investments
who helps oversee about $135 billion, said in a telephone
interview. “Risk sentiment has become more dependent upon
political and macro developments than credit-specific risks.”  Political Risk  The extra yield investors demand to own corporate bonds
rather than government debentures narrowed 4 basis points for
the week through yesterday to 214 basis points, according to
Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data. Yields decreased to
3.97 percent from 4.08 percent, and compare with a record-low
3.35 percent on May 2.  Neiman’s $1.56 billion sale of eight-year debt included
$600 million of payment-in-kind toggle securities that pay 8.75
percent in cash or 9.5 percent if the Dallas-based retailer pays
in the form of additional debt, Bloomberg data show. The
securities are rated Caa2 by Moody’s Investors Service.  The bonds are the first PIK securities to be issued through
an operating company for the purpose of funding a leveraged
buyout since 2007, according to Marc Warm, the New York-based
head of U.S. high-yield capital markets at Credit Suisse Group
AG, which helped manage the offering. Sales of $5.1 billion of
PIK toggle bonds this year through Aug. 31 were generally used
to fund dividend payouts to private equity sponsors or for share
repurchases, according to a Sept. 20 report from Moody’s.  Wrigley Offering  Mars Inc.’s Wrigley unit, the maker of Juicy Fruit and
Altoids, issued $3 billion of securities in five parts maturing
between 2016 and 2020, Bloomberg data show. The largest piece,
$900 million of 3.375 percent, seven-year bonds priced at a
relative yield of 135 basis points, were quoted yesterday at
101.8 cents on the dollar to yield 3.09 percent, according to
prices compiled by Bloomberg.  Sales of investment-grade debentures reached at least $13.9
billion, compared with  $13 billion  last week and $13.6 billion
in the similar period in 2012, Bloomberg data show. Offerings of
speculative-grade bonds reached at least $4.1 billion, compared
with  $10.2 billion  last week and $7.9 billion in the period last
year.  High-risk, high-yield bonds are rated below Baa3 by Moody’s
and lower than BBB- at Standard & Poor’s.  To contact the reporter on this story:
