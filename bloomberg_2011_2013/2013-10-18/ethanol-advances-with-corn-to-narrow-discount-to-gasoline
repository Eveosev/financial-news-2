Ethanol futures rose, capping a
weekly advance with corn as rain delayed the U.S. harvest and
with supplies at a record low. The biofuel’s discount to
gasoline widened.  Ethanol increased 1.1 percent today and 5.4 percent this
week, the second straight advance. Corn, the biofuel’s primary
component in the U.S., gained 1.9 percent for the week as
western and northern areas of the Midwest received at least an
inch (2.5 centimeters) of rain, possibly slowing the harvest.
Ethanol stockpiles were at a record low 15.4 million barrels in
the week ended Oct. 4, according to the U.S. Energy Information
Administration, which is scheduled to release new data Oct. 21.  “Generally speaking, end users are going hand to mouth in
ethanol. They buy a week out, they don’t buy a month out,” said
Jerrod Kitt, an analyst at Linn Group in  Chicago . “So when they
come in to the market, they come in to the market, and they
drive this price up.”  Denatured ethanol for November delivery advanced 1.9 cents
to settle at $1.81 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade.
Ethanol’s discount to gasoline widened 0.63 cent to 86.32 cents
a gallon.  November-delivery gasoline rose 2.53 cents, or 1 percent,
to settle at $2.6732 a gallon on the New York Mercantile
Exchange. The contract covers reformulated gasoline, made to be
blended with ethanol before delivery to filling stations.  Corn for December settlement fell 1.5 cents to $4.415 a
bushel in Chicago, paring the weekly gain. Prices have slumped
this year as the U.S. is harvesting a record crop estimated at
13.8 billion bushels. The ethanol crush spread based on December
contracts rose to 7 cents a gallon from 5.4 cents.  In cash market trading, ethanol gained 3.5 cents to $2.32
on the West Coast, data compiled by Bloomberg show. It fell 0.5
cent to $2.095 a gallon in Chicago. The price was unchanged at
$2.185 on the Gulf Coast and $2.26 on the East Coast.  To contact the reporter on this story:
