Uganda heightened its security alert
after saying it received intelligence from the U.S. Embassy
warning of a possible attack similar to last month’s assault by
Islamist militants on a shopping mall in neighboring  Kenya .  Police Chief Kale Kayihura ordered all off-duty officers
back to work and deployed more security personnel at
entertainment centers, shopping malls and places of worship,
deputy police spokesman Patrick Onyango said today by phone.  “All officers including those on leave are back to duty,”
Onyango said from the capital, Kampala. “This means the alert
is very high.”  Somalia’s al-Qaeda-linked al-Shabaab militia said it
carried out an attack on the Westgate Mall in Kenya’s capital,
Nairobi, that began Sept. 21, killing at least 67 civilians and
security personnel. The group said it was an act of revenge for
Kenya deploying its army in southern Somalia two years ago to
fight the militants. The rebel group has waged a campaign since
2007 to topple Somalia’s government and impose Islamic law.  Uganda also has troops in the African Union Mission in
Somalia, along with Burundi, Djibouti and Sierra Leone, while
Ethiopian soldiers are operating in the country independently.  Uganda was the focus of an attack by al-Shabaab in July
2010, when bombs exploded at two venues in Kampala where soccer
fans had gathered to watch the final World Cup match on
television, leaving 76 people dead.  To contact the reporter on this story:
