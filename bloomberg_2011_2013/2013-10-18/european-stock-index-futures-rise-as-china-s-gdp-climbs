European stocks  rose for a seventh
day, their longest winning streak this year, as China’s economic
growth accelerated for the first time in three quarters.  Schindler Holding AG jumped 4.3 percent after the Swiss
elevator maker announced a share buyback.  Cap Gemini (CAP)  SA climbed
to six-year high after saying it will repurchase convertible
bonds to forestall a potential dilution of equity. Grifols SA
fell 3.5 percent after an investor sold a stake in  Europe ’s
largest blood-plasma products maker.  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index advanced 0.8 percent to 318.47,
extending its highest level since June 2008. The gauge rallied
2.2 percent this week as U.S. lawmakers agreed to extend the
government’s borrowing authority until early 2014 and end a
partial government shutdown.  “We’ve seen activity in China picking up over the past few
months, and the GDP figure is in line with that,” Richard Scrope, who helps oversee about $160 million as a  fund manager 
at Oriel Asset Management LLP in  London , said by phone.
“European earnings have been very mixed so far. Earnings
expectations need to be supported by actual company results.
Otherwise some valuations will start to look extended.”  National benchmark indexes advanced in all of the 18
western European markets. The U.K.’s FTSE 100 rallied 0.7
percent, while  France ’s CAC 40 climbed 1.1 percent.  Germany ’s
DAX added 0.6 percent.  The volume of shares changing hands in Stoxx 600-listed
companies was 9.6 percent greater than the average of the past
30 days, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Euro-area
stock volatility signaled by options prices fell to a seven-month low.  Chinese Economy  In  China ,  gross domestic product  increased 7.8 percent in
the third quarter from a year earlier, the National Bureau of
Statistics said. That matched the median estimate of economists
in a Bloomberg survey. The world’s second-biggest economy posted
GDP growth of 7.7 percent and 7.5 percent in the first two
quarters, slipping from a 7.9 percent expansion in the final
three months of 2012.  Schindler advanced 4.3 percent to 127.30 Swiss francs, its
biggest gain since November 2011. The elevator maker said it
will buy back 4.1 million shares and 4.1 million participation
certificates at 129 francs and 129.80 francs each, respectively.
The repurchase price for equity marked a 5.7 percent premium to
yesterday’s closing price.  Cap Gemini  gained 5.5 percent to 48.06 euros after saying
it plans to buy back convertible bonds due Jan. 1, 2014, through
reverse bookbuilding. France’s biggest computer-services company
also opened a separate  bond issue  to raise 350 million euros
($479 million) and pay for the buyback. Cap Gemini had said in
July it will allocate 400 million euros to offset the potential
share dilution created by the 2014 bonds.  Euriware Talks  Separately, Cap Gemini said yesterday after European
markets closed that it has started exclusive talks to buy Areva
SA’s software-services unit Euriware.  Svenska Cellulosa AB (SCAB)  jumped 6.9 percent to 173.50 kronor,
its biggest increase in a year. The maker of tissue paper and
personal-hygiene products posted third-quarter net income of
1.45 billion kronor ($226 million). That exceeded the 1.36
billion-krona estimate of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Yara International ASA climbed 4.3 percent to 247.10
kroner. The Oslo-based company said fertilizer deliveries
increased 17 percent in the third quarter from a year earlier
because of higher sales in  Brazil .  Ziggo NV rose 2 percent to 31 euros after reiterating its
full-year forecast for so-called organic-sales growth of about 1
percent. The Dutch cable-television provider, which this week
rejected an offer from Liberty Global Plc, reported third-quarter revenue of 391 million euros, compared with analysts’
estimate of 393 million euros.  Grifols slipped 3.5 percent to 29.05 euros after Alken
Asset Management LLP sold a 2.7 percent stake in the company.
UBS AG said it placed the shares at 29 euros each.  Anglo American Plc lost 1.4 percent to 1,532 pence after
saying third-quarter production fell 24 percent to 9.5 million
tons at its Kumba iron-ore unit. Kumba, in which Anglo American
owns 70 percent, has said it will need a new permit to access a
third of the reserves at its largest mine in  South Africa .  To contact the reporter on this story:
