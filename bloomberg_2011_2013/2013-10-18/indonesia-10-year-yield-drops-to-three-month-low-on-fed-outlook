Indonesian bonds rose this week,
pushing the 10-year yield to the lowest level in almost three
months, as speculation the  Federal Reserve  will delay tapering
stimulus drove inflows. Rupiah forwards strengthened.  Global funds have added 11.4 trillion rupiah ($1 billion)
to local-currency  sovereign debt  holdings since the Fed
unexpectedly refrained from reducing its $85 billion of monthly
bond-buying on Sept. 19, finance ministry data show. The U.S.
central bank should further postpone tapering as data used to
gauge the economy’s health were halted during the 16-day
government shutdown, Fed Bank of Chicago President  Charles Evans 
said yesterday.  The yield on  Indonesia ’s 5.625 percent bonds due May 2023
dropped 51 basis points this week to 7.46 percent as of 9:52 a.m.
in Jakarta, the lowest level since July 23, prices from the
Inter Dealer Market Association show. The rate fell seven basis
points, or 0.07 percentage point, today. The nation’s debt is
 Asia ’s worst performer, having lost 11 percent this year,
according to HSBC Holdings Plc indexes.  “Foreign fund flows are driving the rally on optimism Fed
stimulus will continue,” said Handy Yunianto, the Jakarta-based
head of fixed-income research at PT Mandiri Sekuritas, a unit of
the nation’s largest bank. “Indonesia’s bonds corrected by the
most this year, so investors are seeing good value in the
yields.”  Forwards, Volatility  One-month non-deliverable forwards on the rupiah rose 1
percent this week and 0.5 percent today to 10,943 per dollar,
data compiled by Bloomberg show. They reached 10,875 earlier
today, the strongest level since Sept. 20. The contracts were
3.5 percent stronger than the onshore spot rate, which rose 0.4
percent this week and 0.1 percent today to 11,323 per dollar,
according to prices from local banks.  A  fixing  used to settle the offshore forwards was set at
10,961 per dollar yesterday, the strongest level since Sept. 19,
according to the Association of Banks in  Singapore .  The rupiah’s one-month implied volatility, a measure of
expected moves in the  exchange rate  used to price options,
dropped 76 basis points this week to 14.45 percent, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. The gauge fell 26 basis points today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
