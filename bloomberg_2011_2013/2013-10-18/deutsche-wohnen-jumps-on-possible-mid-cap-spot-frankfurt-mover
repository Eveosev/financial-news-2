Deutsche Wohnen AG (DWNI)  rose the most in
five months in Frankfurt trading after MSCI Inc. said the
company may join its Global Standard Mid-Cap Index if a planned
takeover of a German competitor succeeds.  Deutsche Wohnen climbed as much as 4.8 percent to 13.77
euros, the biggest intraday gain since May 14. Shares of  GSW
Immobilien AG (GIB) , the company that Deutsche Wohnen has offered to
buy in a share exchange valued at 1.7 billion euros ($2.3
billion), gained as much as 5.1 percent to 33.47 euros, the most
since Aug. 20.  The joint company’s market value would be big enough to
qualify for a place in the mid-cap section of the MSCI Global
Standard Indices, MSCI wrote in an e-mail to clients after the
market closed yesterday. MSCI spokeswoman Jo Morgan said
Deutsche Wohnen is currently listed on the company’s German
small-cap index.  Deutsche Wohnen spokeswoman Manuela Damianakis declined to
comment.  Deutsche Wohnen,  Germany ’s third-largest residential
landlord by market value, on Aug. 20 announced a plan to buy its
competitor and create Germany’s second-biggest homeowner by
number of apartments. Both companies are based in Berlin, where
price and rent increases have outpaced the rest of the country.  GSW’s management on Oct. 15 recommended that shareholders
accept the takeover bid.  To contact the reporter on this story:
