America Movil SAB (AMXL)  still faces a
credit rating downgrade by Moody’s Investors Service, even after
withdrawing a $9.8 billion takeover bid for Royal KPN NV that
drew the ratings company’s scrutiny.  Billionaire  Carlos Slim ’s company said this week that it
refused to give in to pressure from the Dutch phone carrier to
raise its offer higher than 2.40 euros ($3.28) a share. While
the withdrawn bid does increase the chance America Movil can
keep its A2 rating, Moody’s said today it needs to review the
way other acquisitions could affect the company’s debt.  America Movil,  Latin America ’s largest wireless company,
hasn’t decided whether to maintain its financial stake of about
30 percent in KPN, and Dutch law prevents the company from
making a new takeover bid for six months. Slim may choose to
pursue takeovers in Europe or  Brazil  in the meantime, analysts
at Corporativo GBM SAB and Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. have said.  “While the withdrawal of the offer is viewed as generally
credit-positive for  America Movil ’s ratings, as it eliminates
the potential heightened operational and financial challenges of
controlling KPN, our review will still focus on the potential
for other acquisitions and the likely impact on its leverage and
other credit metrics,” Soummo Mukherjee, a Moody’s senior
analyst, said today in a statement.  America Movil’s rating could remain the same, five levels
above non-investment grade, if the Mexico City-based company is
likely to maintain total debt of no more than 1.5 times
earnings, Moody’s said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
