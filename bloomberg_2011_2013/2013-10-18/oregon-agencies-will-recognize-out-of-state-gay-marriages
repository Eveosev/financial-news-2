Oregon state agencies  must recognize
out-of-state same-sex marriages, even though the state’s
constitution bars such nuptials,  Oregon ’s  justice department 
said in a legal opinion.  “We cannot identify any defensible state interest, much
less a legitimate or compelling one, in refusing to recognize
marriages performed between consenting, unrelated adults under
the laws of another state,” said Oregon Deputy Attorney General
Mary Williams in an Oct. 16 opinion. “It is legally defensible
for Oregon agencies to recognize same-sex marriages validly
performed in other jurisdictions.”  Williams was responding to an inquiry by the state’s
administrative services department about whether, in light of
recent U.S. Supreme Court rulings, Oregon agencies can treat
same-sex couples legally married in other states as married for
the purposes of administering tax laws and benefits programs
providing health insurance, Williams said.  In June, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the 1996
Defense of Marriage Act that denied federal benefits to same-sex
couples legally married in states that allowed it. The court
also reinstated a federal judge’s order allowing gay marriages
in  California .  At least 13 states and the District of Columbia allow gay
marriage.  To contact the reporter on this story:
