International Foreign Exchange
Concepts Holdings Inc., the holding company for FX Concepts LLC,
filed for bankruptcy in  New York  eight days after FX Concepts
said it would shutter its investment-management business as
assets declined.  International Foreign Exchange Concepts LP, an associated
unit, listed as much as $50 million in assets and the same
amount in liabilities in a separate filing yesterday in U.S.
Bankruptcy Court in  Manhattan .  FX Concepts, the currency hedge fund founded by  John Taylor 
in 1981, was once the world’s largest with more than $14 billion
in assets at its peak, the company said in court documents. The
San Francisco Employees’ Retirement System voted on Sept. 11 to
pull the more than $450 million it had invested, which,
according to the company, was the “final straw.”  “That investment made up almost 66 percent of the debtors’
total assets under management at that point, and the redemption
proved fatal to the debtors’ business,” FX Concepts said in the
court documents.  The New York-based hedge fund’s assets under management had
shrunk to $661 million as of Sept. 26, according to data from
the company’s investor website.  Investor funds have been, or will be returned, IFEC said.
There are no allegations of misconduct, fraud or mismanagement,
the company said in the court documents.  The case is In re International Foreign Exchange Concepts
Holdings Inc. 13-13379.  U.S. Bankruptcy Court  Southern District
of New York. (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
