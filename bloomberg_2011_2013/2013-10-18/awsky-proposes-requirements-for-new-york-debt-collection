Courts should require collectors of
consumer debts to document the disputed loans and prove
borrowers were notified of proceedings before rulings are made,
according to Benjamin M. Lawsky, superintendent of the  New York 
State Department of Financial Services.  Lawsky made the recommendation in a letter today to a state
administrative judge, saying proposed changes in court rules
should seek to end so-called robosigning of affidavits and
ensure debt collectors actually review the cases. His agency is
also asking courts to let plaintiffs vacate a default judgment
if a debt collector violates these rules.  Abusive debt-collection practices have drawn more than
13,000 complaints from state residents, Lawsky’s office said in
July. The firms have been cited for seeking to collect debts
from the wrong consumers or for the wrong amount of money,
Lawsky said.  The New York court system proposed rules in September that
would require standardized affidavits in certain consumer credit
cases to ensure greater transparency during the collection
process.  “The proposed rules could go much further to address the
significant debt-collection litigation abuses that have a
profound impact on  New Yorkers  and the state court system,”
Lawsky said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
