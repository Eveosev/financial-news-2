Mexico ’s benchmark peso-denominated
bonds headed for their third straight weekly advance after U.S.
lawmakers ended a budget showdown that had dragged on demand for
the Latin American nation’s debt.  Yields on fixed-rate securities due in December 2024 fell
18 basis points, or 0.18 percentage point, to 5.71 percent this
week as of 9:59 a.m. in Mexico City, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. The yield was unchanged today. The currency has
appreciated 1.5 percent since Oct. 11. It fell 0.1 percent to
12.7941 per dollar today.  Peso assets are rebounding from a global selloff in
emerging-market assets fueled by concern the U.S., the
destination for 80 percent of Mexico’s exports, would fail to
meet a deadline to increase its debt limit. After weeks of
wrangling, lawmakers in  Washington  agreed to fund the federal
government and increase the borrowing authority, avoiding a
potential default.  Longer-maturity peso bonds had been punished by “all this
uncertainty about the U.S. budget,” Claudio Irigoyen, the head
of Latin American fixed-income and foreign-exchange strategy at
Bank of America Corp., said in a phone interview from New York.
“Now you’re basically correcting that selloff.”  The peso’s advance this week is the biggest in  emerging
markets  after  Indonesia ’s rupiah and the Hungarian forint. The
currency is stronger partly because the economic damage from the
U.S. government shutdown means the Federal Reserve will probably
hold off on reducing a record monetary stimulus program that has
buoyed Mexican assets, Irigoyen said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
