Russell Wilson threw three touchdown
passes and the  Seattle Seahawks  defeated the  Arizona Cardinals 
34-22 to start a National Football League season with six wins
and one loss for the first time.  The Seahawks logged their first victory in three visits to
University of Phoenix Stadium in Glendale,  Arizona , to hand the
Cardinals (3-4) their only defeat in three home games this
season. The win gives the Seahawks, who had lost six of their
previous seven games at the Cardinals, the best record in the
 National Football Conference .  Wilson threw touchdown passes of 31 yards to Sidney Rice
and 15 yards to Zach Miller to give  Seattle  a 14-0 lead 89
seconds into the second quarter against its NFC West rival.  Arizona cut the deficit on a 49-yard field goal by Jay Feely and a three-yard run for a touchdown by Rashard Mendenhall
before Steven Hauschka kicked a season-long 51-yard field goal
five seconds before halftime to make it 17-10 for Seattle.  Feely made it 17-13 on the second drive of the third
quarter with a field goal from 52 yards, his longest of the
season.  Seattle moved to a 24-13 lead on a one-yard touchdown pass
by Wilson to Kellen Davis. The Seahawks regained possession at
Arizona’s 1-yard line after Brandon Browner returned an
interception of a  Carson Palmer  pass 47 yards. Marshawn Lynch
drove into the end zone two plays later to leave Arizona
trailing 31-13 with one quarter remaining.  After each team kicked a field goal, Palmer found rookie
Jaron Brown in the end zone for an eight-yard touchdown to leave
the Cardinals 12 points behind after they failed with a two-point conversion attempt.  Arizona’s chances ended when Palmer failed to convert a
fourth-and-three play with 24 seconds remaining.  To contact the reporter on this story:
