Gold futures fell from a one-week
high as a rally in global equities curbed demand for the
precious metal as an alternative investment.  The MSCI All-Country World Index of stocks extended a rally
to a five-year high after  China ’s economic growth accelerated.
Gold jumped 3.9 percent in the previous two days amid
speculation that the Federal Reserve will hold off on scaling
back monetary stimulus.  “People want to be in equities as the most lucrative
investment,” Michael Smith, the president of T&K Futures &
Options in Port St. Lucie,  Florida , said in a telephone
interview. “Also, there is some profit-taking after the big
rally” in gold, he said.  Gold futures for December delivery fell 0.6 percent to
settle at $1,314.60 an ounce at 1:38 p.m. on the Comex in New
York. Earlier, the price reached $1,328.90, the highest for a
most-active contract since Oct. 8.  Gold has slumped 22 percent this year, heading for the
first annual decline since 2000. Some investors lost faith in
the metal as a store of value as U.S. equities rallied to a
record and inflation remained muted.  The stalemate over U.S. fiscal policy that shut the
government for 16 days slowed economic growth, President  Barack
Obama  said yesterday. Narayana Kocherlakota, the president of
the Minneapolis Fed, said policy makers should maintain low
interest rates to reduce unemployment, even at the risk of
temporarily pushing inflation above the central bank’s 2 percent
goal.  Silver futures for December delivery fell 0.2 percent to
$21.913 an ounce. The price has tumbled 28 percent this year.  On the New York Mercantile Exchange, platinum futures for
January delivery increased 0.2 percent to $1,437.80 an ounce.
This week, prices advanced 4.5 percent, ending a seven-week
slump. Palladium futures for December delivery climbed 0.4
percent to $740.65 an ounce. The metal gained 3.8 percent this
week, the most since July.  To contact the reporter on this story:
