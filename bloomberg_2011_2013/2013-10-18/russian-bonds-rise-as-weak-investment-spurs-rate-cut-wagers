Russian bond  yields (USGG10YR)  fell to the
lowest in almost a month after weaker-than-expected data stoked
speculation the central bank will cut  interest rates .  The yield on the government’s debt due February 2027
declined four basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 7.58
percent, the lowest since Sept. 23 and a nine basis-point drop
in the week. The ruble was steady against Bank Rossii’s target
basket of dollars and euros at 37.1409 by 3:25 p.m. in Moscow.  Retail sales and investment growth missed economists’
estimates, data showed yesterday. Lower rates are needed to halt
the trend, Vladimir Osakovskiy, Bank of America Corp.’s chief
economist for Russia in Moscow, said in e-mailed comments. The
 Federal Reserve  shouldn’t start curbing stimulus as the data
used to gauge the economy’s health stopped during the government
shutdown, Chicago Fed President  Charles Evans  said yesterday.
Crude oil, Russia’s main export earner, gained after Chinese
data showed economic growth accelerating.  “The rally is at full speed,” Dmitry Dorofeev, a fixed-income strategist at BCS Financial Group, said in e-mailed
comments. “Expectations of postponed tapering, good Chinese GDP
reading and decent prospects for rate cuts support Russian
bonds, especially the long end.”  Crude oil rose 0.9 percent to $110.06 a barrel in  London .
Yields on 10-year U.S. Treasury notes declined three basis
points to 2.56 percent, the lowest since July 23.  The ruble advanced 0.1 percent against the dollar to
31.8525 and was steady against the euro at 43.5650.  To contact the reporter on this story:
