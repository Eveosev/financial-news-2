Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) ,
Switzerland’s second-largest bank, is offering an exchange-traded note tied to the Russell 1000 Growth Index that’s similar
to one issued by  UBS AG (UBS) , the country’s largest lender.  The  Credit Suisse FI Enhanced Big Cap Growth (FIBG)  securities,
trading under the ticker FIBG, initially yield 1.62 times the
gains and losses of the total return version of the index,
according to a prospectus filed with the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission. The amount of leverage can change over
time.  UBS started trading its  FI Enhanced Big Cap Growth ETN (FBG) 
under the ticker FBG in June last year, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The ETNs track twice the gains and losses
of the Russell benchmark, according to a  prospectus  filed with
the SEC. Fisher Asset Management LLC, owned by billionaire
investment adviser Ken Fisher, holds about  96 percent  of the
outstanding securities, according to the company’s latest
filings.  Perrin Wheeler, a spokeswoman for Credit Suisse in New
York, didn’t return a voicemail and an e-mail seeking comment on
the notes. David Eckerly, a spokesman for Fisher Asset
Management, declined to comment.  The Russell 1000 Growth Index, which tracks companies with
the fastest earnings growth, climbed 23 percent this year to
812.23 at the close of trading today.  ETNs are unsecured bank debt backed by their issuer’s
credit, unlike exchange-traded funds, which hold assets. Banks
create and redeem shares of ETNs based on the level of demand
for the securities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
