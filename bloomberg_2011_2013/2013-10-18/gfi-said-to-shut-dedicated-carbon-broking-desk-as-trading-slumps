GFI Group Inc. (GFIG)  closed its carbon
desk in London and transferred the business to other teams amid
a slump in over-the-counter trading of European permits,
according to two people with direct knowledge.  GFI, an interdealer broker based in  New York , will now
handle carbon through teams trading related products such as
energy, said the people, who asked not to be identified because
the change hasn’t been publicly announced.  “We keep our product offerings and the make-up of our
desks under constant review in order to ensure that we are
operating in an efficient manner,” GFI said in an e-mailed
statement that didn’t confirm the specific changes.  Trading in European Union emission allowances via brokers
slumped 79 percent last month from a year ago to 50 million
metric tons. Volumes on ICE Futures  Europe , the biggest exchange
for the permits, rose 11 percent in September to 581 million
tons, according to  data  from the London Energy Brokers’
Association and ICE. The price of allowances plunged 23 percent
this year amid a record glut in supply.  The EU carbon market had a surplus of 1.8 billion metric
tons of carbon allowances and credits in the five years through
2012, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance in London. This
year’s supply of EU carbon permits is 2.1 billion tons,
according to European Commission data.  Permits for December fell 1.2 percent to 5.12 euros ($7.01)
a ton at 11 a.m. on ICE in London.  To contact the reporters on this story:
