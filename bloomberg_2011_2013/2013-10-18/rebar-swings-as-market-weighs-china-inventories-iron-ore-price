Steel reinforcement-bar futures in
 Shanghai  swung between gains and losses as an increase in
 China ’s inventory of the material weighed against an advance in
iron ore prices.  Rebar for delivery in January on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange fell as much as 0.5 percent and climbed as much as 0.3
percent. The contract was down 0.2 percent at 3,551 yuan ($583)
a metric ton at 10:38 a.m. local time and has lost 1.4 percent
this week.  Rebar inventory in China rose to 6.3 million tons as of
Oct. 11, the first expansion in five weeks, according to
Shanghai Steelhome Information Technology Co.  Iron ore  for
immediate delivery at Tianjin port gained 0.5 percent yesterday
to $134.40 a dry ton, the highest since Sept. 13, according to a
price index compiled by The Steel Index Ltd.  “Rebar continued to look for a direction because demand
will be weak in winter,” said Wang Yongliang, an analyst at
Beijing Cifco Futures Co. in Tianjin.  Iron ore futures for physical delivery made their debut on
the Dalian Commodity Exchange today. The contract for delivery
in May, the most active by volume, traded at 978  yuan  after the
bourse set an opening base price of 950 yuan.  The spot price of rebar fell 0.2 percent yesterday to 3,506
yuan a ton, according to Beijing Antaike Information Development
Co.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
