Alice Munro, this year’s winner of
the  Nobel Prize  in Literature, won’t travel to Stockholm in
December to receive the prize, Peter Englund, permanent
secretary of the Swedish Academy said in a blog posting today.  The Canadian author’s health is simply too frail, Englund
said.  “There is no way around reasons of this type,” he said.  It isn’t yet known who will accept the reward on her
behalf, Englund said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
