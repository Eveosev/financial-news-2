The pound was set for a weekly
advance versus the dollar as investors bet the U.S. debt ceiling
debate will prompt the  Federal Reserve  to maintain asset
purchases that tend to weaken a currency.  Sterling also headed for a weekly advance against the euro
as data showed the U.K. economy is gaining momentum. U.S.
President  Barack Obama  signed into law a measure ending the 16-day government shutdown and extending the nationâ€™s borrowing
authority until early next year, averting a default. The U.K.
Debt Management Office is scheduled to auction 2 billion pounds
($3.23 billion) of bills.  The pound was little changed at $1.6180 as of 7:41 a.m.
London time after climbing 1.3 percent yesterday, the biggest
gain since Sept. 18. It has risen 1.4 percent versus the U.S.
currency this week, the most since the period ended Sept. 13.
Sterling was also little changed at 84.58 pence per euro, having
strengthened 0.4 percent this week.  Data yesterday showed U.K. retail sales rose more than
analysts forecast last month, following an Oct. 16 report that
showed jobless claims fell in September by the most in 16 years.  The pound appreciated 5.2 percent in the past six months,
the best performer among 10 developed-nation currencies tracked
by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The euro strengthened
4 percent, while the dollar weakened 1.3 percent.  U.K. government bonds lost 3.2 percent this year through
yesterday, according to Bloomberg World Bond Indexes. Treasuries
dropped 2.2 percent and German securities declined 2 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
