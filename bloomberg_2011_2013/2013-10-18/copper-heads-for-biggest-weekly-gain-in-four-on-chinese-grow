Copper futures rose after stronger
economic growth bolstered the outlook for demand in  China , the
world’s largest consumer of the metal.  In the three months ended Sept. 30, gross domestic product
expanded 7.8 percent from a year earlier, China’s statistics
bureau said today. Expansion accelerated from 7.5 percent in the
prior period, the first increase in three quarters. Copper also
rose on speculation that the  Federal Reserve  will maintain its
monetary stimulus after a stalemate over U.S. fiscal policy shut
the government for 16 days, slowing the economy.  “China growth numbers are very supportive,”  David Meger ,
the director of metal trading at Vision Financial Markets in
Chicago, said in a telephone interview. “The Fed maintaining
the pace of the stimulus is also helping copper.”  Copper futures for December delivery advanced 0.1 percent
to close at $3.299 a pound at 1:05 p.m. on the Comex in New
York. The price, up 0.9 percent this week, has dropped 9.7
percent in 2013.  Inventories tracked by the London Metal Exchange fell for
the 32nd straight session to 497,500 metric tons, the lowest
since March 7.  On the LME, copper for delivery in three months rose 0.2
percent to $7,245 a ton ($3.29 a pound.) Zinc and nickel
advanced, while aluminum, lead and tin fell.  To contact the reporters on this story:
