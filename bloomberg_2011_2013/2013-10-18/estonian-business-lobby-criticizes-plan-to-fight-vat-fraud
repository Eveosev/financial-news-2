Estonia ’s largest corporate lobby
groups said the Finance Ministry’s plans to fight value added
tax-fraud are worsening the competitiveness and business climate
of the newest euro area member.  The measures would increase the administrative and tax
burdens of law-abiding entrepreneurs instead of targeting
fraudsters, six organizations including the Estonian Chamber of
Commerce and Industry and the Estonian Employers Confederation
said in an e-mailed statement today.  Estonia, which became the first former Soviet republic to
adopt the euro in 2011, has struggled in recent years to cut VAT
fraud while keeping a business-friendly tax system, a linchpin
of its policy to attract foreign investment. The country lost
222 million euros ($304 million) to VAT revenue fraud last year,
compared with receipts of 1.5 billion euros, Finance Minister
Juergen Ligi said last month.  “The  Finance Ministry  is heading toward significantly
worsening Estonia’s business environment,” the groups said in
an e-mailed statement. “Composing such drafts without involving
the stakeholders isn’t appropriate for a democratic rule of
law.”  The tax office will start collecting data on domestic sales
and purchase transactions exceeding 1,000 euros via
entrepreneurs’ monthly tax receipts, while VAT deductions on car
purchases will be limited by half and can’t exceed 2,000 euros,
according to plans unveiled by the ministry last month. The
interest-free deadline on VAT refunds would also be extended by
half to 60 days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
