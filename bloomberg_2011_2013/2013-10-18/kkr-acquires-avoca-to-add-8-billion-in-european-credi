KKR & Co. (KKR) , the private-equity firm
run by Henry Kravis and  George Roberts , agreed to buy Avoca
Capital to expand its European credit business. Terms of the
acquisition weren’t disclosed.  Avoca Capital, based in London and Dublin, has $8 billion
under management and invests in European loans, bonds and
credits, the companies said today in a statement.  “We believe the European credit space offers significant
opportunity,” Kravis and Roberts said in the statement. “Avoca
has a very strong track record, an entrepreneurial management
team and excellent capabilities that are complementary to ours
in European senior and liquid credit.”  KKR, based in New York, will have $28 billion in credit
assets when the transaction closes, which is expected in the
first quarter. The firm’s credit unit invested $2 billion in
European companies in the past two years, according to the
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
