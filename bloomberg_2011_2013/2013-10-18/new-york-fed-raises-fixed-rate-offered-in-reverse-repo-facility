The  Federal Reserve Bank of New York 
said it will double the rate offered through the reverse-repurchase agreement facility it is testing to two basis points.  The new rate will be effective beginning Oct. 21 and all
other terms are unchanged, the New York Fed said in a statement
on its website. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  The central bank, which is still buying bonds to support
the economy, has been testing an overnight fixed-rate reverse
repo facility as part of its preparations to eventually withdraw
record monetary accommodation. In a reverse repo, the Fed lends
securities for a set period, temporarily draining cash from the
banking system. At maturity, the securities are returned to the
Fed, and the cash to its counterparties.  To contact the reporter on this story:
