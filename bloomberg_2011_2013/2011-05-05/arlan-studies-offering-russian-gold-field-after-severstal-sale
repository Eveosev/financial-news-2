Arlan , a Moscow-based investor that
sold two gold fields to OAO Severstal for $258 million, is in
talks on raising funds for another deposit or on offering it in
whole or as a joint venture partnership to foreign companies.  “We are talking to certain major state-run banks about
raising as much as $250 million to build a processing plant,”
Vasily Makarov, chief executive officer of Arlan’s Pavlik Gold
unit, said in an interview. “At the same time we have
discussions with some global gold miners about the possibility
to sell the deposit or to form a joint-venture.”  The Pavlik mine, 12 kilometers (7.5 miles) from OAO Polyus
Gold’s untapped Natalka deposit in  Russia ’s Magadan region, has
more than 150 metric tons of  gold reserves , according to Arlan.
The processing plant would be built by late 2013, it said.  Russian gold miners are boosting output and investing in
new projects as the metal trades at a record. First-quarter
production rose 14 percent from year earlier to 33 tons, the
Russian Gold Producers’ Union said April 27.  Kinross Gold Corp. (K) 
is the largest foreign gold producer in Russia, the union says.  In 2007, Arlan completed exploration and built production
facilities at its Pogromnoye and Tabornoye deposits before
selling them to Severstal’s Nordgold unit.  Alexey Chernushkin, head of  investor relations  at Polyus,
declined to comment on Pavlik. Stanislav Borodyuk, a spokesman
for Kinross in Russia, wasn’t immediately available for comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
