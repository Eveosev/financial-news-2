Heineken NV (HEIA) , the world’s third-largest
brewer, said it got a new 2 billion-euro ($3 billion) credit
line to refinance debt and back acquisitions.  The self-arranged five-year revolving credit, which
includes two one-year extension options, replaces an existing
facility of the same size that was due to expire next year, the
Amsterdam-based company said today in a statement. Money in a
revolving credit can be borrowed again once it’s been repaid.  Seventeen banks participated in the so-called club deal,
which will be used for “general corporate purposes, including
acquisitions,” according to the statement.  Heineken agreed to pay 42.5 basis points over the euro
interbank offered rate on money it draws from the facility,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. A basis point is 0.01
percentage point.  Heineken, the maker of Amstel beer and Newcastle Brown Ale,
signed the previous  credit line  in 2003 with Barclays Capital,
Citigroup Inc., Credit Suisse Group AG and JPMorgan Chase & Co.
