Following are comments from Freight
Investor Services Ltd., a London-based broker of freight and
commodity swaps, on iron-ore derivatives in a note sent
yesterday. Iron-ore swaps, used to hedge against or bet on
future prices of the steelmaking material, have advanced 13
percent in the past year, according to Clarkson Plc, the world’s
biggest shipbroker.  “The market feels pretty balanced at these levels and it’s
going to take the physical market to push the swaps into their
next move.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
