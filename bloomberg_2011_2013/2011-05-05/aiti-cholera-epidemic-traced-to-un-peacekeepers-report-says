The cholera epidemic that killed 4,500
people in Haiti last year was caused by a strain of the illness
that originated in  South Asia  and spread across the country from
an outpost housing  United Nations  peacekeepers from Nepal, an
investigation concluded.  Genetic analysis determined that the bacteria responsible
for the outbreak was “very similar, but not identical, to the
South Asian strains of cholera currently circulating in  Asia ,
confirming that the  Haitian cholera  bacteria did not originate
from the native environs of Haiti,” a panel of four experts
appointed by UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said in a report
released today.  The report said the  cholera  spread from the area of Haiti
where UN peacekeepers were encamped and traveled down the
Artibonite River to populated areas. Sanitation conditions at
the camp were “not sufficient to prevent fecal contamination”
of the river, the panel concluded, noting that the UN contracted
an unidentified company to handle the waste.  Ban “intends to convene a  task force  within the United
Nations system, to study the findings and recommendations made
by the Independent Panel of Experts to ensure prompt and
appropriate follow-up,” the UN said in a statement. “On behalf
of the UN family, the secretary-general reiterates his deepest
sympathies to the victims of the epidemic and their loved
ones.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
