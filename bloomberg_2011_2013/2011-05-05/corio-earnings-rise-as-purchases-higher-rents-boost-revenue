Corio NV (CORA) , the largest Dutch real-
estate company, said first-quarter profit excluding items rose
18 percent as acquisitions and rent increases lifted revenue.  Earnings excluding changes in asset values and deferred
tax, known as the direct result, increased to 66.2 million euros
($97 million), or 73 cents a share, the Utrecht-based company
said in an e-mailed statement today. A year earlier, earnings
totaled 56 million euros, or 73 cents a share.  Corio predicted little change in the direct result this
year on a per share basis following last year’s 600 million-euro
rights offering and dividend payments in stock. Chief Executive
Officer Gerard Groener is focusing the company on large shopping
centers, where retail sales have been stronger than the national
average in the countries where it owns property.  Net rental income rose 19 percent to 98 million euros in
the first quarter. Mall acquisitions worth 1.25 billion euros
last year, including a stake in  Italy ’s largest center, boosted
rental income by 17.7 million euros.  Corio’s real estate appreciated by a net 30.1 million
euros, lifting net income to 87.1 million euros, or 96 cents a
share, from 43.2 million euros, or 56 cents, a year earlier.  Net asset value rose 1.9 percent from the end of 2010 to
47.71 euros a share.  Corio raised 29.2 million euros from disposals during the
first quarter, following the sale of the Passage Provence Opera
in Paris and the Liekeblom in Leek, the Netherlands.  Corio advanced 13.5 cents to 47.57 euros in Amsterdam
trading, lifting the value of the company to 4.3 billion euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
