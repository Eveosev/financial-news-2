Veolia Environnement SA (VIE) , the world’s
biggest water utility, said it will miss its 2011 net income
growth target, hurt by operations in  Italy  and the U.S. Shares
fell as much as 8.4 percent, the most in more than a year.  The Paris-based company, which supplies water to about 110
million people worldwide and collects and manages trash for
about 50 million, said weaker business in Southern Europe and
also in North Africa is forcing it to review assets. For the
first half, Veolia is taking asset impairments and writedowns of
about 800 million euros ($1.14 billion), it said in a statement.  “The warning will trigger a 10 percent earnings-per-share
downward revision,” Damien de Saint-Germain and Arnaud Joan,
analysts in Paris at Credit Agricole SA’s Cheuvreux securities
unit, wrote in a note to investors.  Veolia Chief Executive Officer Antoine Frerot has been
selling assets to cut debt following a 2007 and 2008 acquisition
spree by former CEO  Henri Proglio , who has since moved to head
Electricite de France SA. Veolia’s divestments and partnerships
in the first half exceeded 1 billion euros, giving it more than
400 million euros in  capital gains , it said. The company expects
at least 1.3 billion euros in divestments for the full year.  Veolia fell as much as 1.46 euros in its biggest intraday
drop since May 14, 2010. It traded down 1.34 euros, or 7.7
percent, as of 10:52 a.m. in Paris. Before today, the stock had
declined 22 percent this year.  Unveil Plans  Veolia plans to unveil details of its reorganization plans
during its earnings presentation on Aug. 4, it said.  The company said it expects adjusted operating income, not
including Veolia Transdev, to “decline slightly” from last
year at constant exchange rates. Veolia Transdev provides public
transportation in 28 countries.  In March, Veolia said it expected to post an increase in
2011 net income and a 4 percent to 8 percent rise in adjusted 
operating income.  “Taking into account the operational results during the
first half and consequences of new restructuring plans, for 2011
the company will not attain the objective of net income
growth,” Veolia said in the statement.  The company maintained its 2011 objectives of internal
revenue growth, 250 million euros in annual cost savings and
positive  cash flow  after dividend payments.  Veolia’s smaller competitor, Suez Environnement SA -- the
No. 2 water company -- reported an increase in first-quarter
profit amid an improvement in European waste collection and
treatment. The utilities were among waste and water companies to
suffer a slump in earnings in 2009 as the recession forced
industrial clients to idle factories.  To contact the reporter on this story:
