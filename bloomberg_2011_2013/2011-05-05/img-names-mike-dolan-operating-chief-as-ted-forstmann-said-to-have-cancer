IMG Worldwide Inc. , the sports agency
that represents Tiger Woods and  Roger Federer , appointed Mike Dolan to chief operating officer after Chief Executive Officer
Ted Forstmann was said to be undergoing treatment for  brain
cancer .  Dolan, 64, chief financial officer of New York-based IMG,
will take on the newly created responsibilities to ensure
“effective day-to-day management of the company,” according to
a memo sent to IMG employees obtained by Bloomberg News. Dolan
will also continue to serve as CFO until he names a successor,
Jim Gallagher, spokesman for IMG, said today.  Forstmann, 71, the dealmaker who helped create the
leveraged buyout business, has had surgery and is undergoing
treatment for brain cancer, a person familiar with the matter
said yesterday. He is still coming to the office every day,
Gallagher said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
