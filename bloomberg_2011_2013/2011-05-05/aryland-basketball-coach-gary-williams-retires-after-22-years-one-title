University of Maryland  basketball
coach Gary Williams will retire after 22 seasons at his alma
mater that included the program’s only national title.  The Terrapins were 19-14 last season, including 7-9 in the
Atlantic Coast Conference, and didn’t make the national
tournament field.  “It’s the right time,” Williams, 66, said in a statement
on the  College Park , Maryland-based school’s athletic website.
“My entire career has been an unbelievable blessing. I am
fiercely proud of the program we have built here. I couldn’t
have asked any more from my players, my assistant coaches, the
great Maryland fans and this great university. Together, we did
something very special here.”  Plans to hire Williams’s successor weren’t disclosed. He’ll
speak at a news conference tomorrow afternoon and remain with
the school as assistant athletic director and special assistant
under Kevin Anderson.  The announcement comes the day after sophomore forward
Jordan Williams, who is not related to the coach, disclosed his
plans to remain in the National Basketball Association draft and
skip his final two seasons at  Maryland .  Gary Williams is 668-380 in 33 seasons as a head coach,
with stints at American University,  Boston College  and Ohio
State. He led Maryland to 14 National Collegiate Athletic
Association tournament appearances in the past 18 seasons and
won the national championship in 2002, beating  Indiana  in the
final.  To contact the reporter on this story:
