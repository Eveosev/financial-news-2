South African business confidence fell
in April on concern global economic growth will be lower than
expected this year, while borrowing costs begin to rise, the
Chamber of Commerce and Industry said.  The Business Confidence Index declined to 86.9 from 88.3 in
March, the Johannesburg-based chamber said today in an e-mailed
statement. The index is compiled from 13 economic indicators
including retail sales, inflation and financial gauges, such as
the  stock index  and the currency.  “Lower economic growth than expected, increasing
inflation, fiscal tightening and rising  interest rates  became
more prevalent,” it said. “The world economy appears to be
slowing down and closing another window of opportunity.”  U.S. economic growth slowed more than forecast in the first
quarter as  government spending  declined by the most since 1983
and household purchases cooled. Gross domestic product rose at a
1.8 percent annual rate from January through March after a 3.1
percent pace in the final three months of 2010. Economists
projected 2 percent growth, according to the median estimate in
a Bloomberg News survey. Meanwhile,  China  increased interest
rates.  “The forecasted growth of 4.4 percent for the world
economy by the IMF in its World Economic Outlook published in
April 2011 is optimistic and might already be suspect,” the
chamber said.  The chamber called on the government to improve its
efficiency and the provision of services, rather than increase
its role in the economy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
