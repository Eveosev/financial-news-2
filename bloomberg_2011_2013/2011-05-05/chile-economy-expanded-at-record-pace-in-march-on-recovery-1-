Chile ’s economy may expand more than 6
percent this year after data for March showed the country is on
“a robust growth trend,” Finance Minister Felipe Larrain said.  Chileans are feeling the benefits of growth of almost 10
percent in the first quarter, with real salaries rising
“significantly,” Larrain told reporters today in Santiago.  Chile’s economy grew a record 15.2 percent in March from a
year earlier, when the country was recovering from an 8.8-
magnitude earthquake, the central bank said on its website
today. The economy expanded 0.3 percent from the previous month
on a seasonally adjusted basis on gains in the manufacturing,
retail, transport and aquaculture industries, the bank said.  The peso fell 0.4 percent to 467.92 per  U.S. dollar  at
10:06 a.m. New York time.  Chile’s economy grew 9.7 percent in the three months
through March, the fastest quarterly pace in more than a decade,
according to Bloomberg calculations based on central bank data.  Economic growth will slow in coming quarters as monetary
and fiscal policies become less expansive, the  International
Monetary Fund  said in a May 3 report on  Latin America  and the
Caribbean.  Output in  South America ’s fifth-largest economy will rise
5.9 percent in 2011 and 4.9 percent next year, the Washington-
based lender said.  Chile’s central bank has raised its benchmark interest rate
at 10 of its last 11 meetings from a record-low 0.5 percent to
today’s 4.5 percent. Policy makers will continue to remove the
monetary stimulus in coming months, the bank said in a statement
accompanying its April decision.  To contact the reporter on this story:
