Croatian central bank Governor Zeljko Rohatinski said an anticipated rise in bank loans this year will
pull the economy out of a two-year recession in a “long, slow
path to recovery.”  Gross domestic product will grow 1 percent this year,
Rohatinski said, compared with the government’s estimate for
growth of 1.5 percent made in November. The central government
budget deficit will narrow to 6 percent of GDP, Rohatinski said.  “There are some positive indicators, primarily in
increased credit activity by banks, but our recovery will be
long and slow as we had anticipated,” Rohatinski said today at
an economic conference in Opatija, an Adriatic Sea resort in
northern  Croatia .  Banks are expected to increase loans this year 9.5 percent
to 26 billion kuna ($5.2 billion), which would boost domestic
consumption and investment, Rohatinski said.  Accelerating inflation could reach 3 percent this year and
threaten the fragile recovery and domestic consumption,
Rohatinski said.  “Fiscal consolidation and structural reforms are a
prerequisite for sustainable growth,” Rohatinski said. The
government needs to continue its 2010 program of economic
recovery that seeks investors for projects totalling 14 billion
euros ($20 billion).  The Adriatic Sea nation is in the final stage of talks with
the European Union and hopes to join the bloc in 2012 or early
2013.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
