European stocks fell for a third day
as bank earnings disappointed, commodities plunged and a jump in
U.S. jobless-benefit claims fueled concern that the recovery of
the world’s largest economy may falter.  Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY)  slumped the most in almost a year
after reporting a quarterly loss. Societe Generale SA,  France ’s
second-largest bank by market value, dropped 5 percent as profit
missed analyst estimates.  Fresnillo Plc (FRES) , the world’s biggest
primary silver producer, and  Essar Energy Plc (ESSR)  sank more than 4
percent as the Standard & Poor’s GSCI Index of 24 raw materials
tumbled the most in almost two years.  The Stoxx  Europe  600 Index decreased 0.3 percent to 277.79
at the 4:30 p.m. close in  London , completing the longest losing
streak in seven weeks. The measure has fallen 2.2 percent over
the past three days after climbing to a two-month high on May 2.  “Investors on both sides of the Atlantic are wary of some
disappointing results in the banking sector and the selling is
dragging down European indexes,” said Michael Scholz, equity
strategist at WestLB AG in Dusseldorf. “The bears may enter the
driving seat if they win today.”  National benchmarks fell in 14 of the 18 western European
markets. The U.K. FTSE 100 slid 1.1 percent and France’s CAC
declined 1 percent.  Germany ’s DAX was little changed as  Adidas
AG (ADS)  rallied.  U.S. Economy  The number of claims for U.S. unemployment benefits
unexpectedly rose last week, pushed up by auto-plant shutdowns
and other unusual events that seasonal variations failed to take
into account. Applications for jobless benefits jumped by 43,000
to 474,000 in the week ended April 30, the most since August,
Labor Department figures showed. The data comes before
tomorrow’s monthly payrolls report.  Factory orders in Germany, Europe’s largest economy,
unexpectedly dropped in March, led by a slump in demand for
investment goods at home and abroad. Orders, adjusted for
seasonal swings and inflation, slid 4 percent from February, the
Economy Ministry in Berlin said.  European stocks pared their decline as European Central
Bank President  Jean-Claude Trichet  said inflation risks will be
watched “very closely,” signaling the ECB may wait until after
June to raise  interest rates  again. The ECB and the  Bank of
England  both kept their benchmark rates unchanged today, as
forecast by all economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  Lloyds Slides  A gauge of banks in the Stoxx 600 fell for a fourth day as
Lloyds retreated 8 percent to 53.38 pence, the biggest decline
since May last year. Britain’s largest mortgage lender swung
into loss in the first quarter after setting aside 3.2 billion
pounds ($5.3 billion) to compensate clients mis-sold insurance
on loans.  Societe Generale (GLE)  lost 5 percent to 43.26 euros, the largest
drop in 10 months. The French bank said first-quarter profit
fell 14 percent, hurt by a charge tied to its own debt and
provisions resulting from political turmoil in  Egypt . Net income
of 916 million euros missed the 1.06 billion-euro average
estimate of 10 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Fresnillo slid 4.6 percent to 1,445 pence for the biggest
two-day drop since January 2010. Silver for July delivery in  New
York  fell as much as 9.6 percent to $35.60 an ounce, taking
losses to more than 25 percent since the metal peaked on April
25 at the highest level since 1980.  Essar Energy, the operator of  India ’s second-largest
private refinery, lost 5.2 percent to 427.6 pence, an eight-
month low.  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) , Europe’s biggest oil company,
retreated 1.8 percent to 2,235.5 pence. Crude for June delivery
dropped as much as 7.5 percent to $101.80 a barrel on the  New
York Mercantile Exchange .  Schroders, Skanska  Schroders Plc (SDR)  plummeted 9.2 percent to 1,700 pence, the
biggest drop in more than two years, after the largest publicly
traded U.K. fund manager published earnings that missed some
estimates. Evolution Securities downgraded the shares to “add”
from “buy.”  Skanska AB (SKAB)  tumbled 4.3 percent to 122.90 kronor after the
Nordic region’s biggest builder said first-quarter order
bookings declined.  Actelion Ltd. (ATLN) , a Swiss biotechnology company, plunged 5.8
percent to 45.06 francs after shareholders rejected a hedge
fund’s proposal for a special investigation into whether the
company received expressions of interest from potential
acquirers.  Adidas Advances  Adidas surged 7.3 percent to 53.50 euros, the highest price
since its 1995 initial public offering. The world’s second-
largest sporting-goods maker said first-quarter profit rose as
it sold more Reebok fitness shoes and generated higher revenue
in emerging markets.  TGS-Nopec Geophysical Co. ASA soared 6.3 percent to 136.70
kroner, the biggest gain in almost three months. The Norwegian
surveyor of  oil deposits  had first-quarter net income of $41.6
million, compared with $42 million a year earlier. That beat the
$31.7 million average of 12 analyst estimates compiled by
Bloomberg.  ING Groep NV (INGA) , the largest Dutch financial services company,
rose 1.6 percent to 8.93 euros. First-quarter profit increased
12 percent as earnings at the insurance unit almost quadrupled.
Net income climbed to 1.38 billion euros, exceeding the 1.25
billion-euro average projection of eight analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg.  Diageo Plc (DGE) , the world’s largest distiller, advanced 1.5
percent to 1,230 pence. Organic sales, which exclude
acquisitions and disposals, rose 7 percent in the three months
ended March 31 as sales of Scotch whisky in emerging markets
offset sluggish demand in Europe. That outpaced the median
estimate of eight analysts for growth of 3.3 percent and the 4
percent growth reported in the first half.  To contact the reporter on this story:
