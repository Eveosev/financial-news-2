China ’s planned resource tax on the
sale of oil and gas may be as high as 10 percent, Shanghai
Securities News reported, citing a government document it
obtained.  The government may levy a tax of 5 percent to 10 percent of
sales value, according to an amendment to temporary regulations
on the matter, the newspaper reported, without giving details on
a timeframe or geographical regions for implementation.  China has proposed a nationwide resource tax to raise funds
to develop the poorer western regions, which are rich in oil,
gas and coal reserves. The government first introduced a trial
tax of 5 percent in Xinjiang province in June, which it widened
to other western provinces a month later. It hasn’t announced
final plans for the entire country.  Coal will still be taxed by volume rather than  price
levels , according to Shanghai Securities, which is owned by the
official Xinhua News Agency. The tax may be raised to between
0.3 yuan and 8 yuan a metric ton from 0.3 yuan to 5 yuan, the
newspaper said, citing the amended rules.  Nationwide introduction of the taxes may be delayed because
of inflation concerns, the Shanghai-based newspaper reported,
citing unidentified people.  Hu Jinglin, a spokesman for the  finance ministry , and Li Pumin, a spokesman at the National Development and Reform
Commission, didn’t answer three calls made to their offices.  To contact the reporter on this story:
