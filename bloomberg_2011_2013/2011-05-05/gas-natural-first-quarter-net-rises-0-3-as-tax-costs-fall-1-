Gas Natural SDG SA (GAS) , Spain’s largest
gas company, said first-quarter profit rose 0.3 percent after
tax costs declined.  Net income climbed to 387 million euros ($576 million) from
386 million euros in same period last year, the Barcelona-based
company said today in a regulatory filing. That missed a 406
million-euro mean estimate in a Bloomberg survey of 10 analysts.
Tax costs fell to 144 million euros from 165 million euros.  Gas Natural is challenging a ruling by an arbitration court
that recognized the right of Algerian state-controlled Sonatrach
to boost the price of gas supplied to Spain since 2007 through
the Maghreb Europe pipeline. The decision may mean Gas Natural
has to pay as much as $1.97 billion for previous periods,
according to the company.  “Gas Natural and  Sonatrach  are in negotiations about the
price revisions foreseen in the contracts, and a beneficial
result is expected for both parts to settle this controversy
definitely,” Gas Natural said in a statement today.  The Spanish company on Feb. 22 said it made a provision to
cover the dispute with Sonatrach. Sonatrach must accept “market
reality” in a dispute over the price of gas, Gas Natural Chief
Executive Officer Rafael Villaseca said on April 14. Gas Natural
buys about a third of its gas from Sonatrach under long-term
contracts that run through 2021 and stipulate prices should be
revised every three years.  Maghreb Pipeline  The Maghreb pipeline crosses  Morocco  and extends into  Spain 
and  Portugal .  Algeria , a member of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries, has a production capacity of 1.4 million
barrels a day of oil and exports about 60 billion cubic meters a
year of gas. Spain also imports liquefied natural gas  by ship
via six regasification terminals.  Shares of Gas Natural slipped 0.2 percent to 13.57 euros at
10:48 a.m. in Madrid. Gas Natural has climbed more than 18
percent this year, giving the company a market value of 12.5
billion euros.  Gas Natural targets net income of about 1.5 billion euros
in 2012 and earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and
amortization of more than 5 billion euros. Ebitda rose 0.2
percent to 1.296 billion euros in the first quarter, the company
said today. The company in July said it aimed to boost dividends
by at least 10 percent a year on average from 2010 to 2014.  Cutting Debt  The Spanish company plans to invest at a slower pace
through 2012 as it tries to cut debt following the acquisition
of the Union Fenosa SA utility in 2009, through which it gained
access to gas-liquefaction and regasification plants as well as
electricity-generation capacity. Average annual gross investment
will fall to 1.8 billion euros a year from 2010 through 2012,
Gas Natural said July 27.  Net debt fell to 18.2 billion euros at the end of March
from 21.1 billion euros a year earlier. Villaseca on April 14
said he aims to reduce Gas Natural’s net debt to about 15.5
billion euros by the end of 2012. The pace of investment may
then double to as much as 3.9 billion a year in 2013 and 2014,
he said.  Gas Natural last month agreed to sell its 800-megawatt gas-
fired power plant at Arrubal in northern Spain to ContourGlobal
for 313 million euros as part of a plan to meet competition
rules after buying Fenosa.  Gas Natural had electricity generation capacity of 17,305
megawatts in Spain and abroad at the end of December. So-called
combined cycle power plants accounted for 63 percent of
capacity, hydropower 11 percent and coal-fired plants 12
percent. Spanish gas demand fell 0.3 percent in 2010 after an 11
percent drop in 2009.  The company has said it may add 1,200 megawatts of
renewable-energy capacity in Spain by 2014 and forecasts its
installed capacity will range between 15,600 megawatts and
17,700 megawatts in 2014.  To contact the reporter on this story:
