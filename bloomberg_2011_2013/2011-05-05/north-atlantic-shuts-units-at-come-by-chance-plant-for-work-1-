Several hundred contract workers who
lost their jobs at Korea National Oil Corp.’s Come by Chance
refinery in Newfoundland were joined by other plant workers in a
peaceful protest outside the gates, police said.  About 300 unionized workers were fired late yesterday and
about 400 employees were at the site today, Ren Osmond, a staff
sergeant with the  Royal Canadian Mounted Police , said in a
telephone interview from nearby Clarenville.  “They are all in good spirits and said they are not there
to cause any problems,” Osmond said. “The union leaders are
currently on site there speaking to company officials to try to
resolve the situation.”  The refinery hired contract workers from Jacobs Engineering
of Calgary for a maintenance turnaround on its crude and isomax
units which began May 5 and was expected to last two months,
Gloria Slade, a spokeswoman for the plant, said in a telephone
interview. Slade declined to comment further, calling it a
“contractor issue.”  Jacobs referred all questions to Michelle Jones, a
spokeswoman in  Pasadena ,  California . Jones did not immediately
return voicemail left by Bloomberg News.  Members of the United Steelworkers Union at the plant were
not involved in the protest, Charlie Scibetta, a union
spokesman, said in a telephone interview from Toronto.  To contact the reporter on this story:
