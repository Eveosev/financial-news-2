U.S. Gulf oil grades weakened as the
spread between the U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate and
Brent narrowed.  The gap between WTI and its European counterpart for June
delivery decreased $1.05 to $10.90 a barrel at 3:09 p.m. in  New
York , the smallest in a month.  When Brent declines versus WTI, it decreases the value of
low-sulfur U.S. grades that compete with West African oil priced
against the European grade.  Heavy Louisiana Sweet’s premium to WTI weakened 25 cents to
$13.75 a barrel at 12:11 p.m. in New York, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Light Louisiana Sweet’s premium gained 10
cents to $14.60 over the benchmark.  Among sour, or high-sulfur, grades, the premium for Mars
Blend narrowed 25 cents to $6 a barrel over WTI. Poseidon’s
premium weakened 20 cents to $6.20.  Thunder Horse’s premium gained 15 cents to $10.35 a barrel
over WTI. Southern Green Canyon’s premium lost 25 cents to $4 a
barrel.  West  Texas  Sour’s discount narrowed 2 cents to $2.72 a
barrel. It has tracked more closely to its historical average
discount versus WTI because it’s delivered in Midland, Texas,
away from the  Gulf Coast  and close to Cushing,  Oklahoma , the
delivery point for oil traded on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange .  The premium for Syncrude gained $2 at $13 a barrel.
Syncrude is a light, low-sulfur synthetic oil derived from the
 tar sands  in Alberta.  The discount for Western Canada Select widened 20 cents to
$16.50 a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
