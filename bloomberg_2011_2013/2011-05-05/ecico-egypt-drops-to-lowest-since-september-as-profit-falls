as sales declined.  The shares slid 2.6 percent to 15.11 Egyptian pounds at the
2:30 p.m. close in Cairo, the lowest since Sept. 20. The
benchmark  EGX 30 Index (EGX30)  fell 0.9 percent.  Lecico said today net income fell to 12.5 million pounds
($2.1 million) from 26.9 million pounds in the year-earlier
period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
