Turkish Islamic banks and smaller
lenders are offering rates of returns on deposits that are as
much as three percentage points greater than those offered by
larger banks, Haberturk reported.  The banks are offering rates of as much as 10 percent
annually to help raise funds for lending after the central bank
increased reserve requirements four times since December to slow
loan growth, the Istanbul-based newspaper said. Larger banks in
 Turkey  are offering rates of no more than 7 percent, it said.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
