An “all out” Greek debt default and
restructuring is unlikely before 2013, according to the RCM unit
of Allianz Global Investors  “European policy makers are still keen to avoid the
significant fallout from a possible default, with the European
banking sector in particular still in recovery mode,” Andreas Utermann, the global chief investment officer at RCM, wrote in
an e-mailed note today. “The required primary-budget surplus in
the area of 8 percent of gross domestic product is difficult to
achieve, but policy makers will try to buy time.”  Greek bond yields and the cost of insuring the country’s
securities against default rose to records last week, rekindling
concern that a debt write-off or extension of repayment terms
may be needed to ease the nation’s fiscal crisis.  Greece ’s refinancing needs of 58 billion euros are covered
this year by the loan package from the European Union and
 International Monetary Fund . Next year, Greece is supposed to
regain  market access  and refinance at least three-quarters of
its maturing medium- and long-term debt, and then fully fund
debt rollovers beginning in mid-2013.  Utermann said Greece is likely to take “small steps” to
reduce its debt burden by asking the bailout fund to cut
borrowing costs further and then lengthening repayment periods.  “A hasty restructuring could lead to a new financial
crisis, as the  European Central Bank  has repeatedly pointed out,
with banks, especially in Greece, taking a hit because of write-
offs on their bond positions,” he said.  The extra yield investors demand for holding 10-year Greek
bonds instead of similar-maturity German bunds, the region’s
benchmark government securities, rose to 12.26 percentage points
as of 3:03 p.m. in  London , from 9.51 percentage points at the
end of 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
