HeidelbergCement AG (HEI) , the world’s
third-largest maker of cement and concrete, said operating
profit rose 48 percent in the first quarter on lower expenses
and as mild winter weather helped demand in  Europe .  Operating income before depreciation rose to 253 million
euros ($376 million) from 171 million euros a year earlier, the
Heidelberg, Germany-based company said in a statement today.
Sales rose 19 percent to 2.6 billion euros. Analysts in a
Bloomberg survey had estimated operating profit of 229.5 million
euros on sales of 2.43 billion euros.  “The mild winter and the sustained economic recovery in
our European markets led to a significant improvement in
demand,” Chief Executive Officer  Bernd Scheifele  said in the
release.  HeidelbergCement improved profitability faster than rivals
following a construction slump after lowering costs and
streamlining operations. Standard and Poor’s raised the
company’s credit rating on March 18 and said it expects the
company continues cost savings. The rating company one day
earlier downgraded the rating of French rival  Lafarge SA (LG)  to
junk, after the industry leader failed to reduce debt enough.  HeidelbergCement’s net loss in the quarter narrowed to 161
million euros, from 198.9 million euros a year earlier. Net debt
fell to 8.63 billion euros, after 8.96 billion euros last year.
HeidelbergCement aims to cut debt by about 500 million euros
this year, the company said in March. It reiterated a target
today of increasing sales and operating profit in 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
