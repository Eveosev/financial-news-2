ING Groep NV (INGA) , the biggest Dutch
financial-services company, reported a 12 percent increase in
first-quarter profit that beat analystsâ€™ estimates as earnings
at the insurance UNIT almost quadrupled.  Net income rose to 1.38 billion euros ($2.05 billion) from
1.23 billion euros in the first three months of 2010. Profit
beat the 1.25 billion-euro average projection of eight analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg. Year-earlier figures were restated
because of a change in accounting policy related to the U.S.
insurance operations.  WATCH TO WATCH:
