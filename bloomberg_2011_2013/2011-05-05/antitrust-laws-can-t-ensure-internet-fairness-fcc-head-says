Antitrust laws alone can’t ensure the
free flow of information on the Internet, U.S. Federal
Communications Commission Chairman  Julius Genachowski  told a
House panel.  Genachowski today defended the FCC’s decision in December
to ban  Internet service providers  led by  AT&T Inc. (T)  and  Comcast
Corp. (CMCSA)  from blocking or slowing Web content sent to home and
businesses.  Congress should let the so-called net-neutrality rules take
hold, the Democratic chairman said in prepared remarks to a
House Judiciary antitrust subcommittee.  “To undo our framework would increase uncertainty,
decrease investment and hurt  job creation ,” he said.
“Antitrust laws alone would not adequately preserve the freedom
and openness of the Internet.”  FCC Commissioner Robert McDowell, a Republican, said he
opposes the rules in part because the antitrust laws are
“sufficient” to guard against any curtailing of information.
The FCC’s December order “is likely to do more harm than
good,” he said in prepared remarks to the subcommittee.  The rules let mobile-phone companies put limits on traffic
and affirm that providers may charge subscribers based on how
much data they consume. The pricing issue has become more
important as companies including  Netflix Inc. (NFLX)  stream movies and
other data-filled content over the Web.  Congressional Republicans such as Senate Minority Leader
 Mitch McConnell  of Kentucky have said the rules were a step in
controlling Internet use.  To contact the reporter on this story:
