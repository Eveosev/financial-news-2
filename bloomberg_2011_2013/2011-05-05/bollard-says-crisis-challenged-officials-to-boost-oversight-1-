Central banks are placing a greater
emphasis on using monetary and financial-stability policies in
tandem after the global financial crisis, according to  Reserve
Bank  of New Zealand Governor Alan Bollard.  The crisis “challenged traditional economic forecasting
models and moved central banks to pay greater attention to
financial-market information when formulating monetary policy,”
Bollard said in notes for a  speech  in  Singapore  today released
by e-mail.  The goal is to set monetary and financial policy
instruments that take account of the relationship between the
financial system and the economy, Bollard said. Central banks
are now more readily swapping information with regulators and
improving relationships with Treasuries and finance ministers,
he said.  The speech to the Sim Kee Boon Institute for Financial
Economics forum is being delivered later today by RBNZ assistant
governor John McDermott after Bollard was unable to travel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
