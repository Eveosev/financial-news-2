Denmark ’s opposition Socialist
People’s Party warned the Radical Liberals, also part of the
opposition, it can’t stay in the bloc if the party signs an
agreement with the government of Prime Minister Lars Loekke
Rasmussen on phasing out early retirement, Danmarks Radio
reported.  The Radical Liberals support Rasmussen’s proposal to end
early retirement, a key component of the government’s so-called
2020 plan of economic reforms. The party is the only
representative from the opposition continuing talks with the
government.  Denmark must hold parliamentary elections by November, when
the government’s four-year term expires. Most polls show the
opposition, led by Social Democrat leader Helle Thorning-
Schmidt, as likely to win the vote.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
