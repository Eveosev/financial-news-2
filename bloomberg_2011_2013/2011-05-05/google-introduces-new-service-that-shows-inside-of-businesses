Google Inc. (GOOG) , the world’s largest
Internet-search company, introduced a feature that builds on its
mapping services by letting users see what a business looks like
from the inside.  The service will be available next week in the U.S., Japan
and other countries, Mountain View, California-based Google said
today. The feature, part of Google’s Places service for local
businesses, will let owners showcase 360-degree views of their
shops’ interiors.  “We go into their business and shoot photos,”  Marissa Mayer , vice president of  product management , said at a
technology conference in San Francisco. Google captures the
images only with a business owner’s permission, she said.  Google is adding features that may help it lure small-
business advertisers and vie with local-review site Yelp Inc.,
social-networking leader Facebook Inc. and such daily-deal
providers as Groupon Inc. and LivingSocial.com.  Google announced a marketing program last month in
 Portland , Oregon, that offers discounts from local companies.  Google fell $1.52 to $534.27 at 4 p.m. New York time on the
Nasdaq Stock Market. The shares have declined 10 percent this
year.  Separately, Mayer said Google is looking at small and large
acquisitions in location-based services. She also reiterated
that the company isn’t tracking the location of individual
users.  To contact the reporter on this story:
