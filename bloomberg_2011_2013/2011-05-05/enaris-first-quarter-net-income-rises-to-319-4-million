Tenaris SA (TS) , the world’s largest maker
of seamless pipes, said first-quarter profit rose 46 percent as
drilling increased.  Net income gained to $319.4 million, or 54 cents per
American depositary receipt, from $219.5 million, or 37 cents, a
year earlier, the company based in Luxembourg, said today in a
statement.  Revenue from  North America , Tenaris’s biggest market,
climbed 14 percent to $978.5 million, while sales in the Middle
East and Africa were little changed at $297.8 million.  “Results declined all along 2010 up to the low point last
quarter, and this is the start of the recovery,” Christian Reos, an analyst with brokerage Allaria Ledesma said in a May 4
telephone interview. Reos rates the stock a “hold,” and
doesn’t own any.  Tenaris fell $1.29, or 2.7 percent, to close at $46.64 in
New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The earnings report
was released after the close of regular trading in North
American markets. The shares have climbed 21 percent in the past
year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
