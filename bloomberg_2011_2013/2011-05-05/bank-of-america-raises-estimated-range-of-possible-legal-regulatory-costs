Bank of America Corp. (BAC) , the lender
facing lawsuits and probes by state attorneys general tied to
its mortgage business, increased its estimate for costs that may
result from legal complaints and regulatory matters.  Losses may range from $150 million to $1.6 billion in
excess of accrued liability, the Charlotte, North Carolina-based
company said today in a regulatory  filing  that covered the first
quarter of this year. The range cited after the fourth quarter
of 2010 was $145 million to $1.5 billion.  Bank of America is among five of the largest U.S. mortgage
servicers being targeted by state attorneys general for faulty
foreclosure practices. Last month, the lender signed a consent
order with U.S. regulators that requires better  customer service 
for overdue borrowers and a halt to foreclosure proceedings if a
mortgage is being modified.  “Excluding fees paid to external legal service providers,
litigation-related expense of $940 million was recognized in the
three months ended March 31, 2011 compared to $588 million for
the same period in 2010,” according to the filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
