Syria â€™s wheat output will increase 33
percent to more than 4.1 million metric tons this year,  Thawra
newspaper  said, citing an official from the Ministry of
Agriculture.  The Arab country planted wheat over a 1.88 million hectare
(4.65 million acres) area this year, said Abdel Moeen Qadhamani,
head of plantations production at the ministry.  In 2010, wheat output dropped 17 percent from the prior
year to 3.08 million tons as the fungal disease known as yellow
rust hit the crop, the Agriculture Ministry said Feb. 16. The
government had estimated production to reach 4.5 million tons
last year, it said.  Syria also increased the purchase price of wheat from
farmers by 1 Syrian pound ($0.02) to encourage the local
production of wheat, it said. The government will now buy hard
wheat at 21 pounds and soft wheat at 21.5 pounds, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
