Frontier Oil Corp. (FTO)  expects crude
throughput at its El Dorado refinery in  Kansas  to average
127,000 barrels a day in the second quarter, a company executive
said in an earnings conference call.  The crude rate at the Houston-based company’s Cheyenne
refinery in  Wyoming  is expected to average 44,000 barrels a day
in the same time period, Jim Stump, vice president of refining
operations, said during the call.  Heavy crude is expected to make up 25 percent of the oil
processed at the Kansas refinery in the second quarter,
according to Stump. Heavy crude will make up about 57 percent of
the crude slate at the company’s Cheyenne refinery in Wyoming,
in the same time period.  A liquefied petroleum gas project at the Cheyenne refinery
will be ready to be tied in with the plant by late June or early
July, according to Rogers. Shutdowns associated with the tie-in
will cut gasoline production between 80,000 and 90,000 barrels,
he said.  The tie-in may be delayed until August or September when
the plant expects to perform regeneration work on a reformer at
the Wyoming plant, according to Rogers.  Frontier’s El Dorado refinery has a capacity of 135,000
barrels a day, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
capacity at Cheyenne is 52,000.  To contact the reporter on this story:
