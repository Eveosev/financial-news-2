Viacom Inc. (VIA/B)  said Judy McGrath, who
joined the company’s MTV cable channel as a copywriter in 1981,
is resigning as chairman and chief executive officer of the MTV
Networks division, effective immediately.  A successor won’t be named, the New York-based company said
today in a statement. Unit heads under McGrath, 58, including
MTV Entertainment Group President Doug Herzog, will report to
Viacom CEO Philippe Dauman. The decision to leave was hers, the
company said.  The division McGrath has led since July 2004 accounts for
the majority of Viacom’s annual sales and created shows
including “SpongeBob SquarePants,” “The Daily Show with  Jon Stewart ” and “The Colbert Report.” Cable networks led Viacom
to a 53 percent profit gain in the quarter ended March 31.  Viacom, controlled by Chairman  Sumner Redstone , fell 5
cents to $50.27 at 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite
trading. The Class B shares have gained 27 percent this year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
