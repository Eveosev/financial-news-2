Cocoa tumbled the most in five weeks
in  New York  on bets that a large crop in West Africa will add to
supplies boosted by the resumption of exports from  Ivory Coast ,
the world’s largest producer. Sugar and coffee also fell.  William Venables, the head of cocoa trading at Armajaro
Trading Ltd., said yesterday that the smaller of two seasonal
West African crops will be “pretty good.” Ivorian shipments
may be returning to normal after exports ceased amid a civil war
following a disputed presidential election. A cargo of 8,000
metric tons arrived in Belgium this week.  “You have rumors of good supply across the board, which is
weighing on the market,” said Drew Geraghty, a broker at ICAP
Futures LLC in  Jersey City ,  New Jersey . “The fundamentals are
causing weakness.”  Cocoa for July delivery slid $156, or 4.9 percent, to
settle at $3,055 a ton at 11:57 a.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in New
York, the biggest drop since March 29.  In London, cocoa futures for July delivery fell 60 pounds,
or 3.1 percent, to 1,885 pounds ($3,094) a ton on NYSE Liffe.  Raw-sugar futures for July delivery dropped 0.49 cent, or
2.3 percent, to 20.86 cents a pound in New York. Refined-sugar
futures for August delivery fell $10.40, or 1.8 percent, to
$582.30 a ton in London.  Arabica-coffee futures for July delivery slid 6.25 cents,
or 2.1 percent, to $2.8825 a pound in New York. Robusta-coffee
futures for July delivery gained $5, or 0.2 percent, to $2,582 a
ton in  London .  To contact the reporters on this story:
