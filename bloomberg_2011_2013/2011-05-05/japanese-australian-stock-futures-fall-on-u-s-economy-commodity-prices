Japanese and Australian  stock futures 
fell as slower growth in U.S. service industries, rising jobless
claims and the biggest plunge in commodity prices in almost two
years fueled concern the global economy is stalling.  American depositary receipts of  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) , the
world’s largest carmaker, lost 2.8 percent from the closing
share price in Tokyo.  Canon Inc. (7751) , a camera maker that gets more
than 80 percent of its revenue overseas, sank 3 percent after
the yen strengthened, cutting the earnings outlook for exporters.
ADRs of  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , Australia’s No.1 oil producer and the
world’s biggest mining company, retreated 2.9 percent.  Futures on Japan’s  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average expiring in
June closed at 9,765 in  Chicago  yesterday, compared with 9,875
in Singapore. Japanese markets were closed from May 3 to 5 for
national holidays. The futures were bid in the pre-market at
9,800 in Osaka, at 8:05 a.m. local time. Futures on Australia’s
S&P/ASX 200 Index dropped 0.7 percent today. New Zealand’s NZX
50 Index fell 0.2 percent in Wellington.  “Investors’ optimism toward the  U.S. economy  is waning,”
said Juichi Wako, a senior strategist at Nomura Holdings Inc. in
Tokyo. “That will likely have a bad impact on Japanese
stocks.”  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index were little
changed today. In New York, the index dropped for a fourth day,
falling 0.9 percent to 1,335.10 yesterday.  U.S. Economic Data  Service industries  in the U.S. expanded in April at the
slowest pace in eight months as companies cut back in response
to higher energy costs, according to the Institute for Supply
Management’s index of U.S. non-manufacturing companies published
on May 4.  Applications for jobless benefits unexpectedly jumped by
43,000 to 474,000 in the week ended April 30, the most since
August, Labor Department figures showed yesterday.  Also, U.S. consumer confidence dropped last week to the
lowest level in more than a month as rising fuel costs squeezed
American household budgets. The Bloomberg Consumer Comfort Index
decreased to minus 46.2 in the week ended May 1, the lowest
level since the end of March, from minus 45.1 the prior period.  Commodities dropped the most in almost two years, paring
this year’s gains to 8.2 percent, on concern that economic
growth will slow as central banks seek to cool inflation by
raising borrowing costs.  Oil, Metals  Crude oil for June delivery plunged 8.6 percent to $99.80 a
barrel yesterday, the lowest settlement in New York since March
16. The London Metal Exchange Index of six metals including
copper and aluminum sank for a second day, falling 4 percent
yesterday, the biggest drop since November 16.  European Central Bank President  Jean-Claude Trichet 
signaled Yesterday the bank will wait until after June to raise
interest rates again, wrong-footing some investors who had
expected a quicker move to fight inflation. The euro plunged.  Japan ’s currency climbed versus all of its 16 most-traded
peers and reached the strongest level in six weeks against the
dollar as falling commodities prompted investors to unwind bets
in higher-yielding assets financed with yen.  The yen appreciated to as high as 79.57 against the dollar
last night in Tokyo, compared with 81.58 at the close of  stock
trading  on May 2. Against the euro, Japan’s currency
strengthened to 116.15 today from 120.66. A stronger yen reduces
overseas income at Japanese companies when converted into their
home currency.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index increased 0.8 percent this year
through yesterday, compared with gains of 6.2 percent by the  S&P
500  and 0.7 percent by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. Stocks in the
Asian benchmark are valued at 13.5 times estimated earnings on
average, compared with 13.5 times for the S&P 500 and 11.2 times
for the Stoxx 600.  To contact the reporters on this story:
