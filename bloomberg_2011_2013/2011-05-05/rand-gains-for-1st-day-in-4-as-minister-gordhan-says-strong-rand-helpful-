The rand declined to its weakest level
in more than a week against the dollar after commodity prices
dropped amid concern global growth is slowing. Bonds tumbled the
most in more than two months.  The rand depreciated as much as 1.4 percent to 6.7574 per
dollar, its weakest level since April 26, and traded 0.7 percent
weaker at 6.7112 as of 3:26 p.m. in Johannesburg. It gained 0.2
percent to 9.8758 per euro after the  European Central Bank 
signaled it wait until after June before raising rates again.  The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Index of 24 raw materials fell
as much as 2.62 percent to 712.36 points, the lowest since March
31, led by silver, sugar, cotton and  Brent crude . Gold and
platinum, South Africa’s biggest exports, also dropped for a
third day, while copper reached a five-month low.  “Commodities are lower, and that is putting pressure on
the rand,” Deon van Zyl, who oversees about 13 billion rand
($1.9 billion) of debt as head of fixed-interest investments at
Cape Town-based Metropolitan Asset Managers, said by phone.  German factory orders unexpectedly slipped in March, and
U.S. jobless claims increased, adding to signs of slowing growth
in two of the world’s biggest economies.  South Africa ’s
benchmark stock index fell as much as 1.5 percent, led by mining
companies including Anglo American Plc and BHP Billiton Ltd.  The rand extended its decline, tracking the euro lower
against the dollar, after the ECB held its benchmark interest
rate at 1.25 percent and ECB President  Jean-Claude Trichet  said
inflation risks will be watched “very closely”. The euro slid
as much as 1.2 percent against the dollar.  Dollar Strength  “It was purely dollar strength” that affected the rand,
Jim Bryson, head of foreign exchange trading at Rand Merchant
Bank, a unit of South Africa’s second-biggest bank, said by
phone from Johannesburg. “We saw the dollar coming back against
the euro.”  South African  government bonds  tumbled the most in more
than two months as the weaker rand eroded returns for foreign
investors. The 6.75 percent securities due 2021 shed 62 cents,
or0.7 percent, to 87.96 rand, the biggest one-day decline on a
closing basis since Feb. 24. The yield jumped 10 basis points to
8.58 percent, the highest since April 14.  “The weaker rand is putting pressure on bonds,”
Metropolitan’s Van Zyl said. “We’re seeing some foreigners
trying to get out of their stock.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
