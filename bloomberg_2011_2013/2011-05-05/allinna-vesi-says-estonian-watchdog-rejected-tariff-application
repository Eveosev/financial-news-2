AS Tallinna Vesi (TVEAT) ,  Estonia ’s biggest
water utility, said the country’s competition watchdog rejected
an application to increase tariffs.  The Tallinn-based company will dispute the decision, on the
ground that it violates the terms of a privatization agreement
signed in 2001, Tallinna Vesi said in a regulatory statement
today.  The Competition Board said the tariff increase can’t be
approved because of restrictions stemming from the passing of an
Anti-Monopoly law, the company said.  Last December, Tallinna Vesi lodged a complaint with the
European Commission about the adoption of the law, which allows
the competition watchdog to limit the company’s profit by
vetoing tariff applications.  The commission sent a request for information to the
Estonian authorities, setting May 3 as the deadline for a reply,
Tallinna Vesi said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
