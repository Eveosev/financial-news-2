Iranian members of parliament are
renewing a bid to summon President  Mahmoud Ahmadinejad  for
questioning over some of his policies, the state-run  Mehr  news
agency reported.  The move comes following recent reports of a rift between
Ahmadinejad and Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei -- the
country’s highest authority -- over the resignation of the
intelligence minister. Ahmadinejad, who had been absent from
official meetings for a week, denied there were conflicts when
he returned to work on May 2, without explaining his absence.  Some 90 lawmakers have signed a petition demanding
Ahmadinejad be summoned to Parliament, the report said. The
petition needs to be submitted to Parliamentary Speaker Ali Larijani before it can be considered. At least one fourth of the
290 members of parliament must sign the document.  Lawmakers also attempted to force a debate in November.  “Lawmakers decided today to put the petition back on the
table in light of recent events,” the state-run  news agency 
reported. They also want to question him over proposed funding
for the Tehran Urban and Suburban Railway Co., Mehr said.  Mohsen Hashemi, the son of former president Ali Akbar Hahemi Rafsanjani, stepped down earlier this year as managing
director of the railway, citing “restrictions” that prevented
him from carrying out his duties and a lack of funding from the
government.  To contact the reporter on this story:
