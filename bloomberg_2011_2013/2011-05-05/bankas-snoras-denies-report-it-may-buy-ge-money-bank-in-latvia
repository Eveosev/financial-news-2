Bankas Snoras AB (SRS1L) , Lithuaniaâ€™s third-
biggest lender by assets, denied a report that it is interested
in buying the Latvian unit of GE Money Bank.  Snoras also has no plans to sell its shares in Latvian
lender AS Latvijas Krajbanka, the Vilnius-based bank said today
in a statement to the stock exchange.  The Russian news service Regnum yesterday cited an
unidentified person in Latvian banking as saying that Snoras was
interested in acquiring the GE Money unit and selling its shares
in Latvijas Krajbanka.  To contact the reporter on this story:
