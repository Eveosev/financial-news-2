Schroders Plc (SDR) , the U.K.’s biggest
publicly traded fund manager, fell the most since January 2009
in London trading after missing some analysts’ earnings and
revenue estimates for the first quarter.  Pretax profit rose 11 percent to 103.8 million pounds
($171.1 million) from a year earlier. Revenue increased 5.9
percent to 292 million pounds, London-based Schroders said in a
statement today. The  money manager  lured net inflows of 2.8
billion pounds from institutions and 200 million pounds from
individual investors in the period, 68 percent less than in the
year-earlier quarter.  Uncertainty over European sovereign debt crisis, rising
inflation, the prospect of higher  interest rates  and concern
that the strength of the global economic recovery is prompting
individual investors to hang onto cash until market trends
become clearer.  “The cause of the weakness is lower-than-expected revenue
margins at the asset-management operations,” Barclays Capital
analyst Daniel Garrod, who rates the shares “underweight,”
said in a note to clients. “A negative product-mix effect
is what we expected at Schroders, but the impact this quarter is
more dramatic than expected.”  Shares Decline  The shares fell 9.2 percent, or 172 pence, to 1,700 pence,
the biggest decline since Jan. 14, 2009, and the lowest since
March 17 this year. The stock was the worst performer in the
 FTSE 100 Index (UKX)  today. The shares have fallen 8.4 percent this
year, giving the company a market value of 4.68 billion pounds.  Pretax profit was 7 million pounds lower than estimated,
Garrod said. Revenue was 7 percent lower than he had estimated,
while fee margins of 55 basis points were two basis points lower
than he had expected. One basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  “Retail investors are sitting on quite a lot of cash,”
Schroders Chief Executive Officer Michael Dobson said in an
interview. “They will move back into the market once a bit of a
trend establishes itself.”  Funds under management rose 2.4 percent in the quarter to
201.4 billion pounds, the first time they have topped 200
billion pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
