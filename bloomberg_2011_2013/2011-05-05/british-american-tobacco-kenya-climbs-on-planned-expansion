British American Tobacco Kenya Ltd. (BATK) ,
East Africa’s biggest cigarette maker, climbed to its highest
level in almost a week after saying it plans to begin exports to
 Southern Sudan  this year.  The company’s stock advanced 1 shilling, or 0.4 percent, to
262 shillings by the 3 p.m. close in the capital, Nairobi.  BAT, as the cigarette manufacturer that exports to 17
countries is known, has started talks with the Southern Sudanese
government over various issues including the level of excise
duty that will be charged on the cigarettes, Managing Director
Gary Fagan said yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
