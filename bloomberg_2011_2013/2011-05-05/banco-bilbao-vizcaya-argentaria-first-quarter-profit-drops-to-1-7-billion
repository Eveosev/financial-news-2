Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA (BBVA) ,
 Spain ’s second-largest bank, said first-quarter profit dropped
7.3 percent as earnings in its home market slumped on higher
impairment costs.  Net income declined to 1.15 billion euros ($1.71 billion)
from 1.24 billion euros a year earlier, the Bilbao, Spain-based
bank said in a filing to regulators today. Earnings beat the
average 1.09 billion-euro estimate in a Bloomberg survey of
eight analysts.  BBVA, which relies on Spain for about 60 percent of its
customer lending, is betting on growth in markets such as  Mexico 
and Turkey as its home economy struggles to expand and trim an
 unemployment rate  that’s above 21 percent. The bank  said today
it kept bad loans in check for a fifth quarter and laid the
ground for profit gains from its U.S. business next year.  “It’s going to be a slow process in terms of economic
recovery in Spain and if you’re in an investor in BBVA you have
to be aware that there’s going to be no rapid turnaround,” said
Neil Smith, an analyst at WestLB AG who has rated the stock
“sell” for more than a year.  BBVA shares fell 1.5 percent to 8.43 euros at close in
Madrid, paring gains this year to 11 percent. The lender, led by
Chairman Francisco Gonzalez, is the sixth-best performer in the
48-member Bloomberg  Europe  Banks and Financial Services Index in
2011, which has advanced 0.6 percent.  Banco Santander SA (SAN) , which
on April 28 reported a 5 percent drop in first-quarter profit,
is up 3.4 percent.  Bad Loans  Net interest income at BBVA fell 6.2 percent to 3.18
billion euros in the first quarter. The bank will probably
increase net interest income this year compared with 2010, Chief
Financial Officer Manuel Gonzalez Cid said on a webcast for
analysts. Bad loans were 4.1 percent of total lending, unchanged
from December and down from 4.3 percent a year earlier, the bank
said.  Net entries into default after recoveries of loan losses
were 922 million euros, compared with 1.37 billion euros in the
fourth quarter and 874 million euros a year ago, BBVA said.  Profit from Spain dropped to 477 million euros from 714
million euros as net interest income plunged 15 percent and
costs for asset impairments more than doubled to 422 million
euros. The bad-loans ratio at the unit was unchanged from
December at 4.8 percent, while lending to Spanish customers fell
0.7 percent.  Latin America   BBVA’s lending to Spanish real-estate developers totaled
16.2 billion euros, of which 27 percent was in land, BBVA said.
That compared with 16.6 billion euros in December.  Profit from Mexico climbed 26 percent to 436 million euros,
and earnings from  South America  rose 20 percent to 280 million
euros, the company said.  BBVA’s first-quarter results include 10 days of
contributions from its $5.8 billion purchase of a 24.9 percent
stake in  Turkiye Garanti Bankasi AS (GARAN)  completed in March.  Profit from Eurasia, a new unit that includes stakes in
Garanti,  Asia  and other activities in Europe outside Spain, rose
to 198 million euros from 124 million euros a year ago. BBVA
doesn’t plan to make any acquisitions at the moment as its
“plate is full” digesting the Garanti deal and seeking market
share gains across existing businesses, Angel Cano, the bank’s
president and chief operating officer, said on a webcast today.  To contact the reporter for this story:
