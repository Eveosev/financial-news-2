The  New York Yankees  were beaten 6-3
by the Detroit Tigers for their first three-game losing streak
of the Major League Baseball season.  The Tigers scored three runs in the bottom of the seventh
inning to snap a 2-2 tie at Comerica Park in Detroit. Brandon Inge hit a sacrifice fly off losing pitcher A.J. Burnett to give
Detroit the lead and the Tigers scored two more runs on a
throwing error by shortstop Eduardo Nunez, who started in place
of  Derek Jeter .  Brennan Boesch drove in the other three runs for the
Tigers, who won the final three games of the four-game series.  Before its winning streak, Detroit (15-17) had lost seven
consecutive games. The Yankees (17-12) had one previous losing
streak this season, dropping two in a row against the  Chicago
White Sox  last month.  Nunez and Eric Chavez each drove in a run for New York,
which has scored four runs over the last three games.  Chavez, who started at third base in place of  Alex Rodriguez , left with a leg injury in the fourth inning after
hitting his first triple since 2007. Rodriguez scored the
Yankees’ final run on a ninth-inning single by Brett Gardner.  Nunez was playing in place of Jeter, who left last night’s
loss to Detroit because of a sore right hip.  The Yankees head to Texas and open a three-game series
against the defending American League-champion Rangers tomorrow.
Detroit next plays a four-game series in Toronto.  To contact the reporter on this story:
