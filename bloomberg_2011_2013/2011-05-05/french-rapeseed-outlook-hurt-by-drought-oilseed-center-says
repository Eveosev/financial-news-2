France ’s rapeseed crop is being
damaged by drought in growing regions in the country’s north and
east, the national technical center for oilseed crops said.  “The persistent drought is affecting the potential,” the
Paris-based center, known as Cetiom, said in an  online report 
today. “The medium-term weather outlook is not encouraging.”  Last month was France’s second-hottest April since 1900 and
one of the driest since 1953, the Agriculture Ministry reported.
Rainfall across France was 21 millimeters (0.83 inch), 65
percent below normal and less than average for a fourth month,
according to the ministry.  On shallow soils where rapeseed rooting is “mediocre,”
yield potential has been “quite affected already,” Cetiom
said. On deeper soils with good rooting potential, crops will be
hurt without “good rains” of at least 15 to 20 millimeters, it
said.  “Rains have fallen, but in a very disparate manner
geographically, and in very variable quantities,” the
researcher said. “The drop in temperatures and occasional rains
bring some relief to the plants, without fundamentally changing
the situation of a water shortage.”  French rapeseed production is forecast to rise to 4.9
million metric tons this year from 4.8 million tons in 2010,
according to European farmers’ organization Copa-Cogeca.  To contact the reporter on this story:
