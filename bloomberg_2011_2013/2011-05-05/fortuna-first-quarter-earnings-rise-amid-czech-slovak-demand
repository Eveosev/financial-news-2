Fortuna Entertainment Group NV (FORTUNA) , an
operator of betting shops in central  Europe , said first-quarter
earnings advanced 44 percent, boosted by demand in the Czech
Republic and Slovakia for products such as Internet gambling.  Earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation rose to
8.4 million euros ($12.5 million) while gross wins increased
19.5 percent to 26.5 million euros, the Amsterdam-based company
said today in an e-mailed statement. Amounts staked by customers
rose 16.5 percent to 114.1 million euros.  “Results were slightly above our and market consensus,”
said Vaclav Kminek, an analyst at Ceska Sporitelna AS in  Prague ,
in an e-mailed statement. “We can expect positive market
reaction today.”  Fortuna, which first sold shares to the public in October,
is seeking to expand its scratch card and lottery operations
amid the bankruptcy of the Sazka AS gaming company in the  Czech
Republic . Poland will also represent an expansion opportunity as
the market opens for licensed on-line betting later this year.  Fortuna said today the cost of rolling out lottery terminal
sales and other new products will have a negative effect on
Ebitda of between 4 million and 5 million euros. Most of the
costs will be seen in the second half of the year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
