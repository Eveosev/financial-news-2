(Corrects losing streak for ringgit in fifth paragraph.)  Asian currencies declined, led by
Malaysia’s ringgit and the  Indian rupee , as regional stocks fell
on concern U.S. economic growth is cooling.  The MSCI Asia-Pacific Index of equities slid after reports
from the U.S. yesterday showed service industries expanded at
the slowest pace in eight months and companies added fewer jobs
than forecast. The U.S. government will announce official
employment data tomorrow.  “Global risk sentiment is being driven by recent economic
data that may favor safe-haven currencies in the very short
term,” said Saktiandi Supaat, head of foreign-exchange research
at Malayan Banking Bhd. in  Singapore . “Asian currency markets
may consolidate in a tight range ahead of non-farm payrolls data
tomorrow.”  The ringgit weakened 0.5 percent to 2.9914 per dollar as of
4:05 p.m. in  Kuala Lumpur  and  India ’s rupee fell 0.3 percent to
44.59. Singapore’s dollar dropped 0.2 percent to S$1.2314,
Indonesia’s rupiah fell 0.2 percent to 8,568 and the Philippine
peso retreated 0.2 percent to 42.94.  The ringgit declined for a third day, its longest losing
streak since February. Bank Negara will keep its overnight
policy rate at 2.75 percent today, according to nine of 16
economists surveyed by Bloomberg, while seven predict an
increase to 3 percent.  ‘If the U.S. recovery is deemed to be somewhat derailed
momentarily, it could support a case for a hold on  interest
rates ,’’ Saktiandi said. “We see a higher probability of an
increase in the second half” in  Malaysia , he said.  Philippine Inflation  The Philippines peso fell as a government report showed the
fastest pace of inflation in two years in April. Consumer prices
increased 4.5 percent from a year earlier, after a 4.3 percent
gain in March. The median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey
was for a 4.4 percent gain.  Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas increased its benchmark rate
for a second consecutive meeting to 4.50 percent, matching a
forecast by economists in a Bloomberg survey.  “The market may be pricing in uncertainty on inflation,”
said Lito Biacora, vice president for treasury at Bank of the
Philippine Islands in Manila. “The weakness in the  U.S. economy 
and correction in the equities market” are driving the peso
lower, he said.  Indonesian Rate Decision  The rupiah dropped as a government report today showed a
6.5 percent rise in first-quarter gross domestic product from a
year earlier, compared with a 6.89 percent gain in the three
months through December. The first-quarter number was lower than
the 6.58 percent median forecast of economists in a Bloomberg
News survey. Bank  Indonesia  will leave its policy rate at 6.75
percent next week, according to all eight economists surveyed by
Bloomberg.  “The rupiah’s weakening is driven by external factors,”
said  Gundy Cahyadi , a Singapore-based economist at Oversea-
Chinese Banking Corp. “As long as the GDP numbers come in above
6 percent, there will be positive momentum for the economy.”  Elsewhere, Taiwan’s dollar rose 0.1 percent to NT$28.632
against its U.S. counterpart, according to Taipei Forex Inc.
 China ’s yuan was little changed at 6.4947. Financial markets in
 South Korea  and Thailand are closed for a holiday today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
