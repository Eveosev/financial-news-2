General Motors Co. (GM) , the biggest
overseas automaker in China, reported sales fell in April, the
first decline since December, as the removal of government
incentives dented demand.  GM sold 203,367 vehicles in China last month, the Detroit-
based company said in a  statement  today. That compares with
sales of 213,112 units last April. The decline follows delivery
growth of 1.2 percent in March and a 6 percent increase in
February.  Automakers including GM, Toyota Motor Corp., and Honda
Motor Co. have seen car buying slow this year after China
reinstated a 10 percent tax rate on small-car sales and phased
out subsidies for vehicle trade-ins in rural areas. GM, which
makes Buick-branded cars and Wuling minivans with Chinese
partner SAIC Motor Corp., aims to double sales in the world’s
largest auto market to 5 million units by 2015, it said last
month.  The automaker boosted  China  sales 29 percent to 2.35
million vehicles last year, helped by state incentives and
economic growth.  Sales by SAIC-GM-Wuling Automotive Co., the minivan venture
that makes the Wuling Sunshine, China’s best-selling vehicle,
totaled 100,262 vehicles in April.  GM Chief Executive Officer Dan Akerson is counting on
emerging markets including China to help drive growth after an
initial public offering of more than $20 billion in November.
The carmaker plans to boost investment in China and introduce 60
new and upgraded models over the next five years, it said during
the Shanghai Auto show last month. The company estimates it has
a 14.7 percent market share in China.  Last year, China’s overall auto sales surged 32 percent to
a record 18.06 million, helping make the nation the world’s
largest vehicle market for the second year running.  Passenger-car sales in 2011 may grow slower than an earlier
forecast of 10 percent to 15 percent, the China Association of
Automobile Manufacturers said this month.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
