Kenya ’s main federation of labor
unions rejected the government’s 12.5 percent minimum wage offer
and threatened to strike in 21 days unless their request for a
60 percent increase is met, the  Daily Nation  reported, citing
the union chief.  The Central Organization of Trade Unions drafted an
economic report that shows the east African nation’s economy can
support its wage demands, including a 10 percent pay increase
for all employees across the country, the Nairobi-based
newspaper reported today, citing Secretary-General Francis
Atwoli.  To contact the reporter on this story:
