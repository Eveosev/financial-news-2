Africa  remains too reliant on mineral
exports and the “low quality” of its economic growth threatens
its sustainability, according to the Africa Progress Panel, a
grouping that seeks to promote development on the world’s
poorest continent.  “More than 80 percent of the continent’s export earning
comes from primary, generally unprocessed commodities,” the
panel said in a report released at the World Economic Forum on
Africa in Cape Town today. Growth “often does not translate
into equitable human development and public services.”  The panel is chaired by former United Nations Secretary-
General Kofi Annan and its members include former U.K. Prime
Minister  Tony Blair , former Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo
and musician Bob Geldof.  With investment into Africa focused on extractive
industries and trade protectionism still rife, most countries
have little scope to “drive much-needed economic transformation
through trade diversification,” the panel said.  The  International Monetary Fund  estimates sub-Saharan
Africa’s economy will expand 5.5 percent this year and 5.9
percent in 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
