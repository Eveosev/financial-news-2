The U.S. Treasury Department today
said it will freeze the assets of three companies owned by the
Libyan government as part of the Obama administration’s effort
to weaken the regime of  Muammar Qaddafi , the country’s leader.  The companies are Libyan Jamahiriya Broadcasting Corp., the
state broadcasting company; Dalia Advisory Ltd., a London-based
investment firm; and Lafico Algeria Holdings, an Algeria-based
unit of the Libyan Arab Foreign Investment Co., according to a
Treasury statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
