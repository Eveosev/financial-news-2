Changing Romanian interest rates
wouldn’t be “beneficial” and the central bank is “totally
reluctant” to move borrowing costs because it wouldn’t meet
short-term objectives, Governor Mugur Isarescu told a news
conference in Bucharest today.  He also said that the “high” exchange-rate volatility for
the leu is unsustainable and the central bank is “not
interested” in short-term influences on the leu’s price and
exchange-rate influences are not good for the medium term, even
though an appreciation is “helpful” in the short term.  To contact the reporter on this story:
