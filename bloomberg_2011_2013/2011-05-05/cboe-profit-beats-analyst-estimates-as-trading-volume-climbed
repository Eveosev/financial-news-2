CBOE Holdings Inc. (CBOE) , the U.S. options
market that went public in June, reported first-quarter profit
that beat analysts’ estimates, driven by higher trading volume.  Net income rose 42 percent to $32.1 million, the Chicago-
based owner of the  Chicago Board Options Exchange  said today in
a statement. Earnings excluding some items were 36 cents a
share, topping the 34-cent average forecast from 17 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg. Revenue in the first quarter was $124
million, exceeding the $121.6 million predicted by analysts.  CBOE, the largest U.S. options market in 2010, is the
exclusive venue for options based on the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index and the VIX gauge of volatility. As trading slowed last
year, CBOE focused on cutting costs to balance the lower
revenue. The company faces more competition as policy makers
overhaul the  derivatives market , in addition to a potential
larger rival as  Nasdaq OMX Group Inc. (NDAQ)  and Deutsche Boerse AG
have proposed separate offers to combine with  NYSE Euronext. (NYX)   The average daily volume increased to 5.08 million shares
from 4.56 million, while total trading volume climbed to 315
million shares from 277.8 million.  CBOE shares fell 1.9 percent to $26.28 in U.S. trading
yesterday. They have rallied 15 percent this year, compared with
the 0.9 percent gain in the FTSE/Mondo Visione Exchanges Index
that tracks 18 companies.  NYSE Euronext, the biggest operator of U.S. stock
exchanges, reported first-quarter profit on April 28 that beat
analysts’ estimates, boosted by higher revenue from European
derivatives trading. Nasdaq OMX, the second-biggest U.S. stock
exchange operator, posted profit on April 20 that matched
estimates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
