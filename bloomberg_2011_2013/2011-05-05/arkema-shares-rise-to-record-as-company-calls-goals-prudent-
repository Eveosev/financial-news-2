Arkema SA (AKE)  rose to a record in Paris
trading as the chemical maker spun off from Total SA reported
higher-than-expected earnings in the first quarter, forecast a
“very good” 2011 and called goals for 2015 “prudent.”  Arkema gained 7 percent, the biggest advance since the 2006
spinoff, to 73.49 euros at the close of trading. First-quarter
earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization
more than doubled to 287 million euros ($418 million), the
Colombes, France-based company said today in a statement. The
figure beat analysts’ average estimate of 235 million euros.  “We’re on a very good trend,” Chief Executive Officer
Thierry Le Henaff said on a conference call with journalists.
The performance now makes the manufacturer’s objectives for 2015
seem “prudent.”  Arkema is buying Total’s photocure and coatings resins
businesses and boosting production capacity for acrylics,
thiochemicals, fluorinated polymers and polyamide in  Asia . It’s
targeting sales of 7.5 billion euros and Ebitda exceeding
1 billion euros in 2015 by tapping growing markets for
alternative energy, batteries, water treatment, composite
materials and bio-plastics, it said in November.  First-quarter net income almost quadrupled to 151 million
euros from 40 million euros a year earlier. Arkema, which
reported sales in 2010 of 5.91 billion euros and Ebitda of 790
million euros, said it expects Ebitda in the second quarter to
be “similar” to the first, and reiterated "its confidence for
a very good year.’’  To contact the reporter on this story:
