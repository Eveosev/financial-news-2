Australia ’s dollar fell for a fourth
day, its longest losing streak in seven weeks, as commodities
tumbled and retail sales unexpectedly dropped, fueling
speculation the  Reserve Bank  will delay raising  interest rates .  New Zealand’s currency erased gains and also dropped for a
fourth day in its longest stretch of losses since March 17. It
rose earlier from near a two-week low versus the greenback after
a report showed employers added more jobs last quarter than
economists forecast.  The Australian data “continue to point to the RBA
remaining on hold,” said David Forrester, a currency economist
at Barclays Capital in Singapore.  The Aussie depreciated 1.1 percent to $1.0626 at 1:38 p.m.
in  New York , from $1.0748 yesterday. The currency slid 1.5
percent to 86.35 yen.  New Zealand’s dollar, nicknamed the kiwi, slipped 0.4
percent to 78.67 U.S. cents after earlier gaining 0.6 percent to
79.43 cents. It lost 0.7 percent to 63.21 yen and touched 62.55,
the lowest since March 30.  The Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of raw materials
sank as much as 4.4 percent today to 342.85, the lowest level
since March 17.  New Zealand ’s jobless rate fell to 6.6 percent in the first
quarter, from a revised 6.7 percent in the three months through
December, the nation’s statistics agency reported.  Retail sales in Australia declined 0.5 percent in March
from the previous month, the Bureau of Statistics said today in
Sydney. Economists predicted a 0.5 percent gain, according to a
Bloomberg News survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
