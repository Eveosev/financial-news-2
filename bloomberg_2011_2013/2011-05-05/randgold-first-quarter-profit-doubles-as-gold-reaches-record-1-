Randgold Resources Ltd. (RRS) , a miner of
the metal in West Africa, said first-quarter profit more than
doubled as prices climbed to a record, while full-year output
will be at the upper end of its range of estimates.  Net income climbed to $41.5 million from $18.7 million a
year earlier, the Jersey, Channel Islands-based company said
today in a statement. Sales grew 52 percent to $185.6 million.  Gold producers’ profits have been buoyed by record prices
for bullion as  Europe ’s sovereign-debt woes and central banks’
money printing spurred demand for precious metals. Gold for
immediate delivery averaged $1,388 an ounce in the first
quarter, compared with $1,110 an ounce a year earlier.  Randgold expects full-year production at the “upper end”
of its projected range of 750,000 to 790,000 ounces, Chief
Executive Officer  Mark Bristow  said in an interview in  London 
today. The company’s output grew 24 percent in the first quarter
to 139,403 ounces and totaled 440,107 ounces last year.  Randgold slipped 73 pence, or 1.5 percent, to 4,900 pence
by the 4:30 p.m. close of London trading.  The company is developing mines in Senegal and Mali, and in
2009 agreed with AngloGold Ashanti Ltd. to buy Moto Goldmines
Ltd., which has a deposit in east Democratic Republic of Congo.  To contact the reporter on this story:
