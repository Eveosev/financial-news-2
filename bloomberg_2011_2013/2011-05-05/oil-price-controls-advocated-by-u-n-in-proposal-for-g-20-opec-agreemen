The Group of 20 nations should
negotiate a benchmark “fair” cost of oil with the Organization
of Petroleum Exporting Countries and limit price movements
within a band, the  United Nations  said.  The G-20 needs to “act decisively to moderate the
volatility of oil and food prices,” the agency said in a
statement as it released an annual report on  Asia  and the
Pacific in Bangkok today.  Oil has climbed 36 percent in the past year, with unrest in
the Middle East and North Africa adding to supply concerns. The
U.N. says rising food and oil costs threaten to drive millions
more people into poverty in Asia, most severely affecting the
populations of nations including Bangladesh,  India  and Nepal.  Crude for June delivery traded at more than $108 per barrel
as of 10:45 a.m. Singapore time today.  The G-20, a group made up of the European Union and 19 of
the world’s richest nations, could also regulate commodity
markets to reduce speculation and “discipline the conversion of
food into bio-fuels,” the U.N. said.  China ’s economy may expand 9.5 percent this year and
India’s by 8.7 percent, it said.  The agency said that volatile money flows are a risk for the
region, creating asset bubbles and causing currencies to rise.
Capital controls are “an important element in the policy tool
kit,” it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
