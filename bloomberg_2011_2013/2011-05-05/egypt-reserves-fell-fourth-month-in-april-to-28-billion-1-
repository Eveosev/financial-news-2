Egypt ’s international reserves fell
for a fourth month in April, dropping to the lowest level since
April 2007 as the economy suffers from the effects of the
country’s worst political crisis in three decades.  Net international reserves declined to $28 billion from
$30.1 billion in March, the central bank said on its  website 
today. Reserves peaked at $36 billion in December, a month
before the start of a revolt that toppled President  Hosni Mubarak  in February.  “The fall in foreign reserves was expected and is expected
to continue given that we have capital outflows as a result of
the political turmoil,” John Sfakianakis, the Riyadh-based
chief economist of Banque Saudi Fransi, said in a telephone
interview. “The next two months we will see a fall in foreign
reserves but not to an alarming level.”  The turmoil that accompanied the uprising has kept tourists
away, prompted companies and banks to close, and weakened the
pound to a six-year low against the dollar. Economic growth may
slow to 1 percent this year, according to the  International
Monetary Fund , the lowest rate since 1992.  Sfakianakis said he expected that “the Egyptian economy
will begin to recover during the new fiscal year as we have more
political clarity.”  The cost of protection against Egypt’s default, or credit
default swaps, rose 3.6 basis points, or 0.036 percentage point,
to 357.75, the highest level since March 21, at 1:15 p.m. in
 London  according to CMA prices.  The yield on Egypt’s 5.75 percent dollar bond maturing in
April 2020 was little changed at 6.29 percent. The Egyptian
pound strengthened less than 0.1 percent at 5.944 per dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
