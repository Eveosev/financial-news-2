Australian home-building approvals
rose the most since October, a sign demand for housing may
increase in an economy approaching full employment.  The number of permits granted to build or renovate houses
and apartments advanced 9.1 percent from February, when they
fell a revised 5.3 percent, the Bureau of Statistics said in
Sydney today. The median forecast was for a 5 percent increase
in a Bloomberg News survey of 19 economists.  Reserve Bank  of Australia Governor Glenn Stevens has held
rates at 4.75 percent for the past five meetings to help
Queensland state recover from damage to properties, mines and
crops from floods and a cyclone. Economic growth accelerated in
the final three months of last year, the eighth straight
quarterly expansion before the natural disasters.  The increase was driven by “the initial stages of the
rebuilding phase from the Queensland floods,” David Cannington,
an economist at Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd., said
before today’s report. “With the negative impact of the
November interest rate hike expected to be fading by March,
approvals for both house and apartment building should
improve.”  Building approvals fell 18.1 percent from a year earlier,
the report showed. That compares with economists’ forecast for a
25.2 percent drop year-over-year.  Approvals to build private houses fell 0.8 percent to 8,016
in March from the previous month, the report said. Approvals for
apartments and renovations advanced 26.1 percent to 5,147.  To contact the reporter for this story:
