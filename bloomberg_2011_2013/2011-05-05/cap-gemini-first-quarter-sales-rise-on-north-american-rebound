Cap Gemini SA (CAP) , Europe’s largest
computer-services company, said first-quarter sales climbed 15
percent, beating analysts’ estimates, as business rebounded in
North America.  Revenue rose to 2.35 billion euros ($3.49 billion) from
2.05 billion euros a year earlier, the Paris-based company said
today in a statement. Sales exceeded the 2.29 billion-euro
average of seven analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  North American sales rose 10 percent, the company said.  Cap
Gemini  reiterated a target for 9 percent to 10 percent group
revenue growth this year. Organic revenue growth may exceed 4
percent to 5 percent, Chief Executive Officer Paul Hermelin said
on a conference call with reporters.  Cap Gemini is looking to guard market share and win new
customers as French rival  Atos Origin SA (ATO)  prepares to merge with
 Siemens AG (SIE) ’s computer services unit. To strengthen its position,
Cap Gemini is pushing further into the energy industry, working
with Intel Corp. on home energy-management equipment.  Cap Gemini is continuing to seek small- and medium-sized
acquisition targets, Hermelin said on the call.  The French company has made emerging-market acquisitions to
increase its customer base. Last year it paid 233 million euros
for control of Brazilian information-technology company CPM
Braxis. The new unit contributed 4.2 percentage points of sales
growth in the quarter, Cap Gemini said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
