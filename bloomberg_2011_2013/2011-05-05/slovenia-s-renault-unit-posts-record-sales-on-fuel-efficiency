Renault SA (RNO) ’s Slovenian unit  Revoz 
posted record sales last year on higher demand for fuel-
efficient cars.  Sales climbed to 1.32 billion euros ($1.9 billion), from
1.29 billion euros a year earlier, the Novo Mesto-based company
said in an e-mailed statement today. Net income in 2010 was 18.6
million euros, while accumulated profit increased to 60.7
million euros, which will be used for investment, Revoz said.  Slovenia’s biggest exporter produces Twingo, Clio II and
Wind Coupe Roadster models, demand for which has improved as
consumers switch to more fuel-efficient vehicles on advancing
oil costs.  The plant may in 2013 start making a four-seat version of
the Smart car of  Daimler AG (DAI)  after the German company formed a
strategic partnership with Renault. The final decision is
expected this year, Revoz said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
