Peru ’s central bank will utilize
monetary policy to ensure the annual inflation rate returns to
policy makers’ 1 percent to 3 percent target range, El Peruano
 reported , citing bank President Julio Velarde.  The acceleration in annual inflation to 3.34 percent in
April is the result of external supply shocks, Velarde said,
according to the Lima-based, state-owned newspaper.  The nation’s economy has decelerated on slower public and
private investment and will probably pick up after the
presidential elections, Velarde said, according to El Peruano.  To contact the reporter on this story:
