Fidelity Investments’ Edward “Ned” C. Johnson III, the chairman and chief executive officer of the
second-biggest U.S. mutual-fund company, stepped down as trustee
and chairman of a board that oversees the firm’s stock and
income funds.  Johnson relinquished his role leading the Equity and High
Income Funds board in January to James Curvey, in order to
“focus on his responsibilities as Fidelity’s chairman and CEO
as the company continues to grow and diversify,” Anne Crowley,
a spokeswoman for the Boston-based firm, said today in a
telephone interview.  Johnson’s move was reported earlier today by the Boston
Business Journal.  Abigail Johnson , the daughter of the 81-year-old CEO, was
elected chairman of Fidelity’s other fund board in 2009,
overseeing the firm’s investment-grade bonds, asset-allocation
portfolios and money funds. Curvey has served in a variety of
roles during his 28 years at Fidelity, including president and
chief operating officer. He is vice chairman of the board of FMR
LLC, Fidelity’s corporate holding company.  Ned Johnson is "actively and fully engaged in running the
company and has no plans to retire," Crowley said.  Fidelity manages about $1.6 trillion in assets. The closely
held firm in March reported a 17 percent increase in full-year
operating income as gains in stock and bond markets lifted
assets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
