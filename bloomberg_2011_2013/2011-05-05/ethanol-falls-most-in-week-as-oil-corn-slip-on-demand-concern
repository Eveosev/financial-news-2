Ethanol futures fell the most in a
week as commodities from corn to crude oil plunged on concern
the global economic recovery will falter and fuel demand will
decline.  The alternative fuel followed other commodities lower after
a government report showed applications for U.S. jobless
benefits jumped to 474,000 last week, and as European Central
Bank President  Jean-Claude Trichet  said inflation risks will be
monitored closely.  “It’s a broad-based commodity sell-off,” said Matt Janney, a trader at Citigroup Global Markets Inc. in  Chicago .
“It’s fear, basically, of inflation. You’re just seeing mass
liquidation. There were people, though, cheering on the floor
today as crude went below $100.”  Denatured ethanol for June delivery fell 6.2 cents, or 2.3
percent, to $2.58 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade, the
steepest decline for the contract since April 28. The June
contract became the front-month futures today.  In cash market trading ethanol in  New York  tumbled 7 cents,
or 2.6 percent, to $2.66 a gallon and in Chicago the additive
decreased 5.5 cents, or 2.1 percent, to $2.565, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol in the U.S. Gulf dropped 5 cents, or 1.8 percent,
to $2.705 a gallon and on the West Coast ethanol increased 1
cent, or 0.4 percent, to $2.765.  Crude oil for June delivery plummeted $9.44, or 8.6
percent, to $99.80 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange ,
the lowest settlement price since March 16 and the biggest one-
day decline since April 20, 2009. Gasoline for June delivery
fell 22.71 cents, or 6.8 percent, to settle at $3.0954 a gallon.  Corn futures for July delivery dropped 20.75 cents, or 2.8
percent, to close at $7.0875 a bushel in Chicago. One bushel
makes at least 2.75 gallons of ethanol.  To contact the reporter on this story:
