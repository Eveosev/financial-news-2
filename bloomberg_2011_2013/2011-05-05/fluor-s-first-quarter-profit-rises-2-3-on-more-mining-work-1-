Fluor Corp. (FLR) , the largest publicly
traded U.S. construction company, said first-quarter profit rose
2.3 percent as higher metal prices spurred mining projects.  Net income was $139.7 million, or 78 cents a share, up from
$136.6 million, or 76 cents, a year earlier, the company based
in Irving, Texas, said in a statement. Earnings excluding some
items were forecast at 76 cents, according to the 24 analyst
estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  A rebound in commodity demand and higher  oil prices  have
boosted mining and energy contracts, helping Fluor reach record
backlog of $37.2 billion.  “Revenue growth should be driven mostly by the Industrial
& Infrastructure segment, which is benefiting from multiple
large mining contracts won last year,” said Richard Paget, an
analyst with WJB Capital Group in  New York , in a May 3 report to
investors. Paget has a “buy” recommendation on Fluor.  Sales rose 2.8 percent to $5.06 billion from a year
earlier, compared with analysts’ average estimate for $5.58
billion. Sales growth was held back by the Oil & Gas unit, which
saw revenue decline to $1.7 billion from $2.1 billion a year
ago, Fluor said in the statement.  At the end of March, backlog was up 45 percent from $25.7
billion a year earlier. Backlog was $34.9 billion at the end of
last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
