The following is the text of the U.S.
productivity and costs report for the first quarter released
by the Labor Department.  PRODUCTIVITY AND COSTS First Quarter 2011, Preliminary  Nonfarm business sector labor productivity increased at a
1.6 percent annual rate during the first quarter of 2011, the
 U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics  reported today. The gain in
productivity reflects increases of 3.1 percent in output and
1.4 percent in hours worked. (All quarterly percent changes in
this release are seasonally adjusted annual rates.) From the
first quarter of 2010 to the first quarter of 2011, output
increased 3.2 percent while hours rose 1.9 percent, yielding
an increase in productivity of 1.3 percent.)  Labor productivity, or output per hour, is calculated by
dividing an index of real output by an index of hours worked
of all persons, including employees, proprietors, and unpaid
family workers.  Unit labor costs in nonfarm businesses rose 1.0 percent
in the first quarter of 2011, as a 2.6 percent increase in
hourly compensation outpaced the 1.6 percent gain in
productivity.  Unit labor costs rose 1.2 percent from the same
quarter a year ago.  In the first quarter of 2011, the
consumer price series increased at a 5.3 percent annual rate,
resulting in a decline of 2.5 percent in real hourly
compensation.  BLS defines unit labor costs as the ratio of hourly
compensation to  labor productivity ; increases in hourly
compensation tend to increase unit labor costs and increases
in output per hour tend to reduce them.  Real hourly
compensation is equal to hourly compensation divided by the
consumer price series.  Manufacturing sector productivity grew 6.3 percent in the
first quarter of 2011, as output and hours worked increased
9.7 percent and 3.3 percent, respectively.  Over the last four
quarters, manufacturing productivity increased 4.7 percent.
Unit labor costs in manufacturing declined 3.5 percent in the
first quarter of 2011 and 1.4 percent over the last four
quarters.  Productivity increased 9.8 percent in the durable goods
sector and 4.5 percent in the nondurable goods sector in the
first quarter of 2011.  In durable goods industries, a 16.4
percent jump in output outweighed a 6.1 percent increase in
hours worked; this gain in output is the largest in the
series.  Nondurable goods production rose 3.3 percent while
hours fell 1.2 percent.  The data sources and methods used in the preparation of
the manufacturing output series differ from those used in
preparing the business and nonfarm business output series, and
these measures are not directly comparable. See Technical
Notes for further information on data sources.  Fourth quarter and annual 2010 measures of productivity
and costs were announced for the nonfinancial corporate
sector.  Output per employee hour rose 2.6 percent for the
fourth quarter of 2010 as output and hours rose 4.5 percent
and 1.8 percent, respectively.  Annual average productivity
grew 5.7 percent in 2010.  Revised measures  Revised measures of real hourly compensation for all
sectors for 2006 onward reflect revisions in the consumer
price series based on new and revised data from the BLS Office
of Prices and Living Conditions.  Output data for the
manufacturing sectors reflects historically revised indexes of
industrial production published by the Board of Governors of
the  Federal Reserve System  on March 25. Accordingly,
manufacturing output, productivity and unit labor costs were
revised back to 1987 (See appendix tables 1-3). Full
historical annual and quarterly measures are available on the
productivity and costs home page:
 http://www.bls.gov/lpc/#data .  In the fourth quarter of 2010, nonfarm business
productivity growth was revised up to 2.9 percent due to a
small upward revision to output.  After revision, unit labor
costs fell 1.0 percent.  In the manufacturing sector, fourth-
quarter productivity growth was revised down to 5.1 percent.  For the year 2010, nonfarm business sector productivity
grew 3.9 percent and unit labor costs fell 1.5 percent, the
same as the preliminary estimates published March 3.  In the
manufacturing sector, productivity grew 5.9 percent and unit
labor costs fell 3.7 percent, as revised.  The revised Productivity and Costs news release for first-
quarter 2011 is scheduled to be released Thursday, June 2,
2011 at 8:30 a.m. (EDT).
