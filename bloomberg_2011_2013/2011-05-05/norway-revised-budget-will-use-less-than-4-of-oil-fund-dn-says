Norway’s revised 2011 budget, which
the  Finance Ministry  will present next week, will use
"significantly" less oil money than stipulated by the country’s
fiscal spending rule, Dagens Naeringsliv said, citing informed
sources.    The Finance Ministry will present a "tight" budget next
week to avoid a strengthening of the krone, the Oslo-based
newspaper said. Finance Minister Sigbjoern Johnsen will present
the revised 2011 budget on May 13.   The so-called fiscal spending rule allows the government to
spend 4 percent of the country’s oil fund for budgetary
purposes.      Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
