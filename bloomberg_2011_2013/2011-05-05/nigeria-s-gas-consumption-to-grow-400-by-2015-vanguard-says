Nigeria’s gas consumption is expected
to leap 400 percent in four years as the government targets
about $2 billion annual investment in the industry,  Vanguard 
reported, citing Petroleum Minister Diezani Alison-Madueke.  The amount of gas used will rise by 4 billion standard
cubic feet a day by 2015 from the current level of 1 billion,
the Lagos-based newspaper said.  Nigeria is  Africa ’s biggest oil producer and the fifth-
biggest source of U.S. crude imports.  To contact the reporter on this story:
