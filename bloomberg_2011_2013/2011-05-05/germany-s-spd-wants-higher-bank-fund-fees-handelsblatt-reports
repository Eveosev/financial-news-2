Germany ’s Social Democrat-run states
may withhold support for a draft bank rescue fund amendment
unless the fees paid by lenders are raised,  Handelsblatt 
reported, citing regional leaders.  SPD-run states like Rhineland-Palatinate want to raise the
fee ceiling that banks pay into the fund from this year to as
much as 25 percent of annual profit from 15 percent envisaged in
the bill, the newspaper said in a preview of an article to be
published in tomorrow’s edition that cites the Prime Minister of
Rhineland-Palatinate, Kurt Beck.  The government seeks as much as 1.3 billion euros ($1.9
billion) a year from banks to set up their own rescue fund,
replacing a pool funded by taxpayers since 2008. German
accounting rules permit banks to cut the burden, Beck is cited
as saying.  The legislation is up for a vote in the upper house of
parliament, which represents the states, on May 27, the
newspaper said. The upper house, or Bundesrat, is dominated by
opposition parties including the SPD.  To contact the reporter on this story:
