(Corrects first two paragraphs to clarify that government
reduced incentives.)  Italy approved cuts in incentives paid
for power from solar photovoltaic plants, Industry Minister
Paolo Romani said today.  Italyâ€™s government approved a decree that reduces
incentives to solar projects, Romani said at a press conference
in  Rome . The government said on March 3 that it would bring in
new rules for the solar market, reducing subsidies that were to
be in place until 2013.  The Italian solar market became the second-largest in
 Europe  following Germany last year after the government offered
the highest feed-in tariffs in the region.  Countries such as Germany, Spain and France accelerated
those reductions several times last year as the cost of solar
panels declined, adding to the financial incentive for
developers to put up new plants.  To contact the reporter on this story:
