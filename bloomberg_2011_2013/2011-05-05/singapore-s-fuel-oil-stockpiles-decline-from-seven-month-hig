Singapore ’s stockpiles of residues, or
fuel oil, fell from the highest in seven months, data from a
unit of the Ministry of Trade and Industry showed.  Onshore inventories of residues, including fuel oil and
low-sulfur waxy residue and excluding bitumen, dropped 5.9
percent to 21.8 million barrels in the seven days to May 4,
 International Enterprise Singapore  said in an e-mailed statement
today. Supplies were at 23.2 million last week, the highest
level since Sept. 8.  Supplies of middle distillates, including gasoil and
kerosene, surged 29 percent, the most since Jan. 23, 2008, to
12.2 million barrels. Light distillates such as naphtha,
reformate and gasoline dropped 5.7 percent to 10.7 million
barrels.  Asia  fuel-oil  swaps rose by the most in a week while gasoil
and naphtha fell as  Japan ’s demand for power-generation fuel
outpaced demand for other oil products following the earthquake
in March.  High-sulfur fuel oil swaps for June jumped 0.3 percent to
$674.25 a metric ton at 3:30 p.m. Singapore time, according to
PVM Oil Associates, a London-based broker.  The trade ministry surveys refiners,  oil companies  and
storage terminals on a voluntary basis. The results may exclude
some offshore storage capacity, International Enterprise said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
