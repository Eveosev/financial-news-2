Botswanaâ€™s  central bank  wants to keep
prices stable while not risking an economic recovery by
increasing interest rates too aggressively, Reuters reported,
citing Bank of Botswana Governor Linah Mohohlo.  The southern African country is experiencing an improvement
in economic output and it would be inadvisable to harm that by
tightening monetary policy, the  news agency  cited Mohohlo as
saying.    Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
