Canadian natural gas fell after a U.S.
government report said stored reserves of the fuel increased
more than analysts estimated.  Stockpiles of gas rose 72 billion cubic feet last week to
1.76 trillion, the Energy Department said today. Analysts
expected an increase of 67 billion, the median of estimates
compiled by Bloomberg.  “The market has gotten accustomed to the number being
bullish,” said  Kyle Cooper , director of research for IAF
Advisers in Houston. “This is the first time in a long time
that it wasn’t.”  Alberta  gas for June delivery dropped 17.25 cents, or 4.6
percent, to C$3.605 per gigajoule ($3.53 per million British
thermal units) as of 11:15 a.m. New York time, according to  NGX, 
a Canadian Internet market. Gas traded on the exchange goes to
users in  Canada  and the U.S. and is priced on TransCanada
Corp.’s Alberta system.  Natural gas for June delivery on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  slid 25.8 cents, or 5.6 percent, to $4.319 per million
Btu as of 11:32 a.m.  Flow Rates  Volume on  TransCanada’s  Alberta system, which collects the
output of most of the nation’s gas wells, was 16 billion cubic
feet as of 10 a.m. in  New York , about 173 million below its
target level. Gas production has declined in western Canada
because the ground is too soft to move heavy equipment to well
sites.  Gas was flowing at a daily rate of 2.62 billion cubic feet
at Empress, Alberta, where the fuel is transferred to
TransCanada’s main line.  At McNeil, Saskatchewan, where gas is transferred to the
Northern Border Pipeline for shipment to the Chicago area, the
daily flow rate was 1.79 billion cubic feet.  Available capacity on TransCanada’s British Columbia system
at Kingsgate was 1.28 billion cubic feet. The system was
forecast to carry 1.63 billion cubic feet today, about 56
percent of its capacity of 2.9 billion.  The volume on  Spectra Energy’s  British Columbia system,
which gathers the fuel in northeastern British Columbia for
delivery to Vancouver and the Pacific Northwest, totaled 3.01
billion cubic feet at 10:05 a.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
