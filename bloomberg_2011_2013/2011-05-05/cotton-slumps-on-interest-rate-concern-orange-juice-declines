Cotton slumped to the lowest in more
than three months on concern that demand may weaken as rising
global interest rates slow growth.  Orange juice  also dropped.  The central bank in China, the world’s biggest cotton
buyer, has raised interest rates four times since October to
cool consumer prices. India boosted borrowing costs this week
after an increase by Brazil last month.  “The macro factors are pushing the market down,” said  Tom Reardon , the president of Delta Brokerage in New York. “The
entire commodities pack is under pressure today.”  Cotton for July delivery retreated 4.65 cents, or 3.1
percent, to settle at $1.4686 a pound on ICE Futures U.S. at 2
p.m. in New York. Earlier, the commodity fell to $1.4451, the
lowest since Jan. 18.  Orange-juice futures for July delivery dropped 1.05 cents,
or 0.6 percent, to $1.7125 a pound on ICE, falling for the
second straight day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
