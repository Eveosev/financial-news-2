A  New Hampshire  Senate committee
opposed a bill that would pull the state out of the  Regional
Greenhouse Gas Initiative , a cap-and-trade program for power-
plant carbon-dioxide emissions.  The Energy and Natural Resources Committee voted 2-3 today
on the bill that would withdraw New Hampshire from the 10-state
program,  Richard Parsons , an aide to the panel, said in a
telephone interview. The bill is scheduled to get a vote in the
full state Senate on May 11, Parsons said.  The carbon-trading program regulates pollution in a region
from  Maryland  to Maine. Power-plant operators must buy
allowances to account for the carbon dioxide released from their
smokestacks. Since 2008, the states have raised more than $860
million by selling the allowances in quarterly auctions,
according to the programâ€™s website.  In March, the New Hampshire House of Representatives passed
legislation to exit the carbon-trading program. House
Republicans said the program is a tax that increases electricity
prices. Governor  John Lynch , a Democrat, has threatened to veto
the bill if it passes the Senate.  Households and businesses save money under the program
because the cash raised by auctioning carbon allowances is spent
on projects that cut energy consumption, which lowers utility
bills, according to Lynch.  To contact the reporter on this story:
