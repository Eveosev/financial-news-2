Tokyo Electric Power Co. plans to
start operating air filters at the reactor No. 1 building at its
crippled Fukushima Dai-Ichi nuclear power plant today, Naoyuki
Matsumoto, spokesman at the utility, said by telephone. The
filters will lower the concentration of radioactive substances
in the building, Matsumoto said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
