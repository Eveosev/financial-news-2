Foreign investors increased their
share of stocks listed on the Greek stock exchange in April,
according to data released by the country’s Central Securities
Depository today.  Non-resident investors held 50.8 percent of the market
value of all stocks listed on the Athens Stock Exchange in
April, compared with 50.3 percent in April 2010. In March,
foreign investors owned 50.2 percent, according to figures
released on April 6.  Greece ’s benchmark ASE share index is down 2.5 percent so
far this year, after a series of press reports claiming Greece
is in talks about debt restructuring. Foreign investors
accounted for 51 percent of total turnover in April, according
to today’s statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
