Namibia ’s government decision to issue
all mining and mineral exploration permits to the state-owned
company, Epangelo, is for new projects, New Era reported, citing
Mines and Energy Minister Isak Katali.  The plan doesn’t affect projects already being developed
and isn’t nationalization, the Windhoek-based newspaper cited
Katali as saying.   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
