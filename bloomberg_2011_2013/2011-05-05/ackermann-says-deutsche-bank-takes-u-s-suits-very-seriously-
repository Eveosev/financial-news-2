Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  Chief Executive
Officer  Josef Ackermann  said  Germany ’s largest bank views
lawsuits by the U.S. government and Los Angeles “very
seriously,” while describing them as “baseless.”  “The bank has learned its lessons from the financial
crisis,” Ackermann said in a statement today. “I’ve stressed
for years that no business is worth risking Deutsche Bank’s good
reputation.”  Deutsche Bank was sued on May 3 for more than $1 billion by
the U.S. government, which claims the company and its MortgageIT
unit “repeatedly lied” so that thousands of risky mortgages
qualified for a government insurance program. A day later, the
German lender was sued by the Los Angeles city attorney for
allegedly failing to maintain foreclosed properties and
illegally evicting low-income tenants.  Deutsche Bank has dropped 3.8 percent to 42.51 euros in
Frankfurt trading in the three days since the first suit was
announced.  To contact the reporter on this story:
