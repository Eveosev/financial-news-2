Timberland Co. (TBL) , the maker of outdoor
clothing and footwear, plunged the most in more than 23 years
after saying profit declined 30 percent because of higher costs.  The retailer, based in Stratham,  New Hampshire , tumbled
$10.92, or 26 percent, to $30.65 at 4:15 p.m. in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading, the biggest decline since 1987.  Profit fell to $18 million, or 35 cents a share, from $25.7
million, or 47 cents a year earlier, according to a statement
today. Analysts had forecast 59 cents, the average of estimates
compiled by Bloomberg. Gross margin fell 300 basis points to 47
percent because of higher leather, labor and transportation
costs, which will persist this year, Chief Financial Officer
Carrie Teffner said on a conference call today.  Timberland doesnâ€™t provide profit forecasts, making the
earnings miss an even bigger surprise to investors, said Chris Svezia, an analyst for Susquehanna Financial Group in  New York .
The higher costs will continue to weigh on profits until price
increases can be passed to consumers, Svezia said.  First-quarter sales gained 10 percent to $349 million from
$317 million in the year-ago period, the company said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
