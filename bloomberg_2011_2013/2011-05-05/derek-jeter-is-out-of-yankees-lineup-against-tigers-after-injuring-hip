Derek Jeter  isn’t in the  New York
Yankees ’ starting lineup against Detroit today, after leaving
last night’s loss to the Tigers because of a sore right hip.  Eduardo Nunez will take Jeter’s place at shortstop and bat
ninth at Detroit’s Comerica Park, while left fielder Brett Gardner will hit in Jeter’s normal leadoff spot.  Jeter, 36,  told reporters  the injury was “really not an
issue” after manager Joe Girardi took him out of last night’s
4-0 loss in the eighth inning. Jeter said he didn’t know when
the injury occurred.  An 11-time Major League Baseball All-Star with a .313
career batting average, Jeter is hitting .250 this season with
two extra base hits -- both doubles -- in 108 at-bats.  Third baseman  Alex Rodriguez  also isn’t in the Yankees’
lineup today, with Eric Chavez starting in his place.  To contact the reporter on this story:
