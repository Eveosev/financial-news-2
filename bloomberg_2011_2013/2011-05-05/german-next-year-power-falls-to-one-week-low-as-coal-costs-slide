German electricity for next year fell
to its lowest in more than a week as coal declined, signaling
lower costs for power stations in  Europe ’s biggest market.  Baseload power for 2012 dropped 55 cents, or 0.9 percent,
to 58.45 euros ($85.36) as of 5:52 p.m. Berlin time, according
to broker data compiled by Bloomberg. That would be the lowest
close since April 26. Baseload is delivered around the clock.  The region’s benchmark contract is declining after it last
month climbed to its highest price since June 2009 as  Germany 
shut reactors for a safety review following the nuclear disaster
in  Japan . The contract closed as high as 60.55 euros on April 4.  Hard coal for next-year delivery to Amsterdam, Rotterdam or
Antwerp weakened the most since June as crude plummeted on signs
of weaker economic growth in the U.S. The coal contract slid the
most since June, losing as much as 3 percent to $128.50 a metric
ton. The fuel accounted for about a fifth of Germany’s power
last year. Germany also produces electricity from lignite, or
brown coal, natural gas, wind and solar plants.  Bloomberg tracks power prices from brokers including  GFI
