Axa SA (CS) ,  Europe ’s second-largest
insurer by market value, said first-quarter revenue was
unchanged as lower demand for life-insurance policies outweighed
a gain in sales at the property and casualty unit.  Total revenue was 27.9 billion euros ($41.4 billion), the
Paris-based company said in a statement today.  Axa’s net income in 2010 fell 24 percent as the French
insurer posted a loss on the sale of most of its U.K. life
business. To help revive profit, Chief Executive Officer Henri de Castries is cutting businesses in developed markets such as
the U.K. to tap more clients in faster-growing Asian economies.  Axa had 13 billion euros in asset-management outflows in
the first quarter, mostly at its New York-based unit
AllianceBernstein LP, the company said.  AllianceBernstein’s outflows will probably keep decreasing
with a possible return to inflows by about the end of the year,
Deputy Chief Executive Officer Denis Duverne said on a
conference call with reporters today.  Axa fell 0.3 percent to 14.95 euros at 10:08 in Paris
trading, giving the insurer a market value of 34.7 billion
euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
