Seeding of crops including cereals,
peas and lentils in Saskatchewan was 1 percent completed as of
May 2 as cool, wet weather stalled fieldwork, the Ministry of
Agriculture said.  A majority of planting has been delayed by excess moisture,
including snow in parts of southern and east-central
Saskatchewan, the ministry said today in a  news release . A year
earlier, planting was 2 percent completed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
