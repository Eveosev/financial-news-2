Tel Aviv ’s  Ben Gurion International
Airport , the busiest in  Israel , delayed flights amid concern
that fuel supplies there are tainted, officials said today.  “There is a suspicion of contamination,” Shmuel Kandel, the
airport’s manager, said at a news conference in remarks screened
on Channel 2 Television. Ground crew halted refueling at the
terminal, run by the Israel Airports Authority, Kandel said.  National Infrastructures Minister Uzi Landau said the
government will appoint an investigative panel to determine how
the fuel became adulterated, according to an e-mailed statement.  To contact the reporters on this story:
