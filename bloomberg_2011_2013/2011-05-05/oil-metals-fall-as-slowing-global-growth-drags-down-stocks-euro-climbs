Commodities plunged the most in two
years, stocks worldwide posted the biggest three-day drop since
March and the dollar rallied after American jobless claims
unexpectedly rose and the  European Central Bank  signaled it will
wait until after June to raise  interest rates .  The Standard & Poor’s GSCI index of 24 commodities sank 4.8
percent at 12:10 p.m. in  New York  and has lost 8.1 percent this
week. Silver tumbled 7.4 percent, extending its decline since
April 29 to 25 percent, and oil sank 5.9 percent. The MSCI All-
Country World Index of shares in 45 nations fell 0.7 percent to
349.22, extending its three-day loss to 2.4 percent. The  S&P 500 
was unchanged after dropping 0.8 percent. The dollar gained 1.6
percent against the euro, making commodities quoted in the
greenback more expensive for holders of other currencies.  U.S. claims for employment benefits jumped to 474,000 last
week amid auto-plant shutdowns, exceeding the median economist
estimate of 410,000 in a Bloomberg survey, while worker
productivity declined. The euro weakened after ECB President
 Jean-Claude Trichet  surprised some investors who expected a
quicker move to fight surging inflation.  “Both equities and commodities had a big run,” said  Mike Ryan , the New York-based chief investment strategist for Wealth
Management Americas at UBS Financial Services Inc., which
oversees $741 billion. Following the U.S. jobs report, “anyone
wanting to take some profits now has an excuse to do it.”  Rallies in 2011  The S&P measure of commodities prices had surged 20 percent
in 2011 through April 29. The MSCI stock gauge closed at the
highest level since June 2008 on May 2 after rallying 8.2
percent since Dec. 31 following first-quarter earnings that beat
estimates from 57 percent of its companies that posted results
since April 11.  In addition to the employment data, a separate report today
showed the productivity of U.S. workers slowed in the first
quarter and labor costs rose as a growing economy prompted
companies to boost employment. The Bloomberg Consumer Comfort
Index dropped to minus 46.2, the lowest level in more than a
month, as rising fuel costs squeezed American household budgets.  “The economic outlook is looking more challenging,” said
Jason Brady, a managing director at Thornburg Investment
Management in  Santa Fe ,  New Mexico , which oversees about $84
billion in assets. “People have been crowding into stocks and
commodities, but with the additional slowdown in the U.S. and
the more difficult employment situation, there’s suddenly more
uncertainty.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
