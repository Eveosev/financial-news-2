German government bonds rose after
European Central Bank President Jean-Caude Trichet said the bank
will monitor upside inflation risks “very closely,” suggesting
it may wait until after June to raise interest rates again.  The two-year note yield fell seven basis points to 1.84
percent as of 1:35 p.m. in  London . Ten-year yields dropped four
basis points to 3.26 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
