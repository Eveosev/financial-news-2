Greece â€™s  Finance Ministry  collected 3
percent more revenue in April than in the year-earlier month,
 Athens  News Agency reported, without saying where it got the
information.  The improvement comes after three months of lagging
revenue, with total revenue for the year to date remaining more
than 1 billion euros ($1.5 billion) below the target set out in
the budget for 2011, ANA said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
