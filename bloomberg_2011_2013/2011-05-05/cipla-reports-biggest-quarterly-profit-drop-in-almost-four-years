Cipla Ltd.,  India ’s third-largest
drugmaker, posted its biggest drop in quarterly profit in almost
four years because of expenses for building a factory.  Net income dropped 22.8 percent to 2.14 billion rupees
($47.8 million) in the three months ended March 31, the company
said in a statement to the Bombay Stock Exchange. The steepest
decline in profit since June 2007 and the third successive
quarter where profit missed analysts’ estimates.  Costs at Cipla’s manufacturing plant in Indore in India’s
Madhya Pradesh state have been high because of one-time expenses
in getting regulatory approvals. The plant will become
profitable from this quarter, Chief Financial Officer S. Radhakrishnan said in a conference call today.  The company expects revenue to grow at between 10 percent
and 12 percent in the year ending March 31, Radhakrishnan said.  Profit in the quarter also fell because of a lack of one-
time gain. The company last year sold its “i-pill”
contraceptive drug brand for 950 million rupees.  Cipla fell 1.8 percent to 303.65 rupees at the 3:30 p.m.
close in Mumbai. India’s benchmark Sensitive index dropped 1.4
percent. The results were announced after the market closed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
