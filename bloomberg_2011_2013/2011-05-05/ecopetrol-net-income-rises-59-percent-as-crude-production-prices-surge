Ecopetrol SA (ECOPETL) ,  Colombia ’s largest oil
company, said first-quarter profit rose 59 percent as production
jumped and the price of crude surged.  Net income increased to 3.11 trillion pesos ($1.76 billion)
from 1.95 trillion pesos a year earlier, the state-controlled
company said today in a statement. Revenue rose 41 percent to
14.4 trillion pesos as output climbed 17 percent to 686,200
barrels a day.  Bogota-based Ecopetrol has embarked on an $80 billion plan
to increase production to 1.3 million barrels per day in 2020 by
tapping reserves in Colombia, the U.S. Gulf of  Mexico ,  Peru  and
Brazil through exploration and asset purchases.  Ecopetrol “should be able to maintain the trend” of
production increases, Samuel David Garcia, an analyst at Valores
BanColombia SA, said May 2 in a telephone interview in Bogota.
“They have the firepower to make new acquisitions.” He doesn’t
own shares in Ecopetrol and Valores doesn’t rate the stock.  First quarter operating income jumped 57 percent to 5.7
trillion pesos from 3.6 trillion pesos in the same period last
year, according to the company’s statement.  Ecopetrol’s production rose from an average of 586,000
barrels per day in the year-earlier period. In all of 2010,
Ecopetrol’s average output was 615,900 barrels per day. The
company aims to increase production to 1 million barrels a day
by 2015.  Luring Billionaires  Government inroads against guerrilla groups have improved
security, luring investors including billionaires  Eike Batista 
and  Carlos Slim , whose Grupo Carso SAB stepped into Colombian
oil exploration this year.  Grupo Carso bought a stake in Geoprocesados SA’s Tabasco
Oil Co., which is exploring in eastern Colombia in an area where
Ecopetrol taps crude reserves.  “Colombia is on investors’ radar,” Natalia Agudelo, a
Medellin-based analyst at Celfin Capital SA, said in a telephone
interview May 2. “The risk of Colombia has decreased, though it
hasn’t been eliminated.”  Ecopetrol had to repair pipelines in eastern and southern
Colombia this year because of sabotage. The attacks on the
Trasandino and the Cano Limon Covenas pipelines didn’t affect
production, the company has said.  Military strikes against guerrilla groups has reduced
offenses on pipelines, roadways and bridges to 76 in 2009 from
more than 800 in 2002, according to government figures.  ‘Closing In’  Colombia may produce 1.7 million barrels of crude and
natural gas a day in 2020, “closing in” on  Brazil ,  South
America ’s second-largest producer after Venezuela, Energy and
Mines Minister Carlos Rodado said in an interview last month.  A venture formed by Ecopetrol and Talisman Energy Inc.
after their $1.75 billion purchase of assets last quarter from
BP Plc will begin exploratory drilling next year for natural gas
offshore in the Caribbean. The venture, called Equion Energia
Ltd., may begin production in 2016, Equion President Maria
Victoria Riano said in an interview last month.  Petroleo Brasileiro SA, Brazil’s state-controlled oil
company, also is a partner in the blocks off the nation’s
northern coast.  Rising Production  The nation’s production jumped to a monthly record of
903,000 barrels a day in April, according to the state-run
 National Hydrocarbons Agency .  Colombia’s government said in March it will sell as much as
1.5 percent of Ecopetrol at year-end as part of a plan to
ultimately divest up to 10 percent.  Ecopetrol rose 5 pesos to 3,800 pesos in Bogota trading.
The stock has fallen 7.3 percent this year. Colombia’s benchmark
Colcap index had dropped 8.4 percent in the same period. The
earnings report was released after the close of regular trading.  Crude for June delivery lost as much as 63 cents to $108.61
a barrel in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . The contract was at $108.69 at 9:13 a.m. Sydney time.  Oil in  New York  settled at $113.93 a barrel on April 29,
the highest since September 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
