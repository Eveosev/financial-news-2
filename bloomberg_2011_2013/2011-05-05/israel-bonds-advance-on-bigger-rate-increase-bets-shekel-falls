Israel ’s 10-year government bond rose,
pushing the yield to the lowest in more than a week, on
speculation the central bank may raise rates more than expected
this month as inflation accelerates. The shekel weakened.  World food prices increased to near a record high in April
as grain costs advanced, adding pressure to inflation that is
accelerating from Beijing to Brasilia and spurring central banks
to raise  interest rates . An index of 55 commodities rose to 232
points from a revised 231 points in March, the  United Nations ’
Rome-based Food and Agriculture Organization said in a report on
its website today. Israeli inflation accelerated to 4.3 percent
in March, above the government’s 1 percent to 3 percent range.  “Yields are on a downward slope as rising inflation is
raising bets of a larger-than-expected rate increase of 50 basis
points,” Alex Zabezhinsky, chief economist at Tel Aviv-based DS
Securities & Investments Ltd., said by telephone. Yields are
also tracking Treasuries on concern the  U.S. economy  may recover
at a slower pace, he said.  The yield on the benchmark Mimshal Shiklit note due January
2020 fell 3 basis points to 5.29 percent at 2:09 p.m. in Tel
Aviv, the lowest level since April 26. The shekel weakened for a
third day against the dollar, declining 0.4 percent to 3.4074.  The  Bank of Israel  has increased interest rates by 2.5
percentage points since August 2009 in an attempt to rein in
inflation, bringing borrowing costs to 3 percent at the end of
March. Research staff at the central bank expect the benchmark
rate to increase to 4.4 percent, the bank said on April 24.  The central bank will raise the main rate by a quarter
percentage point to 3.25 percent at its next rate-setting
meeting May 23, according to 10 of 11 economists, including
Zabezhinsky, in a Bloomberg survey. The remaining estimate is
for the rate to remain at 3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
