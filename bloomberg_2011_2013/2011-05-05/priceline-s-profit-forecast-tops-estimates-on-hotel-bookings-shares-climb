Priceline.com Inc. (PCLN) , the biggest U.S.
online travel agency by market value, forecast second-quarter
profit that exceeded analysts’ estimates as the company bolsters
hotel bookings in  Europe  and  Asia .  Profit excluding some items in the current period will be
$4.70 a share to $4.90 a share, the Norwalk, Connecticut-based
company said today in a statement. That exceeded the $4.44-a-
share average estimate of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. The
stock rose in extended trading.  Priceline’s  Booking.com  business in Amsterdam is signing up
more hotels across Europe as travelers gravitate to the Web to
plan trips. The company’s first-quarter international revenue
jumped 80 percent to $389.1 million, topping rival  Expedia Inc. (EXPE) ,
which last week reported a 31 percent gain to $327 million.
Priceline, known in the U.S. for its name-your-own-price service,
expanded into Europe by purchasing Booking.com in 2005, and to
Asia with the acquisition of Bangkok-based Agoda.com in 2007.  The online leisure-travel market may grow 16 percent in the
U.S. to $113 billion next year from $97 billion in 2010,
according to research firm  PhoCusWright Inc.  The U.S. represents
about half of the global market.  S&P 500 Leader  Before today, Priceline shares had jumped fivefold in the
past two years, topping every other stock in the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index. In the past 12 months, Priceline has more than
doubled, while Bellevue, Washington-based Expedia has gained 5
percent and  Orbitz Worldwide Inc. (OWW)  in  Chicago  has tumbled about
57 percent.  Priceline shares fell $3.59 to $533.97 at 4 p.m. New York
time in Nasdaq Stock Market trading before today’s earnings
report. The stock gained as much as 3.1 percent to $550.59 after
the release.  Separately, Priceline promoted Christopher Soder to chief
executive officer of the North American business. Kees Koolen,
CEO of the Booking.com unit, is becoming chairman. The company
said it’s searching for Koolen’s successor as CEO of Booking.com.  First-quarter profit and sales also topped analysts’
estimates. Net income surged 95 percent to $104.8 million, or
$2.05 a share, from $53.9 million, or $1.06 a share, a year
earlier. Revenue jumped 38 percent to $809.3 million. Analysts
on average predicted profit of $1.76 a share and sales of $780.3
million, according to a Bloomberg survey. Excluding certain
costs, profit was $2.66 a share, beating the $2.46 average
estimate.  International Growth  For the second quarter, Priceline expects total gross
bookings to increase as much as 58 percent from a year earlier,
led by a jump of as much as 81 percent in international markets.
Revenue will rise 36 percent to 41 percent from a year earlier,
indicating sales may reach as much as $1.08 billion. Analysts
expected revenue of $1 billion.  Priceline is also benefiting from the acquisition a year
ago of TravelJigsaw Ltd., a U.K.-based car-rental service.
First-quarter results included $95.7 million of gross bookings
from that business, up from $55 million in the fourth quarter.  Competition for investor dollars may increase with more
online travel companies preparing to sell shares to the public.
Kayak Software Corp., a travel search engine, and HomeAway Inc.,
an online vacation-rental site, have filed for their initial
public offerings in the past six months, while Expedia announced
plans last month to spin off its TripAdvisor unit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
