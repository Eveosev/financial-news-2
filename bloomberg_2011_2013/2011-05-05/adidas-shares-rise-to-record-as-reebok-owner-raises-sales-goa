Adidas AG (ADS) , the world’s second-largest
sporting-goods maker, rose to a record in Frankfurt trading
after the owner of Reebok reported a 25 percent profit increase
and said it’s more optimistic about sales growth this year.  The shares rose 3.62 euros, or 7.3 percent, to 53.50 euros,
their highest ever closing price and the biggest daily increase
since June 10, 2009.  Revenue in 2011 will grow at a “high single-digit”
percentage pace from last year’s record 12 billion euros ($17.83
billion), Adidas said today. It had previously predicted mid to
high single-digit growth. First-quarter net income rose to 209
million euros, the company also said, beating the 183 million-
euro average estimate of eight analysts.  Sales rose 22 percent to 3.27 billion euros, led by growth
of 27 percent at the  Reebok  unit, which is adding toning shoes
and retro sneakers to capitalize on growth in personal-fitness
spending. Herzogenaurach, Germany-based Adidas aims to expand in
 China ,  Russia  and North America, where it plans to generate
about half of its targeted 50 percent sales increase by 2015.  “Today’s figures were all very good,” said Christoph Schlienkamp, an analyst at Bankhaus Lampe in Dusseldorf.
“Adidas is still conservative with its profit outlook as it
sees some risks related to the global economy.” Schlienkamp has
a “buy” recommendation on the stock.  Earnings Outlook  Earnings per share will increase 10 percent to 15 percent
this year after more than doubling in 2010, Adidas said,
repeating an earlier forecast. Per-share earnings in the quarter
rose to 1 euro a share, from 80 cents a year earlier.  Reebok, the U.S. brand that Adidas acquired in 2006, aims
to get profitability closer to the level of its parent company
in the next five years, unit chief Uli Becker said in an
interview last month. The brand’s gross margin widened by 4
percentage points to 35.9 percent last year, compared with 47.8
percent for the Adidas group.  Revenue increased 22 percent at Adidas’s namesake brand and
26 percent at the golfing-equipment business in the quarter.
Sales increased 43 percent to 284 million euros in Greater
China, added 28 percent in  Europe ’s emerging countries and
advanced at about the same pace in  North America , Adidas said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
