The Czech Republic’s benchmark equity
index retreated the most in 2 1/2 weeks, led by  Komercni Banka
AS (KOMB)  and  Erste Group Bank AG (RBAG)  after earnings at European financial
companies disappointed investors.  The 15-member PX gauge, where Komercni and Erste have a
combined 37 percent weighting, slid 1.1 percent to 1,258.9 at
its 4:25 p.m. close in Prague, the biggest drop since April 18.  Komercni declined 0.9 percent to 4,295 koruna, its lowest
close in more than a week, after posting lower-than-expected
first-quarter net income. Erste fell 1.8 percent to 821 koruna.
Equities fell across  Europe  after profit at Lloyds Banking Group
Plc and Komercni’s owner, France’s Societe Generale SA, also
missed analyst estimates.  Telefonica O2 Czech Republic AS (SPTT) , the biggest phone operator
in the country, lost 0.5 percent to 414 koruna, its lowest close
in more than two weeks, after Erste cut its rating to “hold”
from “accumulate” in a report today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
