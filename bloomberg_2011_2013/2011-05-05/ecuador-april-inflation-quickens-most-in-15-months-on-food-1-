Ecuador ’s monthly inflation 
accelerated at the fastest pace in 15 months in April on higher
education, food and beverage prices.  Consumer prices climbed 0.82 percent in April from the
previous month while annual inflation quickened to 3.88 percent
in April from the same month a year earlier, the National
Statistics Institute reported today on its  Website .  Prices in Ecuador normally rise in April as students in
coastal region return to school, Byron Villacis, director of the
institute, said today in a phone interview. Inflation was also
pressured by the La Nina weather phenomenon, as droughts on the
coast and flooding in the Andean highlands destroyed crops and
disrupted food supplies, he said.  “This type of climatic effect has an impact on the chain
of production, hitting food stocks, which raises prices,”
Villacis said. “Now is when we are seeing all this reflecting
on prices.”  Rainfall last month in the capital,  Quito , was the heaviest
in 37 years, Quito Mayor Augusto Barrera said in a May 2
interview on state-owned Ecuador TV.  The government declared an emergency in five coastal
provinces on April 1 after drought destroyed 180,000 hectares
(445,000 acres) of rice and corn and damaged banana crops,
according to the nation’s Agriculture Ministry.  Education costs increased 1.62 percent in April from the
previous month and 3.99 percent from the previous year, the
report said. The price of foods and non-alcoholic beverages rose
1.49 percent from a month earlier and 6.03 percent from the same
month last year, according to the report.  Producer prices fell for a second month, declining 0.26
percent in April from the previous month while rising 4.41
percent from the previous year, the institute said.  Inflation may quicken to 3.69 percent this year while the
economy is forecast to expand 5.06 percent, according to the
nation’s 2011 budget.  To contact the reporter on this story:
