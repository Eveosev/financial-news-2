Canadian Natural Resources Ltd. (CNQ)  said
it expects production to resume at its Horizon oil-sands project
in the third quarter.  Mechanical repairs at two damaged coke drums at the
northeastern Alberta plant are expected to be complete in mid-
June, followed by several weeks of commissioning, Steve Laut,
president of the Calgary-based company, said. The remaining two
units will be restarted in the middle of the third quarter, he
said.  Horizon’s four coke drums were damaged in an explosion Jan.
6 that shut the plant, which can produce 110,000 barrels of
synthetic  crude oil  daily. A late winter cold snap caused more
freezing damage than the company anticipated, pushing back the
original repair timeline from the second quarter. The first two
units will produce about 55,000 barrels a day, Laut said.  “We expect to have the mechanical work completed in June”
on the first set of coke drums, Laut told reporters on the
sidelines of the company’s annual meeting in Calgary. The cost
of the repair will be between C$350 million ($362 million) and
C$450 million, up from previous estimates of C$300 million to
C$400 million, he said.  The start of the second set of coke drums is expected
almost immediately after they are repaired, he said, which will
bring the plant back to its 110,000-barrel-a-day capacity. A
turnaround previously scheduled for 2012 will be canceled as the
maintenance is being done during the repairs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
