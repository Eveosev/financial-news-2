Palm oil  fell for a second day,
tracking declines in soybeans, which fell on speculation that
persistent rains in the growing regions in the U.S. will
encourage farmers to plant more of the oilseed than corn.  The July-delivery contract declined 1.1 percent to 3,229
ringgit ($1,076) a metric ton on the Malaysia Derivatives
Exchange, the lowest close since Nov. 24, erasing gains of as
much as 0.8 percent in intraday trading.  Rain in the Northern Plains in the U.S. will likely slow
planting of corn, soybeans and spring wheat, while heavier
precipitation is expected to return to the Midwest next week,
Telvent DTN Inc. said in a forecast yesterday.  “Wet-weather forecast in the U.S. may prompt the
farmers to go for soybean planting rather than corn planting,”
 Veeresh Hiremath , associate chief analyst with Karvy Comtrade
Ltd., said by phone from the Indian city of Hyderabad. “Global
demand is declining, especially from  China .”  Palm oil also fell after a drop in crude  oil prices  eroded
the appeal of the vegetable oil for biofuel usage, he said.  Oil declined for a fourth day in  New York , the longest
losing streak in eight weeks, as a drop in gasoline demand added
to signs of slowing growth in the U.S., the world’s biggest
crude consumer. Crude for June delivery lost as much as $3.04 to
$106.20 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , the lowest
since April 14.  A “better” soybean crop in  Latin America , “improving”
output in Malaysia and Indonesia and “sluggish” exports to
China and India have sent prices lower, Standard Chartered
analyst Abah Ofon said in a report yesterday. “We expect
resurgent demand from China and India to buoy prices” in the
second half, he wrote.  Production Outlook  Palm oil has dropped 19 percent from a 35-month high of
3,967 ringgit reached on Feb. 10 on an outlook for improving
production.  July-delivery soybeans fell as much as 0.9 percent to
$13.3950 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade, while soybean
oil for delivery in the same month dropped as much as 1 percent
to 56.61 cents and was at 56.69 at 7:31 p.m. Palm oil and
 soybean oil  are substitutes in food and fuel uses.  January-delivery palm oil on the Dalian Commodity Exchange
closed little changed at 9,084 yuan ($1,399) a ton. Soybean oil
for delivery in the same month declined 0.2 percent to 10,106
yuan a ton at the close.  CME Group Inc.’s most-active July palm-oil contract, pegged
to the Malaysian benchmark, advanced 1.2 percent to $1,095 a ton
at 3:43 p.m. Singapore time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
