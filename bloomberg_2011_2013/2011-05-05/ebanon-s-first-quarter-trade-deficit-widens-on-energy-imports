Lebanon’s trade deficit widened 8
percent in the first quarter from the year-earlier period on
higher energy imports, the finance ministry said in an e-mailed
statement.  The shortfall increased to $3.6 billion from $3.3 billion,
the Beirut-based ministry said. Imports rose 4 percent to $4.5
billion, driven by an 8 percent increase in the cost of mineral
fuels and oils, it said.  Exports decreased 7 percent from a year earlier to $955
million, due to a decline in exports to Arab countries.  To contact the reporter on this story:
