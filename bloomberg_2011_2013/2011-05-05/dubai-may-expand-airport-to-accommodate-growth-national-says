Dubai may expand the terminal serving
low-cost carriers at its present passenger airport as the shift
of tourist traffic to the new Al Maktoum International Airport
is delayed,  The National  reported, citing authorities.  The emirateâ€™s airport operator, Dubai Airports, is
developing a plan to provide extra capacity, the newspaper said,
citing the company. Authorities issued a tender to build an
additional terminal hall at the existing airport, The National
said, citing an advertisement for the work.  To contact the reporter on this story:
