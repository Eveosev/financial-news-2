TGS-Nopec Geophysical Co. ASA, a
Norwegian surveyor of  oil deposits , rose the most in five months
in Oslo after first-quarter profit beat analyst estimates.  TGS gained as much as 9.8 percent to 141.2 kroner, the
steepest intraday advance since Dec. 2, and was at 139.7 kroner
as of 11:07 a.m. local time. That valued the Asker, Norway-based
company at 14.5 billion kroner ($2.7 billion).  Net income of $41.6 million was in line with earnings of
$42 million from the year-earlier period. Profit beat the $31.7
million average of 12 analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.
Sales slipped 11 percent to $132 million, compared with analyst
estimates of $115 million.  “TGS delivers outstanding first-quarter results both on an
absolute and in particular relative basis,” Pareto Securities
AS, which has a “buy” rating, wrote in a note to clients.
“TGS remains the most attractively valued large-cap oil service
name and is well on track to meet our above-guidance revenue
estimate.”  TGS reiterated its guidance of sales for the full-year to
rise to $600 million to $650 million from $568 million in 2010,
as exploration and production companies increase spending amid
rising oil prices. Revenue is expected to reach $642 million
this year, according to the average estimate in a Bloomberg
survey of 15 analysts.  The company reported late sales of $84.8 million, up 16
percent from the previous year.  “We are pleased to report record high late sales for a
first quarter period and a promising start of a new year,”
Chief Executive Officer Robert Hobbs said in the statement.
“These results put us well on track with our 2011 plan.”  The company’s order backlog reached $109.9 million by the
end of the quarter, up 2 percent from a year earlier. The
backlog is expected to gain in line with higher investments
forecast in the second half of the year, the company said.  TGS, which has not traditionally paid a dividend, last
quarter proposed a payment of 5 kroner a share for 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
