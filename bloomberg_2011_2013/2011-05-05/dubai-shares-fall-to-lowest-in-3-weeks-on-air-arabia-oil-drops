Dubai shares fell to the lowest level
in three weeks, leading a decline in Persian Gulf stocks, as  Air
Arabia (AIRARABI)  reported a drop in first-quarter earnings and oil
retreated for a fourth day.  Air Arabia, the Middle East’s biggest low-cost airline,
tumbled to the lowest on record.  Emaar Properties PJSC (EMAAR) , the
builder of the world’s tallest skyscraper in Dubai, fell to the
lowest level in a month. The benchmark DFM General Index
retreated 0.7 percent to 1,607.29 at the 2:00 p.m. close in the
emirate, the lowest since April 13. The measure has lost 1.6
percent this week. The Bloomberg GCC200 Index, which tracks 200
companies in the region, dropped 0.2 percent.  “We have reached the end of the earnings season and the
market is lacking conviction,” said Mahdi Mattar, head of
research at Abu Dhabi-based CAPM Investment PJSC. “Investors
don’t see any strong catalyst to push them to accumulate more.”  Dubai’s gauge rallied 19 percent from a low on March 3,
driven in part by optimism that the  United Arab Emirates  will
secure an upgrade to emerging market status at index provider
MSCI Inc. The U.A.E. stock exchanges last week delayed the
implementation of a new settlement system until May 29. The so-
called delivery-versus-payment is one of MSCI’s criteria for an
upgrade.  Oil declined for a fourth day in  New York , the longest
losing streak in almost eight weeks, as a drop in gasoline
consumption added to signs of slowing growth in the  U.S.
economy , the world’s biggest crude consumer. Crude for June
delivery lost as much as $3.04 to $106.20 a barrel in electronic
trading on the  New York Mercantile Exchange .  Air Arabia dropped 1.6 percent to 73 fils. First-quarter
net income retreated to 42.7 million dirhams ($11.6 million)
from 49.6 million dirhams a year earlier. Emaar declined 1.5
percent to 3.19 dirhams, the lowest level since April 6.  Abu Dhabi’s  ADX General Index (ADSMI)  dropped 0.1 percent, Qatar’s
index fell 0.5 percent and Bahrain’s BB All Share Index dropped
0.2 percent. Oman’s gauge gained 0.1 percent. Saudi Arabia’s
exchange is closed for the weekend.  To contact the reporter on this story:
