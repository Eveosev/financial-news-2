Canada ’s dollar dropped for a fourth
straight day in the longest losing streak since December as
crude oil tumbled below $100 a barrel.  The loonie, as the currency is nicknamed, slid against the
yen and pound as a decrease in U.S. demand for gasoline added to
signs of slowing growth for Canada’s biggest trading partner.
Commodities dropped the most in almost two years on speculation
global economic growth will slow. Raw materials including crude
oil account for about half of Canada’s export revenue.  “Almost all of the move is coming from the commodity
market,” said  Camilla Sutton , chief currency strategist at the
capital markets unit of Bank of Nova Scotia in Toronto.
“Commodity markets are small markets, and when you have a lot
of investors moving toward one small market, it tends to push
prices up beyond their natural, or valuation, level.”  The loonie depreciated 0.8 percent to 96.69 cents versus
the greenback at 5 p.m. in Toronto, from 95.94 cents yesterday,
after declining as much as 1.2 percent to 97.13 cents, the
weakest level since April 18. One Canadian dollar buys $1.0342.
The Canadian currency touched 94.46 cents on April 29, the
strongest since November 2007.  Futures on crude oil, Canada’s biggest export, fell as much
as 11 percent to $98.25 a barrel before trading at $99.83. U.S.
stockpiles climbed to the highest level since October, and
gasoline consumption slipped to a four-week low, the U.S. Energy
Department said yesterday.  Raw Materials  Tumble  The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Index of 24 raw materials
declined 6.3 percent today. Silver, crude oil and heating oil
led the declines.  “The last two weeks, especially in silver and others,
there’s been pure speculative froth in the market, which you
always find at the end of a strong move,” said Joseph Trevisani, chief market analyst at FX Solutions Inc. in Saddle
River,  New Jersey .  Soros Fund Management LLC, the $28 billion hedge fund run
by Keith Anderson, has sold much of its gold and silver
holdings, the Wall Street Journal reported yesterday, citing
unidentified people. Many of the sales took place over the past
month, according to the report.  The euro slid today against most of its major counterparts
including the Canadian dollar after European Central Bank
President  Jean-Claude Trichet  said inflation risks will be
watched “very closely,” signaling the ECB may wait until after
June to raise  interest rates  again. European policy makers left
the main refinancing rate unchanged at 1.25 percent today.  Loonie Versus Euro  The Canadian dollar gained 1.2 percent to C$1.4059 versus
the euro, declined 1.4 percent to 82.81 yen and slid 0.2 percent
to C$1.5846 against the pound.  Government bonds  advanced, with the yield on the 10-year
security down two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to
3.18 percent. The price of the 3.25 percent security maturing in
June 2021 advanced 18 cents to C$100.58.  The loonie remained lower versus the greenback after a
report showed purchasing by Canadian governments and companies
advanced in April at a slower rate. The Ivey purchasing
managers’ index dropped on a seasonally adjusted basis to 57.8,
the lowest level since January, according to the University of
Western Ontario business school’s website. Readings of more than
50 indicate purchasing rose.  Employers in Canada added 20,000 positions in April after a
decrease of 1,500 in the previous month, according to the median
forecast of 25 economists in a Bloomberg News survey before a
report tomorrow from  Statistics Canada . The  unemployment rate 
may have stayed at 7.7 percent. America gained 185,000 jobs,
according to the median forecast before the U.S. Labor
Department’s payrolls report.  To contact the reporter for this story:
