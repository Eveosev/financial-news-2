Corn futures advanced for a second day
on concern persistent rain in growing regions in the U.S. will
further delay planting in the world’s largest grower and
exporter of the grain, potentially lowering yields.  July-delivery corn gained 0.9 percent to $7.3625 a bushel
on the  Chicago  Board of Trade at 2:41 p.m. Singapore time. The
most-active contract has almost doubled in the past year and on
April 11 touched $7.8875, the highest price since June 2008.  Rain in the Northern Plains in the U.S. will likely slow
planting of corn, soybeans and spring wheat, while heavier
precipitation is expected to return to the Midwest next week,
derailing fieldwork, Telvent DTN Inc. said in a forecast
yesterday. Global corn inventories were predicted to be about
14.6 percent of demand before this year’s Northern Hemisphere
harvest, the smallest in 37 years, according to U.S. Department
of Agriculture data.  “Tight old-crop corn supplies, plus persistent wet weather
planting delays in the U.S. supported prices,”  Luke Mathews , a
commodity strategist at Commonwealth Bank of  Australia , said in
a report today.  About 13 percent of the corn crop was planted as of May 1,
the USDA said in a report a day later. That’s the slowest pace
since 1995, when only 10 percent of the crop was planted that
week, according to USDA data tracked by Bloomberg. The average
for that time of the year was 40 percent between 2006 and 2010,
the USDA said.  U.S. farmers need to sow about 85 percent of the crop by
May 15 or face higher risks that yields will fall below the
historical average as the plants get exposed to hot weather when
they pollinate, Jay O’Neil, an adviser to the U.S. Grains
Council, said April 27.  Inventories Drop  The global inventory of corn was estimated by the USDA to
drop 16 percent to 122.4 million metric tons at the end of this
marketing year, while demand was forecast to rise 2.8 percent to
838.3 million tons a year earlier.  Those stockpiles will  drop for a third year  to 111 million
tons, or about 13 percent of consumption in the 2011-2012 season,
according to International Grains Council data released on April
20. That’s the smallest stockpiles-to-use ratio since 1974, when
it was at 11.8 percent, according to USDA data.  Wheat for July delivery gained as much as 0.9 percent to
$7.7875 a bushel in Chicago, reversing a 0.3 percent loss
earlier. It traded at $7.7750 at 3 p.m. Singapore time.  Wheat-growing areas in central  China  are unlikely to get
enough rain to prevent “significant declines” in yields, DTN
said. China is the world’s largest grower and consumer of grain.  “Rain is needed, especially for jointing to reproductive
wheat, to prevent significant declines in yield potential,”
 Bryce Anderson , a meteorologist at DTN said yesterday. Jointing
is a stage in crop development where stems emerge from the plant.  July-delivery soybeans climbed 0.6 percent to $13.595 a
bushel, after losing 0.3 percent earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
