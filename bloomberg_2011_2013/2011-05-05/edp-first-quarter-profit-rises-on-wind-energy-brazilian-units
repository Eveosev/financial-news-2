EDP-Energias de Portugal SA, the
country’s biggest utility, said first-quarter profit rose 11
percent on higher output from wind energy projects and earnings
from its Brazilian unit and regulated networks business.  Net income climbed to 342 million euros ($499 million) from
309 million euros a year earlier, Lisbon-based EDP said today in
a regulatory filing. That beat the 286 million-euro mean
estimate of analysts in a Bloomberg survey.  The former Portuguese power monopoly is spending on new
dams and wind turbines in  Europe ,  Brazil  and the U.S. to rely
less on oil and coal while tapping government incentives for
alternative energy. The utility in November cut its average
annual investment target for 2011 and 2012 to 2.1 billion euros
from an earlier forecast of 2.4 billion euros a year.  EDP on March 4 said it plans to invest about 2.2 billion
euros in 2011 and 2 billion euros in 2012, and said it forecasts
“low single digit growth” in earnings before interest, tax,
depreciation and amortization and in profit for 2011. EDP on
March 3 said it aims to raise 500 million euros in asset sales
this year.  Ebitda rose 7.3 percent to 1.01 billion euros in the first
quarter. Ebitda from the wind energy division climbed 19
percent. Net debt decreased to 16 billion euros at the end of
March from 16.35 billion euros in December, the company said.  Installed Capacity  EDP last year forecast total installed capacity will
increase 20 percent to 24.6 gigawatts in 2012, with wind
projects and hydropower plants accounting for 66 percent. A 1-
megawatt plant can supply about 1,000 average European homes.
The company’s installed capacity increased 7 percent to 22
gigawatts in 2010.  EDP Renovaveis SA (EDPR) , the company’s renewable-energy division,
plans to install 0.8 gigawatts to 0.9 gigawatts of capacity a
year in 2011 and 2012.  EDP fell 1.1 percent to close at 2.67 euros in Lisbon today
before the earnings announcement. The stock has climbed 7.2
percent this year, giving the company a market value of 9.76
billion euros. The  Portuguese government  owns 20 percent of EDP
and state-owned bank Caixa Geral de Depositos SA holds 5
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
