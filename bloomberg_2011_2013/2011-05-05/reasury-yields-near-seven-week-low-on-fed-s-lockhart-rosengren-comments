Treasury 30-year bonds gained for a
sixth day, the longest winning streak since December 2008, as a
plunge in commodities and stocks and a rise in weekly jobless
claims eased concern inflation is accelerating.  Yields on benchmark 10-year notes fell to a six-week low and
rates on six-month bills touched a record for a fourth
consecutive day before a report tomorrow that’s forecast to show
job growth slowed in April. The premium investors demand to hold
Treasuries instead of 10-year inflation-protected debt dropped
to the lowest in a month. The  Federal Reserve  purchased $1.9
billion in Treasuries maturing from August 2028 to February
2041. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index dropped 1.2 percent.  “Commodities and other assets are coming off, and some of
that money is coming back into the Treasury market,” said
 Thomas Tucci , head of U.S. government bond trading at Royal bank
of  Canada ’s RBC Capital Markets unit in New York, one of 20
firms that trade directly with the Fed. “The economic forecasts
have been pulled back dramatically. Guys have been caught
offside.”  The yield on the 30-year bond fell seven basis points, or
0.07 percentage point, to 4.26 percent at 5:01 p.m. in New York,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. It touched 4.25
percent, the least since Dec. 7. The 4.75 percent security due
in February 2041 rose 1 5/32, or $11.56 per $1,000 face amount,
to 108 9/32.  Notes, Bills  The 10-year note yield fell seven basis points to 3.15
percent, after touching the lowest since March 17. Six-month
bill rates traded at 0.06 percent after touching a record low
0.05 percent.  Commodities dropped the most in almost two years, paring
this year’s gains to 10 percent, on speculation that economic
growth will slow.  The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Index of 24 raw materials fell
as much as 5.9 percent to 688.25, the biggest drop since June
22, 2009. The gauge has retreated for four days, the longest
losing streak since mid-March. Silver, crude oil and heating oil
led the declines.  “The professional traders misread the tea leaves and
thought the economy was going to turn the corner,” said  Michael Franzese , managing director and head of Treasury trading at
Wunderlich Securities Inc. in New York. “This economy is not
turning around anytime soon, so it’s curtailing inflation. You
go into a safety-type trade.”  The difference between yields on 10-year notes and Treasury
Inflation Protected Securities, a gauge of expectations for
consumer prices over the life of the debt, decreased to 2.47
percentage points, the narrowest since March 31. It widened to
2.67 percentage points on April 11, the most in three years.  Inflation Factor  TIPS are intended to provide a hedge against rising
consumer prices. The securities rise or fall in value tracking
changes in the  consumer price index  calculated by the Labor
Department. Inflation adjustments will be added to the notes’
principal and be payable at maturity.  Crude oil for June delivery lost as much as 10.1 percent to
$98.25 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . Silver for
July delivery in New York fell as much as 9.6 percent to a one-
month low of $35.60 an ounce.  “This is more a correction in commodities as the market
comes to grips that economic growth may be a bit weaker,” said
Anthony Chan, chief economist in New York at JPMorgan Chase &
Co.’s private wealth management unit.  Debt Returns  Government debt rallied last month as Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  signaled on April 27 that the central bank will
maintain its record stimulus when it ends purchases of
 government securities . Treasuries have returned 0.3 percent this
month after a 1.2 percent gain last month, according to Bank of
America Merrill Lynch data.  Fed Bank of Minneapolis President Narayana Kocherlakota
said it would be “desirable” to lift the target for the
benchmark U.S. interest rate by a “modest amount” this year,
based on his inflation forecast.  The  Federal Open Market Committee  “should raise the fed
funds rate by around 50 basis points” if  core inflation  rises
by 1.5 percent this year, he said today in remarks prepared for
a speech in  Santa Barbara ,  California . “Under my baseline
forecast, it would be desirable for the FOMC to raise the fed
funds target interest rate by a modest amount toward the end of
2011,” said Kocherlakota, who votes on monetary policy.  FOMC Votes  Bernanke and his colleagues on the FOMC said last week that
the economy, which has added an average of 149,000 jobs a month
during the past six months, is recovering at a “moderate
pace.” Policy makers have held the target rate for overnight
lending between banks at zero to 0.25 percent since December
2008 and aim to complete $600 billion of Treasury purchases by
the end of June.  Applications for jobless benefits jumped by 43,000 to
474,000 in the week ended April 30, Labor Department figures
showed today. A spring break holiday in  New York , a new
emergency benefits program in  Oregon  and auto shutdowns caused
by the disaster in  Japan  were the main reasons for the surge, a
Labor Department spokesman said as the data was released.  Employers added 185,000 jobs in April after an increase of
216,000 positions in the previous month, according to the median
forecast of 84 economists in a Bloomberg News survey. The Labor
Department’s payrolls report tomorrow may show unemployment held
at 8.8 percent, according to a separate survey.  To contact the reporters on this story:
