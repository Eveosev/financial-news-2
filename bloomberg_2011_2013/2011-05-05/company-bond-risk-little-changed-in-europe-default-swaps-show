The cost of insuring against default
on European corporate bonds was little changed, according to
traders of credit-default swaps.  Contracts on the Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 40
companies with mostly high-yield credit ratings rose 2 basis
points to 388, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. at 8:30 a.m. in
 London . The index is a benchmark for the cost of protecting
bonds against default and an increase signals worsening
perceptions of  credit quality .  The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125 companies with
investment-grade ratings was unchanged at 104 basis points,
JPMorgan prices show. The Markit iTraxx Financial Index of 25
banks and insurers rose 0.5 to 152.5 and the subordinated index
dropped 1 basis point to 252.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($14.7 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer
face value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
