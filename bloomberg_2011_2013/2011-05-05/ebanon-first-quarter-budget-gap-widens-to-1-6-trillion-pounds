Lebanonâ€™s budget deficit almost
doubled in the first quarter from the year-earlier period as
revenue declined.  The deficit widened to 1.65 trillion Lebanese pounds ($1.1
billion) from 861 billion pounds, the  Ministry of Finance  said
in an e-mail today. Revenue slid 11.5 percent to 2.7 trillion
pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
