The German government will decide to
exempt electric cars from motor-vehicle taxes for 10 years in
the second half of May,  Bild  newspaper reported, without saying
where it got the information.  The government aims to boost the number of electric cars
driven in  Germany  to 1 million by 2020 and will buy
“thousands” of cars for public authorities, the newspaper
reported. It will double research funding for the car industry
to 1 billion euros ($1.5 billion) by 2013, Bild said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
