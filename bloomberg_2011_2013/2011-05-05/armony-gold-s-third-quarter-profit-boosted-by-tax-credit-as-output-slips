Harmony Gold Mining Ltd.,  Africa ’s
third-largest miner of the metal, reported production in the
first nine months of the fiscal year dropped 10 percent from a
year earlier and forecast lower annual output than planned.  “The production guidance we gave and what we’ve achieved
is disappointing,” Chief Executive Officer Graham Briggs said
on a conference call today. The Johannesburg-based company’s new
estimate is lower than the range of 1.45 million to 1.5 million
ounces it forecast in February, Briggs said, without being
specific. Harmony had aimed for 2 million ounces for 2013.  The lower output is preventing Harmony from fully taking
advantage of gold prices that climbed to a record $1,577.57 an
ounce May 2. They rose for each of the past 10 years, spurring
Briggs and rivals at  AngloGold Ashanti Ltd. (ANG)  and Gold Fields Ltd.
to expand. Gold may reach $1,800 an ounce in a year, he said.  Harmony fell 1.25 rand, or 1.3 percent, to 92.75 rand by
the 5 p.m. close of trading in Johannesburg, giving the company
a market value of 39.9 billion rand ($5.9 billion).  Third-quarter output of 316,909 ounces is a “significant”
miss, “clearly leading to a big miss on full-year guidance,”
RBC Capital Markets analyst  Leon Esterhuizen  wrote in a note.  Production in the first nine months fell to 976,834 ounces
from 1.08 million ounces a year earlier, Harmony said in a
statement. Disruption to a plant at the Doornkop mine in  South
Africa , a conveyor belt failure at Hidden Valley in  Papua New
Guinea  and a slow restart after December holidays hurt output in
the third quarter through March, Harmony said in a presentation.  Profit Focus  “It’s really a case of us focusing maybe a little bit less
on targets of production, but rather on targets of
profitability,” Briggs said. He has shut unprofitable mines in
South Africa and invested elsewhere, including the Hidden Valley
venture with Newcrest Mining Ltd., since becoming CEO in 2008.  Earnings excluding one-time items expanded 32 percent to 91
cents a share in the third quarter, from 69 cents in the prior
three months, after booking a tax credit, Harmony said. The
result missed the median estimate of 1.01 rand among four
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Analysts tracking Harmony use
quarter-on-quarter profit excluding one-time items.  To contact the reporter on this story:
