Turkish stocks climbed, led by banks
rallying on “expectations of strong earnings.” The lira swung
between gains and losses.  The main ISE National 100 rose as much as 0.4 percent to
69,708.79, and last traded up 0.1 percent to 69,482.10 at 3:45
p.m.  Turkey ’s banking index climbed 0.6 percent.  Banking stocks have gained 1.1 percent after state-run
Turkiye Halk Bankasi AS said net income unexpectedly rose an
annual 1.8 percent to 524.7 million liras ($339 million),
beating analysts’ estimates. Lenders make up 41 percent of
Turkey’s benchmark gauge.  “The sell-off in emerging markets has not hit Turkish
equities -- the expectations of strong earnings out of banks is
the main factor for this,” Isik Okte, a trader at Finans
Invest, said in a note to clients.  Turkiye Garanti Bankasi AS (GARAN) , which has a 14 percent
weighting in ISE index, climbed 1 percent, or 8 kurus, to 8.10
liras. The bank will announce first-quarter results today.
 Akbank TAS (AKBNK)  will report earnings tomorrow.  The lira appreciated as much as 0.6 percent and last traded
less than 0.1 percent weaker to 1.5477 per dollar. Two-year
benchmark bond yields climbed one basis point, 0.01 percentage
point, to 8.47 percent, according to the TEB Local Benchmark
Bond Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
