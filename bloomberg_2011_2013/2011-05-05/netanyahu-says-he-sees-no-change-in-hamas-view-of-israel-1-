Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said
he sees no change in the Islamic Hamas movement’s position
toward  Israel  after it reached an agreement on reconciliation
with the  Palestinian Authority .  “Hamas has not abandoned the goal of destroying Israel,”
Netanyahu said after a meeting with French President Nicolas Sarkozy in Paris today. Hamas “is not a partner for peace,”
the Israeli leader said.  Netanyahu was in France after visiting the U.K yesterday.
He traveled to Europe after the Palestinian Authority that rules
the West Bank and Hamas, which governs the  Gaza Strip , announced
yesterday they had reached an accord to end a nearly four-year
rift, hold elections and form a unity government.  The Israeli premier called the agreement a “victory for
terrorism” in London yesterday.  To contact the reporters on this story:
