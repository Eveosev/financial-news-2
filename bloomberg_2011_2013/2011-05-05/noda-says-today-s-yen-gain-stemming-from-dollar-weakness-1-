Japanese Finance Minister  Yoshihiko Noda  said that today’s appreciation in the yen is different from
the advance on March 18, when gains prompted the Group of Seven
to mount joint sales of the currency.  “This is different from that day’s moves in that this is in
the context of recent declines in the dollar -- and Japan’s
market is closed,” Noda told reporters today in Hanoi, where
he’s attending annual meetings of the  Asian Development Bank .
“That said, I will closely monitor the market.”  Noda spoke after the yen climbed past 80 per dollar for the
first time since the G-7’s intervention on March 18, which was
its first such step in more than a decade. Today’s jump spurred
speculation that  Japan  may again sell yen to avert damage to its
exporters’ competitiveness.  “Japan’s response is unlikely to be instantaneous,”  Gareth Berry , a currency strategist in Singapore at UBS AG, wrote in a
note to clients today. At the same time, he added that the 80
per dollar level “has a clear psychological significance, and
has previously been the scene of a tussle between the market and
Japan’s monetary authorities on March 18, 2011. Intervention
risk is therefore now extremely high.”  Asked whether Japan will intervene if yen gains continue,
Noda said “I won’t comment on a hypothetical situation.”  Japan’s currency traded at 79.81 per dollar as of 12:42 p.m.
in  London .  To contact the reporter on this story:
