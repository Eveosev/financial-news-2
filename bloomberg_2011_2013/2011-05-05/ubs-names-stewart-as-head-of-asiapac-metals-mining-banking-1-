UBS AG (UBS)  appointed Campbell Stewart as
head of metals and mining investment banking in the Asia-Pacific
region, according to an internal memo.  Stewart is currently head of resources banking in Australia
and runs investment banking in Melbourne. The 23-year UBS
veteran will keep his existing roles in addition to his new job,
according to the document. UBS spokesman  Chris Cockerill 
confirmed the contents of the memo.  The appointment follows the departure of Patrick Loftus- Hills, who joined Moelis & Co. as managing director of global
metals and mining in April. Stewart was involved in advising on
 China  Minmetals Group’s acquisition of OZ Minerals Ltd. and
Yanzhou Coal Mining Co.’s purchase of Felix Resources Ltd. in
2009, according to the internal document.  “ Australia  is the largest mining resources geography in
Asia Pacific and runs a deep and established sector team,”
Matthew Hanning, UBS’s head of investment banking for the Asia-
Pacific region, wrote in the memo. “Operating our team on an
Asia Pacific basis allows us to deliver deep sector knowledge
and deal experience to all of our clients around the region.”  James Teo, head of metals and mining for China, will
continue to lead the team in the country and in Hong Kong, while
Shiau Sin Yen will continue to focus on Southeast Asia and
Mongolia mining and helping international mining clients raise
money in Asia, Hanning said in the memo.  To contact the reporter on this story:
