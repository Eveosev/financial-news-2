Israel â€™s foreign currency reserves
increased to a record in April as the central bank resumed
purchases after a one-month hiatus.  Reserves rose to $77.4 billion from $74.5 billion at the
end of the previous month, the  Bank of Israel  said in an e-
mailed statement today. The  Bank of Israel  purchased close to
$1.5 billion in April, it said.  Changes in exchange rates resulted in a gain of $1.5
billion, the bank said.  The central bank has been buying foreign currency in most
months since March 2008, more than doubling reserves, in an
effort to moderate shekel gains and help exporters compete.  To contact the reporter on this story:
