Poland’s WIG20 Index declined 19.53,
or 0.7 percent, to 2,858.91 at 5:30 p.m. close in Warsaw, a
second day of decreases.  The following are among the most active stocks on the
 Warsaw Stock Exchange  today. Stock symbols follow company names.  KGHM Polska Miedz SA (KGH)  , Poland’s sole copper
producer, lost 7 zloty, or 3.7 percent, to 184.5 zloty, sliding
for a second day. Copper fell to the lowest price in more than
seven weeks in London on concern demand may weaken as central
banks around the world raise  interest rates  to curb inflation.  PKN Orlen SA (PKN PW), Poland’s biggest oil company, fell
1.15 zloty, or 2.1 percent, to 52.6 zloty, the lowest close
since March 30.  Grupa Lotos SA (LTS)  , the second-largest
refiner, lost 0.59 zloty, or 1.3 percent, to 44.91 zloty. Oil
declined the most in two years after an increase in jobless
claims in the U.S., bolstering concern that economic growth and
fuel demand will retreat.  Netia SA (NET)   jumped 0.14 zloty, or 2.6 percent, to
5.44 zloty, the biggest gain in more than four months. Poland’s
second-largest fixed-line phone company plans to buy back as
much as 12.5 percent of its shares for as much as 350 million
zloty ($128.9 million).  To contact the reporters on this story:
