Braga beat Benfica 1-0 to set up an
all-Portuguese final against Porto in soccer’s Europa League.  Braga reached its first European final by virtue of scoring
more away goals in the two-match semifinal, following a 2-1 loss
in the opening game at Benfica. Porto, the 2003 champion, lost
3-2 at Villarreal, but advanced by a 7-4 total.  The final of  Europe ’s second-tier club competition will be
played May 18 in Dublin.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
