Deutsche Lufthansa AG (LHA) , Europe’s
second-largest airline, said it hedged 75 percent of its jet
fuel needs for this year.  The carrier is 35 percent hedged for 2012, according to a
 presentation  by Chief Financial Officer Stephan Gemkow posted on
the company website. Lufthansa benefits from hedging as long as
Brent crude trades at more than $92 a barrel, the slides show.  Hedging allows airlines to agree on prices for future fuel
needs and is intended to help guard against cost fluctuations.  Jet fuel in northwest Europe averaged $999 a ton this year,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The prices are for
barge lots of 1,000 or 2,000 tons. Brent crude oil for next-
month settlement on the ICE Futures  Europe  exchange in  London 
has averaged $110 a barrel this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
