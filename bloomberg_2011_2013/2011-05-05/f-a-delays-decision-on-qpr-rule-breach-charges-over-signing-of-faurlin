The Football Association said it
delayed a decision on seven rule-breach charges against Queens
Park Rangers over the signing of Alejandro Faurlin.  English soccer’s governing body opened a hearing on the
matter two days ago, and had indicated it expected a decision to
be made by 4 p.m.  London  time tomorrow.  “This will now not happen,” the F.A. said in a  statement 
on its website, without giving a reason for the delay. “A
decision will be made and announced as soon as possible
thereafter.”  QPR earned promotion to the Premier League last weekend by
winning the title in the second-tier Championship. The west
London club faces possible penalties, including a potential
points deduction that may see Norwich crowned champion and QPR
dropped into the promotion playoffs.  The regular season in the Championship ends in two days, as
QPR hosts Leeds, with the playoffs scheduled to start May 12 and
13.  QPR is accused of having an agreement with a third party
over Faurlin’s economic rights and failing to notify the F.A.
about the pact before the Argentine midfielder was registered in
July 2009. The team and executive Gianni Paladini were charged
with giving false information to the F.A.. Both the club and
Paladini deny the charges.  The club said on its website it acknowledged the F.A.’s
announcement and had no further comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
