Kenya ’s shilling slumped, headed for
the weakest level in a week as oil importers demand dollars amid
a countrywide shortage of fuel.  The currency of East Africa’s biggest economy weakened 0.2
percent to 83.60 per dollar at 2:08 p.m. in Nairobi, poised for
the lowest level since April 27. Yesterday, the shilling closed
at 83.45.  “The growing demand for the dollar by oil importers has
pushed the shilling, which is expected to further weaken and
trade within the 83.50 to 84.00 range in the coming days,” said
Chris Muiga, a senior dealer at Nairobi based  Kenya Commercial
Bank Ltd. (KNCB)   The country has been experiencing an acute shortage of fuel
at retail outlets for the last five days due to supply
disruption, Energy Minister Kiraitu Murungi said today.  “A refinery shut-down on April 27 due to a  power outage 
caused by a technical problem at the Kiambere power station
delayed delivery of 8 million liters of super petrol,” he said
in a statement handed to reporters.  The shortage will end tomorrow as technical problems and
disruptions ease, Murungi said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
