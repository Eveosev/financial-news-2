Japan  may need as many as eight
additional liquefied natural gas cargoes a month to compensate
for nuclear-plant shutdowns after the country’s biggest recorded
earthquake, FACTS Global Energy said.  The nation may import 4 million to 6 million metric tons a
year of extra LNG to boost supplies to gas-fired generators, the
Singapore-based energy consultant said in a May 3 report. Japan,
the world’s biggest consumer of the fuel, increased purchases of
the fuel by 8.4 percent to a record 70 million tons last year,
according to the Ministry of Finance.  The country, which depends on imported fuel for most of its
needs, is seeking alternatives to nuclear power after the March
11 quake forced the shutdown of 11 reactors.  “For the procurement of further LNG, Japan has been
directly approaching producers instead of going through traders
and brokers in the  spot market  in order to avoid a huge price
spike in the spot market,” FACTS said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
