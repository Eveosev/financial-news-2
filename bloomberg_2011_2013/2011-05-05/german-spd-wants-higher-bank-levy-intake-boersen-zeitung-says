Germany ’s opposition Social  Democratic
Party  wants the upper house of parliament to amend draft
legislation that would make banks pay more into a planned fund
to support the financial services industry in the event of
future crises,  Boersen-Zeitung  reported.  Carsten Kuehl, finance minister in the SPD-governed state
of Rhineland-Palatinate, wants to increase contributions tied to
a lender’s derivatives business, raise the minimum amounts banks
have to pay, and make large institutions pay more into the fund
than envisaged by  Chancellor Angela Merkel ’s ruling coalition,
the newspaper reported.  The upper house of parliament’s finance committee will
discuss the decree in Hamburg on May 12, the newspaper said.
Merkel’s bloc no longer controls the upper house after a series
of regional election defeats, according to the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
