Vietnam ’s bonds dropped, pushing
yields to the highest level since November 2008, after the
central bank increased its repurchase rate for the fifth time
this year. The dong strengthened.  The repurchase rate for the seven-day term was lifted to 14
percent from 13 percent yesterday, the  State Bank  of Vietnam
said in an e-mailed statement. That rate has increased from 7
percent in early November. Consumer prices climbed 17.51 percent
in April from a year earlier, the most since December 2008.  “The yield on  government bonds  will go up with  interest
rates ,” said Dam Trung Kien, a Hanoi-based trader at Bao Viet
Fund Management Co., a unit of Vietnam’s biggest insurer.
“There have been more short-term risks and uncertainty because
it is unknown when inflation will peak.”  The yield on the benchmark five-year bonds rose nine basis
points, or 0.09 percentage point, to 12.67 percent, according to
a daily fixing from banks compiled by Bloomberg.  The dong strengthened 0.2 percent to 20,610 per dollar as
of 4:06 p.m. in Hanoi, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The central bank fixed the reference rate at 20,708 today,
compared with 20,703 yesterday, according to its website. The
currency is allowed to trade up to 1 percent on either side of
that rate.  --Diep Ngoc Pham in Hanoi. Editors: Andrew Janes, Sandy Hendry  To contact the Bloomberg News staff on this story:
