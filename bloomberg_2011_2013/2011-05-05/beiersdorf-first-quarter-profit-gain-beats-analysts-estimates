(Corrects margin outlook in last paragraph.)  Beiersdorf AG (BEI) , the German maker of
Tesa adhesives and Nivea skin creams, reported first-quarter
profit that beat analysts’ estimates.  Net income excluding minority interests rose to 123 million
euros ($183 million), or 54 cents a share, from 120 million
euros, or 53 cents, a year earlier, the Hamburg-based company
said today in a  statement . The average estimate of 14 analysts
compiled by Bloomberg was for profit of 88.6 million euros.  Beiersdorf reiterated that it expects unchanged revenue in
its consumer division for 2011. The unit’s operating margin will
be weaker than the prior year at 10 percent to 11 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
