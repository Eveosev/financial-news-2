(Corrects to remove budget deficit first paragraph.)  Hungary posted a budget surplus of
75.9 billion forint ($419 million) in April, narrowing the four-
month shortfall to 666.2 billion forint, or 96.9 percent of the
annual target, the  Economy Ministry  said.  The government can meet its full-year budget deficit target
of 2.94 percent of gross domestic product this year, the
ministry said in an e-mailed statement today.  The government forecasts a budget deficit of 468.5 billion
forint in the second quarter, followed by a surplus of 220.6
billion forint in the third quarter and a surplus of 302.6
billion forint in the last three months of the year.  The forecasts donâ€™t include the consolidation of debts at
the state railway company MAV and the Budapest transport company
BKV nor spending on buying out public-private partnership
projects, the ministry said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
