The U.K.’s decision to extend the life
of its Nimrod spy plane to support military operations in  Libya 
will cost an extra 4 million pounds ($6.6 million) for three
months’ work, Defense Procurement Minister Peter Luff said.  The BAE Systems Plc-made reconnaissance aircraft, which was
due to be grounded April 1, will remain in use until the end of
June. Delaying the retirement of two C-130K Hercules transport
planes and the frigate HMS Cumberland, which evacuated Britons
from Libya, has cost 15,000 pounds and 575,000 pounds
respectively, Luff said.  The figures were revealed in written answers to a question
by the opposition  Labour Party  defense spokesman, Jim Murphy.  “The government are spending millions keeping equipment in
service in Libya which they had planned to scrap in their rushed
defense review,” Murphy said in an e-mail today. “It’s time
for ministers to reopen the review and assess whether the
current equipment program is sufficient for the new threats the
U.K. faces.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
