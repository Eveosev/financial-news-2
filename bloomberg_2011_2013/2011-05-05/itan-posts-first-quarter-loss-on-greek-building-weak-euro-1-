Titan Cement Co SA (TITK) , Greece’s biggest
producer of the building material, posted a first-quarter net
loss as construction activity declined and the euro slumped.  Titan reported a 4.3 million-euro ($6.3 million) net loss
compared with a year-earlier profit of 24.8 million euros, the
Athens-based company said in a faxed statement today. Sales fell
12 percent to 252.9 million euros. Depreciation of the euro in
the first quarter resulted in a 14 million-euro exchange-rate
loss, according to the statement.  “2011 will be another challenging year,” the company said
in the statement. “In Greece, measures taken to improve public
finances and the cutbacks to public investment programs are
expected to lead to a further substantial decline in
construction activity.”  Construction permits issued in  Greece  in January dropped 63
percent to 1,520, according to data released by the Hellenic
Statistical Authority today. The government is implementing
austerity measures it agreed to last year in exchange for
bailout funds from the European Union and  International Monetary
Fund .  The building recovery in the U.S. is expected to be slow
and “no significant” improvement in operating results is seen,
Titan said.  Egypt  performed well in the first three months of
the year, allowing “cautious” optimism, and Turkey’s strong
economy indicates positive prospects, according to the
statement.  Titan expects a “negative impact” from higher energy
costs, according to the statement.  To contact the reporters on this story:
