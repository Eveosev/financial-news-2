Canadian stocks rose, trimming a
second straight weekly decline, after the nation added three
times more jobs than economists estimated and U.S. employment
also topped projections.  Suncor Energy Inc. (SU) , Canada’s largest oil and gas producer,
gained 1.7 percent after the U.S. added the most jobs in five
years.  Manulife Financial Corp. (MFC) ,  North America ’s fourth-largest
insurer, advanced 5.1 percent after at least three analysts
raised their ratings on the shares.  Teck Resources Ltd. (TCK/B) ,
Canada’s largest base-metals and coal producer, increased 2.1
percent.  The Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index gained 111.22
points, or 0.8 percent, to 13,566.60.  “The key driver is the economic data we’re getting both
out of the U.S. and Canada,” said Jennifer Dowty, the Toronto-
based co-manager of the C$873.1 million ($909.3 million)
Manulife Growth Opportunities Fund. “The payrolls out of the
U.S. was a lot stronger than expected, and in  Canada  it was a
similar story.”  The S&P/TSX lost 2.7 percent this week to decline for
consecutive weeks for the first time since July. The benchmark
 stock index  retreated as crude oil tumbled 15 percent and silver
plunged 27 percent, the most for a week since at least 1975.
Energy and raw-materials companies make up 48 percent of
Canadian stocks by market value, according to Bloomberg data.  Employment Rises  Canadian employment increased by 58,300 in April,
 Statistics Canada  said today. Forecasts among 25 economists in a
Bloomberg survey had ranged from 5,000 to 40,000. The U.S. added
244,000 jobs last month, surpassing the median economist
forecast of 185,000 in a Bloomberg survey.  The S&P/TSX Energy Index advanced from a three-month low as
natural gas gained in electronic trading.  Suncor increased 1.7 percent to C$40.26 after falling 10
percent, the most since July 2009, in the previous three days.
 Canadian Natural Resources Ltd. (CNQ) , the country’s second-largest
energy company by market value, climbed 2.5 percent to C$42.30.
Oilfield-services provider  Pason Systems Inc. (PSI)  gained for the
first time in eight days, surging 5.4 percent to C$15.33.  Penn West Petroleum Ltd., a western Canadian oil and gas
producer, jumped 5.9 percent to C$24.17 after Fergal Kelly, an
analyst at Royal Bank of Canada, boosted his rating on the
company to “outperform” from “sector perform.” Yesterday,
the Calgary-based company reported a first-quarter profit more
than four times as large as the average analyst estimate.  Gold,  China   Gold narrowed its biggest weekly slide since May 2010.
 Kinross Gold Corp. (K) , Canada’s third-largest producer of the
metal, increased 1.5 percent to C$14.54. China Gold
International Resources Corp., which explores in China, climbed
6.5 percent to C$4.58.  First Majestic Silver Corp. (FR) , which mines
in  Mexico , rallied 7.4 percent to C$17.60.  Minefinders Corp. (MFL) , which explores for gold in Mexico,
slumped 5.3 percent to C$12.78 to extend its weekly plunge to 20
percent, the biggest since 2008. Brian Christie, an analyst at
Desjardins Securities Inc., and Steven J. Green, an analyst at
Toronto-Dominion Bank, cut their ratings on the shares.  Romarco Minerals Inc. (R) , which is developing a gold mine in
 South Carolina , rallied 13 percent, the most in eight months, to
C$1.88. Shares of the Toronto-based company had fallen 28
percent this year, nearly twice as much as an index of gold
explorers.  Industrial-metals and coal companies rose as zinc and
copper gained in  London . Teck advanced 2.1 percent to CS48.80.
 First Quantum Minerals Ltd. (FM) , Canada’s second-largest publicly
traded copper producer, increased 2.1 percent to C$123.72.  Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan Inc., the world’s largest
fertilizer producer by market value, rose 2.1 percent from a
2011 low to C$51.80. Earnings at  CF Industries Holdings Inc. (CF) ,
the second-biggest maker of nitrogen fertilizer, surpassed the
average of 12 analyst estimates by 27 percent, excluding certain
items.  Manulife Premiums  Manulife surged 5.1 percent to C$17.47 a day after
reporting first-quarter profit that fell less than analysts
expected as higher premiums in the U.S. and Canada countered
claims from the earthquake in  Japan . Analysts at Royal Bank of
Canada, Bank of Nova Scotia and  National Bank of Canada  raised
their ratings on the insurer.  “The  risk premium  that the market currently applies to
Manulife’s stock has not adjusted to the company’s reduced risk
position and improved fundamentals,” Peter Routledge, a
National Bank analyst, wrote in a note to clients.  Magna International Inc. (MG) , Canada’s largest auto-parts
maker, advanced 3.8 percent to C$50.51. The company said it
earned $1.34 a share in the first quarter, excluding certain
items, beating the average of 15 analyst estimates by 18 percent
as vehicle production rebounded.  BlackBerry maker  Research In Motion Ltd. (RIM)  retreated 2.6
percent to a four-year low of C$44.56. Market-research firm
ComScore Inc. said smartphones using Google Inc.’s Android
operating system surpassed BlackBerry in U.S. market share in
the first quarter.  RIM now trades at a record-low 7.2 times its past four
quarters of earnings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
