Polish day-ahead electricity rose in
the past week amid higher exports and increased demand.
Forecasts for warmer weather may damp prices.  Next-day baseload power climbed 3.1 percent to 207.06 zloty
($76.89) a megawatt-hour in the week ending today, according to
Bloomberg calculations based on Polish Power Exchange data.  Average daily electricity demand was as high as 17,706
megawatts this week, up 0.5 percent from last week’s maximum
daily average, according to  system load data .  A power cable linking Poland and  Sweden  was used
predominantly for exports of Polish electricity this week,
reversing the pattern from the previous seven days, according to
data from PSE Operator.  Maximum temperatures in Warsaw may rise to 25 degrees
Celsius (77 Fahrenheit) on May 12 from today’s high of 9
degrees, according to CustomWeather Inc. data on Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
