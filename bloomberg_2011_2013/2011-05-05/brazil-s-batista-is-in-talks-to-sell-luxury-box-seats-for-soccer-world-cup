IMX, a partnership of IMG Worldwide
Inc. and billionaire  Eike Batista ’s EBX Group Co. Ltd., is in
talks with FIFA to sell tickets for the 2014  World Cup  and 2013
FIFA Confederations Cup soccer tournaments in  Brazil .  IMX, based in Rio de Janeiro, is negotiating the rights to
sell luxury box tickets in Brazil with  Match Hospitality AG ,
according to two separate e-mails from FIFA and EBX. Match
Hospitality, based in Zurich, has an exclusive contract to sell
tickets for FIFA-organized events.  “Match Hospitality is in discussions with IMX,” FIFA said
in the e-mail yesterday, “to be possibly named by us as a
vendor of box packages in the Brazilian domestic market. At this
time, no contract has been signed with IMX or any other company
in the EBX group.”  Brazil’s 2014 World Cup and the 2016 Olympics in Rio de
Janeiro will require investments of 140 billion reais ($87
billion) in stadiums, highways and other infrastructure
projects, Sports Minister Orlando Silva said on April 22.
Batista in November announced the creation of his sports
marketing company IMX, a partnership with IMG Worldwide. Former
player Ronaldo Nazario de Lima last year created 9ine in
conjunction with  WPP Plc (WPP) , the world’s biggest publicity agency.  The vendor chosen by Match Hospitality will be responsible
for selling hospitality and luxury box packages, and not general
seat tickets, FIFA said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
