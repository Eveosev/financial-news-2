U.S. stock-index futures fell,
indicating the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index may slide for a
fourth straight day, as oil and metals tumbled.  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) , the world’s biggest oil company by
market value, slid 0.8 percent as crude declined for a fourth
day in  New York .  Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. (FCX)  slipped 1.4
percent.  Whole Foods Market Inc. (WFMI)  rallied 4.3 percent in  Germany 
as profit rose 33 percent in the second quarter.  June contracts on the S&P 500 dropped 0.3 percent to
1,338.5 at 7:16 a.m. in New York. Dow Jones Industrial Average
futures slid 0.3 percent to 12,640 and Nasdaq-100 Index futures
retreated 0.3 percent to 2,377.  U.S. stocks fell yesterday, with commodity producers
driving a third straight loss for the S&P 500, as lower-than-
estimated reports on  service industries  and job growth damped
optimism in the economy. A report from the Labor Department at
8:30 a.m. in  Washington  today may show new applications for
 unemployment benefits  fell last week.  “Investors are still cautious with the  unemployment rate 
and will look at the jobless-claim figures today,” said Andreas Lipkow, an equity trader at MWB Fairtrade Wertpapierhandelsbank
AG in Frankfurt.  The  S&P 500  has still rallied 7.1 percent this year amid
higher-than-estimated profits and economic reports. Earnings-
per-share beat estimates at 73 percent of the 375 companies in
the index that reported results since April 11, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Fed Stimulus  Two Federal Reserve regional bank presidents indicated that
the central bank won’t remove record stimulus soon, saying the
Fed is missing its goal for full employment and inflation isn’t
a long-term risk.  Eric Rosengren , president of the Federal Reserve Bank of
 Boston , and  San Francisco ’s John C. Williams followed the lead
taken by Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke , who signaled last week
that policy makers will keep stimulus in place after ending
large-scale bond purchases in June.  Exxon Mobil dropped 0.8 percent to $84.10 in early New York
trading. Oil declined for a fourth day in New York, the longest
losing streak in eight weeks, as decreasing gasoline demand
added to signs of slowing growth in the U.S., the world’s
biggest crude consumer.  Albemarle Corp. (ALB) , the world’s largest maker of oil-refinery
catalysts, slipped 0.6 percent to $65.69 in German trading as
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. downgraded the stock to “neutral”
from “buy.”  Freeport, Alcoa  Freeport-McMoRan, the largest publicly traded copper
producer, slipped 1.4 percent to $51.14 in early New York
trading.  Alcoa Inc. (AA) , the biggest U.S. aluminum producer, slid
0.5 percent to $17.39 in Germany.  Copper fell to the lowest price in more than seven weeks in
 London  on concern demand may weaken as central banks around the
world raise  interest rates  to curb inflation. Aluminum, lead,
nickel, tin and zinc also retreated.  Whole Foods gained 4.3 percent to $62.30 in Germany as the
largest U.S. natural-goods grocer boosted its full-year earnings
projection after profit rose. Whole Foods will earn as much as
$1.90 a share in 2011, the Austin, Texas-based company said.
Previously, the grocer forecast profit of as much as $1.80.  Con-Way Inc. (CNW)  jumped 3.2 percent to $38.79 in German
trading. The trucking company said first-quarter net income was
$6.9 million, or 12 cents a share, compared with a loss of $4
million, or 8 cents, a year earlier. Analysts estimated profit
of 4 cents a share, according to the average of 22 predictions
compiled by Bloomberg.     Tesla Motors Inc. (TSLA)  soared 3.6 percent to $27.66 in Germany.
The U.S. electric-car maker said it had a first-quarter loss
that was narrower than analysts estimated as it boosted revenue
from battery packs and development work with partners Daimler AG
and Toyota Motor Corp.  To contact the reporter on this story:
