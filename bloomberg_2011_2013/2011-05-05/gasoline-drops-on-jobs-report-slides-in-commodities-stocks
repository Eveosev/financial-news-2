Gasoline plunged the most since
February 2009 as a rise in first-time jobless claims boosted
concern that fuel demand will shrink, and as a stronger dollar
sparked the biggest selloff in commodities in two years.  Gasoline fell as much as 7.1 percent as jobless benefits
applications jumped 43,000 to 474,000 last week, the most since
August, Labor Department figures showed. The Thomson
Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index sank 4.8 percent as the U.S.
currency rose 1.8 percent against the euro at 2:13 p.m. in  New
York , making dollar-denominated commodities more attractive to
investors.  “Demand concern is sparking the liquidation,” said Joe Posillico, senior vice president of energy derivatives at MF
Global Inc. in New York. “There’s concern about worldwide
demand tightening due to higher prices and the jobless claims
numbers were disappointing.”  Gasoline for June delivery dropped 21.78 cents, or 6.6
percent, to $3.10471 a gallon at 2:13 p.m. on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange . Prices touched $3.0873, the lowest level
since March 31.  Commodities fell as the euro sank after European Central
Bank President  Jean-Claude Trichet  signaled that the ECB would
wait until next month to raise  interest rates  again to control
rising inflation.  “There was a strong rally in the dollar following
Trichet’s comments, largely viewed as more dovish about future
rates than the market was hoping for,” said  Tom Knight , vice
president of trading and supply at Truman Arnold Cos. in
Texarkana,  Texas .  Rally in 2011  Futures gained 35 percent this year through yesterday as
the dollar slipped 11 percent and U.S. gasoline supplies plunged
to a 22-month low. The rally pushed pump prices up toward $4 a
gallon, causing fuel demand to drop.  Gasoline demand fell 2.2 percent in the week ended April 29
to 8.94 million barrels a day, according to Energy Department
data. On a four-week average, gasoline consumption was 1.9
percent below a year earlier.  “Yesterday’s DOE report was one of the most negative I’ve
ever seen with the drop in overall product demand.” said Peyton Feltus, president of Randolph Risk Management in Dallas.
“Refinery capacity utilization is very low but turnaround
season is already coming to an end.”  Silver led the commodities retreat with a 9.1 percent
decline, falling a fourth day after CME Group Ltd. raised margin
requirements by 84 percent in less than two weeks in an attempt
to curb speculation. Gold slipped for a third day.  June-delivery crude lost $9.20 to $100.04 a barrel on the
Nymex.  Brent crude  for June settlement declined $10.11 to
$111.08 on  London ’s ICE Futures Europe exchange.  Consumer Confidence  U.S. consumer confidence dropped to a five-week low amid
rising prices at the pump. The Bloomberg Consumer Comfort Index
decreased to minus 46.2 in the week ended May 1, the lowest
level since the end of March.  The Labor Department is expected to report tomorrow that
job growth fell in April. Payrolls rose by 190,000 workers after
a 216,000 gain in March, according to the median forecast of 56
economists surveyed by Bloomberg News. The  Institute for Supply
Management  tomorrow may report that the purchasers’ factory
index fell to 59.5 last month from 61.2 in March, according to
the survey median.  “You’re getting a drumbeat of disappointing economic news;
the confidence of the longs in the market has been shaken and
you’re seeing them exit,” said  Gene McGillian , an analyst and
broker at Tradition Energy in  Stamford ,  Connecticut .  Regular retail gasoline rose 0.3 cent to $3.985 a gallon
yesterday, AAA said on its website, the highest since July 24,
2008. The record was $4.114 on July 15, 2008.  Heating oil for June delivery dropped 25.05 cents, or 8
percent, to $2.8925 a gallon on the exchange. Prices touched as
$2.8814, the lowest level since Feb. 25.  To contact the reporter on this story:
