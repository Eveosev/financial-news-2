Finbank Plc (FIRSTINL) , a Nigerian lender bailed
out by the central bank in 2009, rose to a five-week high after
Governor Lamido Sanusi said it signed an agreement with
potential investors.  The stock gained 1 kobo, or 1.4 percent, to 73 kobo by the
2:30 p.m. close in Lagos, its highest value since March 30.  “Finbank has signed, I believe they will be announcing
this week,” Sanusi said in an interview at the  World Economic
Forum  on Africa in Cape Town,  South Africa , yesterday.  The central bank fired eight chief executives officers at
Nigeria’s 24 lenders after a debt crisis in 2008 and 2009
threatened to collapse the country’s industry. The regulator
bailed out some institutions with 620 billion naira ($4
billion), with Finbank as one of the beneficiaries.  To contact the reporter on this story:
