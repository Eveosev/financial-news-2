Rolls-Royce Group Plc (RR/) , the world’s
second-largest engine-maker, may relax a rule tomorrow on the
company’s governance to allow the appointment of non-British
executives to top posts.  The U.K. government has agreed that terms of its so-called
golden share in London-based Rolls-Royce can be revised to allow
recruitment of a U.S. or European Union citizen as chairman or
chief executive officer, the Department for Business, Innovation
and Skills said in an e-mail. Investors are scheduled to vote on
the matter tomorrow at the manufacturer’s annual meeting.  U.K. authorities retained some veto rights at defense
manufacturers such as Rolls-Royce that the state sold during the
Conservative government of the 1980s and 1990s. At least one of
the top two positions at Rolls-Royce must be held by a Briton,
and a requirement will stay in force that at least half of the
board members be British, the London-based department said.  “The government has agreed that the terms of the special
share can be changed, but this is subject to Rolls-Royce
shareholders agreeing to them,” the department said.  The manufacturer will set up a security committee of U.K.
nationals to decide on sensitive technology and security matters
should a foreigner be appointed CEO, the department said.  “Rolls-Royce is now a global business and this is about
accessing a global pool of talent as the business continues to
grow and develop,” the company said today in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
