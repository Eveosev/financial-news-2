Mike Pelfrey pitched into the eighth
inning and  Carlos Beltran  hit a two-run home run as the  New York
Mets  beat the  San Francisco Giants  5-2.  Pelfrey (2-3) allowed one earned run on four hits at Citi
Field in New York today while striking out five and walking two
over 7 2/3 innings. Jonathan Sanchez (2-2) took the loss for the
Giants, allowing five earned runs in five innings, with six
strikeouts and six walks.  The Mets got three runs in the second inning. Ronny Paulino
hit into a double play that knocked in Jason Bay and Sanchez
then walked Scott Hairston and Pelfrey, New York’s eighth and
ninth batters, who scored when Jose Reyes tripled to center
field.  The first Giants’ hit came in the fourth inning, an upper-
deck home run to right field by shortstop Mike Fontenot.  Beltran added his fifth home run of the season in the fifth
inning.  New York closer  Francisco Rodriguez  loaded the bases with
one out in the ninth inning before striking out Miguel Tejada
and getting Buster Posey to ground out for his seventh save.  The Mets are 13-18 this season, the Giants 15-16.  To contact the reporter on this story:
