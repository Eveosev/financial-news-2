A legal case has been filed against
Faezeh Hashemi, the daughter of former president Ali Akbar
Hashemi Rafsanjani, the state-run Iranian Students News Agency
reported, citing Tehran Prosecutor-General Abbas Jafari-
Dolatabadi.  Dolatabadi declined to elaborate on the case, saying only
that it’s been filed because of some media interviews Faezeh has
given, according to  ISNA .  Faezeh, has criticized Iranian president  Mahmoud
Ahmadinejad  and been arrested twice for joining anti-government
rallies. In an interview with the magazine Foreign Policy last
year, she accused the government of making up statistics and
criticized Ahmadinejad’s handling of the country’s affairs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
