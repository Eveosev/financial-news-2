Evraz Group SA (EVR) , a Russian steelmaker,
may sell the Yubileinaya coal mine, site of an accidental blast
in 2007 that killed 39 people,  Vedomosti  said.  A regional holding called Topprom has applied to  Russia â€™s
Federal Antimonopoly Service to buy the mine, Vedomosti said
citing an unidentified person in the agency. Evraz confirmed
potential purchase interest from Topprom without providing
further details, Vedomosti said, citing an unidentified Evraz
representative.  To contact the reporter on this story:
