Syria ’s market regulator allowed
companies to buy back as much as 5 percent of their shares to
stem declines after the country’s benchmark index fell 23
percent since the beginning of March.  The Syrian government is seeking to end unrest in some
parts of the country after protest broke in the southern city of
Daraa in mid March, demaning greater freedoms.  Companies must seek permission from the market regulator,
the Syrian Commission on Financial Markets and Securities, and
the purchase must be made more than two weeks before news that
could impact the share price is released, according to
guidelines published by the regulator on its website.  “The guidelines were issued to allow listed companies to
protect their  shares  against severe declines,” said Hakam
Tarabein, a financial analyst at Pioneers Syria, a brokerage
company.  To contact the reporters on this story:
