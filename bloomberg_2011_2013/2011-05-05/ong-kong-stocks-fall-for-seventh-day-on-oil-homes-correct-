(Corrects headline)  Hong Kong  stocks dropped for a seventh
day, with the city’s benchmark index set for its longest stretch
of losses since 2008, as  Cnooc Ltd. (883)  and PetroChina Co. fell in
line with  oil prices , and home sales dropped to the lowest level
since March 2009.  Cnooc and PetroChina slumped more than 2 percent after
crude futures fell for a fourth day and Shanghai Securities News
said  China ’s tax on the sale of oil and gas may reach 10 percent.
 Hang Lung Properties Ltd. (101)  and New World Development Co. lost at
least 1.1 percent as government curbs and rising mortgage rates
sapped demand for homes in Hong Kong last month.  “There’s a slowing economy and people are concerned that
China may announce an interest-rate hike and inflation might
surprise on the upside,” said Derek Cheung, the Hong Kong-based
head of research at DBS Vickers Hong Kong Ltd. “The  Hang Seng 
will continue to be constrained.”  The  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  dropped 0.1 percent to 23,287.67 as of
the midday trading break in Hong Kong. About four stocks fell
for every three that climbed on the 45-member gauge. The Hang
Seng China Enterprises Index of Chinese companies’ H-shares was
little changed at 12,861.47, the lowest level since March 24.  The benchmark measure of Hong Kong stocks has fallen 3.5
percent in the past seven trading days, the longest period of
consecutive losses since the collapse of Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc. in September 2008. The slump today pared the year-
to-date advance in the Hang Seng to 1.1 percent.  China’s central bank has raised borrowing costs four times
since October to cool prices that grew in March at the fastest
pace since 2008. It ordered lenders to set aside more reserves
10 times since the start of last year to curb lending. The
government is tightening monetary policy even as the measures
threaten to slow the world’s second-biggest economy.  Oil Slips  Cnooc, China’s largest offshore oil producer, fell 2
percent to HK$18.40. PetroChina,  Asia ’s No. 1 company by market
value, slipped 2.2 percent to HK$10.60.  Oil futures fell for a fourth day in  New York , dropping as
much as 0.7 percent after an Energy Department report yesterday
showed stockpiles rose to the highest level since October.  China’s planned resource tax on the sale of oil and gas may
be between 5 percent and 10 percent, Shanghai Securities News
reported, citing a government document it obtained.  Hang Lung Properties, a developer of apartments and hotels
in Hong Kong, fell 1.3 percent to HK$33.60. New World
Development, a real-estate company controlled by billionaire
 Cheng Yu-tung , slumped 1.2 percent to HK$13.30.  The number of Hong Kong homes that changed hands last month
declined 37.6 percent from a year earlier to 7,635, according to
a statement on the Land Registry website yesterday. The value of
transactions slid 26.8 percent from a year earlier to HK$39
billion ($5 billion), the biggest drop since June 2010,
according to the release.  Futures on the Hang Seng Index rose 0.1 percent to 23,084.
The HSI Volatility Index, the benchmark gauge for Hong Kong
stock options, dropped 1.9 percent to 17.97, indicating options
traders expect a swing of 5.2 percent in the Hang Seng in the
next 30 days.  Esprit Holdings Ltd. (330)  slumped 2.5 percent to HK$31.35 for
the biggest drop in the Hang Seng. Analysts at JPMorgan Chase &
Co. cut their profit estimates for Asia’s third-biggest clothier
by market value on concern the company’s wholesale business is
weakening and higher cotton prices will weigh on earnings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
