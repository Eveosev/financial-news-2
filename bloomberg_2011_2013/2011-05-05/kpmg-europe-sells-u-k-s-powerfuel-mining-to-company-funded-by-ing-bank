KPMG Europe LLP , administrator for
U.K.-based Powerfuel Mining Ltd., said it sold the business that
owns the Hatfield Colliery to Entero BV, a company funded by ING
Bank NV. Financial terms werenâ€™t disclosed.  KPMG transferred the Powerfuel Mining business and its 393
employees, plus 11 from the parent company Powerfuel Plc, into a
newly formed company called Hatfield Colliery Ltd. in April.
KPMG said today in a statement it sold that company to Entero,
supported by Amsterdam-based ING and  Hargreaves Services Plc .  "The transaction saves hundreds of jobs in an area that has
a long tradition of mining employment and puts the business on a
solid footing," Brian Green, joint administrator and KPMG
restructuring partner, said in the e-mailed statement.  Progress continues on the sale of Powerfuel Power Ltd., the
carbon capture and storage project also owned by Powerfuel, KPMG
said. 2Co Energy Ltd., a U.K.-based company that specializes in
CCS technology, is the preferred bidder and is continuing due
diligence, according to the statement.  Doncaster-based Powerfuel went into administration last
December. Hatfield Colliery is in south Yorkshire.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
