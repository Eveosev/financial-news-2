Novo Nordisk A/S, the world’s biggest
maker of insulin, said it probably won’t be able to raise prices
in the U.S. as much as in previous years as health-care
providers demand greater rebates from drugmakers.  “Net price increases will most likely be smaller than in
the past,” Jurek Gruhn, senior vice president for  North
America , said today at the Bagsvaerd, Denmark-based company.
Increases are likely to be 2 percent to 3 percent, he said.  Novo Nordisk last month reported 16 percent first-quarter
growth in North American sales, down from 39 percent in the
previous quarter. Today, the company confirmed it recently lost
three insulin contracts with U.S. health providers to  Eli Lilly
& Co. (LLY) , which offered lowered prices.  Drugmakers are being pressed harder for rebates as U.S.
health-care reform is implemented, Gruhn said. Novo would have
taken losses if it had tried to win the three contracts from
Lilly, he added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
