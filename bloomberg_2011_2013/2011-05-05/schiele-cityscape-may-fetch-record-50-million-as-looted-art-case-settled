A cityscape by  Egon Schiele  valued at
a record $50 million will be auctioned to pay for the settlement
of one of the world’s longest-running art restitution cases.  The Leopold Museum, Vienna, is selling the 1914 work in
London with a top estimate of about 30 million pounds on June 22
after agreeing to end an ownership dispute over another of the
Austrian Expressionist’s paintings, the U.S.-based auction house
 Sotheby’s (BID)  said in an e-mailed statement today.  Schiele’s “Hauser mit bunter Waesche, ‘Vorstadt’ II,”
showing houses with washing lines, has a low estimate of 22
million pounds and is guaranteed a minimum price by a third-
party “irrevocable bid,” Sotheby’s said. The valuation exceeds
the $22.4 million paid in 2006 for a cityscape at Christie’s
International. Sales of museum-quality oils by the short-lived
artist (1890-1918) are becoming increasingly rare.  “This is a great opportunity,” said Eberhard Kohlbacher,
partner in the Vienna dealership  Wienerroither & Kohlbacher .
“You have a few restitution cases, then it will be finished.”  The museum was founded in 1994 by the Viennese 
ophthalmologist and collector Rudolf Leopold, who died in 2010. 
It owns more than 220 works by Schiele, including another eight
cityscapes.  In 1998, Schiele’s 1912 portrait of his lover Walburga
(Wally) Neuzil was seized by a  district attorney  after being
loaned to an exhibition at the Museum of  Modern Art ,  New York .  Descendants of the Jewish art dealer Lea Bondi Jaray
claimed that “Wally,” acquired by Leopold in 1954, was stolen
by the Nazis in the 1930s. The claim was upheld by a federal
court in  Manhattan  in 2009, prompting the Viennese museum to
make an out-of-court settlement of $19 million last year to keep
the painting.  The museum also had to pay as much as 3.5 million euros
($5.2 million) in legal costs, Leopold director Peter Weinhaeupl
said. The complex case resulted in 44 countries drafting
guidelines for the return of looted art known as the Washington
Principles.  (Scott Reyburn writes about the art market for Muse, the
