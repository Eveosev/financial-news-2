German tax revenue at federal, state
and local level will exceed a November government estimate this
year and next, the labor union-affiliated  IMK economic institute 
said today.  Revenue this year will grow more than 4 percent from 2010
to 551.3 billion euros ($817.2 billion), an amount that exceeds
the government forecast by 14 billion euros, the Dusseldorf-
based institute said.  Tax revenue in 2012 will jump 5.2 percent to almost 580
billion euros, around 17 billion euros more than predicted by
the government, it said.  Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s federal government will need to
borrow around 10 billion euros a year less between 2012 and 2014
than it is allowed to under a constitutional debt brake that
calls for a balanced budget by 2015, the IMK said.  Higher-than-expected tax revenue would help Finance
Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  meet his budget goals even if other
proceeds, including those from a nuclear-fuel tax and a
financial-transaction tax, come in below target.  The government’s tax-estimate group, which is attached to
the  Finance Ministry , will meet next week in the town of Fulda
and present its new official forecast on May 12.  To contact the reporter on this story:
