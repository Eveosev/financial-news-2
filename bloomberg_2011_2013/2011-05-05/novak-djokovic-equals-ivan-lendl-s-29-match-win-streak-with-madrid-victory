World No. 2 Novak Djokovic equaled
 Ivan Lendl ’s 29-match win streak with a straight-set victory
over Guillermo Garcia-Lopez in Madrid.  The Serb maintained his unbeaten record this season by
beating the Spaniard 6-1, 6-2 in the third round of the  Madrid
Masters .  Czech Lendl started the 1986 season with a 29-0 run. Bjorn Borg of Sweden won 33 consecutive matches in 1980, while  John McEnroe  of the U.S. holds the record for longest win streak with
42 straight victories in 1984.  The 23-year-old Djokovic has won all five tournaments he’s
entered this year, including the Australian Open and events in
Dubai, Indian Wells, Miami and Belgrade. He’ll play the winner
of the match between world No. 6  David Ferrer  of Spain or No. 38
Sergiy Stakhovsky of the Ukraine in the next round in Madrid.  To contact the reporter on this story:
