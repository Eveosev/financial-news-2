Domino’s Pizza Inc. (DPZ) , whose stock rose
to its highest level today in four years, plans to open up to
300 shops a year after reporting a rise in same-store sales
overseas.  Domino’s will have a larger presence internationally than
in the U.S. in about 18 months, Chief Executive Officer J. Patrick Doyle said in a telephone interview.  “We are verging on being a bigger international brand than
domestic brand,” he said.  Domino’s, which has 4,900 stores in the U.S. and 4,400
international locations, will open as many as 300 stores a year
over the long-term, with most being in overseas markets, Doyle
said. Britain is the  Ann Arbor , Michigan-based pizza chain’s
largest market outside the U.S. in store count and sales, he
said.  Same-store sales in the first quarter rose 8.3 percent at
international locations, the company said today in a statement.
For the three months ended March 27, net income rose 11 percent
to $27.1 million, or 43 cents a share, compared with $24.5
million, or 41 cents, a year earlier. Analysts were expecting 35
cents.  Domino’s jumped $2.10, or 11 percent, to $21.30 at 4:15
p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, the highest
since May 2007. The shares have gained 34 percent this year.  Pizza Hut , which is owned by Yum! Brands Inc., is the
biggest pizza chain based on the total number of stores.  To contact the reporter on this story:
