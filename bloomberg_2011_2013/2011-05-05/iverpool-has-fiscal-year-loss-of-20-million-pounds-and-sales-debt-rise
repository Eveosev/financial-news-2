Liverpool soccer club had a loss of 20
million pounds ($32.9 million) last fiscal year and its debt
rose as the team worked to compete in  England ’s Premier League.  Revenue rose to 184 million pounds, and debt widened to 123
million pounds in the period ended July 2010, the club said
today on its website. Liverpool, which is fifth with three games
left this season, didn’t give year-earlier figures.  Fenway Sports Group took over the team in October 2010,
three months after the fiscal year ended, and the new ownership
paid off 200 million of debt left by the team’s previous
operators, Liverpool said.  “The picture is an improving one,” managing director  Ian
Ayre  said in the statement. “We had an extremely successful
January transfer window, which saw the ownership and management
teams working closely to bring in some high-quality players.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
