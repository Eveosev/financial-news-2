VTG AG (VT9) , which operates 50,000
railcars, said it raised about 930 million euros ($1.4 billion)
from bonds and loans which will support its expansion.  The Hamburg-based company sold 450 million euros and $40
million of seven, 10, 12, and 15-year bonds through a U.S.
private placement which it said will open up access to capital
markets. The bond sale was managed by Deutsche Bank AG and Bank
of America Merrill Lynch, according to a statement from VTG.  VTG, controlled by billionaire investor  Wilbur Ross , also
got 450 million euros of syndicated loans which comprise 100
million euros of term loans and 350 million euros of revolving
credit. Commerzbank AG, Deutsche Bank and UniCredit SpA arranged
the five-year loans.  The financings will replace 640 million euros of loans VTG
obtained in 2005, according to the statement.  The railcar company, which was listed on the Frankfurt
Stock Exchange in 2007, has climbed 14 percent this year to
17.15 euros. TUI AG,  Europe ’s largest tour operator, sold VTG to
Ross’s Compagnie Europeenne de Wagon in 2005 to reduce debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
