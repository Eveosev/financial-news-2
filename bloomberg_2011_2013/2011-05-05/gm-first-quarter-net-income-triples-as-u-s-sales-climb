General Motors Co. (GM) ’s first-quarter
North American profit disappointed investors as higher spending
on sales incentives, marketing and engineering costs reduced the
benefit of soaring revenue.  Excluding some items, profit was 95 cents a share, beating
the 91-cent average estimate of 13 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg. Net income more than tripled to $3.37 billion, or
$1.77 a share, from $1.07 billion, or 55 cents, a year earlier,
Detroit-based GM said yesterday in a statement.  While North American sales in the quarter rose $2.82
billion, higher operating  expenses  cut the company’s profit by
$700 million, GM said. The rising costs denied investors the
results they expected and contributed to the stock’s biggest
decline in more than two months, Adam Jonas, an analyst with
Morgan Stanley, said in a telephone interview yesterday.  “The market thought that they would beat the consensus by
more than 5 percent,” said Jonas, who’s based in  New York .
“Nobody owns GM to meet numbers. They own GM to beat numbers by
a significant amount.”  GM fell $1.02, or 3.1 percent, to $32.02 yesterday in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading, the biggest decline since
Feb. 24. The shares have slid 13 percent this year.  The quarterly profit was GM’s fifth straight and its
largest net income since at least 1990. GM’s total first-quarter
revenue rose 15 percent to $36.2 billion.  Engineering Costs  Engineering and marketing costs each rose $200 million, and
incentive spending cut profit by $300 million, GM said.  Chief Executive Officer Dan Akerson said on a call with
analysts that the first-quarter results were “on plan” and the
company must focus on reducing costs.  “We have a lot of work to do to leverage our scale and get
the most out of our brands,” Akerson said. “A key part of
improving our leverage is controlling costs.”  GM’s U.S. sales climbed 25 percent to 592,545 light
vehicles in the first quarter, outpacing the industry’s 20
percent gain, according to Autodata Corp., a researcher based in
 Woodcliff Lake ,  New Jersey . The company spent an average of
$3,566 per vehicle on sales incentives in the period, the most
among the eight largest automakers by U.S. sales, Autodata said.  GM said it earned $2.9 billion before interest and taxes in
 North America  in the period.  International Operations  Earnings on that basis in GM’s international operations,
which include  China , fell to $480 million in the first quarter
from $908 million a year earlier. Sales for the unit rose 8.2
percent to about 855,000 vehicles in the quarter, GM said.  The pretax loss in GM’s European operations narrowed to
$390 million from $477 million. GM has said it plans to break
even in  Europe  by the end of 2011.  Chief Financial Officer Dan Ammann said GM’s European
operations are showing progress and that the region would have
broken even if not for a $395 million charge to goodwill.  GM also took a charge of $106 million in its international
operations related to its joint venture in  India .  The automaker reported a gain of $1.6 billion from the sale
of its stake in former parts unit Delphi Automotive LLP. GM
posted a gain of $339 million from the sale of preferred stock
in Ally Financial Inc., formerly the automaker’s GMAC Inc. unit.
In total, special items boosted GM’s net income by $1.47 billion
in the first quarter.  The U.S. Treasury Department, which owns 33 percent of GM,
plans to evaluate the earnings before deciding whether to sell
more of its investment, a person familiar with the matter said
last month. The department wants to sell its stake for at least
the IPO price and would prefer to sell in the high-$30 range, a
person familiar with the matter has said.  GM Bailout  The U.S. took a 61 percent ownership of GM as part of the
automaker’s $50 billion government-led bailout and bankruptcy
reorganization in 2009. The Treasury sold shares equal to a 28
percent stake during the November IPO of the company. The
department can sell more shares starting May 22.  GM may retake the crown for most global auto sales from
 Toyota Motor Corp. (7203)  this year, said  Jeff Schuster , executive
director of forecasting for J.D. Power & Associates, a research
firm in  Westlake Village ,  California . Toyota has lost production
because of plant shutdowns following the March 11 earthquake in
 Japan . GM also is better positioned to expand sales in China, he
said.  GM increased first-quarter North American truck production
18 percent from a year earlier to about 502,000 units, while car
output rose 16 percent to about 284,000 vehicles.  Truck Production  The automaker may reduce output of pickups after
inventories rose last month,  Mark Reuss , president for North
America, said earlier this week. GM’s truck inventory rose to
more than 275,000 at the end of April, or about 111 days of
supply. GM had about 264,000 trucks on dealer lots a month
earlier.  The automaker finished the quarter with $5 billion in debt
and $29.6 billion in unrestricted cash. The automaker has said
it wants to carry minimal debt and shore up the pension fund,
which was underfunded by $11 billion at the end of the fourth
quarter and received a $2 billion stock contribution on Jan. 13.  “We are basically there on the debt,” Ammann said. “We
have more work to do on the  pension plan .”  Earnings before interest and taxes are expected to rise
“on average” for the rest of the year, Ammann said.  Ford Motor Co. (F) ’s net income in the first quarter rose 22
percent to $2.55 billion, and its earnings excluding items
topped analysts’ estimates. Chrysler Group LLC reported a profit
of $116 million, its first quarterly net income since emerging
from bankruptcy in 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
