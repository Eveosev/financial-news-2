China ’s stocks rose following the
biggest loss in two months on speculation earnings of drugmakers
and consumer staples producers will be sheltered from slowing
economic growth.  Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Ltd. and  China
Construction Bank Corp. (939)  gained more than 1 percent after Credit
Suisse Group AG said lenders may report profit growth of 20
percent this year. Jointown Pharmaceutical Group Co. rose the
most in three months on prospects the government will boost
development of the drug-distribution industry. Jiangxi Copper
Co., the biggest copper producer, fell to a seven-month low.  The Shanghai Composite Index, which tracks the bigger of
China’s stock exchanges, added 6.4 points, or 0.2 percent, to
2,872.40 at the 3 p.m. close. The gauge slumped 2.3 percent
yesterday. The  CSI 300 Index (SHSZ300)  retreated 0.1 percent to 3,126.12.
The MSCI Emerging Markets Index slid 0.2 percent.  Yesterday’s “plunge is a bit overdone and may create an
opportunity for a rebound in some defensive sectors,” said Tu Jun, a strategist at Shanghai Securities Co. “Some investors
are betting on a rebound after excessive losses.”  The nation’s economic growth can exceed 9 percent this year
although it faces uncertainties including the risk of over-
tightening, Yu Yongding, a former academic adviser to the
People’s Bank of China said today.  Inflationary pressure “remains high but is controllable
this year,” and there is no need to be “overly worried” about
price increases, Yu said. While it will be difficult for the
government to keep inflation within its 4 percent target this
year, limiting the growth in consumer prices to under 5 percent
is “achievable,” he said.  Bank Stocks  Credit Suisse said banks will boost profit in 2011 after
they signaled “continued strength” in fee income and net
interest margins in the first quarter. The brokerage remains
“constructive” on large banks with ICBC, China Construction
Bank and  Agricultural Bank of China Ltd. (601288)  making up its top
picks, analysts led by  Sanjay Jain  wrote in a report today.  ICBC, the nation’s bigger lender, jumped 1.6 percent to
4.60 yuan, its biggest gain since April 6. China Construction
Bank, the second largest, advanced 1.4 percent to 5.19 yuan.  Bank shares in China and so-called consumption stocks are
among those that may rebound in the third quarter, Anthony Cragg, a portfolio manager at Wells Capital Management, said in
a Bloomberg Television interview, without naming any companies.  “Those countries who got onto the inflation problem
earlier and more proactively and aggressively will come out of
it earlier and I would put China in that category,” said Cragg.  China’s central bank has lifted borrowing costs four times
since October to cool prices that grew at the fastest pace since
2008 in March. It ordered lenders to set aside reserves 10 times
since the start of last year to curb lending.  Defensive Stocks  A gauge tracking health-care companies in the CSI 300
gained 1.4 percent, the second-most among 10 industry groups.
The measure tracking consumer staples rose 1.3 percent.  Joinown Pharmaceutical surged 6.3 percent to 14.17 yuan,
the most since Feb. 10. The Ministry of Commerce will announce a
five-year plan for the drug distribution industry today, the
China Business News reported yesterday. The plan includes a
system to set up as much as three national medicine distributors
each with annual sales of more than 100 billion yuan ($15.4
billion), it said.  Kweichow Moutai Co., the biggest producer of baijiu liquor,
advanced 0.8 percent to 184.95 yuan.  Chongqing Brewery Co. (600132) , the
second-biggest brewer, added 1.4 percent to 60.09 yuan.  Jiangxi Copper led declines for copper producers, losing
2.4 percent to 33.79 yuan, the lowest since Sept. 30.  Yunnan
Copper Industry Co. (000878)  slipped 0.7 percent to 22.99 yuan.  Copper in  London  slumped to the lowest price in more than
seven weeks on concern that extended tightening measures in
China may curb demand in the world’s largest user. Three-month
delivery copper on the London Metal Exchange fell as much as 1
percent to $9,037 a metric ton, the lowest level since March 15.  --Irene Shen. Editors: Allen Wan, Darren Boey  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
