President  Dennis Lockhart  said U.S. growth is likely to improve
over the course of 2011 from its 1.8 percent pace in the first
three months of the year.  “My outlook for the rest of the year is that the second
through fourth quarters will show a better picture than the
numbers showed in the first quarter,” Lockhart said in response
to questions from reporters after a speech in Atlanta. “I see
very little chance for a double-dip recession.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
