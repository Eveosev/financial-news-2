Makhteshim-Agan Industries Ltd. (MAIN) , the
world’s largest maker of generic agrochemicals, rose the most in
more than a month after a Chinese ministry approved  China 
National Chemical Corp.’s plan to buy a stake in the company.  The shares advanced 2.2 percent, the biggest gain since
March 30, to 18.37 shekels at 11 a.m. in Tel Aviv.  Koor
Industries Ltd. (KOR) , which holds a 46.6 percent stake in Makhteshim,
climbed 1.4 percent to 82.43 shekels.  China’s Ministry of Commerce approved China National’s,
also known as ChemChina, agreement to buy a controlling stake in
Makhteshim, the Israeli company said in a statement today.
ChemChina expects to get final approval from the State
Administration of Foreign Exchange of China in the coming days.
The deadline for approvals was extended to May 13.  “The approval is one of the final steps toward an
execution of the deal that benefits Makhteshim and Koor
shareholders,” said Ori Licht, head of research at Tel Aviv-
based IBI-Israel Brokerage & Investments Ltd.  To contact the reporter on this story:
