Coffee shipments from  Brazil , the
world’s largest producer of the commodity, gained 18 percent in
April from a year earlier, according to the nation’s coffee
exporters’ council, known as CeCafe.  Brazilian shipments of the commodity, which include instant
coffee, advanced to 2.7 million bags last month, the group said
today in an e-mailed statement.  Europe  was the biggest importer of Brazilian coffee in the
first four months, buying 56 percent, according to CeCafe. North
America bought 22 percent, the council said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
