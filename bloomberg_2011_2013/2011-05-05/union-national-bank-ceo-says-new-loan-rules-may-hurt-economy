Union National Bank PJSC, whose
shareholders include the governments of  Abu Dhabi  and Dubai,
said new retail loan rules that came into effect May 1 should
have been staggered to reduce their adverse impact.  The guidelines “will squeeze lending to consumers in a
very big way, although it is good for the long-term,” Mohammad Nasr Abdeen, UNB’s chief executive officer, said in an interview
in Abu Dhabi on May 3. The decline in lending will have a
“negative impact” at a difficult time for the economy, and the
central bank could have made the changes in stages, he said.  The United Arab Emirates’ central bank issued  new
guidelines  in February on consumer loans and fees as well as
capped personal loans at 20 times a borrower’s monthly salary in
a bid to control lending and curb charges. The repayment period
for personal loans can’t exceed 48 months, while overall
installments for all loans, including personal, car, housing and
credit cards, must not exceed 50 percent of a borrowers’ gross
salary and any regular income, the bank said.  The U.A.E. economy, the Arab world’s second biggest, is
rebounding from the global credit crisis, which hurt its
property industry and slowed investments. Bank lending increased
1.3 percent in 2010 following a 2.4 percent rise in 2009 after
climbing by more than 30 percent annually from 2005 to 2008.  UNB’s retail loan book “will definitely shrink but it is
not going to affect us in a big way” as the retail lending is
not large, Abdeen said. “Profitability will certainly be
affected if it is not compensated by some other business.”  Lending to Rise  The bank expects overall lending to rise by between five
and 10 percent this year and deposits by 10 percent, Abdeen
said. Analysts’ consensus estimate of UNB’s 2011 profit of 1.43
billion dirhams ($390 million) is “not far from our
expectations,” he said.  UNB reported a 17 percent increase in profit in 2010 to
1.35 billion dirhams. First-quarter profit rose 20 percent to
456.4 million dirhams as loan-loss charges dropped.  Provisions for loan losses in the remaining three quarters
will be about the same or “maybe slightly less” than the first
quarter’s 69 million dirhams, Abdeen said. The bank’s bad loans
ratio is expected to decline from the first quarter’s 1.4
percent if there are no surprises, he said.  Union National Bank  is the U.A.E.’s seventh biggest bank by
assets. UNB’s loan book shrank 0.5 percent to 56.3 billion
dirhams at the end of March from December, while customer
deposits rose 2.8 percent to 59.6 billion dirhams.  The shares were down 1.4 percent at 3.64 dirhams at 1:11
p.m. on the Abu Dhabi bourse today. They have risen 27 percent
this year, compared with a 6.8 percent rise in the exchange’s
bank and finance index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
