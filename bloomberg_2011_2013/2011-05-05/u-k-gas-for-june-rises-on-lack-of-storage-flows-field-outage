U.K. natural gas fell to its lowest in
almost a month as the price of  Brent crude  slumped by the most
in more than two years.  Gas for next winter, the six months from October, fell as
much as 1.6 pence, or 2.25 percent, to 69.5 pence a therm.
That’s the lowest since March 11. It was at 69.6 pence as of
4:30 p.m. in London, according to broker prices compiled by
Bloomberg. That’s equal to $11.43 a million Btu.  The contract rose to its highest in more than two years
last month amid speculation the earthquake and tsunami in  Japan 
would boost gas demand in the country and draw shipments of
liquefied gas away from the Britain. Gas had already been pushed
higher by a halt in gas flows to  Italy  from  Libya .  Oil plunged as the dollar surged against the euro, after
the  European Central Bank  indicated it won’t raise  interest
rates  soon. Brent oil for June fell as much as $8.63, or 7.1
percent, to $112.55 a barrel on the ICE Future  Europe  Exchange
in London.  Lower oil costs push down some mainland European gas
contracts and affect prices in the U.K. because of pipeline
connections to Europe. European Central Bank President Jean- Claude Trichet said today the bank will monitor inflation risks
“very closely,” suggesting it may wait until after June to
raise rates again.  Pipeline deliveries from the Netherlands to the U.K. jumped
in the afternoon, boosting supply, National Grid Plc data show.  BP Plc resolved a fault at its Dimlington natural-gas
terminal in northeast  England , Matt Taylor, a company spokesman
in Aberdeen, Scotland, said by telephone.  “We are in the process of restarting,” he said. Flows
hadn’t resumed by 5 p.m., grid data show.  Demand Below Average  Gas for June fell 0.95 pence, or 1.7 percent, to 55.4 pence
a therm, reversing gains of as much as 0.6 percent.  National Grid forecast gas demand at 277 million cubic
meters in the 24 hours through 6 a.m. London time tomorrow.
That’s 5 million less than normal for the time of year.
Pipelines in the country will contain 337 million cubic meters
of gas at that time, 2 million less than at the start of today.  Same-day gas slipped 2.25 pence to 53.75 pence a therm. Gas
for tomorrow was at 53 pence at 4:30 p.m. today.  U.K. baseload power for tomorrow fell 50 pence, or 1
percent, to 49.80 pounds a megawatt-hour, broker data show.
National Grid predicts peak power use to decline 3.1 percent to
40,050 megawatts tomorrow as businesses curb operations before
the weekend.  Power for next month fell 40 pence to 50.55 pounds a
megawatt-hour. Baseload is delivered around the clock.  To contact the reporter on this story:
