OAO Surgutneftegas plans to pay higher
dividends for 2010 than for the previous year, Chief Executive
Officer Vladimir Bogdanov said.  The payment will rise after profit climbed, Bogdanov told
reporters today in Moscow, without elaborating.  The Surgut, Russia-based oil producer paid 2009 dividends
of 45 kopeks a common share and 1.0488 rubles a preferred share,
according to its website. That was the lowest payout on common
shares in five years and a 21 percent decrease from the previous
year for preferred stock. A kopek is one hundredth of a ruble.  “Every spring people start buying Surgut for the preferred
share dividend,”  Alexei Kokin , an oil and gas analyst at
UralSib Financial Corp., said today by telephone. “The yield is
usually around 6 or 7 percent.” Payments on ordinary shares
tend to be lower and not what investors are looking for, he
said.  Surgutneftegas may pay 2010 dividends of 51 kopeks on
common shares and 1.16 rubles on preferred shares, according
Bloomberg forecasts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
