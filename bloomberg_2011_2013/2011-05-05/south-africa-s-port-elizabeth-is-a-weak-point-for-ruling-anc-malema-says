South Africa’s ruling African National
Congress is campaigning hard in  Port Elizabeth  to prevent the
loss of a second major city to the opposition in local elections
on May 18, said  Julius Malema , leader of the party’s youth wing.  The ANC will still win the constituency, even though its
majority in the city slipped to just over half at the last
national election in 2009, ANC Youth League President Malema
told reporters in Pretoria today. The ANC’s share of the vote in
the coastal city of more than a million fell from 79 percent in
2004.  “We know we are weak in” Port Elizabeth, Malema said.
“We are redoubling our efforts in the Eastern Cape,” where the
country’s sixth-largest metropolitan area is located. “We’re
going there in full force.”  The ANC has been in power since the end of white minority
rule in 1994. It lost control of a major city’s administration
for the first time five years ago, when the opposition
 Democratic Alliance  was voted into office in  Cape Town .  To contact the reporter on this story:
