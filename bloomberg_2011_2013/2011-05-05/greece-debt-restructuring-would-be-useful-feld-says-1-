A restructuring of Greek debt as soon
as this year would be “useful” in the longer term for the
European Stability Mechanism, said Lars Feld, a member of the
German government’s council of economic advisers.  Restructuring  Greece ’s debt now with the help of creditors
would help build up the credibility of the post-2013 ESM, Feld,
who is not involved in policy decisions by  Chancellor Angela Merkel ’s government, said in an interview with Bloomberg
Television in  Frankfurt  today.  “The point of doing it sooner or the request of doing it
sooner rather than later is that you want to have creditors
playing a part,” said Feld. For the ESM “to gain in
credibility, then a Greek restructuring would be a very good
signal to the market, and given that Greece has these
difficulties in fully consolidating its debt, a participation of
creditors as early as this year would be useful.”  Feld, an economics professor from the University of
Freiburg, first made public his view that Greece will be forced
to restructure its debt in January, two months before he joined
the government’s independent team of policy advisers. The group
compiles an annual review of the German economy for the
government published every November and does not have a formal
role in advising on wider policy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
