South Africa  reduced its forecast for
the nation’s winter-wheat harvest to 1.43 million metric tons,
the government’s  Crop Estimates Committee  said.  The forecast was cut from the 1.46 million tons projected
last month after “difficult production conditions led to lower
yields,” committee spokeswoman Marda Scheepers said by phone
today from  Pretoria .  The Crop Estimates Committee was expected to keep its
forecast unchanged, according to the median estimate of nine
traders surveyed by Bloomberg News. Forecasts ranged from 1.36
million tons to 1.46 million tons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
