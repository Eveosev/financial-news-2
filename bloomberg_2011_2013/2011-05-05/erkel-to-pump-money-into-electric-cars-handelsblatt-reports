German  Chancellor Angela Merkel ’s
government will pump billions of euros into the development of
electric cars to help give companies like  Daimler AG (DAI)  a
technological lead over foreign competitors,  Handelsblatt  says.  Germany ’s VDA carmakers association estimates that as much
as 4 billion euros ($5.8 billion) is needed by national
carmakers to develop the technology, and the government is ready
to make up as much as 40 percent of the costs, the newspaper
said in a preview of an article to be published in tomorrow’s
edition that cites Transport Ministry documents.  Transport Minister Peter Ramsauer will present Merkel with
a package of proposals to boost the technology on May 16, the
newspaper said. They also include a proposal to exempt electric
cars from vehicle tax for 10 years, tax relief on buying the
cars and priority parking on public lots.  To contact the reporter on this story:
