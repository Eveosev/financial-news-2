Grain loadings for export from the
French port of Rouen,  Europe ’s biggest cereal-shipping hub,
jumped 43 percent in the week through yesterday on the biggest
wheat shipments to  Algeria  since at least July.  Outbound shipments were 190,481 metric tons between April
28 and May 4, including 153,308 tons of wheat and 37,173 tons of
barley, the  Seine River port  said in an e-mailed statement
today. Loadings rose from 133,116 tons the previous week.  Wheat volumes for North Africa rose to the highest in five
weeks. Algeria was the biggest export destination with 115,075
tons of wheat, followed by  Tunisia  with 25,033 tons.  Algeria, North Africa’s second-largest wheat buyer after
 Egypt , bought 2.95 million tons of wheat between Dec. 16 and
Jan. 26, probably a record for a five-week period, French crops
office FranceAgriMer reported in February.  France ’s other main grain ports are La Pallice in the Bay
of Biscay and Dunkirk on the North Sea coast.  Rouen grain loadings by destination, in tons:  To contact the reporter on this story:
