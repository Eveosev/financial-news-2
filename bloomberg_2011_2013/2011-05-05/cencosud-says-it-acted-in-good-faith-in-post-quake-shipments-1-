Cencosud SA,  Latin America ’s third-
largest retailer by sales, faces a fine of as much as five times
any taxes owed on goods shipped to  Chile  from Argentina after
last year’s earthquake, a tax official said.  Argentina’s tax agency, known as AFIP, raided eight
Cencosud offices in  Buenos Aires  and four in Mendoza to gather
information on donations to Chile, the official, who declined to
be named citing government policy, said today by telephone.  The donations of $7 million were exempt of value added,
 capital gains  and export taxes on the condition they were not
sold, the official said. If the goods were sold in Chile, fines
could range from one to five times owed taxes or, in the case of
criminal charges in a federal court, four to 20 times the value
of the goods and jail terms for those found guilty, the official
said.  Cencosud “acted in good faith” in sending donations from
 Argentina  to Chile after the 8.8-magnitude earthquake and didn’t
profit from the goods, the company said today in an e-mailed
statement. The company declined to comment on possible fines, a
public relations representative said by telephone from Santiago.  The agency will issue a statement in the coming days, the
Argentine tax official said.  Cencosud fell 0.5 percent to 3,518.40 pesos in Santiago
trading after rising as much as 2.5 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
