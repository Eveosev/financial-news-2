Los Angeles Dodgers players could file
for free agency if the team can’t make payroll, Major League
Baseball players union spokesman Greg Bouris said in an e-mail.  The Los Angeles Times reported two days ago that the
Dodgers don’t have enough cash to make payroll at the end of
May. Major League Baseball spokesman Pat Courtney declined to
comment on whether MLB would step in and provide the money.  MLB Commissioner Bud Selig appointed former Texas Rangers
President Tom Schieffer on April 25 to take over operations of
the team because of Selig’s “deep concerns” about the club’s
finances.  To contact the reporter on this story:
