Orange output in  Brazil ’s  Sao Paulo 
state, the world’s biggest producing region, may rise more than
previously forecast this year because of adequate rains during
the flowering season, the country’s  Agriculture Ministry  said.  Sao Paulo state will produce 355 million boxes this year,
up from a January forecast of 352.9 million boxes, the
ministry’s Conab crop forecasting agency said today in an e-
mailed statement. Last year, growers in Sao Paulo produced 322.2
million boxes.  About 303 million boxes will go to industrial producers of
juice and 52 million boxes may be consumed as fruit, Conab said.  Trees of the citrus fruit in the state, which accounts for
about 80 percent of the South American country’s orange output,
will cover a total of 601,622 hectares (1.49 million acres),
Conab said.  One orange box weights 40.8 kilos (90 pounds).  To contact the reporter on this story:
