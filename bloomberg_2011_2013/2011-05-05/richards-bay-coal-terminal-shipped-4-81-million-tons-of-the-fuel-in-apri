Richards Bay Coal Terminal,  Africa ’s
largest export facility for the fuel, said it shipped 4.81
million metric tons of the fuel in April.  The terminal, on  South Africa ’s eastern coast, received
5.45 million tons and had stocks of 3.63 million tons at the end
of the month, it said in a  statement  published on its website 
today.  RBCT’s owners, which include  Anglo American Plc (AAL) ,  BHP
Billiton Ltd. (BHP) ,  Xstrata Plc (XTA)  and  Total SA (FP)  among others, are trying
to boost exports to take advantage of rising prices. Shipments
to the terminal, which can export 91 million tons a year, have
been constrained by freight rail accidents.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
