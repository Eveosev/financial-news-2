Lincoln Educational Services Corp. (LINC) ,
the for-profit college company with 45 campuses in 17 states,
said first-quarter profit declined 28 percent and cut its annual
revenue forecast as student enrollment declined.  Net income dropped to $10.4 million, or 46 cents a share,
from $14.5 million, or 55 cents, a year earlier, the  West Orange ,
New Jersey-based company said today in a statement. The college
operator cut its 2011 revenue forecast to $565 million to $585
million from $600 million to $615 million and said it expects
new student enrollments to fall as much as 16 percent this year.  For-profit colleges are facing scrutiny from regulators and
lawmakers who say some universities aren’t adequately preparing
students for employment and graduates can’t repay their
federally backed loans.  To contact the reporter on this story:
