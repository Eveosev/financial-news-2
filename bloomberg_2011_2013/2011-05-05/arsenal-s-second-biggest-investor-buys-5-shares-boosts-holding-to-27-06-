Red and White Holdings, the second
biggest investor in Arsenal soccer club, bought five more shares
to increase its stake to 27.06 percent of the team.  The holding company, controlled by Russian billionaire
 Alisher Usmanov , paid 11,950 pounds ($19,734) each, and now owns
16,835 shares, according to a Regulatory News Service statement
today.  U.S. billionaire Stan Kroenke is in the process of
expanding his holding in the London soccer team. Yesterday, he
said he exercised an option to buy 10,025 shares for 11,750
pounds each. Kroenke had an agreement to buy the 10,025 shares
of the late board member Danny Fiszman, as well as another
holding controlled by Nina Bracewell-Smith. The two purchases
will eventually increase his stake to 63 percent.  Last month, Usmanov said he’s not interested in selling his
stake to Kroenke.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
