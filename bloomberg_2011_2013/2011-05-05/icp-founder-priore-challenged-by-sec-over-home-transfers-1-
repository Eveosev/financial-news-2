ICP Asset Management LLC  founder
 Thomas Priore  was accused by the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission of illegally selling two homes into trusts controlled
by himself, his wife and a friend after he was told the agency
planned to sue him for fraud.  The SEC today asked a federal court in  New York  to let it
amend a complaint filed in June against Priore, ICP and two
related companies to include allegations that Priore
fraudulently transferred the homes, located on Martha’s Vineyard
in  Massachusetts  and in Chappaqua, New York.  In the original complaint, the SEC claimed Priore and New
York-based ICP fraudulently directed more than $1 billion of
trades at artificially high prices on behalf of collateralized
debt obligations they managed.  After his lawyer was told the agency intended to sue,
Priore sold the  Martha’s Vineyard  property, for $1, and the
Chappaqua home, for $10, to the trusts “to hinder the
commission’s ability to collect disgorgement, penalties and
prejudgment interest from him,” the SEC said in its proposed
amended complaint.  Dane Butswinkas, a lawyer representing Priore and ICP,
didn’t immediately return a voice-mail message seeking comment
on the new allegations. The defendants have denied wrongdoing
and are fighting the suit.  The case is SEC v. ICP Asset Management LLC, 10-CV-4791,
U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York ( Manhattan ).  To contact the reporter on this story:
