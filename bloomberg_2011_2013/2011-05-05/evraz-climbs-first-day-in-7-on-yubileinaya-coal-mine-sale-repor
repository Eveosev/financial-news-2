Evraz Group SA (EVR)  gained for the first
day in seven after Vedomosti reported the Russian steelmaker may
sell its Yubileinaya coal mine, site of an accidental blast in
2007 that killed 39 people.  The stock added as much as 2 percent to $32.77, before
trading up 0.2 percent as of 9:24 a.m. in London.  A regional holding called Topprom has applied to  Russia â€™s
Federal Antimonopoly Service to buy the mine, Vedomosti said
citing an unidentified person in the agency. Evraz confirmed
potential purchase interest from Topprom without providing
further details, Vedomosti said, citing an unidentified Evraz
representative.  To contact the reporter on this story:
