U.S. manufacturing may experience a
renaissance as rising wages in  China , higher costs of materials
and shipping and states’ tax incentives alter companies’
calculations on where to locate production, the Wall Street
Journal said, citing Christian Murck, who heads the American
Chamber of Commerce in China, and a Boston Consulting Group
report to be published today.  By 2015, if Chinese labor costs continue to rise, it will
make sense for U.S. companies in industries such as electronics
to locate new factories at home rather than in China, according
to Harold Sirkin, a senior partner at Boston Consulting, the
newspaper said.   Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
