NRG Energy Inc. (NRG) , the largest U.S.
independent power producer, is seeking $3.9 billion of loans to
refinance debt and loosen financing terms.  The company plans to issue a $1.6 billion term loan due in
seven years and a $2.3 billion revolving  credit line , Chief
Financial Officer Christian Schade said today during a
conference call with analysts and investors to discuss first-
quarter earnings.  NRG plans to “simplify” its capital structure and delay
debt maturities by refinancing a first-lien credit facility as
well as its senior secured notes maturing in 2016 and 2017, the
Princeton, New Jersey-based company said today in a regulatory
filing. Looser financial maintenance requirements will also
enable NRG to “opportunistically” invest in growth initiatives
and improve investor returns.  “As part of this refinancing, we expect to replace
restrictive covenant packages with a more flexible structure
allowing us to return value to shareholders,” Schade said
during the call. “Our primarily goal in this process would be
to eliminate investment basket restrictions, cash flow sweep
restrictions and mirror the covenant packages currently in the
indentures governing our most recent bond issuances and
specifically those in 2018, 2019 and 2020.”  After the transaction, all of NRG’s outstanding debt will
have a common covenant package, Schade said.  NRG owes about $612 million on a term loan due Feb. 1,
2013, the company said in its first-quarter report filed with
the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The debt pays 1.75
percentage points more than the London interbank offered rate,
the company’s annual report shows.  Letters of Credit  A $1 billion term loan due Aug. 31, 2015, pays a spread of
3.25 percentage points more than Libor, a rate banks charge to
lend to each other, regulatory filings show.  The company also has $800 million outstanding on a letter
of credit facility due 2015 and $500 on a loan due 2013, paying
the same  interest rates  with the term loans due on those dates,
the filings show.  Citigroup Inc. and Morgan Stanley led banks in 2006 to
arrange the credit facility, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The loans also include an $875 million revolving
credit line due Aug. 31, 2015, according to today’s first-
quarter report. Borrowings under the revolver pay a margin of
3.25 percentage points over Libor.  To contact the reporter on this story:
