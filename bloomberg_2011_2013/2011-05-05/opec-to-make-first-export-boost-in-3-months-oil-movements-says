The Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries will increase exports for the first time
since February as refiners prepare to meet peak summer demand
for driving fuels, according to tanker-tracker Oil Movements.  OPEC, responsible for 40 percent of global supplies, will
ship 22.71 million barrels a day in the four weeks to May 21, up
0.4 percent from 22.61 million barrels a day in the period to
April 23, the consultant said today in a report. The data
exclude  Ecuador  and Angola.  “Crude demand is going up with refinery runs as we head
into the summer,” Roy Mason, Oil Movements’ founder, said by
phone from Halifax,  England . “However, it isn’t going up much.
By normal standards it’s pretty anemic.”  Shipments from Middle Eastern producers, including those
from non-OPEC members Oman and Yemen, will be unchanged at 17.41
million barrels a day in the four weeks to May 21, according to
the report.  An average of 467.38 million barrels of crude will be on
board tankers in the month to May 21, down 2.4 percent from
478.76 million barrels in the four weeks to April 23, Oil
Movements said.  Oil Movements calculates shipments by keeping a tally of
tanker-rental agreements. Its figures exclude crude held on
board ships used as floating storage.  OPEC’s members are Algeria, Angola, Ecuador,  Iran , Iraq,
Kuwait,  Libya , Nigeria, Qatar,  Saudi Arabia , the United Arab
Emirates and Venezuela. Iraq is exempt from the quota system.
The organization is next due to meet on June 8 in Vienna.  To contact the reporter on this story:
