Merck & Co. is close to settling
patent lawsuits against  Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (TEVA)  over
a generic version of the cholesterol drug Vytorin, according to
a federal court document.  The two sides have asked to put on hold patent suits that
Merck’s Schering unit filed in 2009 and 2010 to prevent Teva
from selling a generic version of the drug. U.S. Magistrate
Judge Esther Salas in Newark,  New Jersey , delayed all actions
until June 1 “to finalize settlement,” the May 3 filing shows.  Vytorin generated $480 million in global sales in the first
quarter for Whitehouse Station, New Jersey-based Merck, the
company said May 3. That includes $247 million in U.S. sales,
said  Ron Rogers , a spokesman for Merck. The company had filed
suit to prevent Teva from selling copies of the medicine until
patents expire in 2014 and 2017.  Rogers said “the filing speaks for itself” when asked
about a potential agreement. Denise Bradley, a spokeswoman for
 Petah Tikva , Israel-based Teva, said the company had no comment.  The cases are Schering Corp. v. Teva Pharmaceuticals USA
Inc., 10cv1058 and 10-4473, both U.S. District Court for the
District of New Jersey (Newark).  To contact the reporter on this story:
