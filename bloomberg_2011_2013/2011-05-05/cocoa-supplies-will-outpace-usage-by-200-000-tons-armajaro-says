Cocoa supplies will outpace demand by
200,000 metric tons in the current crop year, according to
Armajaro Trading Ltd., the agricultural-commodities trading arm
of  Armajaro Holdings Ltd.   “The mid-crop will be pretty good in West Africa,”
William Venables, head of cocoa trading at the London-based
company, said in an interview yesterday at its Mayfair offices,
referring to the smaller of two annual harvests.  It is still too early to forecast supply and demand for the
next crop, he added. Harvesting of the main crop starts in
October. Rabobank International has estimated a deficit of
30,000 tons for the 2011-12 season, while ABN Amro NV and VM
Group have said demand will outpace supply by 94,000 tons in the
period.  Armajaro Trading, founded in 1998, specializes in sourcing
cocoa, coffee and sugar and employs more than 2,000 people
globally, according to its  website . Richard Ryan is chief
executive officer of Armajaro Trading.  To contact the reporter on this story:
