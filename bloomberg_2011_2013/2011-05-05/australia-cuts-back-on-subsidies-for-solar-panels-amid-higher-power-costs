The Australian government will make
deeper cuts on subsidies offered to residents to install solar
power panels because of higher power prices.  The reduction in subsidies is also in response to declining
costs of the systems, the strong Australian dollar and reduced
demand for clean-energy technologies such as solar hot water
systems, the Minister for Climate Change and  Energy Efficiency ,
 Greg Combet , said today in a  statement .  The solar credits subsidies are based on the prices of
renewable energy certificates and a multiplier. In December the
government said the current multiplier of five will be cut to
four in July. It has now decided to cut it three. Over the next
two years, this will be reduced to two and one respectively.
This means the program will end in 2013.  By taking this action, costs of the small-scale renewable
energy program for electricity users “are likely to be around
half of what they otherwise would be in 2012 while at the same
time still providing considerable support to households taking
action on  climate change ,” Combet said.  The government will work with state and territory to ensure
their feed-in tariffs “do not impose an unjustifiable burden on
electricity consumers either through cross-subsidy mechanisms or
their impact on the SRES,” he said.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
