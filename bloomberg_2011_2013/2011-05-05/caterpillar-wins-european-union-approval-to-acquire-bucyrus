Caterpillar Inc. (CAT) , the world’s largest
maker of construction equipment, won approval from European
Union antitrust regulators to buy  Bucyrus International Inc. (BUCY)  in
a transaction valued at $8.6 billion including debt.  The deal, which adds shovels and drills to Caterpillar’s
range of mining machinery, won’t hurt competition in the 27-
nation EU, the European Commission said in an e-mailed  statement 
today.  “Whilst the transaction will result in high combined
market shares worldwide, the increase in market share accounted
for by Bucyrus is relatively low,” the commission said.  Caterpillar is betting on higher mining-equipment sales
with its acquisition of Bucyrus as Asian demand drives up
commodity prices. The company has said it plans about $3 billion
in  capital spending  this year, with more than half of that in
the U.S.  Bucyrus would be Caterpillar’s biggest acquisition since at
least 1980, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, followed by
the company’s purchase of Perkins Ltd. in 1997 for $1.3 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
