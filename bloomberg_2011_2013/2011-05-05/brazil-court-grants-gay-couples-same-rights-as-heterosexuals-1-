Brazil ’s  Supreme Court  ruled in a
unanimous decision that homosexual partners can form a civil
union, enjoying the same legal rights as heterosexuals,
according to a statement on the court’s website.  After a two-day deliberation, 10 judges voted to recognize
that gays in a stable relationship enjoy property, health
insurance, pension, and all other legal rights, the statement
said. Judge Jose Antonio Dias Toffoli recused himself from the
case because he had worked on it as attorney general, said a
spokesman for the court, who declined to be identified, citing
internal rules.  The court voted on two cases, one from Rio de Janeiro state
and another from the federal prosecutor’s office. The attorney
general’s office supported the extension of rights on human
rights grounds. The national confederation of Brazilian bishops
opposed granting rights to gay couples, saying the constitution
mentioned specifically couples constituted by men and women.  Argentina  last year became the first Latin American country
to approve gay marriage, and  Mexico ’s  Supreme Court  in August
upheld a 2009 Mexico City law allowing gays to marry. Gay
couples in Colombia also enjoy pension, social security and
property rights.  To contact the reporter on this story:
