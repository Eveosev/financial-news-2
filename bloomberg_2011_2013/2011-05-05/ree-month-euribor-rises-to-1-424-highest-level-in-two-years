The rate at which European banks say
they see each other lending in euros for three months rose to
the highest level in more than two years, according to the
European Banking Federation.  The euro interbank offered rate, or Euribor, rose for a
12th consecutive day before a European Central Bank meeting at
which economists expect officials to leave  interest rates 
unchanged and ECB President  Jean-Claude Trichet  to signal
increases may be ahead. The rate climbed 0.9 basis point to
1.424 percent today, EBF data showed. Thatâ€™s the highest level
since April 9, 2009.  The ECB raised its benchmark refinancing rate by 25 basis
points to 1.25 percent at its April 7 meeting to contain
inflation. Policy makers will leave the rate unchanged today,
according to all 48 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.  To contact the reporter on this story:
