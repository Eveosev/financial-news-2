Moves in the foreign-exchange market
are being driven in part by declines in stocks and commodities,
and won’t prompt the  Bank of Japan  to intervene to curb yen
gains, Robert Sinche, global head of currency strategy at Royal
Bank of Scotland Plc in  Stamford , Connecticut, said in a
telephone interview.  On today’s markets:  “There was a big move down in the equity market starting
just after 3 p.m., and that has triggered another leg of moves
in FX. This is a significant liquidation of things that have
performed very well in the last couple of months.”  “A lot of this is outright liquidation of positions. A lot
of this was cross-yen positions. Aussie-yen liquidation, some
euro-yen liquidation.”  On the Bank of  Japan :  “When you’re cleaning out positions like this and it’s not
really a dollar-generated move, I’m not sure the intense
pressure is all that much for the BOJ to be there.”  “Japan is a big importer of energy, so with  oil prices 
down around 10 percent on the day it’s not bad for Japan.”  “Policy makers will look at this and view this as a major
correction. Trying to step in the middle of this is probably not
a good idea.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
