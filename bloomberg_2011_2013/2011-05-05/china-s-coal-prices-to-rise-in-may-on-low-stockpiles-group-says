Power-station coal prices in  China  may
rise in May before stabilizing, as inventories at ports remain
low, China Coal Transport and Distribution Association said.  The increase in domestic prices will slow as port
stockpiles gradually increase, aided by government orders to
boost coal supplies and resumption of normal rail transport
capacity on the Daqin line after maintenance in April, the
association said in the  report  published on its website today.  Rising coal prices in China have deterred purchases by
utilities and coupled with higher-than-expected industrial
activity, have caused power shortages in some regions. Prices at
Qinhuangdao port, a Chinese benchmark, rose to the highest in
more than two years. Stockpiles there fell to the lowest in a
year this week, according to data from the association May 3.  Coal imports will increase in May as buyers turn to global
supplies in the face of high domestic prices, China Coal
Transport said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
