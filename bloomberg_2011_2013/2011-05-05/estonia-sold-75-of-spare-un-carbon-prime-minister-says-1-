Estonia has disposed of about 75
percent of its 85 million metric tons of spare carbon permits
awarded under a United Nations program in sales totaling 360
million euros ($534 million), Prime Minister  Andrus Ansip  said.  Estonia is holding talks on “several” more deals to sell
spare Assigned Amount Units, known as AAUs, Environment Minister
Keit Pentus said at a news conference with Ansip in Tallinn. The
Cabinet authorized Pentus earlier today to sign an agreement to
sell an undisclosed amount of permits to Spain in a deal valued
at 45 million euros.  “We’ve got slightly more than a quarter of the spare quota
left to be sold,” Ansip said. “Whether we’ll succeed is a
different question as the gap between supply and demand is
growing by the day.”  Keit Kasemets, strategy director at the state chancellery
in Tallinn, said in March that the selloff amounted to
“somewhat more than” 60 percent of total after the country had
signed the previous three deals with Japan’s Mitsubishi Corp.
and Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp.  Estonia intends to use proceed from the sale of AAUs to
 Spain  to buy 15 or 16 trams to serve Tallinn, Pentus said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
