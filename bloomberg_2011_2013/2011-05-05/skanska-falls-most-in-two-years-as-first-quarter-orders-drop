Skanska AB (SKAB) , the Nordic region’s
biggest builder, fell the most in more than two years after
saying first-quarter order bookings declined.  Skanska plunged as much as 10.8 kronor, or 8.4 percent, the
biggest intraday drop since April 7, 2009, and was down 6.6
percent as of 9:28 a.m. local time in Stockholm. The shares have
fallen 10 percent this year, valuing the Stockholm-based company
at 50.7 billion kronor ($8.36 billion.)  “This is a very weak report, it’s hard to find any bright
spots,” said David Zaudy, an analyst at Ohman Group with an
“outperform” rating on the shares.  “It’s bad on order intake
and it’s bad on the underlying construction margin.”  Skanska’s orders fell 16 percent to 21.6 billion kronor
from a year ago, the company said in a statement. Skanska’s
“unusually long" order backlog and high capacity utilization
forced the company to be more ‘‘restrictive’’ in its bids for
tenders, Chief Executive Officer Johan Karlstrom said in the
statement.  Net income fell to 335 million kronor, or 0.81 krona per
share, from 674 million kronor, or 1.52 krona, a year earlier.
Zaudy said he had estimated a 527 million-krona profit.
Skanska’s operating margin fell to 1.4 percent from 2.4 percent.  Skanska made a 132 million-krona profit, down from 629
million kronor, under its new IFRS accounting system that it’s
adopting.  The company eliminated 10,261 jobs, or almost 17 percent of
its workforce, from 2007 until mid-2010 in response to the
industry decline during the global recession. It has since
started rehiring as the economic recovery has spurred more
construction.  Skanska’s lack of capacity is ‘‘on the one hand good as the
outlook is they have good future demand on the Nordic
construction markets,” analyst Zaudy said. “But we want an
answer on, how long is this lack of capacity going to last and
what will it do for the construction margin in 2011.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
