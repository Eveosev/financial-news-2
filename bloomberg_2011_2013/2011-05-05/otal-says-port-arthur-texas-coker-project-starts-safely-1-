Total SA (FP) ,  Europe ’s third-largest oil
company, started a new 50,000-barrel-a-day coker project at its
Port Arthur refinery in  Texas  that will increase the refinery’s
ability to process heavy and sour crude oil, according to a
company statement.  "Refineries have to be flexible in the purchase of crude
and the changing specifications," Michel Benezit, Total’s
president of refining and marketing, said today during the
project inauguration in Port Arthur. “Refineries have to adjust
to a changing crude market.”  The Deep Conversion project, announced in 2008, entailed
constructing units including a coker, a vacuum distillation
unit, a distillate hydrotreater, and a coker naphtha
hydrotreater. Other units were added to handle hydrogen
purification and sulfur recovery, according to Total, and the
refinery’s power system was upgraded.  “This project gave us the access to a much wider range of
crudes,” said Darrell Jacob, the manager of the refinery.  The refinery can process 240,000 barrels of crude oil
daily, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
