Venezuela will seek investment in the
country’s gold industry to boost production of the metal as
illegal miners account for almost half the country’s output.  Venezuela is producing “only” 11 metric tons of gold a
year and alleged illegal miners extract another 10 to 11 tons a
year, President  Hugo Chavez  said. The government will label the
metal “strategic” and set geographical limits for its
production in the country, he said.  “The gold mafia is taking it, and the state has to act,”
Chavez said today on state television. “We have to look for
investors to increase production with a new vision. We can’t
just depend on one company.”  Venezuela is facing international arbitration over
nationalized gold assets from two companies including Crystallex
International Corp., a Canadian gold producer. The Toronto-based
company’s stock plunged as much as 43 percent on Feb. 7 when it
received a letter saying the Venezuelan government had
terminated its Las Cristinas gold contract.  Vancouver-based Rusoro Mining Ltd. expects to quadruple its
output of gold in  Venezuela  by 2013 after the government in
August relaxed export limits to 50 percent from 30 percent.  Gold for immediate delivery extended declines today,
falling 2.9 percent to $1,473.10 an ounce at 4:50 p.m. New York
time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
