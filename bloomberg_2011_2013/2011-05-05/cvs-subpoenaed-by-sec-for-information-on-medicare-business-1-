CVS Caremark Corp. (CVS) , the largest U.S.
provider of  prescription drugs , was subpoenaed by U.S.
regulators seeking corporate records, including information on
2009 disclosures related to Medicare.  The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission also sought
information about certain officers’ ownership and transactions
in the company’s securities, according to a regulatory filing
today by Woonsocket, Rhode Island-based CVS. The company is
cooperating with the request, dated Feb. 28, and has been
providing documents and other information, it said.  CVS, which today reported earnings that beat analysts’
estimates, rose 67 cents to $36.79 as of 6:40 p.m. in New York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
