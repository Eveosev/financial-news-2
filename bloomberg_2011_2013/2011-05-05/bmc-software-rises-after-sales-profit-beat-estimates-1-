BMC Software Inc. (BMC)  rose the most in six
months after fiscal fourth-quarter earnings and sales topped
analysts’ predictions, driven by demand for cloud computing and
other software.  BMC climbed $2.19, or 4.5 percent, to $51.26 at 4 p.m.  New
York  time in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. It earlier rose as
high $53.81 for the biggest intraday gain since Feb. 5, 2009.
Profit excluding some items of 78 cents topped analysts’
estimates by 1 cent, while sales of $562.2 million were 4.2
percent higher than projections.  Houston-based BMC, which sells software that lets
information technology departments better manage fleets of
computers is benefitting as customers update their data centers
with systems running newer technologies. Those include servers
running Web-based applications and so-called virtualization
software, which helps computers run more efficiently.  Demand for BMC’s mainframe management software increased
after International Business Machines Corp.’s released a new
mainframe system earlier this year, Yun Kim, an analyst at
Gleacher & Co. in New York, said in a note to clients today. Kim
has a neutral rating on BMC.  2012 earnings excluding some costs will be $3.21 to $3.31 a
share, the company said in a  statement  after the close of U.S.
markets yesterday.  Cash flow  from operations will be between
$825 million and $875 million, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
