Operators of Airbus SAS narrowbody
planes were ordered to check the nuts on fuselages and fuel
tanks after some of the parts were found to have cracked.  Operators will check about 170 A318, A319, A320 and A321
jetliners for the faults, the European Aviation Safety Agency
said in  airworthiness directives  published yesterday.  Airbus found the cracks during production of the aircraft,
the  directives  said. Tests found no immediate action is
necessary. The location of the nuts, on “primary structural
elements,” means they must be inspected, and replaced if
necessary.  “This condition, if not corrected, could impair the
structural integrity of the affected airplanes,” the regulator
said.  “This is a proposed directive, for consultation, and
there’s  no immediate cause for concern,” Justin Dubon, an
Airbus spokesman, said by phone.  Airbus, based in Toulouse,  France , is a unit of European
Aeronautic, Defence and Space Co. Airbus has delivered more than
4,600 narrowbody aircraft.  To contact the reporter on this story:
