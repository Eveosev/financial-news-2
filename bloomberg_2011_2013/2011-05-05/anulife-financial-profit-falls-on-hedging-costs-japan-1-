Manulife Financial Corp. (MFC) ,  Canada ’s
largest insurer, reported first-quarter profit that fell less
than analysts expected as higher premiums in the U.S. and Canada
countered claims from the earthquake in  Japan .  Net income fell 20 percent to C$985 million ($1.02 billion)
or 53 cents a share, from C$1.22 billion, or 66 cents, a year
earlier, the Toronto-based insurer said today in a statement.  Profit from Canada climbed 79 percent on higher premiums
and deposits, while U.S. insurance earnings surged 91 percent to
C$403 million. U.S. asset management dropped 15 percent to C$312
million and profit from its Asian unit declined 3.8 percent.  “Their underlying business is solid and it is growing,”
said  John Kinsey , a  fund manager  at Toronto-based Caldwell
Securities Ltd. “The worst is behind them now.”  The owner of Boston-based John Hancock Financial said
profit was eroded by C$100 million in “macro hedging” costs
and C$151 million for Japanese earthquake claims.  The insurer was expected to report net income of 27 cents a
share, or 35 cents a share excluding one-time items, based on
Bloomberg surveys.  Manulife fell 20 cents to C$16.62 in 4 p.m. trading on the
Toronto Stock Exchange. The shares had fallen 3.1 percent this
year before today, the worst performer on the six-member S&P/TSX
Life & Health Insurance Index.  Insurance Profit  Chief Executive Officer Donald Guloien has said the company
plans to hedge 60 percent of its equity risk by 2012 and 75
percent by the end of 2014. The insurer said today it’s “ahead
of our timetable” reducing that risk. He hasn’t changed the
2014 target.  Guloien told investors at the company’s annual meeting in
Toronto today that the greatest risks the company faces are
changes to accounting rules and capital standards.  “We don’t really live in fear that this is going to
happen, but we don’t know what’s going to happen,” Guloien said
today in a telephone interview. “We have to be honest with our
investors that this is a risk.”  This quarter is the first in which Manulife reported
according to International Financial Reporting Standards, an
accounting process that changes the impact of hedging and other
expenses.  Great-West Lifeco Inc. (GWO)  reported today that first-quarter
profit fell 2.8 percent to C$415 million, or 44 cents a share,
from C$428 million, or 45 cents, in the year-earlier period.
Results, which missed analysts’ estimates, were affected by
earthquakes in Japan and  New Zealand  that reduced earnings by
C$75 million, or 8 cents a share, the company said.  Sun Life Financial Inc. (SLF)  reported late yesterday that profit
climbed 5.8 percent to C$438 million, or 73 cents a share,
topping analysts’ estimates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
