Scheduled natural gas deliveries to
U.S. electricity generators fell for a second day on forecasts
of cooler weather that would reduce air-conditioner use.
Shipments to the Southeast dropped 12.5 percent.  A sample of scheduled deliveries to  power plants  in the

compiled by Bloomberg. Shipments to power generators in the
Southeast slipped to 2.8 million.  Scheduled shipments for U.S. residences fell 18.3 percent
to 25.1 million dekatherms.  The high temperature in Charleston,  South Carolina , today
is forecast to be 74 degrees Fahrenheit (20 Celsius), 6 below
normal, according to AccuWeather Inc. in  State College ,
Pennsylvania. It may rise to 76 tomorrow.  Wholesale gas at the Sonat-T1 hub, where gas is delivered
from Texas and Louisiana to the Southeast, slid 11.86 cents, or
2.6 percent, to $4.4769 per million British thermal units at
1:25 p.m. New York time on the  Intercontinental Exchange .  Gas at the Henry Hub in Erath, Louisiana, the delivery
point for futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange,
