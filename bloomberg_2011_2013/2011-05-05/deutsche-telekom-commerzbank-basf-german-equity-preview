German stocks rose, with the  DAX Index (DAX) 
trimming its weekly drop, as  ThyssenKrupp AG (TKA)  gained after the
company announced a reorganization and the  U.S. economy  added
more jobs than forecast in April.  ThyssenKrupp increased the most in two years after
 Germany ’s biggest steelmaker said the reorganization will
include the sale or spinoff of units with 10 billion euros
($14.5 billion) in revenue. Deutsche Lufthansa AG,  Wincor
Nixdorf AG (WIN)  and  Vossloh AG (VOS)  rose after analysts recommended buying
their shares.  The benchmark DAX Index climbed 1.6 percent to 7,492.25 at
the 5:30 p.m. close in Frankfurt. The gauge still retreated 0.3
percent this week as reports showed Germany’s factory orders
unexpectedly dropped in March and U.S. jobless claims rose last
week. The broader  HDAX Index (HDAX)  gained 1.5 percent today.  “Payrolls data was the only positive signal of the whole
week,” said  Markus Wallner , a senior equity strategist at
 Commerzbank AG (CBK)  in Frankfurt. “I’m relatively positive for the
next couple of weeks. The earnings season is good and the DAX
should stabilize around 7,400-7,550.”  German stocks extended gains as U.S. payrolls rose by
244,000 workers last month, the biggest increase since May 2010,
following a revised 221,000 expansion the prior month, the Labor
Department said today in  Washington . Economists had projected an
April rise of 185,000, according to the median estimate in a
Bloomberg News survey. Employment excluding government jobs
jumped the most in five years. The jobless rate rose to 9
percent, the first increase since November.  ThyssenKrupp Surges  ThyssenKrupp jumped 8 percent to 32.22 euros, the steepest
gain since May 2009. The company said it will separate the
stainless-steel business and consider “all options” for the
unit. It will also sell units including ThyssenKrupp Waupaca, a
U.S. iron-casting business, and a Brazilian automotive-component
manufacturer. The businesses affected in the reorganization
employ 35,000 people, ThyssenKrupp said.  Lufthansa increased 4.1 percent to 15.27 euros, the biggest
gain since August 2009, after UBS AG upgraded  Europe ’s second-
largest airline to “buy” from “hold.”  Wincor Nixdorf rose 3.8 percent to 49.76 euros, the biggest
advance in six months, as the maker of banking machines and cash
registers was raised to “buy” from “hold” at UniCredit SpA.
Vossloh gained for the first time this week, adding 2.7 percent
to 94.50 euros. The railroad-equipment maker was upgraded to
“buy” from “hold” at UniCredit.  Kloeckner & Co. gained 5 percent to 25.22 euros, the
highest price in three months, as the steel distributor was
raised to “selected list” from “outperform” at CA Cheuvreux.  To contact the reporter on this story:
