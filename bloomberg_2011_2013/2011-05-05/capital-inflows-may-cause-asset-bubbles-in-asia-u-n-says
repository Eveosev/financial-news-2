Economies in  Asia  should step up
capital controls to curb inflation and asset bubbles caused by
accommodative monetary policies in developed countries, the
 United Nations  said today.  “Capital controls should be seen as important elements of
the policy tool kit for reducing the volatility of the capital
flows”, the agency said in its annual economic and social
survey on the region. “Short-term capital attracted by higher
returns in the region is leading to exchange rate pressure and
could spill over into asset bubbles, which fuel inflation and
create market distortions.”  The region has seen some of the world’s “steepest
increases” in property prices, and capital inflows have
introduced additional appreciation pressure on currencies
including those of economies running current account deficits,
such as  India , it said.  Governments have built up foreign-exchange reserves as
insurance against the influx of speculative funds, which might
be “inadequate in some cases,” the agency said, citing a
financial vulnerability indicator compiled by the Economic and
Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific.  --Victoria Ruan. Editors: Nerys Avery, John Liu  To contact Bloomberg News staff on this story:
