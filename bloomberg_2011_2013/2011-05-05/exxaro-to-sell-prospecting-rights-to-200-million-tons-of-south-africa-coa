Exxaro Resources Ltd. (EXX) ,  South Africa ’s
second-largest coal producer by output, said it plans to sell
prospecting rights to properties containing about 200 million
metric tons of reserves it doesn’t plan to develop.  There’s a “very low probability” that Exxaro will develop
the assets, Finance Director Wim de Klerk said in an e-mailed
reply to questions today. The sale will allow the Pretoria-based
company to focus on other projects, he wrote.  Exxaro called for expressions of interest in the assets
today, including Arnot South, Kranspan and Vaalbult in
Mpumalanga province, the nation’s biggest coal region. It plans
to boost  capital spending  on coal and mineral sands projects
threefold to 8.2 billion rand ($1.2 billion) this year.  Exxaro produced 47 million tons last year, according to its
website.  Anglo American Plc (AAL)  produced 59 million tons.  Exxaro fell 5 rand, or 3 percent, to 163 rand by the 5 p.m.
close of trading in Johannesburg, the lowest price in more than
a month, giving the company a value of 58.4 billion rand.  To contact the reporter on this story:
