South Africa â€™s  Civil Aviation
Authority  is investigating a breach of regulations after  South
African Airways  canceled a flight between Johannesburg and  New
York  on May 3,  Business Day  reported, citing the regulator.  The state-owned airline grounded the flight because cabin
crew had not received fatigue-management training for the 16-
hour journey as required by the CAA, the Johannesburg-based
newspaper said, citing South African Airways.  To contact the reporter on this story:
