Edgar Bronfman Jr., chairman and chief
executive officer of  Warner Music Group Corp. (WMG) , bought a
Manhattan penthouse for $15.9 million after the price was
reduced by more than half from its original listing.  Bronfman and his wife, Clarissa, purchased the five-
bedroom, five-bathroom  triplex  at 812 Park Ave. in a deal
completed yesterday,  New York  City property records show. The
co-op apartment includes a maid’s room, sauna and wraparound
outdoor space on the third floor, according to property listings
website StreetEasy.com.  The property was listed for sale in November 2007 for $36.5
million, according to StreetEasy. Its price was cut at least
three times since then, dropping to $15.9 million in September.
The seller is listed as Gordon B. Pattee, city records show.  “The magical top floor is surrounded by a beautifully
planted terrace and lends itself to entertaining and quiet
enjoyment with its charming sitting room with fireplace and two
sets of French doors,” reads the listing by  Caroline Guthrie , a
broker with Brown Harris Stevens in New York.  Guthrie and Will Tanous, a spokesman for  Warner Music  and
for Bronfman, didn’t immediately respond to telephone messages
seeking comment.  Bronfman’s New York-based Warner Music Group put itself up
for sale in January. The board is meeting today to pick a buyer
among those who submitted a bid by this week’s deadline.
Bronfman, 54, owns about 7 percent of the company’s stock.  To contact the reporter on this story:
