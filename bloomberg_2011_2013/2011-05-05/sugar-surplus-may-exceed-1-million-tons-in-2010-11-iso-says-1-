Sugar production may exceed demand by
1 million metric tons in the 2010-11 season ending in September
on higher output in  Thailand  and India, the  International Sugar
Organization  said.  The ISO had estimated the surplus at 200,000 tons in
February. Thai output reached 9.6 million tons at the beginning
of May, up from 7.2 million tons a year earlier, it said in an
e-mailed report today. The country is the world’s second-largest
sugar exporter, and India ranks second among producers.  “An expected annual output of about 9.65 million tons, raw
value, represents a significant improvement over Thailand’s
previous production record of 8.06 million tons, raw value,
achieved in 2007-08,” it said.  Output in India climbed 24 percent to 22.6 million tons in
the first seven months of the 2010-11 season, the London-based
ISO said in the report.  Brazil  is the largest sugar producer and
exporter.  Raw sweetener has plunged 35 percent in New York trading
this year and white, or refined, sugar has dropped 25 percent in
London. “Global fundamentals have shifted from a perceived
deficit to a short-term surplus due to a larger-than-expected
Thai harvest,” Keith Flury, an analyst at Rabobank
International in London, said in a report today.  Hedge funds  cut their bullish bets on sugar futures to the
lowest in more than two years as supplies surged in Thailand,
data from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission showed
on April 29.  “The reported reduction in net long positions may be
treated as evidence of fading investors’ interest in sugar
futures on the back of expectations for further price easing,”
the ISO said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
