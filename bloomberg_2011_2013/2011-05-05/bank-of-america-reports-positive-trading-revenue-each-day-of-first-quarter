Bank of America Corp. (BAC) , the first of
the largest U.S. banks to disclose how many trading days yielded
gains in the first quarter, had a perfect record for the period.  Trading-related revenue was positive every day and exceeded
$25 million on 98 percent of days during the year’s first three
months, the Charlotte, North Carolina-based lender said today in
a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. In
2010, it had gains on 90 percent of trading days, with perfect
records in that year’s first and third quarters, according to
previous filings.  Bank of America, the largest U.S. lender by assets, had
$4.9 billion in sales and trading revenue in the quarter, which
outpaced that of  Citigroup Inc. (C)  and was 36 percent less than
that of  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  The global banking and markets
division, run by Thomas K. Montag, posted first-quarter net
income of $2.1 billion, higher than the overall company’s
earnings as mortgage losses cut profitability.  Trading value at risk, a measure of the average amount the
firm could lose on any given day, rose to $183.9 million in the
first quarter from $157.1 million in the fourth quarter, the
bank said. The firm had positive trading revenue on 79 percent
of trading days in the fourth quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
