U.S. nuclear-power production rose for
a third day as a reactor in  Florida  started and another in
Georgia shut, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission said.  Power generation nationwide increased 66 megawatts from
yesterday to 70,452 megawatts, or 69 percent of capacity,
according to an NRC report today and data compiled by Bloomberg.
Thirty of the nationâ€™s 104 reactors were offline.  NextEra Energy Inc. (NEE)  started the 839-megawatt Saint Lucie 2
reactor 45 miles (72 kilometers) north of Palm Beach, Florida.
The plant, shut for refueling and maintenance Jan. 3, is
operating at 8 percent of capacity.  The 839-megawatt Saint Lucie 1 is operating at full power.  Southern Co. (SO)  idled the 883-megawatt Edwin I. Hatch 2
reactor to repair a pump that circulates water to the core,
Alyson Fuqua, a plant spokeswoman, said in an e-mailed response
to questions. The unit was at 52 percent of capacity yesterday
after a refueling and maintenance outage from March 28 to May 2.  The 876-megawatt Hatch 1 is operating at full power. The
plant is about 74 miles west of Savannah.  Dominion Resources Inc. boosted output at the 884-megawatt
Millstone 2 to 100 percent of capacity from 66 percent
yesterday. The 1,227-megawatt Millstone 3 is at full power. The
plant is about 3 miles (5 kilometers) southwest of New London,
Connecticut.  Salem Output  Public Service Enterprise Group Inc. (PEG)  boosted the 1,174-
megawatt Salem 1 unit in  New Jersey  to 97 percent of capacity
from 88 percent yesterday. The reactor was shut April 21 after
water intake filters became clogged. Another unit at the site,
1,130-megawatt Salem 2, is closed. The plant is about 18 miles
south of Wilmington,  Delaware .  Dominion increased output from the 556-megawatt Kewaunee
reactor in Wisconsin to full power from 91 percent of capacity
yesterday. The reactor is about 27 miles southeast of Green Bay.  Some reactors are closed for maintenance and refueling
during the spring and fall in the U.S., when demand for heating
and cooling is lower. The outages can increase consumption of
natural gas and coal to generate electricity.  The average U.S. reactor  refueling outage  lasted 41 days in
2009, according to the  Nuclear Energy Institute .  To contact the reporter on this story:
