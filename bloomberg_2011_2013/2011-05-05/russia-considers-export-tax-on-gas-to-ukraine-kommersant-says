Russia may reintroduce export duty on
natural-gas exports to Ukraine, a move that could result in
Ukraine paying 30 percent more,  Kommersant  reported.  In an April 4 letter to Russian Prime Minister  Vladimir
Putin , Finance Minister Alexei Kudrin proposed increasing state
revenue by changing the countryâ€™s stance on export duties for
natural gas to some foreign countries, the newspaper said,
citing the letter.  Russia currently sells gas without export duty to Belarus,
to Ukraine and to Turkey, Kommersant said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
