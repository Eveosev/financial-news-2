AT&T Inc. (T)  Chief Executive Officer
Randall Stephenson is to testify at a May 11 congressional
hearing into the company’s proposed purchase of T-Mobile USA
Inc., according to a news release from the  U.S. Senate .  Sprint Nextel Corp. (S)  Chief Executive Officer Dan Hesse, an
opponent of the purchase, also is to testify, according to the
witness  list  distributed today by the Judiciary Committee.  AT&T on March 20 proposed buying  Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE) ’s T-
Mobile in a $39 billion deal, which would combine the second-and
fourth-largest carriers to create a new market leader, ahead of
No. 1 Verizon Wireless.  The deal needs approval from the Justice Department and
Federal Communications Commission.  The hearing, entitled “The AT&T/T-Mobile Merger: Is Humpty
Dumpty Being Put Back Together Again?” is before the
committee’s antitrust panel, which is chaired by Senator  Herb Kohl , a Wisconsin Democrat.  T-Mobile Chief Executive Officer Philipp Humm also is to
testify, according to the news release. The witness list also
included Gigi Sohn, founder of Washington-based Public
Knowledge, who has called the combination “unthinkable;” Larry Cohen, president of the Communications Workers of America, which
supports the deal; and Victor “Hu” Meena, chief executive
officer of Ridgeland, Mississippi-based wireless provider
Cellular South.  To contact the reporter on this story:
