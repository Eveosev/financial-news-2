Aspen Pharmacare Holdings Ltd. (APN) , the
largest maker of generic medicines in the southern hemisphere,
said profit and sales growth will remain “consistent” and its
next acquisition may be in  Latin America .  “There will be consistent growth at a turnover and
earnings level,” Stavros Nicolaou, Aspen’s senior executive in
charge of strategic trade, said in an interview at the World
Economic Forum on Africa in Cape Town today. Having bought a
unit of  Australia ’s of  Sigma Pharmaceuticals Ltd. (SIP)  for A$900
million ($961 million) last year, Aspen’s next purchase “might
well be” in Latin America, he said.  Aspen, which supplies drugs in 100 countries, is targeting
expansion in emerging markets to boost earnings. In March, the
company reported that net income surged to 1.15 billion rand
($171 million) in the six months through December, from 883
million rand a year earlier.  While Aspen’s original bid to buy all of Sigma failed,
Nicolaou said this was “a blessing in disguise,” adding that
it now has distribution arrangements with Sigma’s retail
business, which Aspen doesn’t own.  “We wouldn’t go back and look at the rest of Sigma,” he
said. “You don’t need to own the cow to get the milk.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
