Lars Feld, a member of German
Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s council of economic advisers, said he
expects the European Central Bank to raise borrowing costs twice
more this year.  While the Frankfurt-based ECB took a “very good step” in
increasing the benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points to
1.25 percent last month, “it’s better for the ECB to wait until
summer” to raise borrowing costs further, Feld told  Andrea Catherwood  on Bloomberg Television’s “Last Word” today. He
forecast borrowing costs to reach 1.75 percent by year-end.  ECB President  Jean-Claude Trichet  signaled today that the
bank will keep its benchmark on hold through June, saying that
policy makers will monitor inflation risks “very closely.”
While surging oil costs have fueled price pressures across the
17-member euro region, tougher austerity measures in countries
from Ireland to  Spain  are clouding the growth outlook.  A restructuring of Greek debt “as early as this year would
be useful” as it’s “almost impossible” for the country to
achieve fiscal consolidation, Feld said. Ireland would likely
seek to renegotiate its bailout terms if Portugal received a
lower interest rate on its aid package, he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
