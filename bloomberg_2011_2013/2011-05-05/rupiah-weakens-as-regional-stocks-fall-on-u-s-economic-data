Indonesia ’s rupiah fell the most in
more than a week as signs the U.S. economic recovery is stalling
drove regional stocks lower. Benchmark bonds gained.  The MSCI Asia-Pacific Index of regional shares dropped for
a third day after  service industries  in the U.S. expanded at the
slowest pace in eight months in April, while employment rose by
the least in five months. Indonesia’s economic growth slowed to
6.46 percent in the first quarter from 6.89 percent in the
previous three months, the Central Bureau of Statistics said
today.  “Asian stocks are down and regional currencies are weaker
today after disappointing news from the U.S. last night,”  Gundy Cahyadi , a Singapore-based economist at Oversea-Chinese Banking
Corp, said. “The rupiah’s weakening is driven by external
factors.”  The rupiah declined 0.4 percent, the most since April 26,
to 8,583 per dollar as of 4:55 p.m. in Jakarta, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ten-year  government bonds  rose, snapping a three-day drop.
The yield on the 8.25 percent note due July 2021 fell seven
basis points to 7.71 percent, according to closing prices from
the Inter-Dealer Market Association.  To contact the reporter on this story:
