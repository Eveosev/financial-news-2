Ghana  will use a stable exchange rate
and tight monetary policy to ease the impact of rising global
prices, Finance Minister  Kwabena Duffuor  said.  The West African nation’s central bank will manage revenue
earned from oil, which  Ghana  began producing for export last
year, in order to maintain stable currency rates, Duffuor told a
conference in Accra, the capital, today.  “Exchange rates and interest-rate policies will continue to
be used in containing inflation,” he said. “Ghana has been
enjoying relatively stable exchange rates for some time now and
this is helping in the fight against inflation.”  Inflation is likely to average around 9 percent through
2011, Ernest Addison, head of research at the central bank said.
“There is no indication that inflation will accelerate any time
soon,” he told the conference.  The rate slowed for the first time in three months in March
to 9.1 percent, as the effects of a 30 percent increase in
gasoline prices in January eased. The cedi has weakened 1.4
percent against the dollar this year.  The central bank kept  interest rates  unchanged for the
third consecutive meeting on Feb. 18. The central bank will
likely maintain the rate again at its next meeting on May 13,
Yvonne Mhango, a sub-Saharan African economist at  Renaissance
Capital , said in an e-mailed note April 13.  Ghana earned $112.2 million from the first lifting of
995,259 barrels of crude from the Jubilee oil field by the
state-owned  oil company  on March 9, the Ministry of Finance said
in an e-mailed statement yesterday.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
