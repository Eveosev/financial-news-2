Middle East oil for sale to  Asia  fell
for a second day on signs that regional middle-distillate
supplies were rising, stoking speculation refinery demand for
crude may decline.  Oman oil for immediate loading fell $1.74, or 1.5 percent,
to $114.96 a barrel, according to Bloomberg data. Dubai for
loading in June dropped 1.7 percent to $114.53 and Murban crude
declined 0.9 percent to $119.37.  Middle East crude has been supported by a surge in refining
profits for middle distillates, including gasoil and kerosene.
Gasoil’s premium to Dubai crude was at $20.10 a barrel, about
twice as much as a year ago, according to data from PVM Oil
Associates Ltd., a London-based brokerage.  Supplies of middle distillates in  Singapore , Asia’s biggest
oil-trading center, surged 29 percent, the most since Jan. 23,
2008, to 12.2 million barrels in the week ended yesterday, data
from International Enterprise Singapore showed today.  The Brent-Dubai exchange for swaps for June widened 11
cents to $6.68 a barrel, PVM data showed. The exchange for swaps
for July rose 14 cents to $6.76 a barrel.  Oman futures for July delivery fell 55 cents to $114.58 a
barrel on the  Dubai Mercantile Exchange  at 5:13 p.m. Singapore
time, with 1,055 contracts traded. The settlement price was at
$115.38 at 12:30 p.m. in Dubai.  To contact the reporter on this story:
