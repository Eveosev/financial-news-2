it is monitoring flooding on the lower  Mississippi River  to
ensure the integrity of levees and other flood works.  The around-the-clock monitoring includes field crews
checking the levees for any signs of seepage, swelling or
scouring, the Corps said today in an e-mailed statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
