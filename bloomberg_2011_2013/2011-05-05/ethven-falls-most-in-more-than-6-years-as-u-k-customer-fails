Methven Ltd. (MVN) , a New Zealand
distributor of taps and showerheads, fell the most in more than
six years in Wellington trading after its largest customer in
the U.K. moved to appoint external managers.  Crewe-based Focus (DIY) Ltd. is filing a notice of
intention to appoint administrators and owes Methven N$1.5
million ($1.2 million), the Auckland-based company said in a
statement to the stock exchange. The stock fell 10 percent, the
biggest slump since December 2004.  Methven is unable to quantify the full effect of the Focus
situation as there are many implications to consider regarding
retention of title agreement, inventory provisions, impairment
of U.K. customer relations and other operating matters, it said.
Focus is appointing administrators to protect the interests of
creditors after it defaulted on a senior credit facility,
according to a statement on the companyâ€™s website.  Methven fell 16 cents to NZ$1.40 at 2 p.m. in Wellington
trading.  To contact the reporter on this story:
