France ’s sugar-beet crop, the world’s
biggest, is developing at a faster-than-average pace after warm
April temperatures boosted growth, crop researcher Institut
Technique de la Betterave said.  Plant development is about 10 days ahead of the five-year
average, allowing for a potential yield gain of 10 percent, the
Paris-based ITB said on its  website . The sugar-beet crop so far
has suffered “little” from a lack of rain, the researcher
said.  France had its second-hottest April since 1900 and one of
the driest since 1953, the Agriculture Ministry said in an
online report. Temperatures across France averaged 14.5 degrees
Celsius (58 Fahrenheit) last month, 3.8 degrees above normal.  “Being well established, the sugar beets have suffered
only a little from the lack of water and have benefited from the
elevated temperatures,” the institute said. “The high April
temperatures have accelerated the development of the beets.”  On average, France’s beet-growing regions received 14.5
millimeters (0.57 inch) of rain in April, bringing the
precipitation deficit since the start of the year to 96
millimeters, ITB said.  France is the world’s largest sugar-beet producer, ahead of
 Russia  and the U.S., according to the  United Nations ’  Food and
Agriculture Organization . The European country produced 31.7
million metric tons of sugar beets last year, according to
Eurostat data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
