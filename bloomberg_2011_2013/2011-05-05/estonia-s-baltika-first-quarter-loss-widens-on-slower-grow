AS Baltika, the third-largest Baltic
clothing retailer, posted a wider first-quarter loss as revenue
growth slowed more than expected in March, Ukraine’s currency
weakened and the company reported one-time costs.  The net loss widened to 2.4 million euros ($3.5 million)
from 2 million euros a year earlier, the Tallinn, Estonia-based
company said today in a regulatory statement. Revenue rose 6.6
percent to 11.7 million euros.  “Considerably smaller sales of high-margin products, the
weakening of the Ukrainian hryvnia against the euro and some
non-recurring expenses of around 160,000 euros caused a result
that was atypically poor for March, remaining 500,000 euros
below target,” Baltika said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
