The euro dropped the most against the
dollar in eight months as the  European Central Bank  signaled it
may not raise  interest rates  next month, while currencies of
commodity exporters plunged as raw-materials prices tumbled the
most in two years.  Japan’s currency climbed versus all of its 16 most-traded
peers and reached the strongest level in six weeks against the
dollar as falling commodities prompted investors to unwind bets
in higher-yielding assets financed with yen. Norway’s krone was
the worst-performing major currency, dropping the most in a year
against the greenback.  “Some of the other markets started to move pretty
aggressively,” said Robert Sinche, global head of currency
strategy at Royal Bank of Scotland Plc in  Stamford ,  Connecticut .
“This is a significant liquidation of things that have performed
very well in the last couple of months. A lot of this is
outright liquidation of positions.”  Europe ’s shared currency tumbled 1.9 percent to $1.4539 at
5 p.m. in New York, and sank as much as 2.1 percent, the biggest
intraday drop since August 2010. The euro reached a 17-month
high of $1.4940 yesterday. It slid 2.6 percent today to 116.44
yen. The Japanese currency gained 0.7 percent to 80.07 per
dollar and touched 79.57.  Commodities dropped amid concern economic growth will slow
as central banks seek to cool inflation by raising borrowing
costs. The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Index of 24 raw materials fell
as much as 6.9 percent to 681.28, the biggest decline since June
2009. Crude oil for June delivery fell below $100 a barrel in
 New York  for the first time since March 17.  Krone Drops  The Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of raw materials
sank as much as 5 percent to 340.83, the lowest level since
March 16.  Norway’s krone dropped as much as 3 percent, the biggest
intraday decline since May 2010, to 5.4806 per dollar, while the
Canadian dollar weakened 0.8 percent to 96.69 cents per
greenback. Both nations export oil.  Australia ’s currency fell
1.6 percent to $1.0580 and touched $1.0537, the lowest level
since April 20.  “The markets are a little weary that we’re starting to see
the effect of higher  oil prices  biting into real economic
data,” said  Alan Ruskin , global head of Group-of-10 foreign-
exchange strategy at Deutsche Bank AG in New York. “That is
really being compounded by extensive long-risk positions which
have now been squeezed.” Long positions are bets that
securities, here higher-yielding assets, will gain.  ECB Policy Makers  European policy makers left their main refinancing rate
unchanged after boosting it a quarter-percentage point in April
to 1.25 percent. ECB President  Jean-Claude Trichet , at a news
conference in Helsinki, refrained from using the phrase “strong
vigilance,” which might have signaled a June rate increase. He
instead said inflation risks will be watched “very closely.”  Futures traders’ bets the euro would gain versus the dollar
rose to the most since December 2007 last week amid speculation
the ECB would signal a rate boost in June, data from the
Washington-based Commodity Futures Trading Commission showed.  The difference in the number of wagers by  hedge funds  and
other large speculators on an advance in the euro compared with
those on a drop -- so-called net longs -- was 68,279 on April
26, compared with net longs of 62,195 a week earlier.  The yen fell below 80 per dollar for the first time since
Group of Seven central banks intervened to weaken the currency
on March 18 after  Japan ’s worst earthquake. It had surged to a
post-World War II high of 76.25 per dollar the previous day amid
speculation Japanese investors would repatriate assets to pay
for reconstruction.  Carry Trades  Carry trades in which investors borrow in Japan, where
interest rates are almost zero, and purchase the higher-yielding
Australian, Brazilian, Canadian and Norwegian currencies have
returned 14 percent this year through today, compared with a
gain of 36 percent through April 15, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  The  Federal Reserve ’s zero to 0.25 percent benchmark
interest rate also makes the dollar popular for funding carry-
trade transactions.  Japanese Finance MinisterYoshihiko Noda said today’s rise
in the yen is different from the gain in March that prompted
intervention. Central banks intervene in foreign-exchange
markets by selling or buying currencies to influence prices.  “This is in the context of recent declines in the dollar
-- and Japan’s market is closed,” Noda told reporters in Hanoi.  “I won’t comment on a hypothetical situation,” Noda said
when asked whether Japan will intervene if yen gains continue.  Pound Declines  The pound slipped versus the dollar after the  Bank of
England  kept its key rate at a record low 0.5 percent. Signs the
economic recovery is losing momentum kept a majority of policy
makers focused on stimulating growth.  Sterling fell 0.6 percent to $1.6392 and lost 1.3 percent
to 131.24 yen.  The dollar strengthened from almost a three-year low even
as claims for  unemployment benefits  jumped last week,
encouraging the Fed to keep borrowing costs low.  IntercontinentalExchange Inc.’s Dollar Index, used to track
the greenback against the currencies of six major trade partners
including the euro and yen, rose 1.4 percent to 74.086. It
touched 72.696 yesterday, the lowest level since July 2008.  Applications for jobless benefits jumped by 43,000 to
474,000 in the week ended April 30, the most since August, Labor
Department figures showed today.  U.S. employers added 185,000 jobs in April after a 216,000
increase in March, the median estimate of 86 economists in a
Bloomberg survey forecast before data due tomorrow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
