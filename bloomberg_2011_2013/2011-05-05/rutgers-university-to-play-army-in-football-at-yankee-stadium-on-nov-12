Rutgers University â€™s football team
will play Army at Yankee Stadium on Nov. 12.  The U.S. Military Academy played the first college game at
the new stadium last year, when the Cadets lost to  Notre Dame .
They will be the home team for the game against Rutgers.  Rutgers played nine times in the original Yankee Stadium,
most recently in 1948, all against  New York University .  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
