Glencore International AG, the
commodities company seeking $11 billion in an initial public
offering, may seek to merge with  Xstrata Plc (XTA)  within 11 months of
the IPO, Sanford C. Bernstein Ltd. said today in a report.  “We continue to believe that Glencore will look to merge
with Xstrata via a zero-premium merger within the next first 11
months once we pass two reporting periods for Glencore and have
a decent share-price track record,” Bernstein said.  Glencore already owns about 34 percent of Xstrata.  To contact the reporter on this story:
