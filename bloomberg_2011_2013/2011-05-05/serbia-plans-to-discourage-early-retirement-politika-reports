Serbia will probably adjust its
pension system to further discourage people from retiring early,
 Politika  newspaper reported, citing Gordana Matkovic, an adviser
to President  Boris Tadic  and a former labor minister.  Serbia needs to reduce budget spending on pensions to below
10 percent of gross domestic product from around 12 percent, the
report quoted Matkovic as saying.  Under a new formula, pensions should be much lower for
those whose contributions to the dominant, state pension fund
last less than the legally required 40 years for men and 35
years for women, the report said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
