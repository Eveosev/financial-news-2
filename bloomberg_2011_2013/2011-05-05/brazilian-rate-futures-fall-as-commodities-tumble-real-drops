Yields on Brazilian interest-rate
futures contracts declined as falling commodity prices fueled
speculation inflation will moderate in  Latin America ’s biggest
economy.  Yields on the futures contract due in January 2013 fell 5
basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 12.64 percent at 5
p.m. in New York. The contract due in January 2014 retreated 8
basis points to 12.59 percent.  Yields fell as commodities including sugar, oil and soy
tumbled, prompting speculation  Brazil ’s economic expansion may
slow and fueling bets that the central bank will have to raise
 interest rates  less to contain inflation. The Standard & Poor’s
GSCI Index of 24 raw materials fell 6.5 percent and declined for
a fourth straight day, its longest losing streak since mid-
March. Crude oil for June delivery fell 8.6 percent to $99.80 a
barrel, the lowest settlement on the  New York  Mercantile
Exchange since March 16.  “There are doubts about global growth and commodities are
falling,” said Eduardo Alves de Castro, superintendent of asset
management at Santander Asset Management in  Sao Paulo .
“Commodities have had a relevant role in inflation.”  The national statistics agency will say tomorrow that
inflation in Brazil quickened to 6.58 percent in the 12 months
through April, according to the median estimate of 31 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg. The central bank targets inflation of 4.5
percent, plus or minus two percentage points.  The real fell 0.2 percent to 1.6220 per dollar, from 1.6182
yesterday. The currency’s 1.9 percent drop yesterday was the
biggest daily decline since June 4.  The central bank said it twice bought dollars in the  spot
market  today, first at 1.6167 and then at 1.6235 each. The
purchases are part of an effort by policy makers to curb the
currency’s two-year 32 percent rally.  To contact the reporters on this story:
