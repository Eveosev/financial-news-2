Nestle SA (NESN) , the world’s biggest food
company, said it will partner with the  World Economic Forum  and
 South Africa  to help  Africa ’s biggest economy avert a 17 percent
gap between water demand and supply by 2030.  “This new partnership between the government of South
Africa and the Water Resources Group will help identify how
South Africa’s plans for growth can be met with the water it has
safely available,” Peter Brabeck-Letmathe, Chairman of Nestle
and of the World Economic Forum’s Water Resources Group, said in
a statement released in Cape Town today at the World Economic
Forum on Africa.  The South African partnership will focus on water
conservation and demand management, diversifying the water mix,
and developing more sustainable management of groundwater
resources, in particular for rural areas, the statement said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
