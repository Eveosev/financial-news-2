China , the world’s biggest producer of
rare earths, may further reduce its export quotas, pushing
prices for the minerals higher, Goldman Sachs & Partners
Australia Pty said in a report.  “We suspect that export quotas will shrink further,”
because of rising demand within China, analysts led by Malcolm Southwood said yesterday in a report. The quota in the first
half this year was set at 14,446 metric tons, down from 22,282
tons a year earlier, he said. Recent trends suggest that the
second half quota, 7,986 tons last year, will show a further
decline, he said.  China has been curbing domestic output growth and exports
of rare earths and minor metals to conserve resources and
protect the environment, tightening global supplies and
prompting users such as  Japan  to seek alternative sources. The
market will remain in “severe” deficit this year and next,
moving into balance in 2013, Southwood said.  “We are of the view that rare earth prices have not yet
peaked” and may decline from 2013 to 2015, he said.  China accounts for 95 percent of global output of rare
earths, 17 chemically similar metals used in hybrid cars and
wind turbines.  To contact the reporter on this story:
