Capital & Counties Properties Plc (CAPC) , the
London company formed in last year’s breakup of Liberty
International, announced a share sale to fund acquisitions and
renovate properties in Covent Garden.  CapCo will sell 62.1 million new shares, equivalent to
almost 10 percent of its outstanding stock, the company said
today in a statement, without indicating a price. If the shares
were sold at the current price, CapCo would raise about 100
million pounds ($165 million).  The proceeds from the share sale will accelerate CapCo’s
efforts to reposition  Covent Garden , the former market place for
fruit and vegetables, in London’s West End district. The company
attracted 36 new and higher-paying tenants to Covent Garden last
year, including Apple Inc., helping lift the appraised value of
its properties there by 14 percent to 640 million pounds.  Acquisitions and projects at Covent Garden “will
accelerate CapCo’s strategy to create a contemporary luxury
destination,” lifting rents and property values, the company
said in the statement.  CapCo declined 7.4 pence, or 4.3 percent, to 164.2 pence at
9:27 a.m. in  London  trading. That lowered the value of the
company to 1 billion pounds. The shares have advanced 17 percent
in the past three months, exceeding the 10 percent gain for the
FTSE 350 Real Estate Investment Trust Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
