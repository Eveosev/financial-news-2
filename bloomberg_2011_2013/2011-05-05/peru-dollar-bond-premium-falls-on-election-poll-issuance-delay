Peru ’s dollar bonds rose, pushing down
the average yield gap over U.S. Treasuries to a three-week low,
after a presidential poll showed support waning for ex-army
officer  Ollanta Humala , and the government shelved plans to
issue bonds.  The extra yield investors demand to own Peruvian  government
bonds  instead of U.S. Treasuries fell 5 basis points, or 0.05
percentage point, to 194 at 2:08 p.m. New York time, according
to JPMorgan Chase & Co. That’s the lowest since April 14.  Humala, who pledges to boost the role of the state in the
economy if elected, had a 1 percentage point lead over
Congresswoman Keiko Fujimori in a poll taken April 23-30 by
Lima-based  Ipsos Apoyo , down from 6 percentage points in an
April 16-21 survey.  Peru’s Finance Minister Ismael Benavides said in a May 3
interview the government has shelved plans to sell as much as
$1.2 billion of bonds after yields on the nation’s sol-
denominated debt jumped to a two-year high on concern Humala may
win next month’s runoff vote.  “The government saying they’re not going to sell as much
debt due to higher yields benefits existing bonds,” said
Kathryn Rooney Vera, an emerging markets analyst at Bulltick
Capital Markets in Miami. “The poll showed some momentum behind
Keiko Fujimori going into the June 5 elections. She’s not viewed
as such a wildcard as Humala,” she said.  The sol gained 0.3 percent to 2.8114 per  U.S. dollar , from
2.8195 yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
