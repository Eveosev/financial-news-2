Japanese bonds rose the most in seven
weeks as stocks slumped before a U.S. report that economists
said will show job growth slowed in April.  Ten-year yields declined to a four-month low as  Japan ’s
markets reopened after three holidays amid concern a stronger
yen will hurt exporters and derail the economic recovery. The
extra yield offered by 10-year Treasuries over similar-maturity
Japanese bonds shrank to the narrowest this year, increasing the
allure of yen-denominated debt.  “We’ll enter a period of pessimism about the  U.S. economy 
for the next six months, and the job report will signal its
beginning,” said Daisuke Uno, chief strategist in  Tokyo  at
Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp., which manages the equivalent of
$875 billion in deposits. “Yields are likely to remain low.”  The 10-year yield fell six basis points to 1.14 percent as
of 3:28 p.m. in Tokyo at Japan Bond Trading Co., the nation’s
largest interdealer debt broker. The 1.3 percent security due
March 2021 added 0.537 yen to 101.418 yen. The yield fell the
most since March 15 to the lowest since Jan. 5.  Five-year yields declined 3.5 basis points to 0.42 percent.
Ten-year futures for June delivery jumped 0.65 to 140.75 at the
afternoon close on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. The  Nikkei 225 (NKY) 
Stock Average slumped 1.5 percent.  Japan’s bonds with a maturity of between one and 10 years
have returned 0.1 percent this year, according to an index
compiled by Bank of America Merrill Lynch. That compares with a
3.6 percent drop in the Nikkei 225.  ‘Flow of Funds’  “ Risk aversion  is causing a flow of funds to bonds,” said
Kazuya Ito, a  fund manager  in Tokyo at Daiwa SB Investments Ltd.,
which manages the equivalent of $57 billion.  U.S. employers added 185,000 workers in April after hiring
216,000 the previous month, according to a Bloomberg News survey
of economists before today’s Labor Department report.  The difference in yield between 10-year Treasuries and
similar-dated Japanese bonds shrank to 1.94 percentage points
yesterday, the narrowest since Dec. 9. Treasury yields dropped
yesterday as a report showed the number of Americans filing for
jobless benefits rose last week to the most since August.  The yen appreciated to 79.57 per dollar yesterday, rising
beyond 80 for the first time since March 18, the day after it
touched a postwar record of 76.25. A stronger local currency
reduces the value of overseas sales at Japanese exporters when
repatriated. The yen traded at 80.54 today.  Increased Bets  Bonds also rose amid speculation the  Bank of Japan  will
ease monetary policy further to bolster the nation’s recovery
from its record earthquake in March.  Kazuhiko Sano, chief strategist at Tokai Tokyo Securities
Co., said it was increasingly likely the central bank will buy
more assets after Deputy Governor Kiyohiko Nishimura proposed
expanding the asset-purchase program last month. The measure was
voted down by the other eight members.  “For 10-year yields to fall below 1 percent, additional
monetary easing, namely increased buying of  government bonds , is
necessary,” Sano wrote today in a report. “Before the April 28
policy meeting, I saw a chance of about 50 percent for such a
measure,” and the odds are now 70 to 80 percent, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
