Oceanic Bank International Plc (OCEANIC) , a
Nigerian lender bailed out two years ago, rose for a fourth day
after the  central bank  said it isn’t “desperate to sell” it
following the collapse of talks for First Bank of  Nigeria  to
recapitalize the lender.  The stock gained 8 kobo, or 4.5 percent, to 1.87 naira by
12:30 p.m. in Lagos. A close at this price will be its highest
since April 19.  The  Central Bank of Nigeria  may recapitalize Oceanic Bank
through the Asset Management Corp. of Nigeria, the state-owned
company set up by the central bank to buy bad debts from
lenders, Governor Lamido Sanusi said in an interview with CNBC
Africa today.  Oceanic has fallen 25 percent this year compared with a 3.1
percent increase in the Nigerian Stock Exchange All-Share Index
over the same period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
