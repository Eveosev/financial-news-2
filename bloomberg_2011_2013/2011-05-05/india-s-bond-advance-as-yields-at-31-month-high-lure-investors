India ’s government bonds gained,
snapping a six-day decline, on speculation the highest yields in
31 months will attract buyers.  Yields advanced to as high 8.31 percent today, the highest
level for a 10-year bond since October 2008, on speculation the
central bank will quicken the pace of rate increases to damp
inflation. The  Reserve Bank of India  lifted the repurchase rate
by 0.5 percentage point to 7.25 percent on May 3, the ninth
increase since the beginning of last year.  “Ten-year yields above 8.25 percent are a good opportunity
for long-term investors to buy,” said J. Moses Harding, a
Mumbai-based executive vice-president at IndusInd Bank Ltd.
“The  bond market , at current levels, has mostly priced in the
outlook for inflation and rates.”  The yield on the 7.80 percent note due April 2021 fell two
basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 8.26 percent as of
the 5 p.m. close in Mumbai, according to the central bank’s
trading system.  Inflation may stay around 9 percent until September because
of higher fuel prices, the central bank said in a May 3
statement. India’s benchmark wholesale price index rose 8.98
percent in March from a year earlier, exceeding the  Reserve Bank 
of India’s 8 percent estimate.  Food inflation slowed to a three-week low as supplies from
the winter harvest increased. An index measuring wholesale
prices of agricultural products rose 8.53 percent in the week
ended April 23 from a year earlier, the commerce ministry said
in a statement today. It gained 8.76 in the previous week.  The cost of one-year interest-rate, or derivative contracts
used to guard against fluctuations in borrowing costs, declined
four basis points to 8.09 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
