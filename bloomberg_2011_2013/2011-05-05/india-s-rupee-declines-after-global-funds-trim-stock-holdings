India ’s rupee fell to a four-week low
after overseas investors stepped up sales of local shares on
concern rising  interest rates  will damp economic growth.  The currency dropped the most in more than three weeks as
the  Reserve Bank  of India lifted its repurchase rate by 50 basis
points, or 0.5 percentage point, to 7.25 percent on May 3 to
cool inflation. Global funds cut holdings of Indian equities by
$282 million that day, the most in more than a week, as the
central bank said economic expansion may slow to “around 8
percent” in the financial year that began April 1 from an
estimated 8.6 percent in the previous 12 months.  “The financial market isn’t taking the faster interest-
rate increases too well because that’s probably going to have an
unfavorable impact on growth,” said  Roy Paul , deputy general
manager at Federal Bank Ltd. in Mumbai. “The rupee is under
some pressure because there are outflows from equities.”  The rupee retreated 0.7 percent to 44.76 per dollar at the
5 p.m. close in Mumbai, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
That is the biggest decline since April 11. The currency touched
44.77 earlier, the weakest level since April 7. The rupee has
lost 1.2 percent this week, the third-worst performance among
Asia’s 10 most-traded currencies.  India’s industrial growth averaged 3.8 percent in the first
two months of 2011, compared with 16 percent in the same period
of 2010, the latest government data show. Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. and Credit Suisse Group AG cut growth forecasts for  Asia ’s
third-biggest economy last month, citing the impact of higher
interest rates.  Offshore forwards indicate the rupee will trade at 45.51 to
the dollar in three months, compared with expectations of 45.24
yesterday. Forwards are agreements to buy or sell assets at a
set price and date. Non-deliverable contracts are settled in
dollars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
