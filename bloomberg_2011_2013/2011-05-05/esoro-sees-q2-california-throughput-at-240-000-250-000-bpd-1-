Tesoro Corp. (TSO)  expects its  California 
refineries’ throughput to average 240,000 to 250,000 barrels a
day, or 91 percent to 95 percent of capacity, in the second
quarter, a company  presentation  showed.  The San Antonio-based company is planning work at its
Martinez refinery in California during the second quarter, G.
Scott Spendlove, a vice president, said during a company
conference call. The work was originally planned for the first
quarter.  Combined throughput at Tesoro’s Utah and North Dakota
refineries is expected to average 110,000 to 120,000 barrels a
day in the second quarter, according to the presentation. Each
refinery has a capacity of 58,000 barrels a day, according to
the company’s website.  Tesoro is planning to expand crude processing capacity at
the Mandan refinery in  North Dakota  by 10,000 barrels by the
second quarter of 2012, the company announced in March.  The company’s Hawaii refinery crude processing is expected
to average 65,000 to 75,000 barrels a day in the second quarter.
Capacity is 94,000.  Tesoro’s Alaska and Washington state refineries will
average 160,000 to 170,000 barrels a day in the second quarter,
according to the presentation. That’s 81 percent to 86 percent
of capacity.  To contact the reporter on this story:
