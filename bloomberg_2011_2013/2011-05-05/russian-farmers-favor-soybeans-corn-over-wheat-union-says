Russian farmers are favoring soybean,
corn and sunflower planting this year at the expense of wheat
and barley, said Alexander Korbut, vice president of  Russia’s
Grain Union .  Spring grains, traditionally classified as barley and
wheat, accounted for 58 percent of all plantings as of today,
down from 65 percent a year ago, Korbut said by phone.  “We will have a good growth of sunflower sowing,” he
said. While the Agriculture Ministry forecast a drop in
sunflower planting of 600,000 hectares (1.5 million acres) from
a year earlier, “we do not consider this will take place” and
seeding will at least equal last year’s figure, Korbut said.  Sunflowers were planted on 7.15 million hectares last year,
according to Moscow-based researcher SovEcon.  Russian farms sowed 4.7 million hectares with spring grains
as of May 4, or 16 percent of the planned area, the ministry
said today.  The country’s total grain crop may come to between 82
million and 86 million metric tons, with barley potentially
making up 15 million to 16 million tons, under a “moderately
optimistic” scenario, Korbut said. He declined to give an
estimate for the wheat harvest.  To contact the reporter on this story:
