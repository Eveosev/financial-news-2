Yields from hard-red winter wheat
fields in central and eastern  Kansas  may be larger than last
year, based on random samples taken in three counties today by
participants in the annual Wheat Quality Council crop tour.  Yields may average 51.8 bushels an acre, based on
observations from eight fields collected in the morning on the
third day of the tour, by participants traveling in three
separate groups. In 2010, the estimated yield in the areas
surveyed on the third day was 46.4 bushels, based on 27
observations, council data show.  Today, samples ranged from 77.1 bushels per acre in a field
in Marion County, to 44.5 bushels in a location in Chase County.
In the two previous days, the tour estimated yields in central
and western Kansas at 36.7 bushels, based on findings in 531
fields. That was the lowest for that area since 2004, and
compares with 40.3 bushels last year on 428 fields.  “This crop in the east part of the state is better, and
that’s normal,” said Ben Handcock, the executive vice president
of the Wheat Quality Council. “It’s a higher rainfall area.
Even though it’s short of rain here, they apparently had more
than they did out west.”  The tour will end today in  Kansas City .  To contact the reporter on this story:
