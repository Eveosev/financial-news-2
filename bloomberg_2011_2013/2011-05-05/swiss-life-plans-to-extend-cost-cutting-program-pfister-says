Swiss Life Holding AG (SLHN) ,  Switzerland ’s
biggest life insurer, plans to extend a program to cut costs by
as much as 400 million Swiss francs ($466 million) by next year.  The “medium and long-term” plan is to replace the
Milestone program that ends in 2012, Chief Executive Officer
Bruno Pfister told shareholders at the company’s annual general
meeting in Zurich today.  Swiss Life, which reported a 13 percent decline in first-
quarter premiums on May 3, has completed 90 percent of its
current program, which includes cutting 520 jobs in Switzerland.
Pfister reiterated Swiss Life’s return-on-equity and new
business margin targets and said the company is “confident”
that it will achieve a positive investment return this year.  The Zurich-based insurer’s net investment return was 1
percent in the first quarter, and Chief Financial Officer Thomas Buess said on May 3 that he expects to achieve the full-year
target of 3.4 percent to 3.6 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
