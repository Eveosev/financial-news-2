Mozambique’s agricultural development
strategy, approved by the government this week, may halt the
need for food imports within five years, Agencia de Informacao
de Mocambique said, citing Agriculture Minister Jose Pacheco.  Improved mechanization and other technologies and increased
financing will boost output, Pacheco said, according to the
Maputo-based  news agency .  Mozambique currently imports 650,000 metric tons of rice
per year to meet local demand, according to figures from the
Ministry of Agriculture’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
