Petroplus Holdings AG,  Europe ’s
largest independent oil refiner, will restart units at its Petit
Couronne refinery in  France  by mid-May, Chief Executive Officer
Jean-Paul Vettier said.  The plant’s fluid catalytic cracker and crude distillation
units were shut for maintenance in March, Vettier said today on
a conference call. The refinery can process 161,800 barrels of
oil a day, according to the company’s  website .  “While planned turnaround activities were already
occurring at Petit Couronne, we took the opportunity of a low-
margin environment to shut down the entire fuels complex in
March to perform some additional maintenance,” Vettier said.  The FCC unit, which is used in gasoline production, was
originally planned to undergo works in March.  To contact the reporter on this story:
