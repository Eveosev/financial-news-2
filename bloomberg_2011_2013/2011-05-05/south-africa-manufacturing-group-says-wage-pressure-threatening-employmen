South Africa ’s Manufacturing Circle,
an industry lobby group, said pressure from labor unions for

restrict growth in employment.  A strong rand, lower exports and a rise in imports has led
to “dangerously low” margins for manufacturers, the group said
in an e-mailed statement today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
