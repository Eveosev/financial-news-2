Troops loyal to  Ivory Coast  President
 Alassane Ouattara  gained control of a northern suburb of the
commercial capital, Abidjan, after fighting left “dozens” of
people dead, a military spokesman said.  “Yopougon has been liberated,” Leon Kouakou Alla,
spokesman of the Republican Forces, said in a statement made on
May 4 and was published today on the website www.abidjan.net.  The Republican Forces launched the offensive in Yopougon,
where about a quarter of the city’s 4 million residents live, on
May 3 to flush out militias loyal to ex-president  Laurent Gbagbo . The former leader was captured by Ouattara’s forces on
April 11 after a four-month impasse triggered by disputed
elections in November.  Alla said his troops had found “several dozen bodies of
women, men and children” as well as a mass grave near the
city’s naval base after pro-Gbagbo fighters fled the area
yesterday. He did not specify how many people had been killed.  Residents reported hearing heavy artillery explosions until
11 a.m. yesterday. Militias looted shops and houses as they
fled, said resident Moussa Tanoh by phone today.  “They terrorized the area for weeks,” Tanoh said. “They
fired at everything that moved. There are many bodies.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
