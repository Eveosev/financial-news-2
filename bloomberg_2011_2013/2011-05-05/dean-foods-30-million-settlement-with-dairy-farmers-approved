Dean Foods Co. (DF) , the biggest U.S. milk-
products maker, won approval from a federal judge for a $30
million settlement with about 10,000 dairy farmers.  U.S. District Judge Christina Reiss approved the accord
resolving an antitrust lawsuit, according to papers filed
yesterday in federal court in Burlington, Vermont. Under the
settlement, Dallas-based Dean Foods agreed to pay $30 million in
damages and buy milk from producers in the U.S. Northeast.  Dean Foods and the Dairy Farmers of America cooperative
were sued in 2009 by a rival group of farmers and accused of
operating a monopoly in the Northeast. Farmers received lower
prices because Dean bought milk exclusively from the cooperative
and its affiliates, according to the complaint.  The case is Allen v. Dairy Farmers of America Inc., 5:09-
cv-00230, U.S. District Court, District of  Vermont  (Burlington).
