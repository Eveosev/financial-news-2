MTN Group Ltd. (MTN) , Africa’s largest
mobile-phone company, said its Areeba unit is in talks with
 Guinea ’s government after its assets and staff were seized.  “Areeba is negotiating in good faith with the government
of Guinea,”  Rich Mkhondo , spokesman for Johannesburg-based MTN,
said in an e-mailed response to questions today. “We are
confident that both parties will reach an amicable solution that
will be in the best interest of all the stakeholders affected,
including the millions of MTN subscribers in Guinea.” Areeba’s
network continues to carry calls even as the company’s license
has been suspended, Mkhondo said in a separate phone call today.  Guinea’s communications minister, Oye Guilavogui, ordered
Areeba to settle a $22.2 million dispute by April 29 after the
four months of negotiations between the two stalled, the British
Broadcasting Corp. reported on April 30, citing a report by
 Guineenews . Mkhondo declined to say why the company’s operations
were seized by the West African country.  MTN bought Areeba, Guinea’s biggest mobile-phone company,
as part of its $5.53 billion 2007 merger with Middle Eastern
mobile-phone company Investcom LLC.  To contact the reporter on this story:
