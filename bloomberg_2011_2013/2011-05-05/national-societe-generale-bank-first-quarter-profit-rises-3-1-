National Societe Generale Bank,
 Egypt ’s second-biggest publicly traded bank, said its first-
quarter profit rose 3 percent due to an increase in loans and
deposits.  Net income increased to 364 million Egyptian pounds ($61.2
million) from 353 million pounds in the year-ago quarter, the
Cairo-based company said in an e-mailed statement today. Loans
grew 5 percent in the period, while deposits increased 6
percent, it said.  “Despite the chaos and the outbreak of security that
followed the early days of the revolution which interrupted the
banking operation across the country for almost a month, NSGB
has successfully managed the progressive restoration of
operations,” Mohamed El-Dib, the bank’s chairman, said in a
statement.  National Societe shares traded in Cairo fell 0.2 percent
today to 36.75 pounds and have lost 26 percent this year.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
