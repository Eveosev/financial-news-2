BP Plc (BP/)  plans to restart a second crude
unit and associated downstream production units at its Texas
City, Texas, refinery within a few days, according to a person
familiar with the situation.  The refinery restarted another crude unit late April 28
after a  power failure  April 25 forced the entire 475,000-barrel-
a-day plant to shut down. One of two fluid catalytic crackers
was started by May 3, said the person, who declined to be
identified because the information isn’t public.  The plant is operating roughly within the production range
it was prior to the shutdown caused by the power failure, said
the person. The refinery operates two sets of processing units,
known as “trains,” which are fed by separate crude units.  One of the production systems was returning to service
following planned work prior to the April 25 shutdown, according
to the person.  To contact the reporter on this story:
