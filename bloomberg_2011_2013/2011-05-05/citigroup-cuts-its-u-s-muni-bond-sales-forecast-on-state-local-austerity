Citigroup Inc. lowered its estimate of
U.S. municipal bond issuance this year to $240 billion from $275
billion a month ago, in part because fiscal austerity is leading
local governments to borrow less.  “I keep cutting it and cutting it and cutting it,”  George Friedlander , the bank’s chief municipal-debt strategist, told
the  National Federation of Municipal Analysts ’ conference in
Charleston, South Carolina, today.  At the start of the year, Citigroup estimated $350 billion
in sales. Last year, total issuance, which includes variable-
rate debt, climbed to $453.7 billion from $443.6 billion in
2009, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Sales this year have slowed as new governors took office
and as governments faced a limited capacity to pledge revenue to
new borrowing, Citigroup strategists wrote in an April 1 report.  “Cutting ribbons equals being a spender, and that’s a
politically unpopular thing to do,” Friedlander said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
