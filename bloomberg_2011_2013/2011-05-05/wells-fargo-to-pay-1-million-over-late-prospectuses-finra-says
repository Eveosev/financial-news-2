Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC)  will pay $1 million
to resolve Financial Industry Regulatory Authority claims that
its St. Louis-based brokerage didn’t give investment information
in a timely manner to clients who bought mutual funds in 2009.  Wells Fargo Advisers violated securities laws by failing to
deliver prospectuses within three days of the purchases, Finra
said today in a statement. The firm took as long as 153 days to
provide prospectuses and also failed to report information
including arbitrations and complaints involving some of its
representatives, Finra said.  The company failed to take corrective action after getting
reports from a firm contracted to mail the prospectuses that as
many as 9 percent of customers hadn’t received the information
within three days, Finra said.  “Mutual fund prospectuses contain key information about a
fund’s performance, risks, strategies and costs,” Brad Bennett,
Finra’s enforcement chief, said in the statement. “Wells Fargo
ignored reports alerting them to serious problems with its
prospectus delivery system and, as a result, its customers were
deprived of valuable information.”  Wells Fargo, the fourth biggest U.S. bank by assets,
resolved the claims without admitting or denying wrongdoing,
Washington-based Finra said.  “Wells Fargo Advisors has reached an agreed resolution
with Finra and is pleased to put this matter behind us,” Tony Mattera, a company spokesman, said in the statement. “Wells
Fargo Advisors has taken steps to review and modify procedures
where appropriate.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
