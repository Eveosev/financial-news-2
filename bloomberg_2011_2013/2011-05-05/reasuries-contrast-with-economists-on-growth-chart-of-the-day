Falling U.S. Treasury yields suggest
bond investors lack the optimism shown by economists about the
outlook for growth, according to  Edward Yardeni , president and
chief investment strategist at Yardeni Research.  The CHART OF THE DAY tracks a comparison that Yardeni cited
today in a report: the gap between yields on 10-year Treasury
notes and year-to-year percentage changes in nominal gross
domestic product, which isn’t adjusted for inflation.  Nominal GDP growth slowed during the past two quarters,
mirroring a similar slump in inflation-adjusted, or real, GDP.
The first-quarter figure dropped to 3.9 percent from 4.2 percent
in last year’s fourth quarter.  “The economy could be in a soft patch for the next few
months,” that would bring the second quarter’s growth rate into
line with yesterday’s 3.2 percent yield on the 10-year Treasury,
Yardeni wrote. Parts shortages related to  Japan ’s earthquake,
gasoline-price increases and spending cuts by state and local
government may limit economic expansion, he said.  Economists expect a rebound in the second quarter rather
than further weakness, according to the results of a Bloomberg
survey. The average real GDP estimate of 73 economists amounts
to a 2.7 percent increase from a year earlier. The first-quarter
figure was 2.2 percent.  “The behavior of the  bond market  certainly suggests that
fixed-income investors are less concerned about inflation and
expect slower growth in real economic activity,” Yardeni wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
