Venezuelan President  Hugo Chavez 
approved the seizure of 30 buildings he said were abandoned that
will be used to house homeless families in Caracas.  Chavez, speaking on state television, also said he signed a
decree that only allows for eviction after a “friendly accord”
between landlord and tenant. He also decreed a law to regulate
land occupancy in urban areas that allows the state to allocate
land lots and buildings to families.  To contact the reporters on this story:
