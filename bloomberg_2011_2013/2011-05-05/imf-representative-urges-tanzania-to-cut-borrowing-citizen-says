The  International Monetary Fund  urged
Tanzania to reduce borrowing for recurrent expenditure, The
 Citizen  reported, citing the IMF’s country representative, John
Wakeman-Linn.  Tanzania’s 2010/2011 budget is 11.9 trillion shillings
($7.9 billion), of which 6 trillion shillings came from internal
revenue and the rest from domestic and external loans and
grants, the Dar es Salaam-based newspaper said. About 7.3
trillion shillings is allocated to recurrent expenditure, while
4.6 trillion shillings is for investment.  For the past five years, Tanzania has increasingly borrowed
to finance recurrent expenditure while  tax revenue  has
stagnated, The Citizen cited Wakeman-Linn as saying.  The national debt rose by $1.6 billion to $11.2 billion in
the year through February, according to Bank of Tanzania monthly
Economic Review for March.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
