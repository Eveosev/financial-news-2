UniCredit SpA (UCG) , Italy’s biggest bank,
hired Olivier Khayat as deputy head of corporate and  investment
banking  in a reorganization of the business headed by Jean- Pierre Mustier.  Khayat, who left  Societe Generale (GLE)  SA last year, will also
be co-head of the unit’s financing and advisory business with
Vittorio Ogliengo, the head of investment banking for Italy,
UniCredit said in an e-mailed statement today. T.J. Lim will
become sole head of markets and Mike Hammond, the current co-
head, will take other responsibilities.  Mustier, the former Societe Generale investment-banking
chief who joined in March, is seeking to combine the bank’s debt
and equity businesses with merger advice and lending, the bank
said today. The firm is reviewing its strategy in some markets
to increase profitability and will present a new business plan
by the end of the summer.  UniCredit aims to provide “a strong product offer,
spanning across the entire offer of equity and financing
products,” Mustier said in the statement.  Khayat, 47, will be based in Milan. Piergiorgio Peluso, who
oversaw corporate banking in  Italy , will also be assuming a new
role, the bank said.  UniCredit’s corporate and investment banking unit posted
profit before tax of 2.7 billion euros ($3.9 billion) in 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
