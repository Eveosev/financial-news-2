Natural gas futures fell the most in
19 months, following declines in commodity markets, on a bigger-
than-forecast U.S. inventories gain and concern that economic
growth will ease.  Gas fell for a fourth day after the Energy Department said
stockpiles increased 72 billion cubic feet in the week ended
April 29 to 1.757 trillion cubic feet. Analyst estimates
compiled by Bloomberg showed an expected gain of 67 billion.
Gas’s loss accelerated along with oil as commodities dropped the
most in 31 months.  “It’s a knee-jerk reaction to the worse-than-expected
storage number,” said Peter Linder, president of the DeltaOne
Energy Fund in Calgary. “And when people look at the oil
complex, they just head for the hills.”  Natural gas for June delivery fell 31.6 cents, or 6.9
percent, to settle at $4.261 per million British thermal units
on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , the biggest percentage loss
for a front-month contract since Oct. 1, 2009, and the lowest
closing price since April 18.  The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Index of 24 raw materials fell
7.2 percent to 679.26 at 3:17 p.m., the biggest one-day drop
since Oct. 10, 2008.  The five-year average gas inventory change for the week is
an increase of 78 billion cubic feet, department data show. A
separate storage survey of Bloomberg users showed an expected
supply gain of 64 billion.  Year-Ago Supplies  Stockpiles were 1 percent below five-year average levels
for the week compared with a 0.6 percent deficit the previous
week. Storage levels were down 11.4 percent from a year earlier,
widening from 11.3 percent the previous week.  Gas extended losses as oil slumped after data showed that
U.S. jobless claims rose last week and productivity of workers
slowed in the first quarter. Crude for June delivery on the  New
York  exchange fell 8.6 percent to $99.80 a barrel, settling
below $100 for the first time since March 16.  “You are seeing a pretty widespread selling in
commodities,” said Brad Florer, a trader at Kottke Associates
LLC, an energy trading firm in Louisville,  Kentucky . “Now
everybody is trying to figure out where the support is.”  Also pushing commodities lower, the dollar climbed against
the euro after European Central Bank President  Jean-Claude
Trichet  said inflation risks will be watched “very closely,”
signaling the ECB may wait until after June to raise rates.  A strengthening dollar makes commodities priced in the
currency less attractive for investors.  Jobless Benefits  Applications for jobless benefits gained 43,000 to 474,000
in the week ended April 30, the most since August, Labor
Department figures showed today.  The measure of employee output per hour increased at a 1.6
percent annual rate after a 2.9 percent gain the prior three
months, according to the department.  Gas dropped before the government released the inventory
report as milder weather signaled reduced demand for the heating
and power-plant fuel.  There will be no “sustained severe temperature extremes”
in the next two weeks in the U.S., according to Commodity
Weather Group LLC in Bethesda,  Maryland .  The high temperature in New York on May 9 will be 68
degrees Fahrenheit (20 Celsius), 1 degree below normal,
according to  AccuWeather Inc.  in  State College ,  Pennsylvania .  Power plants  use 30 percent of the nation’s gas supplies
according to the Energy Department. Residential consumers
account for about 20 percent.  Nuclear Power  U.S. nuclear-power output rose for a third day in a rebound
from the lowest levels in almost 12 years. Some utilities turn
to gas-fired power plants when nuclear production drops.  Nuclear-power output gained 0.1 percent from yesterday to
70,452 megawatts, or 69 percent of capacity, according to a
Nuclear Regulatory Commission report today and data compiled by
Bloomberg. Production fell to 68,248 megawatts on May 2, the
lowest level since 1999.  Gas futures volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was
427,620 as of 2:48 p.m., compared with the three-month average
of 321,000. Volume was 316,850 yesterday. Open interest was
1,004,801 contracts, rising to a record above 1 million for a
second day. The three-month average open interest is 938,000.  The exchange has a one-business-day delay in reporting open
interest and full volume data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
