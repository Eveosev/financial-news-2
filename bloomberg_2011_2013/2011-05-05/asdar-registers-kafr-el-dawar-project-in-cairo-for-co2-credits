Masdar, the Abu Dhabi government-owned
renewable energy company, registered the Kafr el-Dawar project
in  Egypt  under the United Nations Clean Development Mechanism.  The project will switch the fuel used by the Spinning,
Weaving and Dying Co. in Kafr el-Dawar near Alexandria from
heavy fuel oil to natural gas, reducing  carbon emissions , the
company said in a statement received by e-mail today.  Once approved, the project would receive tradable carbon
credits, according to the statement. It is one of only 23 CDM
projects registered in the Middle East and North Africa, the
statement said. Masdar Carbon registered the project with
 TriOcean Carbon , a Cairo-based energy company.  Editors: Mike Anderson, Stephen Cunningham.  To contact the reporters on this story:
