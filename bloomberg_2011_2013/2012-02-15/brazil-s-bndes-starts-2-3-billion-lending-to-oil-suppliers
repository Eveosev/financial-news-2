Brazil ’s state development bank has
approved the first two loans as part of a 4 billion reais ($2.3
billion) program to finance oil equipment and service providers
at a time when the country plans to more than double oil
production by 2020.  BNDES , as the bank is known, is lending 143 million reais
to Grupo Georadar, a company that provides seismic research for
 oil companies , Ricardo Cunha da Costa, the head of BNDES’ oil
and gas supply chain department, said in an interview yesterday.
BNDES also agreed on a 13 million-real loan to Ruhrpumpen GmbH,
a Witten, German-based maker of industrial pumps that’s building
a plant in Brazil to supply the oil industry, he said.  The financing is needed because Brazil requires  Petroleo
Brasileiro SA (PETR4) , the country’s state-controlled  oil company , and
other oil producers to purchase as much as 70 percent of goods
and services from local suppliers as part of a plan to create
jobs and boost economic growth. Petrobras is spending more than
any other oil company as it develops the largest oil discoveries
in the America’s in over three decades.  “Foreign companies would much rather supply from abroad,
but this isn’t what the BNDES is interested in,” Costa said at
the bank’s headquarters in Rio de Janeiro. “They have to build
infrastructure.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
