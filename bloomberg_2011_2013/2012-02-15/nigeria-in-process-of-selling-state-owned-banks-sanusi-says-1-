Nigeria  is in the process of selling
the commercial lenders that it took over last year amid efforts
to stabilize the country’s banking industry following a lending
crisis, said central bank Governor Lamido Sanusi.  The state-owned Asset Management Corp. of Nigeria “will
soon appoint local and international advisers for the sale,
which will eventually lead to negotiations with the buyers,”
Sanusi said at a conference today in Lagos, the commercial
capital.  Nigeria’s government took over three lenders in August
after they were deemed unable to meet the Central Bank of
Nigeria’s recapitalization deadline following a 2009 lending
crisis that threatened some banks in West Africa’s biggest
economy.  The Abuja-based central bank fired the heads of eight of
Nigeria’s 24 lenders and bailed out the industry with 620
billion naira ($3.9 billion). The management corporation, known
as Amcon, was set up to stabilize the industry and buy non-
performing debt.  By the Sept. 30 recapitalization deadline, the taken over
lenders, Afribank Plc, Bank PHB Plc and Spring Bank Plc, “were
fully capitalized and attracted a couple of bidders,” Sanusi
said. “Investors preferred to deal with the institutions as
nationalized banks.”  While the central bank is not directly involved in the sale
of the banks, Sanusi said they are “expecting a smooth process,
with the exercise lasting as the  capital market  will decide.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
