Puma SE, (PUM)   Europe ’s second-largest
sporting-goods maker, reported profit that beat analysts’
estimates and its own projection, and forecast that earnings
will grow this year and next.  Net income in 2011 climbed 14 percent to 230.1 million
euros ($302.8 million), the Herzogenaurach, Germany-based
company said today, beating its target of “mid single-digit
growth.” The average of eight analysts’  estimates  compiled by
Bloomberg was 223.3 million euros.  Puma said it expects sales to rise by a “high single-
digit” percentage in 2012 and 2013, and net income to increase
at a “mid single-digit” pace in each of those years, assuming
moderate input-cost inflation. The company and larger
competitors  Nike Inc. (NKE)  and  Adidas AG (ADS)  stand to benefit from major
events taking place this year such as the European soccer
championships in Poland and Ukraine, and the London Olympics.  “With the support of a strong sports marketing portfolio,
we are well on track to explore the opportunities of the sports
year 2012 as well as achieve our 2015 goal of 4 billion euros in
sales,” Chief Executive Officer Franz Koch said in a statement.  The  shares  climbed as much as 3.6 percent to 248.45 euros
in Frankfurt trading and were up 2.7 percent as of 11:55 a.m.  Wider Margin  While cost pressures remain “intense,” according to the
company’s general finance manager Michael Laemmermann, the  gross
profit margin  widened to 46.7 percent in the fourth quarter from
45.4 percent a year earlier as Puma raised some prices and sold
more accessories. The maker of Future Cat Ferrari-branded
sneakers said in October it may face some “headwinds” in the
final quarter of 2011 as raw-material prices rise and the
company increases investment.  Fourth-quarter revenue rose 16 percent, led by a 28 percent
surge in the Americas. Sales in Europe, the  Middle East  and
 Africa  advanced 8.3 percent, overcoming consumers’ reluctance to
spend amid the euro zone debt crisis, Puma said. Sales in the
Asia-Pacific region climbed 11 percent, while U.S. sales growth
accelerated.  Full-year revenue climbed 11 percent to 3.01 billion euros,
compared with the company’s October target of 3 billion euros.  Puma said it will increase the 2011  dividend  to 2 euros a
share from 1.8 euros a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
