Asian  stocks  rose, with the region’s
benchmark index headed for a six-month high, after China pledged
to help resolve  Europe ’s debt crisis. Chipmakers outside  Japan 
rallied after debt-laden rival  Elpida Memory Inc. (6665)  said it may
not survive.  Cosco Pacific Ltd. (1199) , which operates container facilities at
 Greece ’s Piraeus port, added 4.1 percent in  Hong Kong . Samsung
Electronics Co. and  Hynix Semiconductor (000660)  Inc. advanced as Elpida
touched its lowest price in at least eight years.  Mitsubishi UFJ
Financial Group Inc. (8306)  advanced for a second day after the Bank of
Japan expanded its bond purchases.  Westfield Group (WDC)  climbed 5.3
percent in Sydney after the shopping mall operator reported a
five-fold jump in profit.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index gained 1.9 percent to 127.34 as
of 6:30 p.m. in Tokyo, set for the highest close since Aug. 4.
All 10 industry groups on the measure advanced.  “Greece will buy time with a second bailout and avoid
default, and the markets have been pricing that in,” said
Takeru Ogihara, chief strategist in Tokyo at Mizuho Trust &
Banking Co., a unit of Japan’s third-largest lender by market
value. “The BOJ took stronger action than expected, and
overseas investors seem to like it.”  Asian stocks extended gains as People’s Bank of  China 
Governor Zhou Xiaochuan said China is ready to be more involved
in resolving the European crisis through the European Financial
Stability Facility and European Stability Mechanism.  Greece Bailout  The leaders of Greece’s two biggest political parties, New
Democracy’s Antonis Samaras and Pasok’s George Papandreou, will
send written commitments today to the so-called troika to stand
by austerity measures, a government official said yesterday. The
assurance to the troika -- the  International Monetary Fund ,
European Commission and  European Central Bank  -- was a condition
of a 130 billion euro ($171 billion) bailout.  Cosco Pacific added 4.1 percent to HK$12.60 in Hong Kong.
Hutchison Whampoa Ltd., an owner of ports in Germany and Spain
and receives more than half of its revenue from Europe, rose 2.8
percent to HK$78.30.  Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average  advanced 2.3 percent. The
MSCI Asia Pacific excluding Japan Index gained 1.6 percent.
Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 rose 0.3 percent, while South Korea’s
Kospi Index increased 1.1 percent.  Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index added 2.1 percent and the
Shanghai Composite Index, which tracks the bigger of China’s
stock exchanges, rose 0.9 percent, reversing an earlier loss.  The  Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  of mainland companies
listed in Hong Kong advanced 2.4 percent following Zhou’s
comments. China Railway Construction Corp. rose 6.6 percent to
HK$5.97 after winning $1.45 billion of contracts.  China’s Support  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  advanced 0.7
percent today. The index lost 0.1 percent in  New York  yesterday,
paring an earlier decline of as much as 0.8 percent as U.S.
retail sales trailed estimates after sales of automobiles
unexpectedly declined.  Elpida slumped 14 percent to 320 yen after saying it sees
“uncertainty” over remaining in business because it hasn’t
secured financing. The company, which  reported  311.7 billion yen
($3.97 billion) revenue in the 12 months to Dec. 31, has 210.8
billion yen of debt maturing this year, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The shares earlier touched their lowest
level since at least November 2004.  Chipmakers in South Korea and  Taiwan  rose.  Samsung
Electronics (005930) , South Korea’s biggest exporter of consumer
electronics, rose 5.1 percent to 1.135 million won. Samsung may
separate its liquid-crystal-display business, the Electronics
Times reported today. Hynix Semiconductor, a maker of
semiconductors such as dynamic random access memory, gained 5.3
percent to 29,000 won.  Less Competition  “Investors appear to be betting that the possible failure
of Elpida will mean less competition in the industry, reducing
the number of players and production capacity,”  said Im Jeong Jae, a Seoul-based fund manager at Shinhan BNP Paribas Asset
Management Co., which oversees about $28 billion. “I don’t
think Elpida is in an extremely dire situation. Rather, they’re
trying to put pressure to get needed support.”  Powerchip Technology Corp., a Taiwanese maker of computer
memory, surged 6.4 percent to NT$1.34. Nanya Technology Corp.
jumped 6.8 percent to NT$4.09 in Taipei.  Japanese shares extended yesterday’s gains after the yen
touched 78.66 per dollar today, the lowest level since Nov. 1.  Mitsubishi UFJ Financial gained 4.1 percent to 408 yen.
 Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc. (8316) , Japan’s second-biggest
lender by market value, rose 4 percent to 2,703 yen.  Asian Profit  Westfield gained 5.3 percent to A$8.81 in Sydney after
reporting a fivefold jump in second-half profit. It also said it
will buy back as much as 10 percent of issued capital.  Of the 449 companies listed on the MSCI Asia Pacific Index
that have reported earnings since Jan. 9, more than half missed
analysts’ estimates, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The  Asia Pacific index  gained 9.8 percent this year through
yesterday, compared with a 7.4 percent advance by the  S&P 500 
and a 7.4 percent increase by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. Stocks
in the Asian benchmark are valued at 14.1 times estimated
earnings on average, compared with 12.9 times for the S&P 500
and 10.9 times for the Stoxx 600.  -- With assistance from Norie Kuboyama in  Tokyo . Editors: Nick
