American Superconductor Corp. (AMSC) , a
U.S. maker of wind-turbine components, said a Chinese court
denied a motion by  Sinovel Wind Group Co. (601558)  to transfer a lawsuit
to arbitration.  The Beijing No. 1 Intermediate People’s Court yesterday
rejected a request from  China ’s largest wind-turbine maker to
move the case to the Beijing Arbitration Commission, Devens,
Massachusetts-based AMSC said today in a statement.  AMSC says Sinovel, formerly its largest customer, violated
sales contracts and stole intellectual property. The civil suit
is one of three seeking more than $1.2 billion in damages. A
provincial court on Feb. 3 dismissed the smallest case, which
will be heard in arbitration.  “Sinovel is trying to get everything to go to arbitration
and not be sued in a regular court, and in this case the court
said no,”  Theodore O’Neill , an analyst at Wunderlich Securities
Inc. in New York, said today in an interview. “It’s one for
Sinovel, one for American Superconductor. It continues to be a
Mexican hat dance.”  Yesterday’s ruling is for a software copyright infringement
suit, seeking a cease and desist order and damages of $6
million. The decision couldn’t be independently confirmed at
this time.  The earlier ruling, by the Hainan Province No. 1
Intermediate People’s Court, was for a copyright infringement
case seeking $200,000 in damages.  AMSC fell 2.3 percent to $4.61 at the close in New York.
The shares have dropped 83 percent in the past year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
