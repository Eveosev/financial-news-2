Kuwait ’s new parliament elected
opposition lawmaker Ahmad Al-Saadoun as speaker, 12 years after
the politician lost the post to Jassim Al-Kharafi.  Khalid Sultan Al-Essa, an Islamist, was chosen as Al-
Saadoun’s deputy in the new legislature’s opening session today.
The election of parliament earlier this month is the fourth in
less than six years.  Al-Saadoun, 77, took part in an unprecedented campaign of
protests last year against the previous cabinet over corruption
allegations. Opposition candidates won more than 30 of
parliament’s 50 seats in the Feb. 2 election and vowed to push
to give the legislature extended power. A new 16-member Cabinet
headed by Prime Minister Sheikh Jaber Al-Mubarak Al-Sabah was
sworn in yesterday. Appointed cabinet members become de-facto
members of parliament in addition to the 50 elected lawmakers.  The Emir Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah in a speech today
urged for cooperation between parliament and the cabinet.
Repeated clashes between lawmakers and the government over how
to share power have led to a series of parliament dissolutions
and cabinet resignations in Kuwait, the fourth-biggest producer
in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, slowing
economic growth and delaying key investment projects.  To contact the reporter on this story:
