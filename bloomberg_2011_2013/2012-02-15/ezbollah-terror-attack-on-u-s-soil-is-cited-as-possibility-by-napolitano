U.S. Homeland Security Secretary
 Janet Napolitano  said she is concerned that Iran-backed
Hezbollah will attempt a terrorist attack on American soil.  The Homeland Security Department last week held a
conference call with Jewish groups “who have been the intended
targets in the past,” Napolitano said today in testimony before
the U.S. House Homeland Security Committee.  “We remain in constant touch with them,” she said, adding
that the U.S. isn’t aware of a specific threat of Hezbollah
planning an attack.  Hezbollah, a Shiite Muslim group based in Lebanon, is
considered a terrorist organization by the U.S. government.
 Israel  and the U.S. have escalated their criticism of Iran in
recent weeks for allegedly trying to develop nuclear weapons.  “We’re constantly monitoring” the Hezbollah threat,
Napolitano said.  Iran  loaded locally built fuel plates into its nuclear
research reactor in Tehran, state-run Press TV reported today,
showing images of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad inside the
facility.  To contact the reporter on this story:
