SouFun Holdings Ltd. (SFUN) , owner of
China’s largest real-estate website, dropped the most in almost
five months after saying fourth-quarter profit fell.  American depositary receipts of Soufun sank 11 percent to
$16.17 by 9:51 a.m. in New York. They earlier tumbled 13
percent, the biggest intraday decline since Sept. 22.  The Beijing-based company said today fourth-quarter net
income declined 24 percent from a year ago to $30.1 million.
Sales for 2012 will grow between 10.5 percent and 16.6 percent,
after increasing 53 percent in 2011 to $343.8 million, it
forecast in a statement issued via  Business Wire .  To contact the reporter on this story:
