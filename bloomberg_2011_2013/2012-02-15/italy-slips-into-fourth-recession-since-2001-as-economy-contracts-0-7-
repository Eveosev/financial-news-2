The Italian economy entered its
fourth recession since 2001, contracting more than economists
forecast in the fourth quarter as government austerity measures
weighed on growth.  Gross domestic product declined 0.7 percent from the
previous three months, when it shrank 0.2 percent, national
statistics institute Istat said in a preliminary report in  Rome 
today. The contraction was more than the median forecast of a
0.6 percent decline by 22 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.  The Italian slump contrasted with better-than-forecast
performances by the French and German economies in the fourth
quarter.  France  unexpectedly expanded 0.2 percent, while  Germany 
contracted 0.2 percent, less than the median forecast for a 0.3
percent contraction by 43 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.  Prime Minister  Mario Monti , who took over after Silvio
Berlusconi’s resignation in November, pushed through 20 billion
euros ($26 billion) in spending cuts and tax increases in
December. The government also approved measures to boost
competiveness and cut red tape in an attempt to spur growth in
the euro-region’s third-biggest economy.  The government projects GDP to fall 0.5 percent this year,
while the  International Monetary Fund  forecasts a contraction of
2.2 percent. Bank of Italy Director General Fabrizio Saccomanni
told reporters in Rome last week that he expects the economy to
shrink as much as 1.5 percent in 2012.  Monti’s attempt to spur the growth needed to reduce Italy’s
$2.5 trillion debt, about four times the size of the EU’s
bailout fund, may be vital to preventing a break-up of the 17-
nation euro region.  To contact the reporter on this story:
