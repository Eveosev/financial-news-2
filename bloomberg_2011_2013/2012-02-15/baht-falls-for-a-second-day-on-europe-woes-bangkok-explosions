Thailand ’s baht dropped for a second
straight day as speculation  Greece  will default on its debt
damped sentiment toward emerging-market assets.  European finance ministers canceled a meeting in Brussels
slated for today and urged Greece to do more to clinch a bailout
package needed to meet debt obligations falling due next month.
The risk of a “disorderly default has risen,” according to
Thomas Costerg, a London-based economist at Standard Chartered
Plc. Thai government bonds were steady on concern explosions in
Bangkok yesterday may hurt tourism and slow an economy
recovering from the nation’s worst floods in almost 70 years.  “On top of European debt concerns, Thailand has some
domestic risk,” said  Hideki Hayashi , a researcher at the Japan
Center for  Economic Research  in  Tokyo . “The explosions hurt
investor sentiment and the baht may stay under some downward
pressure.”  The baht dropped 0.2 percent to 30.89 per dollar as of 8:38
a.m. in Bangkok, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It may
slide to around 31 this week, Hayashi said.  An Iranian was critically injured in the blasts as he and
two other men tried to escape arrest following an explosion at
their rented home, government spokeswoman Thitima Chaisang said
by phone yesterday. The incident occurred a month after the U.S.
Embassy warned that “foreign terrorists” were aiming to attack
tourist areas in Bangkok.  The yield on the government’s 3.25 percent bonds due June
2017 was unchanged at 3.20 percent, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
