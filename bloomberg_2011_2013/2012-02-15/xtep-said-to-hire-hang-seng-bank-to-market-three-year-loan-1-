Xtep International Holdings (1368)  Ltd., a
Hong Kong-based maker of sportswear and footwear, hired  Hang
Seng Bank Ltd. (11)  to help it arrange a $100 million three-year term
loan, according to a person familiar with the matter.  The dual-currency facility can be funded in either Hong
Kong or U.S. dollars and banks are being offered an all-in fee
of about 383 basis points to 393 basis points over benchmark
rates in syndication depending on their level of commitment, the
person said, asking not to be identified as details are private.  Xtep said in an e-mailed statement today that it “has not
entered into any legally binding agreement with any banking
institution” and aims to “seek different ways to enhance its
financial position and expand cooperation with various banking
institutions.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
