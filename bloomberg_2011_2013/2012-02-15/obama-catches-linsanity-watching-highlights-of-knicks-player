There’s no escaping Linsanity, even
at the White House.  President  Barack Obama  talked about New York Knicks point
guard Jeremy Lin with his staff as he set out on a trip to an
event in Wisconsin this morning, White House press secretary  Jay Carney  said.  Lin sank a 3-point shot in the final second of last night’s
game, giving the Knicks a victory over the  Toronto Raptors . It
was the team’s sixth straight win.  Obama, an avid basketball fan and recreational player,
watched highlights of the game, and Carney described the
president as “very impressed.”  Lin wasn’t drafted after graduating from Harvard University
and had been a bench player in New York until this month. The
frenzy surrounding the player has been dubbed Linsanity.  “It’s just a great story, and the president was saying as
much this morning,” Carney told reporters aboard Air Force One.
“It’s obviously terrific for the  New York Knicks , but it’s the
kind of sports story that transcends the sport itself.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
