The European Union and the U.S.
agreed to recognize each other’s organic certification, meaning
certified organic products can be sold as such in either region,
the European Commission said.  The organic-product market in the U.S. and the EU is
estimated to be worth about 40 billion euros ($52 billion) a
year, the commission wrote today in an e-mailed statement. U.S.
organic exports were about $1.8 billion in 2010, the Department
of Agriculture said in a statement, predicting 8 percent growth
for the next several years.  “This partnership between the two largest organic
producers in the world will establish a strong foundation from
which to promote organic agriculture,” the European Commission
wrote.  EU Agriculture Commissioner Dacian Ciolos, U.S. Deputy
Agriculture Secretary Kathleen Merrigan and U.S. Trade
Representative Chief Agricultural Negotiator Isi Siddiqui signed
the partnership agreement today at an organics trade show in
Nuremberg,  Germany , according to the statements.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
