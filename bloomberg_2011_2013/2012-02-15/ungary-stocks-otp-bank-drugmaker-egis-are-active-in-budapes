Hungarian market today. Stock symbols follow company names.  OTP Bank Nyrt. (OTP)  , Hungary’s largest lender, rallied
1.4 percent to 3,983 forint as data showed Hungary’s economy
expanded more than economists forecast in the fourth quarter and
after China pledged to help resolve  Europe ’s debt crisis.  Egis Nyrt. (EGIS)  , the Hungarian drugmaker owned by
Laboratoires Servier, advanced 1.6 percent to 17,005 forint, a
third day of gains. UniCredit SpA upgraded its recommendation to
