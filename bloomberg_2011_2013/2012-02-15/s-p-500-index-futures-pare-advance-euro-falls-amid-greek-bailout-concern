U.S. stock-index futures pared gains
and the euro fell amid concern that European officials will
delay  Greece ’s bailout until after elections in April.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index expiring next
month were up 0.5 percent at 1,353.8 at 8:35 a.m. in New York
after rising as much as 0.8 percent earlier. Futures trimmed
their advance to below 1,351 before recovering some gains after
a Federal Reserve gauge of manufacturing in the New York area
topped economists’ estimates. The euro slipped 0.4 percent to
$1.3087.  Euro area finance officials are investigating delaying
parts or all of the second bailout while still avoiding a
disorderly default, Reuters reported, citing several European
Union sources.  Greece said that  Europe ’s wealthier countries are “playing
with fire” by toying with the idea of expelling it from the 17-
nation euro area as talks over a second aid program ran into new
obstacles. Finance Minister Evangelos Venizelos leveled the
accusation after a decision slated for tonight on aid totalling
130 billion euros ($171 billion) was postponed until Feb. 20 at
the earliest.  To contact the reporter on this story:
