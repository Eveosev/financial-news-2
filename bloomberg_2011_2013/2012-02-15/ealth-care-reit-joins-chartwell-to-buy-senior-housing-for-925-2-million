Health Care REIT Inc. (HCN)  and Chartwell
Seniors Housing Real Estate Investment Trust agreed to buy
senior-housing properties in Canada for $925.2 million.  Most of the 42 properties are independent-living
communities in  Quebec , Ontario, British Columbia and Alberta,
Health Care REIT said in a statement today. They are being
purchased from five investment funds, the Toledo, Ohio-based
company said.  The transaction, expected to be completed in the second
quarter, will immediately add to Health Care REIT’s funds from
operations, according to the statement. FFO gauges a real estate
company’s ability to generate cash.  “This investment takes our successful U.S. investment
strategy and applies it to the Canadian market,” George Chapman, Health Care REIT’s chairman and chief executive
officer, said in the statement. The company “will gain a
meaningful foothold in  Canada ’s largest and most attractive
markets,” he said.  The partners will have equal shares in 39 of the properties
and Health Care REIT will wholly own the others, according to
the statement. Chartwell, based in Mississauga, Ontario, will
manage the communities.  Health Care REIT owned 898 properties in 45 states as of
Sept. 30, according to the statement. Chartwell owned, operated
and managed 195 senior-housing developments in  North America .  To contact the reporter on this story:
