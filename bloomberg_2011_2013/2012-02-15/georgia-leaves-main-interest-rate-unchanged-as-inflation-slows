Georgia ’s central bank left its main
interest  rate  unchanged after four reductions in borrowing costs
as inflation slowed to its lowest level in more than two years.  The rate remained at 6.5 percent, the bank, based in the
capital, Tbilisi, said today on its website. Consumer prices
rose 0.5 percent from a year earlier in January, the slowest
pace since September 2009, the Statistics Service said last
month.  Neighboring Armenia left borrowing costs unchanged at 8
percent for a fifth month Feb. 7. Azerbaijan’s benchmark
interest rate is 5.25 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
