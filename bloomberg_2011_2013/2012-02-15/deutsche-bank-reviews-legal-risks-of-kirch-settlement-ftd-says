Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  asked several law
firms to review the legal risks of agreeing to the proposed 800
million euro ($1 billion) settlement with the heirs of media
entrepreneur Leo Kirch, Financial Times Deutschland reported.  At its meeting yesterday the lender’s management board
didn’t sign off on the agreement, which would settle a 10-year-
old litigation process, the newspaper reported, citing
unidentified people from the finance industry. The executives
need to decide whether ending the litigation and the
reputational risks of the case justify paying the amount, FTD
said.  Deutsche Bank wants to book the amount in fiscal year 2011
to avoid burdening results of the first quarter of 2012,
according to FTD.  --. Editor:  Chris Peterson   To contact the reporter on this story:
