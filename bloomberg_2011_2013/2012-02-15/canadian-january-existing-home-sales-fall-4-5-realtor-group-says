Canadian existing home sales
declined last month at the fastest pace since July 2010, the
country’s main realtor group said.  Sales dropped 4.5 percent in January from December, the
first decline in five months, the  Canadian Real Estate
Association  said today from Ottawa. From a year earlier, the
average resale price rose 1.2 percent to C$348,178 ($349,500)
and sales increased 4 percent, the slowest pace since May 2011.  The housing market will be “steady” this year with
moderate economic growth and low  mortgage rates , the federal
housing agency said in a Feb. 13 forecast. Finance Minister  Jim Flaherty  tightened mortgage rules last year on concern that some
households were taking on debts they wouldn’t be able to afford
when interest rates rise.  To contact the reporter on this story:
