Wheat futures rose for the second
time this week on speculation that freezing weather will curb
Ukrainian production and exports.  Dormant crops in Ukraine, the world’s seventh-largest wheat
exporter, endured “extreme cold weather” in the past three
weeks, hurting plants that lacked protective snow cover, Telvent
DTN said in a report yesterday. Ice at ports and in shipping
lanes is slowing deliveries from the country, said Christopher Gadd, an analyst at Macquarie Group Ltd.  “The ports are frozen up, and moving grain around right
now is a nightmare,” Gadd said by telephone from  London .
“There are massive issues that are limiting grain exports out
of the region. You can’t see selling pressure come back to the
wheat complex until you see the weather abate in the  Black Sea
region .”  Wheat futures for May delivery gained 0.3 percent to
$6.4075 a bushel at 9:47 a.m. on the Chicago Board of Trade.
Before today, prices were down 29 percent in the past year as
output increased from India to  Canada .  A cold front killed hundreds of people in eastern  Europe  in
the last few weeks and disrupted shipping traffic on the Danube
river.  To contact the reporter on this story:
