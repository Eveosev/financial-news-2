A  UBS AG (UBSN)  brokerage unit sued two
former financial advisers in  Chicago , claiming they took
confidential trade secret information including customer account
data to competitor Wells Fargo Advisers LLC.  Named as defendants in the lawsuit filed today by UBS
Financial Services Inc. are David Kinnear and Kathleen Bakas,
who allegedly resigned two days ago to join the  Wells Fargo &
Co.  unit. One full-time and one part-time UBS employee, all part
of Kinnear’s wealth-management group, went with them, according
to the complaint.  “Led by Kinnear, the team serviced accounts that generated
more than $3.7 million in revenues for UBS over the past 12
months of the defendants’ employment,” UBS alleged.  The New York-based brokerage unit of Zurich-based UBS seeks
a court order blocking the defendants and any  Wells Fargo (WFC) 
representative from soliciting any UBS client Kinnear or Bakas
had advised while there, preventing the disclosure of any
proprietary UBS information and directing its return.  UBS also seeks expedited arbitration of its claims through
the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.  Ancel Martinez, a spokesman for San Francisco-based Wells
Fargo, which isn’t a party to the suit, couldn’t immediately
comment on the case. Kinnear and Bakas didn’t immediately
respond to e-mail messages seeking comment on the lawsuit.  The case is UBS Financial Services Inc. v. Kinnear,
12CH05333, Cook County,  Illinois , Circuit Court,  Chancery
Division  (Chicago).  To contact the reporter on this story:
