TVN SA (TVN) , Poland’s biggest television
network, tumbled the most in six months as profit missed
analysts’ estimates and the company withdrew earnings guidance
for 2012.  TVN plunged as much as 11 percent to 10.55 zloty, the
steepest intraday decline since Aug. 11. The stock traded 10
percent lower to 10.64 zloty as of 3.48 p.m., valuing the
company at 3.6 billion zloty ($2 billion). Poland’s benchmark
 WIG20 Index (WIG20)  rose 0.1 percent to 2,330,85.  The Warsaw-based company’s 317.4 million-zloty net loss in
2011 was its first annual decline since it began trading in 2004
as advertisement spend slowed and a weaker currency increased
the value of its euro-denominated debt. TVN, which also owns the
country’s biggest Internet portal Onet.pl, expects the domestic
TV advertising market to stagnate in 2012.  “Investors are not disappointed with the weak earnings
itself, but rather than that the prospects of the ad market are
poor,” Dominik Niszcz, a Vienna-based analyst at Raiffeisen
Centrobank AG, said by phone. “We don’t see any positive,
short-term signals for the stock. TVN still looks expensive.”  The yield on the company’s 2018 euro bonds rose 10 basis
points, or 0.1 percentage point, to 8.87 percent, the highest in
more than a week, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
