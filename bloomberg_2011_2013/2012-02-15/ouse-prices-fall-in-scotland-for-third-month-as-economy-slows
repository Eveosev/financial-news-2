House prices  in Scotland fell for a
third consecutive month in December as the economy slowed,
according to a survey by  LSL Property Services Plc. (LSL)   House values have declined 2 percent since April 2010 and
fell 0.2 percent on average in December to 146,913 pounds
($230,000), LSL Property, owner of realtors Your Move, said in a
statement today. December prices declined an average of 1
percent compared with the same month in 2010. The number of
transactions rose 2.5 percent in December from November.  “Buyers are understandably unsure which direction the
economy will take, which will encourage more of them to sit
tight during 2012,” Gordon Fowlis, regional managing director
of Your Move, said in the statement. “The banks are terrified
by the prospect of a further downturn in the  euro zone , which
will feed through into the mortgage market.”  The U.K.’s  gross domestic product  shrank 0.2 percent in the
fourth quarter, leaving the economy on the brink of a recession,
as inflation, rising unemployment and the euro-area debt crisis
damped  consumer spending . LSL is the country’s second-largest
realtor with about 570 outlets, according to the company.
Countrywide Plc is the country’s largest mortgage and real-
estate broker.  To contact the reporter on this story:
