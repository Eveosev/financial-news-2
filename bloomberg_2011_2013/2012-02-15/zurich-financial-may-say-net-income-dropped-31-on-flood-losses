Zurich Financial Services AG (ZURN) ,
 Switzerland ’s biggest insurer, may say fourth-quarter profit
fell 31 percent after increased natural catastrophe losses.  Net income  probably dropped to $742 million, from $1.07
billion a year earlier, according to the average  estimate  of 10
 analysts  surveyed by Bloomberg. The Zurich-based insurer is due
to report results tomorrow at 6:45 a.m. local time.  The company said on Jan. 26 it expects insured losses of as
much as $250 million to be booked in the fourth quarter
following the floods in  Thailand  and increased cost estimates
for the New Zealand earthquake and its aftershocks.  Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg  expect  the insurer to keep
its 2011 dividend at the previous year’s level. Zurich Financial
said on Dec. 1 that it wants to keep its dividend policy
unchanged after increasing its 2010 payout to an 11-year high of
17 Swiss francs ($18.54), adding that the insurer’s solvency and
cash generation will support this goal.  The following is a table of the analysts’ estimates and
year-earlier figures in millions of dollars.
