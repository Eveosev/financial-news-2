Egypt ’s benchmark  EGX30 Index (EGX30) 
retreated for a second day, losing 1.2 percent to 5,003.45 at
the 2:30 p.m. close in Cairo.  The following shares were active on the Egyptian Exchange
today. Stock symbols follow company names.  Commercial International Bank Egypt SAE (COMI)   lost the
most in more than a week, declining 1.6 percent to 23.59
Egyptian pounds. The Arab country’s biggest publicly traded
lender was reduced to “sell” from “hold” and the 12-month
share-price estimate cut to 21 pounds from 26 pounds at Deutsche
Bank AG.  Juhayna Food Industries (JUFO)   declined 1.4 percent, the
most in almost two weeks, to 4.9 pounds. Egypt’s biggest
producer of packaged milk was cut to “neutral” from
“overweight” and had its share-price estimate reduced 28
percent to 5.07 pounds at HC.  Orascom Telecom Media & Technology Holding SAE  (OTMT EY)
which owns a stake in Egyptian Co. for Mobile Services, or
Mobinil, fell for the first time in more than three weeks,
slumping 6.3 percent to 1.48 pounds. Investors are speculating
the 76 percent rally of the shares of the Egyptian mobile-
telephone company since Jan. 22 was overdone.  France Telecom SA (FTE)  said Feb. 13 it reached a preliminary
agreement to increase its stake in Mobinil. “We’re seeing
profit-taking as the shares near the 1.8 pound level we estimate
they are worth after the Mobinil sale,” said Tamer Nigm, head
of sales and trading at Cairo-based Watheeqa Securities
Brokerage. “It’s still unclear whether profit from the sale
will be distributed fully or partially to investors.”  Mobinil surged by the daily limit for a third day, climbing
10 percent to 166.83 pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
