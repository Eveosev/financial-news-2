U.K. jobless claims rose more than
economists forecast in January and unemployment held at the
highest rate for 16 years in the fourth quarter as the economy
contracted.  The number of people claiming jobless benefits rose by
6,900 to 1.6 million, the highest since January 2010, the Office
for National Statistics said today in London. The median of 24
forecasts in a Bloomberg News Survey was for a gain of 3,000.
U.K. unemployment measured by International Labour Organization
methods rose by 48,000 to 2.67 million in the fourth quarter,
leaving the rate at 8.4 percent, the most since 1995.  The data will fuel opposition claims that Prime Minister
 David Cameron  is trying to cut the  budget deficit  too quickly
after the economy shrank 0.2 percent in the fourth quarter.
Government forecasters predict unemployment will reach 8.7
percent by the end of 2012 as the private sector fails to make
up for the loss of tens of thousands of public-sector jobs.  “The U.K. labor-market data continue to paint a bit of a
mixed picture, but the key point is that unemployment is still
rising,” said  Vicky Redwood , an economist at Capital Economics
Ltd. in London. “We continue to expect unemployment to rise
much further in response to the weakness in the wider economy.”  Not Enough  The pound fell 0.1 percent against the dollar after the
report and was trading at $1.5678 as of 9:48 a.m. in  London .  The increase in the number of people claiming jobless
benefits last month left the claimant-count rate at 5 percent.
Claims rose 1,900 in December instead of the 1,200 initially
reported. Employment rose by 60,000 during the fourth quarter to
29.1 million. The figures suggest the private sector is failing
to create enough jobs to satisfy the number of Britons seeking
work.  Bank of England  Governor  Mervyn King  will publish new
economic projections at a press conference in London at 10:30
a.m. after policy makers said last week they will pump another
50 billion pounds ($79 billion) into the economy. Moody’s
Investors Service said this week it may strip the U.K. of its
top  credit rating  as the euro-region debt crisis undermines
growth prospect.  Recovery Signs  The move came despite tentative signs of recovery, with
indexes of manufacturing, services and construction all rising
in January. In the U.S., the  unemployment rate  fell to a three-
year low of 8.3 percent in January and the MSCI All-Country
World Index has risen 8 percent this year.  The Confederation of British Industry, the country’s
biggest business lobby, said earlier this week that the economy
will avoid a slump and growth will pick up this year. Cameron is
counting on hiring at private companies to offset about 700,000
public-sector jobs losses by 2017 as a result of his budget
squeeze.  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS) , Britain’s biggest
government-owned lender, said on Feb. 10 that it will cut as
many as 300 mainly London-based staff in its  capital markets  and
cash equities units after failing to find a buyer for the
businesses. The lender said in January it would cut about 3,500
jobs at its investment-banking division.  AstraZeneca Plc (AZN) , the U.K.’s second-biggest drugmaker, said
on Feb. 2 that it will cut 7,300 jobs on top of 21,600 positions
already eliminated by Chief Executive Officer  David Brennan 
since 2007.  Today’s report showed that pay growth in the fourth quarter
was unchanged at 2 percent, while the figure excluding bonuses
barely accelerated to 2 percent from 1.9 percent, underlining
the squeeze on consumers facing an inflation rate of 3.6 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
