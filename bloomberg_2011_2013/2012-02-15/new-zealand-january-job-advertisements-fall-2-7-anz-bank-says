New Zealand job advertisements fell
2.7 percent in January from December, ANZ National Bank Ltd.
said in an e-mailed statement. The decrease was driven by a 4.9
percent fall in internet listings, partly offset by a 7.7
percent rise in newspaper advertising, the Auckland-based lender
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
