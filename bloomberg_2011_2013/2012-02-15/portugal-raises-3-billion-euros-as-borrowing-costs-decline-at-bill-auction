Portugal  raised 3 billion euros
($3.92 billion) as it sold debt maturing in up to 12 months
after increasing the amount to meet investor demand.  The auctions included 1.5 billion euros of bills due in one
year, the longest maturity since Portugal requested a bailout
from the European Union and the  International Monetary Fund  in
April last year. It sold 300 million euros of three-month bills,
getting bids for 10.3 times the amount sold, and 1.2 billion
euros of six-month debt. Borrowing costs fell for each of the
three securities that were offered.  “Despite a significant decline in the three-month yield,
the Portuguese state is opting to issue more debt at a longer
maturity as it prefers to gain time by selling a greater amount
of 12-month debt,” said Filipe Silva, who manages 60 million
euros of debt securities at Banco Carregosa SA in Oporto,
northern Portugal. “With these auctions, the financing needs
for this quarter have been met.”  Portugal’s debt management agency said on Feb. 10 that it
was adding the sale of 12-month debt to two other issues already
included in its quarterly calendar due to “specific demand from
investors.” It also increased its sales target in a separate
announcement yesterday.  Additional Collateral  The  European Central Bank  on Feb. 9 approved the temporary
use of additional collateral in funding operations by seven
euro-area members’ central banks including Portugal. It will
offer unlimited loans of up to three years against eligible
collateral on Feb. 28 that can be used to finance purchases of
assets including higher-yielding government debt.  The securities due in February 2013 were sold today at an
average yield of 4.943 percent and the auction attracted bids
for two times the amount offered, the debt agency said. Portugal
had last offered 12-month debt on April 6, 2011, when it sold
455 million euros of the securities at an average yield of 5.902
percent and a bid-to-cover ratio of 2.6. The country requested a
bailout later the same day.  Portugal’s borrowing costs on the securities due in August
fell to an average yield of 4.332 percent from a rate of 4.463
percent at a previous auction of six-month bills on Feb. 1.  The nation agreed to pay an average 3.845 percent on the
three-month debt, compared with 4.068 percent on Feb. 1, when
the bid-to-cover ratio was 2.8.  The IGCP, as the debt agency is known, said on Feb. 10 that
the total indicative amount for today’s auctions would be
between 1.5 billion euros and 2 billion euros. It revised that
range yesterday, increasing the amount to between 2.5 billion
euros and 3 billion euros.  Portugal has sold 8 billion euros of bills this year. The
IGCP said on Dec. 29 that the total indicative amount of bills
to be sold in the first quarter of 2012 was as much as 6.5
billion euros.  Portugal’s two-year note yield climbed eight basis points
to 13.93 percent as of 12:50 p.m. in  London .  Ten-year bonds  also
declined, pushing the yield six basis points higher to 12.09
percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
