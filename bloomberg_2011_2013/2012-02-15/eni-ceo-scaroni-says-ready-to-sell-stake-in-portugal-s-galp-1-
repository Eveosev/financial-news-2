Eni SpA (ENI) , Italy’s largest oil
producer, is ready to sell its 33 percent holding in Portugal’s
Galp Energia SGPS, Chief Executive Officer  Paolo Scaroni  said.  The stake in the Lisbon-based company is worth as much as
3.8 billion euros ($5 billion), Scaroni said. Eni bought its
stake in Galp in 2000 for 964 million euros and has already
returned its investment in dividends and tax benefits, according
to Scaroni.  It “has been a very good investment for us,” he told
investors today. “As far as price is concerned, we would
consider a price which takes into account the market of course,
and we will not be ready to sell below the market price.”  Galp has a current market value of 10.6 billion euros,
giving Eni’s stake a price of 3.5 billion euros.  Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4) , Brazil’s state-controlled oil
producer, last February ended talks with Eni over the
acquisition of the stake in Galp.  In addition, the Italian company will be disposing of its
50 percent stake in Snam SpA, which owns the nation’s natural-
gas distribution network, after the government ordered it to
offload the holding worth about 5.9 billion euros.  Eni will need to receive sale approval from Amorim Energia
BV, the Portuguese investment company holding a third of Galp,
and from the  Portuguese government  before 2014 according to a
shareholder agreement, Scaroni said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
