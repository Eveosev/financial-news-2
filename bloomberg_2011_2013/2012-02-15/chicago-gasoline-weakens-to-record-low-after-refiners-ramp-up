Chicago  gasoline fell to a record
low after refiners increased the amount of oil they process to
the highest level for this time of year  in two decades  and
inventories of the fuel increased.  Gasoline stockpiles  in the Midwest  rose last week to 57.2
million barrels, the eighth consecutive weekly gain and the
highest level since February 2010, according to the Energy
Department. Refiners processed 3.45 million barrels a day, the
most since 1992 for this time of year.  The discount for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in
 Chicago (CHCG87PC)  widened 10 cents to 65 cents a gallon versus futures
traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange at 2:55 p.m.,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Itâ€™s the lowest level
since at least 1996. Prompt delivery slipped 7.49 cents to
$2.3576 a gallon.  Canadian oils used by Midwest refiners have been at record
discounts to West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. benchmark crude,
increasing profits from producing fuel.  Reformulated, 87-octane gasoline, or RBOB, in the Gulf
Coast market strengthened 2.53 cents to a discount of 2.35 cents
a gallon versus futures traded on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange .  Marathon Petroleum Co. experienced a partial  power failure 
at the Garyville refinery in  Louisiana  that caused malfunctions
in several units, Jean Kelly, a spokeswoman at the state
Department of Environmental Quality, said in an e-mail.  The failure at the 460,000-barrel-a-day plant occurred at
about 11 a.m. local time and resulted in a release of sulfur
dioxide that was secured after 20 minutes, Kelly said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
