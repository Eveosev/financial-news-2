OCI Co., the world’s second-biggest
maker of polysilicon used in solar panels, fell the most in more
than three months in Seoul trading after Citigroup Inc. said
 Germany  may cut industry subsidies by more than 20 percent.  The stock  declined 6 percent, the most since Nov. 10, to
close at 283,500 won on the Korea Exchange today. The benchmark
Kospi stock index gained 1.1 percent.  Germany, the world’s biggest solar market, will probably
reduce feed-in tariffs, the rate paid to owners of solar
installations in the country, by at least 20 percent from April,
Citigroup analysts led by  Timothy Arcuri  wrote in a report
yesterday. Shares of LDK Solar Co., a panel maker based in
 China ’s south-central Jiangxi province, and those of module
manufacturer Yingli Green Energy Holding Co. declined yesterday
in U.S. trading after the report was released.  “The possibility of a subsidy reduction in the world’s
biggest solar market is darkening the outlook for polysilicon
makers,” said Ahn Sang Hee, an analyst at Daishin Securities
Co. in  Seoul , who has a “neutral” recommendation on the stock.
“The outlook is affecting investment appetite on OCI,” which
is scheduled to boost its output capacity to the world’s biggest
later this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
