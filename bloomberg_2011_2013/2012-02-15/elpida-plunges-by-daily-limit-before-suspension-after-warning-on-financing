Elpida Memory Inc. (6665) , the Japanese
chipmaker facing an April deadline to repay  debts , plunged by
the daily limit in Tokyo before trading was halted as offers to
sell exceeded buyers.  The shares  dropped  21 percent, the biggest decline since
2004, to 294 yen as of 9:54 a.m. in Tokyo before trading was
suspended on the imbalance of orders. The chipmaker was offered
at 294 yen as of 10:10 a.m. on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.  Elpida said yesterday there is “uncertainty” about its
future as it hasn’t reached a deal with the trade ministry, the
 Development Bank  of  Japan  and its main lenders, reversing a Feb.
2 statement that it expects to secure financing. The Tokyo-based
company’s ability to repay 92 billion yen ($1.2 billion) in
bonds and loans is made more difficult by plunging chip prices
and five straight quarters of losses.  “The chip industry is in trouble,” said Edwin Merner,
president of Tokyo-based Atlantis Investment Research, which
manages $300 million. “Most commodity type chip companies are
losing money and the business continues to be capital
intensive.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
