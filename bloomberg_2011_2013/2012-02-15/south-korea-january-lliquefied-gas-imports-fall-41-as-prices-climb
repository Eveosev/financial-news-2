South Korean liquefied natural gas
imports fell 41 percent from a year earlier in January, while
the average price paid climbed 31 percent.  The North Asian nation, the world’s second-biggest buyer of
LNG, bought 2.89 million metric tons of the power-station fuel
last month, compared with 4.93 million tons a year earlier, data
on the Korea Customs Service’s  website  showed today. Imports
totaled 4.77 million tons in December.  South Korea , which imports almost all its natural gas, paid
$1.99 billion, or $690.2 a ton, for January purchases, compared
with $2.61 billion, or $528.77 a ton, a year earlier, the data
showed.  The nation buys most of the fuel under multiyear contracts
from countries including Qatar, Oman and Indonesia. Last month’s
purchases included 263,923 tons bought on the  spot market  for an
average $752.15 a ton from countries including Nigeria, Trinidad
& Tobago and the U.S., today’s data showed. State-run  Korea Gas
Corp. (036460)  is the nation’s biggest importer of the fuel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
