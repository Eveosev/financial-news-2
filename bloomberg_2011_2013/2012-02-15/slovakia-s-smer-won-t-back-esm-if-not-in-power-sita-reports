Slovakia’s opposition Smer party
will not support the creation of  Europe ’s permanent rescue fund
unless the party takes part in the future government,  SITA 
reported, citing Chairman  Robert Fico .  Smer, which is leading the polls before March 10 elections
and supports the establishment of the European Stability
Mechanism, said it will “never” do so in Parliament if it’s
left out of the next ruling coalition, the newswire quoted Fico
as saying today.  Smer in October voted for the enhancement of the European
Financial Stability Facility, the ESM’s predecessor, only after
the government of Iveta Radicova had collapsed over the issue,
leading to an agreement on early elections.  To contact the reporter on this story:
