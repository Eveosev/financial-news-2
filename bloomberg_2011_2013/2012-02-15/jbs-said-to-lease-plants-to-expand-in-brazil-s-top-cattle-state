JBS SA (JBSS3) , the world’s largest beef
producer, is said to have leased four slaughterhouses in Brazil
as it seeks to expand in the top cattle state of Mato Grosso,
according to three people with direct knowledge of the deal.  JBS is hiring three plants in the Central Brazilian state
and one in the northern state of Rondonia, said the people, who
can’t be identified because terms aren’t public. The plants were
leased from  Guapore Carne  and can slaughter 3,050 animals a day.  The company led by Chief Executive Officer Wesley Batista
currently has the capacity to slaughter 87,290 cattle daily in
62  plants  in six countries, according to information on its
website. Most of the plants are in the state of Mato Grosso.  The state holds 13 percent of  Brazil ’s cattle herd of 205.3
million animals, the world’s largest commercial herd, according
to the latest report by the country’s statistics agency,  IBGE .  A spokesman for JBS, who can’t be named because of internal
policy, declined to comment on the plant leasing. Carlos Silva,
as administrative manager at Guapore, didn’t immediately return
an e-mail from Bloomberg News seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
