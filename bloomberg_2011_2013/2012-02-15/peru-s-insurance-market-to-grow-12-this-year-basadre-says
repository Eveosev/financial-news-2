Peru’s insurance market will
probably grow 12 percent this year as economic growth boosts
incomes and spurs demand for policies, said Gonzalo Basadre,
chief executive offer at Interseguro Cia. de Seguros SA.  Insurance premiums are likely to total 8.1 billion soles
($3 billion) this year after rising 10 percent last year,
Basadre told reporters in  Lima  today.  Peru’s insurance market has “very big” growth potential
and should rise to the equivalent of 3 percent of gross domestic
product within five years, from 1.6 percent of GDP in 2011, he
said.  Interseguro, a unit of financial services group IFH Peru
Ltd., is the country’s fourth-largest insurer by assets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
