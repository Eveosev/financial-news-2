Ciceksepeti.com, the Turkish flower
delivery website that is 18 percent owned by  Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) ,
had record sales on Valentine’s Day yesterday with orders about
20 times the site’s daily average, founder Emre Aydin said.  The company shipped 60,000 orders and sold 600,000 roses it
imported from the Netherlands for the day, Aydin said in an
interview in Istanbul.  Ciceksepeti revenue may double this year and deliveries for
Mother’s Day, May 13, are likely to surpass those for
Valentine’s, Aydin said without giving a sales figure. The
company has about 90 percent of the online flower delivery
business in  Turkey , he said.  The company is looking at acquisitions of other gift
websites in Turkey, he said. Gifts and gourmet food will
probably rise to about 25 percent of total revenue by year end
from 12 percent today and may surpass flower sales “within a
few years,” he said.  Ciceksepeti.com, founded in 2006, received an investment
from Antwerp-based venture capital fund Hummingbird Ventures
last year, Aydin said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
