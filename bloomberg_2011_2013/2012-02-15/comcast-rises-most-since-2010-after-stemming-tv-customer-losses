Comcast Corp. (CMCSA) , the largest U.S.
cable company, climbed the most since 2010 after fourth-quarter
profit rose more than analysts estimated and video-customer
losses narrowed for the fifth straight period.  Comcast  jumped  4.7 percent to $28.52 at the close in  New
York , the largest intraday increase since September 2010. Shares
of the Philadelphia-based company have added 20 percent this
year and are trading near a five-year high.  The company lost 17,000 video subscribers in the quarter,
compared with 135,000 a year earlier. Analysts projected a drop
of 127,000, according to 11 estimates compiled by Bloomberg.
Comcast, facing competition from phone companies and Web-based
rivals such as  Netflix Inc. (NFLX) , improved  customer service  and let
users access more TV shows and movies on mobile devices,  Neil Smit , head of Comcast Cable, said on a conference call.  “A return to positive video subscriber growth --
unthinkable in consensus numbers as recently as six months ago -
- is now not only plausible, but arguably likely,”  Craig Moffett , a Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. analyst in New York with
an “outperform” rating on the stock, said in a note to
clients. “That’s a huge change.”  Customer Metrics  The number of video customers lost was the smallest since
the first quarter of 2007. Still, Smit said he doesn’t expect
positive net video additions in the first quarter of 2012.  Last quarter, the cable provider added 336,000 broadband
customers, higher than the average analysts’ estimate of
279,000, and 146,000 phone subscribers, in line with
projections.  Net income increased 26 percent to $1.29 billion, or 47
cents a share, compared with $1.02 billion, or 36 cents, a year
earlier. Analysts projected 42 cents a share on  average .  Sales rose to $15 billion, a 3 percent increase on a pro
forma basis, which assumes Comcast owned  NBC Universal  in the
fourth quarter of 2010. Comcast’s acquisition of NBC Universal
closed in January 2011. Cable-network revenue increased 5.3
percent to $2.21 billion.  Comcast also authorized a $6.5 billion stock buyback and
increased its annual  dividend  44 percent to 65 cents a share.  The buyback is a sign the company is committed to give back
to shareholders after  Time Warner Cable Inc. (TWC) , the second-largest
U.S. cable company, announced a $4 billion buyback plan last
month, according to Vijay Jayant, an analyst at ISI Group in New
York with a “buy” rating on the stock.  Comcast said $3 billion of the new repurchase program will
be made in 2012, up from $2.1 billion in last year.  NBC Revenue  Revenue at the NBC Universal unit climbed 0.8 percent.
Broadcast television revenue from NBC was $1.84 billion, down
3.7 percent. NBC continues to languish in fourth place behind
networks CBS, News Corp.’s Fox and Walt Disney Co.’s ABC.
Broadcast advertising revenue fell 6.5 percent in the quarter to
$1.26 billion.  Comcast is excited by the potential of “Smash” and “The
Voice” to help NBC ratings this year, according to Chief
Financial Officer Michael Angelakis. Many of the shows on the
2011 fall schedule were brought in under previous NBC Universal
management.  Stephen Burke  took over as head of NBC Universal in
January 2011 along with NBC entertainment chief  Robert Greenblatt .  To contact the reporter on this story:
