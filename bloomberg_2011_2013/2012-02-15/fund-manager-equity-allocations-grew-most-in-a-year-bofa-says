Investors increased the allocation
of funds towards equities by the most in a year this month, with
a net 44 percent “overweight” on emerging-market stocks
compared with 20 percent in January, according to a Bank of
America Merrill Lynch survey of fund managers.  “Investors are showing renewed confidence in global
equities amid radically improved market conditions and growing
hopes of economic growth,” according to the report dated
yesterday.  The bank surveyed 277 fund managers with $783 billion of
assets under management from Feb. 3 to Feb. 9, the report said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
