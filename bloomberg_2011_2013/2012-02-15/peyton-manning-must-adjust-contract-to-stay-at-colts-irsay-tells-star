Peyton Manning  will have to
renegotiate the $90 million, five-year contract he signed in
July to stay with the Indianapolis Colts, team owner  Jim Irsay 
told the  Indianapolis Star .  Manning, 35, sat out the 2011 National Football League
season after undergoing neck surgery, ending a streak of 227
consecutive starts.  “We’d love to have him back here if he can get healthy and
we can look at doing a contract that reflects the uncertainty of
the … healing process with the regeneration of the nerve,”
Irsay told the newspaper.  Manning is due a $28 million bonus by March 8 that
activates the final four years of his deal. Without the payment,
the four-time Most Valuable Player becomes an unrestricted free
agent.  Irsay replaced coach  Jim Caldwell  with Chuck Pagano on Jan.
16 and parted ways with 10 other coaches four days later after
the Colts went 2-14 without Manning, their worst performance in
20 years. The Colts have the first pick in the April draft and
are expected to take Stanford University quarterback  Andrew Luck , who is regarded as the No. 1 player available.  To contact the reporter on this story:
