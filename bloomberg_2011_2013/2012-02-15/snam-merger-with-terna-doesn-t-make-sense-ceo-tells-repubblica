A merger between Italian grid
manager  Terna Rete Elettrica Nazionale SpA (TRN)  and  Snam Rete Gas SpA (SRG) 
doesn’t make any sense, Snam Chief Executive Officer Carlo Malacarne told  la Repubblica  in an interview.  It would be easier for Snam to become Europe’s leading gas
grid manager once  Eni SpA (ENI) , Italy’s largest energy producer,
sells its 50 percent stake in the company, Malacarne was quoted
by the newspaper as saying.  The Italian government agreed to make Eni relinquish its
stake in Snam.  To contact the reporter on this story:
