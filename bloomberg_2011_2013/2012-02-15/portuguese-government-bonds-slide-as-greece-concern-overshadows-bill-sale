German bonds rose for a second day,
outperforming their European peers, as speculation  Greece  is
struggling to win a new bailout from international lenders
boosted demand for the region’s safest securities.  Two-year German  yields  dropped to the lowest level in a
week after Reuters reported a second aid package for Greece may
be delayed until after elections in April, citing European Union
sources. Spanish and Italian bonds dropped on concern the
turmoil in Greece will spread to the region’s larger economies.
Portuguese notes gained after the nation’s borrowing costs
declined at bill sales today.  Bunds are rising as a “reaction to delays over the second
bailout” for Greece, said  Brian Barry , an analyst at Investec
Bank Plc in London. “The prospect of a disorderly default is
becoming more real, with the possible implication that Greece
may be the first member state to leave the euro zone, which is
by definition venturing into unknown territory.”  The German 10-year yield fell four basis points, or 0.04
percentage point, to 1.86 percent at 4:07 p.m.  London  time. The
2 percent bond due in January 2022 gained 0.295, or 2.95 euros
per 1,000-euro ($1,308) face amount, to 101.165.  The two-year yield dropped three basis points to 0.22
percent after falling to 0.21 percent, the lowest since Feb. 7.  ‘Playing With Fire’  Europe’s wealthier nations are “playing with fire” by
considering the idea of expelling Greece from the euro area, the
country’s Finance Minister Evangelos Venizelos told reporters
today in  Athens . He leveled the accusation after a decision
slated for today on aid totaling 130 billion euros was postponed
until Feb. 20 at the earliest.  “There is pressure from several countries to hold off
until there is a concrete commitment from Greece, which may not
come until after they’ve held elections.” Reuters cited an EU
official briefed on a planned European finance ministers’
teleconference as saying.  Spanish 10-year  yields  climbed 15 basis points to 5.43
percent, increasing the spread over similar-maturity German
bunds by 19 basis points to 358 basis points. Italian 10-year
yields gained 16 basis points to 5.73 percent.  The cost of insuring European sovereign debt rose for a
sixth day on concern delays to Greece’s bailout are increasing
the chance of default. The Markit iTraxx SovX Western  Europe 
Index of credit-default swaps on 15 governments climbed 12 basis
points to a four-week high of 344. An increase signals
deterioration in perceptions of  credit quality .  Portugal Sale  Portugal ’s government debt agency sold bills maturing in
91-, 182-days and 371-days. The 12-month debt was the longest
maturity offered since the country requested a bailout from the
European Union and the  International Monetary Fund  in April last
year. The securities were issued at an average yield of 4.943
percent, compared with 5.902 percent when it last auctioned 12-
month debt on April 6.  Portugal’s five-year yields fell 13 basis points to 14.83
percent. Ten-year yields were little changed at 12.05 percent.  German bunds have returned 12 percent over the past year,
according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. Greek bonds tumbled
64 percent and Portuguese securities slid 16 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
