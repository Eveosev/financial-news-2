Sun Hung Kai Properties Ltd. (16)  paced
gains by  Hong Kong  developers in local trading after Bocom
International forecast an increase in home prices, fueling
expectations that low  interest rates  will boost demand.  Sun Hung Kai, Hong Kong’s biggest developer by market value,
rose as much as 5.5 percent to HK$120 and was trading at
HK$117.70 as of 10:16 a.m. local time. Henderson Land
Development Co., controlled by billionaire Lee Shau-kee, climbed
4 percent to HK$47.20 after gaining as much as 5.4 percent.  Hong Kong property prices will rise 10 percent this year,
while transaction volumes will rebound in the next three months,
Alfred Lau, a Hong Kong-based analyst at Bocom, said in a report
today. It follows a similar call by Nomura Holdings Inc., which
forecast a 10 percent gain in housing prices and 12.5 percent
increase in retail rents this year.  “Expectations that the low rates environment will continue
is helping sentiment improve,” said Eva Lee, a Hong Kong-based
analyst at UBS AG, in an interview today. “Investors are also
encouraged by signs that developers are trying to raise cash to
replenish their land bank.”  The city’s developers, led by Sun Hung Kai and Wharf
Holdings Ltd., are selling $6.18 billion of debt in 2012, the
busiest quarter on record, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Housing Comeback  Hong Kong’s housing market may be staging a rebound with
sales the past weekend increasing 43 percent. The city’s home
prices have fallen 6 percent since June and the government last
month recorded the second-lowest number of transactions since it
began collecting data in 1996, because of rising borrowing costs,
extra transaction taxes and higher down-payment requirements.  U.S. Federal Reserve officials said Jan. 25 benchmark
interest rates would probably remain below 1 percent through
2014. Interest rates in Hong Kong normally follow those set by
the U.S. as the city’s currency is pegged to the  U.S. dollar .  The  Hang Seng Property Index (HSP) , which tracks seven of the
biggest publicly traded developers in Hong Kong, climbed 2.6
percent, extending yesterday’s 3.3 percent advance.  Cheung Kong  (Holdings) Ltd., the developer controlled by  Li
Ka-shing , Hong Kong’s richest man, rose 2.5 percent to HK$111.80.
Sino Land Co. jumped 4.3 percent to HK$13.64.  To contact the reporters on this story:
