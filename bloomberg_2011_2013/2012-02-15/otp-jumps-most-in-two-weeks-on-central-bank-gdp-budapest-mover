OTP Bank Nyrt. (OTP) ,  Hungary ’s largest
lender, rallied the most in two weeks as data showed Hungary’s
economy expanded more than forecast in the fourth quarter and
the central bank pledged to boost lending.  The shares jumped as much as 5 percent and rose 2.4 percent
to 4,026 forint by the end of trading in Budapest, the biggest
gain since Feb. 1. The benchmark BUX stock  index , in which OTP
has an almost 30 percent weighting, gained 0.5 percent.  Gross domestic product increased 1.4 percent from a year
earlier, the statistics office in Budapest said today in a
preliminary estimate. The median forecast of 16 economists in a
Bloomberg survey was for a 0.9 percent increase. The central
bank announced a two-year collateralized credit facility, a
universal mortgage bond purchase plan and the expansion of the
range of eligible collateral to help commercial banks boost
lending.  “The new tools should decrease the current liquidity
constraints in the banking sector,” Zoltan Arokszallasi and
Orsolya Nyeste, Budapest-based economists at Erste Group Bank
AG, wrote in an e-mailed report. “The announcement is positive
for Hungarian markets.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
