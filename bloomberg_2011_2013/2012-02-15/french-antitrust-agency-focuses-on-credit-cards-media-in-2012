Payment methods, media concentration
and online retailing are priorities for  France ’s competition
regulator for 2012, with reports and decisions scheduled in each
area this year.  The Competition Authority will continue efforts on payment
methods, focusing now on fees associated with credit cards,
automatic withdrawals and transfers, president Bruno Lasserre
said today in Paris. The regulator has not decided whether to
pursue sanctions to achieve this, he said.  Banks challenged a 384.9 million euro-fine ($505 million)
on check fees levied in 2010, and the Paris appeals court should
rule soon on their bid to overturn the penalty, Lasserre said.
Lenders cut interbank fees on bank cards by as much as 36
percent to settle a probe last year.  The regulator, which gained merger-control powers in 2009,
will issue decisions this summer on  Vivendi SA (VIV) ’s  Canal Plus  pay-
television unit’s revisions to its 2006 deal with Television
Par Satellite, or TPS, and its offers to buy channels TNT Direct
and Direct Star. The authority revoked approval of the TPS
merger in September after finding Canal Plus hadn’t met the
conditions imposed to win the 2006 authorization.  The Competition Authority will report in June on its review
of the impact of online retailers on traditional store sales,
and the role third parties like shipping companies and payment
processors play in influencing Internet shoppers.  In March, the regulator will deliver interim findings in
its investigation into the rising cost of automobile repair and
maintenance.  To contact the reporter on this story:
