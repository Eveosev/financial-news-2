Orange-juice  futures rose for the
first time in seven sessions, as demand rebounded following the
longest slump since mid-November. Cotton advanced.  Before today, the price of orange juice had tumbled 19
percent since reaching a record $2.2695 a pound on Jan. 23 as
concerns eased that U.S. imports would be limited. On Feb. 9,
the U.S. Food and Drug Administration affirmed that domestic
orange juice can be “consumed without concerns about its
safety.” Futures surged to a record on Jan. 23 after the FDA
detained imports to test for carbendazim, a banned fungicide,
and as a citrus-greening disease threatened crops in Texas.  “Technically, the market got oversold,”  Boyd Cruel , a
senior analyst with Vision Financial Markets in  Chicago , said in
a telephone interview. The commodity “got support around $1.80,
March basis. But the volume is very light, it doesn’t take much
to move prices.”  Orange juice for March delivery rose 1.2 percent to settle
at $1.861 at 2 p.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in New York. The
commodity dropped 8.7 percent in the previous six sessions, the
longest slump since Nov. 14.  Cotton futures for May delivery rose 0.7 percent to 93.48
cents a pound on ICE, the fourth straight gain. Still, the fiber
has plunged 57 percent from a record $2.197 reached on March 7.  To contact the reporter on this story:
