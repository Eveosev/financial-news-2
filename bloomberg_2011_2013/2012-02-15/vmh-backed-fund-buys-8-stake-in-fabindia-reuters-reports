L Capital, a private equity fund
backed by  LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA (MC) , bought an 8
percent stake in India’s Fabindia Overseas Pvt. from Wolfensohn
Capital Partners, Reuters reported, citing two unidentified
people with direct knowledge of the matter.  The value and the terms of the deal weren’t immediately
available, according to the report. Wolfensohn Capital purchased
the stake in the closely held ethnic-wear chain in 2007 for
about $10 million, it said.  Ketaki Kiran Paranjpe, vice president at L Capital Mumbai
Advisory Services Pvt., and Prableen Sabhaney, a spokeswoman for
Fabindia, declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
