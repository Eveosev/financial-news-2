Ethanol production  in the U.S. rose
0.5 percent to 928,000 barrels a day last week, according to the
Energy Department.  Output climbed for the second time in six weeks. Stockpiles
surged 2 percent to a record 21.5 million barrels, the ninth
consecutive weekly gain and the longest such streak since the
department began tracking the data in June 2010, the report
showed.  Production of  conventional gasoline blended with ethanol 
gained 2.2 percent to 5 million barrels a day, the department
said, the highest level since Dec. 23.  Denatured ethanol for March delivery was unchanged at
$2.217 a gallon at 10:36 a.m. New York time on the Chicago Board
of Trade.  To contact the reporter on this story:
