U.S. mutual funds last week took in
the most money in almost two years as investors moved to take
part in the stock market rally.  Funds attracted $13.2 billion in deposits in the week ended
Feb. 8, the highest total since March 2010, the  Investment
Company Institute  said today in an e-mailed statement. Equity
funds won deposits of $3.62 billion, the most since February
2011, data from the Washington-based trade group show.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index yesterday closed about 1
percent below its peak nine months ago of 1363.61, which was the
highest level since June 2008. The index rose 7.4 percent  this
year through yesterday as the  U.S. economy  showed signs of
accelerating and European leaders move closer to a solution on
the region’s debt crisis.  “It seems like it takes both good headlines and good
market performance to bring people back to stocks,”  Russel Kinnel , director of mutual fund research at Chicago-based
 Morningstar Inc. (MORN) , said in a telephone interview. “Since 2008
people have been very tentative.”  Investors pulled $135 billion from domestic stock mutual
funds in 2011, the fifth straight year of withdrawals, according
to the ICI.  Domestic equity funds attracted $1.92 billion last week.
Funds that invest in international stocks won $1.7 billion. Bond
funds took in $7.05 billion, including $5.31 billion for the
taxable category and $1.74 billion for municipal bond funds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
