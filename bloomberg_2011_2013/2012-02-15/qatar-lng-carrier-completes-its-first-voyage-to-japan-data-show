A liquefied natural gas tanker that
usually shuttles between Qatar and the U.K. made its first trip
to  Japan , where the fuel costs almost twice as much, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The Zarga, owned by Qatar Gas Transport Co., arrived in
Nagoya, Japan, on Feb. 9, its first voyage to the Asian nation
since the ship was built in 2010, AISLive Ltd. ship-tracking
data compiled by Bloomberg show. In the past year, the vessel
has sailed six times to the U.K.â€™s Milford Haven terminal and
once to  China .  One million British thermal units of Qatari LNG costs
$17.12 in Japan, compared with $8.87 in the U.K., according to
January data from New York-based shipbroker Poten & Partners.
Accounting for costs to transport the fuel and convert it back
to gas, the return from shipping Qatari LNG to Japan is 138
percent higher, the figures show.  The vessel is under long-term charter to Qatar Liquefied
Gas Co., a venture between state-controlled Qatar Petroleum and
international  oil companies . A QatarGas spokeswoman and a Qatar
Gas Transport spokesman declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
