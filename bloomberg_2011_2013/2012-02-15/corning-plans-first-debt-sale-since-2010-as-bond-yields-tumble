Corning Inc. (GLW) , the largest maker of
glass for flat-panel television sets, sold $750 million of bonds
in its first offering in more than 18 months as borrowing costs
plunged to all-time lows for industrial companies.  Corning issued $250 million of 25-year, 4.7 percent bonds
and $500 million of 30-year, 4.75 percent debt, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Wells Fargo
& Co. are managing the sale, the company based in Corning, New
York, said today in a filing with the Securities and Exchange
Commission.  Yields on corporate bonds from Corning to International
Business Machines Corp. to AT&T Inc. have fallen to 3.242
percent, the lowest in data extending to December 1996,
according to the Bank of America Merrill Lynch U.S. Industrial
Corporates Index. Corning is rated A3 by Moody’s Investors
Service and a step lower, BBB+, by  Standard & Poor’s .  Corning’s 25-year bonds yield 165 basis points more than
similar-maturity Treasuries, and its 30-year debt pays a spread
of 170 basis points, Bloomberg data show. A basis point is 0.01
percentage point.  Proceeds from today’s offering may be used for general
corporate purposes, including repaying debt, financing
acquisitions, buying back stock and adding to working capital,
Corning said in the  SEC filing .  It last sold debt in August 2010, issuing $300 million of
4.25 percent notes maturing in 2020 and paying a 145 basis-point
spread, and $400 million of 5.75 percent bonds due in 2040 at
a spread of 175 basis points, Bloomberg data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
