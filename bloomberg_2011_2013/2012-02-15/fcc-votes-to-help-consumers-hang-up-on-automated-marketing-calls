The Federal Communications
Commission moved against automated telemarketing pitches that
have generated consumer complaints to the agency.  The FCC voted 3-0 today to require that banks, airlines,
insurance companies and telephone carriers obtain written
consent from consumers before sending the recorded marketing
messages known as robocalls.  “We’re closing loopholes that have allowed robocallers to
sneak through,” FCC Chairman  Julius Genachowski , a Democrat,
said as the agency considered the rule during its monthly
meeting in  Washington . “Consumers have complained to us by the
thousands.”  The vote harmonizes FCC rules with requirements set in 2008
by the Federal Trade Commission for other industries.  The changes won’t affect robocalls by political campaigns,
non-profit organizations and informational messages such as
notices about school closings, the FCC said as it proposed the
changes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
