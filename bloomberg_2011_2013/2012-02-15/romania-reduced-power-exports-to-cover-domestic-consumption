Romania limited its exports of
electricity to cover a rise in domestic consumption following
bad weather and freezing temperatures, the government said.  There is no problem meeting demand for electricity from
consumers and local companies, the government said today in an
emailed statement.  The Bucharest-based government approved yesterday a law
allowing it to reduce or interrupt electricity exports between
Feb. 16 and March 15.  To contact the reporter on this story:
