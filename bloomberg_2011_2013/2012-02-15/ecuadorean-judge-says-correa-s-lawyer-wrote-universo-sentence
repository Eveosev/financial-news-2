An Ecuadorean judge denied her role
in a court ruling that awarded President  Rafael Correa  $40
million for libel in July and said the statement was really
drawn up by the president’s own lawyer.  Monica Encalada said she played no part in the verdict that
sentenced the owners of the newspaper El Universo and a former
editor at the publication to three years in prison and awarded
the compensation to Correa, according to a statement posted
today on the newspaper’s website. The judge fled the country
last night, television station Ecuavisa said today.  Another judge in the case had previously said he drafted
the ruling with Encalada’s help. Correa, an ally of Venezuelan
President  Hugo Chavez , has drawn international criticism,
including from the New York-based Committee to  Protect
Journalists , for seeking the prison sentences. Encalada’s
statement backs up previous accusations made by El Universo’s
lawyers.  “I haven’t collaborated in any way, nor have I added even
half a word to the sentence that exists against El Universo,”
Encalada said in the statement.  Gutemberg Vera, one of Correa’s lawyers, drafted the
sentence and offered about $750,000 to another judge in the case
to rule in favor of the president, she said in the statement.  Vera responded by accusing Encalada of corruption and said
that if her claims are true, she committed a crime for not
speaking up sooner, according to a statement published in the
president’s official gazette.  To contact the reporter on this story:
