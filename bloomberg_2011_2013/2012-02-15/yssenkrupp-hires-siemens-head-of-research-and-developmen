ThyssenKrupp AG (TKA) ,  Germany ’s largest
steelmaker, said it’s hiring Reinhold Achatz of  Siemens AG (SIE)  as
head of corporate center, innovation and quality.  Achatz, who was Siemens’s research chief, will start at
Essen-based ThyssenKrupp on April 1, the company said,
confirming an earlier report by  Sueddeutsche Zeitung .  Siemens bundled responsibilities for software engineering
and development with corporate innovation in 2008, giving Achatz
oversight of both. The activities, overseen by board member
Klaus Helmrich since April 2011, will now undergo some
restructuring, spokesman Wolfram Trost said, without
elaborating.  ThyssenKrupp hired Heinrich Hiesinger, who has sat on
Siemens’s management board, as chief executive officer in
January 2011, fuelling speculation the two companies may move
closer together. Gerhard Cromme is chairman of the supervisory
boards at both companies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
