Goldman Sachs Group Inc. recommended
its clients exit the bets that the Mexican peso and the euro
will rise against the dollar, citing “significant
uncertainties” surrounding the  Greece  bailout negotiations.  The wagers on the euro and the peso have returned 0.3
percent and 2.9 percent, respectively, since Goldman recommended
them on Jan. 25, analysts led by London-based Thomas Stolper
wrote in a note.  “In the very near term, the risk-reward for our
recommendations has deteriorated,” the analysts said in the
report. “The compression in sovereign risk premia has run most
of its course. The next few weeks will see significant
uncertainties linked” to the Greek bailout negotiation, the
analysts wrote.  The euro fell for a fourth day, declining 0.5 percent to
$1.3068 as of 11:16 a.m. New York time. The peso dropped 0.3
percent to 12.7932 per dollar.  Goldman Sachs had expected the euro to rise to $1.38 and
the peso to advance to 12 per dollar when it made the
recommendations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
