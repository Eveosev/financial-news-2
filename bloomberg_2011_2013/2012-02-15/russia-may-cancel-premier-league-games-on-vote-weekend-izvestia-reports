Russia ’s Interior Ministry is asking
the government to cancel the 33rd round of the country’s soccer
Premier League games planned for March 3-5 because of extra
security precautions required during the March 4 presidential
election,  Izvestia  reported.  Russian police plan to deploy 94,000 officers to provide
security at polling stations and during the vote count, the
Moscow-based newspaper said, citing the ministry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
