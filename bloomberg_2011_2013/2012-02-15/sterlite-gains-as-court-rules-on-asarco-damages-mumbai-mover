Sterlite Industries (India) Ltd. ,
the nation’s largest copper producer, headed for the highest in
six months in Mumbai trading after a court ruling on the damages
to be paid for breaking an agreement to buy Asarco LLC.  The  shares  rose as much as 6.6 percent to 137.50 rupees,
the highest since Sept. 8, and traded at 134.30 rupees as of
12:31 p.m. The benchmark Sensitive Index gained 1.8 percent.  Grupo Mexico SAB (GMEXICOB) ’s Asarco unit, which sought $2.28 billion
in damages from Sterlite, will receive $82.8 million, according
to the ruling of U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Richard Schmidt in  Corpus
Christi , Texas. Billionaire Anil Agarwal-controlled Sterlite
walked away from an agreement to buy Arasco in 2008, citing a
decline in copper prices.  “The investors are happy that the issue is now of out of
the window,” said Abhisar Jain, an analyst at Centrum Broking
Pvt. in Mumbai, who has a “buy” rating on the stock.  Sterlite harmed Asarco by delaying its exit from bankruptcy,
Schmidt said. The judge reduced the damages because Grupo Mexico
and Sterlite waged a 2009 bidding war for Asarco, which  Grupo
Mexico  won.  The case is Asarco LLC v. Sterlite (USA) Inc., 10-02010,
 U.S. Bankruptcy Court , Southern District of Texas (Corpus
Christi).  To contact the reporter on this story:
