The following companies had unusual
price changes in Chilean trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of the close in Santiago.  The  Ipsa (IPSA)  index rose 1 percent to 4,477.48. The  MSCI Chile (MXCL) 
index advanced 0.8 percent to 2,585.86.  Australis Seafoods SA (AUSTRALI CC), a salmon exporter,
advanced 6.9 percent to 139 pesos, its biggest gain in almost
four months. Chile exported a record $2.9 billion of salmon and
trout last year, up 48 percent from 2010, as the industry
recovers from the impact of a virus that damaged fish stocks
beginning in 2008, La Tercera said, citing the country’s customs
agency.  Cia. Sud Americana de Vapores SA  (VAPORES CC),  Latin
America ’s largest container shipping company, increased 2.9
percent to 101.9 pesos, the biggest gain in three months. A
second rights issuance offer, part of a $1.2 billion capital
increase that the company says will shore up finances, ends
today. Vapores has raised $788 million so far from current
shareholders and third parties, according to a Jan. 25
statement.  Lan Airlines (LAN)   rose 1.6 percent to 13,064 pesos.
Latin America’s largest airline by market value will add 20 new
flight frequencies to the U.S.,  Mexico  and the Caribbean from
Santiago and  Lima  in the second half of the year, it said in an
e-mailed statement yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
