Austria’s economy contracted in the
fourth quarter after flagging global demand for goods and
services hurt the Alpine republic’s exporters, the state-
supported Wifo research institute said today.  Fourth-quarter gross domestic product, the value of goods
and services, fell 0.1 percentage point from the preceding three
months, Wifo said in an e-mail. Third-quarter growth was lowered
to 0.2 percentage points from the 0.3 percentage point expansion
that Wifo reported in December.  “The deterioration of the international economy shrank
domestic exports again,” Wifo said. Exports contracted 0.5
percentage points in the last three months of 2011 after
shrinking 0.2 percentage points in third quarter.  Wifo estimates that full-year GDP grew 3.1 percentage
points in 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
