Conditions in the dry-bulk shipping
market are likely to weaken this year as the supply of ships
expands faster than demand, according to RS Platou Economic
Research, a unit of  Norway ’s largest shipbroker.  The fleet of commodity carriers will swell by 11 percent to
12 percent this year, about double Platou’s forecasted expansion
of 5 percent to 6 percent in seaborne commodities trade.  “The fleet will grow at a higher rate than tonnage demand,
resulting in a further weakening of the market fundamentals,”
Bjorn Bodding, a senior partner at Platou Economic Research,
said in a report sent by e-mail today. “Any potential upsides
appear limited.”  The 14-member Bloomberg Pure Play Dry Bulk Shipping Index,
measuring the share prices of companies hauling raw materials,
declined 26 percent in the past year. The Baltic Dry Index,
a measure of freight rates, fell 41 percent over the same time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
