Citic Resources Holdings Ltd. (1205) , a
Chinese oil and coal producer with assets in Kazakhstan and
Australia, surged to a six-month high after saying it expects a
“material increase” in 2011 profit.  The stock  climbed as much as 9.9 percent to HK$1.33 in  Hong
Kong  and traded at HK$1.30 as of the noon local time break, set
for the highest level since Aug. 4. The benchmark  Hang Seng
Index  gained 2 percent.  Citic Resources said full-year profit will rise after the
sale of its stake in Macarthur Coal Ltd. and partial disposal of
interest in the Codrilla Deposit coal mine in Australia,
according to a statement to the Hong Kong stock exchange late
yesterday.  Better operating performances due to higher energy and
commodity prices and controls on operating expenses also helped,
the company said.  Citic Resources’s 2010 profit surged to HK$1.1 billion
($142 million) from HK$115.7 million of a year earlier, the
company said March 27, 2011.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
