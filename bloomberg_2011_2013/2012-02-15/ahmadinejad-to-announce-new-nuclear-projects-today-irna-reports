Iran  may announce progress on its
nuclear program today with President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad
unveiling several projects in a ceremony, the official  Islamic
Republic News Agency  reported.  The projects pursued by the Iranian scientists will
illustrate the slogan “nuclear energy for all and nuclear
weapons for none,” the IRNA report, published late yesterday,
said, without giving any details about the projects.  Iran says its nuclear program is purely civilian and aimed
at producing electricity for its growing population, a claim
that the U.S. and its allies reject.  Ahmadinejad said during a Feb. 11 ceremony marking the 33rd
anniversary of the  Islamic Revolution  that he will unveil
“major nuclear accomplishments” in the coming days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
