Television advertising for  Royal
Bank of Scotland Group Plc  saying the company and its NatWest
brand would “continue to provide banking services wherever
we’re the last bank in town” was banned by U.K. regulators.  A lawmaker and the  Campaign for Community Banking Services 
complained that there was at least one place, Farsley in
northern  England , where NatWest closed the town’s last bank, the
 Advertising Standards Authority  said in a  statement  on its
website.  The “misleading” ad “would be interpreted by viewers to
mean that NatWest would not close a branch where it was the last
one in its immediate locality,” the regulator said.  RBS said that although the Farsley branch closed, bank
services were still available at the NatWest in a nearby town,
and that the company’s promise of keeping banking services
available wasn’t a vow to keep branches open. Another closed
branch in Bettyhill, northern  Scotland , was later served by a
mobile bank, RBS said in the statement.  “We are proud of our commitment to offer services in towns
where other banks have closed, and we currently do this in 168
locations,” RBS said in an e-mailed statement when asked about
the ruling. “Our commitment is independently assessed by
Deloitte. While we disagree with the ASA’s decision, we welcome
their offer to work more closely with them in the future.”  -- Editors:  Keith Campbell , Stephen Taylor  To contact the reporter on this story:
