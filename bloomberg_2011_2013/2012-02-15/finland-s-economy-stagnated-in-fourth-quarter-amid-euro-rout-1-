Finland ’s economy stalled in the
fourth quarter as  Europe ’s deepening debt crisis hurt exports.  Gross domestic product, adjusted for seasonal variations,
was unchanged in the quarter, Helsinki-based Statistics Finland
said today, citing preliminary data. In the year, the economy
grew 0.7 percent.  “It would be unfathomable for such an export-led economy
to grow in this global environment,” said Tuulia Asplund, an
economist at Svenska Handelsbanken AB in Helsinki, by phone.  Europe’s sovereign debt crisis, now in its third year, is
sapping demand for exports from Finland, home to companies such
as Nokia Oyj. Exports make up about 40 percent of the
northernmost euro member’s economy and a third of the exports
are sold in the single-currency area.  Gross domestic product in  Germany , Europe’s largest
economy, fell 0.2 percent from the third quarter, when it
increased 0.6 percent, the Federal Statistics Office in
Wiesbaden said today. The data are adjusted for seasonal
effects.  Today’s quarterly data for Finland, calculated based on a
monthly trend indicator of output, is “indicative” of the
actual fourth-quarter GDP, Asplund said. The economy expanded
1.9 percent in December, accelerating from 1.3 percent in
November, the trend indicator showed.  Statistics Finland is scheduled to release fourth-quarter
GDP data on March 2.  To contact the reporter on this story:
