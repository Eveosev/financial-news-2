A Federal Reserve-sponsored advisory
panel formed to help devise ways to reduce risks and improve the
efficiency of the market for borrowing and lending securities
said further work was needed as the group concluded its efforts.  The Tri-Party Repo Infrastructure Reform Task Force
released today its final report describing a “target state”
for the industry and further changes needed to reduce risk in
this primary dealer funding market, according to a note on the
Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s  Website .  “The complex dependencies and relationships involved in
the tri-party repo infrastructure have made this collective
forum essential, although now it is time for this work to move
on to the next phase,” Darryll Hendricks, a managing director
at UBS AG and chairman of the task force, wrote in the note.
“At this time, the work that  BNY Mellon  and JPMorganChase, the
Fixed Income Clearing Corporation, dealers and lenders need to
complete to realize a target vision requires firm-specific
actions, rather than the idea generation and vetting that the
task force provided.”  The “target state” that the task force described as
necessary to insure that the market can function effectively and
efficiently, includes that secured credit for the settlement of
tri-party repo trades from clearing banks being capped at 10
percent of a dealer’s notional tri-party book, that non-maturing
trades not be unwound, and clear agreed upon common set of rules
to govern settlement prioritization.  To contact the reporter on this story:
