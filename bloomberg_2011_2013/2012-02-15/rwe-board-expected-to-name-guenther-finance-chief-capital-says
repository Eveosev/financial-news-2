RWE AG (RWE) ’s supervisory board is
expected to name Bernard Guenther as chief financial officer at
its Feb. 28 meeting, Capital reported, without saying how it got
the information.  Annett Urbaczka, a spokeswoman for RWE, declined to comment
on the report. Guenther, from RWE’s supply and trading unit, is
the favored candidate of Peter Terium, who takes over as chief
executive officer of  Germany ’s second-largest utility in July,
the magazine said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
