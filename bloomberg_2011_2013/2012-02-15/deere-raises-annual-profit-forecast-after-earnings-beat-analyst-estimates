Deere & Co. , the largest maker of
agricultural equipment, fell the most in more than four months
after lowering its forecast for U.S. farmer revenue, an
indicator of demand for its signature green-and-yellow machines.  Deere  dropped  5.4 percent to close at $84.28 in  New York ,
the biggest decline since Sept. 22.  Total U.S. farm receipts will be $371.9 billion in 2012,
down from a November forecast for $374.2 billion and lower than
the record $381.4 billion in 2011, as corn, wheat and soybean
prices decline, the Moline, Illinois-based company said today in
a  presentation  accompanying its fiscal first-quarter results.  “There is concern about moderation, if not peak, in
agricultural equipment,” Larry De Maria, a New York-based
analyst for William Blair & Co. who rates the shares “market
perform,” said today in a telephone interview.  Farm income in the U.S., Deere’s largest market, will fall
6.5 percent in 2012 from last year’s record $98.1 billion as
rising crop acreage and costs trim profits, the Department of
Agriculture said Feb. 13. U.S. demand for combines has slowed,
with retail sales dropping 50 percent in January from a year
earlier, the Association of Equipment Manufacturers said this
week.  ‘Increased Demand’  While 2012 U.S. farm cash receipts will be down slightly
from 2011, they’re “still extremely strong” and “translating
into increased demand,” Susan Karlix, a Deere spokeswoman, said
today on a conference call with analysts.  The company today reported first-quarter profit and
forecast 2012 earnings that topped analysts’ estimates. Net
income climbed 3.7 percent to $532.9 million, or $1.30 a share,
from $513.7 million, or $1.20. That exceeded the  average  $1.24-
a-share profit estimate of 18 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.
Sales advanced 11 percent to $6.77 billion, beating the average
estimate of $6.46 billion of 14 analysts.  Deere raised its fiscal 2012 profit forecast to about $3.28
billion from $3.2 billion previously. The average of 15
estimates was $3.18 billion. The company said sales of its farm,
forestry and construction machines will increase 15 percent for
the full year.  The farm-equipment industry’s sales in the U.S. and  Canada 
will rise about 10 percent in fiscal 2012, the higher end of
Deere’s previous forecast, as “overall conditions remain
positive and demand continues to be strong, especially for high-
horsepower equipment,” the company said.  ‘Favorable’ Conditions  Industrywide sales in the European Union will be up as much
as 5 percent on “favorable” conditions in the grain, livestock
and dairy sectors, Deere said. Its previous forecast was for
sales to be unchanged.  The U.S. and Canada together comprise Deere’s largest
market, followed by  Europe , according to the  company .  Chief Executive Officer Samuel R. Allen is seeking to boost
sales 56 percent to $50 billion by 2018 from a record $32
billion in fiscal 2011. The company also has a target to
increase the proportion of revenue from outside the U.S. and
Canada to 50 percent from 39 percent last year.  The company in the last year has introduced a record number
of tractors, combines and harvesters to court farmers overseas.
It has also announced plans to build seven factories in  China ,
 Brazil  and  India  that will produce farm and construction
equipment.  Agricultural equipment made up  76 percent  of fiscal 2011
sales while construction and forestry accounted for 17 percent.
Farm equipment sales increased 8 percent while construction and
forestry gained 22 percent in the quarter.  “Deere is starting to see some real end-market demand” in
construction, Andrew Kaplowitz, a New York-based analyst for
Barclays Capital Inc. who rates the shares “overweight/
positive.” “A lot has been replacement demand. The market is
starting to show improvements.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
