Democratic Republic  of Congo
approved more than $5.8 billion in investment last year, about
half of which came from the  mining industry , its National Agency
for Investment Promotion said in a statement.  Foreign direct investment accounted for about $2.96 billion
of the total, Otton Oligo, the agency’s approval department
manager, said by phone from Kinshasa, the capital. Actual
investment for the year was $5.3 billion, according to the
statement.  The agency, which promotes investment in Congo and is part
of the country’s Portfolio Ministry, approved $962 million in
telecommunications investments and $492 million for energy
production and distribution. Construction of hotels and
buildings accounted for $295 million in investments, according
to the statement.  Congo’s economy grew 7 percent last year, mainly on the
strength of high commodity prices, according to the  Finance
Ministry . The Central African country has about 4 percent of the
world’s cobalt reserves and produces around half its cobalt. The
investment figures take into account new investments as well as
diversification and modernization projects.  To contact the reporter on this story:
