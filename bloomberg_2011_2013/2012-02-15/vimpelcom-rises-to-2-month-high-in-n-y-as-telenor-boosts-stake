VimpelCom Ltd. rose the most in 21
months in the U.S. after  Telenor ASA (TEL)  increased its stake in the
company and withdrew all claims against other shareholders in a
pending arbitration.  VimpelCom, a mobile operator with more than 200 million
subscribers worldwide, rose 6.4 percent today, the most since
May 10, 2010, to settle at $11.98 in New York, bringing this
year’s advance to 27 percent. The stock lost 37 percent in 2011.  Telenor ASA said in a statement today that it bought 234
million VimpelCom Ltd. preferred shares from Weather Investments
II S.a.r.l. for $374.4 million, increasing its voting stake in
the company to about 36 percent.  Telenor also withdrew all its claims against Altimo
Holdings & Investments Ltd., Altimo Cooperatief U.A. and
 VimpelCom Ltd. (VIP)  in the pending arbitration, it said in a
statement.  “The stock moves on the removal of uncertainty,”  Luis Saenz , chief executive officer of the U.S. unit of Moscow-based
brokerage Otkritie Financial Corp, said by e-mail. “The fact
that Telenor dropped its claims also means that there will be no
pre-emptive rights for Telenor, therefore no further dilution to
the minorities.”  Telenor could convert the stock to ordinary shares by
paying the full market price to VimpelCom starting from 2013,
Saenz said.  Calls to the office phone of VimpelCom spokeswoman Elena Prokhorova in Moscow after business hours weren’t answered.  To contact the reporter on this story:
