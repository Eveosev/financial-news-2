Warren Buffett ’s  Berkshire Hathaway
Inc. (BRK/A)  may face challenges after its energy unit announced that it
will finance renewable projects,  Standard & Poor’s  said.  “The solar industry, amid falling panel prices, sluggish
power consumption, and company consolidations, is cheering the
announcement as evidence that solar-generation technology is
attracting capital from mainstream energy players,” Anne Selting, a credit analyst for S&P, said in a statement today.  The MidAmerican Energy Holding Co. unit of Omaha, Nebraska-
based Berkshire “has built its reputation on acquiring stable,
regulated integrated electric and gas utilities,” she said.
MidAmerican established a new business to aid investments in
unregulated renewable generation, including wind, geothermal,
solar and hydroelectric projects, the company said in a Jan. 24
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
