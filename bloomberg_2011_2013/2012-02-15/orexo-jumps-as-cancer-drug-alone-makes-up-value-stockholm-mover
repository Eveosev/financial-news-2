Orexo AB (ORX)  rose the most in 13 months
in Stockholm trading after a business magazine recommended
investors buy the stock because the Swedish biotech company’s
cancer pain medicine alone is worth the market value.  Orexo rose as much as 13 percent, the biggest gain since
Jan. 10, 2011. The stock rose 2.30 kronor, or 9.8 percent, to
25.80 kronor as of 3:11 p.m., local time.  Magazine  Affarsvarlden , which said it normally avoids
recommending biotech shares because of the risks involved, said
it will make an exception for Orexo because the company already
has four products on the market. In addition to cancer pain
medicine Abstral, the Uppsala, Sweden-based company has licensed
sales of sleep medication Edluar and two products for diagnosing
gastric ulcer bacteria. Orexo also sold the sales rights for a
rhinitis treatment to  Meda AB (MEDAA)  in 2008 and will receive a $15
million payment on U.S. marketing approval.  “If Abstral faces the harvesting time that most signs
point toward, the company’s market value can be justified based
on that medicine alone,” Affarsvarlden said today. “The rest
of the company is then effectively valued at nothing.”  The rhinitis treatment is currently awaiting final test
studies conducted by Meda.  To contact the reporter on this story:
