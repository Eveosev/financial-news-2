Hundreds of Hong Kong people 
attracted by instant fourfold returns lined up overnight for 
banknotes commemorating the Bank of China Ltd.’s 100th 
anniversary.  People were seen selling the special HK$100 notes, sold by 
the bank at HK$150 ($19.35) each, for as much as HK$700 apiece 
outside the lender’s Central district headquarters yesterday. 
Customers were restricted to buying two notes each. (Source:
