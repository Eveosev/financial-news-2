Three mine workers are missing after
a mudslide buried buildings at a mine in  Peru â€™s northern Andes,
Andina  reported .  The mudslide was triggered by heavy rains that caused a
lake to overflow in the early hours of this morning in the Llapo
district of Ancash, the state news agency said, citing
preliminary police reports.  Citing local health officials, Radio Programas  reported  on
its website that at least 25 people may be missing at the San
Juan mine.  To contact the reporter on this story:
