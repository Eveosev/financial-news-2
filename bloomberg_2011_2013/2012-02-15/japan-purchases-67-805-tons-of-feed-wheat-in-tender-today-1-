Japan  bought 67,805 metric tons of
feed wheat today through a tender system introduced to loosen
government grain-import controls, the Ministry of Agriculture,
Forestry and Fisheries said.  Shipment must be made by May 31, Masafumi Otsuka at the
ministry’s grain-trade division said today by phone. A breakdown
of the countries of origin wasn’t available, he said.  The ministry, which holds feed-grain import tenders every
Wednesday, plans to hold its next tender on Feb. 22 for a
maximum of 100,000 tons of wheat and 200,000 tons of barley. The
tender is held under the so-called simultaneous buy-and-sell
system.  To contact the reporter on this story:
