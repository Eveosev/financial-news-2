Azerbaijan’s State Oil Fund, known
as Sofaz, will invest in stocks this year as it seeks to
increase returns and diversify its holdings, according to the
fund’s 2012 investment plan.  Equities can make up 5 percent of the investment portfolio,
Sofaz said in a report on its  website  yesterday. The fund plans
to hire foreign managers to oversee its equity investments.  Sofaz, established in 1999 to manage state income from oil
and natural gas sales, saw its assets grow 31 percent last year
to $29.8 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
