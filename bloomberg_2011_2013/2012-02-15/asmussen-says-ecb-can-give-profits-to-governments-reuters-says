European Central Bank Executive
Board member Joerg Asmussen said policy makers can transfer any
profits from Greek bond holdings to euro-area governments, which
can then use the money to help  Greece , Reuters reported, citing
an email interview.  Asmussen said while the ECB can’t contribute directly to a
Greek aid package, governments could decide to use distributed
profits to help finance a bailout, according to  Reuters .  “If there should be a profit, we will pass it onto the
national central banks, as foreseen by our statutes,” Asmussen
is quoted as saying. “Then the  member states  can decide to use
this as a contribution to finance the Greek program.”  Asmussen said Greece can meet the conditions for a bailout
and finance ministers will be able to approve the aid package at
a meeting planned for Feb. 20, Reuters said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
