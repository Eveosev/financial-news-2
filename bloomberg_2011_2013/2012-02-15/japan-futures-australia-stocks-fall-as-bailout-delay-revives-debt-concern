Japanese  stock   futures  and
Australian equities fell after a decision on a second bailout
for Greece was postponed, reviving concern about  Europe ’s
sovereign-debt crisis.  American depositary receipts of  Canon Inc. (7751) , the world’s
biggest camera maker that gets 32 percent of its revenue in
Europe, fell 0.9 percent. ADRs of  Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group
Inc. (8306) , Japan’s largest lender, slid 1.4 percent.  BHP Billiton
Ltd. (BHP) , the world’s No. 1 mining company, lost 1.8 percent after
metal prices dropped.  Futures on Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average  expiring in
March closed at 9,235 in Chicago yesterday, down from 9,270 in
 Osaka , Japan. They were bid in the pre-market at 9,230 in Osaka
at 8:05 a.m. local time. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index fell 1.1
percent today. New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index was little changed in
Wellington.  “There’s a persistent concern that creditors may have to
pardon parts of debt not only for  Greece , but also for other
South European nations,” said Toshiaki Iwasaki, an analyst at
Mito Securities Co. “Technical indicators show Japan’s stocks
are being overbought, and we should see a sell-off as investors
take profits.”  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  dropped 0.1
percent today. The index slid 0.5 percent in  New York  yesterday
as European officials delayed a decision on a 130-billion euro
($170 billion) bailout for Greece until at least Feb. 20 and
possibly until after Greek elections later in the year.  Fed Minutes  U.S. stocks also declined after the release of minutes of
the Federal Reserve’s meeting last month showed policy makers
were divided on additional asset purchases to spur economic
growth.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  gained 11.8 percent this year
through yesterday, compared with a 6.8 percent advance by the
 S&P 500  and an 8 percent gain by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.
Stocks in the Asian benchmark are valued at 14.5 times estimated
earnings on average, compared with 12.9 times for the S&P 500
and 10.9 times for the Stoxx 600.  Aluminum Corp of China Ltd. led gains among state-
controlled companies traded in the U.S. as China pledged to help
Europe overcome its debt crisis. The Bloomberg China-U.S. 55
Index of the most-traded Chinese stocks in the U.S. gained 0.9
percent to 107.52 yesterday in New York, the highest level since
