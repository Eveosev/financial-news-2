Spain’s business lobby praised the
government’s overhaul of  labor laws , while unions called rallies
across the country to protest lower firing costs and new rules
making it easier for companies to cut wages.  “The government has taken the bull by the horns,” Juan Rosell, chairman of the CEOE business association, told a
televised news conference today in Madrid. “It’s a
modernization.”  The two month-old People’s Party government passed a decree
on Feb. 10 that cuts severance pay, makes it easier for
companies to reduce wages, and creates a new type of contract
for small companies. The government, which came to power on
pledges to create jobs, is trying to reduce the highest jobless
rate in the European Union, at almost 50 percent among young
people.  Spain ’s two largest unions, Comisiones Obreras and Union
General de Trabajadores, called protests today in 57 Spanish
towns and cities for Feb. 19. The decree was “conceived to
satisfy businessmen and financial markets,” is “unjust” to
workers, and won’t create jobs, Comisiones Obreras said in a
statement.  Even though the measure won’t produce new jobs “the day
after tomorrow,” it will help in the medium term, Rosell said.
Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy  also said today that the steps
taken by his government won’t have immediate effects. Spain’s
unemployment rate was  23  percent in December, and a third of the
euro region’s jobless live in Spain, according to data from the
EU’s statistics institute.  To contact the reporter on this story:
