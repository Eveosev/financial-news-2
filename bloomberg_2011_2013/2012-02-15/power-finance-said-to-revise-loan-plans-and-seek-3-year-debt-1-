Power Finance Corp. (POWF)  has approached
banks for a three-year loan after initially seeking to borrow
for five years, according to three people familiar with the
matter.  The state-owned Indian lender to power projects revised its
loan plans after receiving feedback from banks on the cost of
borrowing for a longer duration, the people said, asking not to
be identified as details are private. The company is seeking
 Reserve Bank  of  India  approval for its revised plans, the people
said.  R. Nagarajan, Power Finance’s New Delhi-based finance
director, didn’t answer three calls to his mobile today seeking
comment on the loan.  India’s government  restricts  the amount and terms of
foreign loans for companies. While it raised the cap on foreign
borrowings that don’t need approvals to $750 million from $500
million in September, so-called external commercial borrowings
greater than the equivalent of $20 million have a mandatory
minimum average maturity of five years.  Power Finance borrowed $260 million for six years in March
last year and agreed to a margin of 165 basis points more than
the London interbank offered rate, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporters on this story:
