The zloty pared its advance against
the euro after Polish Finance Minister Jacek Rostowski said the
government will limit sales of foreign currencies from European
Union funds on the market in the second and third quarter.  The zloty traded 0.1 percent stronger at 4.1793 per euro as
of 12:08 p.m. in Warsaw. It traded as strong as 4.1642 before
Rostowski made his comment to reports in parliament.  To contact the reporter on this story:
