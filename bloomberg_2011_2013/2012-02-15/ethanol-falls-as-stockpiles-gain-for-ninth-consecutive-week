Ethanol futures fell for a second
day in  Chicago  after a government report showed a record ninth
straight weekly gain in  inventories .  Prices declined 0.8 percent. The Energy Department said
ethanol stockpiles rose 2 percent to an all-time high of 21.5
million barrels last week.  Production (DOETFETH)  slipped 0.5 percent to
928,000 barrels a day.  “We continue to build stocks and it’s an issue,” said
Mike Blackford, a consultant at INTL FCStone in  Des Moines ,
 Iowa . “Everybody sees what’s out there.”  Denatured ethanol for March delivery fell 1.7 cents to
$2.196 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade, the lowest level
since Feb. 6. Prices are down 10 percent from a year ago.  In cash market trading, ethanol was unchanged in  New York 
at $2.29 a gallon, in Chicago at $2.18, in the U.S. Gulf at
$2.235 and on the West Coast at $2.29 a gallon, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol is blended with gasoline to augment supply and meet
federal mandates.  There are 209 ethanol distilleries in the U.S., with the
capacity to produce 14.8 billion gallons of the biofuel,
annually, according to the  Renewable Fuels Association , a
Washington-based trade group.  To contact the reporter on this story:
