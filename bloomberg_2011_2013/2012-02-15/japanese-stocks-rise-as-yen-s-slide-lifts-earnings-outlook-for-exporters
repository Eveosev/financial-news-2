Japanese  stocks  rose, sending the
 Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average to a six-month high, as a falling yen
boosted the earnings outlook for exporters. Elpida Memory Inc.
touched its lowest price in almost eight years after the debt-
laden chipmaker said it may not survive.  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) , the world’s biggest carmaker by market
value, climbed 4.7 percent as the yen fell against the dollar
after the  Bank of Japan  expanded an asset purchase program.
 Tokio Marine (8766)  Holdings Inc. jumped 5.7 percent after insurer
maintained its full-year profit forecast as rivals cut their
outlooks. Elpida plunged as much as 21 percent, touching its
lowest price since November 2004, after saying it hasn’t secured
financing to stay in business as an  April debt deadline  nears.  The  Nikkei 225  advanced 2.3 percent to 9,260.34 at the 3
p.m. close in  Tokyo , its highest close since Aug. 5. The broader
 Topix (TPX)  Index increased 2 percent to 802.96, with more than three
stocks rising for each that fell.  “The BOJ’s monetary easing was a positive surprise,
depreciating the yen and boosting Japanese stocks,” said
 Masayuki Kubota , who helps manage about $1.7 billion at Daiwa SB
Investments Ltd. “The markets’ real concern is if the Greek
issues spread to Italy or Spain. As long as those two countries
take steps toward solving their debt problems, the markets are
alright, even if Greece has a hard landing.”  China Involvement  Shares extended gains after People’s Bank of China Governor
Zhou Xiaochuan said today that the country will help resolve
 Europe ’s debt crisis by investing in bailout bonds that could
help stabilize its largest export market.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 0.5 percent
today. The gauge lost 0.1 percent in  New York  yesterday after
U.S. retail sales rose less than expected. Stocks pared a
decline of as much as 0.8 percent on optimism  Greece  will commit
to budget cuts needed to secure a second bailout. Stocks also
fell after U.S. retail sales rose less than expected.  In Europe, leaders of Greece’s two biggest political
parties today are expected to provide European leaders written
commitments to back austerity measures needed to secure aid, a
government official said yesterday. Finance ministers canceled a
Brussels meeting slated for today and will hold a teleconference
instead to prod Greece to clinch the 130 billion euro ($170
billion) rescue package.  Exporters Surge  “Expectations are mounting that another bailout for Greece
will be executed soon,” said  Hiroichi Nishi , an equities
manager in Tokyo at SMBC Nikko Securities Inc. “The yen is
retreating and the world is moving toward more monetary easing
as shown by the BOJ, supporting equities.”  Exporters rallied as the yen touched 78.67 per dollar today,
the lowest since Nov. 1. Demand for  Japan ’s currency fell
yesterday after the central bank unexpectedly expanded its bond
purchase program to bolster growth. A weaker yen boosts the
overseas earnings of Japanese companies.  Toyota climbed 4.7 percent to 3,265 yen.  Sony Corp. (6758) ,
Japan’s biggest exporter of consumer electronics, advanced 5.7
percent to 1,575 yen.  Fanuc Corp. (6954) , a maker of industrial robots,
increased 4.3 percent to 14,020 yen.  Tokio Marine, Medipal  Tokio Marine jumped 5.7 percent to 2,157. The insurer
maintained its full-year net income forecast of 10 billion yen
even after rivals predicted losses on damage claims stemming
from Thailand’s floods. Nomura Holdings Inc. raised its target
price on the stock to 2,710 yen from 2,500 yen, keeping its
“buy” rating.  Medipal Holdings Corp. (7459)  gained 5.6 percent to 966 yen, set
for its highest close since October 2010, after saying it will
spend as much as 10 billion yen ($127.4 million) buying back
shares.  The  Topix (TPX)  has rallied 10 percent since the beginning of the
year on signs the  U.S. economy  is improving, amid bets central
banks will ease monetary policy to spur growth, and on optimism
Europe will contain its debt crisis. Of the 1,540 companies on
the gauge that reported earnings since Jan. 9, 272 missed
analysts’ estimates, while 138 surpassed expectations, data
compiled by Bloomberg showed.  Elpida ‘Uncertainty’  Among stocks that declined, Elpida dropped 14 percent to
320 yen after earlier touching 294 yen, its lowest since
November 2004. The company said there is “uncertainty” about
its future as it hasn’t reached a financing deal with the trade
ministry, the  Development Bank  of Japan and its main lenders.  The Tokyo-based chipmaker’s ability to repay 92 billion yen
in bonds and loans by an April deadline is made more difficult
by plunging chip prices and five straight quarters of losses.  “The chip industry is in trouble,” said Edwin Merner,
president of Tokyo-based Atlantis Investment Research, which
manages $300 million. “Most commodity-type chip companies are
losing money and the business continues to be capital
intensive.”  Yahoo Japan Corp. (4689) , the operator of Japan’s most-visited
Internet portal, sank 3.7 percent to 25,070 yen. Yahoo Inc.’s
discussions to sell its stake in Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and
its Japanese operations in a tax-efficient manner have reached
an impasse, according to a person briefed on the matter.  The  Nikkei 225 Volatility Index  rose 4.9 percent to 20.54,
indicating traders expect a swing of about 5.9 percent on the
benchmark gauge over the next 30 days.  To contact the reporters on this story:
