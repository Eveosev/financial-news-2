Virgin Mobile (VM) , the cellular-phone
unit of U.K. billionaire  Richard Branson ’s Virgin Group, plans
to invest $300 million in  Latin America  over five years to
become the region’s biggest mobile virtual network operator.  Virgin Mobile Latin America expects to begin offering
service in Chile and Colombia this year before moving into
 Brazil ,  Argentina ,  Mexico  and Peru, the company’s chief
executive officer, Peter Macnee, said in an interview in Bogota.
Virgin will buy network space from other operators to avoid
having to build its own infrastructure, Macnee said.  The company has an agreement to purchase network space from
 Telefonica SA (TEF) ’s Movistar unit in Colombia and has reached a
marketing accord with  Valorem SA (VALOREM) ’s Cine Colombia movie-theater
unit, part of the holding company assembled by late Colombian
billionaire Julio Mario Santo Domingo. Virgin will win
subscribers with marketing that emphasizes  customer service  and
uses social media to attract younger customers, Macnee said.  “When you have a high penetration, the challenge for a big
network operator is to be all things to all people,” Macnee
said. “So when they partner with someone like us, we focus on
one thing. We focus on the youth.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
