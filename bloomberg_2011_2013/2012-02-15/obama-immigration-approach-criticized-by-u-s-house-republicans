The Obama administration isn’t doing
enough to crack down on illegal  immigration  and its focus on
deporting those with criminal records is too narrow, U.S. House
Republican lawmakers said.  During a hearing today before the House Appropriations
homeland security subcommittee, Republicans told Homeland
Security Secretary  Janet Napolitano  that she’s neglecting to
remove from the U.S. the majority of illegal immigrants who are
law-abiding.  “It does sound like the administration has implemented de
facto amnesty,” said Representative John Culberson, a Texas
Republican.  Representative Bob Aderholt, an Alabama Republican, said:
“This administration chooses to apply the term ‘priorities’ as
a convenient excuse to avoid enforcing our immigration laws.”  Congress provides money for deporting 350,000 to 400,000
people a year among an estimated 10 million to 11 million who
are in the country illegally, Napolitano said. The
administration has decided to give priority to removing those
who pose a danger or are national security threats.  The administration is reviewing more than 280,000
deportation cases in an effort to drop those involving people
whose only crime may have been crossing the border illegally.
Last month, the administration urged the closing of 1,600 such
cases.  To contact the reporter on this story:
