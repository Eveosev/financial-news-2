Turkey ’s parliament will start
debate tomorrow on a proposal that would require prosecutors
seeking to investigate intelligence officials to get approval
from the prime minister, Hurriyet  reported .  The justice committee in the Ankara parliament approved the
draft law after a nine-hour debate yesterday, with opposition
lawmakers saying it is aimed at covering up crimes, the
Istanbul-based newspaper reported.  The bill was submitted after Hakan Fidan, the head of
Turkey’s National Intelligence Organization, defied a special
prosecutor’s request that he testify in a probe into the urban
arm of the Kurdistan Workers’ Party, or PKK.  To contact the reporter on this story:
