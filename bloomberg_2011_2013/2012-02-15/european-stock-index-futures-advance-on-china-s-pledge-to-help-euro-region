European stocks  rose as China said
it will help resolve the region’s debt crisis and companies from
 BNP Paribas SA (BNP)  to  Heineken (HEIA)  NV reported earnings that beat
analysts’ estimates.  BNP Paribas,  France ’s largest bank, climbed 4.1 percent and
and Heineken, the world’s third-biggest brewer, rose 3.7
percent.  Clariant (CLN)  AG advanced 5.7 percent after earnings
exceeded projections and the chemical maker said it may sell its
textile and paper units.  The Stoxx  Europe  600 Index added 0.6 percent to 264.16 at
the close of trading, paring an earlier gain of 1 percent amid
speculation a Greek aid package could be delayed until after
April elections. The  gauge  has rallied 8 percent this year as
U.S. economic data improved and optimism grew that the euro area
will contain its sovereign-debt crisis.  “China has pledged to contribute to the bailout fund,
which not only could increase the firepower available but might
also persuade other countries like  Japan ,  Russia , oil-rich
states and possibly even the U.S. to actively take part in
combating the crisis,” said Markus Huber, head of German sales
trading at ETX Capital in  London .  China  offered to invest in Europe’s bailout funds and
sustain its holdings of euro assets. The commitment offers an
incentive to European finance ministers, who are increasing
pressure on  Greece  to deliver budget cuts in exchange for a
second bailout.  China Assistance  “China will always adhere to the principle of holding
assets of EU sovereign debt,” People’s Bank of China Governor
Zhou Xiaochuan said in a speech in Beijing today. “We would
participate in resolving the euro debt crisis,” he said,
echoing comments by Premier  Wen Jiabao  yesterday.  National benchmark indexes gained in 12 of the 18 western
European markets today. France’s CAC 40 and  Germany ’s DAX rose
0.4 percent each, while the U.K.’s FTSE 100 slipped 0.1 percent.
Greece’s  ASE (ASE)  sank 5.1 percent for the biggest two-day decline
since November as  National Bank of Greece SA (ETE)  tumbled 11 percent.  Euro-area finance ministers postponed a decision slated for
tonight on Greek aid totaling 130 billion euros ($171 billion)
until at least Feb. 20 and possibly until after a full-time
government emerges from the nation’s elections later this year.
Greek Finance Minister Evangelos Venizelos said that Europe’s
wealthier countries are “playing with fire” by toying with the
idea of expelling it from the euro area.  Economy Shrinks  Europe’s economy shrank less than economists forecast in
the fourth quarter after better-than-predicted performance in
Germany and France. Gross domestic product in the 17-nation euro
area fell 0.3 percent from the prior three months, the first
drop since the second quarter of 2009, the European Union’s
statistics office said today.  BNP Paribas rallied 4.1 percent to 34.89 euros as fourth-
quarter net income declined to 765 million euros from 1.55
billion euros a year earlier. That beat the 587 million-euro
average estimate of 10 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Bank shares  were the top gainers in the Stoxx 600, adding
1.7 percent as a group.  Societe Generale (GLE)  SA rose 2.2 percent to
22.38 euros after three days of losses, while HSBC Holdings Plc
increased 2.6 percent to 575.9 pence.  Banca Monte dei Paschi di
Siena SpA (BMPS)  rallied 11 percent to 33.64 euro cents and  UniCredit
SpA (UCG)  climbed 2.2 percent to 4.16 euros.  Heineken advanced 3.7 percent to 37.90 euros after the
brewer reported increased annual profit and unveiled new cost-
saving targets. Earnings before interest and taxes in 2011 rose
2.8 percent to 2.7 billion euros, excluding some one-time items,
the Amsterdam-based maker of Amstel said.  Clariant Climbs  Clariant gained 5.7 percent to 13.1 Swiss francs after
saying it may sell or find other strategic options for business
units generating 1 billion francs ($1.09 billion) in revenue as
it moves away from commodity products. Finding the right option
for the textile-chemical, paper specialties and emulsions units
is a mid- to long-term goal, the Muttenz, Switzerland-based
company said today.  Danone (BN)  advanced 1.9 percent to 49.91 euros, the highest
since October. The world’s biggest yogurt maker reported a 4.5
percent gain in 2011 earnings, helped by growth in infant
nutrition and bottled water products.  TUI AG (TUI1) , the owner of Europe’s largest travel company, rose
3.5 percent to 6.43 euros after saying it will sell a stake in
Hapag-Lloyd and may dispose of its remaining holding in the
shipper in an initial public offering.  ING Increases  ING Groep NV (INGA)  added 2.2 percent to 6.71 euros.  Capital One
Financial Corp. (COF) ’s planned purchase of ING’s U.S. online bank won
approval from the Fed, clearing the way for the credit-card
lender to add about $80 billion in deposits.  Puma SE rose 3.1 percent to 247.25 euros after Europe’s
second-largest sporting goods maker reported profit that beat
analysts’ estimates and its own projection and forecast growth
in sales and earnings in each of the next two years. Rival
 Adidas AG (ADS)  gained 2.6 percent to 59.26 euros.  TomTom NV (TOM2) , Europe’s biggest maker of portable navigation
devices, soared 7.1 percent to 4.20 euros after saying it plans
to introduce the HD Traffic service to China.  National Bank of Greece, the country’s largest lender, sank
11 percent to 2.54 euros, dropping for a second day. Alpha Bank
SA and EFG Eurobank Ergasias plunged 14 percent to 1.45 euros
and 16 percent to 98 euro cents, respectively.  Swisscom AG (SCMN) ,  Switzerland ’s biggest phone company, fell 1.9
percent to 360.60 francs after predicting lower revenue in 2012
and posting its first quarterly loss in almost a decade on a
writedown of Italian fixed-line unit Fastweb SpA.  PSA Peugeot Citroen lost 7 percent to 14.06 euros, erasing
an earlier gain of 4.5 percent. The French automaker must “scale
back” costs and planned investments to reduce debt, Chief
Executive Officer Philippe Varin said in an interview with
France’s Le Monde newspaper.  “We need to scale back because our debt has risen from 1.6
billion euros in June 2011 to 3.4 billion euros at the end of
2011, that’s far too much,” he was cited as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
