Iraq  will ship 19 cargoes of  Basrah
Light (ZOSPBLAS)  crude for loading in the second half of February from the
 Persian Gulf , two more than in the first half of this month,
according to a loading program obtained by Bloomberg News.  A total of 30.06 million barrels, or 2.15 million barrels a
day, will be loaded from Basrah Oil Terminal, the plan shows.
The schedule comprises 10 cargoes of 2 million barrels each, two
shipments of 1.9 million barrels, five 1 million-barrel lots and
two 630,000 barrel consignments.  Basrah Light has a density of 30.2 degrees on the American
Petroleum Institute scale and a sulfur content of 2.92 percent,
according to BP Plc. That makes it a so-called medium sour
crude, which yields less higher-value products such as gasoline
and diesel compared with benchmark Dated Brent.  Loading programs are schedules of crude shipments compiled
by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan their
supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
