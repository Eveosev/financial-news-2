Toyota Motor Corp. (7203)  led automakers
with the fewest problems reported by owners of its three-year-
old cars, while Ford Motor Co. and  General Motors Co. (GM)  brands
were among the most improved, according to J.D. Power &
Associates.  Toyota’s Lexus luxury brand topped the industry, its Toyota
and Scion brands placed in the top five, and the automaker had
the most models lead their respective segments for the seventh
consecutive year, J.D. Power said today in a  statement . Strides
by Ford’s namesake brand and GM’s Cadillac and  Chevrolet  helped
the industry average for problems per 100 vehicles fall to the
lowest in the study’s 22-year history.  Automakers’ brand image and their ability to retain buyers
are affected by the dependability of their vehicles, according
to  Westlake Village , California-based  J.D. Power . The industry
averaged 132 problems per 100 vehicles from the 2009 model year,
down from  151  in last year’s study and  155  the year before. Of
the 32 brands in this year’s survey, 25 improved from a year
earlier.  “This is good news both for owners -- who are holding onto
their vehicles for longer than ever -- and manufacturers, since
perception of quality and dependability is a critical factor in
vehicle purchase decisions,” David Sargent, J.D. Power’s vice
president of global automotive research, said in the statement.  Toyota’s Lexus brand owners reported 21 percent fewer
problems per 100 vehicles. The brand topped the industry for the
first time since 2008, with 86 problems per 100 vehicles. The
Toyota City, Japan-based automaker’s Scion brand also reduced
problems per 100 vehicles by one third, the biggest percentage
improvement in this year’s survey.  Ford, Cadillac  Ford (F) ’s namesake-brand vehicle owners reported 11 percent
fewer problems per 100 vehicles to 124, the eighth-lowest among
in the industry, and its Lincoln luxury brand placed seventh at
116. The Dearborn, Michigan-based automaker had three models
rank at the top of their segment, behind only Toyota, which had
eight.  GM’s Cadillac improved with 20 percent fewer problems per
100 vehicles at 104, vaulting the Detroit-based automaker’s
luxury brand to third in the industry behind Lexus and  Porsche
AG (PAH3) ’s namesake with 98. GM’s Chevrolet brand owners reported 13
percent fewer problems per 100 vehicles to 135, slightly worse
than the industry average.  U.S. automakers narrowed the gap of problems per 100
vehicles compared with import brands to 13 problems from 18 a
year earlier, according to J.D. Power.  Daimler AG (DAI) ’s Mercedes-Benz jumped two spots to sixth place
in the dependability rankings, with 112 problems per 100
vehicles. The others that were above the industry average were
GM’s Buick at No. 9,  Hyundai Motor Co. (005380) ’s Hyundai No. 10, Honda
Motor Co.’s Acura No. 11 and the Honda brand at No. 12.  Chrysler Lags  The predecessors of Chrysler Group LLC and GM filed for
bankruptcy in 2009, the model year that J.D. Power studied for
this year’s survey. The  Auburn Hills , Michigan-based automaker’s
Chrysler, Dodge, Jeep and Ram were the four worst brands, even
as Jeep problems per 100 vehicles fell by 16 percent, Dodge
decreased by 11 percent and Chrysler pared 5 percent.  Chrysler Group is now majority owned by  Fiat SpA. (F)   Volkswagen AG (VOW) ’s namesake and Audi luxury brands placed
below the industry average, with 169 problems for Volkswagen and
148 problems for Audi per 100 vehicles. Audi owners reported 8.1
percent fewer problems than a year earlier, while Volkswagen
owners reported 12 percent fewer.  Nissan Motor Co. (7201) ’s Nissan improved while its Infiniti
luxury division lost ground. The Nissan brand had 17 percent
fewer problems per 100 vehicles, while Infiniti had 14 percent
more problems.  Tata Motors Ltd. (TTMT) ’s Jaguar, the U.K.-based luxury brand
acquired from Ford in 2008, plummeted to 28th place among 32
brands, from third in last year’s study. Problems per 100
vehicles surged to 172, 54 percent more than a year earlier.  J.D. Power’s study this year is based on a survey of more
than 31,000 original owners of 2009 model-year vehicles
conducted between October and December 2011.  Toyota Recalls  Toyota’s recalls of more than 10 million vehicles, most for
unintended acceleration, began in late 2009 and may not affect
results until later surveys. The Toyota brand dropped to its
worst-ever ranking in J.D. Power’s new-car quality study of 2010
model-year vehicles, which measures problems in the first 90
days of ownership and included some of the recalled vehicles.  Toyota’s models that earned top honors in their segments
include the  Lexus  ES 350 sedan and RX 350 sport-utility vehicle,
and the Toyota Prius hybrid, Tundra pickup and Sienna minivan.
Ford’s Fusion mid-size sedan, Explorer SUV and Lincoln MKZ sedan
topped their respective segments. GM and Yokohama, Japan-based
Nissan each had two models that were segment leaders.  To contact the reporter on this story:
