TomTom NV (TOM2) , Europe’s biggest maker of
portable navigation devices, rose to an eight-month high in
Amsterdam trading after the company said it plans to introduce
the HD Traffic service to China.  TomTom jumped as much as 19 percent to 4.65 euros, the
highest intraday price since June 27, and was trading up 8.7
percent at 12:54 p.m. The stock has gained 39 percent this year.  TomTom and local partner AutoNavi Holdings Ltd. will
jointly introduce HD Traffic, a navigation product that provides
information on traffic jams and offers alternative routes, to
drivers in 30 cities in China by the end of 2013, the Amsterdam-
based company said in a statement today.  “This isn’t necessarily a big deal, but the fact that they
are getting some footprint in  China  is a positive surprise to
the market,” said Jos Versteeg, an Amsterdam-based analyst at
Theodoor Gilissen Bankiers with a “hold”  recommendation  on
TomTom.  Chief Executive Officer Harold Goddijn is trying to
increase TomTom’s sales of built-in navigation systems for cars
as well as electronic maps and other software, as demand for
portable navigation devices is falling.  The company has announced  deals  in the past four months
with  Samsung Electronics Co. (005930)  for maps and location content and
with Ford Motor Co. and  General Motors Co. (GM) ’s Opel division to
supply built-in navigation systems. Rabo Securities raised
TomTom’s recommendation to “buy” from “hold” on Feb. 10,
citing strong automotive sales and a potential  Apple Inc. (AAPL) 
mapping deal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
