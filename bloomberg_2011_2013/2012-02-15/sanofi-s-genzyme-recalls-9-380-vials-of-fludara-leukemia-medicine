Sanofi (SAN) ,  France ’s biggest drugmaker,
recalled 9,380 vials of the leukemia medicine Fludara because of
a “lack of assurance of sterility,” U.S. regulators said.  Genzyme, a unit of Paris-based Sanofi, notified customers
of the recall of the intravenous drug on Jan. 31 and Feb. 1, the
 Food and Drug Administration  said today in an  enforcement report 
on its website.  The nationwide recall was prompted by manufacturing
deficiencies at Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH’s Ben Venue
Laboratories that produced Fludara. Boehringer, the world’s
largest family-owned drugmaker, closed the factory in Bedford,
Ohio, last year after U.S. and European regulators discovered
the violations.  Genzyme is conducting the recall as a precautionary measure
after Ben Venue was cited last year by the FDA and the European
Medicines Agency for “serious deficiencies,” Genzyme said
today in an e-mail sent by Carrie Brown, a company spokeswoman.  “No issue has been identified with Fludara,” the company
said. “However, defects potentially associated” with
deficiencies at Ben Venue “raise the possibility for
hypersensitivity reactions.”  The recalled vials comprised one batch. Fludara hasn’t been
manufactured at the  Ohio  plant since June 2010, Genzyme said.  Genzyme bought Fludara from German drugmaker Bayer AG in
2009. The medicine is available in generic form.  To contact the reporter on this story:
