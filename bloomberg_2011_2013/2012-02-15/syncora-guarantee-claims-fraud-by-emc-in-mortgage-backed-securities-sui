Syncora (SYCRF)  Guarantee Inc. sued  JPMorgan
Chase & Co.’s  EMC Mortgage unit over mortgage-backed securities,
alleging fraud and breach of contract in a lawsuit filed in New
York state court.  The suit was brought in connection with a transaction known
as SACO I Trust 2006-1, which involved the securitization of
residential  mortgage loans  with an aggregate principal balance
of more than $310 million, Syncora said in the complaint. That
transaction served as collateral for the issuance of about $303
million in securities.  EMC Mortgage was a unit of Bear Stearns Cos. until the
investment bank was bought by JPMorgan in 2008. Bear Stearns and
EMC obtained a financial-guaranty insurance policy from New
York-based bond insurer Syncora “to enhance the marketability
of the securities and their return on the transaction,”
according to the lawsuit.  Bear Stearns made “materially false and misleading
representations to induce Syncora to insure the transaction,”
and didn’t conduct “extensive due diligence” as it had
promised, lawyers for the bond insurer said in the lawsuit.  The transaction had experienced cumulative losses of
$96.7 million as of Sept. 30, which has resulted in Syncora
making more than $51.9 million in claim payments, the complaint
says.  Jennifer Zuccarelli , a spokeswoman for New York-based
JPMorgan Chase, declined to comment on the lawsuit in an e-mail.  The case is Syncora Guarantee Inc. v. EMC Mortgage LLC,
650420/2012, New York State Supreme Court ( Manhattan .)  To contact the reporter on this story:
