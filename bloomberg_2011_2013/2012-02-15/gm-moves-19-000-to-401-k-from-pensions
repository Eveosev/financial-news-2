General Motors Co. (GM) , which regained
the global auto sales lead last year, said it’s moving almost
three-quarter of its U.S. salaried workers from a  pension plan 
with defined benefits to defined contributions.  Pension benefits earned under the old system for employees
hired before 2001 will stop accruing on Sept. 30, Cindy
Brinkley, vice president of global human resources, said in a
conference call with reporters.  “They are going to keep all of their pension benefits that
they already earned,” she said. “In October, GM will start
making new contributions into the retirement-savings plan.”  The changes don’t affect the salaried workers hired in or
since 2001 who were already in defined-contribution plans,
Brinkley said. “Nothing is going to change for them,” she
said.   The Detroit-based automaker also said it’s giving its
26,000 salaried workers an additional week of vacation. U.S.
salaried workers won’t get across-the-board salary increases
this year while the automaker offers bonuses, Brinkley said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
