Eastman Kodak Co. (EKDKQ) , the photography
pioneer that filed for bankruptcy, can reject a deal for naming
rights to the theater in  Los Angeles  that hosts the annual
Academy Awards show, a judge ruled.  U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Allan Gropper in  Manhattan  approved a
request today to end the Kodak Theatre sponsorship agreement to
save money as the company restructures. The approval comes less
than two weeks before the film industry’s Oscar awards show, set
for Feb. 26.  “They have due regard for the interest of their creditor
body, and they just don’t want to pay this money for the next
nine years,” Gropper said at a court hearing.  The agreement required Kodak to pay $72 million in annual
installments over 20 years, according to a court filing. Kodak
pays $3.6 million a year and has $38 million in payments left on
the contract, Pauline Morgan, a Kodak lawyer, said in court.  Kodak said in a court filing that the costs of the
agreement outweigh any benefits from the naming rights and that
rejecting it was in the best interest of the company and its
creditors.  “It’s tantamount to handing the keys over to the
landlord,” Morgan said about the rejection.  The case is In re Eastman Kodak Co., 12-10202,  U.S.
