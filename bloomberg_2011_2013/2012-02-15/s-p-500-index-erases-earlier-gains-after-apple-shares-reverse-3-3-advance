U.S. stocks fell, erasing an earlier
gain, as  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  reversed an advance of as much as 3.3
percent amid reports that the company has pulled its iPad from
Amazon.com Inc. in  China .  Apple, the nation’s biggest company by market value,
tumbled as much as 1.5 percent as Marbridge Consulting said the
company asked Amazon China and other websites to stop selling
the iPad amid a patent dispute.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slipped 0.3 percent to
1,347.06 at 1:08 p.m. in New York after climbing as much as 0.4
percent earlier after China said it will increase efforts to
fight  Europe ’s debt crisis. The  Dow Jones Industrial Average 
slipped 86.43 points, or 0.7 percent, to 12,791.85.  To contact the reporter on this story:
