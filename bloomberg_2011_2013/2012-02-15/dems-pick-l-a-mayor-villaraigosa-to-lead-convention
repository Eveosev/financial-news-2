The  Democratic National Committee 
has tapped Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa as chairman of
the party’s September national convention in Charlotte,  North
Carolina .  “Mayor Villaraigosa has dedicated his career to civic
engagement and empowering people at the grassroots,” DNC
Chairwoman  Debbie Wasserman Schultz , a U.S. House member from
 Florida , said in a news release. “And that’s exactly what we
need to be successful at this convention -- input and engagement
from Americans across the country.”  Last month, the DNC announced that the final night of the
convention would be held at Bank of America Stadium, an outdoor
venue that will let President Barack Obama accept his party’s
nomination before a larger audience.  Democrats also shortened the convention program from four
days to three. The rest of the convention, which begins Sept. 4,
will be held at the Time Warner Cable Arena.  As the permanent chairman, Villaraigosa will preside over
the convention’s proceedings, ensure order and serve as a
national spokesman for the party, which is seeking to appeal to
Hispanic voters.  On the first day of the convention, Wasserman Schultz will
nominate Villaraigosa to the Rules Committee. His nomination
will be voted on by convention delegates in the opening session,
according to a DNC press release.  To contact the reporter on this story:
