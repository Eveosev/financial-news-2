Kenya ’s shilling weakened for the
first time this week on increased dollar demand by businesses.  The currency of  East Africa ’s biggest economy depreciated
as much as 0.3 percent and traded 0.1 percent lower at 82.88 per
dollar as of 4:24 p.m. in Nairobi.  “The weakening of the shilling is due to growing dollar
demand with minimal inflow,” John Muli, a dealer at Nairobi-
based African Banking Corp., said in a phone interview.  Tanzania’s shilling strengthened for the second day as
investors bought the local currency to invest in treasury bills.
The currency of the second-biggest economy in East Africa
appreciated as much as 0.8 percent before paring its gain to 0.2
percent at 1,589 per dollar as of 4:05 p.m. in  Dar es Salaam ,
Tanzania’s commercial capital.  “The shilling has appreciated mainly due to today’s
treasury bills auction,” Hakim Sheik, a dealer with Commercial
Bank of Africa Tanzania Ltd., said by phone from Dar es Salaam.  Tanzania auctioned 100 billion shillings ($63 million)
worth of treasury bills today, according to central bank. The
results are to be announced today.  The Ugandan shilling weakened the most in four days,
depreciating 0.1 percent to 2,312.76 to the dollar at 3:57 p.m.
A close at this level will be the lowest since Feb 9., according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
