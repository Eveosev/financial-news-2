Exports of Azeri Light crude from
Georgiaâ€™s Black Sea port of Supsa will decline to four cargoes
in March from five in February, according to a loading schedule
obtained by Bloomberg News.  Shipments will total 2.4 million barrels, or 77,419 barrels
a day, down from 103,448 barrels this month, the plan shows.  BP Plc (BP/)  operates the Baku-Supsa pipeline, which carries
Azeri Light from the  Caspian Sea  to the Black Sea.  Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude shipments
compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan
their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
