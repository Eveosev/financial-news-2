Emirates NBD PJSC (EMIRATES) ’s loans to the
Dubai government grew 10 percent last year as accelerating
economic growth boosted lending opportunities of the United Arab
Emirates’ biggest bank.  Loans to the Persian Gulf emirate’s government and its
departments rose to 59.4 billion dirhams ($16 billion) in the
year ended Dec. 31 compared with 54 billion dirhams a year
earlier, the Dubai-based bank said in its annual results
statement today. That represents about 29 percent of its total
loans compared with 27.5 percent a year earlier, the data show.  Dubai’s economy expanded more than 3 percent last year,
Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed  Al Maktoum , head of Dubai’s Supreme
Fiscal Policy Committee, said today. The economy may grow 4.5
percent in 2012, he said.  Emirates NBD’s bad loans have risen as it deals with
exposure to debt restructuring by state-owned companies
including  Dubai World , which shook global markets in 2009 with
its request to delay payments on $25 billion in loans. Dubai and
related companies have $10.3 billion in debt maturing this year,
Bank of America Merrill-Lynch estimates in October show.  Emirates NBD, which is 55.6 percent owned by Dubai’s
government, reported a 62 percent decline in fourth-quarter
profit today, below analysts’ estimates, as it boosted
provisions for bad loans. Its full-year profit rose 8.2 percent
as net interest income climbed 7 percent.  Loans to the Investment Corp. of Dubai, Emirates NBD’s
parent company and one of Dubai’s main state-owned holding
companies, increased by 1.29 billion dirhams last year, the data
show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
