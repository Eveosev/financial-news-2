DNO International ASA (DNO) , a Norwegian
oil and gas explorer operating in Iraq’s Kurdistan region, said
production will climb as it returned to profit after three years
of losses.  DNO will drill 19 wells in 2012, the most in its 40-year
history, the company said today in a statement. It posted net
income of 653 million kroner ($114 million) last year, compared
with a 283 million-krone loss a year earlier, as output more
than doubled.  “We expect to see production continue to increase,” Chief
Executive Officer Helge Eide said in a telephone interview. “We
have a very exciting year before us.”  DNO, which last month completed a merger with RAK Petroleum
PCL’s oil and gas units in the  Middle East  and North Africa,
plans a listing in London this year. The Oslo-based company is a
partner with  Genel Energy Plc (GENL) , the oil and gas producer led by
former  BP Plc (BP/)  CEO  Tony Hayward , at two licenses in Iraq.  Genel President Mehmet Sepil said in November he planned to
approach DNO on a possible merger. Eide declined to comment on
the matter today.  DNO fell 4.3 percent to 9.95 kroner as of the market close
in Oslo.  Working-interest production rose to 39,966 barrels of oil a
day in 2011 from 17,381 barrels a day a year earlier, the
company said in the statement. DNO, which also operates in Oman,
Yemen, the United Arab Emirates and  Tunisia , had 1.75 billion
kroner in cash at the end of last year.  The company posted net income of 203 million kroner in the
fourth quarter, compared with a 31 million-krone loss a year
earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
