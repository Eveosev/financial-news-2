Russian exports of steelmaking coal
declined 21 percent last year to 14.2 million metric tons
because of lower demand from  China  and periodic halts at some
Siberian mines.  China decreased purchases of Russian coking coal 41 percent
from the previous year to 1.5 million tons, the Economy Ministry
in Moscow said on its  website . Ukraine accounted for 40 percent
of exports, while Switzerland, where Russian producers have
trading divisions, represented 15 percent.  Export prices advanced 46 percent from a year earlier to
$174 a ton, the ministry said.  Production of steelmaking coal in Russia fell 3 percent
last year to 64.7 million tons, while domestic demand added 5
percent to 52 million tons, the ministry said. The industrial
safety regulator temporarily halted mines run by OAO  Raspadskaya (RASP) 
and OAO  Mechel (MTLR)  during the past year, damping output.  Russia  imported almost 1.5 million tons of coal from the
U.S., more than double the previous year, the data showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
