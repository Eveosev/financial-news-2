Egypt ’s Muslim Brotherhood urged
officials to reject U.S. “pressure” over the case of workers
at non-governmental organizations accused of breaching laws on
foreign funding.  “Egyptians will not tolerate any officials who decide to
succumb to pressure and to cover up the accusations or interfere
in the work of the judiciary,” the group, whose party alliance
controls the largest bloc in parliament, said today in an e-
mailed statement. The Muslim Brotherhood supports the
“nationalistic” stance taken by Egyptian officials over the
case, it said.  Egypt has referred 43 people, including the son of U.S.
Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood, to trial after a probe into
foreign funding of NGOs. The inquiry has added to strains
between the U.S. and Egypt and jeopardized American financial
aid to the Egyptian military, a close ally.  The Brotherhood said the case showed that part of U.S. aid
to Egypt “is being spent to destroy Egypt and ruin its
society.”  The state-run Al Ahram newspaper yesterday reported that
Egypt’s minister of planning and international cooperation,
Fayza Aboulnaga, has told investigators that the U.S. directly
funded NGOs in the country to sow chaos after the fall of  Hosni Mubarak .  To contact the reporter on this story:
