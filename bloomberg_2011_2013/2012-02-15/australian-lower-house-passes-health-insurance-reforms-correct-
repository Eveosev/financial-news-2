(Corrects time period of Budget savings.)  Australia â€™s government today passed
legislation that would introduce means-testing of rebates for
private-health insurance through the lower house. The
legislation, which will enforce means-testing of the 30 percent
rebate for individuals earning more than A$83,000 a year, needs
approval in the upper house Senate to become law. The reforms
are expected to save the government A$2.4 billion over three
years, according to the Australian Broadcasting Corp.  To contact the reporter on this story:
