The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot
Index of 24  raw materials  rose 0.6 percent to settle at 682.84
at 3:43 p.m. in  New York , led by cocoa.  The UBS Bloomberg CMCI  index  of 26 prices advanced 0.1
percent to 1,607.26.  SOFT COMMODITIES  Cocoa surged the most in three weeks after Olam
International Ltd., a Singapore-based commodity trader, said the
price has “more upside” with global demand forecast to outpace
supplies.  Processing has been “stronger than expected,” and the
market will swing to a deficit in the 12 months that started
Oct. 1 from a surplus a year earlier, Sunny Verghese, Olam’s
chief executive officer, said yesterday. Prices also rose on
concern that adverse weather may hurt crops in  Ivory Coast  and
 Ghana , the world’s biggest producers.  On ICE Futures in New York, cocoa for May delivery jumped
5.3 percent to $2,391 a metric ton, the biggest gain for a most-
active contract since Jan. 24.  Arabica-coffee futures for May delivery fell 1.7 percent to
$2.0255 a pound. The price dropped for the sixth straight
session, the longest slump since late November.  Raw-sugar futures for May delivery rose 0.8 percent to

$1.861 a pound.  Cotton futures for May delivery rose 0.7 percent to 93.48
cents a pound, the fourth straight gain.  CRUDE OIL  Crude oil rose to a one-month high after reports that  Iran 
halted shipments to  Europe  and U.S. inventories declined for the
first time in four weeks.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , oil futures for March
delivery rose 1.1 percent to $101.80 a barrel, the highest
settlement since Jan. 10.  Statoil ASA bought North Sea Forties crude at the highest
price in more than four months. Vitol Group sought to sell
Russian Urals blend in the Mediterranean without finding a
buyer.  Statoil bought a Forties cargo for loading on March 5 to
March 7 from Vitol at $1.05 a barrel more than dated Brent, the
highest since Sept. 27, according to a Bloomberg survey of
traders monitoring the Platts trading window. The company,
 Norway ’s largest producer, bought a shipment at a premium of 80
cents on Feb. 13.  OIL PRODUCTS  Heating oil advanced as U.S. factory production increased
in January, indicating stronger economic growth and greater fuel
demand.  On the Nymex, heating-oil futures for March delivery
advanced 0.8 percent to $3.1916 a gallon.  Gasoline futures for March delivery increased 0.8 percent
to $3.0067 a gallon.  PRECIOUS METALS  Gold rose, ending the longest slump this year, as  China ’s
pledge to help resolve Europe’s debt crisis boosted demand for
commodities.  On the Comex in New York, gold futures for April delivery
rose 0.6 percent to $1,728.10 an ounce, the biggest gain for a
most-active contract since Feb. 7. The metal dropped 1.3 percent

December.  Silver futures for March delivery advanced 0.2 percent to
$33.408 an ounce. The price has gained 20 percent this year.  On the Nymex, palladium futures for March delivery fell 0.5

increasing supplies from India and  Australia .  On the Chicago Board of Trade, wheat futures for May
delivery dropped 0.8 percent to $6.34 a bushel.  Soybean futures for May delivery rose 0.5 percent to
$12.6875 a bushel.  Corn futures for May delivery fell 1.1 percent to $6.31 a
bushel, the biggest drop since Jan. 30.  BASE METALS  Copper fell, capping the longest slump in two months, on
signs that European plans to stem the Greek debt crisis may have
hit a snag, dimming prospects for growth and metal demand in the
region.  On the Comex, copper futures for May delivery fell 0.3
percent to $3.81 a pound. The metal fell for the fourth straight
session, the longest slide since mid-December.  On the  London  Metal Exchange, copper for delivery in three

pound).  Nickel, zinc, lead and aluminum also fell in London. Tin
rose for the first time in six sessions.  NATURAL GAS  Natural gas declined the most in two weeks as forecasts for
warmer-than-normal weather in the eastern U.S. through the end
of February signaled reduced demand.  On the Nymex, gas futures for March delivery fell 4.2
percent to 2.425 per million British thermal units.  U.K. gas for delivery tomorrow gained 0.5 pence to 58 pence
a therm at 5 p.m. London time, according to broker prices
compiled by Bloomberg. That’s equivalent to $9.11 per million
Btu. A therm is 100,000 Btu.  LIVESTOCK  Cattle futures fell from a record on concern that consumer
demand for beef will slow because of the rally in prices. Hogs
also dropped.  On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, cattle futures for
April delivery fell 0.3 percent to close at $1.289 a pound,
after reaching $1.29875, the highest for a most-active contract
since the commodity started trading in 1964.  Hog futures for April settlement fell 0.8 percent to close
at 88.9 cents a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
