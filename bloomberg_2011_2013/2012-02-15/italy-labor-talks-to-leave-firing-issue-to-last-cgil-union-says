Changes in  Italy ’s labor laws to
make it easier for companies to shed workers will be the “last
item” in talks between the government and unions, the country’s
biggest labor group said.  Article 18, the code in Italy’s labor law that bans firing
without just cause and forces employers to rehire and compensate
workers deemed unjustly released, is the thorniest issue in the
labor-market revamp that Prime Minister  Mario Monti ’s government
plans to approve next month. Employers say it discourages hiring
because it makes it hard to reduce staff during tough economic
times, while unions oppose any attempt to weaken the law.  Labor Minister Elsa Fornero told representatives of unions
and employers at a meeting in  Rome  today that Article 18 will be
discussed after the talks focus on overhauling laws on training
and welfare, CGIL, Italy’s biggest union, said in a note on its
website today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
