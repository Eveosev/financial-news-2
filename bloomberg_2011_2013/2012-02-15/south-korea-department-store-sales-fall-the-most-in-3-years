Sales at major South Korean
department stores fell most in three years last month as an
economic slowdown damped consumption.  Outlays (KODSDEPT)  at the three largest chains fell 4.1 percent in
January from a year earlier, the biggest decline since December
2008 and following an 11 percent gain in December, the Ministry
of  Knowledge Economy  said in a statement today. Discount-store
sales gained 2.7 percent, todayâ€™s report showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
