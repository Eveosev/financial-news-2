Ron Jaworski won’t return to the
“Monday Night Football” booth next season, as ESPN said it
will use a two-person commentator team of play-by-play man Mike
Tirico and analyst Jon Gruden.  Jaworski had been a “Monday Night Football” analyst for
the  Walt Disney Co. (DIS)  network for the past five seasons and teamed
with Tirico and Gruden since 2009. The former Philadelphia
Eagles quarterback signed a five-year extension today for an
analyst role that includes appearances on ESPN’s other NFL
programming, the network said in a  statement .  ESPN had featured a three-person booth since 2006, when the
Monday night NFL games moved to the cable network from ABC. Al
Michaels and  John Madden  were the last two-man broadcasting team
for “Monday Night Football,” paired together on ABC’s coverage
from 2002-05.  ESPN and the NFL extended their broadcast-rights agreement
on Sept. 8, 2011, giving the Walt Disney Co. unit “Monday Night
Football” through the 2021 season. It’s the most-watched series
in cable-TV history.  To contact the reporter on this story:
