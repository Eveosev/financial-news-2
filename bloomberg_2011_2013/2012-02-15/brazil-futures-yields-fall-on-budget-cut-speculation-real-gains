Yields on Brazilian interest-rate
futures contracts fell amid speculation that reduced  government
spending  and slower-than-forecast inflation will prompt policy
makers to maintain the pace of borrowing-cost cuts.  The yield on the contract due in January fell one basis
point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 9.30 percent at 9:47 a.m. in
Sao Paulo. The real advanced 0.5 percent to 1.7156 per  U.S.
dollar , from 1.7247 yesterday.  Finance Minister Guido Mantega and Planning Minister Miriam
Belchior will announce tomorrow a 55 billion reais budget cut,
IstoE Dinheiro columnist Guilherme Barros wrote today, without
saying how he obtained the information. The  finance ministry 
declined to comment in an e-mailed statement.  “It’s a relatively big budget reduction,” Thiago Carlos,
economist at Link SA, said by phone from  Sao Paulo . “It would
be enough for the government to achieve the fiscal target with
the help of some extraordinary tax revenues.”  Brazil’s inflation, as measured by the IGP-10 index, slowed
to 0.04 percent in February, from 0.08 percent a month earlier,
according to the Rio de Janeiro-based Getulio Vargas Foundation.
The figure trailed the 0.14 percent median estimate of 34
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporters on this story:
