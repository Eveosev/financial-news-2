Turkiye Halk Bankasi AS (HALKB) , a Turkish
state-run bank, may say fourth-quarter profit increased an
annual 2.8 percent, as it earned more from inflation-linked
bonds and net interest income climbed due to a higher ratio of
loans to deposits.  Net income will probably be 513.4 million liras ($291
million), compared with 499.6 million liras in the fourth
quarter of 2010, according to the average of 17 analysts’
estimates in a  Bloomberg survey . Predictions ranged from 473
million liras to 575 million liras. Halkbank had a profit of
503.8 million liras in the third quarter of 2011, an increase of
5.9 percent from a year ago.  “Halkbank’s net interest income and commissions revenue
will be higher as loan-to-deposit spreads increased in the
fourth quarter,” Recep Demir, analyst at Garanti Yatırım Menkul
Kiymetler in Istanbul, said in a phone interview. “The bank
will benefit from CPI-linked bonds, like other big lenders.”  Halkbank’s fourth-quarter profit may “appear smaller” due
to rising discretionary provisions for loans, Cagdas Dogan,
analyst at Istanbul-based Turk Ekonomi Bankasi AS, a unit of BNP
Paribas SA, said in a phone interview. Halkbank is expected to
report earnings tomorrow.
