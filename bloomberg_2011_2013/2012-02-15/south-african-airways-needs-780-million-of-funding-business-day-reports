South African Airways , a state-owned
carrier, is in talks with the government for a recapitalization
of 4 billion rand to 6 billion rand, Business Day reported,
citing Chief Financial Officer Wolf Meyer.  The money will be used for operational costs, renewing its
fleet and funding its growth strategy, the Johannesburg-based
newspaper reported. The airline will probably report a loss in
the year through March, Business Day cited Meyer as saying. The
funds would be in addition to a 1.3 billion-rand loan from the
government and the 1.6 billion-rand guarantee the airline
received to support cash requirements, it said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
