New York (STONY)  state’s retirement fund,
the third-largest U.S. public pension, earned 4.83 percent on
its investments in the quarter ending Dec. 31, Comptroller
 Thomas DiNapoli  said.  The $140.3 billion fund has lost 1.26 percent on its
investments since the fiscal year began April 1, Eric Sumberg, a
DiNapoli spokesman, said in an e-mail today. The quarterly gain
fell short of the 11.2 percent increase in the  Standard & Poor’s 
500  index  in the same period, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. It followed a 7.48 percent loss in the previous three
months.  “The rally in the equities markets has helped the fund
maintain its strong position,” DiNapoli, the fund’s sole
trustee, said in a statement. “However, instability resulting
from the European sovereign-debt crisis and the slow pace of
economic recovery remain areas of concern.”  The  New York  pension had 101.5 percent of the money needed
to pay its obligations in 2010, better than any other state,
according to an annual study by Bloomberg Rankings.  For calendar year 2011, the fund gained 3.18 percent,
Sumberg said. The  California Public Employees’ Retirement
System (32617) , the largest U.S. pension, earned 1.1 percent in 2011.
The  S&P 500 index  returned 2.1 percent last year.  New York’s pension fund earned 14.6 percent on its
investments in fiscal 2011, ending the year at $146.5 billion,
the highest since the economic downturn in fiscal 2009, DiNapoli
said in a July  statement .  To contact the reporter on this story:
