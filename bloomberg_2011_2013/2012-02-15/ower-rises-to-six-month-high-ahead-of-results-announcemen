Tower Semiconductor Ltd. (TSEM)  surged to
the highest level in more than six months on speculation the
company will report higher revenue tomorrow.  The  shares  surged 5.8 percent to 3.38 shekels, the highest
since Aug. 4, at the 4:30 p.m. close in Tel Aviv.  “There are estimates that the revenue and the guidance the
company will give tomorrow will be good,” Eran Jacoby, an
analyst at DS Securities and Investments in Tel Aviv said.  In July, Chief Executive Officer Russell Ellwanger said he
expects the acquisition of a Japanese factory to help the
company attain a quarterly sales target of $250 million in 2014.
The purchase of the facility, located in Nishiwaki City, may
boost revenue in the Asia Pacific region, where Tower gets about
9 percent of sales, Ellwanger said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
