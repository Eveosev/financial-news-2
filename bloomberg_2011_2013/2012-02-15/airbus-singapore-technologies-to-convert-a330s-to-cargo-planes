Airbus SAS (EAD)  formed an alliance with
 Singapore Technologies Engineering Ltd. (STE)  to convert A330 wide-
body passenger jets into freighters, helping the European
planemaker expand in a market largely dominated by  Boeing Co. (BA)   ST Aerospace will lead the A330P2F engineering development,
working with Airbus and EADS’s EFW facility in Dresden, which
will subsequently be responsible as program lead during the
industrial phase, Airbus said today in a statement. Most of the
conversions will be done at EFW’s facilities in Dresden.  With more than 830 A330s operating worldwide today,
airlines would be able to wring value from older A330 planes by
having them converted for cargo before replacing them.  “This is something we have been looking at within Airbus
for some time, which a number of our customers have been asking
us to evaluate,” said Airbus Chief Executive Officer  Tom Enders 
today at a briefing in Singapore.  The only cargo plane Airbus currently builds itself is the
A330-200 freighter. A converted passenger model would offer a
less costly alternative. A freighter-refit facility in  Dresden ,
 Germany , owned by the planemaker’s parent  European Aeronautic,
Defence & Space Co.  currently works only on the A300 and A310
models, which has left a gap in the market.  Boeing Offering  Boeing has a far larger offering of new-build cargo planes
than does Airbus, producing cargo versions in every size
including the 737-700 convertible, the 767-300 freighter, 777
freighter, the 747-400, and the 747-8 freighter, which began
service two years late in 2011. Airbus had planned to build an
A380 freighter, though difficulties with the passenger variant
of the plane forced it to postpone the plan indefinitely.  Enders said Airbus sees a need for 2,700 or 2,800 cargo
aircraft in the next 20 years, with “almost all of this demand
will in the mid-sized category” occupied by the A330. The
converted A330 would “compliment very nicely our new-build
330-200 freighters,” he said.  Qatar Airways Ltd, is looking to convert 15 A330s for cargo
use by 2016, CEO Akbar  Al Baker  told journalists in May. The
airline might opt to use converted Boeing Co. 767s instead. if
Airbus is unable to undertake the conversion, the executive said
at the Dubai Air show.  European Center  EADS EFW will become the European center for ST Aerospace’s
global maintenance, repair and overhaul operations, Airbus also
said. The project is subject to the definitive agreements being
finalized in the coming weeks and also to regulatory clearances.  Airbus several years ago sought to establish a joint
venture with  Russia ’s United Aircraft Corp. converting narrow-
body jetliners to cargo planes. It scrapped the venture in June,
saying demand had dropped and used jets were being bought for
passenger use.  To contact the reporters on this story:
