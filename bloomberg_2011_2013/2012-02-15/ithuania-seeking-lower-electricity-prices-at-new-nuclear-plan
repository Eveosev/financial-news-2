Lithuanian electricity production
costs at a planned nuclear power plant in Visaginas may average
7 centai ($0.03) to 10 centai per kilowatt hour, lower than
current production costs in the country, Energy Minister Arvydas Sekmokas said.  The price for consumers on the market is planned between 17
centai and 25 centai per kilowatt hour, Sekmokas said in a
conference in Vilnius today.  The Lithuanian government, along with its partners in
Estonia and  Latvia , is in talks with Hitachi Ltd. to build a
nuclear power plant in the country.  Lithuania  picked Hitachi
together with its Hitachi-GE Nuclear Energy Ltd. unit as a
strategic investor and technology supplier to construct a
nuclear plant in the Baltic country by the end of 2020.  The region is seeking to cut its dependence on energy
imports after closing the Soviet-era Ignalina facility at the
end of 2009. Lithuania plans to hold a 30 percent stake in the
the plant, while the strategic investor and other regional
partners would share the rest.  To contact the reporter on this story:
