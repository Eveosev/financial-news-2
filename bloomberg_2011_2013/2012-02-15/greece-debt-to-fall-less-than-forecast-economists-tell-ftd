Economists at European banks expect
 Greece ’s national debt to fall less than expected by the so-
called troika as consolidation efforts sap economic growth,
 Financial Times Deutschland  reported.  “Even with the discussed creditor participation it is now
hardly realistic that the state debt falls to a sustainable
level,” Frank Hansen, head economist of Danske Bank, was cited
as saying by the newspaper.  The troika, which includes the  International Monetary Fund ,
European Commission and European Central Bank,  “massively
underestimated how dramatically damaging consolidation is for
the economy,” the FTD cited Fabio Fois, European economist at
Barclays Capital, as saying.  Stefan Nicola in Berlin at +49-30-70010-6246 or
