Rubber advanced for a third day as
the Japanese currency declined to a three-month low against the
dollar, raising the appeal of yen-denominated contracts, and on
speculation that demand from tiremakers may increase.  The July-delivery contract gained as much as 2 percent to
323.3 yen a kilogram ($4,115 a metric ton) on the  Tokyo 
Commodity Exchange at 10:48 a.m., reaching the highest level
since Feb. 9.  The yen dropped to 78.66 per dollar, the lowest level since
Nov. 1, extending losses after  Japan’s central bank  unexpectedly
added 10 trillion yen to an asset-purchase program and set an
inflation goal of 1 percent yesterday. Japanese stocks rallied,
sending the Nikkei 225 Stock Average toward a six-month high, as
a falling yen boosted the earnings outlook for exporters
including carmakers and tire producers.  “The yen’s drop gave the biggest boost to futures,”
 Kazuhiko Saito , an analyst at broker Fujitomi Co. in Tokyo, said
today by phone.  Rubber was also supported by a seasonal decrease in supply
as  Thailand , the world’s largest producer and exporter, entered
a low-production period this month, he said.  Supply in major producing countries remains tight as trees
are shedding leaves during the dry wintering season, while
demand from the automotive industry remains steady, according to
the International Rubber Consortium Ltd.  Gains were capped by concerns about the debt crisis as
European finance ministers canceled a Brussels meeting slated
for today. They will hold a teleconference instead to prod
 Greece  to do more to clinch an aid package worth 130 billion
euros ($170 billion) along with about 100 billion euros of debt
relief from private bondholders. Greece needs the aid to make a
14.5 billion-euro bond payment on March 20.  May-delivery rubber in  Shanghai  rose 1.6 percent to 28,695
yuan ($4,554) a ton. The Thai cash price dropped 0.4 percent to
124.55 baht ($4.03) a kilogram yesterday, according to the
Rubber Research Institute of Thailand.  To contact the reporter on this story:
