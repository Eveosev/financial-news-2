Russian industrial- production  growth
accelerated last month, exceeding economist forecasts as
manufacturing expanded.  Output rose 3.8 percent in January compared with a year
earlier from 2.5 percent a month earlier, the Federal Statistics
Service in Moscow said today in an e-mailed  statement . The
median forecast in a Bloomberg News  survey  of 17 economists was
for growth of 2.7 percent.  The increase signals the resiliency of the world’s biggest
energy exporter as  Europe ’s sovereign-debt crisis and slower
growth in  China  threaten to damp demand for the country’s
resources. Manufacturing may continue to support the economy
after new car and light commercial vehicle sales advanced 20
percent in January.  “Consumer demand has remained fairly strong, judging from
retail sales and lending,” Anna Bogdyukevich, an economist at
OAO Gazprombank in Moscow, said today by telephone before the
release. She forecast a 4.1 percent increase. “I think that
will offer some support.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
