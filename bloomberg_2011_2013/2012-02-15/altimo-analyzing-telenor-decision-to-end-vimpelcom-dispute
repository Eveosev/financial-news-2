Altimo , a unit of Russia’s  Alfa
Group , welcomes  Telenor ASA’s (TEL)  decision to end a yearlong dispute
over the ownership of mobile phone operator VimpelCom Ltd. and
is analyzing the statement, Altimo’s Vice President Evgeny Dumalkin said today.  “We received the Telenor release three hours ago and we
are analyzing the issue from all perspectives, including
legal,” Dumalkin said in an e-mail. “Initially it looks like
positive news.”  Altimo owns a total of 24.993 percent of VimpelCom’s voting
shares, Dumalkin said. Alfa Group owns about 75 percent of
Altimo, he said.  Telenor said in a statement today that it bought 234
million of VimpelCom’s preferred shares from Weather Investments
II S.a.r.l. for $374.4 million, increasing its voting stake in
the company to about 36 percent. Telenor also withdrew all its
claims against Altimo Holdings & Investments Ltd., Altimo
Cooperatief U.A. and  VimpelCom Ltd. (VIP)  in the pending arbitration,
it said in the statement.  “VimpelCom has become one of the largest operators and we
rely on the professional management of VimpelCom in increasing
its  shareholder value ,” Dumalkin said.  Telenor filed a complaint with the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission on Oct. 31. The dispute centered on whether
Altimo still controls about 25 percent of VimpelCom shares and
whether VimpelCom’s board should be replaced.  To contact the reporter on this story:
