Dubai’s shares fell for the first
time in six days on investor bets that gains prompted by
optimism ahead of  Emaar Properties PJSC (EMAAR) ’s results were overdone.  Emaar, the developer of the world’s tallest skyscraper,
decreased the most in six weeks after reporting quarterly
profit.  Dubai Investments PJSC (DIC) , the owner of stakes in more than
40 companies, fell the most in two weeks. The  DFM General Index (DFMGI) ,
up 6.1 percent this month, declined 1.1 percent to 1,522.96 at
the 2 p.m. close in the emirate. The 31 companies on Dubai’s
gauge trade at about 9.4 times  estimated earnings  compared with
10.6 times for the  MSCI Emerging Markets Index. (MXEF)   Dubai’s index “has been performing well in the last couple
of weeks,” said Samer Darwiche, a Dubai-based analyst at
Gulfmena Investments. “Some investors are booking profits today
after good results from Emaar.”  Emaar, the United Arab Emirates biggest developer by market
value, decreased 2.7 percent to 2.90 dirhams. The stock is still
up 13 percent this year. Emaar’s fourth-quarter net income rose
to 716 million dirhams ($195 million) as it cut costs and
generated more revenue from hotels and international operations,
it said after trading hours yesterday. Dubai Investments fell
4.3 percent to 67 fils.  Abu Dhabi National Energy Co. (TAQA) , the utility known as Taqa,
dropped 4 percent, the biggest decline since Aug. 7, to 1.20
dirhams. Taqa said full-year profit fell 26 percent to 752
million dirhams as it booked a 528 million-dirham charge related
to its Canadian operations and paid higher U.K. taxes.  Qatar’s  QE Index (DSM)  declined 0.7 percent and Kuwait’s  gauge 
fell 0.8 percent. The  Bloomberg GCC 200 Index  retreated 0.3
percent.  Saudi Arabia ’s  Tadawul All Share Index (SASEIDX)  and  Abu Dhabi ’s
 ADX General Index (ADSMI)  slid less than 0.1 percent. Oman’s  MSM30 Index (MSM30) 
rose 0.5 percent and Bahrain’s measure was unchanged.  To contact the reporter on this story:
