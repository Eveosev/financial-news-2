Portuguese two-year notes extended a
drop after the nation sold 3 billion euros of three-, six- and
12-month bills.  The two-year note yield climbed 43 basis points to 14.28
percent as of 11:07 a.m. London time. Portuguese 10-year bonds
declined, pushing the yield six basis points higher to 12.08
percent.  Portuguese government debt agency IGCP sold 1.5 billion
euros of 12-month bills, the longest maturity offered since it
requested a bailout from the European Union and the
 International Monetary Fund  in April last year. The securities
were issued at an average yield of 4.943 percent, compared with
5.902 percent when  Portugal  last auctioned 12-month debt on
April 6, 2011.  Borrowing costs also fell at the auctions of three- and
six-month bills.  To contact the reporter on this story:
