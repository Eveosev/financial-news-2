Tallinna Kaubamaja AS (TKM1T) , Estoniaâ€™s
biggest retailer, said its fourth-quarter profit rose 18
percent, helped mainly by increasing demand at its department
stores and car retail unit.  Net income rose to 8.7 million euros ($11.4 million) from
7.4 million euros a year earlier, the Tallinn-based company said
in a regulatory statement today. Revenue rose 6 percent to 120
million euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
