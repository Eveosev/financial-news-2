Israel Discount Bank of  New York 
sued Delaware’s  First State Depository  Co. asking a judge to
preserve a $17 million collection including rare gold and silver
coins being held as collateral for loans.  The depository firm in Wilmington is transferring the coins
in violation of an agreement with the bank, a unit of Tel Aviv-
based  Israel Discount Bank Ltd. (DSCT) , according to a Feb. 13 Delaware
Chancery Court complaint.  “In addition, IDB discovered that the defendants are
marketing for sale and are attempting to sell” some of the
assets without permission, the bank said in court papers.  The bank asked a judge to freeze the assets in Delaware,
forbid coin transfers and enforce its right to inspect the
deposits.  Included in the cache, the bank said, are more than 12,000
rare presidential or  Sacagawea dollar coins  with missing edge
markings; other collector-quality gold and silver coins; and
bullion, according to court papers.  Officials at First State Depository weren’t immediately
available to comment on the lawsuit.  Israel Discount Bank fell 4 shekels to 528 in Tel Aviv
trading today.  The case is Israel Discount Bank v. First State Depository,
CA7237,  Delaware  Chancery Court (Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
