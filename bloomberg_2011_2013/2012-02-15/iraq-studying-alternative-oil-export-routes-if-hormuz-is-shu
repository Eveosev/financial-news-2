Iraq  is considering options to
export crude from its southern terminals should Iran block the
Strait of Hormuz, transit point for about two-thirds of its
production, Planning Minister Ali Youssef Al-Shukri said.  Iraq is considering three alternative routes, including
from the east through Syria and Lebanon, and from the north
through the Turkish port of Ceyhan on the Mediterranean, he said
today in an interview in Baghdad.  “The Iraqi government is worried about the issue of
closing the Strait of Hormuz,” he said. The Cabinet entrusted
the ministers of planning and trade and other government
institutions to draft a study for alternatives to the southern
export route, he said.  Iraq will lose the capacity to export 1.7 million barrels
of crude a day if Iran blocks the Strait of Hormuz, Oil Ministry
spokesman  Asim Jihad  said on Feb. 8. Iran has threatened to
close the Strait of Hormuz in response to international
sanctions on its  energy industry .  Iraq has awarded 15 licenses for drilling rights to foreign
companies since the U.S.-led invasion that ousted President
 Saddam Hussein  in 2003. The Arab nation is the third-largest oil
producer in OPEC, pumping 2.75 million barrels a day in January,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg News.  To contact the reporter on this story:
