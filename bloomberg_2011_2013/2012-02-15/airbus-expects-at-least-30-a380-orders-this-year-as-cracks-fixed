Airbus SAS (FRAVABGO)  predicted it will sell
30 A380 superjumbos this year, more than in 2011, even after the
double-decker planes developed wing cracks that its chief
executive officer said will cost “quite some money” to fix.  The 69 A380s operated by airlines including  Qantas Airways
Ltd. (QAN)  and Emirates are safe to fly, Airbus CEO  Tom Enders 
reiterated today. The planemaker is hurrying to fix aircraft and
manufacturing processes as its sales and marketing departments
line up new customers, he said at the Singapore Airshow.  Qantas and  Singapore Airlines Ltd. (SIA)  are among carriers that
had to repair A380s after fissures were found in parts used to
support wings.  Europe ’s air safety regulator ordered that all
A380s be inspected for cracks after a certain number of flights.
Airbus says the cracks come from faulty manufacturing processes
and materials that are being re-engineered.  “We made the mistake and we are making repairs very
fast,” Enders told journalists at a briefing. “It will cost
quite some money. We can’t disclose definite numbers. It’s
unfortunate that this happened.”  Airbus predicted it will sell more A380s this year than
last, when it took orders for 19 of the planes from customers
including  Japan ’s Skymark Airlines Inc. and Cologne, Germany-
based  Deutsche Lufthansa AG (LHA) .  Sales Push  “I think we will have 30,”  John Leahy , chief operating
officer for commercial issues, said in an interview today
in Singapore. “I want my people to go out and replenish the
order book.”  Airbus has won orders for 253 A380s from 19 customers.
That compares with more than 1,500  Boeing Co. (BA)  747 jumbo jets,
which debuted in the late 1960s and dominated the market for
very large commercial aircraft for decades.  Airbus won orders for 32 of the double-deckers in 2010,
including 30 from Emirates, which has ordered 90 A380s, making
it by far the biggest customer.  The planemaker delivered 26 A380s last year and aims to
hand over about 30 this year, Enders said, as it pushes the
production rate from two a month toward three a month.  Airbus will bear the cost of inspecting all A380s in
service and repairing them. Airlines may also seek compensation
for leasing planes to compensate for A380s that are temporarily
out of service for inspections or repairs.  The faults may cost the planemaker’s parent, European
Aeronautic, Defence & Space Co., as much as 100 million euros
($132 million), Spiegel magazine reported this month, citing
people it didn’t identify, including Airbus officials. Airbus
and EADS have declined to comment on that figure, saying they’ll
give an update March 8 with EADS’s annual results.  To contact the reporters on this story:
