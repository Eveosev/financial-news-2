Sonatel (SNTS) , the Senegalese
telecommunications company that operates in four West African
nations, said profit fell 16 percent in 2011 as tax breaks in
Mali ended.  Net income for the unit of  France Telecom SA (FTE)  declined to
154.4 billion CFA francs ($306 million) from 184.8 billion
francs a year earlier, the company said in a statement e-mailed
by the Abidjan-based  Bourse Regionale des Valeurs Mobilieres .  Revenue at the company, the largest on the exchange with a
market capitalization of 1.24 billion francs, increased 6
percent to 635.4 billion francs, Sonatel said.  The drop in net income is due to “the end of the  tax
exemption  on the results” in Mali, Sonatel said in the
statement, without giving further details.  Mobile-phone subscribers rose 30 percent to 14.2 million,
while landline users increased 0.2 percent to 283,185, the
Dakar-based company said.  Internet users  rose 15 percent to
106,811.  Sonatel’s market share increased in Senegal, Guinea and
Guinea-Bissau and fell in Mali. France Telecom controls 42
percent of the company, with the Senegalese government,
shareholders and employees holding the remainder.  Sontael’s shares were unchanged at 124,000 francs in
Abidjan trading today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
