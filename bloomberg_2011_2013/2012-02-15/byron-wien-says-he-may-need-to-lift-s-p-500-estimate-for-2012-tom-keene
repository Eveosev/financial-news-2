Blackstone Group LP (BX) ’s  Byron Wien ,
whose prediction for the U.S. economy and stock market in 2011
proved too optimistic, said he may need to lift his estimate for
the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index for this year.  Wien, chairman of Blackstone’s advisory services unit, said
in January in his annual “10 Surprises” list the benchmark
gauge for U.S. stocks may exceed 1,400. He said today in a
Bloomberg Radio interview he may have to raise the projection.  “1,400 when the market was 1,250 at the beginning of the
year was a reasonable target, a conservative target,” Wien said
in an interview today on Bloomberg Radio’s “Bloomberg
Surveillance” with Tom Keene. “But I think we could well
exceed it. Look,  S&P 500  operating earnings are going to be in
excess of $100. Very often, almost always, the S&P 500 sells at
15 times, that would take you over 1,500.”  The  S&P 500  has jumped 7.4 percent this year to 1,350.50
through yesterday, as investors gained confidence the European
debt crisis won’t trigger a global recession and U.S. economic
data improved. Wien had said in January 2011 the S&P 500 would
rise toward 1,500 by year-end. The index was almost unchanged in
2011 at 1,257.60.  The measure is trading at 14 times profit in the last year
and 13 times  projected earnings  for 2012, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  “What’s jump-starting the market is the economy is better
than the consensus thought it was going to be at the beginning
of the year,” Wien said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
