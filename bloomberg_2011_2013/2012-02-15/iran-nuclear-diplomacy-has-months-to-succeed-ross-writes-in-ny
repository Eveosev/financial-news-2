Sanctions against  Iran  have created
the conditions for a negotiated outcome in the next few months,
Dennis B. Ross wrote in the New York Times.  Ross, who served two years on the National Security Council
as President  Barack Obama ’s special assistant on Iran, also said
that  Israel  should give measures against the Persian Gulf
nation a chance to work before pursuing military strikes against
nuclear installations.  “With Iran reeling from sanctions, the proper environment
now exists for diplomacy to work,” Ross wrote in an op-ed
published today. “The next few months will determine whether it
succeeds.”  Measures that target Iran’s oil industry and central bank
appear to have made the Islamic republic more willing to
negotiate, according to Ross, who also served as Secretary of
State  Hillary Clinton ’s special adviser on Iran. The
“dramatically” declining value of the Iranian rial, combined
with trade disruptions, may push the country to compromise, he
wrote.  “Iran’s government might try to draw out talks while
pursuing their nuclear program,” Ross wrote. “But if that is
their strategy, they will face even more onerous pressures, when
a planned European boycott of their oil begins on July 1.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
