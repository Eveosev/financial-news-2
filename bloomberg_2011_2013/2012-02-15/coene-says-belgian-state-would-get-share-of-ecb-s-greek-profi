European Central Bank Governing
Council member Luc Coene said  Belgium ’s central bank will break
down its share of any ECB profits on Greek bonds when
distributing a  dividend  to the Belgian state.  “What we agreed upon in the eurosystem is that we don’t
wish to make a profit on  Greece ,” Coene, the bank’s governor,
told reporters in Brussels on Feb. 14 in comments embargoed
until today. “So when we distribute profit from a given year to
the Belgian state, we will provide a breakdown of what’s due to
Greece and it’s then up to the government to decide how to use
it.”  Coene also said it was “still not clear” whether the
National Bank of Belgium would have to accept a loss along with
private creditors on the Greek sovereign bonds in its own
 investment portfolio . The Belgian central bank held about 700
million euros ($900 million) of Greek bonds for its own account,
according to its 2010  annual report .  International Monetary Fund Managing Director  Christine Lagarde  told reporters in Paris last month that European
governments and other public holders of Greek debt may have to
increase support if private creditors don’t go far enough.  Greek bonds bought by the ECB in its Securities Market
Program are exempt from a debt swap designed to halve the
nation’s privately held obligations by eliminating 100 billion
euros of debt. Talk of the ECB sharing losses is “unfounded,”
ECB President Mario Draghi said at a press conference in
 Frankfurt  last week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
