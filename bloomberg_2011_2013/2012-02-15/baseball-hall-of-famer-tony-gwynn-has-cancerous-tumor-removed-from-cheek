Tony Gwynn, an eight-time batting
champion and member of the  Baseball Hall of Fame , had surgery
yesterday to remove a cancerous tumor inside his right cheek.  Gwynn, 51, has blamed smokeless tobacco for the cancer and
previously had a malignant growth removed from the same spot in
August 2010. Doctors were to conduct further biopsies during
yesterday’s operation at the Moores Cancer Center at the
University of California San Diego.  If the cancer hasn’t spread, Gwynn should be able to return
as San Diego State’s baseball coach, the school said in a
 statement . Gwynn has coached at the university for the past nine
years.  Gwynn played for the  San Diego Padres  from 1982 to 2001 and
retired with a  .338 batting average . A record-tying eight-time
National League batting champion, Gwynn hit a career-high .394
in 1994 and was elected to the Hall of Fame in 2007.  Gwynn has said he used smokeless tobacco throughout his 20-
year playing career and twice was found to have benign growths
on the right side of his mouth.  In 2010, doctors discovered a malignant growth and Gwynn
underwent surgery to have most of it removed. He had more than
13 hours of surgery yesterday to take out a tumor from the same
spot,  ESPN reported , citing Gwynn’s wife Alicia. Doctors didn’t
believe the cancer had spread outside his salivary gland and
were expected to perform a nerve graft in an attempt to preserve
Gwynn’s facial functions, ESPN said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
