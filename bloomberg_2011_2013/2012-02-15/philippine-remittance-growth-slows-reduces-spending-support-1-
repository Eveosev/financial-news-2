Remittances (PHWRTTLY)  by Philippine citizens
abroad increased at a slower pace in December, clouding the
outlook for  consumer spending  and weakening support for growth.  The  funds  rose 6.2 percent from a year earlier to $1.8
billion, the central bank said in a statement in  Manila  today.
Remittances grew 10.6 percent in November and expanded 7.2
percent in 2011 to $20.1 billion.  Demand for labor overseas is falling as Europe’s debt
crisis prompts companies worldwide to reduce jobs. Bangko
Sentral ng Pilipinas cut its benchmark  interest rate  last month,
the first reduction since 2009, joining Asian policy makers from
Thailand to Indonesia who are lowering borrowing costs to buffer
their economies from weakening global demand.  “We may see some slowdown in remittances in the first half
of the year because of the impact from weaker economies in
Europe and Asia,” Betty Wang, a Hong Kong-based analyst at
Standard Chartered Plc., said before the report.  The benchmark Philippine Stock Exchange Composite Index was
little changed as of 2:07 p.m. in Manila.  President  Benigno Aquino  is increasing spending to a record
to help boost growth to as much as 8 percent annually. The
 economy  expanded 3.7 percent in the fourth quarter from a year
earlier, compared with 3.6 percent in the previous three months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
