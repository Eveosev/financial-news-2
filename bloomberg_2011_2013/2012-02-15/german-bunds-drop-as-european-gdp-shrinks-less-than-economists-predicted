German 10-year bunds extended a
decline after data showed  Europe â€™s economy contracted less than
economists forecast in the fourth quarter.  The 10-year bund yield rose four basis points to 1.94
percent as of 10:08 a.m. London time.  Gross domestic product in the 17-nation euro area fell 0.3
percent from the prior three months, the first drop since the
second quarter of 2009. Economists forecast a drop of 0.4
percent, the median of 42 estimates in a Bloomberg News survey
shows.  To contact the reporter on this story:
