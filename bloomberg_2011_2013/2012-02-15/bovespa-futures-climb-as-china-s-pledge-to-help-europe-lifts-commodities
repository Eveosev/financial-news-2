The Bovespa index rebounded from
yesterday’s drop as consumer-goods maker  Hypermarcas SA (HYPE3)  rallied
after a report that showed slowing Brazilian inflation fueled
bets that further interest-rate cuts will help companies that
sell to the local market.  Retailer  Lojas Renner SA (LREN3)  jumped the most in one month.
 Brasil Brokers Participacoes (BBRK3)  was the best performer on the
BM&FBovespa Real Estate Index after it agreed to buy a competing
Brazilian real estate brokerage. Steelmaker  Companhia
Siderurgica Nacional SA (CSNA3)  dropped to a one-month low after it was
cut to “neutral” from “outperform” at Credit Suisse.  Brazil ’s benchmark equity gauge gained 0.5 percent to
65,368.49 at the close of trading in  Sao Paulo . Fifty-one stocks
rose on the gauge, while 19 declined. The real weakened 0.2
percent to 1.7285 per  U.S. dollar .  “We’re always a bit more sanguine about the risks of
inflation as opposed to the bigger risk of slowing,” Michael
Henderson, an emerging-markets economist at Capital Economics
Ltd., said by phone from  London . “We think there’s more room
for easing.”  Brazil’s inflation, as measured by the IGP-10 index, slowed
to 0.04 percent in February, from 0.08 percent a month earlier,
according to the Rio de Janeiro-based Getulio Vargas Foundation.
The figure trailed the 0.14 percent median estimate of 34
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Yields on Brazilian interest-
rate futures contracts due in January 2013 touched a record low
9.25 percent.  Brasil Brokers, CSN  Brasil Brokers surged 6.5 percent to 7.40 reais. The
company agreed to pay 25.5 million reais for a 55 percent stake
in Bamberg Planejamento & Empreendimento Imobiliarios, according
to a regulatory filing yesterday.  CSN, as Cia. Siderurgica is known, lost 2.4 percent to
17.45 reais, the lowest since Jan. 19.  BM&FBovespa SA (BVMF3) , the operator of  Latin America ’s biggest
securities exchange, fell 2.2 percent to 12.04 reais after it
reported fourth-quarter earnings that trailed estimates.
Adjusted net income, which excludes extraordinary events, was
352.7 million reais ($204.1 million), below the average estimate
of 377.3 million reais from nine analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  The Bovespa dropped yesterday as metals prices declined
after a report showing U.S. retail sales trailed estimates
rekindled concern that global growth will falter.  The Bovespa has advanced 15 percent this year, after
slumping 18 percent in 2011, buoyed by Brazil’s interest-rate
cuts, signs of growth in the U.S. and renewed optimism  Europe 
may be closer to solving its debt crisis. The gauge trades at
10.5 times analysts’ earnings estimates, which compares with a
ratio of 10.6 for  MSCI Inc. (MSCI) ’s measure of 21 developing nations’
equities, weekly data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Traders  moved  9.79 billion reais in stocks in Sao Paulo
yesterday, data compiled by Bloomberg show. That compares with a
daily average of 6.59 billion reais this year through Feb. 7,
according to data from the exchange.  To contact the reporters on this story:
