Chileâ€™s reservoirs are at 40 percent
of their capacity as a drought reduces the amount of water
available for power generation and irrigation,  El Mercurio  said,
citing the Public Works Ministry.  The reservoirs held 5.2 billion cubic meters (1.4 trillion
gallons) of water in January, down 13 percent from the previous
month and 1.6 percent from a year earlier, the Santiago-based
newspaper reported today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
