A farmer group calling itself
Friends of the Canadian Wheat Board said today it is filing a
federal lawsuit seeking class-action status that aims to
reinstate the Wheat Board’s grain-marketing monoply.  The group said in an e-mailed  statement  that the lawsuit
may seek $17 billion in damages incurred from the open-market
system.  Canada ’s Conservative government passed a law in
December that will end the Wheat Board’s control over marketing
in Western Canada on Aug. 1. The monopoly has been in place
since 1943.  The filing couldn’t be immediately confirmed in court
records.  To contact the reporter on this story:
