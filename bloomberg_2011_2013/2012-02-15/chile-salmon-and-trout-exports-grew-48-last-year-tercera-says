Chile exported a record $2.9 billion
of salmon and trout last year, up 48 percent from 2010 as the
industry recovers from the impact of a virus that damaged fish
stocks from 2008,  La Tercera  said, citing the countryâ€™s customs
agency.  Production will increase gradually this year, the Santiago-
based newspaper reported in its print edition today, citing
Carlos Odebret, chief executive officer of industry association
SalmonChile.  To contact the reporter on this story:
