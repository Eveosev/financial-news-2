Egypt will offer 13.5 billion pounds
($2.2 billion) in debt over the next week after the  finance
ministry  assured investors it would “safeguard” the currency’s
exchange rate.  Domestic borrowing costs for the North African country are
at record highs as foreign investors withdrew amid the turmoil
that followed the ouster of President  Hosni Mubarak  a year ago.
The yield on  one-year treasury bills  climbed for the 16th
consecutive auction last week to 15.975 percent, the highest
since Bloomberg started tracking the data in 2006.  Finance Minister Momtaz el-Saieed and the central bank both
denied a newspaper report that cited an unidentified central
bank official as saying he expected the dollar to strengthen in
the “coming short period” by 5 percent against the pound.
“We’ve increased our efforts to raise money from Egyptians
abroad,” el-Saieed said yesterday. “We’re offering
certificates of deposits and land, and we expect these dollars
will help stabilize the situation.”  The yield on  Egypt ’s 5.75 percent dollar bonds due in 2020
retreated for a second day, losing one basis point, or 0.01 of a
percentage point, to 7.22 percent at 12:09 p.m. in Cairo,
according to prices compiled by Bloomberg. The rate dropped 12
basis points yesterday after five days of gains. The pound was
little changed at 6.0355 a dollar.  The Arab country will seek bids for 3.5 billion pounds each
of  six-  and twelve-month securities tomorrow and seek bids for
the same amount in  nine-month notes  on Feb. 19, according to
central bank data on Bloomberg. It will offer five- and seven-
year bonds valued at 2 billion pounds and 1 billion pounds,
respectively on Feb. 20, the data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
