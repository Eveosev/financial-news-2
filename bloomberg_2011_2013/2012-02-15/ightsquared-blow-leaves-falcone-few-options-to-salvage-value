Billionaire Philip Falcone’s effort
to build a national wireless network was rejected by U.S.
regulators, leaving him limited options to salvage value from
his LightSquared Inc. assets and dealing a blow to efforts to
increase industry competition.  The Federal Communications Commission said yesterday it
won’t let LightSquared begin service after an Obama
administration adviser found that it disrupts navigation gear
used by planes, boats and autos. Closely held LightSquared
invested $4 billion in airwaves crucial to its plan to offer
service that lets users browse the Web at higher speeds.  The setback threatens to leave the industry with one fewer
competitor, harming regulators’ attempts to spur rivalry and
benefiting incumbents, such as  AT&T Inc. (T)  and  Clearwire Corp. (CLWR) 
LightSquared’s options include selling the spectrum, swapping it
for better airwaves, suing the government and reducing costs to
stay afloat until a solution is found, said Walt Piecyk, an
analyst at BTIG LLC in New York.  “A reorganization might be considered in a situation like
this,” Piecyk said. “If the spectrum is deemed unusable they
have to cut costs as much as they possibly can, because it might
be hard to raise additional capital.”  The rejection is a blow to Falcone’s Harbinger Capital
Partners hedge fund, which has invested about $3 billion in
LightSquared. Harbinger lost 47 percent for investors in its
main hedge fund last year as Falcone, 49, was forced to cut the
value of Reston, Virginia-based LightSquared by more than half.  ‘Dirty’ Spectrum  The FCC said it is preparing to withdraw the preliminary
approval it granted last year for LightSquared to build a
network serving as many as 260 million people. Government tests
found that the proposed ground-based network would interfere
with navigation equipment including gear used by aircraft,
Lawrence Strickling, administrator of the  National
Telecommunications and Information Administration , said in a
letter to the FCC.  “There are no mitigation strategies that both solve the
interference issues and provide LightSquared with an adequate
commercial network deployment,” Strickling said in the letter
to FCC Chairman  Julius Genachowski .  “The reality is, you don’t want to put people’s safety at
risk,” John Fletcher, a senior analyst at SNL Kagan. “Their
options seem pretty limited at this point. If your main asset is
spectrum, and it’s dirty, maybe it’s not much of an asset.”  LightSquared said in a statement that it disagreed with the
government’s findings and that it “fully expects” the FCC “to
recognize LightSquared’s legal rights to build its $14 billion,
privately financed network.”  Out of Time?  Financially, the company may not have enough time to
attempt to work through the interference issues. Jonathan Atkin,
a San Francisco-based analyst with RBC Capital Markets LLC, said
last month that LightSquared may run out of money within six
months. While the company has signed on initial customers,
including Best Buy Co., it has yet to start operating and
earning revenue.  LightSquared Chief Executive Officer  Sanjiv Ahuja  said in a
Dec. 9 interview that the company would be adequately funded
through the government’s review period.  Subprime Bets  Falcone, who founded Harbinger in 2001, bet millions in
2006 that securities cobbled together from subprime mortgages
would collapse, making the fund $11 billion in 2007. In 2008,
the fund was one of the world’s most successful hedge funds,
with assets of $26 billion.  Today, Falcone manages about $4 billion as Harbinger’s
chairman and chief executive officer. The main fund valued its
equity and loans in LightSquared at $1.07 billion as of Jan. 27,
according to a loan document. Harbinger Capital Partners LLC
owns additional shares and loans of LightSquared outside of the
main fund. Falcone’s stake in the main fund is worth at least
$850 million.  Harbinger is paying a 15 percent interest rate for a $190
million loan, almost triple what the riskiest corporate
borrowers pay, said two people with knowledge of the loan.  As LightSquared’s spectrum challenges threatened to dim its
prospects, billionaire  Carl Icahn , along with investors  David Tepper  and Andrew Beal, in December bought $300 million in the
venture’s debt sold by Farallon Capital Management LLC. The move
may help give Icahn control of LightSquared’s spectrum for less
than what Falcone originally paid.  30 Partners  An FCC rejection could unravel LightSquared’s agreements
with more than 30 wholesale customers that had signed on to be
users of the planned wireless network.  Sprint Nextel Corp. (S) , the third-biggest U.S. wireless
carrier, is one of LightSquared’s main partners. Under their
agreement, Sprint was to build and operate LightSquared’s
network during an 11-year period in exchange for $9 billion in
payments and an additional $4.5 billion in service credits.  Anticipating a final rejection by the FCC, Sprint has been
distancing itself from the project.  “We’ll cross that bridge when we come to it,” Sprint
Chief Executive Officer  Dan Hesse  said in a phone interview last
week, referring to the FCC’s decision.  Late last year, Sprint signed a new agreement with its
joint-venture partner Clearwire, which extends its network
expansion plans through 2016, Hesse said. “We are not spending
any more money today on putting new equipment in our network to
support LightSquared,” Hesse said.  “If they lose the Sprint arrangement, that brings into
question the overall viability,” says John Byrne, a research
director at IDC Corp.  Readying Alternatives  Another LightSquared customer, FreedomPop, said today it
will use Clearwire’s network. FreedomPop, a mobile data and
phone service based in  Los Angeles , is the latest effort from
serial entrepreneur Niklas Zennstrom, who co-founded Skype
Technologies SA with Janus Friis, and later sold it to EBay Inc.
Zennstrom is an investor and adviser for FreedomPop, not an
executive.  LightSquared not being able to begin operating would also
be a setback to the FCC, which has been pushing to make more
spectrum available to mobile device users, potentially reducing
the dominance of AT&T and  Verizon Wireless  and keeping prices
for consumers lower. The LightSquared proposal looked like a way
to take underused spectrum and redeploy it in an arena where
capacities are more limited.  “The FCC is clearly interested in increasing competition
for AT&T and Verizon,” Piecyk said.  Dish, Clearwire  In addition to the dominant wireless carriers, benefactors
from LightSquared’s rejection could include  Dish Network Corp. (DISH) ,
which is also seeking approval for its wireless spectrum and
whose airwaves don’t have “any of the same kind of issues” as
LightSquared, Piecyk said.  Dish, the second-largest U.S. satellite-television
provider, acquired airwaves from the bankruptcies of satellite
companies DBSD North America Inc. and TerreStar Networks Inc.
Dish is seeking a waiver to convert the airwaves to mobile-phone
spectrum.  Clearwire, a wholesale wireless-service provider and direct
competitor to LightSquared, is also set to become more
important, particularly through its deal to work with Sprint on
a faster, so-called fourth-generation service, Byrne said.  Dish shares rose 2.5 percent to $29.07 at 9:42 a.m. New
York time, and Clearwire added 4.4 percent to $2.39.  “Both Clearwire and LightSquared were going to figure into
Sprint’s 4G plans,” Byrne said. “Clearwire will still be part
of this solution, and a more important part of this solution.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
