Chris Robshaw, who was  England ’s
captain as the team won its first two matches in rugby’s 6
Nations tournament, will keep the title for the remainder of the
event, coach Stuart Lancaster said.  The flanker led the team to victories in Scotland and
Italy, and will be in charge during the home match against Wales
on Feb. 25, England’s Rugby Football Union said today in an e-
mailed statement.  “Chris has stepped into the role well and led a new team
in two tough away fixtures,” Lancaster said. “He is one of
many leaders we could have chosen against Scotland and Italy but
he has shown on and off the field the qualities required to
captain a side.”  The 25-year-old had played once for England before taking
over as captain as the start of the tournament. The squad hosts
Wales, which is also undefeated, at Twickenham in  London .  Robshaw took over as captain for the retired  Lewis Moody .  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
