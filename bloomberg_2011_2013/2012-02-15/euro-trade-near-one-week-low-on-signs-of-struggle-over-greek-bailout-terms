The euro rose as a report that the
 European Central Bank  is exchanging Greek bonds for new
securities bolstered speculation the nation will get its second
bailout.  The dollar erased gains against a majority of its most-
traded counterparts after data showed manufacturing in the
Philadelphia area expanded by the fastest in four months and
initial jobless claims fell to the lowest in four years.
Sweden’s krona dropped to a two-week low after the central bank
cut interest rates. The pound rose against the dollar as
 consumer confidence  improved in January.  “The bond swap implies that the second bailout is likely
to happen,” said  Jack Spitz , managing director of foreign
exchange at National Bank of  Canada  in Toronto. “The narrowing
of spreads in the  bond market  are precipitating a sense that the
second bailout is more likely to happen by March 20 and the euro
is benefiting.”  The euro rose 0.5 percent to $1.3130 at 5 p.m. in New York
after sliding to $1.2974, the lowest level since Jan. 25. The
common currency rose 1.1 percent to 103.65 yen after touching
103.84 yen, the highest level since Dec. 12. The dollar
appreciated 0.7 percent to 78.94 yen after hitting 78.97 yen,
the strongest level since Nov. 1.  Bond Swap  The ECB is swapping its 50 billion-euro ($65 billion) Greek
government bond holdings for new Greek bonds, three euro-area
officials said. The swap may be completed by Feb. 20 and could
pave the way for a private sector bond swap that aims to slice
about 100 billion euros off  Greece ’s debt. An ECB spokesman
declined to comment on the report.  The Australian dollar rose 0.5 percent to $1.0755 and
 Brazil ’s real gained 0.7 percent to 1.7164 per dollar as the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index erased losses to trade 1.1 percent
stronger.  Australia ’s currency was also supported as the nation’s
payrolls increased by the most since November 2010.  U.S. data today showed improvement in the labor and housing
markets as well as consumer sentiment. First-time  jobless claims 
unexpectedly declined 13,000 last week to 348,000, the fewest
since March 2008, Labor Department figures showed. The Federal
Reserve Bank of Philadelphia’s general economic  index  increased
to 10.2, higher than projected, from 7.3 last month.  ‘Biggest Headline’  “There is so much back and forth on this Greek situation,
yet U.S. stocks have reacted quite well today to the data,”
said Carl Forcheski, a director on the corporate-currency sales
desk at Societe Generale SA in  New York . “The biggest headline
was the initial claims data and it’s showing some good
progress.”  Norway’s krone and Canada’s dollar advanced as crude oil
futures reached a five-week high in New York. The krone rose 0.9
percent to 5.7291 per dollar and the Canadian currency gained
0.3 percent to 99.66 cents per dollar. Oil for March delivery
gained 0.5 percent to $102.39 per barrel in New York after
touching $102.69, the highest since Jan. 12.  Sterling rose 0.2 percent to 83.13 pence per euro and
gained 0.7 percent to $1.5800.  Nationwide Building Society  said
its U.K. sentiment index climbed to 47 in January from 38 the
previous month. A gauge of consumers’ outlook for the economy
jumped by 14 points, the Swindon, England-based customer-owned
lender said.  The krona fluctuated after earlier weakening as the
Riksbank lowered its forecast for future  interest rates , citing
a drag on exports from  Europe ’s debt crisis.  The krona was little changed at 6.7227 per dollar after
touching 6.7918, the weakest since Feb. 1. It slipped 0.5
percent to 8.8273 per euro.  To contact the reporter on this story:
