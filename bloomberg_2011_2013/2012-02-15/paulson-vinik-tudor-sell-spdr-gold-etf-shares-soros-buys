Paulson & Co., the hedge fund
founded by billionaire  John Paulson , cut its stake in the SPDR
Gold Trust for the second straight quarter, while billionaire
investor  George Soros  increased his holdings.  Paulson held 17.3 million shares in the exchange-traded
 fund  backed by bullion as of Dec. 31, 15 percent less than the
20.3 million on Sept. 30, Securities and Exchange Commission
filings showed yesterday. He is still the biggest stakeholder.
Vinik Asset Management LP, Tudor Investment Corp. and SAC
Capital Advisors LP also sold shares. Lone Pine Capital LLC
added holdings.  In the fourth quarter, gold futures fell for the first time
in more than three years, partly on sales to cover losses in
equity markets. A global rout in the third quarter erased more
than $9.7 trillion from the value of stocks, and hedge-fund
holdings in  SPDR gold shares (GLD)  fell by $660.5 million last
quarter, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Paulson said that now
is the time to invest in the metal to hedge against inflation.  “Gold was one of the best performers last year, so they
sold the asset to bail them out of other losses,” Michael A. Gayed, the chief investment strategist who helps oversee $150
million at New York-based Pension Partners LLC, said in a
telephone interview. “We are seeing people piling into gold
again with an improvement in stock markets and commodities.”  European Debt  Last month, gold jumped 11 percent, the biggest January
rally in 29 years, on concern that  Europe ’s debt crisis would
escalate, spurring demand for a haven. The  Federal Reserve 
affirmed its benchmark  interest rate  will remain close to zero
percent until at least late 2014, weakening the dollar and
boosting the appeal of commodities as alternative investments.  Gold futures for April delivery climbed 0.9 percent to 
$1,732.90 an ounce at 12:39 p.m. on the Comex in New York.
The metal surged to an all-time high of $1,923.70 on Sept. 6.  “The fear trade is pulling people back to gold,” Jeffrey Sica, the Morristown, New Jersey-based president of SICA Wealth
Management who helps oversee $1 billion of assets, said in a
telephone interview. “We will see gold prices rise to a record
this year.”  Assets in the SPDR Gold Trust, the largest ETF backed by
the metal, rose to an all-time high of 1,309.92 metric tons on
Aug. 8 and were at 1,278.26 tons yesterday. Global  holdings  in
exchange-traded products were 2,390.729 tons, approaching the
Dec. 13 record, according to Bloomberg data.  Paulson Letter  In a letter to investors obtained by Bloomberg, Paulson
said, “By the time inflation becomes evident, gold will
probably have moved, which implies that now is the time to build
a position in gold.”  The euro is structurally flawed and will fall apart
eventually, according to the letter. The collapse may be
triggered by a Greek default, Paulson said.  Paulson, which manages $23 billion, had its worst year ever
in 2011 as the Advantage Plus Fund lost 51 percent. The New
York-based fund uses SPDR holdings for the gold-denominated
share classes.  The company cut its American depositary receipts in
AngloGold Ashanti Ltd., the second-largest stake in its reported
portfolio, by 6.5 percent to 34.3 million.  Armel Leslie , a spokesman, declined to comment.  In the third quarter, Paulson reduced holdings in the SPDR
gold ETF by 36 percent from 31.5 million shares. In the second
half, the stake fell 45 percent.  Vinik, Tudor  Vinik Asset Management, the Boston-based hedge fund founded
by Jeffrey Vinik, who formerly ran the Fidelity Magellan Fund,
held 2.6 million shares in the SPDR gold ETF as of Dec. 31, down
775,000 shares from the end of the third quarter.  Tudor Investment, the $11 billion hedge fund based in
Greenwich,  Connecticut , sold an entire stake of 200,000 shares.
 Patrick Clifford , a spokesman, declined to comment.  Steven A. Cohen ’s SAC Capital and New York-based Touradji
Capital Management LP cut their positions. Stamford,
Connecticut-based SAC Capital, which manages $14 billion, held
179,601 shares, compared with 184,601 in the third quarter.
Jonathan Gasthalter, a spokesman, declined to comment.  Touradji Capital, founded by Paul Touradji, sold its entire
stake of 45,000 shares. The hedge fund bought the securities in
the third quarter. Leslie, also a spokesman for Touradji,
declined to comment. Stevens Capital Management LLC sold its
entire stake of 77,019 shares. GLG Partners LP sold its holding
of 94,675 shares.  Soros, Lone Pine  Soros Fund Management LLC increased its stake to 85,450
shares from 48,350.  Michael Vachon , a spokesman for Soros,
didn’t respond to a voicemail. Lone Pine, the hedge fund run by
Stephen Mandel Jr., acquired 3.75 million shares.  Money managers who oversee more than $100 million in
equities must file a Form 13F with the SEC within 45 days of
each quarter’s end to show their U.S.-listed stocks, options and
convertible bonds. The filings don’t show non-U.S. securities or
how much cash the firms hold.  Central banks around the world added 157 tons of gold to
their holdings in the six months ended Nov. 30, World Gold
Council data show.  South Korea ,  Thailand ,  Turkey  and  Russia  were
among countries that added the metal to reserves in 2011.  To contact the reporters on this story:
