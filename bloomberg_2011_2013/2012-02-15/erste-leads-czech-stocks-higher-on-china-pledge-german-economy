Erste Group Bank AG (RBAG)  led Czech stocks
higher after China’s pledge to invest in Europe’s bailout fund
and better-than-expected economic data from Germany and France
boosted demand for riskier assets.  Erste climbed 2.9 percent to 473.4 koruna by 9:37 a.m. in
 Prague , after yesterday’s 3.1 percent loss. That made it the
best performer in the  PX (PX)  equity gauge today, which advanced 0.9
percent. Erste has a 22 percent weighting in the benchmark.  To contact the reporter on this story:
