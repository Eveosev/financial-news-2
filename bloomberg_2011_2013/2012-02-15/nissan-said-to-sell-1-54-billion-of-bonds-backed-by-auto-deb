Nissan Motor Co. (7201)  sold $1.54 billion
of bonds backed by auto loans in the automaker’s largest issue
of the debt since 2005, according to a person familiar with the
offering.  The sale was increased from $1 billion, said the person,
who declined to be identified because terms aren’t public. A
top-ranked portion maturing in 2.3 years yields 15 basis points
more than the benchmark swap rate.  Automakers are boosting asset-backed sales as investor
seeks bonds tied to vehicle lending. Honda Motor Co. yesterday
increased its sale of securities backed loans by $440 million to
$1.69 billion in its largest offering since 2009. Ford Motor Co.
last week sold $2.3 billion of so-called floor-plan debt, tied
to inventory loans to dealers, in its largest offering of the
securities since 2005, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The issue was increased from $1 billion.  Bond offerings connected to automobile sales are dominating
asset-backed sales this year. Deals linked to car and truck
sales accounted for $10 billion of the $18 billion in 2012
asset-backed issuance prior to this week’s sales, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Sales of the securities may jump 11
percent to about $63 billion this year, accounting for about 55
percent of bonds tied to consumer borrowing, according to Wells
Fargo Securities LLC estimates.  Nissan sold $1.54 billion of asset-backed securities linked
to auto loans in January 2005, Bloomberg data show.  The extra yield investors demand to own top-ranked bonds
backed by auto loans instead of Treasuries has declined 26 basis
points this year to 69 basis points and last week reached 67,
the lowest since Aug. 1, according to a Bank of America Merrill
Lynch index. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
