  Spain ’s underlying inflation rate
slowed in January as the economy edged closer to a second
recession in two years.  Core consumer prices , which exclude energy and fresh food,
gained 1.3 percent from a year earlier, compared with 1.5
percent in December, the National Statistics Institute in Madrid
said today. Headline inflation, based on European Union
calculations, was 2 percent, matching an initial estimate on
Jan. 31.  Spain’s economy may shrink 1.5 percent this year, the Bank
of Spain estimates, as the government tightens its budget for
the third year. The deepest credit squeeze on record and the 23
percent unemployment rate, the European Union’s highest, are
also crimping household spending.  Spanish inflation, which  outpaced  the euro-region average
for most of the past decade, is now lower than the European
rate. Euro-region inflation was 2.7 percent in January, the
European Union’s statistics office said on Feb. 1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
