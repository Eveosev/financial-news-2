Bulgaria ’s economic recovery slowed
in the fourth quarter, as exports to the European Union declined
because of the euro-area’s debt crisis.  Gross domestic product  grew 1.5 percent from a year ago,
compared with 1.6 percent in the previous three months, the
Sofia-based Statistics Institute said today in a preliminary
estimate. The  median estimate  of four economists surveyed by
Bloomberg was 1.3 percent. Seasonally adjusted growth was 0.4
percent from the previous quarter.  The sovereign-debt crisis in the euro area, which buys 60
percent of Bulgaria’s exports, is curbing economic growth in the
EU’s poorest country by per-capita GDP as it emerges from its
first recession in more than a decade through exports of its
metals, machinery, textiles and furniture.  The  International Monetary Fund  cut its GDP forecasts for
Bulgaria on Dec. 9 to 1.9 percent in 2011 and 1.3 percent in
2012.  Growth (EUGNEMUQ)  in the euro region slowed to 0.1 percent in the
third quarter from 0.2 percent in the previous three months of
2011 as governments cut spending to rein in budget deficits.  Bulgarians have cut  consumer spending  and increased savings
to shield against unemployment, which rose to 10.4 percent in
2011, the highest in almost two years. Personal and household
deposits among the population of 7.3 million rose 4.1 percent to
2.6 billion lev in last year, the central bank said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
