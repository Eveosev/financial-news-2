German bunds fell as reports showed
the nation’s gross domestic product fell less than analysts
estimated last quarter and France’s economy unexpectedly
expanded, reducing demand for the safest fixed-income assets.  Bunds declined for the second time in three days after the
People’s Bank of China said the nation will participate in
resolving  Europe ’s debt crisis, even as European officials put
pressure on  Greece  to deliver additional budget cuts.  Portugal 
is scheduled to auction as much as 3 billion euros ($4 billion)
of 91-, 182- and 371-day bills today.  The German 10-year bund yield rose one basis point, or 0.01
percentage point, to 1.92 percent at 8:01 a.m. London time. The
2 percent bond due in January 2022 fell 0.115, or 1.15 euro
cents per 1,000-euro face amount, to 100.755.  German GDP, adjusted for seasonal effects, fell 0.2 percent
from the third quarter, the Federal Statistics Office said
today. Economists had forecast a 0.3 percent decline, according
to the median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey.  France ’s
economy expanded 0.2 percent, versus economist estimates for a
0.2 percent drop.  European finance ministers canceled a meeting slated for
today and will hold a conference call instead to push Greece on
austerity measures. The indebted nation needs a new financial
aid package in order before 14.5 billion euros of bonds mature
on March 20.  German bunds have handed investors a 0.4 percent loss in
2012, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the
European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. Greek bonds
lost 0.5 percent in the period and Italian bonds made a profit
of 8.7 percent, the indexes show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
