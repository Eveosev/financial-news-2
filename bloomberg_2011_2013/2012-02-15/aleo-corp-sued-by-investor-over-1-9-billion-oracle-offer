Taleo Corp. (TLEO)  was sued by an investor
claiming the human-resources software company failed to get the
best price in its planned $1.9 billion acquisition by  Oracle
Corp. (ORCL)   Hillary Coyne contends Taleo directors are duty-bound to
maximize  shareholder value  in such a sale, and violated that
duty by agreeing to the $46 per-share buyout, according to a
complaint filed yesterday in Delaware Chancery Court in
Wilmington.  The offer “does not account for Taleo’s expected future
growth,” and “particularly its July 2011 acquisition of
JobPartners, which significantly expanded the company’s presence
in Europe,” Coyne’s lawyers said in court papers.  Oracle, based in Redwood City, California, said Feb. 9 it
would buy Taleo in part to expand so-called cloud computing,
which provides software, storage and other services from remote
data centers.  Caroline Japic, a spokeswoman for Dublin, California-based
Taleo, declined to comment on the lawsuit.  Shares of Taleo fell 2 cents to $45.77 in Nasdaq stock
market trading in New York at 10:24 a.m.  The case is Coyne v. Taleo, CA7245,  Delaware  Chancery Court
(Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
