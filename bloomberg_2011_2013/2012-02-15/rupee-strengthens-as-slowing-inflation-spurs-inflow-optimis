India ’s rupee strengthened after
inflation eased to the slowest pace in more than two years,
boosting demand for the nation’s assets.  Wholesale-price increases cooled to 6.55 percent in
January, from 7.47 percent the month before, official data
showed yesterday. That was the least since November 2009. The
BSE India  Sensitive Index (SENSEX)  of shares reached a six-month high
after foreign funds boosted holdings of the nation’s stocks by
$2 billion this month through Feb. 13, exchange data show.  “The inflation data is a big positive,” said Vikas Babu,
a currency trader at state-run  Andhra Bank  in Mumbai. “There
are expectations of inflows, which will support the currency.”  The rupee advanced 0.2 percent to 49.2887 per dollar in
Mumbai, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The currency
has rallied 7.7 percent this year after declining 16 percent in
2011. Currency and bond markets in Mumbai are shut tomorrow for
a provincial election.  Three-month onshore rupee forwards traded at 50.28 per
dollar, compared with 50.32 yesterday, while offshore non-
deliverable contracts were at 50.25 from 50.26. Forwards are
agreements to buy or sell assets at a set price and date. Non-
deliverable contracts are settled in dollars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
