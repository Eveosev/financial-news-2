X5 Retail Group NV (FIVE)  jumped the most
in two weeks after a newspaper reported that  Wal-Mart Stores
Inc. (WMT)  may acquire the Russian retailer’s hypermarket chain
Karusel to enter the local market.  X5 surged as much as 5.4 percent to $26.41, its biggest
intraday gain since Feb. 1, and traded up 0.5 percent at $25.20
as of 3:40 p.m. in  London .  X5, based in the Russian capital, may get as much as $2
billion for Karusel and announce the decision a few weeks after
a board meeting that’s scheduled for tomorrow,  Delovoy Peterburg 
reported, citing unidentified people familiar with the matter.  Svetlana Vitkovskaya, an X5 spokeswoman in Moscow, denied
that the company is in talks with Wal-Mart, though she confirmed
the board will meet tomorrow, without elaborating.  To contact the reporter on this story:
