Turkey  rejected an appeal by retired
Chief of General Staff Ilker Basbug to be tried by the Supreme
Court in connection with an investigation of alleged coup plots
against Prime Minister  Recep Tayyip Erdogan , Milliyet  reported .  A committee of judges and prosecutors in Ankara ruled that
the highest ranking officer implicated in the Ergenekon case
can’t be tried by Turkey’s top court because the charges against
him aren’t related to his duty as the former head of the armed
forces, according to the Istanbul-based newspaper. Prosecutors
imprisoned Basbug in January for establishing and leading an
armed terrorist organization seeking to overthrow the
government, Milliyet said.  The decision is procedural and doesn’t mean that Basbug
can’t be tried by the  Supreme Court , Milliyet reported, citing
Ilkay Sezer, the retired general’s lawyer. Sezer, who argued
Jan. 20 that the constitution mandates a trial at the top court,
said Basbug will object to the ruling at his hearing, according
to Milliyet. The former military chief denies the charges, which
he described as “tragi-comic.”  More than 250 military officers are in jail as part of the
Ergenekon and Balyoz, or Sledgehammer, cases that also
imprisoned scores of journalists, politicians and academics for
alleged coup plots. The first wave of arrests started July 2007.  To contact the reporter on this story:
