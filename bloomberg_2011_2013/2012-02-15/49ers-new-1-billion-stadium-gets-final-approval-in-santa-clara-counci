The city council in Santa Clara,
 California , voted 5-1 in favor of an $878.6 million contract
that should allow the  San Francisco  49ers to move into a new
stadium there by the 2014 season.  Council members voted last night for three resolutions that
clear the way for construction of the $1 billion, 68,500-seat
arena in the heart of Silicon Valley.  Building will begin in July, about six months ahead of plan,
allowing the 49ers to move a season earlier than expected.  National Football League owners approved a $200 million
loan this month that will help cover construction costs.  In December, the  Santa Clara Stadium Authority  unanimously
approved an $850 million construction loan for the stadium.
 Santa Clara  voters approved a ballot measure in June 2010 that
authorized the city to lease land for a stadium next to the
Great America amusement park.  The 49ers play their home games at 51-year-old  Candlestick
Park , where power failures led to two delays of a Monday Night
Football game against the Pittsburgh Steelers in December. Santa
Clara is about 45 miles south of San Francisco.  To contact the reporter on this story:
