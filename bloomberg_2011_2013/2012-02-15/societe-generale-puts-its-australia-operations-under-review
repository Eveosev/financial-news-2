Societe Generale SA (GLE) , France’s
second-largest lender, is reviewing its operations in  Australia 
as  Europe ’s debt crisis spurs banks to scale back lending in the
nation.  “A number of options regarding our set up in Australia are
currently under review,” said Hong Kong-based spokeswoman Kate
Henley in a phone interview today, declining to comment further.
The Paris-based lender has an equipment finance unit and a
corporate and investment banking unit in Sydney, according to
its  website .  European banks are cutting costs as they prepare for
regulations on minimum capital levels and the sovereign-debt
crisis persists, threatening revenue from trading and investment
banking. Financial firms globally announced more than 200,000
job losses in 2011, up from about 58,000 in 2010, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Societe Generale plans to cut about 1,580 jobs at its
corporate and investment bank, including 700 staff in countries
other than  France , a spokeswoman said last month.  BNP Paribas SA said Nov. 16 it plans to cut about 1,400
jobs at its corporate and investment banking division, or 6.5
percent of the unit’s staff worldwide.  European banks provided about 10 percent of syndicated
lending in Australia in 2011, down from an average 20 percent in
the two years prior, the  Reserve Bank  of Australia wrote in its
quarterly monetary policy  statement  released Feb. 10.  Societe Generale helped provide loans in Australia in 2011
for Paladin Energy Ltd., Origin Energy Ltd. and a project
finance facility to fund the construction of a hospital in the
state of South Australia, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. It had a 0.4 percent share of the Australia and  New
Zealand  syndicated loan market, down from 1.1 percent in 2010,
the data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
