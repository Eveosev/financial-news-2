Global sales of organic products
rose 9.2 percent in 2010 on stronger U.S., French and German
consumption, an annual report on organic agriculture showed.  Sales climbed to $59.1 billion from $54.1 billion in 2009,
the International Federation of Organic Agriculture Movements
said in a  statement  on its website dated yesterday.  Organic farmers avoid using products such as synthetic
pesticides and chemical fertilizers on crops. While the method
typically lowers yields in industrial countries, organic
agriculture can boost yields for traditional farmers who employ
few crop treatments,  according  to the  United Nations ’  Food and
Agriculture Organization .  “The market for organic products continues to grow,” the
Bonn, Germany-based federation said. “The first figures
available for 2011 show further growth.”  The land area under organic agriculture was little changed
in 2010 at 37 million hectares (91.4 million acres) from 37.1
million hectares a year earlier, according to the federation’s
report and the Frick, Switzerland-based Research Institute of
Organic Agriculture.  “The figures indicate a consolidation of the production
areas and a continuous and stable growth in the markets,” the
federation said. “A further expansion of the organically
managed area, certified and non-certified, is however
desirable.”  The U.S. was the biggest organic market in 2010, with sales
climbing about $2 billion to $26.7 billion, followed by  Germany ,
where sales rose about 200 million euros to 6.02 billion euros
($7.9 billion),  data  published by the institute showed.  France 
ranked third as sales increased about 340 million euros to 3.39
billion euros.  Per-capita consumption of organic products was highest in
Switzerland, Denmark and Luxembourg, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
