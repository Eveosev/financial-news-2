France  and Spain sold 14.2 billion
euros ($18.5 billion) in bonds, defying a ratings cut for some
European nations by Moody’s Investors Service and concern about
a second bailout for Greece.  Both countries had more demand for their debt than they
offered. France sold 8.45 billion in two- three- and five-year
bonds and 1.71 billion euros of index-linked debt. Spain issued
4.07 billion euros in securities maturing in 2015 and October
2019. The yield on France’s benchmark two-year notes fell, while
Spanish borrowing costs rose.  The  European Central Bank ’s three-year lending program for
banks, dubbed LTRO, helped demand for the auctions, which come
three days after Moody’s cut the ratings of six European nations
including  Spain  and revised its credit outlook on France to
“negative.” European finance ministers postponed until at
least Feb. 20 a decision slated for yesterday on Greek aid
totaling 130 billion euros.  “Real-money investors are buying risk,” said  Padhraic Garvey , head of developed-market debt at ING Groep NV in
Amsterdam.  Yields on French benchmark 10-year bonds were unchanged at
2.99 percent. They have fallen about 14 basis points since the
start of this year even after Standard & Poor’s cut France’s AAA
rating by one level on Jan. 13. Spain’s 10-year bond yield rose
two basis points after the auction to 5.548 percent. The yield
difference over German bunds of the same maturity widened
further after the auction to 364 basis points.  ‘High’ Demand  France sold 2.09 billion euros in notes maturing in July
2014. Demand was 2.3 times the amount sold, with the yield
falling to 0.89 percent from 1.05 percent at the previous
auction. France also sold 1.34 billion euros in notes maturing
in 2015 and 5.03 billion euros in notes maturing in 2017.  Spain sold 2.27 billion euros of benchmark bonds maturing
in July 2015 to yield 3.332 percent, up from 2.861 percent when
the security was last auctioned on Feb. 2. Demand for the bond
was 2.19 times the amount sold, the Treasury said, compared with
1.63 times on Feb. 2.  Spain also sold a bond maturing in January 2015 to yield
2.966 percent and a 2019 bond was priced to yield 4.832 percent,
the Bank of Spain said. Demand for the January 2015 bond was
4.37 times the amount sold and was 3.27 times for the 2019 bond.  Spanish Economy Minister Luis de Guindos said today that the
“high” demand at the Spanish bond auction reflected investors’
confidence in the economy.  ECB Loans  “Despite the difficult environment, the Spanish Treasury
managed to sell the maximum amount of bonds with high demand,
which is an important sign of confidence in the Spanish economy
and the measures being adopted,” he told Parliament in  Madrid .  In a bid to address the region’s banks’ funding woes, the
Frankfurt-based ECB loaned euro-region banks a record 489
billion euros for three years on Dec. 21, adding to the market’s
liquidity. The central bank is slated to make another such offer
to banks on Feb. 28.  “The market is still seeing support ahead of the next
three-year LTRO,” said  Harvinder Sian , an interest-rate
strategist at Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc in  London .  France has trimmed its 2012 debt sales plan as President
 Nicolas Sarkozy , who faces an election in less than three
months, seeks to cut the country’s budget deficit. France will
require 177.9 billion euros in financing this year, down from
the 182 billion euros estimated on Sept. 28, Agence France
Tresor, the country’s debt-management body, said in December.  ‘Progressive Deterioration’  The LTRO-led demand for the nation’s bonds explains why
yields haven’t risen even as the country missed last year’s
budget deficit target, Sian said. Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy 
has to cut the nation’s shortfall by about 45 percent this year
while fighting a second recession in two years.  Still, the ECB can’t sustain demand for European bond
issues indefinitely, some analysts noted.  “The reaction of markets at this stage has been an
artificial one, because we had liquidity effects helped by a
number of decisions, notably by the ECB that can’t be eternally
repeated,” Philippe Dessertine, a professor of finance at the
University of Paris West Nanterre, said on TF1 television.  There’s a risk we’ll see a “progressive deterioration of
demand for French public debt that will be felt bit by bit,” he
said on the Paris-based TV channel on Feb. 14.  Separately, Luxembourg Prime Minister Jean-Claude Juncker
yesterday said Europe is set to make “all the necessary
decisions” at a summit in Brussels on Feb. 20 intended to pave
the way for the endorsement of a 130 billion-euro aid package to
 Greece . The decision, initially expected last week, was
postponed as European leaders struggled to extract concessions
from  Athens .  To contact the reporters on this story:
