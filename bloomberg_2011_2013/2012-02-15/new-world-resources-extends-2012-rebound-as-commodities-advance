New World Resources Plc (NWR) , the biggest
Czech producer of coking coal, increased as China pledged to
invest in  Europe ’s bailout funds, boosting investor demand for
stocks and commodities.  The stock climbed as much as 2.9 percent before paring the
advance to 1.9 percent at 154 koruna by 11 a.m. in Prague. NWR
has rallied 13 percent so far this year, rebounding from a 50
percent slump in 2011.  Europe’s benchmark coal derivatives snapped a five-day
decline, rising 0.3 percent to $113.25 a metric ton in the
Netherlands.  To contact the reporter on this story:
