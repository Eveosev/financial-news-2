OZ Minerals Ltd. (OZL) , the third-biggest
Australian copper producer by market value, reported profit fell
53 percent last year as earnings the previous year were boosted
by a one-time item.  Net income was A$274.5 million in the year ended Dec. 31,
from A$586.9 million a year earlier, Melbourne-based OZ Minerals
said today in a statement. That compares with the A$268 million
 average  of 15 analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. OZ
Minerals will pay a final dividend of 30 cents a share, bringing
its total 2011 payout to 60 cents.  Chief Executive Officer Terry Burgess expects copper and
gold prices to remain “strong” this year even as costs rise
amid gains in the Australian dollar. He kept his forecast for
2012 copper production at 100,000 metric tons to 110,000 tons
and gold output between 130,000 ounces and 150,000 ounces.  “2012 is going to be a very good year for us and copper
continues to be very buoyant,” Burgess said today in an
interview with Rishaad Salamat on Bloomberg TV’s “On the Move
Asia” program. “We’ve got the right mix of commodity with
copper and gold.”  The company’s cash balance of A$886 million enables it to
“actively” look for opportunities that will add value, he
said. OZ Minerals, which isn’t in talks at the moment, will
focus on buying assets that are already in production or could
be brought into production in two to three years time, said
Burgess.  ‘Looking for Value’  “We’re looking for value and it’s not that easy to find,”
he said. “It’s a quest that we will continue to do.”  The shares fell 1.3 percent to A$11.34 at the close of
trading in Sydney. The stock, which has 10 “buy” eight
“hold” and three “sell,” has advanced 13 percent this year.  Profit was cut by a A$42.2 million litigation settlement
and a A$15.2 million writedown on its investment in Toro Energy
Ltd., it said today. Net income in 2010 was boosted by a A$141.1
million reversal of a one-time charge. Underlying earnings
before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization were to
A$585.6 million, little changed from last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
