Saudi Oger Ltd., a construction and
telecommunications company, has received bids for its Oger
Telecom Ltd. unit, the majority owner of  Turk Telekomunikasyon
AS (TTKOM) ,  Milliyet  reported, citing Vice Chairman Mohammed Hariri.  Prices offered by potential buyers, all from the Gulf
region, weren’t satisfactory and Saudi Oger thinks it’s not the
right time to sell the unit, the Istanbul-based newspaper cited
Hariri as saying.  Dubai-based Oger Telecom, which invests in
telecommunications companies, owns 55 percent of Turk Telekom,
Turkey’s biggest phone company.  Saudi Telecom Co. (STC)  bought 35
percent of Oger Telecom for $2.6 billion in 2008. Saudi Oger
owns 44 percent of Oger Telecom.  To contact the reporter on this story:
