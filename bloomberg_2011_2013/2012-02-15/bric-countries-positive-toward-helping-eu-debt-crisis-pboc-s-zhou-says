BRIC countries are all very positive
toward helping resolve  Europe ’s debt crisis, People’s Bank of
 China  Governor Zhou Xiaochuan said in Beijing.  Still, they have to wait for the right time and right
opportunity to help, he said.  China can use three avenues to help - the central bank,
China Investment Corp., the nation’s sovereign wealth fund, and
banks including the  China Development Bank , Export-Import Bank
and other institutions, he said.  He reiterated comments previously made by Premier  Wen
Jiabao  that China hopes for more “innovation” from Europe to
provide more lucrative products that are “truly appealing” to
investors.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
