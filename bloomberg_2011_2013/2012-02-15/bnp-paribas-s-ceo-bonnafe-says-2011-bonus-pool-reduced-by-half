BNP Paribas SA (BNP) ,  France ’s largest
bank, joined  Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN)  and  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  in
cutting 2011 bonuses after quarterly profit plunged at its
corporate- and investment-banking unit.  “Bonuses are going to be down by half in 2011,” BNP
Paribas Chief Executive Officer Jean-Laurent Bonnafe said in an
interview with Bloomberg Television today. “In any case, those
remunerations are always in line with the financial results.”
He didn’t provide further details on the bonus pool’s size.  The world’s largest banks, including Frankfurt-based
Deutsche Bank and JPMorgan Chase & Co., are curbing pay as they
face shrinking revenue and tighter capital requirements. Credit
Suisse, based in Zurich, said Feb. 9 it cut the 2011 bonus pool
by 41 percent after the securities unit posted a second
consecutive quarterly loss.  UBS AG (UBSN) , Switzerland’s largest bank,
said last week it reduced its 2011 bonuses by 40 percent to 2.57
billion francs ($2.8 billion) after its investment bank also
reported a second straight quarterly deficit.  BNP Paribas’s fourth-quarter pretax profit at the
corporate- and investment-banking division slumped to 6 million
euros from 1.09 billion euros a year earlier. Sales at the unit
fell 40 percent to 1.65 billion euros as fixed-income revenue
slid 68 percent, hurt by losses from selling sovereign bonds.  BNP Paribas said Nov. 16 it plans to cut about 1,400 jobs
at the division, or 6.5 percent of the unit’s staff worldwide.
The Paris-based lender booked 184 million euros in one-time
costs in the fourth quarter after starting the job-reduction
plan.  Deutsche Bank,  Germany ’s largest bank, cut its bonus pool
by 17 percent as it lowered the cash component by 37 percent,
CEO  Josef Ackermann  said Feb. 2.  To contact the reporters on this story:
