Cyprus’s revenue from tourism rose
13 percent in 2011 compared to a year earlier beating an earlier
 finance ministry  forecast, the  Statistical Service  said.  Total revenue rose to 1.7 billion euros ($2.3 billion) last
year from 1.5 billion euros in 2010, the east Mediterranean
island’s statistical office said in a  statement  on its website
today. In December, revenue gained 1.9 percent to 41.6 million
euros.  The finance ministry said in April that it expected
receipts from tourism, which makes up 18 percent of the euro
area’s third-smallest economy and one in five jobs, would
increase by 4 percent in 2011. Last year, arrivals rose 10
percent to 2.39 million. The number of Russian visitors
increased 49 percent to 334,079.  To contact the reporter on this story:
