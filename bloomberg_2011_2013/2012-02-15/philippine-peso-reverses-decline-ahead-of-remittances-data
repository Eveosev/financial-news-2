The Philippine peso strengthened as
remittances exceeded the central bank’s growth forecast for 2011.
 Government bonds  gained.  Money sent home by Filipinos living abroad rose 7.2 percent
in 2011, the monetary authority reported today, surpassing its 7
percent growth projection. The transfers account for about 10
percent of the Philippine economy.  “Remittances remain supportive of the currency,” said
 Jonathan Ravelas , chief market strategist at BDO Unibank Inc. in
 Manila . “It’s still strong at 7.2 percent growth, better than
the government’s target.” He forecast growth this year will
also be about 7 percent.  The peso advanced 0.2 percent to close at 42.643 per dollar
in Manila, contributing to a 2.8 percent advance for this year,
according to Tullett Prebon Plc.  An increase of between 5 percent and 7 percent in the
 Philippines ’ gross domestic product is possible in the first
quarter, Economic Planning Secretary Cayetano Paderanga said
last week. That compares with a gain of 3.7 percent in the final
three months of 2011 and 4.6 percent growth in the year-earlier
period.  The yield on the government’s 6.375 percent bonds due
January 2022 fell three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point,
to 5.11 percent, according to a noon fixing from the Philippine
Dealing & Exchange Corp.  To contact the reporter on this story:
