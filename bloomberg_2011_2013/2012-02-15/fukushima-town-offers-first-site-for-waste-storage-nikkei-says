A town near  Japan ’s crippled
Fukushima nuclear station offered to build a site to store
contaminated soil, the first municipality near the plant to
accept radioactive waste from the atomic disaster, the Nikkei
newspaper reported.  The town of Naraha in Fukushima prefecture north of Tokyo
proposed building a temporary site on the condition another one
is built in the district its located in, the Nikkei said, citing
unidentified people familiar with the situation.  Japan’s government wants to build a decontamination site
near  Tokyo Electric Power Co. (9501) ’s Fukushima Dai-Ichi nuclear
station by the end of March next year, the Nikkei said.
Residents of towns and villages in the area are resisting
attempts to choose a site, it said.  The March 11 earthquake and tsunami knocked out power and
cooling at the Fukushima station, forcing 160,000 people to
evacuate and spreading radiation over parts of northern Japan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
