Most  U.K. stocks  rose as China said
it will help resolve  Europe ’s debt crisis and the leaders of
Greece’s two biggest political parties gave written commitments
to austerity measures to obtain further financial aid.  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) , Europe’s biggest lender, and  Barclays
Plc (BARC)  led bank shares higher. Morgan Crucible Plc rallied 8.3
percent after posting full-year profit that topped estimates.  The  FTSE 100  Index slipped 7.71, or 0.1 percent, to
5,892.16 at the close in London as three stocks climbed for
every two that dropped. The measure has rallied  19 percent  from
last year’s lowest level as the  European Central Bank  increased
lending to banks and U.S. economic reports exceeded estimates.
The FTSE All-Share Index also decreased 0.1 percent today, while
Ireland’s ISEQ Index rose 1.2 percent.  “Markets have taken heart from comments from China early
this morning that they will help resolve the euro crisis,” said
Louise Cooper, a markets analyst at BGC Partners in  London .  Gains on the FTSE 100 were limited today as AstraZeneca
Plc, GlaxoSmithKline Plc and BP Plc shares all traded without
the right to the latest dividend.  China said it will get more involved in the EU’s bailout
funds and maintain its holdings of euro assets.  China Support  “China will always adhere to the principle of holding
assets of EU sovereign debt,” People’s Bank of China Governor
Zhou Xiaochuan said in a speech in Beijing today. “We would
participate in resolving the euro-debt crisis,” he said,
echoing comments by Premier  Wen Jiabao  yesterday.  Euro-area finance ministers canceled a Brussels meeting
scheduled for today and will hold a teleconference instead to
prod  Greece  to do more to obtain 130 billion euros ($170
billion) of aid along with about 100 billion euros of debt
relief from private bondholders. Greece needs the aid to make a
14.5 billion-euro bond payment on March 20.  The FTSE 100 erased a gain of 0.4 percent as Reuters
reported that the euro area’s finance ministers may delay the
bailout package until after Greece holds elections in April,
citing European Union sources.  Antonis Samaras, the leader of Greece’s second-biggest
political party, said he and his party  New Democracy  were
committed to the implementation of terms and conditions for a
second financing package for the country.  Stocks climbed even as  U.K. jobless claims  rose in January
more than economists had forecast and unemployment held at the
highest rate for 16 years in the fourth quarter as the economy
contracted.  Unemployment Claims Increase  The number of people claiming jobless benefits rose by
6,900 to 1.6 million, the most since January 2010, the  Office
for National Statistics  said today. The median of 24 forecasts
in a Bloomberg Survey called for a gain of 3,000.  U.K.
unemployment (UKUEILOR)  measured by International Labour Organization
methods rose by 48,000 to 2.67 million in the fourth quarter,
leaving the rate at 8.4 percent, the most since 1996.  HSBC gained 2.6 percent to 575.9 pence and Barclays climbed
2.9 percent to 241.65 pence. The FTSE 350 Banks Index advanced
2.2 percent for its biggest rally since Feb. 3.  Morgan Crucible surged 8.3 percent to 354 pence after
reporting net income of 73 million pounds ($115 million). That
beat the average analyst estimate for profit of 70 million
pounds.  Sports Direct International soared 5.8 percent to 278 pence
as the sportswear retailer said it is “certain” of achieving
its forecast for full-year earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization.  To contact the reporter on this story:
