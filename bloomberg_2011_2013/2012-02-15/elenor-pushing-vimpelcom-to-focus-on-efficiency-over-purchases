Telenor ASA (TEL) , the biggest shareholder
in  VimpelCom Ltd. (VIP) , wants the mobile-phone provider to shun
acquisitions in favor of boosting operational efficiency and
improving its presence in  emerging markets .  Telenor, the Nordic region’s largest phone company, bought
234 million preferred shares of VimpelCom from Weather
Investments II S.a.r.l. for $374.4 million, increasing its
voting stake in the company to about 36 percent, according to a
statement issued today.  “VimpelCom’s strategy of acquisitions will now be changed
to improving operational efficiency,”  Dag Melgaard , spokesman
for Telenor, said by phone from Oslo today. “VimpelCom should
grow in emerging markets. We want to make the company a
success.”  Amsterdam-based VimpelCom doubled its mobile-customer base
to about 181 million in 20 countries with the purchase of assets
from Egyptian billionaire  Naguib Sawiris  in 2010, a deal valued
at around $6.5 billion at the time. Telenor objected to the
acquisitions and began arbitration against fellow shareholders,
a dispute it agreed to end today. The merger with Sawiris’ Wind
Telecom SpA gave Telenor, which held more than 30 percent of
VimpelCom at the time, the right to 25 percent of the combined
company.  Telenor is yet to decide whether to convert their preferred
VimpelCom shares into ordinary stock, Melgaard said.  “At the moment, voting rights in VimpelCom are our
priority and not the dividends,” he said, adding that Telenor
is seeking to boost Vimpecom’s board to 11 members from the
current nine.  More Shares  Telenor may decide “at any time” whether to buy another
71 million of preferred shares in VimpelCom, a move that would
boost their voting stake to 39.8 percent, Melgaard said. Such a
move would give Telenor and minority shareholders control of
more than 50 percent of VimpelCom, said Luis Saenz, chief
executive officer of the U.S. unit of Moscow-based brokerage
Otkritie Financial Corp.  An extraordinary VimpelCom shareholders meeting may be
called within the next two months, Telenor’s Melgaard said.  Calls to the office phone of VimpelCom spokeswoman Elena Prokhorova in Moscow after business hours weren’t answered.
VimpelCom is also  Russia ’s second-largest mobile phone operator.  To contact the reporter on this story:
