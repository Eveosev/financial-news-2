Home values in  Southern California 
declined last month to close to the market bottom as lenders
agreed to a record share of short sales, or transactions in
which the price is less than the amount owed,  DataQuick  said.  The median paid for houses and condominiums was $260,000 in
 Los Angeles , Riverside,  San Diego , Ventura, San Bernardino and
Orange counties, down 3.7 percent from $270,000 in December and
January 2011, and the lowest since May 2009, the San Diego-based
data firm said today in a statement. Values were pulled down by
a lack of mortgage credit and distressed deals that made up more
than half of all purchases, the company said.  “What we can determine is that the mortgage market remains
dysfunctional,”  John Walsh , DataQuick president, said in the
statement. “It will be interesting to see how a potential surge
of refinance activity plays into the purchase market once the
administration’s new guidelines are implemented.”  President Barack Obama said Feb. 1 that he’ll ask Congress
for legislation that will help more homeowners refinance into
lower-rate loans, even if they owe more than their properties
are worth.  Sales in Southern California totaled 14,523 in January,
down almost 25 percent from the previous month and up 0.4
percent from a year earlier. A “sharp” decline in purchases
from December is normal, DataQuick said. Foreclosures accounted
for 33 percent of deals, while short sales were an estimated 21
percent, the most in DataQuick records dating to 1988.  To contact the reporter on this story:
