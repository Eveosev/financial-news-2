Harvard University  is challenging
students to develop entrepreneurial solutions to problems like
global warming and poverty through a $100,000 competition
announced today by President Drew Faust.  Students will form teams and tackle one of five issues that
will be outlined later this month. The program is designed to
foster energy from business-minded students and “focus it on
problems that matter,” the Cambridge, Massachusetts-based
university said in a  statement .  The challenge, part of the school’s  innovation lab , has a
March 19 deadline for proposals. One winner and as many as three
runners-up will share the $100,000 grand prize, according to the
statement. The winner will be given space, mentoring and
resources in the i-lab.  “For generations, Harvard students and faculty have risen
to the challenges posed by seemingly intractable problems,”
Harvard Provost Alan M. Garber said in the statement.  Over the course of the competition, $50,000 will be
distributed to 10 finalists to develop their proposals,
according to Harvard’s  website . The contest is open to both
undergraduate and graduate students. Final project submissions
are due in May.  To contact the reporter on this story:
