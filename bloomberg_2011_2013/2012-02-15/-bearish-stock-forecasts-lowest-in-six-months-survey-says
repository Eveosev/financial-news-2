The following are results from
 Investors Intelligence’s  analysis of investment newsletters for
Feb. 8 through yesterday. The New Rochelle, New York-based firm
determines the proportion of writers who are bullish and bearish
on  U.S. stocks , as well as the percentage who anticipate a
correction, or 10 percent decline, in the market.  Technical analysts, who try to predict stock moves based on
price and trading patterns, track investor sentiment as a
contrarian indicator. They interpret greater optimism as bearish
and increased pessimism as bullish.  To contact the reporter on this story:
