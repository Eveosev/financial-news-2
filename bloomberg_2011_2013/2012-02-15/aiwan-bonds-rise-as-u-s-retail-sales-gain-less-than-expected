Taiwan’s bonds rallied as worse-
than-expected U.S. retail sales figures prompted investors to
favor the safest assets. The local dollar was steady.  Benchmark 10-year yields dropped to the lowest level in
almost two months after new notes of that maturity started
trading yesterday. Sales at U.S. retailers increased 0.4 percent
in January from a year earlier, less than the 0.8 percent gain
forecast by economists in a Bloomberg survey.  “Yields have gone lower on the bad U.S. retail sales
figure,” said  James Wang , a fixed-income trader at Yuanta
Securities Co. in Taipei. “Yields on the new 10-year bonds have
dropped quite a lot as new issuances usually have better
liquidity, hence higher demand.”  The yield on the government’s 1.25 percent notes due March
2022 fell one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 1.258
percent as of 9:51 a.m. in Taipei, prices from Gretai Securities
Market show. That’s the lowest level for  benchmark 10-year notes 
since Dec. 19.  The  Taiwan dollar  was little changed at NT$29.587 against
its U.S. counterpart, according to Taipei Forex Inc. It touched
NT$29.370 on Feb. 10, the strongest level since Sept. 13.  The  overnight money-market rate , which measures interbank
funding availability, fell one basis point to 0.392 percent,
according to a weighted average compiled by the Taiwan Interbank
Money Center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
