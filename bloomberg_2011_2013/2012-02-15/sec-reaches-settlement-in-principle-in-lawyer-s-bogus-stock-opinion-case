The U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission said a framework for a settlement has been made with
a  New York  lawyer who was accused of writing bogus letters for
stock promoters.  U.S. District Judge Kevin Castel in Manhattan said that
because of the SEC’s “settlement in principle” with Stephen
Czarnik, a trial set for March has been postponed, according to
a court filing today.  The SEC sued Czarnik in 2010, alleging that the opinion
letters he wrote for the stock promoters made it seem as if
share offerings were exempt from registration requirements. The
agency said Czarnik knew or should have known that the promoters
intended to distribute the stock to the public.  Approval by the SEC of the settlement may be completed
within three months, Jonathan Polish, a lawyer for the agency,
said in a letter to the judge dated yesterday.  The case is U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission v.
Czarnik, 10-cv-00745, U.S. District Court, Southern District of
New York ( Manhattan ).  To contact the reporter on this story:
