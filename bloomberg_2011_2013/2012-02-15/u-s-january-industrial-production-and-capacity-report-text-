Following is the text of the U.S.
 Industrial Production  and Capacity Utilization report for
January:  Industrial production was unchanged in January, as a gain
of 0.7 percent in manufacturing was offset by declines in mining
and utilities. Within manufacturing, the index for motor
vehicles and parts jumped 6.8 percent and the index for other
manufacturing industries increased 0.3 percent.  The output of
utilities fell 2.5 percent, as demand for heating was held down
by temperatures that moved further above seasonal norms; the
output of mines declined 1.8 percent.  Total industrial
production is now reported to have advanced 1.0 percent in
December; the initial estimate had been an increase of 0.4
percent.  This large upward revision reflected higher output for
many manufacturing and mining industries.  At 95.9 percent of
its 2007 average, total industrial production in January was 3.4
percent above its level of a year earlier.  The capacity
utilization rate for total industry decreased to 78.5 percent, a
rate 1.8 percentage points below its long-run (1972-2011)
average.  Market Groups  The production of  consumer goods  edged down 0.1 percent in
January.  The index for  consumer durables  increased 3.8 percent,
but the index for consumer nondurables declined 1.2 percent.
Among durables, the production of automotive products climbed
5.8 percent, and gains were also recorded for home electronics;
appliances, furniture, and carpeting; and miscellaneous goods.
Among consumer nondurables, the output of non-energy goods
decreased 0.1 percent, as a decline in foods and tobacco offset
gains in clothing, chemical products, and paper products.  The
output of consumer energy products fell 4.0 percent, with
substantial decreases for both residential utilities and fuels.  The production of business equipment moved up 1.8 percent
in January with appreciable increases in all of its major
component indexes:  Transit equipment advanced 2.5 percent,
information processing equipment increased 1.8 percent, and
industrial and other equipment gained 1.5 percent.  The output
of business equipment has risen in each of the past 9 months and
in January stood nearly 11 percent above its level 12 months
earlier.  The production of defense and space equipment increased 0.8
percent in January following a decline of 0.6 percent in
December.  Among nonindustrial supplies, the output of construction
supplies fell 0.4 percent in January following a gain of 3.0
percent in December.  In January, the output of construction
supplies was 5.3 percent above its level of a year earlier but
remained well below its pre-recession peak.  The production of
business supplies increased 0.5 percent in January.  The production of materials moved down 0.4 percent in
January after having risen 1.0 percent in December. A decrease
of 1.7 percent for energy materials, which primarily reflected
lower output by utilities and reductions in oil and natural gas
extraction, more than accounted for the decline in overall
materials. The index for durable materials advanced 0.8 percent
because of increases in the production of consumer parts and
equipment parts; the index for other durable materials decreased
0.3 percent. The production of nondurable materials edged up 0.1
percent; the output of both textile and paper materials
increased, while the production of chemical materials declined.  Industry Groups  Manufacturing output rose 0.7 percent in January after
having increased 1.5 percent in December; the level of output in
January was 4.5 percent above its year-earlier level. Capacity
utilization for manufacturing moved up 0.5 percentage point to
77.0 percent, a rate 1.9 percentage points below its long-run
average.  The production of durable goods advanced 1.8 percent in
January.  The output of motor vehicles and parts surged 6.8
percent following an upwardly revised increase of 3.8 percent in
December.  In January, gains of more than 1.0 percent were
recorded for fabricated metal products; machinery; computer and
electronic products; electrical equipment, appliances, and
components; furniture and related products; and miscellaneous
manufacturing.  The output of aerospace and miscellaneous
transportation equipment edged up 0.1 percent, while production
decreased for wood products, nonmetallic mineral products, and
primary metals.  Nondurable manufacturing declined 0.2 percent in January
after having advanced 1.5 percent in December. The decrease in
production in January reflected drops in output for food,
beverage, and tobacco products and for petroleum and coal
products.  The production indexes for apparel and leather
products and for printing and support moved up more than 1
percent, while the indexes for textile and product mills, for
paper, for chemicals, and for plastics and rubber products
recorded smaller increases. The output of non-NAICS
manufacturing industries (publishing and logging) decreased 0.1
percent.  In January, mining output fell 1.8 percent, its first
decline since February 2011; capacity utilization decreased to
91.5 percent, a rate 4.1 percentage points above its long-run
average.  The output of utilities declined 2.5 percent after
having fallen a similar amount in December.  The operating rate
for utilities dropped to 74.6 percent in January.  Capacity utilization rates in January at industries grouped
by stage of process were as follows:  At  the crude stage,
utilization fell 1.0 percentage point to 89.9 percent, a rate
3.5 percentage points above  its long-run average; at the
primary and semifinished stages, utilization decreased 0.4
percentage point to  74.9 percent, a rate 6.2 percentage points
below its long-run average; and at the finished stage,
utilization increased 0.8 percentage point to 78.1 percent, a
rate 0.8 percentage point above its long-run  average.  Note:  Preliminary Estimates of Industrial Capacity  The data in this release include preliminary estimates of
industrial capacity for 2012.  Measured fourth quarter to fourth
quarter, total industrial capacity is projected to rise 1.0
percent this year after having increased 1.1 percent in 2011.
Manufacturing capacity is estimated to advance 0.9 percent in
2012 after having gained 0.8 percent in 2011. Mining capacity is
estimated to rise 1.1 percent in 2012 after having moved up 2.1
percent in 2011, and capacity at electric and natural gas
utilities is projected to expand 2.4 percent this year, which is
0.4 percentage point faster than the increase recorded last year.
These estimates will be updated with the publication on March 30,
2012, of the annual revision to industrial production, capacity,
and capacity utilization.  Notice
Revision of Industrial Production and Capacity Utilization  The Federal Reserve Board plans to issue its annual
revision to the index of industrial production (IP) and the
related measures of capacity utilization on March 30, 2012.  The
revised IP indexes will incorporate detailed data from the 2010
Annual Survey of Manufactures, conducted by the U.S. Census
Bureau. Annual data from the  U.S. Geological Survey  regarding
metallic and nonmetallic minerals (except fuels) for 2010 will
also be incorporated.  The update will include revisions to the
monthly indicator (either product data or input data) and to
seasonal factors for each industry.  In addition, the estimation
methods for some series may be changed.  Any modifications to
the methods for estimating the output of an industry will affect
the index from 1972 to the present.  Capacity and capacity utilization will be revised to
incorporate data through the fourth quarter of 2011 from the
Census Bureau’s Quarterly Survey of Plant Capacity, which covers
manufacturing, along with new data on capacity from the U.S.
Geological Survey, the  Department of Energy , and other
organizations.  Once the revision is published, it will be available on the
Board’s website at www.federalreserve.gov/releases/G17. Further
information on the revision can be obtained from the Board’s
Industrial Output Section (telephone number 202-452-3197).  References and Release Dates  References  The release for the annual revision that was published on
March 25, 2011 is available on the Board’s website (www.federal
reserve.gov/releases/g17/revisions/Current/DefaultRev.htm). A
summary of the annual revision that incorporated back to 1972
production and capacity indexes reclassified according to the
North American  Industry Classification System is available in
an article in the  Federal Reserve Bulletin, vol. 89 (April
2003), pp. 151-176.  A description of the aggregation methods
for industrial production and capacity utilization is included
