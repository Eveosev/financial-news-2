Vietnam ’s five-year bonds gained,
pushing their yield to the lowest level since April, on
speculation  interest rates  will be cut. The dong weakened.  The  State Bank  of Vietnam instructed lenders to “reduce
interest rates to levels that are suitable to the macroeconomic
situation,” according to a statement posted Feb. 13 on its
website. Inflation cooled for a fifth month in January, with
consumer prices climbing 17.3 percent from a year earlier, the
least in 10 months, official data show.  “The government keeps reiterating its determination to
bring down interest rates and slowing inflation has boosted
investors’ expectations for a cut,” analysts including Do Thi
Phuong Trang at Bank for Investment and Development of Vietnam
wrote in a note today. Demand for two- and five-year bonds has
strengthened, they wrote.  The  yields  on five-year notes fell one basis point, or 0.01
percentage point, to 12.29 percent as of 4:18 p.m. in Hanoi,
according to a daily fixing from banks compiled by Bloomberg.
The two-year yield declined one basis point to 12.41 percent.  The dong fell 0.3 percent to 20,909 per dollar, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. The central bank set the
 reference rate  at 20,828, its website showed. The currency is
allowed to trade as much as 1 percent on either side of the
official rate.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
