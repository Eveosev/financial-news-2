Alastair Cook became the first
 England  cricket captain to score back-to-back one-day
international centuries as his team beat Pakistan by 20 runs to
take an unbeatable 2-0 series lead.  Cook, who was dropped when on 28, anchored England’s 250-4
with 102 from 121 balls after winning the toss in Abu Dhabi
yesterday.  Steven Finn  then took four wickets as Pakistan was
bowled out for 230 with one over remaining.  The victory means England cannot lose the best-of-four
contest after suffering a 3-0 sweep of defeats against Pakistan
in the elite Test format. The remaining two games will be played
Feb. 18 and 21 in Dubai.  “It was a really good team performance and hopefully we
can finish the job in Dubai,” Cook, who scored a limited-overs-
best 137 as England won the series opener by 130 runs three days
ago, said at the presentation ceremony.  Left-hander Cook struck 10 fours in his innings yesterday.
He shared an opening stand of 67 with  Kevin Pietersen , added 49
with No. 3  Jonathan Trott  and had a 78-run partnership with  Ravi Bopara , who scored 58 for his second straight half-century.  Imran Farhat and Misbah-ul-Haq both hit 47 for Pakistan,
while Finn matched his best one-day international haul of 4-34,
which he also returned in the opening match.  Following the one-day series, the teams will play three
Twenty20 matches.  To contact the reporter on this story:
