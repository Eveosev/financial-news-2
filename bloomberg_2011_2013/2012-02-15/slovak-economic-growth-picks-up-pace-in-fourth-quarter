The Slovak economy  grew  a faster-
than-expected 3.4 percent in the fourth quarter from a year
earlier, after a 3 percent growth in the previous three-month
period, the Slovak Statistical Office said in a preliminary
report.  The result compares with a median estimate of five
economists for a 2.1 percent expansion. On a quarterly basis,
the economy grew a seasonally adjusted 0.9 percent, the
Bratislava, Slovakia-based office said on its website today. The
office, which didn’t provide breakdown of growth, will release
the final fourth-quarter GDP report on March 6.  The economy of the east European country is slowing as the
lingering debt crisis in the euro region reduces demand for
exports, the key driver of Slovakia’s growth. The  Finance
Ministry  expects growth to slow further to 1.1 percent this
year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
