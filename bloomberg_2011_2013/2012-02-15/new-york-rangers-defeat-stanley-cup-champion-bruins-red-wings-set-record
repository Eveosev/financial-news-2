The  New York Rangers  defeated the
 Boston Bruins  for the second time this season to record their
fourth straight win.  Also last night, the  Detroit Red Wings  beat the  Dallas
Stars  3-1 to eclipse an 82-year-old record for the most
consecutive home wins in the National Hockey League.  The Rangers won 3-0, taking the lead at TD Garden in Boston
when Ryan Callahan scored on a power play midway through the
first period. Ryan McDonagh added an unassisted goal 12 seconds
before the end of the period, and Artem Anisimov completed the
scoring two minutes, 53 seconds into the third period.  The Bruins beat the Vancouver Canucks 4-0 in the decisive
seventh game of the Stanley Cup Finals in June to earn their
first NHL title since 1972. The Rangers last won the title in
1994, ending a 54-year wait for a fourth championship.  The Rangers (37-13-5) lead the Eastern Conference with 79
points, nine more than the second-place Bruins (34-18-2).  Henrik Lundqvist had 42 saves for  New York , which also beat
the Bruins 3-2 in overtime on Jan. 21.  At Joe Louis Arena in Detroit, Henrik Zetterberg, Brad Stuart and Jiri Hudler scored for the Red Wings as they won
their 21st straight home game.  The Bruins won 20 straight at home from Dec. 3, 1929, to
March 18, 1930, and the Philadelphia Flyers matched the feat in
1976.  To contact the reporter on this story:
