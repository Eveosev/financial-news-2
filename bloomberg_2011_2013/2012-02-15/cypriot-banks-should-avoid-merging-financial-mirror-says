Cypriot banks, which are unlikely to
pay any dividends over the next two years, should avoid merging
to strengthen their finances, the  Financial Mirror  reported,
citing Cypriot Archbishop Chrysostomos.  In the event of a hostile takeover bid for either Bank of
Cyprus, the east Mediterranean island’s largest lender, or
Hellenic Bank, the country’s third largest lender, a merger may
be considered, the Nicosia-based newspaper said, citing the head
of the diocese.  The Greek Orthodox  Church of Cyprus  owns a 3.8 percent
interest in Bank of Cyprus and a 25 percent stake in Hellenic
Bank, Financial Mirror said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
