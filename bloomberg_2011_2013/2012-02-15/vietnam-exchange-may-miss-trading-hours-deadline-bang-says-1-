Vietnam  may miss a planned Feb. 20
deadline to begin extended trading hours on the Ho Chi Minh City
Stock Exchange as it’s still waiting for ministerial approval,
State Securities Commission Chairman Vu Bang said today.  “We may have to delay it for one or a few weeks as we are
still waiting for final approval,” Bang said. “Once we get it,
we will implement the plan as an experimental program for a few
months to see if it’s effective.”  Southeast Asia ’s second-smallest exchange by market
capitalization after Laos wants to add an afternoon session from
1 p.m. to 2:30 p.m. to the existing 8:30 a.m. to 11 a.m. trading
day, Nguyen Duy Phong, an analyst from ACB Securities, said on
Aug. 11, citing a document sent to the company by the bourse.  Bang said all technical issues related to the extension had
been addressed and the only concern is that “liquidity in the
market is low” and the extension may not increase trading
volumes as much as expected.  The benchmark  VN Index (VNINDEX)  slumped 27 percent last year, the
most among Asian benchmark gauges, as the government raised
interest rates to cool inflation. The measure has rallied 13
percent this year, closing 0.7 percent lower today at 397.41.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
