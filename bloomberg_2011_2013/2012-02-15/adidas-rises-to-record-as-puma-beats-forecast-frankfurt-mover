Adidas AG, (ADS)  the world’s second-
largest sporting-goods maker, rose to the highest price on
record in Frankfurt trading after competitor  Puma AG (PUM)  said it
exceeded its annual sales forecast.  Adidas gained as much as 3.8 percent to 59.96 euros and
traded up 2.6 percent as of 11 a.m., extending the stock’s
 advance this year  to 18 percent. Puma climbed as much as 3.6
percent to 248.45 euros, taking its gain in 2012 to 10 percent.  Puma’s net income rose 14 percent in 2011 to 230.1 million
euros ($302.8 million), the Herzogenaurach, Germany-based
company said today, beating analysts’ estimates and its own
target of “mid single-digit growth.” Sales will rise by a
“high single-digit” percentage in 2012 and 2013, and net
income will grow at a “mid single-digit” pace each of those
years, assuming moderate input cost inflation, it said.  Adidas, also based in Herzogenaurach, is scheduled to
report 2011 earnings on March 7. Chief Executive Officer Herbert Hainer said in November that  Europe ’s debt crisis won’t halt the
company’s growth and forecast higher earnings this year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
