Petronet LNG Ltd. (PLNG) ,  India ’s biggest
importer of liquefied natural gas, is in talks with suppliers in
the U.S., including Cheniere Energy Partners LP, which has sold
almost 90 percent of the annual export capacity it’s developing.  “Cheniere still has some capacity left,” A.K. Balyan,
Petronet’s managing director, said in an interview in New Delhi
today.  Cheniere has sold 16 million of the 18 million metric tons
it proposes to export to BG Group Plc, GAIL India Ltd., Gas
Natural SDG SA and Korea Gas Corp., Cheniere said in January.
Petronet is expanding capacity and seeks new long-term supplies
for its terminals on India’s west coast, Balyan said.  Spot cargo prices may ease this year as supplies increase,
declining below $15 per million British thermal units, Balyan
said.  Japan , the world’s biggest LNG buyer,  paid  $798 a ton,
equivalent to $15.35 per million Btu, last year, according to
data on the website of the Tokyo-based ministry.  “Prices should fall because there’s more capacity in the
market and companies are holding back supplies,” Balyan said.  The company is expanding its 10 million ton-a-year import
terminal at Dahej in the western state of Gujarat to 15 million
tons and is building a 5 million ton plant at Kochi in the
south. The company is evaluating a new terminal at Gangavaram
port on the east coast, it said in January.  To contact the reporters on this story:
