The  International Energy Agency  said
it will publish a report on  Iraq ’s energy industry and its
impact on global supply.  The analysis, scheduled to be released in October, will
cover trends in domestic energy demand, the Paris-based adviser
said today in an e-mailed statement. “It will address the
supply outlook and investment needs, both in power generation,
transmission and distribution as well as in hydrocarbon
development,” it said. The IEA’s World Energy Outlook for 2012
will be published in November.  To contact the reporter on this story:
