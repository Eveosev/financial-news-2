Jeremy Lin hit a last-second 3-
pointer and the  New York Knicks  defeated the  Toronto Raptors  90-
87 to stretch their winning streak to six games.  Lin got  New York ’s final six points tonight to lead the
team with 27 points, taking his tally to 161 since he jump-
started New York’s longest unbeaten streak since it went 7-0
from March 28 to April 10 last season.  Amar’e Stoudemire added 21 points in his return after
missing four games while mourning the death of his older brother
in a car crash. The Knicks trailed 86-77 with three minutes, 57
seconds remaining before out-scoring Toronto 13-1.  “Everyone’s smiling, there’s a new energy, everyone’s just
excited,” Lin told reporters at the Air Canada Centre in
Toronto. “We’re coming together as a team.”  The Knicks trailed by five points with 1:31 remaining. Iman
Shumpert’s dunk pulled them within three and Lin’s 3-point play
with 1:05 remaining tied the game at 87-87.  Each team missed a shot before Lin hit a 3-pointer with
nine-tenths of a second remaining to give the Knicks their only
lead since midway through the first quarter.  The Knicks, who are third in the Eastern Conference’s
 Atlantic Division , improve to 14-15, while Toronto drops to 9-21
with its sixth defeat in eight games this month.  Dumped By Two Teams  Lin, the first Harvard graduate to reach the NBA since Ed
Smith made 11 appearances for the Knicks in 1953-54, was cut by
his hometown Golden State Warriors and the  Houston Rockets 
before joining the Knicks on Dec. 27.  Before tonight, he averaged 26.8 points and eight assists
since coming off the bench to lead the Knicks to a 99-92 win
against the New Jersey Nets Feb. 4. In his prior nine games for
the Knicks, Lin averaged 3.6 points and 1.9 assists.  His performance against the Nets earned him a first career
start two days later against the  Utah Jazz , when top scorer
Carmelo Anthony injured his groin. Lin’s performances since --
including a career-high 38 points against the  Los Angeles Lakers 
-- made him the first player in NBA history to score at least 20
points and collect seven assists in his first four starts,
according to the Elias Sports Bureau.  His exploits in the absence of Anthony and Stoudemire have
helped drive shares in Knicks owner  Madison Square Garden Co. (MSG)  to
a record, while making his jersey the No. 1 seller in the league.  The Knicks, who lost 11 of 13 games prior to the Feb. 4 win
against the Nets, host the  Sacramento Kings  tomorrow to begin a
five-game homestand that also includes a visit by the NBA
champion Dallas Mavericks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
