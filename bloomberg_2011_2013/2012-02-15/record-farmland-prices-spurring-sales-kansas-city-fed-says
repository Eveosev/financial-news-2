Record cropland values in the U.S.
Great Plains are spurring more farmland sales as absentee owners
cash in on an agricultural boom, according to the  Federal
Reserve Bank of Kansas City .  Lenders in the Federal Reserve region that includes all or
parts of seven states in the Great Plains, Midwest and Rocky
Mountain area said cropland prices rose 25 percent in 2011 and
ranchland increased 14 percent, according to a survey released
today. Farmers remained the main source of purchases, buying 73
percent of farmland sold. Higher values translated into more
expensive rents, straining profits for tenant farmers, the Fed
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
