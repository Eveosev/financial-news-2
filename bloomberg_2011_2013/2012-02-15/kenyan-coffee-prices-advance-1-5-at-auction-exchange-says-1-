Kenyan coffee prices rose 1.5
percent at an auction yesterday as the supply of beans declined,
the Nairobi Coffee Exchange said.  The average price for all the coffee sold rose to $284.67
for a 50-kilogram (110-pound) bag, from $280.34 a week earlier,
the bourse said today by e-mail.  The benchmark AA grade climbed 1 percent to an average
$381.16 from $377.27 at the previous sale after supplies fell
about 14 percent to 3,949 bags, the exchange said.  The rise in prices was marginal because the quality of the
beans was lower and some of the major buyers weren’t active
because they had covered their orders, Mansukh Shah, a coffee
trader at the Nairobi-based Alanwood Ltd., said by phone.  “Prices were mixed with good grades fetching good prices
while low grades attracted low prices,” he said. “Some of the
big players weren’t in the market.”  Sales at the auction rose 2.8 percent to 8,117 bags worth
$2.81 million from 7,896 bags valued at $2.69 million a week
earlier, the exchange said.  Supplies of the beans at the 12th sale of 2011-12 season
fell 9.9 percent to 24,702 bags, the agency said.  Kenya harvests the bulk of its crop from October through
December, while a secondary crop is reaped from April to June.
The nation, whose output slumped 13 percent to 36,629 metric
tons in the 12 months ended Sept. 30, from 42,096 tons a year
earlier, is yet to make a forecast for 2011-12, Isaac Muchomba,
secretary of the Kenya Coffee Traders Association said on Jan.
