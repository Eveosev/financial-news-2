Incyte Corp. (INCY) , the Delaware-based
company that won U.S. approval to sell the first treatment for
patients with a rare bone-marrow disease, fell the most in four
months after fourth-quarter earnings missed estimates.  The drugmaker dropped 5.5 percent to $17.26 at 4:30 p.m.
New York time in the biggest single-day decline since Oct. 13.  Incyte reported a fourth-quarter net loss of $55.1 million,
or 44 cents per share, compared to net income of $32.5 million,
or 24 cents, a year earlier, when the results were boosted by
$69 million in milestone payments, Incyte said. Revenue fell 66
percent to $28.9 million. The median estimate of analysts was
for a loss of 42 cents a share and revenue of $25.6 million,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  In November, Incyte won approval for the drug for the bone-
marrow disorder myelofibrosis. The medicine, Jakafi, was
approved after clinical trials showed it was more effective than
a placebo or the best available therapy in easing symptoms of
the disease, the U.S.  Food and Drug Administration  said.  Myelofibrosis causes scar tissue to replace bone marrow,
leading to blood-cell production, and subsequent swelling, in
organs such as the liver and the spleen, according to the
 National Institutes of Health  in Bethesda,  Maryland .  To contact the reporter on this story:
