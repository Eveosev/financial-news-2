Italian government debt rose to a
 record  1.936 trillion euros ($2.5 trillion) in January as the
country funded its share of European Union bailouts and the
Treasury deposited more funds with the central bank, the  Bank of
Italy  said today in its public-finances supplement.  The euro-region’s second biggest debt increased by 37.9
billion euros from the 1.898 trillion euros reported for
December, the central bank said in the report.  The central government’s deficit reached 4 billion euros in
January, a 60 percent increase from the same month a year
earlier as  Italy  had to put up money for its share of EU
bailouts that have gone to Greece, Ireland and Portugal. The
debt was also inflated by 32.6 billion euros that the Treasury
had to deposit with the central bank, an increase that the Bank
of Italy said was typical for this time of the year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
