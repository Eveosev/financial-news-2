South Korea , which imports almost
all of its oil and natural gas needs, plans to increase
production at overseas fields to 35 percent of imports by 2020
to bolster energy security.  Output from overseas assets reached 465,000 barrels a day
of oil equivalent last year, or 13.7 percent of the country’s
oil and gas imports, the Ministry of Knowledge Economy said in
an e-mailed  statement  today. South Korea aims to produce an
additional 170,000 barrels a day this year, the ministry said.  The country, which imports 96 percent of its energy
requirements, is competing with economies including China and
 Japan  for global natural resources. South Korea plans to
increase its spending on overseas oil and gas development,
including asset acquisitions, by 34 percent to $11.8 billion
this year, according to the ministry in December.  Korea National Oil Corp. (KNOCPZ) , the state-run energy developer,
may sign a final contract with the  United Arab Emirates  by early
March to develop three oilfields in the Middle East country, the
ministry said today. KNOC, as the company is known, will also
continue oil and gas exploration projects in  Iraq  and in the
Ulleung Basin off South Korea’s eastern coast this year.  The state energy developer produced 220,000 barrels a day
from its overseas oilfields last year, up from 50,000 barrels in
2007, according to the ministry.  Korea Gas Corp. (036460)  aims to continue exploring for gas in
deepwater wells off the coast of Mozambique, and plans to make a
bid for a fourth round of exploration rights in Iraq in May, the
ministry said.  South Korea also plans to produce 43 percent of its demand
for strategic metals including uranium and iron ore from
overseas mines by 2020, compared with 12 percent last year,
according to the ministry.  The country may get 1,500 metric tons of rare-earth metals
a year through a project in  China  starting 2012, and 6,000 tons
from  South Africa  from 2015, the ministry said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
