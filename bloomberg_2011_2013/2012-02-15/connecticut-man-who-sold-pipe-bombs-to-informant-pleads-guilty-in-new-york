A Bridgeport,  Connecticut , man
pleaded guilty to making and dealing in bombs and firearms,
federal prosecutors said.  Nicholas Lahines, 38, also pleaded guilty today to
conspiring to distribute methamphetamine and to immigration
fraud before U.S. District Judge Leonard B. Sand in  Manhattan ,
U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara’s office said in a statement.  Lahines was indicted in May 2011 for selling eight
cylinders containing explosives to a confidential source of the
Federal Bureau of Investigation’s Joint Terrorism Task Force in
a parking lot in the Bronx,  New York .  “Nicholas Lahines’ stock in trade was homemade bombs that
he built to cause the maximum amount of harm,” Bharara said in
a statement. “And if they’d gotten into the wrong hands, they
would have done just that.”  Prosecutors said  law enforcement  suspected Lahines was
involved in the distribution of bombs and directed the
confidential source to meet with him. Lahines sold the source
two plastic containers for $3,200, each of which held four
cylindrical explosive devices, prosecutors said.  He faces as long as 65 years in prison at sentencing,
scheduled for June 18, with a minimum prison sentence of five
years for the count of conspiracy to distribute methamphetamine,
according to the statement.  The case is U.S. v. Lahines, 11-cr-00469, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
