Russian exports of ferrous scrap,
which is used to make steel, rose 5.2 percent to 5.9 million
metric tons last year from a year earlier as average contract
prices jumped and  Turkey  increased purchases.  The average contract price climbed 22 percent to about
$336.70 a ton from $276.75 a year earlier, the Economy Ministry
said on its  website .  “Exports rose also because Turkey, which traditionally
bought ferrous scrap from the U.S., purchased more from  Russia 
last year after U.S. domestic use of scrap metals increased,”
Dmitry Kolomytsyn, an analyst at Morgan Stanley in Moscow, said
by phone today.  Turkey accounted for about 39 percent of Russian scrap
exports last year, buying 2.28 million tons compared with about
1.86 million tons a year earlier, the ministry said.  Russia has about 5 percent to 6 percent of cross-border
ferrous scrap trading volumes, which are estimated at 100
million to 110 million tons, Kolomytsyn said. The country’s
sales abroad may have reached almost $2 billion last year from
about $1.6 billion a year earlier, according to the data.  The biggest consumers following Turkey were Belarus with
1.5 million tons,  South Korea  with 884,800 tons and  Spain  with
411,500 tons, the ministry said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
