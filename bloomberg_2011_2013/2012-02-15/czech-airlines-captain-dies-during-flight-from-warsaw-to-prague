A Czech Airlines AS pilot died
during a flight from Warsaw to  Prague , forcing the copilot to
land the jet, the state carrier said.  “We called the paramedics when the plane landed, however,
they weren’t able to save the captain’s life, which is tragic,”
spokeswoman Hana Hejskova said by phone today.  The co-pilot, who took over from the captain, landed
the jet without any problems. There wasn’t any threat to
passengers’ safety as the crews are trained to handle such
situations, Hejskova said.  The captain died during CSA’s regular flight OK-770 from
Warsaw to Prague’s international airport, according to the
airline.  CSA is the  Czech Republic ’s state loss-making airline,
which is slated for a sale by the government. The officials said
last month that the carrier is in preliminary talks with two
potential investors.  To contact the reporter on this story:
