The lira strengthened for the first
time in six days after the Turkish central bank reduced the
amount of loans available in one-week  repurchase agreements  at
its lowest 5.75 percent lending rate.  The currency appreciated 0.1 percent to 1.7670 per dollar
as of 5:19 p.m. in Istanbul, increasing its gain this year to 7
percent, the third highest among emerging markets in  Europe , the
 Middle East  and  Africa .  The central bank reduced lending at its lowest 5.75 percent
benchmark interest rate to 14 billion liras during Feb. 13 to
Feb. 15, down from 21 billion liras last week, pushing the
 overnight repurchase agreement rates  on the interbank market to
7.6 percent today from 6.6 percent two days ago, the lowest
since October.  “Reduced liquidity in weekly repo auctions will mean that
banks will have to borrow from interbank money market at
increased costs,” Ali Cakiroglu, an Istanbul-based strategist
at  HSBC Private Bank , said. “This may mean relatively less
pressure on the lira.”  The lira weakened 18 percent last year in the biggest
decline worldwide as the central bank reduced rates to a record
low of 5.75 percent in August to stimulate the economy and guard
against a probable recession in Europe, which buys roughly half
of Turkish exports. The central bank almost doubled lenders’
borrowing costs in October and sold dollars directly in the
markets after the lira’s slump pushed  inflation  to 10.5 percent
in December, almost twice the bank’s target of 5.5 percent for
2011.   Yields (BENCH)  on the benchmark two-year debt rose seven basis
points, or 0.07 percentage point, to 9.35 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
