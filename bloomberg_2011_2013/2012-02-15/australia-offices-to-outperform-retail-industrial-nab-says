Australian capital city office
values will rise 3 percent over the next two years, a  National
Australia Bank Ltd. (NAB)  survey showed.  Office property values will gain 1.6 percent by December,
the survey found. Retail property values will fall 0.5 percent
by December and industrial real estate will remain flat,
according to the report.  Australian business confidence rose to an eight-month high
and consumer confidence climbed in January after the central
bank cut  interest rates  twice late last year. The  Reserve Bank 
of Australia unexpectedly kept interest rates unchanged this
month, citing progress in Europe on addressing the region’s debt
crisis and improving financial market sentiment.  NAB’s commercial property index, which measures capital
value and rental pricing expectations in the real estate
industry, was minus 6 in the three months to December, from
minus 13 in the previous quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
