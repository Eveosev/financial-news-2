CBS Corp. (CBS) , owner of the most-watched
U.S. television network, posted fourth-quarter sales that missed
analysts’ estimates as advertising declined.  Revenue slid 3 percent to $3.78 billion, missing the $3.9
billion average of 21  estimates . Net income climbed 31 percent
to $370 million, or 55 cents a share, on higher fees from pay-TV
systems and affiliate stations, New York-based CBS said
yesterday in a  statement .  The absence of political ads contributed to lower revenue.
CBS, home to 19 of the 25 most-watched prime-time programs last
week, is getting more money from pay-TV systems and affiliates
for its programs, which boosts margins, according to  Michael Morris , an analyst at Davenport & Co. That helped counter
falling ad sales and a drop in revenue from rerun syndication.  “Diversifying our business is paying off and only getting
better,” Chief Executive Officer Leslie Moonves said yesterday
on a conference call.  CBS, controlled by Chairman  Sumner Redstone , fell as much
as 2.8 percent to $28.75 in extended trading. The stock lost 0.8
percent to $29.54 at the close yesterday in  New York  and is up
8.8 percent this year.  Excluding items, profit of 57 cents beat the 53-cent
average of 24 analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Revenue from affiliates and pay-TV services increased 8
percent to $460 million, according to the company statement,
while advertising sales slipped 4.4 percent and content
licensing shrank 4.8 percent.  CBS’s Share  The company expects to receive 9 percent to 10 percent of
total political spending, Moonves said on the call. Campaigns
may spend $2.6 billion by the time polls close Nov. 6, Barclays
Capital analyst  Anthony DiClemente  estimated last month.  Operating  profit  from the entertainment division, which
includes the CBS network and studios, gained 32 percent to $275
million on revenue that was little changed at $2 billion. The
company is consolidating operations at its TV and radio stations
to reduce costs.  This quarter, demand for TV ads pushed rates for
commercials up in the “mid-teens” on a percentage basis, Chief
Financial Officer Joe Ianniello said on the call.  In 2011, CBS’s international sales of TV shows exceeded $1
billion for the first time, Moonves said. CBS is in talks to
produce an original program for  Netflix Inc. (NFLX) , he said.  Cable Profit  Cable networks, led by the Showtime premium channel, posted
a 3.7 percent gain in income to $169 million. Sales advanced 7.3
percent to $395 million. Showtime had more than 21 million
subscribers at the end of 2011, Moonves said.  Profit from local broadcast operations slid 18 percent to
$242 million, reflecting lower political spending and lost
revenue from the labor dispute that stopped professional
basketball.  At Simon & Schuster publishing, profit rose 50 percent to
$27 million on $229 million in sales, fueled by purchases of the
Steve Jobs biography. The billboard unit’s profit climbed 81
percent to $76 million on $514 million in revenue.  CBS spent $170 million repurchasing 7 million shares during
the period. The company plans to buy at least $1 billion of its
 shares  every year, Moonves said. CBS had $660 million in cash as
of Dec. 31, 38 percent more than a year ago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
