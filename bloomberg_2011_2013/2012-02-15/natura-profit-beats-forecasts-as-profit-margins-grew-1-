Natura Cosmeticos SA (NATU3)  (NATU3)’s fourth-
quarter earnings exceeded analysts’ forecasts as  Latin America ’s
largest cosmetics company’s higher profit margins compensated
for sales that grew at a slower pace.  Net income rose 33 percent to 290.7 million reais ($168.2
million) from 219.3 million reais a year earlier, the Cajamar,
Brazil-based company said yesterday in a statement sent to the
website of Brazil’s securities regulator. The result was above
the 255.3 million reais average estimate of 12 analysts compiled
by Bloomberg.  Margins on earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation
and amortization -- a measure of profitability -- rose 7
percentage points from the same period last year to 30 percent,
according to the statement.  Natura sales grew at a slower pace as the company faced
logistics delays and discretionary  consumer spending  slowed,
Raymond James analyst  Daniela Bretthauer  wrote in a report to
clients dated Feb. 6.  A lack of new products “contributed to the softer sales
performance in Brazil,” wrote Bretthauer. She has a “market
perform” recommendation to the stock.  Sales rose 7.3 percent to 1.67 billion reais. This was the
third consecutive quarter with single-digit growth. The number
of direct sellers grew 16 percent in 2011, to 1.42 million.  Natura (NATU3)  rose 1.4 percent to 41 reais yesterday in São Paulo
trading. The stock is up 13 percent since the beginning of the
year, compared to a 15 percent jump in the  Bovespa (IBOV)  benchmark
index.  Editor: Jonathan Roeder  To contact the reporter on this story:
