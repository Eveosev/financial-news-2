Yoox SpA (YOOX)  Chief Executive Officer
 Federico Marchetti  said he expects profit margins at the online
fashion retailer to widen in 2012 as the company reaps the
benefit of investment in mobile commerce and logistics.  “2012 will be the year in which Yoox gathers the fruit,
also in terms of profitability,” Marchetti, who founded the
Bologna, Italy-based company in 2000 and is also its chairman,
said in a Feb. 13 telephone interview. “I feel very confident
about 2012 in terms of the top line.”  Yoox climbed 8.6 percent,  the most  in more than eight
months, in Milan trading on Feb. 9 after reporting a 36 percent
increase in 2011 revenue that exceeded analysts’  estimates .
 North America  replaced  Italy  as the company’s largest source of
revenue, accounting for about 21 percent of the 291.2 million-
euro ($383 million) total. Yoox reports 2011 profit on March 7.  Sales growth will continue in Italy in 2012, “but the
majority of the growth will come from international markets,
above all the U.S.,” where demand is “very positive” so far
this year, Marchetti said. Yoox’s partnership with  Conde Nast
Publications , which allows readers of the New York-based
publisher’s flagship title Vogue to buy goods via Yoox’s multi-
brand store, www.thecorner.com, is aiding growth, he said.  Revenue growth from so-called mono-brand websites such as
www.zegna.com and www.armani.com will continue to outpace multi-
brand sales as Yoox opens five or six e-commerce stores for
other brands this year, Marchetti said. The retailer will also
introduce www.yoox.com to  China  towards the end of 2012 and “we
cannot exclude opening” more multi-brand stores, the CEO said,
without specifying when or where.  To contact the reporter on this story:
