The U.S. may achieve energy
independence this decade because of growing North American oil
production from shale formations, according to  Citigroup Inc. (C)   U.S. shale oil output will grow by 2 million barrels a day
as California production increases by 1 million and U.S. Gulf of
Mexico output gains 2 million barrels, Seth Kleinman, global
head of energy strategy at Citigroup Inc. in  London , said in a
report today. Foreign imports will drop to 3 million barrels a
day, according to the forecast.  “U.S. oil production is rising fast, and net imports of
oil are falling sharply,” Kleinman said in the report. Net U.S.
oil and product imports are about 8 million barrels a day now,
he said.  Canadian production is expected to rise by 1.6 million
barrels by 2020, according to the report, which cited the
Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers.  Between 1 million and 2 million barrels a day of demand may
be cut through conservation and shifting transport fuels for
heavy- and medium-duty trucks to liquefied and compressed
natural gas, according to the report.  “It’s a combination of production growth out of the U.S.
midcontinent as well as Western Canada,” said Aakash Doshi, a
New York-based strategist for Citigroup and a co-author of the
report. “That is coupled with a structural decline for domestic
product demand, such as gasoline, in the U.S. That leaves the
possibility for the U.S. to be a large net exporter of products
and potentially crude, should the government allow it.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
