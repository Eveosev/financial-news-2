Rangers soccer club, the Scottish
team that entered a form of bankruptcy yesterday, will attempt
to resolve its dispute with U.K. tax authorities quickly, its
administrators said.  “Our first priority has been to ensure that the football
club continues to function and this is being achieved with the
help of staff, players and management,” said Paul Clark and
David Whitehouse, of the team’s administrators, Duff and Phelps.
“We would like to thank the club’s business partners who are
going the extra mile to ensure that Saturday’s home match
against Kilmarnock goes ahead as scheduled.”  The team’s parent,  Rangers Football Club Plc (RFC) , went into
administration because of unpaid bills owed to the U.K.  Owner Craig Whyte yesterday placed the club into
administration after HM Revenue & Customs went to court in
Edinburgh to force the move on its terms, which would have
allowed the government to appoint the executives overseeing the
bankruptcy.  Rangers, the defending Scottish soccer champion, remains in
second place after a 10-point deduction from the league because
of the bankruptcy.  “In broad terms, supporters can be reassured that Rangers
will continue as a football club and we hope to reach a stage as
soon as possible where the Club can emerge from
administration,” Clark and Whitehouse said today in an e-mailed
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
