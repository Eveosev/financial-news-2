Groupon Inc., the biggest seller of
so-called daily deals, said it expects to complete by March 12
settlement of a group of consolidated class-action lawsuits
alleging the expiration dates on its coupons are improper.  Lawyers for Groupon and the plaintiffs said in a Feb. 13
filing in federal court in  San Diego  that they have resolved
disagreements about the settlement terms and anticipate filing
settlement documents for the judge’s approval next month. The
terms of the settlement weren’t disclosed.  Seventeen lawsuits against Chicago-based Groupon were
consolidated before U.S. District Judge Dana M. Sabraw in San
Diego. The plaintiffs claim Groupon and various retailers
violate federal and state consumer protection laws with improper
expiration dates and other provisions for the vouchers, such as
the requirement that they be used in a single transaction.  “Groupon effectively creates a sense of urgency among
consumers to quickly purchase ‘groupon’ gift certificates by
offering ‘daily deals’ for a short amount of time,” according
to the first case filed last year. “Consumers therefore feel
pressured and are rushed into buying the gift certificates and
unwittingly become subject to the onerous sales conditions.”  Julie Mossler, a spokeswoman for Groupon, and John Stoia Jr., a lawyer representing the plaintiffs, didn’t immediately
return calls seeking comment on the settlement.  The cases are In re Groupon Inc. Marketing and Sales
Practices Litigation, 11-MD-2238, U.S. District Court, Southern
District of  California  (San Diego.)  To contact the reporter on this story:
