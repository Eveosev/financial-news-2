Greece  will offer investors the
opportunity to decide whether they want to buy gas companies
 DEPA SA  and Desfa together or as separate entities, Greek Energy
Minister  George Papaconstantinou  said.  Greece plans to sell state-controlled natural supplier Depa
and gas grid operator Desfa as part of a plan to raise 50
billion euros ($65 billion) from state asset sales or
redevelopment. The country has to get 19 billion euros of this
by the end of 2015, according to the terms of a second bailout
package of loans for Greece.  The  Hellenic Republic Asset Development Fund , which is
overseeing the privatization program, will proceed in the next
few weeks with the first phase of selling the two companies,
Papaconstantinou said in  Athens  today, according to a transcript
of his comments e-mailed from the Athens-based  Environment,
Energy and Climate Change Ministry .  “As provided in the memorandum and in accordance with the
agreement we made with our European partners, we will allow the
market itself to say how interested it is in a consolidated
company or in two separate companies,” Papaconstantinou said.  Greece has also asked Public Power Corp. SA, the country’s
dominant electricity producer, to stop exports and to activate
other power units that don’t use natural gas, Papaconstantinou
said. This is to avoid supply problems as supplies to Greece
fall amid high demand from  Europe  because of an extreme cold
snap and an accident in neighboring  Turkey , he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
