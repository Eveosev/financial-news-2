Shares of the following companies
had  unusual  moves in  China  trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses as of the close.  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP) , which tracks the bigger of
China’s stock exchanges, rose 21.93 points, or 0.9 percent, to
2,366.70, the highest close since Dec. 1. The  CSI 300 Index 
gained 1.1 percent to 2,549.61.  Shipping lines:  China Cosco Holdings Co. (601919)  (601919 CH), the
world’s largest operator of dry-bulk ships, jumped 3.5 percent
to 5.58 yuan, its highest close since Dec. 13. China Shipping

biggest sea-cargo group, added 3.8 percent to 6.53 yuan.  China
Shipping Container Lines Co. (601866)  (601866 CH), the country’s second-
largest carrier of sea-cargo boxes, surged 4 percent to 2.89
yuan.  The  Baltic Dry Index (BDIY) , a measure of commodity shipping
costs, rose for a seventh day yesterday as demand to transport
crops from  South America  helped to reduce the supply of vessels.
The gauge climbed 0.7 percent to 734, according to the London-
based  Baltic Exchange .  “The rebound in shipping stocks could continue should the
economies of  Europe  and the U.S. sustain their recovery and
cargo volumes improve from the second half of February,” Du Jianping, an analyst at Bank of China Ltd. in Beijing, wrote in
a report.  Pang Da Automobile Trade Co. (601258)  (601258 CH), China’s biggest
listed auto dealer, jumped 10 percent for a third straight day
to 8.93 yuan, its highest close since Nov. 29. Chairman Pang Qinghua said yesterday the company is building two new
dealerships in southern China’s Yunnan province that will sell
imported Volkswagen AG Phaeton cars.  Pingdingshan Tianan Coal Mining Co. (601666)  (601666 CH), the listed
unit of China’s fifth-largest producer of the coal, advanced 2.6
percent to 12.60 yuan. Shenyin & Wanguo Securities Co. raised
the rating on the stock to “buy” from “neutral,” Liu Xiaoning, an analyst at the Shanghai-based brokerage, said in a
report dated today. The brokerage’s estimated price-earnings
ratio for the coal producer this year of 13 times is lower than
the industry average of 15 times, according to the report.  ZTE Corp. (000063)  (000063 CH), China’s second-biggest phone-
equipment maker, surged 6 percent to 16.26 yuan, the biggest
gain in almost a year. ZTE and Ericsson AB signed an agreement

each other, the Chinese company said in a statement yesterday.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
