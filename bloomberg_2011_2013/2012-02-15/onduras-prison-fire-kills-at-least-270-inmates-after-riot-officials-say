At least 350 inmates died in a fire
that swept through a prison in central  Honduras  late yesterday,
the Security Ministry said in a statement.  About 500 prisoners at the prison in Comayagua, near San
Pedro Sula, an industrial hub 110 miles (177 kilometers) north
of the capital, survived the blaze, the ministry said.  Riot police surrounded the prison today as relatives of
convicts gathered outside, some throwing stones at the police,
images broadcast by Honduran television showed.  Hundreds of prisoners were trapped after the building was
“completely engulfed in flames” that took more than six hours
to put out, Josue Garcia, a spokesman for the Comayagua fire
department, said in a phone interview today. Some survivors
climbed onto roofs and others ran into the prison yard to escape
the blaze, he said.  The fire may have broken out during a riot by inmates,
Garcia said, though investigations to determine the cause are
continuing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
