Renaissance Services SAOG (RNSS)  led gains
in Oman after the provider of services to the oil and gas
industry reported a higher-than-expected increase in 2011
revenue.  The shares surged 6.4 percent, the steepest rise in more
than five months, to 0.552 Omani rial, at the 1 p.m. close in
Muscat. The benchmark  MSM30 Index (MSM30)  rose 0.5 percent to 5,636.86,
the highest level in a month.  Revenue increased 14 percent to 290 million rials ($753
million), the Muttrah, Oman-based company said in a statement to
the  Muscat bourse  today. The  median  estimate of five analysts
was for revenue of 277 million rials, according to  data
compiled by Bloomberg.  “The shares reacted positively to the higher-than-
expected revenue in 2011 as compared to the market consensus,”
said Kanaga Sundar, head of research at Gulf Baader Capital
Markets Co. in Muscat. “Overall, we saw improved performance
during the last quarter.”  Net income declined to 2.3 million rials from 32.3 million
rials. “In 2011, we addressed a series of one-off operational
challenges and we are now well-placed to move forward and
progress the company’s dynamic growth strategy,” Chief
Executive Officer Stephen Thomas said in the statement.  Seven analysts  recommend investors buy shares of
Renaissance, while 2 have a hold rating on the stock.  “We expect the company to report a profit after tax and
minority interest of 18.9 million rials in 2012,” Gulf Baader’s
Sundar said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
