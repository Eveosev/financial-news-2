Graft is pervasive in Kazakh
banking, with every seventh borrower paying a bribe to secure a
loan, a poll released today shows.  The  Sange  research center said 14 percent of respondents
were asked by bank employees to make a payment to facilitate
credit, while 7 percent believed delivering a “gift” to bank
managers or other officials will lower the cost of borrowing,
according to an e-mailed report.  “The corruption schemes that are being used show that the
phenomenon isn’t episodic in character but represents an
attuned, well coordinated mechanism,” the center said.  Kazakhs are paying an average bribe of $2,755 to banks,
with a maximum payment reaching $40,000, the survey showed.  The poll of 500 Kazakhs was conducted in 16 cities in
October and November. No margin of error was given.  To contact the reporter on this story:
