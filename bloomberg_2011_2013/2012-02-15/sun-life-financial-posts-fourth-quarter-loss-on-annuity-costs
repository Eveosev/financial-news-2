Sun Life Financial Inc. (SLF) , Canada’s
third-largest insurer, reported a fourth-quarter loss because of
costs tied of variable-annuity and segregated-fund contracts.  The net loss was C$525 million ($525 million), or 90 cents
a share, compared with net income of C$504 million, or 84 cents,
a year earlier, Toronto-based Sun Life said today in a
statement. It was the company’s second straight quarterly loss.  Sun Life recorded C$635 million for the costs, within the
range of C$550 million and C$650 million it predicted in
November. Insurers are affected by falling equities because they
reduce investment income while increasing the amounts that must
be paid out to clients who bought guaranteed investment
products.  Manulife Financial Corp.,  Canada ’s largest insurer, said
last week it had a fourth-quarter loss of C$69 million, or 5
cents a share. Great-West Lifeco Inc., the No. 2 insurer,
reported that profit rose 7.5 percent to C$500 million, or 52
cents a share.  (Sun Life will hold a conference call tomorrow at 10 a.m.
Toronto time to discuss results. To listen, dial +1-416-644-3414
