Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia Inc. (MSO) 
is “essentially holding Macy’s hostage” by saying that its
pact with the department-store chain expires in January 2013,
Macy’s Inc. said in court papers in their contract dispute.  Macy’s sued in January to stop New York-based  Martha
Stewart  Living from executing an agreement to sell merchandise
in J.C. Penney Co. stores. Macy’s, based in Cincinnati, said it
has the exclusive right to sell Martha Stewart-branded products
in certain categories.  Martha Stewart Living fired back last week, accusing Macy’s
of breach of contract and saying that the retailer has stocked
and priced Martha Stewart products in a manner that favors
Macy’s own private-label brands. Martha Stewart Living also said
Macy’s couldn’t have exercised a five-year renewal option on the
deal between the two companies because of the breach.  “The uncertainty created by MSLO’s breach has put Macy’s
in an inequitable and untenable position,” Macy’s said in
papers filed yesterday in New York state  Supreme Court . “If the
agreement were to actually expire in January 2013, Macy’s would
have to immediately begin seeking to replace and wind down the
Martha Stewart product line at Macy’s.”  Jeanne Meyer, a spokeswoman for Martha Stewart Living, said
the company stands behind earlier statements and what has been
said in court filings.  The case is  Macy’s Inc. (M)  v. Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia
Inc., 650197/2012, New York State Supreme Court ( Manhattan ).  To contact the reporter on this story:
