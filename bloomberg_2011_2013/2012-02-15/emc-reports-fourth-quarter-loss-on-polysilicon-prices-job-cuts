MEMC Electronic Materials Inc. (WFR) , the
second-largest U.S. polysilicon maker, posted a fourth-quarter
loss 38 percent greater than its market value as the price for
the main raw material in solar cells plunged and it had costs
related to cutting production and its workforce.  Net loss for the quarter was $1.48 billion, or $6.44 a
share, compared with a profit of $12.6 million, or 5 cents,  a
year earlier , the St. Peters, Missouri-based company said in a
statement released after the close of regular trading today. The
loss exceeded the $5.90 a share average of 13 analysts’
estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Prices for polysilicon  fell  65 percent last year to $26.52
a kilogram at the end of December as Chinese companies increased
production while demand slowed for solar panels. The material
rebounded 8.6 percent to $28.80 this year through Feb. 6.  The results were “a complete wipeout,”  Theodore O’Neill ,
an analyst at Wunderlich Securities Inc. in  New York , said today
in an interview. “I think the biggest surprise is that they’re
not providing guidance for the first quarter of 2012. You’re
sort of left wondering what’s going on.”  MEMC said Dec. 8 it would fire 20 percent of its workforce
and cut production, and take a $700 million charge in the fourth
quarter.  Excluding the charges, net loss was $48.9 million, or 21
cents a share. Analysts had expected a loss of 7.7 cents, the
average of seven estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  MEMC fell 1.5 percent to $4.65 at the close in New York,
giving it a market value of about $1.07 billion. The shares
climbed 3 percent to $4.79 at 5:29 p.m., after the close of
regular trading.  Hemlock Semiconductor Corp., based in Hemlock,  Michigan , is
the world’s biggest polysilicon producer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
