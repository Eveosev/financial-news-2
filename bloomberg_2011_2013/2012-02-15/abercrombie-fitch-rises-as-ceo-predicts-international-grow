Abercrombie & Fitch Co. , the
operator of its namesake and Hollister teen-clothing stores,
rose after the U.S. company said international sales growth
would boost profit this year.  Abercrombie rose 8.3 percent to $48.30 at the close in  New
York . The  stock  fell 15 percent last year.  Net income fell 15 percent to $127.7 million, or $1.43 a
share, in the fourth quarter ended Jan. 28, from $150.3 million,
or $1.67, a year earlier, the  New Albany , Ohio-based company
said today in a statement. Abercrombie cut costs, including
closing 68 U.S. stores, and plans to invest more in its direct
and international business, Chief Executive Officer Michael Jeffries told analysts and investors on a conference call.  “Based on these factors, we predict strong EPS growth in
2012,” Jeffries said. The company reiterated its full year
forecast for adjusted profit of $3.50 to $3.75 a share.  The company, which operated 1,045 stores as of the end of
its fourth quarter, said it plans to open locations this year in
Hamburg,  Hong Kong , Munich, Dublin, Amsterdam and  London .  Net sales in the fourth quarter rose 16 percent, while
while international sales increased 62 percent, the company
said. Same-store sales were flat, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
