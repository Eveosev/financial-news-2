South African  retail sales  rose at
the fastest pace in eight months in December as  interest rates 
at the lowest level in more the 30 years helped boost spending
during the year-end shopping season.  Retail sales climbed 8.7 percent compared with a revised
7.2 percent a month earlier, Pretoria-based Statistics  South
Africa  said on its website today. The  median estimate  in a
Bloomberg survey of 11 economists was 6.5 percent. Sales rose
1.3 percent from a month earlier.  Interest rates “played a significant role,” said Thabi Leoka, head of macroeconomic research for South Africa at
 Standard Bank (SBK)  Group Ltd. “We were expecting very strong numbers
leading up to the Christmas period.”  The retail industry in  Africa ’s biggest economy was the
fastest growing segment of  gross domestic product  in the third
quarter as a contraction in mining and manufacturing undermined
growth. The economy expanded 1.4 percent in the three months
through September, close to a two-year low. The industry added
48,000 jobs in the fourth quarter, the third-largest gain in
employment during that period, Statistics South Africa said Feb.
7.  Stable Rates  The central bank has held the benchmark lending rate at 5.5
percent since November 2010 to support the economy as a European
debt crisis threatens to pull that region, one of South Africa’s
biggest trading partners, into recession.  Massmart Holdings Ltd. (MSM) , the retailer controlled by  Wal-Mart
Stores Inc. (WMT) , said Jan. 11 first-half sales to December rose 15
percent. South African retailer  Mr Price Group Ltd. (MPC) ’s sales
increased 16 percent in the three months through December, the
company said Jan. 12.  The rand strengthened 0.5 percent to 7.6845 per dollar at
1:50 p.m. in Johannesburg. It was at 7.6955 before the data was
released. The currency has gained 5.4 percent this year against
the dollar.  The yield on the benchmark rand debt due in 2015 dropped 3
basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 6.59 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
