Turkey’s budget surplus grew 73
percent to 1.7 billion liras ($970 million) in January from a
year ago, Finance Minister Mehmet Simsek said.  The surplus increased from 1 billion liras a year ago,
Simsek said at a news conference in Ankara today.  The so-called primary surplus, which excludes interest
payments on debt, expanded to 7.1 billion liras last month from
4.8 billion liras in January 2011, he said.  Yields (TRABNBM)  on two-year benchmark bonds rose 2 basis points, or
0.02 percentage point, to 9.30 percent at 14:17 p.m. in
Istanbul. The lira rose 0.5 percent to 1.7601 per dollar.  The government plans to maintain the positive budget
performance that will allow it to reduce interest expenditures
and allocate more funds to areas where it’s needed, Simsek said.  Income rose 20 percent to 28.1 billion liras, outpacing a
17 percent gain in expenditure, according to data posted on the
 Finance Ministry ’s website. Tax revenue made up 84 percent of
total revenue in January. Interest spending surged 42 percent to
5.39 billion liras, the ministry said.  “If economic growth slows as expected, the budget
performance may be affected negatively, as taxes make up a
majority of the revenues,” Murat Yardimci, head of trading at
ING Bank AS in Istanbul, said in e-mailed comments. The Turkish
economy is expected to grow 3.4 percent this year, according to
a central bank survey of economists and business leaders,
published Feb. 8. Growth was 9.6 percent in the first nine
months of 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
