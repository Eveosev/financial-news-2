Holding SAE , which owns a stake in  Egyptian Co. for Mobile
Services,  fell for the first time in more than three weeks amid
speculation its 76-percent rally over the period was overdone.  Shares (OTMT)  of the Cairo-based company snapped a 14-day winning
streak, retreating 5.7 percent to 1.49 Egyptian pounds at 12:49
p.m. in Cairo. That gave the company a market value of 7.8
billion pounds ($1.3 billion).  Egypt ’s benchmark  EGX 30 Index 
retreated 0.6 percent.  France Telecom SA (FTE)  said Feb. 13 it reached a preliminary
agreement to increase its stake in  Egyptian Co., known as 
Mobinil, at 202.5 Egyptian pounds ($33.55) a share. The
transaction is pending approval from shareholders and
regulators.  “We’re seeing profit-taking as the shares near the 1.8-
pound level we estimate they are worth after the Mobinil sale,”
said Tamer Nigm, head of sales and trading at Cairo-based
Watheeqa Securities Brokerage. “It’s still unclear whether
profit from the sale will be distributed fully or partially to
investors.”  Mobinil shares jumped the daily limit of 10 percent for a
third day to 166.83 pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
