Venezuela will begin to present
regulated prices to about 385 companies that produce personal
care and cleaning products including  Colgate-Palmolive Co. (CL) ,
 Procter & Gamble  Co. and  Unilever NV (UNA)  today.  The government’s  price regulation agency , which froze the
price of 19 goods ranging from deodorant to toilet paper in
November, said in a statement late yesterday that the companies
can retrieve documents detailing the new regulated price and the
government calculations for profit margins on the goods
beginning today until Feb. 18.  The government will allow the consumer companies to review
the list of new prices during five business days to give them
the opportunity to suggest changes to the price structure before
Feb. 26, according to the statement.  Venezuelan President  Hugo Chavez  created the price
regulation agency last year as he widens price controls to slow
inflation that he says is fueled by capitalist speculation.
 Venezuela ’s  annual inflation rate  was 26 percent in January, the
highest of 78 economies tracked by Bloomberg.  On Feb. 9, Chavez said his government is setting the price
of a Procter & Gamble deodorant 24 percent lower and a 5-liter
bottle of water 46 percent lower as examples.  Other items that are set to be lowered in accordance with
the price agency include toothpaste, bleach, shampoo, diapers
and soap.  To contact the reporter on this story:
