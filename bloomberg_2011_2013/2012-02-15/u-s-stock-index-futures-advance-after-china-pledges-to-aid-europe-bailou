U.S. stocks fell, sending the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index lower for a second day, as concern
grew that Greece was moving closer to default and the  Federal
Reserve  said policy makers were divided on buying more assets.  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  decreased 2.3 percent, reversing a 3.3 percent
rally and snapping an eight-day advance.  Industrial shares  had
the biggest decline in the S&P 500 among 10 groups as Deere &
Co. tumbled 5.4 percent after lowering its 2012 U.S. farmer
revenue forecast. The Dow Jones Transportation Average, a proxy
for the economy, slumped 2 percent as  CSX Corp. (CSX)  and  Union
Pacific Corp. (UNP)  retreated more than 2.8 percent.  The S&P 500 declined 0.5 percent to 1,343.23 at 4 p.m. New
York time, reversing an earlier increase of as much as 0.4
percent. The  Dow Jones Industrial Average  decreased 97.33
points, or 0.8 percent, to 12,780.95 today.  “People just keep trying to delay the  Greece  situation,”
 Peter Sorrentino , a fund manager who helps oversee $14.5 billion
at Huntington Asset Advisors in Cincinnati, said in a telephone
interview. “What’s haunting everyone is that if this thing is
delayed too much longer, you’ve another series of hurdles. We’re
a prisoner of that.”  Stocks fell as concern that Greece will miss a debt payment
next month grew. A decision slated for tonight on 130 billion
euros ($171 billion) of aid was postponed until at least Feb. 20
and possibly until after a full-time Greek government emerges
from elections later in the year. Minutes of the Fed’s last
meeting showed a few policy makers said the central bank may
have to consider purchasing more securities soon, while others
said the economic outlook would have to worsen.  ‘More Involved’  Equities gained earlier today as  China  said it will “get
more involved” in supporting  Europe  and sustain its holdings of
euro assets, spurring optimism the debt crisis would be
overcome.  “It’s very clear that China realized the costs of a
possible European recession that spreads to the rest of the
world,” James Swanson, who oversees about $200 billion as chief
investment strategist at Boston-based MFS Investment Management,
said in a telephone interview. “Yet they haven’t fixed their
problems and China can’t fix their problems.”  The  S&P 500  has rallied 6.8 percent  this year  as the  U.S.
economy  showed signs of accelerating and European leaders moved
closer to a solution on the region’s debt crisis. The U.S
economy is forecast to grow 2.2 percent in 2012, according to
the median projection in a survey of economists, up from the
estimate of 2.1 percent in December.  Nine out of 10  groups  in the S&P 500 fell today. The Morgan
Stanley Cyclical Index dropped 0.8 percent amid concern about
economic growth.  Cash Pile  Apple retreated 2.3 percent to $497.67, two days after
closing above $500 for the first time. The shares rose earlier
today as CEO Tim Cook yesterday asked for forbearance from
investors while the company discusses how to best use its
growing cash pile.  “Apple’s CEO Tim Cook indicated that the board of
directors continues to focus more time on the use of cash, which
seems to increase the likelihood of a dividend and/or stock
buyback,” William Power, a Robert W Baird & Co. analyst, wrote
in a note to clients today. “We continue to believe that even a
conservative 2 percent dividend yield could help attract an
additional wave of investors.”  Deere (DE)  lost 5.4 percent to $84.28. Total U.S. farm receipts
will be $371.9 billion in 2012, down from a November forecast
for $374.2 billion and lower than the record $381.4 billion in
2011, as corn, wheat and soybean prices decline, the Moline,
Illinois-based company said today in a  presentation  accompanying
its fiscal first-quarter results.  Transportation Shares  A measure of  transportation  shares had the biggest decline
in the S&P 500 among 24 industries, slumping 2 percent as a
group. CSX decreased 2.9 percent to $21.19. Union Pacific
retreated 3.3 percent to $109.41.  The biggest component of Warren Buffett’s most-watched
index is falling, and the decline may depress first-half
earnings at U.S. railroads. Buffett follows a gauge of freight-
train traffic that’s compiled by the Association of American
Railroads, as he told ABC News in a 2009 interview. This
indicator tracks the number of carloads, and coal accounts for a
bigger percentage of the shipments than any other category.  “Coal results have been significantly below our prior
expectations for the first quarter,” Gary Chase, a Barclays
Capital analyst, wrote yesterday in a report. Shipments in the
first five weeks of this year dropped 2.9 percent from the same
period of last year. The total of 120,052 carloads for the week
ended Feb. 4 was the lowest for that time of year since 2004.  Profit Estimates  Earnings per share swing by 0.5 percent at CSX and Norfolk
Southern Corp. and by 0.2 percent at Union Pacific for every 1
percent change in the amount of coal they ship, Chase wrote. The
New York-based analyst cut first- and second-quarter profit
estimates on the railroads because of the current slump.
Buffett’s  Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A)  owns a competitor, Burlington
Northern Santa Fe.  Zynga Inc. retreated 18 percent to $11.80. The biggest
developer of games for Facebook Inc.’s site fell the most since
it first started trading after product-development costs weighed
on profit in the fourth quarter.  Dean Foods Co. (DF)  rallied 10 percent, the most in the S&P 500,
to $11.99. The biggest U.S. milk processor reported lower raw-
milk costs at its fresh dairy business.  Abercrombie & Fitch Co. (ANF)  increased 8.3 percent to $48.30.
The operator of its namesake and Hollister teen-clothing stores
said international sales growth would boost  profit  this year.  Potato Chips  Kellogg Co. (K)  jumped 5.1 percent to $52.87 after agreeing to
acquire  Procter & Gamble Co. (PG) ’s Pringles potato chip business for
about $2.7 billion in cash to triple its global snacks sales
after a deal with Diamond Foods Inc. fell through.  Comcast Corp. (CMCSA)  added 4.7 percent to $28.52. The largest U.S.
cable company climbed after fourth-quarter profit rose more than
analysts estimated and video-customer losses narrowed for the
fifth straight period.  Blackstone Group LP’s  Byron Wien , whose prediction for the
U.S. economy and stock market in 2011 proved too optimistic,
said he may need to lift his estimate for the S&P 500 for this
year. Wien, chairman of Blackstone’s advisory services unit,
said in January in his annual “10 Surprises” list the
benchmark gauge for U.S. stocks may exceed 1,400. He said today
in a Bloomberg Radio interview he may have to raise the
projection.  “1,400 when the market was 1,250 at the beginning of the
year was a reasonable target, a conservative target,” Wien said
in an interview today on Bloomberg Radio’s “Bloomberg
Surveillance” with  Tom Keene . “But I think we could well
exceed it. Look, S&P 500 operating earnings are going to be in
excess of $100. Very often, almost always, the S&P 500 sells at
15 times, that would take you over 1,500.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
