FMC Technologies Inc. (FTI) , the third-
largest U.S. oilfield-equipment maker, fell the most in more
than five months after reporting operating profit margin for its
biggest segment dropped more than expected.  FMC fell 5.1 percent to $51.02 at the close in  New York ,
the biggest decline since Aug. 18.  Operating profit margin for its subsea-technology group,
which sells equipment for offshore oil and natural-gas
production, dropped to 7.2 percent in the fourth quarter,
compared to 12.3 percent a year earlier, the Houston-based
company reported in a statement released after the close of
regular U.S. trading yesterday.  “We knew that subsea execution would make or break the
quarter, but we did not expect margins in the single digits,”
 Brian Uhlmer , an analyst at Global Hunter Securities LLC in
Houston, wrote in a note to investors today.  FMC reported net income fell to $99.2 million, or 41 cents
a share, from $99.3 million, or 41 cents, a year earlier. Per-
share profit was 10 cents less than the average of 27 analysts’
 estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  FMC gave 2012 earnings guidance below analysts’ estimates.
FMC Technologies expects 2012 earnings per share in the range of
$2.10 to $2.25. The average of 15  estimates  compiled by
Bloomberg is $2.27.  National Oilwell Varco Inc. and Cameron International Corp.
are the first and second-largest makers of oilfield equipment,
respectively.  To contact the reporter on this story:
