Symantec Corp. (SYMC)  said a minute-long
lurch that briefly wiped out more than $1.5 billion in its stock
value before a trading halt earlier today was caused by a
clerical error in a legitimate trade.  A large order to sell without any specified minimum price
sent the shares down as much as 11 percent, triggering a circuit
breaker, said Cris Paden, a spokesman for the  Mountain View ,
California-based company. Symantec consulted with the Nasdaq
Stock Market, which lists its shares, to identify the bank that
handled the trade and the entity that initiated it, neither of
which the company is naming, Paden said.  “This was the first time this has happened to us,” Paden
said. “This was a very unusual event.”  After opening today at $24.48, Symantec traded within a 14-
cent range until just after 10:10 a.m., when it fell as low as
$21.93 in less than a minute. More than 258,000 Symantec shares
changed hands in 776 trades between 10:11 and 10:12 a.m.  New
York  time at prices below $24, according to  data compiled by
Bloomberg . The stock rebounded after a five-minute halt
triggered by the plunge ended.  The tumble to $21.93 represented the shares’ biggest
intraday decline since April 2012. The stock had advanced 29
percent this year, compared with a 12 percent gain for the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index. The stock slipped 1.2 percent to
$24.30 today.  “The marketwide single stock trading pause worked
precisely as designed” and no trades were canceled, Robert Madden, a spokesman for Nasdaq OMX, said by phone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
