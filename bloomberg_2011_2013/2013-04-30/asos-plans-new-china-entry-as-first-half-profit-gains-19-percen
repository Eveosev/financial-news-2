Asos Plc (ASC) , the U.K.’s largest
online-only fashion retailer, said it plans to start a new
website in  China  next financial year after first-half profit
climbed 19 percent, meeting analysts’ expectations.  Profit before tax rose to 25.7 million pounds ($40 million)
in the six months through February, the London-based retailer
said in a statement today. That matched the average estimate of
six analysts compiled by Bloomberg.  Asos, whose shares have doubled in value in the last 12
months, is outpacing rivals with its lower-priced own-brand
offering in the U.K. and a focus on new fashion content like its
FashionFinder micro-site in markets like  France , Germany and the
U.S. The retailer said it will start in  Russia  next month and in
China in the new financial year after an internal review found a
new operating model was necessary for the world’s most populous
country.  “Momentum is strong, and we remain positive in our outlook
for 2012/13” Chief Executive Officer Nick Robertson said in the
statement.  The Chinese business will differ from the company’s other
international models as it will have its own standalone
technology platform, local third-party distribution center, and
a larger in-country team, costing up to 6 million pounds a year
for the first two years, according to the statement.  The
retailer reiterated its target of 1 billion pounds of sales by
2015.  The shares rose 3 percent to 3,076 pence in  London  trading
yesterday. That boosted this year’s gain to 14 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
