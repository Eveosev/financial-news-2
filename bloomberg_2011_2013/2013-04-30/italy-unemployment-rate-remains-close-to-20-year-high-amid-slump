Italy’s  unemployment rate  remained
near a 20-year high in March as companies refrained from hiring
amid political gridlock and the longest economic recession in
two decades.  Joblessness was unchanged at 11.5 percent after the
February reading was revised down from an initial 11.7 percent,
the Rome-based national statistics office Istat said in a
preliminary report today. The March rate was lower than the 11.7
percent  median  of six estimates in a Bloomberg News survey.
Unemployment remained above 10 percent for a 14th month.  The euro region’s third-biggest economy will shrink 1.8
percent this year amid rising unemployment and low consumer and
investor confidence, Mooody’s Investors Service forecast April
26. That compares with the governmen’s estimate for a 1.3
percent contraction. The Rome-based Treasury also projected that
 joblessness (ITMUURS)  will rise to 11.6 percent from 10.7 percent at the
end of 2012. Italy’s newly appointed Prime Minister Enrico Letta
told Italian lawmakers that employment will be the “top
priority” of his government.  Still,  consumer confidence  unexpectedly increased in April
as two months of political paralysis following inconclusive
elections on February neared an end through the formation of the
new government.  The unemployment rate for people between the age of 15 and
24 rose to 36.3 percent in March, Istat said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
