Federal Election Commissioner
Caroline Hunter’s term expires today, which means all of the
commission members are now serving on borrowed time.  It’s the latest embarrassment for the Obama administration
and the FEC, which for years has been stymied because its
partisan split -- three Democratic members and three Republicans
-- has paralyzed the agency on election enforcement cases and
efforts to rewrite campaign-finance disclosure rules to adapt to
the new groups that entered the political arena in the 2012
campaigns.  As the members’ terms began expiring in 2007,  Barack Obama ,
then a candidate for president, told a Chicago-based advocacy
group in a  questionnaire  that the “FEC needs to be
strengthened” and that his “initial goal as president will be
to determine whether we can make the FEC more effective through
appointments.”  Since taking office in 2009, Obama has made just one
nomination, later withdrawn, in more than four years. Meanwhile,
all of the FEC commissioners’ terms have expired; they continue
to serve until replacements are confirmed by the  U.S. Senate .  “It’s sort of like the stunning last piece of evidence”
of the collapse of the election-monitoring organization, said
former Senator Russell Feingold, a Wisconsin Democrat who
introduced legislation while in office to replace the six-member
FEC with a three-member agency.  White House spokesman  Eric Schultz  said he wouldn’t
speculate on future appointments.  “But the president intends to nominate well-qualified
candidates, and we will continue to support strong enforcement
of our campaign-finance laws,” he said.  The failure to appoint new commissioners with fresh
perspectives has had consequences.  Tripled Spending  The current FEC deadlocked on a plan to review its own
regulations in the wake of the U.S.  Supreme Court  decision in
 Citizens United  versus the  Federal Election Commission  that
helped open the floodgates to political spending. The three
Democrats wanted to look at whether they needed to tighten
disclosure requirements; the Republicans insisted on focusing
only on regulations conflicting with the court ruling  That put the commissioners on the sidelines when spending
by independent groups tripled to $1 billion in 2012, up from
$300 million in 2008, according to the Center for Responsive
Politics, a Washington-based research group that tracks campaign
spending. Most of it financed attack ads; more than three of
every four commercials were negative, according to Kantar
Media’s CMAG, a New York-based firm that tracks ad spending.  Unreported Ads  Many of the groups decided not to report their donors to
the FEC, and some didn’t report their spending as well,
according to CMAG data and FEC reports. An earlier Bloomberg
News review of TV station records in 2010 found groups running
ads close to Election Day without reporting it to the FEC even
though federal law requires it.  While the Senate could block new nominees, that doesn’t
mean Obama should do nothing, said former FEC general counsel
Larry Noble, president of Americans for Campaign Reform, an
advocacy group based in Concord,  New Hampshire .  “There’s a responsibility to nominate people to the
commission,” said Noble. “The power is there, the ability is
there, to at least put up a fight.”  The administration is vetting two candidates and aims to
nominate them when the Senate returns from its Memorial Day
recess, according to a person familiar with the process who
spoke on condition of anonymity because the announcement hasn’t
been made.  Current FEC Chairwoman Ellen Weintraub, whose term expired
in 2007, didn’t return telephone calls seeking comment.  FEC Creation  The FEC was created in 1974 to monitor U.S. elections after
the Watergate scandal that led to the resignation of Republican
President  Richard Nixon . That investigation found secret slush
funds and illegal activities funded by some of the unregulated
private donations to Nixon’s 1972 re-election campaign.  The commission is supposed to enforce election laws and be
the depository for reports filed by candidates, political
parties and outside groups on their spending and fundraising. It
also has the authority to conduct investigations and seek fines
or criminal convictions of those suspected of violating
campaign-finance laws.  Yet, to avoid giving either party a partisan advantage, the
appointment process has become unconventional. The president
traditionally names three commissioners from his party and
allows the Senate leader of the opposing party to nominate the
other three. All must be confirmed by the Senate.  Four Votes  Today, the FEC doesn’t even have a full complement of
commissioners since Democrat Cynthia Bauerly resigned Feb. 1.
Republicans can’t take advantage of that vacancy because the law
requires four votes to take action -- another unique and
partisan-leveling characteristic of the agency.  In the past, commissioners have crossed party lines to
impose penalties on campaigns and groups, including Democratic-
aligned America Coming Together and Republican-friendly Swift
Boat Veterans for Truth, both of which were active in the 2004
presidential race.  Since then, the partisan lines have hardened. In November
2008, the Republican members rejected a previously negotiated
agreement with a U.S. Chamber of Commerce-funded outside group
accused of illegal spending practices during the 2004 elections.  Rove Group  Last year, the commission couldn’t muster four votes to act
against the super-political action committee American
Crossroads, a group aligned with Republican strategist  Karl Rove , for airing footage from a candidate’s commercial in its
own ads, which FEC investigators said was an improper in-kind
donation of $450,000.  “The law has been misinterpreted and ignored by the FEC
over the last several years,” said former FEC Chairman  Trevor Potter , president of the Campaign Legal Center, a Washington-
based advocacy group that supports strengthening campaign
finance laws. “The shameful number of 3-3 partisan deadlocks,
which prevent the commission from doing its job, is a matter of
public record.”  The percentage of proposed enforcement actions blocked by a
split vote has  risen  from less than 1 percent in 2007 to 18.5
percent in 2012, according to  Public Citizen , a Washington-based
advocacy group that backs stronger enforcement.  In addition to promising to strengthen the FEC, Obama told
the Chicago-based Midwest Democracy Network in November 2007
that he would choose commissioners “committed to enforcing our
nation’s election laws.”  One Nominee  Instead, he has offered only one nominee, labor lawyer  John
Sullivan , whose name was withdrawn 15 months later with no
Senate action. He was opposed by Feingold and  Arizona  Republican
Senator  John McCain , who urged the president to submit a full
slate of replacements.  “It’s a disaster, it couldn’t be worse, and this is a
president who campaigned on fixing some of these problems,”
said  Melanie Sloan , executive director of the watchdog group
Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in  Washington .  The FEC’s failure to enforce the law has prompted some
groups to push legal boundaries, knowing there will be no
consequences if they do, Feingold said.  “This is about the core issue, the credibility of our
elections,” Feingold said. “You have people willing to push
the envelope because they know the FEC is a feckless
institution.”  ‘Brazen’ Groups  Craig Holman , who lobbies on campaign finance issues for
Public Citizen, said outside groups “are well aware” that the
FEC will not examine their spending. “The election was swamped
with undisclosed money by increasing brazen nonprofit
organizations,” he said.  Americans for Prosperity, supported by billionaire energy
executives Charles and  David Koch , spent $36 million on the 2012
elections, up from $340,752 in 2008, without disclosing its
donors, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. The
nonprofit arm of Patriot Majority USA spent $7 million to help
elect Democrats, also without identifying the source of the
money; it didn’t exist in 2008.  “We’re in a situation where we do not have the disclosure
that the Supreme Court said in Citizens United that we should
have for the good of the country,” Potter said.  Representative  Chris Van Hollen , a Maryland Democrat, has
sued the FEC, saying the 2002 McCain-Feingold law requires
groups spending money on campaigns to disclose their donors. The
U.S. District Court agreed, though the  U.S. Court of Appeals 
reversed that decision. An appeal in the case was filed by two
outside groups; the FEC couldn’t get four votes to act.  Election lawyer James Bopp Jr., a Republican who has
successfully challenged FEC regulations, said McConnell will use
the filibuster to prevent Obama from picking his own Republican
to replace one of the holdovers.  “Republicans would not permit it,” Bopp said. “That
would be a death struggle. They have plenty of political power
to prevent that from happening.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
