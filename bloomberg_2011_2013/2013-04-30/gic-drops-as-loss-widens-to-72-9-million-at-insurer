MGIC Investment Corp. (MTG) , the mortgage
insurer that raised more than $1 billion in capital this year,
declined in  New York  trading as its first-quarter loss widened.  MGIC fell 1.5 percent to $5.40 at 4:15 p.m.  The net loss ,
swelled to $72.9 million, or 31 cents a share, from $19.6
million, or 10 cents, a year earlier when investment gains
helped cushion claims costs from backing home loans, Milwaukee-
based MGIC said today in a statement. It was the company’s
eleventh straight unprofitable period.  The operating loss, which excludes some investment results,
was 32 cents a share, missing by 18 cents the average estimate
of seven analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Losses have mounted at
mortgage insurers, which pay claims when homeowners default and
foreclosures fail to recoup costs, amid the deepest housing
crash since the Great Depression.  “The company’s financial profile will remain under
pressure,” Standard & Poor’s said in a statement last month.
“Significant risk remains due to potential adverse development
in loss reserves and ongoing losses from new notices of
delinquency.”  MGIC sold stock and convertible notes in March to bolster
capital as investors bet on surviving mortgage insurers while
the government works to limit its role backing home loans. The
insurer has more than doubled this year.  Radian Group Inc. (RDN) , the rival that also raised capital this
year, slipped 0.6 percent to $11.95. Mortgage insurers including
PMI Group Inc. and  Triad Guaranty Inc. (TGIC)  stopped selling new
policies after capital ran short.  To contact the reporter on this story:
