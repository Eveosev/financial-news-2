OAO Rosneft, which acquired oil
venture TNK-BP for $55 billion this year, said first-quarter
profit declined about 14 percent after taxes and financing
expenses rose.  Net income attributable to shareholders dropped to 101
billion rubles ($3.2 billion) from 117 billion rubles in the
first three months of last year, the Moscow-based company said
today in a statement. Rosneft included TNK-BP’s results for the
11 days after the acquisition. A foreign exchange loss and
higher net finance expenses, as well as increases in export and
mineral extraction taxes, caused profit to fall, the state-run
producer said.  Rosneft became the world’s largest publicly traded crude
producer after the takeover of TNK-BP,  Russia ’s third-largest
oil company, boosted its output past PetroChina Co. Average oil
prices declined more than 5 percent in the first quarter from a
year earlier, cutting into earnings, according to the company,
the first of Russia’s oil producers to report results for the
first quarter.  Total output surged 82 percent to 4.8 million barrels of
oil equivalent a day, while crude production rose 73 percent to
4.17 million barrels a day, the company said. Sales climbed to 7
percent to 812 billion rubles.  Net debt surged to 1.78 trillion rubles, according to the
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
