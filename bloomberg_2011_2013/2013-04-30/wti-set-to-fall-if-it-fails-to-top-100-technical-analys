West Texas Intermediate crude may
tumble below $80 a barrel if it fails to breach $100, according
to technical analysis by Piper Jaffray Cos.  The contract is trading above the 10-, 50- and 200-day
moving averages, a signal to buy, said  Craig Johnson , technical
market strategist with the company in  Minneapolis . If crude
fails to settle above $100,  market sentiment  will turn bearish,
he said. WTI last breached that level in September on an
intraday basis and in May 2012 at settlement.  “The bullish technical case for oil will begin to break
down if we can’t recapture $100,” Johnson said in a phone
interview yesterday. “If we fail to close above $100 the market
is set to move lower, perhaps down to the high $70s.”  The 10-day moving average stood at $90.64 yesterday, while
the 50-day was at $92.65 and the 200-day was at $91.85.  The oil market has been trading in a narrowing range for
the past three years, while other markets are reaching new
highs, Johnson said. It’s now in a “dead zone” and gone from
being a leading market to a lagging one, he said.  Crude for June delivery dropped $1.04, or 1.1 percent, to
settle at $93.46 yesterday on the  New York  Mercantile Exchange.
Oil rose 1.6 percent to $94.50 a barrel on April 29, the highest
settlement since April 10.  To contact the reporter on this story:
