Units of companies from brewer
 Carlsberg A/S (CARLB)  to tiremaker Pirelli & C. SpA whose greenhouse-gas
output falls below a European Union minimum are quitting the
European Union’s emissions market.  Polluters emitting less than 25,000 metric tons of carbon
dioxide equivalent a year that participated in the EU trading
system from 2008 through 2012 are boosting sales of unused
permits to close their accounts and avoid paying the registry
fees needed to stay in the program, Milan Hudak, an analyst at
Virtuse Energy sro in  Prague , said without providing details.
Less-intensive emitters can quit the EU system as long as their
governments have separate measures to cut greenhouse-gas output.  Prices in the EU’s emissions market, the world’s largest,
have slumped 57 percent from a year ago as the euro area’s
second recession since 2008 cut demand for allowances. More than
12,000 plants in  Europe  have until today to hand over EU permits
or United Nations carbon offsets matching their emissions in
2012 or pay fines of 100 euros a ton.  “We started to see interest to sell permits from smaller
plants at the end of 2012, though most of it has taken place in
March and April,” Hudak said. “Some are waiting to sell in May
or June, as they think prices may improve.”  A total of 248 out of 1,196 installations in the U.K., or
20 percent of the total that participated in the EU’s emissions
trading system from 2008 to 2012, have withdrawn from the market
this year, according to a March 4  document  posted on the
government’s Department of Energy and Climate Change website.
These include facilities owned by Carlsberg, Pirelli, London’s
Stansted airport and more than 50 hospitals.  The European Commission didn’t respond to e-mail requests
for details of plants opting out in all 27  member states .  Emissions Targets  The EU’s carbon system, started in 2005 to help meet
emission-reduction targets under the  Kyoto Protocol , allocates
tradable allowances every year to factories and utilities that
must be surrendered to cover their emissions. Polluters can buy
emission rights to meet their limit in the market, or sell
allowances they don’t use.  Permits to meet emissions targets in the five years through
2012, known as Phase 2, fell 47 percent this month to 3.27 euros
($4.24) a ton on ICE Futures Europe exchange. The contracts for
prompt delivery were 6.43 euros at the start of the year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
