Emaar Properties PJSC (EMAAR) , Dubai’s
biggest  developer  by market value, said first-quarter earnings
dropped 8 percent, in line with analyst estimates as rising
costs wiped out a 16 percent increase in revenue.  Net income fell to 556 million dirhams ($151 million), or 9
fils a share, from 606 million dirhams, or 10 fils, a year
earlier, the Dubai-based company said in a statement today.
Analysts forecast  earnings  of 557 million dirhams, the median of
five estimates in a Bloomberg survey.  Emaar, builder of the world’s tallest tower in Dubai, is
returning to large projects after the global financial crisis
caused property prices to slump by 65 percent. The developer,
which generates half of its income from hotels and shopping
malls, is selling serviced hotel apartments and expanding the
Dubai Mall, the world’s biggest by area.  The company is planning landmark developments in Dubai and
is expecting revenue from such projects to overtake income from
hotels, malls and office rentals, Chairman Mohammed Alabbar said
at the company’s general annual meeting on April 9.  First-quarter sales climbed to 2.11 billion dirhams from
1.82 billion dirhams, the company said. Recurring revenue,
including rents from assets like hotels and malls, increased 11
percent and accounted for 55 percent of the total, the company
said.  The earnings were published after the close of trading in
Dubai. Emaar has risen 50 percent this year, compared with a 32
percent increase for the  Dubai Financial Market General Index. (DFMGI)   To contact the reporter on this story:
