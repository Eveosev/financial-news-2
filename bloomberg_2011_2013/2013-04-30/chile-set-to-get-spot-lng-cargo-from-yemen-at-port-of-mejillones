Chile  is set to receive a spot
cargo of liquefied natural gas from  Yemen , according to ship-
tracking data.  The Grace Barleria, with a capacity of 146,770 cubic
meters, will arrive May 1 at the port of Mejillones on Chile’s
northern coast, according to ship transmissions captured by IHS
Fairplay on Bloomberg. The tanker sailed from Yemen LNG’s Balhaf
terminal, where it arrived March 12 to load its cargo.  Yemen LNG press officials didn’t respond to an e-mail
seeking comment sent outside normal working hours. A Santiago-
based official from  Gas Natural Licuado Mejillones , the owner
and operator of the terminal, didn’t respond to a call to his
desk phone or an e-mail seeking comment outside normal working
hours.  GNL Mejillones had a three-year contract with France’s  GDF
Suez (GSZ)  for 30 trillion British thermal units per year, or about 10
cargoes, that started in 2010 and ended in 2012, according to a
 presentation  by Frederik Janssens, the company’s chief executive
officer.  An average LNG cargo has approximately 3 trillion British
thermal units. Chile has a contract to import 1.7 million metric
tons of LNG annually at the Quintero terminal on its central
coast from  BG Plc. (BG/)  The agreement started in 2009 and ends in
2030, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
