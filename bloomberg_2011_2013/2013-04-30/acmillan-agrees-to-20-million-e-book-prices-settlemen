Verlagsgruppe Georg von Holtzbrinck
GmbH’s MacMillan unit agreed to pay $20 million to consumers to
settle claims it conspired with  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  and other U.S.
publishers to fix the prices of electronic books.  The agreement resolves both a lawsuit by U.S. states and a
consumer class-action lawsuit, according to an April 25 letter
the  Texas  attorney general sent to U.S. District Judge Denise L. Cote in  Manhattan . MacMillan will also pay $3 million in legal
costs to the states that sued and $2.5 million to the lawyers
for the consumers in the class-action case, according to the
letter.  The settlement follows a February agreement MacMillan
reached with the Justice Department to resolve antitrust
allegations. Other U.S. publishers already reached settlements
with both the Justice Department and with the states. Apple is
still defending the allegations.  The Justice Department and the other states led by Texas
alleged publishers conspired with Apple in 2010 to undermine
discounter  Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) ’s dominance in the e-books market.
MacMillan didn’t admit wrongdoing as part of the settlement,
according to the filing.  Representatives of New York-based MacMillan didn’t
immediately respond after regular business hours to an e-mailed
request seeking comment on the settlement.  The case is In re Electronic Books Antitrust Litigation,
11-md-02293, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
