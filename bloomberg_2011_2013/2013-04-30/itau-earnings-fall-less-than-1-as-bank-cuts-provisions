Itau Unibanco Holding SA,  Latin
America ’s biggest lender by market value, said profit fell less
than 1 percent after it set aside less money for bad loans.  Recurring net income, which excludes one-time charges,
declined to 3.51 billion reais ($1.75 billion), or 78 centavos a
share, from 3.54 billion reais, or 78 centavos, a year earlier,
the Sao Paulo-based bank said today in a regulatory filing. The
results exceeded the 77-centavo  average  estimate of 11 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg.  Itau, led by Chief Executive Officer Roberto Setubal, 58,
said provisions for bad loans dropped as  Brazil ’s consumer
delinquency rates  fell  to the lowest since November 2011. Itau’s
loans overdue more than 90 days reached 4.5 percent in the first
quarter, down from 4.8 percent in December and 5.1 percent a
year earlier.  “Improvements in asset quality and provisions for bad
loans should partially offset” weak loan growth and margin
pressures, Banco Santander SA analysts including Boris Molina
wrote in a report to clients April 19.  Itau declined 1.8 percent this year through yesterday,
while Banco Bradesco SA, Latin America’s second-biggest lender
by market value, lost 0.2 percent.  Itau said bad-loan provisions were 4.94 billion reais in
the first quarter, down from 5.74 billion reais in the three
previous months and 6.21 billion reais a year earlier, according
to the earnings statement. The company’s book of loans expanded
9.2 percent to 456.2 billion reais from a year earlier. That
compares with Itau’s forecast that credit will expand 11 percent
to 14 percent this year. Total assets climbed almost 15 percent
to 1.03 trillion reais.  The bank increased its growth forecast for insurance and
service revenue to 15 percent to 18 percent from 11 percent to
14 percent in February.  To contact the reporter on this story:
