Brazil ’s swap rates fell, adding to
their first monthly decline this year, as a drop in industrial
confidence added to speculation that central bank interest-rate
increases will be limited.  Swap rates on the contract due in January 2015 dropped 26
basis points, or 0.26 percentage point, to 8.23 percent in April
as of 10:04 a.m. in Sao Paulo. They were down one basis point
today. The real appreciated 0.3 percent to 2.0023 per dollar,
extending its monthly gain to 1 percent.  Industrial confidence fell for a second month in April to
104.2 from 105 in March, the Rio de Janeiro-based Getulio Vargas
Foundation said today.  “The swap rate curve should respond to this weaker result
in the industrial confidence index,” Octavio de Barros, the
chief economist at Banco Bradesco SA, wrote in an e-mailed
research note today.  Swap rates plunged earlier this month after the central
bank raised benchmark borrowing costs a quarter percentage
point, less than some analysts had forecast, to 7.5 percent at
an April 17 policy meeting. The increase was the first in two
years and raise the rate from a record-low 7.25 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
