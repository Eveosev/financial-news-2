Pfizer Inc. (PFE)  and other drugmakers
will avoid a reduction in U.S. government payments that was to
be imposed in 2015 by a cost-cutting panel created by President
 Barack Obama ’s Affordable Care Act.  Spending in Medicare, the federal health program for the
elderly and disabled, has been growing so slowly that the
Independent Payment Advisory Board wasn’t triggered for 2015,
the first year it could have acted, the actuary for the Centers
for Medicare and Medicaid Services said today in a memo. The
board was created to propose ways to reduce costs if Medicare
spending exceeds target growth rates.  Republicans and the drug industry have urged a repeal of
the board, and Obama hasn’t yet appointed any of its members. A
spokeswoman for the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of
America, the industry’s Washington-based lobbying group, didn’t
immediately comment on today’s decision.  “Since the Affordable Care Act was enacted, growth in
Medicare per capita spending has slowed significantly, putting
Medicare on a more sustainable path to keep its commitment to
seniors and persons with disabilities today and well into the
future,” Brian Cook, an agency spokesman, said in an e-mail.  Medicare’s  spending  per patient is projected to grow at an
average rate of about 1.15 percent from 2011 to 2015, the
program’s actuary said in a  memo . Spending would have to grow
more than twice as fast, at an average 3.03 percent, for the
payment advisory panel to be triggered.  To contact the reporter on this story:
