Lithuania’s  economy  grew slower
than economists predicted in the first quarter as the
 construction industry  slumped, the statistics office said,
citing a preliminary estimate.  Gross domestic product advanced 3.4 percent from a year
earlier, compared with 4.1 percent in the previous three months,
the  statistics office  in the capital, Vilnius, said today by e-
mail. That’s less than the 3.5 percent median estimate of three
economists in a Bloomberg survey. GDP rose a seasonally adjusted
1.3 percent from the fourth quarter.  Prime Minister Algirdas Butkevicius’s four-party Cabinet
took office in December after elections during which the
eventual coalition members pledged to boost social spending. The
government has a goal of adopting the euro in 2015 and projects
the  budget deficit  will narrow to 2.5 percent of GDP this year,
from 3.2 percent in 2012.  The statistics office is due to release a breakdown of
first-quarter GDP data on May 30.  To contact the reporter on this story:
