Asian  stocks  rose, with the
regional benchmark index heading for the highest close since
June 2008, after U.S. housing sales gained and amid speculation
central banks will keep stimulating growth.  Samsung Electronics Co. (005930) , South Korea’s biggest exporter of
consumer electronics, added 2.6 percent.  Australia & New Zealand
Banking Group Ltd. (ANZ) ,  Australia ’s third-largest lender, jumped 5.8
percent after boosting its dividend as first-half cash profit

fell. The measure has rallied 4.7 percent this month, extending
gains for a sixth month, the longest winning streak since
September 2009.  “There’s plenty of liquidity around the world, and so one
would presume we will continue to see the rally for the next six
to 12 months,” said Khiem Do, Hong Kong-based head of Asian
multi-asset strategy at Baring Asset Management Ltd., which
manages about $51 billion. “In the short-term, some markets
like Japan and the U.S. have been overbought and could
consolidate from day to day. But we are not talking about a
10-15 percent correction.”  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed 8.6 percent this year
through yesterday amid optimism Japan will deploy more measures
to beat deflation and that policy makers in the U.S. and  China 
remain on standby to support growth.  The Asian benchmark traded at 14.1 times estimated earnings
yesterday, compared with 14.5 times for the Standard & Poor’s
500 Index and 13 times for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.  Regional Gauges  Japan’s Topix Index rose 0.3 percent, while South Korea’s

increased 0.7 percent.  Taiwan’s Taiex Index advanced 0.8 percent.  Hong Kong ’s Hang
Seng Index climbed 0.7 percent. Markets in mainland China are
closed for a holiday.  Futures on the  S&P 500 Index (SPX)  slid 0.1 percent today. The
measure rose 0.7 percent to a record yesterday as pending sales
of homes climbed 1.5 percent in March amid optimism central
banks will maintain stimulus plans.  The  European Central Bank  will cut its  benchmark interest
rate  to a record low of 0.5 percent on May 2, according to the
majority of economists in a Bloomberg survey, while the  Federal
Reserve  may consider renewing its commitment to bond-buying at a
two-day meeting starting today.  Exporters Climb  Most exporters advanced. Samsung Electronics gained 2.6

six months ended March 31, according to a stock-exchange filing.
The Melbourne-based lender boosted its interim dividend to 73
Australian cents a share.  Nomura advanced 4.1 percent to 793 yen, pacing gains among
brokerages, after saying fourth-quarter net income more than
tripled to 82.4 billion yen ($840 million) from 22.1 billion yen

estimate of nine analysts.  SBI Holdings Inc., a Japanese brokerage that manages a
venture capital fund, jumped 16 percent to 1,886 yen in Tokyo.
