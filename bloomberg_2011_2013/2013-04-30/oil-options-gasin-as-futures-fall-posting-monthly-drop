Crude oil options volatility
climbed for a second consecutive day as the underlying futures
fell before a report that may show U.S. inventories rose to the
highest level in more than 22 years.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
June, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge
of options prices, was 22.92 percent at 3:10 p.m. on the  New
York Mercantile Exchange , up from 21.68 percent yesterday.  West Texas Intermediate oil for June delivery slipped $1.04
to settle at $93.46 a barrel. A U.S. Energy Information
Administration report may  show  tomorrow that stockpiles of crude
rose by 1.1 million barrels to 389.9 million last week, the most
since July 1990, according to a Bloomberg survey.  The most-active options in electronic trading today were
June $90 puts, which rose 29 cents to 75 cents a barrel at 3:14
p.m. on 3,870 lots. The second-most active were July $70 puts on
volume of 2,802 contracts. They were unchanged at 4 cents a
barrel.  Puts, or bets that crude futures will fall, accounted for
61 percent of electronic trading volume. Bullish bets, or bets
that prices would rise, made up 55 percent of the volume of
156,522 contracts yesterday.  June $98 calls were the most-active options in the previous
session, with 14,007 lots changing hands as they gained 25 cents
to 52 cents a barrel. June $100 calls increased 10 cents to 23
cents a barrel on volume of 7,332 contracts.  Open interest was highest for June $80 puts with 41,055
lots. Next were December $105 calls with 36,188 and December
$110 calls with 35,123.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on open-
outcry volume, where the bulk of options activity occurs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
