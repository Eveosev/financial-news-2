Wheat yields in central  Kansas  were
estimated at 45 bushel an acre after a survey of 12 fields by
analysts, farmers and grain traders participating in an annual
three-day tour of the state’s crop.  A year earlier, the average  yield  was 44 bushels an acre in
the central district of the state and 44.5 bushels in the north-
central region, U.S. Department of Agriculture data showed.
Temperatures in the first 18 days of April in central counties
were the fourth coldest since record keeping began in 1895, and
those in the north-central region were the most frigid ever,
Mary Knapp, a state climatologist, said last week.  “We are seeing fields with freeze damage, but if the crop
gets rain, we can get a decent crop,” Julia Debes, a
spokeswoman at Arlington, Virginia-based  U.S. Wheat Associates ,
said in an interview. “As we travel westward, conditions have
deteriorated quickly.”  About 75 growers, grain traders and industry analysts are
touring the state, the biggest grower of winter wheat in the
U.S., to determine yields for the crop.  On the Kansas City Board of Trade, wheat futures for July
delivery rose 2.3 percent to $7.9375 a bushel at 11:23 a.m.
Earlier, the price reached $7.955, the highest for a most-active
contract since Feb. 15. Through yesterday, the price dropped 6.6
percent this year, partly on speculation that global grain
production will increase.  To contact the reporter on this story:
