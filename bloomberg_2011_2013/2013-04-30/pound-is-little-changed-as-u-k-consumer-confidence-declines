The pound was little changed as a
report showed U.K.  consumer confidence  unexpectedly declined
this month.  Sterling rose to the highest level in more than two months
against the U.S. currency yesterday. A sentiment index published
by GfK NOP Ltd. fell to minus 27 from minus 26 in March, the
London-based group said in a report today. Economists had
forecast no change, according to the median of 19 estimates in a
Bloomberg News survey. The Debt Management Office is scheduled
to sell 500 million pounds ($774 million) of inflation-linked
gilts maturing in 2062 in a so-called mini tender.  The pound traded at $1.5483 at 7:52 a.m. London time, after
strengthening to $1.5546 yesterday, the most since Feb. 15.
Sterling was at 84.47 pence per euro, after appreciating to
83.98 pence on April 26, the strongest since Jan. 24.  The pound has gained 1.4 percent in the past month,
according to Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes that track
10 developed-nation currencies. Sterling is still down 3 percent
this year.  The U.K. last sold the 2062 index-linked securities via
banks on May 29, 2012, at a real yield of 0.040 percent, the
lowest-ever for a 50-year inflation-protected bond, according to
the debt office.  U.K. gilts returned 1.3 percent this month through
yesterday, extending this yearâ€™s gain to 1.9 percent, according
to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European Federation of
Financial Analysts Societies. German bonds gained 1.1 percent in
2013 and U.S. Treasuries earned 0.9 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
