Langham Hospitality Investments, a
trust backed by  Great Eagle Holdings Ltd. (41)  hotels, is seeking as
much as $700 million in an initial public offering in Hong Kong,
two people with knowledge of the matter said.  Langham Hospitality, based in Hong Kong, began gauging
demand for the IPO this week and plans to start trading late
next month, said the people, asking not to be identified because
the information is private. The trust may raise at least $600
million, they said.  The trust will be backed by hotels including The Langham,
Langham Place Hotel and Eaton, all located in Kowloon district,
according to a  pre-listing filing  to the Hong Kong stock
exchange yesterday. The hotels have a combined 1,629 guest
rooms, the document showed.  Citigroup Inc., Deutsche Bank AG and HSBC Holdings Plc are
managing the offering, the people said. An external spokeswoman
for Langham Hospitality declined to comment on the IPO.  Langham Hospitality boosted operating profit by 14.5
percent to HK$504.8 million ($65 million) last year, while
revenue increased 8.9 percent to HK$1.6 billion as occupancy
rates improved, according to the filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
