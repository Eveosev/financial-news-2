Yuan  forwards headed for the
biggest monthly advance since January 2012 on expectations  China 
will allow appreciation to pick up as the currency becomes more
widely used for trade and investment globally.  Global yuan payments increased 32.7 percent in March from
the previous month, the Society for Worldwide Interbank
Financial Telecommunication announced April 25, the same day
Hong Kong Monetary Authority said that the value of trade
settled in China’s currency by the city’s banks rose 45 percent
from a year earlier in the first quarter to 830 billion yuan
($135 billion). Morgan Stanley raised its end-2013 yuan forecast
to 6.1 per dollar from 6.3 yesterday, citing prospects for a
wider trading band and a larger base of market participants.  Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards rose 1.2 percent this
month to 6.23 per dollar as of 11:11 a.m. in  Hong Kong ,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The contracts gained
0.03 percent today and traded at a 1 percent discount to the
closing spot rate in  Shanghai  on April 26. China’s financial
markets are shut for a three-day Labor Day holiday and trading
will resume on May 2.  “The yuan is likely to gain further when its trading band
is widened,” said Patrick Cheng, foreign-exchange analyst at
Haitong International Securities Co. in Hong Kong. “Growing
demand for yuan as an investment and reserve currency will also
support the exchange rate.”  Hong Kong Monetary Authority relaxed yuan capital rules for
local banks last week, a move BNP Paribas Investment Partners
predicts will increase liquidity and offshore lending.
 Australia ’s central bank announced plans this month to put about
5 percent of its foreign-exchange reserves in China.  Trading Band  People’s Bank of China Deputy Governor  Yi Gang  said April
18 that the yuan’s trading band would be widened “in the near
future.” The last revision, which doubled the maximum permitted
divergence from the central bank’s reference rate to 1 percent,
was announced on April 14, 2012. The fixing was set at a record
6.2208 per dollar on April 26, when the currency reached a 19-
year high of 6.1616 in Shanghai.  The onshore spot rate appreciated 0.74 percent this month,
the best performance since October. In Hong Kong’s offshore
market, the currency advanced 0.7 percent, the biggest gain in
six months. It’s steady today, after earlier touching a record
6.1592.  One-month implied volatility in the onshore yuan, a measure
of  exchange-rate  swings used to price options, climbed 20 basis
points, or 0.2 percentage point, to 1.41 percent this month. It
is poised for the first monthly increase of 2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
