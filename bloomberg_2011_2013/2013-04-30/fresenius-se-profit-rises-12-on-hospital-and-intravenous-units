Fresenius SE said first-quarter
profit climbed 12 percent, boosted by the performance of two
units that manage hospitals and sell intravenous therapies.  Net income adjusted for some items rose to 224 million
euros ($293 million), the  Bad Homburg , Germany-based company
said in a statement today. The company reiterated a February
forecast for 2013 profit to exceed 1 billion euros. Sales will
rise 7 percent to 10 percent this year in constant currencies,
while adjusted net income is set to increase 7 percent to 12
percent, Fresenius repeated.  Sales rose 11 percent to 4.89 billion euros, compared with
the 4.91 billion-euro average  estimate  of eight analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg. The German health company’s Kabi unit
sells therapies and drugs administered intravenously to hospital
patients. Fresenius also owns the Helios hospital operator and
health-care services unit Vamed.  Fresenius also owns about 30 percent of Fresenius Medical
Care AG, the world’s biggest provider of  kidney dialysis .
Fresenius Medical Care’s adjusted first-quarter profit fell 8
percent to $225 million, missing the $262 million-euro average
estimate of nine analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  This year sales will probably exceed $14.6 billion, while
net income will be $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion, the dialysis
company said, repeating a forecast from February.  To contact the reporter on this story:
