BRF SA (BRFS3) , the world’s largest poultry
exporter, said first-quarter profit more than doubled, beating
 analysts’  forecasts after it increased prices and boosted
exports.  Net income  rose to 358.5 million reais ($179 million), or
41 centavos a share, from 153.2 million reais, or 18 centavos, a
year earlier, the Sao Paulo-based company said in a regulatory
filing yesterday. The result topped a 277.9 million-real average
of ten analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  BRF, Brazil’s biggest maker of TV dinners, frozen pizzas
and other processed-food products, has been able to pass cost
increases through to customers in both the domestic and export
markets, Banco Santander SA analysts led by  Luis Miranda , who
rates the stock a buy, said in a note to clients today.  Sales rose 14 percent from a year earlier to 7.21 billion
reais after BRF increased prices 13 percent on average in the
quarter. Exports revenue jumped 30 percent to 3.14 billion
reais.  To contact the reporter on this story:
