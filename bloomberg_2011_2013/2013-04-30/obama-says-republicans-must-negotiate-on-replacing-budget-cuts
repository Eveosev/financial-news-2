President  Barack Obama  said
Congress has focused on short-term solutions to the budget
standoff when it must instead negotiate with him on a “bigger
deal” to lower the deficit and help spur economic expansion  Obama, speaking at a White House news conference, said the
automatic budget cuts that started taking effect March 1 are
damaging to the economy and hurting U.S. citizens. He said that
while there is “a genuine desire” among some lawmakers to
reach an agreement, others are letting politics stand in the
way.  “I cannot force Republicans to embrace those common sense
solutions,” Obama said at the news conference which marked 100
days since he was inaugurated for a second term.  Lawmakers were
elected “to do what’s right for their constituents and the
American people.” Instead, he said, Congress has become
“pretty dysfunctional,” he said.  The administration and congressional Republicans have been
locked in a two-year stalemate over the nation’s finances that
has hindered efforts to spur the economy after the worst
recession in seven decades. A so-called grand bargain to curb
the long-term deficit has proved elusive, with Democrats
resisting cuts to Medicare and Social Security, and Republicans
opposing tax increases.  Obama cited quick congressional action to let the Federal
Aviation Administration work around across-the-board spending
cuts to end days of flight delays stemming from air-traffic
controller furloughs as an example the short-term actions that
lawmakers have been taking.  To contact the reporter on this story:
