Russian stocks, down for a third month
in New York, will extend declines as the slowest economic growth
since 2009 curbs investors’ appetite for the country’s equities,
according to Otkritie Financial Corp. and UralSib Financial
Corp.  The Bloomberg Russia-US Equity Index gained 1.1 percent in
New York yesterday, trimming the drop in April to 3.2 percent.
The gauge of the most-traded Russian companies in the U.S. has
lost 11 percent during the past three months.  Futures (VEA)  on
Moscow’s dollar-denominated RTS Index rose 0.2 percent to
137,450 in U.S. hours yesterday.  Russia ’s economy  expanded  2.1 percent in the fourth
quarter, the least since a 2009 recession, while  inflation 
almost doubled to 7 percent in the past 12 months. American
depositary receipts of Mechel led declines among U.S.-traded
Russian stocks in April, tumbling 19 percent, while  OAO RusHydro (RSHYY) 
slid 11 percent. State-backed oil producer OAO Rosneft’s
treatment of minority shareholders is also deterring investment,
according to Moscow-based Otkritie.  “There is an overall negative mood toward the Russian
market, as the economy is slowing while inflation remains
high,” Slava Smolyaninov, chief strategist at Moscow-based
brokerage UralSib, said in a phone interview yesterday. “That
negative perception toward Russia will continue until it manages
to stabilize economic growth and demand for commodities improves
globally.”  ETF Gains  The  Market Vectors Russia ETF (RSX) , the largest dedicated
Russian exchange-traded fund, increased 1.4 percent to $26.74
yesterday, trimming its monthly drop to 3.6 percent. The gauge
fell for a third month. The RTS Volatility Index, which measures
expected swings in the stock futures, increased 1.7 percent to
21.09 points.  The  Micex Index (INDEXCF)  gained 1.7 percent to 1,385.88 in Moscow
yesterday, paring its April decline to 3.7 percent. The gauge
lost 10 percent since the end of January. Russian markets are
closed for holidays today.  Policy makers cut Russia’s growth forecast to 2.4 percent
this year, compared with 3.6 percent expected earlier. Russia is
probably already in a recession and monetary policy should be
eased to ignite growth, Ksenia Yudaeva, President Vladimir
Putin’s representative to the Group of 20 nations, said in an
April 16 interview in New York.  Commodities made up more than 80 percent of Russia’s export
revenue in 2011, according to government data, while oil and
natural gas account for about 50 percent of the nation’s budget
revenue.  The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Index of 24 raw materials fell
0.9 percent to 624.44 yesterday, widening its drop last month to
4.7 percent, the steepest decline since May 2012.  Mechel Retreats  OAO Mechel (MTL) , Russia’s biggest producer of steelmaking coal,
slipped 0.5 percent to $4.08 yesterday. The Moscow-based company
has fallen a fourth month, its longest stretch of retreats since
the five months to January 2009.  OAO RusHydro gained 4.3 percent to $1.70 yesterday, the
highest level since April 5. The nation’s largest renewable
energy producer has plunged 33 percent since the end of January.  Yandex NV (YNDX) , the biggest Internet company in Russia, fell
less than 0.1 percent to $25.74 yesterday, trimming its advance
last month to 11 percent. Yandex, based in The Hague, was the
biggest gainer on the Bloomberg Russia-US gauge last month.  “Mistreated” Shareholders  Rosneft, the world’s largest publicly traded crude
producer, closed its $55 billion takeover of  BP Plc (BP/) ’s TNK-BP
Russian unit on March 21, sending shares of TNK’s traded unit,
OAO  TNK-BP Holding (TNBP) , to a record low on March 26 after announcing
plans to borrow money from the company.  “Investors are selling because of the way they are being
treated by Russia’s major companies,” Vladimir Tikhomirov,
chief economist at Otkritie Financial Corp, said by phone from
Moscow yesterday. “When such a heavyweight as Rosneft mistreats
its minority shareholders, it has a huge impact on the
investment climate in the country.”  Futures expiring in June on Russia’s ruble showed the
currency gaining 0.4 percent to 31.93 per dollar, after falling
0.6 percent to 31.1210 in Moscow yesterday. The currency
declined 0.9 percent to 35.5441 against the dollar-euro basket
used by the central bank.  Crude for June delivery decreased 1.1 percent to $93.46 a
barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange yesterday, widening
its monthly drop to 3.9 percent and falling for a second time in
three months. Brent oil for June settlement declined 1.4 percent
to $102.37 a barrel on  London ’s ICE Futures Europe exchange,
losing 7 percent last month, the biggest drop since May 2012.
Urals crude, Russia’s major export blend, decreased 1.3 percent
to $101.02, widening its drop last month to 6.1 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
