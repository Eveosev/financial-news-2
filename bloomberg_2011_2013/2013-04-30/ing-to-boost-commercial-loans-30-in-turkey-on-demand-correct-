(Corrects GDP growth figure in third paragraph.)  ING Bank AS, the Turkish unit of
Amsterdam-based  ING Groep NV (INGA) , is seeking to boost commercial
loans by 30 percent this year and personal loans by 50 percent
as demand increases from mid-tier companies and consumers.  “Small-and-medium-sized businesses are the driving factor
behind Turkey’s economic growth,” Erdogan Yilmaz, the Turkish
bank’s executive vice president for cash management and trade
finance, said in an interview. “It’s a very important area of
competition for Turkish banks and will be our focus in 2013.”  Turkish banks’ loans climbed 19.5 percent in the year to
April 12, with credit to small and medium sized businesses
rising by 21 percent on an annual basis in 2012, according to
 banking regulator data . The Turkish economy expanded 2.2 percent
last year, and will probably grow 4 percent this year, according
to the average estimate of 30 economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  ING  Turkey ’s deposits rose 24 percent in 2012, above the
industry average of 12 percent. Depositors increased by 600,000
after the lender started a fixed-term deposit account in Jan.
2011 that provides flexibility on withdrawals.  The bank’s profits tripled on an annual basis to 260
million liras ($145 million) last year, while assets grew 16.8
percent to 27 billion liras. ING Turkey is targeting deposit
growth of 26 percent in 2013 amid rising competition, Yilmaz
said.  “There are almost no new deposits being created in Turkey,
with the low savings rate,” Yilmaz said in Istanbul. “Banks
are fighting to steal customers from each other.”  Turkey’s gross national savings dropped to 12 percent of
gross domestic product last year, according to  International
Monetary Fund data . That compares with 29 percent for  Russia , 16
percent for  Poland  and 20 percent for  Hungary , IMF data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
