Constellation Brands Inc. (STZ)  is
planning to sell $1.55 billion of debt in two parts to help fund
its path to becoming the sole U.S. importer of Corona beer.  The Victor, New York-based company intends to issue senior
notes due 2021 and 2023, the firm said in a regulatory filing
today. Proceeds will be used to help finance Constellation’s
purchase of the remaining 50 percent stake in Crown Imports LLC,
a joint venture with Grupo Modelo SAB that imports brands
including Corona Extra, Negra Modelo and Pacifico, as well as
Modelo’s Piedras Negras brewery, the filing said.  Constellation last sold bonds in August, issuing $650
million of 4.625 percent securities due March 2023 to yield 309
basis points more than similar-maturity Treasuries, Bloomberg
data show. The bonds were called at par on Feb. 20, the day
 Anheuser-Busch InBev NV (ABI)  and the U.S. said they were in talks to
resolve the Justice Department’s lawsuit to block AB InBev’s
planned $20.1 billion purchase of Grupo Modelo.  The resolution allows Constellation to  buy  the import
rights to Grupo Modelo brands that it doesn’t already own and
the brewery in  Mexico  for $4.75 billion.  Bank of America Corp., JPMorgan Chase & Co., Rabobank
International, Barclays Plc and Wells Fargo & Co. are managing
the sale, the filing said. Pricing of the deal may come as soon
as today, according to a person familiar with the offering who
asked not to be identified because terms aren’t set.  To contact the reporter on this story:
