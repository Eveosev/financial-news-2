U.S. stocks extended losses as
business activity unexpectedly shrank in April for the first
time in more than three years, offsetting a rise in confidence
among American consumers.  The  S&P 500  dropped 0.4 percent to 1,587.59 at 10:05 a.m.
in New York.  The MNI Chicago Report’s business barometer fell to 49 in
April, the lowest since September 2009, from 52.4 last month. A
reading less than 50 signals contraction. The median forecast of
51 economists surveyed by Bloomberg was 52.5.  Manufacturing, which makes up about 12 percent of the
economy, is starting to cool in the wake of across-the-board
cutbacks in federal  government spending  that went into effect in
March.  Confidence among U.S. consumers climbed more than forecast
in April to a five-month high as Americans’ outlook for the
economy and their incomes improved, a separate report showed.  The Conference Board’s index rose to 68.1, exceeding the
highest projection in a Bloomberg survey, from a revised 61.9 in
March, data from the New York-based private research group
showed today. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg forecast an
increase to 61.  The S&P 500 rose 0.7 percent to a record high of 1,593.61
yesterday and is heading for a sixth monthly advance, the
longest streak of gains since September 2009. The  bull market  in
U.S. equities entered its fifth year last month. The equity
gauge has surged 135 percent from a 12-year low in 2009, driven
by better-than-estimated corporate earnings and three rounds of
bond purchases by the  Federal Reserve .  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
