South Africa, the continent’s
biggest producer of corn, exported 27 percent less this season
compared with a year earlier, when shipments were the highest in
at least nine years.  The nation shipped 1.79 million metric tons of corn in the
year through April 26, compared with 2.46 million tons a year
earlier, preliminary figures published on the Pretoria-based
South African Grain Information Service’s website show. White-
corn shipments declined 19 percent to 1.4 million tons, while
exports of the yellow variety fell 45 percent to 392,095 tons,
it said.  Farmers found buyers in markets including  Italy , South
Korea,  Kuwait ,  Taiwan  and Spain in 2011 after a year earlier
producing the biggest crop since 1982, depressing prices and
making South African corn attractive to overseas markets. The
country last year set up a committee that will start collating
data on intended shipments to help prevent price swings and
excessive exports that could threaten local food supply.  South Africa imported 10,562 tons of the white variety
compared 133,771 tons a year earlier. The country brought in no
yellow corn, used as animal feed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
