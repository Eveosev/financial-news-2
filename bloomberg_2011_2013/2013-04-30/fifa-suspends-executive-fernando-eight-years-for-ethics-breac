FIFA, soccer’s governing body,
suspended executive committee member Vernon Manilal Fernando of
 Sri Lanka  eight years for breaching its ethics code  The ban is effective from March 11, 2013, when Fernando was
provisionally banned for 90 days as part of an ethics
investigation.  FIFA didn’t give details of the breach which led to the
suspension, which was handed down following two days of hearings
at its headquarters in Zurich. Fernando, who joined the
executive committee in 2001, is banned from taking part in any
soccer-related activities at the national and international
levels, FIFA said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
