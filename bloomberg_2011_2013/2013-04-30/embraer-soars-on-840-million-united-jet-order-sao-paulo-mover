Embraer SA (EMBR3)  rallied the most among
the world’s largest  airplane manufacturers  after saying it will
sell 30 regional jets for about $840 million to  United
Continental Holdings Inc. (UAL)   Shares gained 5.9 percent to 17.39 reais at 11:54 a.m. in
 Sao Paulo , the steepest advance in three months. It was the best
performance on the Brazilian benchmark stock index Ibovespa,
which rose 0.5 percent.  Today’s advance pared the  Sao Jose dos Campos , Brazil-based
planemaker’s decline this month to 3.2 percent. The stock has
fallen amid concern that revenue will trail projections this
year after it reported that first-quarter deliveries fell to to
29 planes from 34 one year earlier. Citigroup Inc. cut its
recommendation on the stock to sell from the equivalent of hold
on April 26.  Deliveries of the 76-seat E-175 jets for United will begin
in 2014, and existing 50-seat aircraft will be replaced,
according to the Chicago-based airline. Embraer said yesterday
that the carrier has options for 40 more planes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
