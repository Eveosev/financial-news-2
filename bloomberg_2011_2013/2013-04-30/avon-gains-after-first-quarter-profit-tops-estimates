Avon Products Inc. (AVP)  rose to the
highest price in a year after first-quarter profit topped
analysts’ estimates as Chief Executive Officer Sheri McCoy’s
cost-reduction plan starts to produce results.  The door-to-door cosmetics seller’s shares  advanced  4.1
percent to $23.16 at the close in  New York  for the highest
closing price since April 2012. The shares have jumped 61
percent this year, the third-best performance in the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index.  McCoy has been cutting jobs and exiting markets including
Ireland and  Vietnam  as part of a plan to save $400 million by
2016. Avon also is reviewing operations in smaller,
underperforming markets to be restructured or closed and is
evaluating alternatives for the Silpada jewelry unit.  The first-quarter net loss was $13.7 million, or 3 cents a
share, compared with profit of $26.5 million, or 6 cents, a year
earlier, the New York-based company said today in a statement.
Profit excluding costs related to the devaluation of the
Venezuelan currency and restructuring charges totaled 26 cents a
share. Analysts  projected  14 cents, on average.  “While considerable work remains to be done, the
turnaround is on track as steps new management is taking to
improve performance are working,”  Mark Astrachan , an analyst at
Stifel Financial Corp. in New York, wrote in a note today. He
recommends buying the shares.  Adjusted gross margin, which excludes the effect of the
Venezuelan devaluation, was 62.5 percent, an increase of 1.6
percent from a year earlier, helped by lower freight and
material costs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
