The  Dollar Index  fell to a two-month
low amid speculation the  Federal Reserve  will announce after a
two-day policy meeting that it will maintain its bond purchases
to spur economic growth.  The gauge fell for a fifth day, the longest stretch this
year, as ADP Research Institute said America’s private employers
added fewer jobs than forecast. The Fed buys $85 billion of
bonds a month under its quantitative-easing strategy to put
downward pressure on borrowing costs. The pound rose after  U.K.
manufacturing (PMITMUK)  shrank less than estimated in April.  Australia ’s
dollar slid after  China ’s  manufacturing  growth slowed.  “The dollar weakness is just positioning ahead of the Fed
numbers,” Melinda Burgess, a currency strategist at Royal Bank
of Scotland Group Plc in  London , said in a telephone interview.
“You had the ADP report as well, which came in below
expectations, which may be having an impact on the dollar. The
market is shifting their expectations around Fed policies, given
the disappointments we’ve seen in U.S. data lately.”  The  Dollar Index (DXY) , which Intercontinental Exchange Inc. uses
to track the greenback against the currencies of six U.S.
trading partners, fell 0.2 percent to 81.556 at 12:44 p.m. in
 New York . It reached 81.331, the lowest since Feb. 25.  The greenback declined 0.2 percent to $1.3196 per euro and
touched $1.3243, the weakest level since Feb. 25. The U.S.
currency fell 0.2 percent to 97.26 yen. The euro was little
changed at 128.31 yen after falling 0.4 percent earlier.  Losses Pared  The dollar pared losses versus the euro after the  Institute
for Supply Management ’s manufacturing  index  fell to 50.7 in
April, from March’s 51.3. A Bloomberg survey forecast 50.5. A
reading of 50 is the line between expansion and contraction.  Trading in over-the-counter foreign-exchange options
totaled $15 billion, compared with $24 billion yesterday,
according to data reported by U.S. banks to the Depository Trust
Clearing Corp. and tracked by Bloomberg. Volume in options on
the dollar-yen  exchange rate  amounted to $3.1 billion, the
largest share of trades at 20 percent. Euro-dollar options were
the second most actively traded, at $2.5 billion, or 17 percent.  Dollar-yen options trading was 70 percent below the average
for the past five Wednesdays at a similar time in the day, and
euro-dollar options trading was 57 percent below, according to
Bloomberg analysis.  Aussie Drops  Australia’s dollar slid against the majority of its 16
most-traded peers after a Chinese government report showed a
manufacturing purchasing-managers index declined to 50.6 in
April from 50.9 the previous month. China is Australia’s largest
trading partner.  The Aussie dropped 0.8 percent to $1.0285 after rising
yesterday to $1.0385, the highest level since April 17.  The  Mexican peso  declined versus most major peers amid
speculation the country’s central bank will cut borrowing costs.
Governor Agustin Carstens said April 29 policy makers would
consider lowering rates for a second time this year if the
annual inflation rate fell below 4 percent.  The peso weakened 0.8 percent to 12.2339 per dollar.  The  Federal Open Market Committee  will release a statement
at 2 p.m. after its meeting ends in  Washington . None of the 47
economists in the Bloomberg News survey taken April 25-29
forecast a decision today to change the pace of purchases.  ‘Selling Pressure’  “Into the Fed meeting, I think that we’re going to see
further U.S. dollar selling pressure,” said  Hans-Guenter Redeker , head of global foreign-exchange strategy at Morgan
Stanley in London. “The Fed is going to signal that it’s going
to stay accommodative, that it’s going to reconfirm the link
between unlimited quantitative easing and the state of the
economy.”  The U.S. currency may decline below 94 yen within the next
three weeks, Redeker said.  American companies added 119,000 workers to payrolls last
month, figures from Roseland, New Jersey-based ADP showed today.
The median forecast of 37 economists surveyed by Bloomberg
projected an advance of 150,000.  U.S. nonfarm payrolls increased by 145,000 workers last
month after gaining 88,000 in March, a Bloomberg survey showed
before the Labor Department reports the data May 3.  The dollar weakened 1 percent in the past month, according
to Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes that track 10
developed-market currencies. The euro gained 1.9 percent, the
best performance, and the yen tumbled 5.6 percent.  Markets in the U.K.,  Denmark  and Ireland were open today,
while most others in  Europe  and  Asia  were closed for holidays.  Sterling Gains  The pound strengthened to an 11-week high versus the dollar
as U.K. manufacturing data weakened the case for more central-
bank stimulus that debases the currency.  The gauge of factory output climbed to 49.8 from a revised
48.6 in March, Markit and the  Chartered Institute of Purchasing
and Supply  said in London. Economists forecast a reading of
48.5, according to a Bloomberg survey.  The pound climbed to as high as $1.5596, the strongest
level since Feb. 13, before trading at $1.5579, up 0.3 percent.
The U.K. currency rose 0.1 percent to 84.68 pence per euro.  Europe’s shared currency rose versus most major peers even
as economists forecast the  European Central Bank  will cut its
main refinancing rate to a record-low 0.5 percent when policy
makers meet tomorrow.  “The ECB risks are biased to further euro upside as any
non-conventional easing in addition to the refi rate cut is
likely to be more positive than negative for the euro,” BNP
Paribas SA strategists Kiran Kowshik and Jasmine Poh wrote today
in a note to clients.  The strategists recommend buying the euro with a target of
$1.34. The currency last traded at that level on Feb. 20.  To contact the reporter on this story:
