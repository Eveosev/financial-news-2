Noble Group Ltd. (NOBL) , Asia’s biggest
commodity trader by sales, hired former Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
metals trader Scott Evans, according to two people with direct
knowledge.  Evans will be based in Stamford, Connecticut, said the
people, who asked not to be identified because the information
hasn’t been announced.  Stephen Brown , director of corporate affairs at Hong Kong-
based Noble, didn’t immediately respond to an e-mail seeking
comment.  Noble hired David Freeland, previously a copper trader at
Goldman in London, two people said last month. Noble’s physical
and derivatives metals trading are managed by Mark Hansen, who
joined in June.  To contact the reporter on this story:
