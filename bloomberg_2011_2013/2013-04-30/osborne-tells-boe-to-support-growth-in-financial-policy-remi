Chancellor of the Exchequer  George Osborne  told the  Bank of England  that its financial-stability
policies should take into account the weakness of the economy
and refrain from curbing the recovery.  Setting the Financial Policy Committee’s first remit,
Osborne said the central bank must acknowledge the economic
cycle when setting policy. He also said there is a need for
“clear” communications to win the confidence of financial
markets and called for a list of risks by the end of the year.  “Even if individual firms are believed to be sound, when
their activities are considered in aggregate, risks to the whole
system can emerge,” Osborne said in a  statement  released by his
office in London today. “The Financial Policy Committee is now
charged with identifying, monitoring and addressing risks to the
financial system as a whole.”  Osborne shut the previous financial regulator and gave most
of its powers to the BOE to overhaul regulation which, he says,
failed in part because the structure wasn’t adequate. Under the
new Financial Services Act, Osborne has the power to set the
FPC’s objectives and how it should operate in order to support
the government’s economic policies.  “The remit and recommendations for the committee
recognizes that there may be short-term tradeoffs between the
committee’s second objective of contributing toward sustaining
economic growth and its primary objective of addressing sources
of systemic risk, which may vary at different points in the
economic and credit cycle,” Osborne said. “It is particularly
important at this stage of the cycle that the committee takes
into account, and gives due weight to, the impact of its action
on the near-term economic recovery.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
