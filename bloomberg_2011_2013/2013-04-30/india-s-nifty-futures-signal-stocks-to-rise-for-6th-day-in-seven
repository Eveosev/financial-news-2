Indian (SENSEX)  equities advanced for the
sixth time in seven days, with the benchmark index poised for
the biggest month gain since November.  Hindustan Unilever Ltd. (HUVR) 
surged after its parent planned to raise stake in the company.  The S&P BSE Sensex increased 0.8 percent to 19,533.76 at
10:01 a.m. in Mumbai. Hindustan Unilever jumped as much as 20
percent after the world’s second-largest consumer goods company
said it will spend up to 292.2 billion rupees ($5.4 billion) to
boost its stake in its Indian unit to 75 percent. Copper maker
 Sterlite Industries (India) Ltd. (STLT)  added 2.5 percent after
reporting profit that exceeded estimates.  The Sensex has risen 3.8 percent this month, heading for
its first monthly gain since January. The gauge has rebounded
7.3 percent from a seven-month low on April 9 as data showing
wholesale-price inflation slowed and a decline in gold and oil
prices stoked speculation the central bank will cut borrowing
costs this week.  Profit at just one of the 11 Sensex companies that have
reported March-quarter results has  trailed  analyst estimates.
Net income at about 43 percent of the 30 index firms trailed
forecasts in the three months ended Dec. 31, compared with 40
percent in the previous two quarters.  The RBI may lower its key rate by 25 basis points at its
May 3 review, according to the median of a Bloomberg economist
survey. The slump in gold and oil prices eased concerns about
the prices of two commodities that fueled  India ’s record $32.6
billion current-account deficit in the last quarter of 2012,
government data show.  Foreign funds bought a net $56 million of local shares on
April 26, taking their net investment in stocks this year to $11
billion, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Inflows last year were
$24.5 billion, the most among 10 Asian markets tracked by
Bloomberg, the data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
