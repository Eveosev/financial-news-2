Portugal’s (PTGDPQOQ)  government reiterated its
forecast for the economy to return to growth in 2014 after a
three-year recession and said it would focus on cutting
spending.  “Financial restriction is of central importance since an
additional tax increase would be counterproductive for the
Portuguese economy,” the government said in its  Budget Strategy
Plan  for 2013 to 2017 submitted to parliament yesterday.  The government maintained its predictions of a 2.3 percent
economic contraction in 2013 and a 0.6 percent expansion in
2014. It also repeated its goals of a budget deficit equivalent
to 5.5 percent of gross domestic product in 2013, 4 percent in
2014 and below the European Union’s 3 percent limit in 2015,
when it aims for a 2.5 percent gap.  The announcement took place as Prime Minister  Pedro Passos Coelho  struggles to find alternative measures to meet these
targets, which are set in its 78 billion-euro ($103 billion)
international aid program, after the country’s Constitutional
Court on April 5 blocked a plan to suspend some payouts to state
workers and pensioners. Those payments represented 1.3 billion
euros of savings in 2013, or about 0.8 percent of the country’s
gross domestic product of 164 billion euros.  The alternative measures will allow Portugal to complete
the seventh review of its bailout plan by the EU, European
Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund and secure an
extension of rescue loans that was agreed upon in principle by
EU finance ministers on April 12.  Budget Impact  The government is also preparing measures “with an impact
on the budget” equivalent to 1.7 percent of GDP in 2014, or
about 2.8 billion euros, 0.4 percent of GDP in 2015, or about
700 million euros, and 0.7 percent of GDP in 2016, or about 1.2
billion euros, according to the Budget Strategy Plan.  “Only then will it be possible to reduce the levels of
public debt to the limits agreed at the European level,”
according to the document. “This is a task that will last a
generation.”  The extension of the maturities of  Portugal ’s aid loans and
a drop in bond yields in the secondary market to the lowest
levels since 2010 “opens the way” for the country to issue 10-
year bonds, according to the document. The plan did not provide
details on when Portugal plans to carry out the sale.  To contact the reporter on this story:
