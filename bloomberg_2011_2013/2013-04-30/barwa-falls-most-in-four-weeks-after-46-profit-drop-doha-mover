Barwa Real Estate Co. fell the most
in four weeks after Qatar’s biggest publicly traded property
developer by assets said quarterly profit decreased 46 percent.  The  shares  retreated 3.4 percent, the most since April 3,
to 23.55 riyals at the close in Doha, bringing the drop this
month to 5.2 percent. The stock was the  biggest decliner  on the
benchmark QE Index, which increased 0.6 percent.  Barwa’s first-quarter net income fell to 158.5 million
riyals ($43.5 million) from 292.5 million riyals a year earlier,
the company said in a  release  on the Qatar Exchange website. The
decline came as losses from discontinued operations rose to
196.5 million riyals from 4.5 million riyals. Profit from
continuing operations gained 16 percent to 355 million riyals.  Investors “are reacting to the drop in the headline
income,” Bobby Sarkar, head of research at Qatar National Bank
Financial Services, said by phone. “The drop is because of
losses from discontinued operations. If you look at income from
continued operations, that’s actually up.”  Barwa, which counts government-owned Qatar Diar Real Estate
Investment Co. as its biggest shareholder, has faced sluggish
demand since the 2008 financial crisis created a glut of
properties. The price of rent and utilities began rising in
October after more than a year of declines, according to the
 Qatar Statistics Authority .  Barwa, which said yesterday it will open its Commercial
Avenue development next quarter, reported a 3.9 percent drop in
first-quarter revenue to 625.2 million riyals, according to its
financial statement. Total assets fell to 44.4 billion riyals
from 50.2 billion riyals a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
