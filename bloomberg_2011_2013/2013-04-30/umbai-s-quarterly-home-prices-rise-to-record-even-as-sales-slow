Home  prices  in  Mumbai ,  India ’s most
expensive real estate market, rose to a record last quarter even
as sales slowed, according to Liases Foras Real Estate Rating &
Research Pvt.  Prices in Mumbai increased 2.9 percent to 11,626 rupees
($215) a square foot in the three months to March 31, the data
showed, while sales climbed 1 percent, from 5.7 percent in the
December quarter, to 10.45 million square feet. Total housing
stock in the city advanced to a record 150 million square feet
as of March 31, the property research company said.  “Price increases were persistent across cities,”  Pankaj
Kapoor , founder of Liases Foras, said in a telephone interview
from Mumbai yesterday. “The decline in Mumbai prices in the
December quarter, which hinted towards a further correction,
could not be sustained.” Mumbai prices slid 1 percent in the
December quarter.  The  Reserve Bank  of India cut funding costs in March for a
second time this year to 7.5 percent. The central bank, which is
scheduled to meet on May 3, has said lingering inflation reduces
the scope for further cuts.  Unsold homes in Mumbai rose 3.7 percent to 139.33 million
square feet, while in Delhi and areas surrounding the capital
city they increased 0.1 percent to 262.67 million square feet,
the data showed.  Three of six cities Liases Foras tracks posted a decline in
sales in the March quarter from the previous three months. The
southern city of Hyderabad posted the  largest  drop at 46 percent
as prices climbed 3.5 percent, while Bangalore, also in the
south, had the second-biggest sales decline, according to the
data. Prices in Bangalore rose 6.4 percent to a record 5,004
rupees a square foot, it showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
