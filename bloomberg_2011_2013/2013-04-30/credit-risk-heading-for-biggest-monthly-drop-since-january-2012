The cost of insuring against losses
on corporate and financial debt is heading for its biggest
monthly fall since January 2012.  The Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of credit-default swaps
on 50 companies with high-yield credit ratings declined to a
two-year low of 397.5 basis points from 486 at the end of last
month.  NXP Semiconductor NV (NXPI)  and  TUI Travel Plc (TT/)  were among
companies whose contracts fell to the lowest since before the
start of the financial crisis in 2007.  Bond risk has been declining since the ECB pledged to do
whatever it takes to protect the euro last July and economists
forecast the  European Central Bank  will cut its benchmark rate
to 0.50 percent on Thursday from 0.75 percent. Stocks around the
world also rose to the highest in almost five years as  Spain ’s
economic slump eased and euro-area inflation slowed.  “There seems to be a fair amount of indiscriminate buying
in a desperation to get invested -- it’s insatiable,” said
Simon Ballard, a senior credit strategist at National Australia
Bank in  London . “People are looking at the corporate space as
the new risk-free asset.”  Swaps on Eindhoven, Netherlands-based NXP fell for a sixth
day, falling two basis points to 282, the lowest since February
2007. TUI in Hannover dropped as much as 18 basis points today
to 315, the lowest since July 2007.  Europe Gauge  The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of credit-default swaps
linked to 125 companies with investment-grade ratings dropped to
a two-year low of 99 basis points from 126 on March 29. A
decrease signals improvement in perceptions of  credit quality ;
an increase, the opposite. That measure was one basis point
lower today, while the high-yield index was down nine.  The Markit iTraxx Financial Index linked to senior debt of
25 banks and insurers fell seven basis points today to 146, and
was 194 at the end of last month. The subordinated index
declined nine basis points to 235.5, compared with 312 last
month. Both are poised for the first monthly slide since
January.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($13.1 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer
face value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
