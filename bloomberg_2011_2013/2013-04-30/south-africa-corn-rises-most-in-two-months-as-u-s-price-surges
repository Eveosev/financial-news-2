South African corn futures rose the
most in more than two months after U.S. prices gained as a
government report showed cold and wet weather slowed planting.  White corn for delivery in July, the most active contract,
jumped 3.7 percent, or the limit of 80 rand ($9), to 2,231 rand
a metric ton by the close on the South African Futures Exchange
in Johannesburg. That was the biggest increase since Feb. 27.
The yellow variety for delivery in the same month also rose by
the limit, advancing 3.8 percent to 2,212 rand a ton.  Corn surged 6.5 percent in  Chicago  yesterday after the  U.S.
Department of Agriculture  said farmers  planted  5 percent of corn
as of April 28, trailing the five-year average pace of 31
percent and the slowest start to the season since 1984. Rain
will redevelop from about midweek in the Midwest, with heavy
downpours possible in  Illinois , forecaster DTN said in a report.  “There is much concern in the U.S. that they can’t plant
their corn in time due to the wet weather and they closed at a
limit of 40 cents last night,” Lindy van Blommestein, a trader
at Farmwise Grains (Pty) Ltd., said by phone from Johannesburg.  South Africa  is the continent’s largest producer of corn.
White corn is a staple food, while the yellow variety is mainly
used as  animal feed .  Wheat for delivery in July gained 1.3 percent to 3,430 rand
a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
