Indonesia ’s rice harvest, the
world’s third-largest, may climb to a record for a second
straight year, curbing the need to import grain, the  United
Nations  said.  The paddy crop may be 72.1 million metric tons in 2013, 4.4
percent more than last year’s record 69.05 million tons, the
UN’s Food & Agriculture Organization said today in a  report  on
its website. The harvest is expected to climb even after excess
rain in December and March caused flood damage in some areas.
Corn production may be about 19 million tons, similar to the
record 18.96 million tons harvested a year earlier.  “The anticipated increase is mainly attributed to diverse
initiatives launched by the government in order to achieve self-
sufficiency target, as well as the expected increase in area
planted to the crop,” the Rome-based FAO said.  Indonesian grain imports in the 2013-14 season begun April
1 may fall to 9.4 million tons from 9.8 million tons in the
prior period, the FAO said. Domestic prices for medium-quality
rice reached a record in February before declining in March.
Prices last month were still 3.2 percent higher than a year
earlier. Food-security conditions in the country are mostly
stable, except in eastern areas, the FAO said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
