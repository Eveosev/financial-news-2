Eco-Bat Technologies Ltd., the lead
producer, reported an 82 percent drop in 2012 profit as average
lead prices declined.  Net income was 18 million pounds ($28 million) from 102.7
million pounds in 2011, Matlock, England-based Eco-Bat said in
an e-mailed report today. Revenue fell 6.5 percent to 1.7
billion pounds because lead prices on average were 14 percent
lower and lead sales fell 1.5 percent from 2011, it said.  Scrap battery prices in  Europe  and the U.S. are eroding
earnings, Eco-Bat said. Profit was down last year because of
losses in foreign exchange and an actuarial loss on defined
benefit pension plans, the company said.  Demand is “reasonable” for refined lead, Eco-Bat said.
The European Commission’s investigation into prices paid for
used batteries and lead scrap is still at an early stage, it
said. Eco-Bat said in September it was cooperating with
regulators on the matter.  ((Eco-Bat will hold a conference call tomorrow at 2 p.m.
