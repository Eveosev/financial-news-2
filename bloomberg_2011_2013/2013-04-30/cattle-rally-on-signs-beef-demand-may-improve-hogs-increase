Cattle futures rose for the first
time in three sessions on signs of improving demand for U.S.
beef. Hog prices also gained.  Wholesale  beef  rallied 1 percent yesterday to a six-week
high of $1.9479 a pound, heading for the biggest monthly gain
since October, U.S. Department of Agriculture data show.
Meatpackers processed 119,000 cattle yesterday, up 6.3 percent
from a year earlier, USDA data show. Prospects for warmer
weather and holidays including Memorial Day on May 27 will boost
meat demand for outdoor grilling, said Don Roose, the president
of U.S. Commodities Inc.  “You have a tendency to get a kick in on the beef because
of the grilling season,” Roose said by telephone from West Des
Moines,  Iowa . “We had pretty good clearance last week.”  Cattle futures for June delivery climbed 0.3 percent to
$1.22875 a pound at 9:40 a.m. on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange. Prices are down 1.5 percent this month through
yesterday, heading for the third straight decline.  Feeder-cattle futures for August settlement rose 0.3
percent to $1.50275 a pound.  Hog futures for June settlement gained 0.5 percent to
92.575 cents a pound on the CME. Prices are up 1.2 percent this
month through yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
