Globacom Ltd.,  Nigeria ’s second-
biggest mobile phone provider, said it’s investing $1.25 billion
to upgrade and expand its network infrastructure to improve
voice and data services.  The Lagos-based company signed a $750 million pact with
 China ’s Huawei Technologies Co. and another $500 million accord
with  ZTE Corp. (000063) , also of China, according to an e-mailed
statement today from Bode Opeseyitan, a spokesman.  “With the planned expansion, Globacom’s network capacity
will increase in many folds, thus enabling it to carry high
level of data in addition to other improvements in voice
services,” Chief Operating Officer Mohammed Jameel said in the
statement.  Nigerian mobile phone operators are investing in their
networks to overcome frequent power cuts and the sabotage of
facilities in the country’s mainly Muslim north, where Islamist
militants target telecommunications companies for helping the
authorities to track them.  MTN Nigerian Communication Ltd., a
unit of Johannesburg-based  MTN Group Ltd. (MTN)  and the country’s
biggest mobile phone provider, said last week it got a $3
billion loan from a group of 24 local and foreign lenders to
upgrade infrastructure.  Nigeria,  Africa ’s most populous nation with more than 160
million people, had about 117 million active mobile and fixed
phone lines as of February, according to the industry regulator,
the  Nigeria Communications Commission . Globacom is the second-
biggest network with 24 million subscribers as of the end of
last year, according to data on the NCC’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
