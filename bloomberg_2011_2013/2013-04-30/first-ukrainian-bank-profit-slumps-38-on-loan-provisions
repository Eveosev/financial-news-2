First Ukrainian International
Bank’s profit fell 38 percent last year after an economic slump
boosted provisions for bad loans.  Net income fell to $34.7 million from $56.4 million in
2011, the Donetsk, Ukraine-based bank said in an e-mailed
statement late yesterday. Provisions for retail loans stood at
$31.1 million, or $14.5 million more than a year earlier.  Ukraine’s  economy  shrank 1.3 percent in the July-September
period and 2.5 percent in the last quarter of 2012 as domestic
consumption failed to offset the country’s weakening exports,
according to statistics data. Gross domestic product probably
shrank 1.4 percent in the first three months of 2013, according
to the median forecast of six economists in a Bloomberg survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
