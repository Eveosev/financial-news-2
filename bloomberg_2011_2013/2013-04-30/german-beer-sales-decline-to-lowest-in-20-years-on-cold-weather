German  beer  sales dropped to 1.99
billion liters (4.2 billion pints) in the first quarter, the
lowest amount in at least 20 years, according to the Federal
Statistical Office.  Volume dropped 4.3 percent to the lowest level since 1993,
when the data were adjusted to exclude alcohol-free beer, Petra
Martin, a spokeswoman said.  “We had a long, snowy winter, so people did not go out
that much to have beer in the sun,” said Marc-Oliver Huhnholz,
a spokesman for German Brewers Federation.  Beer sales have shrunk for 37 years since peak consumption
in  Germany  of 151 liters per capita in 1976, according to the
trade group. Last year the average German downed 106 liters,
almost a third less. Still, Germany ranks only below the  Czech
Republic  for per-capita beer consumption, according to 2010
 statistics  compiled by Kirin Holdings Co.  “The population is getting older, the drinking culture is
changing, alcohol has been banned from the workplace and young
people have a much bigger variety of drinks to choose from,”
Huhnholz said.  The breweries with the biggest market share in Germany are
Radeberger Gruppe, which is owned by Dr. August Oetker KG,
 Anheuser-Busch InBev NV (ABI) , the producer of Beck’s, and closely
held Bitburger Braugruppe.  To contact the reporter on this story:
