Japanese crude  imports  for power
generation fell 34 percent in March as higher temperatures
weakened demand for heating.  Japan , the world’s third-largest oil consumer, bought
912,127 kiloliters of the fuel for electricity production,
equivalent to 185,000 barrels a day,  data  from the Ministry of
Economy, Trade and Industry showed today. That’s down from 1.38
million kiloliters a year earlier. Total oil purchases dipped
1.1 percent to 20.5 million kiloliters, the report showed.  Temperatures in Japan averaged 12.1 degrees Celsius (54
degrees Fahrenheit) last month, compared with 8.8 degrees in
March 2012,  according  to the  Japan Meteorological Agency .
Electricity generated and purchased by the country’s 10 regional
power companies declined 7.1 percent from a year earlier to 76.1
billion kilowatt-hours because of the warmer weather and energy
conservation measures, the Federation of Electric Power
Companies  said  April 12.  Oil-product imports imports rose 13 percent to 3.04 million
kiloliters in March, while exports increased 23 percent to 2.39
million kiloliters. Domestic oil-product sales fell 6.5 percent
to 17.1 million kiloliters.  Japan’s oil purchases from  Iran  increased 4.5 percent to
1.39 million kiloliters. The Persian Gulf nation, restricted by
international sanctions on its energy exports because of its
nuclear program, was Japan’s sixth-biggest supplier after  Saudi
Arabia , the United Arab Emirates, Qatar,  Russia  and Kuwait.  Statistics based on customs-clearance data by the Ministry
of Finance showed a 51 percent decline in crude imports from
Iran on April 26. Today’s trade ministry figures are based on
data collected from buyers via questionnaire and include fuel in
so-called bonded storage tanks that haven’t yet passed through
customs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
