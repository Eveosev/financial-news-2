WTI crude fell, while cotton and gold rose. The UBS Bloomberg
CMCI  index  of 26 raw materials fell 0.8 percent to 1,476.455.  GRAINS, OILSEEDS  Corn futures fell from a four-week high on speculation that
U.S. farmers boosted sales of grain harvested in 2012 and that
drier weather will help ease planting delays for this year’s
crop. Soybeans also dropped, while wheat rose.  Average cash-corn prices jumped 6.2 percent yesterday after
rain limited planting to the slowest pace since 1984, government

Financial Services Inc., said some clients sold the grain after
the rally. Warm, dry weather in the western Midwest in the next
two days, and dry weather from  Kentucky  to  Michigan  through May
4, will firm soils for planting equipment before rain returns,
