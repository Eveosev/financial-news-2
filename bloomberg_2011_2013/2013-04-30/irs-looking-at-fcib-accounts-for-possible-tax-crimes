A U.S. judge authorized the
 Internal Revenue Service  to seek information about possible  tax
evasion  through offshore accounts at  Canadian Imperial Bank of
Commerce ’s FirstCaribbean International Bank.  The IRS may seek information on FCIB’s U.S. customers by
serving a so-called John Doe summons on  Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC) , which
holds the bank’s U.S. correspondent account, U.S. District Judge
Thelton Henderson ruled yesterday in federal court in  San
Francisco .  At least 129 taxpayers voluntarily disclosed to the IRS
that they held undeclared accounts at FCIB, based in Barbados,
according to an affidavit by IRS Revenue Agent Cheryl Kiger.
Several other people have been convicted of financial crimes
involving accounts at FCIB, according to Kiger.  “The persons in the ‘John Doe’ class may have failed to
report the existence of foreign financial accounts under their
control, failed to report income, evaded income taxes, or
otherwise violated the internal revenue laws of the United
States,” according to the Kiger affidavit.  “We will review the summons and respond as legally
required,” Ancel Martinez, a spokesman for San Francisco-based
Wells Fargo, said in an e-mailed statement. Wells Fargo is the
fourth-largest U.S. bank by assets.  Mary Lou Frazer, a spokeswoman for Toronto-based CIBC,
didn’t immediately return a voice-mail message seeking comment.  The case is In the Matter of the Tax Liabilities of  John
Does , 13-cv-01938, U.S. District Court, Northern District of
California (San Francisco).  To contact the reporters on this story:
