Vietnamese Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung has asked government agencies for an explanation of a
new incident this month in the northern city of Haiphong where
protests took place last year.  Clashes occurred on April 21 at the construction site for a
planned shoe factory in the Tien Lang district of Haiphong,
according to  a posting  on the national government’s website.
About 100 villagers were involved, along with security guards
and others, according to  a summary  on the website of the city
government of Haiphong, a port city about 60 miles (97
kilometers) east of the Vietnamese capital of Hanoi.  Vietnamese authorities this month sentenced a former local
official in Tien Lang to jail for destroying property over a
land dispute. That incident involved a planned eviction after a
lease on aquatic farmland expired, according to a report this
month by  Vietnam  News Agency.  Land-related matters dominate complaints to Vietnam’s
government, and people that lose land are increasingly staging
public protests, the  World Bank  said in  a report  last year.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
