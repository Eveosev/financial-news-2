Brent crude  fell for a second day
after OPEC’s production increased to a five-month high and an
industry group said U.S. stockpiles climbed for the first time
in three weeks.  Futures slid as much as 1.8 percent in London after
dropping 1.4 percent yesterday. U.S. crude inventories rose by
5.2 million barrels last week, the  American Petroleum Institute 
said. Government figures today are projected to show a gain of
1.1 million barrels, according to a Bloomberg News survey. Daily
output by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
increased in April by 194,000 barrels a day, a separate survey
indicated. An index of manufacturing in China signaled weaker
expansion in April.  “With inventories at the levels they are at, it is a
question of how much demand there is, and there is growing
evidence of a slowdown in economic activity with even China
weaker than expected,”  Michael Hewson , a market analyst at CMC
Markets Plc in London, said today by telephone. “The direction
of travel on oil is down, and I see no reason to change that
view unless OPEC cuts production.”  Brent for June settlement slid as much as $1.83 to $100.54
a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange, the
lowest intra-day level in a week, and was at $100.58 at 1:21
p.m. local time. Futures fell $1.44 to $102.37 yesterday,
capping a 7 percent drop for April. Trading was 2 percent above
the 100-day average for the time of day. Prices are down 9.5
percent this year.  Cushing Supplies  West Texas Intermediate for June delivery declined as much
as $1.79 to $91.67 a barrel in electronic trading on the  New
York  Mercantile Exchange and was at $91.81 at the same time
today. Front-month Brent was at a premium of $8.73 to WTI, the
narrowest gap since Dec. 30, 2011.  While total U.S. crude stockpiles rose last week, supplies
at Cushing, Oklahoma, the delivery point for New York-traded
futures, decreased by 1.4 million barrels, the API data showed.
Gasoline inventories shrank by 2.7 million barrels. The Energy
Information Administration report today may show they declined
by  900,000 barrels , according to the median estimate of 11
analysts in the Bloomberg survey.  The API collects stockpile information on a voluntary basis
from operators of refineries, bulk terminals and pipelines. The
government requires that reports be filed with the EIA, the
Energy Department’s statistical arm, for its weekly survey.  Saudi Output  OPEC pumped 30.9 million barrels a day of crude last month,
a survey of  oil companies  and industry analysts showed.  Saudi
Arabia , the group’s biggest producer, increased daily output by
80,000 barrels to 9.18 million. Kuwait and the  United Arab
Emirates  also boosted production by 80,000 barrels a day each.  Output by Iran, which is under Western sanctions on its
energy exports because of its nuclear program, dropped by
150,000 to 2.55 million barrels a day, the lowest level since
February 1990.  Saudi Arabia intends to maintain its production capacity at
12.5 million barrels a day, Oil Minister  Ali al-Naimi  said
yesterday at the Center for Strategic & International Studies in
Washington. Prince Turki Al Faisal, a former head of
intelligence, said on April 25 at  Harvard University  that the
kingdom plans to raise capacity to 15 million barrels a day by
2020, according to a copy of his speech posted on the university
website April 29.  China Manufacturing  Oil extended declines after China’s  Purchasing Managers ’
Index showed manufacturing expanded at a weaker pace last month.
The gauge fell to 50.6, the National Bureau of Statistics and
China Federation of Logistics and Purchasing said today in
Beijing. That compared with the 50.7 median forecast of 31
analysts in a Bloomberg News survey and a March reading of 50.9.
The nation is the world’s second-biggest oil consumer.  “We’re seeing some weakness, and clearly the inventory
numbers have put some weight on the market,” said  Michael McCarthy , a chief market strategist at CMC Markets in Sydney.
“There are some jitters around the China growth story.”  WTI may tumble below $80 a barrel if it fails to rise above
$100, according to technical analysis by Piper Jaffray Cos. The
contract is trading above the moving averages for the last 10,
50 and 200 days, a signal to buy, said  Craig Johnson , technical
market strategist with the company in  Minneapolis . If crude
fails to settle above $100,  market sentiment  will turn bearish,
he said. WTI last breached that level in September on an
intraday basis and in May 2012 at settlement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
