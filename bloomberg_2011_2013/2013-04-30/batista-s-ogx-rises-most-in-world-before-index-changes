(Corrects date in third paragraph.)  Billionaire  Eike Batista ’s  OGX
Petroleo e Gas Participacoes SA , which lost as much as 90
percent in the past year, is the world’s best-performing major
stock in the last four days amid prospects that its weighting in
 Brazil ’s benchmark index will increase.  The stock rose 6.4 percent to 2.3 reais at 12:10 p.m. in
 Sao Paulo . A 52 percent four-day surge is the steepest among
global stocks tracked by Bloomberg with a value of at least $3
billion. OGX shares reduced a year-to-date loss to 49 percent.  The oil producer’s weighting in Brazil’s Ibovespa index
probably will rise to about 4.8 percent on May 6 from 2.5
percent now following a bank holiday tomorrow, according to
Bloomberg calculations. Short selling reached a record 22
percent of shares available for trading yesterday as the stock
plummeted in the past four months amid investor concerns over
missed output targets, low production and dwindling cash.  “There’s a re-balancing of the index that can have an
impact,” said Leonardo Brito, an analyst at hedge fund Teorica
Investimentos, said by phone from Rio. “There could be a bit of
a short squeeze, it was very oversold.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
