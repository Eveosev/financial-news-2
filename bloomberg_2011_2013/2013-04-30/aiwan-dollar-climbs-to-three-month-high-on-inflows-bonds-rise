Taiwan ’s dollar rose to a three-
month high as overseas investors increased holdings of local
stocks. Bonds extended their biggest advance in almost two years
after economic growth missed economists’ estimates.  Global funds bought $363 million more equities than they
sold yesterday, the biggest net purchases since Nov. 30,
boosting the  Taiex (TWSE)  index to a 13-month high. Taiwan’s five-year
bonds climbed for a seventh day, the longest winning streak
since July, after the statistics bureau reported today first-
quarter gross domestic product rose 1.54 percent from a year
earlier, less than half the 3.72 percent median forecast in a
Bloomberg survey.  “Money keeps going into Asian regions like Taiwan,” said
 Frances Cheung , a Hong Kong-based strategist at Credit Agricole
CIB. “There’s not much potential for the currency to strengthen
further if Taiwan wants to retain its export competitiveness.”  The Taiwan dollar advanced 1.4 percent this month to
NT$29.463 against its U.S. counterpart, Taipei Forex Inc. prices
show. The currency rose 0.5 percent as of 9:48 a.m. in Taipei
and touched NT$29.42, the strongest level since Jan. 28.  The local dollar was trading 0.7 percent higher two minutes
before the close yesterday and finished with a 0.3 percent gain.
The central bank has sold the currency in the run-up to the
close on most days in the past year, according to traders who
asked not to be identified.  Bond Rally  One-month non-deliverable forwards for the  Taiwan dollar 
rose 1.3 percent in April and 0.1 percent today to NT$29.418
against the greenback, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
One-month implied volatility, a gauge of expected moves in the
 exchange rate  used to price options, climbed eight basis points,
or 0.08 percentage point, to 3.54 percent from the end of March.  The yield on the 0.875 percent bonds due January 2018 fell
12 basis points to 0.892 percent this month, according to Gretai
