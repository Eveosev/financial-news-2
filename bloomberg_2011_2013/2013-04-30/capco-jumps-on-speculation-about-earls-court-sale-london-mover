Capital & Counties Properties Plc (CAPC) 
climbed to a record after JPMorgan Chase & Co. said the builder
planning 7,500 homes at  London ’s Earls Court may sell part of
the site and use some of the proceeds for a one-time dividend.  The shares rose as much as 4 percent to 316.80 pence, the
highest since CapCo was split off from Capital Shopping Centres
Group Plc in May 2010. The Earls Court project is the company’s
second-biggest asset by value.  A potential sale of part of Earls Court is “in the
cards,” JPMorgan analysts including Harm Meijer said in a note
to investors today, which could result in a special dividend.
Capital & Counties declined to comment.  Developers including Capital & Counties that own land for
housing are benefitting from rising home prices in the U.K.
capital, low  interest rates  and U.K. government incentives to
make it easier for people to buy homes.  The JPMorgan analysts raised their rating on the London-
based developer to “overweight” from “underweight” and
raised their price estimate to 365 pence from 290 pence.  The analysts said Earls Court and  Covent Garden , another of
CapCo’s London sites, may appreciate significantly in the years
ahead.  “Management has a punchy plan of action to maximize value
from Earls Court and Covent Garden in the next three years,”
they said. Covent Garden is undervalued by as much as 38
percent, while Earls Court could rise to 50 million pounds per
acre from 14.8 million pounds per acre last year, the analysts
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
