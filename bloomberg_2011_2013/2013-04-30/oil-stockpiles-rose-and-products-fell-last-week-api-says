Oil supplies rose 5.18 million

stockpiles dropped 2.71 million to 217.1 million.  Crude at Cushing, Oklahoma , the delivery point for futures
traded on the  New York  Mercantile Exchange, slipped 1.39 million
barrels to 49.7 million.  The Energy Information Administration, the Energy
Department’s statistical arm, is scheduled to release its
inventory report at 10:30 a.m. tomorrow in  Washington .  The government report may show supplies of oil increased
1.1 million barrels last week, according to the median of 11

gasoline stockpiles dropped 900,000 barrels and distillate

from operators of refineries, bulk terminals and pipelines. The
government requires that reports be filed with the EIA for its
weekly survey.  Crude oil for June delivery fell $1.55, or 1.6 percent, to
