The  Warsaw Stock Exchange  said
first-quarter profit jumped 25 percent from a year earlier after
the purchase of  Poland ’s biggest power bourse.  Net income increased to 42.1 million zloty ($13.3 million)
from 33.5 million zloty a year earlier, while revenue rose 24
percent to 79.4 million zloty, the state-controlled company said
in a regulatory filing today. The power exchange, bought from
the government and Polish utilities in February 2012, generated
26.1 million zloty of sales in the first quarter, while revenue
from its financial-market business shrank 7.8 percent to 52.5
million zloty.  The bourse is central  Europe ’s biggest exchange, trading
shares of 438 companies on its main market with a combined value
of 702 billion zloty. The operator, which also runs the
NewConnect trading platform for smaller companies and the
Catalyst bond market, saw its stock-trading volumes rebound 1.5
percent to 55.7 billion zloty in the first quarter from a year
earlier.  “The power market’s strong performance and a revival in
equity turnover bode well for the next quarters,” Jaromir Szortyka, a Warsaw-based analyst in PKO Bank Polski SA, said by
phone today.  Warsaw exchange shares jumped as much as 3 percent to 38.31
zloty today, the biggest intraday gain since Feb. 13.  To contact the reporter on this story:
