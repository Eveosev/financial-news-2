Yuan  deposits in Hong Kong climbed
to a record in March on bets the currency’s advance will
accelerate, and as global usage increases.  Savings rose 16 billion yuan ($2.6 billion) from February
to 668 billion yuan, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority said in a
 statement  on its website today. It was the sixth monthly gain in
a row and the smallest increase in four months.  The yuan will appreciate 1.8 percent to 6.12 per dollar in
2013, compared with last year’s 1 percent rally, according to
the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of economists. Global
yuan payments increased 33 percent in March from the previous
month, making it the 13th most-used currency, the Society for
Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication said on April 25.  “There’s larger exposure because of the appreciation
trend,” said Dariusz Kowalczyk, a Hong Kong-based strategist at
Credit Agricole CIB. “In the near term, we should see further
gains in yuan deposits.”  Morgan Stanley raised its end-2013 yuan forecast to 6.1 per
dollar from 6.3 yesterday, citing prospects for a wider trading
band and a larger base of market participants.  Hong Kong  handled
341 billion yuan of trade settled in the Chinese currency in
March, a 54 percent increase from February, HKMA data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
