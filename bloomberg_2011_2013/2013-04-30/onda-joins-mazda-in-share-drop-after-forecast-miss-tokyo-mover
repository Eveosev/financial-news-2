Honda Motor Co. (7267)  and  Mazda Motor
Corp. (7261)  fell in Tokyo trading as the Japanese carmakers forecast
profits that missed analyst estimates.  Suzuki Motor Corp. (7269)  rose
after earnings at its Indian unit almost doubled.  Honda fell as much as 3.7 percent to 3,860 yen on the Tokyo
Stock Exchange, the stock’s biggest intraday decline in two
months, as of 9:57 a.m. Mazda, Japan’s most export-dependent
carmaker, fell as much as 5.2 percent to 328 yen. Suzuki rose as
much as 7.8 percent to 2,533 yen. The benchmark Nikkei 225 Stock
Average declined 0.7 percent.  Honda’s net income will probably rise 58 percent to 580
billion yen ($5.9 billion) in the 12 months ending March 2014,
the Tokyo-based automaker said April 26. Though the profit
forecast missed the average analyst estimate compiled by
Bloomberg, Honda’s revenue projection exceeded estimates.  “Margin improvement is sluggish, but not because of any
changes in the competitive landscape or because of structural
problems,” Takaki Nakanishi, a Tokyo-based analyst with Bank of
America Merrill Lynch, wrote in a report about Honda. This is
“solely due to a heavier burden from upfront investment than
expected.”  Mazda fell after the company said net income may rise to 70
billion yen in the year ending March 2014, below the 82 billion
yen average of 19 analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.
Suzuki rose after its Indian unit said profit almost doubled
because of a weak Japanese yen and more orders for its Ertiga
minivans.  Honda, the first major Japanese automaker to report results
this earnings season, is targeting to sell a record number of
vehicles this year. A weaker yen and demand in the U.S., its
biggest market, is helping the company buffer a drop in China
sales, where a territorial dispute has fueled anti- Japan 
sentiment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
