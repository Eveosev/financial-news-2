Japanese  stock futures  fell,
indicating the  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  may decline for a third
day, as the yen strengthened against the dollar and investors
await a report on Chinese manufacturing.  American Depositary Receipts  of  Sharp Corp. (6753) , a television
maker that gets more than 50 percent of its sales outside Japan,
fell 2.6 percent as the rising currency curbed the earnings
outlook for exporters. ADRs of  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP)  dropped 0.9
percent as a drop in metals prices curbed the profit outlook at
the world’s largest mining company.  Futures on Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average expiring in
June traded at 13,840 in Chicago yesterday, down from 13,860 at
the close in Osaka, Japan. They were bid in the pre-market at
13,850 in Osaka at 8:05 a.m. local time. Futures on Australia’s
S&P/ASX 200 Index advanced 0.1 percent and New Zealand’s NZX 50
Index fell 0.1 percent.  “There is little doubt that risks to global economic
growth for 2013 are tilted to the downside,” said Matthew Sherwood, Sydney-based head of investment market research at
Perpetual Ltd., which manages about $25 billion. “Earnings
growth after several years of very subdued performance still
seems a bit of a stretch.”  Markets in China,  Hong Kong , India, South Korea, Taiwan,
Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam and the Philippines are
closed today for holidays. The Bloomberg China-US Equity Index
of the most-traded Chinese shares in the U.S. climbed 1 percent
in New York yesterday.  A gauge of China Purchasing Manufacturing Index is forecast
to slow in April when the report is released in Beijing today.  Fed Meeting  The  Federal Reserve  may consider maintaining its bond-
buying program at a two-day meeting concluding today,  after a
report last week showed the world’s largest economy grew less
than forecast in the first quarter.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index, the benchmark regional
equities gauge, climbed 9.9 percent this year through yesterday
amid optimism Japan will deploy more measures to beat deflation
and that policy makers in the U.S. and China remain on standby
to support growth. That left the gauge yesterday trading at 14.3
times average estimated earnings compared with 14.5 for the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and 12.9 times for the Stoxx Europe
600 Index, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Futures on the  S&P 500 Index (SPX)  rose less than 0.1 percent.
The gauge yesterday closed at a record as  consumer confidence 
gained and investors bet central banks worldwide will continue
their efforts to stimulate the economy.  The yen rose 0.1 percent to 97.38 per dollar as of 8:11
a.m. in Tokyo, a fifth day of gains.  The London Metal Exchange Index of industrial metals lost
1.4 percent yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
