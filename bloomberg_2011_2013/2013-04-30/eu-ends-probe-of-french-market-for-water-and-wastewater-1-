The European Commission  closed  a
probe into  Veolia Environnement  SA, Suez Environnement SA and
Saur SA after failing to find evidence the companies and a trade
group plotted to fix the price of water and wastewater services
in  France .  “The commission has thoroughly investigated the existence
of possible anticompetitive practices in the market for
outsourced management of water and wastewater services in
France,” the European Union’s antitrust regulator said on its
website today. “This thorough investigation failed to establish
the existence of an infringement of EU competition rules.”  Antitrust officials raided the three companies in 2010 over
concerns that they colluded in public tenders for water
distribution and treatment.  Suez Environnement, which is 34 percent-owned by utility
 GDF Suez (GSZ)  SA, said last week that waste-treatment revenue dropped
5.3 percent as the economic crisis in Europe continued to shrink
volumes. The utility, together with larger rival  Veolia
Environnement (VIE) , has seen demand for industrial waste collection
slide after manufacturers reduced factory output.  Suez Environnement was fined 8 million euros ($10.5
million) by the EU for breaking a seal regulators attached to an
office door during the 2010 raid.  To contact the reporter on this story:
