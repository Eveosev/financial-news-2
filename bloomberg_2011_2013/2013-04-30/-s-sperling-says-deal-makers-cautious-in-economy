Scott Sperling, co-president of
private-equity firm Thomas H. Lee Partners LP, said economic
uncertainty is making investors like him wary about doing deals.  “We all see these really black, dark clouds on the horizon
and we’re not sure which way they’re going -- whether they’re
going to blow out to sea or whether they’re going to come and
rain on us again,” Sperling said today in an interview with
Bloomberg Television’s Cristina Alesci at the Milken Institute
Global Conference in Beverly Hills,  California . “There’s a
period of uncertainty that needs to be priced into a
transaction, and there are certain factors about the credit
markets that have actually caused us to be more cautious.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
