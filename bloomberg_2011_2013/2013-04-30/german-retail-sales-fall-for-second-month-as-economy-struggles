German retail  sales (GRFRIAMM)  fell for a
second month in March, adding to signs that Europe’s largest
economy is struggling to recover.  Sales, adjusted for inflation and seasonal swings, dropped
0.3 percent from February, when they fell a revised 0.6 percent,
the Federal Statistics Office in Wiesbaden said today. That’s in
line with the median of 21 estimates in a Bloomberg News  survey .
From a year earlier, sales declined 2.8 percent.  Germany’s Bundesbank last week cast doubt on a first-
quarter recovery, citing sluggish industrial output and cold
winter weather. Business confidence fell for a second month in
April and economists from UBS AG to  Royal Bank of Scotland Group
Plc (RBS)  predict the  European Central Bank  will cut interest rates
this week to foster growth. The German economy contracted 0.6
percent in the final three months of 2012.  “The weather was extreme and that had an impact not only
on construction but also on retail sales,” said  Andreas Scheuerle , an economist at Dekabank in Frankfurt. Still, sales
jumped 3.1 percent in January and “consumption should have been
strong in the first quarter,” he said.  The German Labor Agency will release unemployment data for
April at 9.55 a.m. in Nuremberg today. Joblessness is expected
to increase by 2,000, with the unemployment rate holding at 6.9
percent, according to separate  surveys .  To contact the reporter on this story:
