Russian billionaire  Suleiman Kerimov , whose biggest assets include stakes in  Polyus Gold
International Ltd (PLZLY)  and OAO Uralkali, will put profits from his
fortune into a charitable foundation.  The Suleyman Kerimov Foundation will take all the profit
from Kerimov’s companies, including dividends, Alexey
Krasovskiy, Kerimov’s aide, said by phone today.  Kerimov transfered all his assets to trusts and quit
management as is required by the Russian law when he became a
senator in the Federation Council in 2007, Krasovskiy said.
Giving profits to a charitable foundation is the next step, he
said. Kerimov is ranked  Russia ’s 20th-richest person by Forbes
with a $7.1 billion fortune.  The Suleyman Kerimov Foundation is registered in
 Switzerland , according to Interfax. It supports culture,
education and medicine, the newswire said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
