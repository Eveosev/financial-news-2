Quantum Utility Generation LLC, the
independent power producer that’s planning to build a solar
project in  Guam , acquired a 25-year power-purchase agreement
from Pacific Green Resources LLC.  The contract will let Quantum sell 7.75 megawatts of
capacity from its project to Guam Power Authority, the Houston-
based developer said today in a statement. Terms weren’t
disclosed for the transaction, which closed April 25. The solar
farm is expected to begin producing electricity next year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
