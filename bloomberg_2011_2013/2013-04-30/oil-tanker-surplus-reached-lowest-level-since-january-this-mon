A surplus of the largest oil
tankers seeking cargoes in the Persian Gulf reached the lowest
level since January this month, a Bloomberg News survey showed.  On average, there were 20 percent more very large crude
carriers for hire over a 30-day period than cargoes available to
load in April, the median  estimate  in a survey of six
shipbrokers and owners today showed. That matched the January
excess, according to figures compiled by Bloomberg.  Crude shipments by sea will rise 2.2 percent this year,
Morgan Stanley said in a report yesterday, cutting its estimate
from 2.9 percent. Shipping demand will expand 3.3 percent, the
bank said, less than the previous 3.9 percent projection. The
global tanker fleet will swell 4.4 percent, spurred by 5 percent
growth in VLCC capacity, according to Morgan Stanley.  The “four-week vessel count is not getting any shorter at
95,” Kevin Sy, a Singapore-based freight-derivatives broker at
Marex Spectron Group, said of the Persian Gulf in an e-mailed
report today. “Tonnage is well supplied for now.”  VLCCs are  losing  $1,188 daily on the industry’s benchmark
Saudi Arabia-to-Japan route, according to the London-based
Baltic Exchange. Returns became negative again on March 28 after
VLCCs lost money on the journey for seven weeks through March
14, exchange data show. Each of the ships can hold 2 million
barrels of oil.  To contact the reporter on this story:
