Tim Taylor, who won a school-record
337 games and six Ivy League titles over 28 seasons as  Yale
University ’s hockey coach, died over the weekend from cancer. He
was 71.  Taylor coached at Yale from 1976 through 2006 and during
that time also spent two years as coach of the U.S. Olympic team,
including at the 1994  Winter Games .  “His passion for the game as a student and a teacher was
intoxicating,” said former Olympian and Yale center Bob Brooke,
who played seven seasons in the  National Hockey League . “You
couldn’t be a hockey player and not take something positive from
his study and enthusiasm for the game.”  After being succeeded by former player Keith Allain as
Yale’s coach, Taylor joined USA Hockey as the director of player
personnel for the junior national team that won a gold medal at
last year’s world championships.  “Tim was so many things to me. First a coach, then a boss
and mentor and later a peer,” Allain, who led the Bulldogs to
their first national championship two weeks ago, said in
 comments  distributed by the school. “But most importantly, he
was a friend. He has had a positive impact on so many people’s
lives and I am fortunate to be one of them.”  Taylor had a 337-433-55 career record at Yale.  To contact the reporter on this story:
