Who’s drunk? Who’s crazy? We are! Flight attendants, waiters, tour guides and other travel insiders spill the beans on travelers behaving badly and share a useful secret or two. Taxi Driver, New York The Inside Story . “I see a lot of drunk people. Before midnight, everybody is nice and they give big tips. But between midnight and 4 a.m. people are loaded. When I was a new driver, I picked up a couple who immediately started fooling around. They wanted to go to Brooklyn, but I didn’t recognize the address. I kept asking, ‘Ma’am how would you like me to go? I need directions.’ But she just kept shouting, ‘I’m a bad girl!’ I said, ‘I know, I know, but I still need directions.’ Then the guy passes out cold. Next thing I know, she climbs into the front seat and starts kissing me. ‘Ma’am! Ma’am!’ I tell her. ‘I’m on duty! This is my job!’ but she just keeps telling me over and over, ‘I’m a bad girl! I’m a bad girl!’ “They never did give me the directions. I just took them over the bridge and dropped them off. I’ll never forget those two.” The Intel . “We know every corner of the city and can make great guides. Give us an hour and we’ll show you all the highlights.” Front-Desk Clerk in a Mid-Market Hotel, Nice, France The Inside Story . “We used to make fun of Americans for not knowing their fingers from their toes in terms of European history and geography. But since the recession, we miss them. They’re really polite to everyone. The guests who are filling their shoes come from cultures where it’s acceptable to be harsh or abusive to people who serve you, which has been a real shock to us. If there’s a silver lining these days, it’s got to be the Brazilians, who are as nice as the Americans but also just knock-down-dead gorgeous and always up for having a good time.” The Intel . “Guests don’t know it, but we often have a lot of leeway to decide on which room you get right up to the very last minute. If you’re impatient or nasty, you’ll get a room in front of the elevator or, at our hotel, one that overlooks the street where the tramway runs until midnight. So be nice.” Waiter in a Michelin-Starred Restaurant, New York City The Inside Story . “People can be really crazy. We recently had a woman who ordered a mixed green salad and had a complete meltdown because there was frisée in it. She got up from the table, cornered the waiter, and berated him, claiming she had a frisée allergy. It’s very fashionable to have a food allergy these days. You get to see how bitter and needy people can be. Californians think they’re special. They always let you know they’re from California, which is irritating, but not as irritating as diners who wave their arms frantically to get your attention. Just raise your finger—we’re trained to notice.” The Intel . “It’s totally reasonable not to tip on the tax. For wine, we don’t expect 20 percent, but it can take a lot of care to serve, so tipping half that is appreciated.” Carpet and Antiques Dealer, Kuwait The Inside Story . “We sell Afghani carpets. Many people in the United States associate Afghanistan with Osama Bin Laden, the Taliban, or drugs, but in reality we have talented young people making amazing carpets. I hope we represent the other face of Afghanistan. I have been insulted many times. Once, a female customer told me that all Muslims were vampires. It turned out she had been given a hard time by some kids for wearing a dress that we would consider immodest. We talked for hours, and I tried to explain the Muslim point of view. In the end, she bought a few carpets!”  The Intel . “Educate yourself as best you can, then go in and ask questions you already know the answers to. But don’t make out that you know more than the seller. That’s not just being cocky, it’s humiliating, since ‘giving face’ is important all over Asia and the Middle East.” Tour Guide, Berlin The Inside Story . “It’s surprising how many men cry at the concentration camp and at the Holocaust memorial. I guess they keep things bottled up and these monuments just make it all bubble to the surface. Americans are a lot sweeter and more curious than most. One exception was the worst client I ever had: an American woman who said that there shouldn’t be a memorial to the homosexuals killed by the Nazis because they’re sinners. I gave her back her money and politely said that I couldn’t do the tour if she was going to have that attitude. She just walked away. We refer to a bad group as sheep or the walking dead and text one another about how terrible they are. We can do the job in our sleep. What sounds spontaneous on a tour is completely rehearsed. There are a lot of alpha males in this business, and they take full advantage of the girls on the tours. A lot of them will sleep with two a week. The worst insult is a bad tip. Anything from 10 to 20 euros for an adult with a job is appreciated, but less than that is insulting. On a good day, I’ll bring in 200 euros.” The Intel . “There are so many lakes around Berlin that the tourists don’t know about. They’re idyllic places where you can find great food and see a lot of naked people on the beach drinking beer. Müggelsee is stunning.” Waiter, Paris Café The Inside Story . “Starbucks has trained Americans to have bizarre coffee habits. We don’t do cappuccino, mocha, all those crazy things you find in America, and we rarely have soy milk. If you want a waiter to really hate you, ask for a decaffeinated coffee, because those have to be made by hand in many cafés. I appreciate it when people try to speak some French, but you never ever call a waiter in a café ‘ garçon .’ I don’t know where Americans got this idea, but it’s insulting. If you want to catch my attention, you say, ‘ S’il vous plaît ,’ and if you’re a pretty lady and feeling coquettish, you could try ‘ Beau jeune homme ’ [handsome young man] and see where that gets you.” The Intel . “In France, every social encounter starts with a ' Bonjour ' or ’ Bonsoir .’ If you’ve ordered a light meal, it’s nice to leave a couple of euros behind. If you’ve just had a coffee or a glass of wine, leave the yellow change [small brass coins] you get when you pay your bill.” Flight Attendant, Large International Airline The Inside Story . “People think we’re dumb. We’re not. When I started, you needed a college degree and had to be fluent in several languages. The lifestyle is what keeps us going—the travel, the layovers in Paris and Hawaii. It can be hard to give up. That’s why you see so many older flight attendants. The most challenging passengers are the ones who act entitled. They’ll say ‘I am a 100K flier,’ and we’ll look at them like ‘So what? Everyone is.’ Celebrities can be the worst. They all try to get in first class without paying. Zsa Zsa Gabor had a tantrum once. She had this little dog and wouldn’t keep it in the cage. She threw a glass of wine in someone’s face, and we had to call security on her. But Elizabeth Taylor was so sweet. She came back to the galley and put on an apron and helped me serve hors d’oeuvres.” The Intel . “If you’re on a flight with a lot of junior crew members, it’s because that flight’s passengers have a bad reputation. New York to south Florida is one of the worst. They don’t appreciate anything. They don’t say thank you, and they don’t return a smile. Don’t get me wrong, I’ve lived in New York, but there’s something about putting a bunch of New Yorkers on a plane.” Kenyan Safari Guide The Inside Story . “Americans are probably the kindest and most generous people we work with. They’re happy with everything we show them. But because of that, some guides take them for granted, treat them with laxity, and don’t give them the fullest experience. Americans should raise their expectations and push just a little bit to make sure they have the best safari possible. The most irritating thing is when guests tell you they want to see a kill and they expect you to make it happen. It takes patience and perseverance to find an animal hunting, but many guests get bored after a couple of hours and say they just want to go home.” The Intel . ”Parents need to take their kids to visit a school or a traditional home—not one that’s been set up for tourists. That way the children will really understand how little some other cultures have and will appreciate what their parents are giving them.” Tuk-Tuk Driver, Siem Reap The Inside Story . “Driving a tuk-tuk is hard work, but I like it because I get to be my own boss. The job is much more fun when the guest is having fun, so I’m friendly and try to get to know them a little. I always ask the Thai and Japanese men if they want to go to the massage parlor. Less than half say yes. Only about one percent of Europeans want to go.” The Intel . “Be sure to see the Hidden Temple, because there are few people who visit and it’s very peaceful there. I also think going to one of the small local markets is great. They bring in vegetables, put them down on a mat, and sit down behind what they sell—just like they have for more than 100 years.” Airport Screener, Major East Coast Airport The Inside Story . “People are usually stopped at checkpoints for having water bottles in their bags. We can use our discretion, and I tend to go easier on older people, children, and babies. We don’t get much guidance on how to deal with difficult passengers. One time a woman didn’t want to remove her shoes. When she finally realized she wasn’t getting anywhere, she took them off—and threw them in a screener’s face.” The Intel. “If you’re pulled over for a secondary screening or for a bag check, the worst thing you can do is object or say you are going to miss your flight. Even if it’s true, you might find that you get delayed longer.” Ride Operator, Walt Disney World The Inside Story . “We get most annoyed at parents who yell at us because they want to put their children on rides that they’re not tall enough for. The kids don’t really care—it’s always the parents who want them to go on. The kids could easily slip under the safety bar, so the parents are basically fighting to endanger their kid’s life. We’re definitely brainwashed. We don’t get paid enough to keep us happy—just a little more than minimum wage, around $8 an hour. But Disney’s strict about how we have to portray ourselves to the guests. When you’re always smiling and only saying good things about the company, eventually you start believing it. Disney is a fun place to work, but it doesn’t really help with your career plans. There are some people who have been here for 10 or 20 years, and you feel really bad for them.” The Intel . “Get a Fastpass right away for the ride you most want to go on, and plan your day around it. They’re free with your park admission. You can get Fastpasses every two hours at all the parks except Animal Kingdom—there you can get them every hour.” Hotel Manager, Cambodia The Inside Story . “Koreans have a reputation for being rude and loud, but the Chinese are even louder. Both Koreans and Chinese travel in large groups and don’t respect personal space, so you’ll often see their guides yelling and pushing other guides out of the way at major tourist sights. Australians don’t tip, but we don’t mind because they’re so easygoing. New Yorkers are a tough lot—not go-with-the-flow types at all! If you say that a tuk-tuk will come to collect them for dinner at seven o’clock, it had better be there at seven sharp or you’re going to hear about it for the rest of their stay. The worst are single New York women over 30 traveling solo. They tend to be really demanding and needy and bossy all at the same time. If they haven’t found someone to travel with them by now, you know there’s got to be a good reason why. We recently had one who complained that her feet were sore from sightseeing. We offered to bring her a tub of hot water and Epsom salts so she could soak her feet. When I delivered it to her room, she asked me if I would mind removing her socks and giving her feet a rub while I was at it!” The Intel . “To beat the crowds, come to Cambodia in the rainy season, from the end of April through September, when the tourist numbers plummet. People are afraid to visit during that time, but it’s rare to ever have a full day of rain. You’ll usually get a cloudburst that’s over by the time you order and pay for a soda.” Lingerie Saleswoman, Paris Department Store The Inside Story . “English and Swiss ladies still dress up a little bit to go shopping, which communicates some self-respect and a certain chic. It’s a sight for sore eyes in a world where these days so few women seem to bother even brushing their hair when they get out of bed.” The Intel . “I’m surprised that so many Americans shop in Paris when the same brands are available at much better prices in the United States. If I were shopping for gifts and souvenirs in Paris, the only place I’d go is Monoprix—they have great inexpensive current fashion items and nicely designed household goods, all with a French touch, and their grocery stores are good places to forage for inexpensive gifts.” Blackjack Dealer, Las Vegas The Inside Story . “We’re on your side, so don’t abuse us when you’re losing. We want you to win and have a good time so you’ll tip us. Most of our money comes from tips since most casinos pay minimum wage, but we’re not allowed to talk about tips or accept money directly from a player. If you want to tip, place a chip in front of your cards and we’ll play a round with you. So if you win, we win—see why we want you to win? It’s customary to do this after we deal you a blackjack, but newer players don’t know that. The chips go into a pot, which all the dealers split at the end of the night.” The Intel . “Ever notice how there are no clocks in casinos? It’s so you can’t see how much time you’re wasting in here. The key to winning is knowing when to quit. Sounds simple, but most people don’t get it.” More from  Condé Nast Traveler : Explore the Foothills of Vietnam's Son Tra Mountain Where to Eat, Sleep, and Shop in Trancoso, Brazil San Francisco's Best Vista Points Undercover Job Reports from CNT Editors How Can a Computer Glitch Ground an Entire Airline?
