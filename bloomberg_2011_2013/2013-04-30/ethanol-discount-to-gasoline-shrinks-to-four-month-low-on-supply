Ethanol’s discount to gasoline
narrowed to a four-month low on speculation that the slowest
pace of corn planting since 1986 will make it difficult to
replenish supplies.  The price difference, or spread, shrank 3.75 cents to 21.9
cents a gallon. The Agriculture Department said in a report
yesterday that 5 percent of the crop was planted as of April 28,
compared with a five-year average of 31 percent. Ethanol
stockpiles are at the lowest for this time of year in records
dating to June 2010, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Renewable Identification Numbers, or RINs, surged.  “With the strong corn market, and we don’t have a huge
inventory of product anyway, it just freaks people out,” said
Jim Damask, a manager at StarFuels Inc., a Jupiter, Florida-
based brokerage.  Denatured ethanol for May delivery rose 1.1 cents, or 0.4
percent, to $2.582 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade, the
highest price since March 27. Futures have gained 18 percent
this year and advanced for a second straight month.  Gasoline for May delivery decreased 2.65 cents, or 0.9
percent, to $2.801 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile Exchange .
The contract covers reformulated gasoline, made to be blended
with ethanol before delivery to filling stations.  Ethanol’s discount to gasoline today was the narrowest
since Dec. 6 and down from 78.76 cents as recently as Feb. 14.  Gasoline Pool  Ethanol-blended gasoline made up 93 percent of the total
U.S. gasoline pool in the week ended April 19, the lowest level
since March 29, according to the Energy information
Administration, the statistical arm of the Energy Department.
Ethanol is mixed with the motor fuel to stretch supply and meet
federal mandates.  The tightening spread may discourage refiners from blending
beyond government obligations, Damask said.  “There’s money, but not as much,” he said. “When you
factor in delivery, storage, rail, that starts to whittle that
down more than we think.”  Corn for May delivery fell 0.75 cent to $6.8325 a bushel in
 Chicago . One bushel makes at least 2.75 gallons of the renewable
fuel.  The corn crush spread was 10 cents a gallon, up from 8
cents April 26. That compares with minus 35 cents on Dec. 31.
The amount doesn’t include revenue from the sale of dried
distillers’ grains, a byproduct of ethanol production, which can
be fed to livestock.  RINs Prices  Corn-based ethanol RINs  rose 4.1 percent to 76.5 cents, a
fourth consecutive gain and the highest price since April 10,
data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Advanced RINs, which cover biodiesel and Brazilian
sugarcane-based ethanol, added 3.9 percent to 81 cents, the most
since April 22.  Ethanol  production  jumped 2.5 percent to 853,000 barrels a
day in the week ended April 19, EIA data show, down 1.4 percent
from a year earlier.  Stockpiles at 17.6 million barrels were down 19 percent
from a year ago, EIA said.  The agency is set to release the latest figures tomorrow at
10:30 a.m. in  Washington .  In cash market trading, ethanol in the U.S. Gulf slumped 6
cents to $2.555 a gallon, data compiled by Bloomberg show. In
the West Coast the additive rose 2 cents to $2.775 and in  New
York  the biofuel climbed 3 cents to $2.70. Chicago prices were
unchanged at $2.565 a gallon.  West Coast ethanol’s premium over the U.S. Gulf expanded 8
cents to 22 cents, the highest since April 18. Chicago’s
discount to New York Harbor swelled 3 cents to 13.5 cents.  Ethanol  imports  in the week ended April 19 averaged 39,000
barrels a day, the first time U.S. companies made foreign
purchases of the fuel since March 29, EIA data showed.  Anhydrous ethanol in  Sao Paulo  cost $2.64 a gallon as of
April 19, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
