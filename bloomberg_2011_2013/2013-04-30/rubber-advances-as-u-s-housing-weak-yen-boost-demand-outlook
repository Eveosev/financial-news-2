Rubber climbed, paring a third
monthly drop, on speculation that an improving housing market in
the U.S. and a weakening Japanese currency will increase demand
for the commodity used in tires.  Rubber for delivery in October rose as much as 2.1 percent
to 262.5 yen a kilogram ($2,677 a metric ton) on the  Tokyo 
Commodity Exchange, before trading at 260.6 yen at 11:07 a.m.
local time. Futures are set for a 4.9 percent decline this month.  Asian stocks surged, sending the regional benchmark index
to its highest level since 2008, after U.S. home sales climbed
and amid speculation that central banks around the world will
keep stimulating growth. The yen fell against a majority of its
most-traded counterparts as the rally in equities boosted demand
for higher-yielding assets.  “The U.S. economic data was supportive,” said Naohiro Niimura, a partner at research company Market Risk Advisory Co.
in Tokyo.  The index of pending home sales increased 1.5 percent after
a revised 1 percent decline the prior month, figures from the
National Association of Realtors showed yesterday in  Washington .
The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed 8.6 percent this year
through yesterday amid optimism  Japan  will deploy more measures
to beat deflation and that policy makers in the U.S. and  China 
remain on standby to support growth.  Thai rubber free-on-board gained for a sixth day yesterday,
rising 1.2 percent to 84.55 baht ($2.89) a kilogram, according
to Rubber Research Institute of  Thailand .  To contact the reporter on this story:
