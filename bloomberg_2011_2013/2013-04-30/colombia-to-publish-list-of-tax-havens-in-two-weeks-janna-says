Colombia will publish a list of tax
havens within two weeks, clearing the way for investors not
based in such jurisdictions to obtain lower tax rates on locally
sold government bonds.  Some investors may have been waiting to see if their
jurisdictions would be included on the list, Public Credit
Director Michel Janna said in an interview. Under a law that
took effect Jan. 1, investors from tax havens must pay a 25
percent tax on profits from the local bonds, while those who
aren’t covered are eligible for a 14 percent rate. The tax was
previously 33 percent for all foreign investors.  President Juan Manuel Santos cut the tax rate as the Andean
country sought to reduce borrowing costs by attracting more
foreign investors to the local debt market. The Finance Ministry
is working to clarify how the withholding tax is charged to make
it “more clear and transparent,” Janna said. The clarification
will be ready within two months, he said.  “All decrees that help to clarify and to set a framework
for investors to be comfortable to invest in Colombia is always
a positive step to take,” said Janna, 33, who assumed his post
on April 1 after working as head of sovereign risk for the
Americas for Goldman Sachs Group Inc. “We hope more investors
will come in and to have a more diversified investor base.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
