Former  New Jersey Devils  forward
Brian Rolston retired today, ending a 17-year National Hockey
League career that began with the franchise’s first  Stanley Cup 
championship.  Rolston, 40, announced the decision today in an e-mailed
statement through the NHL Players’ Association. He retires with
342 goals and 419 assists in 1,256 regular-season games.  “Getting the chance to play the game I love for 17 years
has truly been a dream come true,” Rolston said in the release.
“My career has taken me to many great places where I had the
privilege to play with some exceptional teammates and in the
best league in the world.”  Rolston was selected by the Devils with the No. 11 draft
pick in 1991 and broke into the league with the team during the
1994-95 season, helping New Jersey to the Stanley Cup title. He
was traded to the  Colorado Avalanche  in 1999, and was dealt four
months later to the  Boston Bruins .  The 2000-01 season, Rolston’s first full year in Boston,
marked the start of seven consecutive campaigns with 48 or more
points with the Bruins and Minnesota Wild. An All-Star in 2007,
he returned to the Devils in 2008, before finishing his career
with the  New York  Islanders and Bruins in 2011-12. He didn’t
play in the most recent NHL season.  “I really enjoyed playing with Brian over the course of
nine seasons,” Devils goaltender  Martin Brodeur  said in the
release. “As a player, he was instrumental in a lot of the
success we had in New Jersey, including our first Stanley Cup,
and I can’t say enough about the leadership and passion he
brought to our team.”  Rolston represented the U.S. in three Winter Olympics,
winning a silver medal in 2002 at Salt Lake City.  To contact the reporter on this story:
