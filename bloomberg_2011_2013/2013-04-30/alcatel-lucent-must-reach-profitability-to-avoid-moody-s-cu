Alcatel-Lucent SA (ALU)  risks having its
debt rating cut by Moody’s Investors Service if the French phone
network equipment vendor doesn’t return to profitability and
stop consuming cash in the second half of the year.  Moody’s today said the Paris-based company’s first-quarter
results, including a negative operating margin of 5.5 percent,
didn’t relieve concerns about its earnings and cash flow. The
ratings agency expects Alcatel will meet the requirements to
preserve its B3 rating, the sixth highest non-investment grade,
by the end of the year by improving results in coming quarters.  “We continue to expect Alcatel-Lucent to be in a position
to meet the requirements for the current rating this year,
which, however, requires sequentially improving quarterly
results going forward,” Roberto Pozzi, Moody’s vice president
and technology analyst, wrote in an e-mailed commentary.  Alcatel-Lucent, which in February named Michel Combes as
its new Chief Executive Officer, last week reported a fourth
straight quarterly loss as its cash pile shrank by half a
billion euros. Combes, in the midst of a strategy review to end
losses, has said he will share his conclusions in early summer.  “If the group does not achieve a material turnaround of
its profitability and free cash flow in the second half of the
year the likelihood of a downgrade is increasing,” Pozzi wrote.
The company’s B3 rating is based on the expectation Alcatel will
achieve an operating margin of about 5 percent this year and
burn less than 500 million euros of cash, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
