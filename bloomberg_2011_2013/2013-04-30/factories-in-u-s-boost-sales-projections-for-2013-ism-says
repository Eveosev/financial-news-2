Manufacturers in the U.S. are more
optimistic about sales and spending this year than they were at
the end of 2012, while service providers were less upbeat,
according to a semiannual survey by the  Institute for Supply
Management .  Purchasing managers at factories anticipate sales will grow
4.8 percent in 2013, up from the 4.6 percent they forecast in
December, and  business investment  will rise 9.1 percent, more
than the prior projection of 7.6 percent, the Tempe, Arizona-
based group’s survey showed today. By contrast, service
providers estimate revenue growth of 3.5 percent this year, less
than their December forecast of 4.3 percent, the ISM said.  “With 17 out of 18 industries within the manufacturing
sector predicting growth in 2013 over 2012, U.S. manufacturing
continues to demonstrate its broad-based strength, efficiency
and leadership in the world economy,” Bradley Holcomb, chairman
of the group’s factory committee, said in a statement.  According to ISM’s survey, purchasing managers at service
providers projected a 3.6 percent increase in 2013  capital
spending , down from a 7 percent gain.  The outlook for employment was little changed compared with
the December survey. Service providers still forecast a 1.3
percent increase in staff by the end of 2013, today’s report
showed.     Manufacturers projected a 0.9 percent rise in
employment, compared with a prior forecast of 0.8 percent.  First Quarter  The economy grew at a 2.5 percent annualized rate in the
first quarter, less than the median forecast of economists
surveyed by Bloomberg and limited by a drop in defense outlays,
figures showed last week.  Consumer spending  gained 3.2 percent,
the most since the fourth quarter of 2010 and boosted by outlays
on utilities because of colder-than-normal weather.  Recent reports indicate the economy is getting less of a
boost from business investment as $85 billion in automatic
budget cuts that began March 1 take effect. Corporate spending
on equipment and software grew at a 3 percent pace from January
through March, after an 11.8 percent rate the prior quarter,
according to the GDP report.  The ISM group may report tomorrow that its manufacturing
index was little changed at 50.7 in April after 51.3 a month
earlier, according to the Bloomberg survey median. The group’s
services gauges, due on May 3, may come in at 54 after 54.4,
economists predicted. Index readings greater than 50 signal
growth.  To contact the reporter on this story:
