Light Louisiana Sweet crude
weakened against heavier grades, making it more difficult for
refiners to make money running cokers.  LLS, the benchmark light, sweet crude on the U.S. Gulf,
slipped 15 cents to a  premium  of $4.69 a barrel over Maya crude
from  Mexico , at 11:48 a.m., according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The gap between the two averaged $6.34 a barrel in
April, below an $11.55 mark over the past year and the lowest
monthly average since January 2012.  Refineries on the  Gulf Coast  have built cokers to crack
residual  fuel oil  into lighter, more valuable products, allowing
them to run more of the less expensive, heavier crudes like
Maya.  The shrinking spread has reduced refining margins for Gulf
Coast cokers.  Valero Energy Corp. (VLO) ’s cokers are “breaking
even,” Chief Executive Officer  Bill Klesse  said today during
the company’s quarterly earnings call. Refineries may consider
reducing coker rates and instead making asphalt, Klesse said.  “If we can make asphalt at some of our plants, like  Corpus
Christi , you’d make asphalt,” Klesse said. “Then you have a
spare coker, so you have optionality. Then you look at your fuel
oil economics, and so we would balance those as well. So yes,
you could spare your coker.”  LLS widened its  premium  to the U.S. benchmark crude, West
Texas Intermediate in Cushing,  Oklahoma , by 20 cents to $10.80 a
barrel. Heavy Louisiana Sweet strengthened by 35 cents to an
$11.35-a-barrel premium to WTI.  Mars Blend strengthened by 5 cents to a $6.65-a-barrel
premium. Poseidon weakened by 20 cents to $6.05. Southern Green
widened its premium 30 cents to $5.30. Thunder Horse crude saw
its premium shrink 35 cents to $8.90.  To contact the reporter on this story:
