Midwest gasoline’s discount to
futures narrowed to the  smallest level  since Feb. 28 as
 HollyFrontier Corp. (HFC)  prepared for work at the Tulsa East refinery
in  Oklahoma  and  Northern Tier (NTI)  Energy LP conducted maintenance in
 Minnesota .  The 70,300-barrel-a-day Tulsa plant expects to perform work
on a crude unit, naphtha reformer, penex unit and isomerization
unit in May, the company said in a Feb. 26 earnings call with
investors. Julia Heidenreich, a company spokeswoman in  Dallas ,
declined today to comment on daily activities.  Northern Tier is said to be in a turnaround that includes
the No. 2 crude unit and hydrotreater at the 74,000-barrel-a-day
St. Paul Park plant. The work is expected to last until about
May 15, according to a person familiar with operations.  The  discount  for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in the
Group 3 area strengthened 3.38 cents to 0.75 cents a gallon
versus  New York  Mercantile Exchange futures at 2:25 p.m. The
area, part of PADD 2, stretches north from Tulsa, Oklahoma, to
Minnesota and North Dakota,  The turnarounds by HollyFrontier and Northern Tier may draw
from  area supplies , which are at the lowest level this year,
according to the Energy Information Administration. Stockpiles
of gasoline fell 1.1 million barrels to  52.5 million  in the week
ended April 19, the least since Dec. 28, the Energy Department’s
statistical arm reported.  The  3-2-1 crack spread  in Group 3, a rough measure of
refining margins for gasoline and diesel based on West Texas
Intermediate oil in Cushing, Oklahoma, fell 22 cents to $25.41 a
barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
