Invesco Ltd. (IVZ) , owner of the Invesco,
Van Kampen and PowerShares funds, said first-quarter profit rose
15 percent as record client deposits lifted assets.  Net income increased to $222.2 million, or 49 cents a
share, from $193.9 million, or 43 cents, a year earlier,
Atlanta-based Invesco said today in a statement. Excluding
certain items, earnings of 52 cents a share beat the 47 cents-a-
share average  estimate  of 20 analysts in a Bloomberg survey.  Chief Executive Officer Martin Flanagan has used
acquisitions to broaden Invesco’s offerings beyond traditional
stock and bond mutual funds since taking over in 2005. Invesco
took in a net $19.2 billion in the past three months, the most
ever for a single quarter, including $8.4 billion into its
active funds. Loren Starr, Invesco’s chief financial officer,
said while he was pleased with client deposits in April, he
expects the pace of new money to slow down this quarter.  “We certainly don’t expect to see the same pace of inflows
continuing in the second quarter,” Starr said in an interview.  Invesco announced results before the start of regular U.S.
trading. Its shares rose 14 percent this year through yesterday,
compared with a 18 percent gain by Standard & Poor’s 20-company
 index  for asset managers and custody banks.  Legg Mason  Legg Mason Inc. (LM) , the Baltimore-based money manager that
appointed a new chief executive office in February, said today
that fiscal fourth-quarter profit fell 62 percent as client
withdrawals from its stock and bond funds continued.  BlackRock Inc. (BLK) , the world’s largest asset manager, said
April 16 its first-quarter net income rose 10 percent as the New
York-based company attracted $40.5 billion in net deposits. T.
Rowe Price Group Inc., based in Baltimore, on April 24 reported
first-quarter revenue that increased 22 percent, helped by the
best mutual-fund deposits in six years.  Invesco’s assets climbed 6 percent in the three months
ended March 31 to $729.3 billion, according to preliminary
figures reported by the company on April 9, matching the rally
in global stocks as measured by the MSCI AC World Index.  Sixty-one percent of Invesco’s long-term mutual funds rank
in the top half of their peer groups for returns over the last
three years, according to research firm  Morningstar Inc. (MORN)   Unit Sale  The firm said earlier this month it had agreed to sell its
Atlantic Trust Private Wealth Management unit to Canadian
Imperial Bank of Commerce,  Canada ’s fifth-largest bank, for $210
million. Atlantic Trust manages about $20 billion for clients in
12 U.S. cities. The companies said they expect to complete the
deal in the second half of 2013.  The sale will reduce Invesco’s annual earnings by about 5
cents a share, Chief Financial Officer Loren Starr said in an
April 11 conference call with analysts. The company intends to
use the money raised to repurchase its own stock, offsetting the
dilution of earnings by 3 cents a share, Starr said.  (Invesco will hold a conference call at 9 a.m.  New York 
time. The call-in number is +1-866-617-1526 in the U.S. and
Canada, and +1-210-795-0624 elsewhere.)  To contact the reporter on this story:
