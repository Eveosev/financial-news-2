Thailand ’s state-owned  PTT Pcl (PTT)  has
purchased a liquefied natural gas spot cargo for June delivery
at around $14 per million British thermal units, according to a
company official.  PTT will buy the June cargo from a specific project
operator and not a portfolio seller, said the official who asked
not to be identified as he isn’t authorized to speak to the
media. The company is still evaluating the five offers it
received for a July-delivered shipment, he said.  PTT closed a third buy tender April 22 for two LNG cargoes
shipped in June and July to its Map Ta Phut terminal. In
January, the company bought four LNG spot cargoes delivered from
March to June.  PTT owns and operates the 5 million metric ton-a-year Map
Ta Phut terminal in Rayong that began operating in the third
quarter of 2011. It signed its first long-term contract with
Qatargas in December 2012 for 2 million tons of LNG annually for
20 years starting in 2015, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  PTT needs to buy as much as 2 million tons of spot LNG in
2013 to meet power-industry demand, the official said on April
12. The company has taken delivery of four spot LNG cargoes from
Qatar totaling 381,757 tons to date, according to customs and
ship tracking data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
