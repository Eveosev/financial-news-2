Indonesia ’s 10-year government
bonds advanced in April, snapping three months of declines, as
monetary easing in developed nations spurred inflows into the
nation’s debt. The rupiah declined for a second month.  Overseas investors pumped a net 14 trillion rupiah ($1.4
billion) into local-currency sovereign notes this month through
April 26, taking holdings to a record 294.7 trillion rupiah,
finance ministry  data  show. Foreign-currency reserves may rise
from a two-year low of $104.8 billion in March after the
government sold $3 billion of dollar bonds on April 8, with
investors submitting bids for more than four times the amount
offered, official data show.  The yield on the government’s 5.625 percent notes due May
2023 dropped nine basis points in April to 5.48 percent as of
9:20 a.m. in Jakarta, prices from the Inter Dealer Market
Association show. The yield was little changed today. That
compares with the 3.47 percent rate on similar-maturity
Philippine notes and 3.41 percent on Thai securities.  “The bonds turned around after the successful global
issuance, which improved confidence in investing in Indonesia as
it increases the reserves and the rupiah’s stability,” said
Dini Anggraeni, a fixed-income analyst at PT Mandiri Sekuritas
in Jakarta. “The rally may continue as yields remain
attractive.”  Bank of Japan  Governor Haruhiko Kuroda announced on April 4
a plan to buy 7.5 trillion yen ($77 billion) of debt a month,
almost as much as the  Federal Reserve ’s $85 billion of purchases.  Rupiah Weakens  The rupiah fell 0.1 percent this month and was little
changed today at 9,723 per dollar, prices from local banks
compiled by Bloomberg show. It traded at a 0.1 percent premium
to its one-month non-deliverable forwards, which advanced 0.4
percent in April and were steady today at 9,735, data compiled
by Bloomberg show.  A daily  fixing  used to settle the derivatives was set at
9,720 yesterday by the Association of Banks in  Singapore ,
compared with 9,719 on March 28. Today’s rate will be published
at 11:30 a.m. in the city-state.  One-month implied volatility for the rupiah, a measure of
expected moves in the  exchange rate  used to price options,
dropped 19 basis points, or 0.19 percentage point, in April to
5.55 percent. It fell 18 basis points today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
