Laurence Meyer , a former Federal
Reserve governor, said today that Fed Vice Chairman Janet Yellen
has the “right of first refusal” to become the next leader of
the central bank when Ben S. Bernanke’s term ends in January.  Meyer, speaking at a Bloomberg Link panel in Washington,
said it’s “a bit surprising” that Bernanke couldn’t manage his
calendar to allow him to take part in this year’s conference in
Jackson Hole, Wyoming.  Adam Posen, a former member of the Bank of England’s rate-
setting Monetary Policy Committee, when asked about a possible
alternative if Yellen does not get the top spot, said it “has
to be” former Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner.  To contact the reporter on this story:
