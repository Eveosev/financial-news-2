The cost of insuring corporate and
sovereign bonds in the Asia-Pacific region against non-payment
fell, according to traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx  Japan  index dropped 2 basis points to 81
basis points as of 9:04 a.m. in  Tokyo , according to Citigroup
Inc. prices. The benchmark has tumbled 78 basis points this year
and is poised to close at its lowest level since May 2008,
according to Citigroup and data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan decreased 3 basis points to 107 as of
9:00 a.m. in  Hong Kong , Deutsche Bank AG prices show. The gauge
is set to decline 15.3 basis points this month, according to
CMA, which is owned by McGraw-Hill Cos. and compiles prices
quoted by dealers in the private market.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index declined 3 basis points
to 104 basis points as of 9:37 a.m. in Sydney, National
Australia Bank Ltd. prices show. The gauge, which has ranged
from 102.3 to 127.5 since Dec. 31, is on track for its lowest
close since March 15, according to CMA.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
