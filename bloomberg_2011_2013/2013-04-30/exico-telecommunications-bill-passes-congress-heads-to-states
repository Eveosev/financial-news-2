Mexico ’s Senate passed a final
version of a bill to create more competition in
telecommunications, sending it to state governments for
approval.  The proposal, also backed by President Enrique Pena Nieto,
requires the signoff of a majority of legislatures in Mexico’s
31 states and capital. Under the bill, new government agencies
would have the power to force companies that control more than
50 percent of the market to share or even sell assets.  Lawmakers aim to increase investment and reduce prices in
the phone and pay-television industries and to create more
choice in broadcast TV. The proposal would create tougher
conditions for  America Movil SAB (AMXL) , which has 70 percent of
Mexico’s mobile-phone subscribers, and  Grupo Televisa SAB (TLEVICPO) , which
gets 70 percent of the nation’s broadcast-television audience.  The new law would allow foreigners to take majority stakes
in landline phone and cable networks for the first time. It also
calls for the creation of new TV broadcasters through government
auctions.  The bill was approved with the support of Mexico’s three
largest parties, making its approval at the state level likely.  To contact the reporters on this story:
