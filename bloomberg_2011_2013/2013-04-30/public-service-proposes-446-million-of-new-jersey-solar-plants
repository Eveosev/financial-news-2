Public Service Enterprise Group
Inc. (PEG)  reached an agreement with state regulatory staff to invest
as much as $446 million to build solar-power projects in  New
Jersey .  The utility plans to spend $247 million on 42 megawatts of
solar farms atop landfills and brownfields and another 3
megawatts of smaller projects through a program, Newark, New
Jersey-based Public Service said today in a statement. It also
will invest as much as $199 million on 97.5 megawatts of new
sun-powered systems through a separate program.  The investment will occur over three years, compared with
an earlier five-year plan.  The proposal is subject to public comment and the New
Jersey Board of Public Utilities is expected to issue a decision
by May 31.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
