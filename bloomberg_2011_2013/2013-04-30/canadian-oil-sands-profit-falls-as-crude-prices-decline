Canadian Oil Sands Ltd. (COS) , the
Calgary-based company that gets all of its production from
Syncrude Canada Ltd., said first-quarter profit fell 44 percent
on lower output.  Net income declined to C$177 million ($175 million), or 37
cents a share, from C$318 million, or 66 cents, a year earlier,
the company said in a statement today. Excluding a foreign
exchange loss, earnings per share were 1 cent less than the 42-
cent average of 10 analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  The company lowered its 2013 total production target 5
percent for the Syncrude mine and upgrader after “several
unplanned outages” resulted in lower-than-expected output in
the quarter, Marcel Coutu, chief executive officer, said in the
statement. The company now estimates Syncrude will produce
between 100 million and 110 million barrels for the year.  Canadian  Oil Sands  is the largest owner of Syncrude Canada,
a company that mines and processes oil sands into light crude in
 Alberta  and had about 4.6 billion barrels of reserves at the end
of last year. The other partners include  Cnooc Ltd. (883) ,  Murphy Oil
Corp. (MUR)  and  Imperial Oil Ltd. (IMO) , which manages the venture.  Hydrotreating Outages  Syncrude had unplanned outages in both the mining and
upgrading operations, which have been resolved, the company
said. The company is still investigating the cause of the
hydrotreating outages in the upgrader. Production fell 12
percent to 260,400 barrels a day.  Sales dropped 11 percent to C$961 million, from C$1.1
billion last year.  The upgrader turns heavy bitumen into a synthetic light
crude that can more easily flow down pipelines and be processed
in a refinery.  The earnings were reported after the close of regular
trading on North American markets. Canadian Oil Sands rose 2.3
percent to C$19.79 at the close in Toronto.  The stock, which has 2 buy, 11 hold and 5 sell
recommendations from analysts, has fallen 1.9 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
