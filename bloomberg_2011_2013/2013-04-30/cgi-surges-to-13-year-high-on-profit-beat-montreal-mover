CGI Group Inc. (GIB/A)  climbed to its
highest level since 2000 after the Canadian supplier of
technology to retailers and banks reported profit that beat
analysts’ estimates.  The stock rose as much as 16 percent, its biggest intraday
gain since May 31, and was trading at C$30.85 at noon in
Toronto. Before today, CGI had climbed 18 percent this year.  Profit excluding costs related to its 2012 purchase of
Logica Plc was 56 Canadian cents (56 cents) compared with the
average estimate of 49 cents in a Bloomberg survey of analysts.
Revenue climbed 137 percent to C$2.53 billion, helped by the
Logica acquisition, which gives it new revenue streams from
 Europe .  CGI, based in  Montreal , bought Logica to tap demand from
companies looking to invest in IT services to boost their
efficiency amid sluggish growth across the continent.  “I am very pleased with our overall performance and with
the excellent progress we have achieved in restructuring and
transforming our European and Asia Pacific operations,” Chief
Executive Officer Michael Roach said in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
