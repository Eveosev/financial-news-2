Iceland doesn’t have enough foreign
exchange to allow the creditors of failed  Kaupthing Bank hf ,
 Glitnir Bank hf  and  Landsbanki Islands hf  to swap their kronur
assets, central bank Governor Mar Gudmundsson said.  It’s “clear” that Iceland doesn’t have the means to
exchange as much as 450 billion kronur ($3.8 billion) into
foreign exchange, Gudmundsson said in a  report  published on the
bank’s website today.  “A speedy release of those assets, e.g. in relation to
composition agreements, can only take place” if creditors agree
on a “considerably lower” rate than the current onshore
exchange rate, he said.  Iceland imposed  capital controls  in 2008 after the three
banks defaulted on $85 billion in debt. The banks’ winding up
committees are lobbying to win exemptions from the controls as
they seek to complete composition agreements to repay the 450
billion kronur of domestic-currency assets trapped by the
collapse.  In total, about $8 billion has been tied up by the
controls, Arion banki hf estimates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
