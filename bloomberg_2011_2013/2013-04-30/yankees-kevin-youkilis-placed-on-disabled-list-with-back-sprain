New York  Yankees third baseman
Kevin Youkilis was placed on the 15-day disabled list with a
lower back sprain, the Major League Baseball team said in an e-
mailed statement.  Youkilis, 34, has missed eight of the team’s past nine
games with soreness in his lower back. He played most recently
on April 27 against the Toronto Blue Jays.  Yankees manager Joe Girardi said yesterday in a news
conference that an MRI test came back negative and that the
three-time All-Star would have an epidural shot to relieve the
pain.  Youkilis is batting .266 with two home runs and seven runs
batted in over 17 games this season. He played most of last
season with the Chicago White Sox after more than eight years
with the Boston Red Sox.  Youkilis missed 14 games with back stiffness in 2011 and
another 22 games last season for the same reason, according to
MLB.com.  Second baseman Corban Joseph has been recalled from the
Yankees’ Triple-A minor-league affiliate to take Youkilis’s
roster spot, the team said. Joseph, 24, has never played in a
major league game.  -- Editors: Michael Sillup, Rob Gloster  To contact the reporter on this story:
