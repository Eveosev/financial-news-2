European stocks  declined, paring an
11th straight month of gains, as a report showed business
activity in the U.S. unexpectedly shrank this month.  Lonmin Plc tumbled 5.7 percent after shuttering a South
African platinum furnace. Fiat Industrial SpA sank the most in
11 months after cutting its 2013 earnings target.  UBS (UBSN)  AG surged
the most in six months as profit exceeded analysts’ projections.
Deutsche Bank AG rallied the most since September after
 Germany ’s largest lender announced plans to raise as much as
$6.5 billion in capital.  The Stoxx  Europe  600 Index fell 0.2 percent to 296.72 at
the close of trading, after earlier climbing as much as 0.5
percent. The gauge has still risen 1 percent in April,
completing the longest stretch of monthly gains since 1997 amid
speculation central banks will add to stimulus efforts. The
measure has climbed 6.1 percent this year.  “The U.S. has been slightly hindered by negative news flow
that we think will correct itself in a few months,” Richard Scrope, who helps oversee about $160 million as  fund manager  at
Oriel Asset Management LLP in  London , said in a phone interview.
“We’ll always see a short-term reaction in European markets to
U.S. data. Within Europe, the data has been weak and
unemployment is growing, which puts more pressure on the ECB to
cut rates.”  Business activity in the U.S. shrank in April for the first
time in more than three years. The MNI Chicago Report’s  business
barometer  fell to 49, the lowest since September 2009, from 52.4
last month. A reading less than 50 signals contraction. The
median forecast of 51 economists surveyed by Bloomberg was 52.5.  Fed Meeting  The U.S. Federal Reserve began a two-day policy meeting
today. Policy makers may shift discussion away from when to
reduce monetary stimulus, given data showing the economy is
weakening, Pacific Investment Management Co.’s Mohamed A. El-
Erian said yesterday.  The  European Central Bank  will cut its benchmark  interest
rate  to a record low of 0.5 percent on May 2, according to 44 of
70 projections compiled by Bloomberg. One economist in the
survey predicted a half-point reduction to 0.25 percent.  A report today showed the euro-area  jobless rate  rose to a
record 12.1 percent in March.  National benchmark indexes climbed in 13 of the 18 western
European markets today, including  Sweden , which closed early for
a public holiday. Germany’s DAX rose 0.5 percent, while the
U.K.’s FTSE 100 declined 0.4 percent and  France ’s CAC 40 fell
0.3 percent.  Volume Gains  The volume of shares changing hands in Stoxx 600-listed
companies was 11 percent greater than the 30-day average,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Lonmin retreated 5.7 percent to 269 pence, the biggest drop
in two weeks. The world’s third-largest platinum producer
suspended production at its Number Two furnace at Marikana in
northwestern  South Africa  following an unspecified incident.  A gauge of commodity producers was the  worst performer 
among 19 industry groups in the Stoxx 600. Randgold Resources
Ltd. fell 4.1 percent to 5,060 pence and Anglo American Plc
dropped 2.7 percent to 1,565 pence.  Fiat Industrial sank 5.3 percent to 8.57 euros, the most
since May 23 last year. The truck and tractor maker cut earnings
and sales targets for 2013 as a recession in Europe led to a
first-quarter loss at its Iveco vehicle unit.  UBS Earnings  UBS rallied 5.7 percent to 16.60 Swiss francs as
 Switzerland ’s largest bank reported first-quarter net income of
988 million francs ($1.06 billion) because of higher revenue at
the investment bank and the wealth-management business. That
beat the 412.3 million-franc average estimate of nine analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg.  Deutsche Bank surged 6.1 percent to 34.91 euros. The bank
announced plans to raise capital even after co-Chief Executive
Officer Anshu Jain said a share sale wasn’t in investors’
interests three months ago. It also said first-quarter  net
income  rose to 1.65 billion euros, exceeding the 1.21 billion-
euro average estimate of six analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  JPMorgan Chase & Co. upgraded Deutsche Bank to  overweight ,
the equivalent of a buy rating, from neutral. Analysts at Royal
Bank of  Canada  and Nomura Holdings Inc. also raised their
recommendations.  BP Plc increased 2.1 percent to 466.4 pence, its largest
gain in three months. Europe’s second-largest oil company
reported earnings, adjusted for one-time items and inventory
changes, of $4.2 billion pounds, beating the  average estimate  of
$3.2 billion from 11 analysts in a Bloomberg survey.  Lloyds Gains  Lloyds Banking Group Plc added 1.6 percent to 54.33 pence.
Britain’s biggest mortgage lender said pretax profit almost
tripled in the first quarter to 1.48 billion pounds ($2.3
billion) as impairments for souring loans dropped by more than
analysts had estimated. Provisions fell 40 percent to 1 billion
pounds, the bank said in a statement.  Carphone Warehouse  Group Plc soared 15 percent to 235
pence, the biggest gain since it split off TalkTalk Telecom
Group Plc in 2010. Best Buy Co., the world’s largest consumer
electronics retailer, agreed to sell its 50 percent stake in its
European mobile-phone venture with Carphone Warehouse to the
U.K. company for 500 million pounds.  To contact the reporters on this story:
