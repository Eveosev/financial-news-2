The Green Investment Bank, set up
by the British government to help finance offshore wind and
waste-to-energy plants, plans to make joint investments with
Masdar,  Abu Dhabi â€™s state-owned renewable energy company.  The two institutions will sign a memorandum of
understanding tomorrow to explore joint investments in U.K.
clean energy projects over the next seven years, the bank said
today in a Regulatory News Service statement.  The green bank was set up last year with 3 billion pounds
($4.6 billion) of capital to help stimulate investment in wind,
biomass and other projects that cut the carbon output of the
U.K. energy mix. Britain is striving to slash CO2 emissions by
34 percent in 2020 from 1990 levels.  To contact the reporter on this story:
