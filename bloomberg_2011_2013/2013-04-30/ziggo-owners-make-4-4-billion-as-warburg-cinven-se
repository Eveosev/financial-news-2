John Malone ’s  Liberty Global Inc. (LBTYA) 
owns a 15 percent stake in Dutch cable-television operator  Ziggo
NV (ZIGGO) , according to a regulatory filing.  About 30 million Ziggo shares were owned by Liberty Global
as of April 26, a filing on the Dutch financial markets
regulator’s website showed today. Ziggo NV owners Warburg Pincus
LLC and Cinven Ltd. sold about 34 million of their shares that
day in a deal that raised 875.5 million euros ($1.1 billion).  Liberty Global “could well acquire Ziggo over the next 24
months,” Emmanuel Carlier, a Brussels-based analyst at ING
Groep NV, wrote in a note today. In March, Malone’s cable giant
bought a 12.7 percent stake in Ziggo from  Barclays Plc (BARC)  after the
British bank failed to find enough buyers in a share sale.  Ziggo  shares  rose 0.4 percent to 27.14 euros at 14:34 p.m.
in Amsterdam.  The European Union approved Liberty Global’s acquisition of
U.K. cable provider  Virgin Media Inc. (VMED)  for $16 billion this
month, the biggest media transaction since 2007. The Englewood,
Colorado-based company has been acquiring European cable assets
to expand in the continent’s pay-TV market.  To contact the reporters on this story:
