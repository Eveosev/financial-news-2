Edison International (EIX)  has spent $553
million on costs associated with its San Onofre nuclear power
plant in Southern California that’s been shut for more than a
year with damaged steam generators.  Costs for repairs and inspections climbed to $109 million
and replacement power expenses rose to $444 million through
March 31, Rosemead, California-based Edison said today in an
investor slide presentation.  Edison is seeking federal permission to restart one of its
reactors on June 1 at reduced capacity to avoid shaking damaged
pipes. San Onofre, located 60 miles (97 kilometers) south of Los
Angeles, has been shut since January 2012 after Edison found
unusual wear on steam generator tubes.  State regulators opened a probe last year to decide whether
Edison can cover the costs of its reactors, which produce about
2,200 megawatts of electricity. The steam generators were
supplied by Tokyo-based  Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd. (7011)   To contact the reporter on this story:
