The developer of the Shard won Duff
& Phelps Corp. as its first office tenant about 10 months after
the  London  skyscraper opened, two people with knowledge of the
matter said.  The financial advisory and investment banking firm agreed
to lease about 20,000 square feet (1,860 square meters) of space
from Sellar Property Group Ltd., said the people, who asked not
to be identified because the talks are private. The Shard, the
tallest building in western  Europe , has more than 589,000 square
feet of office space.  Duff & Phelps, based in New York, and Sellar Property
couldn’t immediately be reached for comment.  Irvine  Sellar is
chairman of the U.K. company.  Sellar bought out Transport for London’s contract to rent
about a third of the skyscraper in 2010, hoping for higher
rents. It hadn’t signed any tenants since, hampered by a decline
in demand for prime  office space  in London. The market has
picked up this year, according to broker CBRE Group Inc.  The Qatar Central Bank owns about 95 percent of the Shard,
which was completed in 2012.  Jones Lang LaSalle Inc. (JLL)  and Knight Frank LLP advise Sellar
on getting tenants for the offices up to the 28th floor. A five-
star Shangri-La Hotel occupies floors 34 to 52 with luxury homes
up to level 65.  Estates Gazette reported the news earlier today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
