U.K. stocks  declined, even as the
 FTSE 100 (UKX)  and FTSE All-Share Indexes both posted their longest-
ever streaks of monthly gains, as mining companies fell and a
report showed U.S. business activity shrank this month.  Commodity producers contributed the most to the FTSE 100’s
decline as BHP Billiton Ltd. and Rio Tinto Group, the world’s
biggest mining companies, lost more than 1.5 percent.  BP Plc (BP/) ,
 Europe’s second-largest oil company , climbed the most in three
months, while  Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY) , Britain’s biggest
mortgage lender, rose to its highest price in two months.  The FTSE 100 slipped 27.9 points, or 0.4 percent, to
6,430.12 at the close in London, erasing an advance of as much
as 0.4 percent. The equity benchmark still added 0.3 percent in
April, for its longest stretch of monthly gains since 1984. The
broader FTSE All-Share also climbed 0.3 percent this month,
increasing for an 11th month for the first time since the index
was formed in 1962.  “We have a neutral positioning in the U.K. and have become
more cautious as it’s trending close to its long-term average,”
said James Butterfill, who helps oversee 29 billion pounds ($45
billion) as head of global equity strategy at Coutts & Co. in
 London . “Support for U.K. equities is coming from earnings
outstripping expectations so far, and by a considerable margin
on the bottom line in some cases.”  The FTSE 100 trades at 12.1 times estimated annual
earnings, compared with a seven-year average of 11.3 times, and
a November 2008 low of 6.6 times projected annual earnings.  Earnings Season  Six of the seven FTSE 100 companies that have posted
quarterly earnings so far this results season have beaten
analysts’ estimates, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The number
of shares changing hands on FTSE 100-listed companies was 47
percent greater than the average of the past 30 days, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. Ireland’s ISEQ Index decreased
0.5 percent today.  In the U.S., Britain’s biggest trading partner, a report
showed  business activity  shrank in April, its first contraction
in more than three years. The MNI Chicago Report’s business
barometer fell to 49 in April from 52.4 in March. The median
forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg had called for a
reading of 52.5. A reading less than 50 signals contraction.  The European Central Bank will cut its interest rate to a
record low of 0.5 percent at a meeting on May 2, according to
the median forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg. The
U.S. Federal Reserve starts a two-day policy meeting today and
may consider renewing its commitment to bond buying. The Bank of
 England  meets next week.  Mining Companies  Commodity producers posted the biggest retreat of the 19
industry groups on the Stoxx  Europe  600 Index. Lonmin Plc
slumped 5.7 percent to 269 pence. The platinum producer said it
closed a furnace in South Africa after an unspecified incident.
BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto Group dropped 2.2 percent to 1,791
pence and 1.8 percent to 2,919 pence, respectively.  Anglo American Plc, the world’s biggest platinum producer,
lost 2.7 percent to 1,565 pence.  BP, the  third-heaviest  stock on the FTSE 100, gained 2.1
percent to 466.4 pence. The oil producer posted earnings,
adjusted for one-off items and inventory changes, of $4.2
billion in the first quarter, exceeding the $3.2 billion average
estimate of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. BP posted profit of
$4.7 billion in the year-earlier period using the same measure.  Lloyds, RBS  Lloyds added 1.6 percent to 54.3 pence as the lender
completed its biggest monthly advance since November. First-
quarter pretax profit almost tripled to 1.48 billion pounds from
a year earlier, according to a statement.  Analysts had predicted 
profit of 1.03 billion pounds.  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS)  surged 4.2 percent to
306.3 pence. Britain’s biggest government-owned lender will
report its first-quarter  earnings  on May 3.  Asos Plc (ASC)  added 4 percent to 3,200 pence.  Profit before
taxes  rose to 25.7 million pounds in the six months through
February, the U.K.’s largest internet-only retailer said.  Carphone Warehouse Group Plc (CPW)  surged 15 percent to 235
pence, the biggest rally since the company started trading as a
separate entity in March 2010. The retailer will pay 500 million
pounds for Best Buy Co.’s 50 percent stake in their European
mobile-phone joint venture, according to separate statements
from the two companies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
