Stephen Schwarzman , chief executive
officer of  Blackstone Group LP (BX) , said the world’s biggest
private-equity firm will hire 50,000 U.S. military veterans in
its portfolio companies by 2018.  “Men and women who have served our country, often on
foreign soil, sadly find a struggling economy and fewer jobs
upon their return,” Schwarzman said yesterday on a conference
call with reporters. “Our effort to hire more veterans makes
good business sense to us when you consider that our portfolio
of 80 companies employs more than 730,000 people.”  Schwarzman, who backed Republican Mitt Romney in last
year’s U.S. election, is set to join President Barack Obama,
first lady Michelle Obama, Vice President Joe Biden and Jill
Biden today at the White House to make the announcement as part
of the administration’s Joining Forces initiative, which
encourages the hiring of veterans in the private sector.  KKR &
Co. (KKR) , the buyout firm run by Henry Kravis and  George Roberts ,
started “Vets @ Work” in 2011, a program to hire more veterans
in its portfolio of companies, which employ more than 900,000
people.  Military members who served after the terrorist attacks on
Sept. 11, 2001, have an unemployment rate of 9.2 percent,
compared with 7.6 percent among the rest of the U.S., said Tina Tchen, chief of staff to Michelle Obama. Among veterans ages 18
to 24, the rate is 33 percent, Tchen said on the call.  Schwarzman said the hotels  owned  by Blackstone are seeking
managers and  SeaWorld Entertainment Inc. (SEAS) , which the firm took
public earlier this month, is looking for paramedics. Blackstone
owns Hilton Worldwide Inc.,  New York ’s Waldorf Astoria and the
San Diego area’s Hotel del Coronado.  “We’re in the business of taking bold risk in almost
everything we do,” said Schwarzman, who co-founded New York-
based Blackstone in 1985. “The only downside is that people
might not work out, and that’s a risk you have when you hire
anyone.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
