West Texas Intermediate crude fell,
capping a monthly drop, before a report that may show that U.S.
supplies climbed to a 22-year high. WTI’s discount to Brent oil
narrowed to less than $9 a barrel.  Futures retreated 1.1 percent, bringing the April decline
to 3.9 percent. Data from the Energy Information Administration
tomorrow will probably show stockpiles rose by  1.1 million
barrels  to 389.7 million last week, the most since July 1990,
according to a Bloomberg survey. A report showed U.S. business
activity unexpectedly shrank in April for the first time in more
than three years.  “It’s really hard to make a case for $100 WTI when we are
flush with oil,” said  Stephen Schork , president of the Schork
Group Inc. in Villanova,  Pennsylvania . “Crude oil supplies are
already at the second-highest level since World War II. There’s
plenty of crude on hand and some of that is going to be boiled
into gasoline.”  WTI crude for June delivery declined $1.04 to settle at
$93.46 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . Futures are
up 1.8 percent this year. The volume of all contracts traded was
9.3 percent above the 100-day average at 2:37 p.m.  Prices slipped after the  American Petroleum Institute 
reported U.S.  inventories  rose 5.18 million barrels last week to
388.4 million. Futures tumbled $1.56, or 1.7 percent, to $92.94
in electronic trading at 4:33 p.m. It was $92.97 before the
report was released at 4:30 p.m.  Brent Futures  Brent oil for June settlement fell $1.44, or 1.4 percent,
to $102.37 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe
exchange. Trading was 24 percent higher than the 100-day
average.  The European benchmark grade traded at a premium of $8.91
to WTI, down from $9.31 yesterday. The spread narrowed to $8.63
during trading, the least since Jan. 3, 2012.  “The spread has narrowed because of temporary Brent
weakness rather than because of any strength in WTI,” said
Julius Walker, global energy-markets strategist at UBS
Securities LLC in  New York . “I still expect Brent to rebound to
$110 this quarter and with that the spread will widen again.”  Production at the North Sea Buzzard oil field will resume
tomorrow after operations were halted yesterday, according to
the platform’s operator Nexen Inc. Buzzard makes up about half
of the Forties crude stream. Forties is one of four blends that
make up Dated Brent, which is used to price more than half of
the world’s oil. The others are Brent, Oseberg and Ekofisk.  Fuel Inventories  U.S. gasoline stockpiles probably dropped  900,000 barrels 
last week, according to the median of 11 analyst estimates in
the Bloomberg survey. Inventories of distillate fuel, a category
that includes heating oil and diesel, may have increased 250,000
barrels, according to the survey.  The MNI Chicago Report’s business  barometer  fell to 49 in
April, the lowest level since September 2009, from 52.4 last
month. A reading less than 50 signals contraction. The  median 
forecast of 51 economists surveyed by Bloomberg was 52.5.  Oil rose 1.6 percent yesterday on optimism that central
banks will boost stimulus. The  Federal Reserve  may consider
maintaining its bond-buying program at a two-day meeting
starting today. The  European Central Bank  may cut its main
refinancing rate to a record 0.5 percent on May 2, according to
the median of 70 economist estimates in a Bloomberg survey.  “We’re taking a bit of a breather after big moves
yesterday in a number of markets,” said Bill O’Grady, chief
market strategist at Confluence Investment Management in  St.
Louis , which oversees $1.4 billion. “Oil is moving on external
factors. This week we have the ECB and Fed meetings and then the
April jobs numbers on Friday.”  April Payrolls  The U.S. Labor Department is forecast to report a 148,000
gain in payrolls during April on May 3 after an increase of
88,000 in March, according to a Bloomberg survey.  OPEC  crude production climbed in April to a five-month
high, led by gains in  Saudi Arabia , the  United Arab Emirates  and
 Kuwait , according to a Bloomberg survey. Output in the
 Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries  rose 194,000
barrels, or 0.6 percent, to an average 30.948 million barrels a
day this month from a revised 30.754 million in March, the
survey of  oil companies , producers and analysts showed.  The 12-member producer group is due to meet on May 31 in
Vienna to review its output target.  Saudi Plans  Saudi Arabia, OPEC’s biggest producer, plans to boost
capacity to 15 million barrels a day by 2020, Prince Turki Al- Faisal said in an April 25 speech at  Harvard University  posted
on the university’s website yesterday. The country pumped 9.18
million barrels this month and is able to reach 12.5 million
within 30 days, according to the Bloomberg survey.  Saudi Oil Minister  Ali al-Naimi  disputed the prince’s
statements while speaking today at the Center for Strategic &
International Studies in  Washington .  “We don’t see the need to build capacity beyond what we
have today,” given increasing production from other nations
like the U.S., al-Naimi said.  Implied volatility for at-the-money WTI options expiring in
June was 23.6 percent, up from 22.8 percent yesterday.  Electronic trading volume on the Nymex was 530,786
contracts as of 4:34 p.m. It totaled 460,160 contracts
yesterday, 21 percent below the three-month average. Open
interest was 1.75 million contracts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
