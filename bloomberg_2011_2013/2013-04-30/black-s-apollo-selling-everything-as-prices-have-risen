Leon Black , chief executive officer
of buyout firm  Apollo Global Management LLC (APO) , said prices for
traditional buyouts have risen so much that it’s a good time to
sell.  “We think it’s a fabulous environment to be selling,”
Black said today during a panel discussion at the Milken
Institute conference in Los Angeles, adding that Apollo has sold
about $13 billion in assets in the last 15 months. “We’re
selling everything that’s not nailed down, and if we’re not
selling, we’re refinancing.”  U.S.  equity markets  have more than doubled from their 2009
lows, helping push up average prices for leveraged buyouts to
nine times earnings, Black said. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
rose to a record today as consumer confidence offset an
unexpected drop in business activity and investors weighed
earnings reports.  Black’s comments were echoed by buyout executives including
Scott Sperling, co-president of Thomas H. Lee Partners LP, and
Jonathan Sokoloff, managing partner at Leonard Green & Partners
LP.  “It has become more difficult to find transactions priced
at levels we’d like,” Sperling said on the same panel.  “We’re having trouble deploying capital at these  price
levels ,” Sokoloff said. It’s “time to take a pause.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
