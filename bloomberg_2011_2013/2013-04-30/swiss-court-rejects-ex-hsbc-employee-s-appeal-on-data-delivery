A Swiss court rejected an appeal by
a former lawyer at  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) ’s Swiss private bank
against the handover of his and other employee names to U.S.
authorities probing offshore tax evasion.  Eric Delissy’s plea to examine his complaint against HSBC,
the Swiss Federal Council and the financial services supervisor
Finma was denied, according to an e-mailed statement from the
Bellinzona, Switzerland-based Federal Criminal Court.  Delissy, head of legal at HSBC’s Geneva unit from 1998 to
2003, lodged his complaint on June 8 after the federal
government said Swiss banks were exempted from rules prohibiting
companies from sending evidence to assist foreign legal
proceedings. Switzerland’s prosecutor said Aug. 16 it wouldn’t
take up Delissy’s request to investigate the bank or the
authorities that backed the delivery of the information.  The U.S. is probing at least 11 Swiss financial firms
including HSBC,  Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN)  and  Julius Baer Group
Ltd. (BAER)  for allegedly helping Americans hide money from the
Internal Revenue Service. The banks turned over as many as
10,000 employee names to U.S. authorities in search of leniency,
Douglas Hornung, the Geneva-based lawyer who represented Delissy
and other bank staff, said Aug. 16.  The data transfer was an illegal violation of personal
privacy, Hornung said at the time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
