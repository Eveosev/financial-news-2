Boston Properties Inc. (BXP) , the biggest
U.S. office real estate investment trust, reduced its forecast
for 2013 funds from operations as it absorbed costs relating to
the hiring of a new chief executive officer.  The REIT estimated full-year FFO of $4.97 to $5.07 a share,
compared with January’s projection of $5.06 to $5.18. FFO for
the first quarter was $160.6 million, or $1.06 a share, down
from $166.7 million, or $1.12, a year earlier, the Boston-based
company said in a statement. The average estimate of 19 analysts
was $1.21 a share, according to  data  compiled by Bloomberg. FFO
gauges a property company’s ability to generate cash.  Owen Thomas , a former chairman of Lehman Brothers Holdings
Inc., replaced Mortimer Zuckerman as CEO on April 2. Zuckerman
remains executive chairman. Thomas had overseen the sale of
assets, including apartment operator Archstone Inc., to repay
creditors after Lehman filed for bankruptcy in 2008.  Boston Properties owns or has stakes in Boston’s John
Hancock Tower, Manhattan’s General Motors Building and other
office properties in  New York , Boston, Washington,  San Francisco 
and the Princeton area in New Jersey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
