Cineworld Group Plc (CINE) ’s acquisition
of City Screen Ltd. may reduce competition in five British
cities, a U.K. antitrust regulator said.  The Office of Fair Trading said the deal may lead to higher
prices and asked another regulator, the U.K. Competition
Commission, to review the transaction.  Cineworld, which operates multiplex theaters, said that the
two companies have very different identities, with City Screen
focusing on smaller, arthouse cinemas.  “We are not surprised by the decision because this is the
first time a complex cinema acquisition of this type (ie a
multiplex cinema chain acquiring an Independent cinema chain)
has been made,” the London-based company said in a statement.  “We believe the two businesses are fundamentally
different,” Cineworld said. “We run the two brands separately
and we are confident that we will be able to demonstrate that
local competition will not be reduced.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
