Pain Therapeutics Inc. (PTIE)  and  Durect
Corp. (DRRX) , partners with  Pfizer Inc. (PFE)  on the medicine Remoxy,
increased in New York trading after the world’s biggest
drugmaker highlighted the experimental painkiller’s future on a
conference call.  Pain Therapeutics surged 26 percent to $4.12 at the close
for the biggest one-day climb since November 2005. Durect rose
26 percent to $1.57 for its largest single-day gain since March
2009.  Remoxy is an extended-release oxycodone capsule for pain,
formulated to limit abuse. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration
postponed approval of the medicine in June 2011, after a delay
in 2008 when the regulators asked for more laboratory data.  “For Remoxy, we had a productive meeting with the FDA in
March and the guidance that we got out of that meeting is
certainly helping to inform the next steps,” John Young, head
of New York-based Pfizer’s primary care unit, said on a call
today with analysts and investors. “We believe we have a path
forward and we will publicly communicate further details over
coming quarters.”  Pfizer gained the drug in its $3.3 billion acquisition of
King Pharmaceuticals in 2011. Austin, Texas-based Pain
Therapeutics and Durect, in Cupertino, California, helped
develop the therapy and would get royalties on sales.  To contact the reporter on this story:
