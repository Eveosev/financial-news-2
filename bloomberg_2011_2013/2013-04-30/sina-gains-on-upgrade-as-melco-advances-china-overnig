Sina Corp. (SINA)  rose for a seventh day in
 New York , driving gains in the benchmark gauge of Chinese U.S.-
listed equities, after Jefferies Group Inc. upgraded the stock
on its e-commerce alliance with Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.  The Bloomberg China-US Equity Index of the most-traded
Chinese equities in the U.S. climbed 1 percent to 93.03
yesterday, rising 0.9 percent in April. Sina, which sold a stake
in its Twitter-like Weibo service to Alibaba,  China ’s biggest e-commerce company, posted the longest stretch of gains since June
2011, rising 2.3 percent to $56.32.  Vipshop Holdings Ltd. (VIPS) 
advanced to the highest in three weeks and  Melco Crown
Entertainment Ltd. (MPEL)  traded at a premium over Hong Kong for the
first time in three days.  Sina surged 16 percent last month, the biggest rally since
August, after the deal with Hangzhou, China-based Alibaba.
Jefferies lifted its stock to buy from hold yesterday, citing
revenue synergy from the partnership. Piper Jaffray & Co.  raised 
Sina’s price target by 15 percent, and at least six other
analysts reiterated buy recommendations.  “It’s a perfect situation, and the deal enhances the
outlook for Weibo’s monetization,” Tan Chiheng, an analyst at
Granite  Point Capital Inc. (PTCI)  in  Boston , which invests in Chinese
equities, said by phone. “Sina’s stock price still has upside
room to reach $70 at least, to match the valuation reflected in
the deal. The value also has the potential to go beyond the
initial financial investment.”  The  iShares FTSE China 25 Index Fund (FXI) , the largest Chinese
 exchange-traded fund  in the U.S., added 0.9 percent to $37.74 in
New York, rallying 2.2 percent in April after retreating in
March and February. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 0.2
percent to 1,597.57.  Manufacturing Data  China’s  Purchasing Managers ’ Index for manufacturing
 dropped  to 50.7 last month, according to the median estimate of
31 economists surveyed by Bloomberg before a government data
release today. The gauge rose to 50.9 in March, the first
increase this year.  The  Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  in  Hong Kong  climbed
1.2 percent to a one-month high of 10,917.97 yesterday. Markets
in Hong Kong and  Shanghai  are closed today for a holiday.  Alibaba, which runs the Taobao online shopping platform and
Alipay Internet payments, agreed to acquire about 18 percent of
Weibo from Sina for $586 million, with an option to increase the
stake to 30 percent, Sina said in an April 29 statement.  Jefferies analyst Cynthia Meng raised her sales projection
for Sina’s Weibo to $300 million in 2013 and $552 million in
2014, an increase of more than 100 percent from her previous
forecasts, according to a note yesterday. She also lifted the
price target for Sina’s shares to $75 from $50.  Weibo Valuation  Nomura Holding Inc. analyst Jin Yoon said Sina’s stock,
based on the Alibaba deal and an estimate of Sina’s stake in
Weibo, would be worth $71 per share, according to a research
report issued yesterday. Oppenheimer & Co. analyst Andy Yeung
said Sina’s share price should be trading in the range of $70 to
$100 given the new Weibo valuation in a note yesterday.  Vipshop, an online fashion discounter based in  Guangzhou ,
advanced 3.3 percent to $30.79 in New York, the highest price
since April 8.  Sohu.com Inc. (SOHU)  climbed 1.5 percent to $51.44 after
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. analysts lifted its price target by $2
to $57, while Piper Jaffray raised the goal to $45 from $37.  Melco’s Premium  Melco, which operates casinos in the Chinese territory of
Macau, climbed for the first time in three days, adding 1.7
percent to a record-high $24.61 in New York. The American
depositary receipts, each representing three underlying shares
in the company, traded 2.4 percent  above  Melco’s Hong Kong-traded stock, after posting discounts in the previous two days.  Craig-Hallum Capital Group LP issued a new buy rating to
Melco yesterday, setting a price goal of $31.  ADRs of Yanzhou, China’s fourth-largest coal mining
company, slipped 1.1 percent to a four-year low of $10.51. The
company, based in Shandong province, said first-quarter net
income tumbled 77 percent to 480.6 million  yuan  ($78 million) in
a statement to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange April 25.  China’s Bohai-Rim Steam-Coal Index, which tracks power-station coal prices at six Chinese ports, fell 0.3 percent to
613 yuan a ton in the week through April 24, according to the
Qinhuangdao Seaborne Coal Market website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
