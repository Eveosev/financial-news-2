General Electric Co. (GE)  hired
insurance industry investment banker Eric Solash for its global
operations group, where he will help infrastructure customers
raise financing from sources besides banks.  Solash left boutique advisory firm  Freeman & Co.  in March
to join Fairfield, Connecticut-based GE as a managing director,
according to an internal company announcement. He will focus on
non-bank funding that includes insurers, reinsurance companies,
pension funds, sovereign wealth funds and private equity, said
 Russell Wilkerson , a spokesman for the GE Capital unit.  GE hired a former JPMorgan Chase & Co. treasurer,  Mark
Kleinman , as a senior managing director last year to oversee a
new team that will help clients around the world finance
building projects, Wilkerson said.  Solash joined New York-based Freeman in 2007, according to
the companyâ€™s website. His previous experience includes working
at two closely held insurers, as a strategy consultant for
Ullico Inc. and head of mergers for Inviva Inc., according to
his Freeman biography.  To contact the reporter on this story:
