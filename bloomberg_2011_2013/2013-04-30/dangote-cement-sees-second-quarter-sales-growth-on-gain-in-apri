Dangote Cement Plc (DANGCEM) ,  Nigeria ’s
largest company and  Africa ’s biggest producer of the building
material, said second-quarter revenue will total 98.5 billion
naira ($623.3 million) as demand was “strong” this month.  Pretax profit will amount to 50.6 billion naira, the Lagos-
based company said today in an e-mailed statement. First-quarter
net income advanced 81 percent to 53.7 billion naira as the
tonnage sold increased 38 percent.  Dangote Cement, owned by billionaire Chairman  Aliko Dangote , has production capacity of 19.3 million metric tons in
Nigeria, with plans to increase that to 29 million tonnes by
2015. The second-quarter revenue forecast would be a 26 percent
jump from a year earlier, when the company posted 77.9 billion
naira in sales, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “The year has begun well for Dangote Cement and our 38
percent increase in volumes far outpaced the Nigerian market’s
strong growth of 16 percent,” Chief Executive Officer Devakumar Edwin said in the statement. “Our gas supply has been better
this year, and that has driven margins upwards from the first
quarter of 2012,” when two plants at the Nigerian locations of
Ibese and Obajana were starting operations.  A new plant in  Senegal  was unable to start production as
scheduled in the quarter because of a dispute over the land
title, Dangote Cement said. The company said it’s working on an
“acceptable solution” to the dispute that would allow the site
to begin operations within weeks.  Dangote Cement released figures after the Lagos market
closed. The  stock  gained 2.6 percent to 160.12 naira today. The
shares have risen 25 percent this year, outpacing the 19 percent
increase in the  Nigerian Stock Exchange All-Share Index. (NGSEINDX)   To contact the reporter on this story:
