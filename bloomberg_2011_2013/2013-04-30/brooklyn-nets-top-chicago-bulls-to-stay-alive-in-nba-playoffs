The Brooklyn Nets avoided
elimination from the National Basketball Association playoffs
with a 110-91 home win against the  Chicago Bulls , who still lead
the first-round playoff series by three games to two.  Brook Lopez scored 28 points and  Deron Williams  added 23
points and 10 assists for the Nets, who had lost the previous
three games in the series -- including a three-overtime defeat
in Game 4 two days ago.  Nate Robinson had 20 points and eight assists for the
Bulls. Robinson started tonight for Chicago in place of Kirk
Hinrich, who has a bruised left calf.  Game 6 in the best-of-seven series is set for May 2 in
Chicago.  Also tonight in the NBA, the Indiana Pacers try to take a
3-1 lead against the host  Atlanta Hawks  in their series and the
Oklahoma City Thunder seek to complete a four-game sweep of the
Houston Rockets.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
