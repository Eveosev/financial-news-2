Spansion Inc. (CODE) , a producer of flash
memory for electronics systems, agreed to buy  Fujitsu Ltd. (6702) ’s
microcontroller operations for $110 million to gain the
chipmaker’s employees, intellectual property and products.  Spansion will also pay about $65 million for inventory, the
Sunnyvale, California-based company said in a statement today.
The deal with Tokyo-based Fujitsu is expected to be completed
between July and September, it said.  Fujitsu, Japan’s biggest provider of computer services to
companies, is focusing on  information technology  including cloud
computing to weather a slump in chip sales used in televisions
and other electronics. Fujitsu also said it plans transfer 1,000
employees to Spansion.  A microcontroller is a chip that, for example, triggers air
bags in cars. Large-scale integration, or LSI, chips pack
several functions, including processing TV images, onto a single
semiconductor. Both are used in products from automobiles to
consumer electronics.  Fujitsu rose 0.3 percent to 409 yen in Tokyo trading,
before the announcement, extending this year’s gain to 14
percent. The benchmark Nikkei 225 Stock Average has risen 33
percent in 2013.  Separately, the company said it expects net income of 45
billion yen this fiscal year, after reporting a 72.9 billion yen
loss in the year ended March 31, according to a statement from
the company today. Sales will probably rise 3.8 percent to 4.55
trillion yen this fiscal year, after dropping 1.9 percent to
4.38 trillion yen in the previous 12 months.  Fujitsu, which also makes mobile phones and personal
computers, in February said it would merge its LSI chip business
with that of  Panasonic Corp. (6752)  The venture will design large-scale
integration, or LSI , and contract out their manufacture, the
companies said at the time  Fujitsu said in February it may move a  production line  in
Japan’s Mie Prefecture to a new chip foundry and is in talks
with  Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (2330)  to set up a
chipmaking venture.  To contact the reporter on this story:
