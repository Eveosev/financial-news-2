Marc Andreessen, co-founder of
venture-capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, said he has no plans
to follow other directors who are leaving  Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ)   “This is the company that built Silicon Valley and
deserves to be a glorious success story,” Andreessen said in an
interview on Bloomberg TV yesterday. “I’m going to stick with
it for as long as I could possibly be useful.”  Shareholder-advisory firm Glass Lewis & Co. had recommended
voting against Andreessen at the most recent annual meeting,
faulting him and some other directors for the $8.8 billion
writedown of Autonomy Corp. Andreessen was re-elected with about
70 percent of the vote in a shareholder meeting held on March
20, according a regulatory filing. Ray Lane stepped down as
Hewlett-Packard’s chairman, while G. Kennedy Thompson and John Hammergren are departing, the company said earlier this month.  Andreessen, 41, joined the board of Palo Alto, California-
based Hewlett-Packard in 2009, two years after the company
bought his software maker, Opsware Inc., for $1.6 billion. Best
known as the co-founder of Netscape Communications Corp.,
Andreessen said yesterday that his commitment to Hewlett-Packard
“triggers my stubborn gene.”  While Andreessen won a higher percentage of shareholder
support than Lane, Hammergren or Thompson, it was less than any
of the other seven board members received, according to the
filing.  Bloomberg LP, the parent of Bloomberg News, is an investor
in Andreessen Horowitz.  To contact the reporter on this story:
