Ternium SA (TX) , Latin America’s second-
largest steelmaker, rose the most in more than 15 months after
saying it won’t buy a steel plant from ThyseenKrupp AG in Rio de
Janeiro state in Brazil.  Ternium’s American depositary receipts rose 5.4 percent to
$22.90 at 11:01 a.m. in  New York  after gaining as much as 7.4
percent, the biggest intraday increase since Jan. 10, 2012. The
Luxembourg-based company extended its rising streak to nine
trading days, the most since November 2009.  Chief Executive Officer Daniel Novegil said during an
earnings conference call today that Ternium is no longer
interested in ThyssenKrupp’s Rio steel slabs plant, known as
CSA, because of its valuation and industry conditions in Brazil.
The company is assessing alternative growth options after
backing out of the bidding process for the asset, he said.  ThyssenKrupp, Germany’s biggest steelmaker, put its
Americas unit, including the Rio plant and a asset in Alabama,
on sale last year after rising costs and declining profits
prompted it to cut the value it books for the units by 3.6
billion euros ($4.7 billion). Ternium had made a binding bid for
the Brazilian plant, people familiar with the matter told
 Bloomberg News  earlier this month.  To contact the reporters on this story:
