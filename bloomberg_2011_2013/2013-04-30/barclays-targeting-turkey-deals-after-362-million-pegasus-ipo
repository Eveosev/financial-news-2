Barclays Plc (BARC) , the third-ranking
adviser on U.S. stock offerings in 2013, is targeting more deals
in Turkey after advising airline  Pegasus Hava Tasimaciligi AS (PGSUS)  on
the country’s largest initial public offering this year.  “We are actively pursuing a number of opportunities in
Turkey at present,” Ralf Nachtigall, co-head of  equity capital
markets  for Europe,  Middle East  and Africa at the London-based
bank, said in a telephone interview, without naming clients.  Barclays helped Pegasus sell 70 percent of 35.3 million
shares to international buyers in the IPO. The Istanbul-based
company sold a 34.5 percent stake for 649.4 million liras
($361.5 million), valuing it at 1.88 billion liras.  Pegasus, whose IPO was the fourth biggest in Turkey since
the beginning of 2011, hired Barclays and  Is Yatirim Menkul
Degerler AS (ISMEN) , Turkey’s biggest broker, to manage the IPO. Is
Yatirim was hired to sell 30 percent of the offered shares to
investors in Turkey. The sale was 2.2 times oversubscribed
locally and 1.8 times internationally, according to Is Yatirim.  Turkish Aerospace Industries, the state-owned maker of
aircraft parts, plans to sell at least 20 percent of the company
in an IPO this year, in a transaction valuing the company at $3
billion, Chief Executive Officer Muharrem Dortkasli said last
year. The company hired Is Yatirim for the sale, he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
