Franklin Resources Inc. (BEN) , manager of
the Franklin and Templeton mutual funds, said fiscal second-
quarter profit rose 14 percent as gains in global stock markets
increased assets under management.  Net income for the three months ended March 31 climbed to
$572.8 million, or $2.69 a share, from $503.2 million or $2.32,
a year earlier, the  San Mateo , California-based company said
today in a statement. Franklin was expected to earn $2.51 a
share, according to the  average estimate  of 12 analysts surveyed
by Bloomberg.  Chief Executive Officer Gregory Johnson has been urging
investors to put more money into stock funds, arguing that
equities are likely to deliver better returns than they did in
the past decade. With a lineup that is split between stocks and
bonds, Franklin can benefit no matter what choices investors
make, said  Michael Kim , an analyst with Sandler O’Neill &
Partners LP in  New York .  “They have scale, diversification and a global
footprint,” Kim said in a telephone interview before earnings
were announced. “It is a franchise that can grow even in
uncertain times.”  Franklin shares rose 0.7 percent to $156.17 at 9:43 am in
New York trading. Before today, Franklin’s stock rose 23 percent
this year compared with a gain of 18 percent for the 20-member
 Standard & Poor’s  index of asset managers and custody banks.  Investor Deposits  Franklin had 39 percent of its assets in stocks and 45
percent in bonds at the end of the first quarter, according to
company data. Assets at the firm rose 5.4 percent during the
first three months of 2013, compared with the 6 percent gain in
the MSCI All-Country World Index of stocks.  Franklin attracted $18.3 billion in net new deposits in the
quarter, the most money it has received since the quarter ended
June 30, 2011, according to the company. Of the total, $15.6
billion was in fixed-income, $2.8 billion was in funds that buy
both stocks and bonds and $200 million was in equities. Sales
were strong in the U.S. and internationally, Johnson said in
pre-recorded remarks.  In recent years, Franklin’s growth has been driven by the
popularity of its $71 billion  Templeton Global Bond Fund. (TPINX)  Run by
 Michael Hasenstab , the fund attracted $17.6 billion in 2010 and
$13.4 billion in 2011, data from Chicago-based  Morningstar Inc. (MORN) 
show. Deposits dropped to $2.1 billion last year following
subpar performance in 2011 when Hasenstab trailed 91 percent of
competitors. Investors rewarded the fund with $3.6 billion in
the first three months of 2013, according to Morningstar, after
it returned 16 percent in 2012, better than 90 percent of
rivals.  Income Fund  Franklin’s largest mutual fund, the $75 billion  Franklin
Income Fund, (FKINX)  a mix of stocks and bonds, attracted $1.5 billion
in deposits in the first quarter, Morningstar data show. The
fund topped 88 percent of peers over the past five years,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Franklin has also expanded in alternative investments,
agreeing in September to pay about $183 million for a majority
stake in K2 Advisors Holdings LLC, a fund-of-hedge-fund manager
with $9.3 billion in assets. Starting in 2016, Franklin will
acquire the rest of  Stamford , Connecticut-based K2 over a period
of several years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
