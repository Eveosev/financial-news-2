Serbia set May 31 as the new
deadline in the tender for Galenika AD, giving a unit of
 Canada â€™s  Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc (VRX)  another month
to make an offer for the state-owned drugmaker.  The third extension since offers were first invited on Jan.
15 comes more than two weeks after the government narrowed its
choice of potential investors to Valeant Pharmaceuticals North
America Llc, expecting a proposal by today, the  Finance and
Economy Ministry  said on its  website .  Serbia has sought a strategic partner for Galenika among
drug makers with operating revenue of at least 200 million euros
($261 million) in 2011. Galenika, based in Zemun, near the
capital Belgrade, narrowed its loss in 2012 to 5.6 billion
dinars ($66.2 million) from 13.5 billion dinars a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
