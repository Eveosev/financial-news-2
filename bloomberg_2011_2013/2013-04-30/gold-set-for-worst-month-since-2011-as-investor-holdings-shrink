Gold headed for the biggest monthly
loss since December 2011, as assets in bullion-backed exchange-
traded products shrank by the most on record, countering an
increase in demand for physical metal.  Bullion for immediate delivery fell as much as 0.5 percent
to $1,469.05 an ounce, and traded at $1,470.63 by 11:54 a.m. in
 Singapore . Gold is set for an 8 percent slide in April after it
plunged into a  bear market . Prices sank 14 percent in the two
days to April 15, the most since 1983. Gold for June delivery
rose 0.2 percent to $1,469.80 an ounce on the Comex in  New York .  Gold ETP holdings  declined  168.22 metric tons in April,
heading for the biggest monthly drop on record in tonnage terms,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. While prices recovered
11 percent from a two-year low of $1,321.95 on April 16 as coin
and jewelry demand expanded, they’re still 5.8 percent below the
April 11 close that preceded the rout.  “Holders of gold exchange-traded funds continue to
liquidate holdings,”  James Steel , an analyst at HSBC Securities
(USA) Inc., wrote in a note. “May Day holidays across the globe
will limit trading volume and physical demand in precious
metals.”  Gold jumped 4.2 percent last week, the most in 15 months,
partly as coin demand from mints in the U.S. and  Australia  to
the U.K. soared after prices plummeted. The volume for the
benchmark contract on the Shanghai Gold Exchange surged to a
record last week, while premiums to secure supplies in  India 
jumped to five times the level before the slump. India and  China 
are the world’s largest consumers.  Silver fell 1.1 percent to $24.2995 an ounce, 15 percent
lower this month, the worst loss since December 2011. Platinum
slipped 0.5 percent to $1,502.80 an ounce, set for a third
monthly decline. Palladium rose 0.3 percent to $701.90 an ounce,
down 9.1 percent this month in the worst performance since May.  To contact the reporter for this story:
