The liquidator of  Bernard Madoff ’s
firm asked a judge to approve $50 million of fees and expenses
for his law firm’s work from July 1 through Nov. 30, according
to a federal court filing in Manhattan.  Irving Picard and his firm, Baker & Hostetler LLP, will
have charged total fees and expenses of about $440 million since
the confidence man’s December 2008 arrest, according to court
filings. The Securities Investor Protection Corp., which runs an
insurance fund to compensate investors for losses, pays the law
firm’s bills.  To contact the reporter on this story:
