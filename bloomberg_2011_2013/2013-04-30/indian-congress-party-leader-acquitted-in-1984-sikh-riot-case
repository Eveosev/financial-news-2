A senior member of  India ’s ruling
Congress party was acquitted of murder in a case tied to anti-
Sikh riots in 1984, a verdict that sparked protests outside the
court.  Sajjan Kumar, a former parliamentary lawmaker, is still on
trial in one other murder case, his lawyer, I.U. Khan, told the
CNN-IBN television channel, which broadcast images of Sikh
protesters clashing with police. A shoe was thrown at the judge
after he acquitted Kumar, the  Press Trust of India  reported.  The riots were triggered by the assassination of then Prime
Minister Indira Gandhi by her Sikh bodyguards, and were
allegedly orchestrated by members of her Congress party. They
left about 3,000 people dead in the capital  New Delhi .  Gandhi was assassinated after she ordered the army into
Amritsar’s Golden Temple, Sikhism’s holiest shrine, in June 1984
to clear it of armed Sikh separatists seeking an independent
nation.  A commission headed by Justice G.T. Nanavati named Congress
leaders including Kumar in its report made public in 2005 for
instigating crowds to attack Sikhs. Prime Minister  Manmohan Singh , a Sikh, the same year apologized to the Sikh community on
behalf of the government for the riots.  To contact the reporter on this story:
