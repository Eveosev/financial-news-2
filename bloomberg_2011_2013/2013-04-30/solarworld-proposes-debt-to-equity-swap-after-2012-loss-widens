Solarworld AG (SWV)  made a preliminary
agreement with most of its creditors that will allow  Germany ’s
biggest maker of solar panels to reduce its noncurrent
liabilities by about 60 percent.  Solarworld will propose a capital reduction of about 95
percent, combined with a capital increase against contribution
in kind to an extraordinary shareholders meeting, the Bonn-based
company said today in a statement today. The preliminary deal
was struck with creditors representing about 80 percent of
loans, it said.  As part of the capital increase, about 60 percent of
liabilities will be discharged by a debt-to-equity-swap,
Solarworld said. The deal is subject to the approval of
committees, it said.  “For the company and employees it’s good news that a
solution has been found for at least a part of its debt pie,”
Stefan Freudenreich, an analyst at Equinet Bank AG in  Frankfurt ,
said by phone. “For current equity holders it’s bad news as
they will loose almost everything.”  Solarworld, which yesterday said its 2012 net loss widened
55 percent to 476.9 million euros ($624 million), is among
companies battling competition mainly from Chinese producers
that saw solar panel prices drop by half in 2011 and another 24
percent last year. That tipped more than a dozen German
businesses including  Solar Millennium AG (S2M)  and Q-Cells SE, once
the largest solar-cell maker, into bankruptcy.  The shares gained as much as 6.1 percent after the
restructuring announcement before retreating 2.4 percent to 69
euro cents at 12:49 p.m. in Frankfurt. They’ve slumped 49
percent in six months.  Solarworld has 150 million euros of bonds maturing in 2016
and 400 million euros worth due in 2017, according to  data 
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporters on this story:
