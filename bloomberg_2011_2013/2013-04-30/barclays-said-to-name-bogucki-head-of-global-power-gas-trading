Barclays Plc (BARC)  appointed Managing
Director Robert Bogucki to the role of global head of power,
natural gas, emissions, coal and freight trading, two people
with direct knowledge of the matter said.  The appointment is part of the bank’s plan to split its
global energy group into two divisions, one for crude and oil
products and another unit covering electricity, gas, coal and
freight, said the people, who declined to be identified because
the information isn’t public. Bogucki will remain in charge of
G10  currency trading  in the Americas and  emerging markets 
currency trading in Latin America, one of the people said.  George Cultraro, the former head of global energy, will run
oil, according to the people. Both Cultraro and Bogucki report
to Mike Bagguley, head of commodities and foreign exchange, one
of the people said. Bogucki didn’t return a phone call and an e-
mail yesterday seeking comment. Bagguley didn’t immediately
return a phone call seeking comment.  The appointment and group split was yesterday reported by
SparkSpread.  To contact the reporters on this story:
