Japanese Deputy Economy Minister
Yasutoshi Nishimura defended the Bank of  Japan ’s “aggressive”
monetary policy and said the government’s growth strategy
includes “unprecedented” measures.  Japan’s central bank “has been equipped to carry out a
monetary easing policy comparable to those in other countries,”
Nishimura said today in a speech to the U.S.-Japan Research
Institute in Washington.  The goal of “Abenomics,” named for Japanese Prime
Minister Shinzo Abe, is to “rebuild the economic foundation so
that the Japanese economy can break free from long-term
deflation and start on a full-fledged path of growth,”
Nishimura said. “To do so, we will take some bold,
unprecedented steps that will change the landscape we see around
us.”  Japan has suffered falling prices in 11 of the last 14
years. The new Bank of Japan governor, Haruhiko Kuroda, this
month announced a doubling of monthly bond purchases in a bid to
reach 2 percent inflation in two years and revive the world’s
third-largest economy.  The  yen  rose 1.5 percent against the dollar last week to
98.05 per dollar. The currency touched a four-year low of 99.95
on April 11.  Nishimura said “aggressive monetary policy” is part of
the “three-pronged strategy of Abenomics” that also includes
flexible fiscal policy and stimulating private-sector
investment. He said the government projects nominal economic
growth of 2.7 percent and real growth of 2.5 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
