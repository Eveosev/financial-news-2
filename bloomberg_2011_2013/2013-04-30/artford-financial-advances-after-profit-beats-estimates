Hartford Financial Services Group
Inc. (HIG)  climbed in  New York  trading after profit beat estimates as
the insurer’s margins widened.  Hartford gained 3.2 percent to $28.09 at 4:15 p.m., the
biggest advance in the 24-company KBW Insurance Index. Shares of
Hartford, based in the Connecticut city of the same name, have
advanced 25 percent this year.  Core earnings, which exclude some investment results, were
92 cents a share in the first quarter, beating the 82 cent
 average estimate  of 17 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. The
insurer paid out 93.6 cents on claims and expenses for every
premium dollar it took in at the property-casualty unit, about 2
cents less than a year earlier, as the company benefited from
lower costs tied to natural disasters.  “Margins in both the commercial lines and personal lines
P&C businesses were robust,”  Jimmy Bhullar , an analyst at
JPMorgan Chase & Co. wrote in a research note. “Potential
acceleration of share buybacks could drive upside.”  Core earnings at the property-casualty unit rose 12 percent
in the first quarter to $318 million, and Hartford recorded a
gain after determining it had more funds set aside than
necessary for coverage sold in prior years. Chief Executive
Officer Liam McGee is focusing on property-casualty coverage,
after divesting a life insurance unit and ending variable-
annuity sales.  To contact the reporter on this story:
