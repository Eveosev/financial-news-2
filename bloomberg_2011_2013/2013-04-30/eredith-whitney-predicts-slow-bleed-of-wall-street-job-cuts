Job cuts on Wall Street will be a
“continued slow bleed” after the industry trimmed hundreds of
thousands of positions in recent years, said  Meredith Whitney , a
banking analyst and chief executive officer of Meredith Whitney
Advisory Group.  “There’s growth out there, but for the majority of
financials it’s an anemic growth environment,” Whitney told
Willow Bay today in a Bloomberg Television interview at the
Milken Institute conference in Los Angeles. “What you’re seeing
is stealth cuts.”  Whitney said she sees the “most upside” for  Bank of
America Corp. (BAC) , which started a cost-reduction process in 2010,
and added that  Citigroup Inc. (C)  CEO  Michael Corbat  is “doing what
should be done and identifying areas that should be cut.”  First-quarter results showed little or no revenue growth
for the biggest U.S. banks, Whitney said.  “What you did see was a focus on eking out the bottom line
through cost cuts,” she said. “This isn’t sexy stuff.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
