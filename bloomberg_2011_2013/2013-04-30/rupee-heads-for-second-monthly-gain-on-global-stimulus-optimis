India’s rupee headed for a second
monthly gain on speculation global central banks will extend
economic stimulus measures that have spurred capital flows into
 emerging markets .  The  Federal Reserve  begins a two-day policy meeting today
after a government report last week showed the  U.S. economy 
expanded less than analysts forecast. Most economists in a
Bloomberg survey predict the  European Central Bank  will cut
 interest rates  this week. The  Reserve Bank  of India will lower
its  repurchase  rate to 7.25 percent from 7.5 percent at a May 3
review, according to 25 of 31 economists in a Bloomberg survey.
Five see no change and one predicts a cut to 7 percent.  “The RBI’s policy should be growth-supportive and positive
for the rupee,” said Ashtosh Raina, head of foreign-exchange
trading at  HDFC Bank Ltd. (HDFCB) , India’s largest lender by market
capitalization. “Global liquidity has a large role to play in
the currency’s appreciation.”  The rupee advanced 0.2 percent in April this month to 54.16
per dollar as of 10:58 a.m. in Mumbai, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. It rose 0.1 percent and touched 54.1150
today, the strongest since April 25. One-month implied
volatility in the rupee, a gauge of expected moves in the
 exchange rate  used to price options, fell two basis points, or
0.02 percentage point, to 8.16 percent today. Indian markets
will be shut tomorrow for a local holiday.  Global funds bought a net $11 billion of Indian stocks and
$2.9 billion of rupee-denominated debt this year, exchange data
show. Ten-year sovereign bonds in India offer a yield  premium  of
609 basis points over similar-maturity U.S. Treasuries.  Hindustan Unilever  The rupee strengthened today after Unilever Plc, the
world’s second-largest consumer goods company, said it will
spend up to 292.2 billion rupees ($5.4 billion) to boost its
stake in its Indian unit. Unilever will pay 600 rupees a share
in an open offer to raise its stake in  Hindustan Unilever Ltd. (HUVR) 
to 75 percent from the current 52.48 percent, it said in a
statement today.  The local foreign-exchange market would “easily” absorb
fund inflows related to the stake purchase, HDFC’s Raina said.  Technical charts indicate the rupee’s gains will be  capped
at around 53.70, he said, as the nation runs a record current-
account deficit. The shortfall in the broadest measure of trade
was $32.6 billion in the quarter through December, according to
official data.  Three-month onshore rupee forwards traded at 55.15 per
dollar, compared with 55.21 yesterday, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Offshore non-deliverable contracts were
at 54.91 versus 55.02. Forwards are agreements to buy or sell
assets at a set price and date. Non-deliverable contracts are
settled in dollars.  Bonds, Swaps  Government bonds  were little changed. The yield on the 8.15
percent notes due June 2022 held at 7.76 percent in Mumbai,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It reached 7.72 percent
yesterday, the lowest level for a benchmark 10-year note since
July 2010. The rate declined 20 basis points this month as
official data on April 15 showed wholesale prices rose 5.96
percent in March, the least since November 2009.  The one-year interest-rate swap, a derivative contract used
to guard against fluctuations in funding costs, was unchanged
today at 7.215 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
