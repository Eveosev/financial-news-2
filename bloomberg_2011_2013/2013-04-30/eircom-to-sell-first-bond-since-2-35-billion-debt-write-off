Eircom Group plans to sell its
first bonds since 1.8 billion euros ($2.35 billion) of debt was
written off last year when senior lenders led by Blackstone
Group LP took over the Irish phone company.  It wants to raise 310 million euros of senior secured notes
due 2020, the Dublin-based company said in a statement today.
The proceeds will be used to repurchase existing senior
facilities, it said. Eircom’s entire 2.3 billion euros of debt,
consisting of a  term loan  from its lenders, falls due in 2017,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “The notes won’t be priced until after an investor
roadshow, which is expected to last a week, is complete,”
Eircom spokesman Paul Bradley said in an interview.  The bond sale comes after  Standard & Poor’s  cut its outlook
on Eircom this week to negative, saying it faces challenges
generating cash in the next two years as it invests in its
network. It affirmed its B rating on the former state-owned
telecommunications company, five levels below investment grade.  Eircom had racked up 4.1 billion euros of gross debt
through five ownership changes in 13 years before it filed the
country’s biggest creditor protection petition in March 2012.
Its most senior, or first-lien, lenders wrote off 15 percent of
their 2.4 billion-euro net loans and took control of the company
as more junior creditors lost almost all their investment.  The new notes are being sold by the company’s Eircom
Finance Ltd.  To contact the reporter on this story:
