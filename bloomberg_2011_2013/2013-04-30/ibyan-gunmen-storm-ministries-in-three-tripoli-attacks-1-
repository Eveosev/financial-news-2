Gunmen stormed three Libyan
ministries in two days, calling for senior Muammar Qaddafi-era
officials to be purged from office.  The Justice Ministry was besieged early today, with armed
men saying they wonâ€™t leave until the so-called Isolation law is
passed, according to the state-run LANA news agency. Guards at
the  Finance Ministry  were unhurt after being attacked by the
gunmen late yesterday, a spokesman said.  In the attack on the Foreign Ministry, men in trucks armed
with anti-aircraft guns encircled the building and blocked its
entrance, according to Abubaker Ali Said, an employee. The
French Embassy in Tripoli was bombed earlier April 23.  Militia violence has been a constant in  Libya  since the
capture and death of Qaddafi in 2011. It has intensified in
recent months with groups refusing to heed government calls to
disband, threatening local officials and storming buildings over
issues such as unpaid salaries.  The gunmen at the Justice Ministry said it will continue to
be a focus of ire, along with the Foreign Ministry, until
authorities get rid of all ambassadors who worked under the
previous government, LANA reported today.  Parliament was suspended amid the attacks. A vote on the
proposed purge law has been delayed several times. Lawmakers are
due to debate it May 5. As written, the law will remove any one
in a managerial position with ties to the former regime from
office.  To contact the reporter on this story:
