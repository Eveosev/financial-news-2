MGM Resorts International (MGM)  cleared a
hurdle in efforts to build an $800 million casino in
Springfield, Massachusetts, gaining the backing of the mayor
over a competing proposal by  Penn National Gaming Inc. (PENN)   Mayor Domenic Sarno announced his choice of MGM at a press
conference today. The Las Vegas-based casino company’s plan must
be approved by Springfield voters and a five-member
Massachusetts Gaming Commission, that’s weighing competing plans
for other cities.  The state legalized gambling in 2011, allowing one casino
in each of three geographic regions. Would-be operators must
negotiate an agreement with the municipality where their casino
would be based and win local voter approval.  MGM will have to compete with two other operators chasing
the western Massachusetts license: the Mohegan Tribal Gaming
Authority wants to open a casino in Palmer, and Hard Rock
International, owned by Florida’s Seminole Tribe, is seeking
approval in West Springfield, a separate city.  MGM, the largest owner of casinos on the  Las Vegas Strip ,
gained 1.6 percent to $13.96 at 12:01 p.m. in New York. The
stock had  advanced  18 percent this year before today.  Penn, based in Wyomissing, Pennsylvania, rose 0.1 percent
to $58.44 and had advanced 19 percent this year before today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
