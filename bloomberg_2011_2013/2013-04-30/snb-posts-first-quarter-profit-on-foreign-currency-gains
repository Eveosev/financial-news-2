The  Swiss National Bank  posted a
profit for the first three months of the year as the value of
foreign currency positions rose.  The Zurich-based central bank recorded a profit of 11.2
billion Swiss francs ($12 billion), compared with a consolidated
loss of 1.73 billion francs in the year earlier period,
according to a statement today.  Foreign currency positions contributed 11.2 billion francs,
due to exchange-rate gains of 5.2 billion francs and a valuation
gain on shares of 4.9 billion francs. That compares to a loss of
2.6 billion francs a year ago. Gold holdings lost 100 million
francs in the first quarter of 2013.  During the first three months of the year, the franc
depreciated 0.8 percent versus the euro and declined 3.6 percent
against the dollar. The price of gold slipped 1.4 percent in
Swiss franc terms. The SNB holds 1,040 tons of gold.  The SNB, which has accumulated reserves equal to nearly 75
percent of annual gross domestic product, has stressed that its
asset management is not conducted for generating profit and
instead should serve monetary-policy objectives.  The SNBâ€™s stabilization fund, created in 2008 to help bail
out  UBS AG (UBSN) , reported a quarterly profit of $582 million.  The central bank is structured as a joint-stock company, in
which public shareholders including cantons and regional banks
have a stake of about 55 percent. Private individuals hold the
remainder.  To contact the reporter on this story:
