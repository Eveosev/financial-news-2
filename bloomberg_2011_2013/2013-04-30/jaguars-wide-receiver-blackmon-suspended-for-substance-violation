Jacksonville Jaguars wide receiver
Justin Blackmon was suspended for the first four games of the
2013 season for violating the  National Football League ’s
substance-abuse policy.  Blackmon will be eligible to participate in all preseason
practices and games prior to the start of the season, the team
said yesterday in a release on its website without specifying
the nature of the 23-year-old’s violation.  Blackmon pleaded guilty to driving under the influence last
July in Oklahoma. He also was arrested on a DUI charge in Texas
in 2010.  “I’ve made mistakes and I have no excuse,” Blackmon said
in the release. “I am truly sorry and disappointed in myself
for putting the Jaguars in this situation, and I look forward to
putting this behind me and maturing and growing as a person.”  The No. 5 pick in the 2012 draft, Blackmon had 64
receptions last year for 865 yards and five touchdowns.  Blackmon is eligible to return to the team on Sept. 30, the
day after the Jaguars play the division-rival Indianapolis
Colts. He will also miss games against the  Kansas City Chiefs ,
 Oakland Raiders  and  Seattle Seahawks .  “It’s very disappointing,” Jaguars General Manager Dave
Caldwell said during a conference call with reporters. “We
understand this isn’t all going to be an upward trend and we’re
going to have setbacks. To be honest, things like this are
frustrating because it’s an avoidable situation.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
