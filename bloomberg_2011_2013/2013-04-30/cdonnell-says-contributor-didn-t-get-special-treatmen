Virginia Governor Robert McDonnell
said his administration didn’t give special treatment to  Star
Scientific Inc. (STSI) , a nutritional supplement company led by a
friend and campaign contributor.  Todd Schneider, McDonnell’s former executive mansion chef,
said in a court filing yesterday that he told the  Federal Bureau
of Investigation  about “wrongdoing” by the governor involving
gifts received by Star’s chief executive, Jonnie Williams.  “I don’t ever do anything, whether it’s with Mr. Williams
or his company -- or any other person or any other company -- to
give anybody any special treatment,” McDonnell said in an
interview today at Bloomberg’s Washington Summit.  The Washington Post reported that Williams paid the $15,000
catering bill for the 2011 wedding of McDonnell’s daughter.  Star is based in  Glen Allen , Virginia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
