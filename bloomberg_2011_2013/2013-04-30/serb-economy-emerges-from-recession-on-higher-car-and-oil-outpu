Serbia ’s economy expanded for the
first time in five quarters in the January-March period as
increased production of cars and fuel ended a recession.  Gross domestic product grew 1.9 percent from a year earlier
after contracting 2 percent in the last three months of 2012,
according to a flash estimate by the  Statistical Office  in the
capital Belgrade. The government forecast 2 percent growth this
year, which “seems pretty realistic” and would boost budget
revenue, Timothy Ash, chief emerging-markets economist with
Standard Bank Plc in  London , said by e-mail.  “Low base period effects were a key factor herein, but
this also shows the impact of the ramping up of production at
the Fiat car plant, which could boost car production from 30,000
units in 2012 to perhaps 160-180,000,” Ash said. He referred to
Fiat’s factory in central Serbia, a joint  venture  with the
government.  Restarting production at the country’s main refinery in
Pancevo, after upgrades also helped boost growth, Ash said. The
refinery is owned by  OAO Gazprom Neft (GAZP) ’s Naftna Industrija Srbije
AD.  The government seeks to cut the  budget deficit  to 3.6
percent of economic output this year from 6.7 percent in 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
