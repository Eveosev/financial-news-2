Copper dropped, poised for the
biggest monthly decline since May, as weakness in Japanese and
South Korean industrial output added to global demand concerns.  Copper for delivery in three months on the London Metal
Exchange fell as much as 0.7 percent to $7,104 a metric ton and
was at $7,128 at 10:26 a.m. in  Tokyo . The metal has retreated
5.5 percent this month. Futures for delivery in July on the
Comex were little changed at $3.2265 per pound. Markets in  China 
are closed through May 1 for public holidays.  Japan’s production gained 0.2 percent from the previous
month, less than the median 0.4 percent forecast in a Bloomberg
News survey of 27 economists. South Korea’s output fell 2.6
percent. Today’s data add to signs of a cooling global economy
after U.S. gross domestic product rose less than forecast and
China reported an unexpected slowdown in the first quarter.  “Data from Japan and South Korea damped metals sentiment
amid an absence of Chinese buyers,” said Hwang Il Doo, a senior
trader at Korea Exchange Bank Futures Co. in Seoul. Investors
are watching the  Federal Reserve  and the  European Central Bank 
this week, he said.  The Federal Reserve will consider renewing its commitment
to bond-buying at a two-day meeting that starts today, while
most economists in a Bloomberg survey predict the European
Central Bank will cut  interest rates  this week.  On the LME, nickel also retreated.  To contact the reporter on this story:
