Umicore SA (UMI) , the world’s largest
precious-metals recycler, fell the most in 11 weeks in Brussels
after forecasting a steeper profit drop than most analysts
projected because of lower metal prices and persistent weak
demand for catalysts and building products in  Europe .  Umicore dropped as much as 5 percent on Euronext Brussels,
the biggest intraday drop since Feb. 7, and traded 1.32 euros
lower at 33.38 euros by 9:04 a.m. local time. The shares have
lost  19 percent  in the past 12 months.  Earnings before interest, tax and special items will drop
to about 315 million euros ($413 million), plus or minus 15
million euros, from 372.1 million euros last year, the Brussels-
based company said today in a statement. That fell short of the
351.5 million-euro average of 15 analyst  estimates  compiled by
Bloomberg.  “Consensus estimates should be revised down about 7.5
percent to the top end of the guidance,” Filip De Pauw, an
analyst at ING Groep NV in Brussels, wrote in an investor note.
“The latter comes on top of the downside risk on recycling
profitability due to lower metal prices.”  European car sales are heading for a 20-year low after
contracting 9.7 percent in the first quarter and Umicore said
consumers are trading down to smaller vehicles with fewer  diesel
engines , the most profitable segment in the automotive catalyst
industry. Lower prices for specialty metals such as tellurium
and rhodium, which can’t be hedged, curbed recycling profit,
while Umicore locked in some precious-metal prices before they
dropped.  Precious metal prices fell 1.4 percent on average so far
this year from the same period a year earlier, based on the
Bloomberg precious metals spot price index that tracks prices of
platinum, gold, palladium and silver. The  gauge  closed at 387.12
yesterday, 6.2 percent lower than 12 months ago.  Umicore also said  net debt  fell to “well below” 200
million euros at the end of March from 222.5 million euros at
the end of last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
