Justin Wolfers, University of 
Michigan professor of economics and public policy and Bloomberg 
View columnist, discusses his op-ed "Refereeing the 
Reinhart-Rogoff Debt Debate" which looks at the "academic 
firestorm" sparked by the discovery of an error in a research 
paper by Harvard University economists Carmen Reinhart and Ken 
Rogoff.  Wolfers speaks with Bloomberg's Kathleen Hays and 
Vonnie Quinn on Bloomberg Radio's "The Hays Advantage."  (Source: Bloomberg)  Running time 07:20
