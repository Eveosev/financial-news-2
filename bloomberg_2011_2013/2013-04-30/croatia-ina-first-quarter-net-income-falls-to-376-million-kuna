INA Industrija Nafte d.d. , the
Croatian refiner controlled by Hungary’s Mol Nyrt., said first-
quarter net income fell 9 percent from a year earlier as the
country struggled through a recession.  Net income dropped to 376 million kuna ($65 million), while
earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, or
Ebitda, fell to 1 billion kuna from 1.29 billion kuna in the
same period a year earlier, the Zagreb-based company said in a
statement today. Revenue was flat at 7 billion kuna.  “The environment in the first quarter remained challenging
and negative movements from 2012 continued into 2013 but the
company achieved stable positive results,” Zoltan Aldott, head
of the management board, said in the statement.  The refiner’s 2012 profit slumped 62 percent as it halted
profitable gas and oil business in  Syria  to comply with European
Union policy on the Middle Eastern country, engulfed in a civil
war.  Croatia  hopes to join the EU in July.  Mol owns 49.1 percent of INA, while Croatia holds a 44.84
percent stake. In the last two years the government has
attempted to increase its influence in INA after Mol won
controlling rights to Croatia’s largest refiner in 2009.  INA, Croatia’s fourth-biggest employer and one of the
country’s biggest investors, spent about 17 billion kuna in the
last decade to expand its operations. The company returned to
profit in 2010 following two years of losses as oil and gas
output in the northern Adriatic and Syria pushed revenue higher.  To contact the reporter on this story:
