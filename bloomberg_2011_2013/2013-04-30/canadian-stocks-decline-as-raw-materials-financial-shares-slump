Canadian  stocks  rose, erasing a
loss for the year, as energy and technology shares gained after
data showed the economy is on track for its fastest quarterly
growth since 2011.  Suncor Energy Inc. (SU) , the nation’s largest energy producer,
climbed 6 percent after raising its dividend and announcing a
share buyback program. BlackBerry jumped 4.6 percent after its
chief executive officer said he sees sales of its new Q10 device
to be in the “tens of millions.”  CGI Group Inc. (GIB/A)  surged to a
13-year high after reporting earnings ahead of estimates.  The  Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index (SPTSX)  rose 143.83
points, or 1.2 percent, to 12,456.50 at 4 p.m. in Toronto after
declining as much as 0.6 percent earlier. The benchmark gauge
has advanced 0.2 percent this year, erasing a previous loss.
Trading volume was 17 percent higher than the 30-day average.  “The oils are doing well today,” said  David Cockfield ,
fund manager with Northland Wealth Management in Toronto. He
helps manage C$225 million ($223 million). “Suncor helped. The
fact they’re willing to raise their dividend, it’s a show of
confidence: ’Hey, we can pay dividends and we’re not worried
about future earnings.’ The environment is so negative any
bright moment is appreciated.”  Canada’s  gross domestic product  grew for a second month in
February, led by gains at potash miners and factories. Output
rose 0.3 percent, matching the revised January gain, to an
annualized C$1.57 trillion, Statistics Canada said today in
Ottawa. The median forecast in a Bloomberg survey of 23
economists was for a 0.2 percent expansion.  Suncor Dividend  Energy, financial and raw-material stocks  contributed  most
to gains, as all 10 industries rose.  Suncor climbed 6 percent to C$31.41 for its biggest advance
since October 2011. The Calgary-based oil producer boosted its
quarterly  dividend  54 percent to 20 cents a share and said it
will buy back as much as C$2 billion of stock after scrapping
plans for the Voyageur oil-sands project.  Suncor also  reported  adjusted first-quarter earnings that
surpassed analysts’ estimates.  The S&P/TSX Information Technology Index surged 7.7
percent, the most since December 2009.  CGI Group  CGI Group, the Montreal-based technology services provider,
surged 18 percent to C$31.90, the highest level since January
2000. CGI reported adjusted second-quarter earnings of 56
Canadian cents a share, ahead of the average estimate of 49
cents according to a Bloomberg survey of 15 analysts.  Kris Thompson, analyst with National Bank Financial, raised
his price target for CGI to C$40 from C$30 in a report to
clients after the earnings release.  BlackBerry, formerly Research In Motion Ltd., added 4.6
percent to C$16.45, the highest level in more than a month. The
stock has increased 40 percent this year on optimism that the
new BlackBerry 10 lineup can help fuel a comeback.  The company expects to sell several tens of millions of the
company’s Q10 smartphone that features a keyboard, CEO Thorsten Heins said in an interview with Bloomberg Television yesterday
at the Milken Institute conference in Los Angeles.  Nevsun Resources Ltd. fell 1.6 percent to C$3.77 and Semafo
Inc. declined 2.1 percent to C$1.91. The price of gold fell 7.7
percent in April for its biggest monthly drop since December
2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
