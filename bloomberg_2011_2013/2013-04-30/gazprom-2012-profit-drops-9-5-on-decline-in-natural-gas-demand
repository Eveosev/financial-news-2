OAO Gazprom, the world’s biggest
natural gas producer, said profit slumped 9.5 percent last year,
the first decline in more than a decade, as European demand fell
and operating expenses jumped.  Net income fell to 1.18 trillion rubles ($38 billion) from
1.3 trillion a year earlier, the Moscow-based company said in a
 statement  today. Revenue rose 2.7 percent to 4.76 trillion
rubles, as higher  gas prices  compensated for declining exports.  Gazprom, which supplies a quarter of  Europe ’s demand,
reduced shipments to its traditionally most profitable market by
3.6 percent, while sales volumes also fell at home and in the
former Soviet republics, according to the report. The last time
Gazprom posted a drop in full-year net income was 2001.  Operating expenses surged 18 percent to 3.48 trillion
rubles because of a jump in oil and gas purchases, the mineral
extraction tax, and staff costs.  Gazprom recognized 102.7 billion rubles in retroactive
payments to European customers last year. The company had booked
133.2 billion rubles of discounts in the first half, and said in
its nine-month report that it expected a profit tax rebate of
30.4 billion rubles.  Shares traded little changed at 122.35 rubles by 11:11
a.m., erasing gains of as much 0.6 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
