Alaska plans to spend as much as
$800,000 to evaluate exporting gas from its North Slope,
including financial incentives for participating companies.  The state is seeking bids from contractors to help its
 Department of Natural Resources  develop fiscal policies
affecting leaseholders in the north Alaskan gas fields,
according to a  request for proposals  distributed April 26.  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) ,  BP Plc (BP/) ,  ConocoPhillips (COP)  and  TransCanada
Corp. (TRP)  are considering a  gas pipeline  from Alaska’s North Slope
to a terminal further south, where fuel would be liquefied for
export. The companies  reported  to Alaska Governor Sean Parnell
in February that they had completed the “concept development”
for their proposed liquefied natural gas project.  “The project definition, commercial structure, equity
participation, the state’s fiscal terms and ownership rights,
and risk allocation are just now starting to take shape and are
far from being fully defined,” Alaska’s natural resources
department said in the request for proposals. “The state needs
to be prepared to offer additional inducements.”  Alaska plans to issue a contract by June 12 for the study
to be completed by Oct. 15, according to the request.  To contact the reporter on this story:
