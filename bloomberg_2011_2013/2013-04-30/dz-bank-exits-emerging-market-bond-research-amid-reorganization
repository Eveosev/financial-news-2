DZ Bank  AG, the largest issuer of
structured notes in 2012, discontinued its research on emerging-

on emerging-market currencies and provide analysis on developing
countries, according to a statement.  DZ Bank provides structured products directly to more than
900 local lenders.  To contact the reporter on this story:
