Ultra-low-sulfur diesel fell and
crack spreads narrowed after a refinery in  Venezuela  resumed
full rates and as gasoil sank in  Europe  after German
unemployment rose in April, signaling weaker demand for exports.  ULSD slipped as much as 1.1 percent. The number of Germans
out of work climbed to 2.94 million, the Nuremberg-based Federal
Labor Agency said.  Petroleos de Venezuela SA ’s Amuay refinery
began production at a distillation unit, completing the plant’s
restart after an explosion last year, said an official. May
gasoil slipped 0.9 percent on ICE Futures Europe.  “To me, it’s all about Europe,” said Carl Larry,
president of Oil Outlooks & Opinions LLC in Houston. “Weak
unemployment numbers there mean that all of our hopes and dreams
about sending exports are starting to fade.”  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel for May delivery dropped 2.94
cents, or 1 percent, to $2.8713 a gallon at 10:12 a.m. on the
 New York  Mercantile Exchange. Trading volume was 10 percent
below the 100-day average.  The more actively traded June contract fell 2.97 cents to
$2.8371 a gallon. May ULSD and gasoline contracts will expire at
the 2:30 p.m. close of floor trading today. The fuel’s  crack
spread  versus June West Texas Intermediate crude shrank 39 cents
to $25.52 a barrel. The  spread  versus Brent decreased 23 cents
to $16.37.  Gasoline for May delivery fell 2.91 cents, or 1 percent, to
$2.7984 a gallon on volume that was 26 percent below the 100-day
average. The June contract slipped 2.97 cents to $2.7923.  The fuel’s  premium  over June West Texas Intermediate
declined 39 cents to $23.63 a barrel. The  spread  to Brent
narrowed 17 cents to $14.54.  Gasoline at the  pump , averaged nationwide, rose 0.8 cent to
$3.508 a gallon, AAA said on its website today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
