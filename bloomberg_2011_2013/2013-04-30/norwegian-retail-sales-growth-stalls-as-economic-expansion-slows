Norwegian  retail sales  stalled in
March as a rally in the krone and a recession in  Europe  weighed
on the labor market.  Retail  sales,  excluding motor vehicles and petrol stations,
were unchanged in the month, after rising 0.5 percent in
February, the Oslo-based statistics office said today. They fell
an annual 4.2 percent. Sales were estimated to be unchanged in
the month, according to a Bloomberg survey of seven economists.  Europe’s second-richest nation per capita is starting to
feel the effect of Europe’s debt crisis and weaker growth
prospects have been feeding through to the labor market. Still,
a report today showed that the  unemployment rate  eased to 3.5
percent in February from 3.6 percent at the start of the year,
which was the highest in more than two years.  The krone weakened 0.04 percent against the euro to 7.6176
by 10:06 a.m. in Oslo.  Policy makers held  their benchmark deposit rate  unchanged
at 1.5 percent last month and signaled a possible rate cut as
early as next month to limit krone gains and boost growth.  Output growth in the mainland economy, which excludes oil,
gas and shipping, is estimated to slow to 2.75 percent in 2013
from 3.5 percent last year, according to central bank forecasts.  Norges Bank will publish its next rate decision on May 8.  To contact the reporter on this story:
