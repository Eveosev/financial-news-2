Japan ’s  Topix Index (TPX)  rose, capping
its best month in 14 years, as brokerages led the advance after
 Nomura Holdings Inc. (8604) ’s quarterly profit more-than-tripled to the
highest in seven years.  Nomura, the nation’s largest brokerage, climbed 4.1 percent
as brokerage commissions and investment banking fees jumped.
 Mitsui O.S.K. Lines Ltd. (9104) , Japan’s second biggest shipping line
by revenue, gained 3.9 percent after saying it will return to
profit this fiscal year. Robot maker Fanuc Corp. plunged 5.6
percent after saying operating profit fell, contributing the
most to the decline in the Nikkei 225 Stock Average.  The Topix gained 0.3 percent to close at 1,165.13 in Tokyo,
with about five stocks rising for every three that fell. It
gained 13 percent this month, the best monthly rally since March
1999. The Nikkei 225 fell 0.2 percent to 13,860.86.  “We can expect some profit growth in domestic shares tied
to government stimulus measures, if not as much as in
exporters,” said  Masaru Hamasaki , a senior strategist at Tokyo-
based Sumitomo Mitsui Asset Management Co., which manages about
10.2 trillion yen ($104 billion) in assets. “We may see a
correction in Japanese stocks any time, and I don’t think the
stocks are cheap in terms of valuation.”  Japanese markets were closed yesterday for a public
holiday. The Topix advanced 61 percent from mid-November as
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and central bank Governor Haruhiko
Kuroda pledged to defeat 15 years of deflation.  The gauge traded at 17.4 times estimated earnings, compared
with 14.4 for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and 12.9 for the
Stoxx Europe 600 Index, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Of the 251 companies on the 1,711-member Topix that have
reported  annual earnings  since April 1, and for which Bloomberg
has estimates, 146 have beat projections.  Nomura Earnings  Nomura advanced 4.1 percent to 793 yen, leading gains among
brokerages. Net income rose to 82.4 billion yen ($840 million)
for the three months ended March 31, from 22.1 billion yen a
year earlier, Nomura said on April 26. The result exceeded the
56 billion yen average estimate of nine analysts.  SBI Holdings Inc., the best performing stock on the MSCI
Asia Pacific Index this year, surged 16 percent to 1,886 yen,
rising the most on the Topix Securities Index.  Daiwa Securities
Group Inc. (8601) ,the second largest brokerage, rose 5 percent to 863
yen.  Mitsui O.S.K. added 3.9 percent to 405 yen after
forecasting a net profit of 50 billion yen this fiscal year as a
weaker yen boosts earnings from dollar-based contracts. The
Japanese currency has plunged 19 percent over the past six
months, the worst performance among the 10 developed-market
currencies tracked by the Bloomberg Correlation Weighted
Indexes.  Fanuc Plunges  Fanuc plunged 5.6 percent to 14,700 yen, the biggest
retreat since Jan. 28, after reporting a 17 percent drop in
operating profit in the year ended March and forecasting
declines in first-half sales and profits.  Fanuc is the second heaviest weighted stock in the  Nikkei
225. (NKY)  The benchmark gauge is being influenced more than at any
time in the last 12 years by the movements of a single company,
clothier Fast Retailing, which makes up about 10 percent of the
gauge.  Honda Motor Co. (7267) , Japan’s second largest carmaker by market
value, fell 3.4 percent to 3,875 yen. Net income will probably
rise 58 percent to 580 billion yen in the 12 months ending March
2014, Honda said April 26. Though the profit forecast missed the
average analyst estimate compiled by Bloomberg, Honda’s revenue
projection exceeded estimates.  Ricoh, a maker of office automation equipment, slumped 8.4
percent to 1,086 yen after posting net income of 32.5 billion
yen for the year ended March below its own estimate. The stock
fell the most since March 2011.  The Nikkei Stock Average Volatility Index slid 1.3 percent
to 25.25, indicating traders expect a swing of about 7.2 percent
on the benchmark gauge over the next 30 days. Trading volume on
the Nikkei was about 9 percent below the 30-day average.  To contact the reporter on this story:
