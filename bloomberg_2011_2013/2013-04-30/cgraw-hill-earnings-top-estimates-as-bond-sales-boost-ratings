McGraw-Hill Cos. (MHP) , owner of the
world’s largest credit rater, reported first-quarter sales that
beat analysts’ estimates on higher ratings revenue.  Adjusted net income increased to $228 million, up from $176
million, the New York-based company said today in a statement
distributed by PR Newswire. Net income fell 3.2 percent to $153
million from $158 million a year earlier. Earnings excluding
certain items were 80 cents a share, topping the average
 estimate  of 73 cents in a Bloomberg survey of seven analysts.  McGraw-Hill is transforming itself into a financial
products and data provider after the 125-year-old company
completed the sale of its education unit last month for $2.4
billion in cash to  Apollo Global Management LLC (APO)  The remaining
firm, to be renamed McGraw Hill Financial Inc. pending
shareholder approval, has at its center Standard & Poor’s
Ratings Services, which was sued Feb. 4 by the U.S. Justice
Department for fraud.  Revenue at S&P climbed 20.4 percent to $561 million on
higher transaction sales, up from $466 million a year earlier.
The U.S. is seeking as much as $5 billion from McGraw-Hill,
alleging the company deliberately understated the risk of bonds
backed by loans made to the riskiest borrowers to win business
from Wall Street banks. The lawsuit sent shares down the most in
25 years.  McGraw-Hill has since  rebounded  25.3 percent, gaining 2.8
percent yesterday to close at $53.45, after the company settled
lawsuits over the ratings of structured investment vehicles.
McGraw-Hill paid about $77 million to settle the two claims,
according to the earnings release.  S&P made up 45 percent of the company’s revenue last year.
Corporate bond issuance worldwide fell 7.5 percent to $1.1
trillion in the first three months of the year from $1.2
trillion in the same period of 2012, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  The company’s biggest competitor, Moody’s Corp., reports
first quarter earnings  May 3. (MCO)   (McGraw-Hill will hold a conference call for analysts and
