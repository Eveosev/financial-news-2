U.S. natural gas production in the
lower 48 states rose in February by the most in 16 months as new
wells came online from shale deposits in the Northeast and North
Dakota, a government report today showed.  Production in the  lower 48 states  rose 1.3 percent to 73.22
billion cubic feet a day from a revised 72.3 billion in January,
the biggest month-over-month percentage gain since October 2011,
the Energy Information Administration’s monthly  EIA-914 report 
showed. Output, which increased for the first time in three
months, was up 1.8 percent from a year earlier.  Total  U.S. output , including  Alaska , rose 0.8 percent to
82.88 billion cubic feet a day in February from a revised 82.2
billion the previous month, the most since November, according
to the report from the Energy Department’s statistical arm.
Production was up 1.1 percent from February 2012.  “New wells were brought online in the Marcellus and Bakken
Shales,” which drove the biggest volume gains, the EIA said in
the report. Output in  Texas , the top producing state, gained
with new Eagle Ford shale wells while New Mexico production
increased with warmer weather, the government said.  Gas production in the contiguous states declined in January
as frigid weather froze wells, the EIA said last month.  Surprising Report  The report of a gain in February output was a bit of a
surprise as the industry “probably faced the most significant
well freeze-offs since the winter of 2007,” said Teri Viswanath, director of commodities strategy at BNP Paribas SA in
New York. “Given persistent cold weather, I had anticipated
sequential declines through March.”  Supplies from the “other states” category, which includes
the Marcellus shale deposit in the Northeast, jumped 2.1 percent
to 24.87 billion cubic feet a day from a revised 24.35 billion
in January. Production in February was a record in government
data going back to 2005.  Texas output gained 1.4 percent to 22.12 billion cubic feet
a day, the biggest monthly percentage increase since April 2012.  Oklahoma output rose 0.2 percent to 5.69 billion cubic feet
a day while production in  Wyoming  increased 0.3 percent to 5.79
billion. It was the first gain for both states in three months.  Production in  Louisiana  slid 1 percent to 7.29 billion
cubic feet a day in February, the lowest output since January
2011 following eight straight monthly declines. Daily output in
the Gulf of Mexico fell 2 percent to 4 billion cubic feet a day,
a five-month low.  Natural gas futures for June delivery fell 4.4 cents, or 1
percent, to $4.348 per million British thermal units at 1:58
p.m. on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Gas has climbed 30
percent this year.  The EIA-914 report covers gross withdrawals, which include
gas used for repressuring, quantities vented and flared, and
non-hydrocarbon gas removed in treating or processing
operations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
