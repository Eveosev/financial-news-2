Global production of oilseeds this
season may be larger than forecast a month ago because of
bigger-than-expected supplies of soybeans and rapeseed, Oil
World said.  Output of seven major oilseeds in the 2012-13 season may be
456.1 million metric tons, 1.3 million tons more than forecast a
month ago and 5.8 percent larger than last season, the Hamburg-
based researcher said today. Global production of soybeans in
the 2012-13 marketing year, which began Sept. 1 in the U.S., may
be 266 million tons, while world rapeseed output will climb to
62.5 million tons.  Soybean production in five major South American countries
may be 143.6 million tons, unchanged from a forecast two weeks
ago, including 81.3 million tons from  Brazil  and 48.5 million
tons from Argentina, Oil World said. Soybean exports from  South
America  in April were the highest ever for the month at 9.3
million tons, and shipments may reach another record in May of
at least 10 million tons.  “South American soybean exports are now accelerating”
after logistical backlogs and harvest delays postponed shipments
from  Brazil  in the first quarter, Oil World said. “This will
finally result in the much desired improvement of soybean
arrivals in the importing countries, although the shipping
period of three-to-four weeks to several Asian and European
destinations needs to be considered.”  Harvest Accelerates  Dry weather has allowed the harvest to accelerate in
Brazil, with 78 percent of crops collected in  Rio Grande  do Sul
state, near the normal pace, Oil World said.  Argentina ’s harvest
was 18 percent complete as of April 25. About 430,000 hectares
(1.1 million acres) may be abandoned. Farmers in Argentina
probably have sold about a third of their soybeans, less than
last year and the average rate, as producers are holding crops
as a hedge against rising inflation, according to the report.  The U.S. soybean crop in the 2012-13 season may be 82.4
million tons (3.027 billion bushels), up 350,000 tons from the
previous forecast and larger than the U.S. Department of
Agriculture’s estimate at 82.06 million tons, Oil World said.
The researcher pegs U.S. ending stocks at 2.72 million tons,
below the USDA’s forecast at 3.39 million tons, because of
higher exports.  China ’s soybean  imports  may not increase in 2012-13,
snapping a nine-year streak of rising purchases, Oil World said.
The country’s soybean stockpiles in early May will be less than
five weeks of consumption and 6 million tons smaller than a year
earlier. Imports in April were about 3.6 million tons, down from
4.9 million tons last year, Oil World said.  Palm Oil  Global exports of eight major vegetable oils in the first
half of the 2012-13 marketing year rose to 35.1 million tons, up
1.8 million tons from a year earlier, led by an increase in palm
oil shipments. World palm oil consumption was a record 27.4
million tons from October through March, 300,000 tons more than
estimated a month ago, Oil World said. Global imports of  palm
oil  in the first quarter climbed 12 percent from a year earlier
to 10.9 million tons.  “Large supplies of palm oil by-and-large offset the feared
repercussions of year-on-year reductions mainly in world output
of soya oil, sunflower oil and groundnut oil so far this
season,” Oil World said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
