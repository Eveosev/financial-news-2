Mexico ’s peso-denominated bonds
dropped, pushing yields to a two-week high, after policy makers
signaled last week that they will halt cuts in borrowing costs.  Yields on the securities maturing in December 2024 rose
eight basis points, or 0.08 percentage point, to 5.92 percent,
the highest level on a closing basis since Oct. 15, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. They yields dropped to a three-month
low of 5.69 percent on Oct. 23. The peso slipped less than 0.1
percent to 12.8806 per U.S. dollar today.  Policy makers said in a statement Oct. 25 that more
reductions in the target lending rate weren’t advisable as they
lowered the target lending rate by 0.25 percentage point to a
record low 3.50 percent.  “Some positions that may have been getting ahead of it are
surely adjusting,”  Rafael Camarena , an economist at Grupo
Financiero Santander Mexico SAB in Mexico City, said in a
telephone interview. “These positions may have been expecting
that in the statement they’d leave the door open for another cut
and that wasn’t the case.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
