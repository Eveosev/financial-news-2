Chevron Corp. (CVX) ’s  El Segundo complex ,
the largest single refinery on the U.S. West Coast, delayed
maintenance on crude and coker units to late April, a person
familiar with the schedule said.  Work on the coker originally set for January will begin in
the last week of April and is expected to last about two months,
said the person, who asked not to be identified because the
information isn’t public. Repairs on the No. 4 crude unit will
start at the same time and take about three weeks, according to
the person.  Rod Spackman, a spokesman for Chevron in El Segundo, didn’t
immediately respond to e-mailed and phoned requests for comment.  The El Segundo refinery can process 279,000 barrels of
crude a day, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The plant supplies
40 percent of the jet fuel to the Los Angeles International
Airport and has a 20 percent share of the Southern  California 
gasoline market, the company’s  website  said.  Other equipment including a naphtha hydrotreater and a
sulfur recovery unit are also scheduled to shut for repairs
during the turnaround, according to the person.  Chevron is planning to replace six coke drums at the El
Segundo refinery that arrived from  Spain  in late January, the
company’s website said.  The plant receives about 50,000 barrels a day of its oil by
pipeline from fields in California and 225,000 barrels a day by
tanker, the company’s website shows.  To contact the reporter on this story:
