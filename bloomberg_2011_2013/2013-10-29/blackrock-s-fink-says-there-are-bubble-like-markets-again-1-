BlackRock Inc. (BLK)  Chief Executive
Officer Laurence D. Fink, whose company is the world’s largest
money manager with $4.1 trillion in assets, said Federal Reserve
policy is contributing to “bubble-like markets.”  “It’s imperative that the Fed begins to taper,” Fink said
today at a panel discussion in  Chicago , referring to the central
bank’s $85 billion in monthly bond purchases. “We’ve seen real
 bubble-like  markets again. We’ve had a huge increase in the
equity market. We’ve seen corporate-debt spreads narrow
dramatically.”  The Fed in September decided against reducing the bond
purchases as economic growth remained muted. Following a partial
U.S. government shutdown this month, policy makers will probably
delay slowing the stimulus until March, according to a Bloomberg
survey of economists conducted Oct. 17-18.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index has gained 24 percent this
year, after advancing 13 percent in 2012. The extra yield
investors demand to hold high-risk, high-yield bonds has dropped
to 444 basis points from this year’s high of 534 in June,
according to the Bank of America Merrill Lynch U.S. High Yield
Index. That spread reached 440 basis points on Oct. 24, the
narrowest since May 28.  “We have issues of an overzealous market again,” Fink
said at the event, which was sponsored by the Paulson Institute
and the University of Chicago Institute of Politics.  To contact the reporter on this story:
