The market for initial public
offerings is “alive and well” and it’s a great time for
companies to raise financing, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Chief
Executive Officer  Lloyd Blankfein  told CNBC today.  “The IPO market is alive and well,” Blankfein, 59, said
in the interview. “We have  high equity prices , we have an
economy that’s growing -- people would like it to be growing at
a faster rate, but there’s no doubt it’s growing.”  Blankfein declined to comment on the planned IPO for
 Twitter Inc. (TWTR) , which Goldman Sachs is managing. Goldman Sachs
ranks first among managers of global equity offerings so far
this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
