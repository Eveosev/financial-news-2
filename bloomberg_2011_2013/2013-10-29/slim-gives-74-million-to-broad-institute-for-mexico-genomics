Carlos Slim , the world’s second-richest person, has given $74 million to a program at the
Harvard University-affiliated  Broad Institute  to advance genomic
science in  Mexico  and across Latin America.  The gift to the Slim Initiative for Genomic Medicine in the
Americas, or SIGMA, will train scientists in the study of human
genomes, the full DNA code, and promote access to treatment
based on the science, the Cambridge, Massachusetts-based Broad
Institute and  Carlos Slim Health Institute  said today in a
statement.  Hospitals and laboratories around the world are using human
genomes to increase understanding of conditions such as cancer
and rare childhood disorders. Slim’s gift today follows an
earlier donation of $65 million to the SIGMA project, which will
promote understanding of the genomes in diverse populations,
according to the statement.  “There are many discoveries that can only be made by
studying non-European populations,” Eric Lander, president and
founder of the Broad Institute, which is also associated with
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said in the
statement. “It is essential that the benefits of the genomic
revolution be accessible to people throughout the Americas and
the world.”  Slim is the chairman emeritus of America Movil SAB de CV,
the largest mobile phone operator in the Americas.  To contact the reporter on this story:
