South Africa  chose 17 preferred bids
for almost 1,500 megawatts of green energy projects and is still
studying candidates under  a program  to cut its reliance on coal.  “A large number of very competitive bid responses were
submitted” for onshore wind and photovoltaic sites in a third
round of the program, the Energy Department said on its website.  The government picked seven bidders for 787 megawatts of
onshore wind farms, six for 450 megawatts of photovoltaic parks,
one for 16.5 megawatts of biomass, one for 18 megawatts of
landfill gas and two for 200 megawatts of concentrated solar. It
will decide on further bidders by Nov. 20, the department said.  South  Africa , seeking to cut dependence on coal for power,
plans to add 3,725 megawatts of renewable-energy capacity by the
end of 2016 with five tenders. That may help state utility Eskom
Holdings SOC Ltd. to meet demand as it struggles to pay for
maintenance and expansion in the continent’s biggest economy.  A group led by Mainstream Renewable Power, based in Dublin,
Ireland, was made a preferred bidder for three wind farms worth
9 billion rand ($912 million) and with a total capacity of 360
megawatts in the Northern Cape, the company said in a statement.
It was awarded 238 megawatts of wind and solar projects in the
first round of the program in 2011 and the three projects are on
schedule to be fully operational in mid-2014, Mainstream said.  Power rates would be competitive due to caps of 1.40 rand a
kilowatt hour for solar and 1 rand for wind,  Kensani Eaglestone
Capital Advisory (Pty) Ltd . Deputy Managing Director Nuno Gil
said July 19. That follows a drop of as much as 40 percent in
average bidding prices from the first to second rounds.  Twenty-year power-purchase agreements with state utility
Eskom helped drive $5.7 billion of clean-energy investments to
the country last year, or about a quarter of the total invested
in sub-Saharan Africa, Bloomberg New Energy Finance data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
