Spain ’s National Court received
papers requesting the extradition of former  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) 
trader Javier Martin-Artajo on charges he helped hide trading
losses that eventually surpassed $6.2 billion.  Judge Santiago Pedraz will call Martin-Artajo to court in
coming days to ask whether he agrees to be extradited to the
U.S., a spokesman for the court, who asked not to be identified
by name in line with policy, said in a phone interview today.  Martin-Artajo turned himself into police in August after
being contacted by investigators and was released after telling
a Madrid court that he opposed extradition. The Spanish citizen,
who oversaw synthetic credit trading at JPMorgan’s chief
investment office in London, last month was indicted in the U.S.
for engaging in a  securities fraud  to hide losses stemming from
trades by Bruno Iksil, the Frenchman at the center of the case
who became known as the London Whale.  No one was immediately available to comment at Cortes
Abogados, a Madrid-based  law firm  that Expansion newspaper
reported was hired by Martin-Artajo to represent him in Spain.  Martin-Artajo’s attorney at Norton Rose Fulbright in London
didn’t immediately return a request for comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
