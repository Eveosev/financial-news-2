Chinese stocks  slumped, dragging the
benchmark gauge to the lowest level in seven weeks, as small
companies dropped and the central bank’s first cash injection in
two weeks failed to reduce money-market rates.  Tsinghua Tongfang Co., a maker of personal computers,
tumbled 4 percent to lead losses among technology companies.
 Zhejiang Beingmate Technology Industry & Trade Co. (002570)  fell 7
percent after net income plunged. The  ChiNext index  of small
companies slid 1.4 percent, paring a loss of as much as 5.8
percent, as price swings approached last week’s record high. The
 fixing  on the seven-day money-market rate rose seven basis
points to 5 percent. Ping An Bank Co. rallied 7.5 percent,
pacing gains for financial companies.  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  fell 0.2 percent to 2,128.86
at the close, after sliding as much as 1.9 percent. The measure
gained as much as 1.4 percent in the morning. The People’s Bank
of  China  added 13 billion yuan ($2.1 billion) using seven-day
reverse-repurchase agreements today, according to a trader at a
primary dealer required to bid at the auctions.  “We were rising in the morning because of the reverse
repo, but after pricing that in, we have to note the market is
still in a weak mode,” said Zhang Haidong, analyst at Tebon
Securities Co. in  Shanghai . “Liquidity is still tight.”  The Shanghai measure has lost 2.1 percent this month,
poised for the first decline since June, and trades at 8.4 times
projected profits for the next 12 months. That’s lower than the
seven-year average of 15.4.  The CSI 300 Index advanced 0.3 percent to 2,372.05. The
 Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  of mainland companies traded
in  Hong Kong  climbed 1.2 percent, led by banks and Anhui Conch
Cement Co. The Bloomberg China-US Equity Index fell 1.2 percent
in  New York  yesterday.  Company Earnings  Trading volumes in the Shanghai index were 3.5 percent
below the 30-day average for this time of day, after falling to
the lowest level in two months yesterday, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Earnings at the 146 companies in the
Shanghai gauge tracked by Bloomberg that reported results so far
this quarter have trailed analyst estimates by 5.7 percent.  Tsinghua Tongfang dropped to 8.38 yuan. A gauge of
technology companies fell 2 percent on the CSI 300, the most
among 10 industry groups. Zhejiang Beingmate slumped 7 percent
to 33.75  yuan  after third-quarter net income plunged 59 percent
from a year ago. The ChiNext’s 100-day volatility was at 34.66
today, near the record high of 34.99 set last week. The
Shenzhen-listed index pared this year’s gains to 77 percent.  “Small-cap companies had risen a lot previously and
earnings so far aren’t good, so it’s damping  market sentiment ,”
says Wei Wei, an analyst at West China Securities. “There’s
still concern about the economy. The only thing supporting the
market today is banking stocks.”  Lenders Gain  Ping An Bank climbed 7.5 percent to 14.12 yuan. Industrial
Bank Co. advanced 4.8 percent to 12.09 yuan.  China may start a trial of preferred share offerings in
industries including banking and electricity generation, the
China Securities Journal reported, citing unidentified
investment bankers. Preferred shares would allow lenders to
replenish their balance sheets, David Poh, the regional head of
portfolio-management solutions at  Societe Generale ’s private
bank, said last month.  “This could alleviate some of the funding pressure faced
by medium-size banks,"said Gerry Alfonso, a trader at Shenyin &
Wanguo in an e-mail.  Hong Kong  Industrial & Commercial Bank of China Ltd. (601398)  led a rally for
Chinese banks trading in Hong Kong, rallying 2.7 percent to
HK$5.34.  China Construction Bank Corp. (939) , the biggest lender in
the nation after ICBC, climbed 2.3 percent to HK$5.90. Anhui
Conch Cement jumped 4.1 percent to HK$26.55 after the company
reported third-quarter profit jumped to 2.32 billion yuan from 1
billion yuan in the same period last year.  The Shanghai index has slumped 6.2 percent this year on
concerns a slowing economy will hurt profit growth and the
government will introduce measures to curb property-price gains.  The iShares China Large-Cap ETF, the largest Chinese
exchange-traded fund in the U.S., climbed 0.3 percent to $36.55
in New York. NQ Mobile Inc. extended its three-day plunge to 62
percent after Muddy Waters LLC accused it of fabricating
revenue, while Sohu.com Inc. tumbled on plans to boost marketing
expenses.                       To contact the reporter on this story:
