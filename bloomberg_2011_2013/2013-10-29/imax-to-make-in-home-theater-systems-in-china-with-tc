Imax Corp. (IMX)  plans to develop and
produce in-home theater systems in partnership with  TCL
Multimedia Technology Holdings Ltd. (1070) , catering to a growing
market of wealthy Chinese customers seeking to equip their homes
with cinema-style systems.  The first products will be introduced in China and other
unspecified global markets in 2015, according to a statement
today. The new system will allow customers to access current
releases that have been digitally remastered into the Imax
format. The joint venture will operate in  Hong Kong  and China
and include research and development, sales, marketing and
manufacturing.  Imax, based in Mississauga, Ontario, has been expanding
beyond its big-screen roots with a recent introduction of its
Imax Private Theatre offering. Now itâ€™s partnering with a Hong
Kong-based consumer electronics group that sells home
electronics and telecommunications devices.  To contact the reporter on this story:
