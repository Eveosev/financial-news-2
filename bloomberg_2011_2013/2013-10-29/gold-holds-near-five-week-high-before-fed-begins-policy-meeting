Gold futures declined from a five-week high as the dollar’s rally curbed demand for the metal as
an alternative investment before Federal Reserve policy makers
meet on U.S. monetary policy.  The greenback rose to a one-week high against a basket of
10 currencies as the Fed begins a two-day policy meeting.
Wholesale prices unexpectedly dropped in September, curbing the
appeal of gold as a hedge against inflation. Energy futures also
fell today.  “A lack of fresh, bullish fundamental news is keeping
buyers scarce,” Jim Wyckoff, a senior analyst at Kitco Inc., a
research company in  Montreal , said in a report. “The key
‘outside markets’ are also in a bearish daily posture for the
precious metals -- a firmer U.S. Dollar Index and weaker crude-oil prices.”  Gold futures for December delivery fell 0.5 percent to
settle at $1,345.50 an ounce at 1:36 p.m. on the Comex in  New
York . Yesterday, the price reached $1,361.80, the highest for a
most-active contract since Sept. 20.  The Fed’s Open Market Committee meets today and tomorrow to
consider whether to start trimming $85 billion a month in bond
purchases. Policy makers will delay scaling back stimulus until
March, according to economists surveyed last week by Bloomberg.  This year, gold has slumped 20 percent, heading for the
first annual drop since 2000. Some investors lost faith in the
metal as a store a value amid a U.S.  equity  rally to a record
and tame inflation.  Holdings in the SPDR Gold Trust, the biggest exchange-traded  fund  backed by the metal, have tumbled 35 percent this
year. Last week, they dropped to the lowest since February 2009.  Silver futures for December delivery declined 0.2 percent
to $22.492 an ounce on the Comex. On the  New York Mercantile
Exchange , platinum futures for January delivery fell 0.7 percent
to $1,461.90 an ounce. Palladium futures for December delivery
dropped 0.5 percent to $747.05 an ounce.  To contact the reporters on this story:
