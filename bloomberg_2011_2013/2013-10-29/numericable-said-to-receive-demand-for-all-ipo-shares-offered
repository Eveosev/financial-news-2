 Numericable SAS, the cable provider
attempting the biggest initial public offering in  France  in four
years, received sufficient demand to cover all the available
shares in the 652.5 million euro ($900 million) sale, said two
people with knowledge of the matter.  There is also demand to cover a so-called overallotment
option, the people said, asking not to be identified while the
sale process is on. The IPO opened for subscriptions yesterday,
with shares being offered at 20.30 euros to 24.80 euros apiece.  Numericable’s sale is the latest indication of demand for
 Europe ’s cable assets and as investors return to the region’s
markets because of an economic recovery and an easing euro debt
crisis. The last listing of similar size in Paris was in
December 2009, when automotive distributor  CFAO SA (CFAO)  raised more
than 800 million euros. Carlyle Group LP and Cinven Group Ltd.
are selling Numericable stock valued at about 402.2 million
euros, accounting for the majority of the shares offered.  French floormaker Tarkett SA is also seeking a listing in
Paris this quarter. The volume of IPOs on European exchanges
this year has nearly doubled to about $19 billion, over the same
period in 2012, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  and Deutsche Bank AG are managing
Numericable’s IPO.  To contact the reporter on this story:
