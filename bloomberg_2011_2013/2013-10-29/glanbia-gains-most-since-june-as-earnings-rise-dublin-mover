Glanbia Plc (GLB) , the Irish dairy and
nutritionals producer, gained the most in four months after the
firm said that earnings-per-share growth this year is on track
to reach the upper range of the guidance it set out as recently
as August.  Shares gained as much as 5.5 percent to 10.13 euros, the
biggest gain on an intraday basis since June 25, and traded at
10.10 euros as of 10:03 a.m. The Kilkenny, Ireland-based company
said it expects 2013 adjusted earnings-per-share to increase 10
percent from last year, on a constant currency basis.  Glanbia, run by Chief Executive Officer John Moloney,
previously expected adjusted earnings-per-share to increase by
between 8 percent and 10 percent. Total sales for the nine
months to Oct. 5 jumped 14 percent from the year-earlier period,
the company said.  “The higher end guidance this morning is reassuring
especially given the difficulties faced by Glanbia in its Irish
business,” said Liam Igoe, an analyst at  Goodbody Stockbrokers 
in Dublin, who has a hold rating on the stock. “The higher
constant currency guidance reflects the acceleration of growth
in Performance Nutrition.”  About 126,000 shares traded in Dublin, the equivalent of 38
percent of average daily volume for the stock during the
past three months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
