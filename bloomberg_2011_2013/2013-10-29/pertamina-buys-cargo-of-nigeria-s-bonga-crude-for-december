PT Pertamina,  Indonesia ’s state-owned oil company, bought 950,000 barrels of Nigerian Bonga
crude for December delivery to its Balikpapan refinery, said an
official who asked not to be identified because the information
is confidential.  The Jakarta-based company earlier this month bought 600,000
barrels of Brunei’s Seria Light and 750,000 barrels of Libyan El
Sharara for Balikpapan, as well as 600,000 barrels of  Russia ’s
ESPO and two 950,000 barrel shipments of Qua Iboe for its
Cilacap facility. All the cargoes are for December delivery.  To contact the reporter on this story:
