A California bond underwriter
charged with plying school officials in  San Diego  County with
meals and sports tickets worth thousands of dollars to steer
business to his employers pleaded guilty to conspiracy.  Gary Allen Cabello, 55, entered guilty pleas to two counts
of conspiracy to bribe officials at an Oct. 25 court hearing,
Tanya Sierra, a spokeswoman for San Diego County District
Attorney Bonnie Dumanis, said by phone yesterday.  Cabello faces a maximum of 44 months in prison, with a
sentencing hearing scheduled for April 17, Sierra said. Cabello
wooed elected board members and superintendents of the
Sweetwater Union High School District and Southwestern Community
College District with campaign contributions in addition to the
meals and tickets, according to a January indictment by a grand
jury in state court.  San Diego County prosecutors charged 14 other people, most
of them school officials, in what they described as a “widening
public corruption case” involving three school districts and a
community college district.  Cabello worked for two firms during the period outlined in
the indictment, now-defunct Alta Vista Financial Inc. and
Cabrera Capital Markets LLC, based in  Chicago .  The case is People v. Cabello, SCD235445, California
Superior Court, San Diego County (San Diego).  To contact the reporters on this story:
