A chance to see the  Boston Red Sox 
win a  World Series  title at Fenway Park for the first time in 95
years has ticket prices averaging $2,056, comparable to the
 Super Bowl  in February.  The Red Sox hold a three-games-to-two advantage in their
best-of-seven series against the  St. Louis  Cardinals, with Game
6 set for tonight at their 37,493-capacity ballpark in Boston.
The secondary market ticket aggregator TiqIQ says it is the most
expensive baseball game in the company’s four-year history.  The last time the Red Sox wrapped up a World Series
championship at Fenway was 1918, when they beat the Chicago Cubs
in six games. The attendance was 15,238, according to the  box
score .  The average price for a resale ticket to Game 6 this year
has risen 11 percent since yesterday. It rose 13 percent in the
day after  Jon Lester  pitched the Red Sox to a 3-1 win in Game 5
two days ago, according to TiqIQ. The cheapest tickets to the
game are $1,047, a 77 percent increase since Game 5 in St.
Louis.  Tickets to last season’s National Football League
championship between the Baltimore Ravens and San Francisco
49ers in New Orleans averaged $2,199, with the cheapest resale
tickets going for $1,062, according to TiqIQ.  The previous record price for baseball tickets tracked by
TiqIQ was Game 2 of the 2010 World Series. Prices averaged
$1,787 for that game as the San Francisco Giants hosted the
 Texas Rangers .  The 2010 matchup averaged $1,318 per seat on the secondary
market. In each of the past two years, when the Cardinals played
Texas in 2011 and the Giants faced the Detroit Tigers in 2012,
ticket prices averaged less than $1,000.  Road Clinchers  Boston has won the World Series twice in the last decade,
sweeping its 2004 series against the Cardinals and the 2007
matchup against the Colorado Rockies with clinching victories on
the road.  The last time the  Red Sox  had a chance to win the World
Series at Fenway Park was in 1975, when Boston’s Carlton Fisk
hit a 12th-inning shot down the left-field line that struck the
foul pole for a game-winning home run, forcing a decisive
seventh game with the Cincinnati Reds.  While the highlight of Fisk trying to will the ball fair
became one of  Major League Baseball ’s most iconic postseason
moments, the Red Sox lost 4-3 the following day.  Boston also lost in Game 7 of the 1967 World Series at
Fenway Park, falling 7-2 to the Cardinals.  To contact the reporter on this story:
