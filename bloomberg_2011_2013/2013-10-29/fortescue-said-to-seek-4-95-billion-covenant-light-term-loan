Fortescue Metals Group Ltd (FMG) ,
 Australia â€™s third-biggest iron ore exporter, is seeking a $4.95
billion  term loan  to refinance debt, according to a person with
knowledge of the transaction.  Credit Suisse Group AG, the bank arranging the covenant-light financing, meaning it will not contain  maintenance
requirements, said the person, who asked not to be identified
because the deal is private. The bank will hold a lender call
tomorrow at 10 a.m. in New York to discuss the terms.  Proceeds of the debt will refinance borrowings outstanding
under a $5 billion credit the company obtained last year. The
debt was quoted at 100.69 cents on the dollar today, according
to prices compiled by Bloomberg.  Fortescue is proposing to pay interest at 3.75 percentage
points more than the London interbank offered rate, down from
4.25 percentage points more than the lending benchmark paid on
the existing loan, the person said. Libor will have a 1 percent
minimum.  The five-year debt will be offered to lenders at 99.75
cents on the dollar, the person said. Investors have until Nov.
