Highland Capital Management LP’s
legal feud with former executive Patrick Daugherty must go to
trial, a  Dallas  judge ruled.  State court Judge  Martin Hoffman  at a hearing today denied
requests by both sides for rulings in their favor in a case that
started in April 2012 when the investment firm and Chief
Executive Officer James Dondero sued Daugherty over claims he
breached his contract when he left the firm in 2011 and made
derogatory comments to investors.  Daugherty, who led the Dallas-based firm’s distressed
situations and private equity investments unit, claimed in a
countersuit that the firm owes him money and that Dondero
defamed him.  “I’m denying summary judgment in total,” Hoffman said
today.  The trial is scheduled for Jan. 14. Highland is seeking
damages and wants Daugherty to return  trade secrets  to the
company and be restrained from using that information, Marc
Katz, a lawyer for the firm, told the judge. Daugherty is
seeking $160 million in damages, said one of his lawyers, Ruth
Ann Daniels.  While Hoffman pared several claims from Daugherty’s
countersuit, he let stand Daugherty’s claims for breach of
fiduciary duty, defamation and exemplary damages.  The case is Highland Capital Management LP v. Daugherty,
12-04005, District Court of Dallas County,  Texas , 68th Judicial
District (Dallas).  To contact the reporters on this story:
