Rubber increased amid optimism that
improvement in the Chinese economy may boost demand from the
world’s largest consumer.  The contract for delivery in April, which began trading
yesterday on the  Tokyo  Commodity Exchange, gained as much as 0.9
percent to 262.3 yen a kilogram ($2,687 a metric ton) and was at
261.6 yen at 11:02 a.m.  Speculation grew that  China  may take additional steps to
sustain growth in the world’s second-biggest economy as the
Communist Party will hold a summit meeting in November, said
 Kazuhiko Saito , an analyst at broker Fujitomi Co. in Tokyo.
China’s manufacturing strengthened more than forecast this month,
data from HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics showed Oct. 24.  “Futures were supported by optimism about Chinese
demand,” he said by phone today.  China’s rubber industry urged the National Development and
Reform Commission to scrap a 20 percent tax on natural rubber
imports, the National Business Daily reported yesterday, citing
unidentified people from tire companies as saying.  Crude rubber stockpiles held at Japanese warehouses fell
2.7 percent to 4,386 tons on Oct. 10, according to data today
from the Rubber Trade Association of Japan.  Rubber for January delivery on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange rose 0.2 percent to 19,405  yuan  ($3,189) a ton. Thai
rubber free-on-board declined 1.3 percent to 78.15 baht ($2.51)
a kilogram yesterday, according to the Rubber Research Institute
of Thailand.  To contact the reporter on this story:
