Washington Redskins owner Daniel Snyder told National Football League Commissioner Roger Goodell
that he has no plan to change the team name even amid
opposition from American Indians and politicians, the Washington
Post said.  The two men met today in New York to discuss the nickname,
the newspaper reported, citing two unidentified people familiar
with the meeting. The session came one day before NFL officials
are set to meet with leaders from the Oneida Indian Nation, who
have called the nickname a racial epithet and requested it be
changed.  NFL spokesman Greg Aiello declined in an e-mail to comment
on the report, saying that Goodell speaks with NFL owners
“almost every day.”  Snyder said this month in a letter to Redskins season
ticket-holders that the nickname, which the team has used since
1933, honors American Indians. He repeated similar sentiments to
Goodell today, according to the Post.  Redskins spokesman Tony Wyllie didn’t immediately respond
to an e-mail seeking comment on the report and tomorrow’s
meeting with the Oneida delegation.  Barack Obama , the first black U.S. president, and House of
Representatives Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi are among others
who have said the Redskins should consider changing the name.  To contact the reporters on this story:
