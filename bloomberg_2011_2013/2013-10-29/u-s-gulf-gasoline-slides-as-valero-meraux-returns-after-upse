U.S. Gulf Coast gasoline slipped for
a third consecutive day as  Valero Energy Corp. (VLO)  planned to return
a Louisiana refinery to full rates.  Conventional, 85-octane gasoline , or CBOB, on the Gulf
weakened 0.75 cent to 21 cents a gallon below futures on the  New
York Mercantile Exchange  at 3:58 p.m., the lowest in almost a
week, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Conventional, 87-octane gasoline  also slipped 0.75 cent to a discount of 20.75
cents a gallon to futures.  Valero said it expects its  Meraux, Louisiana, refinery  to
return to planned rates within the next two days. It’s currently
putting crude oil into a unit that had a release during
maintenance, according to the company. Meraux, which produces
mostly gasoline and distillate fuel, has a capacity of about
135,000 barrels a day.  The company also reported the startup of a heavy oil
cracker power recovery unit at its  Corpus Christi West refinery 
in  Texas . Phillips 66’s Borger, Texas, site and Exxon Mobil
Corp.’s Baton Rouge plant are expected to complete maintenance
and boost output this month.  The  3-2-1 crack spread  in the area, a measure of refining
margins for gasoline and diesel based on West Texas Intermediate
oil in Cushing,  Oklahoma , slipped 31 cents to $9.70 a barrel.
The  same spread based  on Light Louisiana Sweet oil, the Gulf
Coast benchmark, dropped 36 cents to $7.55 a barrel, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
