Canadian crude strengthened relative
to West Texas Intermediate after  BP Plc (BP/)  announced it would start
a coker at its Whiting, Indiana, refinery in November and begin
running more heavy oil there.  Western Canadian Select crude in  Alberta  strengthened by $1
to a $34-a-barrel discount to WTI at 2:40 p.m., according to Net
Energy Inc., a Calgary-based energy broker. WCS is a blend of
heavy, high-sulfur crudes from west  Canada .  BP Chief Executive Officer Bob Dudley said the refinery
near  Chicago  will start a new 100,000-barrel-a-day coker in
November and ramp up rates into 2014. The plant’s total capacity
is 420,000 barrels a day.  “Once the coker is online, we expect the refinery to begin
a three-month progressive transition to heavy feedstock,
reaching full run rate capacity during the first quarter of next
year,” Dudley said during a conference call.  BP upgraded the largest crude unit at the Whiting refinery
to be able to process heavy crude earlier this year. In addition
to the coker, it’s also building new hydrotreaters to be able to
handle the higher sulfur levels in the Canadian crude.  “BP Whiting is going to really suck the last of the heavy
barrels out of the system,” said Carl Larry, president of Oil
Outlooks & Opinions LLC in Houston.  Syncrude, a light, sweet, synthetic crude oil, remained
unchanged at an $11.50 discount to WTI, according to Net Energy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
