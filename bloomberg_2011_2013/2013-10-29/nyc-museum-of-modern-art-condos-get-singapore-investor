Pontiac Land Group , owner of the Singapore Ritz-Carlton, is helping revive plans for a 72-story residential tower adjacent to the  Museum of Modern Art  in midtown Manhattan.  The Singapore-based company, controlled by the billionaire Kwee family, plans to invest $200 million in the project at 53 W. 53rd St., Michael Su, chief executive officer at Pontiac, said in an e-mail response to  Bloomberg News  queries. Pontiac will team up with Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Hines, existing partners for the development.  Singapore developers are expanding overseas as the government measures to curb record residential prices slow demand at home. OUE Ltd., based in the island-state, agreed to buy U.S. Bank Tower in Los Angeles, California’s tallest building, for $367.5 million in March.  “The motivation for Asian buyers to seek investments in the U.S. and western  Europe  is to diversify risk from their domestic markets,” said Priyaranjan Kumar, the Singapore-based regional director of  capital markets  at Cushman & Wakefield Inc. Cushman estimates over $50 billion of equity from  Asia  will be invested in Europe and  North America  by 2020, he said.  The tower in Manhattan has been planned since as early as 2007, when Hines, the Houston-based property company, selected Paris-based architect  Jean Nouvel  to design it, according to the developer’s  website . Hines and Goldman Sachs Real Estate Principal Investment Area acquired the site for $125 million from the museum that same year, according to a statement from Pontiac Land today.  Tower’s Revival  The building would reach 1,050 feet (320 meters), about the height of the  Chrysler Building , on a 17,000-square-foot (1,580-square-meter) lot on 53rd Street near Sixth Avenue, according to Hines. It would include 145 luxury condominiums, and 60,000 square feet on the second through fifth floors for the museum to expand its galleries.  The Wall Street Journal earlier reported Pontiac Land’s investment in the project.  The tower’s revival comes amid a high-rise construction boom in Midtown as developers seek to take advantage of soaring luxury-condo demand. It’s about four blocks from Extell Development Co.’s One57 and  Harry Macklowe  and CIM Group’s 432 Park Ave., which are under construction and have set price records with pending purchases of more than $90 million each.  Privately-held Pontiac Land has built hotels including the Ritz-Carlton Millenia and the Conrad Centennial in Singapore and luxury residential condominiums in the island state’s prime areas, according to its website.  “We are Singapore centric and our New York City investment is a significant step outside our comfort zone,” Su said. “The U.S. is a big market and we would like to stay. If opportunities present themselves in  China  and Europe, we will not rule out these markets.”  To contact the reporters on this story: Oshrat Carmiel in  New York  at  ocarmiel1@bloomberg.net ; Pooja Thakur in Singapore at  pthakur@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story: Kara Wetzel at  kwetzel@bloomberg.net
