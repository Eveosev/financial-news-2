OAO Rosneft,  Russia ’s largest oil
producer, said third-quarter profit rose eightfold from the
previous three-month period after it recorded a 167 billion-ruble ($5.2 billion) gain on the value of TNK-BP.  Net income rose to 280 billion rubles from 35 billion
rubles in the second quarter, the Moscow-based company said in a
statement on its website. Earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization rose 41 percent to 303 billion
rubles, beating the average estimate of 272 billion rubles from
13 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  State-run Rosneft became the world’s largest traded oil
producer by volume after it completed the $55 billion purchase
of TNK-BP, Russia’s third-largest producer, in March. Rosneft is
also boosting its natural gas business by acquiring a stake in
the SeverEnergia venture, assets from OAO Alrosa and Itera.  “We made significant progress in delivering our strategic
goals,” Chief Executive Officer  Igor Sechin  said in the
statement, noting improvements in the industry’s tax regime.  Rosneft shares jumped as much as 1.5 percent and traded up
1 percent at 256.24 rubles by 2:03 p.m. in Moscow.  Dividends, paid out at 25 percent of net income, will be
supported by the accounting gain after Rosneft’s auditor,
Deloitte, estimated the fair value for TNK-BP at 167 billion
rubles higher than the acquisition price, Sechin said on Sept.
27 in Sochi, Russia.  Revenue increased 15 percent to 1.36 trillion rubles from
the previous quarter, according to the statement.  To contact the reporters on this story:
