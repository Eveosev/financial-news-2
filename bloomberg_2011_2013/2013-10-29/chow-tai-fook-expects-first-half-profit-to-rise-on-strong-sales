Chow Tai Fook Jewellery Group Ltd. (1929) ,
the world’s largest listed jewelry chain, said first-half profit
probably gained on strong sales of gold products and reduced
hedging loss from gold loans.  The company is preparing interim earnings for the six month
through September, so the positive profit alert is based on a
preliminary review of management accounts, the Hong Kong-based
company said in a filing to the city’s stock exchange yesterday.  Retail sales of gold in  China  surged in April as global
bullion prices plunged, aiding jewelers across the country. Chow
Tai Fook reported a  profit  of HK$1.82 billion ($235 million) in
the six months ended Sept. 30 last year, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  The stock rose as much as 2.9 percent to HK$12.6 before
trading at HK$12.46 at 11:03 a.m. in Hong Kong trading. The
benchmark Hang Seng Index gained O.7 percent.  Chow Tai Fook said on Oct. 17 that same-store sales rose 18
percent in the second quarter and margins widened. The company
will release first-half earnings at the end of November.  Bullion for immediate delivery traded at $1,343.58 an ounce
at 8:58 a.m. in  Singapore  from $1,345.05 yesterday. Gold
rebounded this month on speculation the U.S. Federal Reserve
won’t slow asset purchases until next year after a government
shutdown hurt the economy.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
