European Aeronautic, Defence &
Space Co., parent of planemaker Airbus SAS, had its long-term
 credit rating  upgraded one notch at  Fitch Ratings , which said
the business has improved its financial performance and stands
to benefit from progress on the new A350 wide-body model.  Fitch elevated Toulouse, France-based EADS to an A- rating
with a stable outlook, versus BBB+ previously, it said today in
a statement.  “The upgrade reflects Fitch’s view that the recovery and
improvement in EADS’s financial performance in 2012 and 2013 is
sustainable and has brought the group’s overall credit profile
to a level commensurate with the ‘A’ category,” the agency
said. Airbus boosted earnings before interest and tax to 5.8
percent of sales in the first half of 2013 from 3.2 percent a
year earlier, and other units have stable margins, Fitch said.  EADS is likely to improve its funds for operations cover --
a measure of operating performance -- to 9 percent this year
from 7 percent in 2011, aided by enhanced program execution on
the A350 plane following the first flight in June, together with
better cost discipline and rising profitability on the A380
superjumbo, the ratings company said.  EADS is due to report third-quarter results on Nov. 14. The
company’s large currency hedging portfolio, required because
planes are paid for in dollars, continues to contribute to
earnings volatility and is a drag on its rating, Fitch said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
