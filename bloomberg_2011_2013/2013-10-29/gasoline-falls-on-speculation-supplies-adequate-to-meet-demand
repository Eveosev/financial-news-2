Gasoline fell on speculation that
supplies are adequate to meet demand even as unplanned shutdowns
reduce production.  Futures declined as much as 1.4 percent after jumping 1.7
percent yesterday after a spate of refinery outages. U.S.
gasoline production in the week ended Oct. 18 was the highest
season since at least 1982, according to Energy Information
Administration data.  “The market today is putting into perspective the refining
issues we have,” said  Phil Flynn , senior market analyst at
Price Futures Group in  Chicago .  Gasoline for November delivery fell 2.4 cents, or 0.9
percent, to $2.6069 a gallon at 9:52 a.m. on the  New York 
Mercantile Exchange. Trading volume was 3.2 percent above the
100-day average.  Citgo Petroleum Corp. said yesterday that its Lemont,
Illinois, refinery plans to restart the atmospheric section of
its crude unit next week at reduced rates. The company said an
Oct. 23 fire was limited to the vacuum distillation section of
the unit.  “If other refiners can make up for the difference in
output at Lemont, we might be OK on supply,” Flynn said.  The motor fuel’s  crack spread  versus WTI narrowed 53 cents
to $10.42 a barrel. The fuel traded at a 20-cent discount to
Brent, from a 2-cent premium yesterday.  U.S. retail  pump prices , averaged nationwide, fell 0.7 cent
to $3.278 a gallon, Heathrow, Florida-based AAA said today on
its website. Prices are 26.5 cents below a year ago.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel for November delivery slipped 0.64
cent to $2.958 a gallon on trading volume that was 10 percent
below the 100-day average.  ULSD’s  premium  over WTI gained 4 cents to $25.86 a barrel.
The  spread  versus Brent rose 41 cents to $15.30.  To contact the reporter on this story:
