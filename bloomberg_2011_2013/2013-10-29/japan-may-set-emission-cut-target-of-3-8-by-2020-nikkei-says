Japan  may set a new greenhouse gas
emissions target of a 3.8 percent cut by fiscal 2020 from fiscal
2005 levels, the Nikkei newspaper reported today.  Minister of the Environment Nobuteru Ishihara will announce
a new goal at United Nations climate talks in Poland which will
begin Nov. 11, the paper reported, without saying where it got
the information.  The target would represent a 3 percent increase in the
discharge of  greenhouse gases  from fiscal 1990 levels, the paper
said. Japan’s fiscal year starts in April.  Japan will set a new target by November after reviewing the
previous government’s goal of a 25 percent reduction by 2020
from 1990 levels, Ishihara said in January.  To contact the reporter on this story:
