Soybean futures rose on speculation
that processors will snap up U.S. supplies after prices touched
a two-week low. Corn rebounded from a three-year low, and wheat
also gained.  Exporters shipped 83.6 million bushels of  soybeans  overseas
in the week ended Oct. 24, up 31 percent from a year earlier and
the second-most ever, the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  said
yesterday. Sales of soy-based  animal feed  rose to 850,141 metric
tons in the week ended Oct. 3, the most since before 1990, USDA
data show. Soybean prices fell 9.8 percent this year as world
 output  rose 12 percent to a record.  “There continues to be very strong demand for U.S.
soybeans and soy meal, and that is giving the market some
traction,” Brian Grete, the senior market analyst for
Professional Farmers of America newsletter in  Cedar Falls , Iowa,
said in a telephone interview. “Demand will continue to surface
on price breaks.”  Soybeans for delivery in January gained 0.2 percent to
close at $12.7075 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the  Chicago  Board of
Trade, after touching $12.645, the lowest since Oct. 15. The
U.S. soybean  harvest  is 77 percent complete, matching the
average pace of the previous five years, the USDA said.  Soybean-oil  futures in Chicago rose for the first time in
seven sessions after  palm oil  advanced to an eight-month high,
as rains disrupt harvesting in Malaysia, Grete said. Soybean oil
competes with palm oil in importing nations including China.
Soybean oil’s  premium  to palm oil yesterday fell to the smallest
since May 2012, exchange data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Corn futures for delivery in December rose 0.3 percent to
$4.32 a bushel, the first gain in four sessions. Prices earlier
touched $4.2825, the lowest for a most-active contract since
August 2010, and are down 38 percent this year as USDA forecasts
production to jump to a record.  Wheat futures for delivery in December advanced less than
0.1 percent to $6.8125 a bushel, halting a three-session slide.  To contact the reporter on this story:
