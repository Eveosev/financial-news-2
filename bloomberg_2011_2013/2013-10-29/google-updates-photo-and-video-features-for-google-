Google Inc. (GOOG)  is making it easier to edit and enhance photos and videos on its Google+ social service, stepping up efforts against rival  Facebook Inc. (FB)   The 18 new features, unveiled at a press event in San Francisco today, include a new tool that automatically makes a movie from a collection of clips. Another feature enables users to erase unwanted parts of a photo.  “We are looking at doing nothing less than revolutionizing the feel of photography,”  Vic Gundotra , senior vice president at Google, said at the event.  Google, owner of the world’s largest Internet search engine, is building out Google+ to attract users and advertising dollars from Facebook, the largest social network.  The  Mountain View , California-based company said about 300 million consumers visit the Google+ stream of content from friends, while the total users logged in to the service who undertake a social action monthly -- including surfers who watch a video on YouTube recommended by a friend or endorse a search result -- is 540 million. In contrast, Facebook has more than 1 billion users.  In a  blog post , Google said more than 1.5 billion photos are uploaded to the social service every week.  The updates “aim to take a lot of the work out of messaging, video calling and photo editing,” the company said in the post.
