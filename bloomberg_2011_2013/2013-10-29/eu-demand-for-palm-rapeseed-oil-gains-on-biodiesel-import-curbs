European Union demand for biofuel
ingredients including palm oil and rapeseed oil is increasing as
the bloc boosts domestic production and cuts imports of finished
biodiesel, Oil World said.  Biodiesel production is climbing within the EU as the bloc
implements duties on imports from  Argentina  and  Indonesia , the
Hamburg-based researcher said. The EU imported 494,000 metric
tons of biodiesel from Argentina this year, down from 1.273
million tons in the first 10 months of 2012, Oil World said.
Anti-dumping duties may go into effect at the end of November,
ranging from 217 to 246 euros ($299 to $339) a ton on Argentine
biodiesel and 122 to 179 euros a ton on supplies from Indonesia,
it said. Provisional tariffs have been in place since May.  “The steep decline in arrivals of biodiesel has triggered
a recovery in EU biodiesel production, thus raising feedstock
requirements, primarily of palm oil and rapeseed oil,” Oil
World said. “Permanent hurdles for biodiesel imports from the
two key countries will lift the dependence on rapeseed oil as a
feedstock for the European biodiesel market.”  EU imports of  palm oil  for technical use, including for
making biodiesel and for heat generation, were 2.45 million tons
this year through July, 63 percent more than in the same period
in 2012, Oil World said. Supplies classified for technical use
can be imported duty-free.  In  Spain , historically the EU’s third-biggest biodiesel
 producer , palm oil imports were a record 650,000 tons from
January through August, Oil World said.  Rising EU demand for rapeseed helped  Ukraine ’s exports
during September climb to 472,000 tons, near a record 497,000
tons achieved in September 2008, Oil World said. Shipments of
rapeseed oil climbed to a monthly record of 21,000 tons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
