UBS AG (UBSN) ,  Switzerland ’s biggest bank,
said it has taken and will take personnel measures as it
conducts an internal review of its foreign exchange business,
which is being examined by regulators.  The bank started an internal review of its business
immediately after a June media report about “widespread
irregularities in foreign exchange markets,” UBS said in its
third-quarter report today. Since then, the Zurich-based bank
has been among financial institutions to receive requests for
information from authorities investigating the matter, it said.  Bloomberg News reported in June that traders at some banks
said they shared information about their positions through
instant messages, executed their own trades before client orders
and sought to manipulate the benchmark WM/Reuters rates. In
August,  Bloomberg News  reported that recurring spikes in trading
around the periods in which the rates are calculated suggested
that dealers may have been trying to influence the benchmarks.  UBS said its internal review of the foreign exchange
business is continuing and the company is cooperating with the
authorities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
