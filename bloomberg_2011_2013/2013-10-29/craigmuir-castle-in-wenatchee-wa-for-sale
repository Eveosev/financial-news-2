22 N Garfield Ave, Wenatchee WA  For sale: $2,980,000 With a population of j ust over 32,000 in 2012 , Wenatchee, located in Central Washington along the Columbia River, is not considered a huge city by any means. Therefore, any unusual homes — especially ones that look like a castle — are well-known. “This home gets a lot of attention,” said listing agen t Jeff Hallman of Laura Mounter Real Estate and Company . “People take wedding photos in front of it.” It makes sense that the home, named “Craigmuir,” would be an apt place for a wedding photo-op. The 10,000-square-foot mansion is built from granite collected from Mount Index in the nearby Cascade Mountain area and was shaped and chiseled piece-by-piece on site. The timber frame construction of the roof was built without a single nail using a method of precision cutting and wooden dowels to hold it together. According to records, the entire construction — inside and out — took seven years to build. A registered historical landmark in the city, Craigmuir was built by Wentachee businessman Charles Muirhead. Muirhead was born in Scotland and when he moved to Washington state, he drew inspiration from his home country for his new residence. Today the home is well-maintained by its current owners, who did substantial updates on the kitchen and bathrooms — updating existing plumbing and expanding the kitchen with more cabinet space and top-of-the-line appliances. Other additions to the home include a walk-in closet in the master suite, a media room and workout room. Despite the modern updates, the home still retains its character, says Hallman. The 5-bed, 3-bath home sits on almost a full acre in central Wenatchee. The grounds include manicured lawns, a rose garden and outdoor pool with spa. Based on a 30-year-fixed mortgage with 20 percent down, a monthly payment on the home would be $11,460,  calculated with the Zillow mortgage calculator.   Currently  305 homes are for sale  in Wenatchee.
