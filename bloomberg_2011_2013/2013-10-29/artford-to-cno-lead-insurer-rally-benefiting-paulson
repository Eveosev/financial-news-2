Hartford Financial Services Group
Inc. (HIG)  and  CNO Financial Group Inc. (CNO)  led a rally of U.S. insurers
after posting profit that beat analysts’ estimates, benefiting
investors including  John Paulson  who has stakes in both.  CNO jumped 3.5 percent to $15.30 at 10:08 a.m. in  New York .
Hartford climbed 2.6 percent to $34.77.  Paulson, who made $15 billion betting against subprime
loans, helped recapitalize CNO in 2009 and pushed Hartford Chief
Executive Officer  Liam McGee  last year to focus on property-casualty coverage. Hartford, based in the Connecticut city of
the same name, said late yesterday that third-quarter net income
surged to $293 million from $13 million a year earlier, after
McGee retreated from  life insurance .  Hartford’s results were “aided by improving margins from
continued rate increases in property and casualty, and faster
than expected runoff of the Talcott block,” which includes
annuities issued in prior years, Gloria Vogel, an analyst at
Drexel Hamilton LLC, said in a note today. She raised her price
target to $40 from $34.  Hartford’s operating profit of $1.03 a share beat by 20
cents the estimate in a Bloomberg survey. Carmel, Indiana-based
CNO yesterday posted  operating profit  of 33 cents a share,
compared with the average estimate of 28 cents.  Paulson, 57, controlled more than 13 million CNO shares as
of June 30 through his New York-based hedge fund, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. His Hartford stake was about 6
million shares.  CNO shares closed at $4.99 on Oct. 13, 2009, the date his
investment was announced. Paulson started buying Hartford stock
in 2009 and the shares had to reach about $24.71 for him to
break even, based on filings through February of last year.  Paulson has also invested in mortgage insurers, including
 MGIC Investment Corp. (MTG)  and Radian Group Inc., in a bet on the
housing recovery. Radian advanced 1.2 percent and Milwaukee-based MGIC climbed 0.2. Both have more than doubled this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
