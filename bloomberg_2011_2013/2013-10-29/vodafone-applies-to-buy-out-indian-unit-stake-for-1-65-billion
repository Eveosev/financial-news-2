Vodafone Group Plc (VOD)  asked the Indian
government for permission to raise the stake in its local unit
to 100 percent and said it would pay about 101.4 billion rupees
($1.65 billion) for the holding.  Vodafone made the request to the  Foreign Investment
Promotion Board , it said yesterday. The price for the additional
15.5 percent stake in Vodafone’s largest business by subscribers
implies a 654.2 billion-rupee value for the entire division. The
mobile-phone operator already owns 64.4 percent directly and
20.1 percent through subsidiaries.  Once Vodafone gets full control, it will consider investing
additional cash through share subscriptions, the Newbury,
England-based company said. The Indian unit accounts for 9.8
percent of Vodafone’s annual revenue.  India  removed a cap on
foreign stakes in the industry in July to attract capital amid a
growing current account deficit and tumbling rupee.  “We have always said we would like to increase our holding
in the business and this further investment demonstrates
Vodafone’s long-term commitment to India,” the company said.
“Looking ahead, Vodafone will continue to invest in India.”  Vodafone sold a 5.5 percent stake in its Indian unit to
Piramal Healthcare Ltd. for $640 million in 2011, to comply with
rules that limited foreign ownership. The deal valued the Indian
unit at $11.6 billion at the time. Piramal Chairman  Ajay Piramal 
said in July that he planned to sell the holding back to
Vodafone next year.  Indian Rules  Vodafone  fell  0.3 percent to 225.55 pence at 8:31 a.m. in
London trading. The stock had gained 47 percent this year
through yesterday, giving the company a market value of about
109.7 billion pounds ($176 billion).  Revenue for Indian carriers is rising as call rates
increase and data consumption mounts after nearly two years of
fallout following a $30 billion scandal over what India’s
 Supreme Court  deemed “unbelievably low” prices for mobile-phone licenses.  The court canceled 122 mobile licenses in 2012, forcing
Russia’s AFK Sistema and Norway’s  Telenor ASA (TEL)  to reinvest in
airwaves after losing about $5.8 billion in combined investment.
Bahrain Telecommunications Co. and Emirates Telecommunications
Corp. both exited the market.  Vodafone India, along with its biggest competitor Bharti
Airtel Ltd., may spend more to renew airwaves in 2014 with
licenses for their 900 MHz airwaves set to expire.  To contact the reporters on this story:
