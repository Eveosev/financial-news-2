Spain ’s bonds rose, sending 10-year
yields to the least relative to German bunds since June 2011, as
an increase in retail sales added to evidence the nation’s
economic recovery is gaining momentum.  Spanish yields  dropped to the lowest since May before the
government pays interest and bond maturities of about 21 billion
euros ($28.9 billion) this week.  Italian (GBTPGR10)  securities advanced for
a second day after the country sold 8 billion euros of bills at
the lowest yield since July. Finland auctioned 1.5 billion euros
of debt due in 2018 and 2042.  German bunds  were little changed
after 10-year yields fell to the lowest in 11 weeks.  “We’ve seen a lot of economic improvement for Spain in
recent months and some progress in structural reforms, fueling
demand for Spanish bonds,” said  Felix Herrmann , a research
analyst at DZ Bank AG in  Frankfurt . “The latest strong
performance is due to Spanish coupon and redemption payments
this week. This is providing liquidity that needs to be
reinvested.”  Spain’s 10-year yield fell five basis points, or 0.05
percentage point, to 4.05 percent at 4:37 p.m. London time after
dropping to 4.04 percent, the lowest level since May 6. The 4.4
percent bond maturing in October 2023 climbed 0.425, or 4.25
euros per 1,000-euro face amount, to 102.865.  The extra yield that investors demand to hold the
securities instead of benchmark German bunds shrank four basis
points to 231 basis points after falling to 229 basis points,
the narrowest since June 8, 2011.  Retail Sales  Spain’s  retail sales  increased 2.2 percent from a year
earlier, after falling a revised 4.4 percent in August, the
National Statistics Institute said. A report tomorrow will show
the economy expanded 0.1 percent in the third quarter, according
to a Bloomberg News survey.  The nation’s bonds returned 11 percent this year through
yesterday, according to Bloomberg World Bond Indexes, on
optimism the economy is strengthening and the  European Central
Bank  will backstop the nation’s debt. Italy’s gained 6.2
percent, while German securities lost 1.4 percent.  Spain will pay out 16.2 billion euros of a maturing bond on
Oct. 31 and 4.9 billion euros of interest, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Italian Auction  Italy sold six-month bills at an average auction yield of
0.629 percent, the lowest since July 10, when the rate fell to
0.599 percent. The nation plans to sell as much as 6 billion
euros of securities due in five and 10 years tomorrow.  Italian 10-year yields declined five basis points to 4.15
percent. The spread over bunds narrowed four basis points to 241
basis points. It contracted to 227 basis points on Aug. 19, the
least since July 2011.  Finland sold 500 million euros of 30-year bonds at an
average yield of 2.756 percent, up from 2.547 percent at a sale
on June 18. Investors bid for 1.69 times the amount allotted,
versus 2.55 in June. The nation auctioned 1 billion euros of
five-year notes at 0.924 percent.  Volatility on Dutch bonds was the highest in euro-area
markets today, followed by those of Austria and Spain, according
to measures of 10-year debt, the yield spread between two- and
10-year securities and credit-default swaps.  German 10-year bund yields fell one basis point to 1.74
percent after dropping to 1.73 percent, the lowest level since
Aug. 13.  Bunds stayed little changed after ECB Governing Council
member Ewald Nowotny said policy makers were unlikely to cut
their benchmark or deposit rates.  “I do not think that having a negative deposit rate is a
realistic perspective, but I also do not see a realistic
perspective of lowering the main policy rate,” Nowotny was
cited by Market News International as saying.  Germany  is scheduled to sell 4 billion euros of 10-year
bonds tomorrow. It last sold the securities at an  average yield 
of 1.79 percent on Oct. 2.  -- Editors: Nicholas Reynolds,  Keith Jenkins   To contact the reporter on this story:
