Ryanair Pilot Group, which claims to
represent more than half of  Ryanair Holdings Plc (RYA)  cockpit crew,
urged Chief Executive Officer  Michael O’Leary  to engage in talks
on issues ranging from contracts to annual leave.  The group is asking for a common basic contract that covers
all pilots and wants Ryanair to resolve tax issues that arise as
a result of working for the airline, according to document
provided by the group. Other concerns include the annual leave
system, base transfers and reinstatement of colleagues
disciplined because of the request for representation.  “We will be very happy to agree a mutually convenient time
and location to open discussions on behalf of the majority of
pilots flying for Ryanair,” Evert van Zwol, RPG’s interim
council chairman, said in a letter to O’Leary. According to the
group, the CEO said he’ll agree to meet with representatives if
members exceeded 1,601 staff.  Ryanair pilots work 36 hours to 42 hours each week, which
includes flight time, pre- and post-flight duties, turn-around
time and training, the RPG said. Trainee first officers are also
required to pay 28,500 euros ($39,000) up-front for training
when they join the airline, according to the organization. The
airline said it had no comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
