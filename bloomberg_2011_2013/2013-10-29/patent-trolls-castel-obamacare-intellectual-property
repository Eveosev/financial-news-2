A large number of trade groups have
sent a  letter  to Congress supporting expansion of review of
business method patents.  They said in the Oct. 28 letter that patent assertion
entities -- known pejoratively as “patent trolls” -- that do
not make or sell new products or develop new technologies are
imposing “huge costs” on American businesses.  They noted that in 2011-2012, almost 7,000 businesses were
sued by this category of patent holder and that the number of
companies sued over business-method patents has increased an
average of 28 percent a year since 2004.  Because of the high cost of patent litigation -- averaging
$6 million per case -- small companies have little recourse but
to settle, even if the patents asserted may be invalid,
according to the letter. Small companies that have been targeted
are in a no-win situation in which they must either pay lawyers
to defend them or pay licensing fees to the patent owners.  They are asking that a patent office review program set up
to look at finance-related patents be expanded to cover other
classes of patents. Present programs at the U.S. Patent and
Trademark Office don’t allow the office to consider whether a
patent is abstract, vague or too broad, the group says, claiming
that many of the business-method patents for which they are
being sued by patent owners fall into these categories.  Among the signers of the letter are Airlines for America,
American Hotel & Lodging Association, Food Marketing Institute
and National Retail Federation, as well as the National
Association of Realtors, the National Grocers’ Association and
the American Public Power Association.  Additionally, San Francisco-based  Electronic Frontier
Foundation , a digital rights organization, signed the letter, as
did New York’s Public Patent Foundation.  Digital Alley Says It Doesn’t Infringe Utility Associates Patent  Digital Ally Inc., a maker of digital security products for
law enforcement, asked a court to declare it doesn’t infringe a
patent belonging to Utility Associates Inc. of Tucker,  Georgia .  At issue is a patent covering a mobile digital information
system. Digital Ally makes digital recorders, including a police
flashlight that records video whenever it is switched on.  According to the complaint filed Oct. 25 in federal court
in Kansas City, Kansas, Utility Associates has sent letters to
some Digital Ally customers, claiming that use or purchase of
Digital Ally products infringe patent 6,831,556. Two of these
customers are the state of  Nebraska  and the state of New York,
Digital Ally says.  Officials from both states have contacted Digital Alley
seeking information about the threat of litigation, according to
court papers.  Digital Ally says that the patent at issue was issued in
December 2004 and has changed hands multiple times. The systems
made by Lenexa, Kansas-based Digital Ally said its products that
are accused of infringement are essentially similar to devices
the company has been selling since 2006.  The company claims that because the products have been on
the market for this long, Utility and previous owners of the
patent have “delayed and remained silent” about the alleged
infringement until Digital Alley invested “substantial
resources” into manufacturing and promoting its products.  If Digital Ally had been informed of the alleged
infringement earlier, the company said it could have dedicated
resources to “re-designing, as necessary, around the
technology” claimed by the patent.  The  Kansas  company also said in its pleadings that it had
met with a previous owner of the patent who “misled Digital
Ally into believing” that the patent wouldn’t be used against
it.  Digital Ally asked the court to declare that neither the
company’s products nor its customers infringe the patent, and
that the patent is unenforceable because of the owners’ delay in
asserting it.  Additionally, the company asked for an order barring
Utility from claiming Digital Ally’s products or their use
infringe the patent.  Utility Associates didn’t respond immediately to an e-mailed request for comment.  The case is Digital Ally v. Utility Associates Inc., 3:13-cv-02550-SAC-KGS, U.S. District Court, District of Kansas
(Kansas City).  For more patent news, click here.  Trademark  Castel Says it Will Take Trademark Dispute to  China ’s High Court  Castel Group, the French producer of wine, beer and soft

dispute with Panati Wine, Decanter.com, the beverage-industry

damages to Panati Wine, a Shanghai-based wine distributor, for

it will file a suit against  Commonwealth Bank of Australia 
following a trademark dispute over the bank’s use of “HR
Anywhere” as the name for its human resources Web portal, Smart
Money  reported .  Although the bank has already agreed to quit using the
name, HR Anywhere says the name confusion cost the human
resources company as much as A$200,000 ($191,000) in lost
revenue, according to Smart Money.  Martin Nally, founder of the HR firm, said he learned of
the problem in February when some of Commonwealth Bank’s 50,000
employees began to call his company seeking help with human
resources problems, Smart Money reported.  A bank spokesman told Smart Money the bank is in the
process of changing the name for its program.  Bankrupt AIDS Charity Sells Trademark to New Advocacy Group  A bankruptcy judge in  Maryland  has agreed to reopen a case
involving an AIDS charity so that the charity’s trademark can be
sold, the  Washington  Blade  reported .  The mark “National Gay Men’s HIV/AIDS Awareness Day” will
be sold for $3,000 to  Health HIV , a new organization based in
Washington, the Blade reported.  The mark was owned by the  National Association of People
With AIDS , which closed in February and filed for bankruptcy
protection after its longtime president left with what court
filings indicated was an unexplained accounts receivable claim,
according to the Blade.  Brian Hujdich, executive director of Health HIV, told the
Blade that no one from the National Association of People with
AIDS would be involved in financial aspects of the new
organization.  For more trademark news, click here.  Copyright  Obamacare Website Adds in Missing Copyright Notice, License  The website set up for people to sign up for the health-care program known as Obamacare has corrected a copyright
