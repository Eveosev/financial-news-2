Rabobank Groep  announced  today that it is settling a bunch of investigations with a bunch of regulators over its manipulation of the London interbank offered rate, which is a thing that happens sometimes to European banks. The etiquette now is that I go through the documents and pick out some funny quotes, and while Rabo's Libor manipulators were maybe more buttoned-down than some of their competitors, they still  got the job done :  Or: Or: Or: Or:  Or, I mean, you get the idea, and you probably did a while back, but I find it oddly hard to stop. These Libor settlements are among other things a wonderful corpus of idiomatic international finance English; I hope some ambitious English teachers abroad will mine them for lessons the way  that Brazilian school does with Twitter .  I suppose there is other data to be mined from these settlements though. For one thing, as we get more fine-grained data about what Libor manipulation looked like, it seems … well, both more pervasive and less bad than you might have expected. (Also less grammatical!) My sense has always been that Libor was basically set up to be robust to the sort of manipulation that is documented here. Yes, Rabobank had billions of dollars of swaps that would increase in value if it submitted Libors that were too high. But UBS, say, had billions of dollars of swaps that would increase in value if it submitted Libors that were too low. Since everyone was manipulating Libor to benefit their derivatives positions, and since those derivatives positions were by definition zero-sum, the manipulation would more or less cancel itself out.* That's hard to prove empirically because … well, the Libor settlements so far are not laid out in a convenient format for empirical study.** You can find the odd two-sided market, though;  here is Rabo : Meanwhile, in another part of town, here is noted alleged Libor manipulator  Tom Hayes at UBS : So while Hayes was trying to keep one- and three-month yen Libor down on the 25th, Rabo was keeping it up, with submissions above the previous day's fixing (and above the ultimate fixing that day too).*** The system worked!?  To be fair, there are also instances in which multiple banks wanted to move the same Libor in the same direction on the same day, and in which multiple banks (and brokers) colluded together to move Libor. Which makes sense: Part of what is driving the Libor investigations is just that there was a conspiracy, with some traders and interdealer brokers trying to persuade multiple banks to manipulate their Libors the same way. So the cases that have been brought so far have a tendency to reinforce rather than cancel each others' manipulations. You can see why these interbank conspiracies would be the easiest to catch and document: If you're just manipulating for your own account there's less reason to, like, e-mail and instant message about it.**** Though not none! One weird aspect of the Rabobank case is that several of its submitters had their own derivatives positions: They weren't just manipulating Libor to help their buddies or their banks; they were manipulating it to help their own books. And, you know,  e-mailing about it  (emphasis added):  The Department of Justice statement of facts goes into a number of instances where Rabo submitters balanced supply and demand within the bank, giving priority to the traders whose positions were bigger and/or who were nicer and better friends with the submitters. There are important lessons about market microstructure to be gleaned from those instances. Libor remains a strange scandal psychologically. On the one hand, everyone knew,  and said in recorded written conversations , that what they were doing was wrong -- saying "there's bigger crooks in the market than us guys" is a pretty clear admission that you're a crook. On the other hand, everyone acted as though what they were doing was normal and above-board. So in the Rabo case, senior management seemed to think that Libor manipulation was  part of best practices :  And one of those Centres of Competence  did this , which is weird: He just wanted them to get Libor right! Where "right" meant, um, whatever you think it means (accurately reflecting market borrowing rates or whatever) when he had no position, and helpful to his position when he had a position. You get the sense that he really believed that that's how Libor was supposed to be set. * I mean, to some approximation. The net interest rate swap positions in the world need to sum to zero, but that's not true of the net interest rate swap positions of Libor submitter banks. And of course some manipulators just tried harder.  ** Some of that is just a formatting problem that could be fixed by a diligent reporter, blogger or intern sitting down and  building a searchable and sortable database   of all of the documented cases of Libor manipulation in all the settlements, categorized by date, bank, currency, tenor, manipulation direction (up or down) and outrageous instant message/e-mail quote, if available. My crack team of interns is on the case! (That sentence is false! I did start building a spreadsheet, but my attention span and analyst resources are not what they used to be.) Some of it is not; the settlements are full of vague statements  like   "The following are just some examples of the numerous" etc. etc.,  or   "These requests included: ... At least 278 JPY LIBOR requests to Broker 1," which means that any privately constructed database is unlikely to be comprehensive. Still, seems worth doing, for some value of "worth doing." *** I see 3-month yen Libor at 0.6375 percent on 24 February 2009 and 0.63625 on the 25th. One-month is 0.3750 and 0.37625. So Rabo's submissions were above the previous day's fix in both tenors, and moved the 1-month up a touch despite Hayes's efforts, while Hayes did manage to move the 3-month down.  **** Investigators seem to find this downright unsporting, as in the case of RBS, which moved its swaps traders to  sit next to its Libor submitters  for a while.  Eventually it stopped doing that, and, "When they were no longer in close proximity to the submitters, the traders increased their use of Bloomberg chats and instant messages to continue making requests for beneficial submissions, which were frequently accommodated." Which I'm sure the investigators appreciated.
