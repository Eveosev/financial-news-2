Sonaecom SGPS SA offered to buy back
as much as 24.2 percent of its stock, eliminating its free
float, after it completed the merger of its mobile phone unit
Optimus with a cable operator in  Portugal .  Sonaecom is bidding as much as 216.8 million euros, the
equivalent of 2.45 euros apiece for 88.5 million shares.
Investors accepting the offer will receive shares in Zon Optimus
SGPS, the telecommunications company formed by the merger,
Sonaecom said in a regulatory filing yesterday.  The offer would remove from the market all the Sonaecom
shares not controlled by parent company Sonae SGPS SA,
Portugal’s biggest food retailer in terms of domestic sales, or
by Sonae-affiliated companies and investors. Those shareholders
own 74.3 percent of Sonaecom stock, and the remaining 1.5
percent is held by Sonaecom as treasury shares.  Optimus entered Portugal’s mobile market in 1998, grabbing
a 19 percent of the market from Portugal Telecom SGPS SA and
 Vodafone Group Plc (VOD)  before Sonaecom’s 2000 IPO. It was never able
to catch up with either of its larger competitors.  Sonaecom in August completed the merger of Optimus with
what was formerly known as Zon Multimedia SGPS SA, the country’s
biggest cable-television provider. Zon Optimus competes against
Portugal Telecom and Vodafone for cable-television, Internet and
telephone clients in Portugal.  Sonaecom rose 2.2 percent to close at 2.29 euros before the
announcement in Lisbon yesterday. The  shares  have climbed 54
percent this year through yesterday’s close.  To contact the reporter on this story:
