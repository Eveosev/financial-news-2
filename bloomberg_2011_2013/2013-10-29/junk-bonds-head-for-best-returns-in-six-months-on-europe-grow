High-yield bonds are set to hand
investors the best monthly returns since April in  Europe  as the
euro-area recovers from its longest recession.  Speculative-grade debt from companies such as Wind
Telecomunicazioni SpA and Fiat SpA returned an average 1.7
percent this month, Bloomberg  bond index  data show. AA Group
Ltd., the roadside recovery and insurance division of
Folkestone, England-based Acromas Holdings Ltd., is marketing
payment-in-kind toggle notes to refinance existing debt,
according to a person familiar with the matter.  “European high-yield is in a sweet spot at the moment as
there is some growth, but not so much that shareholders benefit
over bondholders,” said Fraser Lundie, co-head of credit at
Hermes Fund Managers Ltd. in  London , which oversees about $40
billion. “High yield tends to perform well in a low growth
environment like this. We’re seeing a lot of PIK deals and low-rated issuers coming to the market.”  Non-financial borrowers sold 3.8 billion euros ($5.2
billion) of junk-rated bonds this month, up from 2 billion euros
in October 2012, Bloomberg data show. While the euro-area
economy expanded 0.3 percent in the second quarter, growth is
being restricted by unemployment, which held at 12 percent in
September, according to the median of 36 forecasts in a
Bloomberg survey of economists.  AA plans to sell 350 million pounds ($563 million) of
senior PIK toggle notes maturing in six years through its AA PIK
Co Ltd. unit, the person said. PIK notes give borrowers the
option of paying coupons with cash or more debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
