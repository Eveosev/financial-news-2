Four French hostages kidnapped three
years ago in  Niger  have been released, French President  Francois Hollande  said during a visit to Slovakia.  They were seized Sept. 16, 2010 by an al-Qaeda offshoot
near the uranium mine where they worked in northern Niger.  Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius and Defense Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian have flown to Niamey, the capital of Niger, to
accompany the former hostages back to  France , Hollande said.  Rene Robert, the grandfather of one of the hostages, told
iTele television that Hollande phoned him today to give him the
news, saying the four men were in good health.  Hollande gave no details about the release.  “I said from the moment I became president that I would
use all the contacts possible to win their release,” Hollande
said. France no longer pays ransoms for its hostages, he has
said.  Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, which operates across the
Sahara, initially kidnapped seven people near the Arlit uranium
mine. The following February, they released a French woman as
well as a citizen of Togo and one from Madagascar.  Last month, a Mauritanian  news agency  received a video
showing the four men, the first sign of their life in a year.  Today’s releases leave three French still held hostage by
other groups in the Sahel and four in  Syria .  To contact the reporter on this story:
