Aflac Inc. (AFL) , the largest seller of
supplemental health coverage, said third-quarter profit fell 31
percent as sales slowed in  Japan . The firm increased its
quarterly dividend.  Net income  dropped to $702 million, or $1.50 a share, from
$1 billion, or $2.16, a year earlier, the Columbus, Georgia-based insurer said today in a statement. Operating profit, which
excludes some investment results, was $1.47 a share, missing the
$1.48  average estimate  of 21 analysts in a Bloomberg survey.  Aflac, which uses a talking duck in advertisements, counts
Japan as its largest market. Chief Executive Officer Dan Amos,
62, has been working to increase revenue there through marketing
partnerships such as with Japan Post Holdings Co., after higher
prices for some products cut into sales. A decline in the yen
also weighed on profit, as Aflac converts results from the
Japanese currency to dollars for reporting purposes.  “They’ve been hurt somewhat by the weak yen,” Robert McMillan, an equity analyst at Standard & Poor’s Capital IQ,
said by phone before results were announced. “There should be
benefits from partnering” with  Japan Post .  New annualized premium sales in Japan fell 42 percent in
the quarter to 32.4 billion yen ($330 million), compared with a
32 percent increase a year earlier. In the U.S., sales fell 1.5
percent to $330 million.  Boosts Dividend  Aflac fell 1.5 percent to $66 at 4:57 p.m. in New York. The
shares gained 26 percent this year through the end of regular
trading today, outpacing the 24 percent advance of the  Standard
& Poor’s 500 Index. (SPX)   The firm increased its quarterly dividend 5.7 percent to 37
cents a share, matching the Bloomberg Dividend Forecast. Aflac
said it may increase the pace of share repurchases after
improvements in its solvency margin ratio, or SMR, a metric
reviewed by regulators in Japan. The company now expects to buy
back $800 million to $1 billion in stock next year, compared
with a previous range of $600 million to $900 million.  A reinsurance agreement in Japan, which helps transfer
risk, improved the SMR to about 730 percent on Sept. 30 from 585
percent three months earlier, Aflac said. The company also
increased investments in Japanese  government bonds , after
announcing in July that it would limit investments in U.S.
corporate debt amid volatility in fixed-income markets.  Book value, a measure of assets minus liabilities, rose to
$31.47 a share, from $29.46 three months earlier. The yen traded
at 98.27 per dollar on Sept. 30, weaker than the 77.96 level at
the end of the third quarter of 2012.  The insurer reached a deal in July with Japan Post to sell
policies in as many as 20,000 post offices. Aflac currently
offers the coverage in about 1,000 locations. In September,
Daido Life Insurance Co. agreed to sell Aflac’s cancer policies
to members of an organization of small and mid-size companies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
