Verbund AG (VER) ,  Austria ’s biggest
utility, raised its full-year earnings outlook following one-time gains from asset sales in  Turkey .  Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization will rise to 1.25 billion euros ($1.72 billion) in
2013, the Vienna-based company said today in a statement. That
compares with the 1.15 billion euros previously forecast.  Verbund, which generates most of its power from hydro
plants in the Alps and along Austrian rivers, swapped generation
assets in Turkey with EON SE in December after deciding to
curtail its international expansion and focus on Austria and
southern  Germany .  Verbund rose as much as 3.5 percent in Vienna trading
today, the biggest intraday gain since Oct. 18. The stock was up
2.3 percent at 17.60 euros as of 9:10 a.m. local time, paring
its decline this year to 6.2 percent.  Third-quarter net income fell 48 percent to 62.2 million
euros as a result of unprofitable natural-gas and wind-power
projects. That missed the 67.8 million-euro average estimate of
six analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Verbund reiterated a
forecast for full-year net income of about 600 million euros and
expects to pay a 1-euro dividend for 2013.  “The situation in the European energy markets remains
challenging,” the management board wrote in a letter to
shareholders. “Excess capacities in electricity generation,
extensive over-subsidization of new renewable energy and a non-functioning CO2 market” have caused prices to stagnate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
