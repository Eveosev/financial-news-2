China Petroleum & Chemical Corp. (386) ,
Asiaâ€™s biggest refiner, posted a 20 percent increase in third-quarter profit, beating estimates, as higher retail fuel prices
helped margins.  Net income rose to 22 billion  yuan  ($3.6 billion), or 0.18
yuan a share, from 18.3 billion yuan, or 0.15 yuan, a year ago,
the company said in a statement to the Shanghai Stock Exchange
today. The  median  of eight analyst estimates compiled by
Bloomberg was 19.3 billion yuan.  Operating profit from the refining business was 6.7 billion
yuan in the first nine months, compared with a loss a year
earlier, said the company, known as Sinopec.  Crude and natural gas production rose 4 percent in the
first nine months to 331 million barrels, according to the
statement.  Sinopec rose 1.5 percent to HK$6.06 in Hong Kong today,
before the earnings announcement. The shares have declined 10
percent this year, compared with a 0.8 percent gain in the
benchmark  Hang Seng Index .  To contact the reporters on this story:
