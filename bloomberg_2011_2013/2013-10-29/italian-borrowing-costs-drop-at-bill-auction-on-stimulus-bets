Italian borrowing costs dropped at
an auction of six-month bills amid expectations policy makers
will refrain from tapering stimulus.  The Rome-based Treasury sold 8 billion euros ($11 billion)
of 181-day bills at 0.629 percent, down from 0.781 percent at
the previous auction on Sept. 26. Investors bid for 1.82 times
the amount offered, compared with 1.45 last month. Italy will
redeem 9.2 billion euros of bills Oct. 31.  Bond investors are being encouraged by speculation the
 Federal Reserve  won’t reduce its stimulus program until March as
policy makers await signs the U.S. economy and labor market are
improving.  The European Central Bank’s policy makers have pledged in
July to keep official  interest rates  at or below current levels
for an extended period, without specifying a time frame.  “Given the market environment and the ECB’s stance, we
regard a further decline in BOT rates in the coming months as
likely,” Elia Lattuga, a fixed-income strategist at  UniCredit
SpA (UCG) , wrote in a note to investors yesterday.  Italy’s 10-year bond yield dropped 7 basis points to 4.13
percent at 11:08 a.m. in Rome, leaving the difference with
comparable German bunds at 239.1 basis points.  Italy returns to the market tomorrow with the sale of as
much as 6 billion euros of five and 10-year bonds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
