Mainstream Renewable Power Ltd., a
Dublin-based renewable-energy developer, will build three wind
farms totaling 360 megawatts in South Africa.  Construction on the projects in the Northern Cape province
is expected to begin next year after financing closes on the
wind farms, closely held Mainstream Renewable Power said in a
statement today.  Mainstream is investing about 9 billion rand ($910 million)
in the project, Emmet Curley, a spokesman, said in a phone
interview. The projectsâ€™ debt has been arranged and underwritten
by Barclays Plc, the Development Bank of Southern Africa and
Eksport Kredit Fonden, the Danish export credit agency.  To contact the reporter on this story:
