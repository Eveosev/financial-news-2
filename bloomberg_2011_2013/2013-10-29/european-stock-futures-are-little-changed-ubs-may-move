European stocks  rose as companies
from BP Plc to  UBS (UBSN)  AG reported earnings and the Federal Reserve
began a two-day meeting.  BP advanced 5.6 percent after increasing its dividend.
 Nokia Oyj (NOK1V)  rose the most on the Stoxx Europe 600 Index after
forecasting rising profit margins at its network unit. UBS AG
dropped the most in more than two years after saying it probably
won’t reach its profitability goal in 2015 after the Swiss
regulator demanded the country’s largest lender hold more
capital for risks related to litigation.  The Stoxx 600 added 0.4 percent to 320.77 at the close of
trading. The gauge fell 0.2 percent yesterday, snapping a three-week rally, as U.S. factory production and home sales missed
forecasts. It has still soared 15 percent in 2013, closing at a
five-year high on Oct. 22, as central banks around the world
pledged to leave interest rates low for a prolonged period.  “The Fed meeting is in focus and it is likely that the
Committee will view weak U.S. economic reports as not supportive
of tapering in 2013,” said Lorne Baring, who oversees about
$500 million as managing director of B Capital SA in Geneva.
“The overreaction to the mention of tapering is now over.
Underlying sentiment is still positive and I think European
stocks still offer more intrinsic value than U.S. equities.”  The Federal Open Market Committee started a two-day meeting
today to consider when to begin trimming the $85 billion-a-month
of bond purchases that have buoyed global markets. Policy makers
will hold off paring stimulus measures until the March 18-19
meeting, a Bloomberg survey showed this month.  Retail Sales  Retail sales  in the U.S. outside of auto dealers climbed in
September. The 0.4 percent gain in purchases excluding vehicles
followed a 0.1 percent increase in August and matched the median
forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg, Commerce
Department figures showed today in  Washington .  A separate report showed that confidence among U.S.
consumers declined in October by the most since August 2011. The
Conference Board’s  index  fell to 71.2 in October from a revised
80.2 the month prior, the New York-based private research group
said today. The median forecast in a Bloomberg survey of
economists called for a reading of 75.  National benchmark indexes rose in 16 of the 18 Western-European markets. The U.K’s FTSE 100 gained 0.7 percent,
 Germany ’s DAX Index added 0.5 percent and  France ’s CAC 40
increased 0.6 percent.  BP (BP/)  added 5.6 percent to 477.5 pence, its biggest gain since
January 2011. Europe’s third-largest oil company raised its
dividend by 5.6 percent to 9.5 cents a share. Profit adjusted
for one-time items and inventory changes dropped to $3.7 billion
from $5 billion a year earlier, beating the $3.4 billion average
estimate of 13 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Best Performance  A gauge of European oil and gas companies posted the  best
performance  of the 19 industry groups in the Stoxx 600, gaining
1.9 percent to a nine-month high. Saipem SpA rallied 4.7 percent
to 17.04 euros and Fugro NV added 2 percent to 46.48 euros.  Nokia Oyj jumped 7 percent to 5.35 euros. The Espoo,
Finland-based company forecast rising profit margins at the
network operation that will become its main business after the
mobile-phone division it is sold to  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)  Operating
profit, excluding some costs, will be as high as 16 percent of
sales at the unit this quarter, Nokia  said today .  Nokia also reported a net loss in the third quarter that
narrowed to 91 million euros from 959 million euros a year
earlier. Analysts had projected a 171.5 million-euro loss.  OC Oerlikon Corp. (OERL)  climbed 1.6 percent to 12.65 Swiss
francs. The maker of textile machinery reported third-quarter
earnings before interest and taxes of 88 million francs ($98
million), beating the 86 million francs analysts had forecast.  UBS Tumbles  UBS slid 7.7 percent to 17.70 francs. The bank’s target of
reaching 15 percent return on equity in 2015 will be delayed by
at least a year unless the regulator removes its capital demand,
the Zurich-based lender said in a statement. UBS also reported
third-quarter net income of 577 million francs, beating the
average analyst estimate that called for 561 million francs.  “It’s disappointing that the capital ratio will decline,”
Andreas Venditti, an analyst at Zuercher Kantonalbank AG in
Zurich, wrote in a note to clients today. “The market expected
a significant increase. This should disappoint certain hopes in
the market for a high dividend next spring.”  Michelin & Cie. (ML) , Europe’s largest tiremaker, slipped 3.7
percent to 76.78 euros. Sales in the third quarter fell 5.8
percent to 5.12 billion euros from 5.44 billion euros a year
earlier. That missed the 5.33 billion-euro average of five
analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
