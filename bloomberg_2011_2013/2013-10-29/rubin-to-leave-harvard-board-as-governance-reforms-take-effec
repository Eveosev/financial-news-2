Robert Rubin , the former U.S.
Treasury Secretary, will leave Harvard University’s governing
board next year as new rules limiting the terms for fellows take
effect.  Rubin and  Robert Reischauer , former president of the Urban
Institute and the Harvard Corporation’s senior fellow, will both
step down on June 30 after 12 years on the board, the
university, based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, said today in a
statement. William F. Lee, an intellectual property attorney,
will become senior fellow.  Harvard overhauled its governance rules for the
corporation, formally known as the President and Fellows of
 Harvard College , in 2010 after a series of financial
miscalculations and losses. Harvard saw its endowment
investments plunge 27 percent and it paid almost $1 billion to
terminate wrong-way bets it made in  interest-rate swaps . Among
the changes were adding seats to the corporation for the first
time since 1650, which expanded the body from seven to 13, and
introducing 12-year term limits for fellows.  Rubin, who was also co-chairman Goldman Sachs & Co., and
Reischauer have served on the Harvard board since 2002 and
helped oversee the university when it entered into the costly
interest-rate swaps.  To contact the reporter on this story:
