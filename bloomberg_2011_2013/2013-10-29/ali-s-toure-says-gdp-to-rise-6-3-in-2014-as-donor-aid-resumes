Mali’s economy will expand 6.3
percent next year as international donors restart aid to
Africa’s third-largest gold producer after the first election
since a military coup in March 2012.  Inflation will quicken to 3 percent in 2014 from 1.2
percent in 2013 and the  budget deficit  will widen to 6.2 percent
of gross next year from 5.2 percent, Madani Toure, Mali’s
minister in charge of budget, said in an interview in Ghana’s
capital, Accra, yesterday  Mali’s $10.6 billion economy contracted 1.2 percent in 2012
and may expand 4.8 percent this year, according to the
 International Monetary Fund . The nation expects to access $4
billion pledged by international donors. Donors include France,
Denmark, the  World Bank  and the  African Development Bank , Toure
said.  Former Prime Minister Ibrahim Boubacar Keita won the
presidential elections in August after the nation nearly split
because of a lack of government support in a battle against
ethnic-Touareg rebels in the country’s north. French forces
intervened in January to aid the former colony.  “We have received huge pledges of budgetary support since
the war ended,” Toure said. “Developmental projects comprising
roads and sanitation which were suspended because of the war are
restarting. We are recovering in all sectors except the mining
sector.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
