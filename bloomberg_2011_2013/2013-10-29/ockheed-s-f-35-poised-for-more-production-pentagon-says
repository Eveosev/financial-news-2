Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT) ’s F-35 fighter
is poised for expanded production in fiscal 2015, according to
the Pentagon’s top weapons buyer.  “While risks remain, progress on the F-35 program at this
point has been adequate to support a decision to budget for
increased rates,” Frank Kendall, under secretary for
acquisition, said in a decision memo to the Air Force and Navy
secretaries dated yesterday.  Kendall said that the award of annual contracts for
increased quantities is contingent on improvements in software
development, reliability -- which he said “is not growing at an
acceptable rate” -- and available funding, as the Pentagon
faces billions of dollars in automatic cuts known as
sequestration.  “The magnitude of the increase will be determined” by
Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel as the Pentagon “finalizes its
fiscal 2015 budget,” according to the two-page Kendall memo
circulating inside the Navy and  Air Force . “Progress in the
development program has been close to plan,” Kendall said.  Kendall’s decision memo outlines the findings from a
Defense Acquisition Board program review on Oct. 21. While the
memo isn’t a guarantee that quantities will be increased in
annual contracts, it indicates Kendall is confident that money
can be budgeted in the five-year fiscal 2015 plan to be released
next year.  The Pentagon’s current five-year plan calls for increasing
F-35 production to 42 jets in fiscal 2015, which begins Oct. 1,
2014, from 29 this year and in fiscal 2013. The rate would
increase to 62 in 2016, 76 in 2017 and 100 in 2018, according to
internal Pentagon budget documents. The new plan will be
released next year with the Pentagon’s fiscal 2015 budget plan.  Increasing Costs  The Pentagon’s projected price tag of $391.2 billion for a
fleet of 2,443 aircraft is a 68 percent increase from the
projection in 2001, as measured in current dollars. The number
of aircraft also is 409 fewer than called for in the original
program.  The rising costs and troubles in building the plane at the
same time that it’s being developed have led to criticism in
Congress. This year, lawmakers, the Government Accountability
Office and the Pentagon test office have said the aircraft is
making progress in flight tests and in stabilizing production.  To contact the reporter on this story:
