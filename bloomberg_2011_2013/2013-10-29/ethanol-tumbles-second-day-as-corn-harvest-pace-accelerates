Ethanol futures tumbled for a second
day as the government said farmers accelerated the pace of the
corn harvest.  Prices fell 1.6 percent after the Agriculture Department
said 59 percent of a record  corn crop  was collected as of Oct.
27, up from 39 percent the previous week. The grain is the
primary ingredient in U.S. ethanol. Production has jumped 15
percent from a record low in January, according the Energy
Information Administration.  “The weather was good and it was a pretty hefty jump in
harvest,” said Mike Blackford, a consultant at Intl FCStone in
 Des Moines ,  Iowa .  Denatured ethanol for November delivery fell 3 cents to
$1.801 a gallon on the  Chicago  Board of Trade. Futures are down
18 percent this year.  Gasoline for November delivery sank 2.11 cents, or 0.8
percent, to $2.6098 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . The contract covers reformulated gasoline, made to be
blended with ethanol before delivery to filling stations.  Ethanol’s discount to the motor fuel widened by 0.89 cent
to 80.88 cents a gallon, the largest differential since Oct. 21.  Blackford said increased corn supplies probably allowed the
ethanol industry to boost production capacity by 100 million
gallons over the past two weeks.  Pratt Energy said last week it has restarted operations at
a 55 million-gallon-a-year plant in  Kansas  that had been idle
for five years.  Corn Futures  Corn for December delivery added 1.25 cents to $4.32 a
bushel in Chicago. The December crush spread of corn to ethanol
was 9 cents, down from 11 cents yesterday, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  Ethanol  production  jumped 3.2 percent to 897,000 barrels a
day in the week ended Oct. 18, the highest level since June
2012, EIA data show.  Inventories were at 15.5 million barrels, down 17 percent
from a year ago, according to the EIA, the Energy Department’s
analytical arm.  The agency is scheduled to release the latest production
and supply data at 10:30 a.m. tomorrow in  Washington .  The Environmental Protection Agency tracks compliance with
the federal ethanol-use mandate with Renewable Identification
Numbers, or RINs, tradable certificates that are attached to
each gallon of biofuel.  Corn-based RINs rose 1.5 cents to 22.5 cents, data compiled
by Bloomberg show.  In cash market trading, ethanol sank 12.5 cents to $2 a
gallon on the  Gulf Coast , 10.5 cents to $1.93 in Chicago, 11
cents to $2.045 in  New York  and 15 cents to $2.035 on the West
Coast, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  West Coast ethanol’s premium to the Gulf widened by 2.5
cents to 3.5 cents, while Chicago’s discount to New York Harbor
expanded 0.5 cent to 11.5 cents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
