An independent  Scotland  would lose
automatic access to the U.K.’s security and intelligence
services to help tackle terrorism, cybersecurity attacks or
organized crime, Home Secretary Theresa May said today.  Scotland would no longer be entitled to see secret
intelligence passed on to the rest of the U.K. by another
country such as the U.S., May said in Edinburgh as she published
the latest in a series of papers by the U.K. government setting
out the implications of independence.  “Scotland would lose the economies of scale intrinsic to
the existing U.K.-wide arrangements and therefore may have to
accept less efficient and effective capabilities,” the paper
said. “Scotland would be exchanging the absolute entitlement it
has as part of the U.K. for increased bureaucracy, greater
formality and partial co-operation only when it was in both
parties’ interests.”  Independence is the flagship policy of First Minister  Alex Salmond ’s  Scottish National Party  that runs the semi-autonomous
government in Edinburgh. A referendum on Scottish independence
will be held next September.  The SNP said last year it planned to spend 2.5 billion
pounds ($4 billion) a year on defense and security. That
compares with current U.K. spending of about 35 billion pounds.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
