Hong Kong  stocks  rose for a second
day as China’s central bank added funds to the financial system
for the first time in two weeks, helping alleviate a cash
squeeze.  The  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  added 0.4 percent to 22,890.97 as of
9:31 a.m. in Hong Kong, putting the gauge on course for a 0.2
percent advance in October. The  Hang Seng China Enterprises
Index (HSCEI)  of mainland companies listed in the city jumped 0.9
percent to 10,351.87.  The People’s Bank of China will conduct 13 billion  yuan 
($2.1 billion) of seven-day reverse repurchase agreements today,
according to a trader at a primary dealer required to bid at the
auctions. Money-market rates in the world’s second-biggest
economy surged through Oct. 25 as the central bank refrained
from from injecting funds into the banking system.  The  Hang Seng Index  traded at 10.9 times estimated earnings
yesterday, compared with 15.9 for the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index.  Futures on the  S&P 500  lost 0.1 percent today before the
Federal Open Market Committee begins a two-day meeting.  The Fed is likely to delay reducing its $85 billion in
monthly bond purchases until March, according to a Bloomberg
News survey of economists conducted Oct. 17-18. The FOMC
surprised investors last month by maintaining its unprecedented
level of stimulus even as a separate Bloomberg survey indicated
the central bank was likely to taper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
