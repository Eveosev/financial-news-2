The won closed 0.6 percent off a
two-year high as  South Korea ’s current-account surplus widened
and its export outlook improved.  Government bonds  rose.  The excess in the broadest measure of trade expanded to
$6.57 billion in September from a revised $5.68 billion in
August, official data showed. Asia’s fourth-largest economy will
likely post record exports in October, Trade Minister Yoon Sang
Jick said today before figures due Nov. 1. Global funds bought
more local equities than they sold for a record 43rd day,
exchange data show, as the  Federal Open Market Committee  starts
a two-day meeting to consider whether to taper its stimulus.  “The current account surplus supports the won,” said Jude Noh, chief currency trader at Suhyup Bank in  Seoul . “Investors
are in a wait-and-see mode before the FOMC meeting, although
it’s likely the Fed will keep its previous policy stance.”  The won closed at 1,060.62 per dollar in Seoul, compared
with 1,061 yesterday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The currency touched 1,054.35 on Oct. 24, the strongest level
since August 2011. One-month implied volatility, a measure of
expected moves in the  exchange rate  used to price options, fell
11 basis points, or 0.11 percentage point, to 5.85 percent.  South Korea will achieve a $63 billion current-account
surplus this year, Bank of Korea Director General Jung Yung Taek
said at a briefing in Seoul today. Exports in October were
“very good,” driven by sales of phones and auto parts, he
said.  The won may appreciate further next year because of
improved exports and a current-account surplus, Wai Ho Leong, a
Singapore-based economist at Barclays Bank Plc., said in an e-mail response today.  The yield on the government’s 2.75 percent sovereign bonds
due June 2016 dropped one basis point to 2.81 percent, according
to Korea Exchange Inc. prices.  To contact the reporter on this story:
