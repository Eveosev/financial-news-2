Dell Inc. (DELL)  said Chief Executive
Officer  Michael Dell  and Silver Lake Management LLC have
completed their $24.9 billion leveraged buyout after pushing for
most of this year to take the computer maker private.  Shareholders will get $13.75 in cash for each common share
and a special dividend of 13 cents a share for a total of
$13.88, the company said in a statement today. Dell was  trading 
lower than $9 before Bloomberg News reported in January that the
CEO was seeking to turn the third-largest personal-computer
maker into a private company.  CEO Dell and Silver Lake prevailed in a protracted takeover
struggle against billionaire financier  Carl Icahn  and other
investors who wanted more for their  stakes . Dell is taking the
company he founded in 1984 private to bolster its standing in
the troubled PC market, where consumers are shunning laptops and
desktops in favor of mobile devices, and expand in computer
hardware and software for corporate-data centers.  “Today, Dell enters an exciting new chapter as a private
enterprise,” CEO Dell said in the statement. “Our 110,000 team
members worldwide are 100 percent focused on our customers and
aggressively executing our long-term strategy for their
benefit.”  Shares in Round Rock, Texas-based Dell will end trading
when the market closes today, and will be delisted from the
Nasdaq. The stock was trading up less than 1 percent at $13.86
at 12:19 p.m. in New York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
