NQ Mobile Inc. (NQ) , the Chinese mobile-services provider that sank 62 percent in the three days after
 Muddy Waters LLC  said it inflated sales, rose as the company
took steps to make its bank deposits more transparent.  American depositary receipts of NQ Mobile jumped 7.6
percent to $9.47 at 10:50 a.m. in New York, advancing for the
first time since Oct. 18.  Muddy Waters , the research firm
founded by short seller Carson Block, said in an Oct. 24 report
that the company inflated revenue and misrepresented cash
balances. NQ Mobile denied the allegations the next day.  NQ Mobile transferred 100 million yuan ($16.4 million) of
deposits to  Standard Chartered Plc (STAN)  and authorized it to
independently verify the company’s deposits as well as provide
details to investors seeking the information. Separately, the
Beijing-based company said that  China Mobile Ltd. (CHL) , the nation’s
biggest wireless operator, allowed the use of NQ Mobile’s
technology in the carrier’s music service.  “NQ’s statements on its bank deposits with Standard
Chartered and cooperation with China Mobile, a big telecom
operator, are helpful to its stock,” Echo He, an analyst at
Maxim Group LLC, said by phone from  New York  today. “An even
more effective way for the company to prove itself would be data
from an independent party that can verify its market share and
business performance.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
