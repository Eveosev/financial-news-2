BYD Co. (1211) , the Chinese automaker part-owned by  Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A) , forecast full-year profit will
surge as much as 619 percent on improved car sales and narrowing
losses in its solar-energy business.  BYD expects net income to be 545.1 million  yuan  ($89
million) to 585.1 million yuan for 2013, the Shenzhen, China-based company said in a statement to the city’s stock exchange
yesterday. That compares with the 766 million-yuan median of
eight  analysts’ estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  Billionaire founder and chairman  Wang Chuanfu  has predicted
a “second takeoff” in 2013 as BYD completes a three-year
restructuring. In that time, profit tumbled 97 percent because
of losses at its photovoltaic business, a decline in global
battery demand and a slump in car deliveries.  The company expects auto sales and profit to increase in
the fourth quarter, a traditional peak season for car sales,
driven by demand for models including the Speed sedan and S6
SUV, according to its statement. BYD’s handset components and
assembly business will remain stable, while favorable government
policies and a recovery in global demand will help further
narrow losses at the solar business, the company said.  BYD yesterday said third-quarter net income rose 727
percent to 38.2 million yuan. Its Hong Kong-traded shares have
climbed 63 percent this year, compared with the 0.8 percent gain
in the benchmark  Hang Seng Index .  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
