The  yuan  fell the most in more than
two weeks as China’s central bank lowered the currency’s daily
fixing by the most in a week.  The People’s Bank of China cut the  reference rate , which
restricts the onshore yuan’s moves to a maximum 1 percent on
either side, by 0.06 percent to 6.1373 per dollar. The yuan has
risen 2.3 percent this year and touched a 20-year high of 6.0802
per dollar in Shanghai last week.  “Chinese authorities would be quite interested in trying
to stabilize the currency a bit,” said Cliff Tan, East Asian
head of global markets research at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ
Ltd. in  Hong Kong . “In both onshore and offshore markets,
there’s been a lot of enthusiasm for the  renminbi .”  The yuan in Shanghai declined 0.08 percent, the most since
Oct. 11, to 6.0902 per dollar, China Foreign Exchange Trade
System prices show. Non-deliverable yuan forwards due in 12
months fell 0.07 percent to 6.1554 in Hong Kong.  The forwards traded at a 1.1 percent  discount  to the
onshore spot rate, compared with as much as 2.8 percent in June,
data compiled by Bloomberg show. In Hong Kong’s offshore market,
the yuan slipped 0.09 percent to 6.0810, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  One-month implied volatility in the onshore yuan, a measure
of expected moves in the  exchange rate  used to price options,
was little changed at 1.3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
