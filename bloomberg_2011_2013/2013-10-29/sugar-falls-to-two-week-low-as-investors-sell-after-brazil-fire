Sugar fell to a two-week low in New
York as investors sold futures and traders judged a fire at the
port of Santos in  Brazil , the world’s top producer, will have
limited impact on supplies. Coffee retreated.  Small and large speculators excluding  index funds  held a
 net-long position  of 164,104 contracts in the week ended Oct. 8,
the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission said yesterday,
updating its reports after a government shutdown. That was more
than traders forecast, said INTL FCStone do Brasil. Slower
Chinese imports and rising exports from  India , the world’s
second-biggest producer, will more than offset the Santos fire
that damaged six warehouses owned by Copersucar SA and destroyed
180,000 metric tons of the sweetener.  “Some could be surprised speculators’ net-long positions
were already so high on Oct. 8,” Bruno Zaneti, a consultant at
FCStone do Brasil, said by phone from Campinas. “Net-long
positions probably got around 200,000 contracts at about the
time of the Copersucar event. In the short-term, the market
became more technical and entered a profit-taking lower trend.”  Raw sugar for delivery in March declined 1.3 percent to
18.66 cents a pound by 8:04 a.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in  New
York . The price touched 18.61 cents a pound, the lowest for a
most-active contract since Oct. 15. Refined, or white, sugar for
December delivery retreated 1.4 percent to $492.60 a ton on NYSE
Liffe in London.  After Copersucar  While Brazil’s center south, the largest producing region,
may ship 500,000 tons less than a year earlier at the peak of
its production cycle in the third quarter, that will still leave
a global export glut of 1.5 million tons in the period,
according to Kingsman SA, a Lausanne, Switzerland-based research
company. As Brazil is at the end of its 2013-14 harvest, other
terminals than Copersucar’s can be used to handle the nation’s
sugar exports.  Arabica coffee for delivery in December retreated 0.2
percent to $1.073 a pound in New York. Prices touched $1.066 a
pound, the lowest for a most-active contract since March 2009.
Futures trading volumes were 84 percent higher than the average
for the past 100 days for this time of day, data compiled by
Bloomberg showed. In  London , robusta coffee for delivery in
January fell 0.3 percent to $1,496 a ton.  “Abundant supply coming from  Latin America , coupled with
continued weakness of the Brazilian real against the dollar, is
weighing on arabica coffee prices,” Simona Gambarini, an
associate director at ETF Securities Ltd., said in a report e-mailed today. “With prices this low, investor interest in
coffee has risen, attracting over $100 million of inflows into
ETFS ETPs since the beginning of 2013.”  Cocoa for December delivery rose 0.1 percent to $2,686 a
ton on ICE. Cocoa for March delivery gained 0.4 percent to 1,707
pounds ($2,743) a ton on NYSE Liffe.  Bean deliveries to ports in  Ivory Coast , the world’s
leading cocoa producer, almost doubled from the start of the
season on Oct. 1 through to Oct. 27, according to data on the
website of KnowledgeCharts, a unit of Commodities Risk Analysis
in Bethlehem,  Pennsylvania . Arrivals amounted to 163,000 tons
from 85,000 tons in the same period a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
