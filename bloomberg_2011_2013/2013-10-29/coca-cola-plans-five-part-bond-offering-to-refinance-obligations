Coca-Cola Co. (KO)  raised $5 billion in
its biggest bond offering ever as the world’s largest beverage
company prepares to refinance debt with borrowing costs falling
back toward a record low.  The soft-drinks maker issued equal $500 million portions of
fixed- and floating-rate securities due in 2016, two $1.25
billion pieces that mature in 2018 and 2020 and $1.5 billion of
10-year bonds, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The transaction comes two weeks after the Atlanta-based
company reported a 5.9 percent increase in third-quarter profit
to $2.45 billion with Chief Executive Officer  Muhtar Kent 
working to raise prices and entice customers to grab a drink on
the go. Kent has forecast the company and its bottlers would
reach $200 billion in global revenue by 2020, double the amount
generated in 2010.  “The company remains on track to deliver on its 2020
vision of doubling revenues,” Edward Mui, an analyst at New
York-based debt researcher CreditSights Inc., wrote today in a
report that maintained an “outperform” ranking on Coca-Cola
bonds. The beverage maker has a “large and diverse
international footprint, stable and robust free cash flows, and
healthy credit metrics,” Mui wrote.  2010 Sale  Today’s sale exceeds a $4.5 billion offering in November
2010, Bloomberg data show. Proceeds will be used to repay or
redeem its $1.25 billion of 0.75 percent bonds due Nov. 15, as
well as $1 billion of floaters and $900 million of 3.625 percent
notes both maturing in March, Coca-Cola said today in a
regulatory filing.  The three-year floaters pay 10 basis points more than the
London interbank offered rate, and the similar-maturity 0.75
percent bonds yield 22 basis points more than Treasuries,
Bloomberg data show. The 1.65 percent five-year debentures have
a spread of 42, the 2.45 percent seven-year securities pay an
extra 60, and the 3.2 percent 10-year bonds yield 70 more than
benchmarks.  The spread on the 2023 bonds exceeds the relative yield on
Coca-Cola’s similar-maturity outstanding bonds as of yesterday
by 7 basis points, Bloomberg Valuation  estimates  show.  Average yields on dollar-denominated investment-grade bonds
fell to 3.19 percent yesterday from a more than 19-month high of
3.67 percent on Sept. 5, according to Bank of America Merrill
Lynch index data. They reached a record-low 2.65 percent in May
and have averaged 5.87 percent during the past two decades.  Coca-Cola  is ranked  Aa3 at Moody’s Investors Service, an
equivalent AA- by  Standard & Poor’s  and a step lower at A+ by
 Fitch Ratings .  Libor (US0003M) , the rate at which banks say they can
borrow from each other, was set at 0.24 percent today.  Bank of America Corp., Deutsche Bank AG, HSBC Holdings Plc
and Morgan Stanley helped to manage the sale, the filing shows.  To contact the reporter on this story:
