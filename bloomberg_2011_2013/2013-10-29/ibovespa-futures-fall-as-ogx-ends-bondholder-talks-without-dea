Ibovespa  futures  dropped as  OGX
Petroleo e Gas Participacoes SA  ended talks with bondholders
without an agreement.  State-run  Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4)  may move after people with
knowledge of the matter who asked not to be identified said
China National Petroleum Corp. was close to an agreement to buy
its assets in  Peru  for more than $2 billion.  Itau Unibanco
Holding SA (ITUB4) , Latin America’s biggest bank by market value, may
move after posting third-quarter earnings that exceeded
analysts’ estimates.  Ibovespa futures contracts expiring in December sank 0.7
percent to 54,330 at 9:17 a.m. in Sao Paulo. The real weakened
0.2 percent to 2.1830 per dollar.  OGX, the producer founded by former billionaire  Eike Batista , missed a $45 million payment on Oct. 1, prompting
Standard & Poor’s to assign a default rating to $1 billion of
bonds. The company said in a statement today that it had been
negotiating for months with holders of securities due in 2018
and 2022 and no accord was reached.  The Ibovespa entered a bull market Sept. 9 after rising 20
percent from this year’s low on July 3 through that day. The
gauge is still down 15 percent in dollar terms this year,
compared with a decline of 1.8 percent for the MSCI  Emerging
Markets  Index of 21 developing nations’ equities.  Trading volume of stocks in Sao Paulo was 6.79 billion
reais ($3.1 billion) yesterday, compared with a daily average of
7.61 billion reais this year through Oct. 22, according to data
