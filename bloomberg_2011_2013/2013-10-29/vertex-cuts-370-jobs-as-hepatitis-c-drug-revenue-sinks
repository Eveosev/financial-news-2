Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc. (VRTX)  will cut
370 jobs after revenue from the hepatitis C drug Incivek
declined and its third-quarter loss widened.  The firings represent a 15 percent reduction of the
company’s total workforce, Vertex said in a statement today. The
Cambridge, Massachusetts-based company said it expects its 2014
operating expenses will be $150 million to $200 million less
than this year’s, and it will take $35 million to $45 million in
2013 restructuring charges.  Vertex reached profitability briefly in 2011 after Incivek
was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to treat
hepatitis C, a chronic liver disease that affects about 150
million people worldwide. Sales of the drug peaked at $456.8
million in the fourth quarter of 2011 before beginning to
decline as doctors and patients started to anticipate newer
medicines hitting the market, including one from  Gilead Sciences
Inc. (GILD)  called sofosbuvir.  “As new medicines for hepatitis C near approval, fewer
people are starting treatment with Incivek, and as a result, we
are reducing our workforce supporting this medicine,” Chief
Executive Officer Jeffrey Leiden said in the statement. “Today
is a difficult day for everyone at Vertex, but these changes are
necessary as we work to develop new breakthrough medicines in
the coming years.”  Vertex will turn its focus to cystic fibrosis and other
programs in its pipeline, the company said.  Quarter’s Loss  The third-quarter loss widened to $124.1 million, or 54
cents a share, from $57.5 million, or 27 cents, a year earlier,
according to a separate statement. Excluding one-time items, the
loss was 32 cents a share, missing the average loss of 16 cents
from 12 analysts’  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  The company lowered its 2013 revenue forecast to $1 billion
to $1.05 billion, from a previous projection of as much as $1.2
billion.  Vertex sank 2.2 percent to $76.09 at 4 p.m.  New York  time.
The shares have increased 82 percent this year.  Vertex’s other approved therapy, Kalydeco for cystic
fibrosis, is gaining sales while Incivek is declining. Incivek
revenue fell 66 percent to $85.6 million in the quarter, while
Kalydeco sales more than doubled to $101.1 million, Vertex said.
Total revenue fell 34 percent to $221.7 million, missing
analysts’ average $275.8 million estimate.  Vertex increased its forecast for 2013 Kalydeco sales, to
as much as $365 million. The drug was approved in January 2012
to treat a rare form of cystic fibrosis, a genetic disease that
affects about 30,000 people in the U.S. The company also is
testing additional medicines for the disease, as well as for
hepatitis C, autoimmune diseases and influenza.  The workforce reductions leave Vertex with about 1,800
employees worldwide, the company said.  “We are expecting to see Incivek’s sales continue to fall
steadily through the end of this year and until sofosbuvir is
approved by the FDA, at which time we expect Incivek sales to
essentially fall to zero,” Brian Skorney, an analyst with
 Robert W. Baird , wrote in an Oct. 25 research note. “Investors
have now largely realized that Incivek will ultimately be a
short-lived asset.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
