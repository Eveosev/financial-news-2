China Vanke Co. (000002) , the biggest
developer by market value traded on the nation’s exchanges, said
third-quarter profit rose 18 percent as stronger demand from
homebuyers defied government efforts to curb prices.  Net income  jumped to 1.6 billion  yuan  ($263 million), or
0.146 yuan a share, from a year earlier, the company said in a
filing to the Shenzhen stock exchange today. Revenue increased
43 percent to 22 billion yuan.  China ’s home prices rose in all but one city in September
for a fifth month as the government refrained from introducing
more nationwide property tightening policies that would hinder
economic growth. Vanke’s contracted sales increased 33 percent
in the first nine months from a year earlier to 128.5 billion
yuan, the company said.  “We took a proactive sales strategy this quarter and
continued to target buyers who buy homes for self-use,” Vanke
said in the statement.  The company, which had 37.6 billion yuan of cash at the end
of Sept. 30, invested in 32 projects in the third quarter and
plans to take “a prudent investment strategy in future,”
according to the statement.  Chinese property developers will record milder year-on-year
sales growth in the last quarter of this year, Moody’s Investors
Service said in an e-mailed statement today.  A Hong Kong unit of Vanke will invest as much as $442
million to buy 884 million of shares in the initial public
offering of  Huishang Bank Corp. (0886140D) , according to terms of the deal
obtained by  Bloomberg News  today.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
