JetBlue (JBLU)  Airways Corp. delayed
delivery of some  Embraer SA (EMBR3)  jets, the smallest in its fleet, and
ordered 35 Airbus SAS aircraft valued at $4 billion as the
carrier focuses on larger, more-efficient planes.  The 24 Embraer E190 planes will arrive from 2020 to 2022
instead of 2014 to 2018, JetBlue said today in a statement. The
Airbus order is for 20 of the upgraded A321neo model with new
engines and 15 of the current version of that jet.  Chief Executive Officer Dave Barger’s E190 pullback extends
a move away from the Embraer plane, with New York-based JetBlue
now planning to cap the fleet at 60 after once placing orders
for 100 with options for 100 more. JetBlue is working to trim
expenses by adding the single-aisle Airbus planes, which consume
less fuel and carry more people than the E190s.  “The shift to larger aircraft is a trend we are seeing in
the industry as airlines seek to reduce unit costs by shifting
to more aircraft with more seats,”  Helane Becker , a Cowen & Co.
analyst in  New York , said in a note to investors. She rates
JetBlue market perform.  The E190s carry about 100 passengers, while JetBlue puts
190 people in the A321, Airbus’s biggest narrow-body model. The
order changes will reduce  capital expenditures  by $200 million
over the next three years, the airline said.  JetBlue fell 3.9 percent to $7.24 at the close in New
York, the biggest daily drop since May 1. The stock has advanced
26 percent this year. Embraer, based in  Sao Jose dos Campos ,
 Brazil , slid 6.5 percent to 16.65 reais in  Sao Paulo , the most
since July 11, 2012.  ‘Generally Positive’  The fleet changes are “generally positive,” Savanthi Syth, a Raymond James Financial Inc. analyst in  St. Petersburg ,
 Florida , said in an interview. The shares probably fell on
unhappiness that JetBlue has failed to meet a company target of
boosting return on invested capital by an average 1 percentage
point a year, she said. Syth rates JetBlue market perform.  JetBlue’s adjustments are “natural fleet management based
on market opportunities and the company’s business plan,”
Embraer said in an e-mailed statement. “It’s important to
emphasize that there has been no order cancellation but a
restructuring of deliveries overtime.”  Embraer, which said the plane will continue to be an
important part of JetBlue’s business model, had delivered 482
E190s as of Sept. 30, with 78 on backlog.  Recent Successes  “They’ve had a lot of successes over the past year or so
in terms of other U.S. campaigns,” Peter Skibitski, a Drexel
Hamilton LLC analyst in Atlanta, said of Embraer in an
interview. “I don’t think this JetBlue deferral decision is
going to have a meaningful impact.” He rates Embraer buy.  JetBlue said paring its Embraer fleet would occur “in the
near term” to help cut spending and better match available
seats with demand. In 2005, JetBlue was the initial customer for
the E190. The deferrals involve $1.11 billion of jets, based on
catalog prices. Buyers typically get a discount to list prices.  “While the E190 is critical to our continued success in
 Boston  and  San Juan , we are now at a point where our network
growth calls for larger gauge aircraft,” Barger said in the
statement.  The carrier now has 190 planes, made up of 130 Airbus
A320s, one A321 and 59 E190s. The fleet changes will
“significantly change our cost dynamics over the long run,”
the CEO told analysts on a conference call.  Cancellations, Delays  Today was the fourth time that JetBlue had canceled or
delayed E190 orders since 2006. The airline recently had
complained about higher-than-expected maintenance costs on the
E190 engines, which are made by a unit of  General Electric Co. (GE) 
The airline said after an earlier delay that the jets weren’t as
profitable as it had expected in some markets.  “The core reason behind the deferrals is the network
needed only about 60” 100-seat planes, Chief Financial Officer
Mark Powers said in an interview. “There’s always a place for a
good 100-seater in our fleet.”  JetBlue also converted orders for 18 A320s to A321s, a step
expected to cut fuel consumption per seat by as much as 15
percent, according to the statement. The changes let JetBlue add
15 incremental A321s to its fleet by 2017, with the 20 new
A321neo arrivals starting in 2018.  JetBlue announced a $2.5 billion order for 40 neo aircraft
from Toulouse, France-based Airbus in June 2011, and said then
it wouldn’t add more than 75 E190s to its fleet as it focused on
longer-range flying with the larger jets.  The airline also reported today that third-quarter net
income rose 58 percent to $71 million, or 21 cents a share, from
$45 million, or 14 cents, a year earlier. The average of 14
analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg was 22 cents.  Sales rose 10 percent to $1.44 billion, meeting estimates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
