Thirty bottles of 2000  Chateau
Latour , a Bordeaux first-growth estate, sold for the equivalent
of more than $13,000 a case in four trades on Liv-ex this month,
holding stable near the seven-month low it touched in September.  Twelve bottles sold for 8,150 pounds ($13,150) on Oct. 23,
following trades for six bottles each at a per-case equivalent
of 8,300 pounds on Oct. 13 and Oct. 18 and 8,220 pounds Oct. 11,
according to data on Liv-ex’s Cellar Watch website. Five cases
fetched 8,160 pounds each Sept. 13, the lowest since February.  The Liv-ex Fine Wine 50 Index, a benchmark for top Bordeaux
wines, has fallen more than 5 percent since the end of March,
paring its gain to about 1 percent this year. Muted investor
appetite for recent vintages of Bordeaux first growths has also
sapped appetite for older vintages.  “We’re very much at the bottom of the long-term cycle
now”  Miles Davis , partner of London-based Wine Asset Managers
LLP, said in an interview. “Longer-term it’s going to be
heading up. I’m not sure when it’s going to start, that’s the
big issue.” The fund has $20 million under management.  The Latour 2000 transaction on Oct. 23 was 4 percent down
from this year’s high of 8,500 pounds in February and 28 percent
below the 11,275 pound record it reached in July 2011, when
demand for Bordeaux was peaking, according to Liv-ex data.  Sotheby’s Sale  A case of Latour 2000 fetched 7,990 pounds at a  Sotheby’s 
sale in London last week, according to the auction house’s
website, while 12 bottles of the estate’s 2005 vintage fetched
6,815 pounds and a case of 1996 sold for 5,170 pounds.  “The provenance more than anything is key,” Stephen Mould, head of Sotheby’s European wine department, said in a
telephone interview following the sale.  The 2000 Latour ranks as the estate’s third-highest-priced
wine of the past 15 years, lagging behind only those from 2010
and 2009, according to merchant prices collated by  Liv-ex  on its
Cellar Watch website. Last week’s price was still more than
triple the 2,520 pounds a case for which it sold in August 2003
as it began trading on the exchange.  It was rated 98 on a 100-point scale by U.S. critic  Robert Parker  in a June 2010 online tasting note, making it the fourth-highest ranked vintage of the past 15 years.  Chateau Latour, with 78 hectares (193 acres) of vineyards,
traces its wine-growing history back to at least the 16th
century and has been owned since 1993 by French billionaire
 Francois Pinault , according to its  website .  Pauillac Estate  It was one of the first Bordeaux wine estates to install
stainless-steel tanks in its winery in the 1960s and fully
renovated them in 2001. Last year it set another precedent by
announcing it intended to no longer sell wine through the
Bordeaux futures system, instead reserving it for sale closer to
the time when it becomes ready to drink.  Latour is one of the five first-growth wine estates on the
left bank of the Gironde estuary and one of three in the
Pauillac district, along with Chateau Lafite Rothschild and
Chateau Mouton Rothschild. The classification was drawn up for
Napoleon III’s 1855 Paris Exhibition, and remains in force, with
Mouton joining the rank of first-growth in 1973.  To contact the reporter on this story:
