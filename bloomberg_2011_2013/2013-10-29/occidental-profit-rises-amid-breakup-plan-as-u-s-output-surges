Occidental Petroleum Corp. (OXY) , the U.S.
crude producer and chemicals company weighing a breakup to boost
 shareholder value , said third-quarter profit rose as output
surged in Texas and California.  Net income increased to $1.58 billion, or $1.96 a share,
from $1.38 billion, or $1.69, a year earlier, Los Angeles-based
Occidental said in a statement on  Business Wire  today. Per-share
profit excluding one-time items exceeded the $1.90 average of 24
 analysts’ estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  Chief Executive Officer Stephen I. Chazen, who has embraced
asset sales from the Middle East to North Dakota to turn around
a two-year slump, should embrace bigger changes,  Fadel Gheit , an
analyst with Oppenheimer & Co., said in an interview before
earnings were released.  “They need to give investors options and choices to
achieve the full value of their assets,” said Gheit, who rates
Occidental the equivalent of a buy and doesn’t own the shares.  Brent crude, the global benchmark, averaged $109.65 a
barrel in the July to September period, just 22 cents more than
the same period last year, and the average price of natural gas
futures traded in New York rose 23 percent from the year-earlier
quarter to $3.555 per million British thermal units.  Earnings were announced before regular trading began in
U.S. markets. Occidental rose 0.7 percent to $97.54 yesterday in
 New York . The shares, which have 22 buy ratings and seven holds
from analysts, have risen 27 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
