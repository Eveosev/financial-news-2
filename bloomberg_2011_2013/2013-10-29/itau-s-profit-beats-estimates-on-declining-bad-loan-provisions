Itau Unibanco Holding SA (ITUB4) , Latin
America’s largest lender by market value, said third-quarter
profit rose 18 percent, beating analysts’ estimates, as it set
aside less money to cover bad loans.  Recurring net income, which excludes one-time items,
climbed to 4.02 billion reais ($1.85 billion), or 81 centavos a
share, from 3.41 billion reais, or 69 centavos, a year earlier,
the Sao Paulo-based lender said in a statement today. That
compares with the  3.9 billion-real  estimate of nine analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg.  Chief Executive Officer Roberto Setubal, 59, shifted toward
less risky mortgage and payroll loans and away from auto finance
after default rates on consumer loans in  Brazil  reached a record
8.18 percent in May 2012. Provisions dropped 26 percent in the
third quarter from a year earlier.  “Privately owned banks in Brazil such as Itau and Bradesco
are more selective in giving credit,”  Pedro Galdi , head
strategist at Sao Paulo-based brokerage SLW Corretora, said in a
telephone interview last week.  Banco Bradesco SA (BBDC4) , the nation’s
second-biggest bank by market value, reported record earnings on
Oct. 21.  Itau  rose  10 percent this year through yesterday, compared
with a 0.5 percent gain for Osasco, Brazil-based Bradesco.  Itau posted provisions of 4.54 billion reais in the third
quarter, down from 4.91 billion reais in the second quarter, and
down from 6.12 billion reais a year earlier, according to the
statement. The lender estimates provisions will range from 19
billion reais to 22 billion reais in 2013.  Loans overdue more than 90 days declined for a fifth
straight quarter to 3.9 percent, compared with 4.2 percent in
the previous three months and 5.1 percent a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
