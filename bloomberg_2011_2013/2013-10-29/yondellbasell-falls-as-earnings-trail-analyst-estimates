-  LyondellBasell Industries NV (LYB) , the
largest producer of polypropylene, fell the most in four months
after third-quarter profit fell short of estimates on narrowing
oil-refining margins and rising propane costs.  LyondellBasell dropped 2 percent to $74.02 at 11:28 a.m. in
 New York , after earlier slipping as much as 4 percent, the most
intraday since June 24. The shares have gained 30 percent this
year.  Net income rose to $1.50 a share from $1.46 a year earlier,
the London-based company said in a statement today. Excluding a
loss from discontinued operations, profit was $1.51 a share,
trailing the $1.59  average  of 18 analysts’ estimates compiled by
Bloomberg. Revenue dropped 1.1 percent to $11.2 billion, less
than the $11.4 billion average estimate.  “Refining continued to be a headwind for the company amid
realization of weak refining spreads,” Don Carson, a New York-based analyst at Susquehanna Financial Group who recommends
buying the shares, said in a note today.  Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization at LyondellBasell’s refining unit dropped 95
percent to $8 million because of narrower margins, maintenance
and spending on renewable fuel credits, the company said. Ebitda
dropped by $60 million at the oxyfuels segment as sales volumes
and margins declined.  The biggest disappointment was in the U.S. olefins unit,
which makes plastics, where Ebitda fell 12 percent from the
prior quarter to $841 million, due to plant maintenance and
higher propane costs, Carson said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
