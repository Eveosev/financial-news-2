Canadian manufacturers’ raw material
costs fell for the time in five months in September, government
figures showed.  The  raw-materials price  index fell 1.5 percent, the first
decline since April, reflecting lower prices for crude oil and
vegetable products,  Statistics Canada  said today from Ottawa.
Economists predicted a 0.5 percent decline, according to the
median estimate in a Bloomberg survey with six responses.  The  industrial product price index , which measures how much
manufacturers received for their goods, declined 0.3 percent.
Economists predicted a 0.1 percent decline.  Over the 12 months through September, raw material costs
rose 2.1 percent and industrial prices rose 1.0 percent,
suggesting factory profit margins narrowed.  Statistics Canada said it had to infer some of the
industrial product price data for September it would normally
collect from the  U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics  because of that
country’s government shutdown. Industrial product price data
collected from the U.S. agency represents 6.7 percent of the
total product price index. The data will be revised in the next
release, the agency said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
