Epangelo Mining Co., a Namibian
state-owned  investment company , said it has found partners for
half the 39 licenses it was awarded to explore for diamonds,
uranium, copper, gold, zinc and rare earth metals.  Some of the joint-venture partners have paid “commitment
fees,” Eliphas Hawala, managing director of Windhoek-based
Epangelo, said in an interview yesterday. He declined to name
the companies and said Epangelo will soon seek partners for the
remaining license areas.  The government granted Epangelo exclusive exploration
rights in 2011 as the company builds its presence in the  mining
industry . Hawala said Epangelo would consider ceding majority
stakes to its partners should they be prepared to finance the
projects and bring them to commercial production.  “If an investor meets certain milestones, we will also be
reducing our shareholding to agreed levels,” Hawala said.  Epangelo is jointly exploring for zinc and other base
metals with Vedanta Resources Plc’s Skorpion mine and refinery
and for nuclear fuels at the Lofdal license area of Toronto-listed  Namibia  Rare Earths Inc.  Namibia, the world’s biggest offshore diamond miner and the
fourth-largest uranium producer, established Epangelo in 2008.
The company holds a 10 percent stake in Husab uranium mine,
which is developing the world’s fourth-largest deposit of the
nuclear fuel, and 10 percent of Kombat copper mine.  To contact the reporter on this story:
