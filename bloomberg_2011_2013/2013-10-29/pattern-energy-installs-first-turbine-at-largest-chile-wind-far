Pattern Energy Group Inc., the U.S.
wind developer that raised $319 million last month in an initial
public offering, installed the first turbine at a project in
northern Chile that will be the nationâ€™s largest.  The 115-megawatt El Arrayan wind farm near the city of
Ovalle, about 400 kilometers (250 miles) north of Santiago, is
expected to go into operation in mid-2014, San Francisco-based
Pattern said today in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
