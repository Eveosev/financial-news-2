Cycling’s ruling body will move
forward with plans for a new panel to investigate its handling
of doping after Lance Armstrong admitted cheating to win a
record seven Tour de France titles.  The  Union Cycliste Internationale  said in an e-mailed
statement it wants to examine “allegations of past wrongdoing”
to restore confidence in the sport. Former riders including
three-time Tour winner Greg LeMond say the UCI didn’t do enough
to stop doping and catch cheats.  The UCI is adhering to a pledge of Brian Cookson, a U.K.
cycling official who ousted Ireland’s Pat McQuaid as president
in a vote last month. McQuaid disbanded a previous external
panel in January, saying a better way to “clear the air” after
the Armstrong scandal was to create a so-called truth and
reconciliation panel.  Cookson will receive an annual salary of 340,000 Swiss
Francs ($378,000) as president of the Aigle, Switzerland-based
ruling body, which is 110,000 Swiss Francs less than McQuaid was
earning, according to the UCI statement.  To contact the reporters on this story:
