The premium for Los Angeles gasoline
widened versus futures for the first time in seven days as
refineries operated by  Tesoro Corp. (TSO)  and  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) 
reported upsets.  Tesoro’s 170,000-barrel-a-day Golden Eagle plant in
Northern California reported a small fire in a crude unit Oct.
26, a notice to Contra Costa county regulators showed. The blaze
didn’t damage equipment or affect the refinery’s ability to meet
supply commitments, Tina Barbee, a spokeswoman at Tesoro’s
headquarters in San Antonio, said by e-mail today.  Exxon’s 150,000-barrel-a-day Torrance plant in Southern
California reported a breakdown that caused emissions early
today, a notice to the South Coast Air Quality Management
District showed. The refinery said in a separate notice that it
plans to flare gases tomorrow through Nov. 3.  The premium for California-blend gasoline, or Carbob, in
Los Angeles broadened 2.25 cents to 9.5 cents a gallon versus
futures traded on the  New York  Mercantile Exchange, the biggest
differential in four days, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg at 1:50 p.m. New York time.  Prompt delivery  slipped
0.86 cent to $2.6742 a gallon.  Carbob in San Francisco strengthened 2.25 cents against
futures to a discount of 1.5 cents a gallon.  Tesoro Flaring  The 266,000-barrel-a-day Carson section of Tesoro’s Los
Angeles refinery reported plans to flare from Nov. 1 to Nov. 7,
a notice to the South Coast air agency showed. The flaring is
associated with work that won’t affect the company’s ability to
meet commitments, Barbee said.  The discount for conventional gasoline in Portland,  Oregon ,
a benchmark for the U.S. Pacific Northwest, was unchanged at 13
cents a gallon below futures. Diesel in  Portland  was unchanged
at 18.5 cents a gallon above ultra-low-sulfur diesel futures
traded on the Nymex.  The discounts for California-grade, or CARB, diesel in Los
Angeles and San Francisco held at 1.75 cents and 3.25 cents a
gallon, respectively.  The  3-2-1 crack spread  of Alaska North Slope crude, Carbob
in Los Angeles and CARB diesel in Los Angeles narrowed $1.70 a
barrel to $10.24. The spread, a rough indicator of refining
profitability, is the smallest in more than three weeks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
