Germany’s wine production,  Europe ’s
fourth-biggest, is estimated to be little changed this year as
rising output of whites such as  Riesling  more than makes up for
a lower volume of reds, the government statistics office said.  The 2013 vintage is forecast to increase to 9.11 million
hectoliters (241 million gallons) from 9.08 million hectoliters
in 2012, Statistisches Bundesamt wrote in a  report  on its
website today.  Germany is Europe’s second-largest wine importer behind the
U.K., with inbound shipments worth 2.47 billion euros ($3.4
billion) in the first half of 2013, according to data from the
International Organisation for Vine and Wine.  White wine from grapes including Riesling, Mueller-Thurgau
and Silvaner may increase to 5.71 million hectoliters from 5.55
million hectoliters, according to the statistics office. The
volume of reds may slide to 3.4 million hectoliters from 3.53
million hectoliters.  Germany ’s red wines include those from grapes such as pinot
noir, locally known as the Spaetburgunder, and Dornfelder.  The volume in Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany’s biggest wine
region, may slip to 5.92 million hectoliters from 5.99 million
hectoliters, as output of whites rises to 4 million hectoliters
from 3.89 million hectoliters and red-wine volume slips to 1.92
million hectoliters from 2.1 million hectoliters.  To contact the reporter on this story:
