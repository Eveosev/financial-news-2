Fed funds, the U.S. overnight inter-bank lending  rate , opened at 0.1 percent, within the  Federal
Reserve ’s target of zero to 0.25 percent.  Fed funds closed at 0.05 percent yesterday after trading
from 0.04 percent to 0.25 percent and averaging 0.07 percent,
according to ICAP Plc, the world’s largest inter-dealer broker.  The central bank will acquire Treasuries $1.25 billion to
$1.75 billion of Treasuries maturing from February 2036 to
August 2043. The purchases, which are permanent open market
operations, are the part of the Fed’s quantitative easing
program aimed at keeping long-term rates low.  The Fed may also conduct a test of an overnight fixed-rate
reverse repo facility. The temporary open-market operations will
use Treasuries as collateral.  To contact the reporter on this story:
