Hedge-fund manager Marshall Wace LLP
bought a stake in a firm that will create a closed-end fund to
allow institutional and private investors access to peer-to-peer
lending programs.  Marshall Wace, the $12.4 billion firm founded by Paul Marshall and Ian Wace, bought a controlling interest in Exchange
Associates (U.K.) Ltd. from investment bank Liberum Capital LLP,
the two London-based firms said in a statement today. Terms
weren’t disclosed.  Peer-to-peer lenders put investors together with
individuals and businesses that need small loans, charging a fee
for making that connection. Such lending “has the potential to
transform consumer and small-to-medium enterprise lending
practices worldwide,” Marshall Wace partner Michael Sargent
said in the statement.  The fund is expected to be traded on the London Stock
Exchange “in coming months,” according to the statement,
without being specific.  To contact the reporter on this story:
