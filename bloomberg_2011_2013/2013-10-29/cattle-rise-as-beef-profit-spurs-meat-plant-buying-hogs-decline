Cattle futures rose for the fourth
session on signs that rising demand for U.S. beef is boosting
profit margins for meat processors. Hog prices declined.  Wholesale-beef  prices  are up 9.6 percent since the end of
July and are the highest since June 5, according to the  U.S.
Department of Agriculture . U.S. exports of the meat rose 3.3
percent to 1.69 billion pounds (767,777 metric tons) in the
eight months through Aug. 31, compared with the same period a
year earlier, government data show.  “It is a lot easier for packers to pay for cattle” with
profit rising on beef sales,  Dan Vaught , an economist at Doane
Advisory Services in  St. Louis , said in a telephone interview.
“Export demand is remaining pretty strong.”  Cattle futures for December delivery advanced 0.4 percent
to close at $1.34275 a pound at 1 p.m. on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange. Prices capped the longest rally since Sept. 27, after
touching a nine-month high of $1.347 on Oct. 25. Feeder-cattle
futures for January settlement fell less than 0.1 percent to
$1.669 a pound.  Hog futures for December settlement declined 0.7 percent to
91.35 cents a pound on the CME. Yesterday, the price touched
92.1 cents, the highest for the contract since it began trading
in June 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
