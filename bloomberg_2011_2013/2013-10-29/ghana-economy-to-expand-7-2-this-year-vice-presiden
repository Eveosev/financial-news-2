Ghana’s economy will expand 7.2
percent, less than the previous estimate of 7.9 percent,
limiting the government’s ability to narrow its  budget deficit ,
Vice President Kwesi Amissah-Arthur said.  Gross domestic product will grow at a faster pace next
year, helping to narrow the gap, he said in an interview in the
capital,  Accra , today. The government will target a budget gap
of 9.2 percent of gross domestic product this year and 6 percent
next year, he said earlier at a conference in Accra.  “We expect  tax revenue  to grow quite significantly next
year as business investments expand,” he said. “The revenue
agency is expanding the tax net, putting in place measures to be
more efficient.”  Ghana’s credit rating was cut this month by  Fitch Ratings 
after rising government wages and falling revenue from gold
prevented the government from narrowing the budget gap to 9
percent target. The deficit had ballooned to 12.1 percent last
year because of increases in public sector wages, which consume
about 70 percent of tax revenue.  Ghana slashed subsidies on fuel, water and power to curb
the budget deficit this year. While the removal has cut
 government spending , the impact of the higher prices is being
passed on to inflation, Amissah-Arthur said. Inflation quickened
to 11.9 percent in September, the fastest pace all year.  The cedi dropped 0.5 percent to 2.2053 per dollar at 12:41
p.m. in Accra, extending the decline this year to 14 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
